2 cent
rotten smile <:GarieLaugh:740956278163243050>
and that one idol song in 2 appears in 7
even the writer for Macross 2 is the main writer of 7
also, the "MACROSS 2 DOESN'T EXIST" is bullshit, since that is the reason why things like Plus and 7 exist in the first place
Because of the retconning
https://twitter.com/Htop_Gunder/status/1373716955383877634

also, i don't like that thing of retconning events or characters

Sad...
Nice girl
looks nice
i need to watch that one
Outlaw Star is the one that interest me the most
Nice collection
https://twitter.com/180223/status/1342331025658052609
idk
That other season with a green precure
Oh
At least Miyuki is cute
......okey
God......
nice
such a cute girl
l e g s
i really wanna read the Wandering Witch lns
>empty symbolism
all the symbolism in EVA is pretty simple
>unrelatable characters
I mean, nobody is gonna say "dude, that character is literally me" but at least you can understand why they are like that
yeah, with the Re Edition OVAs
pretty good and sad henshin heroe story
i honestly prefer the Kikaider anime over the manga but both are worth the read / watch
bro, that ending... this ova is a much better version of the 2 last volumes of the manga, i will watch the The Boy Who Carried a Guitar OVA later.
btfo Fukui
idk about that
okey....
all Tomino related Gundam UC is good, minus ZZ for obvious reasons
idk about IBO
bruh
the AU that interest me the most outside of G and 00
Nadia has the same episode count as Gundam X
oh, sorry
IBO, nah
except for the color
i really like the Movie version respected Moriki original design
i have so much interest in Hathaway's KINO
maybe i will find that out when i watched it
dayum
Kirika's gundam
Duo "Toshihiko BASED" Maxwell
Seed Destiny has Sahashi doing the OST
damn, i wonder if the IBO deaths are more stupid than the Victory ones
idk i remember that Majikura review that says if the protagonist was a ugly bastard or a fat otaku everybody will consider it horrible
right....
bruh
Sora no Otoshimono
tbh that one were Soichiro Hoshi voiced the protagonist looks much worse
tfw the "pure maiden" girl is the most boring one and in one special they favor her
gud thing i only watched reviews of that show
Oh..
But is true that is more relevant than the rest?
Oh right
She is hot though
I hear that girl in the S2 is more relevant than the rest of the girls or something
don't know but it looks pretty fucking pedo
.....
at least she looks cute
yeah
||one dead||
two girls
thank god
Kira is king
at least that guy doens't have a romance with his sister?
also Naoe Yamato looks kinda like Kira Yamato but Naoe is better
>kirito with bow
lol
Prison School but worse
and by the scenes i watched it, looks like a pretty trash adaptation
afaik in the Majikoi anime every main girl loves Yamato despite the fact that in the VN after the prologue, only Minako really loves Yamato for backstory reasons
and that is the joke?
yeah but
>Naoe Yamato exist
>Dark Schneider exist
and they are much better protagonist than those two
even DS gets beated by the girl he loves
+ the actions of the protagonist are so much from a sexual predator
i really like Arcueid and Ciel
i'm starting the Mayu route
mine is Majikoi
i need to play that VN
black hair girls are also my favorite
that's nice
i'm a sucker for blue hair waifus
I do not doubt it
her reactions are so cute
yes
cute blue hair waifu <:TsubasaDere:768545990495961129>
looks interesting, plus, Fumino looks adorable
||and then there is chapter 187, but afaik it looks like other reality or route||
damn
||>having multiple endigs for the girls||
how is that a middle finger to the audience?
oh
Bokuben or To Love-Ru?
i know
and probably none of them are +18
anyway, bokuben looks cute
oh god........
i got the novels in my hard drive long ago
oh i see....
that looks interesting ngl
oh ho ho ho ho
bring back melty
eltnum jav
Melty bro
10/10 design
idk maybe will be a interesting read, the text parts in Cerebus looks worse
NEVER SAY GOODBYE
All the Tobikage OST is pretty great
i wonder what message it is
>some of the messages in it definitely don't fly well anymore
i wonder...
that only makes it better
i know
i still have to watch that, a little bit horny in some scenes from what i see
<:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
based
<:ShirabeChibi:698939825155473499>
again, normal class i guess
outlaw star in SRW when?
https://youtu.be/dhxCs-ijwrA
Shamanic Princess transformations
i really want to watch Voltes V
FILIPINO GANG RISE UP
Affranchi Char >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
tbh i don't know about S2 outside of the reverse roles of the factions
god, i hate that term so much
"jaja ibo edge xdddddddddddddddddddd"
yeah i remember that
oh...
the backround
i mean, i see a shot from Seed Destiny that is very similar to a shot in Turn A
whaaaaaat?
Holy shit, i'm a Sunrise boi
In no particular order
>Tekkaman Blade
>Betterman
>Scryed
>Layzner
>Cyber Formula (TV series and OVAs)
and i like that aspect because not even Shin Kamen Rider was that savage in content like The Last Man
it's a nsfw manga and is very disgusting in some parts
and yeah, that is my profile pic
i swear to god, this scene in the manga is pure kino
btw The Last Man and other Tetsuya Egawa scanlations never
i reallly want to watch Casshan
like Casshan for example https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eK3lRGJGbZA
the guy is a Ishinomori fan (already based enough) that makes videos regarding the production about various animes
Mercury Falcon >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
but i don't care about him
at least thanks to him, they found a anime with no raws or video format
i watched that video a looooooooooong time ago
that guy who copypaste his opinions from /a/ and /m/
>kenny lauderdale
oh right
despite u know why
Flay is cute though
ok, what?
and logic
loooooooooooooooooooooooool
"Technicallly she's a loli (a new born spider) so let me report this to FBI"
and funny cause they also produced Gunhed along with Toho
or the Brave Series
sad they never bring Cyber Formula or Outlaw Star to latam
Sunrise was making anime since the 70s
yup
Ange looks great in that costume
they are so cute
nana-chan day <:TsubasaDere:768545990495961129>
SATELAITO CANNON
G, wing and x
the 90s ones
Tbh i will start with the AUs after reading the other uc mangas that i have in ptr and Gaia Gear https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLx4nTBAjp7sqCtjfFJ3YB5K1K8VCRmv7c
Gundam versus
Damn
And some uc mangas like thunderbolt up until vol 7
Kino is back on the menu
I already watched all the uc animated things
imagine thinking Genesic is a overdesigned mess
nice
Afaik yes
Tbh  Nanoha interest me for other reasons
>SO MUCH GAY
>9 years old main characters
.....
No more godlike mechanical design
<:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
Yeah, it's sad it will never be continued officially
It's so great <:MariaBliss:688836867390439585>
Look at this
Perfect
But that mechanical design is aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah <:MikuJoy:738234684655403110>
Idk
But tbh, Vivid manga looks interesting
Tfw Forces is cancelled
HASHIRE MEROSU NO YOUNI
LONELY WAY
yup
Lu Caine
of course
let's goooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
the macross people
oh, sorry
how could they forget a gainax anime?
sounds nice
level 5 action rpg series
Shurato be like
better having one episode that has bad animation than having the last part of the series, except the last episode, having bad animation
someday
i would find that out
hmmmm...
Well, if the antagonist is a woman, obviously i will be attracted to her
and eroge
Sengoku Rance is RPG
damn
i want to read it
a year ago
and WitP?
everyone says you need to watch 0079 and Zeta before that movie
why the hell you would start with CCA?
????????
all the people i know like CCA
oh, i see...
it's good
watch it
he literally lost everything
but with the Zeta ending is understandable why he becomes like that
but it makes sense
waaaaaaaaaaaaat
bruh
or CCA?
and what about Zeta?
i already did in 2019
yes
lol
i see
00 def is one of the AU series who interest me the most
tbh is better to start with 0079 or The Origin manga
not in a million years
lol
meme lord
Nina is cute
Kou is better than Banana and the Narrative protagonist
BRUH
GOAT OPENING
say it to Unicorn and Narrative
and tbh Thunderbolt would be also a nice start
??????
<:ChrisBang:702166093065748500>
guns
ah, that one was sicc
Hildorf is lml
lol that subs
i think is because of the difference in plot and characters from the OG series and The Origin manga, since this one is a reinterpretation of the OG
i need to watch that when /m/ subs finish the new subs
Voltes V gang rise up
Based
a lot of directors and writers have various works with similar themes and i don't call that a bad thing
again, that is something that they could handle in much interesting ways but they don't do it because they don't want to do risky things (despite making entries like II, Plus, 7 and Zero)
and that isn't a answer because they could have different three people relationship that isn't a romantic one (like the one in 7 that i don't want to say who they are because is spoiler)
yeah, but i don't think the direction in that OVAs is bad by any means
that was Hiroshi Oonogi
and he didn't write Zero
i didn't see much of him as writer, outside of the last episode of SDF wich is great
Kawamori is a great mechanical designer, not in a million years i will consider it a hack
like, the 7 one i don't consider it a real love triangle and the 7 Trash manga is more of a romantic relationship with two people because with the other girl they do no nothing
yeah, but why have one in EVERY ENTRY IN THE FRANCHISE?
seriously, fuck love triangles
and yeah, love triangle with one girl who is a minor
also, for some reason the protagonist is Shinn Asuka (literally same VA) instead of Focker
and the VFs in Zero look way more advanced than the ones in the SDF series
more like they added mystical shit to the protoculture stuff
eh no... more like the ending fucking sucks
yeah, i started with Zero but after watching first series and the movie, i dislike Zero way more than when watched it
i mean, i find it weird to start with Frontier while you could start with the first series or DYRL
okey?
uh.....
i have little to no interest in regards to Frontier and Delta btw
both of those are good btw, but i consider Plus better
and then you could watch Plus or II Lovers Again
SDF Macross or the DYRL movie
FINALLY
yeah....
god, the prequel chapters in Macross the First look more interesting than this
Plus came before 7 both in release and chronologically
Zero > SDF / DYRL > Plus > 7 > Frontier > Delta
idk why they tie that into a sequel when is a fucking prequel of the original series
yup
and not just simply giving the whole credit to the creator or the director
i mean, these people are also important for the making of the show
there are also some other roles that make the show how it is like character designers, music composers, animators, etc
yeah, but the writer is the one who develops the themes and story of the show, and there are some cases where the creator or director isn't the one who writes his own shows
and again, i didn't see any series where Kawamori is the actual writer, so i have to watch those series to have a opinion of them
Nice
Damn
nice
i will watch the OG series first
Ikr
<:TikiPraise:672430544381935625>
Also Sahashi making the OST
also, a big love letter to the franchise
thanks for reminding me that i have to read the Xross Wars manga
Nena is crazy
damn
Gundam Seed character
like Flay
Nena is a bad girl
i need to see the series to find out
i like Marina the most in terms of appearence
-black hair
-young adult
-princess
Feldt looks cute
what about Marina?
this artist https://twitter.com/huangdanlan
i remember a artist in twitter wich draws Tieria as a woman
oh
nice
i want to watch that series
A Ken Ishikawa manga translated lml
https://mangadex.org/title/51154/gale-beast-machine-corps-203
i didn't like Unicorn at all, specially the psychoframe stuff
CCA was already a better conclusion
eh....
in your dreams
"The Crossbone Vanguard continues to hold control over the Frontier colonies, until the return of Berah Ronah in U.C. 0125, who denounces Meitzer, resulting in a civil war between the members of the Ronah family and their respective supporters, resulting in Cosmo Babylonia ultimately collapsing in U.C. 0128."
specially since we don't know what happens after the movie ending
everyone
SEIEI ENBU
right
yup
i still prefer her OG hairstyle
<:KanadeSmile:672455286392356884>
if they make a anime or in some cases a manga / comic, they will have to tweak the designs to be less detailed
the Man Machines are so detailed because they were made for the novels

they are, only the Zorin Soul in his original appearance is similar to the og mobile suits
the antagonist are a Man Hunting group of the Federation btw
>he is part of a love square in the novel
>a memory clone of Char who literally was made to be the leader of a group
>only knows about the colonies, Char / Casval, MS / Man Machine stuff because of Char memories
>literally wants to be with Everly
Gundam novels / radio drama
Gaia Gear
Affranchi is my favorite male character and protagonist in the franchise
Dante in Gundam
Cecily <:KanadeSmile:672455286392356884>
it's hard to choose who i like most of the two, guess i have to watch the series
ah yeah
she and Marina are the girls i like the most in looks
damn
so cute
awww <:MikuPraise:585839808765493249>
bruh
||in reality is Marina though||
unless you know spanish (i'm a native spanish speaker)
btw Saga and Sin are only in HK subs, wich is sad because they are the peak
oh, in that aspect yeah
the CFs are way different than that one
eh...
IT IS
ikr
unless is created with the Lego Technic parts
not even the Cyber Formula ones?
i mean, it's a nice way to design and create but i don't think it works with EVERYTHING
like Kobayashi
unless he work with custom plastic modes
idk
and probably with Cyber Formula and AC too
from the concept design i saw, no
afaik no
since they only deform certain parts in the modes
also, idk if the Cyber Formula cars count
and the Armored Core ones too
Zephyrantes and Physalis don't transform <:TsubasaSmug:585839805737467920>
goat designer
yf-19 and 21
bruh
tbh that series and manga doesn't interest me that much
damn
https://basara-nekki.weebly.com/basara-analysis.html
i mean, there is a analysis of Basara that it really caught my attention
i don't think that since the series and that extra ova episode is enough to justify the way he acts
it is lml
what a fucking idiot
yup
and i don't think it drags early on because i watched the series + ovas in like 3 days
same for Plus
7 is great for various reasons
Poor Kou
like, how the fuck you have a romantic relationship with a guy who is a walking propaganda?
it's a shame what they do to Nina in the last episodes of the series
in terms of appearance Nina and Cima def are my favorites
eh...
tbh i like that one girl from La Vie en Rose the most
Though i have a interest in 0083 Rebellion manga
Eh no, i already watched it in 2019
the rwby girls are cute tough
xd
More like Our War Game 3
hmmmm....
yup
full manga translation never
Maybe i will watch that, someday
I heard about the 3 first episodes and something about the ending
The SD mechas in that series are nice
I have interest in that series too
4koma with lore sounds nice
I watched Kill la Kill when I was 14, it was fun
That isn't how it works
Eh no...
Gasaraki looks more complicated and weird than Eva afaik
Eh... i don't think is weird
And i watched Eva for the first time when i eas 7 or 8 years old
Also I don't think is shocking or ptsd inducing, unless you are a little kid
Oh yeah, that movie that everyone says is complicated even though it has a message that is so simple that they end up telling you in like the last part of it
Cute Medaka
Damn
i'm not interesed in that anime
and play the stalker games
i wanna read the book and watch the Stalker movie
cute
Appmon afaik was bad
everything can be a Digimon
Blitz Greymon lmlmlml
yup
my fav designs are the Kenji and As'Maria ones
Starlight Velocity
https://wikimon.net/Magna_Garurumon
crazy ability like most of the digimons
it's pretty good
but outside of that, i don't have any complaint of Kaiser Greymon design-wise
Agnimon is similar but it isn't part of the family, i would like more a ultimate evolution that is a Demon Man / Dragon type just like his previous evolutions
yeah, it's such a cool design, altough i don't like the fact that Agnimon Ultimate evolution is part of the Greymon family
bruh
and? Everyone needs more culture
the kikaider reboot movie has the saddest ending
Tekkaman Blade, Layzner, Scryed, Ryvius and Kikaider
i'm interested a little bit in the manga since the writer is the same as the one in Majikoi VN
fuck the dub
seriously
bruh
oh yeah that show that nobody talks about the og version because they always watch the meme dub
i watched Cyber Formula and i loved it
someday i will watch the OG Beyblade subbed
Japan is stupid
for me is Ursula
yup
at least the girls look cute in that show
i have a big curiosity over that series
thank god, i'm not like Araragi
ikr
eh... i don't think it's a problem for me, but i'm more interested in Oh Great manga version
yeah
what a strange way of saying Cecily / Berah
based scryed
I only watched 3 episodes
I need to watch the Gridman toku
Yup xd
bruh
bruh
?
???
and it is justified
only in the beginning
bruh
what about that ||space whale|| in Seed?
yeah, that one
and that's all
hmmm...... good question, Zoltan, Banana, ||Minerva in Unicorn||, that one blond girl in Narrative who literally says "i want to be a bird in my next life" like 4 TIMES...
yup
well, there is AU movie where a alien race is the antagonist, so every crazy shit could be in a gundam story by that point
sounds nice
oh....
bruh
LET'S GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
the AU girls that i mention are important characters in the series and are the main focus in some parts
also, if we are talking about main characters, Rain from G Gundam, Relena from Wing, Tiffa from X and Dianna and Kihel from Turn A
oh and Noel Anderson
>chris from War in the Pocket
>Asuna Elmarit from Ecole du Ciel
>Rita from Narrative (fuck that character btw)
<:TsubasaAngry:692141154531016765>
bruh
damn, i have so much interest in the S2
i don't have hope for that because probably will be bullshit
that makes no fucking sense
i will say "watch Cyber Formula and Dendoh" but those are only fully completed in spanish
Seed Destiny is the one who is truly bad afaik
yes lml
||i really hope they will not revive Neil||
00 3rd season will be interesting
Seed movie when?
cute pink hair girl
inb4: Winvurga is better than Cross Ange
but i prefer other sci-fi armors
yeah, they are nice looking
eh... when i get to 00 i will see how is the S2
damn
||orbital ring||
hmmm...

reminds me of Kota Hoshino's AC4/For Answer OST
i like both
uh....
the latam dub version of Fire is lml
but it's the best Haro <:HibikiSad:738234648509022368>
tfw no Victory's Haro <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
because is a pretty nice song <:KanadeSmile:672455286392356884>
why they cry?
and Chris is smart <:ChrisHappy:660870796696223744>
cause i'm smart
baka
based
<:ElsaPat:637356110415659063>
noooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
i have to read the manga, but i know the anime is a good adaptation
Right
Considering some of the backstory of G, i doubt it
Ehmmmm...
||War stories always have deaths||
Okey
Thoughts on the series?
Uff
yup, it's a good option
k then
<:ChrisHappy:660870796696223744>
afaik that is true
also, the other series that has one writer and does all of that is Gundam X
*writer since it both seasons and movie have one writer doing all the job (concepts and development of that concepts throughout the series) https://anidb.net/creator/1572
http://www.zeonic-republic.net/?page_id=8174
and the proposal for Zeta was more happy in that
it's pretty good
yup
Nanai ‚ù§Ô∏è
oh yeah that one.....
i like that one
NICE
it's a nice manga
based
it's no surprise that the mangaka of Black Lagoon also does doujins
uffff
gud <:CarolSmug:617040484111745027>
i should read the manga someday, all the girls are nice looking
nice <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
where is the lie?
cute giant woman <:MikuPraise:585839808765493249>
7 and Plus are my favorites <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
that OVA is fantastic
i have little interest in Frontier and Delta tbh
3 years ago
i saw II after Plus
the conclusion is very similar to the SDF episode 27 which is a bit lackluster, but at least is not something worse
the II is pretty nice in terms of design and music and story is interesting
<@!208460211906805761> (i continue in this channel since is more appropriate) the "ii is bad because kawamori isn't involved" take is also bad since Mikimoto and Miyatake are involved in that OVAs as character and mechanical designers respectively
i mean, one Alter is a literal Brave / Yuusha-like mecha
Scryed
<:MikuPraise:585839808765493249>
yup <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
wonder if the rest of the Brave / Yuusha series OST is officially there
also on youtube

chonkers
you have no idea how many bad takes i see in the internet
i have that image btw
i remember they deleted the image once it was posted there because of some things it says in that thread
and Hilda for some reason
it was Embryo
IT'S PARTY TIME
yup
i need to read that manga
<:HibikiTired:422925410490253313>
thanks <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
gud
okey, search time
link plz
like pixiv artists
i say that because there are japanese artists who do commissions
sad
oh...
i mean, does it have a pixiv or twitter account at least?
altough it's strange that the mangaka never did other manga after that
same thing happened to Keijo manga
i think it was related
the worst part of it is that because the anime was trash, they cancelled the sequel manga
happy birthday megumi
<:KanadeSmile:672455286392356884>
i prefer calling her Medusa
i will watch it when the series is finished airing
ah okey
cute
oh
nice <:KanadeSmile:672455286392356884>
weird looking rodan
or at least, up to date
sad that the manga isn't completed in english
interesting
eh, not so much, Jojo part 4 and 5 anime both have 39 episodes
||at the end of Zeta it shows the body of the hyaku shiki floating in space with the cockpit open, probably Char survived the explosion thanks to the MS ||
i don't like that episode for various reasons other than that
*popped
>Kira
>good
but Kira and Mu are the worst in that aspect
nope, you spelled it right
please don't compare Shiro to THAT CHARACTERS
<:ShirabeCheer:671887003414954005>

wait, whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa <:MariaWhat:672245553920344080>
although that one is funny, tbh, having no emotional attachment to your creations is something that i dislike about authors and stuff
watch SDF
and? showa manda is cool
maybe i will watch it just for curiosity
idk about the Zeta new translation films
nah
doubt
>awful show
specially her empowered form
the protagonist magical girl form looks nice ngl
i see
lol
<:MikuBliss:336657233712513024> this one looks so great

BOOSTO ON
<:MikuLaugh:688429715676987428>
but you gotta understand that "mecha" has so many exceptions to the rule when it comes to defining the term
technically it is, considering the japanese definition of mecha
Looks super fun
I still have to watch it

great ending song
Yup
Right
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Show-Ya
I think Show-Ya is way older
I listened to some songs of them, nice band
okey, i understand, sorry
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j30WZ0a8pY
as for the Eizo's Fukuyama medley it's alright i don't think is equally good as Sahashi because
>not a official live video just recorded by a fan in the public
at least they respected the songs unlike the Scryed opening one wich very different to the og in composition
okey, the reason why i like the deep purple medley is because Sahashi is a great composer and arranger overall and there isn't a single ost that i listen that is made by him that i don't like. the parts of the songs in the medley are great too https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rvlzo-UpddY
i didn't insult you
bruh, i just think those medleys are better than that
>as a medley
Sahashi's Deep Purple medley and that Eizo Sakamoto's Fukuyama live medley are better
F
the Re:Fire album is better than that song tbh
and i'm refering to the actual ost not the idol or artist songs
specially the first one
from the series i watched, yes
>macross frontier crossover
bruh
no wonder why they are my favorites installments of the franchise
Macross 7 and Plus have my favorite osts
