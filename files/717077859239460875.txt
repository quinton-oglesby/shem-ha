Hello!
In that case, y'all should get hyped for a crossover/sequel fic where the AzuDai girls become gear users.
Glad to see an AzuDai fan in this server!
Oh, Osaka avatar pic!
Welcome!
Welcome!
Hello!
Hello!
Hello!
Hello!
I'm also a fan of Azumanga Daioh (which is celebrating its anniversary year with the Symphogear franchise).
Yo! I'm Rachel, and I'm getting into Symphogear (btw Chris and the Zababa pair are best girls for me!).
Hello!
Hello!
Welcome!
Welcome!
Don’t go!<:ShirabeWeep:701475635025019000>
Hello!
Hello!
What?!
I think them came because of the #RIPTwitter thing.
This must happen!
So beautiful...
Good.
Tsubasa with a spear... Kanade, did you give Gungnir to Tsubasa?!
Squirrel Bikki!
Did this little doodle... wonder if any of y'all are a TMM fan.
A tribute to Mia Ikumi...
Nice!

JAM Project Symphogear cover when?!
The OP now has the determination to fist!
Is this a cover?
This is epic!
Planet Earth, I made you proud: https://twitter.com/tlover229/status/1518949596218728450?s=21
Thanks!
Thanks!
I had too much fun on VRoid, and made Tomo and Yomi there.
A Phoenix themed mecha just in time for Rooster day!
Swivel Man no Uta.
Jobby the Hong… he cool.
<:MariaChuckle:672465496515411984>
Or the Zababa lolis with each other’s gears!
I NEED MORE GEAR SWAPS LIKE THIS!!!
Flipping cute and wholesome!
<:FudouEyes:672846284725682195>
Zenbu in Norse mythology!
Fluffy Chris-chan!
Oh... thanks for the context!
WFT?!
BWAHAHAHA!!!
Nah, Kirk-Chan will approve of her waifu pole dancing <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Well, I can accept that! After all, all fandoms should accept all opinions.
EHH?!
Me too!
We need more of this!
Me too!
And Fudo could be the villain of Season 2
And the Noise are MOTWs!
And the Autoscorers, Bavarian Illuminati, and Noble Red?
But where’s Ogawa, Tsubasa’s ninja manager?
Someone should make a fanfic about this!
And the finale has the Zababies go X-Drive on Shem-ha!
And being as manly as possible!
And Genjuro?
A  fate worse than death(or dess) for Chris-chan.
Zababa lolis if they were in a Sunday Morning Anime.
Yum...<:FudouEyes:672846284725682195>
Boobies...
Welp, we’re going to wait for that.
And now, where’s Shirabe in Igalima?!
That’s the power of DESS!<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
SO CUTE!!!!<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Happy Birthday to the VA that gave the sword a voice!
KAWAII!!!

<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
The girls!
You're welcome!
She looks so cute!

Tomo with Gungnir: https://www.deviantart.com/cinobi/art/Tomo-chan-9-319216326
True.
With some help from her master Genjuro, of course!
True! And when Hibiki has a good character arc (except in GX), then she's good in all of our books.
Why?
She’s probably one of the best shounen protagonists of all time.

But she’s already gay... with Miku.
Note to self: Don't give Tsubasa some sake.
What about the other girls?
True... no drunk boxing Hibiki tonight!
But what about drunk Tsubasa? Or drunk Hibiki?
And now I wanna see a drunk Maria!
YES!!!
Giant Zababies.
A what if:https://twitter.com/dremstir/status/1224710821764386816?lang=ar-x-fm
Kaiju Kirika!
Maria tomato.
Tigress Hibiki!
Get your own room, you two!
BEST GIRL!
Baby Zenbu!
Baby Basa!
Maria with the kittens.
Genjuro in a speedo... that’s new.
Remembering Kanade... Tsubasa’s doing this for Kanade’s sake.
The Second Division trio themselves!
Shirabe: Why do I hear boss music?
The Women in Black.
My children!
And Miku approves of this!
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
YES!!!
Dess!
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Yes please.
<:HibikiGay:670494484701773845>
KAWAII!!!! (Dies)
<@!222517038042710017>
When Tsubasa’s not looking.
Can’t wait for the level where Wolf!Kirika ||shrinks done to Shirabe’s size to go inside of the emperor||
But who would be Tsubasa’s Kushi... Maria or Kanade?
And Tsubasa’s Susano’o bc of course.
<:ShirabeWeep:701475635025019000>
Laura’s a giant!
Hail Zenbu!
Zenbu is best girl.
True, and now Manatsu has a giant girlfriend!
The girls.
Miku can finally have the charm point.

I have no comment...<:ChrisShock:620077681484103680>
What the F-?!
Yes.
Drunk Demon Hibiki... Hey Shem-Ha Possessed!Miku! We found your waifu!
Ah! Some PLA art!
Hibiki needs horny.
Momotaro: Tsubasa Edtion!
The Zababies want to see some horny stuff!
So cute!!!
Hibiki troll moment.

Goddess Kirika... can she turn into a wolf?
<:HibikiGay:670494484701773845>
Welp, we're boned!
<:HibikiGay:670494484701773845>
(Y)DESS!!!!
I need to read your fic!
<:HibikiGay:670494484701773845>
Slice of Life anime have many overlapping themes, so there’s no need to go to fandom war.
Hello fellow AzuDai fan.
There’s no heterosexual explanation about this.
Miku’s dream.
Hibiki’s heaven(needs some Miku)

<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
And don’t steal Miku from Hibiki.
Hibiki is a sweet soul. Protect her at all costs.
Likely the former.
Chris, do that to me!
<:HibikiGay:670494484701773845>
<:HibikiGay:670494484701773845>
RIP Kanade... you were the light at the end of Tsubasa’s suffering.
Maria is best mom.
Tsubasa’s bad at everything expect battle and singing.
It’s like combining the mecha with the mecha pilot suits!
<:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
<:HibikiGay:670494484701773845>

Give her some Biki now!
That'll be so cute!

I don’t see the image.
Of course.
Chris-chan!
So: <:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
Tsubasa suffers less now.
Oh this is the image Dr Ver put it Miku’s head while she was wielding SSJ.
POV: You are Miku, and you made Hibiki wear that outfit.
Ah! I need  this AU now!!!
It seems like the charm point has moved up...
<:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
Kirika!
The Zababies are hiding under Maria’s skirt!
Likely no. 2.
YES!!
Basa is cute!

So fitting!
And Maria doing that to Tsubasa is carrying Kanade’s will.
So cute!
YES!!!
Wholesome Hibiki!
Aoi Yuki willed this!
Oh no... a kaboom will happen!
Here’s the answer: <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>

How to cure suffering.
(Y)Dess!
This is wholesome cuteness...  DMJii for life!!!
KAWAII!!!
And I wanna know the purpose of the Chibi Kirika robo!
Can I have the chibi Kirika robo?
Maria if she’s a White Blood Cell(Same VA BTW)
That looks so cool!!!
One word: Tsubasa.
You mean lion Maria.
Hibiki and Kirika are dogs, Tsubasa’s a wolf, Chris is a snow leopard, Maria’s a lioness, Shirabe’s a cat, and Miku’s a fox.
Symphogear girls as cute animals.
Best Johto Stater as Best girl

Kirika is trying out Shirabe’s gear on the latter’s birthday!
This is my heaven.
This is the POV of Kirika.
Hibiki needs some financial help with the rice and rice.
The best exchange!
Mango Kanade!
The first image is Adult Bikki (AKA now) while the second image is how it started.
Bnuuy!
Kirika is wearing Shirabe’s gear. I like it!
And now I need Kanade with a banana spear(which means her death was caused by either hungry monkeys or hungry Minions... oh no...)
Zenbudous!
The best mid-stage stater evolution.
True! Enjoy the happy family!
~~This is no husbands.~~

Merry Christmas!
Normal Chris, Moe Chris, Idol Chris, they’re mine.
Yes.
All of the Chris in the world is mine.
Chris is Chris.
But not Chris.
It all makes sense.
And at the same place.
It’s an Aoi Yuki character, we can swap the roles a little.
Princess Kaguya: Hibiki edition <:HibikiGay:670494484701773845>

Shouta Aoi, why you must haunt my being?
Quick! Get Miku!
Chris and Maria gives you gifts, Tsubasa gives you a sword, DMJii gives you cake, and Hibiki gives you love.
It’s 100% pure and innocent!

I’m talking about the waifu of Miku. The one with the charm point. THE ONE THAT HAVE THE DETERMINATION TO FIST!!!
Yes... but wait... there’s one person missing... the most important character in Symphogear....
Also, here’s some Carol/Elfnein art:

The DMJii version:
And the Maria version:
Found the Chris version!

The wives in their super forms!
Two Biki, one Miku.
YES!!!
Black Gungnir Hibiki!
The chad.
Fun fact! Her VA sang the first OP of Magic Knight Rayearth.
Ogawa trained her well.
Dess
Uhm... Chris's  Zenbus are that big.
Can she unbutton the jacket to show Miku the goods?
Mommaria Enjoyer left the chat.
S1 and G have the best movie posters.
Where’s the GX, AXZ, and XV posters?!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXiNPWoOcr4&ab_channel=JobbytheHong-Topic
Don't let Jobby know about this.
YES!!!
(Griefs in Sad Chris fangirl noises)
Don't question it!
~~It's Tsubasa's bacon~~
Yes
Yep, it's that scene...
~~Miku: Hibiki!!! Sit on me!!!~~
Tsubasa nosebleeds... RIP.
Why is there wholesome art of topdad?
No wonder why her VA is not a Precure yet... otherwise the fanartists will go crazy!
That’s Kirika as a Precure!
Miku and Chris are vibin’
Berserk mode for the other girls... HOW IS THIS POSSIBLE?!
Beautiful!
The gear girls as children!
Best girl is best ranger of Kirameger?! Yes!
Did Tsubasa killed the FIS trio with her cooking?!
Genderbent Tsubasa and Ogawa... yes.
Badass Kirika!
I forgot the fan part.
Jake the Long Haired Kiri Fan.
This is still cool art: https://twitter.com/wasabi0143/status/1518942557081808897?t=kU6FRjkxS1UTEK7fWMf8gw&s=09
~~Also... where's the art of Kirika as Cure Finale?!~~
Yeah, Kirika has the best outfits<:KirikaSalute:620069889838809089>
When Bnnuy is either kidnapped or dead.
Long hair Kirika!
Even more edgy than before!
Man, this looks even more like a shoujo anime!
I... like the proto designs, but the designs we got are better.
Pictured: Rui and Hibiki.
Long hair Kirika!
Kirika is a ferret!
Bnnuy.
Quick, hide in Maria's boobs!
Giant MILF.
Mermaid Maria.
Maria is stronk!
Yes, yes you did.
Yeah...
So is pixiv is safer?
AH! This is cool!
Weasel, dess!<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
THANK YOU!!!
But who has the best drip?!
Genjuro's now thicc!
🍌
Maria's happy, she's having liquid pride!
ICE CREAM!!!
Okay, now that’s badass!
This is… an interesting gear swap.
Chris did the Genjuro summoning ritual.
Symphogear is a Kamen Rider anime before Fuuto PI existed.
(Ceased to exist)
And recipes don't go haywire.
Swedish Chef!
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Momotaros must possess Top-Dad to make him good.
Ah! Now this is what I’m waiting for!
Ah, the love of the lesbians, I love Symphogear.
Jake the Long Hair Kirika Fan.
This is the canon ending!
Well, Miku is well fed for the month/year.
It’s prefect!!!<:HibikiGay:670494484701773845>
YES!
PEPSI MAN!!!
YES!!!
Rare S1 Chris!
Bang!
Sailor Moon in Symphogear Server?! OH MAH GAWD!!!
I have no comment.
I want to eat a Boston Creme doughnut now!
GUNGNIR DATTO?!

So which is the most revealing?
In fact… where’s the art of Kanade’s updated gear?
https://tenor.com/view/everybody-cartoon-animaniacs-goodnight-warner-gif-12897151
So the more you exposed yourself, the more you become powerful…
Yes.
Shirtless Genjuro is a snack!
And wholesome!
This is cute!
Hibiki‘s mind is empty.
Miku... I don't want to judge her body, otherwise Hibiki will go after me!
This is what happens in the Decepticon base on a daily basis.
<@1024907864638230599>
Maybe Maria?
Uh oh…
Oh no, what happened here?
Doctor Maria.
But wouldn’t that cost your soul?

Succubus Kanade!
Now Chris is a Succubus?! Time to sell my soul!!!
Succubus Biki!
Wolf Biki!
The Christmasgears defrosted just in time!
Look, any Tsubasa ship is good!
Jake. exe has stopped working
This is epic!

Oh…
So... now what?
Oof!
Yeah... and besides, this server is giving me all of the good art!
Man, this server is why I’m glad DeviantArt is going to die.
Collect them all!
Gear teddies!
DID YOU SUMMON ME?!
And meat in her charm point!
Swedish Chef vs the Gear users.
Swedish Chef!
Lady Samurai Kirika!
DESS!!!
You mean charm point.
Futari wa Symphogear!
But what are the chances of that happening?
Huh?
God, if Twitter goes down, this we’ll be very silent.
But Chris…🤤
This is sick!
Yeah, November 20th is the big day.
Maia… why?!
It is the child.
Nana wills this!
I see what they did there!
CHARM POINT!!!
Please Das! My dong won’t expand any further!
I mean, no wonder why she’s the most beloved character of Gear.
But S1 X-Drive Ichaivel… no.
I don’t get the XV design. Too complicated.
S1 Chris!
Kanade needs bigger boobs.

God, this reminds me of Barbie as the Princess and Pauper.
Maria as Megatron… NICE!!!
Where it is?!
HUH?!

Chris-tmas.
Oh no.
Chris-tmas.
Legit, we need Hibiki and Kanade(from Suite Precure) to weld both versions of Gungnir!
I can’t see the pics.
I’m a Tokyo Mew Mew fan, and this is good!
Because Chiyo-chichi is evil. He's a Custodian.
Anpan.
I mean… Genjuro has the same VA as Ryoma, of course he would teach Hibiki how to form the Getter Robo!
Bnuuy!
AKA, a Jojo.
Uh, the horse is a him.
Bnuuy.


Is that HEATS and Realize playing in the background?
Bnuuy Maria!
Uhm, what’s going on?
Nevermind, they are still broken.
Yay!
But why it went out a few times before?
Has this happened before?
Huh, the tweet is not showing.
I have seen enough DeviantArt to know where this is going…
THICC GETTER ROBO!
Okay, I trust him and Momotaros!
But Top Dad has the same VA as Stupid Hair... and I won't trust him with Tsubasa.
Eva and Symphogear... I don't like where this is going...
What do you mean almost?
https://twitter.com/dengungnir/status/1508833206086553604?s=46&t=oibqteop2m7xhs37H1P8PQ
What, this isn’t the Hibiki and Kanade I know of… isn’t Kanade supposed to be dead?!
It’s Hero Time!
Neo-Zeon Maria.
Lelouch is Tuxedo Mask... yes!
She's a sweetheart!
Fumofu!
Yes!!! But where’s the Bonta-kun?!
Need more Gundam 00 and FMP art here!!!
Yos! I wanted FMP Fumofu, and they’re so cute!
The destroyer of war.
Cue giant Genjuro!
For Leiji Matsumoto:
Then go and re-watch it! It’s a classic in anime for a good reason!
Yo, any fans of Azumanga Daioh here?
Symphogear binge watch.
<:GenjuroThumbsUp:336657189475188740>
Toei took some of that magic mushrooms.
Haha, very funny!
Huh, I finished AXZ just now.
Oh, a Precure fan!
Oh, a CLANNAD fan!
My list: Symphogear, Azumanga Daioh, Cells At Work, 90s Sailor Moon, and Tokyo Mew Mew.
Oh! And Cells at Work and 90s Sailor Moon!
(yes, I'm limited in anime... help)
For me... Azumanga Daioh, Tokyo Mew Mew, and Symphogear.
It’s Nana Mizuki! Cause her voice is stunning!
<:ChrisPray:672578403156885504>
This ain’t Azumanga Daioh... THEY RIPPED IT OFF!!!
Next up: Shirabe, Maria, Best Girl AKA Chris(Chris-chan’s needs to be a Precure)
KNEW THAT KIRI-CHAN WILL BECOME A PRECURE<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720> !!!
Hibiki Tachibana approved!
Symphogear is an Idol anime... okay...
Hi Yuki Matsuoka AKA Osaka.
Like Azumanga Daioh<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
JC Staff, and no Azumanga Daioh... DISAPPOINTED!!!
But it got a trailer ~
Tokyo Mew Mew got a reboot!
So this happened: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz34Knus4j0
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874> <:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874> <:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>

All is right with the world!
Welp, even Toei is preventing Miku from being on the same level as Hibiki...<:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
Even Hibiki’s affected?! Shem-ha caused this!
And her VA is Miku's VA.<:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
Poor Miku...<:MikuSad:336657015961026560> <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
So true... we shall mourn her death by making fanart of the Gear girls as Mew Mew.
Hi Chirs-Chan!
When the Tokyo Mew Mew dub is better than the Smile Precure dub.

<:FudouEyes:672846284725682195>
This is going to rival Symphogear as best yuri action anime.
Speaking about Revue Starlight... I watched Ep 1... and I’m hooked!
Good!
Welp, I’m watching Revue Starlight rn!
Splash Mountain: the ride where people they to out do the other by taking bizarre photos!
AZUMANGA DAIOH!!!
<:MikuDelete:661660028410920990>
Man, the new Transformers anime looks weird...
Symphogear fans in a nutshell.
Yeah, but now have an army of other anime fans who want their anime to be released in America!
Nothing will be perfect. And we have to accept that. You're delusional if you want only perfection. That's not how the world works.
Yep. We know it can be better, but we just have to love what we got, flaws and all.
Yes. If you hate something, then go write you own fanfiction instead of bashing the creators.
Yeah, and with GX's... topdaddy issues, and AXZ's underutilized everything, it made XV suffer a lot.
Yeah, S1 and G are the peak of Symphogear, It's just that Katsumi Ono likely went overboard with the action and lost sight on the character interactions.
Since this is Hibiki month... : https://twitter.com/cure_eden/status/1565286635264086017?s=21&t=FHJiOJcQS8eFy5pWnxNZ4g
Watching Code Geass rn.
Yeah... sadly, they're not as good as in the past.
Discotek are gods!: https://twitter.com/discotekmedia/status/1588600414290595840?s=46&t=l7yRMQvkTO5xxQwZSiUAww
Go Princess Precure.
I did it, I gone to the Precure rabbit hole.
But what about Fuwa?
Say… what’s your opinion on Star Twinkle?
And I’m currently watching it!
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
Sadly no Chris as a Cure… DISAPPOINTED!!!
Oh I know… I’ll rather watch GX again than that.
Shouta Aoi, what gender are you?!
Yeah… but Prunce is GOAT.
Okay, the 1973 Getter Robo anime is good.  (only 5 episodes into it.)
Watching Nadesico rn.
LOL!
Imagine those three mechs in XV13.
With no Gundam Strike Freedom, Getter Robo, and Mazinger Z, they can't fight Shem-ha.
In fact, the Symphogear creators did massive de-buffs to Kira, Ryoma, and Koji.
Yeah... Genjuro has the same VA as Ryoma.
I guess we just saw Genjuro use 1/1000 of his max strength. I'm afraid of Genjuro showing Biki all of Getter Robo
YES!!!
Or the Rebuild Eva movies.
Yeah… Cross Ange is one of the many shows that got better writing thanks to SRW. I honestly prefer that version of the story compared to the anime ||Spoilers for V, Topdad gets roasted by every single woman in the cast of SRW V||
That’s explains so much.
I mean… the main villain is Topdad.
Like, how bad is Cross Ange?
Might want to watch that anime… how bad could it be?
Yeah... Tusk is just innocent, and wants the best from his girlfriend.
Yeah... Cross Ange does have some dark elements, but it's a show that kinda... yeah...
Watching Gaogaigar, and now I realized that Taiga is prototype Genjuro.
Yeah... even though the games are still awesome, they are getting lazy in the modern era (planning to play V next)
This makes Getter Robo Armageddon look like a seventies show.
And Maria and Miku are in that show!
Nana wills that.
Yes.
Like, at least instrumental versions of the girls’ songs, but that’s it.
Don’t worry, they’ll not feature the actual songs.
(I don’t think SSSS Gridman is a mecha anime, but that got into a SRW game)
True, as long as you have some massive sci-fi elements, you’re fair game in a SRW.
Ignoring the dozens of mecha references in the attacks, and even Ryoma having the same VA as Genjuro!
Yeah… like, imagine if Symphogear is in a SRW game… my problems with XV will be solved and I’ll be satisfied with the end product.
The more I think about it… SRW managed to get rid of the more problematic elements of the series featured in the games. Most famous being how they fixed Nadesico: Prince of Darkness
Tusk is just a good boi.
And hey, maybe Embryo is a Custodian.
Top Dad bets Stupid Hair.
I mean... Hilda and Ange are Nanoha and Fate!
DANG YOU CANADA!!! WHY YOU’RE BETTER THAN AMERICA?!
I think the issue with Cross Ange is that it has some… moments of ewww, but if your survive that, it’s really complex.
Yes!
True. Plus the world Embryo made has that Isekai feel to it.
Tusk saved the world!
Yeah, that’s Embyro in a nutshell.
I have the thought that Cross Ange is a meta-commentary of modern isekai with Embryo (ewww)
True!
Me with Embryo.
Yeah, plus the backstory of the Ideon’s creation is fascinating.
God! Thank god it’s not in the recent games.
Yeah… and Alpha 3’s bad ending is the Ideon ending. I’m not kidding.
Heck, the Eva movies mirrored the Ideon movies
True. Though End of Eva has more connections to Be Invoked.
Yeah, Ideon needed to happened. Its ending is probably the most powerful and thought provoking one in anime because if tells us that if we don’t find a want to end conflict, then the Ide will reset everything. And the sad this is… the Ide will continue overloading.
It makes Tsubasa’s suffering look tame.
About Ideon?
So, who knows of Ideon?
Yep! A really good Precure series!
And that game has the ending of Ideon.
Is this Alpha 3?
Again, thank good it’s not in a recent SRW game.
Yeah. I think we can establish that SRW did the Destiny cast well.
Yeah… SEED is a lot better. Though SRW fixed that.
So Ogawa is scary? This is before the ninja magic.
He's the true villain of Pokemon.
But still… why Top Dad and Stupid Hair of all people?!
Tetsuya has the same VA as Stupid Hair and Top Dad… WHY?!
You gotta Just Communication (sorry for the pun)
Watching Gundam 00 rn.
~~ I know, but I need to respect his legacy~~
And I might solo a stage in V with the Yamato.
Yeah...
God, me playing SRW V with Space Battleship Yamato in it is too timely.
The legend is dead.
https://twitter.com/livedoornews/status/1627493287358767104?t=hjDPcOjBDiZhj84ayR1IbQ&s=19
Plus the two anime shared Mitsuo Fukuda as part of the staff.
True. It might look like a fanservice mecha anime, but it's really deep. I think one review of it compared it to Gundam SEED.
Yeah, also SRW V does have the story there... just so I can see Ryoma punch Embryo's balls!
Also, should I watch Cross Ange?
True! It's just the most honest show ever.
G Gundam is a meme, and I love it.
So no restrictions means no money... that makes sense!
Huh?
God! Why is everyone wanting to lay off workers?!
Unfortunately. Many side characters in those games don’t get the goods.
Top Dad is both Embryo and Rau, and his enemies are Ogawa and Tsubasa.
Thank you SRW for saving her and the rest of SEED Destiny.
Yeah, SEED felt like a modernized version of 0079.
I mean… most of its issues come from a head writer who didn’t like cooking. (No, I’m serious!)
Okay y’all, how bad is SEED Destiny and Cross Ange?
Yeah, it’s like Ideon, but worse.
Very nice!
