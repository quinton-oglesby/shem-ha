They paid off everyone into thinking they are cool as a whole
Weirdo fursuit behavior imo but oh well
But yeah that's trash
I thought the show was getting taken off the air
Sure doesn't
Just gives me another reason to dislike ppl in suits
Has zero to do with claiming sesame street is being cancelled

not like I see too many shounen only's that actually care about Chanbara in the first place
so them not knowing about wakashudo is to be expected
of course most of these shounen onlies think the capital of japan is Konoha
they did not care for them facts
<:sabu:469567499864637458>
so i gave them a history lesson and pretty much let them know that yusuke might have been taking the d
same group was always posting anti-gay stuff
i remember all these shounen fans in this one black anime group were foaming at the mouth over that Yusuke
why i see stupid stuff in the black community with all the anti-gay nonsense.   A bunch of ppl following some puritan culture from their oppressors is something else
no offense to anyone
nvm i take that back, religion
racism the original covid
and influence other cultures
these ppl influence each other
it's all connected
<:DaidaSnapped:918807721434808342>

still laughing at that love lab episode

lol that emote name
my bad
original message was supposed to say they ARENT having a whole blackface get together for the holidays
sure isn't
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zwarte_Piet
or whatever that is lol, i think its just christmas in the netherlands
Its funny as racist as america is they aren't still having an entire holiday dedicated to blackface
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leopold_II_of_Belgium
https://www.edpost.com/stories/the-suffragettes-were-not-allies-to-black-women-they-were-racist
idk, its not like it was just them doing awful stuff
I remember my father telling me stories of them threatening him because he was one of the first black kids to be on the little league team
https://allthatsinteresting.com/anti-civil-rights-movement-gallery
People tend to think because they see black and white pictures or footage that it was so long ago.   But a lot of those ppl that you see are still alive
I think it might be on netflix or prime
<@411556790925393921>  watch "i am not your negro"
I still remember how they raised the taxes on all those ppl by Singer Island so they could get rid of all the black ppl and build condos on where their neighborhood use to be

isn't a lot of that macross stuff kinda big?

the subs were right but then later on the subs were totally dubtitles a few episodes later
watched bastard! episode 1 on netflix and not even 10 mins in they had stuff like the dub stating that dark schneider was using whatever whatever magic instead of the literal creation magic he used to CREATE his clothes
so many scenes of characters talking with no voice work laid over or characters not talking with random voice being put in
was watching wakfu season 1 in english on netflix
https://tenor.com/view/not-getting-the-joke-dog-throw-joke-you-gif-5205878
looks like an episode of Occultic;Nine
which was a cute show and very informative
https://tenor.com/view/dagashi-kashi-anime-dancing-gif-23097203
its written by the same person that did dagashi kashi or however you spell it
What is good about it?
What I am wondering
link
<:sabu:469567499864637458>
any recommendations?
but anyways i need to find me something good this season that is light hearted
a land where girls get thrown into cement to get rid of the evidence
but ppl pretend japan is this magical land
too busy trying to sell blurays to degenerates that are the main reason women have to ride in separate cars on the train
really the industry itself is pretty stagnant
lol what a joke

except when he tried to make a manga without plagiarizing ppl and it flopped
just like kishimoto
but the anime industry rewards ppl like him
jun maeda is a hack honestly
or naruto
like ppl that think soulless dreck like angel beats is peak fiction
a bunch of weirdos that have no life experience writing crap for other weirdos
reminds me of what miyazaki said
related

spreeding is now the new term for whatever it is doing

were you asking me?
https://tenor.com/view/destiny-takt-op-good-bye-gif-24216010

its weird how its just now becoming a thing though
so who was the first?
but the first character I remember with that is Stocking
both in anime and in the music industry overseas
i see its becoming a trend
https://tenor.com/view/healer-girl-anime-teehee-kana-fujii-gif-25363405
https://tenor.com/view/healer-girl-reimi-itsushiro-smug-grin-anime-girl-gif-25472597
like this
i am talking about peekaboo highlights
nope i am not talking about tone or shading
was stocking the first character to have hair like this?
question
anyways
dont worry, even if tomino didnt say it, barbie still loses

That song is baller
actually i take that back but that hand reminds me of something
alchemist iirc
Etrian Odyssey pugilist and the other class combined is what the mc looks like imo
so your typical shounen lol
here
https://pilotmanga.com/chapter/clock-striker/01-6/
there you go
its just a pic and a blerb and we are getting these full analysis where as if it wasn't saying what its saying and having a black mc it would just be met with hype
which is my point
these ppl don't even realize that not all shounen is about fighting
same as a lot of casual fans
for better or worse
welp from my understanding a lot of casual black anime fans love shounen
i am thinking this person is trying to appeal to black manga fans specifically
i am just tired
like seeing black cosplayers being constantly attacked for simply participating in something they like
it's hard for me to take stuff in good faith because as a black person seeing ppl come out the woodwork to "critique" anything black related when they would never do the same if it wasn't black orientated is the norm
funny how whenever someone with dark skin is involved there is always this kind of negative nitpicking
welp just support it and hope for the best

i mean pretty much lol

https://otakumode.com/news/62a85b6b9ba0c4001ef33520/Detective-Conan-The-Culprit-Hanzawa-Confirms-October-Premiere!
Yeah anyway
📠
I had posted the whole show on Facebook a few years back before I had to delete my og account
Peak fiction right there
https://youtu.be/6mERS8UM12c
Show was a crack induced fever dream
Then again so was Sega hard girls
That shit was hilarious
<:sabu:469567499864637458>
Nevermind it was Ixion saga
Something dx?
Damn what was the other Isekai anime  where everything was a console war reference?
Would be nice if we could get some art with him and the Seha girls
Since I was a Sega kid
I feel like the uncle from ojisan isekai
I miss the real arcade scene but then again I don't miss the second hand smoke
Manga was a giant nostalgia bomb
But I love the manga so I looked past it
And dated
It's ugly af
Naw
Crazy how we almost didn't get it
That cgi was cringey but serviceable
Hsg deserved better imo
https://youtu.be/DMKX9ETeJOw
https://youtu.be/w_sfQy9AUfQ
Some have them in their op
There a ton of animes that have game footage
<:kaz_lol:400748773355159552>

speaking of bad fandoms I use to think symphogear had a good one that wasn't toxic but I am slowly being proven wrong
unless i am blind
https://www.soundcadencestudios.com/portfolio
I don't see anything about the actual cast on this site at all
hoping for the best so it can get some new fans interested
anywho i cant wait to see what that gunbuster dub is like
name is making sense now
cool
the goku vs stuff
thats all started with toonami
and worthless nonsense like your average naruto fan claiming that health itachi solos existence
talking about nanolemonade
the only weirdos that i see being toxic or again the shounen weirdos that spend all day arguing power levels
hell i know gunpla ppl that dont even watch or care about gundam at all
as i dont really see too many actual gundam fans that arent into gunpla tbh
this is mostly the ppl I am talking about
maybe its a stand user thing
idk buddy
love this prommo
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TfadJj4d5K4
anyways
sounds more and more like a YOU problem tbh
that being said toonami was still pretty cool
toonami brought in a lot of lames
yeah that's more a toonami thing than gundam imo
especially the female fans
gundam fans did a lot for anime period
yeah i will give you that one
for a series that is been around since 79
yeah that is like waaaaay later
now they argue all day like children
they were cool with me
before all the naruto weirdos kept trolling them, same with dragon ball fans
like wan piss fans
they use to be cool but then again so did a lot of anime fandoms
dope
kinda hype for gunbuster, was there any word for when that is coming out?
Also Turn A, but not many more actual Gundams besides maybe the 00 sky
i am a fan of the pale rider personally
this is dope
so regal

breh this really not gonna animate for us huh?
https://64.media.tumblr.com/8ff5423f52752ba8978bf87d4a1ae357/tumblr_ngybptBtYK1rjxyrgo3_400.gifv
which is all I care about when it comes to my shiny robots
as far as looks go
best ms in gundam too me arent the gundams anyways
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3pOIDaF1Dw&ab_channel=Diregentleman
i think stan lee said it best
which is why i just troll
now you get it
anyways trash gundam series aside i guess my chances of finding who is doing Noriko's voice is nil until after otakon huh
instead of just saying "what do you want me to do orga"
also the pilot actually has personality
i think the gusion looks cooler
ball > barbie
wait that is probably not fair
windmill gundam > barbie
<:mjlol:662489234510446634>
pack your bags fight is over
thow some napalm on barbie and then shoot it with beam weapons
sure bud
full on forest diego mode
cool beans, i can't imagine think that literal paint makes a ms invincible but here we are
god what a terrible design choice that was
i wonder how much nanolemonade barbie has on that exposed midrift
was more a power suit kind of guy like bubble gum crisis
I have a soft spot for robo that is for sure
Like besides valkeries I wasnt really into mecha that much back in the 90's until I was shown gunbuster and giant robo
i think i like the captain earth mecha because it kinda resembles Gunbuster
https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51216516077_7b5d57b27a_o.jpg
can't remember the name of the main one with those weird shoulders but I do remember liking the main unit from Captain Earth
or star driver
but then again they are into all those five star story types of mecha like the ones from ditf
can't believe my friend didnt like the Silhouette knights
reminds me of the ikaruga
will for sure check it out ty
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HcYEzCPHaA
oh jeez i had forgotten to share this from earlier
funny we are on this episode of wakfu with frida in her fogger mech or whatever it is
https://tenor.com/view/mofette-gif-25034853
guess i will check it out after I get done watching wakfu with the kiddo
if its kawamori then i guess i aint got a choice
oh snap
is the person who designed those suits the same person that did majestic prince?
my watch list too long
I need to check that out
man that fight between the major and that tank is still one of the best things I have ever seen in anime
lol breh
they remind me of Bonaparte from Tank police
cool
like 86 and gits?
how do y'all feel about spider mechs?
<:uuuh:695061152505397340>
the lady from aquarion?
there is another way to writer reika besides reika?
<:eek:468856291910221834>
k

<:DeshaLaugh:927868930586980382>
The enemy T-Posing hard af right now
They can teleport the mc but got children starving in the streets apparently, whole budget going into their Kumdam
The Reika in this almost as trash as the one from Gantz
like bro dedaz just caught an animal that was squeeking and just ate it while it was still alive
like why these ppl clearly rich but everyone else is eating raw rat?
i thought it was cgi rice crispies
yo that's what that was?
https://tenor.com/view/shinya-shinyahiragi-wave-anime-wave-gif-21786124
just like the cgi, like they had this random few seconds of the mc entering the cockpit and they made him cgi for some strange reason and it was super jarring
this animation is all over the place
wheel chair suiginto is also blind
i can clearly imagine her decendants having a habsburg jaw
um this princess is a bit odd
https://thumbs.gfycat.com/CornyPitifulGoa-max-1mb.gif
oh naw the princess just threw out the classic line
oic old girl is in a wheel chair
<:sabu:469567499864637458>
breh did these randoms just get off when they did their first gattai sequence
i laughed when buddy bit the princess
show looks pretty decent for its age cgi-wise
watching aquarion <@99695384296701952> and the first thing i notice is this one girl that reminds me of suiginto from rozen maiden lol
someone tell them to rescue precure and get a dub for that
license rescue huh
i wonder if they even can
don't hate me for saying this but it would have been nice if they added color to the final episode
yup just saw it ty
<:eek:468856291910221834>
<@219228299115757588> Does it mention the cast for Gunbuster

so i can like level up revy?
is it an actual rpg?
doesn't look like it belongs on a christian server
lol wut am i looking at?
https://imgur.com/a/Xm9mYCW
not really

anyways this is the only chainsaw related anime/manga thing I care about at the moment
some female character that stinks
idk
and it has chainsaws
all i know is there is a character that apparently smells bad or something
seems pretty popular
Sorry
i just x'd out the tab after that
and then right after that he is alive again
yeah buddy got sliced up and put in a dumpster for i guess shock value
what is a pico?
Idk probably chapter one
<:DaidaSnapped:918807721434808342>
Also what am I looking at here
I read up to the part where the mc dies and comes back to life
<:DeshaLaugh:927868930586980382>
how did i know it would be GATE
loooooooooooooooool
now i want to know what show/series really is the worst offender when it comes to imperialism
https://cdn.donmai.us/sample/5f/0a/__grandis_granva_fushigi_no_umi_no_nadia_drawn_by_obui__sample-5f0ac0208feb800c5639c638a20cc185.jpg
I just like me some Grandis
gloval in the yamato
yeah i can see that lol
lol idk, still laughing at that awful Venom movie that everyone love where venom and the other symbiotes all have english names and speak english
or it could just be convenient writing
they might as well say its imperialism every time they make aliens speak perfect japanese with no explanation
https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E32L8dCWYAcmUvL?format=jpg&name=medium
that was gross an unnecessary
i think the only thing that really irked me about nadia is that whole stuff with samson and whats her face
it was a dope as hell version of the nautilus even if it was just a whole callback
or whatever his name is in the japanese version
i mean the captain is literally captain avatar wasn't he lol
whole convo is giving me Gate flashbacks
hrm is there any imperialism in Nadia?
now you are hard pressed to find ppl that even know what an ova is
that prebubble era when they were just making anything into an ova
<a:oof:813802833693638657>

hold up i saw this on the actual article
then again i am black so i actually say that <:mjlol:662489234510446634>
i just noticed that
<:stfunigga:480386406716538880>

naruto could never

speaking of

Why I am hesitant to watch anymore

Like what do they really even have besides waifu helicopters
Gate be like, have these std ridden elves and 1000 year old lolis with our pro Nippon bs so it will go down easier
I don't remember that one piece character, is she new

breh
Best part of this is oda having great trans characters being above that terf
<a:confusedmorty:467319724590497792>
wait so that wasn't a one piece character
I'll give it a few episodes like I did jjk before I drop it maybe
Welp the animation might get me to watch
Interesting how all these mappa stans have never actually witnessed peak mappa
It's just really sad at this point
never fails
hilarious how you say anything bad about naruto, all of a sudden wan piss gets mentioned
https://tenor.com/view/symphogear-car-ninja-art-shadow-clone-shinji-ogawa-gif-25316168
Ogawa > all of naruto
<:smoothbrain:877300048705237002>
so weird how they try and push a show on to new ppl but then tell them to skip 40% of it
good because naruto is trash and not worth watching
new weebs watch naruto because naruto fans force it upon them like some sort of rite of passage
Of course weebs think konoha is the capital of "Japan" in the first place
Koshien is pretty freaking serious tbh
<:jerrybruh:719918500130455694>
there is a buzz lightyear anime?
And I am like this is k-On with guns I don't think it was ever meant to be realistic
Someone was complaining about that Lycoris animes last episode with it not being realistic enough or something
Except for a scene where I guess they were playing in VR or something maybe it was a video game I don't know
I watched four episodes of that show and can't remember anything about it
Only thing that they actually did that was good was piss off the one piece fans enough for them to start crapping on them in retaliation which is hilarious.
Such weird and toxic fandom
I used to see all these random Sakura hate threads on Facebook almost every day in non-Naruto groups
<:sabu:469567499864637458>
I mean if I was fixated on it that would be my classroom
It just gets posted a lot on Facebook
Why wouldn't I be ok?
Like ma'am I just want to learn how to read Idgaf about your cringe cartoon where the teacher shoves 3 knuckles into his student
Meanwhile Naruto fans be like
https://www.tiktok.com/@enrico_956/video/7125910847217634606
too bad it gets drowned out by the average rabid shounen junkie
also its actually just a funny and cute/wholesome show
probably some of the best sakuga I have seen in the last few years, besides fate series
you ever watch Mob Psycho 100?

lucky for me I had flashbacks of the first anime
I remember some weirdo weeb tryna get me to watch this muvluv drek

Please guys, my tanuki needs tomatoes

no the russian va is actually russian

akiba maid war > lycoris whatever coil
bet they would lose their collective shit if they remade Violence Jack or Md Geist
anime community in general seems to be going for more edgy stories

just gonna ignore muvluv from now on
welp that was a waste of time
Decided against my better judgment to finally watch the new Muv Luv.  The first episode was actually dope.  Then again I said the same thing about the first episode of the garbage az Total Ecplipse and that was a full-on bait and switch.   This shit is pretty metal so far though.   Basically what I wanted from the first show which is just anime Starship Troopers.   Those outfits are still cringe

I am sure he did stuff for psikyo
Not sure if they ever did snk art
Two completely different artists
Midkima needs to be bumped off the list completely

kinda like having dante and virgil as protagonist where they are mad cheesy and edgy but its ok
like all ya'll gonna stand there and let this mfer moonwalk on you and then double tap you in the face because you were too entranced by his sick skillz
as silly as it is
I like the dope af gunkata stuff
but its okay nvm
i wanted to clarify so we didnt get ppl talking about character faces
I mean more along the lines of the actual mechanical design and mecha art as opposed to character art
What Mecha manga has the best art to y'all?

coffin princess
what is it called?  arknights?
that lycoris recoil should have been like that too.   That being said I am enjoying the new girls with guns show a lot more than I did recoil even if I have never played the game related to it
It never looks or feels flat
I like how almost every scene in bocchi is some kind of cool perspective shot.   Kubo would probably stroke out if he watched an episode
when the first thing I did was look up studio montage since I never heard of them
not sure why I got arknights associated with cygames
and then came back with soul eater not!
Back on topic, Soul Eater had that terrible anime ending
oh and Takt op. even though that at least looked nice
Kills me how all these bandwagon mappa fans act like they can do no wrong when Sacred beast and Granblue saga s2 exist
not as bad as what they did with To the Abandoned Sacred Beasts where they just decide to just remove all the mystery of the manga
what a waste of a great manga
recently a show that screwed the pooch for me was Promised neverland s 2
11/10
saw that in 3d at the theatre

5th place is perfect for mid

<:hAha:956761665070845972>
i wonder if these characters looking like characters from other shows is on purpose or do i just watch too much anime
The little lies we all tell is cute
Even the furries from the later shows had more personality
The original build divers would have been so much better with out  reiji
Reiji really was barely even a person and more of an excuse for sei to explain Gundam stuff to.  Sekai was a better character in every way
<:fuckinglol:663524273796808732>
I mean it's in the name of the show
Was really corny not having the actual builder be the person fighting
Was it ever explained where or why or how reiji shows up?  Why wasn't sei the actual person participating?


other reason ppl watched
<a:aPES_CoolClap:655414093045563392>

best part of build divers is this
Did rinko ever dress up as sailor moon in the og build fighters?
did they ever even mention reiji again in the other series or did he cease to exist like the flimsy plot device that he was
would have been so much better if she was more of a die hard gundam fan that was the person that got her son into the fandom
kinda like an alien kid with zero interest in robots and gundam teleporting to earth to randomly get caught up in gundam battles
her barely knowing anything about the show that she literally works at/co-owns was weird
Its funny how when ppl bring up build fighters its almost always about rinko.  Should have skipped the random alien kid and put more of her in the show
https://twitter.com/fridge_duty/status/1592137146705797120?s=61&t=uB5zAM8mHPowEQJztyTlVg
yeah it is no fun
all the perspective stuff is just fun to see period

The op for Psychic Princess is better than this
ppl will sit here and tell me with a straight face this is good singing.   Wanting this dude to sing for every anime ever
https://youtu.be/OLKf8yLL-aY
I tried to listen to Ling Tosite Sigure and this dude just sings the exact same way in pretty much every song I listened to.
<:BebinUnamused:927862038477295687>
studio toei is animating frieren?
<:okbuddy:901285697523187732>
i dont understand how ppl like TK
dude literally whisper whines in every song with like no range

who is the studio animating it?
no she does something relevant/has enough screentime to warrant even being remember or no she is only on the list due to rampant fanboism?
so that is a no then?
Wouldn't mind seeing Amanda actually
i dont watch bleach so i gotta ask, does Ruchia or whatever her name is do anything relevant in the new episodes?  Wondering why she is staying on the top 10 list
I want to see my girl Ranko or best girl Fran
