"color me Akira"...

<@481518367845646346> , definitely improvement!!
What about...
Agree
^
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
<:NotLikeFist:689188869974786133>
So I'm guessing that means no Akira...
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
But I'm still routing for an Akira
Your cause is just, rad
Exactly
He has some serious meme potential.
And actually seriously, could we have an Akira emote?
<:ShirabePlease:724034356192215081>
I mean, fair
Actually, <@203444794737950720> , I have a question / request for you, too. Any way you could work your magic to create a "Dmji Peek" emote?
Sorry about the wall of text, but that's my two cents. I'm more curious if others care or not
I can see it both ways, I guess.
I agree that the way emotes are organized now by character makes sense, but I personally struggle finding a <:ShirabeWarm:688187807075926038> after posting a <:KirikaWarm:688187760095658246>, which could just be resolved if I search "Warm" instead of looking through the "Kirika" section, then the "Shirabe" section.
On the other hand, I prefer using visual search 75% of the time because I wanna find the best looking emote for the situation.
*(minor query more than anything)*
Just a thought, can emotes that are meant to be used in pairs have names changed to appear side-by-side?
Mr hibiki's dad
Fair
Oh...
If I can source a good Akira, can it be considered in that case?

Xdu event

A role for Top Dad?! Why, that's a top idea!
I can think of a memorable character without a role...

i can't see any white in emote form on yours
plus, i got the lappy advantage
yours has a billion more edges, so it's tough
<:ShemhaOutrage:858490684758949919>
mfw matt made a better emote than me using his tiny phone from 2016
you're a much braver soul than i
looking real good tho!!

hmm

Oh good, Matt's working on the tougher one

<:MikuWorry:672908523495227432>
Blocked?
<:ShirabeWeep:701475635025019000>
Oh agreed, just a minor thing
Sorry, Armis. I can't tell your shit posts apart yet...
If Robin posted, we don't know now
Discord displays who's currently fronting
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:796600452585881650>
I will say one nice thing about pluralkit is we'd know 100% for sure which Armis member posted that
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:796600452585881650>
Actually, what is the point of the character roles (as opposed to the colors)? I know they exist, but they're not mentioned in <#448237561085952001> . Are they just there for flavor?
You could just link it and enter vc for anyone interested
There's no rule against someone linking to their twitch channel though, right?
Challenge accepted!
~~matt, we don't have any roles...~~
Oh. I don't care if other people have them, but I can't say I'd want one myself before knowing the options
People who aren't fans could also just not participate, correct?
<:dessturbing:632628396098191380>

In which case there would be no way to find entry...
What about a pinned message on r/symphogear then?
What's the advantage to making the server public?
I think it just depends on personal preference and the flow of the conversation. Aka, don't just dump random memes and stuff in <#336297387863703552> and peace out
<:ClarksonSmug:782332079559671809>
"Top Gear"
"Mel's House of Shirabe"
I already get bullied here for landlording, do you worst! <:DugSmug:942528130705395793>
suggestion: "ColorMeAkira" brown role (only half joking)
<:GokuDed:797610321778966528>
My time is at hand
<a:chrishake:659369733098962954>
Or maybe do it manually and add red like this emote:
If you get it with the subtle shake from the  scene, you can make it an animated emote, but at that size it might be too subtle
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
"17" is a pretty arbitrary character limit, and we have plenty of emotes that surpass it
Doubt
<:ButItWasMeRonaldio:869379256118030367>
I learned something today
<:TsubasaNote:689554460044820608>
Embarassing has two R's?
I personally like "guess I'll die..." as the shrug emote verbiage, but I'm assuming that's not much better
That's not where she goes...

C'mon, Kerrik, don't leave me in the dark
I guess, but "just a little bit" what?... Good?
Know what?
You ever wonder if that was the original idea, and they were like "nah, we need wholesome charm points!", so they changed MCs?
What's going on here?
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:782815928961335316>
Tell me how you really feel...

So hyrule warriors then...
Zelda is one of the more fun characters at least

Technology is dumb!
<:HibikiOneSecond:810326291336527882>
Other than the file extension
Is there a difference between a jpg and a jpeg?
<:HibikiWow:738172615453048912>
This tree bot is amazing, but I feel like that's really silly...
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:782815928961335316>
So... It doesn't work because of the 'e'?
The tree only likes pngs or something?
<:HibikiTsun:738234664656961556>
Fair points
<:HibikiSmile:801595348115259443>
<@505741920333463552> , you tag me for bikki stuff, I'm assuming you're also a fan?
Confirmed! The tree hates!!
Same source as above for those two images, btw
It just hates me...

Idk, the perspective is a bit weird
Or it's like a dress frill
I think it's lifting up in the back
Oh
*something something charm point?*
Yeah, idk what's going on in the back there

Her hair tips, I think
...Chris got a long neck
Considering Hibiki is wearing a ducky shirt, I'm guessing the "dress" is actually pajamas

I half agree with this. Her plan was to have the beam hit Miku, it just so happened the best way was dragging her in there herself.
Hibiki had no idea if the beam would heal her. We could say Miku knew it would because Ver told her, but he's a manipulative ass so who knew if it'd actually work. It's just another miracle.

True
Black gungnir was too cool for gear...
Way back, I was working on something. Without going too deep, I was pitting Tsubasa with double ~~heavenrend~~ against Maria with Airgetlam and Black Gungnir
Punch girls are good
I like it
<:MikuWhoa:670502684692054042>
Yeah, fair
Writing action is tough
I had the thought once before long ago
Dual wielding
Why isn't it?
This is the hand that will pierce the heavens!!
<:HibikiWow:738172615453048912>

Literally ended with a subjective opinion, but sure

...she's still my favorite though!!
Idk. Imo, her character progression and archetype really isn't that different from a Goku. ~~Hell, they're even both orange!!~~ With vast abundance of shounens, I don't know if she could stand with "the best" protags.
That's gonna be tough to say...

I say no use in worrying. Enjoy the noodles, and if you figure out who sent em, then thank em someday
Honestly, I think that's cool. No one sends me noodles...
Relatable
<:KirikaConcern:698939825386029186>
The delicious part wasn't a joke tho
Oh whoops
They're gonna be delicious
Srsly, it's just noodles
None that you know of!
Positives, right?
This discord, on the other hand... I like it!
Glad to hear. And relatable. I never understood social media in the past, but nowadays especially it just seems toxic.
That works
What do you prefer to be called, btw?
Haha! Yeah, that sounds like resume material.
Exactly
Live your best life how you want, that's all you gotta do
As a straight(ish) white(ish) male, I can't fully relate to what you're going through, but I can say that you don't have to prove yourself to that guy or anyone else.
Whoa
Aww
Agree
<@84811738653929472> , nah
Why?..........
Not in a while
I mean, I can see why they'd be frustrated for sure, but come on!!
Wtf?!
So in their terms, if you're not 100 percent straight, you're gay?
Oh......
I am become  confuse
Gay and lesbian are categorized separate?
Or third, I guess?
What are the three?
Mmm
Bisexual men?
Yeah, wut
I guess that's true
And that scares me...
But if the person was on life support, and I had to make the call, I don't think I'd hesitate
No, of course not
I can't speak to whether or not it's healthy, but I don't think it's entirely abnormal...
<@84811738653929472> , I thought about the question longer... I realized there is a small part of me that wishes a certain someone was dead...
Or cute anime girls
Look at puppies
> I think I'm slowly falling into a habit of looking at things that make me angry.
Don't do that...
> imma just shitpost on the internet
Do that and enjoy
Also thanks!
I can appreciate that outlook
(also, if my question is offensive, I apologise and can delete it, but I'm honestly curious)
So... Okay... Question: if one has a fictive, and there's awareness that it's a fictive, how does that work? Isn't there sort of a known reality break in there? Kind of like realizing you're dreaming? *(Not that that's equivalent, it's just the first thing I though of)*
That's annoying.
Vicariously?
I hope
It's gonna continue getting worse, but eventually it'll get better.
Good on ya!
I think you know this, but don't be like that guy
In life, I never knew what I wanted to be, just what I didn't want to be
Agreement
What kind of ass-hat experiments on their children?!
Wut
The world needs more good professors
Haha! You've got plenty of time, but v cool!
Ah shucks
Business stat, a physics lab and matrices (linear algebra)
It was okay. Do better than me.
Taught college for one year
Yeah
- an ex chill professor
Good luck, in that case
My friend did her thesis on the theraputic affects of DND (and roleplay in general), so I imagine there's quite a bit to discover
Ooh
Pretty sure that's a prereq...
But yeah, I agree with the circlejerk sentiment
Not the most internet savvy
Thank you
Dang! Grats!
Don't rub it in...
And you support yourself?
Really?
Maybe I'm dumb, but what does his tweet even mean?!
Good point. Higher education wasn't a necessity like it is nowadays.
Mmm...
And loans blow
Tuition blows
Oof
Isn't it still for CA residents?
I think college used to be significantly cheaper, too
H
Haha...
Hahaha!!
$12k/year barely gets you jack...
Even when I was making $40k-ish, I had a hard time saving up to move out.
> That's when people are at their most appealing.
Fact
Lol
> Like. Start off as friends
Easier said than done in today's age...
^ truth
^ truth
> But I literally hate both of these lol
What about a local board game club, or something of your interest?
Honestly, the best thing you can do for yourself is not be concerned *(easier said than done, trust me)*
Same
Wait, why?
> imagine invinting gamers, who are gaming to mostly escape reality, to go experience a reality that can kill you
I doubt those kids fully realize that though, which is the awful part
> meanwhile usa is likely to not get a second wave because everyone will die in the first
That's not untrue...
Idk if any poll is believable, though... Remember when Hillary was supposed to win by a landslide?
Heck! Maybe I should be coming to you for advice!
Haha! I like you gumption!
Yeah, and keep swiping
But you definitely don't need to pay to get matches, it'll just take a little.
Bumble, too
Well, they are
Fact
"like, he's Jewish, but he's not *Jewish*!!"
Yeah, both.
So much appreciated for your outlook
I will say that you guys talk to about this way more respectably and nonbiased than at my family gatherings

I'm from PA actually, it's thankfully not as awful here.
Holy heck!!!
If you're not interested, that's all there is to it
Also, thanks mei! Probably shoulda led with that!
Lebanon is apparently a very beautiful country.
Yeah, majority of my fam is state side, but there were some who got married and went back
Keep everyone in your thoughts and prayers though, fam.
Phew... Finally confirmed that my family over there is safe!
Still absolutely ridiculous...
When you think of it as 15% of Hiroshima... Yeah...
Oh shit!...
What're your thoughts?
I mean, probably 2750 tons of it?
Damn ^
Thanks. That's what it's about, right?
> Seriously it's scary to think how some people still don't know why it's an offensive term

Is "trick" the same? I've never heard that.
Wtf? Did they give a reason?
> So don't be a jerk!
It really is that simple...
> that's one thing I'm slightly worried about with becoming a vtuber/streamer: having people draw lewd fanart of me
Not to be weird, but that's kind of  a sign that you've made it big, right?
Or flattered?
Hmm... If I learned stranger were drawing pictures of me, I may also be weirded out
I guess, is it a good weird or a bad weird?
Agreed
Haha! Fair point!
They were gonna get hands!
I was thinking someone was straight up teasing you
Ahhh...
What do you mean by jokes about yourself?
<:YumiPoint:688429724103344164>
agreed
just see if there's anything you can do now
i mean, that's natural to feel guilty, but it's out of your hands
right... not my best kneejerk joke...
sorry
bad taste...
no
some of my best wingmen are women
^ yeah, wtf, big agree!
Fair
Why'd you give up sports?
Well, that's awesome I'm n itself at least!
Horny time is important, too...
Mmm...
Another question, and forgive my ignorance, but is it reversible?
Do you feel there's an actual risk of HRT running out?
Oof...
Mmm... Sort of, and heck!
Is it not "infinite"? Like, if you choose to forgo the surgery now, can't you at a later point?
Yeah, I don't think you need to worry about anything malicious at work (I hope), but I've had my stuff taken / thrown out when I forgot it someehete
Good luck, fam!
Very very understandable
FF
Is there a point where it stops, or do you need to keep going in forever?
F
Oof... How often does dilation need to occur?
Some numb nuts was like "I bet people want to watch this"
Yeah, but that's exactly it
...you don't want the answer to that...
Personally, whenever I have medical concern, I'll typically ask my aunt (nurse practitioner) first. She was a life saver (maybe literally) when I got gout and mrsa

Sex Ed at school was worthless, it was all about peer pressure for some reason...
Sex Ed at church, though!... Surprisingly detailed.
Big agree
<:YumiPoint:688429724103344164>
I mean, that. ^
But also, talking with someone else usually helps me a lot. When needed, I find shoulders better to cry on than just my bed.
I was gonna say, didn't cases already skyrocket with schools being open?
I mean, only as much as everyone else, so...
They seemed close-ish, but I wanna take a better look
...huh...
Football has fans in the stadium...
Some are side by side, but it looks like pockets
We guuch
Upon further inspection, they're not terribly close together
I was just surprised after seeing mlb and nba...
Stadium def isn't full though
This is all in harry potter?
Grass is always greener...

No, that'd be a bad

Hm...

You'll be fine Micha. It'll pass
I guess not
I feel like I would've remembered if it was obnoxiously loud
Aside from that it was fine
The biggest issue I had was being bored and restless
Do you know if they'll be able to play music or give you a sleep aid?
Ye
The place I went to was able to play me the lion king soundtrack
Honestly I don't remember
Kind of annoying

Idk about this. Some of my better friends are people I barely keep up with. That's just how our relationship works.
Time to vote for a third party!
Yes
Just don't vote for "deez nuts" or "harambe"...
Otherwise, we'll always be a two party system...
I mean, i completely understand that thought process. But if one honestly believe in "libertarian", that's how they should vote.
They're US citizens and now residents of a state, so there shouldn't be any restrictions
I believe so
> `probably also a lot of sexism too`
I wonder about that. I feel like there's also a lot people who'd vote Hillary just because she's a woman (though maybe less?)
~~also, just my best guess~~ <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
So shemmy is right, nepotism is really just a common thing. It's objectively gross, but that's just a part of the job market, and as someone who's benefited from it, I can't say shit...
Rad is also right though, Biden getting his son a job isn't really the problem, there's so much more to it.
My only issue with what was stated previously is the blame of a system for people's actions. If you establish communism, people will still find a way to use unethical means to benefit themselves.

Holy shit!... My brother just told me about this. Hiding the link because strong language, but the article is on Brazil president's stance on covid.

But, you won't!
Maybe irrational, but understandable. Wanting to not become an awful personakes a lot of sense
I've always defined "hate" as "wishing the worst on someone"
<:Zababies:672238628398956594>
This is exactly what I'm seeing. A lot of people I know would take their flu shots are worried on this because "we don't know the long term effects"
Keep in mind, with the timing crunch, the goal was to achieve 50% efficacy. Both vaccines are relatively good.
Me too
My brother (US) was in denmark for work once. He was over at a friend's for dinner. Before dinner,  with the friend's son (6ish), they walked to a park about a km away. On the way, the son asked his father in danish "is it true that Americans will drive this distance?" My brother wasn't 100% fluent, so after his friend translated, and he laughed and responded: "tell him yes, and that we'll usually stop for ice cream on the way"
But my question is, how many parents are going to download a firmware update on the mario lego?

I only count calories and protein. Veggies are my friend (usually) and help to add flavor and substance to a meal without weighing it down much, but I depend on lean meats a lot of times to help hit my macro goals... Tofu is okay, I guess.
<:BikkiThink:796558399117852712>
Dr. Armis, how much protein do you suggest a person eat and why? Google suggests 12% to 20%. I shoot personally shoot for about 40% in my current diet. I'm curious on your thoughts.
Both minimum and regular unemployment should be higher than what they are, though...
Something to note though: idk about other countries, but in the US, because of quarantine, unemployment wages went up by a whopping $600/week. That's a $30k salary jump from what it was, which alone is higher than minimum wage.
~~i might've been thinking of wooden straws~~

For or against, you can't just call it "child labor" and think people won't hate it instantly
Going in without knowing absolutely what career path you want can burn a hole in your pocket
I wouldn't say college is completely useful or a total scam, but it can absolutely be a waste of money
One of my buddies finally realized he didn't need a degree. He's basically as successful as I am, but with less debt.
Honestly, fair
Tbf, I didn't have a self finance course in highschool, college or grad school...
Honestly though, I don't have much to add. I only own one property and rent out the rooms, so discussion doesn't entirely apply to me (yet). As a landlord, the dream ~~is to cheat at minecraft~~ is to own multiple properties and live off the income from renters, but if system changes so that becomes no longer viable, then I'll adapt

I just hope a lot of people don't become instantly house poor as a result
I think that bubble's gonna pop around the end of this year / beginning of next
Keep in mind, they're also talking about the current housing market. A lot of things are more expensive simply because people have more money than ever and wanna spend it. They're buying houses, making improvements, and some things are scarce. It's supply and demand.
I thought pfizer reduced their claims to one week?

So eleven is a gendered number is Portuguese?
Huh...
Srsly?!
"one"
There's just no option?
So not like English where you can use they/them for individuals even
Mmm...
Ah, so like "they / them" in English
Would non-gendered usually default to "ele"?
F
Maybe. Or maybe it's that both prosecutors who knew the law and exactly what you stated and tried to flex it against a defendant that didn't know better.
It's strange. What he did is awful and completely reprehensible, but in my head it's kinda hard to connect those awful things to him. I remember him "Dr. Huxtable" and how he was represented in early Simpsons and Family Guy, but it almost seems like completely different people

I hate the thought of parents being bad parents...
Polio is fundamentally the same, but it add the element of an individual not necessarily choosing for themselves. So... I need to think on that more...
Oh, I've been talking about covid this whole time
It is a societal good. Many people have gotten the vaccine and numbers show society has benefitted... Why mandate it?
Maybe it is, it's not really my expertise... <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
Legally paying taxes isn't the same as "injecting poisons and 5g into my body", as I assume one would say. Forcing people to conform will propagate hate, further rebellion and may hurt the overall cause. Instead, provide facts, educate and influence people via your actions and hopefully they'll make those decisions on their own
Why isn't the other person vaccinated?
In their head, they're doing what's best for themselves and society...
I'm really not a fan of this. As much as I disagree with antivaxxers and their stance, I still believe they should be allowed to exercise their freedom of choice.
I think we all agree with that
...so not a child?
Devil's advocate: how old should a child to be able to decide to receive a vaccination?
To clarify, when I said "parent's responsibility", I meant for 2 year olds
That was my worry too. Reading the article, it seems to more about the stopping of encouraging kids and teenagers to get vaccinations. It specifically mentions covid, the flu and hpv, even so far as no longer offering flu shots at schools. I didn't see anything about the vaccinations infants get like polio or tb. At that point, it's the parent's responsibility anyway. So it's not as bad as the Twitter post may make it seem, but it's not good and sounds like a downward slope...

Buddy of mine moved to Arkansas. When asked how things were, he replied "indoors are indoors". Some people just prefer it that way.
We use it for management all the time
"left to persue other opportunities" is the politically correct phrasing for fired
My company, like a lot of places, is struggling to keep themselves at full employee capacity. We were just sent an email the base pay of all general manufacturing associates and entry level technicians is increasing, effective immediately. Hopefully, this is just the start of a positive trend throughout all other companies.
I thought zero already had the sigma virus
Just as long as we don't revert back to the point of overwhelmed hospitals...
I don't know much about the delta variant in the states other than "it's new, it's scary, and Florida is absolutely fucked". I don't think Texas's method is necessarily the worst, but I'm willing to bet it may be a bit too soon.
Sending sick children to school is believed in some circles to be a good thing. Get the young children exposed while they're young and can easily fight and build an immunity. Idk if that logic applies for a virus that can still affect adults and elderly, but it should be noted.
My main question on this is:
Is in person school mandatory in Texas, or is a homeschool option still available?

Last time this came up, people made it sound like relying on those credit card companies was their only chance of survival
Wait, so is only fans doing well or not?
Maybe it's "good" for cut-and-dry covid, but it sets a precedent for employers to keep discriminating against people's medical history in the future. This is a step in the wrong direction
Next people will get fired for not being vaccinated
You're giving employers the right to discriminate based on medical records
Interesting
They're making the business decision that hosting "adult content" is more profitable than having the accessibility of those major credit cards. So I'm wondering, do people think they'll survive or are they screwed either way?
From a current financial standpoint, how is onlyfans doing?
I get that, but it doesn't answer my question
It's because we know you're ~~cute~~ sincere. Welcome back, buddy!
Okay, okay...
But with covid as it it, it might've been too early for some individuals
It's going to definitely have a big ripple effect

Huh. So it's finally happening.

Honestly, that debate of "did we / didn't we" isn't something I wanna go into though. It's too close to home.
Sorry, sent support to "insurgents"
I guess in conclusion, the US is imperialism or whatever, but it is and always has been ***way*** more than 9/11
Anyway, back on topic, the US doesn't really need 9/11 to justify anything or brainwash anybody. The US has done and will continue to what it feels is most beneficial, but we'll always add that *heroic* spin. We didn't enter WW2 to save the Jews, the north didn't fight the South to free the slaves, and we didn't invade Syria 10 years ago because Asad was an evil dictator.
But that's a whole other issue
Zoe, I hear what you're saying and don't disagree. To clarify my joke, if an air strike against the hurricane or covid would've saved lives, we'd do it in a heartbeat
If you could, damn straight we would've
That's imo, though...
To me, this comes off the same as some jackass saying "People only bring up Columbine to try and abolish the 2nd amendment"
Justification of whatever aside, you gotta remember that yes, many people died in Hurricane Maria, many are still dying to COVID, but they weren't murdered by an unprovoked act terrorism.
Good luck, Q.
Oof
When I got covid, I was barred from getting the vaccine until at least three months had passed

After all, when you're *"encroaching on someone's rights"* ( <:HibikiFacepalm:798028700196536381> ) you can't be too sure if they'll be the type to get violent.

I'm guessing I'm too late, but

Gotcha
I wonder too, the fact that he was lying could imply that if there were profits, he'd just take them and run.

Ahh, so he cashed out
Does the uni still have the crypto at least?
Huh
<:BikkiThink:796558399117852712>
Absolutely
But, I think this is diverging a bit far
It's true that "most qualified" and "best" aren't equal, but determining best isn't really that feasible.

Ex: My company is snotty, we'll only hire mechanical or bio engineers for positions like mine, but I've argued to my boss that anyone, degree or not, could come in and work after on the job training. She simply asked me how I'd narrow down the hundreds of applications I'd receive... so...
That's actually a really good point
I'm assuming past experiences shows that view isn't incorrect, but it feels ultra pessimistic
<:BikkiThink:796558399117852712>
I always feel a little conflicted on this topic. Like, of course, it's awesome that more opportunities are being created for those groups of people! But alternatively, if the best candidate for a position happens to be a male, do they just get assed out of a job because a company needs to meet a quota?

"obvious" or not, the entire purpose of the trial was to determine if the shooter was guilty of homicide. The word victim has implications. I don't think that decision to bar the word is an incorrect one.

>> **What If My State Allows Recreational or Medicinal Marijuana?**

>> When it comes to a conflict between federal and state law, federal law prevails. Therefore, while the state in which a person lives might have made it legal to use, possess, grow or even sell marijuana, a person can still be arrested by federal agents and prosecuted under federal law.

>> As noted above, current federal policy is not to pursue the residents of those states and municipalities in which certain uses of marijuana, e.g. medical or recreational, or even growing and selling marijuana have been legalized as long as residents obey state law and do not distribute marijuana across state lines.

>> Of course, federal policy can change with changing administrations in the nation’s capital, so people want to stay abreast of federal policy regarding marijuana use, possession, growing and distribution.

It should ultimately benefit the working class, but I just hope the economy doesn't completely tank also...
A paradigm shift is coming for sure, though, within the next few years
Employers do be struggling though, and they're trying something to get more people working. Makes you wonder if the free switch gimmick will work.
On this note, I remember when I worked at grocery store how part time people didn't always look forward raises, because a lot of times it led to their hours getting cut
Well, part of the reason
That's why they convince to never talk salaries too
The corporation, probably not yet
The individual stores, absolutely
Idk about domino's specifically, but the grocery store my buddy manages changed their starting pay from $10 to $14 per hour. It's fairly significant, but they still can't fill holes...
In which case, yeah, you can be proud of that
Working multiple jobs to survive has been (and unfortunately may always be) a thing some people do, but is "polywork" negative? The title of that last article implies it's less a survival necessity and more that people are learning how to min-max the system
A small business might not have the same luxury to pay as much as a big one. If they went under, then it's because the money wasn't there...
Isn't it a bad thing if small places are going under? Doesn't that just mean big business will win out?
Yeah, use it to advantage and bounce off of it.
Ex: if it's cold / snowy, ask if they plan on going skiing or snowboarding? Or will they rather stay in with cocoa?
Talking about the weather is a meme in that that's what you talk about if you have nothing else. It's a "last resort"
The advice in itself is solid. Coming into a convo with something prepared is a plus.
I work at a manufacturing facility and know for a fact none of this shit would fly
It's honestly astounding to hear of stories like this that keep happening, especially at megacorps...
Okay, that's actually fucked...
They've forced people to work through natural disasters?!
I think a lot of extrapolation of this story is occurring
In my experience, the blame either comes to the individual or the facility. If the proper warnings and precautionary actions took place and the employees voluntarily ignored them, it's on them. Otherwise, it's on the facility. Hell, sometimes if everything was "done right", if enough damage was done, then the facility will need to improve and mitigate risk even further still beyond what's normally acceptable.
But I don't know if that's if possible
The only conceivable out for Amazon I can think of is that the storm was so early on that no warnings were sent out yet
OSHA needs to shove a boot up their ass...
Potentially. The article says the string of tornadoes ripped through six states.
Unless they entire facility was somehow unaware, though, some sort of safety actions should have taken place
It's 110% Amazon's fault...
Exactly!!
But how the hell do they not have some other form of emergency notification system?!?!
Like, yeah, obviously, if the workers had phones on the floor they would've individually known
I'm kinda confused
My point isn't that "we need more companies to exploit us", it's that if the small businesses fail then we'll only be left with big businesses. The only business owners will be those billionaires who *can* afford it. I understand that people need living wage, but is killing the small business owner the result we want?
If you can't afford to stay in the game, you get out. That's exactly capitalism and it's the world we live in.
Teach me your way, oh master!
It's just wild...
That is how viruses do be
Gotcha
Then again, idk what you do. My place is a mfg site with lots of assembly people in close proximity.
My workplace had no masks for like two weeks before they came back.
Oh, just now?
Are we really any better in PA though?
The word was escaping me
No, you're right
Also, in general, I don't think it's as much as people believe. The majority of covid cases (including the one I had) are minor and can be treated via self care. It's the more extreme cases that require hospitalization. That number will probably go up now with winter, considering compounding sickness, but in general, we're not being overrun like early 2020.
One of my tenants is a nurse. She told me without testing you can't really know how many people you treat actually have COVID or some other ~~cardiovascular~~ respiratory (thanks, lank) sickness, so you treat them all as if they do
<:ChrisPray:672578403156885504>
I'm wondering what each column is
Could you screenshot with the headers?

Life is just that ridiculous sometimes
Relevant to the convo the other day
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/559487902728585216/920487064078811136/B6224535-C057-41BB-ACB3-2073C7479311.jpg
I agree, we need more data. Because what is the severity of said cases?
Right... So it sounds like that shouldn't happen.
I'm no bio major, but the one who explained it to me was, and the way he explained it made sense to me: You treat and quarantine the bedridden, while with the sniffles deal with it. It might not happen, like with the Spanish flu, but I don't see how it couldn't eventually here, even if we're talking 10 years.
But true, we won't really know until we know
The article I reviewed mentioned the situation in South Africa
It still sucks that it's out there, but I have hope things overall are still moving in the right direction.
There isn't enough data to conclude anything, but signs are already pointing to omicron being a less severe strand than delta.
It's a virus, like the flu. It's going to keep evolving and changing over time, with newer and newer strands. As things go as they should, we should hopefully only be left with weak strands in the future.
In what sense?
<:ChrisPray:672578403156885504>
<:TonyEyeRoll:580561912513691679>
<:heh:782946405856837652>

Or if you are certain the stock will rise, you feed into the crashes
I think you just invented an anime plot
<:BikkiThink:796558399117852712>
Agreement
Like, if a student is exposed (family member tests positive) but the student is vaccinated (and asymptomatic, I guess), then they're expected to be at school
Also, other shady stuff happened, like the removal of the distance learning option and vaccinated students losing the ability to quarantine
My understanding is masks are still allowed but voluntary and most kids aren't bothering
<:heh:782946405856837652> <:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
Wtf is this timeline???
Goddammit... My niece just told me that her highschool removed their mask mandate just a week ago
And Merry Christmas!!
Ayyyyy!! Congrats!!
like grad students
or alternatively, college grad who haven't found a job
makes more think it's it just a large amount of jobs that require degrees that just don't pay well (i.e. teaching, phycology)
it's interesting that they also have the highest "some college" amount
<:BikkiThink:796558399117852712>
<:ChrisPray:672578403156885504>
<:BikkiThink:796558399117852712>
But also, if they were different and we "taught both", what would we stop teaching the Arabic numerals?
This example is a little different though
<:YumiPoint:688429724103344164>
Cringe?
Yup

<:ChrisPray:672578403156885504>
Well, here's hoping everyone stays safe, human and animal alike
F
They confirmed some animals are immune?
You kinda forget in all the pandemonium that animals are also susceptible to the virus
...does the video answer the question?
I know this is a joke from a children's show, but definitely has some truth to it:
https://youtu.be/oiO_wnYf2Qs
My questions was more: even if Arabic numerals we're their own separate nonessential system, why would people agree to teach less to our kids?
I'm talking purely hypothetically
Assuming that's what people believe we teach
"English" numerals
Damn... That's just how it be sometimes... But also, maybe the greatest quote to go out on
<:ChrisPray:672578403156885504>
That's wild...

<:KirikaSalute:620069889838809089>
Question: when telling a story and referring to a trans or nb person in the past tense, would you use their current pronouns or the one's they'd use at the time?
<:ChrisPray:672578403156885504>
If I tell you what?
Sounds complex
I guess, probably...? I'm basic, so the whole -sexual/-romantic confuses me. What does one do when they're misaligned?
Could it be a mentality thing?
(E.g. if an NB wants to be with another similar to themselves)
Also found out "boi" had a definition
So to follow up for the others:
- androsexual is the attraction to men or masculine individuals
- skoliosexual is the attraction to non-binary individuals
Thanks youmee!
<:KirikaSalute:620069889838809089> <:TsubasaNote:689554460044820608>
Still curious on the first question though <:HibikiThink:688429715362414641>
Though, still confusing
Kk
Side semi-related question:
Is there a term those who are specifically attracted to NB individuals?
No sorrys needed
Isn't sapphic specifically women loving women though?
Weird question:
How do non-binary individuals usually describe their attraction preference? I'd assume straight and gay can't always apply
<:HibikiFacepalm:798028700196536381>
<:ChrisPray:672578403156885504>

I'd never heard of Technoblade before yesterday, but you could tell his character instantly from that last message he wrote. Absolutely admirable... Keep his family in your thoughts and prayers, fam.
<:ChrisPray:672578403156885504>
Yeah, can't disagree
Ahh, I gotcha
Humorous, but this feels relevant:
https://youtu.be/Xop8QLIJCpY
Agreed... Ignorance is bliss...
Doubt
That very first line is the troubling one, though you'd think if most places just abide by the standard law as written, then the others will have a tougher time enforcing custom agreement while there's other reasonable options
<:FudouEyes:672846284725682195>
> Pennsylvania has no rent-control law. Landlords may raise the rent as much as they want. However, changes must be made in accordance with your contract (your lease).
The lease agreement is always going to be written in the landlord's favor. Remember that if ever apartment shopping
Thinking about it, if there's any regulation anywhere in the states, I haven't heard of it. The legality is the signed lease agreement between the landlord and tenant. As long as that isn't breached, it's legal.
Is their contract really that loose that they can do that though?
Jk, that's fucked up...

I think the bigger question is:
WHY THE HELL DID THEY PARK ON TRAIN TRACKS?!
<:HibikiTired:422925410490253313>
Always had one...
I just found out that my brother's kids are all sick with a myriad of virus, one of which is COVID. Only the ohe youngest one (1.5y) is in the ICU now and getting the treatment she needs to recover, but please keep them all in your prayers, fam. <:ChrisPray:672578403156885504>
<:ChrisPray:672578403156885504>
We're probably going to spike again since it's winter, but at this point in general, COVID is fairly "normalized". It's become another flu, and everyone is treating it like they treated the flu. I don't really think there's a problem with the current action.
Rip my sense of smell...
Immune systems are down, so it almost definitely. Do what you gotta to keep yourself safe, even if you're the only one wearing a mask
I don't disagree on the abortion stance being the republicans' biggest downfall recently

The other 50% is just classic Trump BS though <:heh:782946405856837652>

I know a few people like that
Lol
Checks out
This is why I asked. This reminds me of when I visited Brazil. Driving down there was a completely different skill set, and I didn't even want to attempt it. But driving in the states is cake, comoaritively
Also, you can probably make a big contribution to inner city driving have the least death due to speed. It's a literal fraction of the amount of energy released on an impact
Inner city driving anywhere is a lunatic's job <:heh:782946405856837652>
I think you're going way too deep into generalizing my entire country, fam. Are you trying to tell me that there's not a single Australian who isn't stressed while driving?
America is kinda designed for driving, so I wonder if that's a factor in my non stress?
How good is your country's road quality / infrastructure?
Rough
I also have ADHD, but I honestly find driving relaxing a lot of times
That's as interesting perspective
Hell
I guess, but then you're on their schedule
