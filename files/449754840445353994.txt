Lmao, who need virtually gunpla when u got real gunpla
Just saw the opportunity and wanted to give advice
Sorry if I sound very picky
Even though form your perspective it might look eh. At the right angle, the pic will look marvelous
Also watch the angles
Then you'll get the hang of it
Just take a pose you like and replicate it
Like how to imporve posing

In many ways shape and form
I'm interested
Is that a hard-boiled detective is see
<:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
Miku likes the color



Waga maou
....
Kamen memers

Insert decade joke here
It looks too much like the justice
It has this light pink tone and I don't like it
But it's pink
BANDAI WHY
The teal would have looked nicer
I hate the colors
Is that the original colors?
Thats the fun part
Yeah they're not bad for KR representations
Oof mb
Liek yku knwo those dragons or snake customs right?
Regular customs use like 5-6
World winning models use like 20-30
Thats little
No
Quarantine be like
I need like 3 kits in order to make what is want so
However
I but wings and feet
I make destiny tsubasa style custom
Tru tru
Heavily debatable
Epic
Ye?
Yesh ths final mecha has a slight darker undertone
The darker tone matches the design
I liek your colors more
Epic
Manga
Oh yeah
HIGE BRAIN

I first thought it was a trnsformer
Thata huge
Holy shizzles
Oh
It can't be that bad
Oof
Yup

Mini pla is surprisingly solid
Very nice
Its more of a tellish green tbh
Epic
Oh a shinkalion

Sougo sucks
Lining

Celestial being wants to know your location

People with money be like:

<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
Exams be like
I can't speel
Hot bod check
Twin pistols check
Twin tails check
But the basic essential are there
A LOT of customizing if accuracy
Liek I said basically
Thats basically chris
Take the new may model doll
Yes
Around 30 if hg and 10 is mg
Its rare to see someone with new kits in these times
All shops are liek closed and online prices are too expensive
You're welcome!
I rate 8\10 for first try
Pretty gewd
This is your fist attempt right?
A simple "or anything in general" would ahve been hilarious
Dang it yku could have made a joke
Honestly it's really good
Bend the knees a bit more
Kewl
Ye
Exams
But they count as exams so
Yeah since online exams don't exist i just have assignments that are midst more difficult
It just had to due a lot of balancing
Yeah I'm free
Epic
Thz
I dont want the notifications plz
Okay no do it in nonsymphogear spoilers
Peace
Exams
I could rant but
Later
Why doesn't work have it
His sun weakness makes even less sence
Hey, I kill
Jjst
Or even backstory
Reaosn
He didn't have a motive
Only exsist to upgrade a existing rider
Ginga was an upgrade character
We NEED it
There are only 4
So I tried a new pose and I like it a lot also gun wing blade thangs

I thoguht they were pumpkins
Both riders should do that
Yes
Liek it could transofrm into the actual transformation gimmick
More modified to fir the need of the driver
Like Neo gia memories
Maybe change them up in a way
I don't liek the reusing of gimmicks
*CrInGe*
Kamen rider Yugo, whenever u go, I'll be there
Something like "go" puns
Imagine its called Yugo and his catchphrase is something cheesy like Mach's
Change channel now
Not with u
Grand zio is funnier cause it longer
I mean like back and forth
The Grand Zio henshin in text
Yo colour, wanna do something cringy
U can see the hour hands
The head crest
Great work
Lol
For a second I thought that was a crown but it was a shock expression
Ikr
I got a new setup


Black decade
Black decade
Like aspects from them
My idea is that the final form is a fusion of his favorite rider's final forms
And thats his gimmick
Like u could do like for the secondary rider, since his favorite is W(from what I see) u could make his form putting two rider helmets together double style
Also make the gimmick interpret the fusion gimmick as well
Cause like the form come from their imagination right so each form reflects who they tackle each situation
I think the suit should reflect the rider's favorite rider
Nice touch
One is violent emotion
I see
Imagine adding shades and text saying gang gang
Depends on what ur going for
But its not impossible
I mean u could modify it to actually transform but it would take a lot of effort
Yeah once u get used to painting, the stickers are just extras that u can throw out so its not too bad
Tryon 3 has stickers in the most dumb places
IBO toes are fine cause they're small and easy to paint
Sticker hell
Two words
Ahem
Bruh lmao
So I made a striker pack out of the extra parts

I feel like the back could use just a bit more but idk
I think its too slim
Thoughts plz

Its time

Lul
I just said my opinion i Don't get why ur so frustrated?
Also if its like supposed to be the curve of one boob shouldn't there be another curve for the other
Also the crevice leads to her arm not to the center of her chest
But since the perspective of the character is different, where the crevice is seen is also different
See thats correct
Its still in the wrong spot though
Oh
That's the crevice
Its like when u put two boobs together there is a line in the center that forms
No
The crevice between the two boobs
Yes dess, I was obviously taking to you
Oh hey Nao
Do you think a gundam can have a boob line
Other than that its looks amazing
From this angle there should be a biob line considering her chest sticks out so much
Why no boob line
One issue I have
Those are the most common and produced so you can try your luck there
Specifically the ones that stray to have a Chinese/Japanese style
Um... I would guess that if u really want that nostalgic feeling again, you should look at old SD kits
Oh right
Yeah its very impressive
Bandai has been doing gundam since the 1800s i think
It was probably a kit
Was it in a Chinese esc style?
Thats an SD kit
Was it like chibi?
U mean an SD?
Everything else from bandai has never done this before so its quite new and interesting
Thankfully this ONLY applies to the build fighters line from this year
In my opinion it's a good idea because some people just want the weapons and not the mobile suit or vice versa(like me) but some people see it as lazy marketing
They make u buy minimum 2 different kits to make the official gundam
Well the new sets are like a marketing bait
I see
U mean the ads on sets for the core gundam armors and such
But yes the main concept of gunpla is mix and matching different kits to make unique combinations
Oh that was because if u lived in my area I could join by some chance
Interesting, so what's ur view of gunpla so far?
Excuse me
a-ahem
FRIXK
Where do u live
...
Sometimes there are exceptions but those kits are quite uncommon from the main line stuff
So get anything from like 2010 and onwards an you should be fine
So basically all HG kits these days basically have the same 3 millimeter hole connection
Rerise is the good shizz
Cause just Gundam Build Divers is a BAD show
SPECIFICALLY RERISE
Gundam build divers Rerise
Ah yes giant robot women
*MINECRAFT*
Depends
Its used for customization
Sure
thx you for your help
I have a busy girl pic on my phone but I don't wanna look for it also its in meme format so I went with the most recent thing
My appreciation for your advice
Oh btw, do you like bunnies?
Anyway thx for ur help Nao
Thats what j thought at first but ig it looks like it
Noonan sensai teach me ur ways
It the forearm that serves a bit
Its not the bend
*from a pro*
Thats why I'm trying to learn
Also the left arms loose kinda odd but if u could spare a explanation I wouldn't say a word
I'm serious
Cause that was the only thing thaf seemed off at first
I was trying to learn more about perspective
But I wasn't horny
Debatable
How did we go on about a conversation about anime titty curvature structure

So like skin tight is clothes that are meant to fit perfectly and clothes that are skin tight are clothes that happen to fit perfectly or close to perfect
That makes sense now
Ah
I get skin tight suits but whats clothing being skintight?
Nobody cares for the ending
Darling in the Franxx
That helps a lot
Thx Nao
The boob line isn't as present or non-present
So because since the angle fo which the body is faced, the angle fo her stance and the overall clothing factors
Ah got it
If that happened in irl
Would that mean basically stretching clothing?
That makea sense
Ooooooo
Yes
I wanna learn why
Cause if im actually wrong
Okay then how do you see it
*BELIEVE IN THE ME THAT BELIEVES IN YOU*
Oh yeah
Where havw I heard that befoee
<:TsubasaSmug:585839805737467920>
Also the original is cheaper
They say the build is worst but I haven't tried it yet so idk
Core gundam 2 is kinda eh to some people
The original
Get the core gundam if u want something close to scale
If this is easier then it might be worth it
Cause DnD is hard
I'll love to try
So its DnD
So its rp on discord
Interesting
Ah
So is this a video game or like a board game?
Ah yes the classic thicc main character
Interesting
Oh
Are u making a game?
Epic
I see what u mean
Explain
Thx
I had time to spare so if fixed up the problems
Thats nice
