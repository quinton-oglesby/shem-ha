my 3 favorite music anime in one pic. I had always dreamed but dared not hope








I liked Build Fighters Try overall more but those two definitely had the better relationship of the two series. Glad to see them get some love




soon

Fuuka time?









never played Fates but I liked Hinoka in Warriors and Heroes. Helps she shares the VA with my favorite character from BlazBlue


it isn't confirmed he is as far as I'm aware. Plus the continuity of Macross is always weird since movie and show canon's are separate but sometimes implied that the movies are in-universe movies of real events. So who knows about manga added to that
yep
3_skip
I mean, she has a bunch but Emilia is the only one we really see and it is in an OVA
she had one of the best intros a character could have
I'm disappointed in how little Emilia Jenius fanart exists though








been a while since Macross 2 so I don't remember much. Not many people defend it especially since Shoji Kawamori had no involvement with it
is that cringe because of retconning Macross 2 or cringe because Macross 2 technically exists?


I'm jealous of Noel for being able to do it so much. I would also like this:


it is indeed




anyway, more Makoto
Also, I just realized hockey players tend to have ridiculous legs and butts... I hope they emphasize that in the show
hockey is beautiful and can be quite graceful especially if you look up the skating prowess of people like Sidney Crosby
<a:ChrisHappyCry:744335804482060349>
thank you for telling me of this. I love hockey and have been waiting for a hockey anime. Plus all the skating pics have made me miss the going to the rink

glad you broke the streak. Pretty sure I was out of good SFW Fuuka art that hasn't been posted within the past week










a lot of good images there

A bit of a parallel with Miku as Mu 12 brainwashed with beam funnels/bits
I would put Hibiki firmly as Makoto. Kind of air headed but pure hearted, hot blooded punchy girl with an orange color scheme and bullied in the past who wants everyone to get along and not fight
technically there are 3 as the Gaia Gundam is in the top left corner transformed
I mean, the Gouf design is a classic. If it was the original UC or Origin design I would agree but I think it was updated well for CE
Saviour Gundam (the red one)?
which one?

... that makes me want to have art of El teaching her how to skate and my heart can't take it
also, amusingly enough, I had just come back from skating when I posted that batch of Edeleth
I wonder if hockey is a thing too. I could definitely see both of them playing

hate caps fans... they're the worst
I only got into hockey because of Mario Lemieux and Jaromir Jagr but grew up near Washington DC so I actually hate the Capitals a lot more than the Flyers
well lately Flyers tend to be good every other year. This year they missed the playoffs so next season they should make a run (I assume at least second round)
although here is a consolation prize
well, under law, it is my duty and my great pleasure to say that it has been 16,821 days since the Flyers won the cup
it was commissioned so the commissioner's preference most likely. Whoever it was, one of the people involved has exquisite taste liking the Penguins

speaking of hugging a soft warm thing, more of the goodest boi
I think it is is the softness of the girl plus the softness of the fluffy clothes that makes it appealing. Plus, from my experience, women tend to have pretty high core temperatures so it is like hugging a super soft space heater
wearing fluffy clothes is nice. Hugging a girl in fluffy clothes is better

For the overally specific reference, it is Shinn Asuka's uniform from Gundam SEED Destiny. He was considered one of (if not THE) edgiest Gundam protagonists and he became that way because his family was killed during a battle from the original Gundam SEED

nope. Although I was reminded of it and wanted to see if there was any new art. There wasn't so I looked for old art I hadn't seen yet

it's from Toji no Miko. I was reminded of a group of characters because the Honkai pic with white, orange, and black. Unfortunately, not a lot of art of the three

I didn't even realize it was supposed to be from G-Saviour since it looks so different. I guess it is the artist redesign of I-Saviour then?

thousands of fans already did because Ufotable designed it to be watched that way. Similar situation as Star Wars really as you can watch original or prequel first. Doesn't matter where or how a fan gets into it, we should be happy they do. Trying to complicate it and put people off is more likely to put people off watching it altogether

hence why I said people complicate it
that does work since a lot of people convolute what should/needs to be watched first. My suggestion: watch Fate/Zero or Fate/stay night: Unlimited Blade Works. Then watch whichever one of those 2 you didn't watch. Then it is a free for all

one of the most cathartic scenes in anime
Nanoha Strikers or Vivid Strike? I mean, I would say yes either way but I'm biased. Strikers introduces characters for Vivid including Vivio herself. Not a great show but I found it entertaining enough. Vivid Strike is my favorite Nanoha show though



anyway
I like how the tags on Pixiv are just the name of the show, the character, and "breasts"

Sanya normally wears black but the art style and hair is a bit different where I didn't recognize her at first. It's quite a good piece. Maybe my favorite of her

Also a crystalline piece of jewelry that is actually technology based on an advanced ancient civilization that forms a technological suit make the similarities between Symphogear and Mai Otome stronger
couldn't find one that was similar so not sure. The season 1 transformations for Symphogear are actually pretty close to Mai Otome's materialize scenes
Nanoha and a bit of Mai Otome definitely influenced Symphogear

find if a rink is near you, look up their public skate sessions, and rent some skates. You could probably look up some videos on how to learn if you want figure skates or hockey skates

It's funny because I mostly view the party on gender lines in that game. The guys have great chemistry with each other especially when Rokurou and Eizen teach Laphicet. Besides Velvet though, I don't really remember any interactions between the guys and girls. Like Eleanor and Eizen definitely had interactions but I can't for the life of me remember them
Velvet good. Love the interactions the women have with each other

fanart is pretty made up on the matter though
more than the source material. Season 3 might show if it was just yuribaiting or if they end up changing the story
still worth a watch just for how pretty it is really

if you like Symphogear, Nanoha is worth a watch
Season 1 of Symphogear is heavily inspired by season one of Nanoha. Plus Naonha being more shonen action with a more sci-fi mechanical bent on the magical girl concept
it is Nanoha

I kind of wish we got the movie just for the interactions between them

did you look at the source to figure it out? If not, I'm impressed since it was not a popular show. Also not a lot of fanart of it

Mirage still has best flight suit look
interesting. I still would think her having those colors is still a nod to Basara since Fire Bomber was one of her inspirations
Freyja's not being her normal orange but instead using Basara's VF-19's color scheme is great

in Ranka's Seikan Hikou she has the line "Ryuusei ni matagatte" which is "Ride a shooting star" so likely a reference to that

not surprised by her lack of representation by the way, just disappointed
nowadays tsunderes are a dime a dozen though. After Fate gained more popularity with the Fate/Zero anime adaptation and FGO caused an explosion of artwork and new saber/Rin/Sakura faces, Sakura is still underrepresented comparatively in the cultural zeitgeist

I mean, the same for Rin when you boil it down to an archetype since she is a tsundere
Sakura gets less attention than most Fate girls

178 cm vs 180 cm for Haruka is from the wiki. Although, as far as I know, there aren't any official heights. I think the only official number we get is Usagi being 150 cm early on and then extrapolated from that and characters who are fully grown get used as references after
3_skip https://www.pixiv.net/en/artworks/48017977
when Haruka is introduced, she becomes the tallest at around 6'
Ami's actually in the middle. A few cm taller than Minako and 10 cm taller than Usagi (although Usagi closes the gap a bit as the story goes on). Amusingly, Makoto was always the tall one and had a complex about it but from a western perspective, she is a pretty normal 5'8"
also, cute
not sure if there is something specifically but they compliment each other well. Makoto is the brawns and Ami the brain. They also both have their insecurities about others viewing them for who they really are with Makoto actually being very sweet and traditionally "feminine" (cooking, sewing, and the like) contrasting her getting into fights and being tall while Ami appears to be an arrogant genius to others but is actually lonely and wants to make friends but is shy

and of course Sheryl Nome being related to Sara and Mao Nome
I like how Makina is a descendant of the head mechanic in Zero

also, Plus totally predicted Hatsune Miku and VTubers
I'm going to take a stab in the dark and say the cousin from the original. That definitely aged poorly. Definitely recommend Macross Plus though then
I appreciated Zero being different but it is usually regarded as the weakest (with Macross II being ignored outright). Macross Plus is up there in ratings
original holds up pretty well story-wise, 7 was just ridiculous and sometimes dumb but in a great way, and Frontier was overall good. One of the easiest old series to catch up on really simply because there aren't many entries (looking at you Gundam)
Ah. Top middle is Nekki Basara and Mylene Flare Jenius from Macross 7. Middle bottom is Lynn Minmay from the original series. Bottom right two are Ranka Lee and Sheryl Nome from Macross Frontier
haven't watched all the main Macross series?

I assume you mean keychains but do you mean that only one is non-love triangle+ and also ||not alive by the end|| or do you mean the unrequited gay love?

it's the female Fujimaru Ritsuka (aka Gudako)

well you could try to mimic regular wings with your fingers, it might be painful. And you could probably only really do it once
also, Isamu's English VA? Bryan Cranston
Isamu from Macross Plus did that. Not sure if he was the first but it is based on some real pilots visualizing their flights

some servants didn't get much character but had important fights like Karna. Some had more development/character moments but not much of a role in the fighting like Fran. Spartacus was the one who had neither
I mean, you remember all his contributions then
she forces the battle to the point where Vlad has to use his noble phantasm. Also, the true insult is to compare her to Spartacus, the truly worthless servant no matter which side he's on

https://twitter.com/skeptycally/status/1570213638165901312
well the leak that originally showed off Toothpaste-chan a couple months ago also talked about FE4 being remade. With Sigurd being featured in the trailer for Engage, it might happen. So 5 being remade doesn't seem unlikely sometime after that

yep

nah. Spoilers that small are good for the soul. You can pay more attention to the journey instead of worrying about the destination

Should I delete? I just saw nice art and I don't really check that channel


https://twitter.com/zankaVD/status/973182866325618691


yep. Takamina

yeah, I tried to get most of the cute/non-spoilery ones without spamming. Having a more thorough look through made me tear up though because the movie is still fresh
supposedly Muhammad Ali in the 60s
it had no business being as good as it was
and yeah, same director, studio
the hat they wear in disguise is pretty much the same design. And Mikumo's hair color is more blue
Mikumo looks like Chieri Sono from AKB0048 at times. Especially the disguise and hair color when we meet her
considering we talked about it last night in the anime club channel, yeah
oh absolutely. Amusingly, Macross 7 is my other favorite and also suffers from pacing problems. It could've cut 6 or more episodes out
I love the first half of Delta something fierce. Second half, the story gets away from it a bit. Probably could've used 4-6 more episodes to give everything more explanation and breathing room
3_skip
yep. Mixing succession and Fine as well


she is the leader of the group, not graduated. The red hair girl, Kanata, is ||set to take over her position which gives Takamina a crisis of confidence||

although she got a bed and food so she seemed pretty happy with the deal
well when we saw her schedule, it seems like she would want to sleep in every day. She had a pretty brutal schedule



I mean look at that face
she always nice
I meant the Lyrical Survivor series they've been doing where they look a bit like idols that you posted a bunch of. Their jacket is open, they have a black button up shirt with white color, colored tie, and a button that has LS and a star on it. Also they have those headset mics
so Nanoha, Fate, Einheart, Hayate. Next would probably be Vivio. Hoping they continue for Fuuka and Rinne
<@173112001684439040> another pretty unique hairstyle for her




this artist has done nothing but Nika art since episode 1 and I appreciate that about them

I want to see her interact with Mai from Nichijou. The trolling would be next level
not the first time a character with a crush on someone realizes they are more compatible/have a stronger connection with someone else. Shippers definitely see it with Kita and Bocchi

just figured you would lose some power when pushing off because you wouldn't be able to extend your foot/toes down for that little extra oomph. Important when going down ice for a breakaway or chasing a puck but I don't know how often it would be used figure skating. Maybe when pushing up for a jump like an axel?
but then I use hockey skates so I'm not an expert on figure skating
heels on your skates just seems like a bad idea

I look forward to the flashback or side story with her during the time the picture was taken
Not surprising. It is based on a picture of her when she was even younger that was shown briefly in the prologue. So a couple layers down
She ran and only gained one instead of moving forward

anime does a good job of putting you in sword dad's perspective. Part wanting to give her a hug and a nice comfy life but also wanting to respect her decision to be stronger
yeah, Fran can be pretty merciless but it is hard to blame her
it's interesting because the guy who gets reincarnated as a sword becomes a support and surrogate dad to Fran. The anime itself is good too. Not the best but there is actually some neat little things the director does like how they frame Amanda
did you read the light novel/manga or just like the character design? You seem quite excited whenever I post Fran (not that I can blame you since she a cutie)

didn't realize it got a season 2 announced already

I've read and responded to texts while doing laps including switching from forwards to backwards and vice versa. At that point it becomes more like distracted driving if there are other people on the ice and you have to be more careful not to run into people

I searched for the pixiv ID and these didn't show up. The others on the artist's page have been posted before

the 7 OVA with Emilia I love just because her introduction is so great
Frontier was the first Macross I watched. Thought it was alright. When I went back and watched all the others I watched it again and gained new appreciation for it. Especially the Zero shots
usually Delta if we're being honest. I skim through 7 sometimes though
like I mentioned, I don't remember anything about it. I only watched it and the original once about 10 years ago. May watch it again at some point but when I do get the urge to rewatch Macross, I tend to watch 7, Frontier, or Delta
I hope this actually works out but I still don't trust Harmony Gold
DanMachi OVAs are... something else
Best natural pilot too
https://tenor.com/view/anime-shy-embarrased-gif-7922603
avoid Dragonar Academy. It bad
I like the mecha design. I should give it a watch
Academy?
Silver Link had a good run of shows there with each getting sequels. Bofuri, My Life as a Villainess, and Misfit of Demon King Academy
granted they were early sequels so the pandering hadn't set in yet
Jerid Messa didn't. ~~Char~~ Quattro Bajeena wore glasses but was a mentor to Kamille. Don't remember Glemy Toto having one in ZZ either
and of course the best Itano circus ever animated
the X-9s were cool
Azusa with the power kabedon tho
although Remember 16 coming back in Macross Delta hurt
I was always partial to "Power to the Dream"
seeing the return of the Striker packs in the new SEED, I wonder if sword is going to be the best again. If I recall, it was undefeated in SEED and only lost once in Destiny
after the writer got cancer and then 00 got popular, I thought they would abandon CE forever
I never thought it would happen. SEED is when I really got into anime and I even have a soft spot for Destiny. It also has my favorite overall mech designs
also, if TM Revolution doesn't provide music and be a VA for it, we should definitely riot
I wonder if they'll use the same plot outline Morosawa made or if it'll be reworked/replaced
agree with design not exactly fitting CE
I can't imagine striker packs won't return. It and phase shift were pretty iconic to CE and phase shift was mostly replaced with variable phase shift in Destiny but still a little present
Also, what is that image from? Choosing Makina seems like a daring choice
https://tenor.com/view/freyja-wion-macross-delta-macross-anime-dance-happy-gif-17573678
I was thinking this was something related to the new movie and got too excited. Also disappointed because I knew all the songs and they were shortened versions. Still watched it all and enjoyed it because Walkure
I also support Toji no Miko and Princess Principal. I will also throw Bofuri in as a recommendation
as long as we also get bullets/rockets that are also actually speakers
Macross has been really ahead of it's time. I wonder what will come true out of 7, Frontier, and Delta...
it is throwing me for a loop though thinking about it
.... they're not wrong
<:ChrisPray:672578403156885504>
Kill la Kill is definitely a fun ride
I still need to watch Utena... I should get on that sometime
https://tenor.com/view/freyja-wion-happy-anime-anime-happy-macross-delta-gif-17573677
I hope they are as decultured as you are
well from what I understand it is a different story set in the same universe. They also announced a new console game as well as a a mobile game (probably gacha) back in March. So no idea why they would cancel
ah. Magical Girl Raising Project which I haven't seen. Guess I should add it to the list
... from what? Sakura the card captor is the one with the red bow
only one I don't recognize is far right near the bottom
haven't seen the 4 on the right but know 3 of them
I used anime planet since I liked the interface better. Last time I tried exporting from it to anilist, it didn't work. That said, I haven't updated in a few years. I think I still have Heavy Object as "watching" and that was when it was airing
Man, you guys posting all that makes me really want to update/finish migrating my list to anilist
which was really all you needed
all of IS I remember is the harem aspects
I don't remember any of the actual plot points from IS
I would say it is pretty horrible
how is that so high?
Well I guess it's better than how many recaps were in Beatless
I don't think so either. Not many people watch/talk about it either so it was so unexpected and seeing a Japanese tweet with that image... I let hope takeover
I thought for a second that was news about Release the Spyce and was hoping for a second season... immeasurable disappointment... but the song is great so I rebounded quick
One of the most distinctive voices. I definitely like how they put her narrator role from Okami and her 7 companions since she was great in that
yeah, started last week. From what I heard, author was an assistant for Horikoshi which is why the characters look MHA-ish
There are a bunch of little references to actual WWII history that is hidden in Strike Witches
Well the true story is less horny and more just a fun aside. 

Erich Hartmann got drunk with some other pilots (Barkhorn may have been one of them) on a train to Berlin so they could recieve some medals. He ended up near one of the high ranking officers area and took a hat that was hung up which was apparently much too big for him. When caught he got yelled at particularly because the hat belonged to... Adolf Hitler
Well the Strike Witches episode is loosely based on actual WW2 history...
still sad news
I hear her boyfriend is pilot
all the lovely abababa
GPT2. Because it was free
definitely watch if you haven't. There are some great gems in there
with appearances by the other Trash Taste bois: CDawgVA and The Anime Man
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21zDl4sX3nE
Gigguk did a video with pretty much exactly that
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
but if you help out enough (assuming someone else hasn't come forward), you could get in a million+ viewed youtube video which would be cool
could be yeah
oh. It was his patreon supporter discord so probably not easily hopping over there. But there is still twitter or just a business email if you wanted to help him out
not sure how long that video was in production before he released it so it might have been more stringent at the time. He was getting help from an AI engineer from his discord for it. Not sure if he would be willing to revisit it but you could pop over there and ask about it or something
he mentions it at the end of the video that it was by invite and he wasn't sure if they would let him do it to make "shitty isekai titles"
The Ranma episode that released with that was a fun one
he DOES hit enemies a lot... just with the speakers instead
he is definitely one of the best pilots because how little he has to rely on weapons to survive
Messer is up there near Isamu's level but Windermereans be OP
Max also gets the girl. Top chad
Hayate was fun because he was great when in mecha mode but took a while to learn the fly part which was mostly what he needed to fight in
him and Asemu have my respect most because they're the normies
winning in a ball
that definitely put him as one of the best
the country bumpkin did pretty well considering the level of technology he was used to
and Heero was selected to be the pilot. Some of the others like Loran had pretty good excuses for why they were so bad
are you talking about overall or at the beginning? Because Judau was pretty terrible too
Have you finished it yet? Because it makes it more clear in the last episode
and I would give him bonus points for his control scheme
if they were bullets his count would probably be pretty high
I thought they included some stuff from side novels
FMP Fumoffu is still one of the funniest shows
I wish I could do that. I should love it since it panders to me and my guilty pleasures but I just can't get over how poorly it handles the isekai element that I can't help but hate it
I mean, I actually like it design-wise but naming the opposite of Deathscythe Hell is a little too much
also laughing at Livelance Heaven
looking it up, yeah it is. Interesting the lack of mouth slits
I don't play the mobile game so I'm interested to see what designs this introduces me to
https://twitter.com/i/web/status/1428658258554748938
the comparison to the Rock doesn't work for me because he isn't exactly versatile in his acting. Yuuki Aoi has got quite a bit of range. Didn't even realize she plays 3 different characters in MHA
<:GenjuroThumbsUp:336657189475188740>
<@!722121666641133608>
or more accurately, アンチ
Anti
that show ran on rule of cool and power of music more than pretty much any other show
I also don't think there is much suspension of disbelief in Macross 7
I don't remember Macross itasha. I would assume Frontier but even the Ranka concert for that one Zentradi fleet didn't have it from what I remember
also, missed out on the itasha mecha
Pictured: quality anime
I mean, the show had missiles with "No Idols" painted on the front in the first episode. Not sure how you get past that but micsaber is what gets you out
yes
AKB0048 to me is not a good show but an incredibly enjoyable one. Once I got used to how absurd it was with the hearts in the hair and eyes and worship of AKB48, I started to really dig it. Season 2 was actually the most enjoyable show that season to me. Psycho Pass was better but I was more excited for an AKB0048 episode to air
Karen Iwata was my favorite since her voice is so unique especially for a MC
that was also from January of last year and it was because, despite wearing a skirt, you can see the outline of her crotch. Not sure why it was such a big deal to remove it
but they do some rotating shots and the like in some episodes where it is not pulled off well and jittery. Also felt like there were more still frame than season 1
obviously they save it for some important stuff
also, a lot of subtext and references from the real AKB48 especially at the time comes into play which is interesting
generally yeah. I think the animation is slightly worse but the songs and general story are better
by the time season 2 finished airing, like only 3 of the cast were still in AKB48 so my dream of season 3 where new understudies come in with the old cast being the mentors is definitely not happening
that's how
cuz it's good
So for everything it goes Triangle Heart 3 > Lyrical Toy Box > Lyrical Nanoha > Nanoha Vivid > Vivid Strike
also, for completeness sake: the Nanoha anime is actually an adaptation (with quite a few changes) of a story on a bonus CD that is a spinoff of the eroge Triangle Heart 3
Yes. Vivid Strike is a spinoff of Nanoha Vivid which is a spinoff set after the events of Nanoha's third season. It is so far removed though that it isn't really necessary to watch the previous series
<:goodjob:586282986819944459>
I think Aldnoah felt worse because it had higher to fall
but they were too wishy washy and brought Kira back into the spotlight
SEED Destiny would've been better if they actually weren't writing by the seat of their pants and kept Shinn as main character. Have protagonist turn villain like Anakin would've been a cool story
I think there were some other good ideas. Coordinators are a good concept that I thought was handled well
still love the mook mech designs though
I mean if it was their best and brightest, it certainly explains their government in SEED Destiny
maybe they could do an anthology of the fun parts about mythology overlooked by Fate
agreed. But I want the actual myth adapted
Can we have an ufotable adaptation of that?
when they showed off the Aerial Knights, people were expecting a battle of the bands
they're doing what people originally thought Delta was going to be about
<:TsubasaBliss:672861879000891432>
good day for previews of works I'm looking forward to apparently: new Macross Delta: Absolute Live!!!!!! visual
I hope so. Nikko Icebucks were involved with production so should be fairly accurate
same on all counts. Had to laugh at the goal early on in there though. Goalie was standing up too straight. Should've been lower to go into butterfly easier
yes!
.... this is ominous... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ok845OkqyVM
https://tenor.com/view/anime-police-loli-come-here-sit-here-gif-16476124
but it is very close
gotta have those blush stickers
not quite
and while Madoka didn't really do anything new, it was tightly written
yeah but people don't pay attention to magical girl shows. Most people knew of only Sailor Moon and Card Captor Sakura before seeing Madoka
I dislike the visual of them juggling the puck because they're better than I've ever been at that. Over a decade of hockey and I get schooled by anime girls
I remember basically nothing about the show... except the theme song
mine was probably one of those... or Ronin Warriors. Maybe Samurai Pizza Cats
<:MikuSigh:688429722799308883>
I remembered to eat when watching Restaurant to Another World this week... still get hungry while I'm eating/watching
that show was ridiculous but I remember of the plot was that season 2 the MC was naked for at least half the season
Tequila Gundam forever!
my vote for worst. Nether Gundam has my vote for so bad it's good
for those unaware, Ayakashi Triangle is from the artist of To Love Ru with everything that entails. Also, surprisingly, the chapter did have a full ||love confession that was reciprocated|| which I wasn't expecting to happen given the type of story.
dang Ayakashi Triangle really is perverted. Chapter 69 and they're ||holding hands||
Nadesico is good stuff
I should absolutely love it. But it just doesn't work and it annoys me to no end
that looks like the show I have a vendetta against
I personally think the lumber gundam could've used a denim paint job
there is nothing wrong with the Tequila Gundam
in the manga it turns into an axe
the art shows that Gungnir isn't the only thing Hibiki inherited from Kanade. That is quite the charm point
the art makes me think of Patema Inverted
Plot reasons. AKA ||deflecting Aoyama's laser||
yep, latest chapter. She got bushy eyelashes
Dang. You know the end is coming when MHA finally does a face reveal for Hagakure
supposedly Marilyn Monroe could just walk differently and people wouldn't recognize her because of how she carried herself. I always assumed Superman/Clark Kent thing was also that. Timid Clark vs self-assured Superman
and the new Luminous Witches (aka idol Strike Witches) is set to air in July made by studio Shaft
don't forget Brave Witches which was also done by Silver Link.
Ruri's mom is a gamer and they're super wholesome playing Mario co-op. I want more
I agree Yuka, Ruri is likeable and more people should know her
Nanoha: bi icon?
she's eating clouds... is she going to be the weather next?
sometimes, you think you've seen a lot of anime and then you see a sheet like that. Still managed to eek out a bingo from the bottom 5. Seen 14 total
Kio Asuno flashbacks intensify...
It is pretty close to her StrikerS design. After season 1 they leaned more heavily into the magitek/mecha connection because it got unexpectedly large support from Shonen fans who likened her design to Gundam and started calling Nanoha "the white devil"
yep. Made with no involvement from Kawamori. If I recall, it is like 200 years after the original and some things don't make sense given the canon of the other entries so it is pretty much ignored
Frontier is the 25th anniversary so it references all the previous Macross entries (minus Macross II)
I would recommend Plus before Frontier
https://tenor.com/view/macross-macross7-anime-guitar-gif-13267970
plus Emilia
it's still worth a watch. More Max and Milia
it is also one of the reasons I love it
Macross 7 had psychic space vampires cowering before the power of rock and roll. Frontier was actually pretty tame
the way that scene was framed and lit, reminded me of AKB0048. Also thinking on it a bit, parts of the plot, while an extension of Macross lore and technology, is absolutely used wholesale in AKB0048. It was already a joke when it came out that AKB0048 was just a testbed for ideas to use in Macross by Kawamori but the movie just makes it a stronger case
still cried though
the movie also projects the ending super hard. Like I think the only reason someone wouldn't expect it at the end is because it is literally their first movie
I liked all the pineapple dishes on the table at one point. Nothing like making longtime viewers very nervous
part of me wished they didn't reference some of the earlier stuff so much. But then Max was flying and I wanted more. Plus him and Mirage needed to have more interaction
not by much. Still bittersweet at best
I literally just finished it. I got tears down my face
okay. Was wrong. Macross II is "only" 80 years in the future
not that canon is very strong in Japanese culture particularly Macross
... so not a clone daughter but one conceived the natural way, right?
except no Shirley? Like, the most obvious choice to me considering their relationship in the show
banger prologue and 1st episode. Hoping it continues
Shiro did 1v1 a Zaku in a Ball which might be the most impressive piloting any character has done in Gundam
the yuri was getting hyped up before the series even started. Them pulling an Utena is what got people to actually sit up and take notice since they weren't drawing it out and being coy with it
It is slated for 2024 or something absurd like that I think
they changed it to that? About 5 hours ago the title was simply Suletta's first duel
the surrounding girls/bullies were joking about it in *that* way
That and ikenai borderline are pretty heavy with those types of lyrics
rich people not caring about human lives? ~~What a ridiculous fantasy~~
been a while since I watched G. Maybe another rewatch is in order...
is a nuke really aiming at a point on a mecha?
well he learns his lesson in 0080...
GGO Alternative is a fun watch though
looks at people recommending 0080. Uh...
strictest definition: someone has to be surprised by the mobile suit and say "it's a Gundam!"
pretty sure Athrun or Cagalli call out a Gundam the first episode of Destiny
I wouldn't put it past the Earth Alliance to rename the OS (and therefor not call it a Gundam) just to not admit it was made by a dirty coordinator
SEED Destiny is the Star Wars prequels of Gundam. Main character falling to the bad guys' side but the writing makes him seem whiney and dumb. 

Main difference is that Destiny didn't have the balls to go all in on Shinn as the MC and reintroduced Kira as a protagonist. Plus Athrun didn't work well as an Obi-Wan the way he was written.

It is a guilty pleasure and I think it gets more hate than it deserves but it absolutely squandered some of the ideas it had
Maybe switched. One definitely died and the other lost an arm
I think it was Kira dies and Athrun loses his arm in the original idea for the finale
Flay is also more popular in Japan than in the west. Ironically, Fukuda thought she would appeal to western audiences
Yeah, Kira dominated Newtype magazine's male character for something like 10 years and still breaks into the top 10 since
... Tiger & Bunny 2 is already out? Last I saw was the movie and heard more was coming. I need to catch up
https://twitter.com/bofuri_anime/status/1577961868253093888
I watched G Saviour so it'll be worth more my time than that
I've watched pretty much everything Gundam except the SD series
oh. Misread where I looked it up. Hmm. Either I haven't watched it or it has been so long that I completely forgot about it
never played it. Looked it up. Is it the one about the about the training mission and then whining about Quattro?
it pretty much is an even dumber version of harambe killed -> WWIII timeline
Kamille didn't do it because they were fascist though (at least the first incident). One guy said he thought Kamille was a girl's name and not even directly to him. His fragile, toxic masculinity made me hate him for pretty much the entire show
if I had to rewatch AGE or G Saviour, I would probably pick G Saviour.... Unless I could just watch Asemu's arc since that was okay
it is pretty much the Star Wars Holiday Special of Gundam where it's entire existence was explicitly ignored until a cameo in Build Fighters (and nothing since AFAIK)
as okay as 1999 CGI made for TV movie allowed
All these favorite lists makes me want to update my anilist to get everything it is missing. Problem is, I've watched so much that brining them over from the previous site takes forever. And I hadn't updated that since 2016 so there are a bunch of shows I also need to add
woke up. Immediately watched new Gundam episode. Think to myself: how much will Miorine open up to Suletta now? Oh,|| already using her phrases||
also, another bit of Utena: https://twitter.com/Nakayasee/status/1579038798867943424
favorite thing about Unicorn was having the newtypes fall in love at first sight and being obsessive shown as a bad thing. I know you for all of 10 minutes? "I want you to need me" "I don't need you"
yeah but Uso also had that helmet...
I don't think they'll do it since ||their relationship is so central to the plot as opposed to the others which are usually there for emotional support to cope with the trauma they're going through and their death doubles down on the trauma of war (or signifies a permanent/can't go back after it is over). || My speculation is that ||it will be the Aerial itself and/or perhaps Elan||
Heero was willing to self destruct at the drop of a hat. Like a stiff breeze would go by and he would be like "that's my cue to blow up my gundam"
https://twitter.com/ryugu_noisi/status/1578346443500183553 Wing is jealous
It is good stuff. Suletta is indeed a good girl but Aerial might be best girl
Being a child is liking things because you think they're cool even if they're silly. 
Growing up is putting away childish things and taking a more serious look. 
Being an adult is liking things because you think they're cool even if they're silly
True I forgot about that since I haven't watched Age since it came out becauss it was so bad. Don't remember how long was spent there. I remember the compilation movies had some time there but, like Unicorn, it was only like 30 minutes at most
unless they're going for an epic rug pull (where they blow quite a budget on the opening animation for it), I expect they'll use the school pretty exclusively for the next few episodes and probably have a breather episode or 2 with the politics and intrigue pushed to the back. Suletta still has to meet Chuchu and get friendlier with Nika after all
actually Build Fighters Try was the longest but that is also a vastly different type of story
Unicorn sticks with the school the longest and it was only something like the first 30 minutes of episode 1. I would say being a student is a background trait of quite a few protagonists but none have what I would call a school setting
even us veterans are in uncharted waters with the show since there are a few firsts with this series that throws things off from a typical Gundam. First sole female protagonist being chief among them and the school setting isn't something they've done before. Even forgetting that, the relationship being so prominent right at the start and being so central to the plot is different enough from the typical entry.

I've also seen you've also gotten some conflicting information but that is because we've had tons of different stories since 1979 and they've run the gamut of outcomes. Sometimes the couple is together and happy, sometimes one is maimed but they survive to live on together, sometimes one dies, and sometimes the conflict makes it so it just doesn't work out for them. We have educated guesses but not much else to assuage fears
Which is why the compilation movies focus on it
Well the second arc was the best of the show
I feel few do
yeah, the Frontier cast get a VHS containing what is essentially the show of 7. They occasionally cut back to the Frontier people making comments about it. Then they cosplay as Fire Bomber and hold a concert in the street
unless you count that weird recap thing they did with the Frontier cast watching the events of 7
7 doesn't get any
not for Delta. Frontier has 2 compilation movies and the original has 1
for Delta? 2. One compilation movie and one sequel
pretty sure they say what it was in the movie. Essentially first colony ship to leave Earth after the events of the original series. Lost while heading towards the center of the galaxy
*pushes up glasses* actually, ||Kira can sense Mu without seeing him and senses the presence of Rau in Rey indicating he is a true newtype. I read somewhere (although it may have just been implied) that the Ultimate Coordinator project used gene sequences from their donor (aka Mu's dad) to help create him ||
decently funny show. Some pretty famous out of context GIFs
she was raised on stories and stuff like anime while on Mercury. She probably wants to go through falling in love over dates and all the experiences a shoujo romance provides
I like how Suletta ||wasn't upset about the marriage thing because it was a girl but because she wanted to go on dates and cheating is wrong||. She is too precious
Especially with how Japan treats those with disabilities <:MikuWorry:672908523495227432>
Guel's dad is pretty comparable to Patrick Zala now that I think about. A little less romantic tension between Guel and Suletta than Athrun and Kira though
At first my mind went to Zala and was confused. I assume you mean Calasour?
That would be... something
I mean I absolutely think it was a non-expert writer out of their depth. I think a good writer would either do enough research or provide a good enough explanation. They don't have to go into Irregular at Magic High levels of depth and technobabble about it... although I wouldn't be against it because I enjoyed it there.

And writing a magic system to have a logical structure is different than an actual logical language like programming. I know this is going a bit afield with the example but David Eddings' Belgariad series has a very logical structures to the few magic systems it explains but the one we know the most, sorcery (aka the Will and the Word), uses natural language as an activation.

Also, I know I'm writing a lot of text dissing the show but that is just my bitterness towards not liking something that I should've loved. Don't let my pettiness over the story structure stop you from enjoying it
As someone who loves mecha, magic, magitek, and OP protagonists (so I like a lot of isekai too), it failed pretty hard out of the gate for me which is super disappointing since I was hyped as it should've been a home run for my basic tastes.

Motivation and almost every single thing he was good at or advanced he made was easily explicable in story of his privileged life though really killed it. Maybe the novels make it work or explain it better but I knew I was in for a rough time when they said the magic system was "like programming" but never explained how or why a medieval society discovered/developed a logical language
Except the advancements made (with the exception of jet engine type technology) were things that already existed in the world. Like the first "revolutionary" idea he had for the mecha was to twist the strands together to increase strength while not compromising integrity... something that was already well established in any era that has ropes like the world has already established it has.

The story specifically go out of their way to say people are more resistant to change but then add a mad scientist character from the world who uses the technology in unique ways that the MC doesn't think of.

The whole story would work better if they stopped trying to justify an isekai because the attempts come off half-assed. He grew up the son of a mecha pilot and a mage whose grandfather ran the school for building and piloting said mecha. Him being smarter/better at designing mecha and using magic already made sense. He also got saved at a young age by a mecha so, plus his background, him being obsessed with mecha and improving them was already baked into the story
Haven't watched sword isekai yet but it'll be hard pressed to take the "why was this even an isekai" crown from Knights & Magic
and can't forget the zero G naked boobies they had in every intro which was sometimes indicated as Murrue and other times Flay. And in the Astray manga it was said to be that woman from the Junk Guild
I mean, everyone got naked in those openings. Even the fairly conservative Lacus had multiple shots
which is why it is an interesting question to me since those are classic stories but might be obscure to others
most likely not although they have probably heard of Space Battleship Yamato and/or Captain Harlock
always curious when someone says something like that. What are your bounds for obscure or niche anime? Like Angel's Egg is decently well known among certain circles but I assume most people would consider that obscure. Queen Emeraldas is probably known if you follow Leiji Matsumoto but I doubt most people have even heard of it
definitely not a fan of the Xi. Stuff like that ZZ and The O are just too much
The eyes being round at the top throws me off for Aerial. I also didn't care much for it in the promos but in action it is sweet
I loved SEED mecha designs. I think SEED Destiny did better with the actual Gundams but worse with mass production models. Ginn > Zaku
coordinators do things better than naturals so...
just used what it is called in Japan. Plus Mitsuo Fukuda was the actual one who did the scene in Brave Exkaiser where that pose got it's start. He definitely attributes Obari among others for influencing that scene but he should get some credit

always enjoy more of the Brave Perspective (aka Sunrise stance)
Slow mo guys essentially did something like that. Made a video that was pretty much designed to mess with the compression
Youtube compression really hurts certain shots especially in the OP
well the creator of the graphics interface format says the acronym with a soft G so... <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
didn't know about that. Just read it. Weird
at least 3. It normally doesn't go for that though. ||00 was kind of an exception that did it as a|| progression of the main story. ||Build Divers Re:rise|| was for the crazy twist. And Evidence 01 in SEED is just kind of interesting little extra tidbit for George Glenn changing the world but otherwise meaningless
almost certainly not
ah. Gotcha
neat. But again, I'm going off of stuff I've seen from Japanese audiences and interviews. It may not have been the very first but Brave Exkaiser is the one that made it popular and seemed to start the trend which is why they call it the Brave Perspective
||Flay and Kira sleeping together|| was a pretty big controversy when it aired
even though Kira is a real name, it was based off the katakana for "killer" which is kind of ironic given his personality
Fuuka or bust
We did get Amagi Brilliant Park out of it but I still wanted them to continue FMP
And they had already done 2 seasons... and then announced they were working with the author again... and did a completely different story
I remember when I wanted KyoAni to do a series...
Random thought of g-witch while at work: Miorine making sure her groom is dressed properly is a nice girlfriend vibe
So Suletta was reading ||just outside of where Miorine was sleeping... did they share a bed?||
so an interesting parallel I just noticed between Vivid Strike and G-Witch, episode 4 ||is when both have a bully group get their just desserts. Vivid Strike is more one-sided and much more brutal but both are satisfying and well deserved for making such a sweet girl cry like that||
what a I realized about g-witch 4: ||no Suletta confusion to end the episode.|| ~~0/10. Unwatchable~~
Until recently, the only consoles I had were Nintendo and I took the Blu ray drive out of my PC years ago. Only just got a PS5 so I can watch Blu rays again... but I too am more interested in what is next to those symphogear Blu rays...
much cooler alias as well
I didn't think of Mu as one. Although Athrun does take the Quattro role in Destiny
we've also had 2 Char clones in the same series with each taking aspects from him so there could be another added
we've had Char clone related to the main character before. Although it wasn't known by everyone else until a good way in
Akiba Maid War is still pretty wild
just the way I like it
as posted in one of the replies, actually pretty realistic though https://fxtwitter.com/ebino_tobigeri/status/1584178970362187777
https://twitter.com/G_Witch_M/status/1585564460512600068
pretty sure the official G-Witch account had to put out a character sheet to show how Chuchu puts her hair in the helmet
Char shouldn't have been worried about souls being weighed down by gravity but the extra weight of them hands
G-Witch summed up as of the latest episode
Guel really just ||defended his crush's honor against his family's wishes because Suletta was crying. He is coming along to the protagonist side very nicely.||
That would be some Build Fighters levels of ridiculous... and I probably wouldn't hate it
Gundams are mobile suits but not all mobile suits are Gundams
Cosmic Era (SEED/SEED Destiny) it is the OS
Guel tanking ||his stock so Suletta can afford to buy||
I can see that a bit. Some of the art does role reverse them a bit based on how Suletta acts in the cockpit of Aerial
what did you expect?
https://tenor.com/view/awkward-stare-dog-stare-dog-brows-funny-gif-16229232
I like how they never address it but you can figure out that since she grew up as the only child on Mercury, that is the only punishment she really knows
the trainer MS is a collab between the 4
the 4 major houses all have different mecha designers to give each one a unique style and flavor
every Peil Technology mobile suit is designed by one of the mecha designers from Armored Core so that makes sense
AC4/AC For Answer remaster when?
have fun <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
prologue is on youtube. Parts of Asia/Oceania can watch the series there too. Crunchyroll otherwise I would assume
Gundam is consistently inconsistent
it is more clear in the prologue
might've been the most exciting part of the show honestly. Well, other than that first OP. Diver's High is a banger
and then he appears in every episode of Build Divers and Build Divers Re:Rise
https://tenor.com/view/leaf-anime-windy-gif-14210780
https://tenor.com/view/ai-hayasaka-together-blushing-anime-kaguya-sama-love-is-war-gif-17948041
What about best girl though?
Calling it bad just takes away from actually bad shows is all for me. It cheapens the word for when you want to describe something like Master of Martial Hearts or Popee the Performer
Vivid is worse just because it doesn't go anywhere and leaves you high and dry from setting up the next part. Like, I'm pretty sure it even says see you next season but it never happened

Vivid Strike is a nice self contained story that doesn't have all the baggage that you are required to have for Vivid
<a:HibikiAniDisgust:777603915716755457>
Akiba Maid War is still good but I kind of want the other shoe to drop soon
https://tenor.com/view/comic-girls-phone-scared-nervous-gif-15759502
one of the things that I've thought for a while ||(and why we don't see the markings on her since) was that if red permet is giving the data to the human (and killing them with a data storm), the blue might be uploading the data from the brain to the machine so the AI can use the pilot brain's template and act as though it were an extension. Aerial glowing might be it loading a copy of that brain scan to run through how she would act in that situation||.

That advanced ||AI companion could also share the burden of a regular permet score like Elan did last episode which is why it felt strange to him||.
There is a book by Robert Emmett McDowell called Red Witch of Mercury whose synopsis has very similar themes to many Gundam stories
I'm on mobile at work, so I can't find it right now but I'm pretty sure I have seen some confirmation of the years. Even so, Gundam usually doesn't have just one singular event be the crux. There is a usually a whole slew of socio-political build-up that would lead up the events of the prologue and I don't think they would ignore that forever
I think some people are letting their theories run away a bit for G Witch. We do have the Ad Stella calendar year the prologue takes place and when the main series takes place. Not impossible to reconcile some aspects of certain theories but definitely not others
Guel's VA today: ||https://twitter.com/azakami_youhei/status/1589228787140800514||
I'm surprised Re:Rise was at all popular though. It had the twist but I was pretty bored of the whole thing
they should've continued Build Fighters. The Divers formula is much worse
G Witch episode 6 spoilers <:AdamScream:688241618356404224>
at home after work and I can't find the calendar back up for my G-Witch claim so maybe I imagined it. I reread the short story and rewatched the prologue too just in case. 

Interestingly, I saw that the prologue indicates women are better suited for longer times in space due to less overall muscle atrophy. It may be a "men have more mass to lose" but it could be an in-universe reason for more women in space in this setting
What questions do you have now? I assume it helped with some things
As for the Valvrave stuff, I don't remember much of it because I was bored but it did give us Preserved Roses so at least one good thing came out of it
Imagine having 3 protagonists and only one of them decent
They should have invested into making the show not terrible
G-Witch after episode 6: ||https://twitter.com/sinadjaru/status/1589583897083654144||
Obviously I'll second things like Bofuri, Comic Girls, Nichijou, and Chihayafuru but one I didn't see that should be with those is Tsuredure Children
But not Zeta. Weird
not at all surprised but still pleased
I would describe K-On as almost Seinfeld levels of "it's a show about nothing" only with a positive attitude where the characters aren't such shallow jerks
not much changes from the translation I read but it is... interesting... to see how certain things are phrased and which words are chosen
I guess because Urusei Yatsura is a classic they can get away with such degeneracy
I was hoping Akiba Maid War didn't go there. ||Just gotta hope for the fake-out where she is recovering in a hospital next episode.||
I had forgotten about that. Man, what a POS
I know they wanted to make him unlikeable but they succeeded far too well
Along with pretty much every title with an X in it especially between two words. Hunter x Hunter, Kiss x Sis, High School DXD, and xxxHolic are all a silent X (because it is actually a cross symbol not the letter). The times an X is pronounced it is almost always a Z sound like Xenosaga, Xam'd, and RaXephon. 

The only ones I can think of where it is actually an X is... well X and the X-Men anime.
It is actually the fate of all the losers of the tournament too... that or ||driven insane or dead||. Very upbeat show until the final episode too
Yurp. Those reactions are about right
Well spoilers for a bad 5 episode OVA from 2009 I guess: ||allies are actually evil masterminds who did a ridiculously complex scheme to make the main character a sex slave because of something her mom did||
It was already pretty bad as an off brand Ikki Tousen before the jarring shift of the final episode
Master of Martial Hearts probably has one of the worst (in a memorable way) endings
https://tenor.com/view/char-aznable-quattro-bagina-zeta-gundam-i-came-to-laugh-at-you-gundam-gif-24795600
how do you feel about it?
yeah, I don't think we're going to see eye to eye on Gundam <:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
but if you build a car yourself, chances are you want to drive it. But sometimes there is someone better at driving than you
I mean it makes sense from a certain standpoint. The mechanic and driver aren't always the same
he comes from another planet/colony. It is never explained
the battle between Lucas Nemesis and Gunpla Academy had more strategy in it than the entire first season
RG system was X + more. Speed, beam weapon, or knuckle
I like both too. Just Try is the better one for me because it drops the stupid shit and focuses on battles between cool customized (and sometimes non-customized) mecha
doing the special move more was in original too. Build knuckle but harder
I mean Sekai does love gunpla. He actually gets more involved including learning how to repair the Build Burning after Shia teaches him. It's why he build his own by the end. 

And the constant obsession Sei has was grating. It is nice to know the Gundams without being told constantly about them. It is the difference between pandering and letting the work and it's history show for itself
Fighters was Yu-Gi-Oh with stupid "I'm going to try to attempt to kill these people and try to strong arm them into selling their busine-oh wait I lost in a children's game. I'm a good guy now and have seen the error of my ways" without the benefit of ancient Egyptian magic literally messing with people's minds

Try is a sports anime where the villains are less stupid and most are at least understandable jerks you play against in actual sports
Wait, when you say Try, you mean Build Fighters Try? I get I'm in the minority of people who like it more than Build Fighters but to say any part besides Asemu's arc is preferable (and especially Kio) is crazy
I mean, art imitates life imitates art I guess?
00 might've been billed as the first true "post 9-11" Gundam but Destiny had some great stuff with the fall of Junius 7
I mean after a huge terrorist event, people giving up their rights for the illusion of safety wasn't really that bad a plot point
really just scrap all the Orb drama altogether except for Shinn's hatred of it
bringing him back is fine but making him a main character was where it kind of lost it
Destiny was the Star Wars prequel trilogy but if they switched off Anakin as the main character because they realized people thought he was dumb
good intentions and nice protagonist leads to psyche breaking and becoming the thing the enemies think of him type of deal. He who fights monsters and all that
need an actual good, Gundam protagonist becomes villain story though since it was wasted in both Destiny and Age
but if I had creative control that is exactly what I would do. Change a bunch
compressing Destiny won't fix it. Gotta change a lot about it
dang. So no fixing Destiny
when you say no adaptations, does that mean no "this series but a movie"?
seeing the Island Wars reference to them was also cute
I think I made it clear I didn't like the plot outside the actual battles but Reiji and Aila though, I did like. Even if it was corny and dumb, the resolution was great
there is also a nice indirect reference in the Island Wars OVA about what he has been up to...
yeah. He was mentioned because the Build Burning Gundam was designed by Sei to be Reiji's if he ever came back
he had to be gone so he could... be gunpla police... I'm sorry "International Gunpla Battle Official Referee" <:hayasigh:600143346974851092>
I liked a few of the characters in Divers but mostly was disappointed with it. I really liked the OP, Diver's High though. Re:Rise was better and the twist was interesting but I'm not sure it holds up under scrutiny (I need to rewatch to make sure though) so it was kind of just "alright" to me. Tried to do something cool and I applaud it for that but didn't quite hit me right
nah, all good. I did ask after all
focus on the crew of a battleship/carrier too. Not the officers but enlisted and not the latest and greatest super-hyper unique battleship
Orb's system is dumb from the get go anyway
at least the Plants can claim coordinator superiority
the sequel has been in the works since Destiny ended. One of the writers had cancer though so it was postponed until recently re-announced. I am very much looking forward to it if only to see Kira in a white Zaft uniform  some more and what the politics around him and Lacus would be like
I'm hoping for an equivalent of an Erupting Burning Finger Sekiha Love Love Tenkyoken scene with those two
agreed but it is mainline Gundam
https://tenor.com/view/sweating-nervous-paranoid-gif-4974019
14 seasons in the NBA
Muggsy Bogues played in the 90s and he was only 5'3
I would hide behind her too. That punch was solid
It is specifically also hard to tell with names being weird most of the time. Even Mikazuki has Augus as his family name and the fact he grew up on Mars an orphan slave means he could not have any Japanese ancestry despite the show talking about his name meaning in Japanese
Wing focuses on the "AI bad" as a main part of the plot but, as pointed out above, doesn't do a great job with it
I feel like the way this is phrased you might actually agree? We have 18-20 episodes so it is still too early to tell. 

The way I view is that the cyber-newtype storyline is sometimes the focus that drives the plot but other times it is present to just solidify the idea that war/corporatism sucks and will exploit people of their humanity in disturbing ways and is really a background piece.

IBO does it with "AI bad" as it is part of a small arc with the Mobile Armor's history. But the show glosses over saying anything about it really and instead focuses on the response to it with the treatment of humans and integrating them into technology particularly via the Alaya-Vijnana System
That is the thing. They touched on that in Wing with a single line that rich people would essentially just be able to buy an army and war could become more widespread because the ease of accessibility of weapons. That is cool because it touches on real world problems and fears of the proliferation of certain technology.

But instead they then focus on Treize Douche-renada about the nobility of war and how human soldiers getting killed will somehow keep leaders honest? Like, cool Treize that you can name everyone that has died because of you but I don't think someone like Putin knows a single one
Also, lot of pretty definitive statements about what G-Witch is about only 6 episodes in when a lot of Gundam shows only briefly touch on certain subjects as window dressing to the setting and focus on other topics as the main theme
Wing's anti-unmanned kill machine message would've hit better if one the main reasons against it wasn't the idiotically naive idea that leaders would care about the lives of the troops they throw away for games of power
the Ranma OVA that went with this was a good one
also, regarding Miorine: ||she is going to be put in charge of the Gund-Arm Inc which includes buying out Peil, right? So will she learn the truth about El4n because the oversight of bioethical issues? Will she tell when she finds out? There is a brief shot of Miorine crying and turning away at the very end of the OP and I'm worried the two are related with Suletta not believing her or some fight ensuing between them because of this||
G-Witch: ||my Nika theory was off by a bit. Her surprise last episode when the back unit worked so well was telling but I thought maybe Prospera secretly worked on it. Turns out it was Shaddiq and I'm a little annoyed because she now has some flags on her that I didn't want her to have||
Pretty sure we now have at least 5 of the 7 episodes of G-Witch end with Suletta being confused
I can go on a limb and guess which one you mean based on context and which server this is but saying "the G episode" when referring to a comparison to Symphogear G and a Gundam show often shortened to G Witch is a tad confusing at first glance
||https://twitter.com/dha_315/status/1594297907569909762|| The memes for G Witch are so good
G Witch speculation:  Guel ||interviews for pilot https://twitter.com/tantei_in_chair/status/1594296705822126085||
I think she's coming around. Her reaction when ||Miorine started her presentation was relief and admiration. She a bit smitten and will probably be more so with her mom being so manipulative.||

Also worth noting Miorine has gone ||fully from "How will you take responsibility?" to "I will protect you"||
He posted about it an hour or so ago so no idea how good it is but just funny how the timing worked out
I will say, just very good timing. I have a friend who happens to be gay and posted that with essentially 'I think I'll give isekai another chance'
Like "The Other World's Books Depend on the Bean Counter"
I think either direction could be interesting. All depends on how it is written. With the main writer we have, who knows how that'll go
... so like the writer for Valvrave?
I don't think there are as many hints as you think... There are plenty of hints that something is going on and lies are being told. That doesn't mean they point to that theory specifically. It is probably the most popular one but not the only explanation
point is, they are intentionally vague. Hard to say for certain until they give definitive proof where we don't rely on what could be translation conventions
||Lfrith has always been referred to as a sibling of Eri||
I'm talking about the fortune telling
we should also remember that sometimes there are translation errors or ambiguities. Kyoudai can mean male or female siblings depending on the kanji. It also could be both if written in hiragana but was translated as brother in the translation. 

I shall wait and see before saying something is even almost a certainty especially with how coy they are being with the timeline
||pretty sure he just had his body modified not brain swapped||
well with the official translation of Cradle Planet ||it could be interpreted differently: "At present, there are no other children at Mercury"||
and ||Miorine definitely found it sus||
makes sense to me. They have been coy with the timeline so there is still some wiggle room but I've been of the opinion that boiling it down to one year/event doesn't make a lot of sense especially with how Gundam operates
that's why I specified that show in my response. He also wrote Code Geass so we could get a pretty epic ending. Hence my wait and see on this stuff
now I'm imagining an AU where Amuro stops Char from a colony drop. 
"Who taught you how to do this stuff?" 
"I learned it by watching you!"
after much procrastinating, I watched what was out for Bocchi the Rock. I have picked up many things and I agree with many like how Bocchi was indeed relatable, Kita is a sweetheart, and Ryo is hilarious. What I don't remember seeing is how Seika, the manager of Starry, is perfect. Because she is
Couldn't take the CCA dub seriously when Char called the titans the "tee-tans"
Akiba Maid War seems like it should've popped off a few times already but after the latest episode I don't see how long they can keep pushing it off
seriously, girl trains for opera but due to CVID (not to be confused with COVID) gets a severe lung infection and is hospitalized so long she is unable to walk and wrecks her lung capacity (also why her voice is naturally so high). 

Confined to her room because the risk of another infection, she is inspired to do vtubing from Kizuna Ai (and some anime) because she just wants to meet people but doesn't want people to know how sick she is and to treat her like a normal girl.

Becomes a success that allows her to pay for medication (and a new house so her parents who had to go back to work for her) and keeps up her motivation for physical therapy including to keep on her singing to where she now is able to sing in her opera voice for an entire song (plus some) again.

Replace opera with idol and you got yourself a winning character arc
they could lift Ironmouse's story wholesale for one of the characters for an easy hit on the emotions
from what I can pick up, some of the dialogue hints at it but most of the visuals definitely don't give a good idea of what the appeal of that show will be. It is from the artist who drew To Love Ru where the main character gets turned into a girl pretty much in the first chapter. So like Ranma 1/2 but he doesn't change back and they go hard on the ecchi
I also took it as ||they were each missing limbs so they couldn't do anything... by themselves. Took good coordination and teamwork to snipe||
https://tenor.com/view/llenn-gun-sword-art-online-alternative-gun-gale-online-gif-11803115
they're definitely doing more of the Star Trek thing where physical appearance (or gender) doesn't matter much anymore. Although obviously not quite as enlightened due to the corporatism and class divide between people of Earth and space
my shoutout is to Lilique for that rivalry out of nowhere
I'm sure it will. May have to import (like the Symphony SEED one) but Japan definitely likes to keep old formats and physical copies
I am not that into music and have bought only a single CD in my life. I may get this one. Ironically, that other CD I got was the Gundam SEED CD from the London Symphony Orchestra
yeah, ||I've been holding off on buying into the popular theory but that combo definitely made me go "uh oh"||
... they are very different series. Very much apples and oranges
Why did Akiba Maid War have to be like that? ||Why it gotta make me feel things?! As obvious as it was, it was still sad...||
Much better when I rewatched it after watching the previous series but it was my first and didn't get why so many loved it so much
Part of it for me is that it leans in too hard into it being the 25th anniversary of Macross and becomes a bit too referential to older series
As much as I like that part, I do laugh a bit at how much people scream names during it
I'm curious which arc you are referring to. I assume the battle on the islands before Josh-a or is what happens in Josh-a part of that?
well no episode next week so you got some time
Saint Seiya and Sailor Moon both had musicals start in the early 90s
he seemingly blames the system and not himself for any decisions made though. His goal is noble but dude is like the OG incel
hopefully Hathaway learning self reflection...
no word on the third part having any changes (if they even know). I assume it'll have the same ending though
producer didn't get into details about what changes just that the second part will have them. It is funny to me though that he used the summer Olympics as a time frame. 'It may not be around for Paris but will be completed before the 2028 Olympics in LA.'
but hey, you could watch the first 5 or so minutes during the plane scene since that is pretty sick. Then skip to when the characters are running from a mobile suit battle on foot. That perspective on the normal battles you see is bonkers and a visual delight
Supposedly there will be some differences from the novel but no idea if it means any major changes
The first movie no and it makes me hate him more because his attitude. We'll see if the second movie does when that gets released... between 2024 and 2028 (no I am not joking, that is the time frame they gave)
so.... why isn't it next week already? I want that Akiba Maid War
they should've brought back thirsty Ash. Like when he joined Brock admiring that popular girl in the school
(I'm not really glad. I would risk if I could)
I'm glad. It's my birthday this weekend
G-Witch would really have to drop the ball to lose anime of the season/year for me. Spy x Family has continued being amazing, Bocchi has been great, and Akiba Maid War is a trip and a half but G-Witch is the first show since XV where I **had** to watch it as soon as it aired. I don't know the last time a show did that for me in the first season
I thought the final final final would be a movie. Or was that just a rumor?
yet still infinitely better than Flit who still simps for Yurin more than his own wife
Wonder about Asemu and Kio though. Kio almost certainly shorter than most but Asemu always seemed decently tall
Heero being so short is kind of hilarious. At least Uso has an excuse of being 13
different strokes and all. I cared more about the random stuff happening than the plot like ||Twilight meeting Desmond|| in the final episode. I enjoyed it immensely
season 2 and movie in 2023
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbbCX5kAMss
calling for CSM remake reminds me of when a Chicago Blackhawks fan wanted a redo of the NHL playoffs. It became a very good pasta
the ending was so rushed but I don't think it would help much to expand. Maybe a little more for the epilogue but even then...
what is weird to me is how many people are excited about the story when it was pretty universally panned as a bad arc when it came out in the manga. Did the anime change that much to make it better?
so when talking about the "if you owned a studio" prompt, I debated putting "In Another World with my Smartphone" season 2 as a troll. Turns out is actually getting a season 2? So I guess I got trolled
"why are people having these reactions? Let me look it up. Oh, cute cover. Now let me just read the synopsis... 

Jesus Christ"
Clearly ordered from least to most romantic <:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>

and are we gonna pronounce it "hiatus ex hiatus" or "hiatus hiatus" <:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
a less likeable, antagonistic Mikazuki now that I think about it
Full Frontal has the excuse of ||being "created" that way|| while Angelo is just kind of sycophantic psychopath so I always treated him as worse
I guess you said "one of" so <:HibikiWhoops:585839808115507222>
not Angelo?
All I remember from 0083 is the OP and fat Gundam
I know he is part of the Trash Taste podcast but I wish he (and Joey and Connor) would realize they didn't have to live up to the name so much
Surprised Made in Abyss made it that high. Didn't hear as much about it compared to season 1. But maybe I'm biased since I thought it was boring
hey, it's one of the reasons I said I wanted a season 2
I flip between 7 and Delta being my favorite
Frontier was my first Macross and didn't get the appeal. I watched all the others and liked it more but still the least of the full series. Zero is probably the worst for me (or 2 if you count that)
artificial singers was in Plus which was the year after 7
https://tenor.com/view/macross-leaves-gif-5399703
7 has psychic space vampires who are weak to music under certain circumstances and a mech that shoots speakers piloted with a guitar. Shit is wild
I mean, I feel I should point back up to my talk about canon and how little it means. Macross has never been consistent. Macross 7 is completely different than the original series and pulls from both the original series and DYRL as sources. Delta fits in just fine with everything Macross has done up to this point
it is all mix-and-match based on what the creator thinks works best and all variations are "canon" to a Japanese perspective. We can dislike it all we want but I would try to avoid getting too mad at it since you can step into a cultural imperialist mindset that way
it's why DYRL was implied to be a movie in universe in later works... but plot point happen based on events from it
of course, that is all the western perspective too. Japan doesn't really care about canon so calling them retcons is kind of meaningless
pretty sure 7 implied the whole weakness thing. Then again, 7 also had soundforce which was stupid and "retconning" it to be biological fold waves was a decent compromise
I think of Mirage like a coach in a sport. Lots of the best athletes make bad coaches because they see and can do things so naturally. It is the hardworking, mid-level guys that end up being good coaches
I mean that was pretty much one scene in the movie continuity so hard to say how "god-tier" she is. And I think it was an extension of her being good at the technical aspects of a fight and knowing what to do in the manual versus actually being able to perform
Although Mirage's VA did do a really good job with that confession scene
Kawamori didn't want a triangle in Delta. Executives forced him. So that's why he gave a pretty bare minimum and it was obvious who Hayate was going to choose
you can be wrong. It's okay
Vivid Strike is good. More boxing-type sports focus and a tighter character story with thematic elements from the original series
Vivid is a disappointment because it is an adaptation of a manga that leaves off in the middle of things happening. It is part shonen action tournament arc and half sports anime
... you don't know Ghost in the Shell?
he is involved in every Armored Core
that is a long list. Aquarion, Eureka Seven, Escaflowne, Future GPX, AKB0048, Ghost in the Shell, Gundam 0083, Patlabor, and Outlaw Star just to name a few
https://tenor.com/view/macross7-macross-wink-fly-kiss-kisses-gif-13326679
can I settle for Vtuber rock band?
they need to go off the path again
idol > rockband > AI > tribal(?) > dueling idol > idol group
yeah, Nanoha is another one where I can point to what I was saying about Macross that "canon" is western concept which the Japanese don't really adhere
Vivid Strike has one of those moments with some bullies. If you watched G Witch and thought Chuchu didn't go far enough, you'll be satisfied with how Vivid Strike handles it
that middle one is the one I'm talking about. The smug face to realizing just who she's dealing with
episode 25 did have one of my favorite hype scenes for a while... it doesn't look so good now but it still holds a special place in my heart
26
they tried to focus on the new characters and give them their thing but also tried to bring the story back to Nanoha and Fate with Vivio so there wasn't enough time for everything
I mean, she was in it. Just wasn't exactly the focus... except when she was. Which was the problem with StrikerS: way too many characters
I realize why they did change VAs but the new Anos VA lacks the oomph of the original and it makes me sad. Still a good start but his words just lack that little flair
because people need constant dark things happening and can't/don't understand subtlety. Some school episodes or dealing with bullies = light-hearted
if you think you'll like Nanoha as more of a sports anime with shonen battles, sure. Vivid is alright if you like Vivio and won't mind a lack of ending (it was based on a manga). Vivid Strike is better but leans more into the sports aspect
still reminds me of a funny interaction which answers your hypothetical question: My instructor for submarine fire control systems was asked "How gay is life on a submarine, really?" and he responded "On a scale from 1-10? Pretty gay"
well I started watching MagiRevo last week after quite a few people talking about it. Just watched episode 2 and I gotta say it is cute and gay and I like it so far
just to note: nuclear reactors, unless designed like an idiot, don't explode. They just produce heat (and radiation) and, if designed/maintained poorly, so much heat that safeguards melt. The explosions are usually steam explosions (not always radiation contaminated water) from overheating and the mass damage from Chernobyl was from graphite fires due to the graphite neutron moderators
yep. And his phase shift armor got used more because Kira was more accurate and hit him with things like the railguns
that's kind of what I was pointing out above. Using Variable Phase Shift, Voiture Lumiere, Mirage Colloid, and the weapons in a long battle (especially the heavy use when fighting Strike Freedom) made it so it kept dipping into battery power to keep up with the load
I'm not sure if it "started" it but it is an earlier example of that kind of name working well
I think it was just a natural progression with things like OreImo. Kind of a synopsis as the title which gets attention especially on webnovel sites where a lot of these originate from. ONce someo f the simple ones got taken, people had to be a bit more elaborate
oh. That one was so short it barely registers. I was thinking along the lines of "I'm A High School Boy and a Successful Light Novel Author, But I'm Being Strangled By A Female Classmate Who's A Voice Actress And Is Younger Than Me"
which title are you referring to?
active sonar helps especially with ranges but there is some funny stuff that happens with sound in water due to temperature and salinity that can change it. Not noticeable when using a fish finder on a lake but a lot more trouble in the middle of an ocean
not fully but since I was actually a qualified sonar operator on submarines in the Navy, I dealt with the actual thing a lot. Essentially, sonar gives a bearing for a noise. How far away that noise is takes some work and identifying it is a bit of a skill. It is not radar. An actual sonar display looks something like this:
at least there is pushback and knowledge about nuclear power. Sonar has pretty much no one advocating for it which is why I get annoyed about it
nuclear power is something pretty much everyone gets wrong in media. That and sonar
the big explosion after Freedom gets impaled which is implied that it is the Tannhauser but later shows Kira using the nuclear reactor cutoff like it would explode like a nuke comes to mind
Destiny was in shorter battles and during the final battle, it was launched pretty much last. Orb was a long siege with Destiny throughout much of it
nah. The explanation is that the power load for constant heavy use of the wings of light (among the other weapons) was more than what could be recharged
I prefer OP1 (although both are great) but the ED has improved
yeah. And modern reactor designs use methods of automatically shutting down where, even overheating and without power, the fission reaction is stopped and control rods cooled
I have a sudden urge to watch this show...
he did the line which means today is a good day
Sasuga Anos-sama
okay. I know they were also called un-human by Blue Cosmos
you talking about Patchworker or a different one?
throws it off with it being a guy reincarnated as a girl. Although the dynamic they've done with that hasn't been bad (apologizing for his past life)

also the show has been quite fun so far
Studio Orange is pretty great for CG anime. Although the choice to remove Milly and add some cliche named "Robert De Niro" (no, really. That's his name) is a baffling choice since the character dynamics are all screwed up and not nearly as good as the original
I like that in SEED Destiny, he gets called Jesus by the fans and then in Symphogear he starts walking on water
today is a good day for cute, wholesome shows. Magirevo and Bofuri brightening my day. Even the ED for Bofuri is precious
How far gone am I when I think "ah yes, Yosuga no Sora"
Usagi Drop because it is anime only. Definitely not any manga that has more story
if you haven't watched it, Chivalry of a Failed Knight is like Asterisk War but good
<a:BikkiBetrayal:658020710974750721>
I never put 2 and 2 together that Orange worked on Majestic Prince but it totally makes sense
That's symphogear mentality right there. "You don't have to like it but give it a fair chance"
Bi erasure be real. Really stupid it's a thing but humans be stupid
not sure about other countries but it released in the US on the 20th
just got back from Slime movie. It was certainly an anime movie
yeah. Just a lot of timing factors to consider. I just wish more people played. It's pretty fun and has replaced Overwatch as my hero shooter
considering development time and the delays, it makes sense for the Nu especially with how popular CC is. I don't think they knew how popular G Witch was going to be either. I'm sure they hoped but it wasn't a guarantee
they just need to add Witch suits into the game... And maybe a new map
I wonder if I'll get used to Hero-King's OP going so hard...
Captain America -> main hero who wears red, white, and blue -> Mario
Thor -> medieval weapons and magic -> Link
Iron Man -> power armor -> Samus
nah. Nintendo knows that they have to do the standalones before their big team-up fight. They're not DC
where is our remake Nintendo?
just changes the formula enough of regular Gundam but has purpose with it and executes it well
I did watch in the middle of binging every Gundam series so the change of pace was very refreshing for me. I think it is also one of the reasons I like G-Witch so much
the ending really sells it for me. The kid who was absolutely annoying ||crying with his excited classmates|| around him? The best Gundam's antiwar messaging has ever been
I preferred War in the Pocket compared to 8th MS Team and 0083. But I like the Kampfer and hamburgers...
*looks very meaningfully at The Simpsons*
They like maple syrup and hockey is their favorite sport. They got better taste than the US for sure
the 3D fight was a bit awkward though
Maple is a menace to the devs and I love it
I did kind of like hero-king to extraordinary squire address some issues like the fact that they are creeped out by all the guys leering at her and apologizes for their past life behavior if they made any women uncomfortable
Anos the ultimate speed reader. What a guy
Even when it hurts the story it doubles back on certain ideas. Ernie coming up with new designs (that are actually really basic and should be pretty obvious in-universe) and the reason people don't listen is because people are set in their ways and more resistant to change than our world....

Except later they introduce a rival who makes just as crazy designs (if not crazier) and an entire nation is just cool with it. Plus the history contradicts it where the mecha had to be made in the first place and timeline wise, they are pretty much set to introduce a new generation of mecha
It should've leaned into the isekai more or get rid of it. There are a lot of story elements that seem like it justifies motivation or reasons for skills but they double back on it and imply "because isekai"
I don't remember if I ranted here about Knights and Magic. I was supremely disappointed with it because it should've been a slam dunk for my tastes. Lots of little things annoyed me too much though
Suzu is ||horniest girl ||
other than a popular recent show, probably not. At least not much more than having Anizawa Meito from Lucky Star in that group
Solomon unified Alma Torran before it was destroyed by Ill Ilah, right? <:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
yeah and they aired on the same day and I think the same time slot. You'll see how they differentiate themselves though. Even when they have similar arcs, the way they eventually treat those characters is different
huh. CSM blu rays are also cheaper than Bocchi, Lycoris, and Spy x Family
MagiRevo dragon be like
I like they show the devs being happy for once and making sure we know they're not vindictive or anything
Bofuri is an absolute treat
it looks like someone had just read/watched Trigun and wanted to make Wolfwood into a Heavy Arms copycat
I have only heard of it talked in hushed tones
"what if Mineva was just the worst?"

reminds me of Red Frame MSV where Lowe uses the BuCUE head
I wouldn't be surprised if he likes the Character Theater version of his character more either
I would be worried about anyone who preferred their anime counterpart
I also didn't like their take on Zaku, Gouf, and Dom. They had their own unique designs before. Sure they weren't crazy different but I would much rather see more offshoots from the Cgue or the Guaiz than another stupid UC mobile suit
why they kept Sting alive and added 3 more Destroys....  <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
also, they had to add Destroy. Desitny was new Zeta so they had to give their Four a Psycho Gundam. It's like... a law or something
I didn't think the kick was bad because I like adding weapons to the legs and the beam blades like that are are cool. I just wish he used it more. Really the IJ was criminally underused overall. It wasn't until Final Plus that we got use of the shield's grappling hook outside of the OP
do I see Relena wearing Zechs' mask?
seems like good education
so like some of the Macross entries like DYRL
I looked her up and her first listed role is freaking Lain from the eponymous Serial Experiments. That is a hell of a debut series
some might say those warm, kind hands did more than save her
Re:Rise references back but generally is a standalone like Fighters and Try
Yeah Divers doesn't really have anything going for it... except the OP. I liked Diver's High
I've watched it but don't talk about it since I was pretty ambivalent on it. I didn't buy into the midpoint plot point. I know 1 but maybe 2 people here seem to really like it
2 things I liked about MagiRevo's latest episode: 1) her parents still trust her despite being such a weirdo problem child. 2) a tattoo procedure is shown and it was actually painful
it... it did not work
yep. It has the first episode or 2 pretty much there, a couple plot points from the rest of the 45ish episodes, and then the final episode
F91 has the slightly repetitive name F91 Gundam F91
yeah, it grew until sometime after Hathaway with the collapse of the Federation where they couldn't afford the larger material costs and had breakthroughs in miniaturization
episode 9
I still need to watch it. Maybe next weekend. I've been watching 86. It's alright
Leonmichelli from Dog Days and Charlotte Yeager from Strike Witches too
that top row alone...
the quick and dirty thoughts on 86: I think how the story was told in the first half hurt the show when it was an interesting story. The latter part was told better but the story was boring. Ending was good though. Overall, it was alright
86 done. Now to start on Lycoris Recoil
for Bofuri's latest episode: Mii embarrassed because she was so excited to show off her pet was super cute
||handholding|| was very lewd
he goes a different route with it at least. He's also the token manly man of the guild so he's pretty lucky to ride the wave
I can't wait to have Suletta Sundays back
more people concerned with the help of Kyoji over God
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEzte98sl9M
the english dub of "this hand of mine burns with an awesome power" lives rent free in my brain
and they were roommates!
been okay so not surprised no one really talks about it (or has dropped it). Lots of "wow she's OP" and "they eat a lot" gags which get repetitive. Still, MC is different enough and the opening is still really catchy
also Hero King to Extraordinary Squire:  <a:YangFingergun:753096695344136242> <:HibikiFingerguns:688429715836502063> <a:YangFingergun:753096695344136242> <:HibikiFingerguns:688429715836502063>
guess I'll get those LNs...
the kids love that one
I guess that kills the theory that the new series is actually set in the future and the new lead girl is actually Ash's kid
Ah. So you're in the home stretch
Last two episodes of the series or the last 2 episodes you watched?
Started off really liking it. Filled in some gaps and had some cool designs. Obviously some contrivances involved (Lowe saves Kira on that beach) but generally acceptable. Then it started introducing more and more overly designed mecha and they lost the plot (probably didn't help that Destiny also lost it). Stuff tying in with Stargazer like Delta made me wash my hands of it. The mecha design I saw from after made me feel I made the right choice
https://tenor.com/view/chefs-kiss-french-chef-perfect-dish-excellent-food-perfection-gif-20341505
