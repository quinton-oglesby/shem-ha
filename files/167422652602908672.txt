If u just download adblocker and go on a less legal streaming site you can get rid of the ads on the sides ezpz
Cause of the interruption
It ruins the song and battle imo
It hurts to have ads appear when ur in a climactic part of the show
In between time stamps of the episodes
If u can deal with the pain of ads
Yea same
You should probably watch from season 1 cause they all connect to the previous one way or another
^ unless your wondering how to watch it as in seasons then it goes 
Symphogear(no abbreviation) ‚Äî> G‚Äî> GX‚Äî>AXZ‚Äî> and the current final season XV
puchohenza da
thy pictures shall be seent
a little more does not hurt
It‚Äôs more elfnein with carols body ?
Since she uses her shared memories
Maybe she got some back after fusing with elfnein
I mean it looks like she still remembers about being a slayer of miracles
All that matters rn
Carol bak
Make Hibiki bring back her oraoraora from axz
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
And joins Song
What‚Äôs gonna be more is people trying to figure out whether Miku becomes evil or gets a new gear
Rip autoscorers
Shenshojing gone
Just give Miku a gear ://
JOJOOOOO
She comes out
Guess carol is jsut when elfnein has to fight
Cause u hallucinate
When u use ur strongest move on a level one noise

like the memory peeking jawn
so she prob only comes out when something threatens her or elfnein
she gave elfnein her body but now they're like two in one
yea
bc carol already burned all of her memories during the fight with the gang
isnt it more carol running on elfnein's memories
Maria and Serena play a big ass role
999,999 dmg

its carol with elfnein's eyes
yea
crazy boul
mans ver had an iq of like 500

just play xdu
heuhuehueh
<:Ver:336656981144109066>

anybody else find the dainsleif sound oddly satisfying
where they told her to not worry and not to rush
i mean it kind of happened when she went through that phase with the ignite module
High metabolism

They scrapped Kirika's first henshin cause it was too lewd
<:MikuGay:336656810788388864>
and Kirika's henshin was the result
Some gave a man too much power

She been dehydrated for over 4 years
Hey doesn‚Äôt sound like Miku would hate it
That‚Äôs what I meant
Grab her hand
Yea
O
Just gotta fist her like usual
O boi
With unstable regressing problems
Basa god
That would mean his whole family line are part god
Off screen is dangerous
Miku can't be if she is though I wouldn't mind personally
ofc she isn't
I think we‚Äôve established that she‚Äôs a walking cheat
Ain‚Äôt move a single step
Yep
Thanks
New Miku song plz
Miku got plot armor
lmao
cause only Hibiki has done it so far, but we know Amalgam is possible for everybody
they are  capable
Everybody pullin out Amalgam?
