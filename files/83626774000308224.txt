Sawano and Trigger always go well together
<:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
something something old clothes, coming of age
they drew most of my faves too
was gonna try and find sources as not to bog down shirabot, but i forgot this artist nuked everything
oh god i have well over 2000 ryukos saved
She is
a lot of them are a little much for sfw tho
forgot i can now legally post spooky ryukos

ye
wasn't even an iron cross either

Thanks <@!263983345669505025>
perfect touch
chris kicking bikki forward
god, that miku birthday comic
A lot
I like this trend
https://twitter.com/GurepyonArt/status/1204920033945833472
bagpipes intensify
classic sawano
why do you think everybody has a key to her apartment
chris is the enabler
<:MikuGay:336656810788388864>
coincidentally also looks like a wing sometimes
the worst heroic stain
a heroic stain
so we're getting cyber ver right
no
The second part is when it stopped even trying to hide how dumb it was
Hell yeah
Same with cross ange
And group watching symphogear is a blast
I wanna host a showing at my local con cause nobody ever does
I give it a yes
maybe her memory of who she is is elfnein's memories of carol
I mean it's about time she could properly fight with bikkie
Wish I could but work
Mikugear would be great
Idek it's just my favorite joke for this season
Ver after he comes back
I genuinely enjoyed how shameless it is
lmfao
If you told me this show was gonna be about a bunch of girls fighting the illuminati headed by satan who wants revenge on ancient aliens, I wouldn't believe it either
Yeah it's all coming together way better than I'd have expected going into the series
The beginning? I thought it was just the specials
Carol coming back I called the episode prior
Yeah really
Calling it here, Tsubasa is going to break out of it at some point and get a Kanade ghost power up
tomato mom is actually an apple from potato land
>eve sisters
>song passed down through the family
>named after the forbidden fruit

gdi
yami elfnein
except when we do
It's alchemy, we don't gotta explain shit
They're even posing as who they got beat by
gib nana mizuki
if only love deterrence got into smush
Symphogear edition
Everyone is here
Also this season so far is just
Never say it wasn't on purpose, let people think ur genius
Just to get jam'd
I'd go gay for Hibiki
Slipped my mind until that point that Miku was her first friend
I aim to please
Have fun with that mental image
fuudogear
gonna get befriended
ywn pinch elfnein's cheeks
I'd ask how but I'm afraid to find out
Never said I had good aim tho
True Colors as well
She sings in english well, though
Miyuki Sawashiro's intentionally butchered English is a thing of beauty
So there's gotta be attachment there
idk tsubasa has so many things that are just ripped from her actual life
She's doing her best
is that a challenge
god i hope the specials cover chris's birthday
Except maybe rainbow flower
Nothing gets me pumped like g beat
And I still think it's got some if the best songs in the series
GX sorta peaked halfway through but boy did I enjoy its peaks
Fist comes out
answer phone with dess
*calling card*<:TsubasaSmug:585839805737467920>
Adam ordering pizza in that one special was fantastic
That's what really bites honestly
Bikkie got bodied but I enjoy how it was executed
Okay but that moment was sick
yami elfnein
honorary member
The credits is what worries me
<:HibikiShock:336656371611074580>
i-is miku gone
They must have some bad blood between them
noble red is on death's doorstep atm cause fudou
does carol take usb-c
dude alchemy lmao
ctrl c ctrl v on point
yami elfnein
Honestly the Chateau and Carol are ridiculously powerful if you think about it
The Chateau can already do that in theory
genocide but also genocide
...sort of
although hibiki and miku is like the straightest thing going on in this show
They always are
specials will be gay enough
This is the important question
ok but does she get a song
<:KirikaSmug:607742561414676517>
There's no way space isn't happening which would mean top dad would be the easiest bingo
Figured
did we technically get punching god or not yet
Does anyone have bingo cards btw cause I know docking just got crossed off
First I've heard it too
Again?
I love it
Bikkie is super robot protag manly
I think there was a point in either G or GX where he wanted to step in, but the chain of command would fall apart if he did
dude can kick geah ass how has he not stepped in more
i do really hope genjuro fights for real
a kazanari not being ripped as hell is unheard of
she's also just *dess*scythe
yknow ver's whole "it's love" thing actually being 100% on point for the missing part of linker still messes with me
ywn watch CHOMP for the first time again
The amount of dumb cliffhangers it smacks you with cements that
Yeah there's no arguing that one
that's like half the fun
That was a damn trip
Kinda surprised nobody put G first
Yeah, but I love media rife with flaws
+ ignited versions
i still really really enjoyed gx but a huge part of that is carol and all the fantastic songs
she's flashy
idk they just don't stick in my mind for some reason
honestly the only shirabe transformation i can remember is gx because of the one part of it i know was put in for all *those* guys
~~chris doesn't strike me as a bottom~~
tbh chris' sequence got me watching grenadier
bikkie
that's just like your opinion, man
i just enjoy sugita meme man
i'm just fucked up over how the secret was *oxytocin* and nobody knew
edge works has some piano that tickles the ol' 2hu fan in me
yo edge works tho
something something wild arms
hell bikki songs in general
ignite g beat is my go-to if i need to get pumped
unless filters
It sounds like g beat was rerecorded cause that's a way different sounding bikki
same with ginwan airgetlam
ignite g beat is pretty nice
***CYBER VER***
idk who'd be hammier
Him and Mamoru Miyano are VAs I always enjoy
sugita is a legend
realistically the most likely thing ver would get is some sort of thing he may or may not have done to the chateau
same here although not with the k-on lives
VA stuff is just icing on the cake for me
The autoscorers are all pretty great in that department
But even every bit part has a great VA
I mean yeah
jesus christ
>throwaway
>got sugita to voice him

...what was the voice acting budget for this again?
fuckin shirou
i mean it's an argument over which opinion is correct so it's kinda just moot
feels like it's time to rewatch
is it time to rewatch
i was just thinking about it lmao
afaik anyway
and still horrendously underpaid
and then there's animators
pretty sure gx ye
at least in name
somehow never heard nana before geah
just the show in general
<:TsubasaSmug:585839805737467920>
Sicc
Oh you main Ike too?
I'd drop my three game main for bikki
I'd really love a gear game tho
gdi i *just* bought three houses and astral chain drops that soon?
oops all souls games
What the hell
>108CAD before tax
~~ghost ver~~
wait
Half expecting a ghost Kanade power up for Tsubasa at some point
Eternally topping charts
>nana wills herself to stop aging
so this... is the power... of a top artist... whoa...
What will really be messed is if they find a way to bring Fine back from *erasing herself*
<@279341087494242304> was just thinking ghost ver in general, kanade obv makes more sense
Yeah but will XV have the DMJii tank? I think not
~~bikki just kept getting more handsome~~
Bikki eyes still bug me in s1
dekinai-chan.jpg
I secretly hoped an artist I suggested the series to might've drawn some stuff if he liked it
Nichijou will give you a crash course fir example
Years of weebery isnt as important as what you actually watch
tfw slowly learning to pick up jp puns
The amount of editing that can get pushed into the reaction panel is nuts
Ye
I haven't seen a blue screen since G's chart
gaijin 4koma will never go out of style
kinechri
Store exclusives <:ChrisEnraged:423196924368388105>
I'm a fan of Exterminate in everything but name
Beef Stroganoff (Ignited Ver.)
Ignited G Beat is sick
Hey
Did Ignite ever not cause problems
you're right, all it takes is a little rururira
tfwnot enough time for geah training montage
Honestly it'd be such a martial arts cliche that I'd be surprised if it didn't happen
If Genjuro fights, I can't see him fighting anyone besides Fudou
more yukachi songs tho
maybe
she took like maybe one step
Those Maria stitches <:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
But I guess individual shields is more work than just pressing the B button
Maria has pretty strong defensive capabilities with Airgetlam as well
Just occurred to me
You know, Bikki getting sapped might have played into Shem-ha awakening
<:MikuBliss:336657233712513024>
that makes time for geah training montage
Geah action shots, menacing looking shem-ha, someone sinking into water during their inner monologue
It'd just be upscaled 720p
There was an attempt
The fact that it happens gives away enough
we are homeless
i miss food
Ye
Banana horns
Oh no
>top dad
Boy who likes mecha anime here, that was sicc
what if top dad actually gets to do something really good
yeah but did you see india
oh well that's a lovely surprise
random movies is a possibility
Ok you got me there
How the hell is anyone supposed to react when their daughter tells them "yeah my ~~wife~~ best friend turned into god and might be gone forever"
I mean to be fair
The jobber squad got killed off so unceremoniously
So I'm late to the party, but Jesus
i feel like i should be able to connect the dots on what the hell his endgame is besides dude japan lmao
considering "haha kill me tsubasa and become a monster"
i mean he doesn't seem to value himself more than his ideals either
...yeah it really wasnt huh
something something weak something something necessary sacrifice for nippon
kinda thought the bat emoji was a giveaway
i uh
saint germain liqueur is on sale where i'm at 🤔
damn ok my timeline might be a little off
They've been building it up since pretty much the moment Fudou was revealed as the guy behind everything
who knows what bs vanessa will pull for the geahs
they've outlived their usefulness to big bad so they're not really necessary *to him*
oh no i mean
idk fudou was already pretty done with them
Vanessa is the only one I can see feasibly surviving
i like their designs more than the alchemists tho
whoops
Well somehow that idea flew over my head with everything they crammed into 24 minutes
but idk
so this... is the power... of gacha money... woah...
idek how much material for this series hasn't ever been translated and i'm afraid to know
Yeah holy crap
Understandable
I know they have diet commie AXZ
Not really in the loop on YT, did they have plans to do the whole series eventually?
Such is the Curse of Balal
Lone enka singer saves emperor records
Oh I'm just commenting on how they just kinda blatantly took bits of Nana Mizuki and wrote Tsubasa
yeah but how much of tsubasa is just straight up nana
or are they very different sounding
unrelated but am i deaf or is there no bagpipes in all loves blazing
(just limit your selection to 3 or 4 cause holy hell does hit everything)
You could also illustrate that it sits in the middle of this venn diagram of genres. Only useful if they're already into anime
I asked for people's pitches yesterday in the spoiler free chat and "singing mecha lesbians" is a pretty damn good way to catch attention ngl
<:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
magical girl is the biggest barrier in my experience
top mech
like i tend to leverage the mecha side of things a bunch because i know a lot of mecha/super robot nerds
though there's a bunch of people who just aren't gonna like the show and you just gotta come to terms with that
approach from other angles
or just
you gotta have pitch to garner interest
>resurrecting people to use as puppets
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
Oh man I forgot that
They even call each other their sunshine and stare intently at one another as they eat dinner like heterosexual best friends do
haha what are you talking about they're just normal best friends who do normal best friend things haha
Fair point
There's always going to be art and doujins
Baiting it gets people going more than actually doing it so idk
idk why i dont have that screencap on hand
hibiki_never_had_a_boyfriend.jpg
comfy hibimiku
I do really like your pic btw
<:CarolShock:430939013235474432>
there's nothing that hits the same kind of cute note like it does
yuri gives me life
smh topdad
how could you leave that
yall mind if i spoil the entire season
nana's will be done
does nana will it
I'm down for a full-on series like the specials
eg movies, shinai series etc
If there's something I'm holding out hope for it's spinoff content
get everyone to dock, go full yuri
What if we just get s1's whole grave visit again but roles are reversed
She's just fashionably late
Like noble red
Yeah but I can't even tell what they're trying to bait
what's with this mood whiplash for the preview images
supeisu dandii wa uchuu no dandii de aru
Heavencloud
Zeus but he's behind content id
That'd be another way that Zeus could fuck everyone
Imagine gods owning copyrights
Odin
It's almost like the series was built on throwing mythological references around left and right
I'm only not kidding at all
make a show and cast only sugita
AI DESU YO
Hibiki already whips out drillsevery other ep
Still doesn't top the DMJiimobile
It's great
The specials poked fun at how blatantly gay miku's song was in G

Spoiler tag and mention they're xv spoilers
What's any of this
Jozai senjou
I mean Samurai noise counts right?
It's like not poking fun at Nana's drawings
Really
I mean that's how the season has been going
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
>tsubasa bullying in preview images
Apparently not
They already befriended the illuminati, an omnicidal alchemist, lyrical terrorists and god's #1 fangirl
Taking in atm that befriending *god* isn't all that farfetched for the series
Honestly same
they kick the god out of miku and befriend her now she goes to lydian
~~the series becomes a harem~~
miku's thirst influences shem-ha
determination to fist
>everyone went amalgam except chris
>all of NR besides Vanessa has been taken out of combat
this next episode is gonna be a super robot showdown
Shinai Miku thirst
Shem-ha has to deal with hearing Miku's thirst all the time
I honestly can't wait for shem-ha in the specials
theres ur kiss equivalent
they'll hold hands watching the shooting stars
i mean idek what *to* call it cause it's everything but explicitly mentioned
it'll only ever be baiting 'cause that's what it do
also magical girl and yuri baiting go together like cheese and pasta
<:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
shoutouts to bikki breaking through
hello i can look here now
*phonic gain*
vns are no better
bring ver back as a god
not a bad trade
lose cape action but gain more mecha stuff
but now she has funnels
i kinda wish maria could still do that meta knight bs
it just hit me that the dude from the *precursor* civilization is a blatant reference to kaneko's *precursor* series
ringo wa
it's the hair
i can't believe ashley winchester  became an operating system
decent chance of it given series villains tend to have some rpg demon final form
t. FEH player
don't do gacha
that's pretty rough
idk pluto wasn't a planet for a while
it's like a meta dad joke
idk if it was intentional but making a character in your *precursor* civilization a reference to your previous work is pretty cheeky
Ye
Though really struck me more as a *blatant* call back to wild arms lol
Slavic alcohol tolerance tho
ywn drink vodka with maria
smug tomato
It's just cool
I actually forgot all the butt rocket scenes were there just to show off her butt
how the hell are they wrapping this up in two episodes
~~ywn be stepped on by a smug tomato~~
"anal collapse wanko"
Seeing the 2ch nicknames for Elza after she lost the ability to use attachments killed me
I'm in the same boat except it's due to waiting to watch with someone
It's literally just Heavyarms
If you want a prediction for this ep tho shemmy gets "beaten" and it brings in a bigger threat
I'm talking about me lol
tfw ur a gx apologist
~~autoscorer ver~~
I just want a good Bikki punch
Unless Elza literally whimpers
I wouldn't describe anything so far as a whimper
It's symphogear
Even less surprised if encore is in the title
Probably will, but I wouldn't be surprised if we get some au or side movie
Symphogear Encore
seeyanara
welp time to attempt to ignore this channel until monday
including the moon
wife at every port
she wanted to get a handful of those zenbus before the series ends
<:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
I scrolled by really quick and read only the words "tie up" and "hibiki"
yes
>cakenein
becomes the mom to surpass the tomato
gotta figure out how to get non-crap internet and host some watch nights
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
the waiting doesn't feel as bad as the idea of no more geah
Or are they edgeless
Are they just one big edge
Do drills have an edge
dumb thought
Saving the b sides until the series is done in case they come up
Carol's song this season is fantastic
Pretty much in the same boat except I'm a sucker for a *lot*of GX tunes
can we listen to anything besides Gekishou Infinity (IGNITED Arrange)?
idk if they just need more time to grow on me or not
anyone else not into this season's a sides as much as the other seasons
random but
At first I was thinking Bikki drills which are kinda just rotating edges, but then I thought about ttgl looking drills
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
ok how are they bringing ver back in this last episode
I would like another Yukachi song
I do hope Miku gets some time with Shenshoujing and not just Shemmy
Although I get the feeling we'd know by now
What if double length
>lose a dad
>gain a mom
mgs2 level bait and switch
yes
i kinda dig edge bikki not gonna lie
I mean going further, Miku's probably one of the most important plot points the series considering (as XDU showed) without her we really wouldn't have the same Bikki
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
What time does the episode usually drop? I think I can actually watch it on Saturday for once
Probably skipping the preview images for this ep
ringo wa
stardust futon
and will continue to do so on every subsequent watch
i thoroughly enjoyed the shit out of this
nana wills it
is lelouch the cart driver
did they befriend a god
...so uh
boys don't know about the wubs
yes
tfw no Beef Stroganoff (IGNITED Arrange)
i wish i had the image
>and Maria
shinais are gonna be great
shem-ha exists to highlight how the effort it takes to understand each other makes that understanding that much better
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
impressive
miku keeping a straight face talking to god while her hand is exactly where she wants it to be
only the highest form of alchemy
copy paste
she's doing a side tail dempsey roll
AI DESU YO
rewatch the series
but the shinais are gonna be fun
i wouldn't be surprised if we got some AU movie
but wasn't shemmy also the virus
what about adam
smug ghost
speaking of callbacks
just enjoy the spectacle now and leave the thinking until later
a lot of them got their stuff wrapped up the season prior
i'd say tsubasa did
the specials
spinoff with terminator ver
don't expect conclusions from comedic specials
geah hangover might be an actual thing for me if i continue drinking these symphobeers
i'm still a filthy gx apologist
mikisugi aikuro is the only villian who didn't get redeemed
...and maybe look into better internet so i could maybe host it
time to find other series to watch until the inevitable rewatch
welp
dude buy the cds lmao
>kimi dake ni *is* the confession
why
they practically confessed mid-battle
i watched symphogear and it spoiled all of symphogear for me
ai no tame
metanoia
~~itaba would find another show to get excited about~~
other anime
is the rock or the sword flatter
Everyone has a key to her apartment
Chris got to host everyone's yuri shenanigans
xdu_unused_voice_clip.ogg
<:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
...yet
Episode was as gay as it gets without getting explicit
oh the bird thing
...to fill the void <:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
probably need to rewatch s1 anyway
oh right
oh
do i need to go rewatch s1 cause i'm drawing a blank
wait rejecting
sasuga
and it took being a vessel to a god and needing to be freed to close said distance
they've lived like a married couple for five seasons
based flower owner
it didn't register with me as a haiku because ~~i'm a filthy gaijin~~ i missed when they flashed it on screen
actually incredibly satisfied with it
i love it
gay as fuck
jozai senjou
when you suspect you might wind up caving in the future and writing fics <:HibikiShock:336656371611074580>
🤔
*hibiki just doesn't go to the concert*
let me wish
That sounds like material for a movie <:ElfneinWeld:586027421296492585>
puns are a beautiful thing
*swimphogear*
<:ChrisEnraged:423196924368388105>
but who can argue with a
The phrase comes up a lot
Same as her G song iirc
pretty sure yeah
i legit wouldn't have watched symphogear if i didn't try it despite what i heard
better to try than to take people's word
oh no
just pick up nanoha like me
cause i thought it was *just* the first bit
i remember hearing "axia no kaze slaps" before i listened to it much and wondered why
everything in moderation
<:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
man i forgot elfnein refused to sleep in order to work on geahs
such is anime
it basically happened
ssj basically had a bridal veil
https://tenor.com/view/man-candy-long-sakeru-gummy-gif-12394473
that was also st germain's whole deal in a way
<:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
i-i was just joking
<:CarolBlush:617039657896509460>
this feels appropriate during this discussion
also yes
mostly because ***t h i g h s***
nah millaarc has always gotten that
~~it's a chance to get touched by a girl~~
i'm okay with this
~~i'd attend a zwei wing concert in hopes of getting gungnir~~
say do you remember
moouuou
that's largely because nostalgia sells right now
<:CarolShock:430939013235474432>
i'm mature i swear
buttstuff comments about the attachments had me giggling like a grade schooler
~~and kinks, evidently~~
also frilly hats
i come from a touhou background so i'm weak to smug vampire girls
i thought the whole point of <:Germain:421434126856486912> counting was to "keep track of sins" or something
but not made happily
"necessary sacrifices"
not sympho radio
that was on her show
wait
is nana still not apparently good at puns
<:ChrisHey:607742733817479168>
yes exactly
i like the season where hibiki punched things and befriended the antagonists
I can only replay bits of ep 8 so much
The wait for bonus cds is already rough
king records goes hard with copyright strikes
unless uploaded officially
they'll never be on youtube btw
the only thing that had foreshadowing was carol but that was more the cherry on top than anything
fantastic episode
let out a very audible "WHAT"
<:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
But also edge
something something unstable emotional state making sword susceptible to mind stuff
It's beautiful
shoutouts to the first six minutes of gx
yeah adam getting naked was probably the highlight of that episode
makes loads of gears
ryoko raids the gates
my gear saturdays turned into nanoha everydays
<:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
~~don't they all get pretty exposed every transformation~~
Nah I see it
I guess it's not really xv related, just sorta thinking back on it now that it's all over
I mean as a whole
"be gay, do drugs"
y'know everyone had a big conflict they tackle but I'm struggling a bit figuring out what with dmjii
I mean it's properly marked so w/e
bd prices <:ChrisEnraged:423196924368388105>
<:KirikaShout:607741871703457812>
Sick
Oh really? I thought there was at least one still
Well how many consoles are region locked these days?
Would be nice to have some kind of action game
Maybe we'll get a game announcement in the future now that the series is done
Yeah, that's usually the thing
All preparations or mostly just fresh?
Maria
Fill my gacha needs in a safe, tomato supervised environment
I should actually look into that
She's practically Heavyarms
I typed that and thought immediately Chris fits right in
...okay yeah
If they did, I wouldn't be surprised if it was just Bikki
...well,in a lot of cases
jp accounts, vpns, apk downloads
Well there's fairly easy workarounds for those, thankfully
Yeah that's true, you can just make accounts for foreign digital storefronts
yeah but M E R C H
eat rice, be gay, punch god
actually just got tax money so it might be an easier decision
...$180 CAD
now i'm hovering over the place order button for a full set of plushies
good taste
>aberlour 12
which is what's being explained here
i mean it's fine to be disappointed that it won't break records but that doesn't mean much in terms of content to come
who can also singlehandedly sell tickets at this point
*everyone else*
and then theres
nana will singlehandedly sell tickets
nana wills it
Expected low but not *that*
107 still baffles me
I'd imagine a lot of the actual bank to be made is off merch and cds
tfw anime is fueled by a select few, very rich weebs
These are basically sales without inflation

also some players i use don't play nice with moonrunes
for consistency sake
'cause the collection had everything romanized, so romanizing the remaining is less work
<:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
oh the new ones are missing scans too
well half of the new ones actually
'cause i realize my folder has everything romanized while the new releases are all still in moon runes
are there romanized titles for all this season's songs
actually going back to xv for a sec
there's that option that compacts everything and hides pfps
oh yeah right
man with ryuko picture talking about kill la kill is a shock
ye
giant kanji and fucktons of wordplay
imagine klk without subs
cause there is *so much* wordplay in that series
endgame of weebery is being able to understand things like monogatari without subs
tfw understand enough of spoken japanese to see when cr subs are overlocalizing
something about it didn't hit me like all of bikki's other songs
also i didn't expect all loves blazing to grow on me as much
shirabe has fantastic b sides

Hope you're all ready for Cyber Ver
Hello archive viewers I hope you enjoyed episodes 7 and 8 <:CarolSmug:617040484111745027>
best friends with matching outfits and matching bath toys who stare deeply into each others eyes at the dinner table, sleep together on the top bunk and calling each other their sunshine
xtreme vibe check
i know it's srs channel but it's too relevant

eg. ways of "translating" conventional/common methods to how you learn best
A lot of what I've found helps high-functioning is developing your own mental toolkit, so to speak
Yeah I'm gonna need two weeks notice on my desk before you go offing anybody
>"God is pretty cool with murder as we learn many times in the Bible but you have to run it by him first" 
Honestly made me laugh more than it should have
But seriously, this is just a drop in the bucket for what you've got to experience in life. Don't get too hung up on one thing
No it's always been real
Besides, there's so much more out there to experience than one series
Even better, you can build productive habits early
The best thing I've found is to be actively working on a couple of things that you can set nice small goals for
Okay great, you can experiment with songs or whatever that you have no experience with/found difficult before
art, exercise, music etc
But yes seriously pick up other things
Just saying
Knowing what doesn't happen can spoil things as well
yeah uh, glad you corrected that <:CarolShock:430939013235474432>
or a dumbbell
pick up a hobby
I talked big and positive in here earlier but I feel like I'm hitting my breaking point. I'm practically locked off from what was my core friend group for reasons the one locking me off refuses to communicate with me. It's got me feeling ready to just shut everything out and never talk to anyone.
Honestly, yeah. The word "need" comes with a lot of baggage, especially surrounding this topic.
<:GenjuurouThumbsUp:336657189475188740>
It's more like having people show you how to help yourself
Cognitive behavioural therapy does help you build up your own mental toolkit, helping you out with at least *some* stuff on your own
It's a pretty good idea in general
*please don't google just the acronym*
cognitive behavioral therapy
clarification
for uh
Seeing you with your head held high is what loved ones would want, right? Even those no longer with us.
It'll always be hard to move past them and forgive yourself, but learning how to do so is incredibly powerful
There's always gonna be regrets, missed opportunities, should-haves, would-haves
No worries.
At this point nothing feels like it matters anymore
Or driving away, I guess
So I got vitriolic and it looks like I'm ditching another person
also while I'm still absolutely furious with the group
So the only guy I still had contact with tried explaining what's going on with that group after I already resolved to ditch them
seems fairly open and chill here
Hopefully I can recover a bit before the grand finale. Haven't been able to get excited for it 'cause of this crap
Thank you all
thanks for hearing me out
they're done
yeah
I have, and *if* I got a response it was basically "deal with it on your own"
I'm not sure who that is anymore given nobody seems to care that I've been gone for months
We all communicate through a voice server seperate from discord, I've been stripped of perms there and there's little to no communication outside of there
Problem is I lose that whole group that way
The one guy absolutely won't come around. He's a borderline sociopath. It's already been months and there's no give.
It's not a place for productive discussion
btw it's every part of twitter that is worth ignoring
just base your political views entirely on a japanese stealth game released in 2001 for the playstation 2 ~~like me~~
Can't stop remembering that shitty situation before and stressing myself out
filters are a godsend
breathe in for four, hold for seven, breathe out for 8

that's what i get for not clicking
oh it's in the thread
Don't doubt it but wanna have a reference
So uh, source on the casters being fired?
*interesting*
blizzcon is gonna be uh
significantly less serious but yeah
OW balance patch that *nobody* liked
'cause they apparently did that last time
or say some other overwatch character is gay to distract people
it's always time for one
do you ever need a reason for lasagna tho
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
And now it's causing one of those zero energy moments at Thanksgiving celebrations with family
Ever since ditching that group I mentioned a while back, the amount of meaningful face-to-face interaction I have with people has dropped to damn near none. I've been working on getting fit and improving other areas of my life, which feels great in the moment, but eventually the feelings of loneliness kick in. When it happens, I usually wind up either drained of all energy or unreasonably irritable, which has proven more than a little bit of a problem in day-to-day activities. Shit just feels bad and it feels like there's not a lot I can do.
neat thing to note tho
yeah that likely wasn't considered at all
though uh
hilariously enough there are some ambiguities in arthurian legend or interpretations that *can* leave room for that
<:KirikaApproval:586957465552158720>
Especially here
p.s. Don't fear appearing rude to me, I'll just ask clarification if I'm second guessing any comments
or distilled further, there's broad in-jokes and narrower in-jokes
emit vocal amusement
Expect one thing, get another that relates or has truth in an unexpected way
But the point is
I've got a bad mental association with the phrase "subverting expectations" due in part to anime snobs and due in part to Rian Johnson's... let's say questionable, writing
Thank you star wars
I just wanna avoid that cause uh
A lot of comedy operates on expectancy violation, so being familiar with what is and is not expected in and outside of the group are key factors
It's largely dependent on group dynamics, I find
~~tl;dr such is the curse of balal~~
Just wanna throw out there that dehumanization is kinda nutty in today's digital environment. We've likely all done it in some way, even minor, at some point and it's so much easier to with the kind of deindividuation that tends to happen on things like social media. Try to keep in mind that a group is not necessarily an individual and an individual is not necessarily a group. Falling into vitriolic us vs. them behaviors is really tempting, been there, but it doesn't really do much besides further divide.
Provided you're not just shitting on things
Criticism I'd imagine is fair though
~~but yes~~
Oh I was just being cheeky
my waifu's name shall not be tarnished and any ill speak of her shall be punishable by death
I go less for arguing and debates and more for coming to a greater mutual understanding, even if that's just understanding of where we disagree
I mean
e.g. This discussion right now
There is for sure civil disagreement that happens, although it's often not in the spotlight
Yeah that happens, but that's only what may be visible to you at the moment
Pardon the tangents, I see certain topics and it gets the almonds activated
Wasn't ever valid with concerns, always told things I mention conveniently never happened, and eventually locked out for wrongs that I'm still not even aware of
It eventually hit gaslighting and nobody else in the group wanted to get involved for fear of him retaliating
Part of the reason I ditched my longest standing friend group. One of them completely lacked any empathy and ran conversations like a dictator
Batteries drained
I wanna say more stuff here but I'm tapping out
As have I, they're usually just really loud
Hope you learn the tools that can help manage whatever it is you're dealing with
Ganbare
Cognitive behavioral therapy?
My b
I don't have any ill will either, I was just kinda being blunt about what I observed
Fair enough
Guessing she did not enjoy the last comment directed towards her
There's also just the reality that some people are just gonna put up walls
Could provide some insight for where you can be clearer or where they might have misinterpreted
Ask what makes them think what they think about your views?
Why's that?
It usually turns out a lot better
But uh, touching back on what I mentioned, I tend to ask a lot of clarification before I go engaging in more of a debate or argument
perfect
not even canadian and it's still 100% jeb
needs a jeb edit
~~imagine a bloc majority~~
It's pretty much just the Quebec issues party
who's ass weren't they on
then again
pretty sure the media was on his ass too
loooooot of americans in another chat were very confused when i mentioned ridings "turning blue"
yeah it's always fun to explain to people
lmao they made psycho-pass a real thing
I mean one's identity shouldn't really play into whether or not they receive basic human rights, so absolutely
Though at least now I know
And it was my main source of in-person social interaction, so now it feels like I'm up shit creek without a paddle
yyyyyyyyup
Wasn't even able to have one on one conversation even before this
Or from how ridiculously hard it was to get any activity going without the full group
Yeah, it honestly should have been obvious from how nobody did anything one on one
for reference this was a previously mentioned group i was booted from for having issues with one guy and being seemingly stonewalled from resolving them
which wouldn't be that surprising if this wasn't a group of 7-8 people who've all "known" each other irl for around *ten years*
so there's no real friendship or connection on an individual level, only really group membership
to them, there's no dynamic outside of group dynamic
so i found the missing piece of the puzzle with my former friend group
yeah that's what i found as well
oh god i think i found the meaning behind it and it sounds like some /k/ shitposting
Not with that attitude
<:KirikaApproval:586957465552158720>

Hell yeah
so $27ish USD
They're around $35CAD last I heard
Canadia
Each province has a different flavour but it's the same general idea, photo identification without driver's license
There's similar stuff over here too
So yeah, feel free to hit me up for that
Exp. as a Smash coach also helped that a *lot*
Might as well throw out there that I've often struggled with stress, anxiety and the like. Still do, always working on it, but learned a hell of a lot about it over the years. I'm always down to throw out and bounce around techniques and stuff if people need it
The other good news is there is no lack of techniques to try if you're having trouble with one
The good news is it's still plenty productive unpracticed, but practicing it makes it something you can *really* rely on
Deep breathing, meditation and the like actually do need practice, but there's no better time than the present to start
Also good to recognize that it's not gonna be some magic trick that fixes everything the first time you try it
What with health care
Yeah, more than familiar with it here lol
"free"
well ok, more directly pay
~~the most foreign part of this concept is not having to pay for it~~
At least that's what a quick search brings up
Identity cards?
Cars are expensive <:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
I don't imagine that trend is as common in Europe as it is in North America, but I've been wrong before
These types of ID have become more and more common with more and more people foregoing cars
They've definitely been notified by now by someone who has a better idea about location
Likely gang related but first time I've heard one around this area
Home, so immediately safe but still concerning
Oh no
Pretty sure I just heard a gunshot
unrelated but uh
Might have just been that one guy in his run down car having a misfire
Seems nothing reported since
that was abrupt
oh
smh
radfems appropriating skater culture
except radically shredding it at the half pipe
this is a symphogear server debating language
oh my god that's right
To be honest with you, anything dealing with people will always have room for confusion, no matter how well defined x academic model is. It does absolutely help to have a studied understanding, but that really only gives us a clear idea of things in aggregate. Take autism spectrum disorder for example. We know a lot about the general characteristics of autism, but it still requires a lot of individual work to help those diagnosed learn how to adapt their style of learn coping strategies and how to adapt their way of learning/what accomodations they may need.
yeah you get used to your changes as you go, so you can wind up feeling like you're in the same spot despite other people clearly seeing otherwise
to bring it back though, actually taking the time out to practice it once you learn more about cognitive behavioural therapy will go a long way
i did too but it was never abbreviated for me beforehand
but for real, good stuff looking into it
unfortunate, i guess???
not that anyone needs to change things up just
ok but it's actually been somewhat of a problem for me seeing the abbreviation in a serious context
🤞
Hopefully you can get some good recovery time in the near future
Overworked/not getting enough sleep?
Even starting number
Yeah the exact numbers definitely vary
for reference:
which uh, wow, i really like this method of visualizing how some may need to ration their energy for the day
quick google search leads me to spoon theory
Start with small stuff and build those good feelings 'cause you're constantly accomplishing things
This is why you often hear people suggest making small measurable goals
Motivation is fleeting, discipline is not
So it's less get motivated to do tasks and more do tasks to get motivated
Ironically, feeling a lot of emotions one would relate to motivation
Well I'm just gonna shortcut through and say typically completing a task that's worthwhile makes one feel good
<@188714906143424513> bit of both, actually. How do you feel after actually completing a task?
I've got some stuff I could ask or share on motivation if you want. Lemme know whenever though, don't wanna interrupt you unloading
Would encourage more critical thinking and question asking
Nor is the apparently nihilistic outlook
I'm gonna be honest, it's a fair observation. Broad statements like what I'm seeing without elaborating aren't really conducive to discussion
yeah uh
So thanks for the clarifications
Need some more brain juice
I'll probably have more things about the concept confuse me in the future, but for now it doesn't sound as weirdly counterintuitive anymore
It's starting to make a little more sense to me now
no this is a pretty pleasant discussion going on right now tbh
so anarcho in seperation from government and practicing communism on a much smaller scale?
but i'm just confused when I hear ancom
ancap makes a little more sense to me 'cause free market but ***EXTREEEEEME***
I'm just wondering what the rationale is 'cause it's been bugging me
cause afaik communism would require some sort of structure
I'm gonna be blunt, ancom sounds completely contradictory to me whenever I read it
don't let me dictate the flow of things if you wanna continue lol
idk i was just stating my satisfaction
this has been all in all pretty pleasant and interesting
and i would like to reiterate
tbh this is the most i've delved into politics in ages
*something*
i have a feeling past tense there means uh
shredding turf
i mean radicals of any kind are no bueno unless we're hitting the half pipe
i don't actually know entirely but it's interesting
so it's less moderate/neutral bad but more perversion of the terms?
mediating etc
i know centrists kinda get shit on for not being partisan but a certain degree of moderation between those who are helps, i believe
all i know is my gut says maybe
>economic centrist
>diplomatically balanced
>civil moderate
>societal neutral
i like this already
so I doubt they'd want to do scales or 8 values either
I know a lot who don't even want to do the compass
Likely many, many people
yeah this is way better
I *have* taken this before
OH
So it has its use
It's a common point of reference though
idek where i fall on a compass anymore
Nice, hopefully you get to relax
Maybe not now, low energy day
Though uh
I mean I'd like to know about the whole baby thing too, 'cause as it stands, something isn't sounding quite right to me
But they're still discussions worth having
There's certain topics I don't often broach because the negative emotional response is so common that I don't think bringing it up is worth
Yep
Nah, getting angry is easier than trying to understand
Oh you said easier and more effective
Absolutely, but what's easier?
Not to mention education doesn't necessarily guarantee a job
Yeah four years post-secondary education is a big overstatement
But feel free to ask me stuff about resumes and interviews
and I'm legit in-classes right now for stuff like selling yourself in an interview, on a resume etc, so if I'm getting too broad, my bad
btw, real examples. not bullshitting w/ my experiences.
Also can show you're actively working towards growing yourself in the business
Like I need a notebook on the job to keep my tasks organized, but I let them know after I've been working
And to echo Melua, if you do need accommodations or considerations, that comes after hiring
For example, I'm very detail-oriented. I don't tell people I get hung up on details due to a learning disability, but rather, tell them how I use my attention to detail in my work.
Yeah it's not something you mention on your highlight reel there directly. If some learning disability has you practicing skills to mitigate or cope, you can mention those without actually listing off some diagnosis
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
Been finding myself with next to no energy as of late. Can't keep focus on the tasks that need to be done and can hardly participate in things that I want to do when I actually get to do them
That's the big idea, but smaller practices that work towards that is where I'm struggling
<:HibikiTired:422925410490253313>
Been experiencing some marked improvements but now feeling like there's a regression happening
I had previously talked big about how building discipline > getting motivated but fug, how do you build discipline
I just got done having a long discussion on something semi-related so i'm in big think mode, pardon the abstract rambling
or at least an attempt
like i think a discussion could have been had where a judgement was seemingly placed
Feels like there's some conclusions being drawn, thoug I admit I don't know the situation here cause this is all second hand
but i just think there's more to someone enjoying x joke at y's expense than "they must hate y"
yeah i don't know how to articulate what i wanna say here, fug
gonna be honest, trying to weigh how... let's say spicy, i want to be with this devil's advocate point here
like what, jokes are supposed to hurt or something like a good joke is going to offend somebody?
what does that mean exactly
and sometimes it's just not gonna happen. better not to fan the flames and just back away if you see that
Questioning and trying to come to an understanding even in those situations is gonna go waaay further, even if it's hard
you're just gonna have it reciprocated
juuuust saying
<@183785454447886346> thing is though coming at someone verbal guns blazing is not how you get a good discussion going
Honestly feeling like my time is worth more than what I'm getting out of that job
Not to mention hearing how sales in the department have been coincidentally up on all the days you've been in
Especially after feeling like you contributed a lot
How could you *not* be motivated after that?
Hearing nothing constructive, only problems
Hearing about how "nothing got done" on my shift and only being berated
God, you know what really gets me motivated to work?
or *anything*
everyone would have to comply to use youtube
pretty much. google/youtube would have to comply which means uh
it'll have an effect on the content coming out so it's something that'll be felt regardless of where you are
Yeah then it just sounds like a going nowhere kind of thing
<:GenjuurouThumbsUp:336657189475188740>
We get a better picture here now so it's a good all around
it's been a day
though that maaaaaaaaaay have just been bad reading comprehension on my part
That's where I feel like I was missing something here
Oh okay
I'd just go, although without the theatrics
but i mean if i'm just told i'm terrible i'm not gonna sit around and listen to why or what might be offending someone
I dig wordplay so nice
<:TsubasaSmug:585839805737467920>
If I were to just distill the thought here, it's just that I don't think going in with "this proves you're terrible" is gonna get anyone anywhere
I obviously can't
That's why I said I admittedly don't know the situation
Could be, but I'd rather someone start asking stuff than assume.
tricky
it's just
idek how to get past something like that 'cause i kinda struggle too
that's what i figured
you probably have another layer to this going off what was said here but tbh a *lot* of people just don't like their voice
i thought there was a fair amount you could do with voice training
ever so slight
like
one of my good buddies is a trans man and he's put a lot of effort into his voice, though there's still a trace
i figured but i didn't know how the extent of which you could train
i am a geographically impaired canadian
living there costs way more than where i am
yeah i typed san fran and i'm like wait
fug
but i won't press
well if you're in new york, new jersey, st louis, baltimore, san fran or dallas, i could toss you this rec to at least look at
that and the class in and of itself is networking, getting yourself to support and be supported by peers etc
stress management is a big portion of it
that's actually part of why i'm looking for locations for this one in particular
it's free private education for those under a certain tax bracket that gets people prepped and confident to enter the workplace
i wonder if i know any stateside resources similar to the training i'm doing
hm
ok hold up what
then it'd just be on to the next job opportunity <:KirikaApproval:586957465552158720>
but my social skills were awful before it
like retail sucks, a lot
i kinda feel that, though the issue is it's something that does take practice
dealing with customers
sorry, used to resume jargon
it can be real real useful in client facing fields
that's legitimately not easy
actually hey that's something
it's really not something people compliment
it's advice i wish i heard way back so i like to get it out there
yeh
small steps are more than fine
with working on skills in your own time, also keep in mind you don't have to dive straight into the deep end straight away
but uhhhh
but pls dont deal drugs lol
you'd be surprised
~~not with that attitude~~
i hope that works out smoothly
oh sweet
i mean things are hard but are they worthwhile
idk how to describe it, but honestly i wouldn't even notice if i didn't know him
it's less like a twinge of feminine voice and more like...
been on it for quite a while
At least ones that aren't bustling
There are plots of nature, it's just a matter of finding them
That's a good one though
Smack dab in the middle of the city
Being among nature would be great, though it's gonna be difficult to find a spot
And it makes me sleepy
Meditation has been working but only temporarily
Getting set off nigh everywhere
Buh, having a seriously hard time with managing anger this past week
Hope to see ya back soon
GochiUsa has been a good background show for me and I see you've already seen it
Just an idea
Put on something nice in the background and do something small, like organize maybe one drawer or something
You could always rewatch, to be fair
Any recent yuri stuff that's stuck out for you?
o hell yea
We don't bite
But yeah, <@309482589121413121> you got a server here full of people who're likely more than happy to hear what shows you like to watch
Hard to tell with text <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
...Though yeah, maybe not appropriate here
I mean in moderation it's completely fine. Hell, learning what kind of brews one likes is a real good way of bonding
Though binge drinking I wouldn't encourage
I mean you listed two of my favourite pasttimes so you and I already have some common ground
Dunno if any are out of date
https://twitter.com/_firesoldier_/status/916363505456111616
Reaching out in a time of need can be extremely hard, but even just the act of doing so goes a long way
You don't have to sit with your thoughts alone, the people on the other end aren't gonna judge you
Dunno what area you're from <@309482589121413121> but I would highly recommend calling your local crisis services center. Trying to find a good list atm.
but that's moving more into general stuff
just 'cause there's like fifteen million things asking money every month
i wish the ability to use emotes anywhere wasn't a thing locked behind a subscription service
I do like our emotes a *lot* though so it'd probably see diminished use anyway with nitro
I can't use it outside of servers that have the emote anyway cause y'know, nitro
I'm glad in the very least peepos don't draw the same ire
not get into my negative outlook haha
...kinda says a lot about outlook on things but hey let's uh
I mean the originals are honestly still good reaction images. Sadfrog tends to capture a lot of stuff I wanna communicate perfectly.
Wondering where it's being observed
Any prominent examples? I've just not seen anything like that in a good long time.
Now the most I've seen from the meme in the political sphere is from *hong kong*
Gonna be honest, I don't get it at this point. A lot of what got people rallying against the cartoon frog has faded hard. Namely the whole Kekistan thing.
but holy shit i want out and i don't wanna have to wait until i line up something else
not gonna actually happen
okay ghosting is honestly an exaggeration
so it practically is already
There's zero chance of any decent reference coming from that job
and I'm really sick of feeling stuck in such a shit job
That's what everyone says
just at the point with my current job where i'm considering walking off with zero notice and ghosting
but damn if it's not the most attractive
i wouldn't say only way
All I want for Christmas is meaningful employment with colleagues and managers that actually appreciate the work I do
***shadow bullying***
Tell me about it...
It's just kinda shallow
It's a small group i've known for a couple of years, but I've come to realize there's not much actual connection outside of playing the same games sometimes
Definitely not
and yeah the previous thing was my impression of things. it's not like they literally said i'm worthless if i don't play xbox shootan game with them
Honestly trade school is the play these days
now it's a group that seems to base my worth entirely on whether or not i want to play halo with them
getting really tired of feeling like ive outlived my usefulness in friend circles
seconding unironically not using twitter
Figured as much
so is there a few good sources of information for all this stuff 'cause i feel like there's a lot of sensationalism and misinfo going around
Even checking sources the articles use
Would recommend always reading more than headlines these days
Might not convince them to dive right into said media, but better than throwing around labels and ultimately wind up nowhere
I'm just saying giving someone a clearer picture of what stuff's actually like might help illuminate things
I mean, it's entertainment
I can't speak to the actual content, but from what I've seen said about the show, I can see where the idea might come from
done heavy handed enough, it can put someone off
there's probably an amount of exaggeration in the information he's heard, but the show does definitely try to cater to that crowd
I mean I say suit yourself because that's pretty fair
Would rather give someone the opportunity to talk about it
I just find that running with assumptions doesn't end well
Suit yourself
Yeah, but it's worth a shot to ask
I mean, you can ask someone if they're serious. That *is* a way you can know for sure
hyperbole runs rampant
i think it's just the times
~~i berate the smash community here more than anything else~~
<:TsubasaSmug:585839805737467920>
*symphogear server*
mutual understanding, communication, friendship
Sounds awkward
I mean I've not agreed with people's beliefs but still gotten along
The old friend group I fell out with was pretty bad for this actually
It's all one big grey mess
At the same time, sometimes time just isn't there
Yeah I feel ya
What kind of effort do you mean? Wonderin'
Yeah, that's a big part of it
this went from "is my friend homophobic for not liking steven universe for this reason" to "how do you make friends"
N A K A M A
Burn real bad too
Yeah, I've had that burn me real recently
I just like to try still
You can't control others
Being real again, the whole thing on reciprocity is helping me make sense of my situation with a former friend group
<:HibikiScreech:633468460030230548>
but you get to play bagpipes
<:ChrisOi:586551700987576330>
...at least in the kinds of cases i can think of
It's probably different perspectives on what a bond is and perceived reciprocity
and I actually felt bad that he's the one that wound up on the receiving end of my ire
Stevie's probably the most genuine guy among them
The way I snapped at the other guy, let's say Stevie, was a pretty big fuck-up
I'll own up to it
I mean it's not like I'm an angel, I've had my share of fuck-ups within that group
The frustration lies in how the rest of the group claimed neutrality when Scott had all 52 cards
I absolutely agree
No explaination from Scott either
Basically what irritated him at that moment
It had seemingly random triggers
Basically, talk carefully the moment that we hear a specific tone in his voice
Not even joking
Scott's actually a sociopath
Knew these guys for 10 years, they play a joke that while not entirely malicious, oversteps some serious bounds. I snap at one of them for it and it stops. However, one of them.. let's call him Scott, continues to take at least the verbal portion too far, despite my protests.

First off, Scott has a history of being tricky to deal with, often getting vindictive over the smallest annoyances. The group seemingly walks on eggshells around the guy 'cause it's not clear exacly what sets him off or how, just that when it does, it ends bad for everyone but him. I've had to back off on a lot of mundane discussions I've wanted to have with the rest of the group just because Scott was about to get vile with everyone.

That in mind, I've had to bend a lot for his boundaries while mine go blatantly disregarded. I get locked out of our online space just because of Scott's and no-one else in the group even looks in my direction, claiming they're staying neutral. No-one even attempts to talk to me for months without me initiating. Realizing now how much reciprocity plays into things makes it clear it was barely ever there in the first place.
gonna throw a lot of serious text down that the previous convo had me thinking about
k fair warning
🥃
When it rains, I pour
It's really not, and it's really not fun trying to find it
Thanks, likewise
and it feels like shit
So uh, yeah. To wrap up this blog, all that is why I've been feeling without a place I belong for... actually *9* months.
Sometimes think I wouldn't mind putting names out there. They've been edgy enough around me to get in some serious shit, but trying to get back at them like that doesn't sit well with me at all.
Yeah they're not the real names. I've had to stop myself from typing them a couple of times
Usually mutual interests, life happenings. Rarely did it broach the topic of that group, but when it did, Adam had plenty misgivings with them as well
Let's call him Adam
Not one of 'em besides the one I was friends with before any of them
It's been well over six months and I'm still dwelling. Thought they were my closest circle
So I just don't know if they ever saw me worth the effort to begin with
Before this incident it was a hassle to make or get in on any plans with the group
It's very complicated
I did make amends with Stevie so I don't think that was the case, but I'll never know now
Maybe
I do need to step away and just... breathe. Thanks for listening to my ramblings.
~~share your doujins with the guests~~
When I pour the hard liquor, it's measured, limited, drank slow and done for taste much much more than the buzz
I mean I'm admittedly messing around with a subject I probably shouldn't
Good ol Skub
...but please don't take that as an endorsement of alcoholism
depending on the drinks, booze might actually be cheaper
I struggle a ton myself, but again
But that's no reason not to keep trying
I actually do
...Practice self-discipline
cause it hits hard every year without fail the moment winter starts letting up
is spring just lonely season or is it me
random but uh
But that might be more my frustration with some social media cycle I'm observing than anything
There are a lot of weird social things that really, really irk me. How inclined we are as a whole to spread information that's kinda just junk, for example
If I had to speak really broadly about the general populace, I'd still have to break it down into specific aspects of people I do and don't enjoy
<:HibikiTired:422925410490253313>
that's what a looooot of  other things are like too
yeah i'm just usually mr. "don't forget the middle road exists" here
obviously not so much in this instance cause it's pretty dumb here
but there's also an extent to which an individual has to filter things themselves
as well as what topics would and wouldn't fly
like a person's gotta know their crowds and know what should and shouldn't be acceptable behaviour, of course
idk i feel like there's a little bit of truth on both ends here
maybe not so much when it comes to dealing with medical professionals but i'm not big on giving myself or being given a bunch of labels
though yeah fuck labels
because of how much it varies from person to person
i mean that's why it's referred to as autism specrum disorder
lemme tell ya
yyyyyyyyyyyyyyyep
then it's way more gray
you don't really have the people skills for retail as an unfortunate result of being on the spectrum
if it's like
I mean if it's a rejection for the explicit reason of being autistic, yes it's prohibited
Maybe I've just got a problem making friends
Like, fuck
It's like you always gotta defend liking things
idk how much is in jest and how much is genuine anymore but it's so common that either one is tiring
It's never a problem in public spaces for that reason but it's getting real tiresome even in friend groups
"imagine liking things. can't be me."
feels like you can't genuinely enjoy a thing without being told it's shit or having someone act superior to you because they don't like it
anyone else getting real burnt out on elitism
and now people are swamped with information
tfw you assume vegan when you hear meatless these days
depends on how much you wanna spend on supplements lmao
impossible no. impractical? debatably
you technically can but you'd have to go through a bunch of trouble to get the same nutrients you would by just... eating meat
but that's like, super off topic lmao
at least from my view of things
the distinction here being a debate can lead to productive discourse, but "winning" is usually the objective
it's more, y'know, productive discourse that doesn't happen
oh no, debating is alive and well
oh boy, lemme tell you about debating
mgs2 is an amazing~~ly scary~~ view of memetics in the digital age, but *now* we're actually starting to drift towards gaming lol
what with a series so steeped in politics etc
though there's a lot from that series that would actually be relevant in channels like this
ye
absolutely
i could go on for hours about online discussions but, that'll eventually end with me talking about mgs2 at length for the 500th time
i had to stop myself from saying "entering conversations with the wrong objective" cause tbh that's ironically pretty narrow-minded of me
some want to learn, some just want to totally own the people on the other end etc
it's usually people entering... uh... discussions? with different objectives
<:HibikiScared:688429720152703033>
quarantine got me missing a shitty abusive friend group cause they were the only consistent online hangout i had
Just mildly annoyed that I had an idea and was *this* close to getting it into words, but such is life
Gonna have to tap out though before I start shitposting in the serious channel though
Forum arguments with IRC commentary
It can happen, it's just *definitely* not what it was built for
Instant messaging and long form discussion are kinda at odds with each other.
That's exactly what happened to me when I attempted to put it into words. Quarantine sleep habits taking their toll right now
Grown from sounds about right since the experience itself still seems to have been valuable and not just gone
I had a thing I was going to segue into with group identity and developing political views, but that train seems to have left the station already.
I'm 26 and still have no idea where I'd fall on the compass or what you'd call my views. I've found not caring about the definition of them a loooot easier personally. Makes me a lot more curious to know where people are coming from as long as they're not immediately hostile.
I feel ya, it's enjoyable but really takes a lot out of you. Especially since for me, I'm always scrutinizing my word choices way, way more while typing.
I'm just going to say real quick that I enjoy the long form here and am looking forward to catching up so uh, don't feel bad
i'm seeing it and hearing about it with cashiers here
yeah if you've been out working during all this, some of the cleansers and cleaning practices might be taking a toll on your skin
ok peace out
lmfao what
Yeah that's the situation pretty much everywhere
Hence why I'll probably go back later
It's just me personally being exhausted with hearing about wanting to be a hero, what a hero does etc
and I still might come back to it
and even then, the last thing to fall flat for me was Fire Force because HERO HERO HERO HERO etc
My criteria is pretty lax too, usually it's only if something is extremely annoying or boring that I don't continue
If it passes the first three episodes I'll usually finish
Might pick it up, been keeping an eye on it for a while
Wild ride?
Been hearing that a bunch
was kinda meaning to look into it at some point
I thought it was a little obscure but not *that* obscure
ye
I actually do
Kinda wondering what sort-of halfway points people have found ~~so i can watch more ridiculous anime~~
To sort-of bridge things a little, are there particular series that you guys recommend often to people who enjoy Symphogear? Additionally, do you find yourself recommending Symphogear often to people who like a particular series?
Buddy of mine made it his mission to show it to every weeb he knew
Flip Flappers was great
Which is perfect
idk sounds like a trainwreck
Stuff that's just bad but fun to watch and riff on in a group
Get a bunch of lads together and just rip on it
This sounds like a yellin' anime
ahaha what the fuck
Has to be the dub too
Except no really
Master of Martial Hearts watch party
I'd love to host watch parties but internet sux
I gotta get people together for a bad anime night
Oh man
So uh, I had no idea what I was getting into with yuuki yuuna
Comedy w/ action
yeah
DB on the other hand...
It's a well-animated shounen with a varied cast of somewhat relatable characters
Like I do really enjoy TTGL and BNHA but there's a *lot* out there
People get introduced with BNHA and go on about how every episode is the best episode of anything ever
okay but so many entry points are like that
I mean their actual mechanical designs barely matter because dude spiral energy lmao
I'd say TTGL but it's really not much of a mecha rec
That's what I've seen a lot
How much relies on being aware of how things go in Japan, japanese puns etc
There's also knowledge of japanese culture to consider
🚓
Kirika's is uh
and you get a looot more out of it after being around the block a couple of times
I'm a bit hesitant on Konosuba 'cause so much of it plays off of isekai tropes
I usually assume ecchi tolerance to be low to none
Bebop is such an easy recommendation because it appeals to the western audience, has a really good dub and it's episodic
There are some series I flat out avoided too because their storytelling was all over the place
That's actually covered somewhat
For clarification I've been working on a big dumb anime rec list to check back and cross reference with a person's tastes
As it always does, but some general points of reference help
So uh, probably a fairly common question, but I figure I'd get different answers here. What anime series do you typically recommend to the uninitiated? Furthermore, what are some entry-level series for the less newbie-friendly genres?(eg. mecha, mahou shoujo, romance etc.)
I'd disagree there. It's catering to a large crowd but it's not lacking in quality by any means.
Yeah I've really noticed that everywhere
I mean I hear monogatari is way better if you know japanese cause of how much damn *wordplay* there is
*Heh*
The pacing of Trost killed it for me personally so I never continued past s1
And how
Titan has gotten so much love among people not as into the medium, but the pacing for S1 makes me wonder why
Actually pacing is another concern that comes up a bit
There *definitely* were
At least in some of my circles
I think the structure of the Dark Tournament arc really draws certain people in
Oddly enough it's still pretty palatable for newcomers
and now i'm interested
you put those words together and all i can think of is a ZOE show by urobutcher
when did that get announced
*BEASTARS*
wait fuckin
I'm more surprised than anything
I probably will anyways but eh
what
>psycho-pass s3
oh god i completely forgot to look at anything airing next season
Half of why P4's anime sticks out to me is because of the King's Game episode
Weren't the P3 movies pretty good?
Isn't Dark Souls a poor man's King's Field?
I'm down for a God Hand anime
You'll get the Fate route instead
keikaku means plan
deen's QUALITY somehow made Konosuba even better
uguu
*heavenrend*
i'm fairly certain kaguya is getting a season 2 eventually
oh man
so uh, granbelm is way more of a wild ride than anticipated
p.s. watch flip flappers
let's open a support group for people looking for cool shows to fill the void
~~and if so how do you deal with knowing all it took was watching cute girls lift weights~~
anyone else in the "started working out again because of anime" club?
selector infected wixoss was fun
Gonna sift through the list and toss some here after a nap
But yeah, digging up some old gems and sharing them around might be a nice thing to do in the wake of xv
<:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
The only trigger thing it doesn't have is the big drop in quality in the second half
It's great
It's the most trigger thing ever
now it's not all sold out
oh cool, bunny senpai movie got more screenings at my theater
Psycho Pass 3 is a whole different cast btw
bunny senpai movie has me feeling like all my emotional circuits are shot
Even with everything factored in that sounds ridiculous
the show kinda lost me super early but *107*
the animation alone isn't 107 bad
just give us more konosuba
in fact
reduce cast size and give the konosuba cast more screentime
help as in i need more <:TsubasaSmug:585839805737467920>
~~i have six ryukos please help~~
stay strong <:KirikaSalute:620069889838809089>
I got out until Hobbystock Bikki pulled me back
It's a slippery slope
Might get a chance at a reprint with another season coming up
short print runs, demand, second hand
glad that one's a scale
cause the pose and everything would be so great for a scale
there's just a number of prize figs i've seen that feel like it's a shame they're prize figs
~~don't kinkshame~~
o nice
can't actually tell
is that a prize fig or a scale
Just the best
He's the best
and so the befriendening begins
might be able to do stuff
oh, turns out i'm not *that* bad when it comes to screen share
You can also wait til a few episodes of things are out and see what's actually appealing to what crowd
but canadian internet
Get some completed series going with some group watch shenanigans to enjoy as well
Yeah, that's kinda why I wish I could get watch parties going
I personally like to have at least one show that's finished airing to watch alongside airing shows
There's always older stuff too
'course unless it's adapted badly
I'd argue that comedy in general tends to benefit more from being animated
just finished a's
so i've been sleeping on nanoha
I can't get enough tho
everyone in the main cast just annoys the hell out of him
yeah i know a guy who just can't stand it as well
nice
reminders to book off, reminders for the reminders, reminders to check you're actually booked off
Still no news for Canada <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
Enjoy it
Yeah, there's no one I really dislike
<:MariaConfident:336657338729627658>
Signum
~~like how gainax tax fraud is what spawned end of tv~~
and yeah, the context of how it came to be helps
Usually find a lot of stuff gets soured when people apply modern standards to old stuff and vice versa
And idk S1 did have its issues, but it was a lot easier for me to handle having watched a lot of shows from around that time period
If he hasn't, oh man
So uh
This guy's also a huge Kamen Rider fan
Wouldn't be surprised
One of my buddies back in high school was trying to get me to watch. Kinda wonder now if he happened to pick up Symphogear
Ye
Going through the series in release order btw
I liked it, as well as s1
Started a conversation and then got real busy whoops lol
Oh god
Sicc
Oh okay so I got good stuff after s1
Just default styling
idk where exiled destiny ripped subs from but it didn't seem like anything bad
Still not sure if I had quality subs
*niiiice*
But yeah, not having decent scans is rough
...well minus the spoilers
sounds like duwang veterans would be fine
<:ElfneinDrowning:336656417035517952>
<:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
So uh, no lack of content I see
also oh no talk of fate continuity
How much do the spinoffs vary from the *feel* of the first three seasons?
So maybe
Always found it hard to do drama cds, but it's been a while
Anything to keep in mind after Strikers btw?
Hayate is precious
But that's just me being tired of teh rie
The only possible one is Alisa just because I watched way too much anime with typical tsundere characters voiced by Rie Kugimiya
Sure thing <:KirikaApproval:586957465552158720>
<:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
lmfao what
i watched bad subs for deen stay night and still enjoyed it
So I don't mind much
Usually isn't much of an issue to find a middleground tl mentally using audio and sub
Still pretty good tho
Mostly having to do with subs having rougher speech than what's said on occasion
Yeah even in CSW's release I was iffy on some tls
so uh, I'd imagine it's solid
one of my buddies is a manga fiend and been telling me to pick up beastars for ages
is there a go-to sub group for gaogaigar or nah
but been binging mahou shoujo stuff recently, kinda need a change of pace
might start up strikers
WOW WOW
Gonna be dead that tuesday though
Probably
Maybe
Konosuba movie has a showing in my city but it's at 9:30PM on a Monday
gdi
ftr I dug gridman but not for the same reasons I would get into toku or kaiju
<:GenjuurouThumbsUp:336657189475188740>
Which uh, isn't surprising given Trigger
Kinda more like certain gainax things
i mean i see the toku and kaiju stuff going on in the fights, but outside of that it feels like something very different
'cause who is available to see a movie at 2pm on a monday
only one that isn't is the one at 2pm
i mean they've got five time slots for konosuba and almost all of them are sold out
meanwhile konosuba still has only the one day here
got two days initial run and i'm pretty sure it got more the following week
i'm surprised bunny senpai got extended as much as it did here
https://static.zerochan.net/Takarada.Rikka.full.2370778.png
Oh I mean
O lol
kinda wondering how that stacks up for someone more well versed in toku, though i'm told plain ol' garo is more like an anime done in live action instead
have you watched the first garo anime
~~and not thicc anime thighs either, i swear~~
Lot of Ghibli I've just never seen so it's tempting
princess kaguya next month, princess mononoke now
Might not be fathom but it lines up with what we've got going atm
for ghibli fests
Oh I guess there's just the same kind of schedule everywhere then huh
coincidence
ah just sounded like timing lined up
hope you don't mind me asking but you from around my area? we just had princess mononoke screenings start up at the theater chain here in ontario
pun fully intended btw
never saw a theater laugh that much
konosuba blew me away
oh man
tfw shirobako probably won't see western theaters
o finally started up nanoha strikers
oh god that's the first mention of garzey's wing I've seen in ages
oh i guess this is the point in nanoha where everybody suddenly starts sleeping in the same bed
...not that I'm complaining <:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
Guess they're like "10yr time skip, time to make things real gay real fast"
<@139432096023183360> yeah that's what i saw that made me say it lol. Nanoha and Fate regularly sharing a bed is about to start.
never and it's a damn crime
does Golden Boy count cause honestly dub is the only way to watch that
god i forget what else
Cromartie is a pretty good example, I've heard good things about Panty and Stocking's dub
key word tend
comedy anime tend to dub better
it's ridiculously frustrating
and i don't even get why
ok i forgot rihoko doesn't actually win
...
every girl wins
https://myanimelist.net/anime/8676/Amagami_SS
It's more her mannerisms and dynamic that sells her than the scenario
n-nevermind haha
oh
~~i can't blame you if so~~
you didn't like one and her name is risa
lemme guess
amagami advent is as pleasant as it is painful
and that's amagami ss
only one show gets that treatment for me
just not quite there yet
Yeah I planned to do dub when it comes time for the inevitable rewatch
He does a lot of reserved edgy lads that save their yelling for when it counts
He's got a decent range of roles, Guy's more on the loud end of things
Hiei
japanese screaming guy known for Viral(TTGL), Link(OoT), Guy(GaoGaiGar) and like at least one role in everything else Gainax and Trigger
it's already got tough competition when you have nobuyuki hiyama in the jp voice cast
was yu yu hakusho's dub really that good cause i remember watching it subbed
which was mentioned
...then konosuba is the most recent thing I can think of with a decent dub
o
I wish Seiren was better
oh god
i mean yeah
don't let that label turn you off
and yeah amagami was a dating sim but the anime is a lot more palatable for the general populus
i like how everyone listed a different girl
they know who they like and they like who they know
to be fair a lot of the voice cast returns for a looooot of trigger things
time for amagami advent again
oh god
followed by master of martial hearts marathon
mars of destruction watch party
puella magi madoka mecha presents the holy grail war
it was fun in the moment but i don't think i'm gonna remember it much later
yeahhhhh
Kinda just kept going after 18
<:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
welp, that's it for strikers
takes quite a while after for it to really kick into gear too
you guys werent kidding about strikers pacing
so now I'm watching two 19 year old adoptive mothers train a squad
nanoha has the colour scheme going on even
and yeah i figured
"ok bye"
"look at how close nanoha's family is"
well, strikers specifically
nanoha feels a lot more like a gundam series with its internal political stuff and i guess pacing
~~the strength of nana's will~~
dude keywords lmao
which... I probably did
The only other big thing was some of the stuff going on made me feel like I missed a bunch of supplementary material
Jail being an enormous ham was great
though it's hard for me not to enjoy things when you've got a loud punchy girl
<@139432096023183360> kinda suffered from cast bloat but all in all pretty enjoyable

stardust futon
i'm this close to gushing about mgs and need to stop lol
I feel like voice direction is something that doesn't get enough attention here too
just to suffer?
why are we still here?
idk why i first thought "imagine the western voice acting industry but everyone is at robin atkin downes' level minimum"
wonder if that'll ever change
but maaaaaan
i've heard the dub is actually pretty good, plus comedy shows seem to get decent to good dubs
god the jp voice cast puts so much damn energy into things
it scratched a trashy entertainment itch fairly well here
tfw debating crunchy just for convenience sake
a pc and way too much free time
i'm looking into a position where i'd have just that
oh god
jesus
...
honestly expected my list stats to be way bigger
might as well show it after all that effort
https://myanimelist.net/animelist/TruestBlade
holy hell
i think i finally finished updating my list
~~we regularly remind him of his mistake~~
by running a pokemon gts distribution thing and having it accidentally flood /v/
I know the guy who inadvertently created /vp/
the ol' ryuko folder wouldn't be nearly as big without it
/c/ is blessed
Don't think I would have liked it if I hadn't
I went back and watched Deen Stay Night well after watching what ufotable could do with UBW and F/Z
I mean I can see why
hey same
"Disappointing hockey team and -30C temps"
ya and
<:TsubasaSmug:585839805737467920>
Actually nvm, forgot Yui
You're right, it's pointless when Misato exists
Rei vs Asuka never dies, it just assumes another form
Besides the anime being supposedly more action oriented(???)
Anyone know of any differences between the manga and the anime for Vinland Saga?
Random, but might as well throw it out there
late but lost it at "nanoha shippuden"
Proprietary memory cards seem to be Sony's kink or something
nothing
just 'cause the MC is so
I think closest would actually be Kyouko Suiri
trying to remember the last show i was like that with
yeah i sat in on a bit of a showing at a con
tbh i never even watched the show and might change that soon
it's a great song
quite the contrast
lmao
but it's more the fact that i'm hearing aoi yuuki sing and it's not about justice and holding hands and taking the shortest fastest route
i mean hell yeah she does
ye
hearing the youjo senki ed after so much symphogear is weird
snake chapter seems to give you an idea of her methods faster while steel lady seems... idk, more effective at showing you her methods?
i could sorta see a case for either, being anime-only here
main reason i'm not reading the manga is i heard scans stopped
probably better in the manga where i don't have to hear how mamoru miyano isn't showing off his amazing range
i just don't like kuro and kotoko can only carry so much
alright i get ya
i'm used to jp name cause that's what i've gotta search to get it
ye
i was just surprised how nothing kuro is
lmao
gonna say lmao
i was uh
mirai nikki is still probably the trashiest show i enjoy
honestly watch the stupidest of stupid until you learn to turn your brain off and enjoy sheer absurdity
Kotoko carries the show
buh, running out of lighthearted stuff that i planned to watch
lelouch is eternally fantastic
sadism
i forgot how good yuru camp is
man why is there so much slapping in MSG 0079
<:MikuFear:642799630605615114>
Bright Slap is shortly followed up with Icelina getting slapped by her father and I'm sitting here like
I guess I just didn't watch a lot of older stuff but yeah
Oh whoops, started a thing and then just didn't look back at the channel
just watch one thing that has like 50 million episodes
I slacked so I watched it literally right before I had to go out the door
And uh
I remember when I was invited out to Heaven's Feel 2, the people I was with were asking each other how fresh their recollection of the first movie was
I get it tho
Yeah but I've got issues jumping around from different eras of animation lol
...Looking forward to hitting 08th MS Team though
I'm just going in release order honestly
Wanted to go from the start
That's probably why I avoided others
Actually no, somehow only watched stuff outside of UC
I'll probably do movies further down if I feel like a rewatch
Is there something wrong with the movies or is it just a case of "experience the original first?"
Series
<:NotLikeFist:689188869974786133>
But the original probably invented a bunch of these
because I've watched other stuff
I'm seeing all the stereotypical death flags in MSG 0079
Oh god
mushi-shi is a great series to just watch an episode or two of every now and then
~~that and i think the second half shat the bed hard~~
