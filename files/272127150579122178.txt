Was really elaborate, but very fun
I remember april fools on one of my places was to literally turn the entire server on its head, flip every icon, write every channel name and role backwards etc
One of my places has a channel called this, we'll be fine
You mean in terms of character limit?
<#336298054724485131> to #complaining-about-rng
I'd be in favor of that, yeah; maybe with an additional specifier to the tune of onyl birthday-specific art being exempt to not drown out other things too much
I also don't know what the backend setup is here regarding bots, but the discussion on one of the places I mod is currently that any sort of audit log plugin will also not be able to look into these channels, so that's a point to consider as well for mod purposes if you're relying on bots for message logs
My personal server with me and a backup alt at one point got one of these, while multiple four digit member count places Im on didn't, there is no pattern to who gets or doesn't get it
Those features are generally rolled out at random
yeah the shitposting in here is kinda getting annoying
The built-in audit log includes when a mod deletes a message by a user, but not when the user deletes it themselves, nor what the mesage actually was
Discord does log, but only certain actions, and only that something was done, not what the content was
Especially because a tech channel is so much more useful than just going "look at my new PC parts"
It definitely has my vote
Just because you don't like a topic doesn't make it bloat
But no, this idea genuinely has merit; if people want to discuss tech, that's the best channel to do it in
bruh, rude much?
No, I think that idea is pretty good
I wouldn't exactly call that bloat
Suggestion: Das stops being harsher on himself than he needs to be and accepts that it's okay to mess up sometimes <:KirikaHeart:738932018116821034>
Everything else no
I'm on the same page as End here, as long as it's official or the source islinked directly in the post/first reply, fair game
I seem to remember that current policy is those two types are allowed and everything else gets the boot
Normally I wouldn't and do this kind of thing over dms, but this has been something that so many people have repeatedly expressed frustration over that I feel this one warrants having its discussion out in the open
Given their active, persistent refusal to apply even the most basic caution in avoiding repost accounts, I am putting forward the notion to remove ZGundam's access to <#336297674707828747> and <#336297808221044736>
Pretty sure that's a new beta feature; discord always rolls those out selectively at first, so this place might not have them yet
I second this
dito, I like the way it currently is with some is fine, but if it takes over the whole channel move it elsewhere
First big r/server I join, nice to meet y'all
Hello hello!
yeah, artstyle and general proportions
The overall vibe reminds me of Freedom Planet, I quite like it
very nice job!
you have achieved The Big Guns™️

Has criminally little screentime
That's Ma Chao Barbatos, a thing from the latest Romance of the Three Kingdoms chibi show

HG Uni is the singular Bandai mold that's been used enough to have some mold degradation going on, some of the connections do suffer from that if the connection points are near the line where the halves separate
You might have just gotten one with bad tolerances
Don't think either of those happened on mine
It does everything it needs to do
Honestly, the HG Uni is fine
(KPS being the softer polystyrene that they use on the IBO inner frames, among other things)
They kinda have, their KPS gold is lovely
Been meaning to get the Norn for a while now, but was always at budget whenever HLJ had it in stock
Ayy Banshee

lmao same
Very nice job on the movements, very fluid!


oh it super is
I feel like "XDU provides" is just gonna become the motto of a secret religious order here or something
You mean like this?
yeah, PB
I just fear the inevitable pipeline of that leading to me getting a Nightingale
I have an idea for a mini diorama, discarding the big hyper mega launcher, I feel like that might look quite good
Man, I need to get myself one of these
I hope
But I regularily shop on the Japanese market anyways, this won't be too hard to come by over surugaya or yahoo
Cyber Newtype Story MAD WANG 1160 is also pretty up there, but that one has it beat still
> PILLOW TALK GUNDAM NIGHT=HAWKS!
the dumbest Gundam title has to be from that one weirdass, hard-noncanon One Year War sidestory from the early 90s
Despite my Opinions™️ on the mangas, the Astray designs are quite nice
Gonna get myself that one as well at some point
ayy, nice
Very nice!
I should probably go back and touch up a few places on that
My first kit was the Gaelio Schwalbe by virtue of being the only one that arrived on time for christmas 2018 I believe it was
Als, y'know, zesshou gear
Yeah. The obvious pick is Heavyarms, but I find that DX works a lot nicer with the silhouette
I have mine on the same shelf as Wing Zero with the special feather effect stand and Turn A with moonlight butterfly, and it still catches the eye
yup
DX is fun
Finish looks airbrushed to me

To be fair, Kyrios is very much not supposed to be operating on the ground, so I think the jank feet are excusable
Impulse is fun
I love the shadow effect they have going
Mh, those are very nice!
A 30 meter, 270 ton mech pulling 35g in a space turnfight is not possible to begin with; but it's the premise on which I am writing the story, and the in-universe science will need to conform to the outline I want, not the other way around
I don't give a flying fuck about if my anti-nuke measures are real world possible the same way I ignore material strength, the square cube law, fuel science and dozens of other physical theorems: Because the explanation I have passes as plausible enough without relying on complete magitech, if it were possible irl sometjing like it would likely already be researched, and slavishly adhering to irl physics gets in the way of the rest of the story I want to tell
It's scifi
Dude
Yes, and this stuff blocks mist of it after the initial dose setting it off, to the point where the radiation shielding can tank what little still gets through
This isn't spread out in advance the stuff is a reactive countermeasure; it only comes into that shape once nukes have happened, and because radiation is faster than most other effects of a nuke, it creates a dampening field before the things that can damage the suits arrive
Because it's about a setting of my own creation
But using those as a way to have a breaching nuke and then immediate followup missile swarm doesn't work
Of course, subsequent ones will
It can't if the thing is mounted to the nose of the missily
Not all of space, just enough in front of it that a missile won't get through it
This stuff is not very passable at any significant speed
Because at that point they'd slam into their own field of gooey chaff and if not break from the impact, bog themselves down in it
<@213645184125239317> the countermeasures ~~on top of nukes being shunned and if you use one you'll end up on top of the hitlist of very skilled and highly opinionated bounty hunters, so not a great idea~~ specifically work as a powder that rapidly expands on contact with specific types of radiation to create a temporary barrier against the heat, shockwave and radiation; it's used mainly gor stationary defense, but pretty much every suit carries it just in case, and since a nuke will also blow up everything else sent your way, until the next wave arrives, more of your own countermeasures can be fired
But yeah, how'd you like the build?
(btw; you have the gun upside down)
Such a fun line of kits

very nice
ooooooo
v cool
Very cool robot
Well, everyone who had an emblem
Full squad actually
I do!
Never had it back in the day, really happy I got it now
Man, these things really are as cool as I remember them being
ye
Also, speaking of plastic robots
truuu
ooo, nice
ooo Flag
oo, nice
not 100%, but close enough
Oh yeah, on the topic of the Kamiki Burning, I messed around with the effect parts a bit and glued them into the big beam phoenix finisher move
But yeah, if you have experience with handiwork, you're fine
really you only want something to smoothen out the residue of the gate after clipping it out
yeah, fair
Now it's in the giant painting backlog
Just built that earlier today, was quite fun
You definitely want that for the clear parts
Do you have a hobby knife?
It's a good first kit
HG QanT is fun
mh, nice!
Designed specifically for Gundam, but with some minor tweaks should also be playable for gears probably
Hyperfocus struck and I made a thing.
-Enki, probably
heard a lot of good things about the Moon
Fun little kit, quite enjoyed that one
Also beefed up my HQ with... a second HQ
Built the rest of my Exo Force stuff
very many
yes
This has better fight choreography than some things that aired on TV, incredible job
HOT DAMN that is good
Removed the beak panel line on mine, such an upgrade visually
Age-FX is fun
It's from an as of yet unreleased game


My 90s shelf is pretty much at capacity <:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
And some late UC bois

I was very wrong <:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
I was expecting this to scale with my Revo Evas
Master Grade size, thereabouts
Not technically something I created, but it's going on my robot shelf so I'm putting it here. Beeeeg figure
you say that, but apart from the yellow for the helmet, those were all single layer <:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
decent technique gets you very far
Custom build I did some two years back, all handpainted
I usually recommend starting with handbrushing; with decent paints and a brush that's not tiny, you can get good results, and it's both a lot less upfront investment and less things to look out for over airbrushing
Handbrushing is not affected by weather a terrible amount beyond drying times and excessively high-gloss paints
tbh winter is only really an issue if you spraypaint
Painting is a lot of fun, you should definitely give it a try
Those just don't really justify a dedicated line each, so they get tossed into HGUC
Meanwhile we have all of one kit for HGCC, four for HGFC, five for HGAW and eight for HGAC
tbh if you collect all of HGUC you're past the point of caring which show something is from
Strike, Freedom, Impulse, Destiny, Strike Freedom, Infinite Justice, Dagger L, Windam and now Dagger base as PB
It's a bit silly, but at the same time, most timelines have gotten a single digit number of revive kits, and Seed has just barely broken double digits, not counting recolors
Windam is HGCE, but it's also HGUC#232
HGCE is in the same product numbering as HGUC
no, that's Bandai
Yeah, it's just how Bandai does it's numbering, the revives of AU kits that got a kit back in the day, but now have a new one just get tossed into HGUC
The site follows Bandai's own line nomenclature, so it can be a tad obtuse if you aren't familiar with it
But it's HGCE, so it's listed under HG, not Seed
ah, wait, I'm thinking of the Neo and expansion pack
but does keep the product announcement as placeholder image for a sort of index to what does exist
just... most
Although dalong hasn't covered all of those
Windam is a P-Bandai release, it's listed under Club-G

I went back over to check his most recent reviews, and there'S no panel lining there at all
...actually, which kits were you looking at?
fair, dalon does it mostly to display where the lines would be on the kit for those that do
oh yeah, he does panelline
all the kits are straightbuilds with stickers applied, and if you click on the "Information" text in the top left of the individual reviews, you get the box contents pre-assembly
There's a button on the top right that switches from Korean to English
and he knows how to talk to a camera
His production quality is stellar, that's for sure
I tend to go for Dalong, there's just so much more width there as well
fair enough, yeah
tbh I don't precisely care about what MGK says at all, I think he's very subpar as a builder and his interests do not at all align with what I'm looking for in a model kit
<@344824245362360320> only pic I have on hand, you can see my Strikes up on the top shelf
Haven't built one myself, but if the other Seed revives are anything to go be, it will be very lovely
ooo Windam
or rather, tell which one
<@228659769404030976> ooo, show
Went back over my X1 since the decal sheet I ordered arrived; unfortunately, the decals in it fully refused to work over curved surfaces, so I just went with the sticket, which honestly looks pretty good
Watchamacallit, name is at the tip of my tongue
That's the thing from Muvluv, right?
Ayy, nice
That's a good collection!
even spraypainting with cans, you DEFINITELY want a respirator
It's stuff like this that also makes the pricetag on name brand paints worth it, the good ones are just that much nicer to work with
As a general rule of thumb, that is very true, but if you know what you do, it's not really a hard requirement
paints with good opacity are an absolute godsend
Also nice ReRise in the background
Okay that's actually really sexy, holy shit
ooooo
~Roman soldiers, ca. 35 AD
that's really good
Gonna build the different loadouts
See y'all in two days when I wmwrge from my basement
Perfect ~~Strike~~ opportunity to start learning painting

Stumbled across this; I am getting _ideas_
I wanna say also Task Force Alpha, but like, those were three ships and two of them were blown up in the first combat engagement
aaaaand that's kinda it for thing that are larger than one or two ships crews striking out on their own
Londo Bell, AEUG, post-reformation Crossbone Vanguard
As far as morally defensible UC factions go
I mean _to be fair_
yep <:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
Oh I already have a Barb army alright, I am just expanding it into SD as well
And some rather extensive bpdywork in case of the SD ships
Christmas haul snapped, now on to painting
Genuinely better quality than Lego in places
This is Cobi, they're legit
It's not offbrand Lego
Half a meter by half a meter, _where the fuck am I gonna put this thing_
and my shelf space
OH NO MY WALLET
It feels like such a natural evolution to stick a lot of crap to a flight backpack
Tbh I do like the Ootori, wish it had a 1/144
They're 1/350, so the Iowa class is over a meter long
I also have three of their battleships, which are joyful builds, but absolutely gigantic
I have a bunch of them, they are lovely
They've made some of those, yeah
Although I'd recommend doing it off the runner, so you don't have the spots without paint where the runner gates used to be
it does, ye
fair
I think one of the oooold 08th sets also came with some spare GM heads
Last I checked, the prices in Japan were not too bad, and even after shipping and proxy fees, it's still within acceptable range for a HG
on the western market yes, but you don't shop online for Gunpla on the western market
If you ever feel like getting another to complete the squad; the parachute pack set comes with a GM Ground Type head for that purpose
I bring excellent news
YES
lmaooo
I threw together something stupid
Oooooooo
birthday presents have arrived, and they're only three months ahead of time <:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
very nice!
Using the gesture to steer the plane is such a cool touch

I think I like the one from Frontier more, lemme grab a screencap of that
oooo nice
But the paintjobs are coming along very nicely
Whoof, not fun
What I mean is that the actual finish of the paint looks really good
Overpaint on a wip doesn't count <:GenjuroLaugh:689563633516150872>
Very nice job, that looks really clean
Also, extrapolating from the positively humongous sample size of two shows and a movie that I have seen from Macross, you gotta give the shows some time, they have a tendency to kind of fumble around at the start before they settle in on what they actually want to do
It's not quite as bad as with Gundam where if you ask 500 people to rank all (or even half) of the shows, you'll end up with 500 completely different lists, but opinions split a lot
You kinda need to scout out what sounds like a good time to you personally
I do feel the need to point out that Macross as a franchise is kind of deep in the weeds of the individual shows being very hit or miss depending on the person
Mecha, magical girl, toku and everything in between those points like power armors and shapeshifter battle powers all fall into the same thematic genre of a nominally invulnerable combat avatar contrasting with the physical and mental fragility of its controller
to be fair, they are both part of the same supergenre
Macross, very much falls in line with other old mecha IPs for appearing kind of daunting and impenetrable from the outside
entirely fair lmao
o god why
aww
The funniest one I've seen probably was "everyone's trauma" on big scary moments

Not me reading that and immediately thinking of Gundam 0080

noone is safe from Kanade's utter disregard for personal space
Although I always found the carbon copy basa from Mirrorverse to be a bit cheap and nonsensical, since her Kanade is also dead and by all accounts she should not be nearly as chill as she is
ye. I kinda scrapped it because I couldn't figure out a way to have it go anywhere, but for a while I was playing with the idea of writing a oneshot snippet thing of alive!KanaTsuba fighting something or other with their Xdrive and having an end of season dead!KanaTsuba vision thing
thank you!
riiiight, I got that one from twitter
I assume so, yeah

whooof
although I will raise you Genjiro/Ryoko for Kanadeverse and Genjiro/Finé for adultverse
Fair.
As cursed as the ship is, I love the faces in this
Which would have been hilarious
To be fair, back when that KAnade bodypillow was announced, an art friend of mine did want to do "his own take" on it and just draw a bunch of dust on a daki cover
I assume this is one of the ones that treats TV!Hibiki and XDU!Hibiki as seperate characters
~~and Serena~~
yuuuuuup. Thankfully there's the occasional XDU memoria that throws them a bit of a bone, but still not nearly on the level that it could or perhaps should be
^^^^^^^^^ this so much. Of all the underutilized dynamics, Maria/Chris by far takes the cake
They were on an honestly pretty good track with Maria's memory thing in AXZ, until their time ran out and they just had to go "oh she looked sad every time she beat me, so no problem, moving on"
yeah, the problem is that in too many seasons, they try to give everyone something and just end up not giving anyone enough time
Praise XDU
At least in the show
Actually scratch that, Maria's dynamic with _anyone_ is woefully underdeveloped
yeah, that. TsubaMari is woefully underdeveloped
Bold of you to assume that they'll have radio on at all, given the two pop stars with them in the car
yeah, Garie's just looks hella spicy, which I'd ostensibly be here for
<:misato_itadakimasu:900793574419988500>
Lemme do this
hold on
On the wiki there are transparent versions of each 3 group, and I feel like it is also gonna have the beach
Although actually; I feel like it might be possible to recreate with the assetdumps that we do have

My pixiv is decently sfw most of the time
Depends on the tags you frequent, I suppose
Pixiv is 20% cool robots, 20% sfw anime girls, 40% porn and 20% everything else by volume

yeah, derped, forgot which channel we were in
reminds me of this convo from a bit ago
oh yeah, that one is amazing
My memories of AXZ before I came here and seen things brought up about it:
-Ignite duets
-Sain Germain existed, and was on a pirate ship with Finé at some point
-Caligostro's "the power of a woman!" line
-Prelati being grumpy
-Adam being a general creep and also the one time he wielded the power of a nuke and then couldn't fight anymore, and his god form/origin story
-Tiki being a walking red flag
-Hibiki turns into a cocoon of god for a bit

Things that came back to me since I joined:
-tomato
-Maria's trip to her brain was not really good
Tbh most of my memory of the Alchemists is from XDU
Nah that's a happy expression by Prelati standards
3_skip made a stitch of an image chain in here
<https://www.pixiv.net/en/artworks/79956595>
ah, right
From the manga?
But yes, Tsubasa deserves all the hugs
~~I suppose neither of these are wrong~~
KanaTsuba always good
Ah yes, Nyalchemists
3_skip https://www.pixiv.net/en/artworks/70756184
oooo more Kanade art 👀
Den beat me to it
ah yeah, there it is
Oh that already exists
I have genuinely seen Chris shipped with every wielder, and only for Serena was it framed as not-quite-serious
~~no that's arguably Chris, she gets shipped with more people~~
HEH
~~but then again, this is the memory that allows Kanade to overwhelm Brisingamen and use its power to save Tsubasa, so it all works out~~
ye
Also, I love that XDU makes it canon that the moment at which Tsubasa and Kanade fell in love was when she ran up to baby Kanade to hold her hand after a failed test
:Marialewd: :Chrishelp: :Tsubasahowaboutit:
honestly all three of their faces would make for good emotes
"I don't wanna be here, but I really really do wanna be here"
I love the expression on Chris' face so much
also, on that note: 3_skip
amazing
...nope, the base version of it already does

Kiraki is definitely up there
aaaaaa more KanaTsuba art
Watch as the armor purge reveals Nehushtan this time
Some amazing gear/Gundam shitposts in here
https://www.pixiv.net/en/artworks/97265298
"Power of a god, you say?" has to be my favorite subcategory of memey gear fanart
Even when those models are assetrips from games
Although I have also definitely met my share of weirdos who really hate the thought of anyone else having "their" models
Yeah, I've seen a bunch of model packs in that style float around for a bunch of other franchises, I'd be surprised if these were any different
I need to track down these models if I ever get into 3d shenanigans, they seem very fun to mess around with
o fuck that'S actually really cute
The rest exists, I suppose
shoulders, headgear, claws and cape/attached spikies are cool too
I very much like her wings

Z how many times are you gonna post those rp accounts
...official XDU art
But like, just the right kind of it
oh I hate this

noone saw that
shit wrong channel
ish
also, speaking of
gotcha
I can't tell if this emote is in agreement or an excited "Finé yes please" xD
As long as you're not gunning for Finé, you're probably good
has them all in it <:TsubasaBliss:672861879000891432>
mh, that collection is really fun
heh
oh that one is so funny
It's adorable
Tsubasa just has this experssion of "I can't complain, but I feel like I should, but I also don't want to"
that one's really good as well, but I think my fave has to be this one
I love how in all of those pics, Tsubasa is just there in the middle and you can see the cogs in her brain turning trying to figure out what to do
ooo yeah, that one

Did someone say gear hugs?
good hug
aww
eh, either works
Ame no Hibikiri?
Ah yes, Ame no Hababikkie.
^^
ooo, actually don't know that one yet
They way you say that I assume she's from Birdie Wing?
Nanoha is entirely unfamiliar ground for me
I have no idea what any of these words mean

Do you have the source?
yoooo that DX armor

Same. Also for the inevitable Freedom 3, Justice 3 and Destiny 2 vs Providence 3 fight
~~now if only Go Nagai stans would understand that~~
Or any specified limits to the scope of power, because when omnipotence is the point that doesn't really work, and discussing if the multidimensional deity that can rewrite reality at will or the thing that eats universes wins is not exactly something that can or should be attempted to be answered
exactly
Whenever Mazinger Zero gets brought up in powerscaling, I tend to just copypaste a list of this and some half dozen to dozen other things that by default win aganst everything not in that list and unanswerable against everything in that list because even trying to comprehend a power that is by definition beyond human comprehension is an exercise in futility to put it kindly, and on in idiocy to put it less kindly
Meanwhile Hololive, having put all four in the same bracket:
I mean technically, dust is still a solid, just very finely dispersed
forgot about that one
ooo
oh those are going right into my wallpaper folder
Protective Garie is a treasure
that second one is so good
very nice
d'aw
But there also are also occasional hardware stores that sell drinkable alcohol as cleaners
Sold as a beverage yeah, prolly
Depends
I mean, almost every liquid is drinkable once
Usually, yeah
So yeah, functionally, this is storebought rubbing alcohol
I believe 96% is around the mark that nominally pure ethanol settles at without a ventilation system to keep it from absorbing water molecules from the air
aww
Love these dorks
I need to track down the ooooold kit of it some day
G-Falcon is such a cool unit
that's honestly one of my favorite exploits in G Gen Crossrays, you can cheese the morale lock if you click something else and then quickly move the cursor over the attack as the menu collapses into the sidebar. Insta Twin Satellite Cannon
yeah
...man, the DX is such a sexy design
oo, those are good stitches
yeah, I think it's fucking up the scroll distance for embeds
Discord is being gucky and keeps scrolling up when checking a new channel, so at first I only saw the header without the image, combined with that thought I had clicked on <#336297808221044736> and was very confused by the thought of you doing an actual lewd alt of that prompt <:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>

fair
I think GX/AXZ is my favorite for designs across the board

Also yeah, AU TsubaChris is good
Most of the time when everyone else is going oh god they're so gay, but all I'm getting is functional close friendship, but there's a couple times where I can see it
Depending on the scene is probably the better phrasing
It's veeeery situational for me
certified Good Shit
3_skip some day I'm gonna throw money at an art friend to draw this with Tsubasa on the bottom and the other three on top
This looks like it's a Revue Starlight thing
from Sam's X2 fanfiction
It really does look like that
Okay yeah, nevermind then
ah
I have no idea what this is about, but the game has officially been out for less than a week and I know a lot of folks who are avoiding any and all info on it
Might wanna put a spoilertag on that, even if it's heavily out of context
I've actually heard decent things about Inazuma Eleven, but it never really caught my interest
But then again so does Shinkalion and Hello Kitty, so what do I know
That seems like a peculiar combination
I think the only two proxy battle shows I've seen any noteworthy amount of were Build shows and Digimon Tamers
And since I really liked Fighters, I don't doubt that I will enjoy it
mh yeah, that one has been on the list for a while
I can never keep those straight in my head
Is Danball Senki LBX or is the LVX localization name yet another thing

Legilis is amazing it it upsets me that it gets reprinted never

for a second I thought those sleeves were comically oversized boobs
After three seasons of not having her shit together, I like that this is the end point instead of having her tied down by insecurities again
It shows her being a competent leader that holds her ground in battle and is trusted with and capable of taking care of the rest of the team out of battle
Maria just existing is honestly one of the parts that I like about XV
It's mostly that with how much is going on, the gears don't get nearly as many of the small character moments that the other seasons had
AXZ didn't do a great job at that, but it at least tried
I've gone into more detail in <#336310266654490624> before, but the long and short of it is that XV doesn't really feel like gear to me anymore, it lacks the kind of character focus that I want from the show
yeah
XV is my least favorite
Nah, I agree
oh that is SO CUTE

Tsubasa is very much rocking the Gungnir outfit
oooo
Exactly. Angry, but AU Basa2 would still be there as a presence to mellow her out
I mean yes, but for the purpose of that hypothetical AU, it would not be the main factor anymore
Although one thing that I would find very interesting to see is an AU Kanade where her Tsubasa didn't die, but rather only disabled in a way that prevents her from fighting herself, and has to stick to supporting her as staff; would be interesting to see a solo Kanade whose starting position is not that of guilt and wrath
It might be interesting to see AU Miku echoing main!Miku in picking up a relic (or something else) for the sake of helping her Hibiki, but at the same time, not sure what I'd do with that exactly
Once this show is over and we've seen Aerial's final form, I'm gonna throw money at an art friend to draw a thing of various hero suits gearing up for battle with Fullarmor, HWS, Assault-Buster, Meteor Units, bigger guns and all that, while God, Lupus Rex and the two or three others that never get any big extra equipment just look at it like "should we be doing something here"

that is kinda the vibe I've been getting
I figured that at least a quarter of these were not gonna fit the bill on one side of the other, but since that is basically the sum total of shows that I could find that can on some basis be described with both, the funny took precedent over the accuracy

And Serena!
The higher up you are (within a certain limit), the further you'll be seen from
it does still make it harder to hit because of things on the ground that might end up in the missile's path, as well as giving a smaller time window to fire the thing in the first place
So yeah, if you can't go above, your best bet is to go really low
Flying low is actually a reasonably well-proven strategy against anti-air weaponry, as it gives less time to lock on for guided weapons and requires larger movement to aim for unguided, as well as providing more interference
There have been unconfirmed reports from a few weeks ago before everything went hot that Russia has allegedly shelled secret military bases with artillery because they detected a large amount of phone signals in places where you wouldn't expect large numbers of people
Air superiority and long range artillery has definitely taken up even more importance compared to direct ground warfare in the large scale, as well as information control/usage
That's kind of the kicker here, there hasn't really been any big symmetrical (read: army vs army, as opposed to army vs insurgent groups) war in decades where this could really have been tested out, so even the countries themselves are currently giving whatever they have devised for that something of a trial by fire
Fly fast, funny Fulcrum
Not to mention the fact that for most things, the mid-or even shortterm use of a campaign like that would be dubious at best; if you somehow did manage to get into a vital system of an enemy, the last thing you want to do is alert them to your presence, instead taking out as much data for as long as you can, because that will be infinitely more useful than annoying a few people for a few minutes
In which case congratulations, you have just handed your secret weapon over to the enemy
Which leads to the second point, you have no idea if you actually have found something worth attacking, or if you're just attacking a decoy that is used to monitor and replicate your method of entry
The big problem with hacking is that even at the best of times, any trick that isn't a matter os social engineering (getting someone else to do something that allows you in) or guessing some passwords somewhere, anything that is actually what people understand as hacking, using vulnerabilities in software to do something, generally speaking is only going to work once against any semi-competent target, because once you have used a means of entry, that means of entry will be patched up so you can't do it again
as opposed to just general trolling
Assuming that actual hacking is meant here, as in, illegally accessing a computer system
It is also a bad idea to do that, because you have no idea if you'll actually be hitting the right thing
Not least because attacking state channels like that is an act of war
That's a terrible idea for a lot of reasons
That's not entirely true. Gazprom was holding up their end of the contract, it's just that the German gas companies ordered less gas than the years before and sold a lot of what reserves they did have for a quick buck as prices increased instead of holding them back for when they might be needed
Has been debunked
https://old.reddit.com/r/acecombat/comments/t0r484/ghost_of_kiev_megathread/
those tubes could be loaded with anything honestly
The problem is that the insistence on just trusting an unsourced claim like this works to lower people's guard overall, and makes it easier for malicious actors to exploit that belief; hence my wording of "facilitating the spread of", instead of plainly "spreading"
Yeah but we haven't. We have no indication that this guy even exists, much less is who they claim to be
let me put it this way: You are actively facilitating the spread of misinformation
All of this could be complete horseshit that some guy in his basement made up to mess with people
The problem isn't any individual point, the problem is that nothing of what you said has any proof associated with it
you really didn't listen to a thing I just said, did you
If you want a source for my claim that misinformation exists about the current war, I'll gladly give you a sourced list of known misinformation campaigns from the past few days
Yes, I am also a random guy on the internet, and thus you should not take any unsources claim of mine at face value
Misinformation is a thing we need to combat, and you are not helping
well, "sources"
You are a random person on the internet, as are your sources
Do not trust random people on the internet
That is my valid criticism
There is not a single thing in any of this that makes any of it credible
Dude you're a guy on discord, posting unsourced screenshots from other discord servers
Especially since some of these claims have a very high bar of being bullshit with how specific they are about what would be top secret info that only a very limited number of people have access to
Nothing of what you posted has any amount of credibility to it, and your insistence that it is if anything makes me think that you are trying to spread disinformation
If anything, it makes me doubt your motivatiopn on the whole
"Trust me, I can verify that these discord screenshots are legit" is not proof of anything
That, also, is something anyone could say
If this were to be believable, each of these points would need at least two links to different sources corroborating that
yeah literally anyone can type up anything there
this is the thing I was looking for

To be fair, there have always been people predicting wars that didn't happen and swearing that wars wouldn't happen and then they did
wait wrong file
Highest in the world
as in, 26 trillion $ national debt
the US economy is fucked tho
As a side note, Russia's status as legitimate successor of the USSR is very much being contested currently
also re:VDV thread
Calling paratroopers "weaker than normal infantry" is a dangerous understatement
That seems like a very dubious claim to me
This whole operation was arrogance in planning start to finish
They have no second wave, nothing to keep up supply lines
Not even that
I mean, the Soviets already got their asses kicked in the middle east, too
Don't underestimate handheld heavy weapons. Paratroopers very much are equipped with machineguns and RPGs
lmao thanks. I originally set it as a placeholder until I could throw something together, but it ended up sticking xD
It's all wishful thinking and propaganda, with little deeper knowledge
Also, <@!174272493777977344> - judging by those two threads, I would not trust anything that user posts
yes, but a ure Infantry unit doesn't have those, either
Paratroopers, in every country of the world, are an elite force, with far superior training and better equipped than normal forces
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9pVEP0AzZ4 very important points in here
That one is people making a big deal out of a throwaway line; the whole thing begins and ends with something to the tune of "leftwing extremists have claimed responsibility for bombing on infrastructure"
All of those, to my knowledge, are entirely false accusations
no
I have had the misfortune of interacting with someone who made up allegations of nazism and paedophilia against an anime translator over the fact that he didn't make a Kaworu line in the new Eva subs as gay as the old subs did, and with conscious effort poured fuel into the fire over various social media platforms; I am referring to those types
There are certainly people who do aim at turning things that way; I won't pretend to know how much of those actually mean it vs which are bad actors intentionally trying to make some "other side" they consider their enemy look bad and unreasonable, but I do feel confident in saying that a not insignificant portion of both types exists; this is the "culture" part to me, groups that intentionally try and escalate drama to that state
The term gets overused a lot to undermine valid criticism and deplatforming, so I am drawing a very narrow definition to mean the cesspool, and only the cesspool
Any method not aiming at that is not canceling in my book, and my gripes don't necessarily apply there
The definition of canceling that I work under is [make accusations against someone in a space they are not directly involved in] > [wait for people to rile themselves up] > [at critical point, the hate becomes self-sustaining regardless of input] > [spills over into harassment]
That cancelling someone is aimed at a small set of people at most/usually just one individual, whereas a grassroots political movement seeks to change a systemic issue
For the record, not saying to just let assholes roam free, just that riling people up on social media to then let them do unregulated and usually disproportional harrassment is not the way to go about it
Very much so, my problem is exactly that cancel culture is ultimately the latter presenting itself as the former and attempting to enact similar punishment
There is no justice, only hate that may or may not hit the right target
I believe in the principle of a fair trial; my problem with cancel culture, or any other form of hatemob is, simply put, that it does not.
There's a concerningly large amount of cases where the base accusations turned out to be completely fabricated, but that did not stop anyone because that would mean admitting that you were wrong and maybe overreacting without verifying any claims, so it is the much more convenient option to simply keep harassing an innocent person
It is literally throwing shit to the wall and hoping some of it will stick, collateral damage be damned
Well no, cancel culture is bad because it is fundamentally riling up a hatemob that historically does not care if it hits the right target
Very much so; but I also include unsuccessful attempts at doing so under "this sucks and you shouldn't do it"
Regardless of wether or not this one time succeeded
My point here is that people tried, it was in blatant bad faith, didn't work but is indicative of how this subset of people does things, and that it sucks
I genuinely do not understand what you are getting at
Ignoring the bit where people blew up him co-translating a (entirely safe for work, mind you) loli doujin years ago and liking Girls und Panzer to him being a Nazi paedophile
My entire point is that he shouldn't be, but people tried to frame him for things he didn't do
Dan Kamemitsu is not working for Netflix, he is directly employed by Anno and co
I find it rather disingenuous to blame khara's in-house translator for something NEtflix does
The recent surge of US anti-gay laws is concerning to say the least
bruh
This is not just a minor security reduction, this is a wide open gate for phishing attacks
"masked as another file" like, for example, the discord scam posted above, or every other phishing mail ever
This is a massive security vulnerability
And if you don't get the popup asking if you want to save that file, chances are you won't catch that
Not really; a lot of scams work on the basis of masking an executable files as another file
This is adding a great many points of failure to what is already a fragile at best protection
yeah but there is also a long list of times where that didn't work
There is a long history of attacks that don't even require you to open an executable file
this is a terrible idea on all fronts
But virus detection is unreliable by its very nature
that is exactly what they're doing
Where Firefox does ask and doesn't just assume you meant to click that download link
if you go to about:config and set the parameter browser.download.improvements_to_download_panel to false, that restores it to the previous setting
But
You can set every imaginable file type to not autodownload, but not executables
Not in the usual interface, at least
There is no setting for it
No
but, not the point here
This is _**E X T R E M E L Y**_ bad and I have a lot of not very nice words for whoever decided that this was a good idea
On a similar note in cybersecurity matter: Firefox no longer asks before downloading executable files

PSA, fuck Twitter
https://twitter.com/sunny_bunny39/status/1621175925244133376
I don't think they published anything over here (Germany), so the name mostly brings dubiously funny memes to mind
But yeah, xi's chonk is really good
Stuff like IBO's super slim waist and wide shoulders is completely my jam
I do quite like the recent trend of hourglass mechanical design
I love it a lot
Xi is one hell of a design
I can agree to that
I seem to recall an announcement to that end
2023 I think
And rightfully so, both of these movies are awesome
Shin Eva and HF alone made like 120 million US in box office
and Gundam Hathaway, too
also saying that 2021 was bad completely ignores the absolute blockbuster movie releases
Started out as a complete fever dream, but ended out really good
Megaton Musashi somehow also turned out to be a banger
||Somewhere halfway through Ep 1, a guy dies, and then when the opening plays at the end you see him standing on a brightly lit field of flowers, with a very large amount of open space to either side||
This is not exactly a spoiler since it becomes very apparent as early as the first episode, but it's ||one of those shows where you'll have a hard time doing a second season without introducing a bunch of new people just by virtue of the body count the show has||
First season is very self-contained tho
the last two episodes, yeah
Shit got me closer to tears than Grave of the Fireflies
but yeah, go watch 86 -EIGHTY SIX-
That's such a banger show
If that wasn't in the video, he is objectively wrong
86 ruled
But yeah, stuff like removing guns/cigarettes on the other hand, that is the actual censorship they did
There's no censorship there, just a change so things still make sense
It's like that time where some JRPG or another had a character name changed from Mist to something else in the German release because over here "Mist" means horse poop
Localization != censorship
yeah, that
I don't mind fanservice usually, but the sheer insistence with which they bring up that everyone is underage is just uncomfortable
To be fair, there are good reasons not to watch Strike Witches
||whoof||
yeah, Yuuki Yuuna is also on the list, same friend showed me a few clips of it that looked quite interesting
Offhand mentioned it to the guy that got me into gear and he was like "oh yeah, 100%, that show rules"
First time I heard about it was from the about me on a guy on one of my servers that just, in all caps, read WATCH SYMPHOGEAR AND FLIP FLAPPERS
I didn't even know the genre, I just had some of my gear friends go "trust me it's good" and it was
I recommend anyone to go watch it knowing as little as possible about what you're getting into
Flip Flappers is a lot, but in a good way
86 gud
THANK YOU
I don't even like the Kshatriya that much, but I'm gonna get myself one purely in her honor
Marida is the best thing about Unicorn ||and she deserved so much better than she got||
My main problem with Unicorn is that it's just kinda boring for the most part, but the politics are definitely  on the 😬 end
Let's paint the faction whose entire strategy is literally prewar Imperial Japan with the serial numbers filed off as equal if not better than the EFF, why not
yeeeaaaah, the Sleeves are... not great
Eva fans are the reason I call myself "fan of [thing]" instead of "[thing] fan" because I want no association with these lunatics, Gundam fans are the reason why I keep doing it
saaaaame
But anyway, more pleasant things
But like... if your flag is the nazi war flag with the swastika replaced, your battle cry is one word off from a nazi battle cry and the first thing you do in the war is gas a civilian colony and drop it as a WMD, _maybe_ that's a sign that you're not meant to be the good guys by any stretch of scope, and it equal parts baffles and worries me just how many people fail to get that memo
It very much is, yeah
Straightup, a while ago One Of Those Types ended up on one of my places and in the process of defending Zeon beat for beat went through every talking point of real world Nazi apologists
yepppp
Also yes, there are even more wannabe fascists than in most other scifi fandoms
A while ago some assholes on Twitter decided that there wasn't enough gatekeeping n Gundam circles already and went to fabricate a fuckton of alleged interviews about how an unnamed background character in the original show was supposed to be the original protagonist for the express purpose of making fun of new people who don't know any better and believe it
ya. There's a few model kit places that are cool, but the general Gundam fanbase is terrible for so many reasons
I raise you 86
Just stay the fuck away from any sort of online discourse around it, these are an arms race of bad takes from all sides
It's hands down my favorite show in the franchise, and one of my favorite shows overall
Both of these are more akin to the likes of Band of Brothers than your typical scifi show
Then IBO and 08th are probably the things for you
I'm in camp love it for both, but there are people who didn't have a great time with them
Regarding 00 and IBO I will give a slight warning, both of these are very love it or hate it shows
yeah, I'm just giving a few points that in my opinion are good introductions, watching all of these is quite the time committment that I wouldn't force on anyone
As long as you are aware that other things exist, you have all the context you need
These people are wrong
Some people will tell you you have to have seen all of Gundam to truly appreciate Turn A
G probably won't be your cup of tea if you're looking for something grounded, very much a martial arts show with robots
I also tend to recommend After War Gundam X, G and Turn A as starting points
Hikaru had the coolest mechs in general
I dismantled all of mine at some point unfortunately
Never got that one unfortunately
That shit was my JAM
hell yeah
Exo-Force
Zaku Warrior best Zaku
designs looks super cool tho
And don't mind graphic violence and a lot of general unpleasantness I should add
Worth watching if you like weird 90s scifi things
So Genocyber is a thing
But I do need to go pass out now, have a good one
I ave it on the list, I'll give it a shot eventually
I've heard pretty much only "it rules" and "it sucks" about it, nothing in between
Is Zearth the thing from Bokurano
One day I'll throw money at an art friend of mine to draw all of these, and tiny small in the foreground Hibiki looking at her fist and going "the power of a god, huh?"
ah yeah, gotcha
so all of humanity distilled into one being
I haven't seen Ideon yet, but isn't its whole thing that it is quite literally space Cthulhu running on the fabric of reality itself
~~as if any one of these listed here aren't~~
oh and Awakened "I can bluescreen reality and turn back time to before you existed" Unicorn
no, the universe-sized final form
I'm partial to Unit 01 mainly because I really like how Eva shows just how incomprehensibly powerful a god entity actually is
Also add EoE Unit 01, Ideon, Getter Emperor, Mazinger/Mazinkaiser Zero, Genocyber and a few more to the list of "why do you fucking bother, noone wins here these are all gods"
yuuuup
I mostly hang around mecha parts, so powerscaling debates in my circles are unfortunately often times stupider and more pointless than the ones involving DBZ or JoJos
I hesitate to call it that on grounds of at times painfully surface-level knowledge
it's powerscaling debates, except somehow worse
yeah, same
Such is the fate of weird old scifi unfortunately
yea.
I'd love to have that thing up on my shelf
I wish there was literally any model kit or figure for the Genocyber itself apart from that one resin statue a million years ago
*angrily yells about every char clone ever*
But yes, Graham Gundam
Also it's R4, not R5
That's part of the backlog at this point
That came out almost 30 years ago tho
apparently pretty good if you don't mind some initial weirdness
old ass show
riiiight, that one
I know I've heard of that one before, but the name excapes me
I love Mika's completely deadpan delivery and then "was that bit really necessary?"
there's a guy on youtube who put together a compilation of all the special voicelines for the God finger in Crossrays, it's great
The best part is that during these few appearences, the suit remains completely undamaged while GN-X are dying around it
No GN drive or beam weapons
absolute madlad
And speaking of, there is one dude in the movie with like two seconds of total screentime who fights the ELS using a pre-S1 Tieren space type
to be fair, by the time of Trailblazer you could stick Setsuna in just about anything and he'd probably wreck shop with it
Also not like anyone else ~~or should I perhaps say anyone ELS~~ is using it
Yeah, it ncely brings him full circle
https://twitter.com/SunglassPri/status/1493370250104123397
I still have a few dozen installation floppies for some Windows 95 graphics software lying around that I picked up when the place I used to work at cleared out some old tech
But the story retroactively makes the story of Seed worse
yeah, the designs are good
And bar Victory, all of them are also pretty objectively worse than even Valvrave
I fully agree that it's terrible, but having suffered through Victory Gundam, Seed Astray, 00F and Code Geass Akito the Exiled, I can safely say that I hate all four of these more
Still mildly salty about all the talent wasted on shows like Valvrave
yeah, too many shows trying to be The Next Gundam™️
You could also make a case for Code Geass, but that was so late that I'd say it's more the groundwork for 2010s
I'd say Seed more so than Destiny, but yeah, thereabouts.
Gunbuster is very much a show where the thematic oomph takes precedent over the character arcs
But there's a handful of moments where the show just hits super right
oh yeah, the romance plotlines are just kinda there
My experience with Gunbuster was five episodes of "okay this is neat, but I don't see why everyone says it's so great" and then one episode of "oh, here it is, yeah no that scans"
That's my only real gripe with non-Inferno DLC
I still wish that we got Airmaster Burst and Leopard Destroy in the DLC
fuuuuuuck Inferno mode
Crossrays is good as long as you don't get the expansion pass
Wing G-Unit was also pretty good
yeah, I'm still super happy that we got Gekkou in Crossrays
Been meaning to give it a shot for a while
I've heard good things about 00P
Does a really good job at striking the balance of being its own thing and being relevant to the main story, without ever eclipsing it
The best Gundam sidestory that I've read is IBO Gekkou
Oh yeah, definitely
The bit about Phantom Pain almost causing a war with them on accident was neat
I don't know enough about Delta Astray to say anything to that end; I remember reading some bit about their tech that made me go hold on a second, but yeah, by itself they'Re fine
Either way, it is a monumentally stupid plot point
(For those unaware, Seed was originally supposed to be in a timeline place similar to that of G-Reco now, as a literal "Seed of a new timeline", millennia down the line from UC)
Is this a thing of um akshually the original pitch for Seed is canon
waaaaaiiiit
that's somehow worse than everything I was expecting
lmfao
Whose brain is it
o god
oh you mean the AI thing
Which one is 8 again
"oh yes, Mars people now exist"
Everything after it I only know through summaries
X Astray is just the point where I stopped reading the story itself
Oh I know
All they had to do to fix that fight was not show the countdown go all the way to 1 second left
And then the sequel goes ||Hey remember the three Gundams at the end that were a big deal? Well there was one more that they just threw out fully functioning, top secret tech that really can't be allowed to fall into enemy hands still installed and a literal ten year old found it except that ten year old is another dying clone and also even more Jesus than people make Kira out to be and it also got repaired completely free of charge and without even getting the tech data by a woman who hates Lowe's guts because he killed her brother, all because, and I quote, "He's interesting"||
no, at least the first three were fully ready to go
Which creates a bigger plothole because we still see ||the cockpit being completely melted, regardless of Lowe allegedly blocking the blast||
and then Orb has a second mass driver that makes the whole battle around the island pointless ~~that they just leave because "it's moving, how would anyone ever find it" right after they finished fighting off an attack by people who did find it~~
And then Lowe is the reason the Strike vs Aegis battle went the way it did
The story starts with three/four/five extra Gundams at Heliopolis that Zaft just didn't want
yeah, but it's the sum of "remember that cool thing? Well here's something arguably bigger that noone cared about"
And if nmot him, the Red Frame piloted by someone else
Astray goes out of its way to make Lowe (Red Frame pilot) the lynchpin of every major historical event
Destiny is not a great show, but it is so in its own right; apart from That One Retcon, nothing it does retroactively compromises the integrity of Seed
No
By taking every thing that happened in it and either going "actually this only worked because our new protagonistman that never showed up in the anime was here" or repeating it in a way that takes away all of the significance of the original
I'm not super expecting it, but would be neat to see Marchosias in motion
I'm fairly excited for Urdr Hunt
With my raid squads, I can clear a solid half of the maps in the game in a single turn
Way too slow, you can't push at all
I abhor the ship mechanics
But I still find range to be one of the most important stats for keeping up attack momentum
Oh yeah, raid squads for life
I love the 11 maxed out on funnel attacks
5 tiles is the minimum base range I find enjoyable to play tbh
~~and you can cheese those if you play with mouse~~
Stock yeah, but the morale locked attacks went up to 9
Nobel had too short range for my liking
I only hate the Expansion pass; the four before it were great
oh no, that's normal DLC
Shows up a couple of times in Crossbone
Gundam F91 protag
I'm tangentially aware of some of the plotlines he has
lmao yeah, kid deserves some rest
Yeah, that's fair. I haven't actually read Crossbone yet, so I can't speak to that end, I'll take your word there
*looks in the general direction of Crossbone*
Although those also have a tendency to notoriously never end
Or spinoffs to existing things
yepp.
One of the reasons I like mecha, usually very good about that
As much as I enjoy watching GuP for the dumb fun of ridiculous tank action and increasingly obscure history references, yeah it kinda sucks
The old artstyle has that really nice mysterious, kinda melancholy vibe to it that's just completely lost for S4
And yeah, the vibe just isn't there anymore
Bar the last three or four eps, it's way too much people standing around instead of fighting
But the thing was just really badly written for the most part
I don't super mind the artstyle change
yeah S4 is not great
Show finally getting what it deserves
I like the fact that everyone puts DxD in god tier
Late to the party, but;
Made a funny. Spoilers for 86 S1.
I don't usually like the "just a toy commercial" argument since it gets used in bad faith a lot, but this time there is not a lot of other ways to describe it, these exist to sell Metal Builds
Basically
Considering that this will be written by the same guy who did 00F and 00I, my expectations for the story are... not high
ah, gotcha
Model and all
I mean, she is a vtuber
I still haven't seen any of the original four Gundam works, and I don't plan on doing so any time soon
I don't really believe in the idea of required watches outside of direct sequels following the largely same cast
even that, the show gives enough glimpses that you can piece things together
Kinda burned out on Gundam a bit currently
some day
As long as you're aware of the broad strokes of Divers, ReRise does a good enough job at getting you up to speed
It really isn't tbh
I'll go back some day to finish off the list, but it will be a hot minute until then
About three quarters each of the Galbaldy Rebake debut and one of the Red Beret ones
At least judging by the episode and a half that I've seen where everyone tells me that it doesn't get better than that
yeah, ReRise makes vanilladivers so much better retroactively
So gimme like two years and I might have seen it <:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
I've been meaning to check that out for a while
I know, and it's one of the reasons why I typically don't watch those
The thing I've heard is that ||Sei gets sidelined completely, he eventually gets eclipsed by a guy who doesn't care about Gunpla, China exists only as a delivery driver and Reiji/Aila are heavily implied to have found a way back to visit at the end, but aren't even shown on screen for a second||
The things I've heard about how it handles the legacy of the first show make me not particularily look forward to it
That show was written by nerds and it's amazing
It was, but I'll argue that it portrayed the things that make Gunpla fun better than pretty much anything els
I've heard extremely mixed things about Try
Battlogues and Beginning G are fair in that regard, can't speak to Try and Vanilladivers
Genuinely two of the best shows we have gotten out of Gundam
Counterpoint: Fighters, ReRise
I have no experience with nor interest in Precure, so I can't comment on that
Marketing is gonna marketing, but it's not a case of old He-Man cartoon where the designs were made before anyone knew what the show was gonna be
That does not discount the fact that the writers put their heart into what they're doing
But the stories are a lot more than that
Like sure, the designs are there to sell toys, whatever
yeah, "just exists to sell toys" does a disservice to most things Gundam
(need to go pass out, let's continue this some other time)
Oh yeah, satellite cannon is one of the most viscerally cool and terrifying weapons Gundam has ever produced
I'll agree on Dome and that the far more interesting end would have been to not kill Bloodman, since he seems to genuinely have learned something
I mean yeah, but they've got their tail kicked in so hard that their usual antics probably aren't gonna get them far
I'd argue that the fact that it ends the way it does gives the important things more weight, because it's a "okay crisis averted, now let's work to make things better longterm" rather than a "everything is fixed now, good job team"
I wouldn't say so
Starting with Wing was the real mistake, if nothing else because it spawned all of the people who insist that the show is the best written thing ever after watching it on saturday morning tv as a kid
~~a shame that it had to hit X, easily one of the best of the bunch~~
Almost like airing four shows nonstop is gonna tire people out of your franchise <:Ver:704169051391524875>
yeah, without Seed, Gundam probably would not be around today
I like Seed's aesthetic quite a bit; but the overall hourglass shapes and massive backpacks are admittedly lasertargeted at my design preferences
I do not care in the slightest about UC watchorder
My first mainline UC thing I watched was F91
Granted, I have absorbed enough of the plot points through conversation that I can give you a reasonably detailed timeline of up until like halfway through the Gryps war
oh yeah, right
Wait he didn't? I remember looking at the list of someone in charge of the whole thing, and it was just SoL
Very different types of shows that need different skills to do
Yeah, but that doesn't translate well to war dramas
Worldbuilding is just a bunch of stock elements smushed together, I'm honestly not sure if the show even realizes the undertones it has
honestly the show felt too scatterbrained even for that
There's so many cool ideas in it, it's a shame that the director is just really bad at mecha
yeah
This show was directed by a slice of life guy and it shows
Nothing lasted for more than an episode and a half
Nah, main problem was the lack of object permanence for plotlines
||Since Kenbu Zan has been announced I know MC dude won't stay dead, but that would be pretty cool if he was and the show was forced to grapple with that||
Last three KKS were actually pretty decent
lmao
But yeah, ep 1 was such a drug trip, 2 was suddenly good, 3 was shit again, 4 was good-ish and from there it just WENT
nevermind me
...oh wait, Megaton is in fall
Megaton was surprisingly good, and KKS... well, here's hoping S2 will be better than S1
oh no, not in the sense that I didn't know these were gonna happen, in the sense that these are things I know I'll watch
...wait there is, S2 of Kyokai Senki and Megaton
I'd need to check if there's anything of interest to me coming up
It always takes my brain a second to parse that name as Anti-beam coat, because ABC is the German version of NBC and I'm like "hold on what, who is throwing around prohibited weapons?"
Yeah that's pretty fucking alright
A shame that the movie bombed so hard
Man, Nadesico was good
But either way, someone with that repertoire is just not the right guy for series comp on a show like this
Got the guy mixed up, that one's on me
Ep 16-27
That's legitimately the best way to do it
Watch Age-2 standalone and don't bother with anything else in it
Honestly
You're seeing a causation where there is none
Which is just not the case
You say that like there is only one John Bandai making every decision, and because he wants to sell toys right now, he doesn't think about the story
Mechanical design and toy production is completely seperate from writing staff
These aren't even the same departments responsible for it tho
Hell, it doesn't even have anything to do with the aesthetics of the show beyond the robots
That has nothing to do with the story
That's just a matter of mechanical design
yeah
They prerender the animations on transparent background, just have a jpg as enemy sprite with backgrounds and warships beign the only thing actually in the game because those are too big to have a default placement for the animation and prerendering all that would make the filesize explode
yeah, that
Focus on making the designs sellable is jut every show that Sunrise has made, and we still got some absolute bangers out of it
The irony there is that that is what Gundam has always been, from the get-go, so that's not really the cause here
Gyoubu is great
You can look at any given mech design, and if you know your stuff just by aesthetics alone tell with reasonable confidence who made it
oh yeah, 100%
Okawara does one pose and it never looks very good
He has a good design range, but his art is kinda shit and all looks the same
I should rephrase that for Okawara
Okawara, Katoki and even Obari and Go Nagai can pretty much do one aesthetic and pose only
I'd even go as far as saying that all of the old guard of prolific mech designers are pretty much a one trick pony
yeah, Katoki is mostly just a pose
Eh
Depends on your definition of a gimmick, but broadly yeah
yeah, but there's also been a confirmation that there will be a seperate OVA thing alongside it
yeah, Urdr Hunt is gonna have an animated thing alongside it
right, my bad
And the new IBO thing, and Doan's Island, and Hathaway 2
Both IBO and ReRise were good shows that also sold hella models
If anything that's evidence against your point
I have a hardcore Nagano stan on one of my places
yes
They will hate you for speaking the truth
I need to send that to some people
lmfao
Been meaning to watch that show next week for the better part of three months now
yeah GGG is just a good design, full stop
huh, now that you mention it that makes perfect sense
https://twitter.com/thebangdoll2989/status/1096757818370207745
hold on, I have a chart for that somewhere, juxtapositioning the og vs redesign
yeppp
FSS Nagano designs were so good, why'd he have to butcher them like this
It all looks the same, just different amount of scytheblades on it
I kinda hate his new aesthetic
yeah Nagano is just off in the corner doing his own thing
yeah, Yanase is also good
Adding to that:
Gyoubu: Round or hexagonal, little in between
Washio: General lean, menacing aesthetic
Ebikawa: Halfway point between blocky and sharp angles
those are entirely too many colors
christ
huh, interesting
derp
Goohn
wait not Zuoot
Although I do have a soft spot for the ZuOOT, silly as it is
Might be, yeah
Ginn is probably my favorite !Zaku
I'll also say that most non-aquatic grunts are pretty good
There is some dumb bullshit in there, no question, but a lot of them look very nice
Yeah, I will go to bat for (most) Seed designs
Just not a good artist, and unfortunately that is the crutch of some adaptations of his designs, trying to stick too closely to his art
Okawara is a great designer, no doubt
He, Washio and Ebikawa are probably my favorite mechanical designers
That's actually a good point. Writing mecha/mecha-adjacent fight scenes without images is hard
I mainly watch mecha stuff, originals far outweigh adaptations there, but as pretty much an outsider looking in, in other genres it's maybe one in fifty that a show is an original
Depends a lot on the genre tbh
Was fun
Have a good night!
and wow, that one is gooooood
yup
I recently saw a - very good, no shade against the man - aircraft modeller almost lose his shit over the fact that a... I think it was a Spitfire had polycaps for the wheel housings, that was something he's never seen before in any other military model
If you look at armor or airplane models, some things that are currently hailed as the peak of innovation ar ethings that Bandai did 20 years ago
In the Japanese market no, but globally, it might be the exact kick in the ass that western companies that very much would have the size to do similar things need
Exactly
Something like an HG Leo from pretty much any other company would probably sell upwards of 30 bucks MSRP
Mainly talking about figures and model kits, which hoooo boy that's a day and night difference
Can't speak to that, never looked at those
You say that, but any other manufacturer would charge easily double of what Bandai does for the same product <:YuaLUL:840613406955798578>
If it doesn't hurt, then what's the point <:Kanadeblood:955956453506682900>
Not impossible by any stretch, but it requires a a set of descriptive skills to get across the size and impact of things that not everyone has
All of it is extremely well written, but the show will hurt you
Depending on your tolerance/affinity for pain and suffering, it might not be for you
Although fair warning: 86 is heavy stuff
One of the best shows I have ever watched, full stop
If you want a proper great show, 86
I'm not sure I'd call it good in the strictest sense, but it's quite entertaining to watch
it was a lot, but fun
Witht the giant squid
Is Skelter Heaven the weird horny mecha one that everyone riffs on?
Most of my reaction to S2 was an overwhelming annoyance that they clearly had some ideas for plotlines that very much would warrant developing further in a more genuine way, but every time they went anywhere resembling a proper plot arc, they just immediately went "shit this wasn't supposed to have actual character development, quick uuuuhhhh. panty joke"
I did find the dullahan bit quite funny, but that's about it as far as plot points I remember from it
Yeah I remember watching it and going "wait, why does everyone say this is hilarious, there's like two jokes an episode that land at best"
That movie was, up until I listened to a live reading of My Immortal, the longest hour I ever willingly subjected myself to
If we count movies in a series individually, it's the final Code Geass Akito the Exiled movie
If we only count full shows it's Victory Gundam
Oh yeah, IBO is by far the most divisive Gundam show
Sure, I'd have done a few things in it differently, but on the whole, it is such a good tale of causing your own downfall
I loved what they did for S2, exceptional use of setup and delivery for just how dangerous blind ambition can be
IBO is my favorite Gundam bar none, but mileage definitely varies wildly
Honestly not even. Wing for example is way edgier than IBO, it's just that more people die in the latter
Most people saying that are stuck up muh olden days elitists who haven't even watched the show, but refuse to accept that something new is popular
Ah yes, the most parroted take on hhe show
Cautiously hyped
Opening for the new IBO thing
<:02eyes:508876732355444738>
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rZe7zXgeU
My exposure to RWBY has been minimal to put it kindly, but that second batch of characters looks painfully generic
So I take it they're now pay only?
fuck Crunchyroll
They somehow managed to give a 480p 4:3 anime four loading times of half a minute to a minute each last time I tried to use their web player
I will not give that company a cent
That cat and mouse game before that was the show at its most brilliant, and it just never reached that high again once it stopped doing it
Honeslty for me the point at which Death Note took the firs thit was when ||Light and L teamed up||
Honestly Death Note kinda fell apart as well after the halfway point
I mean yes, but at the same time, just from the cliffnotes alone it is such a trainwreck
Was casually announced some months back at the end of a website news post
It is, except the game is also getting an OVA
General rule of thumb, the vocal types on either end of the spectrum of opinions on it are best avoided
Those are some interesting physics alright
I currently have my brain trying to convince me both to watch and not watch the RWBY anime
I know where I'll be getting my anime from even less now than I used to <:LUL:517652410244661268>
Fuck Crunchyroll even more now
Oh well
I suppose that explains why they killed their embed on sites hosting their player
I haven't watched any of the big shonen titles, and at this point I honestly don't think I ever will
In no small part related to the fact that anime is a lot more mass appeal than in the west (not nearly as much as one might think, but the difference is still significant), so the general viewing base is percentage-wise a lot fewer hardcore fans with strong opinions than it is casual fans who watch without being that strongly invested
Japanese rankings are usually a lot different than western rankings, just in general
oh right, got the names fumbled. My b
I won't say "could never beat", because outside of orders of magnitude of power difference, that is not how combat encounters work; if the circumstances are lucky enough for you, or you set yourself up well enough, you can win a fight with much inferior equipment (see for example the US armored vehicle that managed to take out a, depending on the source anything from Pz 4 to a Tiger in WWII because it managed to ambush it)
Yeah, but the GN-X is only that dangerous because it can be deployed in much larger quantities. In a duel, the advantage is still quite strongly in favor of the CB suits
Not only missing an arm, but also in general poor maintenance
Once they lost that advantage, the field became much more level
They were much more advanced than that, but that was all due to the GN Drives
Shiho is really funny to me in that regard. Not a single line, only ever shows up as Yzak's lieutenant, but somehow still ended up as a fan favorite
yes, it is
~~well minus the expansion pass, but shhh that's a thing slapped onto it that was clearly never intended in the base game design~~
Crossrays is fun, yeah
I don't like the "Bandai is lazy" rhethoric, but this is one sidestory where the shoe fits
yeah
Opinions on the story aside, this is just unpleasant to look at
VS Astrays designs are an affront
Dreadnought, Providence, Providence Nix, Legend and one buffer for the other dumb bullshit Astray has statistically pulled at this point
I look forward to seeing Freedom 3, Justice 3 and Destiny 2 fighting Providence... what is it with extended lore, 6 at this point?
Only because no time for recordings
That much has been confirmed, that he wasn't killed because TM Revolution was too expensive
Only that he wouldn't have died as early as he did
~~and would have gotten better if TMR wasn't on a world tour during Destiny's recording~~
~~Heine deserved better~~
Destiny Heine is a special case because it's a VA thing
HGCE Destiny is such a nice kit
The real issue with Gundam lore is that for about 30% of it in each timeline, the setting makes more sense without it <:KEKW:892920745590685767>
I wasn't gonna say anything, but yeah, it kinda is
Actually they make two, QanT has both drives original
yeah, the wrecked ship that is a totally relevant plotpoint in S2 for all of two episodes
Only meaningful difference is that it enables the true GN Drives to operate consistently, where Tau drives have slower particle production than consumption, meaning they need reacharge times
Plot device thing
And then that one gets overplayed about twice as long as it needs to be
There's like one character death in it that has any semblance of weight and isn't completely overshadowed by how ridiculous it is, either in its own right or by surrounding circumstances
But most of it just doesn't
The few times it has its act together, it is a sight to behold
no, Victory is just not a very good show, and most of it is boring to watch
~~all three of them~~
00 can also combine its GN swords, but that only counts-ish
yeah, it does
Physical backing, beam edge with two generators
I meant the Anti-Ship sword kind
ah no, not that kind
It actually does make sense there to have a physical core
Although one interesting thing that CE tech does is having beam generators on the top and bottom of the blade on the big swords
also that, yeah
I assume more focused beam
And the game is apparently quite good according to people who played it
Movie is not that bad, I'd put it above a solid chunk of Tomino's work
I do have a soft spot for GS
Some day I'll do a shitpost kitbash of that and a God and call it the G/Saviour
And yeah, Saviour is a neat design
take care!
Went from being the most hateable of the Zaft boys ~~and also oops accidental warcrimes~~ to being one of the best leaders in all of Gundam
Yzak had such a glowup as a character
I still prefer Ash like Snow
It took me quite a few times listening to Daybreak's Bell to like it
yeah but you don't work through depression by killing characters
Tomino is an amazing worldbuilder, but mediocre director and bad writer
Turn A was when he peaked, everything before and after is just different brands of honestlky not that good
yeeeaaa
Yes, but as I understand, the work leading up to that was one of the things that allowed him to overcome it
Turn A
That is far too kind a fate for someone who was warcrime inc for pretty much the entire last quarter of the show
But he is just wrong about it
It was
||She doesn't have any memory of what happened, she just exists and goes unpunished for the massive amounts of crimes against humanity that she was part of||
||Katejina genuinely does not deserve to live after the show, not even as a blind amnesiac||
||it very decidedly isn't||
You watch it, and feel absolutely nothing
You can definitely feel the depression; not in that it is sad, but that it just feels empty above all else
Was a combination of all of the above, and just had me rolling with laughter
When I saw one of the final deaths in the show for the first time, it caught me so offguard that I had to pause the show for a solid two minutes
Meanwhile most other deaths are either unintentionally hilarious, leave you going "oh finally, fuck that guy", were entirely avoidable by the character who died and most of the reaction is "oh you dumbfuck", or just have you go "what the fuck did I just watch"
My b
But either way, was some vague memory of some shpow usig that as set dressing with no bearing onits plot or themes, and got the two mixed up
Haven't seen Diebuster yet
Wait, right, I'm an idiot. I was conflating Gunbuster with... I don't even kow what other show, but that made me forget that it actually does things with that
Only one I can think of that vaguely fits the bill is Gunbuster, but neither do I think that's the one you're looking for, nor do I think anyone remembers it for the space physics
But yeah, it'S pretty well directed, action is fun
fair
Eva crossover is fairly fun
Not bad, and certainly well made, but don't expect too much depth from it (at least as far as I've watched it, which is, admittedly, not that much of it)
It'S very much a kids show
Really cool indie mecha thing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSVAYNZTIio
<:sachi_idunno:900793574638116874>
...nevermind, it's pronounced Lubris apparently
So p much the same as Efreet
I assume it's to be pronounced Ifrith
||Pale Rider, the thing literally front and center on the box art? Appears a grand total of four times, two of them being the same scene in two different campaigns, one being a random scene of it blowing something up and the last being the final bossfight and its destruction.
Oh and there's also the teensie tiny issue of extremely uncomfortable levels of Federation blackwashing/Zeon whitewashing. The Feddie campaign spends more time fighting other Feddies because clearly one traitor means you need to raze the whole base into the ground with everyone in it and you at one point execute an ace pilot in a false flag operation for the crime of not liking General Revil. Oh and the moment that gets framed as their big heroic decision is *checks notes* them deserting from the Federation to team up with a Zeon team. Meanwhile the Zeon campaign goes to great lengths to show how cool these ace pilots are for heroically stepping in to save the poor hero squad just wanting to fight for their homeland and committing way less crimes than the Federation||
Story is genuine garbage
As much as I want to like it
On that note. I just finished watching a playthrough of Missing Link
Outlaw Star I've heard good things about
It's such a disappointment after they spent all of the previews building up the cool pirate space adventure post-timeskip
Maybe a side character dies in the process
Every problem they have, they solve by BIGGER ROBOT
The spectacle creep just completely flattens whatever stakes there were before
I borderline hated the space part of TTGL
O god thank fuck I'm not alone in this
~~although most of them only because they didn't actually succeed in murder~~
I can think of a few worse from what I gather of Haruhi
The shockwave would rip you to bits
yeah that scene was complete bullshit
Yeah, at the end of the day, 08th is definitely one of the best entries
This is very explicit framing of the OYW Federation doing all the bad stuff, while Zeon soldiers are just good people trying to live
This is not Titans
Good example
^
very
There is a fuckton of Federation blackwashing in sidestories to appease Zeon fanboys
That does not stop Gundam writers from trying unfortunately
That's fair
||the problem I have with that is that Zeon does A Lot Of Warcrimes™️, and portraying the Federation as equal leaves a very bad taste in my mouth||
||goes waaayy too hard on the "who am I to judge which side are the bad guys"||
||and the second to last episode felt extremely hamfisted to me, I did not like that||
Reasonably well, yeah, but the vibe isn't as good anymore
Original director died in a traffic accident :(
Ep 6
Drops off a bit with the director change unfortunately, but oh well
It's a good starting point
08th is good
Additional context for that scene: Irl history, in WWII there have been occurrences where tank destroyers without machineguns were being overrun by infantry. The crew fired the main gun as a desperate last measure, and the shockwave, without the projectile ever making contact with anyone, was enough to kill the entire squad. Those guns were significantly smaller than the Zaku machinegun. Shiro should be a splatter on the wall
Idk, it made sense to me all the way throughout
Nah, R2 is good
That show holds up
Yeah I'll go to bat for the writing of Geass
Which is to say fun, dumb action with just enough writing in it that it holds up
It's kinda TTGL that doesn't escalate beyond what it can carry
Can't blame you lol
But it gets a lot more bearable after that
yeah, the first two were baaaaad
Still not sure if I'd call it _good_ necessarily, but it was a blast to watch
Was pretty fun, that one
Not a bad thing by default, two of my all time favorite shows also have that, and it's great
I've definitely watched some shows as they came out, but that was primarily because I'd have watched them anyway at some point
Ngl I feel so immensely blessed that I don't keep up with seasonal
~~speaking of Neue Ziel, that is almost a direct match to one of Shirabe's attack poses~~
Actually yeah, good point too
I feel like the shape is more Dendrobium than Apsalus III, especially with the core unit in the middle
p much, yeah
Sakuradite <:Ver:704169051391524875>
Oh yeah, the R2 ace units are firmly super robots
That's fair, I just really like suits with big, flashy backpacks
Goes for 80 normally
I snatched the RD of one on yahoo auctions for 30 bucks a while back, probably the best deal I've ever gotten on a plastic robot
Big jackal looking one
No, that's Lelouch's twoseater in 1
And all the other suits tend to be a lot sleeker, more elegant in 2
Albion and SEITEN have a really good aesthetic
But the rest, I think I prefer R2
Gawain is definitely the best design in Code Geass, that's not even a debate
Hmmm, gotta think abotu that one
S2 was way better
Honestly, I kinda hated 00 S1
||I feel like the trauma is enough comeuppance||
At most one or two contrived occurrences, but nothing that outright breaks anything
Tbh most ransomware isn't really attacks as much as shoddy infrastructure/poor security training
A techblog I read likes to compare it to calling it a mold attack when you don't fix a hole in your roof and let water come in; fitting comparison in my opinion
I honestly quite dislike the narrative of evil hackers doing dastardly crime that has become the default for reports of these incidents, it's far too easy a target for companies to shift blame on instead of taking not even that complicated steps for actually improving security
yeah, no, accurate
For me it decidedly isn't
Well, that and overall cheaper and fastwr
Reasons why I use fedex instead of japan post
Shipping block is plague, not air space restrictions
Especially since just like a month ago I ordered something from Japan via airmail, and I live two countries over
Yeah that one seems very dubious
The fact that it doesn't with DxD, and even elevates it in places, is testament to just how good the writing in thsi show is
If anything I find that usually it takes away from the integrity of a show
I don't give a fuck about the fanservice
I'm broadly ace
See here's the thing
<@219228299115757588> re:DxD in <#336297808221044736>; It's a really good show. I wanna say that you could take away all the fanservice and be left with something just as good, but that would not actually be true, since some of it is actually important to the characters. (Example, minor spoilers: ||Protag uses his aggressive over the top horniness as a coping mechanism for parental abandonment||) Show also does not pull any punches, gets quite dark at times
The last order I picked up at the import office and my most recent model kit haul were similar in size, pickup was 90 bucks where Fedex was around 70
Fedex is about half, but since it handles imports on their end, there's no storage fees while waiting for the invoice to arrive by mail and a lot of the time the actual import fee is lower as well
Airmail is usually around a qarter to a third of item price for shipping, before import and storage fees
Wording is a bit fucked here and there, but it is still really good
I have read the first and part of the second, they're really good
The episodes that are just some clones fighting a war way beyond anyone's comprehension are outstanding
Clone Wars is at its strongest when it has no Jedi in it
It's a complete cesspool whichever side you take on the show
Also stay the fuck away from IBO twitter
Although a lot of people completely hating it are also just OG elitists who don't like the idea of something being new, different and popular
I think it's great, but a lot of people disagree with some of its writing decisions
S2 is very divisive
Also fair, yeah
Fair warning, IBO tends to be fairly love it or hate it
Thunderbolt is pretty fun
Slow burn, arcs are only loosely connected, but it works really well with what the show is as far as I'm concerned
Probably my favorite on the whole after IBO
I'd also highly recommend Gundam X
I watched Wing in two days; not because it was good, but because after the first ten episodes I knew for a fact that I'd only have the nerve to pick it back up exactly once
I maybe should have, because the dub is apparently not very good and the campiness/general jank of it makes the plot points more bearable as by some people
I don't know, didn't watch the dub
G meanwhile I maintain is a genuinely really good show
That show is stylish as fuck, but the writing is so bad
I wouldn't recommand Wing
Being currently in the process of watching all of UC, can confirm that that is a bad idea
On the whole genuinely not the worst idea, but that misses out on what I consider to be by far two of the best arcs Gundam has ever done
I won't tell you what to do, but I don't consider strictly sticking to UC a good idea. It's easy to box yourself in with that, to get a kind of "I'll just finish these up first" mindset and miss out on a lot of fun stuff, because UC is deceptively long and a solid chunk of it is of dubious quality
You'll still miss a handful of things doing that, but most of them can be extrapolated without much trouble if you know the general ropes of mecha
The majority of the original space arc is very skippable, not least due to the significant number of flashbacks to every relevant part of it
The most painless way of watching Seed is probably to watch the first five episodes, skip to 10, 13, 15 and then watch from there
yeah
She is a very frustrating character in a way that is narratively great, but makes you want to punch your screen in every other time she says something
She super is, but that makes the arcs focusing on her very difficult to watch at times
Unfortunately, they did a bit too good a job in making said character hateable
I maintain that Seed's love triangle is actually really well written, because it is not something that happened naturally, but is rather specifically engineered by the absolute asshole at the center of it to try and manipulate the other two
||at the point that Orga was even by the start of S2, I'm not sure if he could have ended any other way; he's so drunk on the success of S1 that I don't think he'd ever be satisfied with what he does have||
Most of the people disliking it don't even bother to explain why, they just kinda make broad claims and then go "well if you don't understand I can't help you"
This is honestly one of the best talks about IBO I've ever had
nah, you're good
||Even with the organization smashed and a lot of members dead, the survivors were successful in carving out their own spots, and could only do so because of their own actions||
It would almost completely invalidate the whole motivation of Tekkadan finding their own place in the world, since they'd again be at the mercy of whoever agreed to leave them alone in the negotiations
I disagree tbh; even by the end of S1, that would have felt like a hollow victory to me
I wouldn't say that IBO is about war itself as much as it is about ambitions driving wars
I'd go as far as saying that ||Tekkadan winning|| would have been the less interesting option
I'll fully agree that Hush was underutilized as fuck, but that part was good
||Nah, Hush's death was the best thing about his arc, even if it was inherently cynical; he gets his recognition by Mika as an equal who can hold his side on his own, even if it's just as a last favor||
They did spend a bit too much time building the armor and a bit too little actually using it for anything, that s fair
||I actually really like that plot point; gambits like that have happened and worked out irl, and it's such a good exploration of a character whose worldview is so out of touch with reality that he has no concept of questioning the base assumption on which the plan hinges||
IBO I think is the only one that I've ever rewatched more than select highlights of in my own time
take care End!
||Kudelia not doing that in S2 feels like the right choice to me because she understands the implications of those actions and knows when to stay her hand||
||That kinda relates to the point I'm making I feel; S1 they had the liberty of pulling stunts like that because they didn't have any standing to lose, while in S2 especially Orga still tries to do that, but is so entangled in bigger business that he can't do it thoroughly enough to succeed||
I do think that it is, S1 was all about how daring ambition can get you through tough opposition; S2 is a cautionary tale of letting that rise to your head, and losing sight of your goals and position over it
All the trajectories were already in place
Tbh S2 just feels like a natural extension of S1 to me
But I'd say ep 10ish onwards is straight fire all the way to the end
It takes a bit to get going, admittedly
Also ReRise is amazing
Battlogue and GM's Counterattack were pretty good, but the rest yea
Genuinely one of the best
oh Fighters is great
It'S not quite as bad as with Eva where if someone has a screenshot of Rei or Kaworu as their pfp they're an immediate red flag, but it does get there sometimes
Me neither, but it kinda spills over sometimes
Definitely the right call for Gundam
yeah, same
Seed Remaster gets rid of the helmet in the wreckage
yeah that one was duuuumb
I just know that the cheating drama rumor is nonsense, and that's pretty much it
I did not have a good time with that show at all, nor do I have nearly enough familiarity with the production to make any claims about who is at fault for what
For the record, I do not defend a lot of things in Destiny
I don't love the way that fight turned out, but at the same time it gave us the second battle of Orb and can be fixed by just tweaking the screenwriting a bit, so I don't mind it too much
right
oh, Destiny
wait hol up what?
Kira was supposed to die, until Bandai went "hey we want a sequel, keep that guy around"
That was exec meddling actually
Reminds me of how telfon was originally developed for spacecraft
It arguably is, but I really love that it was pretty much a complete accident just based on a secondary property of NL
But I don't buy into the whole bad man history approach of "this one writer is to blame for every plot decision I don't like"
To be fair I don't know either what she did in detail <:LUL:517652410244661268>
I find them to be used as almost a krutch by a lot of shows rather than something actually meaningful
The absence of beams is probably one of my favorite things about the premise
LAst three, but yeah
Before it gets the big chest armor, but it's 100% in the show
yeah, it's the final battle form of S1
It's the ground form with the big shoulders they scavenged from Carta's mooks
6th is from the end of S1
ah
There's 1-6, three of which have two armor variations to them, Lupus and Lupus Rex
Nah, Barbie 9th isn't real
Do you mean Barbatos specifically or just generic Gundam frames
That's one of the things that made Gekkou a great sidestory, it didn't try to involve itself in areas it had no business being in
I will be greatly annoyed if they pull some bs of "oh this is what Tekkadan did in between seasons"
At least as we know so far
It's a completely different set of characters tho, so more analogous to OYW sidestories than CCA I'd say
||For better or worse, all the notable members of Tekkadan died defending what they held dearest; that's a noble enough thing that at least I personally find it cathartic enough in its own way||
I'd rather have this than Orga's Counterattack, which I fear would have been the alternative
Can't yet tell you, I'm only three episodes in
oboy
In unrelated affairs, I picked up Magia Record the other day; not yet sure what to think of it. It certainly doesn't hit the same nerve as Madoka, which I'm not yet sure if that will be a blessing or a curse, but it does do a couple of interesting things. Curious to see how this one will go
bruh
~~which is something I wish more suits did instead of just exploding into a purple cloud, but animating debris is expensive~~
it got caught in a big beam and torn to bits, but yeah, it left some wreckage
but for a show where one watch is 20 hours if you're managing your time efficiently
like, I can get that argument for music, movies and even short shows like that
n o
uh
But like, saying that you need four watches to understand its genius is
Rewatching a show you like is fair game
yeah, that's fair
~~to be fair, Hibiki was god at one point~~
At the point where you're watching 200 episodes of the same thing before finding it good, what you're developing is not a refined taste, it's a stockholm syndrome
like my guy
no, because something something can't appreciate the true brilliance before that
Wait no, that was Zeta, not 79
I once had a guy argue to me that the only way to truly appreciate Gundam is to watch it in full at least four times
Lord of the Flies is one thing, but this is idiocy on a whole other level
Also just the dumbest plot point
I haven't seen ZZ yet, but people tell me it's baaaaaad
oh right, moon moon
I swear to fUCKING GOD
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3wcmDtAFEs
It's fucking Millaarc
I go to look up a VA from one of the side characters
So I was watching D4DJ, silly little music show
(new figure releases; spoilers for the show for those who haven't seen it)
<https://twitter.com/WithTheWill/status/1516941692116430848> So, anyone here like Digimon Tamers?
the only thing that's hard to follow is what the fuck Magius is doing, because the show can't make up its mind if they're doing good or not
oh yeah, the plot isn't hard to follow as much as just kinda not being there at all really
Biggest mystery box in this show isn't any of the rumors, what happened to Iroha's sister or what's the deal with the bad guys, it's figuring out what the plot is supposed to be
Friend of mine who really likes it tells me that you basically have to have played the entirety of the gacha to understand what's going on
o boy
So S1 of Magia Record was Not Good™️
It's kinda like the piranha plant in Smash with how out of left field it is
That was cut from releases for reasons ranging from being too jank to the director having beef with episode staff
It's a movie about the plot of a singular filler episode from the first Gundam
PFFFFFFFFFFT
I knew I recognized that artstyle
oh you're watching Shinkalion
amazing how far a little bit of narrative focus goes
Two episodes in and Magia Record S2 is just kinda good in a way that S1 never was
Easily one of my favorite shows in general
86 is great in both forms
Looks pretty interesting
I do wanna give it a shot some day
Battle against the Sixth Angel
yeah, that's from Eva 1.0
I have seen exactly ten seconds of his videos and he sounds like an utter pain in the ass
oh I both love and hate that
Which show?
O god my brain did a subconscious pun there
oh yeah, Shinkalion is a ride. I kinda love it
That sounds wack
I have not gotten to that part yet
Plus it does go to a fair length to show that they absolutely do scavenge off of destroyed units
I mean, you can melt down knocked out machines and make new ones out of that
The only person I've ever heard talk about if it'S actually good is a hardcore Nagano stan to the point where I do not trust anything he says about anything he's ever worked on, so I don't have a clue about if it's even remotely good
Gothicmade is what the manga (novel?) eventually turned into
Not whatever else there is
The OVA
I've been meaning to check out FSS for a while
I was wondering if that existed
lmao
Wasn'T that also the one that was Eva-themed for a while and is now Hello Kitty themed
I've heard very good things about both
Ever since I've had a guy argue to me in honest that I can't possibly watch Macross Frontier before the original, because I'll miss such crucial plot elements as a background whale aquarium that's apparently a callback to a filler episode plot in the original, I cannot take any comments on "required" watch orders seriously anymore
I love the Beginning 30
I'm aware of some two or three mangas/photonovels/whatever they are
animated, that is
I thought it was only the one 40 minute thing
huh
wait, there was more than one thing for Beginning G?
Although I'm gonna disagree that noone remembers Fighters
yea
Oh that makes this old forum post even funnier
yeah the wheelchair Guntank was a choice to be sure
Which is also why I really hated what little I watched of Gundam-san, everything in it was just that brand of hollywood cynicism/fourth wall breaks that kinda screams at your face that you're an idiot for taking any of the story remotely seriously
I love good-natured jokes like that
okay that's actually really funny
As long as it's not Gundam-san's brand of referential humor, I think I'll enjoy it
And yeah, heard decent things about that one
The three kingdoms one was fun enough
I still need to give SD a proper shot
that's fair
Which is also my biggest cirticism of Try, because it utterly fails to do that
I don't really consider that a weak point tbh, the show does a really good job at showing and exploring what makes the hobby fun
Haven't watched Real yet, so can't comment on that
Try is a bad shounen tournament arc, the OVAs exist for the most part; GM's Counterattack is good, but that's about it. The two episodes of Divers I've seen didn't exactly impress me and while Breaker was fun, it's also kind of a nothingburger
ReRise is amazing, but that's about it
Tbh you're not missing much
up until Divers Battlogue, the publishing rights prevented them from putting the actual designs in, so we only ever got stuff like the Galbaldy Rebake or that one glowing Barbie mace in Island Wars
it was the same thing for IBO, yeah
and yeah, Stargazer itself does some really cool stuff
I have, great little show
which for the record, Wings of Light are dope as fuck, but they don't scratch that particular itch
I mean yeah, the Wings of Light exist, but they're not the fullon beam bubble that the 30 has
I believe it was specifically about 00 S2 designs, and the Amazing Exia Repair
The I-Field beam wings of the 30 are such a cool idea that I wish more shows used
https://64.media.tumblr.com/e4be06cba1d22294095c2a4ddb14391d/tumblr_nq0hh3VZzB1rjxyrgo10_500.gif
But I maintain that it's a pretty fun little show
yeah, I only ever watched the supercut of it
ooooh now it makes sense
Actually got one in my latest haul, does some really strange and interesting things
Actually, looking at it, the Hyper Captain is pretty much just a GP01 with some extra fluff. It's probably not too too hard to do a HG/SD bash for that
I do wanna try making a regular-proportions Captain Gundam at some point; I feel like that would be a fun project
I have not consumed any notable amount of content that featured Bright
Or Origin, Zeta, ZZ for that matter
Have not seen CCA either
Don't think I'd have any strong opinions on it even if I did
Didn't watch enough of 79 to remember his performance
I've found the thing that was missing
But yeah like, I've been doing a silly gear/Build Fighters thing on the side for a while, and there was always something missing for Serena's
I can see it
It's a subflight unit thing
although a lot more petite than the GN-X
kinda, yeah
So I was building some Gunpla earlier and it occurs to me that the Farsia from Age has pretty much half of Serena's design elemtns in it
But MAN that hit me out of left field
yeah reminders that Valvrave is a thing are usually not great
That got me GOOD
https://vxtwitter.com/mechaimages/status/1530241854469550083
Good bonkers or "someone probably should have proofread this before publishing" bonkers
On a more serious note; D4DJ is an extremely fun music show
I am resisting the urge to make some overly-elaborate joke about how you should watch Symphogear so hard right now
And having your morals be so unhinged that you don't care about the fact that you are being evil doesn't make you not evil
Protagonist does not equal hero
If you view lives as playstones for your personal gain, you are not "true neutral", you are the bad guy and deserve a sword through your chest
that is a horrible definition
Neither is generic jrpg final boss #5131551
yeah does not excuse it
That is just a sociopath
That is being egotistical and, in the case of murder, actively evil
That is decidedly not what neutral is
||Isn't that just Bokurano||
nevermind
wait no, I'm thinking Redo of Healer
When it was first announced, the overwhelming reaction I saw was along the general line of "oh no, this thing"
As people told me yeah, kinda that
And, to be completely blunt, seeing you defend that guy just makes it seem like you have been successfully gaslit by a fictional character lol
Which, if those are even remotely accurate, sounds about right
Pretty much all I know about Strike Witches is that it became a meme on the server of a streamer I'm watching about how one of his mods wanted to get him a copy of it; right up until they actually watched it, at which point (secondhand knowledge, missed the stream and no archive) they were across the board incredibly grossed out by the combination of 70% pantyshots by volume and the insistence with which the show points out that all of its characters are strongly underage


The story is just actual garbage
Oh no, the designs are good
For every plothole it attempts to fix, it rips open three new ones
Yeah Astray is best left ignored wholesale
But Astray is just fundamentally dumb on so many counts that a rewrite that isn't awful would be barely recognizable
Which is not a phrase I use lightly, even the most dubious of entries in Gundam usually have _some_ salvageable parts to them
If nothing else because Gaia Gear Alpha and Zorin Soul look sick
I'D like a Gaia Gear adaptation, yeah
lmao
It looks so plain and generic with the standard face, doesn't fit the feral, angular look of the suit at all
I really hope that they won't do the G Gen design as the repairs
I should get back to this show
Shinkalion designs have no right to be as cool as they are
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2e8AiETPvE
Never change, Shinkalion
I suppose it also ties into the fact that the robots in the show and the show as a whole don't necessarily need to occupy the same point on the scale
I've called Gunbuster the most powerful real robot before, and I am not sure if I was joking or not with that description
For me, it's more about general vibe than any specific element to pinpoint it on
Fair.
...I appear to be in a spot of transforming real robots currently, the two mecha shows that right now sound the most appealing for me to watch are Shinkalion and Macross Frontier
would definitely make sense
yeah. The rest is nice, but I'm in it for that plotline
That show goes places
Tamers also had a big chunk of Eva staff on it
That 100% scans
On a side note, reading that with the MGRR soundtrack on loop gave it a very interesting vibe
Hoping that they won't draw out the bit with Asumi never meeting Mai for too too long, I wanna see the glorious disaster that that interaction is gonna be
Although I can't remember any of their names outside of those where I already know a different character with the same name <:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
Whole cast is p good
She's fun, yeah
That panel actually made me burst out with laughter
Okay, y'all got me, catching up on this
Man's living back in the times when your profession was just "scientist" without any specializations
o BOY
(well, specifically I'm looking for figures in that style for the og Madoka girls, I just imagine that MQ is the best shot I have at those existing, don't really care about the game OC girls)
Also, unrelated; does anyone know if Magia Quartet got those SD gashapon figures like XDU did? They aren't on the bushiroad store, but at the same time there's so little there in general that I don't buy that that's all there is for merch of the game
BD is already out, was sold at jp theaters with subs, like was the case for Hathaway
The only thing I remember is it obsessively worshipping status quo and stonewalling/rolling back any and all slivers of character development that did try to happen
I found it mid at best on my initial watch when I barely had discerning taste, and I don't think I want to go back to see how it holds up
The initial 1.01 home release of the first Eva movie made the same mistake
It's just silly and, quite frankly, a bad port because of it
yeah
ooh, now I getcha
I'm not sure I can quite follow
Had to turn up my screen way beyond normal for the night scenes, only to get flashbanged by the day scenes
yeah Hathaway's brightness balance was atrocious
Anime journalism has bad takes and articles about nothing. In more news, water is wet.
In a tacked-on sidestory written after the fact
Heero, Zechs and Quatre just do whatever the fuck the Zero system says is the future and Wufei pretends that Altron has consciousness even without a Zero system
Remember, this is the show where the driving motivation of more than half of the core cast is "my Gundam told me to do it, so I did"
Wing doesn't have that level of thought put into much more relevant elements of it, I genuinely can't see the writers doing Heero's personality for anything other than what 90s kids think was cool
I honestly seriously doubt that was the intention
My list of shows I watched is well above 90% mecha, but maaaan, 80s and earlier shows are rough to get into
Now ain't that a mood
She should have been the protag, because every emotionally relevant arc focuses on her to begin with
Although I raise you Yachio
Yup
The pacing is atrocious
I wouldn't say mixed bag as much as case study in why gacha adaptations need to set priorities in what to adapt
That's 24 that I can remember, and probably a handful more that I don't
MR's cast, off the top of my head:
||
Original five
New main group of five
The three other girls that protag girl hung around with for more than half of the first season that were never relevant
Some three or four enemy leaders
The three (except actually four) founders of the enemy organization
One random enemy mook
Two other supportclasses that are suddenly relevant in the last season
||
Magia Record tries to make everything relate to its main mystery box ~~and shoves it into more mystery boxes, but that's a separate issue~~, and just kinda falls on its face for it
XDU has the occasional dubiously written event, but those are all fairly self-contained; Mirrorverse intro's whack pacing has no bearing on how miracle of mechanical work plays out
I don't think that's the case; Magia Record's primary problem is that it has close to two dozen important characters it splits the runtime between, and is kind of a mess because of it. XDU doesn't have the million OC characters, a hypothetical adaptation can't be the same kind of bad as Magia Record
~~as well as the ancient ass Koto gashapon Sizzler, that is somehow almost perfectly in scale with the Revo Gunbuster~~
Found the Revos for both for a decent price
Figure, not the show
*stares at Neo Getter and Gunbuster on their way to me*
I feel this image in my soul
Bruuuuuuuuhhhhhh lmfao
Pharact looking mighty good
Oh this is gonna be the newest entry in the long tradition of Look At All These Pretty People Gundam
what the fuck, showwriters
<:concern:432428021085896705>
loooooool
Yeah
mh, right
But I do know that one of the designers there worked on Armored Core
I might have mixed them up with one of the other people on that list, then
This guy knows what he's doing
Did one of the good fights of Try, did the Build Strike vs Kämpfer in the opening, did Alus core, did some IBO fghts
yup
Director and writer, with the exception of the director having written the script for Valvrave, have also both been involved in a bunch of bangers, so I am quite optimistic about this
I also went over the rest of the staff with a friend; everyone in the visuals department has worked on absolutely beautiful and well-choreographed shows, so the fights are gonna slap
And JNTHED became immediately apparent once Pharact was revealed, that thing is Armored Core as fuck
yeah, Gyoubo I very much expected from the other thing in the prologue, Ebikwaw and Yanase were safe bets
I don't think I ever made a guess to who designed Aerial
I've been told that Macross is very disconnected in between entires, to the point where watchorder is arbitrary
Looking at these expression sketches I feel like I'm gonna be slightly disappointed if she isn't voiced by Aoi Yuuki
very
~~I mean technically those are still the same~~
looks a bit like the Black Sarena, yeah
And obv Katoki and Okawara still doing their thing as ever, although mostly for commemorative stuff and UC projects
Kinda most of what you see is Gyoubu, Ebikawa, Washio and Yanase these days
You kinda get an eye for the big five or six after a while, they have fairly distinctive styles
That one's on me
So yeah, A LOT older than Star Wars
According to tvtropes, beam sword-type weapons are featured in an Asimov novel from 1944
I don't buy that it took 70 years for someone to think "hey, what if that, but sword"
Especially since the idea of death rays, and subsequently laser/beam weapons goes back to the 1910s, if not earlier
I don't know any off the top of my head, but it's such a basic concept that I find it hard to believe it took almost until the 80s for someone to do it
I feel fairly confident in saying that beam blades in anime are probably older than Gundam
Yeah the only difference is that ||they retconned Shirley's death by... cutting out all arcs where she was relevant, and then edited her into a few shots after the fact||
That hotswapping is the one design feature of the Victory series
More Victory units show up less than halfway in
That thing is built like a tank
There's a time that the DX gets hammered by multiple warships worth of missile artillery, damage went as far as cracking the cockpit and it had to be extensively repaired later, but it was still in functioning shape for the moment
Both of these take quite heavy beatings, despite being hella tough machines to begin with
Although as far as damage to critical components goes... X/DX, prolly
Yeah, just by raw mass of part replacements, Victory
Lmao it's Turn A all over again
yeah, I have some friends who are really into that one, probably gonna give it a shot eventually
It's mostly that every time I have thought about giving another full length Tomino show a shot, doing literally anything else was the more appealing option
Yeah, I don't doubt that 79 and Zeta are much better in that regard
I don't agree that G Reco was particularily hard to follow ~~apart from Ep 1, that one was a trashfire~~, it's mostly just that noone has any agenda and event he people who the viewer is informed are pulling the strings only ever just kinda go along with whatever is happening at the moment
You have the idological blabbering of the bad guys of what grand goals they have, and the protags just trying to survive, but as far as medium-scale strategy or specific campaign goals go, there's barely anything there, and it makes the whole thing seem kinda pointless, more like a road trip with people dying than actually fighting a war
Granted, I have so far successfully avoided 79-CCA after having a terrible time with 79 way back when, so my take on this has some major blind spots; but going off of Victory, F91, what I gather about HF and even Turn A (which is one of my favorite Gundam shows despite its flaws), all suffer from the problem of the story being really bad at communicating why anything is happening
No, more structurally about the story
Even Tomino's older works (or at least, the bits of it that I've seen) really have the same problem as G Reco already
It occurred to me the other day
lmao
Not sure if the wiki does, but it's the one thing that I've seen a ton of people throw around as being what they want to see the most in the movies, ||and how Bright reacts to that revelation||
According to one of them, the bit that allegedly happens in the HF novels about ||Bright knowingly signing the execution order for Hathaway|| is just not a plot point, and instead ||whatever the psycho captain's name was hides his identity until the end||
If the wiki is to be believed (which according to some of my mutuals who speak Japanese and have read the originals, on the matter of novels it usually isn't, so grain of salt) the Nu was a paper project in BC that didn't get built because the Hi-Nu was just better
true
I had a terrible time with it
But the show itself is in a threeway tie for being my most hated mecha show
The designs are great, no two ways about it
Victory is one of those shows where the only parts of it that stuck to my mind are the really dumb ones
right, that
My watch of Victory was like a year or so ago, so not exactly fresh on my mind either, but I do vividly remember me being baffled that the thing that everyone always said about the Hexa not being what the show does
I don't recall the show ever mentioning the bit about sensor power, so I'm guessing this is a thing that some MSV thing introduced
That's not what is in the show tjo, the wiki is straightup incorrect there
Margret was eventually promoted to being the Shrike commander, and while everyone else got a Hexa, hers as the commander type explicitly, onscreen had its equipment swapped for the normal type
||he kinda did the dumbest, most obviously gonna be ineffective suicide run wrecking the only spare V2 core fighter not all that long after the Hexa started showing up, and if I'm not at all mistaken even before that, he only ever piloted core fighters, never a full ms||
I don't think Oliver ever piloted one tho
Not entirely correct: The Hexa does have the better sensors, but somehow the regular V1 was the commander unit
Spoilers for all of animated Gundam
But yeah;
||Totalled: RX-78, Nu, Wing Zero, Double X, Ez8, Alex, Turn A, Destiny, Strike Noir, Legilis, Barbatos
Mostly fine: ZZ, F91, V2, God, Strike Freedom, Infinite Justice, QanT, Unicorn, G-Self, Age-FX
Don't know/remember: Zeta, GP01, Age-1, Age-2

Build specific:
Wrecked: Build Strike
Mostly fine: Beginning G, Kamiki Burning, 00 Sky, Core, Helios
Dunno: Team Bright RX-78||
Yup
He had help from Shia and took months, so there's plausible deniability, but yea
Yeeeaaah it's kinda bs
~~because Try wouldn't recognize stakes if it was punched in the face by them~~
Kamiki Burning was fine, yeah
Also ZZ and Age-FX I'm pretty sure
Just if the protag suit is still kicking after the dust has settled on the final battle
I'm only counting final upgrade
It's by no means the majority of suits, but still a fair chunk
At least I think that G-Self doesn't get totaled
re:Gundam protag suits that don't end up being totaled;
Barring Build series, F91, V2, God, SF/IJ (although down a backpack unit), QanT, Unicorn, G-Self
Yeah, the old ones looked a bit jank
But yea, still not great
In fairness, they're a lot less egregious when drawn by someone who knows how to proportion
Okawara, why
Seed lineart is so bad
That's one thing I do find cool about the Freedoms and Justices, they don't have typical center of abdomen pilot placement
The cockpit is very far up, so even with the cannon it might still have space up above
I choose to ignore the stated lore of Seed tech because most of it falls under the rule of ignoring 30% of Gundam exposition as meaningless flavor text makes the story better
I don't really love the TV Zero or 00 Raiser all that much tbh; they're fine, but just kinda exist to me. I like the extra flair of EW Zero and QanT
It definitely is much, but that's what I like about it, the suit design and body language fits the fighting style and character of the pilot; Kira is a resolute and hardheaded dude who will face down an army by himself if need be, and the SF very much reflects that
Even for shows that I absolutely detest, the designs are usually quite good
I don't think there is any final version hero suit that I dislike actually
They super were
I like the SF, it's a cool crowd control high maneuver artillery suit; but yeah, Hiroto earned this one
Although I kinda eish instead of Bael and NZ ~~as funny as flat Bael was~~, they'd have gone with Turn A and DX, to really committ to the AU powerhouse thing they had going with the other matchups
Hiroto piloting Rex is <:goodshit:639807794488541185>
Divers Battlogue was good stuff
Yea
That shit has to have ridiculous consumption
That would be a good reason why it runs out of particles
Right
Otherwise everyone would be running around in a G3-Saviour
It would, but game balance rules apply here
This is standard issue Gundam, and while I by no means like Try, picking on it here and ignoring it every other time feels rather... hypocritical
It's not fuel consumption tho, it's particle consumption; might just have a real high density in its beams, as the UC suit does have
I mean, it did fire a fair chunk of beams, and it's arguably the best battle in the show, so I'm not complaining
I didn't mind that one, same as when the X Jumaog has a colony-sized beam; it's a space filled with particles, so if you can properly utilite them sure, break the rendered setpieces
It doesn't, but it also eats a hyper mega cannon like it's nothing
That thing is a fortress
It still amuses me that in a 1v1, Xi could probably give Victory-era things a run for their money with its sheer mass of armor and firepower
I'd say that armir briefly became relevant again with HF and the bullshit that the Xi can shrug off in that
I mean generally, you do want a small silhouette, but the absolute paper armor of the F91 is a bit much ~~or little, I suppose~~
So they made them smaller to have less material cost while selling at the same price point
~~the reason is economy crashes~~
Until SNRI comes around because the EFF got sick of them, yeah
Also because at that point they're the only one left and can out-monopoly the bad pr
Corruption
I believe the explanation was specifically that it can only interfere with existing brainwaves, not create new ones, something along those lines
But yeah,off the top of my head the only two shows that I remember making a point of there being ways to counter funnels if you know how to are X and Beginning G of all things
Yeah, Dreadnough is a neat idea ~~too bad the story it's from sucks ass~~
Oh, missed an anti in there
But yeah, I'm thinking less dedicated suits and more this is what you do when facing !Newtype nonsense as a normal human
It's the purple Astray freakbeast, right?
That's one thing I wish Gundam did more, effective anti-funnel warfare
It does, but can't hurt to have more, especially when it was developed expecting to fight the funnels of at least the stolen Chaos
I could respect it as a scattershot missile defense thing, but the way it's used is a bit silly
Well, ish
So yeah, just Shining Finger in Italian
Palma Fiocina, I believe
Although I do quite like it as a design, very mean
A bit, yeah
Those were cool, yeah
But HGCE is nice
Yup
Also I should probably take the talk about my own thing to <#458060276550336522>
There are nuke countermeasures in the setting to prevent specifically that 😄
89 I think
Yup! And irregular corkscrews as the default maneuver to prevent enemies leading their shots; I wanted the whole combat to be a big old cat and mouse game in both directions
It's never staged outright, but G3S probably also pulls around that given its description of being so fast it hurts the pilot
I'm writing a mech thing myself ~~good joke, haven't actually done anything substantial on it in like a year~~, the way I handle it there is to just have batches of small counter-missiles attached to every surface, so anything set to seek and explode will be destroyed befire it reaches you, as well as general ridiculous speeds and maneuvers by way of biomechanical implants enhancing G-resistance
At least at launch
Which in fairness, irl missiles are also slower than ballistic projectiles
Yea
They were cool, yeah
Obviously only works in space
Probably my favorite reason for scifi why super long range doesn't work is to say that things just move too fast and unpredictably that you can't reliably aim without being easily avoided
Yeah, which I don't hate, but can't help but feel like could have been explained better by just saying that soft-/hardkill measures got so advanced that they lost viability
Yeah, both do exist, but there's still a chunk of weirdness around it a lot of the time
That's one of the tidbits I really like in IBO, that the interference only becomes an issue for communications at very long ranges
Apart from the interfering with all types of sensors and communication thing, because visual recognition obviously still works, and so should every means of cameras and laser communication
Yeah, I respect the worldbuilding around minivsky stuff for the most part
But either way, something that can create an I-Field can probably be modified to create a magnetic field as well fairly easily, and I wish that that idea was explored by something
Ah, right, it was more Minovsjy handwaving. Probably should have figured that one
They aren't? I seem to recall reading that they are essentially just a hypercharged, localized magnetic field
I shall watch that once I have wifi again tomorrow
Same tech for both
I'm still waiting for a suit to have a dual use beam weapon/gauss rifle
Yeah the psycho fields were a bit much
They're a magnetic field, effectively, you only need a generator
I-Fields are not an armor material
I watched the show with a couple of friends once who were in the very specific mindspace where the 20s and 30s of it were the thing they needed at the time, and it was ewually funny and depressing to see that every major event except the Lacus rescue is flashed back to so many times that you really don't have to watch anytjing before it
Yeah Seed flashbacks can get a bit excessive
Lel
I also kinda feel bad saying this, but I kinda never noticed his absence after a while, it just felt natural that it's only four of the pilots
...man, I never thought about how wild a ride the second half of Seed would have been with Nicol around
Yeah I can see that
Hell, have it be kinda obvious at close range so combat is still possible, but that 00 S1 trying to sniff out where the enemy could be using secondary information I could see being really cool to see explored more in-depth
Mirage Colloid and AD's Optical Camouflage do that a bit for covert ops, but I tjink it would be much more fascinating for logistics stuff
Stealth is something I wish Gundam would ponder the implications of more
It's magic armorcoating that effortlessly does to uncontained clusters of plasma eating through meters of composite armor in the blink of an eye what any real composite armor would do to plasma: it just glances off ineffectively
In a world where anti-plasma armor coating exists, nukes won't do much to that armor
You seem very caught-up in real world material science, when scifi inherently is not that
They only work for direct impsct or shredding unarmored stuff (like other missiles!) with the shrapnel
I suppose the point here is that explosives kinda suck in space in general
Also yeah, any combat spacecraft would kinda need to be emp-shoelded in general
I thought you said shockwave there. But either way, nukes are way less effective in space, not least because of the massive distances within
Ah, misread
No, it isn't; the shockwave of the molecules that drive the initial explosion still exist
It really kinda is. ~~also has the superior pilot~~
<:ChrisPray:672578403156885504> <:BigBossSalute:472805458768560129>
I found the space arc to be a bit tacked on, but other than that yeah, definitely one of the greats
Wing is unfortunately as much of a blunt object in this regard as it is in any other element of its writing
Also, there's dubious gender roles, and there's flying to the desert to yell at hyenas because you lost to a woman
^
I maintain thatWufei's dead wife from the prequel manga should have been alive and kicking ass in her Tallgeese around the time Altron showed up, would have finally had someone confront Wufei's bullshit about how women supposedly can't fight
Yea
Genocyber
Gunpla Builders Beginning G ~~as well as half a dozen supplementary mini Gundam OVAs, but those don't count because not actually a proper show~~
Gundam Age Memory of Eden
Gundam Twilight Axis
Megaton Musashi
Phoenix Wright anime
How not to summon a Demon Lord
Petit Eva
Sakugan
I don't even remember why I watched it, some time in late HS a season or two after it came out; don't know if your message is intended as "why did you even watch that crap" or "wait you seriously think noone watched this"; the latter I should probably add that I have precisely zero general anime places, so I have not the faintest clue how popular anything is; the former, genuinely no clue why I picked it up back then
I was expecting it to be an utter trainwreck, but ended up being an actually competent show
Musashi gets pretty good around like ep 4
My singular strong opinion on adaptations is that 86 is excellent in either form and you should watch and read it
Despite my unhealthy amount of media consumption, I am very out of touch with current entertainment landscape <:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
(Seasonal as in, watching it because it was coming out vs watching something I would have watched anyway as it happened to be still ongoing)
I think I watched like... one show seasonal max
https://twitter.com/ComfyBasilisk/status/1542135488487706625 LMAO
gonna be real funny to see the salt once it inevitably does turn out to be Madoka
This has "Wounded knee is a Skyrim reference" energy
lmfao
There's also Witch from Mercury, which is the other one I'm definitely gonna watch
~~also gonna have Megaton Musashi 2, the only sequel I need this season~~
I would 100% get RDs of the suits
Also that toys by Bandai bit makes me excited
legit hyped, Megaton unexpectedly slapped
Should go back to it some time
Does neat shit
From what little I've seen of the others, agreed
In either case, I still don't know if you counted Hai Furi/High School Fleet in that list, and if not, that might be what you're looking for
The problem with the semantics here seems entirely a you issue
they sure do in my circles
Neither is Eva, but people still now what that means
Arpeggio of Blue Steel
But yeah, High School fleet is specifically not ships as girls, but girls on ships is my point
right
That's ARP
oh
At least not under that name
Don't think I know that one
p much GuP in better, with boats and something resembling stakes
High School Fleet
If you just mean KanColle, ARP and the like, there is one more
Define shipgirls
but still, the weird brain control plague rats
a, didn't mean to say space rats, that was the Gundam muscle memory
Arguably more standard issue tropes than ARP
teenagers running a warship with live ammo without supervision or even a trained health officer, the fucking space rats, faceless dude school on a submarine
Hai Furi is also inherently fucking ridiculous in its premise
eeeeehhhhh
I don't get why you're always so bitter about everything
I also find it funny how ||none of the shipgirls that aren't Yamato/Musashi die, except Iona's sisters that are just blown to pieces and never again spoken of||
I don't recall how the show ends, but movie was fun
Although _that scene_ was cool
Didn't super feel her, too obsessive for my taste
right
ngl, Aoi Yuuki would fit as Iona
wait no, red was Hiei
which ranger is Takao again? Red?
Although thanks to those two, Graf Spee and I-401 are now two of my favorite warships, so I'm not complaining about either
I mean I like Hai Furi, but ARP does have more meat than it by quite a big margin
That's great
LMAO
wait, is it?
yeah if you're trying to say that ARP is copying the plot of Hai Furi, that's a very ??? take
Although still slightly miffed that... what's her face, green girl, never gets un-mascot'ed
They haven't been revealed yet, but I just wanna see what they're gonna pull for the style they're going for
I've always had a sweet spot for the final suits, they all look so optimized and way the fuck powerful
I think the thing I'm looking forward to the most mechanical-wise is the final upgrade to Aerial and Pharact
new timeline
no
I'm halfway hoping for witch to be a full 50
~~except when he talks about the nature of women~~
getting bad flashbacks to Victory from her
too many Tominoisms for my taste
I seem to recall readinf 23?
ye
Can't wait for Witch to drop, premise and staff looks very interesting
Gib scifi suffering and cool tech
same lmao
ARP at least makes a fair attempt at being a war drama
It's fluff, and does a good job at that
I thoroughly enjoyed Hai Furi, but the point of the show is girls being cute and also look at our crazy high detail boats
It also has a point to make about sunk (heh) cost fallacy and carrying on someone else's legacy
I don't think anyone here claims that either is a groundbreaking masterpiece
yeah you need to take a step back and look at the difference between having opinions and being right
because all the other shows that follow that structure are so forgettable that I don't remember their names
Almost like the thing you're accusing ARP of that supposedly makes it so much worse <:kaji_nya:900793574189309983>
no other show has _that precise plot_, but there's hundreds of shows that have large amounts of the same core story beats
Hai Furi is good fun, but it has very little behind the eyes
Noone is to blame, magic health potion fixes everything with no lasting consequences
yeah but it's still as generic as plot points come
~~space rats pilot cool giant robots~~
They're legit like the Go Nagai stans that crash unrelated discussions about any robot to tell you how much it sucks compared to the Mazinger Zero/Getter Emperor
I have two people on one of my places that keep yelling at me that everything Macross is the greatest shit ever, but they're both too far down into the cult that I trust their judgement on anything even tangentially related to it
Might to Delta after if I like that
I've been meaning to check out Frontier for a while
Easy 90% of what I watched was mecha
Apart from the Tomino bit highkey same
And I find it very unlikely that they're using that font and not have anything to say on Madoka
I mean, nothing has been confirmed yet as far as I'm aware?
Then again, so many other shows that applies to
Been meaning to check out FMP since forever
...actually no, that would be the Frame Astrays variant
I could absolutely see Manifest Destiny as the upgrade name
I'd be down for that
It has been confirmed that the cutscenes will be fully animated and voiced by anime staff, and also some vague stuff about some anime project being released alongside it
I don't count those since they're spread across like six different timelines at this point; I use sidestory in the strictest sense of being a more minor series of events playing out alongside the main story, primarily following a different set of characters
And Astray, if you wanna count two five minute clips as an adaptation, but that just goes back to how only Seed gets those
Bar Urdr Hunt that's still upcoming
Also had Stargazer, off the top of my head the only non-UC sidestory that got an adaptation
Give me a bit until I'm at my pc for that, bit too much to type out on mobile
Give me Freedom 3, Justice 3, Destiny 2 and Akatsuki 2 fighting Providence 3 with noone dying except the new Rau Le Creuset clone and I'm down
At this point I'll be disappointed if it is anything other than fanservice with little to no stakes
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
That artstyle vaguely rings a bell, what's the name again
Not even the friend watching it with me remembers what goes where
Good, thanks
Where do I continue
So, finished Yuki Yuna S1
Literally just a death compilation for some stretches of it
Everything in between is baaaaaaad
Start is an all out upgrade over an already solid start of Age 2, End is.... about as little of a trash fire as they could have made that story outline
Start and end are a retelling with different scenes
Reminds me of Gundam Age Memory of Eden
O god that sounds like such a trash fire
That pains me in particular, because for the handful of episodes that it has its shit together, Destiny is genuine good fun to watch
yupppp
Fucking Lunamaria, supposed team sniper, missing all of her shots because that's the only animation they have for that gun
I got Seed Destiny flashbacks from that message
It's the same as when a show postpones an episode today, that rarely happens because of money, it's almost always to recover from crunching something before
A lot of the money of a show goes into factors that aren't the animation itself, so the money you save through that is not that significant compared to the leeway on time you get from it
There is a money aspect to it, but it's not as big as people claim it is
same thing functionally. You save production time by not having to animate all that
As someone on one of my places pt it who is very much into production history stuff like that; "the concept of being over budget exists because shows break the allotted budget"
As I understand, recap episodes are the result of time issues rather than budget issues
yeah, I've defo seen curated machine translations that worked better than some human translations
Also hot damn, Witch Prologue went places
LycoReco is fun, yeah
~~or than the time the protagonists accidentally cause a genocide because they're too stupid to say that the warcrimes ship isn't theirs~~
I found that less egregious than the fact that they never even bring it up again
It's just the plot that is a tire fire
yeah, designs and music were on point
tru
LycoReco is gonna go hella places
To quote a friend of mine: Are they gonna kiss? Are they gonna murder each other? Yes! Which one? I have no idea
That show feely really yucky to watch because of it
And yeah, I agree
Streamer I'm watching did that as a joke watchalong once, ended up cutting it short not even an episode in after the uncomfortable amount of fanservice while explicitly calling attention to the fact that every character is underage
what
~~honestly sounds like an upgrade over Strike Witches~~
it's nice, yeah
Love these dorks
Oh wow, LycoReco ep 3 is wonderfully gay
In general, I find drawing hard lines of where a genre/trope begins and ends kind of an exercise in futility, it's much more about narrative attention and overall vibe as far as I'm concerned
I get what you mean, but at the same time I can't help but feel like we're splitting hairs over semantics at this point, lol
yes, and my point is that if it has, as you yourself put it, little relevance to the plot, it's not a useful distinction to call it a harem show, hence giving an example of where I draw that line
By that metric, any show where a character has multiple love interests is a harem
I find that 3 dilutes the term to the point of being almost useless tbh
I worry about the 300 odd people who think that Eva is a harem show
Macross Frontier really got its act together at the end, huh
As it were, G is another one of the really good ones
yeah
Also has what I'd say is the strongest opening arc of any Gundam show
But I do quite like the structure it has, that wandering around, doing mostly independent mini-arcs without a grand plan is a really good vibe for the shape the world is in
Yeah, would have been cool if we had gotten those extra 13 eps
X is definitely one of my faves
That's the MG, btw
I'm more after the Battroid modes, which...
well, in jet mode
yeah
Unfortunately, my room is less easily expanded than my funds to buy plastic robots
I don't disagree, but my shelf space sure does <:GenjuroLaugh:689563633516150872>
Well, apart from the Macross-types themselves, which are way huge
The actual canon size is around the same 15-20 meter mark as most Gundam things ~~and most real airplanes, as it were~~, it's just that the kits are all larger in scale
The 1/72 look really good, but no way in hell am I gonna fit even one of these on my shelf
I'm still lowkey annoyed that there aren't any 1/144 kits of the Frontier suits
The extra instrumentals and changed lyrics do add a lot
Oh also honorary mention to specifically Aimo ver.propaganda song
mh, I see
Got on my nerves fairly quickly, especially with how much it was used early on
That one sure does stand out, but not in a good way for me, I don't like that style of music very much
is it any good?
I'm hesitating to axe it because the premise does sound kinda fun
I ever so vaguely remember putting that on there after seeing some dude talk about it on youtube
Which... if two thirds of the standout songs in a show ostensibly about music are ops/eds, kind of an issue
The only songs that really stand out are Lion, Northern Cross and Don't be late
I can agree to the thing on Frontier
I don't even know what a third of these are
Gonna have to do some heavy housekeeping on that sooner rather than later
...god there is so much trash in my anime watchlist
I'll prolly do Delta next, what little I've seen lokked pretty fun
I finished Frontier the other night, which that and the Delta meme clip is about the only things I know about Macross
gotcha
OG Macross or one of the later ones?
On the topic of better shows, I just got someone to watch Yuki Yuna
Noted <:GenjuroLaugh:689563633516150872>
~~that came off a more mean-spirited than intended, gomen~~
The screenshot they chose does not instill confidence in your friend's taste <:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
I like cool robot more than cool plane
Also probably like 50% of the show being good is just the incredible voicework
||yuuup. And then right back to the zany nonsense at the end||
shit had me in stitches
Holy fuck new LycoReco was hilarious
I just haven't gotten around to it
I know it's good and to not watch anything beyond the original
I haven't seen E7 yet
Love that show a lot
good
The friend who got me into gear is an artist, some day I'll throw money at him to do mockup XDU card arts for a hypothetical Gundam crossover, this will 100% be one of them
X is one of my all time favorites
Been meaning to watch beyond S1 for a while now, but the schedules of me and friend I'm doing it with just haven't lined up since
Show's good
||how can it be filler when it's the episode in which Takina realizes that she's gay for Chisato||
Also the ||"Such as what situations" - *head slowly turns more and more red*||
I missed that, that's amazing
oooooooh
Also the yabaiyabaiyabai when Chisato jumps to get the table out of the way
The thing that made me laugh above all else was the ||panties|| plot at the start, the comedic timing throughout the entirety of that was SO on point
But first XBC2
I've been meaning to check out Call of the Night
beautiful
It's so good
lmao Kojima got hooked on LycoReco
https://twitter.com/Kojima_Hideo/status/1551212854631878661
The alleged Tomino interview that claim comes from is, 100%, completely, fake
I kinda hate that meme (as in, the argument, not this specific image) because it's based on a bad edit someone on Facebook made after losing a powerscaling debate
Not to mention that a lot of media that advertises itself as such fails to actually explore the culture and unique struggles of said minorities, instead just leaving it as surface-level aesthetic
But if that's the only selling point I can't help but feel like the story itself can't be all that interesting, because if it were, why not talk a bit about that as well
Like, representation of minorities is good, and should be included in more media
It has the same vibe as Disney promising their fifteenth "first openly gay character" as a selling point
what's the word here
yeah, that one is a bit....
The proportions in the lineart just look bad
This is about literally everything else other than the skin color
wat
It really does look like that
||Starts out with someone melting down what I'm going to assume is the OG Gundam, immediately cut to some woman being burned at the stake, only to burst into a vengeful flame spirit immediately murdering a noble cheering it on||
And yeah, that scans
Setting premise is that the Gundam is an old war hero that has since become a symbol for oppression (source: Kakarot covering this a couple weeks back)
Official post, has a link to a preview
https://twitter.com/heros_1101/status/1552852664261623809
Oh right, all the toku people on my Gundam places were going nuts over that, now I remember
Vaguely rings a bell, who is that again
yo that design looks dope actually
Like how in TV Eva, they use a space shuttle hull to protect against Ramiel's beam
But similarily, NL armor at the end of the day it just souped up thermal coating that happens to also give some protection against physical impacts
yeah, I'm familiar with the concept
But something like the Age-FX or Xi, with a large quantity of non-beam funnels is going to tear them apart with relative ease
The much more useful approach to who would win is to think in terms of effectivity; for IBO suits in particular, their strength is one vs one melee, so they're naturally going to have an edge over things that rely heavily on ranged beams
It is weird, but honestly not any weirder than Gundarium, Phase Shift or E-Carbon, so it's well in line with the rest of the franchise
In general, the whole idea that X always wins against Y is fundamentally dumb and not how combat works
It's not an instant win button by any means, but a potent force multiplier
And like, Hashmal's beam still annihilated an entire town even after the brunt of the force being scattered
yeah
sure thing, buddy
oh you blocked me for not taking your bullshit
whose name, even
Dude literally what the shit are you talking about
?
this is not unique to anime in any way, shape or form
See shit like the director of The Boys talking about how whatever the hell the dude's name was could totally beat Superman
That's a strawman and a half
I'm gonna massively x to doubt that powerscaling would not have happened without shonen audiences
yeah, got a couple mutuals like that as well
yeah, Gunpla places are generally more chill than Gun_dam_ places
How is people being toxic to newcomers because they are not part of their percieved closed-off bubble a me problem
Every five years or so, the show that is to blame for brigning in all the bad stuff switches, because can't have something new and popular that gets people into it that weren't previously
no
"oh the Gundam fanbase has only been bad since Toonami brought in THE NORMIES"
This is the exact kind of shit I mean when I talk about the elitism
Honestly
I don't speak any functional amount of Japanese and have not read into the matter, so I can not and will not comment on how things are over in Japan, or have been before the official localization of Wing, but for as long as a sizeable English-speaking audience has existed, it has been a shitshow
the English-speaking Gundam fanbase at large was a cesspool from the moment of its creation
I wasn't there when it happened, but I have seen the remnants of the turn of the century hateblogs against Relena because how dare she interject in the Heero/Duo OTP
Nah, Gundam fans were never chill
Pretty on point. Also add a good old dose of elitism and cultish admiration of Tomino specifically
far too much baseline toxicity
I have a pointed disliking for the general Gundam fanbase
I have not heard that story before, do tell
Wait hold up
fair. I forgot that Bandai owns the SRW IP
The sidestory it's in unfortunately kinda blows, but oh well, at least we got cool robots out of it
Pale Rider is such a good design
(for the uninitiated: That is not actually a Gundam, it is the Huckebein from SRW)
It's pretty good, yeah
lel
Mika openly goes against Orga's orders during the Hashmal battle, because they don't fit his mental image of what Orga would want from him, and Orga throughout the entire show pushes himself to take bigger and bigger gambles to live up to what he thinks Mika's mental image of him is
It's a very toxic relationship, but fascinating to unravel how they each follow their own, misunderstood idea of what the other is and wants
Also beautifully evident at the evening before the final battle when ||Orga is dead, and like three sentences of Mika prevent the entirety of Tekkadan from throwing their lives away in a futile act of revenge||
Whenever Orga is out of commission, their real dynamic shows through; the one subtly in charge is Mika, pushing Orga to make a decision. He's the core figure holding Tekkadan together
Mika is a really interesting character if you look past the surface
Especially in S1 when half of their gear is kinda jury-rigged together from whatever they had laying around, very much what would happen in a real military
yeah, I quite like the aesthetic of IBO on the whole
lack of self-awareness much?
my guy you were the one just hollering about how a Ball could beat Barbatos
true
That didn't even get the Japanese acronym for IBO right
Is this the time I mention that the alleged Tomino interviews on how a GM could beat Barbatos is completely fake and made by someone on Facebook who got salty over losing a powerscaling debate, grabbed a random screenshot of Tomino at a con and put some Japanese text over it how Tomino has totally said that?
My guy weren't you here in chat earlier complaining about how insufferable powerscalers are?
I also feel it to be a bit ridiculous to complain about unrealistic tech when the core principle of the original worldbuilding was magic particles controlled by space wizards
Same exact idea
Hyaku-Shiki
It literally has been
What are you talking about
yeah, also the mace sword and ultra-large mace for Lupus and Rex
So while the integrity of the reasoning is debatable, there is a reason given why it still works
If memory serves, the Gundam frames were made out of more or less the setting equivalent of Gundarium, being some rare alloy that is hellishly expensive, but significantly tougher than normal armor material
Artstyle reminds me of FLCL
I've seen screenshots of that before
ooh, that thing
that's a bold release strategy
that's
The only thing I know about E7 is that everything is a music reference and everything past the original apparently sucks
What else did Bones do again?
Specifically the round one with the red emblem that's in the movie, don't care much for the others
I like the big head crest it has
I do wanna get myself a KoG at some point
so the old ones
There's none of the variety and visual storytelling that the FSS designs had
Spindly with spikes and mostly one color
And critically, they all look the fucking same
yeah the GTM designs look like ass
pre- or post-Nagano redesigning everything
Which Five Star Stories mechs are you talking about
a bit, yeah
That's a cool backpack
mh
That one is kind of the midpoint of the aesthetic of all the 90s Gundam shows apart from Turn A, I like it
That does look cool indeed
Well then, I have said nothing
oh wait, those are different units?
It doesn't mesh well with the rest of the aesthetic
I find the glasses on the 30 a touch too ridiculous for my taste
...yeah no, you're totally right
the tape is a bit much visually, but I like the rest of the design
Which sounds a lot meaner than intended, I don't hate the Exbein's design
It looks like the offspring of the Strike Freedom and Vilkiss that has fallen into the Titans' paint bucket
Incredible
pffffffft
That gun is so aggressively Crossbone
That is both very funny and probably the most galaxy brain way to do this I have ever seen
I have nothing to base this on not having seen either show, but it occurs to me that my mental image of Aquarion is more or less Ideon if it were made on a sugar high listening to jam project after pulling two allnighters in a row
There was a plot in Frontier that got resolved by boob-shaped steamed buns, so that kinda sets my expectations for "shit that is too outlandish for Macross"
See that I wouldn't be surprised to see in Macross, either
I am intrigued
That's quite a bar
Aquarion I have no clue what context I am missing for things drawing on it
Like, I haven't seen a good chunk of other big names either, but for those I can usually kinda extrapolate what I don't have
Not having seen that feels like a double blindspot almost
I've gotta watch Aquarion one of these days
The funniest thing about the Appleseed movie to me is still that one of the Iron Man movies almost 1:1 copied the suit assembling while falling out of a building sequence
It has a cool aesthetic, yeah
Despite Appleseed being one of the things that primed me on mecha in the first place
I still need to watch GitS, for some reason never got around to it
If not for Shin Eva, 86 would without competition be my favorite anime of last year
Although a large part of that is 86 just being an exceptional show in every regard
got the whole Spearhead Squadron on my shelf
I like them
Might actually do that next, not feeling like UC and the only other Gundam things I have left are Divers and Real
E7 has been on the list for forever
Given the hp pools in SRW, that might as well be not getting hit at all lmao
That's actually a cool design
mh
Is it because some other stat scales off of that and having 100% in in breaks the math?
Apart from the final stage of the expansion pass where oops, the most effective strategy is now completley unplayable because everything has 8.5k in every stat
Minmax on attack and evasion and you're good
yeah, very much so
In Crossrays (and I've been told in G Gen at large) it's kinda the be all end all beyond raw damage numbers
Actually, how important is attack range in SRW?
oh yeah, Sousei no Aquarion goes incredibly hard
time for gay
o shit, right
The frequency at which Discotek drops these massive "oh by the way, we have this now" announcements impresses and terrifies me
I haven't seen 5 yet, but given how 4 went, I would not be surprised if they actually would
There is no heterosexual explanation for LycoReco <:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
Ayyy. Yeah, I quite enjiyed Seed on the whole, in spite if uts definite flaws
ruffles feathers*

||*until about halfway through ep 4||
The voicework in this show is so incredibly good
All the other cast lives on having interesting explorations of their dynamic with other characters
Actually scratch that, in terms of individual characters, she is
I'm not sure I agree on _the best_, but definitely one of the best
||I think the ending is a bit weaker than the middle still; Blitz going down through Josh-A is probably my favorite war is hell, yo-arc in all of Gundam||
||I actively hated Flay for pretty much the entire show, but man, they nailed that death||
Oh yeah, those do pack quite a punch
My entire youtube feed at this point is educational, music and vtubers with the occasional lockpickinglawyer or mighty jingles video in between
It sounds plausible, and I don't doubt that Anno had some degree of nationalistic sentiment, but not nearly to the degree and in the particular brand that the article thinks
Have not seen Shin Goji, can't comment on that
I don't disagree thst it's the same, but I do think the article reads a lot more malicious intent into it than justified, when there are a lot of other factors playing into that decision
It's very outrage commentary
It tunnel visions so much on the aspect the author wants to see that it doesn't even consider any other explanation other than ill intent
Yeah, it's very... what's the word here
The bits about German are also not only blatantly wrong in some parts (source: am German, that is not the connotation a chunk if these terms carry), it also completely ignores the larger context of the usage of German in anime and makes it only about how it totally relates to Nazi Germany
There us value in the underlying idea, but the execution honestly reads more like a parody
Okay no, framing Engrish as an intentional slight against international science is three bridges too far
But trying to make a stock romance plot featuring a foreigner into an allegory for world conquest is jumping the shark
The flags and general worldbuilding fluff being very Japan-heavy is fair enough, point taken
This very much reads to me as extremely heavy confirmation bias
> Also, no reason is given as to why she should fall for the Japanese coach, unless we are meant to believe that Japanese manhood is irresistible.
The bit about the supposed domination of Jung as symbolic for conquering the world at large is more than a tad ridiculous
About a third-ish into the articles; definitely has some good points in it, but I feel the thesis is overstated to the point of bordering on bad faith
I won't ignore that, because like with the subject of Anno's personal life giving context to the opinions in his work, that detail gives context to the analysis of Gunbuster it's mainly about. I'll definitely read the rest regardless of that, but I find that detsil important to note
Okay reading the first part of the article; I can't comment on the portrayal of Anno biographically, but there are definitely some parts of the commentary on Eva that are blatantly misinformed in a way very indicative of Western Anime Fan perspective
I didn't get a super imperialist vobe from it, but I am not very versed in post-WWII, pre-economic collapse jp nationalist narratives, so I'm not ruling its existence out by any means
I don't think I've seen that one, sounds interesting
Genuinely fuck that
Bruh that emote name
~~I mean JKR's stuff isn't great, but calling it crime fiction seems a bit harsh~~ <:MillaarcV:673239269036392526>
I'll have to mull this one over
They could have easily had the raid be staged by some international Seele-owned PMC, but the fact that it is the Japanese army carrying it out gives the whole a rather different flavor
Which definitely plays into the brand of nationalism we're discussing here, but the fact that it is the Japanese army doing it on orders of the Japanese prime minister is an important detail
Especially with the flamethrowers, since their primary presence in Japanese cultural consciousness (as far as I am able to tell as an outsider looking in, in any case) is that of it being the signature atrocity of US landing forces
It is, but it is very explicitly framed as a bad thing
Hell, I'd say the flamethrower scene alone does that
I think EoE fairly categorically counteracts any JSSDF cool moments
Also brb, irl tjings
Wait, it was? I know for a fact that I've read a sourced claim somewhere that Anno took over after the first VHS with ep 1 and 2 did poorly
He definitely wasn't, but it's another thing that gets swept under the rug in a way that I think makes the whole article a lot weaker than had it been properly addressed with the immediate context surrounding it
One minor gripe I have with the argument of worldbuilding is that Anno only took over Gunbuster from ep 3 onwards, so what was established in the first two episodes was the work of someone else, forgot the name
~~granted, Bandai doesn't need the CR money, but point still stands~~
Gundam X and Nadesico won't ever see a dime of Crunchyroll money
Also because a lot of my favorites were never on any streaming site to begin with
Me pirating shit has made a lot of creators far more money through merch than paying for every streaming service in the world
Also that
My internet can do two 8k youtube videos simultaneously, but Crunchyroll player? Nah, not a chance
It's frankly unforgivable to charge money for a service that needs to buffer for five minutes to load a 480p standard-length episode
I'd have a lot less problem with CR acquiring things if their service wasn't complete dogshit
I would not recommend Miller's report honestly
https://twitter.com/GoodSmile_US/status/1555388896074137600
Kinda like Kira at the end of Gundam Seed
||yeah, if it happens, it will only be the actual worst of the worst probably||
I'm also fully expecting something like ||weed joker shooting Takina, Chisato thinking she's dead and going completely ballistic on him with actual bullets|| for the end of the show
I'm expecting them to do something like ||Chisato pretending to be dead, so people check her heartbeat, find nothing, assume she is actually dead and leave her alone||
admittedly fair, but one of the biggest Gundam nuts I know got into it that way, so it definitely works, and it's a very good show
yeah Gundam recap movies by enlarge are kinda bad, 79 nonwithstanding
Fwiw, the points of entry into Gundam that I tend to recommend are 08th, AWGX, G, IBO, Turn A and Build Fighters/ReRise if you're willing to dive into not understanding the injokes
A while ago I dreamt that they had announced an adaptation, woke up and went haha never <:FeelsBadMan:758066947538550876>
And Slayers, people whose tastes generally align with mine told me it's pretty good
Not only is the rest way the fuck too long, I've also caught what are supposedly some of the best fights by chance over the years and was not terribly impressed
The only one of the big name shonens I have any interest in ever watching is FMA/B
That hates Hibiki
a little relic critter
Exact interaction
Yeah, LycoReco is really fun
Which bodes a lot better than every other shounen, where all I ever hear is how cool the fights are and how totally strong the MC is
yeah, basically everything I ever hear about FMAB is about how good the character dynamics are
well then
lmao w h a t
Is it the one where ||fire ice boy fucking dies|| or is there a yet newer one
Can't wait for the Shinkalion MLP Miku
||I'm expecting it to go something like this; Nanao's reservation for Ena is on the same day as Asumi's reservation for someone else, Nanao meets Asumi in the lobby as she's leaving, Ena happily greets Asumi, cue general awkwardness as Nanao realizes that oh shit, I had it the wrong way around||
(Asumichan)
||Nanao, you absolute disaster||
Already cannot wait for the next one
New Asumi is out
No recaps, just a shorter season
Yeah, because S1 only had 11
Yeah, but if I'm not completely mistaken, 86 didn't subtract the recaps from its total episode count is what I mean
Which, granted, isn't saying much given my very particular niche of media
It's the first I've seen a show doing it
Although something that I do respect them for is doing the recap episodes as a separate thing
Both seasons are incredible, and while there is absolutely room for more, it ends in a narratively satisfying place
But I strongly echo the sentiment that it is well worth watching
Yeah, 86's production was completely fucked
yeah it's just kind of a good, fun show
Probably still the funniest thing in GuP to me is how utterly useless Chi-Ha-Tan is when by all other indicators you'd think that this show would just go muh Japan
~~at least if my memory on Italian doctrine serves me, it's been some years and I have gotten very rusty on a topic I was never fully interested in to begin with, so grain of salt there~~
Which is unsurprising given how much they operated in tandem in Greece and Africa
They do, but Italian doctrine is just not that well documented, and mostly the same as early German doctrine
I think it's more likely that they didn't find any documented tactics for the Italian army that wasn't mostly the same as German tactics and just went fuck it
That OVA was more fun than it had any right to be
I think that's the one Melua means
But it is nnot a good show by any metric other than detail on the CG models and camerawork
I like the show
I mean GuP is just kind of a trainwreck in general
But yeah, unless it's mecha-adjacent or a personal friend strongly recommends it, chances are I haven't seen it
But that was years ago, one of the first anime I watched with the expectation of it being Anime™️, so might as well not have watched it as far as my awareness of its production is concerned
I did watch those actually, right
My media consumption is very specific and a lot of it very old
yes
oh yeah, no question about that
I have not seen any show from the 2010s that had any recap episodes, so I can't comment on that
Which do take up runtime of the show itself
Unlike, say, Gundam Wing with its three recaps in five episodes after the director change
If you watch it back now, you won't notice that the production was fucked, because it didn't affect the show in any way
But I'm approaching this less from an as-it-aired standpoint as much as the standpoint of having a finished product after the fact, which they succeeded in doing
yes
They're separated out as its own thing instead of bloating the actual show, and no runtime was cut for it
that the recap episodes were not counted for the episode count, there are still 12 full episodes in S2
The story was done by ep 11
When that came out, everyone I was watching it with just went wait what the fuck
Ep 12 was a surprise
yeah, that
I mean yeah, but that aired after S1 was done
....w a t
S2 is a proper S2
It could end there and nothing would feel out of place
86 S1 is a complete story
Do you mean to call 86 S2 a second half of S1
I don't think it will tbh
very
the clowns part isn't the thing that makes me go hmmm about it
apart from the clown plot, that one got a bit weird and Freud-y at the end
And has some pretty compelling characters, too
yup
there you have it <:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
> it's cool
And the epsiode is good as well!
I hate the meme around the Tequila Gundam, but the design slaps
Feel like they should have collapsed ||the last space bit into the actual final fight on earth, that felt very tacked on and drawing out some arc resolutions to there damaged the overall impact in my opinion||, but most everything else is really good
G is very fun, one of my faves
That's a weird strawman that some self-proclaimed old guard gatekeeper dudes have in the west, but it's not the case at all
no
Japan _really_ likes Seed and Zeta
I'd also say Hathaway qualifies, according to some interviews, the 3d came before the 2d in production there
Oh yeah, D4DJ is pretty good
I'll see myself out
Could one perhaps say that the morals were MIA for this episode?
I'm tempted to give it a shot myself
1) it is absolut garbage, don't waste your time on it
2) it's the most fun you can have with a brain off big robot show
I've heard precisely two things about that show
y'know, normal roommate stuff
Friendly roommates that turn into a tomato explaininf why girls should wear sexy panties and lay on the others chest listening for their heartbeat
I mean
I mean, LycoReco has been gay as fuck so far, so
https://tenor.com/view/senator-palpatine-anakin-skywalker-phantom-menace-gif-10607636
wellthen
I'm not _expecting_ that one to happen, but at the same time after Interspecies Reviewers and whatever that other one was, I also wouldn't be surprised anymore
Asumichan adaptation when <:Ver:704169051391524875>
There's also a big difference between muh political correctness and excusing slavery
And I refuse to pay for something that doesn't even meet bare minimum, while using their market size on limiting availability and strongarming people into paying for said excuse of a service
it is just Crunchy that runs like garbage
nah, everything else works perfectly on my end
It is throttled to the point of being unusable over here
On top of ad breaks
I have a very beefy internet connection, their player took four three minute loading breaks per episode on a 480p show
Yeah, I don't say boycott CR because they want money, I say boycott CR because they want money for a product that would be disappointing even as a free service
Their webplayer is a genuine insult
It is, but Crunchyroll is also just shit even when you pay for it
Crunchyroll is a terrible service that should be boycotted
Can't wait for the next ep
Show is incredibly fun so far
She just wanted to drive that really fancy car in the parking lot
She does have a license
For now, I'm just gonna be excited to see Calendula performed with the kind of quality that the show has visually
I doubt that they'll be able to nail it as hard as First Mix did, but I'll also gladly let myself be proven wrong on that
So TIL that D4DJ is gonna have a second season
The most you're gonna get is a under these specific circumstances, one has an advantage over the other
Honestly any X would always win against Y argument is stupid and fundamentally not how combat works
oh you're in for a ride, Das
||the DA is planning a raid on Majima. Takina is part of that. Majima, meanwhile, appears to currently be getting a new artificial heart after very clearly having taken a liking to Chisato.|| LycoReco is gonna Do The Thing
I think they're going for something far different
It's a season if it's called so in the marketing and intended as one narrative block
Barring very few exceptions, if something gets more content later on, that's not a part 2 of season 1, that is S2
yeah no, that's very dumb
If a show gets aired as 50 episodes in one go with no subdivision, that's a 50 episode season
*stares at Üso beating Shakti in the Victory novels*
one of many
yup
There is so much dumb edgy bullshit it's genuinely baffling
I swear to god every time I learn something new about UC novels I am more glad to not read UC novels
It's a fun little show, I need to get back to S2 onwards of it
Show, typo
Which is far from the sgow's greatest failing, but it is the one that is most indicative of its structural problems
It's padded to shit, one character gets abducted by the enemy faction like six times
It's also just kinda not a great show lol
Oh I will, that shit has me captivated
Counterpoint: ||The exact same thing happening to Chronicle|| in Victory, except it has better comedic timing
That's a cool way of showing that
In which case yeah, I fucking dig that
I'm gonna go out on a limb and say that the mc's look is a Neverending Story self-image plot thing
Man, that scratches an itch I hadn't thought about in so long that I forgot how much I loveds that vibe of show
Friend watched ep 1 of Accel World with me
Y is a fairly common prefix for experimental craft, in scifi as in real life
VF are the production models
Prototype I think
that is the MG
25, not 23
But the VF-23 is BIG
Dunno about the rest
Well, the Frontier ones are

1/100 is not gonna be small
The 1/72s are significantly bigger than an average MG
nah
I thought they were about 16ish meters top to bottom
Are they?
A battroid is about the same height as your average Mobile Suit
Those will still be about MG size
Yeeeaaaaah
You can pretty much watch 2 and nothing else and get a good 12ish wpisode show out of it
First is mid, second is quite good, third starts out strong, but at some point loses all of it in the span of like five minutes and never really recovers, on top of being structurally a character assassination of its two best characters for the sake of hitting a checkbox on some forced tropes
Age is split into three and a half segments effectively
The premise sounds interesting, but all I ever heard about it was that the execution is aggressively mid apparently
I had that on my potential read list for a while, is it any good?
MoE zurns Zeheart from ||proto-McGillis into Lelouch at home, which is definitely an upgrade, but still not a place that makes sense for his character to go after his arc in 2||
But unfortunately, only so much they can do
Memory of Eden makes so many things better in the parts where it isn't just a clipshow
Well, those and ||Zeheart "I must protect those serving under me" Galette, the last step of whose arc was to throw away the char mask saying he won't need it anymore completely going back on all of that and becoming space Hitler jr intentionally throwing his subordinates into the meatgrinder because gotta have that CCA plotline||
Those are about the biggest offenders
Gotcha. Prolly gonna wait for a couple of episodes to be out and see what people say about those, likely gonna give it a shot if they'Re good
Which is why I ask, is it worth the time, because the concept dcoes interest me, but only if the show actually explores it beyond being the setpiece
That's the main criticism I've heard; that it is exactly not that, but rather pretty much generic fantasy show beyond the opening arc
?
Watch the trailer for Fukkatsu, spot the one character who is super not supposed to be there, mentally cut out all the things that made that character more than a setpiece and you have all the context you need
The recaps are a complete nothingburger
Okay that's dope
They retcon a single character death by cutting out all the arcs with that character in it, and edit them into some scenes after they died in the show
"""Altered plot"""
Neat
So Code Geass movies but worth watching kinda?
It's a chunk, but yeah, there's definitely longer
Or am I thinking of something else
Isn't Owl House the one with the witch that Disney canned for being too gay
Well apart from ||Jeremiah just telling Shirley to be nonspecifically careful when he did his geass undo thing, because she had no lost memories to regain||, but that's necessitated by the death retcon and not related to CC in any direct fashion
They might have shuffled around a line or two, but not in a way that impacts the story in a meaningful way
Well, at least no change in text that matters
There's no difference in the text, only the implications that the sequel carry
it's just that Fukkatsu added on to that and changed her characterization by proxy
The ending is the same, shot by shot
I mean yes, but that is not a matter of any actual change in the footage
It does establish a good chunk of The Deeplore™️, but that's mostly stuff for 3
It's also at the very beginning ~~pun absolutely intentional~~ of the movie and doesn't really relate to anything in 1
Man I don't like the direction that the second half of Accel World is taking so far
This pic has strong shared braincell energy
Unit 01 is terrifying in a way that few other mecha are
I adore that shot so much
Selection bias of course happens everywhere because people liking the same thing for the same reasons will naturally flock together, but it looks to be happening more than with other properties in the case of rwby
My (admittedly pretty out of date since I stopped caring entirely about popularity of shows some five years ago) outside perspective on the whole thing is that RWBY exists in something of a weird bubble where the people into it far overestimate its actual popularity
The continuity already wasn'T great in the original airing, but DC just yeets it out the window completely
DC usually makes the episodes better, but the Kaworu one is just straightup worse lmao
I'm not sure depressing is the word I'd use. Heartwrenching sure, and certainly tragic; but ||the various ghost scenes scattered throughout are too warm and at peace that I walked away from it feeling particularily depressed; they've both found their happiness in the afterlife together; it's that bittersweet, but ultimately uplifting touch that does reframe pretty much the entire movie in my opinion||
It's also really really good and I wish this got a full show and a model kit line
It's a student project for their thesis
I mean, it is indie
yes, Ikuno
I think?
Ikuno?
what's her face in FranXX
Wait I take that back
but then again, what do I even watch outside of those two
Outside of Gundam and magical girls I'm not sure I recall a single instance where an even slightly important character was hard confirmed to be gay
My exposure to media is very skewed towards a very specific niche so I'm not even gonna attempt to speak with any degree of authority to trends at large, but gut feeling is that Japan has more weird hangups about never hard confirming it
Japan
||that is hard confirmation||
And, well, ||"so teach swings that way" from Chisato||
yeeeaaaaaa
tru
lmao same braincell
||well the line itself does, just the end of episode punchline in response to it of "now there is noone around to see" *lays down flat on chest* doesn't||
It's in the episode where they escort the old dude around the city
||I mean also that, yeah||
lmao no worries
Are we talking about different shows
no I was talking about LycoReco
||wait who||
The ||don't touch my boobs in public|| one?
There are a lot of things in it where you could plausibly construct a heterosexual explanation if you try hard enough, but all of them have completely different ones that don't go together well
yeah, LycoReco is effectively all but confirmed
LMAO
gonna take your word on it
have not seen that
That song hits SO GOOD when played over ||the harpies descending||
I'd say still watch it, but some time after EoE; if nothing else to experience Tamashii no Refrain in its intended context
man, LycoReco wrapped up really nicely
I'm gonna be watching Gundam Witch, that looks promising
but eh, not like it matters
no, I'm distinctly remembering the full name, the only reason it stuck to me was because it sounded so strange
I could have sworn that I've heard that name thrown around for easily 5+ years
wild, must be conflating it with something else, then
But I remember hearing that name MUCH before that
I know, yeah
I'm completely out of the loop here, isn't WEP super ancient? I remember hearing that name around pretty much as long as I've watched anime as like This One Old Thing
well, before Nagano decided to be Nagano and turned all the designs to shit when he rebranded it as Gothicmade
I like the KoG at least
Although despite the best efforts of some of my mutuals, I don't think I'm ever gonna read it, just sit down and watch the movie and see if that is gonna be any good
also that
As much as mecha is my main genre, I've watched like maybe 15% of my watchlist in it if I'm being generous
Or Rayearth, Big O, Dunbine, L-Gaim, Dragonar, Ideon and RahXephon
I still haven't watched Patlabor, GGG, FMP, Aquarion, most of early UC Gundam, any Macross apart from Frontier, all of these are as relevant to the mecha genre as E7 is
I know of E7, it's been on the list for a long time, but so have a great many other things
I know, but I also have by far not watched all mecha
Because I don't watch a lot of anime outside of mecha and mecha-adjacent things
I have watched legit none of those lmao
vs the end of the show would not have been?
Again; halfway through the show. Had it been an issue then, especially Bardiel and Zeruel, both of which before that episode 20 mark, would not have been nearly as exquisitely animated
If budget issues had been that massive this early on, it would not have only affected 25 and 26
That is before some of the flashiest battles Eva has
I have no reason to doubt his timeline, given the literal hundreds of hours that he spent on going through everything there is on the internet, English or otherwise; according to him, the rough draft for ep 26 was written about halfway through the show
https://forum.evageeks.org/thread/20114/TV-Production-Timeline/ probably the most comprehansive listing on the production out there; the guy who made it really really knows his stuff there
If you're gonna make it about an external factor, at least say time; quoting the guy who knows more about Eva's production than anyone else I've ever talked to: "The concept of being over budget exists for a reason". Like sure, meeting an air date is an issue. But by the time 25 and 26 were in production, Eva was a commercial success. Budget restraints were not the issue
Yes, but the preproduction version is also significantly different from the first handful of episodes
I'm saying that regardless of if you like it or not, there was intent on Anno's part of making it weird and artsy like that
It's like the elevator scene that is also commonly cited to be that long without anything happening for the same reason; when in fact, the DC that was made after the fact when Gainax was swimming in cash, the scene was made longer
I do not.
I'm arguing Iski's notion that 25 and 26 only happened that way becase of production issues
Especially considering the amount of runtime EoE spends on similar things during 3I
But I don't think they were nearly as impactful on how the show ended as they are commonly cited to be
oh no, there definitely were, a great many of them
It's also a very in-depth character study that would not have been possible in the same runtime in any other format
Sure, EoTV is out there and unusual, but there very clearly is intent behind the episodes, to the point where I don't think they are the result of just going "o shit what do we do"
You seem to be under the impression that there is no reason to make an episode like that other than production issues
I don't have the date on hand right now, but production on EoE started either not long after/even before the show finished airing
They ran into time issues a bit, but even with that, 25 and 26 were never some sort of rushjob to wrap it up and hope for a movie being greenlit
Eva made bank out the ass by the time it got to the late show, any and all budget they needed would have been approved
Said production issues, contrary to what you commonly hear, were not budget tho
oh no, was referring to the message before yours
The seeds for that were planted really early on
not really
no, he's not Bellri <:Ver:704169051391524875>
There's not really anywhere to go up narratively after ||an earth-sized mech other than even bigger celestial bodies||, and TTGL already did that ~~and as far as I'm concerned fell flat on its face doing it~~
I'm not positive they even have creative staff anymore afdter that whole affair some three, four years back
Not like Gainax is still a company that at all matters to begin with
As you said, not really any way of going beyond what Diebuster did without delving into Mazinger Zero what even are stakes crap
I'd be interested in seeing them try, but at the same time, I don't exactly expect them to succeed
oh no, I'm fully shitposting here
Shit's been """"confirmed not dead"""" for over 20 years at this point
no, that will be Aim for the Top 3
So it was still one movie for all intents and purposes
3 and 4 were originally planned to be 45 minutes each and air in the same session in theaters
I mean
And had four complete script rewrites
I mean Shin in no small part took so long to come out because Anno directed two other movies in between
Hell, probably the best scene of the entire sequence is the one with ||Shinji floating in empty space as a doodled lineart, contemplating the nature of boundaries and unlimited freedom||
I argue that the abstractness is what makes it relevant
If it was meant to replace, it would have replaced the episodes in subsequent releases
EoE was never intended to replace EoTV. It compliments them, yeah, but they cover different ground
I don't get which part of Anno being in a fucked headspace and wanting to make something like that is so hard to understand
Response to the audience reaction aside; not even Gainax was this bad with money, and the point in time at which proto-EoE was shelved in favor of EoTV goes against the idea that they suddenly ran out
why is the production-wise first one tagged ||hentai ova||
my local provider has related entities listed by release date
hold on
equally noted
I'll cross that particular bridge when I get there, but for the time having a starting point is good enough for me
noted
Given my new time schedule, certainly not complaining about the (I imagine much shorter?) movies being the choice over what I gather is a fairly sizeable show
got it
re:Nanoha in <#336310266654490624>; been meaning to check it out for a while now, which one of the like two dozen entries in the franchise is the place to start?
||I'm not positive he was actually supposed to be real in that sequence, or just a hallucination, given how out of it the guy was at the time||
The more you know lmao
WELL THEN
If done right, I imagine something like this would do quite well at setting the tone of something; expect fanservice, get the opposite. Of course would need to be properly utilized to not just be for shock value, but that goes for functionally everything, so I left that part unsaid
yuuuuup
Also yeah, 86 shower scene was good ~~like everything else about the show~~
I mean yeah, but I imagine it more to the tune of the O GOD WHY completely overriding the fanservice aspect. As gruesome as Misato's scar is, it's still a very cool looking and generally aesthetically pleasing scar
Something that I wish a show did at some point was to set up a shower scene as generic fanservice, only to reveal some sort of horribly unpleasant scar or injury that was previously covered by clothing, would be a fun subversion of the trope I feel
I think it's more about how those are most of the nude scenes by volume, not the existence of the scenes itself
~~I mean at least those don't take up two thirds of the screen during an otherwise very emotional and impactful scene~~
That one kinda kills the mood
My only take here is that I really could have done without the gratuitious shot of Tsubasa's crotch as she's in the middle of her pre-Swan Song monologue
I liked it in the end, but at the same time, probably the most aggressively Anime show I've watched in recent memory
Frontier is kind of a lot to get used to in general tbh
If there's one thing that I've learned from Frontier, it's that Macross is weird and goofy
...I'm sure it'll make sense in context
there definitely was someone green on stage tho
Don't know their names, it's just a clip someone on one of my places likes to post
is Delta the one where the soldiers are streaming the enemy idol concert, their superior tells them off for it and gets insulted by a voiceclip for not donating enough
I think that's the first time I've ever heard someone say something good about AO other than "it would have been fine if it were not a sequel to E7"
Accel World Infinite Burst sure is an anime movie
I never said that I think Misato's scar is not enough or that I wish every show did something like that; merely that I'd like to see _a_ show at some point do such a rugpull. Of course not every show can or should do that, but that kinda goes without saying to me
I'm not gonna pay for a service that has more ads and worse video quality than shady site #1651351
yeah
I would consider using their service if it didn't take four minute long buffers for a 480p episode on top of the three existing ad breaks
https://tenor.com/view/no-i-dont-think-i-will-gif-23864982
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
But "someone on another discord said it" does not clear my bar for convincing evidence
I mean yes
Seen a couple too many occasions of people with too much free time successfully gaslighting people for years about holding a position they never had
I'm gonna take that one with a big ol grain of salt
First time hearing that, where was that stated?
I assume it's Crunchy throwing a hissy fit about exclusive streaming
||Okay yeah, imagined as much. Makes sense it would end that way, so I'm not gonna dock the show any points for it, but just as a last stand it didn't hit that spot I like. I respect the show for what it does, and its popularity is definitely well deserved||
But yeah, apart from that, excellent show that I unfortunately just didn't vibe with. Don't regret the time spent on it, but I don't think I'll be doing much in the way of going back to it
Mh.
The only thing that I take actual issue with is ||the end of the fight against Adam whatever, that just didn't scan right as the final battle||, but I assume that's an established lore thing that the showmakers weren't allowed to fuck with, so not really a fault of the show as much as having its hand forced by circumstances
It's that style of Trigger show that just doesn't do it for me
It just didn't grab me
Oh no, the show is really good
Edgerunners was p alright
Victory had 51 and a new frame of that Haro animation each time, that's the longest one I've personally seen
||Nanao you beautiful trainwreck||
New Asumi chapter is out 👀
That era Tomino is definitely an acquired taste, not what most people would really like in my experience
It's pre-Turn A Tomino, which is enough for me to say that I'd probably have a better time with just about anything else
also Brain Powerd gets thrown around, but everyone apart from one guy I've ever heard talk about it says that it's actually painful
o yeah right, Fafner _is_ still going on
yeah, RahXephon and FranXX are the main two that get thrown around; have not seen Rah, will at some point ~~probably after Raideen, that one seems both more influential and more interesting~~
Most of my association is the visuals, which even with me liking Seed's visuals, are a bit much to get into
Had that one on the radar for a while, never heard it brought up in relation to Eva tho. Interesting
It's a bit gatekeepy, but has a not entirely incorrect core point
But yeah, this old picture comes to mind for this entire convo both re:Eva and Madoka in their reception
wellthen
...
Mecha is kind of impenetrable at first, so I don't really fault anyone for not having the quite frankly unreasonable amount of context required to actually get all the shit that's going on
But it relates to my point; to someone who doesn't know what the Braves series is, that very much looks like it could be the case
I have not seen GGG yet, but yeah that one is more than a bit dubious
Eva and Madoka are both obviously massive, did a lot of things more to the point than most things before it and in doing so for better or worse changed the landscape of the genre alongside bringing in a lot of new people who didn'T previously have it on the radar as much
It's one of my pet peeves, the old people who have no idea about the genre trying to talk with authority about the genre, very much applies to both of them
yeah, exactly
(I think it was superman? Might have been another of the big hero names)
As a franchise, it made more money than Superman for a very good reason
oh yeah, it absolutely is; the ratio to how much people overstate its influence vs how much people understate its influence is not symmetrical; should have been a bit clearer about that. But much like the discussion around its themes and aesthetics, a lot of it is sort of looking in the wrong place
aww
Not that I know of
That's kinda one of the things I mean, looking at the history of mecha before it, Eva does not actually stray that far from established formula. Which is not a knock on the show, I love it to bits, but the whole "Eva is a deconstruction of mecha" thing is quite misrepresented in most online discourse
It obviously had a huge impact on pop culture, but not necessarily in the way that it is commonly said to be, at least not in Japan
It's in this strange position where it is simultaneously more and less groundbreaking and influential than people usually realize
Excellent show
yup. Got me closer to tears than any other piece of media I've watched in the last ten or so years
Easily my favorite show from last year
If you want something that will properly rip your heart out, I also recommend putting 86 - EIGHTY SIX - on there
I had like three 100% saves on both
and Batman
Complete Saga was a bit too rough around the edges for me, but I poured countless hours into 3
Never had a Vita or played the Ninjago games, but Lego games on DS were my shit
Never really got into it even at my peak Lego-ness, but I respect what it did
Had a hell of a run, that's for sure
I definitely wish there would have been more going on with her, but it's such a fascinating look into how Anno's mind works
He said that the facet of himself that he Rei draws from was pretty much fully explored after the first six episodes, so he didn't really know what to do with her from that point onwards
although the reason as per an Anno interview from a couple of years ago is quite interesting
yeah, kinda
In either case, an interesting world and story, I can see why the manga is something of a cult classic
I mean fair, but the faces are very... I don't have a positive ID on that style, but something in me wants to call it high 90s shoujou, no idea if that gut feeling is right or not
Mechanical aesthetics are incredible, humans look a bit iffy <:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
Watched the FSS movie, was alright
In fairness, IBO did have a bit of both
tru
I would not be surprised if there was a Euphie one as well tbh
ESPECIALLY not for the Nunally one
yeah no, I got nothing
Witch ep 1 good
That's the thing, ever sicne the merger, lines got blurred there a bit
Might overlap in production ressources I imagine is what kasu is getting at
Which branch is making Birdie Wing again?
that whole thing
oh yeah, right
Don't have a source at hand tho, so take that with a grain of salt
I seem to recall reading that it will air two months after the first cour has wrapped up
It's also this heavy in episode 1 of what is going to be at a least 25, more likely than not 50 episode show
Completely standalone, hasn't really shown any signs of reliance on the usual crutches of the franchise
Witch so far is about as good an intro show as they come
Man's really out there trying to create the worst horrors
But I have yet to find anyone who watched more than one or two of those before having seen at least 50% of mainline Gundam
Sure, if you by some freak accident watch those weird oneoffs as your first exposure to Gundam, you will likely be very confused and at least mildly disappointed
It's the same as like, ZZ Frag and the like
you have to _look_ for that one
yeah but like
~~apart from Victory, G Reco and Narrative, which I really would not recommend as a starting point by virtue of their general weirdness. Those very much are acquired tastes and going into those without any prior experience is probably gonna lead to a bad time~~
Maybe Zeta/ZZ/CCA and Destiny, but I've seen people start with all of those and have a good time
Only real exception being Trailblazer
yeah, unless it has S2 in its title, pretty much everything is a viable starting point
The only point of reference for a functional relationship between people was the mafia guy and his harem, so it perfectly tracks
Tbh I really respect IBO for going "actually wait, we can make this not turn into dumb infighting"
Gonna be a good time
but yeah no, Witch is looking very good, and glad to see people who aren't already into Gundam watching it
~~I mean Char and Amuro exist~~
It's so good
https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL58brFgdVYkoV2KdHeekae7OSKmIexFAX So apparently D4DJ is just on youtube officially
Like sure, you aren't gonna get every last reference, but those are not what matters
I think you are overestimating the amount of lore necessary to enjoy the story told
Pretty much any UC thing released after CCA can be watched as a first entry and you can still get like 90% out of it
nah, UC can definitely be started at other points
Missing Link Feddie story has you fight other Feddies more than Zeon, and frames the point at which you desert to join up with a Zeon battalion as the big heroic twist, while the Zeon campaign is entirely "look at these poor kids just trying to do the right thing for their country"
But shit like Missing Link is still a far worse offender, because Unicorn at least "only" both sides it instead of outright going Zeon is the good guys, fighting Feddies is what you should do
oh yeah no, Unicorn is written by an Imperial Japan apologist and it shows
OYW sidestories also cannot resist the urge to go "but what if space nazis good actually"
None of that makes Zeon any less space nazi
That's a whataboutism
Cyphwe
There'S less than 4b people involved in any of the examples we gave
point being?
Contrast and compare 0083 Zeon remnants
fucking 9/11 and all that followed
Actually yeah, Melua makes a good point
that does not stop you from having a very bad take here
Cypher please stop digging
In seven years, Weimar Germany went from having a significant chunk of communists in its parliament to Hitler being chancellor
years
Seven
no it fucking isn't my guy
I am German; I have a bit more of an insight into the politics of Nazism, because our school system made the very correct choice of focusing heavily on that to prevent that shit from happening again. Well in excess of 90% of what people say about how Zeon is actually not that bad directly mirrors the rhethorics of nazi apologists and real world hate groups. For a good reason, since Zeon were very explicitly styled after the Nazis in almost every meaningful way. They are not supposed to be the good guys, and the fact that so many people miss that is extremely concering
Cypher let me put it this way
My man you are not helping your case
OYW sidestories do the same, except while Ghiren "takes being compared to Hitler as a compliment" Zabi is still in power
That is a different beast
Zeta is seven years after the fact
Cypher most of that is Zeon whitewashing/Fed blackwashing that's coming from the very sidestories we are talking about here
Like, Missing Link at times gets uncomfortably close to the rhethoric of irl neonazis
Unicorn's politics are not great, but they are never that bad
In general X has probably my favorite treatment of newtypes and oldtypes across Gundam
Haven't seen 83 yet, but from all I gather the impression I'm getting is that Garrod in X did that plot point better
Zeon are the nazis, and trying to argue that they are not that bad is an extremely bad look
Their founding principle is explicitly übermensch bullshit
Their state flag is the nazi war flag with the swastika replaced by some squiggles
The first thing they did in the war is gas a civilian colony and use it as a WMD
I find it amusing how Delta is very clearly just magical girls and immediately two of the five idols are confirmed in love
yeah the phonic gain was a bit of a hard sell even in Frontier
yeah, the only songs that really stood out to me so far have been Diamond Crevasse, Don't be late and Ikenai Borderline apart from ops/eds
Well, partially. A lot of it comes down to the scope of the setting and the hardness of the scifi, which as I gather have always been like this from the start, and isn't that much my cup of tea
I stand corrected
I've only seen this and Frontier, so I can't really speak with any authority on Macross at large; but the vibe of the world and plot structure is similar enough between the two of them that I am relatively certain that it's decently representative of the franchise as a whole; I don't vibe with it as much as with other mecha, but I'm having a good enough time
It's interesting so far
Macross Delta
It is a subsidiary to the new BN Filmworks company that has a handful of other studios owned by Bandai under it
Sunrise still exists as an entity
they were not
They're just a subsidiary of Bandai Namco Filmworks
no, Sunrise still exists
Joke's on you, this is a Satelight show
AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
FUCKING CATEAR HELMETS
She's not the vibe that I see her in an actual relationship with Hayate long term, but they sure could use a hug from each other
Sounds like the best case tbh
6
Love me some battle buddies stuff
Also, Macross Delta; Hayate and Mirage have such a fun dynamic
Was clearly intended a joke, but 'tis the internet and one screenshot repost deep people already forgot that part
yeah, that
Ad Stella
I still hate the Crunchyroll timelines video for putting that dumb idea into people's heads that the Beginning G anno Domini and 00 anno Domini are the same
But yeah, I've heard that 2 is really far future and kinda odd in general? Or am I misremembering
oh, gotcha
NIH?
I feel like at this point I might finish Macross before I finish Gundam
OG, DYRL, 2, 7, Zero, Frontier, Delta are the ones I remember off the top of my head
How many entries are there in Mavross total again?
I don't think I'll ever get over the fact that Macross Delta's opening starts with "we only have one shot at love, so let's have fun inside of you"
Also made very funny because the op name is The Blessing
yes
||yeah, especially since the shot that Aerial blocks is completely on target||
||That read to me more as taunting, dude is so overconfident in his skills that he scatters a few shots around them before actually going for the killing shot||
The answer is no <:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
yeah, I was talking top down, is there a consistent one without false positives or false negatives
Rule of thumb is that if it's called one it probably is one, and if it isn't called one it probably isn't one, but even for that, there's exceptions
I can say backed by a lot of experience in seeing people try and fail to come up with a decisive definition: Outside of IBO and maybe G depending on one edge case, there is no definition for what is a Gundam and what isn't
Prologue, short novel and ep 1 have all hit the right spots
I am very looking forward for more
It's become one of my favorite shows, and I've been lowkey chasing the high of watching it for the first time ever since I finished it
But yeah, ultimately I like what IBO did, and a couple of misgivings about details nonwithstanding am glad it exists in its current shape
true
Perhaps "whimsical" isn't exactly the word I was looking for, but I'm at the same time lacking the word that I am looking for
If this were Turn A yeah, I'd be all over that, that would embed itself beautifully into the lore and general vibe
I can see where you're coming from, and I'd definitely like to see that show, but I don't think IBO's vibe would have worked that well with that. It feels too... whimsical, ghibli-esque for the brand of postapocalypse that PD is
If I had to come up with a post-hoc reason why it had to be exactly that many, I'd probably say something like they had the really hard to come by core components for the reactors of exactly that many and picked the name after the production schedule was drawn up
I could also imagine it being a propaganda thing, that it was apparent they didn't need that many, but rolled with it as a display of power
Granted, it's kind of a ??? thing of what they intended to do if they had realized that they needed more, but I can excuse that for the sake of rolling with the theme
So it's not a coincidence, that was in-universe done on purpose
They are explicitly named and numbered after the lesser key of solomon
Correct, they were indeed not
It was definitely there with the limiter removal stuff, sacrificing your body parts for temporary power
I'm glad it kept it as lowkey as it did, I don't think a more on the nose approach would have meshed well with the vibe of the world
But yeah, going off of what a hardcore Crossbone stan told me, the manga that B is from is not just maybe made up, but far more likely than not made up, since apparently it is very pointedly framed as ghost stories from deep space
Notably Nise and D Gundam
Well, and a couple other ones
The only one that has a fixed definition is IBO with its 72 frames
..actually yeah no, G is not nearly as close as I thought
And then there's the old Shuffle Alliance, which are clearly piloting Gundams, but are not called that
yea
It does have a Mobile Trace System, but does that count if it's not a human pilot
Is a Mobile Horse a Mobile Fighter
Also Fuunsaiki
Back when I first got into Gundam, I sent an entire discord into a seven hour long heated debate over it by asking the innocent question if Hyaku-Shiki and Tallgeese count
Gonna do some digging once I'm off work
re: Runtime for Witch
Thing I recall reading somewhere is two cours, potentially two more if it does well; don't have a source at hand for that tho
I reiterate my point about how much attention you were paying to the show
You can't take any one of them out of the story without it grinding to a halt
Kira, Athrun, Cagalli, Lacus
If you make everything about one of them, no wonder you didn't get much out of it
Seed has at minimum two, possibly four protagonist depending on your count
No use arguing against a hateboner this strong
Yeah Imma just dip
Miso with all due respect, you just admitted to having entirely forgotten about the most important part of Seed. I don't think you can really speak to the overarching quality of the show
The entire show does not make sense and loses most of its thematic value in their absence
Blitz going down and the events resulting from it are the hinge point of all of Seed
My man that's a) two episodes after the halfway point of the show and b) one of the strongest consequences of war arcs in all of Gundam
????
Kirajesus is a tired meme, and almost entirely exists because of people retroactively applying their hate for Destiny onto Seed
...did you forget the part where Kira only started his no killing policy as a direct result of suffering a rather large amount for his actions
Except the show makes a point about how that is not what defines your value as a person
Certainly a lot better than the other two no killing protags
I think Kira is on the better written end of Gundam protags, at least in Seed base
Then I suppose tastes differ
Miso have you seen Seed
Like, he's still arguably at his dumbest when ||flying defense for the WMD that he attacked some three episodes earlier, but by that point the show, while still not portraying him as shortsighted as it should, at the very paints him as wrong
And that gets a lot less annoying once the show stops pretending that he is right
He's so close to being incredibly well written, but thd amount of times he almost figures out that maybe things are not quite that black and white, only for a single sentence by Rey or Durandal to pull him back to full, unwavering Zaft loyalist is incredibly frustrating
I am of the opinion that Destiny got better once Kira took over, in equal parts because that's the time that the show stops butchering nearly every recurring character, and also because I found Shinn insufferable
LMAO END
Witch Prologue ed has cool visuals
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=If2ZWpWPeZw
I seem to recall reading leg, but same difference
So while I don't have a hard source on Destiny, given the path the show went, the reception that Shinn has (as far as I can gauge the reaction in Japan at the time; I've seen a few references to the discourse in other pieces of media discussing otaku culture that seem to indicate that he was not very popular, and the change away from him was rather welcome at the time of airing) and the popularity that both Seed and Destiny still hold in Japan, I feel relatively confident that at least part of that decision was out of writing staff's hands
Apart from... I believe it was Athrun, the entire main cast was supposed to die at the end, but they were kept alive to make Destiny happen
Seed and Destiny both had a lot of decisions imposed on them by execs, to the point where Seed's entire planned ending went out the window entirely during production because it was proving popular and Bandai wanted to keep doors open for a sequel
And I feel fairly certain in making the call that the only reason that Kira got reintroduced as the protag is because people didn't like Shinn
oh yeah, Destiny is fully not a good show, but I disagree on the reasons commonly cited for it
There is so much genuinely baffling nonsense in those novels
Design-wise yeah, but this does not come close to the sheer insanity that is Anima
I want a figure of the Trident SO BADLY, but the only thing that exists is a gimmicky SD toy that was sold on an even like 20 years ago
I imagine a lot of unhinged edgelords around
oh
do elaborate, that sounds like a a very interesting war story
👀
I got into Eva too late to ever be part of that kind of tabletop campaign ~~especially because I live in Germany where mecha is dead on principle and finding anyone who likes it is a very time-intensive task~~, but it definitely sounds like a cool thing to at least try
wise decision by all accounts
Something something why can't I just shoot the angel with my gun if I have enough ammo to do chip damage
yeah, I imagine human-scaled combat was also not a huge focus, so probably shenanigans on that end as well
Big "If **_I_** were in Shinji's place, I wouldn't CRY THIS MUCH" energy
yeah the first one tracks super hard
yeah I was just about to say, with the context of tabletop, I think I know where this is going
I am tangentially aware that it was really big at a time, but it pretty much missed me entirely
Oh, interesting
Wow that's a name I have not heard in ages
Although given the franchise we're talking about and the tone you say this in, my expectations for any given fan project are not stellar
I believe I am unaware of what fan project you are referring to
Which I blame in part on the old ADV dub cast, who have a not insignificant history of muddying the waters with dubious claims or at times outright falsehoods
I have some friends who were in from really early on, and according to them, the general state of discourse has much improved since then (to the tune of back around 2000s, it was apparently a topic of hot controversy if Yui had any degree of agenda at all in the entire show, with the majority dismissing the idea entirely), but some things like that have stuck around
But the "EoE was made out of spite" angle is rooted in a fundamental misunderstanding of the circumstances of Eva's creation by early western fans, who only got a very small and hindered by language barrier part of the picture
Like, the end of the show was not uncontroversial by any stretch of the definition; I saw a twitter thread a while ago translating fan responses in a collaborative artbook thing that released some year or so after airing, the shade thrown around in either direction was off the charts
https://wiki.evageeks.org/End_of_Evangelion_Death_Threats has a TL of all of the things shown on screen, quite a neat read
The only actual death threat was written by a close friend of Anno with the express purpose of putting it into EoE, no statement that I know of made about if there ever were any actual death threats that it paraphrased, or if it was just created out of thin air
And only two of the letters displayed in EoE are actually hate mail (or perhaps three? somewhere around that mark), the rest of it praising the show quite highly
This was well before the show did anything that would have incurred any significant amount of spite
Around the 14 episode mark if memory serves me
No, because the first drafts for EoE stood long before EoTV aired
The entire thing comes from Anno, with a very limited grasp of English at the time, responding with "too bad" at a US based convention to someone saying they didn't like the TV ending, before EoE made its way over here
Japanese reception at the time was quite positive at large
no, that's a commonly cited misconception
I've heard a lot of good things about it
fair point.
I also imagine it was a major pain in the ass to make the system work for both parties and DMs that want to focus on roleplay and other soft aspects vs those who mainly cared about the hard numbers
yeah
I don't think the way my brain engages (and more critically here, refuses to engage in some forms) with Eva as a franchise, I'd be able to play a full campaign of this, but a oneshot certainly sounds like a good time
mh yeah, I can see that
I'm a sucker for berserk super modes as a trope, but the core thing that makes them cool is the fact that they're fundamentally Not Great and the end goal is to not need them
100% is
yeah that also scans
ooooh I like that
Also out of curiosity, how many people did you get who wanted to play Jet Alone
that is appropriately terrifying
An approach that I very much agree with
yeah, it affects the expectations people have going in
I imagine that there was some sort of limit of how many attacks an angel could make per turn, so drawing aggro as a dodgetank-esque role I think could be a viable strategy to run if it bounces off of the rest of the team comp well
or the literal hundreds of thousands of guns in Tokyo-3
No ATF, so inherently a lot more flimsy and unable to directly attack the more physical angels, but hovering, very high mobility and a boatload of artillery for pinning things down while the heavy hitters do the actual damage
Going back to the Trident; I can definitely see the writing on the wall of how that would go very badly for a particular brand of players that would naturally gravitzate to "but what if guns and cool militaristic hero unit", but at the same time, I can't help but feel like done right, that could be the base for a really fun support unit
yepppp that tracks
Things happen, and the show does explain why they happen, but not so much for what purpose they happen
Feels very... unfocused, for lack of a better word
It's not bad, but I definitely liked Frontier more this many episodes in
Some two thirds of the way through Macross Delta; kinda alright so far
My first exposure to Delta was a clip of him getting insulted by a recording of Reina, so that's something to look forward to
yes <:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
eh? standard issue villain faction, gonestly kinda more interesting than the heroes since they're the ones actually making plot happen instead of just following the plot
the others
one of them so far is kinda insufferable
It's not bad by any stretch, but I can't really formulate any real take on what I think about it
That's kinda the thing for me, the info about the characters is also a bit too sparsely fed to really hook me there, either. Like, we still don't really know what the deal with three of the idols and the other two pilots; Frontier just had a lot more going on outside of the main trio than Delta had so far
if anything it was not enough ambition, its biggest fault is probably the obsessive adherence to the structure of 79-CCA at a point in the story when it should have been doing something else
I don't think too much ambition was what made Age fail
same
precisely that
yes
because of course there is
there's a really tasteless cover art of the two of them
And also Mari is there, her Eva is a werewolf and she is also a loli
Also there's three additional Rei clones, one of them is a yandere and one other a loli
But then Shinji dies after getting iced (literally, by an absolute zero frost beam) by a Rei clone who is being brain-hijacked by an autonomous Eva sent to end the world entirely if Instrumentality fails (that is later also revealed to be a previous incarnation of Shinji from the last time that Instrumentality failed), and from that point onwards the quality of the everything rapidly deteriorates
The fi4st half of the first book is kind of interesting and readable
Or Shinji dying and then getting reborn from the womb of Unit 01, only for both of them to later be reborn from the fusion of Asuka and Unit 02
Such as Unit 00 and 02 growing boobs to reflect Rei and Asuka entering puberty
It also has some..... strange takes all around
Who had also gone on record a couple years before the first volume was published that he had not actually watched the show past about a third of the way in, and judging by the series plot points that he talks about as common knowledge to the reader, but are noticeably wrong in some key elements, it is safe to say that by the time of writing still had not seen the show and based his continuation/rewrite of the ending entirely on a second hand account of what happens
It's notably written not by any member of the writing team, but by the mechanical designer
Evangelion light novel
I like unwieldy loredumps, but Anima is some of the dryest fiction I have ever read
yeah, the technobabble is REAL
and then the official translation came out and it was only insignificantly more coherent
Before the localization was announced, a friend of mine actually went to the effort of translating the first volume, and was all "I know this is really hard to read, I'm sorry, I'm just not that good at Japanese yet"
And also just incredibly hard to follow with how nonsensical some of it is
yeah
Not because it has any fundamentally appalling plot beats, but because it is just that badly written that trying to follow it just kinda has that kind of effect on you
Friend of mine felt physically sick reading the third
Speaking from experience, I own the first four volumes of it; it sucks ass
Anima is not a good place to be
Yeah I agree with Melua
It is violently uncomfortable
And sometimes just goes "but what if the entire next chapter is about Yui groping Rei"
Actually no plot veyond like chapter 2
It is
It has some fun moments here and there, but it's not good by any stretch, even ignoring the patently gross parts of it
Only other piece of Eva sidestory I've dabbled in was Shinji Ikari Raising Project, which is.... alright ep 26-style slice of life AU fluff, apart from the times when it has the entire chapter dedicated to groping
Interesting, might give that a shot some day
Campus Apocalypse
Yeah, something like that was the name
Oh right
Was it Angelic Days or is that the other one
I know the one you're talking about, blanking on the name
It's a manga about the kids being Gamers™️ with all the hallmarks of a bad abridged series, and the only manga I have ever regret the purchase of
That dubious honor goes to the manga by the name of Legend of the piko piko high school students
It is not the worst piece of officially licensed Eva material I have read
But somehow, in spite of all of that
Yeah. Also probably the best design
It'S not a pleasant experience, I can tell you that much
trainwreck is definitely the right term
oh and it also ends with ||none of the problems solved, the endless cycle of moon turning into earth for the next attempt at human life and instrumentality enforced by the autonomous Eva that is actually the last incarnation of Shinji and his harem of two more Evas that are past Asuka and Rei still in effect completely unbroken, Earth borderline uninhabitable from having shrunken so much and the final sentence of the final book is, and I quote "And then, they had their work cut out for them"||
welcome to anima
The story on multiple occasions just openly contradicts itself like that
I swear this does not make more sense in context
And also Unit 01 at one point stopped time fractions of a second before third impact and required everyone in Class 3-A to go to a weird hybrid of the school from the anime and the school that Yui's soul (who I think at this point is not even in Unit 01 anymore?) that is superimposed over the entirely wrecked irl area for Shinji to astral project into ~~because he is fully Unit 01 at this point and everything in human shape is just that~~ to avoid him waking up, because for some reason that would resume time, and everyone keeps it up even after it has stopped being necessary and there is no need to go to the classroom with an entry plug in it that Shinji does not need, except apparently he does need it
oh and also there's two Kaworus, one of them is evil and entirely a figment of Shinji's imagination, and the source of life is a literal garden of Eden floating opposite to the sun from where Earth is, and those two concepts are related in some fashion that I do not remember not care to look up again
And there's some claims around that it started as Yamashita (mechanical designer for the show and author of anima) making up lore for kitbashes in a modelling magazine and only after the fact was turned into a full story, which sounds plausible and does line up with some magazine scans I've seen, but I could never find anything conclusive on that, so take that with a grain of salt
none of the original writing staff had any involvement in it
have That Shot from the ending in gif form

jesus christ this episode jumped the shark
yeah after this episode I think I'm done for the day
I refuse to believe that that is not a retcon
that HAS to be a retcon
wait what who where.
Dude is now claiming that (I assume probably the biggest song in SDF) was actually a protoculture artifact from half a million years ago
Delta please stop trying to make the rule of cool dramatic scene powerups into something other than that
Because I'm counting two so far
Okay how much of that """loredump""" that totally not a racist stereotype man is giving is just a blatant retcon
I don't dislike Delta so far, but I think after I finish it I'm gonna take a break from Macross for a while
Honestly I could get behind those more than fold bacteria that live in your brain and make you remote-controllable by a little boy singing
But yeah, as egregious as Frontier got with its music newtypes at times, it was definitely more graceful about it than Delta
the show is also currently trying to retcon what I understand was The Big Moment of SDF to akshually have been magic all along, which I don't think I like
yeah, that
I'm not sure if this is better or worse than Frontier's ||the Vajra hace evolved to be immune to nukes now|| moment, but Delta sure just did a thing
...yeah, that's quite enough of that for today
Age 2 does spend a fair bit of its beginning runtime at school, and actually does it fairly well, for whatever that's worth
How the fuck do you recover from cyberpsychosis to a degree where you are trusted with the highest end of spec ops
but yeah, like
just that those tend to do a lot of crime
in no small part because of the logistics of how that works in the first place
oh that is fascinating
the bit at the very start of "holy fuck, this dude has military grade implants" - "what, so do we" was SO GOOD
MaxTac was probably my favorite part of the show in general; they carry so many little details of lore in the little screentime that they do have
||Especially Rebecca's death mostly just left me with a "what, that was it?" rather than any actual pain||
||oh no, I'm not talking about David winning; but the defeat was too quick and easy to really feel like the kind of struggle that makes a doomed last stand like that really work for me||
no, the characters just didn't vibe with me
Only real gripe I have is ||the final battle not having the oomph in its execution that it deserved||
It didn't click with me, but it's definitely a really well-made show
Age-2 as a standalone I'd put fairly high on a ranking of Gundam shows. Not exactly outstanding, but it sticks to its guns and does it well
definitely
PRetty well made, too
the show spends like two or three episodes there
Probably the most well known one is the one where... I think it was Tsurumaki, but could be wrong, says something about Eva not being made to convey a religious message and they chose it just for the aesthetics, which very frequently gets misquoted as the religious symbolism carrying no in-universe meaning, when given a good translation and not cutting away the rest of the interview to cherrypick that one line, it's much more along the lines of Eva not being made for the purpose of commenting on any real world beliefs and the people following them
The one piece of advice I can give is to treat any claim that comes from the old ADV dubbing cast or screenshots of a subbed interview that reads overly keen on brushing away thematic depth with a massive grain of salt, since both of those tend to be ripped from context (and in the case of the interviews often translated by self-taught speakers who will miss crucial connotations), or at times are outright fabrications <@331908049822547978>
I genuinely do not know any single place to go for getting actually good information, unless you already know the specific subset of questions you're looking for and know the people who have poured hours into it that can point you the right way and distinguish between what is commonly accepted and what is actually correct
Coverage of Eva's production is notoriously patchy and riddled with blatant misinformation that is commonly cited and accepted as fact
in the forbidden scriptures of the abyss, probably
um
lol, lmao
I was just about to say
I'm not sure if this blurb is in-universe propaganda or an authorial sweetspot showing through, because that sounds entirely too benevolent for the world of Cyberpunk
I mean yeah, but David was by all accounts a special case. But yeah, in either case an interesting choice, and I think I prefer it over any attempt at handwaving it with more tech
How do you go from cyberpsychosis to that
yeah, but still, they're pretty firmly sane  and can be relied on to follow orders is what I'm getting at more
weebs are slowly infiltrating the world's governments
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
https://twitter.com/USCPSC/status/1580215261164019714
very nice!
Gonna get myself one the minute I finish Zeta, which... at the current rate could take a while
That thing is sexy
RG Zeta on the other hand
It's too narrow
yeah, the new Ver.Ka looks kinda jank
Although I don't think anything will ever beat the Phoenix Wright livetweet sequence of "Big booba?" - "OH NO" in reaction to ||1-1 and 1-2||
I will never tire of seeing people's live reactions to their first Gundam show
I assume Megaroad 1 is a known name
heh, cheeky op 1 arrangement
he's gonna do the thing from like ep 2 again isn't he
Man, Delta gets so close to being really in the flow so many times, but it always ends up tripping over itself
Please, you have something going with the everything else, just ease off on the magic
Delta, dear, stop
...aaaaaand they're doing a ||Shem-Ha||
I wish that Delta had gone a lot more into Makina's and Reina's past beyond ||they heard a really good song that one time and suddenly gay||
Mirage is so done with Hayate and Freya's bullshit <:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
I am aware of how they go
I've built multiple
I'm a careful builder, know the common pitfalls of the RG Zeta and trust myself to recognize a wonky joint when I see one, so I am not concerned over how mine will turn out eventually
I did figurepainting and watched a shitton of military model content long before I got into Gunpla; nothing that Bandai has ever released is a worse experience or more fiddly than what at the end of the day is an average armor kit
I do not believe in its reputation, because the majority of it comes from people who have never built it parroting Mechagaikotsu, a man who at the time was an awful builder, but is charismatic and has high production value, so it stuck
I am well aware of its reputation
And while there's no confirmed gae, there are definitely yuri vibes
The anime is actually quite fun
oh yeah, I've seen someone talk about that somewhere, sounded very weird
but well, that makes it easy
I could have sworn hearing people talk about them as if there's like three or four
Only two?
How many movies are there again?
yeah, I definitely don't regret the time spent
the first bit is kinda unfocused and doesn't really know where it's going, the last couple of episodes do know where they're going, but they're so excited about it that the dialogue trips over itself a lot of the time. Apart from the one episode that set the new record for highest number of dubious retcons I've seen in a single episode, I didn't dislike any of it, but on the whole, Frontier certainly stuck the landing better
It's an odd case
okay, finished
called it, Keith was ||too cool to stay evil, too cool to live, and stabbed Roid in the end||
...wait this is just the vajra plot all over again
I think my favorite use of stock footage was The Sequence in Penguindrum
nah
||tbh I'd chalk that one up to it being an animation oversight, someone just using the default effect without having been told the lore||
It also contains the one thing that I will vehemently fight Anno on, the notion that Victory Gundam is good
The person running it sadly stopped updating it, so it's missing a lot of stuff that came out or was translated later, but what is there is quite insightful in its own right
It's a compilation of a shitton of interviews and production materials, up until like 2008ish
You'll probably need more than one night
https://www.gwern.net/otaku <@331908049822547978> You asked about Eva production stuff some time ago; this was brought up in one of my places, and I have it on good authority of The Person Who Knows More About Eva Than Anyone Else I Ever Talked To that it's mostly quite accurate
It's definitely a show not for everyone
It's not as egregious as the F91's afterimages, but it gets close
Mirage Colloid is.... I'd put it somewhere around the second or third dumbest piece of tech in Gundam
and yeah, Blitz arm was neat
I think I'm with Melua on this one, the thematic implications of it are just a bit too icky
Not sure you want anything to do with that money
that seems like a not great premise given that the Sahakus were just a cartel
yeah that uh
God I don't think I'll ever be over the plot in X Astray where she still has a full hateboner for Lowe and is actively planning to murder him, but lets him use her production facilities free of charge without getting any data out of it just because "he's interesting"
yeah that tracks
That's a sentence I did not expect to read in this context, but I'll take it
ffs Astray
oh right, Gina was the one who dies
Sahaku, not Sayaku
The dude who died at the end of vanilla Astray
Mina as in Mina Rondo Sayaku
wait
how bad is it gonna be
I have never looked into Princess of the Sky
o boy
oh no, the Mina is the better looking of the two, no disagreement
White and yellow don't, but I am partial to white and gold
1:1 same design, apart from one color swap
Not just basically, it is
the white is a nice touch
Although I do also like the Hana
yeah
Astray should have anded at Destiny Astray at the very latest
yes, even compared by the other thing from the same story
It's overdesigned even by the standards of Astray
I don't like the Amaterasu
Especially since everything he does that is commonly cited as "fixing" Seed's plotholes is actually creating far more questions if you think about it ever so briefly
Lowe's I cannot
Gai's plotlines I can excuse since those mostly make sense
It does a thing that I personally really detest in trying to oneup the source material and make itself relevant to everything, in a way that comes off as very "don't look at the main story, I am MUCH COOLER" and it strains my suspension of disbelief far beyond breaking point that some jackass war profiteer is supposed to be more central to the world's workings than the people front and center to the main war
But yeah, vs is particularily egregious in its designs
I'd raise that to everything in Astray period, at least as far as the plot goes
...do you mean to tell me that there is _yet another one_
I'm talking about the Nix Providence, which is also an atrocity, but for different reasons
Mirage?
technically two of note since ||Prayer gets memorycloned with even worse clone disease in... was it Frame Astrays? The one with Librarian Works||
Like, in the original airing of... I believe it was ep 23, but could be off by one or two to either side, there's a couple of frames where the Impulse fully turns into the Strike
Seed and especially Destiny have SO MANY visual errors it's honestly the best explanation for a lot of strange things
yeah, Resurrection is fun
The scene was uncomfortable on purpose, because Nina is not a well-adjusted individual
And I'd argue that dropping the table scene also makes Nina's arc a lot weaker, since we never get to see that obsession that then paints everything she does going forwards
||ah yes, retcon a single character death by... cutting out every arc that character was relevant in||
yeah no, the Geass mopvies are trash
yeah, heard something to that tune as well
wow get WRECKED Mirage
Because he's kinda in too deep as far as Macross goes, so I don't 100% trust his opinions on it
Is that at all true
Also Resident Macross Person on another place of mine insists that the Frontier movies are absolutely required for Zettai Live
if the base show has a lot of unnecessary crap in it, the comp movie can be better
yeah that seems like the one condition
Legit have not seen a single one that was even just equal to the show on the whole
Bar 0079
When are compilation movies ever good tbh
...yeah just gonna file that one under comp movies I'm never watching
In absence of that, what is left
||I mean yes, but like, that !nuke was most of the casus belli and the core of Hayate's arc||
I'm also being told that apparently the Frontier compilation/alt timeline movie is required for this?
I have indeed noticed
like, if not that, what was the point of the conflict
Dare I ask what the point of it is, then
.....
Zettai Live that's a lie and you know it
Ore wa molcar da
https://twitter.com/molcar_anime/status/1581193286017896450 ummmmmmm
Political drama more so than political thriller
I would not say that "thriller" is the right descriptor for it
CB felt like kind of a doormat organization for a long stretch of it
The thing that drove me up a wall tho was the endless The Plan™️ and the equally endless not actually doing anything that mattered
It definitely does some interesting things, yeah
Just kinda have to know that the first 15ish episodes depending on your taste might be a bit of a drag
I found most of S1 to be very frustrating to watch for a handful of reasons, but the end of it and S2 were really fun, so I'd still say worth it
It brings me pain that the only full lineup of the Delta squad that exists in battroid mode is the Bandai DX line, which is both entirely too big for the amount of shelf space I can justify giving it, and also cost 200 bucks each
Ending got its act together well enough, but what the hell were the 80% before that
well that sure was a movie that existed
throwing a lot of shit at the wall and hoping that some of it sticks is not a good approach to writing a movie
fucking hell Zettai Live
...............
We were robbed by ||Kallen's crying scene being cut completely||
Although I will say
also ||Kallen and Suzaku on the same side||, so that was fun to watch
Do wish the ||timeline reset compilation|| was a lot longer tho, missed opportunity to actually show off Lelouch being smart instead of just telling us how smart he is
It's not particularily _good_, but I enjoyed it for what it was
I assume so, only the likes of Ghiren would take being compared to Patrick Zala as a good thing <:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
||you joke, but someone on one of my places is dead convinced that she's actually Eri, and Suletta is Eri's child, based solely on the fact that the Benerrit group chairmen look older than they would normally after 12 years compared to their Prologue designs||
||Like, who esle was it gonna be||
||I mean it'S hardly a mystery even to those who have never heard of Tempest, either||
I kinda don't want to read any of the sequels lmao, I'm not sure you can follow that story up meaningfully without lowkey making the whole thing worse
Tobia and Garrod would be best friends
yeah, he's pretty good
in unrelated affairs; I read the og Crossbone manga earlier, was a lot better than I expected it to be
yeah, K&M as far as I've watched it a million years ago was definitely one of the better isekais out there
also god that ||"...eh!?" at the end just SENDS ME||
New Witch ep was fun
Touya I really don't think that you know what you're talking about here
That doesn't really track
You say SD Gundam is more than the base works, based on the fact that you didn't see those?
Touya I'm not sure what you're getting at here
Crossrays and Battle Alliance
Been meaning to watch it for a while, heard it's actually quite competent
My threshold for above waterline here is "you may have heard of this before if you're not into Gundam", which it just isn't
yeah no, SDGF isn't going above
fuck it, I still have the thing open, I can edit
oh right, it did
I eyeballed all of these based solely on how much I've seen them talked about in Gundam-adjacent circles
There's a couple of decently well known sidestories, but they quickly devolve into random nonsense
yeah, if you know more than three things below second tier under the waterline, you're already in too deep kinda
in the bottom three tiers, there's like two things that have any form of translation
also yeah, most of these have barely any coverage of them, much less a translation
as for doozybots; I know where you're coming from, but I've seen it memed enough that some of my mutuals who otherwise have no idea about Gundam are familiar with the name, which was kinda my bar here
I made it specifically sidestories only, which all of these are, even if some on a technicality
I spent a frankly embarrassing amount of time making this nonsense
~~RG Unicorn who?~~
And tbh, I'll take a partsformer with solid modes over a fully transforming one that doesn't really deliver on either
Yeah, very much hoping they'll make the Frontier squad as well
ye
Hourglass mecha, sharp angles and large backpacks are very much my vibe
I like the mechanical design in general
I am quite fond of the fight choreography as well; footage reuse aside, it is good footage for the most part
But on the whole yeah, I hesitate to recommend Seed even if at the end of the day I do put it in the better third of Gundam shows
I do think that just episodes 29 and 30 alone make the entire 10 before worth it, that is one of the strongest episode pairs of any Gundam show I've seen
yeah, no disagreement there
It's a weirdly valid way of watching the show, there's genuinely not a lot that you miss out on a ton of stuff by skipping most of the early show
but yeah, Seed's main fault is the pacing; I'Ve watched it with some friends before, we skipped pretty much straight to ep 20ish, only watching two or three key episodes before that
I found the quota battles with no real stakes far more egregious than the footage reuse, but those don't help
||Blitz going down|| to ||battle of Josh-A|| might be my favorite war is hell arc in the franchise
exactly
I wouldn't recommend it as an entry point since you kinda need to have an expectation of what to look forward to to not understandably drop it before it gets good, but when it has its act together, it has what it takes to be one of the greats
The first third is a slog, but it really picks up after that
tbh Seed base is pretty decent
Keeps things running smoothly without taking away the time and attention if someone on fighting staff
Technically part of every soldier's individual duty or some get assigned to do it, but noone in the military is gonna complain about not having to keep track of another thing
General housekeeping, I'd assume
~~I dunno, Asumi-chan has a lot of action~~
My main animewhen for yuri things is Asumi-chan, but I doubt that's ever gonna happen <:Ver:704169051391524875>
They're obnoxious even by the standards of vocal Gundam fanbases
Just stay the **FUCK** away from its vocal fanbase
I'm camp love it, but I know a lot of people who did not have a good time with it
IBO is very love it or hate it depending on personal taste
Glemy Toto, named after the toilet brand
or like
I also recall reading that apparently the original ZZ draft included a dude named Elbow Smash
also shoutouts to the dude in... was it Brain Powerd? who is just called Shot Weapon
South Burning
Bring Stabity
Ah yes
No kids on Folkvangr, and no kids/teens on Mercury
As by the prequel mini-novel, she did not meet anyone her age for her entire life
I pity people who have to animate spiders
probably that, yeah
I gotta watch Revue some day, it looks really interesting
I have not seen any of those three shows, cut me some slack <:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
But if you are in the mood for that, it's incredible
With the caveat that it is a lot of pain and suffering, so if you aren't in the mood for that, steer clear
Favorite show of last year
86
Akiba Maid War you mean?
There's still a difference between Gundam Name and borderline orientalisms like that one
I mean
Been my general impression, yeah
Oh hey it's the LycoReco sequel we all were yelling for
But not least of which o god movement cycle
For a lot of reasons
And the vibe is immaculate, which is the most important part here
It's nothing groundbreaking and one of the plots is a bit odd, but nothing in it is below "it exists"
But it also just kinda holds up as a story
They nailed organic textures out the park
I mean the technical side is incredible
And it's actually pretty decent
||Chuchu going ballistic felt SO GOOD||
I don't think the older look needs to be adhered to
If we're talking heels on everything, the designer you're looking for is Nagano, or Washio if we wanna stick to modern Gundam
mild heels are just how Gundam looks now, it's not a Gyoubu thing
because that style of feet hasn't substantially been a thing ouside of retreading early UC since like 25 years ago
nor do any of the Astaroths, since you brought those up
None of these have particularily pronounced heels

if you look at his other stuff, not so much
the Moon/Varguil is one example
Gyoubu designs are more defined by their round or hexagonal shapes and large amount of large panel lines rather than heels or the artstyle of his sketches
not really
🤨
And Inata is one of the main Armored Core designers, same thing
Did a bunch of stuff for IBO and G Reco, so yeah, gonna look similar
I mean, Gyoubu gonna Gyoubu
The op shows her right after Delling, it's very not subtle
also yeah, Elenora is 100% gonna be one of the main villains in the end
I did not know Another was anything other than the series, huh
HOLY FUCK

Sgukufuku is definitely my fave of the ones I've heard from this seaspn

Halfway through that video and I'm not positive that person understands what made Madoka work
Both material cost and time investment are just below prohibitively large, so the temptation is definitely there
If I wasn't working full time, I'd seriously consider sacrificing a Shinkiro to make it
That thing looks so cool, but is the only of the three mains that is stuck in no figure limbo
~~nah, the best part of the movie is the Mahoroba not getting a Robot Damashii. Bandai, why do you hate me personally~~
lel
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
If anything, the politics of Fukkatsu is seeing that at work
CG never did a Gundam Winf and pretended that war was just over by itself, the end of the show very much drove at the new status quo having to be maintained by responsible, good faith actors
I'm saying that the military industrial complex is a driving force behind a lot of wars, and that Fukkatsu's depiction of a country run by one starting a war is very much a realistic scenario
That is not what I am saying
?
But the rest is pretty decent
The main problem I have with the movie is that the big battle just doesn't have the screentime to show Lelouch's mind at work, only the results of it
It makes sense that a country whose main source of income is war profits would not be too thrilled about world peace
That part has proper groundwork
Went to shit because of the mercenaries
yes but like
I mean
But I don't think it's nearly as bad as you make it out to be
Lelouch is definitely one of the weaker parts of Fukkatsu, yeah
Or should I just stick with the game if I want to give the franchise a shot
Anyone know if the Demonbane anime is any good?
Fair, there is a difference between the popularity of a franchise and the popularity of the genre at large that the franchise is rooted in
The video definitely has a good core point, but it could have used a proofreading pass by someone more deeply involved in the genres discussed
Well, and obviously ignoring the fact that there were still more traditional in tone magical girl shows produced after Madoka, but I don't need to say that on a Symphogear server lol
The one that sticks out to me the most is the notion that idol shows were not really popular before the late 2000s, when especially Macross came way earlier and was, as far as I have looked into its pre-Frontier history, very much consistently successful on the premise of its idols
although I still think that the person writing it has some rather major blind spots that hurt the final product overall
it did get better, yeah
so far all I'm getting is change=bad, but if you say it gets better, I shall keep watching
which... is in line with their very clear lack of understanding of Watchmen's position in the history of super heroes and the throwaway line about mecha that also strikes the same chord
||I expect him to be the boss at the end of one of the cours, probably once the inevitable corpo war is actually gonna start||
Witch 5
||Elan is piloting a Psyco Gundam-colored unit, has artificial brain powers and is test subject number _Four_. No way in fuck is he making it to the end of the show||
I mean
But the derivatives of the Forbidden that use the same mechanics don't acronym to Gundam, so not even the OS rule holds
well they have a variation on it
nope, Akatsuki doesn't have that
Every other timeline is not
IBO is consistent
all but one
wonderful quote from one of my places in response to that scene
-ZAFT engineers before the raid on Heliopolis, probably
Almost like it's a patchwork of hundreds of stories written by almost as many people over the span of four decades, a lot of it with very loose supervision <:Ver:704169051391524875>
and then the QanT is a Gundam again, except in the sources where it isn't
Although probably the funniest piece of this whole debate is the fact that as by official lore, the 00 Gundam stops being a Gundam when it equips the 0 Raiser, because the 00 Raiser has surpassed the concept of a Gundam
And all because I asked for the sake of making a shitpost if people considered the Tallgeese and Hyaku-Shiki Gundams
also the debate eventually turned into a back and forth on if the Byarlant's antennae were v-shaped enough to count as a v-fin lol
and the victory is not even a limited production unit, so there goes the singular factor that was otherwise constant
yep
Six hours of people yelling about v-fins and, among others, proposals for definitions that would, not have counted most RX-78s as a Gundam
Ash rest assured that you are probably never going to beat the utter shitshow that the time I asked that queation way back when I first got into Gundam devolved into
And for the opposite example, Nise Gundam
Also Gerbera Tetra
Precisely my point. Outside of IBO, there is no metric that does not have false positives and false negatives, even the naming scheme one
And yet, it canonically is one
Is a Gundam, doesn't say so on the box
Blue Destiny
This was some three or four years ago on an at the time semi-closed invite server
You weren't
Not as good as OG Crossbone, but still a solid story
Is alright
Finished Steel 7
yeah, novel is short and pretty cool
I have misread the message yoz were replying ti
on no, not disagreeing, I just didn't remember the timeline of events
I don't remember
Did they even change it to that or was it just announced as that to begin with
And especially since the recap isn't gonna replace any episode, just push it back by a week, I feel it's kinda disingenuous to call anything it has going on a glaring issue
Witch is still one of the best looking Gundam shows to date, regardless of what production issues may or may not exist
^
oh hey same timezone lmao
I'm not convinced we are talking about the same thing here, I'm tired and about to go to bed, so if we aren't just ignore me
So calling any issues the production might have "glaring", which was my original point, is a massive overstatement
Witch, so far, is a very good looking and well paced show, and no amount of um akshually they used this one trick here that saves work changes that fact
If you at any point later in time watch the show, it will be as if that episode never even existed
As Ardania says, the show itself is not showing any signs of dropping in quality, and if you step outside of the frame of seasonal watching, that special episode immediately begins to lose its relevance
If you are even a week behind, it will become irrelevant
this is a separate listing from the main show, not affecting the runtime
And also like
^^^^^^^^^^ this
Especiually with how smug you act about it
Like oh, you're not paying close attention to weird production staff details, you have no idea about the show and should just shut up
It also comes off as really dickish and gatekeepy tbh
...you say that as if most people pay any attention to the credits and not watch mostly the visuals or use the time to talk about the episode
But you gotta recognize when you lose your frame of reference over hyperspecialization
I fet that this side of production is your thing and you have Opinions about it
If you need to deep dive into the staff listings to figure out that something isn't going as it should, that is not a visible issue
Especially not since that has been what you've been saying since before ep 1 came out, presumably on the same grounds
Millhi, with all due respect, you are in too deep here. Counting key animators is not something that falls under visible production issues
I am saying visible in the ginal product
Lke I get what Millhi means, but at the same time, I can't help but feel like the visibility of the issues is massively overstated
I had something like that in the back of my head, but could not for the life of me remember it
Fuck that's funny
OH THAT'S THE JOKE THERE
This amuses me greatly

Just watch the things that you actually want to watch, not the ones that you feel like you have an obligation to watch
I tried it with Gundam, and at this point the prospect of slogging through another Tomino show is so low that just about any other entry on my watchlist is more appealing
Honestly, don't push yourself trying to meet some arbitrary watch goal
Appleseed 2003 is the root of a solid third of my tastes in media today, so it's almost certain to be up my alley
I really should watch GitS, by all indicators I have I think I will really like it
Amakusa shows up again in Steel 7, but without Amuro brain
Skullheart
How is Skullheart this painfully mid
Crossbone was so good and Steel 7 still pulled its weight
||I am 99.x% sure that Eri is inside Aerial, and Suletta is.... well, something or other, either a clone or a biological daughter||
||That's the thing, the dates don't line up. If "the thing 21 years ago" was Folkvangr, as it can pretty much only be, there is an 8 year gap; Eri was 4, Suletta is 17. That's a 13 year difference, not 21 years||
||Her tone of boice and face when "complaining" about Suletta was so cute. She's really warming up to her||
Welcome to The Ride, Sam
Also ||Miorine's tone and face when she complained about Suletta, and the "I'm an understanding bride, I can forgive some light two-timing"
She is so on board with being Suletta's fiance <:MikuCute:672908542763859968>||
That has to be it tbh
Yeah
||Wait fuck is that why it's called Aerial? Eri-L, as in Eri-Lfrith||
||Also hard confirmation that Suletta != Eri and Aerial going Unit 01 on Pharact||
Witch
||Hot damn, shit got REAL this episode. I was fully expecting Elan to die, but not like that, nor that quickly.||
||that was my precise thought during the whole Elan/Suletta exvhange||
Just kept intentionally vague
I'm very certain that this was supposed to mean ||"21 year old incident", or something to that tune||
I don't think that's the entire sentence there, she was cut off
||"I trust my darling daughter"
SHE WASN'T TALKING ABOUT SULETTA. She's talking about Eri as Aerial's control system||
WAIT FUCK
I'm not convinced; Age is 10 years atgo by now, we had multple successful show runs since then
I think it'S more likely the other way around; Sunrise has reason to believe that a new Gundam show will do well, so plan for 50 episodes, but for the time only announce 25 on the off chance that it doesn't
And looking at the precedent of other Gundam shows, if the ending allows for it, it might even get a sequel movie
24-26 confirmed (two cours, exact number not announced), another two cours not confirmed, but given how much money the show makes more likely than not
||Might not take that form exactly, but that will be a thing||
||Oh Suletta is definitely gonna be confronted with the fact that Elenora was just using her as a pawn||
That honor goes to the protagonists causing a genocide because they are too stupid to say that the warcrimes ship is not theirs
and some fucking how, the pseudo-consensual rape scene was not the dumbest thing about Valvrave
yes, it is horrendous
And a twist that does that while in the process kills a better plot point and throws its corpse into the sea does make the show worse
Have you seen Valvrave
yeeeeaaaaaa
||Theory on one of my places is that Eri got sucked into Aerial, and Suletta is Eri's now soul- and memoryless husk having developed into a new person. I don't think I buy it, but it's interesting to think about||
||I mean yeah, but from a narrative point; this would be a very dubious decision to put in all of these hints and misdirections if there wasn't more to it||
I don't think so; so far, the writing has been too competent on the setup and delivery for the show to call its first episode The Witch and the Bride and not do anything with that
During my first watch of gear, I joked about the promise to see the shooting stars being fulfilled by burning up during atmospheric entry together, and how that would not feel out of place in Gundam; especially with Miorine's wish of going to Earth, I'm not going to categorically rule that out as a kind of oh yeah, sure we died, but we stuck it to the adults real good, go out on our own terms and _technically_ have our wish fulfilled in the process
yeah, not at all
Not without precedent
||looks over at IBO||
I meeeeeeaaaaaaaaan

That was one of my first thoughts seeing this scene 💀
Sam I am going to rearrange your bones in alphabetical order
And someone on staff tweeted about that fact before the ep went live
Probably Thunderbolt S1
WELCOME TO THE GUNDAM EXPERIENCE SAM
I might at some point try to watch Go, I find the design interesting, but at the same time the last time I watched a 50 episode show because I liked one design was Victory with the V2AB, and that went POORLY
I should read the manga some day
Very fair points lol
I'd put it somewhere around the same mark as Genocyber, thinking about it
It's not incredible, peak fiction, 10/10, but it hits that good zone of a fun show that I wouldn't mind watching again with a friend some time
You would indeed be correct, I did use the term wrong there
But yeah, of the three I watched and one (Arc) I dropped; Armageddon was the only one that I liked
that is fair, I was using the term in the strictest sense
I thought only the original and Arc were actual adaptations, and everything else falls in the zone of not actually related to the source story
I vibed with it pretty well; it does enough interesting things to keep me engaged
~~to be fair as I gather there's only like two actual adaptations~~
SKL and Armageddon were really fun, everything else I've seen of Getter or Mazinger had good visuals, but the show itself was kinda painful
but yeah, like
Gonna put it on The List™️
...I completely forgot about shin's existence
a bit, yeah
Like sure, SKL has good action and all, but the thing I like about it the most is the fact that it makes a set of main characters that by all indication should have been insufferable actualy fun to watch and more than just a cardboard that cut itself out by the powers of its own edge
It's short and self-contained without feeling like franchise for the sake of franchise, and it has similar unhinged asshole pilots as New, but unlike New, you get the feeling that those two actually care for each other's wellbeing behind all the shittalk and rage, unlike the pilots in New that at any point in time just feel like they only want to murder the other two and get on with their lives
I admittedly have not seen a ton of Mazinger content (tried base Mazinkaiser, found the pacing unbearable and was told that this was effectively the standard for the franchise, so I have no interest in the rest, recommendations of "this one is different" nonwithstanding), but I did dabble in a fair share of Getter; and I feel like SKL is everything that New and Shin vs Neo try to be
Although ironically, the reason I liked SKL in particular is almost the opposite of what the aesthetics would make one think
...there definitely is
I think SKL is the only Mazinger property I ever consumed that I didn't actively dislike, so I'm grateful for its existence lol

No individual element of it is particularily groundbreaking, but the artstyle just really works for the aesthetic of the setting

Of the few ones I've read, Gundam Burai was unexpectedly pretty up there
...Ovari, sure
O boy, Ovari on character design
As for who I talk to; the same kind of people whose hill to die on is that Mazinger Zero is the best mecha story because the protagonist machine is god. So I don't precisely take their word with any less than a barrel full of salt, but they were the only point of reference that I havem and have historically not been so consistently wrong that I can automatically file any recommendation of theirs under trash garbage
yea guess I'm not watching the Cybuster show
...wow
I'm asking because I genuinely want to know if it actually is that bad
I know next to nothing about either show, only that like two of my mutuals like the Cybuster show
I don't follow
That bad? (Although I've heard decent things about the Cybuster show)
this looks like Zuko is thinking of the North Water Tribe
In no small part because OSP Red really likes specifically all the ones I listed and also that one and her tastes in media appear to be very similar to mine by enlarge, so I have good reason to believe I am going to like it <:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
Actually yeah, Batman Beyond is one I do need to watch
~~but yeah ultimately I still am a 1999 baby~~
Brave and the Bold, Justice League, X-Men Evolution, Earth's Mightiest Heroes and Spectatular Spiderman are like 90% of superhero media I have consumed to this day and I don't think I have any intent of changing that
same, although I started watching TV at the time someone five years younger than me would under other circumstances
He also voices the big bad in one of my favorite games, but unfortunately the English voicetrack for it sucks ass, so rip <:MahiruOmegaLul:1011309472255332403>
yeah, it's nuts how good a villain voice Mark Hamill has
Oh and Penguindrum is also up there depending on my mood that day
After finishing Eva and IBO I was noticeably offkey for a week following it, and I've lowkey been chasing that high ever since
For me a 10 means that it had a lasting emotional impact on me
~~spot the odd one out~~
My 10s are, in no particular order, Eva, Code Geass, Gundam IBO, Grave of the Fireflies, 86, Symphogear S1, Madoka and S1/S3 of Highschool DxD
my biggest complaint with it is just an actual nitpick
S2 is still pretty damn good, but S1 is straightup perfection. The only thing I would change about it is actually giving the different squads different armaments according to their role
yeah
86 and Madoka come to mind ~~even tho 86 finale isn't the end of the story~~
I suppose there are a couple shows whose finale elevated what was already a good show
Although that was more like the last third of the show rather than just the finale
same
But I like media that makes me think, so that was right down my alley
It's definitely not a show for everyone
<:TBDzoomie:886746502570057738>
wat
.....
final ep massively pushes up the overall score for either of them
Gunbuster and Diebuster both
o shit right, I completely forgot
yeah, I can imagine that being real good like that
If we're counting things that are not anime, but wear their inspirations on their sleeve, Pacific Rim is a 10/10 movie and I will not hear otherwise <:GenjuroLaugh:689563633516150872>
Kio uses FX burst like twice, and only in really high stakes moments; he probably did yell there,  yeah
And Age-2 as the standalone it can easily be watched as is just unequivocally good
As much of a slog as everything after the Kionapping is, I'd rather watch that over an equal amount of Wing, G Reco, Victory, Destiny or Try
Also tbh even with the botched last arc, Age is still better than a good quarter of Gundam shows
My memories on lqte Age are spotty, but I do not recall Kio yelling a lot
I'm gonna go back to it at some point, but Divers is one of the few shows I ever cold dropped
if you ask 500 people to rank all Gundam shows, you will get 500 different lists
I'm used to it lol
ReRise is just one of the best Gundam shows in general
Kämpfer vs K9
Qubeley Papillon
are you for real
.......
Let me put it this way: Domon does not announce every single punch he throws
Try just presses the special move button and wins
Fighters used actual tactics to win fights depending on the situation at hand
the paint vulcan
regular old punching
beam saber
beam rifle
it still had normal attacks
It takes away what should be a cool moment by oversaturating it so much that it ends up being mundane, except with a kid yelling
Kamiki in the most literal sense of the word never once performs an attack that is not a special move
my point is that Fighters had things besides the Build Knuckle
he just does special moves harder
no
And then the one time he fights someone who tells him to his face that special moves won't work on him, you think haha, now is when he learns to not do special moves and wins by his skill and thinking
Kamiki in the most literal sense of the word only does special moves, which is grating enough
Especially Denial was awful, and that was supposed to be one of the big, impressive ones
also a lot of the fights just weren't good
but one of them has heart and understands the people it's trying to sell to, and the other simply doesn't
of course, they're both plastic robot ads
Meanwhile Try actively refuses to make Kamiki care about Gundam, to the point of backpaddling the times that he did, because Reiji didn't know Gundam at first and Reiji is popular, so clearly that's the part that worked
That's not what I'm talking about here; Fighters always circles back to people liking Gundam, which is the point of the show. It's a look into an idealized, healthy kind of fan culture, and it carries that enthusiasm over. You care about the kits and the tournament because Sei cares about the kits and the tournament, and his enthusiasm ultimately ends up catching on with Reiji as well
Realistically, there's like two volumes to be able to wrap up the plots that were left
But I would like to see Gekkou finished
no, I'm just memeing
How about you expand that manga sidestory on indefinite hiatus, then
> the ever-expanding world of IBO
Try is a run of the mill shonen title painted in Gundam colors
Fighters understood the appeal of Gundam and plastic models
I very much hated Try
Although then again I've also seen people beat for beat reinvent nazi apologist talking points when trying to defend Zeon, so I really shouldn't be surprised 💀
unfortunately true
I've had multiple people argue to me that 3SA had no way of knowing that Durandal was actually evil and that their opposing the Destiny plan was [insert stock complaint about plot point you don't like here]
The problem is just that the political commentary completely went over the heads of distressingly many viewers
Oh no, it's an excellent study of how propaganda works
Also maybe go a little harder on how fucked Durandal's scheming actually was, because a CONCERNING amount of people somehow do not see the bad part in a militaristic ethnostate proposing that your genes should determine your life and future
He was the only one actually involved with both sides of the story, and the one who every time carried the burden of showing the contrast between the sides
Afterwards, it was unquestionably Athrun
in no small part because Shinn was only actually the protagonist of Destiny for like the first 10 episodes
tbf I do think that bringing Kira back was the right decision
As for the first two thirds... no idea how I would fix these, short of taking the general outline and scrapping everything about the execution
They had something going in the last third or so, but Shinn kept taking the idiot ball to the face every time he was on the verge of figuring it out
I feel like at least the latter half of Destiny could have been made a lot better by just having Shinn realize he was fighting for the space fascists, but either too deep in a sunk cost fallacy to stop or having convinced himself that they're still the lesser evil and the Three Ships Alliance is a hindrance in actually taking out the root of the problem, only after which Zaft'S internal issues can be rectified
Tomino tried with F91, and we all know how that went
I mean Destiny has a runtime of 16 hours, give or take, not counting op/ed. Even a really long movie will not be able to meaningfully fit the thing front to back
~~also I don't think you can compress 50 episodes of Destiny down to a movie without making it objectively worse, no matter what changes you make to the plot~~
yeah, my idea is more like, if you had the means to tell your own Gundam story in the span of one movie (or alternatively short OVA), what would it be
although I was mostly thinking of Crossbone movie - Crossbone movie - Crossbone movie - Gaia Gear movie - Crossbone movie
yes
What do you make
Full creative control, you're told to make a Gundam movie; only rule you're given is no adaptations or direct sequels
Actually, here's a question
I watched all of two Divers episodes before deciding that I'm good actually; one was the Galbaldy Rebake intro ep, the other was one of the Red Beret eps
Red Beret is the big sexy
funnily enough, almost. His suit in my case
there is lol
Last resort weapon should not be the only weapon
which is hot nonsense, given that Reiji was quite excellent at regular weapons
Reiji did come back in GM's Counterattack
Their dynamic is so good
ReRise had an excellent thing going with Hiroto and May
actually that's a lie, I would not have watched Megaton, Sakugan and KKS if they hadn't been airing, for WILDLY different reasons
LycoReco was my only seasonal in recent memory in the sense of "show I watched because it was airing", not counting things I would have watched anyway
yep
YUP THERE IT IS
...I kinda wanna rewatch now
~~and Chisato getting spanked by what'shername after trying on Takina's boxers~~
LycoReco's voicework is incredible
Also the yabaiyabaiyabai
Either this ep or next
I think you've seen this one, but spoilering just in case
The moment that absolutely sold me on the show was ||Chisato's face after Takina flashing her panties right in her face while playing the vr game, only for the reveal that actually, Chisato didn't see shit and now she's so salty she takes Takina to shop for girly underwear||
yeah you're like one epsidoe away from Takina realizing that she might be gay actually
You're at ep... 4, right?
don't worry, you will get there before long
mh, that sounds pretty fun
<:mari_nya:900793574352879616>
Seeing Chisato ~~get so giddy over clothes~~ is fun~~ny~~
fixed your sentence
Space that out with a bit of actual building and something like shopping for weapon sets to get that one part you still need, I think that could work quite nicely
Or stuff like the DM puts down some enemy machines, one of them loses a part in the process; oh, that machine took a hit during the airdrop, now can't use whatever part fell off
Have the actual actions on the table be juxtaposed with the player's imagination of what the fight would look like
I'd probably do a Gunpla tabletop thing, I have something of an idea for that
yeah, I can see that working quite nicely
LycoReco gud
low tech Gundam is honestly a pretty cool idea that I wish more things would dabble in
yeah, I can also see that working
I thought you were going for more a thing of very clumsy, low tech maneuvering in space where just docking with a ship is a high stakes scenario where a ton can go wrong
oh I completely misread what you said lmao
You mean like early Gunbuster kind of vibe?
ooooooo that sounds dope
~~which is doubly amusing given that they both collabed with WoT/WoWs respectively, and the boat game also distinctly sucks less~~
oh yeah, Haifuri is 100% GuP but actually a decent show
GuP is my prime example for fun does not equal good
true lmao
If this is the payoff for two years of people bitching about muh pbandai no retail releases anymore, I'll fucking take it
They're coming out SWINGING right now
yea
please, mercy on my wallet
like what the fuck
those, RD Blossom, Phantom V2, Anchor, MRD Aquarius and Knight Superior of all things, Zoids and a bunch of GGG figures
Bndai just fucking chose violence
I liked BD, but ||it didn't exactly do a ton with Marion as a person beyond being tortured by her existence inside EXAM; between this and Narrative just being kinda bad in general, I'm excited for the idea of them actually doing that plotline well||
I'm on the opposite side of that coin lmao
||Elan4, for whatever that's worth, has been confirmed dead by his seiy in the special broadcast; not saying that it'S categorically impossible, far be it from me to put it beyond Gundam to keep someone alive who by all indicators shouldn't be, but I do think it will be unlikely||
||Plus, sociopaths' elaborate revenge plots failing because they didn't account for humans having a will besides being their pawns is both very satisfying to watch and kinda one of the foundational structural elements of Char clones||
||And especially looking at the scheming in Code Geass, exactly the kind of stuff that Okuchi is all over given the chance||
Meanwhile ||an optimistic fluffball finding out that and having to recover from/reconcile with the knowledge that her beloved mother threw her previous child into the meatgrinder to shape the ultimate weapon and trained her from toddler age to operate it just for a revenge by proxy plot involving at least a close friend, if not her lover as colateral damage, while maintaining a vague sense of twisted purpose of taking revenge on someone said colateral damage also hates for an atrocity Suletta wasn't even alive for? That's the material for some JUICY horribleness||
AI plots, while they certainly can be good and interesting, are fairly even ground in their execution
But like
Which, in fairness could also apply to a piloting AI
I just think that ||Suletta finding out how her mother is actually horrible would make for a stronger story in the context of the framework we have been given than the discussion of when an AI becomes human; not that the formers rules out the latter from being a theme to begin with, it would just need to be done on a different machine||
Prologue's tech was about human enhancement, not AI
?
But that has so far been rather... peripheral to the core themes
Like, I wouldn't mind if it is
Iski why do you assume that this is a show about AI
ESPECIALLY if the alternative is to go "oh yeah, this hint actually refers to a random other event never heard about before"
how is placing subtle hints about something bigger going on worse storytelling
wat
||I mean yeah, but that's kinda the crux of it. Everything is carefully plotted out to make sense either way, except one thing that doesn't||
That kinda stuff is not far out considering the other shows he's done
Plus, it's Okuchi we're talking about
||Like, there is some fucky Eva 01 shit going on with Aerial, I don't think anyone can really dispute that, there are things that don't line up with the "official" sequence of events and a rather large amount of remarks especially from Prospera are pointedly vague and with multiple possible meanings||
||I don't think it's some muh drama/I want this to be dark, as much as being the most likely explanation for the information we do currently have||
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
O shit, it's Aim for the Top 3
https://twitter.com/bullbuster_info/status/1593529448338374659
~~and generally only that season~~
...while at the same time also being presented as far better because you don't need to worry about the pilot inside
Also if the Dolls actually did anything, other than being talked about as inhumane
(brb, dinner)
I mean the aesthetic of the world
I do not mean mechanical design
It pains me that the actual show just fails to capitalize on any of the potential it has
Wing's setting and aesthetic are SO GOOD
Wing would have hit harder if it had any seblance of character motivations and didn't pick "throw down your weapons and insist on moral superiority and the fascists will leave you alone" as its hill to die on <:Ver:704169051391524875>
Also Wing, but like... Wing didn't exactly do a great job at making that point
true
||I mean, if we're going for specifically the angle of AI turning evil, I pose you G Gundam||
ye
Witch
||I just realized something.
Chuchu's demi trainer has the sniper rifle.
Pharact will soon be owned by Earth house as part of Gund Inc.
...is Chuchu gonna be the next Pharact pilot||
I also like how often she's copiloting the DX, that does help with the dynamic feeling less battle protag protecting his innocent girlfriend and more that they are actually both on board (heh) and on equal footing
I'm admittedly a bit blurry on late X, but I remember her playing a not insignificant role in Lancerow's betrayal of Rasso
It's the one thing that really sets Tiffa apart from the other Gundam girls with a premium subscription to getting kidnapped, Tiffa even in the absence of the rest of the Frieden squad is always putting in an effort to be as much of a problem to the strongmen as she can be
Garrod and Tiffa are easily my favorite couple in Gundam, and the amount of sheer nonsense they get up to to cause problems for the space and earth fascists I will never get tired of
But I gotta respect someone who is willing to aim a WMD at her own position to break out
fair
One counterpoint in Tiffa, but yeah, she's pretty up there
It's this; the one with just the mains, that has a bit of post-Trailblazer stuff at the end
Okay, continuing from <#336310266654490624>; the 00 stage play I mean is not this on
not intentionally, but bar Kyouko x2, it kinda ended up as that <:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
https://anime-bingo.aikats.us/ found an anime bingo thing
It existed for Yamato/Musashi/Shinano/Kii, and that's all I wanted out of it, so I'm happy
yea
I kinda love it
This was the dumbest movie I have seen in a long time
Great to have the Spee again, but please stop trying to German, movie
lmao those two are so married
hi Prelati
can we please boats
...watching school festival sol is a lot less entertaining if you have no recollection who any of these characters are
Guess I know what I'll be doing
So I just found out that Haifuri has a movie
Or to put it another way, what's gonna be the density of me wanting to strangle whichever character is currently speaking
yeah, I'm thinking on the scale from Turn A to Victory, where does the overall vibe fall
...how Tomino™️ is the show?
People talking about the Sirbine HG on one of my places kinda makes me wanna go and watch Dunbine
I also hear that the actual story is kinda mid, but I can't speak to that myself
I've been mildly soured on Zero solely because of the amount of idiots using it to um akshually Demonbane whenever someone tangentially brings up liking another powerful mech

it does not refer to that
You don't drop this many hints that something is not as it seems just to have things be as they appear at first glance
^^^^^^^^^^^^
||Prospera uses musume-tachi. She means daughters, plural||
||no, we see the silhouette of his actual mother||
||Elan4 is not a clone tho, he's a body double||
||Well, it would at least be public knowledge in the circles attending that party, since they're all directly involved with Bennerit Group corpos||
Not to mention that if that is the level of argumentation, literally anything can be disregarded. By that logic, how do we know the Prologue ever happened at all and isn't an in-universe propaganda movie
||That's the in-universe equivalent of saying that 9/11 happened in 2003; anyone with a basic knowledge of recent history would immediately know that this is either a mistake, or the most idiotic attempt at misdirection||
are you _actually_ for real
are you for real
..............
||The date of the attack is public, easily verifyable knowledge. Lying about that would immediately discredit whoever is making the claim||
That would be patent nonsense
||yes, because we have hard, in-show evidence to what the timeline is; that tweet is grasping at straws||
||Espceially since this is the public-facing one after already having put in research, so the other corpos would already be well aware||
||It's not even a blow. The presence of a PR video dated to the same year does not disprove shit||
||Given that one is tinfoil hats on the assumption that a PR vieo can'T have happened in the same year and the other is two characters talking about a publically known date that therefore have no incentive to lie, one very firmly overrules the other here||

||last ep hard confirmed Vanadis attack as being 21 years ago||
that'S cope
~~Superb Song~~ <:ElsaSick:689395768754569359>
~~almost like that has been the standard M/O for every professional translator worth their salt to and from any language pretty much for as long as the concept of translating things for a job has existed~~
Literal translations are impossible anyways and any approximation of them suck, so going with the things that flow well and better capture connotations and thematic meaning will always be superior
Commie highkey have the best subs
...I'm really starting to get Eva loop/sequel "theory" flashbacks from the Witch debate
Tbh the vibe I'm getting from Shaddiq us far more ||trying very hard to fulfill his dad's wishes so as to not be disowned until he is in a position to make a move/started out as that, but lost sight of it, rather than being purposefully evil||
Exactly. This is also the writer behind Code Geass, so he can absolutely write good shit that holds together
If it has unusually dynamic typesetting, it's Commie
yes
Although I respect the hussle of subbing the translated name onto the transformation sequences
yeah, Heavenrend is the only really wonky bit
Yeah when I found that one out I had to stop and first yell that fact at a couple of people
Kyouko's group, the one voiced by Millaarc, has a Gyakko no Flügel cover
You wanna know the funniest part?
lol
https://twitter.com/240eukrante/status/1597788682706358272
||I wager she has about 75%odds of making it||
||I mean to be far, hard to have a worse life than the 86 kids||
Yeah that's a good fit
In fairness, given that it's about vtubers, anything more than that could get kinda weird
huh
https://mangadex.org/title/a81e5f47-645f-42a0-93a3-e37dc9e1f398/cyber-newtype-story-mad-wang-1160 So apparently, _**THE**_ oddball Gundam sidestory got a translation
Well good thing you established that you value outrage bait over useful conversation
also unprompted "x piece of media better than y piece of media" is without fail dumb reaction bait in the first place, even in places where things might be comparable
also LMAO the end fight ||was really just someone trying their hardest to write a Getter story in a Gundam setting||
Nothing to write home about, but pretty decent sidestory all in all
read Gundam Sentinel
SKL was also fun, but that's kinda it
Shin vs Neo is ultimately a nothingburger, New is dubious plots stacked in a trenchcoat pretending to be a show, and Arc was just bad
I have watched three and dropped one, of which only Armageddon passed the bar of being worth its runtime
just any of them
If Mazinkaiser and the two minutes of Infinity I watched are anything to go by, I very do not
does it ever
Bruh someone on one of my places is trying to gaslight me into thinking that Getter and Mazinger anime are by enlarge good 💀
The irony of ||the nuke being taken out of the picture, so the whole final fight being a completely meaningless sacrifice|| was a great setup, but they could have gone a lot harder on that
But tbh I was expecting the emotional violence to be a lot more high impact
Apart from the soundtrack, that killed the mood in a number of scenes
Yeah, it didn't blow me away either, but it is very on point in its execution
finally sat down to actually watch the damn thing
also; 0080 good
But if memory serves me, you should be around the point where it pulls itself together
yeah that one was kinda egregious
fair
||Blitz going down up until Freedom showing up, so yeah, Josh-A is part of it||
But the two big battles at the end of Destiny are genuine fun, and even if you reasonably decide that actually, I think I'm good, ep... I believe it was 39 onwards are worth the time investment if you're after the action and some political maneuvering
The first six or seven episodes are alright, followed by some twenty episodes of boredom and "why do these returning characters act like that", followed by another ten or so of infuriating writing decisions, and only the last tenish episodes are actually fun to watch and have the returning cast act like themselves ~~although those are especially slammed by people who have a hateboner for Seed to begin with, usually without having actually seen either show, which unfortunately dominated English-language discourse about either show~~
Destiny then is..... not that
It never quite reaches that high again afterwards, but it's at least a good watch for the rest of it, and I like what they did with the main characters' motivations and ideologies
As for Seed, it's a similar story, albeit more extreme to both ends; the first 20 episodes are a real slog to get through, and honestly only like five of them are not replacable by their cliffnotes version as far as interesting/relevant content goes, but about halfway through the desert arc, the show pulls itself together into being a pretty fun watch, and after a brief relapse into mostly inconsequential grunt squad of the week plots for like two episodes, it hits you over the head with what is a strong contender for being the best plot arc in all of Gundam
It does, yeah
Once you hit op2, it gets a lot better in most departments
Second half pulls itself together alright, but getting there requires a fair chunk of tolerance for aggressively 2000s anime tropes
Frontier's first half is pretty rough, yeah
Truth
Like, if this were about WWII, we'd have five on the Wehraboo counter and two on the actual Nazi apologist counter
That dubious honor goes to Missing Link (and I'm sure a number of others in a similar vein that I just haven't consumed) who have the Feddies fight other Feddies more than Zeon in their campaign, throw entire allied bases under the bus for political scheming in the middle of an active war and have heir big moment of heroism when they defect from the Federation to join up with Zeon forces, while said Zeon forces have their campaign be about how they're just some kids wanting to fight for their contry and live and the story REVELS in having them saved by the famous Zeon aces, look at how cool they are
The merchandising is decidedly not the most yikes part about OYW sidestories
And a distressing amount of times with a side of "but what if fascism is cool actually"
Also Tracer and Moebius from Hathaway
VigilaNTe, Unicorn, Layers (ModV)
XBCX was also Sawano
oh yeah, right
Also Re:Creators, but I have heard very mixed things about the quality of the actual show
I seem to recall an interview where he said that even he himself doesn't remember the logic behind one of the tracks in Hathaway
Oh yeah, Sawano titles just kinda get more unhinged as time goes on
quite so
yeah, both are Sawano
I'd flip my shit
It is exactly what you would expect from the name, and it's quite fun
Asumi-chan is interested in lesbian brothels
yeeeaaaaa
Genuinely one of the best shows I have ever watched
but no, much higher than that
booooo
GOD this show is so good
Rewatched 86 with a friend
which was in like... 2008ish, I think
I have not actually consumed a meaningful amount of superhero media since Justice League, Brave and the Bold, X-Men Evo, Spectacular Spiderman and Earth's Mightiest Heroes aired on German television
I am only tangentially aware of that
Tbh the only piece of superhero media crossover I'd be actually interested in checking out is a fullon Marvel/DC collab, if nothing else to either take off the edge from the dumb lines in the sand in the discourse about them, or to watch the rabid fanboys of either have a meltdown trying to reconcile reality with the us vs them they have chosen as their hill to die on
Evolutions was good, and I kinda don't see this one being
but at the same time
yeah, this has X-Men Evolutions energy in that h yeah, they're just younger
*angry Issei noises*
Didn't know Dianna Soreil was in Pokemon
anyway, that thought fucking SENDS ME
The thought of Team Rocket being Ash's... not inlaws, that's the wrong word here, but you know what I mean
The one thing that makes this even funnier than the concept already is is the prospect of would-be Ash's kid and would-be Team Rocket's kid being shipped
But still, fun oddball
oh I thought it was gonna be a whole thing
cautiously excited?
I am
That shelf has grown a bit since then lol
...god this pic is ancient

Hold on, I have a pic of at least my Destiny shelfboard somewhere
I am actually looking at getting more shelves
I have perhaps a few to many plastic robots
it is
~~hi I did that, dubious use of my money but I like the result~~
Alternatively, substitute by getting all the other Destiny hero suits to put it with <:GenjuroLaugh:689563633516150872>
HGCE Destiny is a lovely build in general
I have one, good kit
VA aside, orange was his color scheme
Heine's colors
Well, and just
damn you, schedules
Heine deserved better
and ye
ayy nice
Yoooo physical copy
Reading Twin Star Exorcists upon glowing recommendation of a friend, pretty fun so far
I hate that I like this
okay yeah that scans
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fn3zUfp4jTs one of the Braves/general old super robot people in my circles just responded with this
Watch it be one of those kids shows that gets weirdly dark and politically aware
Gonna try to watch that with some friends later lol
I assume it's just more cheap bait, as ankry is one to do
Wonderful face choices for the shirts <:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
Exact age is unknown, somewhere in the ballpark of 16 or 17
The fact that Mika is among the taller Gundam protags does not sit right with me
accurate lmao
And it still pales compared to how they butchered my boy Zeheart even worse through the same method
Asemu is great before they decided that an elaborate reference to a 25 year old show was more important than telling a good story with the current show
Actually, I will also raise you the duet from Wing if my memory of it at all serves me. Not quite as charged as the 00 ed, but it was getting there
Fair
That entire sequence of them messing around had some vibes
I will raise you Kihel and Dianna swapping clothes
This is the dumbest plot point I have seen in animated Gundam, bar none
I mean yes, but like
||Ah yes, let's help fix the MA that is going to be used by the enemy, piloted by someone I ostensibly like, instead of letting him not finish in time and be forced to stay out of the suicidal operation I know they are planning this thing to take part in. What could possibly go wrong.||
Kou might be more stupid than Kio, holy fucking shit
The thing that annoys me the most is the Zeon nobility directly contrasted with all the Feds bneing either incompetent or absolute sleazebags
...I really detest the gratuitous Zeon wankery/attempt at Fed blackwashing that 0083 is trying to pull
And again
Me @ 0083
Get that evil Feds noble Zeon bullshit out of my face
...yeah go fuck yourself, Stardust
God ||Burning's death|| was fucking egregious, even by UC standards
Oh yeah, Bocchi is really good at that
well, let's just say that making a faction that has beat for beat the strategy of Imperial Japan pre-WWII into looking like the good guys tracks with the politics of the author
The Sleeves....
yeah, the Zeon remnants in Unicorn are workable
UC has a real fucking problem with pandering to Zeon fanboys
_yep_
0083 still frames Bask Om to be more sympathetic than the majority of other Fed officers, even when he fires the Solar System at his own people
I am aware of enough plot beats, but that's exactly my problem
Haven't seen Zeta, can't comment on that with authority; but it doesn't change the really really bad framing
oh right, she was also an officer technically
This is nazi apologist rhethoric beat for fucking beat, applied to a faction that already has a problem with way too fucking many people thinking that um akshually, they're the real good guys
The show bends over backwards to make every single Fed who isn't Synapse, Burning, Kowen, Kou or Keith the biggest asshole they can possibly be at any given point, while jacking off how noble and honorable the Delaz fleet is and how it's people like Cima who made Zeon the bad guys
The thing that really sets me off is how Bask motherfucking Om, in the face of firing the SS2 on hiw own forces, is still the fourth most sympathetic officer in the whole damn thing
It's at least not _worse_ than 83
I think _Wing_ may actually be a better show than this
MagiReco was very much not that
from what I gathered reading this channel, MagiRevo has a shot at actually being good :P
I really gotta pick that up, been meaning to for a while
O shit, I knew I recognized that artstyle
If you can only get to the other planet by means of magitech portal at the start, but season 2 starts with an orbital fleet getting there as well, the hypothetical S1 would be isekai, while S2, depending on the framing, would not necessarily still be
I'd argue that the isekai-ness can change over time
It's a term of framing, not metaphysics, I suppose would be a good way to put it
yeah, that
There's a couple of grey areas with time travel and planet hopping, but by enlarge, that one holds water
That feels like a workable definition, yeah
Not like there is a clear-cut line anyways
This feels like a kinda needlessly pedantic distinction to argue over
Wasn't super impressed by the anime original plot, and skipping forwards did noz make me want to watch it, either
Well, the first 20 episodes that actually adapt the manga
Twin Star Exorcists anime is pretty alright
MHA is just an objectvely better acronym, it is shorter, easier remembered and easier pronounced
Statisticaly speaking, that they care more about pedantry than being short or understandable
they very much did deserve it
yeah, Chuchu just fucking dropped both of them
welp, there's the other staple German kids show
.....
......Wikipedia what the fuck what what do you mean Vicky the Viking was done by the same studio
However, it is also an adaptation of a 19th century Swiss novel, so there's a different thing that makes it not precicely clear-cut case if we're going through by checklist
On cursory fact-checking, I seem to have conflated Heidi's production and reception with that of something else, the show was paid for by a Japanese company and is still very popular in Japan
On all technical aspects, that show is an anime, but a lot of ""objective"" definitions would likely not count it as such
Heidi, one of _the_ most iconic and archetypically German(/Austrian/Swiss) shows, was written and animated entirely by a Japanese studio, but if memory at all serves me, funded and published by a Western company, but effectively all of its cultural impact was, perhaps unsurprisingly, in the countries the story was set in, and from my observation very little outside of it
There's a lot of stuff that gets outsourced into or out of Japan, sequels to shows made primarily for the Japanese market that are now made for a primarily overseas market, etc
Trying to find an objective metric for what is or isn't anime is an exercise in futility, it's all vibes and grey areas
I do not like your attitude, so I shall put this on channel on mute for a while
...on second thought, I don't think I want to be talking to you actually
What part of "still shit tho" is a description of fact
You are very quick to declare your own opinion as some sort of objective fact, even when faced with multiple people disagreeing, without really giving a good reason for it. I'd generally advise against doing that, it does not make for productive conversation
Yes, especially in the case of Hayate
Only ones I've personally seen on that list are Edgerunnery, LycoReco and TTGL; LycoReco is definitely my favorite of those, Edgerunners is good but didn't really do much for me, and TTGL I did not like
Honestly that's the thing I disliked the most about Delta, I think they really fumbled the character arcs
gaaaaaeeeeee
Nanoha
But I absolutely see what you mean
I've only seen Frontier and Delta, and between the two I definitely prefer Frontier lol
....this tf sequence feels a bit very skeevy given that she's like nine or ten
I think it might be Nanoha o'clock
I found mxself with some unexpected free time on my hands
braincell quantum superposition
hahahahaha iuncredible
For a second I thought that was a DS game
At least if they don't fuck it up like DC and Marvel by constantly trying to connect and cut apart the whole thing
The singular best desicion that Gundam as a franchise has made is to introduce AUs that have no ties to UC, and I think a lot of media properties would greatly benefit from doing the same
Or hell, had it been set in its own property, removed from the constraints and expectations of Macross, although that probably would have run into ye olden funding issues
Delta is one of those cases where I think it would have been much better had it just been set in its own timeline
It just doesn't come together well as a whole
The story it wants to tell is so at odds with the story it has to tell by being set in that universe
But yeah, I suppose my main thing about Delta is that, to the best of my ability going off of Frontier and the bits and pieces of other Macross media that I've seen and been told about, Delta at its heart really doesn't want to be a Macross show
And I haven't seen enough of Macross to have a strong opinion there, but in the case of Gundam, I have two and a half rants canned and ready to go at any time on how much I hate the stock tropes that the franchise refuses to let go of to the detriment of the new stories it tells, so I am fully on your page that the some of the callbacks in Frontier are stupid and probably shouldn't be there
Frontier is probably in my top 30 at most
It's just the best Macross thing I have seen so far, in that I liked the rest less
Don't get me wrong, I don't think Frontier is particularily great
Whenever I actually watch SDFM, I know for a fact that I will be greatly annoyed at that scene because it is SO DUMB
Yes, but as a plot point, one is not as egregious as the other
||Almost dying because you prioritized going to a concert over getting first aid is marginally less braindead than actually dying because you prioritized going to a concert over getting first aid||
It's a dumb plot point, but from what I gather about SDFM, not as dumb as the original plot point
And Minmay attack is kind of hard to not have at least heard of in that context
I have only seen Frontier and Delta, but I have hung around mecha places for long enough to be aware of the broad strokes of at least some of the other works
In the expodump montage by racial stereotype man, it shows footage from SDFM's Minmay attack while talking about how ||music has been programmen into the Zentradi as a genetic weakspot by the Protoculture, and how that's the reason why Minmay attack worked||
I am talking about the retcon to SDF Macross
I am not talking about Frontier
There were no Fold Quartzes there to my knowledge
Which Delta explicitly says Minmay attack was
Going "oh actually, that was secretly genetic coding all along and it had nothing to do with tactics" is decidedly not
And Delta did dumb down the plotpoints; a piece of music being such a culture shock that it throws a battle formation into chaos and enables a strategic victory is clever
It's why I have such an intense disliking for Gundam Seed Astray, it does basically nothing but that
Which to me is one of the worst offenses that a sequel or sidestory can committ, to try and make itself look smarter by dumbing down the work it's spun off from
But Frontier stuck to itself, and didn't retcon every work that came before it
I mean yes, and it was also bullshit in Frontier
Also the racial coding of the guy who loredumped those was reeeeeaaaaaally yikes, I just remembered that
That really does not sit right with me, and I haven't even seen half of the events they retconned and could still tell that it was kind of an asspull
That actually, every instance of music changing the tide of a battle was space magic instead of just impact on morale
Because that is ultimately what they said with Mirage's arc in Zettai Live
I think it would have been a far more healthy point for the show to make that if you aren't the best at something, you should strive to find other ways to be good at it, rather than if you are not the best at something, just ditch it and find something else
||No, she was pretty explicitly framed as god-tier commander, but bad pilot; instead, it would have been far more interesting to make her and Hayate's strength be their teamwork, rather than individually busted in different fields||
Although by far the most egregious offense of Delta is the retcons
Because the creators spent their time infighting over what they wanted to do instead of having a plan
My point is that that is one of the reasons why I think Delta has really bad character arcs
I am aware of that
Making her into ||a god-tier commander is such a copout from giving her something actually interesting as her special skill, and making Hayate replacement Messer on the double||
They should have taken Mirage in a lot of directions, but not there
I FIRMLY disagree
Mirage never recovers from that, she keeps floating around in that ship tease zone and fully doesn't get to develop the battle buddy dynamic they had going before
They used the love triangle as a crutch, and kneecapped the most interesting character in the show for it
That is precisely my problem
She was set up to be a really interesting character, but they played it safe at every turn, followed the franchise tropes to a fault, ||and her character never recovered from the love triangle they tried to shove her into||
And I really really dislike what they did with Mirage
They had a thing going with ||oh, his dad nuked Windemere, they could have done something with digging up that generational guilt, or made a point about how people can be nice to those who care about, but still be really hateful; but no, they just dropped that entirely and came up with some excuse for why actually it wasn't his fault||
I don't know what they were trying to do with him, but it just ended up feeling really pointless to me, and kept undercutting itself
Gonna cross that bridge when I get there in that case
okay, I think I got the vibe then
Coulda phrased that a lot better on my part
Yeah, but I meant more in the sense of, does it feel like a natural evolution or like a tacked-on extra that shoves the old characters out of the way in weird ways
Older and a bunch of new characters as in S2 after a timeskip or as in sequel movie that noone asked for as far as grace of handling it goes
Are Vivid and Strikers at all relevant and/or good?
Welp, next franchise with a messy watch order, here I come
But if movies are good, gonna do those
I vaguely recall Melua saying something about..... I think it was Strikers having a decent TV version and the movie cuts out some stuff that some people might deem relevant, so thought I'd check
alright
But yeah, this got drowned out by the Macross talk, but I finished Nanoha; was a fun movie. Now where the fuck do I go next in this soup of shows
It's the old saying, don't ascribe to malice what can be properly explained through incompetence
I've worked in tech before, this kinda stuff just sometimes happens when someone doesn'T pay attention setting up an automated thing, copypasted the wrong time code into the system, uploaded the wrong file or something
I'm not familiar with the details, but I'm going to seriously doubt that someone would jeopardize their job for the sake of leaking an episode of a show on itunes
I donÄt think this was an intentional leak so much as a fuckup
Although I suppose you can tell a Kawamori lineart by the fact that you can't immediately tell who made it and the proportions look not horrible
His visual style is a bit less distinctive than most other well-known mechanical designers, so you can't always immediately tell, but he's done a bunch of stuff
But yeah, Kawamori has been around the block a lot
I thought those were Katoki, huh
Huh?
But hold on, Kawamori did stuff for 0083?
For a promo thing, he made some kitbashes
Also did a thing for Lego Exo Force back when that was still a thing
White Glint from Armored Core if memory serves me
Thereabouts
Replied to the wrong message, oop
I had my issues with the first half (namely Kamina being a dogshit commander to the point of active liability and the show trying its best to pretend he's actually a genius/glorifying the not exactly toxic, but also decidedly not healthy friendship and the characters being kinda shallow, beyond that it's pretty alright), but big agree on the second half
I don't hate it, but TTGL runs entirely on hype, and if the hype doesn't grab you, the show really doesn't have a lot else going for it
pfft
If I really like A, Imma go back and do the show
That's p much the idea if the movies all hold up pacing-wise, which I trust y'all's word that they do
Just so I have my notes in order
Okay so it's A > Reflection > Detonation > Strikers if I wanna do all of them?
I have watched the first movie
Okay wait, so
I think chuchu went exactly as far as needed tbh
~~I say as if I haven't done 40 episode beinges before~~
Three movies in a day isn't thaaat much, right
Welp, guess I know what I'll be doing tomorrow
I loooove me a well-executed oh shit moment
I greatly look forward to whatever that's going to be
It's kinda hard to be a worse watch than Victory
I fully expect it to be
I suffered through 51 episodes of Victory Gundam, I can stomach 26 episodes of something that has some flaws
So two days
The shows are all pretty short, right?
But yeah, prolly still gonna give it a shot once I'm there
Oh yeah, I got that from what you said, I was talking about the "nothing is set after it", how a hypothetical sequel would probably not do very well for lack of identity
Having a show called Nanoha without Nanoha in it seems... predictably unwise
Like, the premise of Strikers sounds alright, but I really don't see anything beyond that
I was about to say, that sounds like it would very not work in a franchise that has the character they're sidelining in the title
lmao her final attack is actually called Heat End
...ffs why must all services that have Reflection be ass garbage
Welp, we transformers now
I see what you meant by it turns more mecha as it goes on
....welp, we got space colonies now
my wallet is in pain, again
...well would you look at that, there's a figma for all of them apart from Arf and the three magical boys
Okay the space cannon having no sound was a really nice touch
Not at all thje intention, but that gave me a good laugh
Okay I take back what I said about the German being painful, this was fucking hilarious
BWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA the book of darkness has the most automated customer service hotline voice I have ever heard
~~assuming that Nanoha has decent figures that aren't a million bucks~~
May or may not add some of them to my ever-growing shopping list of figures
but yeah, show is very fun, definitely gonna continue my binge of it today
I have only just hit the first time she calls herself devil, no "white" yet
Thgat's incredible
HAH
In either case, I like it, and I can see where the creators of gear looked at Nanoha and went oh hey, that's a good idea, we should do that
Working off of a very incomplete sample size, so I'm just trying to figure it out on the fly p much
In that case, I stand corrected
I mean more in terms of the movements. It does a lot of visual composition stuff that's usually in place for making a mech look big and imposing
awww
lmao
ooooh so this is where the other one's from
perfect
<:owlmischief:961396165197316106>
Even being in the same combat avatar supergenre, this feels distinctly more mecha-like in shot composition than the other magical girl things I've seen that aren't Symphogear
I have not watched a meaningful amount of magical girl shows that came out before this, so I can't say for certain, but this feels like it's shot more as a mecha show than others
Looks dope tho
Of course Bardiche gets the six shooter
Bar some of the swirling, that was legit good polearm fighting
..yo they've got some moves
God, the German is so stilted
This is gonna be painful
Oh no I already didn't like the English of Nanoha's and Fate's gems
Oh no the magical book speaks German
Are those Nanoha spinoffs or something else by the same staff
in such a hypothetical MGW, if characters that had a gacha crossover before knew each other from that, and the game just rolls with that having happened
....you know what would be funny
Now I doubly wish for a magical girls SRW
Two evenings well spent
But yeah, show good, liked it quite a bit
mh
I had that thought like halfway through Detonation, this felt like it could be a well-polished gacha plot made to work in animated form
Wait... was this a gacha adaptation
Lol.
So as far as sequel movie plots go, this is as good as they come
||Deliberate manipulation by an asshole you trusted as family|| is a serviceable motivation for the setup, works a lot better than it all being some dumb miscommunication that could have been talked out if someone just stopped for ten seconds to listen, and the movie did not have the runtime to properly execute a plot of people actually growing apart and ending up as enemies for intrinsic reasons, much less to contemplate the consequences of such a plot
I take that over any other option that that plot could have gone
Yeah, he was very safe structurally, but like
I'm not sure if I prefer Detonation or A's at the end, but on the whole, this entire tetralogy is really fun
Also would have never worked as a single movie, so more evidence in that particular case study, too
I liked that, a lot
That was legit everything I want out of a sequel movie
What the shit this still wasn't the end
~~not that I'm complaining, I do enjoy her routine as angsty oneesan type~~
NEVERMIND, she is once again Yoko Hikasa being typecast
Short of my internet dying again, I will <:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
o boy
Usually it's the other way around
I do wanna know what happened to make those two go from gae to stab
Also known as German
"The Belkan language"
Gives me a fun brand of cognitive dissonance
Also part of me is very amused at having a Yoko Hikasa character who for once is just a complete asshole
But yeah, Detonation next
I counted some three or four attack names lifted straight from Gundam, and Nanoha's upgraded cannon is Assault-Buster as fuck
Oh yeah, it has a bunch
But yeah, definitely a fun movie ~~at least when it doesn't buffer every five seconds~~
I liked black cape and polearm more than white cape and buster sword
But Fate's upgrade is kind of a downgrade visually I feel
They are, yeah
Okay yeah, that'll definitely help
That's fair
Can't quite pinpoint what it is yet
Not by much, but I did like the first two a bit more
Funnily enough my least favorite of the three I'Ve seen so far
My point is, just get some material or another aimed to actually teach the language
Don't know, but it's gonna be better than trying to learn through anime
At least do some duolingo or something besides it
Also people don't talk like anime characters, and if you plan to use this for more than bragging rights, you will make a fool out of yourself this way
Yeah, but that is not going to get you to any good point
Anime alone is a really terrible way to learn Japanese
None
I want to slap whoever did that
I was thinking of Kyouko and Shinobu, but those two also
Although there's one in the anime that gets teased fairly hard
Yeah, that's game
Shit, I gotta get on that
Wait shit, new D4DJ is already airing?
Loud and clear
<:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
This was the first time I'm hearing this name, so I am not aware of any other slap-worthy details
I really like the rightmost one on the first pic
But yeah, that design is just not it
reading this, I had a moment of "what do you mean black Shaggy wasn't he always- wait, no, he wasn't"
Already caught up on that
Just got done binging effectively the entire thing with two friends, one of whom had it as a first watch
ReRise is still one of the best Gundam shows
~~and then the alien sightings from the US applying that tech to weather balloons to spot Soviet nuclear test sites~~
Yeah, physics of that are whack; I remember the stuff about the fighter pilot capsules imploding at certain depths so the sound carries until forever and can be picked up onshore to triangulate positions of downed aircraft
I don't super mind the radar-like display, I feel in most stories (scifi at least), that can kinda be handwaved through advancements in sensors and computing power, but I do get a bit annoyed at the amount of ships using active sonar without being picked up in turn
Ooh right, that stuff
I'm not super plugged into sonar tech, just know the basic idea behind active/passive sonar (which I'm annoyed that noone ever uses the latter), basic ways to hide from it and how the function compares to radar; I assume you have a much more in depth rant locked and loaded for that
I think that one was the Archangel's engine, but yeah
Huh, that's actually sensible, although at that point inconsistent with the battles after
I trust Gundam to understand the bad faith nature of the military industrial complex, I don't trust it to understand the ramifications of nuclear power
I assume because the Freedom et al were supposed to be actually directly powered without buffer batteries
Almost like the Earth Alliance and Zaft are still on that us or them genocide business and don't actually care about that whole treaty thing
(although in fairness, Mirage Colloid was also banned, and guess what both sides are using in secret anyways)
Using technicalities to get around treaties has always been how this shit was played, and I'm sure someone more versed in the eras can give examples from way before industrialized warfare
Nevermind that the spare parts are a full airframe, an engine and all the guns specified for that plane
There's also more than a few occasions of sending all the parts of a vehicle over so _technically_ you aren't sending your own vehicles into a war, just some spare parts
There was also a thing about the US building an airfield halfway across the Canadian border so they can send their fighter planes to Europe under their own power without breaking their pre-Pearl Harbor neutrality, since technically they were not taking off from US soil (details may differ on that one, been a million years since I looked into that story)
Although yes, the Destiny running out of power is just a straight oversight
That plot point isn't stupid, it's actually one of the most realistic things that Seed has done
Or a bit later, Japan making up three destroyers to hide the actual size of the Yamato by materials sent to build it
"this isn't a battleship, it's just a really big cruiser"
"oh, it's not a tank, it's a special police vehicle/argicultural implement"
Just look at the bullshit that countries (mostly the Axis, but also some Allied) pulled to get around post-WWI restrictions
I mean that one is 100% on brand for the military industrial complex
Yeah I'd take that, that game was fun
It does have a couple of really nice touches if you're into model kits, stuff like painting white in multiple layers when other colors only take one, a subtle increase in skill and tool usage between the build compilations, little details that give the whole thing a kind of passion and genuineness that not all of the Build entries have ~~looking at you, Try and Vanilladivers~~
It's showing the process of building as a self-serving purpose, something you do because you enjoy it, not because you need it as a tool to do that other thing, it just has a chill, whimsical vibe to it that at least to everyone I've shown it to really does sell the soul of the hobby
Fwiw tho in its 40 odd minute runtime, it did make one of my irl friends go from "eh, model kits are not my cup of tea" to "this is an unashamed toy advert and it fucking works" <:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
I like Beginning G, it has the spirit, but it is ultimately unremarkable
Brings to mind the 50 meter train track that exists in Canada somewhere so shipping companies can evade certain import taxes because technically the goods were transported by rail
It does, but at the same time, would not be without irl precedent, either
I mean, batteries are also used in every irl nuvlear powered vehicle, so I really don't get why it supposedly sounds weak
But yeah like, I get what you mean with this feeling stupid, but given that the military industrial complex weasling its way around laws is an entire plot point, no way in fuck was it not the intention to have that be precisely this
Bad faith compliance, but compliance to the letter of the law nonetheless
But yeah, the thing about HDE is that its inbuilt, but I'm going to make the guess that the intention is that it does the power transfer in a way that on a technicality is not forbidden by the treaty
Hyper Deuterion
oh
What the fuck are HDE units
On the Impulse, and funnily enough that scene of all things was the moment where I got a sinking feeling that the show was not gonna be good for a long time
we do
Hyper Deuterion is inbuilt
the Deuterion Engine was that
No
noted
Those Moderoid announcements make me wanna stop putting off watching it 👀
What's the recommended order for Patlabor again
fwiw the singular entry into that specific vibe was Pop Chaser after seeing that haha funny youtube upload and finding out that Anno directed it, but I'd put that being good more to Anno having directed it than anything else <:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
noted
Is that show actually any good or do the flags in my head when reading "Lemon People original" hold true
Saw some people yelling about Iczer in light of the kit announcement
I always said that as a haha imagine
Cannot believe we are actually getting a Megaton Musashi kit
X makes complete sense when remembering that the Frost brothers are 17, but Wing not so much
It still doesn't I'm afraid
That's the level of writing we're dealing with in Wing
(they were in an area where no fighting had happened in the entire show so far)
At one point, the commander of the fascists but akshually a really cool guy lets a baby drown because that will teach the mother the reality of war
It implies that the story is convoluted, when in reality the story is just bad and does not make sense
I feel like confusing is the wrong word here
(it should be noted that 00 is also not perfect, both seasons have their share of issues and most people who have watched it tend to quite dislike one or the other, but it genuinely is Wing but not ass)
I wish this was hyperbole
By the end of the show, five of its seven important pilots have "my Gundam told me to do it, so I did" as the start and end of their motivation
Wing has aesthetic out the ass, but its story is barely there at the best of times
^this
(ah, that was meant as a general you, not you in particular, sorry)
The thing was definitely already in production before S1 aired, and for all we know, the showrunners may be obliged to pay the entire estimated budget in case of backing out; would be unlikely, but to my knowledge not unheard of
That'S not really how this kind of contract works, you can't make a default statement like this
Might be cheaper to just eat the loss rather than pay the fees for backing out of existing contracts
A shame its story sucks shit so hard
Astraea F is really dope
I feel like I might actually like the Astraea better than it
The 00 itself is definitely the weakest in the lineage
I really like how menacing its head looks
QanT is one of my favorite robot designs lol
Although I think across the board the Trailblazer designs are my favorites, bar Raphael
Although probably the silliest thing about Seravee is the gun lenses flipping around to reveal hands
I don't have an issue with the heavy armor, it makes sense for a tank/artillerypiece to be rather chunky
I don't dislike it, but Virtue is definitely better
Yeah, Seravee is a bit much
G Reco is more or less a sidestory to a main work that doesn't exist; it very clearly wants to show off the cool world Tomino made rather than tell a story
I'd have to agree
Effectively everyone I talked to, even the people really liking it, say it's an acquired taste at best
Look at the forearms

Lemme grab the arts, one sec
no, not to the level that 00 did it
They also had two different reference linearts for glory shots and regular animation
I think I like Cherudim more than Dynames, but generally yea
It didn't keep throwing sticks in its own path whenever it tried to actually do something
S2 just felt less constipated to watch
There's quite a number of those on my gunpla places, so it's definitely not just me
Huh
The end part of it is really good and I enjoyed S2 a lot, but if you're not vibing with the politics plots, S1 is incredibly grating to sit through, especially when Team Trinity is on screen
I outright dropped S1 on my first watch and didn't get back to it until I had seen half of the S1 final battle in clips
You either love S1 or have an awful time with it, which is precisely why I don't recommend it as a starting point for newcomers, since there's more or less a 50% chance of them going "what is this shit"
Yeah, it's extremely hit or miss
CB as an organization is so incredibly doormat for nominally wanting to change the world, half of the time the pilots have an idea of what to do, the answer is just Veda said no, without any explanation _why_ Veda said no
The show keeps setting up cool things, but stops itself from doing anything with them because of vague comments about The Plan™️
the pacing is really really frustrating for the first three quarters of it
You kinda need to know what you are in for with 00 S1
I fucking hated 00 S1
See here's the thing
Mostly because Wing has so many other dubious things besides those two making ???? decisions
Oh yeah, if you want something more like Build Fighters, I can actually in good faith recommend Beginning G, it's the first animated iteration on the same concept, 40 minute OVA that honestly has a lot of heart to it
The manga goes way beyond that and S2 sets up a lot of things for plot points from that, but for want of an S3, they were never resolved
When people say Thunderbolt, most of them think of the first half
Oh yeah for Thunderbolt, it'S two seasons of four eps each (or two movies if you'Re going with those), and they're kinda wildly different
alright;
08th MS Team - Vietnam war with robots. Effectively standalone, can be watched not knowing anything about Gundam. Kinda flubs its themes after the original director fucking died in a car crash, so the second half is unfortunately not as good, but it still does alright.
After War X - we are 15 years after shit went south real hard and 99% of humanity died, mercenaries trying to make their living while those still sticking to the old world are doing fascist things. Not nearly as bleak as the setting makes it sound, starts out with individually strong, but loosely connected arcs; in my opinion works really well for the kind of story X is, but opinions differ on that a lot. Probably the best romance in Gundam, don't watch the next episode previews, they're horrible and take all tension out of what's coming up
Turn A - looks and feels like a Ghibli movie. Very whimsical, really cool world that gets a lot of time to explore. Only real complaint is that some arcs kinda end up not going anywhere, but pretty much as feelgood as a war drama can get
G - martial arts tournament with robots. Looks very zany and there's fair disagreement over how respectful the stereotyped designs are, but it has some very solid character arcs 
ReRise - Isekai MMO anime that's secretly about grief. First half kinda slow, second half really packs some punches
Thunderbolt - the most high density horrible and squick Gundam ever gets, but very pretty to look at and the fight choreography is incredible. Also very short.
It is genuinely not worth the time committment, and some of the entries are real stinkers
Being on the track to having watched all of animated Gundam, I can firsthand tell you to not watch all of animated Gundam
I cannot speak to 79 as an entry point because I bounced off of it hard when I tried to use it as such, but I also went about it in a decidedly less than ideal way
three
I can give you an elevator pitch for each of these, see which ones sound like a good time to you
As a blanket scattershot, I tend to recommend, in no particular order, 08th MS Team, After War X, Turn A, Build Fighters, G, IBO, ReRise, Thunderbolt and now Witch as a "most people are going to enjoy at least one of these", but they're all fairly different in vibe and it largely comes down to which aspects you enjoyed out of the ones you've seen
Heavily depends on your taste
Age-2 by itself is a 13 episode show, and I certainly got an afternoon worth of enjoyment out of it
Up until the final battle of 2, after that char clone happened
I really like what they did with Zeheart
No, I think that Age-2 is worth watching ultimately
The ZZ equivalent starts out strong but takes the hardest nosedive I have ever seen an anime take, and the CCA equivalent is just kind of insult to injury
The Zeta equivalent I'd put down as a pretty confident 8/10 robot show in a vacuum, has some nice character arcs and, while nothing special, sticks to its guns and nails it pretty well
the 79 equivalent is kind of a nothingburger, to the point that the compilation movies just skip it entirely
It's very clearly gunning for a 79-CCA reimagining in each of its parts, to varying degrees of success
Very much so
It's three and a half shows stacked in a trenchcoat pretending to be one, and only one and a third of those are actually good
Age is a very odd case
Show it's from kinda sucks by the time it shows up, but oh well
Age-FX is quite a nice design

Well I have excellent news for you
Well, bar the ||fakeout asteroid drop to cause a global blackout to reveal Veda's location when Fon the people literally running the world didn't know yet||, that one was hard bullshit
The only reason I put 00F incrimentally higher than Astray is because if you zoom out, the larger plot makes sense to have happened in between season, just not all done by the same guy
And the implied romance plot with Fon "case study in why not to make your char clone your protagonist" Spaak felt really uncomfortable for so many reasons
I didn't like the catgirl Haro gimmick
Eeeeh
Oh and he also has a bomb collar go off on his neck and he survives it for ????? reasons
He's openly against the goals of his own organization, in spite of that the only one who ever gets to pilot any of the four (4) Gundams that his cell has, everyone hates his guts except they all like him, he gets to backstab as he wants with no repercussions and he figures out _the_ main mystery of S2 years before anyone else in the show does
Unfortunately, and I do not use this term lightly, the protagonist is a textbook asshole Mary Sue
It's a story set in between S1 and S2 following a support unit of CB
00F
honestly best decision Destiny made
Like, you don't need to have seen ZZ to understand Marida's past
They do, but most of it is pretty self-explanatory/explained to the extent that it matters to the story
Dub-wise or
Unicorn doesn't really need much context beyond "shit happened before" to still get a solid chunk out of the story
you really don't tbh
Or barely remember it, I once had a debate with someone who was adamant that it sucks as a story, but did not remember the existence of the most important set of episodes for every single character arc
Coming mostly from people who have not even seen it
yeah, there's a weird hate cult for Seed in the west
I really like the dynamics of the main four
tbh it's more like they would not get it to line up themselves, and the payoff, as cool as it would be from a nerding out over details angle, would be dubious relative to effort spent
The early show is a slog to get through, but I am quite fond of the 20s and 30s especially
Personally, I think Seed gets good at around ep 20 with at least a third, at most all but three episodes before that point being honestly skippable
Seed is flawed, but has some really good spots
I mean, all you really need to know about Gundam's grasp on economics is the fact that people keep building giant, ressource-intensive warships that still go down in a single hit from armements common on much smaller machines
Oh there's Iski, I was just about to bring up how you have opinions on Gundam nuclear physics <:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
I mean fair
Which is to say, not even surface level
Sapph I can guarantee that you would not like it, because it would guaranteed hold up to as much scrutiny as the rest of Gundam stats
IBO kiiiiinda has it as a minor plot point with Mars and now Venus having been colonized for ressources, but that's stretching it
Although granted, it would probably spell disaster on either the worldbuilding or the theming to make it into a plot point
That's a good point, the economics of war is the only aspect of it that no show ever really went into
The aforementioned friend still ponders over some stuff from the show, and occasionally still finds some really cool shit that noone seems to have noticed before
yeah, it produces an aura of mystique that makes for a lot of really dedicated people talking abour it for a long time
At least in the show, the hidden lore of the movies unfortunately has a lot more direct bearing on the characters by all indication we have
Which, granted, is kind of tangential to the story
At the time, while Eva was really successful, it was not yet apparent how much of a lasting popularity it would have
Well, from the perspective of the creators, it was just some fun pieces of trivia
Oh no, it's an excellent show with or without the extra info
Which, granted, is not that unusual for a show of the time, it's just that Eva's case is more peculiar both in its relative obtuseness and the popularity it gained since
nope, that's how it is
To the tune of "around 2000, ||Yui being in control of Unit 01 when it goes berserk|| was a hotly controversial idea"
I'm good friends with one of the people who was at the spearhead of getting all that info straight when Eva first made it into the english-speaking sphere, she has some STORIES to tell
NGE2 and Classified Info has SO MANY things on the deeplore, but some of it is just objectively incorrect
Even worse, how much lore is hidden in a video game spinoff that in part actively contradicts the show
or black moon, can never get the two straight
yeah, it's the cavity left by the white moon
yep
Yeah, also an actual plot point on how Nerv's internal budget all goes to the robot, so the infrastructure cuts a lot of corners
It gets mentioned a few times, but never any actual figures
Narratively, that role is entirely on Athrun, he's the one who gets more attention than either of the two, is the only one involved with both sides and the only one to have some actual character arcs ~~at least ones that don't consist of "stops acting horribly out of character compared to the original"~~, and rightfully still is on the eyecatches, but he doesn't get the white suit, so everything around still tries really hard to pretend he isn't the lynchpin of the story in more ways than one
Destiny also has the very unique problem of having two different poster children for main protag, neither of which are the de facto protag
I'd have taken Shinn even being blatantly wrong if he'd been written with some sort of sunk cost fallacy or convincing himself that Zaft was still the lesser evil or that the fashy shit can be sorted out after the war is won, but worse than being wrong, he's wrong because he's an idiot
Rewatcjed YuYuYu S1 with a friend who hadn't seen it yet; my overall opinion on it didn't hugely change, but I definitely had a better time watching than first time around. Probably gona add them to the list of customs, so rip my time and money
How am I only now noticing that Flip Flappers flashback!Salt is voiced by McGillis
Have not seen I want to eat your pancreas, heard good things about it
That sounds fair
It's the haha funny boobs man show, but it knows how to deliver a gut punch when it wants to
Has some of the best character writing and portrayal of trauma I have seen in anime
and Pacific Rim, that's basically just live action anime so I'm counting it here
The shows I have down as 10/10s (which doesn't mean that there is nothing I would change about them, just that there is little structural complaints I have and that they have left a significant impact on me and often times made me a better/happier person than I was before), in no particular order;
gear S1, both continuities of Eva as a whole entity (my rating for the individual components of NTE is lower, but the whole is more than the sum of its parts in my opinion), Madoka, both seasons of Gundam IBO, both seasons of Code Geass, S1 and arguably also S2 of 86, Grave of the Fireflies and specifically S1 and S3 of Highschool DxD
(mind you, on the whole I still think that 08th is a solid 9/10 show)
I almost find 11 worse than it
I don't think 12 is that egregious honestly
I find the second half of 08th noticeably weaker than the first half in general; the director that took over after the original one unfortunately died didn't quite have the same touch or grasp on the themes
Noted.
After General whatstheirface in OG Mazinkaiser, I would not be surprised by any amount of dubious character archetypes anymore
Aah, gotcha
Even the entries from Getter and Mazinger that I actually liked ~~yes, all two of them~~ had a severely flawed at the best of times grasp on anything relating to mental health and self-image, most of the others being SIGNIFICANTLY worse
I somehow do not trust a piece of media with Go Nagai's involvement being able to pull off anything even tangentially related to genderbending things
Oh I see the precise brand of Tomino this is now
Okay, gotcha. The version I was told was more along the lines of "if you fight for any reason, you are just as guilty as the rest of them", which.... sounded sketch, but I've seen the kind of shit that Tomino puts in his shows during his blackpill phases
It might be a severely uncharitable read of an aggressive Tominoism, but the version I heard sounded extremely ||pacifism of idiots|| in a way that is kind of surprisng since the one thing I cannot hold against Tomino Gundam is that it never fell into that particular trap, but at the same time I've seen Tomino have enough assorted bad takes pre-Turn A that I'm not gonna categorically rule it out
I know some spoilers for the ending, which.... if the message at the end has been communicated to me correctly I am not sure I ever want to watch it
same
yeah everyone I know who has seen Ideon (apart from Melua, who I am certain has seen it, but I don't recall her ever talking about it) fell either into a camp of "it's alright, bar some Tominoisms" or would not shut up about it, no inbetween
Being good at magic because you were good at programming pre-isekai is a fun idea
I watched the first episode of it a while back, I think I'd have found it a lot more enjoyable if the friend I was watching with didn't insist on the German dub
I personally wouldn't recommend anyone to start UC on Unicorn because it's honestly pretty mid, but even if you have no clue about the precise specifics of what came before, I feel it gives enough hints that anyone paying attention can figure out enough of the bigger picture to have a workable understanding of what's going on
It's not a Diebuster situation where the whole thing is meaningless without the context from the previous, so long as there's a basic understanding of this is not the first time a war like this has happened, most things post-CCA can be watched with relatively few strings attached
It is, but I don't think the ties are strong enough that the wotks can't stand on their own
Loud and clear
whoops caps
tHAT SOUNDS FAIR; YEAH
https://twitter.com/PachiPortrait/status/1620240712389505024
Sentinel is kinda alright as a story, but it's probably the most thoughtful tech exploration that Gundam has had
much, yeah
I also call mad bullshit on the idea that the ZZ wouldn't be able to hold a beam magnum
I don't mind the concept of the beam magnum, but I'd much rather have had the conclusion been the firepower is neat, but it eats so much energy per shot that you could do much more with a smaller gun that can hit more targets for the same e-cap cost
I hate the fucking motorcycles but yes, the long cannons were awesome
The first one was already stretching the economic suspension of disbelief, but NT just nukes it from orbit
But the NZ is material cost of multiple battleships even before the psychoframe
I don't mind the second Sinanju because sure, just steal one from anaheim
The fact that the Sleeves just have a second Neo Zeong around
Actually, I'm gonna say that there is one dumber thing in NT
And it's so much more sensible
Supplemental material has exactly that
see that's the thing
Which, the BM's recoil wrecking any non-psycho frame suit is already a tall order as far as dumb plot points go
it is
Vigilante was good, yeah
Like, just have a suit carry some spare hands in case one gets wrecked by enemy fire and a little subarm to replace it
I'm all for replacement limbs, but please have it be for a sane reason, and not for this horseshit
It's pretty up there, yeah
The Phenex is the most likeable character in the movie
I like to describe most Getter shows as "three assholes in a robot", NT is three assholes _and_ a robot
I'd only disagree in so far as I think calling Narrative mid is a bit too generous
neat designs, some good ideas but a lot of ??? decisions, more up its own ass than it probably should have been
I don't hate Unicorn, but it certainly was the Gundam show of all time
And honestly yeah, kinda tracks
it is
So I just found out that the Code Geass game (that is apparently shutting down?) not only had ||a genetically engineered clone child for Lelouch/CC, Lelouch/Kallen and Lelouch/Suzaku, but also what appears to be one for Lelouch/Nunally <:KirikaDisgust:688431636043268097>||
on the list it goes
<:TsubasaNote:689554460044820608>
welp
...oooo the Mk V has a Robot Spirits
it also has double cheek vulcans, which is always sex
oh no, it's great, but it does look very feral
Given that the Mk III and Mk V are also both kin of freak designs, I don't hate it
There is? I was not aware, huh
and yeah, Mk. IV only has the G Gen design, which at this point I'm fairly sure is gonna be the canon one, if one ever is
I actually have an HG Ex-S coming in today, although it won't officially be mine until my birthday in May
oh yeah, the heads are incredible
> While the face of a Gundam was usually viewed as a savior, the Mk. V's current facial expression was hardly a merciful one.
> While Task Force Alpha may at first have seemed like an elite unit, it was composed of inexperienced captains and prototype mobile suits that lost military contract bids — a unit of paper tigers.
Also, re:Sentinel; I will give it credit for having two of the coolest mood-setting sentences in Gundam novels
I don't actually mind the end of Unicorn, the last two movies were the only ones that I actively enjoyed
That is true
New Asumichan was fun
noted.
How gay and/or mecha is precure on average?
Or at least, trying really hard to appeal to the fanboys who will not shut the fuck up about how the robot is god and could totally kill that other robot
tbh a lot of post-80s Go Nagai media kinda is
duly noted
But yeah, I partially grew up on Power Rangers, I can handle some camp
Oh lmao they are actually fighting? That's something that I've always heard as the opposite
I'm gonna go into this as blind as I can
The only thing I know about Revue is that it's theater lesbians
lmao, amazing
But yes, duly noted
I mean Eva and Code Geass are two of my most beloved shows, so I can handle some of that lmao
I've been meaning to check it out for a while, but that would make it jump up the list a fair bit
This chat reads to me like Revue has stakes that go places?
Although, gotta give it credit for one thing
I respect the committment to the bit and the aesthetic
The entire thing reads like a systematic character assassination of what little was there to begin with, and yet it appears to have been written with nothing but glowing adoration for Wing
But yeah like
oh yeah, Prometheus is cool
Qatre is now head scientist for an arms manufacturer
Treize got reincarnated as the child of Zechs and Noin (or something? Might have been someone else's child, but those two did bang)
Heero had his memories wiped and he wants to kill Relena again and might also have been in cryosleep because he still looks like a child
Relena has decided that the way to ensure peace is to implant a bomb in everyone that goes off when she dies and kills all of humanity, because clearly she will die the next time there is a war, so they put her into cryosleep to avoid that
It's.... a lot
..right, that happened
In no small part because the plot is near incomprehensible
It is near incomprehensibly bad
Frozen Teardrop
And then the next sequel happens that is such unhinged dogwater that not even the hardcorest of fanboys acknowledge it
And then at the end they conclude to throw away their weapons again in a way that will definitely not be recoverable, because _surely_ this time, everyone did the same
EW has the next faction of fascists come along and two thirds of the movie deals with oops, we have no weapons, what do we do, we kinda need those
Wing ends on the note of "if you throw down all your weapons, the fascists will do so as well and leave you alone", which is obviously not how that works
In a way it is, but EW is dumber in the sense that it actively deals with the problem caused by Wing's terrible politics and then concludes that they were right all along and don't need to do anything different
EW's politics are impressively bad even by the already abysmal standard of Wing
yeah
In my experience 98% of people who really like Wing fall into either the camp of "seen it as a kid on toonami and hasn't actually gone back to see if it holds up" or in the camp of "really wants the pretty boys to bang"
I don't think anyone who isn't wearing heavy rosetint actually likes it for its story
EW looks pretty and has, for the most part, good shot direction
EW honestly isn't worth its runtime for its plot, but it does have very pretty animation, and this has most of the glory shots in it
It's an AMV over Wing's best song, with all of the good scenes from EW
Watch this instead
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xisV4MxhP9Y
Hold on
Especially Last Impression
oh no, don't watch Gundam Wing, but do listen to the music
Listen to Just Communication again with this knowledge
yes
I'm still not over the fact that Kanade sung the Gundam Wing openings
MAL sometimes really does feel like knowledge not meant to be accessible to humans
https://twitter.com/wingsyo345/status/1621476577363267585 lmao
After 49 episodes of Athrun being the de facto protag, but the show pretending he wasn't
I agree, yeah. Gave the IJ and Athrun an opportunity to properly show off that they're a force to be reckoned with
I do not know if it is just as boring to actually read as Anima is, and I do not intend to find out
It is the only officially published tie-in work that as a summary reads more unhinged than Eva anima
It's a complete clusterfuck, I can't even keep track of half of the bullshit in it
oh yeah that also happens
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGNPslvuUE0 the op for the one tie-in thing that it got goes really fucking hard
Pretty good video essay all in all. Couple of blind spots, but the core thesis does hold water I think
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0t9WxLx5pps
also this shot is really good
The way they introduce him as a known quantity when he isn'T is very funny to me
lol
"It's been a while since we've flown in the same sky" is a really good line
I'm beginning to understand what y'all meant by Strikers starts very slowly
oh no the spear speaks German
...is this Griffith person not in the movies or did I fully forget about his existence
It's such a cute touch how Nanoha, Fate and Hayate each have their unique tie on their uniform
🏳️‍🌈❓
Hearing Fate's not-quite-Tsubasa-but-almost voice keeps tripping me up
cannot put this any other way, that episode felt like a MySpace page
they sure do
lel
This is gonna be A RIDE isn't it
first time seeing one in the wild
AND A FUCKING SPONSOR MESSAGE
Sure, don't see a lot of those around
....1:45 opening
should I take this as an omen
lmao I wanted to start watching Nanoha Strikers and my local provider doesn't even have an episodes tab 💀
But moment to moment yeah, he's not particularily outstanding
I faintly remember him pulling some fairly clever stuff on the moon in the first fights against the Turn X
He's pretty good on his tactical thinking, that does make up for a lot
Off the top of my head, he never does anything particularily impressive that wasn't the G-Self's abilities over his own
Bellri
Actually no, I did forget one
You could maybe make a case for Banagher, but as dumb as the Suppressor is, he does do quite well in it
Even Shiro, who isn't outstanding as far as skill goes, is a tough opponent just by virtue of his recklessness and quick wits
Although by the same token, apart from the 0080 cast where it's kinda the point, Ryou Roots from Sentinel and maybe Kou, you'd be hard-pressed to find any Gundam protags who aren't absolutely terrifying pilots to fight for one reason or another by the time they're at the end of their show
And I did really like the premise of Shinn being an angry kid who points his anger at the wrong thing, but Destiny did its level best to dance around that point and address that as little as possible
To be fair, Kira is terrifying to fight even if he won't kill you unless you _really_ have it coming
One of their high end figure lines
Because Chogokins are massive and with a lot of die cast metal
I'm an idiot
wait shit, wrong robot lmao
SR-X figure
<:BigBossSalute:472805458768560129>
That short rules
I have a very big sweet spot for this aesthetic of CG scifi
I'm mildly puzzled
I have not, at least not to a degree that would prompt this reaction
Also I swear I've heard Signum's voice before somewhere but I looked through her entire list of characters she voiced and there was noone in there who I've seen a meaningful amount of
That scene of Teana fucking up could have hit really good if it had just been shot a tad differently
This show could really use the movie remake treatment, pacing is kinda rough
and I mean, the first time we see them in Strikers is the two of them and Hayate waking up in the same bed
yea
you're not _wrong_
I mean
Is this like a Kabbalah symbol for God or something
Between this, Geass and Shem-Ha, we have a pattern here
okay that symbol has to be from _somewhere_
lmfao the evil doc is called Jail
<:MikuCute:672908542763859968>
did not see that one coming
HUH
Holup StrikerS doesn't take place on Earth?
I forgot how much of a scrimblo Vita was
...time for more Nanoha'ing
I was thinkinh the entire time that something felt off, but yeah, that's it, where is Alph
Wait hold on, you raise a good point show, where the fuck _is_ Alph
I mean you're not wrong
Not what I had on my bingo card, but sure
I see we doing fascist strongman movements now
well then. Sure thing Subaru
*muffled Komm süßer Tod coming from the other room*
Stuck the landing well enough
Okay I THINK this time it'S actually the end of the arc
why do I say things
I am really hoping that Subaru and/or Teana isn't gonna go on her Shinn arc over this
....me and my big mouth
And yeah, the start had a lot of.... why is this given so much screentime
NEvermind, that was only the fake conclusion, the actual one was good
I am not positive I agree with StrikerS coming out of this arc with the conclusion of "the answer to trying too hard is more training montages"
Status quo good, punching down, anti-intellectualism behind a veil of hashtag nerdy references
It goes in the same angle as what I was trying to get at
Prolly gonna be some Ready Player One nonsense
yeah I do not trust LN writers with that one
nah, even at its worst, animated CE isn't that trashy
Same over here, game is also called werewolf
Ooooh yeah that makes sense
There's one time in X Astray where a lady who actively wants to kill him lets him use her manufacturing plant free of charge without even getting insight into what he's using them for because, and I quote, "He's interesting"
I do not use this term lightly, but Lowe is one of the few Mary Sue characters that Gundam has; plots just solve themselves by power of his presence
And it also has a horrible habit of shoehorning either Lowe himself or the Red Frame as his proxy into quite literally every event of any sort of relevance, no matter how little sense it makes or how much it worsens the story if taken at face value
Just leaving them to be scavenged not so much
That one makes sense as a plot point
Wellll the ones in Seed were not so much given out to as much as being buzilt by the same contractor who used the tech for their own purposes
The mass driver that was at the core of the best arc of the show? Yeah they had another one that was also attacked, but don't worry, it floats so noone will be able to track it down, despite us just having finished fighting off the people who did track it down
Freedom, Justice and Providence? Yeah they had another one, they threw it out fully functionally including the anti-anti nuke tech and a 12 year old picked it up
The plot point of "there was more that noone cared about" being liberally applied to every other plot beat in Seed
Astray's premise is that there were two/three/five/n more that noone cared about and some civilian found and picked them up
Let me put it to you this way, you know the base premise of Seed, the five Gundams that were target of the heist?
but definitely on the bad part
not really, at least not on the G part
The ones that don't have Astray in their name are a bit better, but even those aren't great
They are _famously_ shit
Seed sidestories are best left ignored
That's an odd nickname
But yeah, Ignited (was that the name of the project? I think that was the name of the project) definitely should not try to recapture the plots that made the OG work, it's gonna fall on its face if it does
I am....... very puzzled by the decision to forego Athrun on that picture in favor of nine dead people
110% gonna have one
Evil Gundam trio
...wait no, I forgot one thing
Also akatsuki 2 would be cool to see, but optional at the end of the day
Just give me big dumb robot fanservice
same
It's gonna be a nothing plot, but have a good battle
But yeah, cold read on what the plot is gonna be: Another Le Creuset clone shows up and does CCA things, gathers the old Zaft radicals underneath him to really stick it to the Alliance this time because that worked out so incredibly well the last two times, first third of the movie is gonna be disagreement between the main... five or six at this point in what exactly to do about it, 50/50 on there being a fight between them that wrecks the SF or IJ and prompts the suit upgrade, last third to half of the movie is just gonna be the big battle, maybe one of the Three Ships Alliance vessels is gonna go down, but probably without anyone we care about dying in the process, Le Creuset clone dies talking about how he regrets not having things done differently, ends on a shot either in space surrounded by bits of wreckage or looking out to sea, the sun on screen in its entirety for either option
reads to me more like a Striker Pack thing
sorry
oh shit, you're right, I did see those tweets way back, completely slipped my mind
fair enough lol
EoE is the only single sequel movie to a TV format anime I've ever seen that didn't
If it tries to be clever, it's gonna suck shit
I seriously hope that it's gonna be just fanservice and doesn't try to do anything huge
Would be fun seeing Shinn in a Meteor of his own
Well, I for one am looking forward to the probably ~45 minutes of Freedom 3, Justice 3 and Destiny 2 vs Providence 3 animated/Providence 7 or something including mangas that we're gonna get for the final battle
That would be a plot detail, yes
Can you throw me a link to that if you have it on hand?
No details of plot
Oh yeah, 100% are we getting new designs, but the latest news that I'm aware of was TMR saying on some concert or another that the project is still being worked on
One of my mutuals works in Japan and gets a lot of those magazines as physicals, she'd defo have talked about that
I follow Gundam news pretty closely, I feel fairly confident that I would have come across that if those actually had been published in recent times
I think whoever you got that from was bullshitting you
Would be the first time I'm hearing of there being hard confirmation on any details for the movie
Alph is just unpersoned apart from that pne flashback there
yeah but those at least showed up or got mentioned, if by association
I'm not gonna tell you to like Destiny, but you're not making a ton of sense
I can't help but feel like you're looking for excuses to feel angry rather than actually saying the points that bother you
That's hardly supporting either side
Let it not be forgotten that the first order Cagalli gave after taking back command of Orb was to arrest Yuna for treason for sheltering whatshisface
I don't remember the airport so I'll take your word on that, but they decidedly did not support any war criminals
But don't quote me on that, international law is fucky
And as long as she's just part of the crew and not the commander, I don't think it would count either way
Cagalli at that point was exiled
that is also not a warcrime, that's just how combat at sea works irl as well
This is besides the point but legally, Kira is actually an interesting case when it comes to that, because warcrimes require a state actor, while the Archangel by that point is an irregular force
that is not a warcrime
I'm talking actual, irl Hague and Geneva convention warcrimes
Do tell what those were
And America is not precisely a good standard to measure against when trying to claim that a country doesn't do warcrimes lmao
No declaration of war still makes it a warcrime
That's a violation of multiple conventions of warfare, by the by.
Attack a neutral country without a declaration of war on suspicion of a singular person on their hit list being there
And yet
Sure, they _say_ they want to prevent conflict, just as Elon Musk says he's politically neutral
We do not see what the internal structure is after, she might just be a chancellor
You're extrapolating a lot from very little
Then Fukuda is objectively wrong
I'm German, I have a bit more hands-on sensibilities to that than people from most other countries, so trust me when I say that Zaft were not the good guys of Destiny
It is immensely worrying to me how many people fall into the exact same hole as you do and completely miss the way in which dictatorial regimes build
Miso, with all due respect, you need to get a better understanding of how propaganda works
purple brat had declared them impostors the last time
And by the time it started were officially still a hostile force to Orb
they also didn't know where he was
They were not the ones refusing to hand him over
I am aware of the second battle of Orb
They were protecting a country from being razed to the ground
Literally not a thing that happened
they didn't?
And let's not forget the fact that Durandal had someone impersonate Lacus for propaganda
Which, even taking all of that at face value, wouldn't even change anything, because it was at the end of the day still Zaft that attacked
Plausible deniability is a really bad look when dealing with fascists, real or fictional
I hate to be the one to bring up the nazis, but on paper even during WWII, Germany also still had a parliament
Much like gear keywords, gunpla manuals and the like are often times full of shit when it comes to the human causes
And SF/IJ were stolen after the war had started
Orb
I do not belive that for a second
The booklets can shove it, he's the head of an authoritative regime, no way in fuck did he not know
Remember, their entire involvement in this only started because a bunch of Zaft suits that were not even known to the public yet attacked their villa
Except that he also sends spec ops kill teams after dissenters
He's the head of an ethnostate saying that your genes should determine your future
straightup
It very much does not
When you're fightin a pair of ethnostates
I mean
It's the way in which it's bad that differs
But I mean to be fair; for all they knew, it was Durandal himself who had sent the hit team after them; that's a reasonable assumption given that he's behind Meer and the squad was quite clearly a top level hit team. Adding to that, the people they've been fighting were from units under only his direct command and Athrun himself has more than a few occurrences to tell where he was being extremely manipulative or straightup lying
thereabouts as well
but I also remember the target of the second one being some population center or another
From a tactical perspective, that one is entirely fair
I think it was a space target, yeah
I should probably at least mention that I fucking hated Destiny for most of its run, so I'm not gonna tell anyone that it's a great show
But yeah, like
a, rip
All I know for sure is that Zaft is very not the good guys in the remaster
I have not seen the original, so there may well be script changes somewhere
remaster
Yzak's squad blew up the relay point
Not for a lack of trying
And again, it openly talks about vanishing the people speaking out against it
The Destiny plan being opt-in is a bald faced lie
So the modern day education system tells you that if you want to be in a field but someone else is better at it than you, you can't be in that field?
Around the 17ish minute mark
Ep 43, Athrun
There's a German poem to that topic, let me look it up real quick
It always starts slowly and with plausible deniability, emphasizing the improvements to _the people that matter_ if you just get rid of xyz
Zaft in Destiny is quite pointedly portraying the ways in which modern day fascism rises
Dude, you're letting yourself be gaslit by a fictional character
That is very decidedly not what the show is portraying
Those are very decidedly not the same thing
But that's not a topic for the anime channel
Hell, look at how the US and Canada are still treating their indigenous populations
There's some places, yeah

I don't need the wiki article, I remember the scene rather well
Narrated to the tune of people who don't fit in/are causing trouble being taken care of
It has the little Djibril chibi who is making a scene and is then taken away
It literally does
the Destiny plan, in its sales pitch, talks about undesirables getting quietly removed
dude
The quality of the talking points is dubious, and their actions did not exactly match it
They're as much of an ethnostate as Zaft is, if more on the nose in its oppressiveness
I never once claimed that the Alliance were the good guys in any capacity
I'd very strongly argue that even an unstable peace is better than mutual destruction by WMDs
There's things and people more important to the logistics than others, but at the end of the day, it's just a matter of material thrown at the wall
Wars are won by large scale logistics, and the side that's out of logistics first loses
they just did not have the manpower to keep up a defense, much less go on any sort of offensive
And in Destiny, their main stronghold completely blew up
Because Zaft's forces were crippled in the battle
We have seen Omni having a command structure; if Djibril dies, that would likely only have accelerated the plans of bombardement, because now they'd have even more public support to reallocate ressources there
To pull another example from history, during WWII, Britain after... I believe it was 1942 ordered a stop on all domestic assassination plans for Hitler, because they thought that with him gone, the Wehrmacht would be more effective
The Alliance has a chain of command that can and will take over if their leader dies
do you actually belive that Djibril is the only guy with a key for the lasers
Miso
Or at the very least you are misidentifying the reason why you don't like something
I get that you don't like Kira, but I think you are conflating not liking something and something being bad
And also taking back control on the side, but the main priority was to prevent cities from being bombed
they were defending Orb mainland from an attack by Zaft
They... weren't fighting orb tho?
And like, you need to remember that they are in the middle of a battle and have no clue what the situation inside even is
...I think I'm gonna go back to Nanoha, that sounds like a better time than this convo
yeah, it's not that he changed, he just stopped pretending to be something else
yes, but they also built one themselves
This is not the words for an opt-in plan


It's what I've been saying the entire time
It is not optional
I cannot overstate how baffled I am that the Destiny plan seems fine to you
But in either case; Durandal, as the head of state demanding that the entire world should follow the plan he devised I'd say is ample precedent for saying yo, I don't think that we can trust this dude with world rule
When Meyrin's place was getting raided
The one before Shinn shoots him down in the Gouf
ep 39 or 40, don't remember
He was a Zaft ace and supposed to be given the Legend
But Athrun was not yet part of the Archangel again by that point
And it is in the pitch itself
I mean he did have a hit team sent after him like three episodes before that
It stands to reason that a single retreat alone is not going to affect it much if he still wins the war, as he intends on doing
It's two orders of magnitude above a retreat from a frontline
Destiny plan is not even strategical, it's societal in nature
Top of the line stuff, only available to special forces
The Ashs were explicitly units never seen before
yes, but those had units from the last war
I don't think it is unreasonable to be suspicious of Durandal under these circumstances and fight back against a large scale military campaign
Athrun expected it to be a kamikaze run, but he got picked up by Cagalli
Got tossed into the Genesis as a makeshift nuke
If you didn't pay attention to what I was saying, that's on you
I am not going to repeat all of that bullshit
*points to the past two and a half hours of conversation for arguments why that's reasonable*
I mean yeah but that's a Sans is secretly Ness level of theory
Her confrontation with Athrun in the theater was pretty well-made
Although we got some pretty cool scenes out of her scheme falling into place, so I'm not complaining too much
I don't dislike Lacus as she's portrayed on-screen, but it is a bit of a stretch that she goes from naive idol to master strategist offscreen
Presumably somewhere far off where noone with the right genes can see you
The end goal is the same
The only difference is that one side thinks you should be sent to the gas chambers for having the wrong genes and the other thinks that you should be slowly bullied out of society
^^^^^^^^
Jesus christ, I wasted a lot of time on this
It's the point I have been making for the past two and a half hours
YES AND IT IS MADE OUT AS AN EXPLICITLY BAD THING THAT ZAFT IS A COORDINATOR ETHNOSTATE
It is not a stretch to assume that the nextstep on an opt-in plan would be to visibly mark those who didn't
I think you can tell where I am going with this
You might be branded as a hindrance to the progression of humanity, as a pest to be exterminated
Or, to spin this tale a bit further
But if you do, you might well find yourself with some bricks thrown through your windows
No law forbids you from wearing pride flags in Alabama
And yes, even without any hard mandatory rules; this would still be a system of oppression
Firebombing a neutral country to flush out one guy is not proportional
Also, proportional use of force is a thing
Also bonus points, as Djibril has demonstrated, he is also not above getting the people who do actually move elsewhere
yeah, if this happened irl, I'd grab my gear and find the nearest resistance group to join
The only uncomfortable stuff in there that I remember off the top of my head were the pretty skeevy tf sequences in... I think As had the worse ones
I'm gonna suspect that the movies dialed that back a lot
.......breh
As for Vivid Strike.... I hear vanilla Vivid is awful, but I suppose at this point I might as well go for broke and finish the whole thing
As movie is definitely my favorite piece of Nanoha media I have consumed
Up until here, this is the most unremarkable show I've watched in a rather long while
StrikerS, so far, has done precisely one moderately interesting thing
I trust y'all's word that the second half is better, but
Okay I am now halfway through the show, calling it here for the night
Ah yes, new addition to the case study of why literal translations are kinda not great folder
Calling it right now
Also the cloak dude is 100% gonna die before the end of this show
Hair color checks out and number VI
I'm just gonna assume that the girl they recovered is Vivio
Well I suppose that's something at least lmao
I very hope that it's not gonna be it, but the show so far is not making me particularily optimistic in it breaking from that trend that a lot of things around its time have
12
The way it's set up is raising allll the red flags for a particular type of arc of like... 3-8 episodes of frequent enconters with the enemy girls, but never catching them while being hounded by superiors and "oh you can't do that because of this agreement" juice
Oh Strikers is gonna be One Of Those Shows, isn't it
neat
https://twitter.com/theseiyuucafe/status/1622814364398161920
Excellent show, one of my favorites
I was, yes
Oh I know some folks who are gonna adore this
I enjoyed it a lot more on a rewatch, but without the sheer force of ep 6 pulling it together, I don't think the show would have been particularily impactful or memorable to me
Yeah, dito. I certainly won't say that they made the right decision, but I wasn't super impressed by Gunbuster on my first watch until I hit ep 6
Yeah, apart from the forehead, this design really fucks
TTGL with a sword is an interesting choice
Ignoring/ridding my feed of it is definitely what I'm going to do for most of them, but The Discourse is still going to be rather annoying
Unfortunately, some of them hang around in otherwise very pleasant gunpla places and are beyond that quite productive to talk to and not obnoxious enough to warrant a block
That sounds both surprising that it took this long to happen and like the actual worst thing to happen to the IP because now all of the insufferable manchildren who will not shut up about how their favorite mecha is god and can totally kill all those other robots will have an entire story dedicated to it even harder than Zero was
Vestige is still pretty mid, but at least it scans as an op
yeah, there's a good reason they changed it for the remaster
Not to my knowledge, no
And while I by no stretch dislike the ops (apart from Wings of Words, that one really didn't have any business being an opening), they do tend to get weaker over time
The endings are incredible, as far as I'm concerned, they're consistently better than the ops
Realize is the only one to break that trend, but Invoke is still just kinda better
right, I forgot about Realize
Both it and Destiny start with a banger op and then just get continually worse openings every time there's a permanent change
yeah that's a running theme with Seed
Victory has a host of problems with its portrayal of politics (mostly Tomino trying to work out if he really likes or really hates women), but going easy on fascism is not one of them
It's kinda the whole reason why the LM exists at all
Victory I'd argue is another separate case, because the Feds did fight Zanscare where they could, but they were too preoccupied eith falling apart over something unspecified to have even half a grasp on Earth anymore
Yeah but those are not precisely small or handwaveable
Meanwhile Missing Link for example has the Fed squad defecting to join up with Zeon forces framed as their big moment of heroism
Yes, but it still portrayed the side as a whole as bad and needing to be fought
It is, unfortunately, no coincidence that the Sleeves' plan is 1:1 the pre-war plan of Imperial Japan
And the ultimate result of it kinda is Unicorn, where they got a pretty hardline imperialist to write the anti-imperialist story, and it rather shows
not used as a framing device to make the Crossbone Vanguard more sympathetic; I don't have any problem at all with making the faceless megagovernment a bad guy, far from it, but Zeon is, and should be, decidedly worse, which is something a lot of sidestories fail to adress, intentionally or otherwise
Zeta still portrayed Neo Zeon as not great people, but the further out you go in UC media releases, the more you get into the territory of "but what if Feds bad mean Zeon good"
I don't think it is, no
That is pretty much what happened; prime example would probably be the final combat episode of 08th, which is also.... not great in how it throws its hands up and proclaims that clearly the two sides are equal and one cannot render moral judgement, or the entire clusterfuck that is Missing Link. While the Feds absolutely had their share of sketchiness before, 0083 started the trend of sidestories falling for the whataboutisms of making the Feds look worse to justify why Zeon wasn't that bad actually, when at worst, it should be a "they both suck"
(brb)
not in-universe, release-wise
..disregard Blue Destiny, that one came after
Compare, say, Blue Destiny and Sentinel to Missing Link and Unicorn
Yeah, but there is a rather noticable difference between how pre-0083 side content portrays its politics vs how post-0083 sidestories do
Especially when Gato's nuke launch was framed the same way a heroic victory would be, contrasted by the majority of Feddie officers we see being blatantly horrible
Yeah, but there's still a difference between pretty cap and "firing on their own troops with a WMD"
As the franchise portrays them, they are, but that's kind of the lynchpin of my gripes with 0083, so much of that goes back to the decisions that Stardust made
It's one of the very few Gundam shows that fails the litmus test of "does it portray the fascists as the bad guys that need to be fought"
I'd have minded Stardust a lot less if it didn't try its absolute hardest to frame it as a conflict on morally equal footing
But so are the designs in Victory, Stardust and Wing, and none of those are good <:Ver:704169051391524875>
Oh yeah, the actual design is really good
Tomino clearly had ideas for F91 that he wasn't able to put in, so he reused them in Victory with fairly little fanfare, where the majority of them were just kind of drawn-out and grating, which given that despite its breakneck pace I already found F91 to border on boring for a lot of its run, giving the same plot more runtime I don't think would have made results significantly better
And if you look at other things Tomino made around the same time, most prominently Victory and how many of the same plot beats it covers, I think we can make a pretty educated guess on what a full length F91 would have felt like, and it is not looking great
Cosmo Babylonia is kind of a nonstarter of an antagonist faction and short of some oh they weren't the REAL ANTAGONIST FACTION, which.... probably wouldn't have been great in its own right, I don't see them pulling their weight for even a 12 episode show, let alone a 50 episode one
I honestly don't think that a TV F91 would have been much better
Wallet itai
Chisato's gun 1:1 airsoft replica
oh no
https://twitter.com/TM_Airsoft/status/1624951731254861825?
Oh she's also Mikumo, that tracks
But yeah, there's definitely at least two or three reception studies research papers in the topic of how Gundam alone portrays fascism
For the record I don't in the slightest disagree with your reasoning, but unfortunately, the shapes of the design are rather cool <:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
Either would be fair
The game, the design or both?
But yeah, as much as I love the Pale Rider, absolute trash garbage storyline
Surprised I didn't know that one
huh.
I feel like Blue Destiny, while definitely going in that direction, still manages to somewhat walk the same line as Zeta or Sentinel did where yeah, it was always there, but it wasn't going nearly as overt on saying that this is why the Feds are _worse_, just that they're not the white knights they'd like to see themselves as
Wasn't Missing Link early PS3?
I'd say Missing Link does a lot worse than Igloo while (at least in my more committed circles, don't have a good insight in how it is for the more casual fans) being similarily known, but I admittedly have not seen all of Igloo
A lot of post-80s UC does very much come from what is the setting equivalent of wehraboos getting the writer's seat
G Gundam, defo
And yes, gratingly hamfisted nationalism
The unironic best episode is straight filler
KKS S2 is the most violently mid piece of media I have ever consumed
It feels very trying too hard
I feel like that's the problem most people have with the name
That sounds like youtube autocaptions for yodelling
yeah, that
It's remarkable how on target they are, not just with Bocchi, but with the rest of the cast as well
I handle myself pretty well in social situations, and even I got hit dead on by the show a couple of times
I don't think that part is even necessary to have
There's a lot of it that is just callout posts
Oh yeah, the show definitely does swing that bat
Even if it isn't your genre at all (it certainly isn't exactly mine), I'd say it's worth a watch
It's a quite fun show; highlight reels don't really get across how endearing it is
~~not like Gundam doesn't already have a problem with people outwardly missing the point it's making~~
Personally I feel like the whole communication through fists thing reads a bit more charitable than glorified toxic masculinity because it is only ever shown in the explicit context of two consenting parties with the same approach and problems at communicating, and the times that they do the same with anyone not on that wavelength is very pointedly a fuckup on their part, but I can't and won't try to dispute that it very easily reads as that, and even more so can be effortlessly constructed into that by someone who wants it to read as that, so the show arguably should have taken a bit more care on that end
I wouldn't quite put it as a 10/10 show, but G is a confident 9/10
Animation could be better, pacing is kind of odd at times, there's one arc that feels tacked on and one theme is iffy on closer inspection is a pretty fucking good tally of complaints for a 50 episode show
But yeah, like
I'd add the final arc feeling kid of tacked on and the show probably being better if they had rolled the plot threads concluded in that arc forwards into what was clearly intended to be the finale of the show to that list
Yanase is the guy who, among other things, designed the non-Exia lineage 00 Gundams
......okay no, I hate it here
"They don't know I'm [x]" meme here
Oh lmao, same
The /sh/ is much more slurred in English than in German
although the pronounciation is different
It sure does not lmao
yeah, that's where the name came from, it just happens to be a very unfortunate name in German <:GenjuroLaugh:689563633516150872>
Great name to give to your healer elf
Mist means dung in German.
Dung.
I still remember a video I watched ages ago making a big deal about how some jrpg or another was """censored""" in Germany for renaming a character from "Mist" to something else, because ooooh, it's an obscene word there, they wouldn't allow it
Can't wait for the new wave of people """reporting on censored media""" getting upset about that one <:Ver:704169051391524875>
I don't have any horse in this, I don't care about Jojos whatsoever beyond the occasional piece of music crossing my feed, but I definitely get the complaint
Too selkf-referential, haha, look at the Jojo that is also a Dio
But it's fun sparkles, sooo
Kinda, yeah
This just shot up to "might actually give it a shot"
Ooooh mystery solver story
No clue what is going on there, but it sure looks pretty
I should get back to that, watched the first ep when it aired and completely fell off of it
....I'm gonna end up watching all of Sailor Moon, aren't I
||Literally just a demolition charge would have fulfilled the same purpose better||
The ||second Memento Mori|| might actually be the stupidest plot point in Gundam that I can recall off the top of my head
The character stuff is stll fine for the most part but GOD
I did not remember the details of the politics being this fucking stupid
Friend of mine is rewatching 00 S2
The Fullarmor/Psycho Zaku were the first UC designs I got as kits
Has some very sexy mechanical design, too
I wouldn't put it as my favorite in any category, but it does alright all in all and looks extremely pretty while doing so
yeah, that
True. Although in the case of the Monster, it is kind of prohibitively large to do in the same scale xD
Here's hopium
Tbf we've only gotten the jank 1/72 scale ones so far, if all goes well that may change with the HGs
But yeah, a squad of Alto/Ozma Armored, Mikhail/Luca Super, Brera Lucifer and Klan Q-Rhea in HG form would be really nice
The first deployment of the König Monster in Frontier was pretty cool
I really want a full squad for Frontier and Delta
Having the battroids posed in the back up on stands and the pilot suits standing before them would look pretty awesome
I really hope that the HGs do well and we get a lot of them
I was thinking Frontier Skull Squad, not OG, but holds true for either
Oh no, I wouldn't do it in the same scale, I have neither the money nor the shelf space for that lmao
And tbf if I was like 15% more into Macross, I'd be very tempted to try and get a Skull Squadron like that
If this does well, I assume there will be one for all of the VFs that got one of those big scale nose models
Articulated, too
https://www.goodsmile.info/en/product/13998/PLAMAX+MF+69+minimum+factory+Alto+Saotome+with+VF+25F+Decal+Set.html Huh, Alto pilot figure for the giant VF cockpits
(at least for German, don't know about the pronounciation in Dutch)
ä is kind of like pronouncing a and e at the same time, so Kase doesn't read as Käse; Kese-san might tho depending on the dialect
Not really, no
Oh shit it's Okami Mio /s
I did, ||Blitz going down to Josh-A||
I am not wasting another two and a half hours on this
I don't think you are in a position to talk about how it does or doesn't handle themes
You literally admitted to not remembering a thing about the most important arc of Seed
My guy
Miso
It's a weird feeling
Must be, yeah
This is like a visceral _I know your voice from somewhere_
Have not consumed enough SRW to have an association that strong there
I'm having a significantly better time with Strikers, but it is paced like Victory Gundam, which is not a good thing
But yeah, after this I think I'm good on TV-format Nanoha, if not in general then at least for a good while
Short of working under an alias has to be that, yeah
No, I've checked her game roles, none on there either
It's such a weird feeling; I'm usually pretty good at recognizing specific accent and intonation, so I'm fairly certain that this isn't just me mistaking a similar voice; it's kind of a wild feeling lol
Nope
That's enough of that for the day. Looks like within the next handful of episodes, there will finally be things actually happening
Someone forgot about adoption and contemplated mechanics they shouldn't have <:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
lmao
I'm starting to suspect that it might be from a vtuber somewhere, but the implications of that are enough to make me want to not touch that thought with a ten foot pole
It keeps tripping me up that I know Signum's voice from _somewhere_, but have seen none of the other shows she's listed for on MAL
The +5 minutes on each episode are not helping matters there, either
The pacing of this is.... it's not quite _glacial_, but it's not too far off of that, either
Apart from Tea's one arc, the show kinda hasn't really done anything of particular interest
I don't hate it, but ngl it ain't great so far
Okay that was married couple banter if I've ever seen some
Not even mentioned as helping out around the house 😂
I mean yeah, but even Chrono and Ferret boy had a speaking appearance at least
They really gonna do her dirty like that
I am more than halfway through StrikerS and Alph still has not shown up once outside of a still image flashback
more or less
oo new op
Last two I watched, 16/17
true lmao
Those last two eps popped the fuck off, holy shit
...nevermind, I thought the show was smarter than it actually was
Okay gotta give the bad guys credit, that plan was good
Sure Nanoha, the kid who calls you mama and yries whenever you leave is just libing with you temporarily and you is definitely gonna find another family to live with after <:sip:907618138168901694>
Alright if this were anyone other than Nanoha herself, this would be a death flag and a half
I really gotta go and watch S1 now, do I
It's a similar story for the G-Arcane now that I think of it; it's informedly an exceedingly powerful sniper/artillery machine, but we basically never get to see it displaying that potential outside of the first launch with the Full Dress in favor of more G-self gimmicks
I really like what the machine stands for, it can go toe to toe with all the flashy super robot bullshit of the Perfect Pack while still having reasonably normal armaments that you'd for the most part expect to see in any other show as well, it gives the battles a tangible scale that they otherwise sorely lack
The Kabakali deserved better than being piloted by this clown
Patrick at least took part in some successful operations and had a couple moments of glory really late show and in Trailblazer, but Mask doesn't even have that
Man does not have a single victory to his name and keeps getting his ass beat by Bellri
But actually, I think there's one ace off the top of my head who is worse: Mask from G Reco
I think she only lands like two or three shots total in her Zaku Warrior on screen
Yeah, Lunamaria is done exceedingly dirty by the stock footage
Don't forget the other half of the equation
~~I swear I actually like Gundam, despite my constant ranting about it~~
I elect to charitably read Mr. Bushido as an attempt to do the same since he is completely and utterly pointless to the narrative and just gets in the way for the sake of personal pride, but 00 handicaps itself too much by the lookathowcoolitistheyredoingthething
But I do like Rau in so far as him being the most pointed "Char clones are stupid, absolutely fucking insane and you shouldn't idolize them" that in Gundam that actually worked
I think Patrick Zala is the far spicier villain to that end, both because we see the schemes on his way to power actively unfold, and because of the wholy dynamic that the Le Creuset Team in general, but Athrun in particular has to the politics by nature of being the children of the council
I would not precisely call him top tier, but he's one of the more coherent and thematically pointed Char clones, so that's something
Which one
~~and crucially, it also recognizes when to stray from that outline completely~~
Same. I like how it takes the same ideas as a first draft to play off of rather than a crutch to adhere to, as many other Gundam shows have an unfortunate tendency to do
Oh will it fucking ever. So good.
YEP
That was pretty good
Ah yes, the JavaScript incident
God it feels weird to see that scene in actual good resolution after watching the whole show in certified 2006 fansub quality
||They _just_ said that the people in the cradles are still alive, why are we nuking the ship||
Wait hold the fuck on
But yeah, that scene was excellent
Because nothing lists a movie existing
Okay then it was a dvd thing, yeah
There's a movie version of Strikers?
**GOD** that felt good
EAT SHIT QUATTRO
FATE YOU ARE SMARTER THAN THIS
Fate you are smarter than this
_**BRUH**_
Please don't do the thing where you needlessly stretch out your fight
you had something immensely good there
Strikers pls
(Not talking about Gundam here for once)
CANNOT fucking wait for Quattro to get stabbed
...yeah no, holy fuck, Strikers is now doing all the catchup to the things happening that wasn't there in the fist 15 episodes
Gee, I wonder why <:GenjuroLaugh:689563633516150872>
21 episodes into the show <:wheeze:1077989688029225053>
O shit, first time Alph actually shows up in the present
.
(or in the case of Bocchi and Edgerunners I came in so late that they were done to begin with, or almost done for Bocchi)
All the stuff that I did watch I would have also watched had it been an old show
In general I prefer bingewatching over weekly, and most of the stuff that comes out just doesn't interest me
I don't have the drive to watch something because it's airing
And only because had it been an old show I'd have heard enough about it being mid as fuck to not bother with it
KKS is the only one on that list that I watched _because_ it was currently airing
I mean I did, but I don't do seasonal <:Ver:704169051391524875>

Also yes, it is sexist as all hell
Watching Victory is the feeling of standing under the shower at 2am questioning what was the point of your life up to now
Victory is the result of depression; not in the sense of ooh it is so sad you need to be xdepressed to write something like that, but you can _feel_ the emptiness oozing out of it
not really
Victory is atrocious
It was not a good use of my time, but I don't regret watching it, no
not even a competition
Stargazer absolutely is the best Seed content
I will defend the second battle of Orb for being one of the better fights in Gundam from a standpoint of tactics and strategy
The last 10 eps are fun enough if you just want some decently well-done fights, but that and completionism are kinda the extent of reasons why you would want to watch Destiny
Definitely not, no
But it is not nearly as awful as the spite and vitriol that dominate the general discourse around it would suggest
It is, in the grand scheme of things, a bad show, the middle ~60% of it actively suck and the start and end are mostly just kinda alright
Destiny is like.... a 4/10 on the whole
1) Not nearly as bad as people claim it to be, but not exactly good
2) have not seen it
It is, but it's been localized as Zeon for decades, and that is the canon spelling
https://vxtwitter.com/mecha_tho/status/1629638174082252800
https://vxtwitter.com/zeonicscans/status/1629613703850242048
Granted, I have not read the flood of Gundam side content, but I have gone through most of the ones with some notability, and those were the only ones worth the time it takes to read them
As far as genuinely good Gundam sidestory manga/novels go, we're looking at G-Unit, Sentinel, OG Crossbone/Steel 7, IBO Gekkou, maybe 00P and Blue Destiny if you're being generous
Granted, it is one of the better Gundam sidestories as a whole as well, but that honestly is not a super high bar to clear, either
G-Unit is notable in that it doesn't suck ass
Unironically that, yeah
Don't know about that, I just know that he started an orphanage with whatsherface and then at some point just fucked off leaving who is heavily implied to be their biological kid to become the new Deathscythe pilot
There is guaranteed to be even more that never made it to the english-speaking side
And mind you, that is only the parts that I have come across and remembered
_Impressively_ bad even by the standards of Wing writing
Heero had his memory wiped and wants to kill Relena again, Relena's idea of ensuring peace is to implant a bomb in everyone with a trigger tied to her life (and she somehow managed to pull that off?), so they put her in cryosleep to prevent her from getting killed and literally ending all of humanity in the process, Zechs and Noin had a kid who is secretly the reincarnation of Treize's spirit (or maybe their kid was something else, I just know that _someone's_ kid is Treize), Quattro has become a war profiteer, Duo is a deadbeat dad who ran off never to be seen again and I didn't bother remembering the rest
It's a trashfire start to finish
yeah FT is shunned even by the like two hardcore Wing stans that I know
I'm just genuinely amazed at the amount of knowledge you have about literally every mecha show I have ever heard of
Aah, fair
How many mecha shows are there that you haven't seen
Melua, genuine question
Yeah no, that's fair
Oh right, you said mecha, not Gundam
I have successfully avoided most Gundam entries pre-Victory, but even the bad ones after I found a lot better
I am absolutely mad at the symptom here, the wheels aren't inherently at fault, but it's enough to make me not like them
It does have super dumb stuff, but the brand of dumb stuff that Victory does with the wheels turns all of the fights into drawn-out slogfests
But they are constantly shown to improve armor, not mobility
If every suit had some of those strapped to the back for maneuvering, I would be all for that
They would be useful, yes, but that is not why the show says they're useful, and that's the part that annoys me
I wouldn't even mind them if they did something else, but they toss up the big question of it whatever material those are made out og are impervious to most incoming fire, why not build the suits out of that
Yes  but they kept being deployed in space when they had no use there, and the show keeps pretending that they are magic super armor
The show has made me hate the wheels because they are at the core of so much of the constipated pacing
Oh yeah, the designs are excellent
Yes, Tomino was bitter, spiteful and kind of an asshole before he got his shit in order while writing Turn A, but that is by far not enough to result in a trash fire of that magnitude
And those sure as fuck didn't turn out like Victory
That was also the case for every Gundam show before and most after
yes but that's not the reason why Victory is the way it is
yeah, that
The part that personally annoys me the most is that the only reason I watched Victory back when I did was to see the Assault-Buster in action, and we got like half an episode of that
The artstyle is also this weird inbetween
To be fair, it also looks like a polished up 80s show
The worst part is the plot point of oh the unborn baby was a newtype, which then somehow changed the outcome of some battle
That show is so immensely fucking frustrating
Dies in the dumbest way, too
Also I am 100% convinced that the number of his onscreen kills that is floated in that meme is hard bullshit
Tbf he doesn't do that _that_ much, at least not as much as people remember him doing it
Or the boob bite
Remember Üso sleeping with his mom naked and that never getting addressed
I mean, still not the most uncomfortable thing to that end
Almost all the fights in the first half of the show were structured the same
The choreo was alright, but it didn't really do anything I feel
||Chronicle|| hitting his head on wreckage with perfect comedic timing absolutely murdered me on my first watch
But I will say that it has the most unintentionally, gutbustingly hilarious character death I have ever seen
I didn't super mind that since Zanscare by that point was so fucked from havinf their shit blown up that they wouldn't have lasted much longer anyways
And pretentious and has horrible pacing
yee, listened to it just yesterday, quite good
Saki has such a nice voice, would fit a lot of songs really well
yeah, it's a shame
If I'm not completely mistaken Cocoa and Saki did one of the duets together like a year ago
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKZseApvTRM
Unleash the Archers is very fun
oooooooooo
Within Temptation is really fun
<:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
Cocoa and Saki have such good taste in their covers
I don't think I've heard a single thing about the guy after like 2014 when I was starting to be less absorbed by Minecraft youtube
o god that put me straight back to what feels like 2013
mh, yeah, that scans
But both are extremely good, yes
I prefer Storm over Heats, it just has more force to it I feel
hell, that whole show has no right to be as good as it is
Eh, I'm sure there will be another time
aw.
Similar story for me with driving distances and starting times usually
Yeah you'll probably be back home around 1am
But yeah, Sabaton is always a blast
oh, also logistics, yeah
If you feel safe going to a live event with plague numbers, by all means do
Chaos Wizards, Universe on Fire and Apocalypse 1992 just kinda hit different
Probably Space 1992
Although the most fun concerts I've been to were pretty consistently Sabaton and Beast in Black
Got a guy to crowdsurf to and from the bar to deliver beer to fuel the Hootsman's reactor core to unlock his full power output
Saw them live some years back, they were having so much fun on stage
Gloryhammer are great
It's a really good show, one of my favorites in the franchise
I appear to have been pinged in here
I really like their Kickstart my Heart remix
Dance with the Dead are fun
Gundam X music v good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3FQDpTA_lE had this one on repeat all day, such a good song
Victorius is fun
Caught in a Dream is pretty good tho
I don't like Hero very much, it never really gets going
I mean I mostly listen to their bonkle songs, but Creeping in my Soul, Gravity Hurts, Closer to the Truth and Bye Bye Babylon are just bangers
somehow, I ended up listenbing to Cryoshell today without knowing that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMoC3iEM-nk
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0izPUBLPTU SDBA got a banger opening
I've fallen down the Peaky rabbit hole so hard it's not even funny anymore

How I wish there was a full version of this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0R77lHxSyiA
Frontier takes a bit to get going, but by the end it's quite fun
yes!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoPukRi-UUw I did not know I needed this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwPDVxTfiz4
had a bit of a lolwut moment there at first
ooooh now it makes sense
that is hilarious and also entirely in character
that one is just kinda the reigning champion of Delta songs
Movie had some pretty banger songs, but I don't think any of them have Bokura no Senjou beat
Akatsuki Records is so good
I assume that this was an early example of Lego cutting corners, and it prioritized in the moment performance over longterm rigidity
Well, different color plastic does have different properties based on the pigment used
Well scratch that, one of the pieces crumbled after being left out in open daylight for ten years, but that's kinda to be expected
I never had any issues with mine
Are they bad?
Cryoshell would have been my entry point into metal if by the time of me seeing Phantoka Lewa in store and experiencing neutron activation I hadn't already firmly been hooked on my dad's old albums
Sabaton gud
<a:InaNod:774990963310985226>
good cover
~~much like the show itself!~~
86 OST is so good
Old MAnowar are fun
How I wish this had a full version

I see the newtype flash proved true
Don't ask me why, just had a weird intuition that you're gonna really like this one
<@331908049822547978> I have a nondescript urge that I should tag you for this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AmKQX_Z54U
It is, found myself listening to it quite a few times lately
apart from the first secret boss, that thing is inexplicably difficult even with midgame gear
It's not nearly as hard as it was for me on my first playthrough, but the memory of that will forever be my main reference there
But yeah, I will forever hold very fond memories of the defend the ramparts level and my 13 year old self freaking the fuck out over the amouunt of things to juggle there
Most notably in the fact that you get effectively free roam flight in any level, and can use it in combat
From what I've seen of GoW, it plays quite a bit differently
I'm not positive I would call it a God of War clone
One unfortunate fact is that the English voice direction is not great, but it's still bearable
DotD gives you everything you need to know really, as long as you know the broad strokes of the rest
I never even watched the first two lol
And it's also just a ton of fun, and the ai is surprisingly competent even by the standards of a good chunk of games that came out a decade later
It's not an incredible flawless 10/10 game by any objective metric, but the vibes and story are very dear to me
Dawn of the Dragon is one of my all time favorite games
I love that tune so much
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr-VeZK2tBs
Now that I finally went and read up some Legend of Spyro stuff in English, I finally found the name of one of the battle soundtracks
O shit, that reminds me
Unironically one of my all time favorite movies
GOD I love that theme so much
dududu-dudu DUN DUN DUN
Le bruh
.....
Zettai Live's songs were kinda there for the most part, but Diva in Abyss and Walküre ga akiramenai tho
I'd do both tbh
Someone also did a seven person mashup of.... I think it was Bokura no Senjou
Mh, right
https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWv5gpT16ufmWjSJdYnh-2UjJn_JNZTa0
It's Sheryl and Ranka singing Walküre songs and vice versa, has some absolute bangers
Oh yeah <@228659769404030976>, are you aware of the Delta/Frontier mashup album?
There's usually an official upload as well, but youtube does not like to bring those up for Macross songs if you're searching for the romanji
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SO8Ef8rLeZo PSO2 has some bangers
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCsm-h19B5E
<@228659769404030976> I was browsing a "every spotify genre" site and look at what I found

Although admittedly I have played more Wii Sports Resort than I think even my Wii has kept track of, so I am used to how the wiimotes do things
I still sucked, but that's because I am bad at the vidya
I admittedly didn't play much of the game myself because I got into it through a letsplay at a time when my media consumption was very cursed ~~and SwS was borderline impossible to find over here~~, but when a friend of mine who owned a physical copy had me play for a bit, I don't think I had any issues with the motion controls
The overall vibe of the game as a whole, but Skyloft especially definitely helped, I am quite partial to the look and feel of the game
Although admittedly it has been quite some years and my memory of the game is not the best anymore, so I'm not gonna make this any hill to die on
If memory at all serves me, German SwS Zelda is portrayed fairly mischievous during the start of the game, in a way that does have the vibe of the two having known each other for years and can just pull some shenanigans
I feel like localization choices may alter vibes significantly here, I went through it in German where I imagine you played it in English
It makes the whole world feel more alive when it's not just Link working to get things done
If they wanted to, they could have easily made another (albeit shorter) game telling the events from Zelda's perspective, I like that
I personally quite like that she has actual chemistry with Link, I can believe that they're good friends even before any of the romance plot happens, and the fact that she's doing stuff on her own and you're chasing after her to just find her again, not because she's being constantly kidnapped
That's fair.
Personally I like SwS Zelda more because the interactions she does get with Link are just _fun_, but ST Zelda is both a joy and actually, immediately useful
she's excellent, yeah
Spirit Tracks has such lovely music
No matter how many dozen times I listen to it, it never fails to amaze me just how _fun_ the Flip Flappers soundtrack is
Oh hey look it's the Chris BXD band
