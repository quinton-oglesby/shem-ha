AWWHHHH
:(

Yeah im guessing it's a relic like durandel
I feel bad for tsubasa
Q_Q
i can't wait dude
AAAAAAA
and im so hype for the newxt one already
i've just seen it
who's just seen the new epsiode
sososo 👀
i should add them one sec
also elfnein and carol is best girls don't @ me
a
i ship miku x hibiki so much
stop our ship from happening
if they like
im gonna kms
If miku dies
If any of our main girls die im gonna cry
Gen can't die on us
agreed
^
Q_Q
I was so scared for gen
i know right
even his manliness can't take on the amalgam
I don't think even gen would be able to stop it tho
He just attracts his manliness
Gen can't help it.
^
YOU CAN DOOO IT
SAME
SAME
SAME
also idk which song is better for hibiki Hanasaku_yuki ver amalgam or Rainbow flower <:HibikiHi:336657249827028993>
that needs to be a ending i stg
just have all the girls just singing Karaoke
LOOL
fudou be like: "My abs are not as good as Gen, but still nothing can contain me"
he didn't want to kill him
gen hesitated
yeah
or somethign
what if he ruptured his organs tho
yeah he coughed blood up
i didn't want gen to die
but i should move
i finished the jap event but got nothing from the gacha
honestly
i'll join you
👀
some fate fans
do i see
wait
the qualty was sorta butchered on it unless that was me
also does anyone use kissanime
god killing kiss
god gone
and then boom
hibiki kisses miku
im saying
trying to figure it out
elfnein would be proud of us for some reason
Doesn't he think they are dead tho?
something like that
right
millarc is a vampire
they could always come back
i need a carol/elfnein pfp  ;c
i just say it once or twice sometimes
i don't do it all the time
i've just turned it into a jojo meme instead of saying watch jojo watch symphogear
it's that they won't give it a chance
It's not that they don't want to
i must somehow get them to watch it
so i can't talk about it except here
only one is tempted too and they have a massive backlog
non of my friends will watch it for some reason tho
tbh symphogear has gotten to the point where i just want to live there forever and just inhale everything to know about it
:feelsbadman:
I TRUST HANASAKI YUKI
I need it in my life
it's so good
Thanks
i got the gacha and have no lifed it for a little
i've had to make do with XDU so far
yeah
i haven't found any good quailty of that one
D:
noo
ver analgam
has anyone got hanasaki yuki?
I can't wait D:
When is next episode out again
i like mecha :feelsgoodman:
dw
that's me as well
Kichre
:lul:
i just do it once or twice if that, sometimes i forgot as well
yeah im not that bad
Probably never tho
Whenever fully body VR is gonna be a thing
I want VR symphogear to be a thing one day
And they'll perfectly recreate symphogear
LOL
That's the joke
*
English
Instead of in Japanese in England
Quick get the Hollywood team on our live action movie
Ange/angelise
Isn't basa's va the same as the MC in cross ange?
Yo I just realised
Shirabe needs more love tho
i don't need to kill you
like
the true reason gen lost is to flex on fudou
reported
ok
DID THEY NOT
WAIT
the only thing they've done right
we get to bask in gen's greatness
Ikr
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zN91WQzqQYc
lemme check what it was
uhh
i thought it was a bear trap
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
how can they just,, keep on cliffhangering us
WAS SO GOOD
THIS EPISODE
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
Shit this makes me wanna see gen as a master now
Gen is all the servants masters
Anchored to the world by Gen
They aren't real they are just spirits
Because they are servants duh
I love the duet so much tho
I'm pretty sure
Qualifies as a servant
Each gear user
Tbh
Ha*
Shem-ya
The new lostbelt is just
That's your homework
Yes
ASAP
I want a 20 page essay on this episode with all theories included
Cypher
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibu_aoDrgTk
make everyone
we should just
I think
LMAOOOOO
STOP
shem-ha can do that now
them all
code geass
just
"You now owe me"
"Monsterfied"
then she'll be like
"Yes you are"
"Aren't I right me?"
"No one can say otherwise"
"It's now perfect as me"
"incomptent humans once ruled this world"
as shemha
imagine everyone
just
alot
likes symphogear
someone in crunchyroll
LOOL
ikr
Yep.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2D761sPLmg
notlikethis
yeah
has anyone got the duet already?
TO HOLD HANDs
AND MIKU
NEED BIKI
WE STILL
you can't get more gayer
no new cast
nooo
no
We just have to create enough hype to get past their no season 6 barrier
or..
and that's it
we are getting a cd bonus after this
im pretty sure
this is the last season
you can't change my mind that Elsa doesn't get a pass on the die list
but honestly
Elsa is our true god
you can't change my mind
Elsa gets a pass
ELSA DESERVES NON OF THIS
is milaarc
from noble red
the only one i want to die
tbh
it's scary music
it's action
beef stroganoff is anything
is sing beef stroganoff
what you want her to do
no
moon dust turns out to be beef stroganoff
Remember to dream of Beef stroganoff!
nothing
to the beef stroganoff song
but aren't we all merely tools
"The true curse is the song."
"It's all powerful to unite people."
"The beef stroganoff song made me a being"
"Sing the beef stroganoff song!"
that's shem-ha's first order
sing this song
i've never heard of it before
nyaa?
uhh
i need them for educational purposes
👀
do you know if the songs are safe to download off the wiki
yeah
i didn't know tho
i thought it was that
yeah
THE ONE THAT'S BASICALLY FOR MIKUU
ooh
it'[s the other song on the wiki right?
my brain
<@506219877724454929> what is kimi di niki
Kami di niki?
at it
and we all will kreygasm
until they hold hands
they will keep on going
or something
blessing
close to like
wasn't it also
about the curse
also
maybe more
and i've been into symphogear for a month now
i feel the exact same
no hew's not
no
more shirabe moments
y'know what we need
Chris has been really coool!
Maria needs her moments
nani
Yeah
^
https://youtu.be/w2D761sPLmg
THEY RENAMED IT
But is like "enuma elish? More like enuma fuck you im not using it"
He has the power to basically fuck everyone over
Gilgamesh is a great example imo
[Grand final battle 1/1]
Meanwhile fate be like
Even if they are more powerful
Can't Zeno just thano snap
AUTOCORRECT PLS
Ha*
And just slap Shem-ya
Autocorrect pls
Ha*
She's gonna come face to face with Shem-ya
Our poor Miku won't stand for this!
Of course she's gonna have weaknesses as well
She's possessing a human body
Also that what Melua said
I don't think it was
I feel like I'm getting mixed up here
"Fuck that I'm absorbing it anyway"
But then bikki was like
Also people thought bikki couldn't absorb it I thought
We don't talk about that part okay
Shush
We've had someone with the power to destroy the world lose to a bunch of teenagers who love to sing
^
LOL
I would enjoy that tho
Uhh
My sweet Elza doesn't deserve any of this
Milaarc*
Also the only one in noble red who should die is millarc
Tbh we need the beef stroganoff song full version
And beats shemha
Miku regains all her power
Beef stroganoff is sang
More like
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
Shemha*
The power of lesbian is stronger then shemhaw
We need the power of song to save her
Bikki can't punch her waifu
also
I've been slacking okay
What happens when you don't study fate every day
So that's why I took it literally LOL
I saw it ages ago <@279341087494242304> and only remembered that part
Yeah
Ooh

And it said something like that
I think I checked the wiki
Wait my brain
Thanks enkidu for saving us
I'm pretty sure
I mean enuma elish destroyed the earth 7 times over
LOOOL
Changed to this
We were talking about uh gods and stuff and then it just
^
He would still be able to fuck over a lot of EX noble phantasm depending on what it is
Ex*
No no not every noble phantasm lol
What's more powerful in noble phantasm
I swear it is
He should be lol
Yeah he isn't but
^
Yeah but I thought they had that thing where it scans
On apple products
How do you pirate
Like
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
I've never tried pirating on apple okay
Products
Does that even work on apple
Spotify is my only way of living in the outside world
Look
Help
Guys I need new symphogear songs on Spotify
Is just apple
What about if the true antag
We only accept lesbians in this series
No we can't accept that tho
LESBIANS ONLY
Wait we can't accept that
What about if fine is just bi
My new canon name for enuma elish
Enuma eliah
TRUE LOOOL
Oooh
Library
Amalgam x ignite
Just imagine
The beef stroganoff song made Shem-ha btw
Yesterday I just went mad about it
I'm still betting beef stroganoff saves the world
i forgot they countered
tbh for some reason
oh true
why wouldn't it be possible because fo the timer?
yeah if it still existed
would be possible
ignite x amalgam
do you think
real question
guys
Also the blood is to keep it pure or something
I'm pretty sure
Also a blood transfusion wouldn't save your brain if it was done everyone so often
Faust robe would handle that totally
The only reason I can think is because of the not perfect body but
why does she need blood
not robot
like only her head
isn't vanessa mostly robot
i've ben wondering just
also
please do that
also if anyone wants to post lelouch memes
also fuck those guys talking about copyright
this is obviously a fate reference, dess
fate has the right to copyright them!
quiet obviously
<:HibikiAAA:620079684109205534>
<:HibikiEager:407398049531559937>
I'm glad your caught up and with us now kanade
We are all lesbian trash now
That's why the next three episodes are gonna be amazing!
Don't @me
Matt Smith is best boy btw
Yeah
Where the planet is like something f that eats memories and history
I'm pretty sure that's the one with Matt Smith
I'm British and a Matt Smith fan

Can we just condem a random side character to hell instead of Elsa pls
<:ChrisCharge:586320496346529792>
Put yo hands up
I just want cute doggo to live

^
<:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>

<:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
Or she could fist miku
<:HibikiAAA:620079684109205534>
And all would be okay
Fist space
She'd just
And then is flung out into space
Bikki breaks the wall
Imagine just
Dess
and that probably
bikki would fist her out of herself
it's because
^

<@87512939107450880> we should totally go over which class everyone is in a servant setting <:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
lancer doesn't work since she doesn't use armed gear
she doesn't fit into other classes really
no matter what
i see bikki as a zerker
tbh
<:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>

She needs miku to give up to take over her fully
Obviously she's not all strong in that department
Miku is fighting back so
She can suppress her but

Autocorrect tho

<:HibikiAAA:620079684109205534>
Because she punches it
Yeah were bikki is
2 episodes left so i doubt it
bit ambious
SYMPHOOOOOOOOOGEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
It's always hard to delegate time to sub-protags or just protags
Bikki is always the main character
straight away
it gets better quailty just not
i mean
aDS*
adds
<@!476058996315389953> i know kissanime is quick but
rekt
bang
notlikethis
we have a hour left
oops i just saw you meant last episode
wait
i need it rn
episode from
where do you get the new
WAIT
I NEED THE EPISODE NOW
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
for her amalgam
it just felt like not enough time
i think it makes sense but
in time
no i meant like
in epicness
more more up there
though i wish chris's amalgam was
the episodeee
go watchj
exaactly
why would you spoil yourself tho!
if she did
also we would be talking about it more
WAATCH IT
wdym
BUT HE'S HOT THAT'S ALL THAT MATTERS
I AGREEEEEEEEEEEEE
<@486087033652248576> I AGREE
but sheesh THIS EPISODE WAS HYPE
i wish elsa didn't die
YO THIS EPISODE
she planned stuff i think
not that we know of
also elsa probably had the smallest killcount
we don't talk about that
shh
D:
SHE WAS TOO PURE FOR THAT
that's all i cared about
I didn't want elsa to die
I AGREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
YEAAAAAAAH
HOW WAS IT
CYPHERRR
im so sad that elsa died tho D:
do they just have a bondage kink?
at this point
y'know
bondaaage

i waanteed moooore
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
for long enough
like her amalgam didn't last
it just felt
<:HibikiAAA:620079684109205534>
but we don't know about it since it was injected at birth
there probably is
i guess so
yeah
oh
she still had the curse right
how did shem-ha inplant some of herself in vanessa
but uh
really really underrated
chris amalgam was
i agree with cypher here
we have a bar ogawa
we have a demon hunter ogawa
we have a ninja ogawa
so it's offical
just a goddess
Aoi yuuki is
someone already said it
wait
SYMPHOGEA-
we just need to hear that
i posted that
<@!246678192360783872> heh
^
Heiki hecchara it'll be fineeeeee
<:HibikiAAA:620079684109205534>
then surely it'll be fine
have we heard everyone elses b-side?
no i meant on youtube
make your bets now
the first spoiler
when is crunchyroll gonna upload
let's make our bets
okay guys
immense power
both of them powers would explain
also amalgam+XD
off the charts
i think phonic gain is just
i wouldn't like that
You have no ancher!
No rin here.
^
^
she would of put up a better fight imo
yeah but
like ???
she's more stronger and she was singing
and she got the short end for some reason
carol is stronger then symphogeas
literally
NOOO MORE CAROL
nooooooooo
<:CarolYandere:424047704826707980>
she uses it again
we always have carols trump card but
right
since it's also a blessing
i think they are gonna reactivate the curse in a different way
obviously
just get bikki to punch the language
^
true
like activating it with phonic gain
can't they just use Château de Tiffauges tho
activate it with phonic gain
like
Château de Tiffauges?
i think melua will allow us to use caps this once
^
yeah
there's alot she could do tho

i just don't agree with how carols fight was treated imo
in reality saint-germain is a persona
SAINT GERMAIN-SANNNNN
STANDO POWERS ACTIVATE
the others could but she couldn't D:
i didn't want elsa to die
come with me <:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>

D:
she had enough phonic gain for gears just by singing but this time no massive power
wait yeah
i agree with that one
yeah <@152896851660505088>
i 100% think carol was underplayed tho slightly but yeah nothing was wrong with it
carol was like: Symphogears i'll leave this to you
she wasn't properly singing <:CarolPout:617039564313198602>
not enough time for it imo
underwelming
yeah but other then that
i thought chris amalgam was a bit underwleming
<:CarolSmug:617040484111745027>
saint-germain is a persona now
i knew kiseki meant imracles
i don't know why i typed that now
bruh
MY BRAIN
wait
yeah i know
also i thought shenshoujin got destroyed
:lul:
saint-germain is a persona
how many times have we been over this now LOL
"Now, bow down before me before i reveal it!"
Carol: "You think you have defeated me? Kiseki of miracles?! my true aim was to find out your search history!"
<:CarolSmug:617040484111745027>
~~TIME to watch the episode again~~
to defeat shem-ha also
the group gets a group song tho
i hope
https://tenor.com/view/senki-zesshou-symphogear-hibiki-tachibana-yea-happy-dance-gif-14443927
people linked it more to saint-germain-san
<:ChrisEating:384879395829186560> s
sang when they fought
this should of been the duet
https://symphogear.fandom.com/wiki/Itsuka_no_Niji,_Hana_no_Omoide#English
or keep them for the epicness of the last episode
get your screams out now
guys
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
LUL
"That's what it means"
i think they heard cabbage in the song and were like
my brain isn't working
ooh
my brain totally forget
ooh
what was the kill count
LOL
also do we know how many people survived the concert?
"My target is you, Tsubasa Kazanari!"
because milaarc is like
also yeah it was mainly fudou's plan i think
well yeah but i think the concert was mostly fudous plan tbh
how so
<:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
doggo should of lived
but milaarc is just like: "Kids? more like dead stab stab"
and probably vanessa
also with nr i think milaarc was the only one who couldn't fully be redeemed
do they
they don't have good exit strategys for noise attacks
with concerts in the symphogear universe
also now that i think about it
same
PEWWW
global warming doesn't exist <:CarolYandere:424047704826707980>
tiki true villian
evil tiki
eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeh?!
not good at explaining
but im also
true
i just wanted more epicness tis all
well i think cypher gets what i mean

<:TsubasaSmug:585839805737467920>
lmao
also i was joking
not with the first attack actually
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
carol went easy on shem-ha
true but it would of been better to stall anyway
users get bacc
until symphogeaaaaaar
stall
all carol really needed to do was keep on using her strings
i mean it seems like she was struggling to escape
yeah
carol just kept shem-ha in bondage
what if uh
wait
<:CarolStare:336656462287994882>
but really it was topdad!
you all thought shem-ha was the true villian
fuahahah!
topdad
don't ruin our dreams
<:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
the best part was bondage
yeah charles i agree
really far
locked away
isn't it just like
is it gone gone
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
would be shem-ha
everyone
^
it's more if you get choked during x-drive mode
but still
even though that was probably for explosion
that equipping their gears would do nothing
shirabe even said
also
was more air giving
x-drive
i always thought
breathable air
also since when does alchemy give air
basa is bottom
no chris dies and no third wheel
<:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
Maria dies and tsubasa is a lone lesbian
D:
SO DID elsa
MIKU DESERVES TO LIVE
miku won't die
<:ShirabeStare:582381430915596289>
STOOP
STOP
yeah thanks to hack
shem-ha is a lesbian
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
<@!102691114762371072> it was a joke <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
straight people don't exist
everyone is a lesbian
as symphogear users
non lesbians aren't permitted
no
I'm holding myself back
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
i want to make hibiki new x-drive my pfp but im holding back
prove me wrong
SHE SHOULD OF LIVED
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
i meant elsa
my brain
not milaarc
only forgive milaarc
"No more monster"
yeah she did it more because of fudou and his promise of
I think she just wanted to be saved so much she just followed fudous word as law
^
i don't have a thing for vampires
^
if anything elsa was the best chance for redemption in the group
as a character
i mean she wasn't even that fucked up
the plan for the concert
fudou was more
i think
well
i mean now that's carols back elfneins job is to become the murderer of kiseki <:CarolYandere:424047704826707980>
if any at all
elsa has lowest killcount
i mean
imo that's not the same thing
what about if she has no revolver in mega form
LOL
espically bikki
they will still be held back even in op form
about what they should do to miku's body
careful
like
it makes them feel so much
i sorta like it since
nah
this isn't that tho
yeah but that doesn't restore body
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
how is hibiki gonna fist to get it back
i don't think miku body change
BDH
yeah
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
why don't we just fuse them all together
FUSION HAAAAAAAAAA
inb4 hibiki just becomes everyone
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
in one hit
their super new modes are just destroyed by Shenshoujin
also inb4
And then breaks out of her control
"I must be gay.... for my waifu!"
I'd like to believe the song is gonna be in the anime tho and obviously let's hope miku picks up what it means and then she's like
That's what I heard or something
I'm pretty sure it was said on a radio
<:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
Smh
Just be illiterate
Grammar on the internet LUL
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
And it's happened like 4 times
That's all my experience with it
Like I've had people randomly change to grammar and suddenly they change their usernames to like Gone.
Basically
Are edgy
I've learnt that most people do it
I've been wondering that for ages now
Why do people use grammar on the internet
Can I just
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
<:HibikiAAA:620079684109205534>
We must refer to melua as melua-senpai now
<:CarolSmug:617040484111745027>
Idk I forgot the title my Brain isn't working
May cry
Symphogear cry may
In the spinoff
He will
<:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
But still
It was in XDU I heard
And you can't prove me wrong
Girls don't exist on the internet
Yeah I'm also a guy
<:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
I would like enki do some things to me tbh

ehh
shemha just used a mystic-code to stun everyone but hibiki
shem-ha be like: *stuns lock rest of crew*
the ending wasn't satisfying honestly, and some other parts weren't either imo
~~was sorta not satisfying~~
~~not gonna lie~~
idk
this didn't feel like a proper ending
im not gonna lie
honestly
lol
and im so glad
carol got the best part
i think so much better could of been done in this episode tho
<@!99695384296701952> 100% agree
same
yeah
ooh
my brain
whats a BD epilogue
<@87512939107450880> cypher shem-ha used mystic code stun on everyone but hibiki
fanfic 👏 workers 👏 get 👏 working 👏 for us 👏  who need a eplilogue 👏 thank you
Honestly
I think episode 12 is better then 13
I'm really not satisfied with this for some reason still
Imo I'm not satisfyed
lul
I meant with a hug
how stupid is it gonna be in XDU
oh god
hibiki solo
shem-ha used mystic code to stun everyone but hibiki
it was
i didn't find it great
it was eh
idk
ehhhh
^
im under 50%
deffo not
for you it might of but for me
it hit all the checkmarks
i don't think
like at elast include them
include them atleast
an epilogue, at least showing what they are doing ext. Instead of the final attack card with the hug just being hibiki, don't have everyone else stunlocked y'know?
it wasn't satisfactory for me
the ending just doesn't feel like one
for me
h
e
it was just..
honestly
doesn't feel like its ended
it
THANKS FOR HTAT
IM GONNA DO THAT

Ignite broke
Yeah but they also didn't need it anymore since
Attaching junk to a symphogear is eh

Because junk is junk
Probably

Me vs sand because I would lose
Like uh
I didn't like the anime either for some reason
Saitama is boring tbh
We could have like 1000 shemha's vs whoever
Also wouldn't it depend on curse of balal as well
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
It might have some effect
I mean sliver alchemy tho
