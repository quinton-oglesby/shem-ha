Nooo I like normal Shirabe better than the chibi
Feel free to @ me anywhere to get my attention. Currently kinda broken after a long day, so my focus is near zero
Thanks for the warm welcome, I was a bit busy reading up on the recommended channels and getting some war paint on

I don't think it's a bad thing. As I grow older, the people whose opinionatter to me change and the number becomes fewer.
I think that's just natural. I notice it the most with things I get better at as I hone my skills. I quickly become indifferent to compliments and remarks from people who haven't progressed as much or who don't know the first thing about it

Sometimes a pile of burning trash is fun to watch. But that doesn't mean it's not trash
No, it's like really bad movies
