it gets fucked mid a rebirth by a fucking earthquake that kinda drives it's coffers empty
and then when the revolts happened and Portugal returned to Portugal
and because they were fucked over, they lost their spice market and a good grip on South America
Then pass over 2 more Spanish Kings that fuck over Portugal
All of Portugal's ships get yoinked by Spain and get fucking dunked on by the British because they didn't fucking know how to properly utilize them
and then all of the REALLY good naval officiers of Portugal were subsequently shat on because "lol not spanish"
fast foward five fucking minutes and Portugal gets fucking glomped by Spain
jk
fast forward a few hundred years
which nearly ended in Portugal getting annexed to Spain
Then a sucession crisis happened
but as I was continuing
yes, yes it is
D. Sebasti√£o, who FOR SOME UNGODLY REASON decided that going to war before leaving an Heir was a good idea
First of all, we must go back a bit in history and talk about the stupidest idiot born on Portuguese soil
so hear ye hear for the tale of how Portugal's imcompetence fucking irks me
~~that and also alliances in Europe were almost always on blood ties, Portugal and Britain's was an actual contract~~
so both Portugal and Britain were some steps ahead of the rest
yeah, they weren't really up to speed about it due to lack of delving on it.
Portugal was kinda of force to dive into marine warfare seeing as they have their back and head blocked by a country that has some animosity towards it, as well as the prospect of long and safe travel for econnomic purposes and since Portugal at the time already had the alliance established, Britain and Portugal more than probably had shared it's own naval innovations and training regiments.
tbf they put Jesus next to the respawn station
If the man died before making someone else take responsibility why would he show up when the country's in shit
anyways that felt therapeutic
also PS: **don't fucking talk to me about eycalyptus. I live in the middle and I'm constantly getting warnings about fires because of the fucks.**
but yeah that's the downfall of Portugal badly explained but still very much accurate
I'm severely dissapointed like a parent who just saw their child shit in the dog's food bowl
I just
Chances of getting employed are low because all the jobs are taken by people who's retirement is getting delayed by the year
it's just
and it's not like it's expensive to live in Portugal
~~Spring is still ass for anyone with allergies tho~~
Autumn is the perfect balance
Winter isn't 2 meters of snow
Summer isn't a complete hell
Portugal in terms of location is wonderful
Like
I would pay attention to more modern day history of Portugal but it all tl:drs to "Dick measureing contest but instead of dicks it's lying" and "oh fuck we're in debt let's destroy the economy and not let the future generation have a decent chance of living"
plenty of freedom and money, just don't talk shit about the regiment and you'll be fine
it was more or less restrained socialism with capitalistic ideals driving the country economy
Estado Novo wasn't actually very alike communism
also as for the commie thing
or your entire country ends up in a lot of debt and self-loathing
so tl:dr, if you're going to a crusade have a fucking kid before going
and then shit just got worse because politics is a shit show no matter where
then the army said fuck you and proceed to hand his ass on a silver platter alongside a pretty flower
as in abuse power
and then this one jackass thought he could pull a Stalin
that said some time before that Salazar kicked the bucket
they were good
and so until 1974 things were neither shit nor heavenly
yeah the man had a fuckign doctrate in economics
also did you know Mr.Dictator actually knew how the economy fucking worked
which was a smart-ish move on him, controlling only the info that shits on the regiment instead of any and all that don't please you
at least he didn't abuse his power to kill minorities, only for censorship
The one and the same
is where I'd say we finally got an actually semi competent leader
now this point in history
then in came the Great War/WWI  and oh look Poverty
and it just kept getting worse until 1910 when enough was enough and so went the monarchy
Oh I do not like the look Palmon is giving
