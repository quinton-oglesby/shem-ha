well there's a new name
so many powers
seeing some blues now
was only seeing power for the past 30 mins till now

i refreshed like 50 times but cant find him
wasnt expecting it to be killed but didnt want to waste cp
hey itâ€™s my raid
if only the refresh system actually worked
dont think so
isteemo and friends still helping us clear
theres a dex one by gridlock near half hp
im guessing the power with the chinese name
welp never getting that then
what counts as contribution btw
hopefully today
are the hackers back
cant find him rip
i 10 cpd it to be safe cause i hate paralysis
has 408k left so you still have time
gridlockâ€™s dex one is almost dead if anyone wants to poke it
i wish
20k per 3 isnt bad right
yeah
hopefully i get my rainbow balls
gonna be spamming tickets on tech if anyone wants to help
prob would be better if i had 2 healers but doesnt matter if theyre always on faint
gonna tilt if i dont get rainbow orbs from this
i made some slots
wanna kill the tech im doing teemo ðŸ‘€
teemo the god
red carol up
ill open some carols once i get 2 more giga fantasy crystals
teemo best carry
accelerate
body/dex/tech/forgot the last one that drops rainbow orbs
wanna help with the tech i have up teemo
~~im more desperate for rainbow orbs~~
im just opening carols for people here even tho i dont need anything from it lul
so close
<@!478439753025585155> thanks <3
power*
i can open a hard one
:d
thanks teemo
power up
anyone want anything up?
rip teemo
i assume those low lvls who havent logged in for a day arent gonna login again
sanic and teemo mvp
thanks for all the carries teemo \o/
93k hp
oh found it
cant find
cant find it
oh green carol
i just get stunlocked
how do people do damage to dex
if anyone wants to poke it
got 4th lul
healer died
rip dont think i can get hunt
im just sustaining with 1 healer and my erenbikki
i dont do a lot of damage
~~hope i dont die~~
i did 117k with 5
how much damage is 3rd
rip cant find
is it dead
thought you meant the reg dex
yeah only see the same 4 people when i refresh 100x
cant find
which room is that
well then this was free
oh now i am
wait what's your id
yeah
still cant find rip
just added you
new update ðŸ‘€
im playing AL at the same time
lul
deleting random people everyday is a pain
red and green carol up
ill put carols up too
that are from this server
im just hitting whatever carols i see up on refresh
i have green carol up just waiting to be killed
i dont even have 200 stones
same
guess i cant save up for both
i have both carols up
it's xd chris
also i put up another green if anyone wants to tag
cais has a green carol with tags
how many rice do you guys have left
poke mine too
no one here uses chinese/korean names right
accelerate
same
he made another acc
dont even know how lvl 15s show up
it's scary how fast randoms add you within 5 mins when you delete people
he doesnt
mb
~~maybe i accidentally did~~
dont think i did
also i made space if i accidentally did
what's your ign
my carol has 6
im tilted
~~i would but i see a carol up~~
someone should help this poor soul
but it died when i left
rip wanted to leave to get hunt bonus
how many rice bowls do  you guys have left
im just chipping down angela's
opened 7 slots if anyone wants to add
looks like no hunt for me again
but never when im doing damage to it
why does carol always bully my healers when i want to go for hunt
482k left
adds are dead for euden's
45 to 60
<:KirikaCry:671948299179130885>
need 2 more
my ignite kirika is 56
i assume some of those came cause of aot
^
how long does the silence last  for
60
i deleted a few again
same
ill put some carols up so you guys can tag
last time i tried to use 5 cp i was off by like 500 damage
carol has been up as well
blue up for those that wanted it
i meant nickname for this server
better to put it as your nickname
cause sanic is always top
yeah but instead of top 3 damage, youll have to be top 2
lemme tag it
ðŸ‘€
gonna put up another carol
he's killing whatever has 5+ tags probably
i didnt even know you could scroll to the right
i usually tag and leave
~~i dont even know how i got mine~~
and they also could find you randomly
tbf we cant exactly control who comes to our rooms unless we open to followers only
red carol up whoever wants to tag
guessing he's full
hazzy has a lot of tags on red carol
blue one whoever wants it
ill open one
made some slots
ill make some space after this raid
but he had 60 rice bowls earlier
ðŸ‘€
531k hp left in splcedog's green carol
i should probably start buying rice bowls with advent currency so i can do more raids
doesnt matter to them now anyways since they just 1 shot everything
wonder if jp suffered the problem as us
ty btw sanic <:KirikaJoy:672105345342111785>
guess ill get some reds for last lu for 3* shirabe
serena
rip the magic
hope this is good enough for a lu
<:KirikaApproval:586957465552158720>
thanks sanic
only have 15 giga miracle crystals
we found the next person to carry us
am i going to have to tap some carols before i sleep
9point8's carol is at 270k
ill probably buy it
hope i can actually save enough stones
but sanic
i saw some guy named ahegao leaving htings at 1hp
is it teemo
too bad they dont drop for me
so it's nice to find them
i need giga power crystals to lu my 3* shirabe to 70
only shows up for everyone when it's at like 3 hours remaining
yeah i need my power ones killed
i put a p up cause i need the gigas for my shirabe
oh sanic is here
ahegao lurking ðŸ‘€
i just added him and see it
oh sanic is back
rip
you should
yeah
im clearing my own p if anyone wants to poke it
put up a nother p
<:KirikaSalute:620069889838809089>
done
it'll prb be dead in like 5 mins
my p is almost dead if someone wants to poke it
finally free from power farming
from login today
2
oh yeah we also get 50 gach tickets soon from login
my last 4 11 rolls were trash so... hope it balances out <:KirikaScared:672584678993297431>
yeah then whale the rest and hope i dont spend much
i hope i can get to 2k before serena
poor guy
wow 40 turns
yeah
can prob try and hope rng is on my side
not sure if i can do 70k
yeah
im gonna do 5 just in case
yeah
i can either last 28 turns or 12 turns
maybe
everytime i try to get hunt, carol decides to end it faster
i cant kill at 192
192
are the ones next to the yellow, rage?
rip
yeah
it's gone for me
mine is almost there
might as well tap that one as well
im tapping that right now lul
at least it's cheap here
i remember it cost like 80 dollars in danmachi
would be nice if they offered selection tickets every now and then
~~make casual alt that doesnt care about pvp and roll 200 stones for guaranteed~~
since people  can just make an alt and trade if they dont their desired chars
trading units would be broken tho
i did more damage on my 3cp than i did with my 5 cp
needed 7.5k more damage
no hunt for me
rip
but of course rng decides to screw me over when i want hunt
wonder if i can kill with 5 cp
83k
prob g then
gx?
i forgot what go to hell is
~~glorious break is best song btw~~
ya there are a lot of inserts in the series
582k
i should be dead soon
im at 3 cp so i prob havent done much
maria finally died at 18 turns
idk what this rng is
well it's been 17 turns for me and my initial team members havent died yet
how did i make it to 13 turns in carol without my lvl 50 maria dying yet
and then people like me will be saving the stones from the event just to get 3 xd serenas
got 2 on my highest damage
is it dead
only have 1 which is on red 3* shirabe
idk which one to raise <:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
does mlb 3* blue shirabe> 1lb 4* blue shirabe if i have them
cant see her
oh rip
but i paused
idk if it's dead now
well i left after a bit and it was at 16k
189k on haz's red carol
rip
sort by atk
time to set genoside saw heaven as my song for carol
why are my carols so inconsistent
or at least give us 999 follower slots like danmachi
did you get your mlb kanade
didnt really find out cause he kept attacking my red shirabe so less turns overall
~~only wanted to see how much more damage i would do with my new shirabe~~
rip
poking lucky's power atm
i can try helping with the dex
~~except youll have like 100 by the time the rerun comes~~
xd chris and serena
1.4m on 5cp is good tho
ow
i usually die at like 28
how much does he hit at that point
stunned to death
i might as well not even attack when i go into dex raids
i still hate the dex one the most
yup they start to hurt later on
nah
did 5 cp on doom's did less than 80k
when i was lowering mousy's i did 200k before dying on 5cp
my carols are so inconsistent
id like to last hit for once thanks
i think garie usually lives
70k is safe for me if 5cp most likely
~~watch me still not kill it~~
10 cp it is
hm
122k
purchase
commander box isnt bad
i should probably get some in case i ever get more kirikas
410k left on 9pont's red carol
167k with 5 cp isnt bad i guess
the burn hurts
like skill lock and paralysis
but theres some annoying mechanics that just screw you over
just bring some healers
they dont hit that hard till the later turns
same
cant find it
red is ignite
xd bikki is green carol
well lasted 36 turns with xd jii on my team to carol
is transcendâ€™s dead?
sanic the mvp
and arrest you
theyr gonna knock on your door
if they ban people, they'd ban most whales
wasnt here yesterday so idk the rules
pause when you go in
so 19?
red carol is nice in case i get a last copy of my ignite kiri
rage <:GWchinaSakuraThinking:398950680217255977>
yeah pref carols
rip
safe to kill then?
for this at least
2nd/3rd doesnt matter anyways
might skip one or two when it  gets to :30 so i dont ruin my pvp streak
or was it ep 8
but ep 7 was the best
but everyone should be getting highest damage
ill pass on the rage
gonna be on our 3rd int
30
how many refills do you guys have left
took like 3 refreshes to find
so 18 right
thanks sanic <:KirikaJoy:672105345342111785>
alright im done for now
pressed battle and crashed /o\
rip
oops
add him
how many till we go?
yeah
or well raids in general
jp didnt have hard raids at launch
they were bugged
he's not responsible for any bans btw
it's gonna be at 1 hp
dont need teams
should we unpause?
ill unpause later when people get in
he has a carol up with 1 hp btw
just poke <#673253184885489696> i guess
then kill
Pause and give reactions and unpause when we hit the react amount
with sanic?
ahegao new savior
micha dead
<@!676272618839605249> so basically we all join what ever coloured letter hard raid ahegao starts.     then we pause as soon as we join..... we un pause after someone says go or we reach the maximum emote
since 9.8, polk and firekeeper are here
should we do another head count
oh okay i see it
not seeing it too
there's 11 reacts on the recount
let's do a recount
sure
who's the 9th
ill stay for body and heart i guess
miracles are done already
yes
cause everyone does 1 damage
~~so you guys dont get banned~~
make sure to unfollow ahegao when you  guys are done
thanks ahegao <:KirikaApproval:586957465552158720>
just saving  them for future units
i can somewhat help with techs now
okay im done. thanks ahegao <:KirikaSalute:620069889838809089>
wow carol actually killed someone before i could attack lul
what number are we  going at
im coming
sure
made 5 slots
k cleared
yeah gimme a sec
i just did a quick poke and left
it's up
alright lemme clear this quest first
i can host if you want
did any of sanic's accs get banned
ill probably hop in after i finish dailies for another game
i can probably help use up my 10 cp
<@!478439753025585155>
i think
that's not sanic
youd expect them to at least go through all the xd chars once before rerunning it
~~so next month for global~~
but xd serena
they prob banned the cheaters in pvp and advent
so everyone gets banned
or maybe the cheaters are big braining and helping everyone
ill take the rage i guess
and let the cheater acc leave it at 1 hp to get full loot
or they can probably try to do at least 10% damage to the boss while opening it to their cheater acc
and then just loot it
would be easier to follow the cheater on your main
but why would they open to all
thanks mousy
who are we missing
i added
i do around 470-500k
how much do you do per 5cp on power raids?
ill come for the carols
so 6 or 7?
idk why my xd jii used her heal skill to kill but oh well
if it's ahegao, it's here
even randoms
i think everyone is able to see the raids now
ahegao
green carol
thanks for the carols ahegao <:KirikaSalute:620069889838809089>
ill skip dragons
who
~~i already spent money so they cant ban me~~
not that im low on mats but not sure if worth
debating on getting her to 70
what lvl is the welfare kanade in your int team cais
ill be 15k tomorrow
if anyone needs tech, mine has 100k left
he did
~~game will prob de dead before then tho~~
gotta stock up on mats for the future
green carol
ill stay for carols and heart i guess
thanks ahegao <:KirikaApproval:586957465552158720>
yeah
so 3 or 4
spice <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
guess ill see who killed it
so not me
im paused
who's the straggler
i dont even have event units so doesnt matter to me
that's what i do
waiting for last person on 2nd
who's the last one
you can see who hit it
ill come for carols
ill come for int
ill sit out for tech
well i went at 5 cause i saw 4 in the headcount
ill stay for bodies
we did green
well i see 5 reacts and 5 on the up
thanks onii-chan
sanic is alive
my guaranteed 5* was literally at 100/100
magiorecord has a terrible rolling system despite the free rolsl theyve been giving
chinese name with kurisu in katakana at the end
im sure the rank 1 guy in pvp has a modded alt to farm raids with
more body units next event confirmed
everyone
unpause i guess
miracle
yeah
unless someone on my fl sniped
refresh
till you 3 get in
make sure to pause when you guys are in
i think youre following me
k gonna open now
ill open in a min

it's prob already dead if other players joined
dont think i need it anyways
no crystals for me rip
hopefully will be the only time ill whale for someone

i whaled the 80 pack just for kiri
you got mlb xd kiri?
now you can lu xd kiri
