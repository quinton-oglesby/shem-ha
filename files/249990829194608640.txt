I look at that and all I can see is the determination to fist meme
<a:BikkiSteppy:681651853053788236>
To remove the background?
I took it from the OVA <:LUL:596099724956794911>
Also yes I do
Probably

<:SadBasa:648202282122477589>

<:SongStone:688213105284874240>
It's a bit low res, but at emote size I don't think that should be too bad
How's this?
I might be able to do that
There we go
<:TomosatoGun:688199550556700772>
*That time Tomosato pulled a gun on Fujikata during lunch*
I should edit that one too

You win this round
Fine
Grr
How so?
<:ElfneinSmug:682759674617135173>

Wow you work quick
But then I would have a reason to leave like 70 servers that I am only in for their emotes<:Cry:351383599980740609>
<:KirikaSmug:607742561414676517>
Got it
More gifs
<a:HibikiCheer:620778132257112103>
Heresy.
REMOVE EMOTES?
<:CarolSmug:617040484111745027>
Clearly we will just have to raid the Discord offices and give the server even more emote slots!
That is the downside <:sadmiku:642514783899222026>
You can be cheeky with the gif ones tho, make a two frame gif of identical frames and you got yourself more static emote slots <:ElfneinSmug:688236836891656246>
But that just means less to sort through?
Also that
<:HibikiBlep:605209109284782090>
That's not a bad problem to have
Chris channelling some Ogawa energy in that emote

You should watch the OVAs
Maybe you should?
Not even half
Referring to everyone with he/him is like running around waving your hands trying to high-five everyone. Sometimes you get a high five, sometimes you miss completely, sometimes you slap someone in the face
Though I'd go more for a gut punch
Tbh that pretty much sums it up
Because they *don't* have pronoun roles
On several servers I put pronouns in my nickname to avoid this sort of situation
Possibly with other people
Pronoun roles would help stop this happening again
