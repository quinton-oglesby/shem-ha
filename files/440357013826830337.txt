dess_timely
oh i have to wait
dess_timely
thanks
oo
dess_timely
dess_timely
so i did something
look at my meme drawing
Oh
Weed powered
oh
i dunno tf is she wearing
rv_mycard something something Kamen Rider
but its chris
this one was probably the underwhelming one
rv_mycard Just Normal Chris
or use it
who do you play this
Oh well
I dont like the fanbase
Ew haikyu
I would go play the sport instead of watching an anime about it, it is the equivalent of watching a game of it
What is the purpose of me liking sports anime if i dont even like sports to begin with
I dont watch sport anime
At all
This sounds like the anime i would not plan to watch
I had considered it in a poll
I have never heard of this at all
Okay so... I will have JJK, Assassination Classroom in my poll
Ah
I am basic but not too b as ic
Dont insult me
Bc i watched gaim and seen him
Kikaider i will look at
No demon slayer
Not demon slayer tho
The first three not really but i will give it a try
Hokuto no ken sure
May add this
Simple but good
Kinda want something that is familiar not unknown to me knowledge
Lets see
Those are ones i loved
Kill la Kill, JJBA, obviously symphogear, um
Maybe i should tell you what anime i have watched then
Need some hype
Alot of people rec me this but i am not interested
I kinda want something hype tbh
It is because i am doing a poll on twitter
Hm
Hit me with some good recommendations
Okay
Unless if it is kill la kill or death note
Subbed for me bc i just dislike dubs
I am not gonna watch a dub
True
Lmao
Even if the choice i thought was caca it was actually good
Bc my followers literally never steer me wrong
Letting followers tell me what to watch
Ass class is in first
Alot of people voted assassination classroom and initial d and JJK tied
So far
Sure why not i will add it
I am considering initial d
Hm
Sorry to offend fans i just dont like tanks
Still have to finish too
And i have seen bobobo
This is the dumbest anime i have ever laid eyes on
;-;
Why is it quiet
One more
Okay so... What i have is Assassination Classroom, that anime that has that made up sport, JJK
The only one i would more likely consider is maybe basketball if i were to go down the sports route
Pass
No
I just forgot
What is even the sport they play in haikyu
No need to play made up sports
True not his fault i just dont like that alot of anime i k ow about have him voicing a generic or boring/dull isekai lookong protagonist or something
Newer dubs try too hard to sound good to me
That is why i dont like him
Todd Haberhorn is the king of voicing generic anime caharcters
I mean natsu was passable to be fiar but i dont like the voice actor tbh
Digimon faithful
And man i hate erza and natsu voices alot
Man i hate fiary tails dub
Yeah especially funimation dubs
I wouls look for fansubs that are accurate to source material
I dont like dubs bc most times they can not be accurate or that localization ruins the actual meaning
Hm
Just dunno which one
I know that Kirikas va is in Konosuba right?
I found Maria mid so that is why i never cared for the voice actor for me
I dunno her voice doesnt stand out to me like Yuuki Aoi or Nana
Not that i dont want to just dont feel like it
Yeah i know that chris va was in sao but i dont plan to watch sao
I dunno i am not a fan of her voice actor
I know that Kirikas is popular and Marias
The only symphogear vas that I never had gotten to see in different anime are Kirikas, Shirabes, Chris and Marias
But this one is like between and it is jarring for me to hear this
Or the two mokas it is very much the same
I am used to either her vocal role playing Tsubasa or Tsubomi
Like she sounds weird to me here
Like... She sounds mid here
Man
I mean like
Miyuki sawashiro is alright
Like real jarring
It is gonna be very jarring for me to hear nana playing a naruto character
I didnt know this
I will never get into naruto anyways but man
Wait i didnt know she voiced hinata
I actually didnt know she voiced Moka until like a season later
Yeah
I like nana mizuki acting but i dont like tsubasa
For some reason
It automatically makes me hate whatever character he voices or gives me ptsd
I can never ever handle Mugihito voicing any charactet after him being Fudo
Yeah it be like that
That is true japan has a broader choice and newer people come in alot more
Yeah
Imma leave
I dont mind the fans i just dont wanna hear about it
I dont really want to hear about aot
Man
I dont really read manga but
True
Maybe bc i like the eng dub more than jp dub in klk and am based but
It is the rare moment where I like the eng va more than the jp va
Same thing with Ryuko Matois Va like she is popular but I dont like her va that much
Like it just meh
I just not a fan of her voice acting
Eh i mean
I dont like rias imo
Like some characters i would be hype for but man
I dunno like it would be jarring for me
Man if i were to get into this anime it would bother the crap out of me
I heard she is good
Annoying*
And find them annoy as fuck
I know that is her only trait but characters like these i would drop straight to f tier
The only character i dont like is aqua bc she is useless
Eh
Like i dont even know what anime she would voice in
The only one that i never like hear of is Shirabe va
I find her va good
Yeah
Me neither but i am interested
I think you are accurate
Sure that is fine
Yet i like the aspect of mechas
I kinda do t like if someone were to recommend me any mecha anime i would say pass
I want to get into it but at the same time
I dunno like
It freaks me out
Knowing what those giant robotd mean
Have you tried to finish this
I will try to finish
If I have enough strength to
Dont worry
I will continue
It is mainly bc of alot of twitter posts about eva so
True
To watchthis
Bc i have this slight fear but also slight bravery
Is it normal to decide to start this show slow af
I havent even watched ep 2 yet
In ep 1 only
I already got fucked up over one scene no maybe two scenes
I need alot of courage for this one
This one is a whole nother level
The obly thing that gave me spine tingling thrills was Garo VR and Death Note
Like it makes me more curious with the price of more suffering and harm just finding out
Man
How I reacted: https://twitter.com/CycXJoker/status/1370194081851260929?s=19
I have started evangelion
I dunno just have dofferent tastes
I don't like the eyes
They kinda look ugly to me
No offense
||And i honestly would be scared for reis moment when it happens||
So far just feeling bad for the man
It will make this anime more fearful
Imagine a bully comes to bully him
Oh nah
And place in spoilers
You can spoil me i rather get heads up
What happens ep 3
True
Slightly creepy but not as crazy as first ep
Finished ep 2 of eva
Update
Making me curious but also fear
Hm
That food
So is that gonna fuck with me too
Hold on
I dunno what they did but
Will try
But will try to have some strength
I am fear
And ||seeing rei broke me so hard||
So far I am in fear like Shinji so far
||so it is basically the mechas are the mothers, and the pilots are the children||
Man i feel strong rn
On twitter
Ialready wrote some thoughts
You know it
So it maximized my sad for a minute
I think I was stoned as well
Yeah it did
I am afraid but will struggle thru this
Reis appearance made me almost tear up
Yeah
Bc i was one the verge of crying
It had me close my anime for a moment
A little fucked up
Ep 1 got me
But man
But go thru some of the shitty shit that is bound to come
It must be that good to have you feeling brave to watch an anime
Man
I feel amazed at how brave I feel even though I am knowing that I will face certain doom the deeper and deeper I get thru this show.
True
I will be like shinji, be in fear, but going through shit like a champ
I k ow there will be some fucked up stuff later on but man
I dunno
Just lile Shinji
Like I am in fear but I feel brave enough to continue it
Why am i like the one who can comprehend this anime better than others
But you got to face those fears
He is scared and it is okay to be scared
I dont understand peoples mindsets
He is a coward
Wtf
I feel how he feels
I can see this guy put some effort
He is
He is scared but he go apeshit
Shinji has alot of guts
I can tell you this tho
But even I feel the fear he feels
I feel bad for the guy and this is a fictional anime
It is only ep 3 amd he looks lifeless
He looks like he been drained
But man that episode is brutal for him
Wasn't too bad but shinjis scream caught me off guard and spooked me a quick moment
So i survived ep 3
Man
Ok
Any last warnings of ep 3 of EVA before i start?
Hope some people fan sub it
Those animes didnt do anything wrong to be jailed in netflix
Man
May watch edens zero
Hm
Will probably watch madoka of it is that short then
See ya tho
Loose
Just gonna leave before hell breaks lose
I guess
12 eps
Hm
Ep wise
I mean sure but how long is madoka
I know Nanoha is probably like Symphogear length right?
I dunno
Doing a poll of course but
Debating to watch either Nanoha or Madoka
I will wait patiently for a rider or madoka collab
Same
And that intro scene raw as heck
But the first episodes beginning reminded me of Samurai Jack
They mustve had a budget budget for that stuff tho
Madoka is an acid trip
Man
And too messy as well
It just lacked stuff for me
Just not for me
But gaim was intense
Yeah it is
Gaim is way too watered down next to madoka
Man like
But Gaim is literally nothing compared to Madoka
Maybe bc I had watched Kamen Rider Gaim rtoo
I am enjoying this show tho
Man
No wonder it looks so jarring next to the style
Yeah
True
Ah
Look
Ah
It makes me brain feel like I am overdosed on pills
Like man
When they fight the witches
These weird locations they enter
It is normal to percieve some of those moments actual acid trips
Still cant conprehend some shit in Madoka
My guys
But not now
I would not mind getting into aot
Yeah
It looks ugly
Just
You can like it i dont hate it
It is one of the ugliest looking anime to me with these giant skinless gaints
I never understood the premise of AOT
Yeah true
The only shonen i watched fully was yugioh
It be like that
Yeah
I dunno what to say
Just
Symphogear is shonen
Was
Like how MHA
Like it became really popular to everyone
No i mean
Imagine if Symphogear actually blew up tho
Lmao
They are just old
Yeah
And pretty ugly designs
OP i dont bother too long
And alot of bad from naruto
I only heard good from bleach
I dunno
Everyone either dunks on naruto fans, or just fight against each other
On twitter
I only heard bad from naruto
And
Instead of watch
OP is too long and I would have to read more
The one I would lean towards is Bleach tbh
Just curious
What is a good big 3
Okay
W is just good place to start
Same
Also Build is a good place too
Those are my favroties
If you like
I would say W or Fourze to start
Like Tomokazu Seki voiced the Gokaiger Mobirates and Miki I now found out he did the Genesis Driver from Gaim
I know anime voice actors from alot of toku morphers/drivers now
Bc the funny shit is now
I literally know most of them from toku and some anime
I will try to get into the hype eventually if it wasnt so fricking long
It is okay but the dub is superior imo
I dunno
I didnt like KLK original jp one tho
I watched DN with both sub and dub
Or even klk and death note those had good dubs
Unless it is like different like bobobo
I dont do dubs period anymore
Yeah
Or tried to use alot of modern slang internet people use
I heard some of the Vrains dubs and they are atrocious
Yeah
Like kamen rider
But 5ds also is good bc they went all motorcycles and stuff
May stick with GX first tho
I still have to watch 5ds and gx
Hm
I guess it doesnt count at all
So
I watched 4kids yuhioh
Just for now
Head jokes with her no
Mami is fine
Taq
Any head jokes i will brutally murder someone with my words
Ah no problem but
Forgive me for this but yeah
This show makes my fight or flight response act up
So forgive my rude ass
That episode was a bit rough for me
But you got to realize that
Okay forgive ne
Man your humor is so bad.

Come back to me when you actually have a funny bone.
||when I saw those pills, I knew and reacted 

And she died. Decaitated. And then ep 4 just goes and hits you with the feels after

Madoka saying she is okay while witnessing a decaptiation really did a number on me bc i knew she wasnt okay

No one is okay when this shit happens||
||But I did except Mami to die literally bc of the backgrounds||
Not funny
But man gutbusted me
Finished ep3 and 4
Madoka still crazy
My guys
It is the perfect cell of pokemon
Zygarde is cool as hell
Ah
I hate charizard
Except charizard
Pokemon arent like deep for me to hate or like
Okay but what is your favorite pokemon
I dunno
Ah i dont have favorites for pokemon but
I may not agree but you opinions are valid enough
Okay i can be fine with peoples opinions
Man
It is just a shape
But
Dont disrepsect
It is just a tent
But i want those weird monsters to get obliterated
It may be you guys
I literally find nothing about them cute
<:ShirabeWeep:701475635025019000> urging to not press the spoiler
I find them disgusting than cute vut whatever
In eva
What first monster
But madoka rn is pretty higher imo than eva atm
Evangelion and Madoka give me that same fight or flight response
Call me wrong thwn but
I dunno
I am only on ep 4 for eva
Understandable ep 1 is a bit hard to watch too
I guess jot actualy but kinda is
Hm
Yes it is
It is just the evangelion of mahoi shojo in reality
There isnt a definitive magical girl genre and i dont want anyone to praise it as one of the best one
It isnt definite imo
If i tackle it as a mahou shojo it will ruin my thoights on other mahou shjoj
I appreciate it but my mentality so I dont get ruined for the genre is that i am experiencing it as an experince
Yeah
Gaim is probably more hype tbh
But gaim is nowhere near as crazy as madoka
And bc i watched gaim
I am kinda doing it for a friend i know
Horrorific fight od flight feel to it as well as it feels like an acid trip
Just has that
It isnt terrifying
Stay Night better tbh
Like FZ is like really low on my watch list
Tbh I find Gaim a bit better than Fate Zero but that's just me
No offense
It's hard to find interesting anime for me these days
I still haven't found any anime I'm seriously committing to
Yeah
Yeah
Nor am I confident in reading it in order
Manga maybe but my attention span isn't the best at following manga
It probably won't be something I'll get into
Yeah true
I don't understand why people like to read more than watch something but that's just me
It's a better experience
That's just my opinion
I prefer watching anime than reading manga
I don't really know many magical girl anime that fully copied madoka
It's probably don't exactly describe all of them but post SAO anime, yeah they mainly are
All I think about isekais is Power fantasy harem anime
Whether that's really overblown or not, I dunno and I'll never find out
By more people
I only know of SAO is really people saying how terrible the anime is
Same here taq
Yeah
^
Not just SAO but wasn't that one also a huge factor
Isn't that the one Isekai that influenced most isekais as well
Yeah
At least it's better idea than the smartphone Isekai at least
No offense
I think the slime Isekai is a really stupid idea
Maybe something just before SAO era
Not saying I won't
My impressions on isekais are tainted that it's probably hard for me to get into one
I hate the fact with creativity not being creative
That's why I cannot hate the definition bc there isn't a limit
Bc it has so much potential
I don't think the ideas behind isekais are bad
The only issue I have with magical girl fans is that some also like idol anime which I dispise
Precure is a great mahou shojo series
I mean that's true, it's just hard bc I dunno why but I don't get interested in mechas despite me wanting to get into them
I think Madoka happens by luck
If you mock an Isekai for doing the same common shit, that's allowed in my book
It's just very intimidating and hard to find something
I'd watch Mecha anime but
I watched the first three seasons when I was younger
Yeah I like Digimon
Harem*
An Isekai has alot of potential yet all people do is stick to the same fantasy heram settings
SAO probably ruined some of the creativity of the idea
Popular ≠ Great
Yeah I mean money is money
I just really hold back, if there's something interesting but popular I will wait til it stops being too talked about then I watch
And SAO
Yeah I'm not trying to be rude, I really blame the common fantasy harem garbage that most isekais have
I don't like isekais
Even has keywords and other ethereal bullshit that's blazing
Bc it has deep lore
Or get deeply invested in it and try to get deep into the lore
It's either you shut your brain off and Pog to it
Yeah
But that's the beauty of it, it's flaws are probably it's greatest strengths
Flawed and human
Over time I learned Symphogear is a very human show
But yeah even if it has deep stuff, I think if it was more accessible or explained right there yeah
It has some deep stuff if you decide to look into it
Don't think Symphogear is that mindless tho
Was it good enough, yeah it was, it was hype and had emotional moments
Could stuff be done better, definitely
Personally like I accepted most parts of Symphogear
I do find some of you guys pretty knowledgeable about stuff here
I think Kamen Rider/Sentai did alot of better stuff for me than Symphogear only certain parts
I just never talk about it on twitter
If I didn't care about it I wouldn't be part of Symphogear servers
Same here
Symphogear is really good tbh just it can fall short on certain stuff
Just don't like the certain people who yelled "Watch Symphogear, Hibiki is a hamster"
Over time I got annoyed by some fans but then realized it was myself and needed to work on myself and stuff
Same here really a mutual got me interested in it
^
Even in a hard time in my life
Then again, I didn't think I would have been into Symphogear but here I am, I finished the series all the way and it was something that kept me going
Yeah like if you're really invested in it
I can if I feel like it, don't get me wrong
And I'm like, yeah this isn't for me so why bother
I look at the thing people show
Oh yeah that's another reason why I probably won't get into Yuyuyu, alot of side content that requires you to read or get thru a LN
It's a great anime yeah
I wouldn't call KLK mahou shojo but
But the ones I enjoyed I would recommend
I don't like every single one
Not all are built the same but they are pretty good
I feel like it's an underrated mahou shojo series
I do like Precure
Maybe I don't like the music
Yeah I guess, I just cannot put myself to watch it
But I dunno, Madoka is fine but it doesn't feel worth me going thru
Just not interested
I can't really get into Yuyuyu tho
I know Yuyuyu and Symphogear exist but they seem alot more interesting than Madoka
Or at least don't make Fudo the main focus of XV
20 at least
They needed more
I felt like the ending was good
Like XV was fine but could have been done alot better
Yeah
Compare to all of first episodes, XV pacing was molasses to me
That felt like the slower episode to me
Ep1 was really slow tho isn't it
Realistically
XV was like a 7/10
She was probably the most boring one of all of them
The only Autoscorer I didn't like at all was Phara
I know it's pretty repetitive but I noticed it
The weird shit is that alot of concerts always end up being atta ked by enemies
It was when XV happened is when I enjoyed her
When I watched GX I didn't want to admit this but I never cared or was interested in her first time watch
They were interesting but Carol I'll agree with
GX had the autoscorers
Also hated Fudo well so much, but at the se time his villainous charisma is what made me also enjoy this bastardly villain
But then again they had that reason to fight dirty anyways
I hated NR but they were interesting to see them fight despite them being cowardly
Yeah we can agree
Cag is fine
The songs is an exception
I also didn't like some of the duet moments they didn't age well for me
Yeah they did alot worse shit but they were alot more entertaining
Not being rude but I did find NR alot more entertaining than Top Brass
No offense but I didn't care or got interested in the Illuminati, yeah even St Germain either
AXZ*
I found AXX the worst of the bunch
Mine s1 > GX > XV > G > AXZ
And XV was great but could have been a whole lot better
G was pretty low
S1 first favorite
GX was second favorite
I think AXZ was my least favorite season
Instead of repeating what they did in G
Shem ha would have been a better villain if they did something better
No offense
Miku being shafted wasn't a great thing and XV use of her was probably one of the worst ways to do it
S1 is one of my most favorite seasons too that I feel other seasons didn't do
Surely this would definitely influence me in the future
GG is everything I probably wanted for me, the banger music, the diverse cast, the references, the memes, and a fighting game
I was a fan of Jojo for a while but over time got tired of the fans and grew out of that phase
This game is also made for me
Yeah
"RiDe ThE lIgHtNiNg!"
~~or me using Sol to do his fire fist attack I forgot what it was called~~
That's just me using Chipp to do his Gamma Blade
~~you thought I was gonna say Jojo, nah I can be more creative with my inputs~~
Fucking Gill from Street Fighter except replace the fire and ice with Gold
Adam was like
Like I barely remembered it
I never got to click with that arc for some reason
Which fitted what it tried to tell about him
For the most perfect being, he seemed to do nothing really interesting
I feel like he could have been utilitized more but I think it's best he wasn't to fit his cowardly character
Adam was a pretty good villain
AXZ was pretty barren in terms of being interesting
Could have been done better
I think there is lore to compensate on the OVAs but I agree
Needs no explanation
Oh and Laura herself
At least we had Chris play the scrunkly shrimp baby
Glad to have Miku and Kirika be part of this season
ooi
