Does anyone know where I can commission an emote?
General chat sent me here.
Can I hop on too?
Who's raid is this?
What makes you say they're nerfing the bosses again?
I got rainbow crystals
Thanks guys
Does anyone want to do a hard power raid?
I sleep. <:HibikiTired:422925410490253313>
Added wayfarer
234193134
One sec let me log back into the gamr
Uh
I removed some people
I'll help too
I don't think I'm following them. <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
Who's raid is it?
I'll help out
It's mad at you
Didn't it die?
I'll have to look for that
nice.
Blank your boss killed both my healers on turn 2. <:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
if they're dead the fight becomes way easier
carol has additional enemies
are the adds dead?
234193134
I don't have it added to my name in discord
Starting it once I get my player ID from the game
I'll start a carol raid and kill the adds if anyone wants to hop in after
My current team for carol
So I can do like 25% of the adds health with 5cp now
I'll hit it
I'll probably be farming carol as well in a few hours. Out to lunch currently
I just lu her last night
I can give it a go. I have 70 revive jii. Might be able to do more damage to them now
I can start a carol raid but I can't really do that much until the adds are dead
Adds should be dead
Add me if you didn't already
I started it
I think if Carol didn't constantly skill lock the fight wouldn't be that hard
234193134
Ok I've removed some people that hadn't been on in a few days
I'll open another once I have slots open
Sure give me a sec. Sorry for disappearing from discord on and off. I'm on discord mobile

Revive Jii has been doing so much work for me today.
His time is almost up. I just started mine
Ya hit Credd's
The adds on my raid are almost dead too
But MDF Chris is there just to die. She's only level 40
My first lineup only has burnbasa and MDF Chris
I usually kill them both around the same time
How does this even happen?
There's a large disparity in remaining HP of the adds in your raid Vredd
I'll hit it too
IDK why someone would play this game without watching the anime
I've been reviving red jii and then she'd AoE Heal everyone. 
This time Carol just insta smacked her once she got revived
oh Carol was tired of my shit
I'm on like turn 40
I'm still fighting Credds raid ^-^;
like 55
Its all flying away
üí∏
I'm a üêã and I like Jii
What color is XD Jii anyways?
I'll need them for XD Jii so this works out
ahh
What characters use her mats?
So why exactly to people want to kill Green Carol so much anyways?
Ya that hurts my revive Jii by quite a bit
Is she the one that does the poison?
At least we're not getting stunned anymore now that Phara is dead
I think I spend more time skill locked against Carol than not
adds are dead in Credd's raid
Why are there so many good Jiis?
Revive Jii died for me constantly yesterday before LU
LU gave her a lot of stats
She'll probably die
everyone is dying
fuck I turned auto skill off on accident
I don't even know how to do that
I don't know how those words got italicized
My total lineup is. 70 Revive Jii, 42 Burnbasa, 40 MDF Chris, 40 3*red Jii, 50 4* blue Dr Jii, 60 MDP Chris
She won't revive people if you still have stuff that can sub in
Gotta stack your backline with your heavy hitters though
takes less damage from adds and I can usually get like 3+ revives off at the end
no 5* green jii
Carol raids
oh ya int raid rekts me. I have too many red characters
Which one is int raid?
I'll help
I gotta burn AP/EP before anymore raids real quick

Longest anime original of the decade I believe
People should watch the anime
ok dad
too much reading
I haven't started any raids yet. <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
I see
is she phys?
I think I have maria
So why is the int raid so much harder than the other raids?
I might be able to get 3 percent before it kills me
Aren't there like contribution levels too?
Isn't that how this works?
But the more I smack it the better stuff I get
I'm dying to it if that counts?
Good thing I didn't LU my MDP Chris again
Neat
oh
Might open one of those
What color is XD Shirabe?
I started both carol raids and an int raid
I've got like 50 left. I work everyday but Sunday. <:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
I'd like to kill them both if possible
I don't know if I have Hazzy added
I'm going to smack Credd's for now
well then
Wayfarer's died
Should we kill Credds green carol?
How many does XD Shirabe take?
Now back to smacking wayfarer's raid

I got a lot of gigas from those
nvm found it
I can't seem to find your raid Wayfarer
neat
Tell me when you start Carol and I'll take a few swings at it
I will hit it
why in 2 hours?
I should probably do arena
eventually got tired of my shit and one shot her
I was fighting her and she couldn't kill my Jii fast enough
oh ya I was in that sort of situation earlier
Who is your healer?
nice
Tapping punchkuns real quick too then going back to wayfarers
oh ya I was hitting his too
Who's raid are you doing?
Leiur is dead in Wayfarer's green carol
I guess I'll kill the adds on Wayfarer's
What raid are we attacking now?
someone just nuked Credds raid
Adds are dead in Credd's now
I've almost killed both the adds
I thought we were working on Credds
dope
oh we're bullying carol again?
My level 70 is green so IDK if I can help that much with power raids
What raid are we doing now?
Found it
same
I just got home. What are we killing today?
My level 70 character is green so red raids are annoying
Right now I'm saving those mats for XD Shirabe. I don't do many red raids currently
I still haven't LU my Chris to 70. <:ChrisAngry:336656958272700417>
I just wanted to kill it so people aren't wasting their attempts.
Its basically full health
He only has like an hour left on it
I'm going to start killing the adds on his green Carol if anyone wants to hop in once that's done
Is ActualShip someone here?
Its not the same
I'm at like 60 turns against Carol and she won't kill me
I'm still fighting it
ok will do\
I just whack other peoples raids and hope it works out. <:warshrug:658781267638091782>
XD Jii <:UniFlex:490512775576027136>
Took me 3 attempts just to kill the adds and then when it was just Carol I did like 600k in one fight
You're welcome.
Not out right killing them like I thought she would at some point
But she was still just hitting my units
After turn 100 she started to really ramp up in damage.
I found that out a little bit ago
Does Carol ever get to a point where she just kills all my units?
<:ShiraBean:661294258795446326>
Revive Jii won't die and just keeps bringing everyone else back
That's the same thing I do
What are you using her in?
You're welcome
He doesn't only get on a 5am
Can someone explain what I'm supposed to do though so I don't mess this up for others?
I'm following now too
I can't follow Sanic. <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
Why do you unpause at 17?
What's happening?
I need P but if no one else does then I can do it on my own later
Who uses rainbow crystals anyways?
agreed
go?
I see
‚àû
Wait can we use gems to refill?
30
Tell Phara to stop stunning me plz
9point8's carol is dead
I'll ping you if its still up when I'm out
I'm probably going to die around turn 80. I'm down to just MDP Chris and XD Jii
I'm hitting it now but I've been in combat for like 60 turns
Is your Carol dead already?
I'll hit it once I'm done with this advent. <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
once I'm done with advent runs I'll probably do mine
I think my H units are pretty bad. <:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
What's strong against T again?
Plus I've already spent a good sum on Shirabe birthday banner
I want to spend but I don't want to chase after 3, 0.8%
I have the mats to LU XD Shirabe. I just need more XD Shirabe. <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
This is how my carols go most of the time now. Not the greatest damage per turn but it's pretty consistent
I don't really even look at what the memoria does most of the time. I just use them for the stats
But Chris might not die anymore so <:warshrug:658781267638091782> 
I'll have to see how that goes
The least 3 units I want alive when I'm fighting Carol are Dr. Jii, XD Jii and Revive Jii
I wonder if 70 Chris will help me against Carol or if it'll fuck with the order my units die and cause me to die faster.
I actually have enough gigas to do both. I didn't realize that. <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
True.
I can already do gold SP
Should I use my power crystals to LU 3*red jii or MDP Chris?
It'd be pretty easy to find out if someone is consistently trolling
Sanic probably sets it so only followers can see
<:MikuGay:336656810788388864>
We'll go with that.
ya pretty much
Yes.
If you're in the raid and someone else kills it its still "Alive" for you. 
So if you also kill it you still get hunt bonus
Hunt implies you do the final hit
I stole someone else's copypasta
for any newcomers
so basically we all join what ever coloured letter hard raid sanic starts.     then we pause as soon as we join..... we un pause after someone says go or we reach the maximum emote
I gotta turn my pc on one sec
I'm still fighting your last one
I might as well go for top 3 damage
I'm still in the Carol raid
Adds should be dead in 9point8's raid
Should I buy rice or stat upgrades with advent points?
Also ya sorry I'm not in that one either.
I think that's Green Carol
The boss still has to spawn and everything
yes
I'm still killing Fine. <:KirikaPanic:644235681677180958>
for any newcomers
so basically we all join what ever coloured letter hard raid sanic starts.     then we pause as soon as we join..... we un pause after someone says go or we reach the maximum emote
I'm killing the EXP daily. <:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
I think your XD bikki killed all my units but revive jii at least once
Revive jii <:UniFlex:490512775576027136>
Yes
Your XD bikki took like 4 FM shots to kill
<@115964144120758280> are you punchkun in game?
Skill lock sucks. <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
Phara took like two hits when I went in
Adds should be pretty much dead.
And the hardest part of the fight is when the adds are up so whoever decides to kill the adds for everyone just gets cucked in the end
But if everyone thinks like that then no one kills the adds
Adds feel like such a waste of damage when multiple people are attacking
I also killed top add
I'm going to beat up Argo's raid for a little bit if anyone wants to help
EZ
You need green Carol then
XD Jii uses magic crystals?  I thought she used miracles
What items do you need?
What else do you need for XD Jii Argo?
iphone shouldn't matter
Probably using an emulator to hack the apk anyways
<:WarShrug:667158723189407764>

Also from what he said earlier today he's not doing it anymore
I had that problem when I was farming for revive jii. I was missing the normal melody crystals
I think its 
Challenge - Starting the Raid
Participation - Hitting the Raid
Contribution - 3/5/10% of damage done to boss. Higher percent = Better drops generally. 
Highest Damage - Top 3 people on damage
Hunt - Deal Final Blow
More damage you do the more loot you get
EZ
Someone came and just one shot my raid
I guess I have ignite Maria but idk if she can carry power carol at 0lb
I've been farming regular power raids for giga power. I don't have any good body units to kill the adds on power carol
Nice. <a:HibikiCheer:620778132257112103>
It's what I get for my main dps and healer being red I guess. Blue teams just go to town. <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
He's the one with XD bikki
Oh ya I fought actualships team too. Same shit happened as when I was fighting your team
I can fight some in a few hours. Out to eat now.
<a:HibikiPanic:670496622194589696>
Fuck it's on my pc
I screenshot your team one sec
Either way
Was that what it was?
Her damage starts to ramp up the longer you go
I can hit like turn 80+ pretty easy now unless she keeps me skill locked constantly. After like 100 though she starts hitting harder than I've been able to heal
Probably depends on how long she can keep you skill locked
Got Giga heart and Dex though
Same.
I will after Jotenha's Carol is dead
The adds are dead in your raid <@!315328906930421761>. Should be quite a bit easier now
Your follower list is full
Just not as likely
You can still get them just for tagging
<:ShiraBean:661294258795446326>
This thing hits much harder than I remember
I'll help once I'm done with Carol
And hunt bonus
I want top damage bonus though
I'm still fighting Dagurechaf's Carol
Why did I do this? <:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
Go my Jiis. <a:ShiraBear:605209734924075048>
I'll try my best
oof
400k damage in 25 minutes
<@!165030821353226240> I don't think I have you added
I have like 200k left on this thing
Give me a sec finishing Rakhi's Carol
Has anyone figured out how much health the Carol adds have yet?
I don't remember how many I have. I usually only refill CP on weekends
Sorry man my body units are pretty bad. <:warshrug:658781267638091782>
Past wave 30 I just stall out until I win
There's some sort of heal debuff before wave 30 so I have XD jii as my last unit to come out
Also generally gets at least 3 revives per fight
She's actually in my starting line up against Carol and survives till the end
Ya she was for me too until LU
Type advantage against the adds
Revive Jii does work here though

You'll love my team for this then
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
This takes forever
I need to get a 5* LU unit that can actually do damage
I hate all the CC
Do you want me to stop at a certain point so you can get the bonus for last hitting or just kill it?
Knowing my luck I'll get chain silenced and die by like turn 20 even though they consistently survive 100+ turns. <:pepeHands:633829577457795082>
Going to shower while my team kills the adds. brb
I'm hitting it now
Are the adds alive still?
Aight
I'll open mine up in like 10 minutes or so
Anyone need a Green Carol kill?
Does Leiur not have taunt anymore in the Carol Raid?
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
<@!263392442345193472> Its dead
Everyone be farming CC
Ign?
Who's is it?
I can kill Dec carol
I have 108 giga dex
All my dex mats come from Carol
IDK how though when I never do int raids
I have a decent amount of int mats
I think if I LU 3* int Jii I could be ok
I have LU Ignite Maria
oh ya I forgot her adds are int
gun!
I don't really have a damage dealer
My only decent int units are Dr. Jii and welfare Kanade
I don't have good int units so I can't be of much help with that one.
<@!174272493777977344> its dead
<:NotLikeFist:689188869974786133>
I forgot her adds did extra damage to edgebikki
ok I'm attacking it Kat
With any other franchise I'd be like nope 100% not going to happen. With symphogear I find it hard to believe until I actually think about what happens in the show. Then I'm just like. Whelp. Just let it happen.
<:NoBully:522425983006146580>
I still can't believe this is a real thing

Hey give her credit for at least already having the ring
I just want a Miku figure. <:HibiMikuCry:586026583870013455>
Damn
How much is quite expensive?
I can't paint. <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
Where do those Miku figures come from?
So is Chris going to marry Borger or spaget?
Elsa did nothing wrong
Don't bulli shirabe
You can't kill shirabe
Thanks
Would it be possible for someone to dm me the shirabe padoru art?

I've wanted to buy that but I can't paint. <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
<:HibiMiku:432007202136391690>
They are all cuties
I still desire the source
I desire the source for this
I'd take a tiny shemmiku

<a:BikkiBetrayal:658020710974750721>
My heart
Rockedeers
Lily take my üíµ
Lily you take commisions?
What is the new server icon?
My boss wouldn't care either
S1 Miku had green hair but that's really a vibrant green
Ok mikus hair was never that green
<@106866895076003840> do you take art commissions?
<:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
I don't want to see Chris being forever alone and I honestly don't think she'd get with anyone after what's she's been through unless it's someone from the main cast.
Chris is the best side dish


That's my favorite
Unless it's hibimikuchris
I agree with akeupho
Sure
~~I desire this~~
Maximum jii
Shes jiing into your soul
Miku Shem-ha is the hottest character in the series change my mind
I'm gonna cut this out and make it an emote later
I ship these two
<@257970367732121602>


Mustache

Not battle scarred hibiki this time. ~~technically~~
<:ArizonaGib:611004134619086858>
<:steal:603299640171036718>
Can I have all the hibimiku fanart?
~~hibiki is hot~~
I thought nagatoro was getting an anime
||doesn't kiridroid die?||
I need links
||did au Miku actually die? ||

I like bayonet charge the most
Chris?

My favorite geah doujin is the one about hibimiku before lydian
Lack of fisting in the geah doujins though
That's about right actually
If 19 sides are lewds
Easily turns any otp into an ot3
Chris is the best side dish
<:ArizonaGib:611004134619086858>
What fic?
<:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
I can't find my own pfp anymore
Dammit doesn't source

Nice
<:OhISee:495302100931051577>
Why does the bot have limited amount of sources?

I think this is the same artist too?
I think this is the same artist that drew the stroganettes in oversized shirts as well?
Not exactly the easiest thing to do
On phone
<:PepeHands:388107904580059136>
Game why
Plz
Source?

Like wife goals or personal goals?
I usually go to work->come home->eat->sleep->repeat
I play during breaks at work
It pays for gacha
I'm back at 6 12s though right now
I work minimum 5 10 hour days
Idk if I can make more time without quitting my job
How am I supposed to save things on my pc when I don't have time to be on my pc?
But I don't have time to be at my pc a lot
<:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
Plz halp
I have like 5k images
I save everything to my phone
Rip
Plz

Her inner thirst can only be contained for so long
SSJ
Or at least knows the songs
Ina has seen symphogear too apparently
<a:kanadedontfeelsogood:730780413689331763>
Shouldn't Kanade be "one with the force"?
