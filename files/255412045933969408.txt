Whenever I stumbled into a new discord, I feel lost when there's no channel descriptions
We should just bug discord to have a better note of it, at least on mobile it's hard to see.
It came up before where people had stumbled into live shitposting, accepted, then forgot, but I guess in that case adding it in the rules wouldn't really change anything since they'd forget still
Melua, only thing I would suggest is in the channels section mentioning that live shitposting is a NSFW channel
Looks good for me now, just needed to restart discord
Thanks radyjko, glad I'm not the only one unable to see it
Welcome to the ~~cave of yuri~~ fandom Annie
I wonder if the meme on r/animemes brought in people
I heard good things about them too, so I don't know what's up
He's the guy who said it was shipping out yesterday. Also both items said they'd be shipping out "April/may"
"shipping out today" `no ship notice on my order` HMMMMMMMMMM
Emailed asking about my order and just got the reply "shipping out today"
I should...
I'm waiting for USA Gundam to ship my my order. I got a FMP arbalist, and an M9E Gernsback. Both were supposed to ship out last month at the latest....
All the plamo I have, I'm at rookie numbers
https://i.imgur.com/6lvnePO.jpg






But anyway, I'm mostly annoyed with the lack of communication about the order. It would have been nice to receive an email saying that the expected ship date got pushed back, rather than waiting a month to get it sent out
`unlike other things I've bought`
Heh, just now got the shipping notice
The US
`still no shipping notice on my gunpla`
I also have a ~~Destroid Tomahawk~~ Warhammer, and a ~~Destroid Defender~~ Rifleman
<@!84811738653929472>   Battlemechs! From left to right there's the Marauder, Griffen, Ice Ferrit, and ~~Macross Destroid Spartan~~ Archer
being  far-sighted doesnt help
i did 4 and now my eyes wont focus within 5 feet
Trying out painting minis for the first time
this is why i have 2 SSDs, and 2 HDDs
RIP my hard drive space
so many Hibike X Miku, yet also never enough
What if it's picture of something named after a symphogear character?
Heh, I don't know how you do it
<:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
God, if I were rich I would hire Rukia to just on-demand give me adorable pics when needed.
We need more ChrisXFood fanart
<:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
I can't be the only one who screams "YURILICOUS!" in his/her head every time I see Hibimiku art, right?
My IRL friends really appreciated it
Ty very much!
Sure, take as long as you want
Rukia, this is off topic, but do you have any fanart of Bakugo from my hero and Megumin in the same picture.
<:HibikiShock:336656371611074580>
Has this piece of hibimiku been shared?
Or massive breasts...
Hibimiku 4 lyfe
I need some earth-chan yuri
Hibimiku <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
Tsubasa your flatness is just fine
I guess I just prefer flat
I feel like they grew significantly from the first series
I used that second one as a background for a while
I'm just bad at words Hibiki
So many of the coolest Hibike fanart gives her too big of breasts, why must they do this???
Hibimiku is what made me keep watching symphogear
Bikkii butt ;)
Rukia, got Hibiki in anything Christmas related?

Miciru is also great
Sachi is the best

The anime is pretty solid, but it just cant compress the ~80 hour VN perfectly into 13 eps
I watched the anime a while back, and am now playing through the second VN (finished the first months ago)
yes

Rukia, i thought i should give you some of my favorite Yuri
Ikr?
The fluffiest of yuri

https://goo.gl/images/B49bpG

More gear
I'm probably the resident military ota...
Note: named after this Tachibana
This is some sweet gear
i'll switch to PMs to avoid spoilers
oh thats from the game

I honestly think Michiru's arc was the best-presented in the anime. it didnt lose much in translation, and i think it actually gained a bit from having more motion
Motostrelki

https://goo.gl/images/JCkn5S
Upotte was great, they got everything right about how bad the L85 is

YES!!!!
Gate, is modern fighting fantasy. Jormungand is modern arms dealers

Essential equipment for everyday life in the US

Who is the second one?
I am emergency requesting art that will make me want to work harder. Please.
Wut?

I may have watched too much Stella C3 bu, and Aoharu x Machinegun
If I survive this semester with some spare cash, I'll buy this AK-5C
I like the Aug, but I can't do a 2-stage trigger
https://www.evike.com/products/44551/
I'll just buy that AK-5c and name it after my waifu instead
RIP
I keep telling myself theyre too expensive
I should really get a daki one of these days...
Oh good why


OMG who is that there in the T-60?
I need some more cute girls to convince me to get out of bed
i'm just too picky
what's your favorite pose?
yeah
so does that one above look off to you?
why am i so picky about Hibiki's poses?
i really like the style of these
god dutchko has some great art, but it's all dark AF


(fluffy is miya waifu)





how dare you???

they're both male, but i cant say for sure they're not gay

i can give you a comprimise
i was playing dressup with my various military equipment, and decided to pull out my vest and helmet
lol
She went from being a model crusader, the symbol of protecting the weak, to nothing but breasts.
Yes
Imo it makes her character worse
Her breasts grew stupidly large between book 1 and 4
This is a reasonable maximum size
This is way too large for me
But oppai loli has large breasts, so no TY
What?
I only like flat! Flat is love, flat is life, flat is justice!
I only like lolis because every non-loli has melon breasts

Not soon enough
Cat girls IRL when?
i like the one where they make the flip Iphone
I still love the flipflop that has the caption "may use an actual sandal instead"

Did you declare it as unsigned?
Not if it's a signed variable


Dude, you saw my notes from Friday right? There. Where. No. Numbers. Numbers are a myth!

want to know how to draw the best girly-guy? draw a girl, call it a guy
lol


Meanwhile I'm just over here going "I want any aeg that isn't an M4"
Yes!
Oh god
Also MW5 isn't going to have clammer Mecha, so it'll be pretty good.
MWO is bad because it's built on shitty systems, and the balance is utter shit. If MW5 is just MWO systems but single player, it'll be fun. They also promised it would be more extensive than previous mechwarrior titles.
Heh, I have more I can post when I'm on my computer again
This makes me want to keep going on









So far I only have the "Bakuretsu 3rd combat demolitions unit" one
ERJSOW would be cooler, but she doesn't have that kind of range
It's a type of bomb dropped from planes, the precision guided kind
She is the model GBU
Yes! A symbol of nobless oblige! And chivelry!
TY vm
I love the F-16 in that too
Damn, that's cool
As your mobile/computer background?
Hey Rukia, may I ask what your background is?
<:MikuBliss:336657233712513024>
I like feisty red heads, i think i'm slowly comming over to camp kanade
Ty vm
Rukia, I beseech there for backgrounds of Selesia from re creators \\('-')/
damnit, one sec
i'll have to check it out, i like fiesty red-heads
ahh

I tank it she fights on the eastern front?
Panzer 3s!
ahh, so not too familiar with WWII tanks?
what kind of tanks?
the russian AT rifle known for dislocating people's sholders
was that a mother fooking PTRS?
i need more izetta x Fine in my life
*nosebleed*

a mix of PZIIIs and PZIVs!
JU-87s!



ahh
ahh, you havent found one yet?
Rukia, i want to know who your waifu / husbandou is now. i promise not to judge
only one waifu, per laifu

why not?

Kirika would be like my laptop-- loud and hot-headed
Though to be fair, that laptop is an exception, not a rule. And there is a warning to not use it in your lap. 

Its a Razer Blade, where the whole casing is metal, and part of the computers heatsink...
I stopped using laptops on my lap when mine gave me a second-degree burn on my leg
Kerrik, if it's murder on your wrist you need to get one of those oppai mouse pads
according to my brother (a tank driver for the M1 Abrams) it's often hard to *not* drift the tank. The issue ends up being that tracks dont give you very good traction on hard surfaces, and tanks are very heavy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TG-pQbEmjRA

they need to make more Yukari figures
I just saw that das finale was out

yep, an MBT's life is it's mobility. Lose that and it's nothing more than a field gun at best
yep, it's a big problem. Most videos you will find of tanks drifting are either tracks with rubber pads and wet pavement, or steel tracks on dry pavement

`iron for a sword blade`

Get out of here
I prefer my blades to be made of VG10 steel
Again, the end result is steel, not iron. The process of filing and folding it results in removing carbon from the pig iron making steel.
That's steel, not iron
Can't even add carbon to your iron. For shame

i'm willing to accept that the geah lets them sing and breath in space, but they cant just go back on their own logic!

lmao
genjiro going extra hard-core here

Tsubasa already had some Trauma from S1, but jesus how is she going to overcome this?
oh holy shit
boy is Basa PISSED
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089> <:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
oh shit this concert is like S1 all over again
there's no point in how they have their gas masks set up..
The opening of this season is annoying me because the shot with the gas masks they have both a hose *and a filter* attached to the mask in different places
or a lot of sword-ing
it's okay Tsubasa, because you're a sword and swords can protect the world




aww, they gave all the noise segways
At least no one stays dead on symphogear. Also, anyone got the full op yet?
I'm trying to catch up to the current ep, but holy shit.
They could pull a fakeout, stab miku through the heart and she suddenly gets god-gear
"Omg miku died!"
Cough, coke-a-cola, Ford, GM, Chrysler, *Google*
But YouTube has stayed strong since like 2001
Ughhh there's so many popups with that first link
Question: anyone know what that thing the scorpion crawls into during the opening is?
At least she takes good care of her bikes `before smashing them into things`
Please someone help tsubasa
I'd like to make fun of tsubasa for being edgy this season but *God does she have full rights to* she very likely has PTSD too

Maybe SONG should hire a full-time psychiatrist, these poor girls are getting so much mental trauma
Chris is a good girl

*sigh* I need to make this now

So maria's parents were in Chernobyl?
Yay, I've caught up so now I can read the spoiler memes!
Christ not Basa's father too! HOW MUCH MUST SHE LOSE IN ONE SEASON???
Wow, maria's slaps are powerful! She straight up slapped an obedience spell off of basa!
God I love the direction this show has been going
ÔΩ°ÔæüÔΩ•Ôºà>Ôπè<ÔºâÔΩ•ÔæüÔΩ°

Episode 8, well shit... miku no!
the whole rocket thing at JAXA reminded me of the fight in Robotics; Notes
Hibiki's punches have gotten really upgraded
watching episode 10 of XV
I present Tsubasa the closest thing I have to a sword
Thank you!
I just like dominant women <:MikuGay:336656810788388864>
It doesn't have to be BDSM, as long as one girl is pushy and dominant
I don't know :P
BDSM is nice
Uhhmmm, yes? Something with a very dominant girl
Does anyone have really good Yuri Dojin? Doesn't have to be symphogear, just sexy Yuri
God I want a girl to dominate me like in Hatsu Date wa Lingerie Shop.
<:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
Yuri Girl, got any links to good femdom dojin?
Ohhhhhhhhh
Yuri Fgirl, what are some of your favorite dojin? i'm asking for a friend <:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
That's the whole point of to love ru!
Huh?
But to love ru has such great dojins!
Anyone else seen to love ru?
Yeah, what he said!
Sunstone?
It was Fakku's April fool's day prank last year. They made a dating site
Does anyone else miss fakku dating?
I think nhentai has a tag for it
Yeah
I think that usually has the tag "public" there's ones like when they're doing it on a crowded subway

‚ÄúKendall's (2007) findings suggest that rapes decline with the availability of online pornography, especially among offenders for whom the internet induced a relatively larger decline in the non-pecuniary price of pornography‚Äîmale teenagers. In both cases, it is possible that individuals with a greater risk of an illicit behavior self-select into the related virtual behavior instead.‚Äù
since someone asked for sources about people being exposed to things like porn, and violent video games self-selecting out of committing crimes related to those: 

Ward, Michael R. "Video games and crime." Contemporary Economic Policy 29.2 
(2011): 261+. Academic OneFile. Web. 2 Oct. 2014.
Yes
There's also the dozens of studies which have shown violent games make people less violent
While he/she is the "correct" method
Because they is a technically incorrect method to refer to a singular person
Seriously, I love the discussions we have in this group
`all of this because my mom was pushing alcohol on me`
I think it's your name as server owner that causes that <:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
So if "guys" can be accepted to be gender-neutral, why can't "he"?
Meanwhile I come from the US area where using something like "hey guys" is extremely common, even if a girl is addressing a group of girls
Rukia used "they" not in reference to a singular person though
I generally just use "the person with <visual attribute> rather than trying any pronouns anymore
oh
huh?

Maybe they didn't age it? Or let it oxidize. I've heard that it tastes like jet fuel until you let it age a month or so
What happened to it?
I like how the guides state how hard it is to actually mess up mead. Like you can literally ferment it in an open bucket
Wait, who? And I've been reading the guides on /r/mead
Anyone ever made mead before?
So now I'm left wondering how person B came to the conclusion that I was being a jerk. It could be any number of things from person A overstating the results of the situation to B (something A is known for, and has previously apologized for) or it could be that since I let my VP handle communications, he was rude to A in rejecting the offer (it's known that the VP and A do not get along at all). Or A could just be trying to manipulate various things behind my back, as I have heard A has done previously, but A has never done it to me, and has always attempted to make sure I would not see any of it for some reason.
So the drama is a bit of a story, the gist of it is:

Person A contacted me early into the semester concerned that he would really like to go to the convention with the club, but could not provide an answer by the deadline I had publicly set for RSVPing, nor could he meet the attendance requirements. I informed A that because he was a long-standing club member, I was willing to wave all requirements for him, and set the RSVP deadline for him to one week prior to the event.

Fast forward to two days before the event, person A contacts me, and some of my officers stating that he had a room in a hotel closer to the venue, and that there were other rooms open. A offered a very reasonable offer to pay for half a room, and allow the club to have 4 people in the room too. I discussed the offer with my officers, and we reached the conclusion that while it would be awesome to have those rooms, we simply could not accept the offer due to the complications it could result in if the university funding for the rooms did not work out. 

At the event I met some club alumnai who are good friends with A. The conversation with them started out polite, but quickly deteriorated to person B going full-out passive agressive. After I offered two retorts I removed myself from the conversation where one of them flat out said "you treated A like shit"
Though to be fair, I also had to deal with an unreasonable amount of drama for what should have just been getting 18 people from a club to a convention and back
Shutocon
God conventions are tiring

<@!127644949884698624> there's an automated beer brewer https://www.amazon.com/PicoBrew-PICO-Model-Brewing-Appliance/dp/B075CF1D72/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1521072760&sr=8-3&keywords=PicoBrew&th=1
All the way
ut-oh, i am faced with a serious decision: do i try to start fermenting my mead tonight around 9 pm now that i'll have everything i need, or should i just wait until tomorrow...
though also, the longest application i've programmed an arduino for will last around 7 years before it overflows....
also, any attempt to automate it with an arduino would fail, because millis() overflows at around 51 days
there's a reason why this isnt fully automated, and instead people manually check it.
mainly because i'd either have to have it measure the specific gravity to tell when it's done, or constantly check conditions so i could calculate out the specific gravity at any point and compare to what it should be (if it's measured, it may never reach the actual desired value, and thus stop). From there i'd need pumps to pump it into secondary fermentation, then it'd have to use a light sensor to determine if it has gotten clear enough (which it may never reach the spec). there it would have to then get bottled automatically. 

Automating it likely wouldnt save me much time considering the duration and scale of this. Frankly i think it would make me lose more time because of the amount of testing and trouble shooting i'd have to do
I could, but that would be such a pain in the ass
`thinking`
god my setup is gonna be so jerry rigged... The fermenting container is a bucket. I Dont want to buy an autosiphon, so i'm gonna use some tubing, and part of a pen to start the siphon, then use a set of vice-grips to clamp the tubing when i want to stop the siphon...
<@!127644949884698624> nope, no suicide here, just substance abuse

My mead is in secondary!
I find the issues with both generally come down to not understanding it.
In the winter it's useful, but in the summer it just means that the AC has to then take that heat and push it outside.
I suggested this to him years ago, but he finally did it. Now I'm worried because I also suggested that he just directly hook this up to the AC so that he doesn't have to dump the heat inside the house
Yep, and because the radiators are in the basement, it leaves the heat there. Not much entropy involved, mostly *enthalpy*
They do contain the hot water from the computer

Alice, you should see the setup my dad has for his computer now. He set it up so that his computer is water cooled, then put the radiators in the basement below his computer room. Ran the tubes through the floor up to his computer

Serious comment here: while the singular "they" is becoming extremely common for a gender-neutral pronoun, we don't have a gender-neutral direct-address. We have "sir" and "ma'am." I ran into this the other day when i did not have a method to address someone who's gender I did not want to guess at.

Because I know at my uni there's a professor who typically tries to fail 3/4ths of the class, then the director of the engineering program has to argue with him over how much they need to curve the course grade
And the uni just accepted failure of half the class?
Turn your work in to him just for spite too. Itll be hard to fail you if he has seen hard proof that you are putting in effort, and know what you're doing
If the proof still insists that they can't/won't accept it for credit you reply "I understand, but I want you to know that I can do it"
Do it in person
But <@183785454447886346> it's better to let him/her know that you do have something to turn in than to just take the zero quietly

I completely agree that if a federal government were 100% trustworthy, then states rights would only interefere. The problem; however, is that no federal government near this scale has proven to be trustworthy.
you're reversing that. a bad-meaning, and incompetent federal government is the issue. States rights are not a "bandaid" thrown over the issue
Really who doesn't have issues with the federal government?
So it's a bad thing that California can pass laws requiring clean energy when the federal government might otherwise tell them they cannot?

Speaking of which, why can't we just up our standards for bathroom stall quality (so no one can look under etc...) Then have no issue making all "bathrooms" gender neutral?
I like to avoid them as much as possible...
A great example of that was when the big pharma companies convinced the EPA to ban one of their propellants used in inhailors, just as their patents on the formilas were about to expire
i'm going to throw in that to start up a large, successful company these days requires absurd capital that the average person is not capable of obtaining. There are some which are able to do well regardless, but those are the statistical outliers. With all the current government restrictions/ regulations starting up a company to compete in any market (in the US at least) is nearly impossible no matter how innovative you are.
Keep in mind that the "1%" bullshit include people in field like engineering. but clearly we're doing "no work"

Anime club *is* how i made all of my friends
The other day i received a message to the anime club i'm currently president of. This is a bit of a wake-up call, making me realize that while this club has just been "Nerds watching anime" to me for the past few months, to others it might be much more important. When i joined the club freshman year, it was a warm place where we ended up with a close-knit group of friends by the end of the year, but the methods they used wont work for me this time (not enough time to have everyone over every weekend)

"I am very interested in joining this club. I was just wondering if it is easy to make friends. I have a hard time making friends and I am hoping to get more involved in campus life. I was also wondering what kind of movies will be screened. Will they be subbed or dubbed? I hope you get back to me soon Thank you very much and I look forward to meeting everyone."
But it feels like the weight of my position increased a lot... 

The big issue I'll have is I don't have the luxury of inviting everyone over to my place after meetings to just hang out, so I don't know much of what to do in place of that. Thinking something like a board game night where I can reserve a room on campus to have the event.
heh
(I have a tradition every semester that i suggest GuP for what we watch, but then never vote for it)
GuP?
I agree, and this semester GuP got 3 votes
Jojo part 2, Gamers, Re Creators, The devil is a part timer
So i managed to talk with my Anime club E-board yesterday, and apparently the first meeting was a hit, we had the room packed, and the new room we had resulted in a lot more conversation among everyone who was there.
You know you're mentally stable when simply doing the wrong assignment is enough to cause ayou to break down in tears üôÉ
Yeah. The rental is through my Uni, and their policy for damages is effectively they only charge you if they think you broke it. So i think there's a good chance they wont charge me regardless.

The bikes they rent out anyways are bikes that students just abandoned on campus

Why do I hate school so much? Because even something as simple as physically  writing a sentence is often incredibly frustrating for me.
that's probably it, dont really feel like doing much ever
no, i'd say i'm underworked if anything this semester. This should be my lightest semester since freshman year
Why is starting homework assignments so painful for me? Typically when i actually work on the engineering ones i get so caught up in the math that i'll forget things like food. But no, just the thought of doing them before i get started is painful...
That's a whole discussion of canon that i think is best to discuss elsewhere
Spartan-II women were described as looking very male though (because of the augments) Reach is supposed to be Spartan-IIIs, which were much "lighter"
yep
<@256945399338631168> In-lore the Spartans were both male and female. Most sources depict the makeup of the group being roughly half-and-half
<@173112001684439040> my college requires all student orgs have a constitution, primarily stating duties of officers, what happens if the club disbands, and stating our zero tolerance for discrimination and sexual misconduct.
Yep, but we *are* watching JoJos pt2, and this does highlight a communication deficiency on our part
Yes, but now we must amend our constitution because someone complained we were watching something we Said we could not watch in club
We do have restrictions primarily so we don't get a majority of people voting in something super uncomfortable for everyone. We would never show goblin slayers; however, we actually are not technically restricted in what the college will let us screen
17+
Yep
College age
`but this is the thanks we get for recognizing the last prez left 3 extra hotel rooms booked on her card, and canceling them before she got charged for them`
They're required
We were able to clear it up already, now we just have to revise our constitution to specifically state what is not allowed to be shown, and also communicate that we are skipping part 1 due to content.
So update on the shitstorm of me running an anime club: someone who is not a club member complained to the head of student orgs that we were watching JoJo part 1 which is too gorey and has too much nudity. We are specifically only watching part 2 of JoJo's *cough* previous prez is holding a grudge and trying to cause us hell *cough*
Maybe? but we stress in club that someone can just write their concerns on a survey and then we'll drop the show if it makes people uncomfortable
The problem is i dont have time to meet this week
Woohoo, as if I didn't have enough on my plate already this week, now the director of student orginization at my university wants to meet with me to discuss the concerns someone brought up about one of the anime series we're watching in club. 

We're watching: the devil is a part timer, Gamers, re:creators and JoJo's part 2. I'm not sure what there is that's particularly objectionable...
I think a big thing everyone should consider is that there isn't really a right or wrong in politics, and if one is going to just disregard someone's political opinion as "wrong" it doesn't make them any better. 

The best way to get someone to not even consider an opinion, is to start off putting them on the defensive.
And there's no national engineering "certification" required to work in engineering. There is the "professional engineer" cert, but not many require it since it expects you to memorize every equation and topic without notes, or use of reference text
Yep
There aren't many that apply to teaching at colleges
Yeah, but why should they bother?
Mechanical
Despite all that, getting below a 60 on literally every assignment makes me feel sick. It ruins any semblence of motivation I had when I can put 100% into something and get that grade because of his bullshit.
Yeah, it sucks. This class is worse than many others though. The prof hands out these failing grades knowing fully well that he can't actually fail that many students. At the end of each semester he has to argue with the director of the engineering program over how many students he's allowed to fail, and how much he has to curve the grades. This year too, I expect we'll get an even more lenient curve because there is finally another professor teaching the course, and because of that my uni has to audit the course grades at the end to make sure there isn't a massive discrepancy in grades.
At least the professor admitted the highest score was a 74, and that was even much higher than anyone else in the course
Seriously, fuck this class
Getting a 47% on your last exam
i'm super late to this convo, but...

Yuri Girl (Alice): "The important take away is not to settle. Don't elect democrats to congress and then say 'Our job is done!'"

Honestly this is one of the most important parts of our government system. it doesnt stop at voting in officials, there's an entire portion of writing your representatives (The ones in the senate primarily) with your opinion on important matters. Then there's also the portion about making sure who's in charge is held accountable. My biggest fear of what we'll have happen with trump being elected is that when we finally get him out of office no one will bother looking at what the new president does, no matter how much it might actually be detrimental to our rights. Voting in the president isnt the end of the democratic method, it's the start.
So the other day i got a offer letter of intent from the company i've been cooping with. The problem is they offered a salary i literally have no reference for
While i wasnt part of this conversation, i still would like to add that while i thought it was a strange practice (clearly we can all still tell what the word was) It did provoke more thought from me to consider the impact that the word might have on people who have  a different background than me.
i miss the days of uniforms because it meant i didnt have to pick out an outfit and worry if the colors match acceptably
I can only assume it was to make fun of me because in middle school I was pretty much that creepy kid who hung out with the rest of the rejects.
Sometimes I lay awake at night and wonder about random things from middle school, just like everyone who has ADD does. So tonight I wonder *why did those 5 girls in 8th grade start inviting me to eat lunch with them?*
They were glorified torches
And the dissapointment with myself after I've been careful in budgeting only to mess up this way :P
Though really the concern is more of the looming feeling of dread I have right now
Yeah, but I could have not typed that in wrong, then instead paid like $1000, now, and then paid the other $800 in like a month, then I'd only be out a few dollars of interest vs what ill be out in late fees.
The bright side is I get paid on Thursday, down side is my rent was due today, so I'll pay like $20 in late fees.
Bright side is I won't pay as much interest on that loan now...
Well, i Don fked up in the stupidest way. My bank account now has only $6 in it. <:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089> 

I went to pay off student loans, and put an extra zero and paid $2000 instead of the $200 I wanted to...
You're comparing an AAM to a SAM now. The aircraft was clearly struck by a SAM not an AAM. US response that deep would have been possible with F-22s or F-35s, which have a radar signature when they open payload bays.
A SAM battery making a mistake isn't an unreasonable case when you're facing the possibility that an unknown aircraft might be a US aircraft bringing a quick death to you in the next minute if you don't shoot *right this second*. Especially when you just fired missiles at the US and are expecting a response
The missile was not launched from within MANPAD range, it did not come from directly under the aircraft, it came from miles away. Watch the video and see for yourself and think for yourself
You said the aircraft was shot down by insurgents, and you insist on impossible situations, there's nothing to misrepresent. We've seen the images of the Tor-1M missile debris
And they're able to just freely drive around in a whole god-damned fucking SAM battery? You do know what a Tor-1M takes to run right?
But I guess theyre also in on the whole scheme huh?
We've got statements from the UK, and Canada backing this with their own intelligence
I don't know where you're getting 5000 feet, every article says it was at 8000. But clearly it's more likely the US filled out an elaborate plan installing prototype ER MANPADs at Iranian SAM sites to take out Iranian jets in a false-flag operation
If you're within the path of the aircraft
You're comparing an active warzone to a proper country now?
The jet was at 8000 feet. MANPADs tend to run out of range at 10,000, but that's a linear distance
I can't really blame someone for that mistake when the possibility that it's a US aircraft flying in to drop a precision munition on you is pretty darn high.
<@213645184125239317> you're ignoring the limitations of these systems, and the video showing the missile trajectory. Shoulder-fired MANPADs don't have a lot of range, frankly they would have been barely able to reach an aircraft at 8,000 feet.
Mistakes happen, it's entirely possibly to miss-id an aircraft with a SAM battery
Identifying it as a Tor-1M
But it wasn't a shoulder mounted one, it was a significantly larger one, debris of the missiles was found
Yes, insurgents in the capital of Iran with SAM tanks that they can drive about freely and kill their own people?
Yeah, so we know it was a SAM which excludes the US since they couldn't have anything close enough without Iran throwing a fit. There was some speculation that it was a TOR-1 from some debris pictures, but I have yet to see those.
There's a video circulating now where the aircraft appears to be struck by a SAM
And it'll be a like 10x worse deal probably
I thought that was a given
And Ukraine has a spotless aircraft safety record
They did retract it when they started investigating, but it's odd that anything was issued in the first place
It's even more odd that the Ukrainian embassy in Iran would issue a statement on this before even having a chance at investigating the incident.
Were US assets within range i'd be suspecting the US first of an accidental shoot down, but we simply don't have anything capable of that range
Also <@213645184125239317> please explain how US SAMs are able to travel over 1000 miles, or how a US warship can enter the Caspian sea unnoticed?
We're it a shoot down by not Iran I would expect a lot less insistence that it's mechanical failure. Sure I can understand not handing it over to Boeing US, but there's lots of things they could easily work out.
Qassem Biniaz, a spokesman for Iran‚Äôs Road and Transportation Ministry, said the pilot ‚Äúlost control of the plane‚Äù

https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/iran-plane-crash-missile-strike-ukraine-engine-cause-boeing-a9274721.html

A spokesman for Iran‚Äôs armed forces, Abolfazl Shekarchi, said the crash was not a result of any military action.

‚ÄúThey are spreading propaganda that the Ukrainian flight was targeted,‚Äù the Iranian news media quoted Mr. Shekarchi as saying. ‚ÄúThis is ridiculous. Most of the passengers on this flight were our valued young Iranian men and women. Whatever we do, we do it for the protection and defense of our country and our people.‚Äù

https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/07/world/middleeast/iran-plane-crash-boeing-ukraine.html
Iran's official stance is that it was an engine fire. Plus they refuse to hand over the black box.
But then again, IFF doesn't work quite as nicely as many believe. I only know a little about IFF from Falcon BMS, but on modern US fighters IFF will only identify something if it is giving a known signal (squak). Airliners are supposed to squak at all times for the ATC to tell them apart, but if an IFF system doesn't show that to the pilot, the pilot just sees it as a bogy. Or if the pilot scans for the IFF signal, but there's too much interference they might get a no-response listed (a bogy).
That would be extremely unfortunate. I'd have to wonder what would cause someone to think it was a military aircraft when flying so slow and on such regular paths
The US having shot down that aircraft is extremely unlikely. Unless the US has some land-based SAMs in that area (we don't publicly) the only way we could shoot it down with SAMs would be if we had a naval vessile within the range limit of our longest-range SAMs (~240miles) requiring that said naval vessile be in the Caspian sea. Otherwise the only option is a stealth fighter to fly in and take the aircraft out at a max range of about 40 nm. It's also strange that Iran is insistent on it being just mechanical failure. If this had been a shoot down by the US they'd be claiming that instead of denying any possibility of this being a shoot down...
Things were going pretty well between the US and Iran up to then too, but when you drop a grenade into a campfire it's not fun
I'm not gonna defend the paper, I only meant to share the pics in it
The issue with bulldozers is that they damage parts. Often much care is used when moving even the large pieces. Usually cranes and straps to not bend pieces. And the wreckage is normally cleared after cataloging each part and it's location
Yes, crash site is completely clear by now. Which is pretty early for an aviation accident
So clear the wreckage before the Ukrainian investigators get to see it?
I don't care for the source, but their pictures are good
https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/10711754/iran-plane-crash-bulldozers-debris-shot-down/
Absolutely
There were many fuckups in that. the ship was too far forward, lacking it's cover from other ships, exchanged fire with an iranian ship, it entered iranian waters, they thought an aircraft that climbed, then maintained a steady altitude was coming in for an attack run. a few seconds of common sense could have solved these issues. Had they not gone ahead they wouldnt have had pressure on them to make that fire-nofire decision
We did see that US's grandious fuckup with this where the aircraft they shotdown was squaking exactly as it was supposed to, but the operator had two cursors, one for targeting the fire control radar at an aircraft, and the other for reading the IFF. They put one on an F-14, while the other was stuck on a passenger jet.

F-16s can vary in modernization, they get upgraded often, and there are tons of versions in-service. i'm not sure what variants were flown in falcon BMS and DCS, but falcon BMS's ones were not particularly old
Both of these showing examples of miss-IDing aircraft with much more modern systems. Its also possible that it was squaking, but interference happened causing that to drop. But no amount of squaking on civilian frequencies would work if the IFF panel on the SAM were set on a mode like shown in the first video where it was only looking for military IDs
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nqkiKPvMdA&t=1409s
Again, i'm not an expert on IFF -- i've only toyed with it in simulators -- but its possible for an aircraft with a working IFF transmitter to not respond to an IFF call, or to have the IFF screen set wrong (making it look for a specific IFF call instead of more general ones) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0URHWkyOV3U
Really, we should only be involved on a coalition-style basis. We participate when asked by locals, and in cooperation with other NATO countries. A case like when we were basically supplying air support for iran and iraq against ISIL was pretty reasonable.
But that was back in like 2010 when the country was pretty much not something we needed to dick around with anymore
i felt that we had a little responsibility to stabilize iraq after we did *invade the country and topple the goverment* but clearly that didnt work, and we stopped making things better.
Yeah, and the IR signature of a passenger jet would be drastically different from a fighter. most of the heat being at the engines below the wings instead of centered on the craft
Anyway, at the end of the day this is like a school bully punching a kid he thinks is annoying, then the kid punches back, runs away to ambush him, but hits someone else in the process. I'd say the US is equally at fault for provoking Iran, and it's a great reason to *not get involved in the middle east*
From the distance it looks like the missile was fired from, and how dark it was i'm not sure an optical tracker would help in IDign it
or wait, this is optical tracking in terms of the search radar i think?
I dont think so. Normally they differentiate between IR-tracking and optical
For the particulars of the missile, there's a few things going on that make a 100% ID difficult. As we see with iraq or iranian built russian equipment (i dont know if iran's Tor's are built by them, or russian surplus) but there tends to be some minor changes depending on the capabilities of manufacturing. If you look closely enough at a T-72 lyon of babel and compare it to a russian-built T-72, it could look like another tank when considering how similar most russian tanks are
Until i went and checked that US assets werent within range, I assumed this was a US fuckup.
Now dont get me wrong, i'm not going to cover for the US without evidence nor will i believe evidence that is solely from the US, but Canada and the UK wouldnt cover for this, and they said they had some kind of data suggesting this was an Iranian SAM, and IDed it as a Tor. The seeker head is a good confirmation of that too
I agree it looks not completely like a Tor, but i'm not terribly familiar with the appearance of the missiles themselves. But it is not a MANPAD, and to launch two of those missiles rapidly one would need a sizeable launch platform, like a tracked launcher. It's hard to believe that insurgents could run around within the Iranian borders with a tank without getting found.
Absolutely not a MANPAD
But here's the seeker head from the Tor
I cant help you there if you cant see it
I would agree if this were within reasonable range for a MANPAD, but look at that video again and you can see that the missile comes from miles away, while a MANPAD would have had to come from much closer
But you still insist that the US funded insurgents capable of fielding an entire SAM battery miles away from Iran's capital is more reasonable than a mistake?
yeah, and he's not thinking about how well the US is going to get deep in their borders when deciding if he wants to shoot something in the next second.
you're picking apart an argument saying it doesnt work, when it does
read your own words
"Your own argument earlier is that the US is nowhere nearby so cannot be involved. Now it's likely that a US response got in totally unnoticed for hundreds of miles and is flying away from Tehran?"
You have just done so. I said the US could not have any SAMs in range. Then i mentioned aircraft striking a SAM battery. To strike that aircraft the US would have had to use aircraft and AAMs
I dont get why people would bother with 3d printing the AK, it's so easy to just bend the sheet metal for the receiver and cut it with a hacksaw
But without a proper barrel, any attempt to make a 3D printed firearm with pretty much any 3d printers out there right now would result in a ruptured casing and be more dangerous to the user than the target.
There's also a frame for some Glock model circulating around, and then some parts kits could be used to assemble one that functions.
Legally speaking (in the US), it is very possible to 3D print a firearm. This is because in the US the Receiver of the firearm is the part legally considered the firearm. For an AR-15 rifle this is specifically the lower receiver. It's arguably the part that needs the least durability as its uninvolved in the actual forces of firing a round; however, it is often one of the most complex in terms of features as it holds most of the parts like trigger assembly and magazines. You'd still need a proper barrel, chamber, and bolt if you dont want it to explode though.
Pulled that from a BBC article yesterday. The aircraft did appear to fly towards the SAM battery and the terrain nearby means there was around a 190m tall hill. It's possible this obscured the aircraft from the SAM battery for a time, and perhaps the operator saw the aircraft as performing a "pop-up" attack, which is standard against anti-air emplacements.

Well, it took literally proving it to them before they caved, but Iran finally admitted their mistake:
https://www.cnn.com/2020/01/11/middleeast/iran-shot-down-ukrainian-plane/index.html
Sounds like the investigators are on-site now
Afghanistan is kinda like Poland. No one has had a good time attempting to invade them. The insuring insurgencies are always costly to the stationed forces
Hey, clearly fighting in the middle East worked out for the USSR right? So why not try it out ourselves!

In Grand Rapids a few of the peaceful protestors from Saturday's protest made the decision to protest in spite of the curfew placed specifically to try to draw attention away from the rioting that had happened back to their cause. I feel this is a very respectable thing to do, but unfortunately it does not seem to have gotten much attention. https://www.facebook.com/watch/live/?v=256793018987543&ref=watch_permalink
LMAO
It was very peaceful during this portion. The police held to cordoning off traffic and securing the police HQ during this.
https://i.redd.it/iqfz37voyy151.jpg
The protest propper: https://i.imgur.com/mASGf5q.jpg
Good example of the peaceful protest. In the far back you can see the police just in cars blocking off vehicle traffic https://i.redd.it/c03tghn67z151.jpg
While many other cities have had issues of the police using excessive force on protestors, it was not here.
I'm literally a mile from what happened here. I followed the news and much of the protesters perspectives. I heard a lot of accounts from people *actually in* the protest of what happened. They all say that the police response was specifically after the vandalism started.
I just told you this was after the violence started. Police cruisers were in fire before teargas was brought out
If they had wanted to start trouble they would have done so at the start of the protest when it was peaceful and more people were there. But the majority of the protest remained peaceful. It started around 5pm, and didn't turn to be violent until about 8:30-9pm
Where's the hard evidence for Grand Rapids?
None
Many of the peaceful protestors also returned this morning to assist in the cleanup.
Grand Rapids had a very good response to the peaceful protest. The protest was left alone despite their March having not filed a route plan for their march. The police cordened off streets to vehicle traffic as the protest moved to protect the protestors. As the sun set the radical elements turned to rioting. Peaceful protestors actively tried to stop some of the vandalism, but many of the peaceful protestors made the decision to disperse for their safety. After the vandalism started the police responded with teargas and flashbangs to contain the destruction. The damage from the rioting ended up being mostly to local small businesses, many of which have been closed since COVID-19 started and will never open their doors again.
How Grand Rapids looks after last night

Grand Rapids is taking this very seriously
https://i.redd.it/ze6xldupnb251.jpg
I hope so. Police officers are primarily citizens with a badge and slightly better knowledge of the law. As such they should be held accountable for their actions.
I am hoping the judge will pass verdict based solely on the evidence all provided. While the judge being swayed by public response would mean the case goes in the direction of what I believe happened, I do not believe it is right for a judge to have their decision influenced by public pressure.
I'm hoping this is a case that makes a drastic change to how police behavior is handled
Bold of you to assume we make it to November
Stop making reasonable points, it's depressing
I'm no lawyer, but I'm not sure how heart conditions can make someone less guilty of throat kneeling
Fishy, Here in Grand Rapids we did have a peaceful protest that lasted until curfew and it was then (with needless force) dispersed. I am under the impression that the police do not want to stop protests, but they are bound to enforce the rules enacted by the mayor. I think they took some correct steps, with the national guard only standing by while the arrests were made; however, in my opinion their use of force today was too much.
Ardania, one of the fundamentals of using a firearm for self-defense is that there is no such thing a shooting to wound. When someone makes the decision to shoot the first bullet they have made the decision to kill the person they are aiming at. A leg wound can be simultaneously not enough to stop a charging assailant from killing you, while also being a mortal wound.
> Wtf
let's not forget that NYC has a great track record for everything police related /s they use stop-and-frisk, and also try to use a heavier trigger pull on their firearms to deter police from using their firearms. The result is that NYPD had an absurd rate of bystander's hit when police open fire
so not only are the police in the US using excessive force to stop police brutality protests, but they're also doing it on the 31st anniversary of tiananmen square. I just want to quit 2020

Search that and you will not actually find that in the page
Thanks for generalizing the views according to what your party says ours are
Economic left vs right ends up somewhat independtant of the libertarian views. Imo, we need to take careful consideration of the assumptions of capitalism and where it fails. Where it fails regulations are needed to solve the problems.
IE, if universal basic income is economically a good thing, where the bonuses outweigh the negatives, we should do it
It's more "back to basics" to the US revolution. We want as many rights as possible, and we want those rights to extend those rights to everyone else. Capitalism may be a lot of the stance of the candidates, but I do disagree with that to an extent
Kind of, yes, but less extrimest than anarchists
You should do a bit more research because libertarian views end up pissing off Dems and Republicans equally. Its more against big government than anything
If they wanted to take that ballot and toss it in the garbage, they can do so, but it would make me sad
If I could hand someone a ballot, knowing they'd fill it out against my interests, I would do so, because that's the funimental of the US

The stance is increase competition because as it stands solar is more economically viable than coal or oil power generation

Giant meteor looks better than trump or biden
I think that it's hard to solve without a system that outright removes one's assets from the equation; however, we have seen that systematic discrimination plays a huge factor in that since it will prevent minorities from accumulating wealth to pass on to their next generation. So it's a serious issue that needs to be addressed, but the specifics of that are well above my knowledge
And as we've seen, the 9th amendment has not been interpreted properly and the government has allowed the oppression of peoples such as minorities, which is unacceptable
That's a fair point, but that's also why i encourage everyone to vote regardless of their position. Because personally i believe in everyone voting
"The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people."
but our government sucks horribly and fails at this
Yes, but we should also not need to have laws to trust the government to protect our rights, because the government is only supposed to take away what rights they are *SPECIFICALLY ALLOWED TO*
If someone is transgender, they should have the same protections from discrimination as everyone else. So naturally if a business is discriminating against people who are transgender, it is fundamentally something that is against my beliefs
My position is that more rights for everyone are good
They shouldnt need to be law, because everyone should have the rights, Anything not granted specificaly for the government to take away should be reserved for the people

If someone brings up a question of "what about Transgender rights" the response is "They already had those, and dont need to ask the government"
The short of Libertarian views is: More rights for everyone, and smaller government.
Personally, if i have the option of voting for the "lessor of two evils" or "wasting my vote" by voting for Jo Jorgenson, i'll take voting for who i believe in since i'm sick of voting lessor of two evils, but please, vote for whoever you believe in personally.

But if the libs, Dems, and repubs all support things wildly beneficial to big corps, what's the difference?
Effectively as I said before, where the assumptions of capitalism fail, the government must step in to fix it
The libs are not perfect, but I would trust them more than the Dems or repubs at this point, but I think the corporation/economic portion needs to be handled by *economists*
Dems and repubs love corporations, it's how they get in office

The use of the military to police is legally possible if all other options are exhausted; however, that's never a good option when it can be avoided
Normally, a state can deploy the national guard to act as police; however, DC is not a state, so any orders to the national guard are likely to be federal orders (which is highly illegal) unless a loophole can be found

https://www.nbcnews.com/
Sounds like the DC police were evacuating other nearby buildings before regrouping at the capital
*tear gas them!*
mostly it seems that Iran realized they cant play the victim since their actions resulted in them shooting down a civilian aircraft and losing much of the world's sympathy by trying to hide it.
yes it's plausible deniability, but it doesnt make tensions any lower
it hardly makes a difference in terms of tensions
yeah, but hardly makes a difference
they fired missiles into the US-Iraq embassy just the other week
the Iran stuff hasnt gone away, they're continuing their nuclear program
we all *hope*
brutal
i wouldnt be surprised if they use this as an excuse to break ties with the more extremist republicans in the government
that would make sense, i dont think there are any legal issues unless the DC mayor complained
First police chopper just went up -- delayed due to the no-fly rules over DC from yesterday

reports of flashbangs going off inside
There's also concerns that more of these people would be armed than any previous protests. so i'd expect the police would want to have as much manpower as possible to handle this
probably so his party doesnt try to remove him

probably a back entrance or something, it'd be better to push everyone out rather than try to push to the front entrance from outside
They're in some staging area somewhere, but not on camera
none of the media is showing where all the massive trains of police vehicles are going
DC does not have this
depends on the state. some states have castle doctrine which lets you shoot someone who breaks into your house. Few states have it for someone who is just on your property, and hardly and have it for commercial buildings
lmao
i've seen like 3 of those i the past 10 mins
shops
you know what this sounds like? Sedition
we'll really see whats the case when they go to enforce the curfew
you try to evacuate a DC block quickly. They're streaming in officers right now
so far, the police simply havnt had the manpower to do much about this.

the police have been evacuating other buildings nearby before regrouping. they're regrouping right now
idk, breaking into the capital sounds a lot more like treason than a riot
not in volumes though
you say that, but the teargas is out now
The police are pushing in and dispersing the rioters right now
they arrested everyone that was inside and didnt run
yeah, police basically had to clear all these buildings since they're linked
Full force is now moving in

Police have been clearing the capital complex until about 20ish minutes ago when they started pushing out of the capital building. so capital building is secure now
sounds like during the evacuation someone on the senate floor grabbed the electoral ballots so they're safe
Fun fact: if you're between the ages of about 16 and 60, odds are you are legally part of your state's militia

Police were clearing out the capital building up until now, and now that it's secured they're pushing the rioters out

Hey, don't we dronestrike seditionists who encourage violence against the US?
Wish he would have just said "you reap what you sow"

As i said, the police arrested everyone inside already while securing it if they didnt run away
whole train of prison buses coming in
also apparently they pulled some of the exterior security to secure them, but still why was only the capital police on-station today?
honestly not the worst option, the rioters could have been anywhere until the entire campus was swept. One news station said whether they evacuated or entered the bunker depended on where they were in the building
I imagine full on flailing arms on the ground levels of tantrum throwing
Thank God that aid grabbed the box of electoral votes. They deserve the Congressional Gold Medal. Literally risked life to defend those ballots
Yeah, can't have anyone actually talking it out in our political system. Much easier to control angry people

If iran has their way, they'd get nukes instead
it's almost like the president shouldnt have this much power
Okay, firstly, yes there was no additional support to the capital police today for this completely predictable event; however, the capital police *did* do their best, many doing better than most police officers ever bother to do. the problem is, *there was only around 100 of them*. 

Whoever decided to not have extra support for this needs to have their head roll.
WWI is so complicated i cant get into it because if i do i'll just spend months looking into it

I would bet the situation is more of someone spooked one of the security personnel -- who were outnumbered like 100:1, and someone accidentally fired a shot when they didn't mean to.
Firing a firearm is only to be done when you believe you're in danger of life or limb, and a "warning shot" implies you do not believe you're in danger since you are opting to not shoot the target.
Warning shots are generally a bad idea.

i'm so thankful my state's secretary of state sent out like 2-3 absentee ballot applications to everyone eligible to vote. That combined with ballot drop boxes made it so easy to vote this year.

I'd love to see detailed analysis of the US stimulus payments on the economy. As well as one on UBI. those both seem to have been great demonstrators of trickle-up economics.
maybe widely accepted among the rich people in DC, but economists they are not.
you can google it and find dozens of papers refuting it. i dont call that "widely accepted"
when i learned econ, they mentioned it was a criticized view, and instead trickle-up was looked upon more favorably
Point is, trickle down was thought of and accepted at first, yet now is rejected. That alone is not discredit all of economics. to assert such is the fallacy fallacy.
> For this reason, we are used to consider that the lower the sodium intake is, the better the patient prognosis is. However, the studies that are beginning to shake the foundations of this historic fortress are growing in number. Actually, in the analysis of this topic, several cohort studies [16,17,18] and meta-analyses [19,20] have shown that the relationship between sodium intake and poor patient prognosis have not a linear trend,
If you actually read modern economics works, they dont claim trickle down works.
And doctors claim sodium causes high blood pressure, but that being incorrect doesnt make medical science all bullshit
i've hardly seen trickle down taken that seriously since it's never worked
trickel down is highly contested, but the general theories of economics work.

i'm not sure how well it'll work, Ohio did it and is only vaccinated at like 48%, and Michigan was at 51% without this already.
I just wish we didnt have to deal with this crap to get everyone vaccinated
The grey area with HIPPA IIRC is that if they already have access to HIPPA info, there's questions about if they can ask you to voluntarily show your vaccine card.
I think the only part you dont get is the daily drawing?
if you're already vaccinated you can register by providing info from your vaccine card
It's sad that my state has to offer a Lottery to get people to get the vaccine.
is this possibly the start of US right to repair?
the "logic" is more of what the church says, and the church wants more children so they can have more people under their influence so they dont really want birth control
What i really hate about "pro-life" people is that they never suggest making condoms or birth control more available to people.
i've been watching all sorts of people go 180 on topics for no reason other than the president changed out.
oh it's simultaneously comedic and infuriating
yeah, because if you dont the government throws you in jail for 30 years
I dont think either are accountable at the moment for the record.
When was the last time the government got in significant trouble for locking kids in cages? or bombing civilians, or bombing US citizens, or spying on US citizens, or spying on allies citizens?
the govenment is accountable for anything at all?
why give the government the power when they've never handled it well?
I also believe in strongly mocking anyone who refuses to get said vaccine
not to support the anti-vaxxers, but i dont support forced vaccines even though i believe everyone should get the vaccine. the government mandating it just leaves too much room for shenanigans to happen. I do support every private company requiring you to get vaccinated before getting on their flights, entering their premise, working at their facility, etc...
God, i just also dont comprehend how i handle stress. Sometimes my projects at work are in flames and it's nothing to me. I look at the problem, i think of some possible solutions and i just work on it. Othertimes i hit a small problem and just cant.
Thank you very much. I would love to be able to meditate and clear my mind without needing some external distraction so I'll give this a shot

Ukraine has been trying to sell them for a while
I think they were mostly T-80s? i'm not sure because i'm bad at IDing 72s vs 80s vs 90s
Ukraine was a big defense industry center for the USSR before they fell. most of those pictures of warehouses full of tanks and parking lots full of tanks were from Ukraine. unfortunately those dont do them much good since they're left in disrepair
there's rumors the Antonov-225 was destroyed
all of them
also keep in mind there have been a fair number of times where the launch order was given and the people in charge of launching said no
i fucking hate all the russian apologists "ohh this is Ukraine's fault for not negotiating!" "nooo, Ukraine attacked first!" what the hell are people smoking?
it wasnt a pretty situation from the start 8 years ago
we likely wont know anything concrete about the situation until its over, both sides will look to cover up casualties right now to avoid exposing a weakness
The US is stationing troops in Latvia right now, who knows for what specific ends if just posturing or intended deployments
i'm waiting for news of china invading Taiwan
i saw some other country wave visa requirements for Ukrainian citizens -- i think it was Ireland?

we live in a strange time where civilians can track the flight path of RQ-4 global hawks
there's also a possibility that a "recon platoon" that is motorized was only 1-2 vehicles
a platoon is typically 2-4 squads, so assuming US numbers thats about 24 to 48, since they're motorized, it may be fewer since it's what fits in the BTRs
so like 20ish guys probably?
oh sorry "whole platoon of the 74th" not the brigade
r/noncredibledefense thus the "rumor"
a rumor has it the entire 74th motorized brigade surrendered to Ukraine forces saying they didnt want to kill anyone
RIP A 225
there's also the tradeoff of being low generally means you have to fly slower so you dont hit things, which means you have less of an option to evade (and evasion is practically required to actually dodge missiles, this isnt video games where they magically lose lock from just CMs)
you have to be flying below the trees basically for that, or behind hills.
going low doesnt help much for MANPADs because with those unless you're flying something stupidly modern you get zero warning of the lockon (IR missiles dont emit anything to detect short of optical methods)
while modern jets usually dont have to fear MANPADs (they can fly high enough to not get hit) helicopters pretty much operate within MANPAD range at all times.
yes, they got those in just before this all started i think
i have basically know knowledge of how cyber warfare works. i only know about ECM and ECCM for EWAR
it's like it has always been, just less fog of war since you can often track significant portions of troops in real time through aircraft or other observation means
sounds like poland suspended the need for visas for Ukrainians <https://www.gov.pl/web/udsc/ukraina-en>

the radiation isnt that bad right now. there are some hot zones, but there are areas where it's not that much higher than background radiation
the reactor doesnt really, but people have speculated it'd be a useful location for a FOB since it's sparsely populated yet still a built-up area
you can verify the video by google earth, those roads and reactor #5 in the background

No wait, it's 0.06
Sanity check, 65500 nSV is 65.5 mSV, right?
And rejected Russia at one point IIRC
If you're in the US you can't because of ITAR restrictions
I've seen a few videos of Russian troops running out of fuel
was also used to solve logistics emergencies in the US auto industry a number of times. there's a fair bit of tooling that is too big/heavy to move through conventional air cargo so it either gets shipped in a ship, or gets on the 225
US radios also switch frequencies multiple times a second to reduce the chances of being direction-found
encrypted radios are fairly expensive, and you'll often lose a fair number of properly secure ones because they brick themselves if you put the wrong codes in too many times (at least US ones do)
Christ, amateur radio has better encryption than them
yes
part of the problem is he told the troops they'd be met with flowers, and instead they were met with bullets
it sounds like all tactical-level radios for the russian forces are unencrypted, and they only occasionally switch channels. that explains a lot about how poorly they've been doing since most coms can be intercepted or direction-found...
yeah, what they put in the credits might have been stipulated in the contract
Bulgaria also has some financial motivation from this. They're getting some F-16s in like 2025 to replace their MiG-29s, through this they get NATO air coverage until that deal goes through so they dont have to spend money on an airforce for a while
Bulgaria just decided to send ALL of their MiG-29s to Ukraine
one thing i'm wondering about with that convoy is that if there's little or no ASF cover, it cant have much AA defense then? Most of the more mobile units that could provide cover while moving are too short-ranged to hit high-flying jets that well, and the longer-ranged ones need separate missiles, radars, and control vehicles.
i would think we'd see some scorching on the hangar then
i cant tell either, but before when it was reported as "destroyed" news outlets were saying it had been lit on fire, and it doesnt look like there's any sign of fire near it

some saying it was an ammo depo, other saying thermobaric weapon
last i heard they're claiming UA was going to attack Belarus and this is a "pre-emptive strike"
Russia televised it
i think they just leaked plans to invade Moldova...
https://i.redd.it/ttp3n8m9xsk81.png
The really tough spot here is that UA uses vastly different equipment from NATO. it'd be one thing if they say used F-15s and everyone could only give them F-16s, that'd require some retraining, but it's not a huge change since the weapons and systems are all similar.
i imagine the TB2 is probably pretty different from the MQ-9 so it wouldnt be practical to send those and the related logistics systems and have to retrain crews on them
I just saw UA was asking Turkey for more drones
i thought the whole ghost thing was started by a warthunder youtuber?
i suspect more were lost/damaged but not claimed
before this started, they had 37 MiG-29s, 32 Su-27s, 12 Su-24s (attacker) and 17 Su-25s (attacker) according to wikipedia. we know that 6 MiG-29s were damaged on the ground, and i think a further 2 were shot down?
Theres also this: https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/what-happened-russias-air-force-us-officials-experts-stumped-2022-03-01/

Hey, if you like it that's more power to you. Everyone enjoys anime in their own way, and often enjoys each genre differently.
she did progress in skill a bit, but it was rapidly at the start, but even then, she needed her allies to do something to actually accomplish her goals
LLenn wasnt god from the start, and yes the guy was M
i thought their exploration of the game mechanics was also pretty cool. like in the OG GGO arc they did the whole "ohhh sinon times the shot between heartbeats and that's what makes her so good" to which i responded "well that's like basic sharpshooting 101, so dafaq?" but then GGO Alt when into the bullet line not showing up if you pull the trigger without resting your finger on it first, and not needing the bullet line if you just know how to aim your shot with the sights
> AltGGO is probably the best SAO currently released, and it's a spinoff
It basically took that topic of "Getting over a trauma through VRMMOs" brought up in the GGO arc, and explored it a lot more in-depth.
honestly i think a lot of the SAO hate is from people just disappointed in how much SAO dropped the ball with topics that it brings up. It legitimately brings up a lot of really good questions, but then as soon as it brings them up, it drops them and moves on rather than exploring them. It might actually do really well if Reki went back and wrote a series of short-stories IRobot style exploring each of those questions a bit more.
they couldnt be more different, but they're both psychological thrillers with plots that unfold similarly.
that's an on-point suggestion IMO
What really bugs me at this point with anime is when people give show recommendations based off of shallow-ish reasons like "oh it's an isekai" and what not.
`but then i go to make my point and the top recommendation for people who liked re: zero is this:`
It gets more complicated when you consider the narrative merits of a show, there's a little bit of a way to "objectively" rate those bits. But even then, while i might complain about the narrative issues with something like SAO, i wont complain about someone liking it.
An anime is good if the person watching it enjoyed it, but if the friend they suggest that anime to finds it good will depend on how much they grasp the reasons for why the anime was good to them
Yes
i never watched it
yeah, he's done a lot i like, and has a series airing this season
seen it, but would be a good option
but i want to watch something that feels like them, and have no idea what that is
i've got a feeling that i want to rewatch Waiting in the Summer, Ano Hana, Pet Girl of Sakurasou, and A Lull Under the Sea, but i dont want to rewatch any of them...
Which is why it gets funnier as it goes on and all the actor's chemistry grows
No drinking supposedly. They just had all the actors in at once with a single writer and a rough translated script
And the guys who originally made the series said the eng dub is way better than the original <:TsubasaSmug:585839805737467920>
Supposedly no alcohol was involved, they were just told they could do anything except:

* Changing the way the ghosts are vanquished
* Changing the names of the characters

I've seen ghost stories like 12 times
I veto ghost stories
Anyone know a good comedy anime with a good dub?
||i'm waffling back-and-forth on if she is, and if she isnt a god. The show seems to be selling her as a quantum computer or something that can predict the future though.||

As another thought, the way the opening ends reminds me a lot of Ano Hana's opening. They both end with the cast of characters standing together, then all the cast except Menma and Hina disappear. So my suspicion is that Hina saying "the world will end in 30 days" means her world
One thing i'm wondering is if for ep 5 ||Hina was actually channeling Izanami's mother, because it's not like they really did anything to change Hina's voice with what they had mentioned earlier||
because the base ball one is the only thing that hasnt worked out so far
IIRC for the Ep5 one ||he said it would be like cheating if he actually confessed to her then||
Ep1:||1st confession (baseball) - too early and too soon, or "too high" of a bar for Youta||

Ep2:||2nd confession (piano) - wasn't prepared for the sudden positive reaction, or the curveball, so he flubbed it||

Ep5:||3rd confession (mom) - shouldn't have confessed because it was an emotionally heightened state, it'd be a foul if he tried||
Oh, this is a good theory!
have you gotten to the Uno part?
the most hilarious episode.
it's something that generally i just see when someone wants to not like a show, and wants a valid reason not to watch it. Sure, i dont like shonen shows, but i can see one and say "i really dont like shonen storytelling, but this is still a well-written story" i dont have to justify why i dont like it unless i want to find out more about what i actually like
and violet evergarden does a ton of arcs that are similar.
you didnt even know the character until that episode
yeah, exactly. we literally watched the ep of angel beats with the cap-wearing student council guy yesterday, and he thought that was a good episode. yeah that wasnt set up at all, but it was still a good episode
yeah it just really grinds my gears because it takes hardly anything to notice this. And the people who make these complaints about it are always the same people who watch shows that *literally* pull shit out of the writers ass to make things happen in the plot
I just need to vent, but watched episodes 4,5,6 of *The Day I Became God* with friends today. I've repeatedly told them that the show is written by the guy who did *Clannad, Little Busters, Angel Beats,* and *Charlotte*. All shows they like because they have emotional impact. Ep 5 rolls around and after it's over they're like "that's stupid, they just dropped all this on us without anything before." But they set up a lot of it in episode 2. Sure if you dont like the show you can just say it, but dont fault the show for you not paying attention.
which is part of the beauty of it
> Genre/s?
<@!237964037898502144> back to this that i missed, i'm open to trying anything someone will recommend with a straight face. This is what i've seen so far: https://myanimelist.net/animelist/LoneGhostOne?status=2
yeah, it's subtle... i'd bet most of their storyboard is the same
then you have the continuation series *Disappearance of Nagato Yuki chan*
> is it recap or continuation?
continuation
i cant imagine having to watch all 8 eps of endless 8 one a week, it would suck so bad
but also, i showed it to my friend (but we binged it in like one sitting) and then when i showed him the movie he went from "this is stupid" to "oh my god!"
i still have conflicted feelings about endless eight. on one hand, it made the movie hit just that much harder, on the other, they could have achieved like 80% of the impact with like 3 eps
definitely bottle in low cost for writing. I think it is, most of the scenes are new perspectives
i dont think so, because endless eight actually animated most of the scenes new
yeah, i dont think you can have a "bottle episode" proper in anime (unless maybe reusing assets) but what the poster meant was clear enough.
i've been looking around a bit for new shows to pickup, not really feeling video games that much, and i've spent hours scrolling through lists of anime and going  "meh" at the synopsis of most shows
is it yuri, or yuri bait?
the temptation to click on spoilers
i have no idea what tabitabi is about, would your recommend, yes or no?
hey *I* never said i was smart
oh, different show
i missed that part
i dont get that last bit
I think that ep 5 does have some issues with pacing, but I think that could have been fixed by moving ep3 to after ep 5 or 6.
> people really claiming that ep came out of nowhere?
Yeah, there's some of my friend group, and a bunch on reddit. Really, I think a lot of people it just didn't strike with for some reason, and rather than saying "I didn't like it" they're doing the typical thing humans do which is make up reasons why the thing they didn't like is bad. But when I look at it and compare it to other series, plenty do that same single-episode even without setup, but there's hardly any complaint about it. When I point out that Izanami was setup previously, they then say ||"well if the dad had been introduced earlier" which I don't think matters, he's not a character, he's a portion of Izumis conflict.||

I also really like how Izanami is setup as a character, she isn't emotionless, she's just a little stoic until engaged. In ep1 it's mentioned that she goes to baseball games and cheers for her team. Ep2: ||we see that Yota only sees the stoic side of her (same one we see) because he's frankly shit at engaging her properly. Once he does try to engage her with her interests, she lights up.|| Then in ep 4: ||we see a bit of this same side of her, she claims she knows a little about Mahjong, but then as Yota is playing it she gets incredibly excited as he makes his plays. she's way more into it than expected.||
Another thing to keep in mind is that all of Yuta's family has names that are "The God of X" so it could be Hina becoming part of their family.
i wouldnt want to ruin a good show for someone!
i should watch that show
Okay, I need to gush. I was just live shitposting the *Saekano: How to Raise a Boring Girlfriend* movie, I thought it would be mostly comedy with either no resolution to who ends up with the main character, or very minimal resolution at the very end. This series that started out like a typical high school harem anime that would never end, delivered a beautiful ending built upon events from throughout the entire series. 

After I finished the movie, I looked up the author of the light novels to see what else he had written, apparently Fumiaki Maruto also wrote *White Album 2* so this conclusive ending to Saekano shouldn't have been unexpected.
absolutely
https://youtu.be/XMwzQJrTV2k
i had started watching it, then got side tracked watching "Wasteful days of high school girls" since that has a dub which is pretty funny

i just noticed that the color on the gaming console changes in the opening
either. I know the dub is on hidive, but you cant put subs on when watching the dub
In turn, anyone know a source for original Higurashi with the dub and subtitles?
subs:https://nyaa.si/view/1302036
raw:https://nyaa.si/view/1295830
they need to bring out the GuP director to direct Haifuri
Ping me tomorrow and I'll find what subs I got for it, they're pretty good
I don't remember anything that happened in the movie after about 40 minutes in
I need to re-watch it. My friend and I increased our drinking pace when we were 20 minutes in without a ship to be seen...
Did someone say Yuri novels? `sold`
The end of the christmas episode <:TsubasaYareYare:407397617451139073>
`i just want them to be happy together`
I'm getting a different vibe from Shimamura's reactions.
"oh, she doesn't want to go out on Christmas's because it's me, but because she's never had a friend to go out with"
Yes, but it seems like she's rationalizing it away
Can Adachi and Shimamura just finally admit they're in lesbians with each-other?

They're outdoor, but have slots your shooting through to prevent dumb people from yeeting rounds over the birm into people's houses
For guns. There's not enough space to swing a sling
Wish I had somewhere to use it for practice though
Mmmm, I should get a sling...
Well, I'm out of cute yuri noises to play for my housemates while they play magic, so I guess now to pretty robots fighting and awesome music (why did this series have to have such a bad plot?)
It sounds less up beat to me, and more nostalgic in tone
Oh, ofc the loli alien is ||680 years old||
Mostly talking about staying together and how being together has made their lives more colorful
Okay, looked them up, I think they're fitting
I don't have subs for the lyrics so I have no clue
The duet between the characters is just too cute
I've totally got the Adashima op stuck in my head now
I need to read the last volume of Konosuba too...
It's only 7 books, so it was refreshing as a series started with an end in sight
Empty Box and the Zeroith Maria are pretty good too
It's pretty good
*and I'm hoping we'll get Sawano doing the OST*
I'm hyped for the 86 anime. I love I-IV's designs <:TsubasaJoy:688191716620238870>
I'm the kind of weirdo who just likes to have a book in my hands. Plus I always read before bed, so looking at a screen isn't good
<:VanessaCracked:639136452600397829>
Ohh, there's an official EN translation up tovol 4
Haifuri gets a lot correct `like super critical boilers really sucking`
Day i became god E9 spoilers:
This is all assuming: ||The pitches are MC's chances to confess to Izanami. There's also the possibility that they're chances for him to confess to anyone, and the chance its each time he tries to confess||
So then for ep11 (currently watching): ||This would be pitch 4||
So then:
Day i Became God Ep11 spoilers: this theory came up before.
It's so good. Just like Hensuki's dub
Majo is my favorite character
The second-best comedy in english dub I've seen
The void grows
About to finish wasteful days of high school girls, I need something to fill the void
I'll advocate for at least finishing the first episode. I've had a few shows I dropped after 5ish minutes, but then later went back and loved the entire show
The idea is that the public knows, but they don't care because the pilots aren't considered humans by the populace
Anyone else hyped for 86? https://youtu.be/WUf-fEe7Ewo
I did
Mmm, shotguns. I just got one. Tis fun.
I may just stick with my pile of VNs then ...
We fought some *really* tough guys to get these weapons at level 4...
well, what it comes down to, is we have 5 people, two got +2 weapons, and the rest of us all could really use the +2 S sword, so split the cost of it 3 ways
i'm not giving it up without at least 1/3 of it's value in my bank
nope, my character has a shop to run
Not for this guy we arent
yes
My suggestion was to let him have it, in exchange for a promise to pay part of it's value to me eventually
So in the DnD campaign i'm in, one player is upset because we got a +2 short sword as loot (we're level 4) and i refuse to agree to a competition between us to see who gets this 8000 gold item
Shit, I have homework due Monday...
"I need to get through this pile of VNs, and I don't have a lot of time to game!"

*Spends all of yesterday playing Elite Dangerous getting my piloting fix*
Yeah, much easier than trying to subtract 12
Castform, just drop the tens place, then subtract 2
My class is normally at 10, but because I have to get accommodations I have to take it at 8
0800 hours
That too... Shit it's at 8 am too... -_-
Trying to pretend I don't get two exams back tomorrow
8:30 am here
*secretly looking for a reason to get out of bed*
