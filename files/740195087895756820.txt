Hi
wow a lot of new member join in.
how many fish do we have atm.
you can take a look at <#357682999300718592> since it for fan-content for geah
so general chat is <#336297387863703552>
I hope you atleast have a good experiment in this server
Welcome!
It actually ten of them, I just remember now.
wait wait..
Because nine of the character backstory are just them doing normal thing and then boom they die in many way.
So for my original concept, the dead children ghost don’t have an practically stories.
What is this figure from?
Ooo.
i thought u meant lbx.
ah
not really sentient since they have to be maunally control with a phone-like control device.
I know ghost don’t look like abstract art like character but it my own way.
The idea of my character is that they basically a spirit of children.




Here one of my original work that i made in last month and my writing at the time was oh boy...
https://archiveofourown.org/works/26280763
the noise is the small insect noise.
that a container
Actually

I think I have a Noise-addiction.
Stealth Bomber-type Noise.
I would like to rewrite this idea but..eh
So i practically forget what the hell the idea all about.
And their both nationally are Ame-Nese are just Amercian and Japanese mixed together but then again this is me in 8 month ago cuz I never make thing any less sense.
and Onika and Yami are different species of human despite their oddly strange appearance.
There were idea of an different earth where two country has become one country.
Im pretty sure I based his ability off from Rumia.
and I forgot who based off on Yami
Onika was straight up based of Marisa.
Thank, I supposed and the character bio are rather outdated.
Of course, these are pretty old since I haven’t drawn humanoid character that much anymore.
Another thing, I took many inspiration from Touhou to create these character of mine.

I drew this in 8 month ago.
this is masterpiece.
holy fuck.
Just because they journey ended.
<:TsubasaNeutral:688429723205894149>
or they just not fit.
they think that their journey ended.
Here a thing about these author.
I like to suffer myself by reading these kamen rider fic.
HMMMM.
<:MariaWhat:672245553920344080>
Trust me it bad as my dry balls.
and an oc that is just sougo but utter garbage...
So I been reading this precure and kamen rider zi-o that just rehashing the whole plot with pre-cure element.
right.
it can be any type of weapons like a melee, guns or even a mecha-like weapon.
it has the ability go shape shift itself into different type weapons to fit the user style of fighting.
However the Katana isn’t always gonna be a blade.
the katana signal is really strong to the point it could overloading their system.
It took them thousand year of searching until they find the katana signal.
Yes.
Yes, although it might did took them a while for them to track it down.
Saving the world from an enemy that has targeting the Abyss.
yes.
However, previous user are keeping their power by the Abyss as a gift for doing the right thing.
The Abyss then create a portal  and send the katana itself to another universe to find a new user.
It granted great power for to do the job, but here another thing once the user complete their task of saving the world/country.
So.. this concept is about a Katana called the Abyss that said to be design for people who wanted to saving the world or country.
I have this original concept in my mind.
that is curse

<:TsubasaDisgust:349013662775902209>
which include a oc that is 20 year old in his profile with a harem with the girls who is legitmate a middle school kids.
So.. I read this crossover fic between Kamen Rider and Yuki Yuna is a hero..
Despite the Abyss has unlimited storage of energy, it rather not the strongest thing.
Although it power is rather pale compare to symphogear.
of course the Abyss has the ability to travel to parallel universe and in fact a user can even do it when they got the power from the abyss.
and so the abyss travel to a different universe to find a new user.
the Abyss offering the power  that it granted user as a reward.
And when the user has saving their world.
It doesn’t have to be always a katana.
yes.
so it can able to turn into a weapons that fit the user fighting style.
Well here thing about the abyss is that it has a shape shifting ability.
the abyss mostly see the user as a host than a friend.
Yes it may sound dumb and all.
which is honestly kinda sad.
Since he entire existence is just a tool for world saving and grant user power when they have good intention for protecting their universe and world.
It may sound heartless from the abyss but it really wasn’t his fault since he was never created with an actual personality.
but the abyss does not care about humanity but rather focusing on saving the world and the universe over humanity.
despite it intention to grant the user power to save their world and universe.
The Abyss is also a sentient katana, although it lack personality.. per say.
It not too far but anyway.
my rambling talk about it.
So.. you need to backread.
I’m not sure if that just me being crazy or not.
I'm kinda confused about something, when im just look around to find a kamen rider crossover fic to read. Sometimes the author seem to use faiz of all thing.
Deja vu.
The organization were be called the Abyss Task.
anyway..
and yes dat gundam is kewl.
The Abyss goal isn’t always just to find new user but it also serve to recruit different branch of user into a organization group.
Anyway.. Gonna continue with the abyss concept.
since the user that wield the katana dealt with their own enemy in their universe.
So the enemy that targetting the katana isn’t always the problem.
Oh right, I forget to tell that there more to the abyss katana concept.
before.
I dare you do it cuz i have read this whole thing.
<:TsubasaNote:689554460044820608>
before giving your judgement.
Read this with every single chapter.
https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13425209/1/Remnant-s-Climax-Heroes
Anyway time to find something worst.
Goddamnit, these kamen rider crossover author just gonna test my thought of them being homophobic but im not gonna assume that too much.
So much hope has been shatter to piece.
<:ShirabeWeep:701475635025019000>
that one went well.
Goddamnit.
winning is fine but winning so much to the point where it pretty boring.
The thing about these crossover fic the oc always winning in a battle.
it doesn’t mean the original rider are still willing to help.
I have a thing for making fun of trope in fanfiction.
I made a crack-fic about how to make a kamen rider crossover fic.
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1L14DZNDVKHlAy0BxAoomwB1rEOs7D5sVJXdd1nUWtzM/edit
here a parody fic that i ripped it from garfief.
https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13746758/1/ramem-kider-xover-fic
stick is a hell with gundam.
Ah i see.
since YuYuYu has a religious element to it.
I wonder what kamen rider fit in Yuki Yuna is a hero universe
Despite not knowing much about faiz.
Ah..interesting.
you welcome
this look like it straight up from genshin impact
why are you so good at modeling.
Simpy put, Striberx is lazy as hell.
and botw.
look at honkai impact and genshin impact.
Cel-Shading is always appealing to me.
You went for cel-shaded?
texture is a bitch.
but Goddamn this model look better than rwby volume 4/8 model.
at distance, it look like a sprite.
*laugh in mmd hair physics*
yes.
and look like he done with her shit
yes that smug.
Gorilla.
HMMM.
*putting her in the waifu list*
that smug
you be dead by now.
If imagine try to lewd her.
dessu.
that face said it all.
Well a SI character but it not exactly myself.
This is a character for my fic.
Amiya *"Tachibana*"

this is curse.
how funny
HAHAHA-
Amiya True form.

okay enough of dani reference.
is it just me or she be looking kinda ***thicc***
unity particle system
sweet.
It short but it enough to understand.
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1f62G2MgF8tXOw6hpZyLZst5LTR4MrskUOqL6iJGgVOI/edit?usp=sharing
I got a small doc info for the character.
what do you think.
Finsihed Amiya and with Hibiki a size comparison.

why?
dear god
Although the pose is a bit eh...
yes i will.
I will keep the boot.
okay okay.
so it won’t look a little weird.
And yes it is Amiya but i should extend the angle and thigh part.
Also this is supposed to be Amiya.
I want it to keep thing simplistic.
Ehh...it look too busy but Thanks.
I feel like the oversize boot is a bit too much.

It not that it similiar to ssj, it just that..Im not good at designing sometimes.
but if I had to be honest, I found the leg connection look really silly.
on one, I wanted to give them leg but on the other I wanted to make them float without the legs.
There is a hard design choice for me to choose for Amiya.
Working on Amiya.

cool
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
also what is this website for?
that make sense.
ah.
why there so many tabs?
also...
cuz it rather jarring.
Here the backstory, good luck try to understand the whole thing.
https://docs.google.com/document/d/17icJl2dCeMp9VTNXSpfeU1u73baW5PzUOxWBhOTqYas/edit
But some Amiya backstory idea i have is a bit of iffy? sort of kind of way.
I have some idea for Amiya backstory.
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594> wat dis
cuz why the fuck not
or i should said this, THE ULTIMATE MOTHERFUCKING META CHARACTER IN THE ENTIRE EXISTENCE.
or to put it simple, Amiya is everything.
the original idea for the personality is to have a lot of personality trait which by that sentence mean that Amiya has no distinct personality to be unique since the original point of Amiya is to be a parody of Self Insert.
There are many idea for her/his personality such as the original idea for the personality.
Since I haven’t decide on Amiya personality just yet.
well sort of but you can get the idea.
Self Insert.
yeah i know that sound utter odd but Amiya is basically SI but..pretty meta.
gosh im not sure if i can finish it until the end of the year.
some sneak peak for Amiya info.

but there are other idea draft for Amiya backstory.
Amiya was meant to be a giant parody of a power fantasy SI character but I change Amiya into a really meta character.
Re-Plot: Amiya was change into RE-AMIYA
it a cover for my fic.

folding sticker suck ass.
ain’t gonna lie, edited chris gun is a chore
Amiya Tachibana.

yes
joke aside, the reason I randomly switch Amiya gender was because Amiya are capable to change their own gender.
N e i ther that why Amiya gender is just all over the place.
because Amiya is meant to be genderless
<:HibikiBlep:605209109284782090>
I have finished Amiya Bio
https://docs.google.com/document/d/19FOucRH_W5Ynedw_c9W5xiRna_DFe9H70zrFYkU65cA/edit
their mouth being covered is relfect that they don't talk that much.
Amiya.FILE is not much of a talker but he chill.
Yes
Also this is an example of what a buddy look like
you might see some similairty
If you familiar with megaman battle network or atleast digimon.
yes
what do you think?
it took alot of work but it might aswell be worth it
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ice4W45JFmiUW9ygNImAG-kMepZcri8uWMx_KsZp9zQ/edit Okay so I polish the information for buddy quite alot
but HMMMMMM IM BAD-
I wanna do more info about the buddy program.
Then again, they are pretty diverse.
I might design a buddy based on geah character at some point.
*yes* and of course I planned to design more Buddy.
Well what do you think?
So...Amiya.File is a sentient digital being named The Buddy Program or Buddy for short. He was the first of his kind created by a very computer genius, Keiji Fukuma.

The Buddy Program was created for multiple purposes such as: Education, fixing electronics, assistant and more.

They were made for both adults and children-alike around the world.
So...behind this art and character (who is actually Amiya except it a different amiya.)
You know i have some small concept behind this art.
Amiya

<:HibikiMonch:688190074646691843>
ah, thank you
Which is why he had knowledge program because he was supposed to know every single thing.
He is able to storage every single and I mean every single knowledge about the earth history and secret.
He has everything to that of the finished Buddy except Amiya has a unique trait that most Buddy are not able to.
So...Amiya is the prototype stage of the Buddy that Yuko was created.
and yes, Amiya.FILE is a prototype.

and give some new info on the art
So I gave Amiya a make up

i wanna hug her
cuteee
but of course, you can ask me more question about the Buddy.
but sometimes they don't, that because user do let their buddy learning to be their own person.
Well, they do actually reflect on the role and user they assigned to.
The Buddy is more popular in Japan since well it is the country they were created from.
Well there are about a million of Buddy exist in the world.
<:GarieLaugh:740956278163243050>
fat
and thank.
I had a habit of pressing ctrl-z except it not there
and it was pain.
I have try before
especially the leg because it took me long to get the leg look nautral.
it a hell to design.
thank you
plus what do you think of Nursia?
pretty nice
Buddy Gen one: Nursia.FILE

then it would look good.
Hmmm...put the color in black and white
I got one more info dump about Virus.Ware.
Virus.Ware is not a single buddy but there are like a lot of them in a program that storage them when one Virus.Ware being down.
indeed.
but here another thing that make these buddy type more difficult to deal with is that they have a rapid healing factor when being damaged by an anti-virus program.
plus Buddy Virus are muted so you won't hear them talking but they do have a distinct glitching noise when their walking.
there a difference between Buddy Virus and Normal Buddy is that Buddy Virus has a distinct appearance such as the skinny arm and three white thin finger, full pitch black clothes and very glitchy.
So Virus.Ware is basically a buddy virus that inflicted in every electronic.
The enemy of the Buddy

polybird

I love it
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>

so, what do you think.

ah sorry.
So...when in making this, a I had to trace the "A" from the AXZ logo for this.
or atleast true human form.
This would be Amiya true form at some point.
I made Amiya

but i have hug fetish
good thing i have no foot fetish.
stick
literally
stick
that i came up.
Hmmm... the whole eight elemental creators remind me of an original concept idea about Alphabet God.
diversity is important ofc.
so They pretty much just look similiar?
are they somehow related to star?
ooo.
also ignore the misspelling of are-
I gave Amiya a much cleaner redesigning and this is his final design.

it look good but it doesn’t look right without sum paint.
due to his status quo being almost a reality-warp being with no true form.
the gilitchy face is a representation of not having his own identity.
the face is his not actual face
<@!430379754190012426> btw dis is amiya canon design
I finally create Amiya.

but sure.
Usually my noise could easily pass out as a monster of it own.
I think Blue Heart, D-Ty and D-Pi are my favorite.
But what do you think about it?
yeah I noticed my strange habit of drawing the leg look really long.
sticc.
damn...jac-2 poportion are rather awkward.
oddly enough, I never noticed the way i draw the character are lanky as hell.
I still think these are good design.
These bring back memory when I was still a big neptunia fan.
A bunch of old Neptunia oc I made in 2020.
So back in 2016 mor was a generic MC oc that is a half enderman and half human.
or Mor for short.
So the first oc was name Jackle Mor Mamanda.
Amiya was like the second one but my main oc.
yes it a different oc except it was my first ever oc.
Not exactly
are you talking about amiya?
what do you mean by digital creature?
so like half of his face or rather half of his body is basically made of black hole.
Maybe make him into a being from space.
So...I wanna revision my oc into something more...
ohhh interesting.
right but that not what i ask.
Btw what kind of species is star? since I can tell he not really a human.
Although, I wanna make him completely different from his minecraft status quo.
he was just a generic half enderman and half human that use dark magic and all that stuff.
my first ever oc was techinically a minecraft oc in 2016.
huh.
one half is black and one half is normal.
who techinically has a half color faces.
it remind me of my first ever oc.
ah okay.
that?
What with the half of face being well...
So I came up with my own little universe known as the Amiya-Verse.
<:GarieOhYeah:688429715769262187>
except he felt weightless
chunky boi
sweet
oof
It easy to call your oc as just character.
Buddy are made out of data and code so Yuko had to be very delicate on creating them without distraction, noise problem and interruption.
So...Yuko created them by a super computer that has an extreme advance Program to create Digital Lifeform which is the Buddy.
So more lore dump about the buddy but this is about the method of creating them.
I mean atleast it not terriblely loose on the joint
cuz i still can see the numb mark
and sanding
all it need a good paint.
pog
christ that a lot.
but however everyone can hear amiya unatural voice
in term of personality, amiya is known to ne a smug asshole.
despite amiya wasn’t practically creepy in general.
what do you think?
btw this is for the time and space amiya.
Amiya in general was a strange character in both personality and themself.
So...this voice is Amiya canonically voice since I do wanna give that strange vibe from Amiya.
So I made a small story about ten ancient warrior.
https://docs.google.com/document/d/12aGezGsWbwsz7oTE63EAiT_NbSTgs1cxyCT_uoPg8XQ/edit
snow are techinically rain of small particle.
give her a double gauntlent that look like bird beak.
indeed.
yes
Amiya is techinically an immortal teasing asshole with the most punchable smug that prefer having a normal life and probably causing trouble along with the stroganoff.
but to say this in a simple a manner.
Amiya is also think shit cuz he may win on a logically agruement but lose emotionally
anyway, my turn.
yep lol.
hmm interesting.
I did gave him a personality, Amiya is an person who techinically being a bit of an asshole with the most punchable smug.
like a human.
I put Amiya in a slice of life universe of Symphogear, having a normal life, hanging out with the stroganoff.
but I did something more to the character.
Amiya is techinically a being that warp reality and multiversal traveler.
As for my character
But it sound cool.
im not too familiar with mythology.
since i fixed grammar issue on the info.
sum info.

my OC last name is actually mormanda.
Nah

smoke
although would look perfect for a weapon selection icon
that is a sexy **THICC** sword
but it look off
I mean the left is fine
I use medibang too <:ElfneinShock:688429716956381285>
so no problem with big boots
I mean it a good design
although, that sword does be looking kinda **THICC**
*he exist*
*yes*
well the vocal is inspired by the noise of course, but also inspired from fantasy golem and the jewish folklore golem
a Fodder for the Valkyrie Swan project.
https://twitter.com/I_Amiya_/status/1379664973794668544?s=20
I made another version of Amiya human form but looking more normal
yes
as fuck
they look good
since Amiya human form always meant to be looking like Hibiki.
yes
although the hair does look kinda like maria hair in what way or another-
I also design amiya hair to be identical to hibiki just a little longer
although it ended up looking way too very off
I originally wanted to have amiya to have their skin color to be pure white
or cosmic horror
I mean Amiya is techinically a cosmic being
because it just way too indicated that it totally no human.
or face
well it was intentional to have the creepy eyes
well slightly.
and they have a claws hidden
although what your opinion on the design overall?
thanks
I finally finished this
https://twitter.com/I_Amiya_/status/1377508112605663245\
i think that shem-miku
ohh
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
although what do you guys think about the design?
as for AmiRex has much higher strength and higher agility.
Here an interesting information, AmiRex is suitable for combat because amiya default form is rather weak in strength
although i was gonna originally call AmiRex
yes
<@!457268466429329429>
https://twitter.com/I_Amiya_/status/1382570105704390658
working Amiya rex mode

although i could easily describe Amiya is a lesser getter emperor
finally, i don’t think i can do it, unless i design a different design for amiya all together.
secondly it just not gonna worth the time for me to do so.
and design character for fun only.
due being amaetur artist who only draw static pose.
firstly the dragon head, it was difficult as shit to make it position in different angle.
I seriously don’t wanna design his mecha form for many reason.
although aside this
AY NO-
NOOOO-
and bigger claws
i do image a complete dragon form that is basically a trex with a dragon snort and wings.
I did think about having a second mecha assistant to give him wings.
this one is a difficult for me to design because it might take time for me to get look right.
Abaren-oh yes
He able to de-attache his body part and rearrange them in order to form a second form.
yes
https://twitter.com/i_amiya_/status/1382342253889220612?s=21

Furai model is good


i will coloring it tomorrow

holy damn
<@!457268466429329429>
FINALLY FINISH
https://twitter.com/I_Amiya_/status/1384023944584331266

<@!430379754190012426>
and yeah this is very strange one
so yeah im made a canon origin story for Amiya
https://twitter.com/i_amiya_/status/1383457138089992200?s=21
that would look a lot cleaner
i think just a single 5000
I wanna make the design look less janky
<@!457268466429329429>
Working on a redesign for AmiRex

the Dmjii equvalent.
I planned to make s6 for two duo.
Mhm.
<:KirikaScared:672584678993297431>
Sorry!
Of course character having different personality and design.
Yes very indeed
Right, Valkyrie swan is heavily based on Symphogear since Pug and I had use the anime as our base
so where do i started with this.
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UJGCh3hdfyyzx6ow17UxTX8Apg8JvejRVm4a8I3ANHo/edit I made my own lyric
ah i see.
but ain’t gonna lie he does look a little like thouser.

https://twitter.com/i_amiya_/status/1385638400045158403?s=21
yes
So this is a small about my OC personal life, Amiya.
https://twitter.com/i_amiya_/status/1385250475075719169?s=21

And also it will turn pink when transform into AmiRex
so i tribute the color.
Well...the original design has purple color.
well that good to know and what do you think the color?
Ah nice, so what else you wanna say?
what do ya think so far?
<@!457268466429329429>
i finally finish this.
i mean they are.
ikr, well what do you think about the design?
<@456226577798135808> Okay so I request someone to draw the design of Venus Ghidorah and this is the result (artwork by Sanchos_art)
yeah, i mean it mention in the design section
also this ghidorah has five head
yes
and spray acid
Also i gave this ghidorah produce toxic gas from the wings
and pretty much has zero muscle and bone
due being a mutated plant.
Yeah someone also suggest for Venus Ghidorah had to constantly shifting his body to move around
he suggested that ability and wrote the ability description.
Yeah that ability was an idea from someone in a discord server that is about toku and kaiju talk.
i mean you ask alot of question about these two
what do you think about their ability, idea and other junk
neat.
You can continue reading
there
gimme a moment
Hmmm...sure
You can read the first and second doc  and ask me a lot of question
so i made my own godzilla universe with these
Im a fan of godzilla franchise
yes
<@456226577798135808> I heard you like kaiju so i think you will like these

https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Uin5IRT5D25VFmHH-MEVRq3iNEwyEjwo_csl9f3bwvI/edit
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fQfDp-Ok-zx0B556IX7xLCL0lOcHUbOW-9Nz9nDDhKI/edit
the valkyrie system is very strictly focus on female.
yeah.
Well...who know.
Also im not sure i should say this..but we kinda made Valentina (our version of Maria) a russian and a transgender.
That was the original idea
yes
we never use any 4kid parody.
actually no.
<:TsubasaIgnite:672861877407318047>
or just cannot think shit
Although we do struggle a lot because writer block and idea block.
we just writing the plot and story.
season 1 and season 2 are still a work in progress.
Mhm.
This is one of the idea that been used in the original remake idea.
after season 1 is a starting point for the next season with new idea.
and it pretty much the same thing.
very much.
yes
because...Mothra Saturian is made nothing but pure gas.
Thank, got any question?
https://docs.google.com/document/d/15YWHdGhb7vwbuOgZzQ6KJWf0eM5I9iV7tMU_6yO55eE/edit <@456226577798135808> Okay i made my own incarnation of MOSURAAA YA
yes
emperor ghidorah?
but that doesn’t really prove a thing
I mean yeah he can blast a hole to hollow earth which is a little insane
i think the people think legendary can beat heisei is pretty much sucking legendary cock too much.
MV Godzilla is strong on his own but he cannot beat the thunder thigh heisei godzilla
yeah heisei is borderline broken
there also people agrue about how legendary can beat heisei goji.
there more to it than that
You gotta need to do research about showa ghidorah.
Wikizilla.
no shit
showa ghidorah destroyed a planet in one day
Eh..
I wanna see how Venus Ghidorah fight Monsterverse Ghidorah considering MV Ghidorah is pretty weak since the showa ghidorah is more powerful than MV.
Hmm...
<:ShirabeConcern:586404485598019604>
isn’t she young?
hold up.
sexy yoko-
yes
no cap
ez game
<:ElsaSmug:688429724443213903>
he has aimbot so he can win
Sniper from tf2..?
she can't die
considering from what i know.
I think BRS can win.
both ability and origin.
I mean it has many information about this kaiju
but...I kinda scrapped that idea and I make froggy boi rodan
I mean originally pitch an idea for my Rodan to be the god and creator of earth
neat.
Huh.
Let say my take on Varan that he both a god and the creator of Earth.
I mean i usually go more crazy on my universe and my take on toho kaiju
Hahaha yeah it is bizzare but it an interesting concept in otherwise to say
so what your honest opinion?
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1te3CWMZkb_bvB3m_hB-bd7hJXBQx66tH7F2_bgsyz5w/edit

https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sKvh-9Xzl9BSF-Ceu_xftHieJ2utgrRvn1-A-h1Mfzw/edit

Okay so here my take on rodan for my universe. <@456226577798135808>
because i draw character that standing
im not good at drawing pose
ah
I wonder how will my kumonga fight againist the final wars kumonga.

<:PharaBlush:741631423999639673>
~~the leg has monster drink logo~~
Funny enough! I actually met Fenny in a touhou discord server i was in and that was before I even really found this server at all.
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1l6Hzh3AlhRIA1GgMQjNgFkJf3BN_HYBSoejTWIeNbzc/edit So before I actually go into gear, I used to be an active touhou fan so these are my touhou oc

Alrighttttt, I was just a little worried.
sorry about that.
Ah okay.
it look nice but I feel like you added the curve because of what he said, right?

I mean there nothing wrong with having curve but I think you don't have to force yourself to get out from your comfort zone, I think you could try to mimic curve with just line tool without actually adding actual curve to it. I mean I did the same thing!
ain’t gonna lie, it look very appealing
and I have the urge to hug it.
but it look cute <:KanadeBlush:672455329451343882>
Baka hubby.

<:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
that the one-
yep
very lewd
I forgot there one artist that ship edgebiki and hibiki <:HibikiTsun:738234664656961556>
long hair biki is a cutie
with a smug face
who that miku
yall fucking horny-
can we talk about chris involvement in this mess-
yeah
from the look of it
funny
i mean the subreddit
eh?
wait when-
somone should post this in r/symphogear

miku is hungry for that biki comfort
i swear to godm
I think i saw a noise biki
show me
wait really?
spare me
<:KirikaFish:717138469381734471>
why
i m a g i n e
imagine miku having a harem of biki

i swear these two are the best lesbian
yuuki aoi is a shotcon?! <:TsubasaShock:689705053401251867>

this Biki can make miku go hmm..let say steammy.
I guess she also a degenelate.
huh.
wait her voice actress has an incest fetish-
1 milion way to achieve form.
Symphogear has like..
totally
it maybe because the gear itself has element from kamen rider and magical girl.
symphogear is mostly has a tokusatsu influnce
because they both similiar
I see why Kamen Rider can work well with symphogear
they have a thing for berserk.
I can see how symphogear and kamen rider can work well as a crossover.
but then again it totally not.
It possible.
I feel like Hibiki Ignite Module somehow predict cross-z magnam.
and when..GX was release..
i forgot.
When KR build was release?
rip maria
why symphogear character are more enjoyable than any anime character i like-
horny
chris seeing thing enough
sure
oh sorry.
there a noise based on alien baltan.
and let not forget
and tokusatsu
I swear whoever was making symphogear is a fan of kamen rider
Tsubasa is felt like a kamen rider
in matter of fact, symphogear is so overpowered
i can’t remember.
or idk
Tank are cool.
im still confused by this
why is this a trend?

This optimus design came from a 2010 transformers video game called Transformers: War for Cybertron.


i supposed seige prime is his cybertronian form ~~he look barely different from earthrise~~

I think Shinji is a realistic protag.
Me too.
but for christ he doesn’t have the best parent.
I mean get that Shinji is a whinny child.
Hibiki would help Shinji mental ill.
atleast she doesn't have depression.
which is more fitting.
although..the design of Unit-01 Bikki remind me of the metal build unit-01
i mean she has a berserk mode
Hibiki being Unit-01 is rather fitting
the only thing that catch my attention is the floofy tail

Ah another anime with yuri.
and it was just post now.
https://youtu.be/vFJyvYiTG8c This new anime trailer just catch my interest.
totally very japan-like huh?
Yeah only pantsu.
there should be a term for "magical girl” that using super-powered weapons.
Assault lily is symphogear but only weapons.
I guess you have to use vpn..
welp...
I'm more of a digimon fan since i always love the design of the digimon themself.
Saver was the original japanese name.
because the main character use their digivice to transform themself into a digimon.
OHHH THAT FRONTIER.
The main protag in saver isn’t that dorky.
Anyway.
hi
I still find Powered Zenon look a lot like Star Saber from Victory.
🗞️
You being a naughty one
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
idk who they are but cute lesbian.
Horror fandom are different because it a different genre.
ugh..
BNHA..fanbase
since they rather buried in the deep.
I think finding a toxic fan is way more harder
ain’t we supposed to talk about something else.
I feel bad for dream.
im not kidding, they have some serious problem.
dream stans are really scary
Hahaha
Rwby fandom is something i really don’t like.
spoopy
Is SAO was even that bad as people complaining.
I still don’t like Bakugo.
Power Ranger isn’t that bad since Saban licence the footage and the suit.
Black Rock Shooter is one of those anime that has an interesting concept.
that is either a shitty pun or a joke.
Infinite Stratos is an interesting concept.
BNHA is pretty forgettable for me.
im done with that shit.
and that it
I only watch part 1
It so hard to watch without killing my sanity.
include my old friends.
I had zero interest on jojo because the overused joke.
is always worth saving.
Anything for a sibling
I never watch it cuz it not interesting enough for me.
jesus i just thought that was hibiki.
is anime dub does better.
Panty and stocking english dub.
Because Gundam model kit are ten time popular.
h uh.
Accel World is the only anime i watch is the closet thing to SAO
indeed.
a mmorpg to be precise?
I mean isn’t SAO take place in a video game?
Yeah i do hope so.
I really to like see more of haru journey.
That fucking sucks.
So..there more story to accel world than the anime adaption.
Understandable
So they learn that mistake and improve on it.
People make mistake.
I like the idea of that a main character see himself as a chubby chibi man.
that gonna be sucks.
Jesus.
But i guess that make sense.
I expected him to be a bit older.
Wow..that young?
I mean he just an average student.
Because he is fat.
i do remember people don’t like haru in accel world because of his design.
Uhuh.. I see.
huh..
I still do not understand why SAO consider to be the worst anime.
Im not sure if SAO and AW are in the same universe.
Since despite being a mecha for recuse purpose, it look cute and cool.
I like the mecha from yatterman.
Time Bokan series is an interesting one.
I mean who know really.
I believe the 2008 remake does has a better voice for gan.
out tho I do not like gan voice in the 1977 anime.
And the movie did a good job stay true on it source material.
There is a live action yatterman movie
Yeah i know that cuz i only watch the 2008 version.
in cartoon network.
I remember  watching a 2008 mecha anime called Yatterman.
ah okay.
I haven’t watch accel world for a long time..soo.
oh..
or an inn.
A shrine?
Haru getting hug by his petite butterfly girlfriends.
adorable.
he look really normal.
strangely enough.
he look like a marketable plushies.
welp i guess he always a round boi.
but he did have a normal look in some scene
Make sense.
Ptff.
of course.
I still like Haru cuz he basicially a melon boy.
damn
sound similiar to SAO.
taking place in your brain.
Brain Burst is basically a fighting game
it never goes good.
eh, relatable
the only machine robo content i watch is machine robo rescue.
WAIT THERE A NEW GODZILLA ANIME?
Black Rock Shooter does has an interesting design.
I love this opening to death.
*Love is here*
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7nEtz8t0lc&t=21s
but yes.
Ebirah is actually a lobster-
I can see that
than ever
Gabara look more menacing
it make more sense when he was an aquatic dinosaur.
I do like titanosaurs design.
We can’t confirm if ebirah is gonna appear.
Gabara is the single horn monster appear in the mist.
there is gonna be gabara, titanosaurs and manda.
about godzilla s.p
I check wikizilla
make sense.
so it possible that it can asexually reproduce.
the original Rodan can lay eggs.
Also there speculation that ebirah is gonna be in the anime at some point.
Hmm who know.
And i believe rodan is gonna be not larger than his other incarnation.
Rodan look rather more pterosaurs like
Okay now let analyzed the new godzilla anime trailer!
meeting the creator of his childhood mecha anime
Im excited for Godzilla singular point
I feel like the anime is gonna be just about gay as geah.
I watch assault lily episode 1 and it was really good.
shinji is well shinji
Rei is cute
kinda fucked up when you ship her with shinji.
and Rei..well she is bascially a clone of shinji mom.
yes cute but a piece of shit
Asuka is a piece of shit.
But failed horribly.
with the pilot.
does any employer even bother try to have a conversation.
He got a point
but they still piece of shit
They maybe the savior of earth.
Nerv are piece of shit tho.
Evangelion is describe to be a mind fuck.
im pretty sure people can be that whiny when they in that age.
Then again, he a fourteen mentally unstable kid.
since Toho never really bought the right for Gyaos.
I don't believe a gamera kaiju would appear.
No.
that make me like are you kidding me? this is a godzilla anime not a gamera anime
there are people say that the flock of rodan are gyaos.
I didn’t realized until now
Take a look at this

but i noticed that one is colorful and has a single horn.
In Godzilla s.p trailer there the  close up scene of rodan.
I never noticed something
I still see gundam as a mecha show.
Riri is pure bean
That is cute.
But i think simple is good
and they do have a really simple mechasim.
but they are easy to draw.
They really basic
The fact the girl are using awesome weapons
I was gonna make a joke that assault lily is bascially RWBY but gayer.
all over the place.
but then again im just nitpicking.
the doll look actually more natural than the anime.
oh the thick-ness in the anime design look odd
I mean they dolls.
I thought that just me but i double check and yeah every single one of them has that.
and wow i thought i was crazy when i noticed how thicc the girls are.
their anime design look more normal.
I think it the clothes that make them look rather odd
weird
I search it up and oh boi those dool rather...
Assault lily was originally a doll figure series?
wait hold on
those two are similiar to madoka and homura
riri and yuyu
we doomed <:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
well shit.
no
I just found out Assault Lily Bouquet was made by the same animation studio who made madoka magica <:ShirabeShock:744441685324595231>
great this increase my gayness <:ShirabeDrool:688429716557791326>
that is cursed
what is that
To be fair, riri does call yuyu as big sister-
Hmmm..
i would say yes
we got assault lily which is already obvious since it legitmate yuri baiting us.
Alright so how many anime that is gay.
crossover?
all i saw is magical girl with colorful dress with a long ass rollout
Im a tiny familiar with precure
I hope assault lily bouquet get more recognition even if it only has 5 episode at the time.
they are indeed **HUGE**
yes
lily are the protector and use weapons that called as Charm to fight against them.
About teenage girl enter an academy to fight against a monster called HUGE.
I feel like assault lily will have 13 episode.
but who know we can wait for the next episode
well who know the yuri in that anime are bait
1% character development
all assault lily character are 99% thigh
But of course the anime was based off a doll figure series which go by the same name.
Even Noise has a nice ring to it then Huge
I laugh while typing
That name is so stupid as hell.
<:MikuHype:688429715676987428>
I can say the same with symphogear.
it is good but not a masterpiece by any mean.
yes
sim p
I insult them by one word
yes
simp.
rent a girlfriends isn’t the worst *stare at boku no pico*
it bound to be a shit show.
when an anime title rent a girlfriend.
and not making him a goddamn dense moron.
Ichika can be easily fixed by giving more diverse personality to make him unique.
If only IS focused more thing than harem.
Which make me really think that the girl are goddamn psychopath.
although, they have the tedency of almost killing ichika.
Ichika is a goddamn moron.
But at the same times I don’t want to because it a harem.
I was thinking about watching Infinite Stratos because I like the idea of the I.S
yeah..
but then again, they went with the crappy premise that is the only man use a machine built for woman.
I mean it easy to rewritten the character personality and flesh them out.
getting rid of the protag isn't the best solution tho.
What I like about in the dub of IS is that some of the girl had an accent that reflect their respective country.
It really does make me wanna avoid it.
The fact IS is a mecha anime with harem trope in it.
I just only watch episode 1.
Ichika look handsome but yet he a moron.
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
good but..
I watch the first episode and it was...
fuck it, im gonna watch is.
sure it different from other magical girl.
how that make sense:
It still a magical girl-
the action is about good as a sugary biscuit
sure the concept is neat but it felt eh..
nothing really special.
Hmm.. a world that filled with super power.
unlike bna.
But a better shonen.
It feel more like a trigger action anime with a suggestive outfit.
Kill la kill..is less a magical girl.
Really? like what?
although just season 1
I watch nanoha before.
Let see..is there any magical girl anime that has at least similiar to geah.
Understandable.
I can understand from a comedy standpoint-
The only thing i know about it is the main protag being a pervert.
Is DxD any good?
I think I remember there was this one reverse harem that has the girl who used to be a chubby otaku but with the power of anime logic, magically make her look beautiful and skinny.
oh boi..
<:ShirabeFear:696380146248319066>
basically.
it give me the same feeling of Gundam Unicorn destroy mode.
To be honest.. When Dot Blastrizer in his G-EXT.
<:ShirabeCry:671887081026617345>
<:KirikaScared:672584678993297431> <:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
HMMMM IDK WHAT TO WATCH-
That im missing
I think there a joke here.
Even though, they had opposite skin color since Huge is white and Klaxosaurus is black.
Let see, they have blue blood and had an unknown origin at first glance.
You know what the HUGE from Assault Lily remind me of? Klaxosaurus from Franxx.
hahaha..
pretty interesting.
So it still unknown what the first start of mecha musume?
Girls und Panzer?
But where does that idea come from? The only thing that I know that Kancolle is the first one who came up with shipgirl
To be honest... When i first expose to Azur lane and finding the concept of a real battleship turn into a bunch of cute girl is an oddity.
I would like to see an eva collab.
I mean it one of the magical girl that has the same feeling of symphogear.
I still wanna see a xdu event with yuki yuna is a hero.
especially Noise and yes im highly obesessed with mindless alien that carbonize human.
the concept, character and more.
I like symphogear for a reason.
Well he is a man of culture.
Why is that?
wait really?
Especially end of evangelion.
to the brain.
Eva is a mind fuck.
since their firearm are rather not useful.
I mean it make sense.
Although, it not perfect.
the mobility are the only thing that the eva can do best.
while their phsyical strength are not the best.
and they pretty fast.
but they are flexible as hell.
But then again, the Eva can be killed off easily.
so it make sense.
Funny considering anno is a giant fan of ultraman.
since they just cyborg.
I wouldn’t call eva a robot.
Ah yes, eva are flat out angel clone.
Okay now the eva topic.
uh Sorry i just remember something quite terrifying.
**country humans flash back*
I do wanna see a reverse Mecha Musume.
and that look hella gay <:KanadeSmug:688191203178840064>
Yes
which is the best thing ever.
The idea of a cute moe girl that equip with dangerous weapons and armor that akin to a mecha.
Mecha Musume is an interesting thing.
that had no experience with animation and anime.
also who decide to gave the idea of asking a shitty western dubbing company.
The Ex arm artwork look better than the cgi.
Danball senki is my childhood anime.
*stare at ben 10 fanfiction*
I will call the fbi
isn’t ben and gwen are cousin.
hold up
Damnit.
Ah fuck.
lmao
girls last tour manga ending is heart wrenching.
don’t even dare.
Solo no
such as one that about a world of little boy or *ahem* ||shota||....
Oh boy, I read other weird manga.
I feel like the anime won't ended with just 13 episode.
but not yet to revealed what it really about.
It slowly building up.
Make sense.
to be fair, does the figure line even had a plot.
make sense.
oh right.
it actually based off a toyline by the name of the anime.
not..really.
but it boring with a plot.
Sure it fun to watch cute girls with cool weapons.
cuz that what their were fighting for.
hold up isn't assault lily main problem is the HUGE.
i mean it started as a SOL rwby-like anime.
Assault lilly bouquet seem to building some plot.
for a second, i thought that was korone-
yes
but level 5 being level 5
it easy for them to say it the same universe
get your shit together
damnit level 5
like..inazuma take place somewhere either 2030 or 2040.
but both series take place in different year.
that inazuma and danball are the same universe
i mean we could make a headcanon.
then why there are some aspect that is similiar from each other series.
if it a different reality.
that doesn't make sense.
where does inazuma take place?
danball senki take place in the future right?
Wait..hold up.
or it implying that Inazuma and Danball are in the same universe.
although the adult look like he a child predator.
Inazuma Eleven is a sport anime but very shonen.
yes.
These show are from different universe.
Except.
but not it the same character.
they just share the similiar design.
if you want more magicial girl that wanna make you feel sadness.
Yuki Yuna is a Hero.
that is the shit tho.
Yokai Watch
that shit make no sense
<:HibikiThink:688429715362414641>
<:MariaWhat:672245553920344080>
still can't take precure seriously-
it basically lbx but sentient and waifu.
I have watch frame arms girls
okay maybe not pokemon but perhap digimon is the better comparison.
Pokemon but dinosaur.
does anyone remember that?
I remember Dinosaur king.
that the same name.
melua
kamina.
for some reason that look like-
someone made a fic out of that
Dear lord.
that i wanna bitch slap.
the little cute piece of shit with a bratty attitude.
And i see louise
i saw chris chan
Who remember SD Gundam the legend of 3 kingdom?
there no way to describe it
I mean they just work.
is it just me or dynazenon robot mode remind me of star saber from transformers victory.
giant robo go brrr
I like the actual gundam
it spolier free so it gud.
https://twitter.com/enojunjunjun/status/1335541855920955395/photo/1
YOOO DYNAZENON HAS A SUIT <:KirikaPog:605209108827734017>
I prefer her manga design.
it just remind me of a curse image similiar to this
whoops.
Please never bring up that curse image.
let see color white check
but she look like a cow mixed with a spider
Idk how spider anatomy even fucking work.
it the head or torso-
yes
yes.
yes.
my bad <:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
Sorry her face remind me of a mammal
it look good but I still find the head look like a cow.
On the other hand it her light novel design.
I’m little mixed bag on her design.
that look curse
wait you made that?
the artstyle in general is good but the anime does look a little odd.
Jojo is okay but it didn't do much for me since the meme surrounding it kill my interest.
I have a thing for biting and that.
https://tenor.com/view/nose-bleed-anime-sparkle-gif-5469034
r o c c
rock
Belle, huh.
<:VanessaSmug:689395769199165447>
i will give a smooch to the cheek for ya
that fine
They just straight up execute a poor normal soul.
which mean they very normal.
Norma mean normal <:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
the x-file intro is a meme <:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
Weiss is the tsun tsun
If you put that image out of context.
*huh*
loli kiss.
it always has been 🔫
digimon evolution in general are a mixed bag.
it the hat-
even though, he not.
to be fair, he does look alot like shoutmon a bit.

I mean gatchmon is adorable.
I still love appmon because it a new concept i enjoy alot
I would recommend tamer if you wanna watch a digimon anime.
and completely different
I remember digimon fan really dislike appmon due to being really gimmicky.
cuz human are able to enter the digital world, a world where it basically all data.
Well the original isekai.
so in digimon appli, digimon is basically fiction in that world.
a digimon game
From what i know, that agumon is came from a game.
Appmon would consider as a subspecies to digimon.
digimon can be pretty much anything.
and yes that too.
digimon can evolve without the need of a partner.
yes.
is that digimon are not living creature but being made out of data.
the difference between digimon and pokemon.
Nah digimon are way different
digimon are capable to talk.
yes
Although digimon hunter is a shitty one.
looking good
wait da cg rite
i am the only one like the xros war digimon?
you pretty much ruined appmon potiental to be seperate from digimon.
thank toei
Wow
i wanna hug it
that thing
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
<:GarieLaugh:740956278163243050>
the first result-
*COUGH*
it good shit.
because hey
I only know the anime
mob was just too nice to even kill people.
I like mob as a character
comparing saiki to mob is a big stretch.
and a precious boi.
lack of self esteem
emotion.
Cocoa i hate you
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
WHAT THE FUCK DOES THAT MEAN-
WAIT HOLD ON
wtf does that mean.
Saiki is funny
this is why i divorce your ass off.
Cocoa
<:MariaNo:672658725986762764>
i heard someone said mob
sure his power is impressive but...i sometimes forget he has that.
I like him as a character more so than his power.
i mean he a cute little precious dork.
in a weird way.
You know, look at DoGatchmon closely, he kinda look like a medabots.
I mean it rare to see a doll line of figure get an anime adaption is somewhat a rarity.
Because the assault lily anime is literally an anime adapation of a doll figure line which goes by the same legitmate name—
assault lily is a good anime with a cool concept but I wish it was expand further, even though it may aswell just a way to promote their doll figure line.
she just too fucking durable.
a op main character is not actually op.
I might just watch gundam build fighter-
I think I won't be remember much about gundam timeline and a lot of shit
that a weird looking fish
I seee...
good thing it on youtube
Oh gosh, my nostalgia heart
<:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
FINALLY A SEASON 2 OF AN ANIME THAT I WATCH FOR A LONG TIME
GASPPPPPPP, OH MY GOD YESSSSS
https://tenor.com/view/shock-anime-gasp-surprise-gif-15981054
but beggar can't be choose
but lbx girls just show up out of nowhere
one more thing, they could've easily create an anime adapation of soukou musume (armored girls).
these design are more reflect on the lbx than the lbx girls design
I mean look at this

as a former danball senki fan, yeah I wish they could’ve just use the armored girls design.
yeah the plot is literally a discount symphogear.
Also the plot...
on their own, they look cool but they barely relfect the lbx they were based on  but except for the odin girl because it rather more recognizable due to the color and design.
also...let me talk about the design of the lbx girls.
But the transformation for each girls look like a low budget ps3 game transformation
I swear fate transformation from that one nanoha movie is much longer than this-
Either way, the transformation for the girls is....
is it just me or the frame per second for the cg is...rather laggy-
OOF, the cg is good but...
It seem likely the first episode is not the best one huh.
And from what im looking at here.
they made an anime adapation from the armour musume game?
Wait lbx girls?
I will say this, but Lori and Reiji are gayyyy as fuck <:MikuHype:688429715676987428>
bonk
🗞️
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
my sorry what?
seriously he also need some shave
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
and some coffee
and a toaster
Ironwood need a snicker
if you counted as launching children at the sky-
yes but does he has a choice?
Jeez the old man can't catch a break for a thousand years.
I still feel bad for ozpin.
<:TsubasaIgnite:672861877407318047>
and somehow team RWBY managed to beat the Ace-ops who CLEARLY HAD BETTER FIGHTING EXPERIENCE THAN THEM-
such as...Ruby didn't bother to tell Ironwood the truth.
I have mixed opinion on v7.
I would be perfectly fine if rwby was just a lighthearted action show.
But if i had to be honest, I rather take monty way of rwby over how rooster teeth did it.
WUT
Wut
RWBY character is kind one-dimensional.
Rooster Teeth isn’t the best at those stuff, it usually the writer or the creator be the one who do the job.
which is pretty damn good
<:MikuBliss:336657233712513024>
then alia and reiji are happy together
I finished gundam build fighter and it was  the best shit i ever watch
djskskkxkz
or that shit
like "just a passing through gunpla fan"
and he just pull a decade
lori dad is the coolest dad ever.
I swear to god
He design look closer to that of a dinosaur.
I realized something about the greymon from the digimon adventure ova
<:KanadeSmug:688191203178840064>
it appear that alia is a tsundere
since I look at the comment  section where they have mixed opinion about those two show.
i might give gundam build fighter try and dive a try
Also, so after i finished build fighter.
yes she is
I can see that Reiji and Alia are gonna be shipped.
and also I see you there sunrise, you cheeky bastard
alia smile is just the cutest shit ever

bruh
also Lori and China are just cute dork.
.the fight scene in gundam build fight are pretty damn good.
and it has a very evangelion vibe-
the whole episode 1 is a trippy one
I watch the first episode and holy shit the animation quality is fucking good
time for searching clip of it
I wonder what is that anime.
ah.
uhh..i don't get it.
ho? what dis
my heart
and live together
And feel like it not gonna do great.
okay it really does look a lot like shirabe
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
wait..rance already has an animation adapation..
What I mean is that
it way too different from sokou musume
Lbx girls isn't really soukou musume-
I found out there was a digimon tamer cd drama that was made in 2018.
also chika is adorable
They are obviously fall in love on each other but they just can't admited because of how they would think each other from themself
<:MikuHype:688429715676987428>
shirogane and kaguya just make me "GODDAMNIT CONFESS ALREADY-"
And boy the character are enjoyable.
I was so used to average high school setting and student but it a nice change.
I did not expected the character and the school are actually wealthy and richy.
it was crazy as fuck.
I watch the first episode and wow
im gonna watch kaguya-sama love is war.
Hmm....
but It's did not reflect the lbx their were based on.
i like them as their own thing.
LBX Girls design is eugh.
the new anime LBX girls and soukou musume are complete seperate.
Except it doesn’t look shounen.
then again, the anime is really wild.
it a SoL
with a normal life.
Cuz shirogane look like he was just an average dude.
but then again, they always spent each time in the council room.
also, it pretty forgettable that the character are rich kiddie.
Yes
because he was loud?
because chika always bring the funny stuff.
although, chika is at again with her moment.
<:MariaNo:672658725986762764> boi kaguya, that dirty for making shirogane looking gulity.
And also Kaguya play dirty
He so energize
I love the narrator
I watch Kaguya-sama episode 2 and it will really wild
<:KanadeSmug:688191203178840064>
I see, moar good gay stuff
best girl
Tbh, I like their relationship together.
also, the scene where Kaguya riding on Shirogane bike is pretty cute.
Like the part where they talk about the lewd thing is just so funny
but holy, Kaguya is so innocent-
the first half is really awkward and rather wild.
I watch episode 3 of kaguya-sama
that look better than the chogokin gaogaigar.
wha-
how-
A storyboard made by a software development company.
WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS FUCKERY-
atleast the voice acting is nice.
I check ex-arm episode 1 and it pretty bad
isn’t there an anime of a dude meet a shy gamer girl.
I mean like, fucking what-
rent-a-girlfriend is that one manga that make me question about the author thought.
I mean funimation is always shit
dear god, it became a reality
https://youtu.be/wE6FJSvPvl8
vore
kill it
IM LITTERALLY LOOKING AT A CUTE THIN VERSION OF CHRIS-
The resemble is uncanny.
ah
Eh...does anyone remember this anime.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_55h5GBM2Y
<:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
<@!486087033652248576>
but it's ehh...
i mean they are okay
dragon ball fighting scene are not my favorite
except dragon ball is just repeat the same thing over and over and over again to the point where i wanna die for real--
due to it humour
assault lily felt like an 2000 or 2010 anime
good shit
yes
I like animated starscream.
good point
Uh...
<:ShirabeFear:696380146248319066>
No offenese.
that one is worst than rwby v1 and 2 animation
ex-arm
It does.
More work and polished
CGI anime can be good depend on the budget.
I’m not homo enough for this-
no
Zenbu-
that tickle my brain
A bunch of guys thristing after a guy
i mean issei is not bad by no mean but-
if I'm being honest, I would watch High School DxD but...Issei make me back away from it.
good
but it better than the usual harem trope
Yuri Harem is a rarity
then it seem.
Why is it so hard to make one girls liking one guy.
It became a thing with these harem anime/manga.
in many way.
I never like the trope, it just so saturated
I can share your sentiment.
EX-Arm is interesting with the story but I can’t say that the story doesn’t do much with the horrendous animation.
it better off to read EX-ARM manga instead
Finding a "Good” harem anime is be like...
take that premise in a comedic way
techinically it a love triangle-
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
robo harem
Funny idea.
*cough*
The idea of having multiple girls is a paradise to some "men"
Disgusting
Hmmm, I guess im being biased toward harem trope
that is almost legit look like dukemon x-antibody
but a figma kumoko
that look less like a nendoroid
oh right.
Rance...
I swear, it hard to tell it 3d or 2d
to the point where it getting annoying.
but it like shoving your favorite anime into someone throat.
I get it, the gal is smexy as fuck and thicc
but the constant fanservice is rather annoying.
I still like azur lane for what it is..
but it opening theme is just banger
the last azur lane wasn’t so great since it pretty much just there to promote the game.
that seem better.
<:MariaNo:672658725986762764>
but then again, azur lane still need a cohorent story
azur lane need more the wholesome moment
damn jeez-
and loli
azur lane where battleships are thicc mf waifu.
ah yes,
Also I really like shoutmon
I really like the xros wars digimon cuz hey they pretty cool.
what kind of drug is even beyblade lore is...
...jesus christ play beyblade...
that the question
wait is she really horny?
the ceo of azur lane is a woman.
yes...
but i did not expected that
so...i always thought that the ceo is a man.
goddamn.
nevermind im not crazy.
like seriously, I hope im just crazy
and also another thing is that almost all the girl are like big booby and thicc thigh
eh sound cool to me.
I give up <:ShemHaWhat:727010581722431499>
lmao
you can’t be serious about a toy being a relic-
no
god...
ORA ORA ORA ORA-
https://tenor.com/view/kasumi-love-live-love-live-kasumi-punch-anime-punch-gif-19285337
you joking right zenbu.
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
right..
ex-arm make me feel awful for the author to see their work turn into a complete utter trash.
since it has more going for the characters
well i heard the manga is a lot better than the anime.
but i love the design.
Okay...oddly enough, this digimon only appear in a manga

dear god dude-
damn, whoever design godzilla is either has a thigh fetish at some point
https://tenor.com/view/damn-boi-he-thick-anthony-gif-13869893
yes veri thicc
I GIGGLE LIKE A GODDAMN IDIOT
GODZILLA IS THICC AS FUCK
https://tenor.com/view/wheeze-laugh-gif-14359545
i mean literally shoutmon fused almost every digimon in the entire digital world.
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
Shoutmon x7 Superior mode is really epic

I mean im at chapter 3 but nene is really different compare to the anime counterpart-
woah okay nene is really different
and wow it rather different from the anime.
im reading the xros wars manga.
RWBY has the worst shipping side.
the fanbase is the reason why I don’t bother touching mainstream anime.
yep.
oh yeah.
how bad really?
it total acid trip
don’t get me started with BNHA fanbases
I was never into mainstream anime like BNHA, demon slayer, AOT or anything.
I would have love to watch it if it wasn’t for the popularity it get
like geah.
Madoka should’ve been just an anime with a small fanbase.
GaoGaiGar.
I think i might know a show.
I mean i watch mecha show but i never watch super robot
funny thing I never watch a single super robot anime
you gonna be depressing
if you willing to watch evangelion.
YESS BUT THE THING IS.
AAAAAAAA
aaa
AAAA
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
NANIIIO

IS GFL GETTING AN ANIME?
WAIT HOLD UP
why there a warner brother logo?
wait...
since ugh..
I think i just feel like i have nothing to say anymore about rwby
anyway as for rwby.
<:ChrisHappy:660870796696223744>
I like haru, chubby boi
it good.
but I watch accel world
since i never watch it
idek how to make opinion about it
SAO is...
<:MariaNo:672658725986762764>
fuck you movie
too bad it die too early
it has.
i love the black and orange color
obsidian fury is awesome.
and the kaiju.
I like Uprising mecha design
and it looking good.
we getting a pacific rim anime
but hey
Godzilla fandom is actually the worst thing cuz just don’t stop sucking goji dick a lot
i like anime gorl with fang
fang.
I like sopmod.
ro?
bleh..nevermind..
<:HibikiTired:422925410490253313>
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
are you doubting me
I mean the game is rather f2p friendly unlike fgo.
the Doctor in arknights is plain badass.
Arknights and GFL does has good story.
really.
Azur lane anime was animated by a very recent animation studio that was still new at the time:
no...
just because it a gacha game doesn’t mean it gonna be bad.
some Gacha game has good story, arknights and GFL and genshin.
<:MariaNo:672658725986762764>
milli i hate you
https://tenor.com/view/anime-crying-kid-boy-sad-gif-4952247
WHERE ARKNIGHTS
WHY GFL OUT OF ALL GACHA GAME
fuck off
you telling nian was voice by the one and only aoi yuki.
wait what-
no-
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
because she literally the reason of my username.
Amiya is my favorite which is very damn obvious.
I do enjoy arknights character a lot.
im sorry but fucking wha-
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
uh...
you can call rwby an anime
pretty much.
I like western show like infinity train.
I mean calling avatar an anime is a stretch.
but sucks we don’t get a tf2 anime.
but wow I don’t expected a dota anime.
not the fact it dota or that.
Well im disappointing.
as in valve dota?
Dota?
wait hold the fuck up
this video is pretty haunting.
https://youtu.be/YmWo2zG99e4
the only feeling i felt when watching the anime is that
im still confused
yes
and i still had no idea what is happening
I watch all the episode..
I mean her face pretty much say it
and somewhat dead inside.
Less sociable and the quiet girl.
she is rather...how do I describe.
I like lain.
i believe the story is complex but hard to understand.
it really is trippy.
and you betcha
it freaky as hell
and i had no idea what is even going on
I finished episode 1
even tamer.
I can tell.
it felt very evangelion
Jesus im watching episode 1 and it hella trippy.
Serial Experiments Lain
Also I have a recommend anime for you to watch.
yes you do.
It just more accurate to the source material
I don't know why would they be worry?
kid can be naive and dumb
I mean...he a kid...
Also shinji doesn't even know what the fuck happen after being sealed in that box.
it techinically his fault.
in the second flim.
The reason.
techinically the rebuild felt like the world being reset.
I mean it fucked up.
Let not forget that shinji main mecha is literally ||his mom.||
to pilot the eva
I don't understand why nerv use children
Shinji is a realistic character.
as I was saying.
confusion and asking myself if im even real
although, it could be anything than just that.
Internet Addiction.
I just figure out what serial experiment lain might be about..
yes.
The only princess movie that i actually care.
I really like brave.
so it worh to know the past of our forgettable fish
because we didn’t know much about dory past.
yep.
for a long time
Shinji just wanted to see his dad after abandoning him
it not that easy.
but EoE...
Evangelion is about escapism.
**bruh**
that movie is ptsd endusing.
those old anime artstyle
the main protag is borderline funny.
demon king academy is decent
I still thinking watch good but so trashy anime
I haven't watch an isekai anime for a long while.
<:MariaBully:689614085452464318>
I still want a new YuYuYu anime!
what that supposed to be mean.
I can understand why
because there no digimon partner
he does give not a fuck if your a mega digimon or not.
Masaru is a fucking chad
Frontier is interesting because of the concept of 10 ancient warrior.
**how pity**
AND Metalgreymon get a petty metal claws.
RizeGreymon is a chad compare to the virgin Metalgreymon.
OR WHERE TAMER-
I am the only one think wargreymon and metalgarurumon is rather overrated?
You could watch it in youtube for free.
well Yuki Yuna is a Hero is the title of the anime
Kaiser Greymon and Magna Garurumon deserve more love than they should.
but anywho.
I love gatchmon
Appmon is my favorite thing.
<:MariaNo:672658725986762764>
but toei being toei...they shove appmon in the digimon universe.
but the worst part about Appmon is that it's supposed to be it own thing instead of being connected to digimon in someway.
I also like Appmon because the concept a digital being come from an app.
Gunmon is the example of the designer going crazy
It an excuse to design crazy shit
but they didn’t do much variety other than looking something like a real animal
while pokemon has good design.
That what make me love digimon than pokemon.
I love these digimon design a lot.

What about MagnaGarurumon?
I mean...it a very greymon like
a fuking big motherfucking sword
I mean he got a super robot-like design
EmperorGreymon is objectively better than Wargreymon

I love her
Kotone is superior to Yui
and guess what

And Nene has a little sister instead of Yui
he an idiot but a good boi.
I love the manga taiki.
however the manga does handle taiki very well and gave him a backstory for why he became the way he is.
when you can just say xros or just x
like why time?
SHOUTMON TIME (insert number)
I hate how they make shoutmon say
because mikey or taiki is a gary stu in the anime.
it was.
it a love letter to digimon
You should read the manga
i love shoutmon and his digifusion form
Xros Wars as an anime sucks as fuck
but it doesn't have to be the same formula.
inazuma eleven 👀
90s anime?
Ooo.
<:SerenaSmile:672908572774105109>
kanna is pure bun
Elma is best girl
The poor kid.
it does.
she look a like a child in the manga.
her design in manga is a little different in the anime.
Yeah, she probably a nice character.
I can understand why she look like a minor because the artstyle but no child irl looking like an anime grill.
Short women with big boobs exist-
you gotta kidding me?
but Llulu?
funny enough, they never complain Quetzalcoatl design for having bigger boobies.
Llulu neat.
I don’t even know her name.
Honestly, I won’t be surprise if that also honna happen to the new character for dragon maid S2.
it basically the uzaki situation all over again.
in other word
Also people in twitter now complain about the design of the character for season 2.
watching the trailer of dragon maid season 2 gave me a nostalgia memory from season 1.
because once the character talk and the subtitle appear then disappear about a few second
the youtube subtitle on rayearth are annoying
okay...
but that the wackiest part of anime.
hikaru is 14 but look a lot more like a teen
wow...
i mean 90s anime artstyle is always wacky good
also...rayearth artstyle looking good.
thank the god that these old anime are on youtube.
well i atleast watching the first episode of rayearth on the youtube.
a niche anime that deserve more love.
it like gear
but it might sound pretty good
that sound cheesy
I haven’t watch an 90s anime since evangelion.
But titan are complete opposite-
when they are 100% organic
how the fuck titan are mecha-
That is sound bullshit
I like madoka antagoinist appearance
Can i sent an image?
hmmm...4.5/5?
AND  IT WING BEING A BIG OL SWORD-
IT A STRAIGHT ROBO DRAGON WITH GUN AS IT ARM-
I think Killer Droid is my favorite thing
But hey we atleast got something like Killer Droid.
and there was even an model for it
Killer Droid is pure badass
Danball Senki is pretty wack.
im very sorry-
Im still imagining decade actor being a vtuber
A man can do loli voice.
it like SAO
So cuteee~
<:MikuGay:336656810788388864>
good
and talk about shark
forget about mecha for a minute
they don’t have meat
Although...to me franxx are just mecha.
not even issei be this fucking dumb.
I find ichika too dense for my taste..
That annoying piece of shit
houki
Oh god
Tabane is the only good character-
I DISLIKE ICHIKA ALOT-
I stg i couldn't watch the first episode without ichika in my face.
I only like Infinite Stratos because the mecha and not the shitty character.
I only like digimon xros wars bcuz of the fight scene and the digixros sequence
plus infinite stratos sucks ass.
Infinite Stratos and Digimon Xros Wars
I have a few bad anime I could think.
but watching team rwby making dumb desicion make me wanna slap my face
Oof
Rwby is good but volume 4 > 8 are utter trainwreck of a mess-
I wanna be honest with rwby.
anyway.
Oh my god
Oddly enough, i only familiar with akame ga kill  by fanfiction crossover with kr.
Can i say about my love and hate about rwby-
but good in a cringedt way
I have a gulity pleasure of reading fanfic that is so terrible
Eh i can understand that
Uhh...i don’t understand-
**that one doesn't count**
this didn't happen in decade
more like-
and i can help but liking it
those are very gay
goddamn
but i think it look pretty good.
X4b is a favorite of mine and yes it basically bunch of digimon glue together.
I always like shoutmon digifusion form.
and don't remember that much
I only watch part 1
in my head.
Fubuki voice.
the only thing i heard is...
Lex-Lex..
huhuhu~
<:HibikiSmug:672655850518609940>
lex-lex is gay for maria
stg mean swear to god
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
smh
i mean i stg this anime has a fanfiction crossover with kamen rider kiva in ff.net
**it pretty damn horny**
**yeah it is**
is that it basically hentai but without the sex scene-
the only thing i know about testament
I do think argomon from saver movie is techinically more threatening because he litteraly just make earth go post-apoc.l
You know, look at the Argomon from saver movie and the one from adventure 2020
I like all the character.
I mean they interaction is very cute
and the wholesome is just the character interaction and how they understand each other feeling.
Weirdly by the fact that there always a moment that just gave you a wtf moment
I would call Miss Kobayashi Dragon Maid is weirdly wholesome
the design and color are just pop
I like Eosmon
**still mecha**
This is why mecha with harem is what i called terrible idea.
Believe me, it hard to watch without this moronic dense of a main character APPEAR IN MY FACE-
Pretty much why I just couldn't watch the first episode of infinite stratos without looking at Ichika stupid ass presence
*Yes*
*if only the infinite stratos has better character, well Tabane is the only one i like and almost everyone are insufferable*
I like the design
Just give me infinite stratos mecha
although Im getting tired of gundam.
Honestly they do look like armor suit.
wat?
Those IS look like they were made for Military usage
since if we talk realistic here
I swear the IS look like it design for male-
like how are those not weighing them down?
and arms
I mean look like at those huge legs
I like Infinite Stratos design, cool looking but also bulky.
Tabane is much more entertaining than the main character.
IS themself and Tabane.
Although there two thing like about IS
than the anime
Im not sure if the LN are any better
Laura is fine but damn she dumb-
I don't have any real interest on gundam but I wanna say if the show is good then i can give it a watch.
is 00 any good?
pretty much
death.
war.
gundam.
but what I did not realized just how bland the character in this reboot.
I did watch a couple of episode before.
You know I had something to say about Digimon Adventure 2020 reboot.
**you shitting me, right** <:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
I swear i saw that same scene in a clip of gundam x
Make more sense than fire, since it's doesn't fit in the overall opening
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozwP5fknWn8 For some reason, the Digimon Frontier dub intro is more catchier than Fire by Koji Wada
also SingularGoji has a weird jaws
I’m more of hype for the anime over the GvK
DAMN GODZILLA SP TRAILER IS GOOD-
~~sorry not sorry for that joke~~
this is when perry visit in japan.
those eyes-
I mean come on look at how wide it is.
SP godzilla has a wide ass mouth
the anime was directed by the director of blue excorcist.
studio orange ofc.
This new godzilla was animated by the same studio who made beastar and land of lustrous.
it own thing and had nothing to do with the polygon picture godzilla anime
**THE** godzilla anime, yes
Well Tabane is the only character that I can amuse and laugh with.
*yes*
The only character in IS that i like the most.

We could talk about it, you wanted to
I swear, otacross probably have a lot of money to make  three of his lbx
Perfect ZX3 design is probably my favorite
oh yeah, i forgot about that
even though it one time concept but for cry sake, atleast have another lbx that can combine
Although it kinda sucks it the only time when the concept of LBX combiner hasn't been use that much
although, i bet sigma orbis is borderline powerful in the psp game
for a combining lbx
Although I think Sigma Orbis is pretty good.
but i really like odin
before my dumb child brain decide to destroy it and break it-
I used to own an odin kit
or a different mecha in general
I mean Dot Phasor could pass off as a gundam-
I like the Wars lbx.
and killer droids is not meant to be a toy to begin with-
it does look good
Honestly i might take my word back.
wars is one of those anime that is bad in a good way
Although...the cgi for the lbx themself doesn't age pretty well.
I don't know arata seem fine to me.
don't kill me for that mel.
<:TsubasaDere:768545990495961129>
although i really like wars.
for real
the anime industry should really fix this issue
jesus fuck
and yet they have to deal with the nightmare.
these animator put sweat and soul, heart effort for the anime
someone gave these poor animator and producer a goddamnit vacation
but this is bad
pretty worn out and tired
I know that people work in japanese animation studio tend to be-
this is legit hell for the animator
jesus fuck
twice?

Dot Blastrizer is my favorite lbx since I actually own one before
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
translated japanese into english are pain
or to make thing simple
HE BACK HE BACKKKK
VARAN THAT FLYING BOI
also VARAN SHOWN IN THE OPENING
i swear to god seeing these those cameo never fail to make me feel so happy
I wanna cry
MY HEART I FUCKING CANT-
the opening is BANGER

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LmUrOXKHZiM YOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
no?
i watch it in 9anime
also the first episode of s.p has been subbed.
it still sort of big but it has a small size than the colorful rodan.
It not cute
the rodan that look like classic rodan is actually small
not giant, but it bigger than yun
because this one is much bigger
i mean there are two different type of rodan in the anime
it my favorite
I really love this design <:HibikiWow:738172615453048912>
https://twitter.com/kaijunewsoutlet/status/1377846298804690944?s=21
I have watch singular point episode 2 and it was good.
yes but it also good for newcomer.
yes
probably not
it also funny in godzilla singular point episode 2 that people make merch out of  radon
*yes*
<:KanadeSmug:688191203178840064>
comic sans is good
I LIEK RODANS
YES?
So many rodan
https://youtu.be/iF8qgmUh-aM
dynazenon and dynarex just look good in every angle.
Studio orange had surely improve their cgi skills.
it look very so cel-shaded and i love cel-shading artstyle
i really love the cgi
OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOH
https://twitter.com/KaijuNewsOutlet/status/1381785088074133506
and tell me how you think about this rodan
look at this rodan

lmao
also the titanosaurus look a like is not titanosaurus but it another godzilla
but to each their own.
I don’t like it a lot.
because showa manda is just a borderline dragon
because it better than his previous incarnation design
i also like manda new design
https://twitter.com/kaijunewsoutlet/status/1382713136344670209?s=21
here some explaination about the rodan in episode 3.


because SP titanosaurus has godzilla dosal fin
people also speculating that titanosaurus is godzilla
but who know.
well there are theory that he will revive at somepoint
also episode 3 gave us some explaination for those smaller rodan.
we just had to wait for the right episode for him to appear.
he will.
it has a torrent in nyaa si but it not subbed yet
also episode 4 for s.p has been aired in japan.
yes
yes


not a fishing pole
that a bow lol
love this rodan

https://twitter.com/I_Amiya_/status/1382882824601030658

https://streamable.com/kvu7ov
titano has been always and always a peaceful kaiju that has no hostility toward humanity.
although i had said this to people in twitter and youtube that it not really titanosaurus.
like how the titanosaurus look a-like is actually godzilla first form.
which make sense because in S.P the kaiju are based on ancient paint.
to me he look like an oni because the way how his design look.
also....suranga has no resemble to gabara..
gabara always been just a kid imagination.
This is a new kaiju on it own.
Not really.
<@!468591607332208641> okay so this gabara-like monster isn’t gabara, it a new monster name Sarunga
yeah sound worst than just one.
okay so there isn't just one but three manda
<@!468591607332208641>
https://streamable.com/mnh13m
SoL is usually having the character doing normal thing in their normal life
Well sometimes they do, sometimes they not
but nobody watch Dynazenon for the plot.
cuz the plot doesn’t explain much
I focus more on the character than the plot
I forget the plot
Considering SSSS.Gridman is a sequel to the original gridman.
but the question is if Dynazenon is the same Dyna Dragon.
I think it a good redesign of Dynadragon
I like the mecha itself, Dynazenon
Yeah sometimes you wording just confused me
that how thing work
I mean it a tokusatsu anime.
Huh...
also the conversation in the voice drama is quite natural
Yes but please just give the damn anime a chance.
can you link it
I mean i don’t understand what they saying
yes it is.
episode 18 has a lot of connection to Gauma and Dynazenon
I watch episode 18 of the original gridman toku show
it all make sense in episode 3 of dynazenon.
holy fuck
You know i never noticed there something something wrong with homura
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
NEW YUYUYU ANIME?
there a sequel to barefoot gen?
wait...barefoot gen 2
and use bullying as a way to get his attention.
the fact this is the same author who made a cute teasing gal who sucks at telling her feeling at her senpai.
I don’t know how to response to this
and all i can think is "what the fuck"
I literally check every single of nanashi hentai.
WHAT THE FUCK
what in the fuck
**Jesus fuck**
Name...please.
Holy fuck ||Nagatoro is such an abusive bitch in the webcomic||
I just learn that Nagatoro, was even more worse in the original webcomic.
will ya
*fuck off*
Feeling anxious and prefer to be alone is pretty relatable.
for some reason, Naoto is so me
and it pretty good.
I watch nagatoro episode 1
anime is made for fun.
you don’t need take it seriously considering that.
but it fun.
Like how eromanga sensei is the best trash.

Magical girls are just tokusatsu in disguise
cuz the whole premise sound like a tokusatsu plot

Im wondering if this anime is any good though.
joke aside

HAVE YA WATCH SP-
That Gauma.
he is crazy
Lol
Isn’t tanya a dude at one point-
fanfiction crossover...
I only know fate through fanfiction-
because he has a thing making the begin look lightheart and the second arc that where shit goes down-
yes.
funny because it was wrote by the same writer
<:SakuyaSweat:634394711758733312>
how the fuck is gaim comparable to revue starlight-
which is a huge mistake
that like asking for an agruement-
then how the fuc-
IT A PLOT THAT IS RARE AS FUCK-
huge load of hypocrite.
I smell a hypocrite
~~Yes~~
hey atleast we got good waifu and gud kaiju fight
although Godzilla always has sci-fi but SP take that sci-fi up to the level.
Heavy Sci-Fi per say.
hard science is good
Im glad you finish, what is your entire thought on it?
Also the aquatic godzilla was named as ||godzilla aquatilis||
Angy boi is a doggy
<:GenjuroLaugh:689563633516150872>
I could start with tropical and tropical rouge
ah okay
well...which one i should watch.
Should i watch precure?
Yes
considering she a bloody mermaid-
or lil fish
Laura is a cute but snarky lil gremlin.
and....Laura is my favorite, the scene where laura didn’t react to manatsu being all excited is funny
I like Manatsu, she remind me of gentaro from fourze
the first episode atleast
okay i watch precure tropical
SINGULAR POINT IS OUT IN NETFLIX BABY
<a:OSMilkSip:819935635031719937>
you cannot change my mind.
Sango and Manatsu are 100% gay
Okay so...I have watch episode 2 of tropical rouge.
Laura Smug is my fetish

AND HAT-
Cure Coral is my favorite design because it fluffy
I watch episode 3 of tropical rogue
<a:OSMilkSip:819935635031719937>
Godzilla Singular Point is the only anime I watch is heavy Sci-Fi.
Let me think of a single anime...
Do you guys ever watch an anime with heavy Sci-Fi element?
wait is that Hololive-
I love Nagatoro since I read the manga before the anime was a thing.

<a:MikuQuake:605209236082786355>
And somehow my word turn this into a sci-fi conversation.
Uh huh......
And also Godzilla S.P  is the only anime I would love to recommending but hmmm I have doubt if anyone here into the Kaiju Genre maybe a few.
Have this.
because they don’t pay me for nothing
Well fucking no
<:SquintingGoofy:658538780231204897>
**that pretty much my job**
im just acting.
Im not really angry per say.
What is this convo anymore
because I can!
because that statment is wrong
n o
YOU JUST MESSING WITH ME ATP-
NO
NO
<a:angeryping:686425511278149634>
THIS IS JUST MOCKERY
Neptunia is just fantasy.
IT A META GAME-
Bullshit
Infinite Stratos is not bad by no mean, it just medicore at best.
and i have a bone to pick with that anime.
I heard IS.
Azure Lane is indeed a sci-fi
uh...
no cap
Persona is just fantasy-
aw
want sum frozen chicken
cypher
Nevermind.
Iris Heart more like-
Plutia and Iris Heart is a polar opposite.
OBJECTION!
a loveable dumbass per say
Then again neptune is always a dumbass-
because their hdd form are just alter ego.
more like alter ego.
To be fair Neptunia is just meta.
<a:MikuQuake:605209236082786355>
THE CPU ARE NOT EVEN HUMAN-
yes
Dark magical girls are traumatizing.
magical girls genre has expand more than just frilly dress.
that just the basic.
ofc
Magicial Girl are basically normal human girl who take power from another world
||the good ending in the OG Neptunia, the goddess dead because they pretty much give up their goddess power.||
that is depend.
I think the original ps3 neptunia seem more serious compare to the rebirth.
<:MomijiStare:838731469672677386>
again who the hell take neptunia seriously-
<:smugkuu:791478001496752180>
Neptune is gonna get lewd by plutie poo
a subgenre of mecha.
Azur Lane are mecha girls.
Mecha Musume
more like...
so it fine for now
But they probably still working on it.
Well, i think it still has that feature.
I forgot this anime exist
SETON!
share system is an odd one-
isn’t that just super sentai-
Ah, I see.
I will save that later
That would do
Hmmmm...
||Okay thank hubby, that be helpful||
||Hmm...so chapter 31 is where im gonna continue?||
It not like im gonna understand the context.
Oh right.
can you tell me what chapter of the manga where rhe anime left off, hubby?
I have a lot of shit to watch
should i read the manga or the anime?
Do I wanna know..?
this isn’t helping
<:MariaScared:672584661125431299>
||that not helping||
RIGHT??
it probably not suffering right?
Uh...why you looking at me like that?
<:SakuyaSweat:634394711758733312>
there will be some kind of suffering here-
I feel like if i touch land of lustrous
Imagine phos having harem of rock
ho?
<:DoremySmug:689958198039281782>
Hmmm the gem in land of lustrious does look like rock candy.
So far all the main four has complete
Yep.
||Hmmmm well considering PreCure are way more kid friendly||
||Gud||
||I hope she ain’t gonna die||
||Not joking, red hair,  being much older than the other.||

Oki doki, i watch episode 4 of tropical rouge.
**Bloody hell, that sentai references in episode 7 of Tropical Rouge**
<:OSwoww:566293157101305857>
https://youtu.be/-knKC9uAJUA I found something
Sound like a typical isekai reincarnation anime-
Alright... Grimgar on my save list.
Hmmm i will save those
Yes
Can we have an isekai anime that has an actual interesting lore on the actual isekai itself-
for an isekai anime to say the least
Kazuma is a very funny protagonist
Kazuma is funny but um.
Really? I thought it seem common.
Video game Isekai.
yes
I noticed there this trend of having game mechanic in a isekai-
Slime is just slime.
I would like to think Kumoko having a ps1 graphic
Nah i seen better cgi model than that-
<:MariaScared:672584661125431299>
Jesus christ, that goddamn cg model for Kumo is pretty damn bad.
I would love to watch Kumoko if it wasn’t for it horrendous cgi-
it a 50/50 kind of thing.
Ugh power fantasy in isekai is boring as heck.
Hm guess i will save Honzuki.
NGNL is colorful as shit
<:HibikiWow:738172615453048912>

Aesthetically pleasing and colorful.
especially Merc, I love her design so much.
but the main highlight is the character, they are fun and likeable.
it pretty good
Okay, so I watch this anime called Merc Storia and I have to say.

Well...the character are just people who just get involved themself with something they shouldn't.
Are you sure? because to me, the character has a more natural feeling to them with the dialogue and the interaction.
but I still think the character in SSSS.Gridman are good as Dynazenon character.
SSSS.Dynazenon actually has a better character writing compare to SSSS.Gridman.
That doesn’t look like a 15 year old-
what do you mean cope?
that look like an 18 or 20 year old to me.
that alot of gatari
ah i see.
I KNOW-
Im still confused...with this design choice.
i cannot take it seriously with the crotch laser.
okay that look better.
Basically....that?
Why the crotch, couldn’t make it at the chest?
out of all place.
why the crotch
IM FUCKING DyinG
**WHEEZE**
LMAO
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721> say what-
<:TsubasaIgnite:672861877407318047>
HOW IS THIS EVEN MAKE SENSE-
How the fuck is that a beam sword.
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
Basically a giant ass plasma cannon?
Question, where the hell is the leg.
Anyway, I think this magical girls anime has a unique premise from other magical girls anime
which mean he pretty much own the entire planet.
he terraform the entire planet
wasted potiental.
whoopie do.
OH WELP-
it was literally bullshit powerful
literally bullshit stronger
nah not you think.
which im confused on why they decide to make it a damn city?
it never fight, it was a city for the rest of the movie.
Yes
yeah it was utter bullshit

Anime Mechagodzilla.
You wanna know the most cluttered mecha design?
<:HibikiSmug:672655850518609940>
You cannot fight the 70’s B O I
basically the og getter one with more detail.
But I like Shin Getter one design.
But personally im not gonna question on Getter Robo strange ass combine.
Im not sure if you familiar with this, do you guys know Twin Princess of Wonder Planet?
Although im currently watching a magical girls show that star recommend me.
Im literally going insane with getter bullshit combine mechanism.
But im still confused on HOW THE FUCK GETTER ROBO EVEN COMBINE-
I planned to watch Getter Robo armageddon.
Okay that save my sanity.
I see..
why it has to be so long..?
~~Yes and thank to you, i love it~~
but the main protag are twin sister which im pretty sure that is totally uncommon right?
it almost like a slice of life kind of thing.
or other magical girls with action.
unlike Pretty Cure or Nanoha
ah i see, what make this magical girls show stand out is that it less action oriented.
no...?
the what?
the whole plot of this anime is basically a twin princess sister trying to save a star or sun thing that is dying and it will be consume by darkness.
yes.
god that is hype af
GETTAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH-ONE!
but he can be a pure badass
and I love him a lot, he a dorky and lovable boi
Yes he did
because he is rather determined to save the earth.
Well...im kinda glad they go for Musashi.
It hurt a lot.
why he has to DIE-
Goddamn, i love that dude
<:KirikaCry:674720015047720961> Musashi...
especially musashi, what an absolute chad
the character are just lovable fucker and the story are just so good.
it was so amazing and I love the fuck out of it.
I finish the getter robo manga.
*This face*

im now on chapter 9
because holy crap those face are meme worthy
also the face that hayato give me a laugh
Jesus christ Hayato
<:ShirabeFear:696380146248319066>
STRONK ROBO
Ho boi, he a stronk.
what does the actual shin dragon look like?
Ohhhh.
I don't like shin dragon design...
the first time i heard this, I feel pumped
YESSSSSSSSSSSSS
I mean basically getter-one if he has a daughter.
I mean getter robo does has a gijinka version
I mean...Getter Robo is gonna be insane in many way.
she sound dangerous.
oh boi
as getter standard.
that sound super over the top.
Okayyyy-
what is that mean.
mahjong..?
Research ya meannn-
<:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
<:MikuLaugh:688429715676987428>
why the thicc ass thigh
Okay what
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
the girls with abs is looking hot
WAIFU GETTER?
<:MikuBliss:336657233712513024>
yeah he about a good boy as musashi
I am currently reading G.
the getter ray hit me in the heart.
Nova, please..
okay that sound funny without context.
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
slowly but not fulky.
Gundam has slowly turn itself into a super robot...
Real robot is cool but they can be hella boring sometimes.
Super robot is much more fun.
STTGL is just...flexing
fuck logic, JUST GO BRRR.
Super robot is cooler than real robot.
sound fitting to me
with the name emperor
Basically Emperor is almost a god?
if im understanding this.
the very thing that is used for good is actually the evil?
so let me get straight..
So i read go and then shin?
ah okay...
Benkei is also a good boy like Musashi
the Hyakki empire is very cool but I like the dinosaur empire more.
it was pretty good as the first getter robo manga.
Okay i finished reading getter robo G.
Bang

<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
she is strange but she is an precious bean that deserve to be protect.
lain herself is likeable.
the action scene is top notch.
it a pretty good  getter robo anime.
I finished Getter Robo Amargeddon
definitely one of the best getter robo manga I ever read.
I finished reading Shin getter robo and it was amazing

god bless, he is beautiful
is the mecha itself
I think my favorite thing about Dynazenon.
everyone.
Since Gauma is the same mummy in the OG gridman.
was it the mummy episode?
I know.
I mean it a super robots.
DynaRex is also a cherry on the top
not only that he hate black people and mexican people but he hate japanese the most. He basically has the white supermacist attitude.
because he hate japanese people.
He call gou as yellow monkey
much worst.
wat do u mean?
becaue he more racist compare to the armageddon ova schwartz
But the manga just a giant explosion to your face.
y e s
because holy fuck it was batshit insane crazy
I think it gotta be my second favorite getter robo manga
I finish Getter Robo Go.
schwartz does come out as a complete racist piece of shit-
okay while reading getter robo go...
But Dynazenon does has drama but not in the most obnoxious way.
I would say no...
I like it a lot.
Although, a SRW anime would be banger.
RAIDA KICKU
It's called Crisis Girls..
There is one obscure manga that my twitter mutual show me.
Hmmm, have you read a manga that is very niche or obscure?
Since the Brave series doesn't have a connected timeline or universe which make thing easier for me.
We doomed
Please tell me...this is not some kind of a script for a live action one piece
what.
CHANGE GETTER EMEPEROR-1!
It look sexy
Man that getter emperor scene is fucking rad
<:ShirabePout:336656831978012712>
but I find it sastifying to listen
Im not sure about the sound effect.
That normal because it meant to be accurate to the manga.
I mean it's Getter, so why wouldn't you.
it’s worth it.
that one is basically Getter Robo Go but better
What about Neo?
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
Mel-Mel you forgot..Getter Robo Go.
Someone ripping off Getter Robo.
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
||I don't like forcing myself to read side material for the sake of a specific plot information||
there should be more disabled magical girl because it's pretty interesting.
because I like action and flashy stuff.
G and Build are my thing
That sound Fucked up-
You dingus dingul
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
That mean N O T H I N G
Hey hey <:HibikiFingerguns:688429715836502063> there nothing wrong with having character beautiful face showing to you
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158> Fenny, im pretty sure there always those cover.
<:GarieOhYeah:688429715769262187>
Solo expect it to be another Yuri LN.

Okay so I finished Da-garn last night and It was a blast.

Yukari is 17 year old.

F u m o
I mean it wouldn’t be touhou music if it has engrish
mhm
I mean...true but i think it better of that way.
There is a reason why Zun doesn’t want an anime adapation of touhou because he wanted to keep as an indie franchise.
I mean Touhou fanbase are so dedicated that they made their own anime.
Touhou fanbase has good ass music
y e s
it 4 am for meee
lemme sleep-
PERISH HERSEY
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
