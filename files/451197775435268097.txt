<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
hello again
hi DC how is life
I was here for a bit a long while ago
hi there
hiiiii new people
Made this and I'm quite proud of it
I have another thing I want to make but can‚Äôt because I don‚Äôt have a working laptop
Made this when I had a working laptop
*and I want that fucking kit*
It‚Äôs 2019
~~fr good job on both kits~~
gun dam
Gee Exia, how come Bandai lets you have so many kits
Oh hey something came in the mail
Time to raise some flags
personally though I can't get enough of it
fair enough
this kind of shit is the norm
it's the Gundam build series
Gundam Tryon 3
the Super Robot in question
they did this before and it was an actual Super Robot based on the ZZ Gundam
buddy it's a custom Gunpla
look at this thing
Jiyan Altron is a personal favorite and I'm happy the Altron was given to a better character than Wufei
Build Divers had some really good mobile suits
LET'S FUCKING GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
https://tenor.com/view/azur-lane-ayanami-missile-yell-scream-gif-13975692
> Gundam Planet has the HG Alteisen up for preeorder
because IBO is mega depression
that was kind of what I was going for
but I'd definitely use it for the v fin if I had it
that'd lock the joint in place
I'd rather not use plastic cement
Here‚Äôs another image because I feel proud of myself
So it just doesn‚Äôt have it
The tiny sticker you put on there got damaged
You might notice I didn‚Äôt show off it‚Äôs right shoulder
Also
it is a little old though so I expected some issues
still like the kit but god the waist and head is so rough
also his waist sucks
and atos
he is barb
HE IS DONE
https://twitter.com/AzureFrontline/status/1436529253231861760?s=20
It turns out I forgot a few parts so here he is complete
Exia sexy
anyway
especially the HG00 line
all in all I am really happy I built this kit, but I'm not getting anything from before 2010 for a while
and speaking of beam sabers, fuck bandai for not including any beam effects in this kit and giving us a nasty all white beam saber like come on
Oh and another complaint, this thing is a pain to display with all of it's accessories because of the GN Blades and their holsters
~~also I don't like the beam sabers on the back~~
seriously the arms help so much with holding them on
the torso was bad specifically because of the armor parts that go around the shoulders being on *ball joints* for some reason and they don't hold well at all
the head is a fuckton of really small parts, the eye sticker was hell to place on, and I actually forgot a part until after I finished the rest of the kit and it was really tough to put on
Specifically the head and torso
my only issue with the HG Exia was the build honestly
the GN Sword doesn't hold on too well, but it's not too bad if you're careful, and it'll at least stay on the arm if you grab it
seriously this thing holds together so well for something from *2008*
it was a bit more complex, and it's considerably more solid out of the box
this was honestly a much more fun build than Barbatos
Sexia is done
oh speaking of kits
I would too tbh
~~now build Quatre‚Äôs whole entourage~~
Hey the Maganac
And the GN sword
Exia progress update, arms, torso and head done
the Exia's blue marks super easily and I don't have an easy way of removing the marks
also another issue
true
... yeah I'm gonna get a QAN[T] for my next kit
from what I know tiny parts is an issue shared with the RG Exia too
decided to take a break and leave it for tomorrow
And it‚Äôs been a little frustrating so far
So I got an HG Exia kit for my birthday
Made Barbatos too white
Also I changed it to 1st form because the shoulders bugged me
Sidetrack but I decided to take some pictures and decided to mess with the only good one
I think it turned out nice
And make it a neat stabbing weapon
You can put the swords on the shield
god I need to get my hand on the HG Deathscythe
Gundam Edgescythe
neat
demstimy
I kinda want the Shia Quan[T] ngl
*I FUCKING BROKE GRAM BECAUSE I TWISTED IT IN A WEIRD WAY*
If anyone is wondering what this is
WHY DO I NOT KNOW HOW TO DO SHIT RIGHT
GODDAMNIT
FUUUUUUCK
I want my round child in its standard monoeye form
and it makes me feel immense psychological pain
it hasn't
~~and more Turn A kits but I say this as a shameless Kapool lover~~
Give me MG Gouf Custom 2.0 please Bandai
because this is a very different experience
what I have built has honestly been way more enjoyable than any Gunpla, except for maybe the Earthree
I haven't built much of Gallantmon but
Guess what I got with my Earthree?
This lad
As well as the Ex Valkylander, SD sticker hell aside
I‚Äôm heavily tempted to get either the Justice Knight or Aegis Knight
I liked it a lot too
Damn
Look at him all dressed up and sitting still for his photo!
He is quite the little gentleman yes
I'll build the armor later
And now he has his weapons
The small one is done
Guess what my local hobby shop had in stock
it'd probably have saved me the headache and myself from my own sheer inadequacy
given up on it when it broke in the fucking firstplace
I probably should've just fucking
Because I cannot work with super glue to save my life
I‚Äôve given up trying to repair Gram
Gallantmon situation
Update on the
neat
Only thing I don‚Äôt like about this kit is the feet and some parts of the cape
Honestly
even if it was fairly simple
this was a long build
god I am fucking *beat*
This was really fun, and a lot more simple than I expected
That little break aside though, Gallantmon is done
I could probably get some plastic cement at a hobby store and just fix it that way
I didn‚Äôt fucking think I‚Äôd be dumb enough to break something big like this but clearly I overestimated my own sheer fucking stupidity
I don‚Äôt
there's only like 3 colors on the Gouf Custom
To be fair
and only color inaccuracy is the hilt of the heat sword
the only two stickers are the mono-eye and the camera on the Machine Gun
<:TsubasaBliss:672861879000891432>
Also 
> TFW the Gouf Custom is all color separation
And with the MG
He is fully done now
Shot without the mini gun
~~also because I broke the swivel but I don't really care~~
also I built the head wrong so it's stuck looking sideways because I'm not taking that all apart again
Gouf Custom‚Äôs main body is done, taking a break before making its mini gun
*Arashi no Naka de Kagayaite plays in the distance*
‚ÄúThat‚Äôs right! Cower! Be afraid! Die knowing you lost to someone who truly knows how to use a Mobile Suit!‚Äù
because of course I can't
meaning I can't even correct my own fucking error
it also had the adverse side-effect of locking the waist armor in it's wrong state
it not only didn't work
and in my desperate state last night, I tried using plastic cement on the waist's ball joint to try and tighten it
I didn't put the waist armor on the right way
it was my own sheer fucking incompetence that ruined Cybuster
to no one's surprise
so as it turns out
I probably just got unlucky or just majorly fucked up somehow when building it
it's so bad
this kit is so unbelievably top heavy with a waist that literally can't support it
*I had to remove the side skirting and the fucking wings to do it*
just trying to get it set up decently on my shelf
20 minutes
I spent like
This was a horrid experience like holy fuck
Two things
One, voice reveal for people who‚Äôve never hear me before
Two, FUCK THIS KIT
it do be gucci
It‚Äôs so stupid and I adore it ü•∞
I love this thing so much
Wodom Pod done
mostly
I think the bleeding has stopped
I'm fine, btw
yeah
and well
I use a hobby knife for nub removal because I hate sandpaper
and I nearly chopped off a small part of my thumb removing a nub lol
I decided to start working on the HG Wodom Pod
so
Feel really bad about this in particular
I just
I appreciate the sentiments, but I'm still sad
why do I even try to do something when I'll just end up being bad at it
I fucked up the Barbatos's chest assembly before fixing it, I almost forgot exia's kneecaps and waist armor, I broke the fucking eye of my Gouf custom, and now just... all of this with the Cybuster
I swear to god, I shouldn't even be allowed to hold nippers, every single kit I've built has been marred by moments of my own sheer incompetence except for like, the Earthree
Ooooh
Sadly I can‚Äôt get it because money
God I fucking want 30 so badly
Overall like a 7/10 it was good but not great or the best
Other minor complaint is the utterly satanic amount of stickers on the rifles which I didn‚Äôt bother putting on because of how late it is and how obnoxious foil stickers are
Building it was repetitive because you have to make the same assembly twice and it‚Äôs so heavy tue Strike Freedom actually struggles to stand up under the sheer weight
The backback
Really liked the build for the most part but I do have one general complaint
Streedom is done
I may use my action base for this because I feel like it‚Äôd benefit from one
It‚Äôs been a fun build so far
In a more serious photo
Cringe-ass NaeNae Gundam
Main body is done!
Did another funny
Had a slight incident with the V fin but it should be fine now
Progress update
So I just discovered my local target carries gunpla
This is the Revive btw
Bought this at target
Swords
Status update: he is on the shelf and armed
Nice little shooting pose
On the ground anyway
I don‚Äôt have the backpack on it because it‚Äôs hard to pose with it on
Anyway Helios is done
You think I or my family have the money for a 3D printer
On today‚Äôs episode of ‚ÄòMy rapidly growing plastic addiction‚Äô
<@!782841825069236236> LEXI LOOK
***AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA***

*ahem*
Lookin good
Decided to put the boy in a new pose
Freedom be ballin tbh
I vastly prefer the Freedom, but they didn't have an HG Freedom so I took this
I don't *hate* it but I really don't like how the wings look
same honestly
Anyway here it is doin a cool
t-üÖ±Ô∏èose
And the HG Astray has amazing legs
All an HG needs for me to like it is good legs
Tho to be honest
They do use poly caps
And the clip for Gerbera Straight‚Äôs sheath is a bit loose but that‚Äôs also probably the side skirts being a bit floppy
My one tiny issue is that I have to be very gentle with it when posing
God this thing is so cool
Gundam Astray Drip Frame
~~also would it have killed Bandai to make an extra runner for the Gerbera Straight?~~
It‚Äôs been really fun so far it‚Äôs just so utterly foreign to me
I have literally never built an Astray I feel like I'm just starting Gunpla again-
okay so I started on the Astray Red Frame Inversion and I am shook
Wing Zero Sky done too
Mostly because I‚Äôve never built an Astray or Wing/Wing Zero
The other two I got were the Wing Zero Sky and the Red Frame Inversion
Had some money as a gift from grandparents so I went out and got stuff
Manlet Phenex
mostly because I just didn't think it looked good on my all white shelves
honestly I boxed the Helios last night
It‚Äôs just I had some not@so good times building the Command QANT
I like the Command and Helios a lot
Bad molds or something
I probably just got unlucky with like
Finally done 
Overall enjoyed the build
Fuck that waist tho
~~also the Helios can barely stand up anyway so what does it need those legs for lol~~
Here it is with the Helios‚Äôs legs for the sake of an actual progress photo, I‚Äôm currently waiting for liberally applied plastic cement to dry
One of the parts on the waist was probably just messed up for me so that could be why but still it‚Äôs annoying to say the least
It falls out with one somewhat strong shake
Poly Cap 9 is a *ball joint*
The way the front skirt armor is attached is dumb, it‚Äôs literally a piece of plastic on a goddamn poly cap 9 that goes into a square hole
ITS SO BAD
WAIST
Things
This
Fuck
Okay so update on the command quanta
The assembly was weird and I just don‚Äôt really dig the look of them that much
And to say some more I do not like the arms
A process to say the least
It‚Äôs been
I‚Äôm currently building the Command QANT
Along some other breaker battlogue stuff
Found this at a target in Alabama
EG Granddaddy America‚Äôs Ass version
I'm literally fucking braindead
I'm already the dumbest person on earth
oh wait
it's like the second anything goes above the size of a standard HG I just become the dumbest person on earth
The MG Deathscythe Hell is staying in its box for now until I feel like frustrating myself trying to fix the active cloak
I did not think my first MG would go this badly but I proved myself wrong through sheer fucking incompetence yet again
I‚Äôm not trying to fix the active cloak anymore
Fuck this
Why can‚Äôt I do anything right
Fuck my life man
All because I was confused on one step super early in the build of them
I built the entire goddamn Active Cloak wrong *and didn‚Äôt even notice until I was done*
Final progress update for now
He has legs now
Progress update on the boy
the boy‚Ñ¢Ô∏è.............
she's had enough
Hurtscythe Heck says hi
That reminds me
Well 2 and some change
This took 3 days lmao
RG QANT done
All of them
End product is a liiiiitle finicky but it‚Äôs mostly just normal HG jank like not so great waists and arms popping out if you aren‚Äôt careful but the build was so unique that I don‚Äôt really mind it
This was a fun build
anyway bad jokes aside
Second part of the Christmas backlog is done
Don‚Äôt stop carry on
All of the shrike team diiiiiies~
Also took a better photo of Vidar
I‚Äôm gonna wait a bit before building that
First one done is the HG IBO Gundam Vidar and this was a fun build
Got a very high amount of plastic crack for Christmas so I‚Äôm gonna work through it slowly
The funny thing is either works
sechs
close second is Infinite Justice because I really dig the hot pink and sheer number of beam weapons it has
yo same
The better Kira Yamato Gundam
thanks Aria
I‚Äôm mostly over it now but I‚Äôm still upset
The worst part about this is I wanted my first MG to be my last build of 2021, but I ruined that for myself I guess
no one has ever cared
no one cares
why the fuck am I even saying any of this
I wanna lacerate myself with an exacto knife on god
YOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
https://twitter.com/BandaiHobbyUS/status/1483503725431836678?s=20
ayy the EG
MG BarBayToes is done and on a shelf
Barbie toes
And
Got the Figurise Kamen Rider W CycloneJoker
Went to hobby town today to get some new plastic crack
LET'S GOOOOOO
METEOR UNIT
Because he is here
Count up your sins
was really fun
Like by snapping the parts out with my hands
I made this in my bedroom btw
baby
baby boy
A little entry grade friend
My HG SRW redemption arc is complete
Yeah lmao
Just got one arm left, gonna stop for now
Progress update
BUNKER! TSURANUKE!
LETS FUCKING GOOOOOOOOO
Ya boy back at it again
yeah he's chilling on one of my higher shelves
I built an HG alt tooooo
I'm upset you didn't ping me <:MikuCry:688397678584791074>
AKA MG Heavyarms EW done
Don‚Äôt talk to me or my son ever again
I don't hate the HG Banshee but I'm not gonna mess with it for a while
I had to glue the damn v fin together and glue it in the slot it goes into
like I had to glue the top part of one of it's legs together because it popped open by itself
it's the fact the HG Unicorn itself sucks
The gold plastic isn't the problem with the Banshee
Oh speaking of Gundams this financial mistake is done
Barm!
And Core Gundam
Katoki created concepts for the wing boys' og gundams if they were in EW and that's what that MG is based on
Normal heavyarms actually
I‚Äôm working on the Banshee right now
That‚Äôs in the shopping bag
Nah dw
*Rhythm Emotion plays faintly*
Got some new HGs today and this is the first one I‚Äôm building
00 next to its big brother and more detailed big brother
Well it‚Äôs got it‚Äôs legs back
Love doin silly stuff with model kits
but it was tricky
I got it into a much better sword pose eventually
simply because it has so much weight
God this is a nice kit but the tactical arms is lmao
I had to fake an obari pose for this shot but it was worth it
the navy blue upper body and massive WMDs on its back help a lot with that
It's got some crazy shelf presence for an HG
All of my problems with it are basically just color accuracy
This was a really good build
POV the moon is out
He‚Äôs strapped
I have a UC shelf and I saw my hobby shop had it in stock so I decided "eh why not"
ITS JUST FIVE PARTS NO STICKERS I‚Äôm in love
This is literally the best head I‚Äôve ever built I‚Äôm gonna cry
liked the build though
even considering it's age
this is not a very good finished product
which is what my HG Exia is using
in the end I had to jury rig a setup involving a sub-arm from an AB4 and an Action Base 2
Kyrios done posing this made me wanna off myself
I‚Äôve always wanted an Impulse of some kind though
There were Blue Destiny kits and 08th MS team HGs it was tough
This was all from one shop and this is what I ultimately decided on there was a lot of cool stuff
I‚Äôm back on my bullshit
‚¨ÜÔ∏è ‚¨ÖÔ∏è ‚¨ÜÔ∏è

*angey teenager noises*
Small OYW display with my newly completed GTO Zaku II
REAL
Bigheadass
It looks really good though
It‚Äôs honestly a little bigger than I was expecting
NANTOOOOO
It may not be for a while but I will
I‚Äôm gonna do it
It‚Äôs small as hell and has a face changing gimmick
This thing is so cool
Here‚Äôs a progress update on one of them, the HGUC Gundam F91
Oh I‚Äôm building all of them
I have an addiction
This was a cool build
Transient done
*Graham Aker noises*
he was a legend
Also some silly pics I took while building
What that Gekkouchou do
Babey
I love this thing so much feels great to pose
I took so many pictures of the HG Moon
More pictures
I‚Äôve been mooned (this thing fucks
Leo
Legs especially
Zetaaaaaaaaa I hated this build
LITERALLY THE SAME CHARACTER
When the Justice is Infinite
WOOO-
"stop blowing up fish"

"Bleeeehhh I don't wanna!"
You know idk why but the AGE-FX‚Äôs head without all of its v fin assembled looks kinda like a G1 Transformer
Deenames nuts
<:MikuDelete:661660028410920990>
And it‚Äôs rifle if you can‚Äôt tell somehow
Dynames‚Äô body is done
Oooh that‚Äôs a nice 00 QANT
As many problems as 00 had it‚Äôs still one of my favorite anime series
The lads
And both of my CB master grades because why not
‚ÄúMARIE!‚Äù
me
If it wasn‚Äôt fun to customize them there‚Äôd be a problem
They are built for it
With quite a few spares
1508 pieces exactly
Even just standing completely still im impressed he‚Äôs so big
God it looks so fucjing cool
Lego Optimus Prime done
One leg mostly built
The body is already kinda heavy
Started work on LEGO Optimus
Honestly this was my own fucking fault for not being more careful but I guess this is what I get for being a fucking useless piece of shit who can‚Äôt be fucking careful
I decided to skip ahead a bit and work on the hands and ended up snapping the tiny ass fragile hinge joints in two separate places *on both hands*
I literally cannot finish the RG GaoGaiGar anymore
~~also idk why he‚Äôs brighter in the pic he‚Äôs darker irl~~
RG Goldymarg is done 
This was honestly a kind of frustrating build and I didn‚Äôt enjoy it that much
HAJIROBOCCHI
I‚Äôm an idiot
Oh right
I‚Äôm lazy
Also
I don‚Äôt remember my pixiv login because it‚Äôs been literal years since I‚Äôve used it
Issue
One of these days I‚Äôm just gonna go on the subreddit and just look for HibiMiku fanart

Ever again if at all possible
Just stuff I don‚Äôt want to think about
It‚Äôs not even stuff I regret
That I‚Äôd rather forget
Started thinking about the past
I just started getting myself psyched out for no reason
*fun*
That was
I had a meltdown in the shower earlier
jesus
spit on macross' grave even more why don't you
I have bad enough anxiety as it is I don‚Äôt need a war making things worse
Same here
I don‚Äôt want to see any of this
I‚Äôm still terrified
I don‚Äôt care
It feels like everything is just gonna start crashing down
I‚Äôm not even 20 years old yet and I feel like the world is gonna end
Why do we do nothing but fight and fight and fight even when it costs so much in money and in resources
Why are we like this
Why
People shouldn‚Äôt be doing this
Make all of this senseless violence stop
Make it stop
anyway kuromaya for life
... I know what I'm saying is technically illegal but who fucking cares lol it's anime
but if it isn't I just pirate
like usually I try to watch stuff on crunchyroll if it's on there because I have a premium account and I like supporting the creators
any other piracy site
or like
just use gogoanime
it's so fucking good
1. this may be the best anime I've seen this year, I say *may* because I still need to finish the multiple Gundam anime I'm watching
2. idk if it's relevant here but Maya tops Claudine I'm sorry
two things I want to say atm
slightly :)

FUCKING
LETS
he's also Domon Kasshu
the man was literally imprisoned for a crime he never did give him a break
https://tenor.com/view/hmm-suspect-gif-22611582
now wait until Victory
yeah that's gundam for you
Girl pretty üòç
Gridman is a bit yuri yeah
Neo Denmark literally has an army of them
The Nether Gundam is the best
This
It‚Äôs also full of racial stereotypes
G Gundam is both the stupidest and most awesome Gundam anime

Is this where that one off model frame of the Gundam came from
It's pretty gay by default
this is a real pannel

what manga are these pannels from
I love it
That is the busiest thing I have ever seen
or how anytime the waverider moves in an animation it just fucking jumps forward
I love how Arios-san's Zeta Gundam just has random parts of the waverider moving during the Waverider Charge's wind-up
It looks so baaaad
Waverider Charge sucks ass on Arios Zeta I'm sorry
Godmars is literally more animated in Z2's intro cinematic than it is in game it's great
Z3 Zeta comes to mind
I'm trying to think of other bad Arios-san stuff
I don't like the limp cut
That animation is so baaaaaaaaaaaad
oh god 30 beam attack ü§¢
All of Z3's potential quality is funneled into the Nu Gundam
it's because the move suddenly changes sprites out of nowhere
Roche Saber Overbreak in 30 is kinda peepee but that's not just because it has Arios-san jank
*All of the GrandVang*
Z3 Harute just being an entity in Trans-AM
Gridman comes close to that
and then there's Z3 Nu Gundam which is basically perfect and I wish they just kept reusing those animations I love them
The average Arios-san animation is either a mess or just plain bad
If anything animations are in general getting worse
God
THEY JUST SPLIT ONE UP FOR 30 I HATE IT
WHY DOES ELDORA SOUL ONLY HAVE TWO ATTACKS IN T
I fucking feel that
Daimos is the best part of A Portable by a mile, the only thing close is Dragonar
especially Lemon
I know about Lemon and Vindel in AP and they embody everything wrong with the game
I like how A Portable is just fucking pure bullshit all the way through
OR HOW MORE THAN HALF OF THE ACTUALLY COOL UNITS SUCK ASS AND ARE BASICALLY UNUSABLE
OR HOW EVERY FUCKING BOSS JUST RUNS AT HALF HEALTH DEPRIVING YOU OF VALUABLE MONEY IN A GAME WHERE MONEY IS SUPER SCARCE
*all* of A Portable's difficulty is artificial, like how every fucking attack has a *negative true hit modifier*, or how EVERY FUCKING ENEMY HAS ABSURDLY HIGH EVASION AND HP FOR NO GOOD REASON ESPECIALLY WHEN GESPENTS IN OLD A HAD LIKE 6.5K HEALTH WHILE IN A PORTABLE THEY HAVE ***11 THOUSAND HP IN ONE OF THE FIRST SCENARIOS YOU FIGHT THEM IN***
and not in a good way
It's just a lazy remake that jacks up the difficulty of a game that already wasn't particularly easy
A Portable may genuinely be one of the worst games I have ever played
Also the Hathaway's Flash theme was just the fuckin song it got in G Gen
~~fair but like I wanted to work with an actual terrorist~~
Why bring back SEED Destiny of all shows
Forget Hathaway's Flash just being the Xi Gundam and Penelope
like forget 00
god why the fuck was destiny in V
Ange just popping open her cockpit in space and dying instantly <:GermainCool:736523122324275309>
Funniest cut in definitely goes to Vilkiss
THEY LITERALLY CUT IT BECAUSE PEOPLE DIDN'T GET IT
THE FUCKING LALA CALLBACK WAS SO GOOD
My brain keeps telling me to bitch about how T cut the really good dynamic kill the Hi-Nu had in X and I want to
and the premium sound pack yeah
You have custom music for that
Devo Getter fucks
It's not a theme tied to that getter at all
and DRAGON is New Getter Robo's theme
30 Shin Dragon first appeared in T though
I kid, I kid
You say that but then Shin Dragon-
30 Zeta Gundam is good HD SRW animation imo
the fucking hit itself
how it actually feels like it has momentum
the Kamille cut in
30 Waverider Charge is so damn good
I have a lot of problems with HD Zeta Gundam
just one keyframe to the next
no momentum
no speed
I watched like 19 episodes of SEED and throughout all of it I barely tolerated Kira before dropping the show
I would rather have a game focus on this crackhead than Kira any day of the fucking year
~~I wish it stayed sidelined for Astray to be fair but still~~
and then got sidelined for Astray and Destiny
It's fucked how SEED only appeared in two SRW titles
which is a shame because Cagalli is one of 5 good things in OG SEED
she literally just ceased to exist effectively
Yeah no someone on the production team had it out for her
I love Crossbone art
I need to read crossbone
THAT'S SO FUNNY
Remember how SEED Destiny just made Cagalli stop being a character just because one of the directors hated her or some shit?
and just has them do fuckin anything because WEEEEEEE PSYCOFRAME
It's great because Unicorn doesn't even try to enforce the idea that Newtypes are still just human
Tobia is great
It's so crazy Tobia literally denies the fact that he's a newtype to make a point that being a newtype isn't special
Crossbone is cool and based
I just
Combining guns are dumb yeah
don't
~~also obligatory mention of how the Blu Duel got fucking mauled~~
that's so dumb
wait it does do that I forgot
Okay Buster Gundam does it right
the combining beam rifle feels excessive and dumb
I like the wings being funnel racks and that's it
it literally takes everything that made the Freedom cool and *ruins it*
HATE THE STRIKE FREEDOM
UGLY-ASS MOTHERFUCKER
LOOK AT THIS CHEAP FUCKING IMITATION
GIVE ME THE FREEDOM BACK
Hayato was literally almost 10 times better than them
They don‚Äôt because they sucked
Glad to know some adults are against child soldiers
And I like that
At all
It‚Äôs also a plot point that they don‚Äôt want to have to use kids to fight but have no choice because no adults can drive a Shinkalion like
he's just kinda eh
hate him
even then I don't like
I think the only Shinkalion character I don't like is Tsuranuki
like he actually has undiagnosed autism it's great
I love how Hayato is just autistic
But that's a different subject
Ultraman lore is crazy
I think it's funny how Anno created Eva as a love letter to the shit he loved when he was a kid and then dumbasses on the internet thought it was deeper than it actually was
HE WOULD
HE WOULD DO THAT
Shinkalion is better than Eva because they got Hatsune Miku's voice actress to voice a character based on Hatsune Miku and then autotuned her voice to sound like a vocaloid
OH YEAH SHE'S THE FOCUS CHARACTER BECAUSE SHE'S NAMED AFTER A SHINKANSEN
it's so good
Somehow Shinkalion's MC gets isekai'd to Tokyo-3 and he has to fight a fucked up Angel with Shinji in an Eva-Shinkalion
THERE'S AN EVA CAMEO IN THE SHOW ITSELF IT'S SO FUNNY
OH YEAH SHINJI
the main character's dad gets turned into a child
Shinkalion the movie is literally the dumbest thing, Hatsune Miku fights Godzilla
WHY IS GODZILLA IN IT
Shinkalion is peak fiction btw
https://twitter.com/GundamGirlOTD/status/1559223122397724672?s=20&t=_ueRG55o3bCVZN7BZMsc3A
Good shit, read it
on an unrelated note I read Bloom into You
Cross Ange's first episode is funny because the show literally never gets that bloody ever again
It‚Äôs like Terry Bogard
It‚Äôs energy
The controls for Gunpla battle  don‚Äôt make sense anyway why do you care
Okay see that was actually cool
Kinda wish she stuck with GMs tbh
It‚Äôs a GM Powered yeah
At least we got the Star Winning Gundam out of it
They had to give Fumina a character arc when they had nothing to work with previously
Yeah
It‚Äôs the RII but worse
Amazing Exia makes me angry
Just something that actually thematically fits
Just give him a Sazabi or Gelgoog or some shit
I love the Exia and I wish Meijin didn‚Äôt get it
Give me another F91 custom Bandai you cowards
And SEED
But no instead it‚Äôs the start of Build dickriding 00
I love the Kampfer it‚Äôs a cool suit
I wish we got to keep the Amazing Kampfer
I also hate the ending pretty much entirely for that asshole ceo fucker
I think it looks stupid
I don‚Äôt like the Exia Dark Matter I‚Äôm sorry
I just hate it all around
It‚Äôs animated weird, it has bad lighting, it isn‚Äôt consistent with how Nils fought prior to that point
The Sengoku Astray fight is so badddd
Every fight after Meijin vs the Renato brothers makes me either fall asleep or wanna puke
Like I just want a fun tournament arc and I did get that
For like 4 episodes
I hate the entirety of the last few episodes of the og honestly 
Especially all of the dumb alien gemstone bullshit
At least the whole thing was fun to watch all the way through and didn‚Äôt just randomly start being boring towards the end
I like TRY more than the OG Build Fighters tbh
I‚Äôm pretty sure Harmony Gold withholding this from the west for bullshit should be illegal it‚Äôs so fucked
Happy anniversary funny plane show

at both you and Melua
Shot Weapon is Dunbine smh
IBO at least has good music
actually kind of normal names
Brain Powerd has like
L-Gaim still has Amandra Kamandra though
I'm fucking crying
I'M GONNA GO INSANE I'VE NEVER BEEN THIS HAPPY
THIS CANNOT BE REAL
I'M DREAMING
He was a real one
He did so much music for so many shows, animated or otherwise
Ichiro Mizuki was a legend in many ways
I am going to fucking give myself to the Getter Rays
with a custom Mobile Trace Suit
the goddamn *horse* has a mobile suit
I love this fucking show
