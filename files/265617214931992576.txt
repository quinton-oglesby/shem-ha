Yo
W.I.P

i mean you not wrong
-*/
+++.
I love my magical girl power rangers
oh gawd the blue ray
next episode now
honestly the entire cast is so good and thats pretty rare with anime
SHE USED HER SCARF TO FIGHT AGAIN!!!
that entire fight was so hot
this show is pure fanservice but in the good way
with good animation
they flexed hard
I'm like 5 minutes in and its everything I hoped for
its so good
hibikis song is a bop as always
so glad trash dad is never mentioned ever
his name is so stupid  like the directors said whats the most american name ever
he was the hero we needed but not the one we deserved
end it with the song that started it all
gyakkou no flugel
but you what know they should end the series with
its a good song
ah
were they singing axia no kaze or was it a different song
U right
now thats a great cliff hanger
this is so hype
was soooooooo cool
that song at the end
dudes, and dudettes
and his chin is sharp
why is he so buff
is that.....
he stopped a gaint sword with his FIST
genjuro just has a husband we never met
because yes
what if we kissed but had our X-Drives on
at least we have the mobile game
at least the writers finally explained how they can be outside in those outfits and not be cold
fists 1 reason 0
see you need a high IQ to understand symphogear
subtle is its middle name
this is symphogear my dude
like c'mon foreshadowing
also I think to tug on our heart strings she and hibiki are going to fight again
they hinted that she can use a gear at the end of AXZ
also new MIKU SONNNNNGGGGGGGGG
miku is a lucky lady
mangu*
is that japonese what are you some kinda weeb who watches animu
he was the worst part of the series
no more pain
dude last season kiriaka almost died pls
honestly with this series its plausible
the guy from the manga
he looked kinda like topdad
oh boi
at least there are comptant people in this world
is fine stronger than adam
what even is the villian power scaling in his show
lewd
thats why all the gear are great characters they exume BDE
phonic gain is just BDE
he has BDE thats why hes so strong it all makes sense
I head hes shredded
I hear genjuro kazanari has a 8 pack
have fun rewatching
ah I see
whats your favorite part
where we nerdgasm
same thing next week?
see ya my dude
all I rember is that alot of peope didn't like the wedding dress event for some reason
what even happened in that event
that event was interesting
ah thanks <@284390402210136064>
symphogear: its okay to do drugs if it means its super gay reasons
when ever a letter is mentoned kiriaka allways freaks out
what even is the refrence
so I have a question bout the letter in-joke
bury the gays
in opening scenes
nothing can top gx honestly
is that a motha trukin jojo refrence
tsubasa singing about now being able to fly
if you guys think about sentai and kamen rider are also magical girls
I personally like nanoha
plushies is my answer
he is a a-list celeb so it would be hard to have him film for the show  plus all the other gigs he has to do
of course the hype train is strong
WHAT KIND OF BOMB ASS NAME IS THIS
EXCUSE ME
https://symphogear.fandom.com/wiki/FINAL_COMMANDER
Why must symphogear be suffering and pain
Thay episode hurted my kokoro
oh my god genjuro is a gen Z kid
shes a gen z kid
and ryoko is 3o somthing right
but the poster says 2045
so apparently symphogear is in the year 2045
I don't know alot of people died
in the show that is
bat girl has killed more than all the villians combined
jesus what is with concerts and mortaility in this show
their saving the final boss for last <@486087033652248576>
god the K/D on those roller blade noise is insane
looks like we got actually villians this time
god was right to take langue away
uhhhhh
ew
how old is she surrposed to be
this show is pain



seeing as she really wanted to please vanessa
I am seeing the dynamic between chris and fine  with vanessa and cat girl
kinda like fine did with chris
it seems that bat girl and OWO wolf are being manipulated by whats her face
shit went to 100
but was that super contained to the underground after the concert
If I was a conspiracy theorist It would look sus
god the amount of zewi wing concerts that have gone wrong is 3/4
I like how her song is shes not going to break and than she snaps 10 minutes later
but she killed way was people techinacally but had a higher mortality rate
two wings is a great name
I think Fine Planned it
thats how most accidents work
probably alot injured than dead
I refuse
no
like pointless character deaths
especially like the 00 movie plot and everything else
https://tenor.com/view/aliens-giorgio-conspiracion-memealiens-alienshistory-gif-9621737
aliens
see thats what they said at AXZ so I don't know about that
maaybe a movie
I think this is the last season
asking the ladies in this discord can your spine bend all that way while walking because I know Mine can't
<@486087033652248576>  fixed it for you
god is asexual and fine was getting in the way of his gains*
best character honestly
are we going to meet god and they look like a bishie pretty boi or a manly man of a man
Fine for being horny on main
sorry english is hard
language
god should have erased us instead of taking language away
I love the training montages though
give me more man eye candy we got enough for the lads
no
plz
we got a bombass concert like season 1 but we also got the horrible tragedy of season 1 too
life is pain in this show
thats a big mood
why not both tho
Idiots would do that
Oh my god
Theirs good people on both sides
So any of you fellas see the preview photo
Thanks my fellow gear lover
I feel like the big dumb
Sorry about confusing you cowpokes
I don't want more bad to things to happen hence the meme reaction

This is happening way earlier then i expected
Does that mean shes had that on her head for like 2 seasons now
I fucking hate this show

ðŸ˜‚
This is getting too real
god the anticapation
lets get that bread warriors
on crunchyroll
that episode was hype my doggos
why must you make us wait for that
we haven't seen the swords transformation yet
maria is getting that neat golden arm
I mean so was saint germain and she became hibikis stand
been waiting 4 seasons and a mobile game
the question is are we finally getting our Fine song
we had one last season
probs
zewi wings concert prank GONE WRONG!!!!!!
did we ever get a rocketo punch in this series
now thats knida cool
vanessa is a super robot
B) they think the 2nd divison is in cahoots with fudo
probably A) fudo took over the goverment
god I wish that was me
god that was so good
a solid nine
god that episode was hype
that maria transformation tho
the most opressed race
the deep crimson bond they proudly share in their fight against the world that scorned them.

what kind of middle school name is that
they fucking call themselves noble red
dude
I forgot MAO was gokai yellow
the wiki says 22
that was some good shit
plus shes 21 and thats okay
dude she is stacked beyond belief
caliber is a good name considering what her relic is based off of
marias was super erotic and all I have to say is NOICE<:MikuGay:336656810788388864>
maybe we'll get that in the blu-ray editions
https://twitter.com/zoid9000/status/1155131331531218944
did you see the animators tweet about it <@115583025177296901>
At least we got bannana noise
I think the series established this after he cucked his son
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gT5AtkG1i4
yes it does
god that was so good
will miku be the new fine, being horny for god
I personally welcome our custodian overlords
at the end of the episode it showed them inside the barriers
it was weird considering tsubasa wanted to eviserate them
https://tenor.com/view/aliens-giorgio-conspiracion-memealiens-alienshistory-gif-9621737
look I'm not saying aliens this season but
let genjuro fight 2k19
huh
fudo can use a barrier
https://tenor.com/view/igive-it-to-ya-you-got-me-there-you-got-me-tricked-prank-gif-4730848
why
sunglasses is a keyword this season
I think only shirabe maria and hibiki would have a stand because they had the heart symbols when transforming and chris and kiri didn't
not saying kaneko is a kamen rider fan but
shes gokai yellow
no wonder vanessa sounded familliar
now thats some good shit
I mean the others I am assuming have no combat abillity so they didn't fight back to avoid getting them hurt
he got stabbed fine and was still runing around he could totally Shun Goku Satsu them all
the opera singing at the start was NOICE ðŸ’—
I love Stand Up Lady!!!
I'm saving my opinion for her side B song on the CD
as someone who enjoys ballet I appreciated her transformation
he had a barrier protecting him
or occam's razor he is just a ambitous asshole who does what he wants for power
owo
he might just be that strong
he might be like adam and converted his body to a super chojin
thats so fucked up
sometime I forget that tsubasa and genjuro are sibilings and are not uncle and niece
i usally wait till the guys here translate the episode for the best experience
Die Spinne means "the spider" right
dishupine isn't even an actually word
it seems that fudos faction is going to be the bad guys this season
we don't know the full extent of what they told them to do or the circumstances behind them being told to stand down
literally Breast Fire
plz vanessa we don't want miku to kill you off early
Buff gears are life
cowards
the gears are alot shorter than I thought they would be too like the average height is 5 feet
hot take but all the gears should be buff in some capacity
I mean hibiki should be jacked from all that fighting she does
shit I picked the wrong  game
I wonder what the final boss would look like this season since we had litteraly satan last season
^^^^^^^
the worst game in the series
you must play super robot wars T as penance
bold of you to assume that Aphrodite A is not already a waifu <@486087033652248576>
it might be the replacement for the ignite module
as someone who watches ballet it was a pretty good animation
maybe hes a nobunaga kind of character
miku would probably join fudo in order to protect hibiki in some twisted sense of the word
it could be those with that specific blood type are related to the custodians
the blood is important for some reason
FOR MAX AGNST
it seems like a major event will happen that will force the gears to choose sides and they are evenly split on it causing them to do battle
symphogear: civil war
is she.....is she shooting pocky at them
that is
hot take but if vanessa doesn't do the borot punch this anime wil become a 9/10 for me
so symphogear
is this becoming persona
how can you say something so controverisal but so profound
damn
we did have ultraman last season so saint seiya would be great
has symphogear ever made sense
I mean in the first season the gears were able to get there rather quickly
adam did voice lockon stratos
maria might get serena and shirabe might get fine considering how important they are in the openings and endings sequences
it might not be the other alchemist
he follows the path of the swole
believe in me that believes in you
its weird how final commander was a one off song in the 1st episode
I always want to know  what happens next so tjats good
this seasons doing a good job on antcipation
found out next time on symphogear XV
I never liked the autotuned songs that the ignite did
hibiki likes them thiccc
they make up after the fight and go have that Karaoke night
a human hamster you would say
hibiki is a big eater
is he going to become relavent this season
question is what happened to that american guy who showed talked to them at the end of AXZ
all got to say is nice
symphogears most rare-pair needs a song
damn you right
so she gets a duet with him
Dr. ver still exsits in her head
y'all sleeping on a major character in marias psyhe
so its not wild to assume he'll get a song
I assume so because the duets for AXZ were in BDs
first anime merch I have ever bought
and now I wait in pain
I already got them my dude
flex on them with your good music
do it
I am so buying the CDS when they come out
the cds for the previous seasons are on amazon so guess I know what I am blasting in my car
A splinter faction inside the american goverment that wants to use the relics to make america great again
maybe the bad guys symbol
a spider I'm assuming
but which mazinger ending tho
it reminded me of gurren laganns boomerang sunglasses
if you become the vessal hibiki would be safe and not suffer anymore-bad guy of the season probably
miku would be manipulated like what happend in G with ver
she wouldn't be betraying them per say
THICCCCCCCC
have you seen that body pillow that came out
if he fought them the others would be injured or worse
he did fight fine 1v1 and noise without flinching
they probably told him to tell them to stand down or that hes just staying calm
nah it doesn't seem likely
it is canon she plays fighting games and nobody can tell me other wise
nah man she plays street fighter
That episode hurted
Bro nani the duck
I remember  someone predicting the auto scorers as a joke
Lol carol is trending

But fellas this means the most important thing new miku song<:MikuBliss:336657233712513024> !!!!!!!
How can anything top that
That episode felt like episode 12 tbh
Whos seen the episode
Thats a F in chat bois
ahhh
so ogawa has brothers
so the mobile game?
I mean what could they top for next season they fought "god"
movie?
i was hoping for a hibiki and chris duet
that x-drive design is gr8
getting gurren lagaan feels from that hair
I just assumed vannessa and thiccc batgirl did all the killing
did elsa kill anyone
did hibiki's hair grow
Have seen how tight those outfits are
uhhhh probably
https://tenor.com/view/iunderstood-that-reference-gif-9964680 <@486087033652248576>
these past 4 episodes in a nut shell

everyones here
I honestly didn't know he had siblings
ogawa's brothers got the good character designs for being on screen for 30 seconds
she probably remote controlled her since you know robot
I liked hibikis alot
oh yeah
I think the amagalam designs are the weakest of the series but still good overall
someone needs to shout SYMPHOGEEEEAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRRR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
no its confirmed to be regular length
did they update that photo where the guys are reacting to each episode yet
