if crashing at the destination is fine she can handle it <:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
was not expecting oringal setup linkara in there
ninjago symphogear crossover when?



yeah unlikely an announcement about basic internet safety knowledge on a discord channel will do much
I don't use nsfw so I can't really speak on that, but I can say prob the best route is being ready to share an invite when you encounter other symphogear fans, brings in new people without the hassle of public
I like my defined edges, none of these gradients and curves in my ui design pls
but who knows how popular that is, I mean I'm the weird type that used "classic" theme on windows 7
new is good if you just want to scroll through image posts, but for glancing over the frontpage and navigation old is just so much more streamlined imo
at least desktop users, mobile is pretty much just new
yeah
tbh I never knew discord had a public server search anyway till today
but symphogear doesn't really have a big enough western fanbase for a wave to be that likely anyway
that is the nice thing about a trickle vs a wave of new users, makes it some you get to know the new people
well since this server has non-expiring invite links you can still find it through a search of the sub/google, how I found it since the server is only linked on the new reddit sidebar, not the old reddit sidebar
well also there's the fact that a few days ago in this thread people where talking about how the server is more disconnected from the subreddit than in the past and might separate at some point
yeah, I heard it mentioned on reddit but saw no link on the sidebar because I use old reddit and had to look up a thread where someone was linked it
can be found without finding an invite link
yeah, a lot of servers require a certain emote reaction/typed message to the rules followed by a wait period before posting. Reduces bots but isn't something a bot can't do
Fair
I think the only time I got heated was in a political argument in serious, but I keep that channel muted anyway and had no bad blood outside that channel with the other person
we're a bunch of weirdos that are fine with each other's weirdness
yeah this server is more "understanding" than "reasonable" imo lol
but that's only an issue for those who aren't already part of any big/public servers
why not just make the emote server public?
yeah, and I like it that way, was saying my points about confusion doesn't matter much as no one gets in trouble if they do get confused and pick their own "best fit" for a certain chat
just putting out points, not to bothered with how things are given things are kinda lax with what's allowed where anyway, like people don't get in trouble for having a chat about a cartoon in general instead of anime
again, specific names for non specific channels cause confusion for new people
oh, I recall last time I asked about it I was directed unconfidently to nonsmphogear-spoilers
kinda like how western cartoon discussions tend to end up in general even if they technically fit in nonsmphogear-spoilers, especially if spoilers or new stuff aren't being talked about
yeah them being in the same spot makes sense with how many of one are adapted to the other, but with just anime listed in the name people might just start discussing it in general (or book if that's created eventually)
hey if it's 90% ln's but still gives a place for someone's thoughts on other books I'd say it will have served its purpose
fair, should at least get a test run though
would at least motivate me to finish the 2-3 books I have partially read
given we have channels in hobbies and interests for anime, live action media, and music I don't see why we don't have a channel for books
either way, would like if there was a server announce when pre-orders go up
and s1 was a wait from late july to late october from announce to release according to the wiki
well g was announced mid sept and came out late jan so by that I feel pre-september isn't that crazy
so I feel a summer release isn't that unlikely
well they just said on the stream the stuff without dates isn't that far out and is often down to getting japan to sign off on things
we should probably at least have one when the release date beyond "later 2022" is announced since it's not in the april or may line-up
someone needs to edit chris's head onto the "gardening with a shogun" clip
top gear would be a great april fools name tbh
yeah, would love a place to archive things like husband jake, also quote channels in general are always fun
channels are pretty loose intentionally around here
well just like anime based games, it's kinda up to the user to determine best fit
I guess "hardware" could be used if tech is too broad
western cartoons and Japanese manga and light novels are stated to go in anime club, not general, so idk why tech in gaming is any different
your argument that tech things not directly related to gaming don't belong there are being ignorant to how other channels around here work <:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
here's how another non gaming centric one does it, but given Melua prefers for avoid creating new channels and having anything semi related in one channel (western cartoons, manga, comics, and light novels going in anime club for example) I feel having gaming being the stated tech place is the best fit for the way things are done here
very different kind of discord (probably a gaming centric one) if it has dedicated channels for different games
counter counter point, specs and hardware affect your experience and options in gaming
tech is already shotgunned across general, live posting, and gaming with little ryme or reason since there is no stated spot
like pc specs and hardware isn't strictly for gaming, but it is used when gaming
So adding tech to gaming, it will effectively de-bloat general
Tech talk will happen, but atm it gets split between gaming and general since no one is sure
tbh if the server had more active users and was more willing to make new channels I could see a set of channels of "gaming, retro gaming, card games, and tech" (feel those would spread out most of the gaming channel flooding topics) but with the current server user base I feel just a lone new "tech" channel would be nice
and that's often what is talked about in most tech channels on discord, since discord is mostly aimed at gamers
yeah a tool no one uses is probably not a good solution
never seen them used on discord
didn't realize these where a thing so I assumed you meant something else
don't think I've really heard of "threads" in a technical sense in discord
tbh I assumed you meant categories since usually when I think of threads I think reply chains and forum threads which was obviously not what you guys where talking about
kinda stupid logic when there are a bunch of relatively low traffic channels in "hobbies and interests" but people don't complain
that's the issues, those in charge don't want to create any new channels unless they really have to
also just realized, tabletops have a dedicated channel but card games don't?
a tech channel would be ideal, but every time it's brought up it gets shot down by admins
and if annoyance is all the matters, what about when  gaming gets flooded with trading card talk and other people want to talk video games?
while that is tech it's not what people really think of when "tech" is mentioned. also you're kinda straw manning here by bringing up subjects that people are super unlikely to be aware of, let alone want to talk about
also prevents people questioning/getting annoyed if gaming related tech is brought up without directly talking about use in games
look at some of the original posts das made, there have been problems of confusion
so some just want that the way things work to be a bit more clear in channel names
yeah, a tech centric channel would be nice but at this point I doubt that's happening given statements from admins on how they want things to work
while the dedicated channels are for more in depth talk and also more leniency of spoilers (and depending on the channel) different rules on frequency or images
general is pretty much anything not nsfw, spam, lots of images, or spoilers in how it's used
and people also talk gaming, anime, and symphoghear in general as well
yeah because Melua doesn't like making new dedicated channels and would prefer things be loosely sorted into the existing ones, the current request is more about making the channel uses more clear
not all manga and light novels have a connection to anime, but are talked about in anime club
as people testing "can it run doom", any tech can be used for gaming <:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
it's not tightening, it's just reducing confusion. tech is already talked about in gaming and doesn't prevent people from talking about gaming there but people have mentioned being unsure where to post new pc hardware, etc. because of the vagueness
well if they really are worried about moderation they could just change their minds and allow a new channel <:KanadeWink:690470895608791040>
yeah, besides das's image chains it's mainly been used for sfw shitposting
also, I'm an adult and still don't want to see much nsfw stuff so it's nice even for those not restricted by age
yeah
well also it was stated as having the function of shitposting but sfw, not just you liveposting your gameplay
liveposting is working well, just wish things that fit it would actually be done more in it instead of other channels (like sfw meme spam that sometimes appears in general)
so pretty much anything about anime/manga/cartoons that's not gear goes there unless it's shit posting or live posting
usually con talk (although rare) happens in <#371105434771390465> , the channels are loose since the mods don't want too many channels
I have seen a self-promo channel get used, but only for like posting twitch links when going live
love this server has some of the best hug emote selection <:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
and then from others: the encouraging hug- <:ZweiHug:672455346949980170>  the consoling hug- <:HibiMiku:432007202136391690>
the unwilling hug- <:ChrisHibikiHug:630262562361049121>  the comforting hug- <:HibikiHug:620080558462205956>
never had nitro so haven't used most of those, but the fact you made a majority of the hug emotes makes me smile <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
also due to those stickers I decided to commission Mitamory tonight <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
since for me it's mainly down to lack of credit and the extra hassle in finding the original that bugs me with the repost accounts I complain about
also I feel accounts the repost official art from shows are fine (like ones that post design sheet scans and the like)
I feel if a repost account does source cite it would be fine, given it's just a more public version of what the art channels serve as
the thing is I've rarely seen a repost account cite their source
sorry I just thought it just connected to pattern of behavior relevant to the art stuff
also they seem to not think before linking anything they find on twitter they like in any channel, given the many many posts of the pachinko machine in action in symphogear discussion
yeah, most other reposts are from twitter accounts where it's hard to tell, while Z has many times posted from obvious "daily" or rp accounts before (though I think we did get them to stop posting the rp ones)
~~almost like with fictional characters you can plan to spread out character b-days~~
oh yeah, it's Saturday (15th)
<:CarolStare:336656462287994882>
speaking of color changes, what's the reason behind favorite character roles being simple reaction based while color roles aren't? (doesn't effect me too much as I've always been the same color except for serena con, but has always puzzled me)
quite a few nice people in here who are up to discuss and help with things
hi
Hi, I found Symphogear a few weeks ago from Hibiki being in a meme I saw on twitter, I watched through like a season a day and now the music is stuck in my head. And the funny thing is I've only watched a full season or more of like 2 anime's before in my life, lol.
ah
bots probably
3 "new to discord" no profile pic or info accounts in a row...
hello!

tbh if it wasn't for a joke yesterday I would have forgotten their actual username is "gone" and not those symbols lol
Hi!
hello!
they are great emotes <:KanadeWink:690470895608791040>
the bird owner and food maker has returned!
hello!
hello!
hello!
welcome back!
well I've only been here a few months so you're new here to me <:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
Oh hey, I think I recognize you from twitter, welcome! <:HibikiFingerguns:688429715836502063>
seeing your animated banner reminds me, I need to keep working on that lego chris revolver <:ChrisBang:702166093065748500>
Well hey, you talking gundam in anime club just makes things feel back to normal <:HibikiFingerguns:688429715836502063>
Welcome back!
the return! <:MikuPraise:585839808765493249>
ah, I avoid that channel, I'd butt heads too much <:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
you're not one of the usual "leave and rejoin" types and you've often ranted about time on this server missed, what happened?
<:HibikiWhat:336656482907193344>
Always nice to see you return. <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
no clue what led them here
yeah, a party of macros delta fans just all hopped in together
cool, a macross delta banner <:HibikiWow:738172615453048912>
welcome back! <:MikuPraise:585839808765493249>
Always a nice return to see <:KirikaApproval:586957465552158720>
Nice to see you back <:HibikiFingerguns:688429715836502063>
Das likes Kanade too. and even beyond that, we are all part of the gungnir girl fanclub. <:KanadeWink:690470895608791040>  <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456> <:MariaYell:336657352264646657>
<:ZweiHug:672455346949980170>
well the user count is mosly people here for the cute emotes, but we do have a cozy little active community of Symphogear fans <:ZweiHug:672455346949980170>
what kind of help?
for some it's needing a break and the extra step of needing to rejoin allows them to not be immediately drawn back in
small numbers for some on this server <:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
joined but within a minute apparently deleted...huh
Maybe they were afraid of chaos competition with the quartet
<:ZweiHug:672455346949980170>
yet most shem fans only care much about her when she is miku, checkmate
Your regular source of miku brain and being annoyed at Nintendo
Shows you don't follow Jake's twitter <:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
Oh no <:MikuFear:642799630605615114>
so I cut you in half and you fall down a hole only to show up again years later in a tv show?
says another newbie <:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>

checked mutal servers after seeing that kanade emote, hi ghost <:HibikiFingerguns:688429715836502063>
Irl? maybe, here? nope
We have a Lily surplus
Another one has joined the server, at least a different spelling lol <:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
If you get them hooked and they're a nightowl, very easy for "a few episodes a night" to become half a season plus lol
Oh hey, what I did last January and what my sister ended up doing with me over spring break lol
It exists, but all the regs and staff left
Valk died like months ago
Oh yeah, the discord isn't on the sidebar when using old reddit
maybe given their pfp they were upset at no Ver role <:Ver:704169051391524875>
there are plenty of gays here (I'm not one) and plenty of night owls here (I am one)
Hi! Glad you've brought your friend in on the ride. <:HibikiFingerguns:688429715836502063>
A friendly acquaintance from some other gear servers. <:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
Forgot you weren't even on this server Baka, welcome. <:HibikiHi:336657249827028993>
I first watched a year ago, but yeah, despite looking through anime all year it's still on top for me <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
Thighs or not, really liking the overall look.
cool and cute at the same time
I really need to give fun lighting with lego pictures a try again
At this point might just start attaching 2 "hand" pieces with half beams
Yeah
Just sad ccbs barely had any socket to socket pieces
Actually pretty at least one of the 2 of those pieces has a all crack already lol
symphogear music (mainly the seaosn 1 op) gave me the drive to finish this bionicle last month (styled after waves crashing onto the rocks)-
nah, look at the back foot "heels in the sky, western spy" (to me looks more like a cowboy up against a fence)
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuoKNZjr8_U
seeing the wip images I thought it was just a drawing, but it's actually a functional puppet, nice work!
still looks pretty cool
a very determined look there
nice and calm :)
don't really know much about blaze blue, but from the looks of it you picked the right character to give chris colors to :)
don't really know anything about maplestory, but she looks quite cute, nice work
is that a spear with a grabbing device?
Love the expressions
nice work!
Nice!
as someone with little knowledge of gundam but has played a lot of warframe, the white and gold just makes me think "gundam prime"
though the kitchen that becomes a fridge robot is pretty cute too
ah, yeah, prob my favorite
which one?
each month had a theme like "double decker", "ordinary to extraordinary" (both self explanatory), "love ma and pa" (something you could gift to parents), and "spaceship spaceship" (spaceship that could hold 2)
sine I brought it up in general chat, here's my entries to that 2014 lego contest I have uploaded- https://www.flickr.com/photos/endfilms/albums/72157645737698072
cool bot
both versions look great
less wide-eyed after losing her weapons huh?
yup
like the longer the contest deadline, the fewer entries are made lol
ty, was joking around lol. lack of actually animating is a common thing to joke about among lego animators
so now you know when I upload... 1-2 times a year lol
15 fps with easing in and out does wonders
and here's some older ones made in a week each- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uANPBl87dls https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKhhIRKNW5A
I don't think I've shared my lego animations on here, so to start here's one I made for a 24 hour contest this January- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmNJdFzbdG4
cute!
tall boi
still pretty clean and smooth looking :)
nice work!
I mean it kinda already is for us kanade fans
reference- confident killer, sketch- she's staring down someone who made Anya cry <:ChrisEnraged:423196924368388105>
not her dad, but close enough
https://youtu.be/zPOYkJsrewU?t=106
now I'm think of the gag from the most recent gigguk video making fun of the neck length in that ballet anime <:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
well if it's like GM's its life expectancy isn't great when on camera <:GenjuroLaugh:689563633516150872>
at least they put some thought into end of life and left behind rental servers and made everything acquirable with grind currency when mtx where removed
a fellow Kanade AND Dirty Bomb fan? amazing! (guess we like cool things that die <:HibikiSad:738234648509022368> )
yeah, from how tired she looks in that, no wonder it's the last one for the night <:HibikiTired:422925410490253313>
dirty bomb ev I displayed at a 2017 lego convention (only just recently copied the pics off my old iphone 4s though)-
since I haven't really finished anything besides animation sets and a few bionicles in the past few years
also this was from my mid 2010's lego building peak, I've fallen off since then <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
they prob can get in touch with professional lego designers if they wanted to these days, given there is an official Horizon Forbidden West set
so while sorting out my lego mess I found the last remaining section (the tail) of a model I built years ago for a fan contest to make a mech for a single piece lego creature (I chose the scorpion), so I thought I'd post those old pics
looking quite cool
lol, the gundam evo page just spells out the turn a instead of using the goofy character https://gundamevolution.com/unit/10 <:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
though saying "turn a" out loud doesn't sound too goofy
oh yeah, that sounds better
yeah, like "gone astray" but when the word is alone with no context it just sounds like ashtray
but still goofy character names is one thing, but giving a whole show a goofy name is another
oh now I'm remembering the duo Denim and Gene <:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
why did they pick a name that sounds like "ashtray"?
no limbs, but she looks like she bites <:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
digger claw to get through obstacles and head mounted lasers and side mounted grenade launchers to deal with threats
was going for more of a hover tank made from a modified construction vehicle
the robot posting reminds me, when I got mine on Easter I told <@331908049822547978> I would post picks of whatever alt-build I would do and then never got around to taking pics and left it collecting dust-
white, turquoise, and lime, nice color choices :D
looking good <:HibikiFingerguns:688429715836502063>
still waiting for the hguc rx-79 g to be in stock somewhere before trying gunpla
the wonders of modern battlefield medicine <:ElfneinWeld:586027421296492585>
don't know if it's looking up at you in disappointment or it's in shock from stepping on a land mine and losing its lowwer half <:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
very cool looking scene
I like green's design the most (but I also like orange's happy face)
looks good, now I want to try making some myself in the near future <:ElsaChef:689035502673985622>
at least in the usa, like 90% of things are permanently listed as backordered/pre order with a vague shifting estimate/notify me when in stock
~~but unless it's a very generic suit good luck actually getting the one for you anywhere~~
Yeah, my favorite mobile suits are gms and/or ground units, and since the rx-79(g) isn't available anywhere (except that kinda ugly new black and orange one) I went with a type of ground gm
dom is my favorite type of zeon suit, love the head/eye design (also they tend to lack those spiked shoulders which I think are goofy on zeon suits)
first ever gunpla done <:MikuPraise:585839808765493249>
cool <:KirikaPog:605209108827734017>
cool looking energy shield <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
downloaded, will give a listen later
cute
pretty cool looking <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
didn't notice the bottom one, but it's pretty much a longer version of the middle left one I like, so I agree matt <:HibikiFingerguns:688429715836502063>
I quite like the zig zags of the middle ones
Looking cool (btw, is it supposed to look like it's inspired by a car?)
love the color scheme, also the boot design is pretty cool <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
beyond that things went fine, though one of the non-hinge rotation points on a leg is loose and one of the wires for the extended grapples doesn't stay in its hole
one of the small side armor pieces on a leg had its peg snap and get stuck in its hole, but luckily in this same order I got some quick setting plastic cement (got to fix a mistake in my rx-79g I haven't finished) so that was an easy fix
went pretty smoothly, was actually simpler than I thought
Also just noticed I forgot to put the red piece in the gun sensor, fixed that too
Fixed
Oh...well just the barrel, glad these are snap together kits <:HibikiWhoops:585839808115507222>
2nd ever completed model kit, a Juggernaut from 86 <:KirikaSalute:620069889838809089>
some of the cooler looking gadget design you've done imo (the grapple gauntlet and the headphones), and it all goes together pretty well
sci-fi dropships, got to love them <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
looking cool <:KirikaPog:605209108827734017>
atm I'm taking things one at a time. One exception is I put my rx-79g build on hold while I wait for a replacement piece (my request was accepted, it will just take a while to arrive)
so you hope <:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
as someone who got a pre-owned kit will still sealed baggies for a good price recently, thank you kit hoarders <:GenjuroLaugh:689563633516150872>
then there are less common but still pretty common ones like AFOL (adult fan of lego) and SNOT (studs not on top)
yeah, MOC is probably the most common acronym in the Lego community
love the wings
going through my pictures and found a real nice one I took while walking around at college years ago
thin socks or tights stretched around a frame (like a hanger) can also be a diy pop filter
it's two thin mesh layers you put between mouth and mic
this is a pop filter
a pop filter isn't something that would be in a phone or mic
I guess you can try to just not speak directly into the mic <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
yeah, a pop filter would be a bit awkward on a phone
ah
voice sounds nice <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>  (though in the future might want a pop filter to reduce those "breath hitting mic" sounds)
shame they never made a rocket pod variant kit
jealous both of your grapple lines stay in their holes
on another note, do you have all 3 juggernaut model kit variants in the corner of the image?
someday I should get the white mech, always thought it was cool
oh yeah, got that orange tank as a gift back in the day, loved it
pretty much if you made it but it's not symphogear related you can put it here
yeah Rakshi, they come in the same colors as the toa (and the one yellow one from the stars line)
what it's based on-
made this last year for bionicle day
Nice <:GenjuroThumbsUp:336657189475188740>
cute work as always <:GenjuroThumbsUp:336657189475188740>
ok
I don't care about transformers <:TsubasaSmug:585839805737467920>
also the original planes look cooler without the attachments imo
I'm satisfied on macross models for now
after a lot of procrastination and headache my vf-31j is done <:MikuPraise:585839808765493249>
sounds nice <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
probably going to transform it into gerwalk mode after I add a few more decals
the protag one from delta
Haven't done most of the decals yet, but the vf-31j is assembled <:HibikiTired:422925410490253313>
looks fine... *sees "NEHT" instead of "NEXT"* <:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
Gave it the Emma's unit 1 stickers since I wanted the cooler color scheme but didn't want it to be a bad guy unit <:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
finished the gundam mk.II tonight
looking cool <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
now I'm thinking of xv-style chris doing suppressing fire with a minigun in one hand while picking of certain targets with a revolver in the other <:ChrisBang:702166093065748500>
never thought about Chris holding a different weapon in each hand, looks really cool <:ChrisHappy:660870796696223744>
He did build and hang up airplane model kits as a kid though
This was his first time doing gunpla, I've been living alone my whole time doing gunpla
Built an entry grade gundam with my dad tonight <:GenjuroThumbsUp:336657189475188740> (he built the legs and waist while I built the rest)
Wow, nice job! <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720> Loved the energy this had.
Cool! <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
the primary color fade unicorn amuro logo is definitely cool looking
yeah, definitely has a more showy look <:GenjuroLaugh:689563633516150872>
TIL, while beam sabers won't fit, you can cut off some of their runner and that will fit the barrel
are those spaceships that combine into a mech? <:MikuWhoa:670502684692054042>
haven't ever panel lined yet
so what kit did decide on building?
cool foot
and the same year I made a lego version of the EV (the payload objective you had to repair and escort)
then I made this for a summer art contest in 2017
since I brought up some dirty bomb art today, here's a piece I made for a community holiday art contest in 2016-
<@954207824248967188>
looking cool <:HibikiFingerguns:688429715836502063>
Also like the head cam above the v-fin
Cool looking anti-material rifle <:MikuWhoa:670502684692054042>
Got around to finishing my HG GM Sniper II (and at the end had the idea to pull out some sticky tack and back mount its rifle <:GermainCool:736523122324275309> )
Looking cool <:MikuWhoa:670502684692054042>
just its own little orange runner
love how they just through a little construction mech into the gm sniper kit
bored, built little dude
never have watched ibo but that is the one ibo kit I'm interested in
it is ibo
I don't sand, but I do take a lot of time trying to minimize the nubs (repeat nipper uses, fingernail rubbing, maybe pull out the exacto knife)
true
Nice <:GenjuroThumbsUp:336657189475188740>
cooler with each update
Looking cool <:HibikiFingerguns:688429715836502063>
scrawny eva's vs chad jaeger <:GenjuroLaugh:689563633516150872>
never really liked hand painting tbh
well since I'm thinking of completely changing the color scheme and not little detail stuff spraypaint is what I'm planning on
also my parents are stationed in Hawaii so I wont have to worry about winter weather for painting outdoors
Yeah, have only painted wood and paper before, painting kit parts will be something fun and new
Though back to how I build, while I'm mainly a pure straight builder, I'm considering painting a kit with my dad when I visit. I have an EWAC Zack I haven't built yet I'm tempted to give more realistic colors (swap the blues for greys)
also probably incentivizes completionist collectors to buy more than just UC, given how prominent the numbers are on the box
ah, the gold band that's meaningless to me lol
but apparently this site mixes all the HG lines into 1
well the line is HGCE
oh yeah, found it via that, weird how the categories work
did it get made a normal release later then? since this isn't a p-bandai box and is sold on western gunpla sites with restocks
also tried to find if they also did the windam and no luck
skipped around, looked at a rx-79 g, a strike, and the cold weather gm from 0080
I don't panel line, and if I ever did it would be limited and in grey. So thick black lines everywhere doesn't really show what I'd be getting and displaying.
and very aggressively with black
all the images I saw had thick marker use
Looked it up. Wow this website is ancient looking. And doesn't have the kit names in english, and they seem to not show how the kit looks straight built. Does have a lot of kits though.
well with MGK I also just like the videos, sometimes have them as background and watch stuff for kits I have no interest in
well I just checked his review before buying to make sure it was at least decent quality, taste wise I was already set on it, mass production suit with the rear of a fighter jet as a backpack <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytR44A29rz4  gave it gold tier
yeah, not in yet, but I ordered this when I saw it come back in stock https://www.usagundamstore.com/products/hgce-1-144-232-gat-04-windam?variant=31511266623524
was in same tip of tongue boat myself, googling to refresh my memory "tsf- tactical surface fighter"
Yeah it's a mech from muv-luv, the protag's from total eclipse.
also no stickers/decals were included/used. All the markings in the pics came pre-printed on the parts, was a nice surprise. <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
finished my first non-bandai kit tonight <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
pretty cool <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>  (also that spinny disk is fun looking)
Next step is waiting for Bandai to actually ship parts requests to their US distributor so I can get the replacement part I need for my rx-79g I bought months ago
shield go brrrrrt <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
The goo looks cool, and I love their mildly goofy expression. :)
been sitting on that method without finishing anything with it since around when I found gear lol <:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611> https://twitter.com/ENDfilms44/status/1482474952049795072
yeah, that was actual the main inspiration for this (found out they fit on the end of those dome tipped projectiles and wanted to make a mech with them now no-longer held to the goofy faces of the intended heads)
finished a lego/bionicle mecha <:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592> (complete with jet pack, machine gun, and flip-out wrist saw)
very cool looking
Fun <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
nice <:GenjuroThumbsUp:336657189475188740>
not going to be doing the upfront investment of airbrushing, been looking at spray can tutorials
Love my sister but she doesn't get any of my Lego, she has her own <:Ver:704169051391524875>
Made a card for my sister's christmas gift <:ChrisHappy:660870796696223744>
Not as cool as the clear one, but happy to have a Lfrith now <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
I built all but the shield and backpack today on my normal lfrith
Lucky! <:KirikaPog:605209108827734017>
I need to get around to watching more of that, I have the franchise on BD (got it on sale this summer)
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
dangerzone intensifies <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ9-PFes3mM <:GenjuroLaugh:689563633516150872>
very cool wings <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
The squad leader always says "stay frosty" <:GenjuroLaugh:689563633516150872>
Also due to no extra visor sticker I used masking tape and sharpies <:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
Cut out the spare parts of my EWAC-Zack and made a blue Hi-Zack (the runner had a spiked shoulder too, I just don't like spiked shoulders)
Woosh! Boom!
built the ewac zack I brought with me, fun kit but it definitely shows it age with how loose some things are (knees suck at dealing with the big head and some flaps in the back like falling out)
(0083 one doesn't count, looks more like a Guncannon than a GM Cannon)
really wish they put out an actual GM Cannon kit that wasn't limited/p-bandai <:HibikiTired:422925410490253313>
off brand GM *Cannon* <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
there do seem to people selling water slide sheets (idk if official or custom) for HG/RG Aile Strike on ebay for like $5-10
they do sell water slides standalone for some RG and MG kits, but I can't find any for the RG Aile Strike/Perfect Strike among the SEED ones. <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
Ah, no part swapping needed for you <:GenjuroThumbsUp:336657189475188740>
what's the plan with the 4 and 2 barb kits?
And most sets look good ignoring the stickers
At least they are better quality stickers than most model kits <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
Oh the light blue shark? Nice. <:GenjuroThumbsUp:336657189475188740>
What set?
Yeah, protag ships (0079, Unicorn, etc.)
A Jegan from the best UC faction. <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720> 
~~Also this grunt is more likely to bring you home for pasta than more "advanced" mobile suits.~~
the small arms part of the army you could say <:GenjuroLaugh:689563633516150872>
the barb army is forming <:Ver:704169051391524875>
The ball and socket attachment of the legs to the hip is stiff and more willing to pop off than move, upper leg to knee hinge is stiff, and there is only hinges on the entire leg, so no rotation.
Entry grade built, fun simple build that looks good, but clunky leg/hip articulation.
And a small tree
Had plenty of parts left after that so made another ship
Got a polar bear set, made a sci-fi fighter instead <:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
The dark grey rubbery pieces that come on their own runners mainly used for joints
while also still having the full extent of posability unlike the no-polycap entry grades <:GenjuroThumbsUp:336657189475188740>
Love the second pose <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Love mechs with boxy missile pods <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>

It's the windam's fighter jet style pack
(poor wing-less windam in the corner)
<@954207824248967188> gave my entry grade strike my only striker pack <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
You going to get the ~~riot control~~ spec ops version when that comes?
Even in plastic he always loses <:Ver:704169051391524875>
My dad asked me if their was any small wood projects I'd like to do with him while I was visiting, decided to do a wood base for my action base <:GenjuroThumbsUp:336657189475188740>
Does this character wear a hat at times? Since I think I've seen people use it as an avatar on steam
Still offbrand, just not knockoff, like how Mega is not knockoff
Was more saying if I end up with one someday, not that I'd go out of my way for it. Though if I was to go out of my way I'd get the version of the kit with the gm head and the hover vehicle, instead of the parachute pack.
Might give it a GM head at some point if I ever get a OYW era GM
And yes, I gave it Karen's number (082)
This was my 2nd gunpla purchased but due to a long wait for a replacement part, my 12th finished <:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
So does that make the funny animation when distressed a newtype power? <:GenjuroLaugh:689563633516150872>
oh yeah, you're working on a recreation of a room of yours right?
also that style of legs is common for those
ah, the adjustable one of the left made me think standing desk
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUtOljZlgH4
Forgot Kreo called their minifigures "Kreons" <:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
Now she needs a Takina <:HibikiFingerguns:688429715836502063>
made this in 2021
I do really like their Halo figures
yeah, Mega Construx has pretty much settled in to just making things with their licenses instead of going head to head with Lego (at least that means Halo building toys exist because Lego wouldn't have touched a franchise filled with M-rated games)
at least mega bloks (now mega construx for their lego-scale bricks) has put in the effort to up their quality a lot in the past serval years so at least their stuff *looks* lego quality (the bricks do stick a bit too hard if you need to take apart though)
speeen
I hear the g-witch music <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
and yeah, the gwitch kits have been pretty solid designs from what I've seen and the one I built
jealous of the translucent lfrith <:KirikaPog:605209108827734017>
<@321773912322998285> while looking through that op, some "Walkure" symbol variants as options as well
<@321773912322998285>
let me look up a frame of a macross character doing that "imagining flying" shape
impressive <:GenjuroThumbsUp:336657189475188740>
How many cosplays are you doing in a single week? <:ShemHaWhat:929756727493132288>
little boy
yeah, looks like you guys are having a lot of fun <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
Yeah, me and Blockio have different opions on Delta, but we at least both like the music <:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
I like Delta, but yeah Gear is the better sci-fi show about singing girls animated by Satelight <:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
https://tenor.com/view/macross-delta-gif-22343464
https://tenor.com/view/macross-delta-thumbs-up-mecha-vf31-gif-20164342
Delta (the Macross my image was from) does have female singers who can transform their clothes (though since it's scifi, it's holograms not magic) and their song can counteract a condition that makes people go berserk. Then there's also people in plane mechs helping them. <:HibikiFingerguns:688429715836502063>
that looks amazing, the pose, the effects, the drawing in general
guns and preferring bread to sushi, the most american of the gear users
takanuva
really like the hibiki they did last year- https://twitter.com/Kalhiki/status/1455711415701020673
followed this person before I knew of the show because bionicle twitter and some cool art, then it turns out they've done symphogear fan art
https://twitter.com/Kalhiki/status/1490859321466376193
so yeah, the only thing left of future episodes is comments on plans from chats he's been in
also he uses "was" when talking about his ideas
well due to an increase in anime copyright strikes the past month all his videos are on private
it pretty much is, most of the va's have gone on to be busy with careers on top of life stuff, also he's at the point where he's talked about "where it would have gone" with people in dm's and on other servers
discordgear, that abridged series canceled after episode one pretty much did that and was hated for it
Well I've visited my dad on a navy ship before lol, lots of low doorways
And us tall people can become stupid by bonking our heads all the time.
oh no
instead of gear fragments to the chest she got hit my gravity powers in the stomach
I really like the color scheme, especially how her gauntlets look in blue
best part of the axz intro
found link for ghost hug- https://twitter.com/ai_chocoice/status/1137740853932199936
is the ghost hug one tsubasa, alt kanade and their dead partners? If so that hits hard
a mom can help with their kid's tie, but also with the husband's tie ;)
I mean, this is the symphogear fandom, majority of people are doing ships and few that remain are all about cute family dynamics, and this works for both ;)
she might still want the experience of being helped out each morning ;)
maria using her mom energy to help with a tie
wow been years since I first saw that art
at the same time
yup, or combing samus and zero suit samus
I like character outfits to either be sleek or tactical/armored, and gear users provide both :)
just looking through the replies of that tweet and seeing all the goofy stuff from japanese spider man: a mech, pulling out an smg, etc. lol
https://twitter.com/ThunderGotch/status/1491388407150690304
Comfy
tbh I prob only noticed because I was focused on the cute miku hibiki and kanade tsubasa dynamics and then saw pink hair
early g school chris, must hide
you can barely see chris lol
yay, twitter is loading again so I can see cute tsubasa
yup, tried to catch up on the art posts I missed and twitter is down
https://twitter.com/sorto1221/status/1493370063973347329

who needs to worry about that act mode delay when people can build their own hibiki- https://twitter.com/nananichibonze/status/1019933535199584262
https://twitter.com/nananichibonze/status/1131974701494890496
https://twitter.com/LEGOdouMoko/status/1184458135664091136
but hey, the image posted in here is pre-watermark
but films of significance (placed in a contest, etc.) or considered at risk are often ripped from youtube and put in the archive even if they still exist on youtube
like you can see old youtube pages but since the video is pretty much streamed it's likely not archived
it wasn't youtube stuff, that is only being saved if people downloaded it already, these were pre-youtube animations so they were uploaded to file sharing sites as mov/wmv/rm/rmvb files so if those download pages got saved by archive.org they sometimes worked
glad some members of the community created an archival project so now those animations are both saved on google drive and few volunteer's hard drives
I remember in 2014 I spent hours digging through archive.org to find working downloads of lego animations that were lost (from either copyright takedowns on abandoned channels or wannabe film students thinking they're "too old" to show off their lego stuff)
why I download most online art I like, anything can be deleted at any time
yup, got revealed recently
that last one is just the box art of the cd set
given kanade likes to lovingly pick on tsubasa I could see her joking about tsubasa liking ogawa and also joke about him cleaning up her clothes if she lived
https://twitter.com/wild_cat144/status/1497010819762204673
or just cover it in dust and throw it in a random corner to make it tsubasa's
yeah, twitter has "translate tweet" built in, might not be perfect but it will get you basic understanding
so how many hibiki's do we have? We have manga biki, anime biki, xdu biki and xdu biki (another). any more?
miku looking tired driving a group of crazy kids, that's peak mom energy
yeah that's big sister energy, not mom energy
that expression and her being the one driving has miku taking the "mom" role away from maria
yeah the only way I could see those heels working is, since these are supposed to swimsuit gears, the protective field could possibly be giving some invisible extra surface area, but still looks silly
https://symphogear.fandom.com/wiki/Swimsuit_Type_Gear_Event
the wiki does have higher res of each group of 3 with no background, but the full image is the same rez
and this emote- <:MikuCute:672908542763859968>

I mean miku playing a card came at the end of axz gave us the cutest miku reaction
always nice to see gear user miku with headgear that doesn't look like bear trap
I'm a fan of the miku art myself
also not a gif, but found a still of that chris image
looked through the person's twitter to see if anything of that pink hair girl with hibiki showed up, looks like the game is "assault lily last bullet" and it's from a collab from late last year/early this year
and yet she still couldn't control them like maria can with the cape (unless you count her wings as them in x-drive)
would be weird for the verse that is mainly helped by main universe maria to suddenly have an unknown maria show up, but I guess could be a good twist not of maria being fine but suspicions of ryoko by main verse gears not being at all true
kanadeverse has ryoko, just one who either hasn't or hasn't fully been fine possesed, also don't think there's a maria in that verse
are there any universes with maria but without a ryoko for fine to posses first and without a hibiki to change fine's ways? as that would prob be the best option
I mean he is the closest relative she has left (that isn't a monster) and he practically was her parental figure post gear activation
and Ogawa was the planner
tbh hibiki could just be the flower girl for a tsubasa wedding
now if only every gear user had as dedicated a fan as you for hibiki in here, everything symphogear in sfw would be labeled lol
though sometimes simps can be useful, I know before hand if a link is for hibiki art because topmac will always reply with "<:HibikiGay:670494484701773845>"
hit "translate tweet" read "kiri-chan" but my brain just thought of this- https://youtu.be/envC-DZpp3s?t=11
also there's the thing of finding cool art, going to a profile and that was their only sfw piece
but then there are those times on art sites where there are cool 18+ labeled things things that aren't straight up porn, or sometimes not even sexual
I only look at pixiv stuff if it's linked here, since actually searching for stuff there just ends up being a porn minefield, like deviantart but with higher average quality
the rare japanese artist who draws anime fan art that's not publicly corrupted by gacha
it actually was mostly art with some food
when someone ended up posting something from that artist earlier today I ended up scrolling through like 2 years worth of their media tab lol, good stuff
mac has hibiki sense, he can survive without pings
I will always be a strong hibiki miku supporter, but even then, miku and chris' friendship deserved more screentime
https://twitter.com/golden_nabe/status/1504466810690711556
I haven't sorted my symphogear fan art folder in over a week and now I'm scared to lol
orb
sphere
I've heard people guess that since purses were common with women before pants were, pants makers just assumed women would want to keep carrying things in purses
my sister prob misses the days before puberty where she just wore my hand me down boys shorts
compared to mens pants/shorts
but on average
women in pants are cool, shame their pockets suck at actually being pockets (at least that's what my sister says)
also some chris looking hair next to hibiki
the guy who was going to adopt chris...
the father figure she calls "old man"?
I can understand Tsubasa Ogawa stuff, but Gen Chris...
oh... didn't notice that <:MikuCute:672908542763859968>
yeah, a multirole fighter
the F-35 is also a fighter but it also mainly attacks ground targets using stealth
even if its main role was usually bombing ground targets
F does mean fighter
speaking of muscle, besides that gym one that's been posted twice this week, anyone got any more art of hibiki with muscles?
yeah fine prob wants her god to be worshipped, while shem is the one who wants to be worshipped
she was a priestess so that makes sense
i'm surprised how many xdu assets are just put on deviantart lol
cool symphogear shaker
was their an FIS chaplain?
yeah, did FIS provide religious facilities?
though she was raised in America so she could be any number of denominations lol
maria with that "only one in the house who can tie a tie properly" mom energy
I prefer tie tying-
cool art, info on kanade, and a great meme? what's not to love?
now I'm thinking of "my face is my face" in that neil cicierega song
3_skip yeah from that hibiki/kanade info page-
3_skip
and one based on G- https://www.pixiv.net/en/artworks/65061938
oooo, fan art based on season 1- https://www.pixiv.net/en/artworks/64169518
yeah, the one falling off the cheek is the only one that isn't blending in to the light skin
there is sweat, white "U"s and "o"s
I think I just doubled the amount of pictures in my hibiki miku folder
source does have one sad miku speedbump but then comes back with kanade hibiki energy then goes back to cute hibiki miku
I now have a smile on my face
"kiva (audi2434)" is the given creator and the kanji for the user name for the 1st result appears to translate to "kiva" as well
3_skip well since reverse image search seems to recognize it I gave it a check and here's some leads-
the internet may never forget, but is does lose things quite often
and this is why I download most art I see online that I like
https://twitter.com/makibikeisi/status/1507350277300842496
speaking of miku gear versions, I want amalgam miku to be official
though gugnir miku is pretty cool too
track miku with determined face makes me smile
3_skip
that and that one pole vault memoria are the only track miku art I can remember seeing
also school uniform miku gets relatively a lot of love, but I need more track miku
me when I find cute miku art-
also hibiki miku posting is superior to maria posting <:MikuCute:672908542763859968>
ok, let me try my luck with you maria fan one more time, training outfit maria art
but yeah maria is one of those characters I don't really care about their default look but like their transformations
CRAP, already have this one
sorry but my xdrive/amalgam subfolder in my maria folder is lacking
either way I should probably sort out my fan art folders before I start going out of my way to find more art lol
speaking of folders, had to put sub folders in my character folders because some where filling up to much for easy art finding
ah, wouldn't mind seeing more kanade tsubasa or hibiki miku art tbh
maria fans so obsessed they have a separate group chat lol <:KanadeWink:690470895608791040>
eye candy
3_skip though even if she made it, fudo is prob the one who needs the bonk-
yeah pretty sure she did thinking back to it
oh yeah
this was shem's chosen look-
yeah, the faust robe was the one fudo chose to use to contain shem (though prob made by some random alchemist)
shem didn't make that outfit though... <:FudouEyes:672846284725682195>
hibiki and miku, have great charm points but all they care about are each other's warmth <:MikuCute:672908542763859968>
I think the artist posted what tsubasa and chris are saying but nothing beyond that
though the most emotional fan art I've seen is miku without hibiki-
I need more wing duo art though
glad we have the bot with how small the versions you post of those are lol
child hibiki is so cute
the rarest of art though, pre-deadbeat top dad-
and it's all about her finding friends/family!
though sometimes you see wholesome art and then you stumble onto the fact that was their one sfw piece
whenever I see cool art with a pixiv source in this channel I then go and check the artist's symphogear tag, how I fill my art folder
yup


I also like the variants for other characters from that artist
in my folder found art with running, gear, and hibiki miku all in one
except beartrap helmet, I'm fine if that's forgotten
also props to the artist for those awesome fan designs
while I'm loving the kanade posting, going to go make some curry for dinner now
yeah, if you want to see online media again, download it, the internet may never forget but it often loses things
also twitter prob has a greater chance of finding new viewers
well to be fair it's less well known, especially in the west, I didn't know of pixiv till joining this server
so many google image results for kanade art are reposts of this guy's stuff but his twitter is protected :(
anything kanade is cool <:KanadeWink:690470895608791040>


lots of great art in this dump, though Kalhiki's new Kanade is still prob my favorite of today <:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
I stay away from the nsfw channel but do what you want
saved by the folder it appears
ooo sirius kanade
wow multiple xdrive kanade that doesn't have the colors look bad
got any gear kanade?
please do
I mean we even got cool new kanade art today- https://twitter.com/Kalhiki/status/1508249037245456385
the "color me kanade"s are doing well tonight
love the second one!
ah, some cool "not quite gear but not quite normal clothes" art, love this stuff
think there was like 2 from that dump
guess season 1 gear tsubasa is just rare
most of these aren't even season 1, still cool though
got plenty of s1 singer, especially with kanade
I meant s1 gear, sorry for the vagueness
ty!
speaking of season 1, I've noticed my fan art folder is lacking in S1 Tsubasa, got any good ones?
yeah, the eating too I guess
3_skip also maybe this thing-
guess her general look, particularly when slumped over and tired
3_skip yeah hibiki being shown as a chick officially has been a thing since the s1 manga
love the chick pajamas

her 2 gungnir wives in this image <:KanadeWink:690470895608791040>

S1 gear best gear <:HibikiGay:670494484701773845>

"I am a god you foul creature!" (gets beat up by rage hibiki) "puny god"
I'm now imaging the hulk and loki scene from avengers but hibiki instead of hulk
though you could always mod a custom viewmodel in as long as you're playing on community servers
sadly, even when cross game references were added to tf2, it was only for games coming coming to steam (the quake rl was added to promote quake 4 coming to steam)
nah, links work fine, talking about the stuff from the embed command (what DasAntihero posted)
shame my discord settings mean I can't see any art posted with embed :P

end goal is befriend? no wonder people draw fanart with her and hibiki together
yeah, there's a reason I download every piece of art I like
I just stumbled across this when searching for the actual kanade cd cover, it was a repost on pintrest from a deleted blogspot with not luck in reverse image search :(

I love how the bionicle community embraced googly eye tahu, I now have a whole folder of related images

hibiki and maria in their best civilian looks, the workout gear :D
so that would prob be the glatorian from like 2009/2010
was it an arena in a desert?
and the content starved bionicle fandom just embraced and ran with it
it's in the vid but, while lego chose castle instead of bionicle from the top polled themes for a lego 90th anniversary set, images came out of a basic bricks set that celebrates the anniversary that had small scale brick-build versions of old sets from lego's history, including a googly eye tahu-
yeah, it's even still one of the bigger sections at one of the bigger lego fan conventions
a series that died twice but the community lives on...
also surprised there are quite a bit of overlap between japanese symphogear fans and japanese bionicle fans
yup
guessing this is the video you mentioned, tbh I didn't get the move along love till this video- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RTRgrXOIBWU


googly guy
bohrok
the googly spirit robot

life sized carol sculpture
maybe lego is the hobby elfnein needs to stop being as much of a workaholic <:ElfneinWeld:586027421296492585>
or maybe chris is just "mom"
idk, the more blunt chris might go for the shorter mama
which is mommy and which is mama?
https://twitter.com/funimon/status/1512147175576260616
love how this looks, especially the boots and gauntlets
why is it so hard for rp accounts to just tag the artist or give some form of credit....
totally forgot about the fudo torture discussion
kanade is always smug
found it, when I first glanced at it I though it was an out of order height comparison
think I once saw fan art comparing bust size and the top 2 were the tsubasa partners
swords technically aren't either
just need the right amount of curve for lift
or a wing
well she is much bigger overall so they stand out less
ratio to body size chris probably has the biggest though
tbh I thought the rosey cheeks were scrapes (like how a scraped knee looks) because of the lines, so it looked even more like there is domestic abuse in the relationship
ah, earlier discussions about the collection didn't bring that up lol
stop teasing your collection access lol
tbh this is the first time I've seen song uniform kanade art

yeah, prob my fav too

It's a daycare, could just be working parents
scared chris hiding behind her scared senpai who's hiding behind her senpai
besides being cute, I love how many people have to double check to notice chris

Jaga style AU in XDU when?
also good kanade tsubasa
nah, talking about her original gear headset when it's not being a visor
tbh the pumpkin looks better than the actual open beartrap headset
oh jake is here, have a funny miku


anyway, gugnir duos
idk, I dropped that show after like episode 8, couldn't stand the pervert tropes with the teacher and family, also the friend was annoying
more serious gugnir trio
who knows
they can all be smol though
as usual I look through the sources of art posted and I found this cute image of the gugnir duo-
never said you weren't a fan, just saying you couldn't hold it back anymore <:KanadeWink:690470895608791040>
doing my post log-on sfw browse and am happy to see mommaria enjoyer fell into kanade posting again <:KanadeSmile:672455286392356884>
apex kanade
especially ones of a certain character or pair
nah, art dumps are common in sfw
come on chris, tsubasa already views herself as a metal tool, you don't need to reinforce that lol <:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>



that manga info page does say kanade is the strongest, just her fighting time is limited
gen with gear and kanade living, the banned op things

I have braincells, I just can't control them enough to be useful
if anything, this is just a result of pirate fine being a thing in axz being unexpected
do you never rewatch or look up things again?
being reminded of good art can be nice though
oh yeah, stupid mistakes hit hard and stick in your head
I don't have much else to
https://twitter.com/Yoko_Yukine04/status/1516990312186589185
translucent like frosted glass would prob be a way to put it
it's the same suit, just the body suit is...lighter colored
and I only know that from watching TE because it showed up in my "because you watched" section on crunchyroll and looked cool
yeah, looks like MuvLuv
I mean the world would probably be a better place if they kept with sports
yeah, but coat chris with gun is cooler than suit chris
that's a very cool chris!
i'll need to skim the translated ones again and see if I can find og dj chris
like these?
the chibi ones?
how did dj chris become a thing anyway? <:ChrisDJ:690470897194369034>
tbh I would have never thought of putting kirika clothes on miku, but that looks quite nice
of course they day I hold off on checking this channel there's tons of good symphogear art I haven't seen, so many tabs open lol

though my favorite comfy looking outfits from the series are the hibiki miku pajama shirts
the workout gear is the best of those outfits, true
also I just like the outfits the characters had in the axz op
though speaking of maria duos  art without tsubasa, workout hibiki and maria-
they a more reasonable american eastern time resident than me lol
pretty sure they are asleep at this time
the only one I have in my duos folder, and it's not that gay-
tbh I've barely seen any maria chris art
so maria and tsubasa
the real question is, what other character are they being peeping toms on, and what is that character doing they are so hyped about?
nah, they are being kept out
speaking of kanade and maria, love gungnir trio art-
tbh I'm surprised how much kanade art is with either of the eve sisters
which is my duos folder for all kanade stuff without tsubasa (wing) or hibiki (gungnir)
more stuff for the "kanade +" folder
i'm aware of that lol, was more saying what I've encountered than when I was looking for
initially put that in my duos folder then noticed little hibiki in the back lol

and since they label all the their art with their @ it almost feels like taunting you can't follow them
shame it's only reposts around since the twitter is limited access and the pixiv is gone
ah, the art from the hidden kanade art maker, linkleft
very cute
I mean she shows up as nude a lot in season 1, even the op
2 ones I hadn't seen before, noice
but yeah, purple and single center eye so the tiki goggles have that look lol
prob most mainstream depiction was the more recent suicide squad movie
dc comic villain, an alien star fish that latches onto people's faces and mind controls them
other people wearing the tiki goggles just gives me starro vibes <:MariaScared:672584661125431299>
https://twitter.com/hibiyakaren/status/1518730386557509632
you're improving <:KanadeWink:690470895608791040>
this is symphogear daycare
3_skip oh there's gen with the kids too
on a cuter note

"if you guys keep spending all your time in my apartment I'll make you start paying rent"
the miku from that source is great

though I'm a bigger fan of "chris as a mom" (even if it's just this one comic I can't find page 2 of)
I've seen these, didn't realize it was her mom lol
chris' mom, now that's a rare folder
though steps 1 and 3 can take a good chunk of time and losts of tabs lol
best way to find good symphogear art- step 1. browse this channel, step 2. locate art you like, step 3. browse the source for more <:MikuJoy:738234684655403110>
love the mug in the first one btw

more song miku
found a good hibiki miku xdrive
hey, taking things literally is my job here <:KanadeAngry:672861874966233118>
that's not a couple, that's slave and master
tbh, all the season 1 couples make me smile
nothing gets "color me miku" users going more (besides miku) than edgebiki

also, people where talking earlier about wanting more miku in song uniform?
also miku wearing my favorite clothes in the series, the hibiki pajamas, is lovely
just finished catching up with the miku posting <:MikuCute:672908542763859968>
tbh thought it was a gmod animation till the transform

yet the one anime I've seen with a woman with a wrapped length of front hair, they are the only survivor of episode 1 (though they took on that style at the end of episode 1)
so just because anime hates house wives apparently anyone with a housewife look are joked to be going to die?
so these jokes aren't connecting for me lol
tbh the only anime character I've seen with the style is the main gal in muv-luv total eclipse, and she lived

the creativity anniversary tahu sparked in the bionicle community has brought me nothing but joy <:MikuBliss:336657233712513024>
scroll down ;)
https://twitter.com/BionicleNerdly/status/1521025090695041024
and I can't see what other joke those visuals could point towards besides maybe kid on caffeine
through it into a image translator site and that appears to be the case
I have no clue what the speech bubble says either
it's a dad level visual joke
well I'm a mono language american and I still got it
it is, but it's also the punchline ;)













and on the non-comforting basa side of this trio art-
still my favorite piece of this trio-
american raised person seeing chop sticks

something cuter then


if it was common I wouldn't have forgotten <:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
nah, just seen this a few like it before
forgot about tactical chris art <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
https://twitter.com/niwa28_kabe/status/1522083634165202945
kanatsubahibi you say?

season 1 had the best gungnir designs imo
my favorites are probably the kanade hibiki ones- https://twitter.com/Linkleft/status/835462747135434752 https://twitter.com/Linkleft/status/713735107329130496
I have now scrolled through the entire media tab
<@726218419749519400>
going on a long scroll of linkleft's media tab, found a rare type of art- kanade and her sister <:MikuCute:672908542763859968> https://twitter.com/Linkleft/status/488254562864603136
hold on, link left's twitter is public again?
twitter not so much though
most on pixiv I find have a varient
saw the wip yesterday and was excited for good kanade art
was wondering why chris was step 3
3_skip I was confused enough to throw it into an image translator (glad the text wasn't vertical as that seems to be the bane of image translator apps and sites)




but yeah, kanade biki art is great
I knew who made it but had to do some media tab digging to find the link
source- https://twitter.com/cosmokyrin/status/1489330680941072387
the chat about kanade becoming hibiki's step mom in symphogear discussion brought this to mind
https://twitter.com/keian_another/status/1523375892390907905

3_skip , the follow up to the room of bikis
represents the guy in charge of xdu in the comics
3_skip then there is the room of hibikis from the xdu chibi comics-


while you search, some hibimiku with hoodie miku-
found this one with a gear headset styled hood up
though I don't think I've seen any hoodie miku art with the hood up <:HibikiThink:688429715362414641>

even though she got an ignite, it's like her ignite, time limited in use



has some good fan art too
3_skip
also I guess kanade amalgam would be a bit redundant when she already has a dual relic setup in xdu
no, think xdu just has the xv amalgams, kanade and miku have gotten ignite and xdrive though
3_skip really want to find more fan art of shirabe with her captain america shield
from the same artist, fan design for miku amalgam
some fan kanade amalgam design


speaking of her, while I have a few bits of fan art  saved of her in amalgam barely any of them have her with her shield

yeah, zababa look good in the show's singer outfits
not bad for dying episode one and not being a major part of an arc after season 1
also looking back, kanade fans got lucky, she had minor appearances and references throughout the series and when a mobile game with au's became a thing the writers seemed to be fans of her <:KanadeSmile:672455286392356884>




once again amazed by how well kanade was done, so little time but so many fans <:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
and with Kanade fans of course you have the person who admits it in their name "Tallgoose: Lesser Kanade Simp"
idk about pings bit Blockio is also solidly in the Kanade fan club
yeah was wondering why I never got pinged when you pinged the kanade fans, I blab more about her than most lol <:KanadeWink:690470895608791040>
me, I'm always up for kanade or miku stuff, even if I don't pair them <:KanadeSmile:672455286392356884>

btw, have you gotten around to the first edgebiki story yet?
||and for her friend to come back from being dead||
awesome!
maria looking more confident than usual <:MariaSunglasses:336656798687690752>

hibiki as a little kid-
though they are also cute in any season design
lots of good season 1 style in general today in sfw
it's not just the 3, it's the 3 in season 1 style <:MikuJoy:738234684655403110>
wow, a lot of season 1 gear design posting earlier, my favorite! <:MikuPraise:585839808765493249>
it tends to do that <:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
found it mid january
oh yeah, that last is one of the best bits of kanade art
since I had no clue there was no dub
tbh I found that abridged early on in my gear experience since I was searching "symphogear dub" since gear was my first subbed anime and the dual sub tracks (dialouge and lyrics) were overwhelming me <:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66m0Kd9AVfw
that source is a whole series of season 1 art



and the duo that kicked off my love for gear that season
oh, new one for my collection <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>



time to add to the season 1 posting
idk, depends if she's more a fan of the army or marines <:ChrisBang:702166093065748500>
<:HibikiHug:620080558462205956> <:ChrisHibikiHug:630262562361049121> funny how biki chris is the one duo with 2 hug emotes on here
yeah, "hey idiot! pass me that crayon!"
but hibiki and miku are still nice to her despite that and she learns friendship eventually <:ChrisHappy:660870796696223744>
kanade art I do  not have saved/bookmarked yet <:KanadeSmile:672455286392356884>
it's just a screenshot of s1e1, sadly to properly fit what I wanted in discord's silly circle pfp's I had to show back bars

I mean if cooking manga Serena can keep the the Nephilim as a pet...

hey, noise can be cute too
shame some of these sources no longer exist <:HibikiSad:738234648509022368>

pretty cute
oh I remember those being announced

also there's some season 1 basa gear in there along side all the cute casual wear pictures
lots of great stuff in that one source <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>

on model figures, so yeah
though at least with bust size that can easily have an art use for staying on model
the blood type thing is because views around blood type and personality, right?
actually makes sense for art consistency

but then she tries her luck and pulls it out again on the moon and gets sent back to status quo
and in XV the peak of her development- she gets to actually shoot the sniper <:GenjuroLaugh:689563633516150872>
from angry child villain, to ally, to friend, to basa's follower, to carrying on being the senpai for the younger ones

yoshii dan does flow off the tongue better though imo
yeah if the japanese flip it around I don't think they'll mind if I flip it back and forth from time to time
guess since their gender isn't mentioned anywhere that I've seen my western brain tought Dan=he <:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
oh really?
also the series he's been doing this time around has been pretty cool (even if I'm not as much a suit lover as some of you)
back to art looking forward to the next yohi dan kanade b-day art
yeah, swearing is best used when it adds a punch (or is a punchline), not when it's super common
3_skip thank you commie for swearing rage biki moment
thank you translators for turning aggressive moments into swearing moments
and most of the time that is translator creative license since western style swears aren't really a thing in japanese <:Ver:704169051391524875>
like hibiki wondering if she can get miku to listen to her cd
they are mostly just show footage dubbed over, but some lines are fun
a compilation of subbed ads (including cd ads) are on the discotek bluray release of season 1
would be cool if something like that was a bonus on a full series or xv concert blu-ray release, like how how the ova's were for the original seasons
can't find it standalone, but I also like the outro art on that channel
here's the highlight that first image references- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KN5HoLpSBBk
these highlights do at least expression swap images for them- https://www.youtube.com/c/PotetoKyat/videos

I said ygg didn't know, not you <:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
apparently jpeg was just an addition as another option once operating systems started being able to accept extensions longer than 3 letters
there is no difference between them besides a literal single letter in the extension
looked it up, they are different extensions for the exact same file type, so ygg is just dumb <:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>

it in spartan colors- https://twitter.com/Jafet_Meza/status/1537933718035107840
it's a gundam mixed with spartan mk. V from halo



both animated by the same studio and both from musical sci-fi shows funny enough

tbh yuri isn't a selling point for me, any good relationship is nice to watch for me (unless it gets too lovey dovey and/or lewd)
might get to it after all the mecha on my "plan to watch" is cleared up (or if I need a mecha break and don't feel like watching more lupin the 3rd part 2 dub)
looked it up, it appears the full season is on youtube officially
looks pretty cute

glad I have seen none of the shows that trope comes from, since I like the tied hair in front look <:HibikiFingerguns:688429715836502063>
more her adjusting her back hair than tying up hair upfront
it's a bit long for that trope isn't it?

3_skip also I just remembered anime style art on military aircraft is sometimes an irl thing in japan <:KirikaSalute:620069889838809089>
well the blu-ray for the delta movie is coming in september to japan so we'll at least have imports/torrents then
plane/gerwalk mode + characters is my favorite type of macross delta art

3_skip but still, I have yet to see Maria's gear from 3 offensive spears in fanart, for example
could just be I mainly find gear art through this channel and you guys are all fans of it <:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
you guys are complaining, but phantom maria is probably the most common non-anime maria outfit I see in fan art

even in her non flight suit uniform she looks cool-
3_skip found freyja flight suit concept art
true
3_skip also you see the flight suit in product images of the model-

ah yes, them, the duo that somehow fully reset to status quo whenever they return to school <:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>

while I do get tired of "pervert" jokes pretty quickly (why I dropped kill la kill), the main thing that bugged me in fmp was none of the characters understanding/caring for each other more from the mech arcs seemed to carry over to the school arcs/episodes
maybe then I'll give the TSR a try at some point, since I liked most of fmp outside of the school "comedy" episodes that threw out any development that just happened the previous arc to keep telling the same jokes <:MikuSigh:688429722799308883>
if you cut out every school episode after the first school arc
here's some cute hibiki miku instead- https://twitter.com/gouf2016/status/1545454505994735618
like imo gear undersuits are fine (unless most comic book super heroes are nsfw), just didn't notice she was pulling on the lowwer part
wasn't that nsfw, but yeah, was a bit close to the line

the bara magna story (or even the sets) isn't bad, and the mata nui backstory and final battle it gave us was pretty good, but it was just so disconnected from the rest of the series
yeah, imo bara magna was kinda a forced extension imo
though story wise it makes sense the nuva closed things out, they were the heroes at the start of the line, and were supposed to be the ones to save the day and awaken the spirit
I like the look, I hate the lime for other reasons....<:KirikaPanic:644235681677180958>
to be fair a few of the nuva's looked nothing like their mata versions
the odd thing with 2008 kopaka is they swapped the side his scopes were on <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
3_skip though the mask probably would look better and more "gali" with both eyes


and while not executed amazingly in the set the general gali mistika design was decent
3_skip I actually really like the 2008 toa designs (but not their sockets)

well I've quite enjoyed uc, but my viewing so far has been limited to 1 year war stuff with 0083 and a few episodes of zeta on top of that

nah, been a mag main since day one (and even past that I prefer a lot of other frames to mesa)

back in the day when my main (mag) was always joked as being bad
back when the weekly conclave rewards was the only consistent way to get free potatos (also the skins where cool)
I did grind to max standing in concalve back in the day <:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>

also xdrive art is often season 1 or xv's bruning x-drive
tbh I feel G gear is actually the rarest, gx-axz gear had 2 seasons plus most of xdu's stories (so that one if definitely the most common), xv was the most recent, and season one has the nostalgia factor and longest time for art to be made




I got a folder for that

that plus no marketing around the launch, was getting ads for mobile games all the time back then on the youtube app and never saw that one come up
now what could have changed things was western marketing before the marketing crunchy did for xv
(though that was the rougher tv release)
and before crunchy it was on funimation
so I don't think the rare people who give anime first watch via a blind blu ray buy would change much
it was already free to watch on the most popular anime streaming site
I don't think an earlier bd release would have boosted the fanbase
and on the kanade side of things https://twitter.com/aokiyuki29/status/1448648509347876878  https://twitter.com/Dorag77N/status/1287353936555343872

Nah, that's not Mirage. She looks up to her grandparents, if anything her feelings of not living up to them would probably make her embarrassed to fight with him.
curious what interactions he'll have with this granddaughter
if you mean Max, yes he is in the movie
looking good, but shame it's a sequel to the retcon/compilation movie (that took away a lot of character development and tension) and not the show

that's cool how the aerial head is surrounded by gun-bits in the emblem
~~the best orange glow basa can have~~


especially basa's, the blue and black contrasting with the orange glow

AU Basa knows the importance of a comfy partner- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMj9aJvmpIM






~~tbh given how Kanade likes her shy S1 Basa I could see her falling for AU Chris instead~~
well a younger and less mature Kanade, can't see AU Basa giving Kanade style life lessons
and they were both trained by Gen (after Basa and Gen saved Chris)
AU Basa fights fast and up close while AU Chris provides supporting sniper fire while rotating around the battle
and if they were more of a well trained duo (prime basa and chris struggle because of how well their AU duo support each other in combat)
https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLsPT-xmaKRvVP89xEruzk3UUOUD-E6Z7Y
~~scarier when you remember she is a constantly moving top sniper~~
3_skip AU Chris can get pretty agro when pushed too far though




https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVcAyEMM4Cc

speaking of season 1 art

yeah, season one summed up in a few art pieces
yeah, Gen is definitely already cool uncle of the show
prime Gen and his movie loving would be amazing cool dad material
Except AU gen was a bit more training focused and movies never come up
imagine how much happier Chris would be if things went to plan and Gen adopted her instead of Fine kidnaping her <:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>

https://twitter.com/anomallite/status/1557387733798006785
but I can see that difference causing some headaches with customers
well tbh vip wasn't a thing back when I went to legoland california
well from my memory of legoland california, the only difference between a lego store and a legoland store was pick a brick was by weight of bag, not by cup volume
well I think lego now owns the company that bought legoland off them in the past, so it is an official lego store

ah, so it's the fans going "they work great together" type ship, cool
just sailor moon comes off as an airhead among airheads
I guess if you have someone irl who likes it that would probably make it more worth while
I just can't stand sailor moon herself whenever I try to watch <:TsubasaYareYare:407397617451139073>
also with the 2nd link, what's the reason for the jupiter mercury ship? Seen it around quite a bit.
love that first image of that last link <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrKobZZS2wI
while I'm not a fan of the show sailor moon, I am a sailor jupiter fan (looks cool, and seen some clips of her being badass without being in sailor form)

given the sailor posting tonight
But that doesn't really matter if people mainly follow for art <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
Actually, if he blames gaijins for reposts, he might also be locking since lockings kills built in google translate on twitter...
I guessed it was due to reposts due to his bio
Oh, just knew them as the artist who does great kanade stuff who randomly goes protected or posts odd cat pics
Also thanks for the embeds, didn't realize they went back on protected again
They did, but it's gone (the bot sometimes links to dead urls when his art is posted)

like there's a memoria of them left together and it just results in them talking about how great basa/maria is
they have quite a few xdu things together, as the loved ones who's prime versions died




there is a surprising ammount of kanade and serena art, just not adult serena

there needs to be more au serena in gear art

also love in some of the lives that Aoi sometimes more screams than sings her songs <:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
season 1 has always been my number 1 anime even after all the other stuff I've now watched
yeah some of the songs (especially biki ones) are enhanced by the grunts/breaths
miku's g song and duo shout where my 2 main songs to loop when I first started looking up gear songs on youtube
G and AXZ are my go to "put on the playlist while I bike somewhere" gear soundtracks
3_skip the season 1 op music gave me motivation to finish this during a creative rut-
I had the season 1 op of gear on loop for like 4 days after I watched season 1
everything after the lupin the 3rd cg movie in this list was first watched this year- https://myanimelist.net/animelist/ENDgie?order=-2&status=2
then gear got me looking for more late jan/early feb
binged the series in a week to pass the time during a bad sleep schedule
yup, mid january
so I am *very* new to anime
found witchblade from looking around comic wiki's in early highschool, found birdy the mighty: decode looking up heroine tf's in college, then only started watching anime in general after finding gear this january
like the first time I ever watched an anime as it released was 2 shows in the spring season this year
I just started watching anime so late in life that there is just a whole lot of old stuff I'm interested in more than most new stuff
I'm going to finish some of my old mecha backlog  then binge the series once it's finished most likely <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>

all I really know about the dark ones on the top is they have a cool song- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c86GbUY4eyY

green gal is Reina Prowler, the hacker from Walkure in Macross Delta


but I'll have to wait till the movie comes out on japanese blu-ray in october and someone rips it to know for sure since I'm not looking for any more wiki spoilers <:KirikaPanic:644235681677180958>
haven't seen the movie the  second character comes from yet, but I'm pretty sure the girl in black is like an au/dark reflection of kaname
I wasn't even pulling old stuff from my folder <:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
I was just jumping between tags and suggestions on pixiv







had to look up those names, but cool to see zero is tied into things beyond the blonde pilot (I'm bad with names)
3_skip same source
don't care what the fan consensus is given how the western fanbase ranks delta so low from what I've seen <:Ver:704169051391524875>
plus is on my watch list already
like the whole love triangle was a mess of idiots
the cousin, how all the romance was handled outside of mirage's grandparents, etc.
I'm more mil sci-fi guy so the dogfights in zero were what really drew me in, also there were no characters or plot lines that really annoyed me, unlike some in the oringal
but yeah, I myself have only seen delta, the original, and zero
zero is cool too
I mean she already has a good troll smile <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>

but given the mouth position of the gremlin biki miku she might just be resting her chin with her upper lip pushed over her lower lip

all fingers together works for visualizing flying, and as far as hand shapes go, isn't far off from a delta or flying wing shape
pretty much just test projects used them and by the time they could be done right stealth became important which they suck at compared to delta wings
still it is very much sci-fi as it resembles forward swept wings which aren't really used irl

tbh I've been doing the macross plane hand a lot when bored the past month or two

like biki just suddenly got obliterated right in front of them
also if I remeber correctly the art was captioned with chris yelling something along the lines of "she was right there!"
it's the gear equivalent of the military guys coming to your door to tell you your husband died in combat
also hibiki's torn bloody s.o.n.g scarf <:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>

also she already has experience and security clearance already <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
hey, you have a good boss, good benefits, and you get to be close to your partner
yeah, older biki miku is great <:HibikiGay:670494484701773845>
yeah, not everyone is a psycho like me and scrolls through every post here they missed <:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>

the ending of the show is sad since you know what is likely to happen
the sequel movie is a bit, the show not as much
it's more showing a cute future after a sad ending <:MikuCry:688397678584791074>
when you have the time watch it (and don't forget the very short post-credits)
yeah, I told you that already <:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
wow a packed source, and it's new enough to have sequel movie art in it
nvm night before last I watched the movie, last night I bought the movie
or was that the night before last?
tbh I was tired and emotional from the movie last night so I forgot that lol
don't have it on my laptop
anyone got the biki with rune art?
<@208460211906805761> you seen the new movie yet?
yup GX and Delta were their 2 big things in 2016
||and due to strain you see she likely isn't going to hit that 30 even||
also delta was made by the same studio as symphogear <:Ver:704169051391524875>
the compilation movie butchers most of it so don't watch that
cool action, enjoyable characters (especially the pair pictured above), and decent plot
yes <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
then you know it's reached full when ||freyja doesn't freak out at the near touch of her rune in the snow and just smiles||
after they get over annoying each other, but seeing that progression was part of the cuteness <:MikuCute:672908542763859968>

but it did the best it could with that start
yeah my only complaint about the sequel movie is it starts off from where the comp movie left things not the show
like I could get rushed, but taking out important character progression while filling the first half with a lot of filler...
comp movie kinda ignored it (and freyja and hayate's relationship) so the sequel movie does spend some time building those things back up
same spoiler as your google auto complete and no more so yes
||though it wasn't a giant spoiler if you think of the ending of the show rather than the ending of the comp movie||
wiki info section spoiler for me

oh
I was saying UC already had people from Jupiter with prominent roles
now to wait for Japan to wake up (the first gear artisits I think I ever followed were Japanese artists I followed for apex art)
they aren't even followed by any official/dev accounts I follow, so I doubt they get stuff ahead of time
oops, forgot this was twitter, source- https://twitter.com/ikadakat/status/1582074242127912960

that appears to be the rise of skywalker falcon in the art- https://brickset.com/sets/75257-1/Millennium-Falcon
ucs falcon- https://brickset.com/sets/10179-1/Ultimate-Collector-s-Millennium-Falcon
that's not the ucs falcon, it's one of the normal playset ones
all I remember is some crappy CAD render was memed as some pain machine or something

Build, destroy, build new is a enjoyable process, sorry you are just too dense to get that Matt.
also you don't need a printer or something to melt the old plastic, just your hands
not letting anyone hold my lego creations lol
nah
game is about interaction, sculpture is not
photograh is easier to store, and if images are taken from multiple angles and gives you a similar experience unless it has a movement gimmick, but then you would record a video
that is a functional thing, not an art peice
why you take pictures <:KanadeWink:690470895608791040>
but you can reuse the lego for future creations
just thinking of all the massive things and big cities I've seen at conventions <:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>

looks like my "wing" and "senpais" folders each have more files than my "singers" folder, but that's down to me saving only stuff I like
rarer art though
seeing tsubamari in show- <:TsubasaNeutral:688429723205894149>  looking at my fanart sub folder for them- <:MikuCute:672908542763859968>
also fanart of that pair often has more chemistry than the show itself

also I living basa could pull her back without any universe hopping intervention
though I could see a disabled basa throwing kanade back into wrath, just not as much as au kanade did
yeah, have her fight and perform with basa long enough for the "I want to sing" change of mind
I mean unless they change her initial origin point wrath will always be her initial start
https://translate.google.com/?sl=ja&tl=en&text=%E3%81%AA%E3%81%8B%E3%82%88%E3%81%97&op=translate apparently they just keep saying "good friend"/"friendly" <:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
oh you mean a new au miku, not edgebiki au miku
well since they gave au biki new hair clips, maybe new bow for au miku?
her time with au biki at the start of lost song was cute though (also finally gave a way to quickly id au vs prime biki lol)

no, edit now uses infinite scroll too <:TsubasaYareYare:407397617451139073>
though early infinite scroll had the workaround of the "edit" option of favorites had pages
3_skip years of favorites buried <:MikuSigh:688429722799308883>
having a search engine in favorites is too expensive, but not loading hundreds of image previews as you scroll threw looking for the thing though apparently <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
hard to find any old stuff I think of **because you can't search favorites and they replaced pages with infinite scroll**
I just used deviantart for browsing super heroine oc's and some mild tf's
yeah still stupid they're going to host ai art generation when they got rid of search bar in favorites for being "too expensive" <:TsubasaYareYare:407397617451139073>
was more wondering why this server makes them glad it's going to die, not why it's going to die
how so?

her actions do mainly revolve around edgebiki (curious about her, trying to get her to join section 2, some concern for her) so there isn't much characterization beyond "she's a solo basa without the season 1 basa loner sword complex"
has about as much of a role as gen in the universe for that event as well, so she's tied for 2nd most import person aside from edgebiki herself
bayonet charge and first edgebiki event pre date idol chris, and both of those have basas
dead serena, cryo frozen serena, adult serena
prime basa, au basa, edgebiki verse basa. prime chris, au chris, idol chris
and even then au versions of characters usually cap out at 3
nah, just prime biki and edge biki, the multiverse seems pretty lacking in bikis

even with nothing going on, AXZ was the one show I didn't binge through in a single day on my first viewing
fair
yeah, AXZ is definitely the most "meh" season
that cute miku gif I posted a few days ago is from the end of that, enjoy <:MikuCute:672908542763859968>
oh yeah, how far into the show are you?
though tbh the shamisen that went through my head was the one like 7 seconds into "Gekisho Infinity" (a group song, though one with Basa)
https://twitter.com/Tobase_1129/status/1619833769241763840
Same
how about some zwei flavor?



tbh, maybe not in this context, but I could see tsubasa saying that <:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
that's my point, she optimized for sword instead of getting built <:Ver:704169051391524875>
loss in life = gains in body I guess <:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
~~Tsubasa's main issue is she was so sword minded she didn't think to get built~~
Kanade loses parents? Gets built and gets gear. Gen loses Kanade? Gets built. It all makes sense. <:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
Kanade, happy her partner is no longer alone and has someone to sing with again <:KanadeWink:690470895608791040>


then there's also just "why not both?" fan art
while not really chemistry, Maria wanting to chew out Basa's dad in GX and her snapping Basa out of her funks in XV was good stuff
and then beyond that I found what little we got of Chris Basa in the show had more chemistry than anything shown with Maria. Stuff that actually makes me like Basa Maria is mainly stuff outside the show (including fan works). <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
Nothing warms my heart like Zwei Wing though <:ZweiHug:672455346949980170>
my third favorite Basa ship <:TsubasaBliss:672861879000891432>

well it is now the 2nd fantasy isekai I've added to my plan to watch list (among like 50 sci-fi/action shows)
(also that gif is adorable)

depends on the device, have had no issues on pc or mobile but on xbox logging in barely works and on switch subtitles often desync
armor styled kanade gear

their last 2 pixiv posts are shirabe as well, june and july

oh this mess is almost the *whole* room in my case
I have pretty much all my lego from my whole life...most of which is sitting in an unsorted mess in the room across from my bedroom
I do have plenty of the joints that the mechs used, but from the theme those originate from, the knight's kingdom figures
and it's orange mixed well with my orange and white pieces from the mars mission sets for custom spaceships <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
my only exo-force set wasn't even a mech, was the orange tank
the new jay one isn't too bad looking either https://www.lego.com/en-us/product/jay-s-titan-mech-71785
prob the best looking in-production lego mech atm is this- https://www.lego.com/en-us/product/zane-s-titan-mech-battle-71738
Best they got atm is ninjago and that one avatar set

or that fact that- as far as info we are given, Kirika has more of a b-day than any of the alchemist trio <:Ver:704169051391524875>
oh yeah, my bad (sorry Das) <:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
you said 10th anniversary so I clarified
these were character b-day pieces over the past year, b-days are just the 6, Kanade, Miku, and Carol


like if the guy pulls a weapon on the cops, that's a danger, but just having one on your person should not mean shoot on sight
yeah no knock raids and police treating every armed citizen as a criminal are some of the worst parts of us law enforcement
well the workers can't rise up if those in power cane easily crush them, just saying
whether it's gun or drugs, look into us laws restricting personal ownership of things in the us and their origins is often giving reasons to arrest minorities
our population was armed well before the police became militarized
communists and far right nationalists like gun ownership (because revolution) until they reach power, then they try to restrict guns (because they require a strong central gov)
funny how those you agree with hated gun control but those you claim to hate like it, should make you think
though that makes it kind of ironic that most people hate politicians but vote to give the government more power, the institution controlled by politicians
it all comes down to the optics and money sadly, not principles
I'm a small gov conservative I dislike a lot of republican politicians even if I lean more towards them
though I find it funny how reagan became such a popular figure with conservatives when as california governer he passed some gun restrictions because white people where scared of the black panthers having guns
yeah a lot of the issues currently in the us aren't caused or solved by guns (unless you count enforcement of bad government decisions as in the end, all laws are enforced by weapons)
well many who pushed back against oppression in the us advocated gun ownership
every oppressive and/or dictatorial state bans private guns as one of their early moves
so screw people who grow your food because there aren't a lot of them?
even today, out in rural areas, a criminal can do a whole lot before law enforcement can reach you
yeah, though accidents become more common when restrictions on guns and fear mongering around younger people using guns results in young people not being taught basic gun safety or practiced with guns before they come of age to own their own
and that's even more so in places where gun ownership has been common for a long time, you aren't getting rid of them. The reason places like Japan have pretty good control of firearms is private weapon ownership was already restrictive there even before guns became common
guns will always be around, so the question is, should just criminals and governments have access to them, or everyone?
I was more joking about how places with some of the strictest gun laws in the us have some of the highest gun murder rates, not suggesting where you would or wouldn't want to live. I still stand by my personal desire to live somewhere where guns aren't too difficult to acquire. If people want a technology that's existed for generations they can make it, and with technology advancing it's only getting easier, so unless all guns and knowledge of the science behind them is deleted from mankind, so I'd rather law abiding citizens be allowed to own them, not just those who ignore the law. Also an armed society is harder to oppress (why do think the first gun control laws in the us where in southern states and restricted blacks ownership of firearms?)
insurgencies are more about outlasting than defeating the state in the end
so they often outlast foreign aid
like revolutions without foreign aid rarely take over, but they also are rare to completely get rid of
to be fair, the colonies had some french help to finish the job, but before the french the revolutionaries were already making it too big of a pain for the uk to want to keep dealing with
well often with colonialism, it was guns vs no guns. When the Italians tried to take the one african country that had a lot of guns, they failed pretty bad
can you name  a conflict where a large military stuffed out a large asymmetric insurrection?
well the us already has a lot of guns so supplies are less needed
unless you're willing to wipe out your own cities
vietnam, aphgansitan, etc. raw military might does not end an armed insurgency
all the wars the us has lost to villagers with aks
"what do you mean people would fight hard to defend their homeland?"
since while china and russia rarely fully get along, even when they were both communist states during the cold war, the closest I can think of to them being on opposite sides of a war (at least in somewhat modern times) was when china attacked vietnam after vietnam pushed out western forces with soviet backing
south china sea, tairwan, the indian border, etc.
I'm more talking about locations china wants that aren't near russia
china is more likely to use russia causing problems to make their own expansions easier than worrying about russia encroaching on them
yeah stingers aren't a guaranteed kill but stingers vs a chopper is far better than no stingers vs a chopper, also if you get low enough they might not even need a missile to hit you
though stingers do cause a lot of problems for choppers, just look at what happened to the soviets in aphganistan (whose campaign revolved around helicopters)
so a few days ago I came across "(song) but you're (in some military conflict)" videos which is pretty much music with radio comms and sounds related to the conflict. And of course one of these videos that are supposed to be snapshots of histroy becomes more relevant a few days after I see it- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TiCBkCL27rU
"This is it" "Should I tell him to go f-ck himself?" "Just in case" "Russian waship, go f-ck yourself"
on the topic of bold Ukrainians , the radio transmissions between the base on snake island and the Russian ship that eventually shelled it, killing all 13 on the island- https://twitter.com/SethAbramson/status/1497019592891375620?s=20&t=OnTLw2nfRNVUgdCMtqqhyA
if it ends up confirmed, pretty sure he's the first fighter ace of the century
also when it comes to protests I'm pretty sure russia usually mainly targets the leaders, not as much the general demonstrators, don't know about the actual legality though, though I do think russia has laws on being non-patriotic
yeah, if you're trying to make a big show of how good you are, you probably have something to hide or are out for your own gain
yeah, screenshots/full quotes from another server prob would be an insensitive call, but laying out the basics just helps understanding in a confusing situation
at least you aren't breaking patient confidentiality
doesn't make her look bad and doesn't go into details so I don't see a big issue
wow, that's really messed up. My Navy chaplain dad isn't even allowed to mention things from counseling to commanding officers
so sadly it doesn't look like others were given much opportunity to help
the most recent sign of her struggles (in this server at least) looks like was on feb 11- https://discord.com/channels/336297387863703552/336297840529899522/942021379543412747 , people did try to cheer her up but it appears she temporarily left after posting that
yeah the 2nd most recent post on the gif twitter was saying they couldn't afford the hosting
well at least then some of her positive impacts live on
just like branches of government should check and balance each other, public and private should too (though even in the government checks and balance barely happen with executive orders and legislating from the bench)
I don't like centralized power, whether that be big government or big business, people are flawed and greedy so the more power they have the more they can abuse it
yup, same reason our public domain is crap now
the issue with US anti-trust is less the laws themselves and more the fact they've been barely enforced for so long barely enforcing them has pretty much become precedent
but yeah laws like this are stupid, because internal justification matters less than foreign resistance to your "justified" actions.
also russia has far less foreign powers supporting actions in ukraine than they did with their actions in eastern europe and ottoman territory back then
I mean this is pretty russian, back in the tsars' days they considered every christian near them under their protection and used that as justification for conflict lol
also this is a proposed law to justify things they've done for years, kinda doing it backwards guys
the real question, can someone get in without a passport if they just chat with the border guard in russian? 🤔
not like your vote matters there anyway
putin: "I hate nato trying to expand" also putin: makes the reason nato was made, to stop ussr/russian invasion, more relevant and pressing
but yeah, the term "alt right" is overused, even for the broader altered definition of non-establishment right
yeah, he's pretty standard religious conservative social values low economic regulation conservative. The most "non-establishment" thing about him is he's says his own opinions in an online show, instead of just pulling the republican or fox news line like how the stereotype of the establishment is
as the term they labeled themselves with became used broadly to label people no where near as bad
but because the mainstream media started labeling all non-establishment republicans, like trump, as "alt right" during the 2016 election the term became overused, and even kinda created a boy who cried wolf scenario, letting the white-nationalist go a bit more under the radar
but with what I was going to say in general, alt right actually refers to the white nationalist types (the term itself was coined by Richard Spencer), so lumping Ben in with them, the Jewish guy who is hated by those types, is kinda messed up
apex was just different enough from standard br for me to like it, but yeah I don't really like br
I like apex's gameplay but don't care too much about it's story
but also there's a lot of story to be told we never see about the war
yeah
kinda wish titanfall had a show, sadly if respawn ever did make a show it would prob be apex legends focused at this point- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqeMjHmL9eg
yeah, I'll stick with bionicle for building figures
yeah, this discord is the only anime related community I'm in so should be easy to avoid lol
well since you both have recommended IBO, I'll try that too
also my mech tastes lean more military than most gundam I've seen, I often prefer the look of star wars walkers and titanfall titans to gundams
as I said, not really planning on getting into the franchise as a whole so more looking at clips and spoiler free reviews to see what fits my tastes
I mean when I read star wars books growing up I kept only being able to find the 3rd book in a trilogy lol, I should be fine
I know gundam is more "real" than super robots and the like
but even them also talking about visual style as well
like I'm not super interested in getting into gundam as a whole atm
I just lean more towards more grounded stuff when it comes to mechs and it looked like the closest to my tastes
also a funny thing is even lego tried to make their mecha villains somewhat morally grey despite being styled in an obvious bad guy way, since the plot is pretty much "the most advanced of mining robots realizes they are slave labor and leads a revolt and tries to kidnap the old guy who made them"
(moc meaning "my own creation" in the lego community)
same, I'm more of a moc builder but I want to see what pieces I have
always thought this one was cool- https://brickset.com/sets/7700-1/Stealth-Hunter
I need to check if I still have those pieces with the stickers on them
was before I was super into lego but I did get this tank for my brithday back then-
yup
speaking of mass produced mechs, remember when lego had an anime styled mech theme?
tbh they look like the would work for emperor zurg
yup, that's what I thought
zaku are the rounded looking ones right?
speaking of nier, I love this mashup- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=APvk4d5N6ys
I played like the first level on gamepass, seemed fun
I can't really make a list due to my limited viewing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uG41eX1_XBw
I find it funny that most of the shows that have caught my interest so far from this search are mecha from the late 80's/90's despite the anime's I've already watched and enjoyed being female hero focused ones from after 2005
haven't started watching it yet, just a video talking about it
apparently the whole show with english subs is on youtube
it's from the 80's
Kikou Ryouhei Mellowlink (Armor Hunter Mellowlink)
well in my browsing of youtube videos to see what anime I might like I found a mecha anime where the protagonist doesn't even used a mech, but pretty much an anti-tank gun
on the fourth episode of Armor Hunter Mellowlink, quite a simple show but I'm enjoying it
still think I prefer decode, but this is different enough to be more than the same story in a different style and I'm having a good time
took a break from Armor Hunter Mellowlink (watched 8 episodes and wanted something different for a bit) and am watching through the 4 episodes of the 90's Birdy the Mighty OVA, I watched the first episode on youtube back after I first watched the 2 seasons of decode in 2018 and thought it was just a one-shot and didn't get as into it as decode, but watching it now after episode 2 I'm quite liking it (probably between season 1 and 2 of decode in terms of enjoyment for me so far)
funny thing, when I first watched through decode in 2018 I was visiting my grandparents on the west coast and the time difference (we were living on the east coast, so 3 hours) made me less of a night owl, but then binging through decode made me night owl again in that time zone
maybe I'll look into that after I finish Armor Hunter Mellowlink
does the manga wrap things up more and is there an english translation?
finished birdy the mighty last night, quite enjoyed it but kinda sad that both iterations (the ova and decode) stop open ended with the main villains behind everything still at large
I've enjoyed a book about a guy creating a navigation guide, and one about a guy translating the bible for a tribe, so a story about making a dictionary doesn't sound like a bad idea
Also since I liked the tech design and action, anyone know if the mainline votoms stuff is worth watching?
All 12 episodes of Armor Hunter Mellowlink finished. Liked the plot, action, and the tech in it. Also after watching Symphogear and Birdy it's nice to watch a show where I don't feel a need for an epilogue or continuation after the end. Only had 2 things bothering me in the back of my mind, 1- the standard action trope of antagonists talking and waiting instead of taking an easy shot, and 2- the bit of disconnect that starts occurring after the first episode or 2 of the protagonist out for revenge for the death of his brothers in arms taking out a lot of uninvolved soldiers, though he does realize it briefly in the final episode so that pulled that issue back a good bit.
I mean in symphogear's case you don't need the anime to be successful, just other products related to it
like even outside anime "passion projects" can often just end up being development hell (duke nukem forever was pretty much a passion project and it took forever to come out and people hated it)
and to think back in the day lucas offering a pay cut in exchange for merch rights with the first star wars was a relatively easy deal
there's viewership success (tv, streaming, physical releases), merch success (figures, soundtracks, branded goods), and then just being an advertisement success (80's kids shows promoting toys, or modern anime promoting a pre-existing mobile game)
well streaming is more just standard success, like tv viewership of the past
so like gacha game or toy line adaptations
whatever works for them, also I guess because ova's in japan don't have the same stigma as "straight to home video" in the states
and one sad one of a player who committed suicide a few years later
one from someone who went from "trans woman who is the most accomplished medic main in the scene" to "perma banned from all leagues for hitting on minors"
I mean that tf2 poster of mine is signed by the invited teams and desk talent, and that now includes 2 awkward signatures
eh, could be worse things about a poster
have no clue what this is from, but love the energy from all 3 in this shot
as I said, a dream, not a reality
Imagine if the longer wait since g compared to between 1 and g is to western release the whole series for the anniversary year... a man can dream
we are overdue given the western season 1 release was late 2020 and g was early 2021
nice thing about bionicles- cool figures that you can easily break down for transport/storage
I only have 3 posters in my room, one small bionicle 2015 one from some promo, one for a tf2 community tournament crowd funding campaign, and a random thing I did for art class in like 4th grade
yes (top of my bookshelf, and the shelf bellow has a couple more sets and canisters)
don't have any anime stuff in my room, just gaming and lego/bionicle related stuff, though I do plan on changing that a bit
so seems more like a pixar thing than a disney thing
but yeah looking through pixar stuff just seems to have english, english descriptive, and spanish
just checking through things, marvel, star wars, disney channel stuff all have a bunch of sub and dub options
I mean there are shows and movies with far more language options on d+, even other disney owned stuff
which is weird as often american home media (dvd/bluray) of major releases have french as an option
though while my "plan to watch" list is mostly mecha stuff I think I might go for something more lighthearted for my next watch, like the lupin the 3rd part 2 dub
ok, good
that does sound interesting
another title to add to the list I guess
like I really enjoyed armor hunter mellowlink
not realistic warfare per-say, but more action/thriller movie than sci-fi epic
fair, but given how many shows have sword fights in space or child pilots...
well my mecha tastes are a bit off from standard, I'm more a "grounded" mecha guy
I've heard "gurren lagann" mentioned before but have no clue what that is lol
TTGL?
will add that to the list
ok
which is?
I like action and character moments, and gunbuster just felt lacking in both for a good chunk, didn't feel like I wasted my time but prob not going to rewatch, 7.5/10
and the main struggle early on is this "special pilot" is just a crybaby until suddenly she isn't in time to save the day with no real time given to the change
like one of the main emotional bits is around a girl's romance for her older teacher that ignores and slaps her with no scenes showing why she cares for the man
finished gunbuster, it was ok, some good moments and ideas but didn't really grab me
started watching lupin the 3rd part 2 (english dub) tonight, as fun banter as the youtube clips made it out to be, also watched Dragon's Heaven and while I enjoyed the what was there (animation, characters, etc.) there was barely any plot or development and wish some more time for that had been given instead of spending a while at the start on pretty pointless animatronic shots
I wonder for risky stuff if any companies do cut of the profits rather than up-front license fee
Well lack of product availability in the west definitely doesn't help western popularity
ok, glad to know I'm not too oblivious today
that emote has me thinking I've typed something stupid and haven't realized what
?
well glad I saved you some wasted time, I've had some dumb skim reads myself
tonight? it says the 14th
rights issues rarely are confirmed
got to love rights messes...
or take advantage of the fact that anime translators often fall into the game dev trap of taking less than market rate for their skills for "love of the hobby"
||Like even things beyond my usual sacrifice/protecting others emotional weaknesses. Like the scene on the space station where the little sister of Vivy's dead friend happily recognizes her actually made me tear up.||
also, I now have another sci-fi singing show that can make me tear up at times
Watched through "Vivy: Fluorite Eye's Song". Liked it a lot. Wish there were more action scenes with Vivy but the non-actions scenes were good too, and the finale episodes weren't as strong as the rest, but that's kinda expected when your  driving force is time travel / changing the future.
at least no matter which I pick I won't have to go to shady sites because they're on netflix, why are the gundam streaming rights split up anyways?
yeah, after this either going to check out the gundam show I got recommended when talking about mecha before in this server (iron blooded orphans) or watch through the original 3 compilation movies
watched a few more episodes of 08th ms team, quite enjoying it. The action is good and I actually care about the most of the characters
tbh besides my stated dislike for the spikes, this guy looks pretty cool
just saying for the most part from an audience perspective, distinct silhouettes help
also from a show production standpoint makes who's who very clear
I'm more a fan of angular designs so the roundness and spikes don't really appeal to me as much, the machine gun they carry is cool though
still not that different as the ground one still have jump jets
so similar
is that the same one as the 08th have?
I kinda like gun+shield style some of the basic mechs have tbh
I like how in 08th the laser swords are more used like backup knives
well the mech swords are what I was referring to, though they aren't a turn off as long as most major fights are gun/missle based
also the first anime I saw was a speed racer dvd my family had
fine with that (currently watching episodes of the lupin the 3rd part 2 dub when eating dinner)
starting out with 08th since it seemed to have the least of that
but enough cool stuff for me to check things out
still from my external very basic view seems to be a lot more child/teenage major characters and sword fights for a military thing
ah so more like spidey sense
I'm the kind of guy who watches star wars for the pilots and foot soldiers, not the jedi, give me a good shoot out over a sword fight, and skill over mind abilities
well you guys bringing up new types with physic stuff
I doubt I'll watch all the stuff just due to tastes (I started with 08th since I prefer military sci-fi to some of the wilder science fanatasy stuff the franchise seems to have at points)
I know the basic conflict, and even besides that 08th doesn't really need external explanation (at least so far) feds vs zeon
But hey, f2p so I'll give it a try
As long as it has fewer stun mechanics than ow I'll prob enjoy it
Gives me titanfall 2 dashing vibes tbh
But I do like the genre in general
Tbh overwatch is one of my least enjoyed hero/character shooters
speaking of games, during my gundam googling tonight I learned there's a gundam shooter coming this year
made many people salty in titanfall 2 with tone
but yeah, while not anime I can understand liking things more on the artillery side- https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/titanfall/images/0/0c/Tone_1.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20170523212116
in half? I feel anything hit would be in more pieces than that lol <:Ver:704169051391524875>
yeah I picked 08th since it seemed the most grounded of the series
I feel there's prob some hamfisted "got to show war is bad and unjustified" there too, not just apeasement
like you can say grevious doesn't represent you but he leads most of your forces and major campaigns
yeah, kinda how when they started showing some good separatists in clone wars after seasons of showing the separatist military is just straight up evil
||like besides crazy brother the worst zeon get in 08th is villager exploitation/oppression||
while I'm  aware of that, guess I enjoy the show more given it was my first gundam and I haven't really seen that yet
||felt more like a short spinoff ova than a final episode||
||though the real slapped on part was the last episode||
||yeah the scenes with the retreating zeon do a better job at showing good on both sides than the final episode does||
but it does that pretty well too
I didn't really feel a drop off exactly after that, but it does change gears at that point from space nam to (from what I understand) is more standard "war is bad and there's good people on both sides" gundam
oh dear
episode wise
when does that happen?
also it was my first gundam and second mecha show I've watched
just finished gundam 08th ms team last night, prob my fav anime I've watched this year that doesn't involve singing
guess one upside to ignoring anime for so long is that I don't have to worry about new stuff coming up as I have a lot of old stuff to watch
speaking of mecha shows with bad early episodes, last week I watched through Full Metal Panic since a few of you recommended it to me, only got through the first couple episodes because I was told the school stuff becomes less later on, which is true but then after every non-school arc there's a civilian/school episode where all the character development is forgotten and it goes back to frustrating status quo
this is what I've watched this year (nothing season related as the newest show I've seen is vivy)
like my parents didn't watch any shows, they just watched some short films netflix gathered together as kind of a film festival thing
still half of netflix's worldwide members watching at least one thing is still a lot of view time total
the headline is "half of members" so I assume half of netflix subs watched at least one anime episode or film
apparently my parents watched some anime short films on netflix recently, funny because I don't think they've watched any anime not from when they were kids before (the speed racer dub and star blazers, the dub of space battleship yamamoto)
||Also, amazed that they were able to kill a character, who's whole point is they were dying, in a shocking but set-up way that also fits the message. I've teared up at some shows but this is the first piece of media in a while that made my breathing emotional...||
well I wanted a break from action-focused stuff and decided to watch "I want to eat your pancreas" since I remember it sounding enjoyable from the Gigguk video on it. I would describe most of it in one word "endearing".
the theory I heard is that since a lot of the lightnovels they're based on are initially posted online they pretty much have to advertise or clickbait the content in the title
watching through, while I expect weird gags in reanimated stuff, was not expecting a tiny desk engineer reference
don't know what the show is being reanimated is here, but I recognize pear's segment's depiction of them from having this video on loop last year- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khK_afMwAdA
well as long as we keep nuclear arms out of her hands hopefully that will stay the meaning
because hydrogen and oxygen powered by a nuclear reaction is starlight ;)
is she going to hit them with a hydrogen bomb?
tbh I could use some lighthearted fun after watching quite a few "war is bad" mecha shows recently
might watch some of spy x family using the 1 month left of my 3 month crunchyroll trial I got from game pass
the trailer definitely makes it look fun
yeah usually when a fandom is considered awful on average, it usually is majority kids and teenagers
I'm glad for most bad fandoms I've only heard of them being bad and not encountered them that much first hand.
me with gunbuster, so many people said it was great and I just found it pretty average for the most part
I rewatch less for details and more for either hype or emotion
yeah, forced shock value/twists are always annoying writing
yeah I guess with edgy stuff it ages better if it's viewed as "stupid" edgy rather than "deep" edgy
given I barely watched anime before this year I don't have much to draw from, but prob the closest I got is going from quite liking the second season of Birdy the Mighty: Decode to just finding it "ok". Because beyond the intrigue and learning about some characters' pasts that draws you in on first watch it's not as good as the first season in pretty much every way (visuals, emotional moments, etc.).
also this being the first time I've seen an anime episode when it released it's weird not being able to binge multiple episodes lol
yeah, just watched, the first episode was quite cute
clean up the pop tarts wrapper
Watching through that crunchyroll video on the history of Gundam and learned my 2 favorite mecha series  so far have a director in common, the guy who directed Armor Hunter Mellowlink was the same guy who directed the first half of 08th MS Team
we didn't even have cartoon network, I watched the episodes when they were put on the star wars website a few days after airing for 2 weeks
also I only had seasons 1-3 on dvd and my family didn't have netflix when I was growing up
tbh I mainly rewatch clone heavy arcs
tbh I don't think I've rewatched the maul stuff since it aired
don't think I'll get into the franchise anyway lol, like the characters and some of the action but the main war, the monsters and the mech designs I could give or take
yeah don't think some test pilots are going to clean up all of europe and asia lol
How so? Like just the conflict isn't resolved or like all the character arcs are still left hanging? Guess I'll find out as I'm at 17 of 24 of Total Eclipse lol
tbh resistance skirmishes can be more interesting than large battles a lot of the time
resistance cells work too
I've also heard zeta's show dub is more meh as well
that's fine
might skim the action scenes at some point then when I'm done with the show
but I guess that makes sense since the federation characters are mostly kids/teenagers while the zeon are mostly adults
funny enough, so far only the zeon have gotten humanizing moments that don't come off as whiny so far imo
at least I've had a show I don't need to focus on since the show has a dub
oh well, too late now
but war is bad can add some good character moments so I'm fine with it there, just it's a bit "I know already" when it's hammered in
but I do like my cool action, I'm here for the military sci-fi as I already know the message
and MSG is that but also "being a child soldier messes you up"
so far it's no where near as good as 08th ms team
also I'm not really watching MSG for the show itself, more for context before hopping into ova's in and around the 1 year war I'm actually interested in
well I'm already 19/43 on the dubbed show so I think I stay with that, it's taken the place of the lupin III part 2 dub as my background anime for now
I saw people online recommending watching the show instead, also also the dubbed episodes on crunchyroll work better for just "watch an episode while having dinner" than the movies on netflix which aren't dubbed and I tend to rarely sit through movies at home anyway
the original mobile suit gundam had too many episodes to just solo focus on so I peaked at my "because you liked" section on crunchyroll
"Full Metal Panic!" was somewhat enjoyable (except for the stupid reset to status quo school episodes), "Knights of Sidonia" was good if a bit clunky, and I've been really liking "Muv-Luv Alternative: Total Eclipse" so far, but that trope just makes me cringe every time
I have for the most part enjoyed what I've watched, just wish that trope didn't keep popping up
at least each one I've watched has been better than the last in the other aspects
It's 3 for 3 on non-gundam mecha stuff I've watched in the past 2 months
ugh, why do so many mecha shows I check out end up falling into multiple girls trying to get with the protagonist and the stupid drama involved with that....
also wish he had cloaking tech like in the novels so he could do some of his big brain plays
glad thrawn got some recognition but still prefer him in the original novels
Yeah I just skimmed the clone, mandolorian, and thrawn focused episodes when my family got disney plus
guess I'll put season 1 on my watch list (low priority though)
never seen seed lol
could be fun depending on how the dumb is handled
what's that?
fair, it takes me putting a spinoff ova in my top 10 anime to bother with 30+ episode series (08th got me interested in MSG, and armor hunter has me interested in votoms)
like tof, "tactical orbital fighter", or txf "tacitcal extraterrestrial fighter"
I mean the mech designs/naming, visual novels that are the "better way to consume", etc. (is what I'm calling goofy)
well I guess I'm glad I'm not interested in the world enough to go beyond the TE anime, I'll avoid this goofy mess lol
guess they thought "irl we're at f-35 so if you chose a number in the 40's it's future"
then that breaks the point of the names in the first place lol
(i know the page is p-47 but it had a f-47 designation too)
how did they get that from this? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_P-47_Thunderbolt
also they do kind of kitbash parts of the jets onto the mechs
they do have aspects, the f-14s are carrier launched, f-22's have stealth etc.
guess if they looked more like jets did, they would be too close to macros lol
but for mechs named after jets they don't really have a jet look and are kinda generic if anything
speaking of the 1st episode, the one mech design thing I found cool in their adaptation of jets is giving the f-14's jolly roggers markings
||they set up a cast then kill all but one off and that one isn't even the future protagonist||
so like the 1st episode lol
well dating games aren't my thing so I think I'll finish the TE anime and move on
ah, explains it lol
since I don't see visual novels going more into action than an anime
though I feel if I looked into the novels they would dive farther into the stupid "everyone wants the protagonist" lol
just like having a feeling of intensity
i'm fine with some over done grounded and/or gritty tbh
0080, 0083, and thunderbolt are on my list atm
have not watched votoms, but I liked armor hunter mellowlink, so prob will watch votoms once I'm done with the one year war gundam stuff
guess more grounded (titanfall, votoms, federation ground types)

I mean prob won't hate it as much as I hated it super mobile stun spamming mech in the recent evolution playtest lol
might check out ibo at some point as a lot have recommended it, and am curious about the new show airing late this year but not crazy interested
I've watched 08th, and watching msg, plan to watch 0080, 0083, thunderbolt, and maybe zeta then I'm done with watching gundam for a bit
don't intend on watching wing lol
and so those that started on wing found hearing one character's voice in another wierd in msg apparently
yeah think I heard after wing did well on toonami they then dubbed msg with a similar cast
doesn't wing have the same dub cast as the msg?
well the thing is I don't plan on fully watching the uc stuff anyway
and that's not even mecha
like I'll probably watch star blazers out of curiosity of what my dad watched growing up before I look at alt-timeline gundam stuff
but not really in a rush
I think I'll stick with UC stuff for now anyway, maybe once I've seen what I want there and then watched some of the other mecha I'm curious about I might look around the other timelines
so I'll still cringe, just not cringe and put out a frustrated groan/sigh
but yeah, when it comes to romance I only really like it when it's a motivation for, and/or bringer of a desire to care for /protect. "falling in love" romcom stuff and triangles tend to make me cringe
didn't know ver got control of the island again <:Ver:704169051391524875>
better I guess to go from 10/10 to 1/10 later on than something that bounces between kinda ok and bad repeatedly (full metal panic)
evol?
when I do like romance in a show it's often because I find those involved endearing, so yeah probably not my taste
like if it's a couple working through things/getting together that's fine but love triangle stuff sucks
yeah, romance drama is often a downside (but not a deal killer) for me, especially if it's misunderstanding heavy
well I'm going to hop off for now, going to continue to go through msg while eating dinner then maybe watch a few more episodes of TE
btw I only learned recently that gunpla is snap together for the most part lol
I got on twitter in the early-mid 2010's to see behind the scenes updates from fellow lego animators
tbh I only follow fan artists on twitter when it comes to shows/movies, me being in this symphogear server is kinda the exception to being in fandoms for me lol
"This shot is a farewell, a send-off on our own terms."
since this looks like this channel was created by one of the team for just uploading the clip, not a viewer showing it off
prob a mix or not wanting to tempt dmca bots any more than they have to, and maybe aiming more to have the clip easy for them share it around rather than for publicizing it
also, wow, an unlisted video with almost 2 million views in half a week
the tweet I saw didn't mention him getting to eat his nut, just mentioning the shorts being out and "blue sky" logo being shown
oh yeah, saw on twitter someone from blue sky saying they were glad these were released with the studio credited
the early days of YouTube in the mid 2000's
but yeah, same era of humor though
guess same era
tbh that white base video gives me "This is Sparta! Last techno remix" vibes
oddly it's not that funny/noticeable of a scene (it's very short) yet it somehow became a meme video
since I'm watching the dub and you linked the vid before I recognized that moment
well I clicked the spoiler on instinct but I don't plan on watching that show anytime soon so no worry lol
ah, the best one
which he? I listed 2 guys
the cry/confession scene after the battle did come off as kinda forced though
||Ramba Ral and his wife on the zeon side and Ryu on the crew side||
||they really did just choose to kill the most likable antagonists and one of the most level headed crew over 2 episodes huh||
well I'm half-way through the original gundam now
lego filmed in 480p with a quickcam 4000 just has a certain style
I was pretty much limited to kids sites till like the early 2010's, but I have a lot of second hand nostalgia for stuff from the 2000's, especially  lego stop-motion animations from 2004-2008
idk why, but I'm a real sucker for the parallel mirror or camera pointed at monitor look
beautiful
so there's more filler
also keep in mind I'm watching the show, not the compilation movies
yeah, I get it has a focus on the individual side of war, just for a good chunk in the middle of the first half it's just complaining while slowly going across asia
even if that was just being more sober
well then like I said, you changed between viewings lol
yeah, the show doesn't change on rewatch, so the only thing that can change in the equation is you, and that takes time, and it's not even likely the things that change about you will be things that improve your opinion on a given show lol
I feel the only exception to that is if there are literal years between each watch lol
well as I said before I'm watching the show not the movies because I don't like focusing on and hour+ of something with no breaks, and also I wanted a dub for more passive viewing
well for me from when char stopped chasing till when ramba ral became involved the whole show felt like mostly filler with whining as "character development"
also was not expecting hillbilly zeon special forces lol
also after those 2 episodes of good characters dying at least the show is now moving from whiny crew focus to action and things with the war are now actually happening
but yeah, from what was being said about gundam quality in gaming, glad I'm taking the pick and choose approach
stop-motion yes, but not mid-2000's stop-motion. The really detailed look of the cgi is more like modern dslr lego stop-motion
with hours spent moving and looking at others moving lego figures, I would say stop-mo as well lol
so the sequel of anything pacific rim isn't good? noted
pretty decent
that chest is giving me ww2 bomber ball turret vibes lol
mouthful of a name
what's this from?
Finished the show, I enjoyed it. The main characters were likable throughout and the action was decent. The main downsides were it had an episode with a lot of stupid stuff on either side of the recap episode, and sometimes the "every girl falls for the protagonist" was a bit annoying (especially with the Chinese pilot gal), but overall good show (though kinda let down it switched to the actual protagonist, who was ok, when the female lead had a great set up in episode 1)
||like if people are starving becuase you think too many supplies are going to the military in a war of extinction and too much money is being spent on weapons, why not raid supplies instead of destroying things that the UN will just use more resources to replace? (this is so stupid even if you ignore the aliens that have eaten most of humanity)||
After skipping the "recap episode" I just watched the first episode of the finale of Muv-Luv Alternative TE ||and my goodness the terrorists are counter-productive idiots, shoutout to the one terrorist though who shot the bar gal giving a speech about their own stupidity for talking too much||
also the ed animation is nice- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRKJBpFFsuI
wrapped up my night by watching spy x family episode 3, continues to be cute and fun <:MikuPraise:585839808765493249>
that's the one that re used the va's they had for wing right?
especially bright
watching the episode subbed on youtube right now, glad I picked the dub for my main viewing of the show, the voices are more flat and less distinct in the Japanese version
heard multiple places the creator/director himself didn't want it released when plans for international release came up
especially in the first half
"relative pointlessness to the overarching plot" that's a lot of the show lol
tbh, I like the stylization they did to the cg even it's obvious the mechs and vehicles are cg
guess time to look it up on youtube
ah, saw talk of this movie and was like "I'm 30 episodes in and haven't seen the episode this is from yet" lol
that's a nice head tbh
you mean like gm's?
this looks like it's from a non-gundam mecha tbh
but I don't really like zeon suits anyway
eh, I like it more than most of the uc ones I've seen
ah, yeah, as more of an outsider I was looking at it stand-alone
tbh that still looks cool to me (besides the spikes I hate on every zeon design)
ce grunts?
and even then each language has a separate pronunciation
was about to say lol
fair, if you rapid fire say gee-emm it will start to sound like jim
like this makes sense for a cargo vehicle- https://gundam.fandom.com/wiki/Fat_Uncle
eh, transports make more sense to have goofy names than combat vehicles
jinx sounds like something a fighter jet or tank would be nicknamed at least, while Jim just sounds silly
Jim is taking his GM to the gym
also I find it hard to take things seriously when the GM's are called "Jim" instead of "Jee-em"
speaking of silly zeon, the dub making the black tri-stars red-necks
never noticed that lol
I mean gundam is a series where the first scary badguy upgrade in the first season is pronounced "goof" lol
though the dashing that every unit has is far scarier than widow's grapple hooks- https://youtu.be/e__HixP0EDY?t=47
only finding one dub va for noa for the original show, the movies have a different va though
yeah the youtube channel I've been looking at for reviews/overviews of the shows also really likes 0080
also everyone mentions one of the 0080 va's is solid snake's va lol
I have heard good things about the 0080 dub
but yeah heard they changed the va's for zeta and the acting isn't done as well, so I'll prob switch to subs when I get to zeta
but this this is a cooler looking mech with a chain gun-
these do look quite cool
well variants of the face of your franchise isn't weird lol
and looks cooler too
it was made with rx-78 spare parts wasn't it?
I mean it makes sense the rx-78, pretty much a test bed platform, would have a lot of variations lol
I care more about gm variants anyways lol
cg mechs I can stand, not sure about cg people though
but yeah, once I watched 08th (which was the gundam thing I felt I would be most likely to enjoy) I decided to do oyw and post oyw stuff I was interested in chronologically
not exactly, I started with 08th and I might look at origin afterwards lol
yeah not sure I'll even watch anything later than zeta in uc lol (current plan after the original series is 0080, thunderbolt, 0083, then zeta)
idk how good the movie will be (since they will have to add a lot to fill out one), but compared to "kids and teenagers whine and complain" that makes of most of the first half it's decent
ok, just finished watching the original episode 15 (Doan's Island) and I've to say, kinda sad it was cut from western releases. Besides the animation issues, I like it more than most of the  episodes in the first half of the show
ik, still don't like it lol
speaking of heads, got to the part of Doan's Island with that off model head lol
funny enough my least favorite aspect of a gundam head design is the iconic v antenna lol, prefer as ears or none at all
also, you can stick with something like a mono-eye and still make it more unique, all the titanfall mechs are mon-eyes (or at least mono eye or mono eye cluster)- https://titanfall.fandom.com/wiki/Category:Titans_(Titanfall_2)
that is a cool looking head
yeah but I prefer the look of pale rider, and prefer medical experiments over "soul in the machine" for my sci-fi
oh, was talking about how the main pale rider pilot was a girl, forgot about the girl in the exam system
you got it flipped, pale rider was the one with the girl
watched a video on pale rider, it wasn't a new type system, it was some cruel experiment to bring non new types closer to new type levels
I kinda want to try and animate the blue flash movement with my figure at some point
got mine off ebay last month, there was a sealed one with free shipping from ohio that was cheaper than a used one plus shipping from Japan
but yeah, I'm not that versed in figures since my only figures (anime or otherwise) that aren't plastic building toys are these-
yeah, it's cool looking technique, just kinda a funny use
it's not bad, just saying it's kinda funny effort was put into that aspect
I did not, and that just reinforces my point lol
never seen something made to look like soaked white clothes, the power of horny fans I guess
I am watching the tv version dub and liked the counting <:KanadeWink:690470895608791040>
watched the neutral colony and battle of solomon parts of MSG the past 2 days, my fps gamer brain is loving Gundam doing flick shots with the beam rifle during the space fights lol
I mean most shows on there are rated 7 something, good or bad
and technicals are just pick-up trucks with weapons on the back
yeah, a buggy version of a missle truck is kinda silly (but it's actually not that wierd now that I think about it since both the us and russia have looked into ground up versions of technicals)
ok, prob a better description is if the japanese converted one of their civilian vehciles into a missle truck
nah, that just looks like if the japanse made a missle truck, so would fit into category 1
I think the best middle ground the federation had between "that's just a modern vehicle with some things changed" and "that's too goofy looking" is probably the fly manta
also with that footprint, good thing the federation had air superiority
that looks cool, but does not look suited for land lol
I actually think most of the federation non-mechs are pretty cool, except the big in atmosphere crafts like the one you posted
like a core fighter giving air support is cooler looking and is probably more useful than the gun tank it gets put in <:GenjuroLaugh:689563633516150872>
tbh I think it looks cooler than most of the vehicles it gets put into in the original series
also the simple core fighter on its own is a pretty nifty design
looks like you merged a modern stealth fighter with a vulture droid, pretty cool
looks like a cool rocket, but for a fighter craft I like the look of the 08th ones-
||don't think the vacuum is that much of a threat as zeons in equivolent suits get rope pulled by mobile suits through space for the evac, and due to that he probably wouldn't have to bring slegger in, just hold him in the mech hand or have him latch on||
yeah, the core booster looks cool but the gundam attachment vehicles always look so silly
||no, he gets flung out after the claw pierces the cockpit but misses him||
while I've heard good things about the original movies, I've heard bad things about Zeta's compilation movie and that's the only other UC long series I plan on watching
||one, the rifle does nothing to gundam, and 2 if broken man with rifle is a threat, shoot and leave instead of gawking at him||
the movies on netflix don't have an english dub, and the show on crunchyroll does, I mainly had this as a "while I eat dinner or browse the web" show since I didn't care a lot about it
oh, so this was retconned, glad the creators agreed with me on how stupid this was
||maybe Amuro should have gone to grab him instead of gawking at the harmless nutcase with a rifle||
so Char says he doesn't wear space suits because he wants the risk and plans to always bring his mobile suit back. Like that matters in this show, from what happened to ||Slegger, even in the best case scenario of you are wearing a space suit and are thrown out of your ship in one piece and conscious everyone considers you dead right off the bat and makes no attempt at rescue or recovery <:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874> ||
on episode 36 of MSG, they really did just come up with a sci-fi explanation to have a wild-west looking colony <:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
well I am watching the english dub
but yeah, lightly used the nail file on my multi-tool on the leading edge of the stand peg while watching a show and it fit in eventually
from googling it, that seems to be an issue with figmas in general, the stand not fitting in the back easily
though after getting it new was kinda annoyed I had the file the stand peg a bit to fit in her non-round back hole
and it was sealed
$85 (90 with tax) <:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
that's silly lol
I heard that sound effect, for comedy of something scurrying away lol
ah, was about to say, at least on netflix there 's is only a japanese audio track
the was a dub of the movies?
also, something not to do with the era, whenever I look at a clip of the original japanese, the va's are so flat
do the movies change the sfx at all, or was it just animation changes?
now that I'm aware
yeah, I understand that, and I'm saying I like that about the dub
yeah, as I said, for the era, but I think this dub from decades later is better ;)
like the animation, fine for the era and budget but not that great
and tbh, as someone with no nostalgia for it, the general sfx (for both sides weapons) seem more cheesey and low fidelity in the sub
looking at the scene in the subbed version, the music is some weird piano banging
yeah, it does stand out from the rest of the ost
btw, here's a quick recording of the texas fight so you can hear the music I'm talking about, not really the kind of music I would really listen to on loop, but it hypes up the fights it's used for- https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JmBe-rB89Mze1MC4B8973v-wjf9WDGnZ/view?usp=sharing
it's used a few times, but it's the only different piece I can think of
like that one bit I'm talking about is the only one that I can remember not being in the soundtrack playlists
the dub still mostly uses the original stuff
0079 gundam music is good, just isn't as hype for fights and the op/ed isn't to my taste
though I guess besides the voices this is another reason in retrospect I'm glad I chose the show dub
still want to find the music, though who knows might be some random stock stuff
the most recent scene I saw it in my viewing is when Char shows up in the Texas fight, it mainly uses an electric guitar it seems
also found a 2 year old reddit post who noticed the same thing- https://www.reddit.com/r/Gundam/comments/cyptyh/did_they_replace_and_rearrange_music_when_they/
I switched between times it happened in the sub and dub on crunchyroll, and it's only in the dub, even on the same site lol
I mainly watch gaming and history stuff
well none of the ani-tubers I watch upload frequently enough to be main channels for me anyway
it's like watching the angry reviewers of old, you don't come for the review, you come for a fan of the medium poking fun at the medium
yeah, that's how I watched gigguk stuff
sadly I wasn't watching him when he made his xv bait and switch or I might of found symphogear sooner <:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
just watching his videos about each season of anime out of curiosity with no intent to watch the shows
funny enough I watched gigguk's videos for a while despite not watching any anime lol
I found it when I was trying to figure out what gundam shows I would want to watch lol
https://www.youtube.com/c/WeHeartGiantRobots/videos
my favorite "ani-tuber" is this small-ish channel with 2 unroganized british dudes talking about mecha shows
guess that's what happens when its not very promoted in the west till season 5 lol
tried looking up my favorite bit of combat music from 0079, turns out it's only in the dub and I can't find it anywhere :(
like, why is symphogear season 1 the lowest rated of the series? do people just value visuals over characters and story?
like I rate my own viewings but I don't actually look at ratings, I'll watch a video review on youtube or ask around here if I want an opinion
eh, rounds to 7
yeah, far less confusing lol
||his cockpit is breached he goes a bit out to space, amuro quickly dissables the zom with the beam rifle and doesn't do much else till the zabi guy comes out||
it's like an empty sleeve
that arm lol
then for one still frame ||he looks a bit deflated if anything||
so this is slegger in the show, falling out alive
ah, so it's an armor swap gimmick
looks like he was made to be some kit/figure for younger fans lol
and core booster is cooler looking than the silly attachments
also while watching this bit of the movie yeah, ||Slegger definitely dies in the movie version||
not even sure if it was in it's aresenal, just think it was something they had on the base
btw, speaking of g maneuvers, does gundam ever use super napalm beyond the initial asset denial at the start of the show?
it had been a bit after I played that I got to that part lol
oh, now that you say it I get it, oof
tank in space is just a small battleship right? <:HibikiFingerguns:688429715836502063>
also makes ripping the videos off youtube less useful since the subs won't come with
just got confused by 2 guncannons and had to double take if they were gm's or not till I remembered what was said about the movies earlier lol
ok watched some of the side 6 battle in the movie, the sfx is the sound from the stand-alone sfx clips you posted exactly, just not the dbz one (as we've agreed to disagree)
yeah when ibo being on youtube was mentioned by that dev blog they mentioned some large number of subbed languages
nice
saw the gundam evo dev blogs mentioning ibo being available I think but didn't know this was a long running thing
oh they rotate free shows?
lol, opened up the 3rd gundam movie on netflix and it's rated tv-ma for nudity <:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
which makes far more sense for heightened senses than messing around with glassware
as I said, the dbz one sounds like edited sonar
one is an initial sound giving off reverb and the other is multiple notes building up
there's a difference between playing a scale on some glassware and a ping with reverb
ok, the dbz one does have some echo
the first one is a rapid fire of sounds, the second is one single sound
but still the first one sounds like playing some drink glasses while the dbz one sounds like pitched up sonar
if the one from that dbz clip was used that wouldn't be as silly as the sfx you posted before
that sound is shorter and slightly different than the audio you showed earlier
even so such a bright sound for "space brains"
also this made me laugh more than it should have <:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
spy x family continues to be quite fun and it's nice seeing the family bonds strengthen a bit
and even in the us, better to apologize for the bombs than call out your important asian ally in the cold war
yup
still I think the message would have worked better if they weren't made to be space nazis, but making them obviously the japanese empire probably would have made the show bomb more in japan than it already did initially
also fits them giving off a more ww1 german vibe as the western writings the japanese gernals took a liking to were less the writings of hitler, and more the writings of ww1 german generals advocating for total war
yeah, thinking about it, zeon is more ww2 japan wearing ww1 german clothes
yeah, ww1 may be a better "was is bad" reference but for japan it was just kicking out the germans from a few island colonies for a seat at the big boys' table
which makes the nazi stylings even more out of place, would be like a world war 2 story were all the best pilots on both sides are blondes with special blonde powers
like, was the colony drop not enough, did you have to make them nazis on top of that?
with these elements I just feel making them the bad guys due to being a warcrime committing dictatorship for the "war bad because even when war good you can't trust people who would war" works better than making them partially led by a self proclaimed hitler follower talking about superior races
so again, making them sapce nazis instead of the space german empire is kinda an odd choice
though if they were going to put in ww1 elements and have a story focused on "war is bad, there are good and bad people on both sides" why did they even choose to make them space nazi's instead of sticking with just the more morally grey first world war, would fit the message better
and even with them being space nazis they do take a lot of ww1 elements too (their top pilot was a guy born in the upper class who paints his crafts red)
as I said in the past, you could see them a bit as ww1 Germans before that (abusing civilian populations in their way, using inhumane attacks that get banned by treaty, a relatively new nation trying to become a major power), but now that superior race talk is involved (even without the hitler name drops) they are definitely Nazis
Part way into 39, wow Zeon leadership went from manipulative war criminals to full Nazi real quick 'superior races' 'you sound like that out of touch guy hitler' 'oh yeah hitler existed, guess I am a hitler follower' 'ok son, good luck, just remember hitler lost' wat <:ShemHaWhat:929756727493132288>
well we met her back on the neutral colony, this is just her first time in a armor
yeah, the reactions and links are fine, just the musical "calling out" death machine and mind reading where pretty stupid in 38
well glad I already wasn't planning to go beyond zeta in UC
oh dear....
Gundam episode 38, huh they really have gone from newtypes just being enhanced reflexes with slight mental link to weaponized nonsense and mind readers in a single episode <:MikuSigh:688429722799308883>
episode 4 ends at the apartment after the interview
elegant!
and not a fan of the love triangle and accidental pervert tropes
also didn't like when the 2 advanced mechs fought, since it just became an energy blast contest of power
yes, but hated the non mecha combat episodes, especially how for most of them they completely reset all character progression each time
haven't looked into it much, just heard it was one of the better recent mecha shows
no, it is on my watchlist already though
I guess my preferred japanese mecha designs all have a link to votoms I guess lol (given the gundam with my preferred designs, 08th, started with the mellowlink director lol)
ah
Ryosuke Takahashi?
yeah, looks like a mix of what I'm looking for and a rockem sockem robot
tank based is preferred, but just any mecha with a more practical military look  and less a blocky human look
any others, or just that?
I was less asking for inpsirations and more just mecha that have that style in my initial question
found this video on titanfall's mech designs and all that's mentioned is hollywood kitbashing, grounded military, and gameplay requirements- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWgByQiDhpE
speaking of mech design, are there any mecha anime outside of votoms that go for a more tank inspired design like western military sci-fi?
with axe feet
and yet they let him make another "sell toys to kids" show and were surprised when only an older audience watched it <:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
ah, just every video I watch on gundam just mentions super robots
also it fits on the push back on super robots, since weren't they kinda a response to the nukes?
Demon Slayer (both seasons and the movie), some isekai I forget the name of, and she has just started Madoka Magica with one of her friends
so when what we're watching comes up it's a lot of "I've heard of that but haven't seen that" on my end
also she plans on showing symphogear to those friends next semester <:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
so apparently my sister has been watching more anime than me recently thanks to her college friends <:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
yeah, I already have watched the first episode of 0080 today, plan to watch that, then thunderbolt, then 0083. after that I'll decide whether I want to watch origin or zeta next
looking forward to moving on to the OVAs but I don't think I'll be rewatching MSG or watching the MSG movie trilogy anytime soon
finished Mobile Suit Gundam during my inability to sleep last night, tbh the whole last segment is more goofy than anything even if there are some cool moments here and there. Probably the best section of the show was from Ramba Ral till Texas, the start and the end just where kinda meh for different reasons
guess I now have 2 cute/fun shows currently airing to watch between catching up on grounded mecha animes from the past
started watching Love After World Domination because someone posted a screenshot here and said it was cute, have now watched all 4 of the current episodes and can confirm <:MikuPraise:585839808765493249>
ik
I know but from what I've seen as an outsider a lot of them lean on jrpg or mmo tropes
but yeah, half of infinity is still infinity
fair, but you chop off a lot when you get rid of the ones that mainly lean on video game tropes
think it was one of the ones that leaned more on the middle ages europe part of the magic/middle ages/video game tropes the genre uses
yeah it was one I recognized the name of (from my watching of gigguk season in a nutshell videos probably) but I can't recall it off the top of my head
they say this is the neutral colony side 6 but they treat it like some out of the way federation colony (like side 7 at the very start of msg), just make a new colony that's not side 6 if it isn't treated like side 6
also there are just fed gms patrolling within the boundary of this neutral colony to fight off the zeon distraction attack?
like in msg, everything is very strict and neither side is willing to do anything within the boundary, even with the priority target of white base and gundam vulnerable. But in 0080 we just have zakus and gms fighting each other inside before they even know there is anything important going on?
watching 0080 and now I kinda wish I didn't watch the original series because now I'm just confused about side 6's neutrality status
if it was in a 24 episode season I don't think anyone would care
like, it's a decent filler arc as far as clone wars filler arcs go, just that it takes up a third of the final season
still a great season overall though
kinda wish 7's middle arc didn't feel like past seasons' minor/filler arcs given it was the last season and the season was only half length
yeah gundam music is along the lines of "it works"
well gundam music in general isn't something I get into
it wasn't annoying, just wasn't something I could enjoy
tbh, the one thing I didn't fully enjoy was the fact my music taste didn't line up with theirs <:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
also it's a gm in there, not the gundam
eh, I grew up reading clone wars content pre and post clone wars tv show, this is fine lol
well that's the first thunderbolt movie done, liked it a lot
I guess this thing wasn't fully retconned out with the 0079 movies lol
over half way through Gundam Thunderbolt December Sky, nice to see a gundam show acknowledge what a mess child pilots would actually be, panicking and unorganized, not top aces
gives me the vibe of pointing my webcam at the preview window

some cute fun every weekend
it's the first anime I've watched while it's airing and I think I made a good choice <:MikuPraise:585839808765493249>
you have gone through the revived animatic that sets up a new show, and the filler arc, time for the actual finale of the series
I've seen some ground stuff from thunderbolt, guess that's in the second movie?
I guess the question that would matter more for me, which has more footage?
yeah, depends whether you're turning a show into a movie or turning a movie into a show
like 08th is technially an ova, but 13 episodes puts it in short show territory
yeah, looking back for single digit episode series they are more a movie than a show
I usually stick with episode releases to comp movies (helps give me points for breaks), I actually only looked into the thunderbolt movies and learned they had some extra footage after the upload I found of the episodes had the hard subs a bit delayed (and were lowwer rez) <:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
now time decide whether for my next gundam show to jump forward in time to 0083 or back towards origin
I would say shame these don't have kits, but that wouldn't matter as nothing is in stock anywhere anyway <:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
also the mech designs and color schemes were cool
Compared to the first, the plot isn't as good and the music leans more towards annoying than a cool gimmick (and these issues are more prominent with the cult stuff). But it balanced out with the action and action variety being far better.
Finished the 2nd Gundam Thunderbolt movie.
cooler gm and blue submarine guncannon
yeah, shame my 2 favorites from the second movie don't have kits (though that wouldn't matter as nothing is in stock anyway)
though if I could trudge through full metal panic for the cool action arcs I could probably get through zz if I get around to it
does it make the kids in white base seem enjoyable relatively?
closest you get in thunderbolt is ||the brief bit of child brain professor in the second movie, but that's mild a brief||
yup
the story and music gimmik is kinda meh (especially in the 2nd movie) but the well done action and lack of any real annoying characters made them consistently enjoyable for me
and it's not always the gundam taking center stage
space, air, ice, underwater, jungle all done well
but yeah, back to speaking of doing great at certain aspects, loved the action variety in the second thunderbolt movie, like seeing fighters get some love- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=csOTcNiA2EA
yeah, this far in I think I've solidified nothing else in gundam is likely to dethrone 08th as my overall top, but some can surpass in aspects (0080 with message execution, thunderbolt with action)
uc timeline- hamburgers
like looking back it's kinda cringe me and the neighborhood kids on base played "ww2" when we were in okinawa as 7-8 year olds
well it's also the whole thing about how people (especially kids) see war differently as an outsider
yeah, while I found the kids annoying, I can't say I would want them cut out since that kills the well executed message
0080 does what it tries to do well for the whole show, but I wasn't personally entertained till the second half (since I find even well executed child characters annoying most of the time)
ok
but I'm not set on any order
currently my "plan to watch" in uc is origin, 0083, and zeta
not planning to watch zz anytime soon either
not really planning on cca in the near future, but are you saying I should wait till at least after zeta?
ok
also "in order" doesn't help when I'm done with the 1 year war stuff I want to see atm and am debating between before the original series(origin) or after (0083)
to be fair the only thing so far that was helped by watching others was thunderbolt being helped by the original
so you're saying that should be my next of the 2 I'm considering?
tend to already double watch half hour stuff (I watched 2 at a time for most of my 08th and 0080 watches)
well I think I'll prob stick to ovas for both
ah, ok
all I was asking was are the annoying zz characters more annoying than the annoying 0079 whitebase characters, wasn't assuming anything about who stuck around
they even made the guntank look cool and have a use (troop transport)
idk, been looking for that word ever since discovering mid-2000's lego animations (I got into lego animation in the early 2010's)
yeah, it's more clear than something like Dark Oblivion, which itself isn't too bad
haven't seen the most recent episode yet, but this music makes me look forward to it <:KirikaPog:605209108827734017>
Decided to not hop straight into watching G with my mom so tonight we watched the shorts compilation my parents watched on Netflix earlier this year, "Modest Heroes", which was cute, and I showed her "I Want to Eat Your Pancreas" which she quite enjoyed (she laughed at quite a few lines in the happier scenes and though it was very well done overall)
beyond that they just appeared in guide books
and the comic was from the series based on the original clone wars cartoon in style
the b-3 appeared in like one comic and one game
no, those where just republic commando styled b-2's
but yeah, destroyer droids/droidekas are my favorite
what's better than b2? b3
b-1's at least, b-2's where more menacing
comedy b1's are always a good time
so yeah, most of my stuff I finish lies in the 7-9
and for me a 6 was either "meh but I had no annoyances" or "good but regularly took me out of it with frustrations"
yeah for me the lowest I have rated a show is a 5 since anything lower wouldn't interest me / I wouldn't watch trough. That one 5 was a movie with a good start but a bland/unsatisfying middle and end, but since it was just a single segment ova I finished it
probably one of the many mods made by weebs in the 2000's<:GenjuroLaugh:689563633516150872>
what if she's a crate <:HibikiThink:688429715362414641>
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlV7-gQbRVU
you forget the other main target of the crowbar- crates
have no idea what this show is but that's a nice visual
the 0079 gals I mentioned had romances, but just not with the protag, and the protag had no interest in them
I said no romance with the protagonist, the kid is the protag in 0080
he's not a nothing to me, but that's because I find him annoying and stupid
though one thing gundam has been consistent with in what I've watched is female characters who don't have a romantic interest with the protagonist tend to be the better characters (at least on the fed side) Karen from 08th, Char's sister and the white base driver in 0079, test pilot in 0080, and mechanic gal in 0083
and yeah, 0083 hasn't crossed that point
to a point
half way through gundam 0083, overall the show is quite good but most of the characters are bland or annoying (probably the only character I actively like is the mechanic gal), ||also the coolest looking mech and the most likable test pilot died in the first battle||
though my family was more the type to get movies form the library
and hollywood video
yup
my family only has netflix because it comes with our cell phone plan, but my grandparents have had it since it was about mailing dvd's
on a brighter note, going to see if I still have the lego club mag with the ninjao teaser image
well people talk bionicle, and ninjago is pretty much the bionicle spiritual successor
ninjago has been going so long it's had 2 short (like half year) breaks of no new sets or show from toy and story 3-4 year plans reaching their end
a wave or 2 a year and those waves need advertising so....
I remember when the lego magazine and webiste was teasing a ninja theme... <:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
||speaking of ayla, read in some book the reason you see bly and her other clones repeatedly shooting her in ep 3 was to ensure she was dead and not suffering||
||like in bf2 (2005) that line about clones not bearing to look at ayla secura in the eye and glad they had helmets on  after she complimented them||
||yeah, how it was before and thought it was cool, with clones with bad generals jumping at the chance while others having remorse but still following orders||
and thus more likely to second guess 66
kinda miss arc troopers in the old canon not being just exceptional clones and instead exceptional clones allowed to have more independent thought
||they don't carry the weight of how the old canon did 66, but yeah if most clones we see are very much friends with the jedi can be a bit of a mess||
you mean like the force planet/family arc? or more like ||the brain chips||?
also it gives clones more personality and character which is great
due to having more episodes it isn't as consistently good, but it has a lot of amazing episodes and arcs
though rex was originally supposed to be alpha (and was changed to rex becuase too many A names in the main cast) so I guess alpha lives on that way
while I love cg clone wars kinda sad fordo from the cartoon and alpha from the comics got ret-conned out of existence
and of the arc troopers, captain fordo is the best- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1GjQyHYIPU
I have watched the arc trooper parts of 2003 clonewars so many times
tbh I prob would would like 0079 more if it used doom music in action scenes <:HibikiFingerguns:688429715836502063>
doom music memes are great, yeah <:ChrisDJ:690470897194369034>
cool their early announcements are more detailed than their store page descriptions <:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
also still just in SD
did some research and birdy the mighty decode does exist on prime video in japan but only as a 30 day rental...
also it only exists in dvd quality
at least as far as I can tell
so in a better state than birdy the mighty: decode then <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
well I bought a used xbox one s when I have a gaming pc for more than just halo 5
~~or pirate the rips~~
like if you want to know what the discotek gear blu-rays have as special features beyond "clean op and ed and much more" you have to go find reviews
though while that's safe to assume, we won't know for sure till someone gets their copy as they suck at advertising what exact special features their gear bd's have
After Japan eventually gets their expensive complete box set
Currently have the OPs of Birdy the Mighty: Decode stuck in my head, prob should rewatch that show soon
Also the time hopping of the show is limited by character outfits changing and clones going from ep 2 armor to ep 3 armor a few seasons in
Oh hey, my dad is also doing a chronological clone wars rewatch atm
Btw, why is zeta the only gundam show on funnimation that hasn't come over to crunchyroll after the merger?
Was planning on watching some other mecha instead of more gundam after this but since it ended setting up the titans might check out a few episodes of zeta first
still had some decent characters though (Mora, the Albion's commander, Burning, and most of the Zeon characters), shame most of the focus was on the more annoying characters. <:MikuSigh:688429722799308883>
Finished Stardust Memory. The action, soundtrack, and designs were great and the overall plot was pretty good as well. Could have been a 9/10 but a few too many consistently stupid/annoying characters on the protagonist side who get a lot of screen time (Bernard, Keith, Kou, and Nina) brought it down to an 8/10 for me.
probably going to finish 0083 tonight
Yeah, Nina was the lesser of the annoying/dumb characters I listed (at least until towards the end), so I could see her easily improved without making her totally different
like even after the stream people were guessing which was which wrong <:Ver:704169051391524875>
who knows, I know a lot of their hints last time were very indirect <:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
but they did say there will be updates
my guess is they won't waste hints on anime that are just updates from past announcements
as usual, just their self described "unhelpful clues and hints" thread- https://twitter.com/discotekmedia/status/1527818224078770177
Ty for the cool trailer to watch while I wait for my movie <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
Though it was kinda spoiled for me by the animatics released years ago
Oh yeah, the bad batch arc in clone wars was good
Yeah I'm mister "bad batch was meh" (had some good moments though and I've always liked Echo)
like how westerns tend to end with a sunset
well beaches fit the calm a lot of endings go for more than the hype most openings go for
like an Eastern European is going to be more likely to set a story in the snow than someone in Hawaii
not directed at anyone
just a statement
you make what's familiar to you, especially with settings
also japan is an island chain so lots of beaches around
Yeah the ammount of newtype stuff in the first episode or 2 was bordering on silly (mental broadcast of heavy breathing) <:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
though I am liking early Zeta episodes Kamille more than early 0079 episodes Amuro
I mean so far the titan gal is a more interesting character than the protag <:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
started zeta gundam last night, 4 episodes in
ah, ok
what's it about?
I mean if we include p-bandai stuff in general there might be some unique accessories , but yeah, the model it self is never unique
but this is a pretty nice choice of colors for a re color
tbh without the box art and band name on it that would just be a pretty cool monochrome gunpla
Sounds like Hibiki's nightmare
What show?
Speaking of seasonals, caught up on a few eps of spy x family after dinner, forgot how often this show makes me smile <:HibikiBlep:605209109284782090>
if it's one season/movie why is mellowlink and votoms separate boxes? the gundam ovas don't get their own boxes
I mean even some long running western kids shows don't realy have seasons, but that's usually like pbs kids stuff where they throw a few new episodes into mix for the constant cycle or re runs
Insert Doofenshmirtz 2 nickels meme
So apparently both of the shows I'm watching this season brought in an obsessed younger sibling at the same time...
probably was designed with the intent of being escorted by its sister units
guess you want that in target tumble like bullets for max damage in case it doesn't go off <:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
speaking of 0083, getting tired of waiting for the ground gundam to be restocked anywhere (not interested in the black version), so might get this as my first gunpla-
Just finished The Price of Smiles, enjoyed the show and characters but the rushed happy ending was a let down
manga are graphic novels you read the wrong direction <:KanadeWink:690470895608791040>
that's around the time the steam summer sale usually is going on, late june must be awful for the wallets of deal addicted nerds <:Ver:704169051391524875>
still have them actually I think
but the only animated show I ever owned on dvd growing up was like the first 4 seasons of clone wars
also watched a video talking about the endless eight arc
oh, seen images of these characters even before I got into anime <:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
what's this from?
did some more googling, that's around the length of the scholastic junior novelizations of each of the star wars movies, so my guess of "like kids novels" checks out
yeah was already guessing they were aimed at the teen to young adult market given how they are often adapted into anime
did some googling, so about half the average star wars or halo novel
short novels that include images? so pretty much kids novels but for teens and grown-ups
what exactly is a "light novel"? like what are they besides novels that are made in japan that amines pick from when they don't want to adapt a manga?
"the dark souls of manga" <:Ver:704169051391524875>
I am definitely looking forward to some info, the designs we've seen are cool but I want to know a bit about the setting/plot before I get hyped
I mean I would hope we get information soon given the prologue is supposed to come out "this summer" and we're already in summer
~~gundam last shooting~~
(which germany ended up not actually getting that far on due to a mix of lack of interest and most of their pre-war nuclear scientist being jewish)
pacifist einstien literally only helped with the us nuke because he was afraid germany was working on one
also wat
why is this in manga direction?
~~even if most get re-uploaded by fans in the west anyway~~
I guess it gives talking points for western gundam youtubers' vpn sponsor spots <:Ver:704169051391524875>
like they're not even trying to get the west to care
still with the new movie they've said nothing about western releases and have region locked every official trailer/clip upload
though it's weird they do it for things without any announced western plans, like how many military members are going off base to get a gundam blu ray?
bandai- region lock all trailers and promos but make western exports and piracy easy <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
and the blu rays included english subs too <:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
thanks bandai for selling blu rays at the japanese theaters so us westerners can get pirated versions fast <:Ver:704169051391524875>
speaking of which, time to watch a pirated version of that new gundam movie <:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
As someone who found the original Gundam show pretty meh for the most part (but with some highlight episodes and moments for sure though), I enjoyed this movie more than most of the episodes of the show it's set in the middle of. <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
Just finished the Doan's Island Gundam movie, I quite enjoyed it. The plot and characters were decent (but not exceptional) and the few actions scenes were pretty good. <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
Apparently more info about gwitch is coming friday, though kinda odd info beyond the teaser and a few mechs has been silent for so long with the prologue not far off
Not worried, I just always explain myself even when uneeded <:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
Hey if they are not selling to me I see no issue on pirating (though I do often pirate to check out a show first anyway)
Torrents and 9anime already have it up due to the theater bd release with english subs. And given they've said nothing about a western release and region locked all promos, I feel more justified than usual.
so off and on watching Macross Delta atm and was looking up some music from it and it turns out people have had similar thoughts to me about one part of a song from that show <:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvqXCK9tD7o
It's just most I have seen in my watching through uc stuff have been <:GenjuroLaugh:689563633516150872>
No whiney boy main  protag <:MikuPraise:585839808765493249>
Well this spring season is the first time I've ever watched new anime as it releases
Yeah I kinda want to know the basic premise to see if I'd be interested or not
Also I just like the almost brother sister type, caring but poking fun, interactions of the main 2 characters
Yeah those 2 elements I don't care for much, but I've been enjoying the other aspects
Have a hard time commiting to that compared to 13 and 24 ep shows
The original Macross is one of the older shows I plan to watch but with that and Votoms I always pick another to start because old mecha and 50+ episode series <:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
But as far as mashup goes the first one I posted works best for me as it's kinda what my brain was expecting when she started singing "whoa" <:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
Fair
I prefer the eurobeat version <:MariaSunglasses:336656798687690752> https://youtu.be/5YLrgUeOhGU
The license has been sat on for years so the only options are old dvds, pirated old dvd rips, and standard def digital rentals on amazon japan
There are none <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
birdy is cooler than whoever that is <:KirikaSmug:607742561414676517>
well time to get to ripping these dvd's to my pc <:ElfneinWeld:586027421296492585>
also glad the art is reversible given the ugly "s.a.v.e" branding
Just got a dvd set I've wanted for a while, Birdy the Mighty: Decode <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
dubbing and cleaning up shows most companies have moved on from
also you could argue just knowing the outline, not the details, could be a good thing when trying to adapt a short "bad" thing into a longer better thing
given Tomino had it yoinked from most releases I guess it makes sense even someone working on the franchise hadn't seen it and just knew a synopsis
though I kinda want to experiment with ai upscaling on an episode
watching my new birdy the mighty dvds, while the low dvd rez does mean I can see the jagged edges on things, still better than the jagged edges plus blocky compression of the internet uploads of the show <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
some lupin stuff I think
well they are both animated by statelight <:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
but also I'm only half way through (13/26) so I can't give a solid review atm
also the first scene of some episodes are brief explainers of relevant universe stuff
it's my first macross and besides some name drops that aren't plot relevant (Freyja listing musicians from past shows while images of them appear when talking about the music that inspired her, and one of the supporting characters being the grandchild of ace pilots from a past show, again with images clearly in an older show's style popping up) it appears pretty standalone
"no! no! I didn't mean it that way!"
the right one comes off more as did/said something she thought was embarrassing and is immediately realizing and regretting that
All the singers are when performing in delta tbh
She's cute, especially when she and the guy who's the other mc poke fun at each other <:HibikiBlep:605209109284782090>
Because it's what I'm currently watching, that sheet is making me think of Freyja from Macross Delta
Ok, here's the prologue info
Any news on prologue date?
I have stated I like aerial's design though
yeah I know nothing about the people behind gundam shows and designs so wouldn't guess on such a thing <:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
all I said on the show before was "want to know about the conflict a bit before I get hyped" <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095> never made any guesses
I guess another one of those cases of something existed for a while but it's oldest common memory is the thing that popularized it
just saying that might be the lineage
I feel things like the zaku heat hawk, heated/energy coated blades probably came first in sci-fi before full beam swords
though the biggest force in energy blade popularity in sci-fi was star wars which didn't come out that long before gundam (77 vs 79), but yeah, probably things pre-dating even lightsabers
(2 seasons + the ova of birdy the mighty:decode, witchblade, and the cgi lupin the 3rd movie were the only anime I watched beyond an episode or two before January 2022)
to be fair all but 5 of these are from this year <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
and here I am with my tiny list <:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
looking at the trailer for the delta movie, the weird cgi performance at the start is odd but the rest looks good. Also, ||looks like it will still have a focus on hayate and freyja's relationship and also continue on with her worsening condition from the end of the show <:HibiMikuCry:586026583870013455> ||
fair, but as someone who hasn't really imported much double dipping isn't a worry
definitely grabbing a macross delta bd if a western release comes
also it's been a bit over a year since the legal mess of macross in the west got mostly resolved
well hey at least now the west might get some
* checks mal * oh hey, yeah there is one that came out late last year
I know there's a compilation movie, there's more than that?
-sci-fi
-powerful relics from past civilization
-singing that has special abilities, mainly used by a color coded squad of females in conflict zones
-special crystal looking pendant the resonates with certain songs
-girl with short blonde hair who hopes her song can make everyone happy and stop fighting
-antagonists want to bring justice, peace, and unity but in immoral ways (motivated by the past)
-a schemeing grey haired white robe wearing researcher antagonist who uses others to further his own plans
-protagonists' group often do special assignments for the UN
-"fun uncle" type leader who always relates his messages to a certain interest of his
-guy in charge of the group is big and skilled in martial arts (and trains others in it) but is always running the bridge
-the pink and green ones are the most gay pair and also contain the most energetic and quietest of the group
||-most japanese team member shows little emotions, isn't a fan of a new member at first, and likes a singing red head||
||-final threat is a something left by the advanced life seeding race that can turn their creations into a giant mind linked network (and this is facilitated by taking control of a protagonist girl)||
||-main girl is able to get people to snap out of it to help fight back||
||-main girl commits to her love to nuetralize the threat then leads people singing together||
||-member of the enemy group aids in the final fight||
-animated by Satelight in the middle of the 2010's
and while it's good on it's own it was funny seeing how many symphogear parallels it had throughout <:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
While as expected I didn't really care about the idol group aspects of it the music and characters were enjoyable, the action was fun, and the two main protagonist where each likable on their own and very cute when interacting together. Went in expecting it to just be above average, came out with it being on the lower end of my top 10.
Just finished Macross Delta, and wow, I liked it more than I though I would <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
rightstuff often sells the gear bds around 30 (when I bought season one with no sale going for it going on it was for $29.96), and amazon also consistently sells them for around 30, though they bounce up and down a few bucks there ($29.49 for season 2 atm) so the msrp is pretty irrelevant these days as neither official retailer sells them for that. And saving a few bucks off the usual price isn't much when shipping is $5-7 (and if your buying from this sale for gear stuff, there isn't $75 worth of discounted symphogear to reach the free shipping threshold)
$5 off what it usually sells for, almost enough to make up for the shipping <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
you sell a popular thing at cost or at a loss in hopes people will buy things you make a better profit from while there
unless it's a single popular thing, then you might have a loss leader
but yeah, aside from memberships, what ever the lowest something goes on sale for when they still restock it afterwards is likely at or slightly above what they payed for it in bulk
yeah, loss leaders is another strategy
so 20% off is still profit
retail buys in bulk for a discount (how buying from lego walmart is often the same price as from the lego website), so they likely get 25-30% off a pallet or something
besides japan, usa is probably the best place to be an anime fan, same bd region, commerce center, world trade language and big consumer market so most likely to get subs/dubs, etc.
I get the company part, if I have a haul that passes the free shipping threshold and the prices are similar I would go for rightstuf over the faster prime
and when the amazon price isn't far off and most either have prime or have a spare email for a prime free trial for free (and faster) shipping, I don't think it's a big enough sale to really care <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
but yeah, loved all the types of combat in the 2nd despite the more meh story (space, air, ice, under water, swamp/river, a non-mech dog fight)
the action is more varied though
less jazz, more annoying monk chants
think it's in the scene that is the end of the first and beginning of the second
also the G fighter appears again in thunderbolt, so not completely ret-conned <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
never watched the trilogy <:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
well the shield (2 actually) is part of the mech in the flying combo mode <:HibikiFingerguns:688429715836502063>
I guess the original would rank high on most often damaged, but only if you count shields as part of the mech
shame his suicidal tendencies <:MikuSigh:688429722799308883>
also in a ramba ral fight the cockpits of both mechs are breached and they talk through the holes
yeah with the electrical whip thing
I know at least its shield is constantly lost
didn't the original gundam need constant repairs and replacement parts in the show?
and if you go beyond the main one, Karen's is beheaded and gets a gm head
then the ez-8 is completely lost
the main gundam of 08th, completely lost and then replaced with the ez-8
most competent member of the 08th ms team
when my rx-79(g) comes in I'm going to use use the stickers for Karen's number <:KanadeSmile:672455286392356884>
like the eva pack space shuttle astronauts have used
small thrusts to adjust direction and momentum
also from my watch of the first episode of votoms last night, love the realistic style space pack they had (especially as someone who was into irl space vehicles growing up)
so far from my anime experience my fav mech design is probably the scope dog from the votoms franchise (but I'm not buying the recent game plus dlc to play that)
I do prefer ground pounders anyway
unless robotech came out there I don't think so
ok so that would only explain the most recent release
ah
and that didn't even cover the original series
maybe the western licensing issues that were only resolved a year ago
oh, also since I got my mental break from war mecha with macross delta, I started the original votoms last night
I'm being light hearted about it
are you saying there's a franchise threshold where you should start playing?
of course a plane mecha would have a fan amv with highway to the danger zone, ty youtube recommendations <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720> - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIU_0G2adfs
so anime being colored high fps manga makes even more sense <:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
well isn't a lot of outsourced animation work done in korea?
yeah, and most would probably get more use out of a month of crunchy anyway, so probably the best choice for legally watching that
well once spy x family finishes its first season tomorrow I'll be back to purely catching up on past stuff till season 2 of that and/or the new gundam show comes out
Just finished Love After World Domination (it and spy x family have been the first 2 seasonal anime I've kept up with), fun and cute throughout, albeit quite basic <:ChrisHappy:660870796696223744>
also probably makes it so they can't just be emp'd and knocked out
well also I guess a reason the oyw had both interference and a nuke ban
talking about ads reminded me of this video- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_LP7h0ZgvlE
so an active defense system, like with some modern tanks, cool <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
though if people are talking while the fight is happening that's harder to justify that way
also, who knows, maybe the missiles and plasma are normal and we're watching the super fast vehicles in slow-mo <:YumiPoint:688429724103344164>
well also most missiles (and even energy projectiles) in fiction are really slow moving for dramatic effect on top of that <:GenjuroLaugh:689563633516150872>
smh, fox 3 ruining jet dog fights <:MikuSigh:688429722799308883>
but yeah, totally agree with your statement, without a forced reason to cut tracking range combat would be more boring to watch (why no one makes realistic modern jet engagements in movies)
not just cruise missiles, since the days of f-14's just normal air to air missiles have been able to fire beyond visual range
also maybe if you direct impacted one the air and shrapnel released could help with hitting the rest around it
though a nuke could probably emp a space fleet
caring about mal ratings aside from your own <:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
Just finished episode 12 of spy x family. Nice to get a family life / spy episode after the run of school episodes (which tbh I don't enjoy as much). One odd thing, even though this is an end of a set of episodes, the amount of re-explaining things made it feel like of start of the 2nd run, not the end of the first. ||Also, though it was short and simple, my favorite part of the episode was probably the Yor kick followed by the 2 "wow."s||
||they clearly bring up getting rid of the sci-fi power source everything had been built on would make things more desperate, and people can still right each other with older tech||
price of smiles didn't have that much gay
||like they talk all about how just getting rid of the sci-fi weapons won't fix all the conflicts and struggles going on, but in the end it pretty much does||
I say forced more about how it got to the happy ending, not that i had a happy ending
one set of main characters is the idealistic princess and those around her who's country is being invaded, and the other is a squad of mech pilots from the invading country
mecha show, cutting between both sides of the conflict
also the finale wasn't one of those that soured the build up to it (unlike something like price of smiles, who's rushed and forced happy ending took it from a 8/10 to a 7/10 for me)
yeah, but it had so many great moments consistently in the episodes outside the finale that vivy is still solidly in my top 10
yeah, vivy's finale episodes were it's weakest point
yeah, apparently I missed out not watching anime last year (since Vivy is, and I think 86 will be, in my top 10)
though one confusing thing, crunchyroll labels all the dubs as season 1 but the sub as season 2 (despite them all being the same episodes)
so I decided to start watching 86 yesterday...went through 7 episodes in one evening <:HibikiWhoops:585839808115507222>
but yeah that 2nd arc is probably my favorite, ||the younger sister stuff||, the fight, and the ai sisters' song were all stuff that hit hard
also the distorted yell is great, both in the sub and dub
yeah, that fight slaps
don't recall that line and there's multiple cool fights, be more specific
it even made me tear up from both a mix of happiness and sadness in the 2nd arc ||when the younger sister of the original girl interacts with vivy|| <:MikuCry:688397678584791074>
I agree
like at the start Vivy has a friend who visits who's a young girl who pretty much treats her as a big sister and friend, and later on she's pretty much the original ancestor to all the other advanced androids around and treated like a grandparent, but she never really  has any romantic interest for any one, and since the show time skips pretty hard each arc any other relationships don't stick around. She just strives for her created mission- make everyone happy with her singing
||finished watching it early this month and I don't recall anything about energy from the air. They were just like "things were getting polluted in the past as we industrialized but then we found this mineral that happened to be on this planet under our very noses that could make even more energy while also being completely clean"||
there isn't really a focus on romantic relationships in vivy (except the arc about the guy who married an android), given the protag is more a parent/guardian figure for those she cares for and outlives everyone around her
||but until the end they just thought the crystals had the power in them, in the air was only after the nanobot reveal or maybe talking about energy let off by the crystals||
like the crystals lego mars mission
well power crystals are a trope in sci-fi so I thought of them more as that than magic crystals as I am far more into sci-fi than fantasy
so it's not really any more magic than any sci-fi reactor
it's a mineral that's a powerful and clean energy source, especially when refined, it's pretty much treated as safer and more powerful nuclear energy ||until they learn the mineral is just siphoning the energy from terraforming nano bots||
so why do you keep calling it magic?
even from the start they tech is never considered magic
but back to positive things, lucky I decided to back to back watch shows I was mildly curious about that turned out to be really enjoyable (macross delta then now 86)
should have either been longer or the other episodes should have been trimmed down to give the wrap up more time
but I feel none of the issues with the show was its concepts or ideas, more they tried to wrap up everything built over a bunch of episodes in 1-2 episodes
also even "original" stuff can take heavy inspirations from existing stories and legends
I don't pay attention to manga so I wouldn't know unless the manga was part of the show hype (like spy x family)
there was the ballet one gigguck joked about the neck lengths in his nutshell video
the real issue is down the road when people will try to do a bunch of shows in a similar style/setup (but worse execution) due to spy x family doing so well <:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
I think with spy x family most people just wanted something cute and fun with good animation, which it accomplished. They weren't looking for anything ground breaking.
Finished part 1 of the anime last night, very much agree
I guess they bother me less as since I don't read comics or manga but I like animated stuff, so adaptations that haven't been done before are original to me
ah
Started the second part of 86 tonight. While so for not as engrossing and/or impactful as any of the first part so far, I have quite enjoyed the first 2 episodes of it. ||The last of the kids being rescued instead of dead, while it does reduce the impact a little, imo I'd rather see more from these characters than just completely cycle to a new set. Speaking of which, it is so nice seeing them have at least a bit of enjoying normal life after all the crap they've gone through.||
speaking of which, Lupin the 3rd is just Tintin if he was a Japanese thief instead of a European journalist <:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
also I now have filled out my favorites list on mal with a full 10 (took like 35 watched to get to that, lol)-
Finished the 2nd part of 86 tonight. While I did not like it as much as the first part (less hard hitting and the new young girl, while not being pointless, was a bit too consistently annoying), but a 9/10 part 2 to a 10/10 part 1 isn't really a bad thing. One thing I did like more than part one was the ending, very hopeful and satisfying. One nitpick I will give to the happy ending though ||is while the team surviving after being left behind was something I was expecting and was fine with (tbh for a bit I thought the fire support in the final battle was them catching up, not Lena's forces) I think Raiden surviving that point blank railgun blast after he was already damaged was kinda confusing.||
I'm typing up my reaction to finishing 86 atm
ok, skimmed the episode, ||he is definitely still in it as this first image is the shot right before the railgun shoots, and after fido and his jug go separate ways on the field|| but then I looked at the impact shot ||as you can see in the second image there is literally nothing, especially not a jug, at the soon to be point of impact. Guess the big bad is an awful shot <:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611> ||
to be fair the movie is pretty good
Well my only macross so far is delta, so that doesn't really apply for me
The bacteria just mess with minds, not vend space time, the space time stuff is the ancient tech
The finale does get goofy, though it reminded of xv's ending battle tbh
Idk who alto is
What's wrong with Delta?
Since they showed some Zettai Live, wonder when/how it will first release in the west. Though probably torrents of the october Japanese blu ray release will come first
Better than Japan bd prices
Was editing
Yeah typo
Well macross isn't currently streaming anywhere in the west
Glad I only grabbed some of the cds and not the blu rays on my recent buyee spree <:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
Makes sense since they just released the movie version of it in american theators yesterday
Checked back at their twitter, the panel includes a sneak peak at the delta sequel movie- https://twitter.com/MACROSS_BIGWEST/status/1542961240032550912?s=20&t=JTS07CdCUVRGd46gtiJ2OQ
Also I'm pretty sure there is soon or currently a macross movie in some theators in america
Well on the english macross twitter the images used when promoting the panel have been plus and delta images, so maybe the delta sequel movie might get a western release (or at least the compilation film)
My last anime purchase was a dvd, but it was a show only ever released on dvd
So hey I guess you can set aside that na blu ray complaint
Guess I'll support 86 by getting the cool juggernaut general use model kit
My viewing experience will have the 9anime watermark for a while then <:Ver:704169051391524875>
Guess I'll hope for a sale in the future
Ty
Link to details?
Though speaking of western bd's, why is there no news on western bd releases for vivy or 86? They even have english dubs already.
Like I'll never import those stupid 2-4 episode bds or crazy collectors boxes that japan releases anime on
Hey it's kept me off doing as many f2p shooter game mtx so my spending overall is slightly down after anime (though I am more picky with what and at what price)
Personal enjoyment, media preservation through physical ownership, and supporting a franchise you like <:KirikaPog:605209108827734017>
Nice <:HibikiFingerguns:688429715836502063>
I think they mean the bds themselves
Was expecting that though
September
I did watch the first episode of the original last night and so far so good (but definitely a very different style from delta)
Yeah, I'm looking forward to seeing it when either it comes out in the west or torrents of the japanese bd release come in october
It's ok
Yeah the mc only really shines when poking fun back and forth with freyja
Hey I wouldn't call myself a general macross fan after only one series
so sadly this is probably the closest to a bd sdf release the west is getting for a while- https://www.rightstufanime.com/Robotech-Part-1-The-Macross-Saga-Blu-ray
SDF is the one series still held hostage in the west after the rights agreement last year, as that's the one that got licensed for robotech
Oh, didn't see that screenshot, guess a non-announcement panel is going on
I think yesterday was the only macross specific panel, but today the companies handling the stuff announced yesterday (like rightstuf) have panels with more details
also I installed some ace combat 7 skin mods recently- https://www.nexusmods.com/acecombat7skiesunknown/mods/1057?tab=images https://www.nexusmods.com/acecombat7skiesunknown/mods/1006?tab=images
gerwalk looks better than mech mode anyway <:GenjuroLaugh:689563633516150872>
at most I'm putting in gerwalk, but I'm happy if I just have plane mode
"micro scale" as it's called in the lego fan base, smaller than minifig scale
I'm actually working on designing a lego vf-31j
"skull leader" even copies the jolly rogers markings/colors <:GenjuroLaugh:689563633516150872>
well it is inspired by the irl classic, the f-14
can't decide if I like dellta's next gen style planes or sdf's space f-14's more <:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
just started watching the original macross myself <:HibikiFingerguns:688429715836502063>
never watched that show and not really a fan of standard magical girls or cat girls, but that is a pretty well done transformation <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Hey, does anyone know what changes were made between Macross Delta and the compilation movie? Since I watched a youtube video that's the first few minutes of the sequel movie and some things didn't seem to line up with the show <:HibikiWhat:336656482907193344>
ah, makes sense
how much of that is species getting closer to extinction and how much of that is finding new species that are also near extinction?
https://macross.fandom.com/wiki/Freyja_Wion
also the status info box is right below the b-day box I was looking for <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
well it's the general macross wiki
I was just trying to see if art posted with "b-day" on it was for the b-day of the person tagged or the character's b-day, so I actively avoided looking at all but the side bar <:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
though speaking of freyja, hayate, and health ||one thing that bugged me during the hayate going beserk stuff is they never thought to try taking off hayate's relic necklace to see if that was a factor||
idk how the first movie did things, but in the show, ||freyja's failing health and her and hayate's different life spans anyway was the main plot thread left to explore anyway imo, so that is the logical direction to go||
though at least the show set that up as an eventuality and the 2nd movie's trailer|| hinted at her failing health even more|| so it wasn't really a twist
||that's the second movie, and since it isn't around to pirate or buy atm that's a spoiler for me... if I didn't try to find some info about her on the wiki and saw show- alive movie- dead on the side panel <:KirikaPanic:644235681677180958> ||
like what?
is one of those au changes ||green hair knight doesn't die? since in the 5 minutes shown on youtube of the second movie he's alive and doesn't even have the age markings.||
what a rare coincidence to kill an episode, oof
Also given the sequel movie that hasn't been released for home viewing yet jumps off from this one and apparently focuses on Freyja and her and Hayate's relationship I'm left wondering. Since they are still have a connection in the first movie but have pretty much had none of the relationship development or struggles (||Freya's crystallization was even reverted to a milder state at the end of the first movie||) of the show, will this focus in the second movie be a re-tred of the show's development of them they skipped over in the first movie, just with a different background threat and it going on a bit past where the show stopped with them(||given the wiki says she dies||)? I mean that wouldn't be bad since that relationship's  energy and progression was one of my favorite parts of the show, but would be "been there done that".
Just watched the movie version of Macross Delta. Tbh, I feel a straight compilation movie that just cuts all but the necessary would have actually been better than this mix of compilation and reimagining/au. Pretty much every change made just made the characters and plot much blander, and not just the standard compilation/recap rush (with the exceptions mainly being minor changes involving Messer, but it's not like what was changed needed significant improvement). 

Focusing less on just comparing the show and movie, the first half is rough. As bland as a recap episode from a tv show with singing moments that start very abruptly (including a very out of place CG music video seemingly pulled out of one of the digital concerts I've seen in my Youtube recommended ever since I looked up Delta music) and general oddly quiet sound mixing outside of the songs. In the second half it becomes a little enjoyable but without much impact, but choosing to place the funeral song scene at the end worked quite nicely.
well I guess you could still call it a budget issue since you have to budget both time and money
also only one was a recap, the other was a re-edit of past scenes for a dream episode
still 2 within 4 episodes around half way through
wait, I think I've seen a low budget anime knife fight memed before, that's from macross?
the 17 dream sequence/clipshow is the latest I've watched, so I don't think so
Did the original Macross have budget issues less than half-way through production? Since episodes 14 and 17 are both clipshows. <:ChrisBored:672575526346424351>
I think I'll watch without the auto translate mess, then enjoy the actual plot once subs exist
I've seen and watched worse quality
have a link?
I mean in the west it technically isn't even out yet <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
new kenny lauderdale video <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa3pAcaIgFk
come on Japan....
watching macross and a character's older first cousin is seriously considered a potential love interest of hers by other characters <:MikuSigh:688429722799308883>
so that's where that music is from
why I said the groups channels as I meant a mix of the full reviews on ltt and things like their news channel tech linked
I mainly stick with the linus media group channels and gamers nexus for general tech
well it is, just sucks at it
besides the name being a gaming/tech term
I stick with a range of online  individuals I trust to acquire news (especially for gaming) rather than sifting through the mess of gaming news sites
clickbait is one thing, but often gaming news sites go for the rage bait, or the "looking misinformed" bait to get people upset
having a few good pieces doesn't make the site as a whole not trash
no, that one is more trash than trashy harem animes
actually it would be more a "love web"
change to a different polygon
I feel 3 could be a harem if it's the type 1 harem  listed, but if it's the other 2 it's love triangle
good episode till ||Kaifun said he wouldn't be opposed to marrying his cousin, I now hate him even more, he's gone from annoying to flat out awful <:KirikaDisgust:688431636043268097>||
so I'm continuing to watch through the original macross... and there's just a shirtless guy staring straight forward while flexing his arm in the back of the arcade crowd <:ShemHaWhat:929756727493132288>
https://twitter.com/KennyLauderdal3/status/1549913434866819072
takes all the fightplane out of the fighterplane mechs
tbh I find battroid the most meh mode anyway <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
well gerwalk just takes up empty space between base and jet
though ground surface area wise they appear to take up similar space to a 1/100 base
even ignoring the shared studio and genre
It has a lot of gear parallels
apparently it's quite freyja focused, which makes sense since the retcon movie it's a sequel to skipped most of her and hayate's development from the show
yeah, looking forward to the second (whether that's a us theater release or torrents when the japan blu-ray comes out later in the year)
but yeah, I don't recomend the delta movie edit/reimagining, makes all the characters far more bland except ||the grim reaper's death is done a bit better||
they've shown 2 already and wouldn't be surprised if the delta sequel movie comes as back to back usa cons big west has/will appear at have/will show its trailer
7 is the one I'm not really interested in
in theators late last year the sequel movie to the (very boring) recap movie came out, but it doesn't get a home release in japan till later this year
well it's stated "they were both ace pilots that were on opposite sides" and that's mainly what was shown so far, atm I'm wondering how green and turquoise hair reaches dark red by the time mirage is born
though it's funny when they're brought up as the images that appear are clearly from and older show's art style <:GenjuroLaugh:689563633516150872>
mirage
I watched delta then moved on to og macross
tbh it wasn't that bad, though there was some meh lipsync
going through og atm
well even if it's a rushed marriage, still far better than the "I'd be fine with marrying my cousin" from the romance plot of last episode <:KirikaDisgust:688431636043268097>
wow, macross really took 2 characters from knife fight to married in less than half an episode huh <:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
I've built the cockpit but since this kit is very sticker/decal heavy and the stickers from 2016 are now pulling backing off with them (and thus have no stick left) I've had to postpone building till I get a hobby knife so I can cut-out the water decals it also came with
but speaking of the 1/72 kits I did get one when I ordered some stuff through buyee recently
and when it comes to humanoid mechs I like them more tank like so I would choose gundam or votoms (or titanfall if those ever existed) for humandoid mechs
I grew up being really into jet fighters, x-planes, and space race rockets so I like the plane and gerwalk modes
after work tonight I think I will finish the last couple episodes of the original macross <:MikuPraise:585839808765493249>
this frame from macross episode 30 is just the right balance of cute and cool at the same time <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
To be fair I found the whole triangle a mess. At least ||the hard-headed idealist whose also a scumbag and fine with cousin marriage was out of the picture by the end.||
Finished the original Macross earlier today. Overall I quite enjoyed it (at least more than the other older mecha I've watched, the original Gundam, which I found just ok). I did find 1 character and most of the romantic relationships frustrating. Also Minmay having like 3 songs that are constantly repeated got old fast (in the end my favorite song from the show was probably just Japanese Silent Night, not even one of the Minmay songs). But there were plenty of highlights to distract from the rougher bits.
since I found him more frustrating to watch than anything, I lost my patience with him being on screen very quickly
well not liking the character is one thing, feeling the desire to skip scenes he's in (though I never actually did) is another
guess they got all the hostility out early <:GenjuroLaugh:689563633516150872>
then they somehow end up as the most stable couple in the show <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
only times they've met before marriage: dogfighting-arcade comeptition-knife fight
well the knife fight was their first planned date, their first date technically was a heated arcade match <:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
unrelated to the relationships, but so glad somebody put together a full version of the electric guitar version of the theme that's inserted throughout the show
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oinXMf0FGEQ
funny considering how much of a mess their initial "romance" was
in the end the only pairing I actually really liked was the green and blue haired aces
yeah but since we have a lot of tech/media companies (including a lot of the big movie studios) US is usually where new streaming services start (like Disney movies being removed from Netfllix here first since we got Disney+ first)
since this is a part 2 trailer on a non-regional english language account, maybe that means Netflix through money at the rights to part 2 for america after seeing how popular part 1 was
yeah, media is a lot more split up for streaming in america <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
16.6k? so this is just personal trending not global or national
why I said mainly, sure a gundam fan might build a kit or two from their fav show, but they might not be super into gunpla
though the part of the fanbase mainly into model kits seem pretty chill
as an outsider looking in
no, sounds about right
well that was the first western gundam thing (besides that fmv game)
or at least news soon at the event
well they are showing the 1st 2 episodes of the dub at Otakon tomorrow so I'm guessing soon
you mean the discotek dub?
but yeah, I'm not really a part of the gundam fanbase, I only talk about gundam here <:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
and I just like mil sci-fi (halo, titanfall, the trooper/pilot focused things in star wars) <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
like when everyone freaked out about symphogear trending when only gear fans were likely to see it <:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
let me know how long I have to save my money <:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
(just like the announcement of rightstuf putting out a western bd release of macross delta with no timeline of when after 2 panels at 2 cons)  <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
announcements without products is never intended to satisfy, only to build anticipation
well we still don't have dates for axz and xv <:KanadeWink:690470895608791040>
Well with his upload rate you haven't missed much lol
Yeah, while this server has been pointing out all the cute and potential gay in that show ,the gigguk video focused on the action which makes me more interested, so I'll probably get to it in the near future
the video is a bit under an hour long
35 minutes 45 seconds
also some info on the gunbuster dub (including some footage) starts at 35:45 since I know some here are interested in that
discotek put their most recent panel up on vimeo (for a limited time)
https://twitter.com/discotekmedia/status/1554209960593989632
tbh I enjoyed watching Gigguk well before I liked watching anime <:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
yeah, no clue what that is <:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
no clue what that show is, but that is some cool music <:MikuWhoa:670502684692054042>
oh so "crunchyroll sub" isn't totally accurate for gear on CR, TIL
yeah I haven't heard anything bad about the translators (and the only translations I've heard have big issues are symphogear XV and the earlier versions of the middle gear seasons), mainly just heard bad thing about how CR handles/treats them
I was more talking about the combo of they're rushed, but they don't get compensated much more for being rushed
so they have to spend more time in research, adding to the rush (and potential misunderstanding of intent)
also apparently crunchy doesn't work the the anime studios as much as others to give translators helpful info and input from the creators
also the whole rushing and underpaying their translators
that's not unreasonable
so that's why so much blurred thumbnail stuff was on sale during their birthday sale
~~now just waiting till they buy one of the big gunpla sites to complete the set~~
while I could see a clear argument for the funimation acquisition (reducing how many subs you need to watch things legally), them taking a big chunk of BOTH western anime streaming and anime selling market is kinda worrying
or is there another movie besides miller's report?
08th movie doesn't even end the plotlines, and cuts out most of the good stuff from early on too
I'd say 0080 or 08th MS team depending on your taste
<@404782531582623744>  though thinking about it, given G-Witch will apparently have a school rather than some war conflict main focus, 0080 War in Pocket OVA might be something worth watching before it if you want a taste of something gundam before hand
also apparently style and tone can shift a lot between universes and even shows in the case of UC given how long it stretches
though apparently most just watch the movie trilogy instead of the original show (spruced up and a few retcons, I just enjoyed watching the english dub of the show since I could do other things while watching and the toonami dub was well done)
and even in multi series universes, you can get away with some skipping around (I watched a few OVA's before watching through the original series for UC)
well given it's a separate universe you don't really need to watch anything else before hand (except the prologue you already watched)
speaking G Witch Prologue, the Lfrith model is looking good- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaJceaKxUfM
definitely looks like fun characters doing cool action
think I might look into watching Lycoris Recoil after it's done airing (and after I clear out a bit more of my old mecha backlog)
definitely looking forward to watch a gundam show as it airs for the first time though
Yeah, though given the show will have a school focus, while I think I'll like it, I probably won't like it as consistently as the prologue
Just finished Macross Zero. I liked it, good action and likable characters. Got weirder than I was expecting as it went on though. <:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>  (also the texture work on the cg models was done quite well, was surprised when I saw this ova was from the early 2000's)
but I've heard good things about everything except the 3rd movie
yeah heard that the anime is pretty much a decent police show with mechs, but most of the cool clips I've seen are from the second movie
but I'll have to wait since it's backordered, but for $40 instead of $70+ I'll wait, got other stuff to finish anyway
the anime, the ovas, and the 3 movies
https://www.rightstufanime.com/Patlabor-Special-Edition-Blu-ray I got this, so it's not "some of"
the collection with all the Patlabor stuff on blu-ray (was on sale for $40)
speaking of anime I haven't watched, last sunday I bought an anime I haven't watched that much of for the first time... (heard great things about it, seen cool clips, and was on a good sale)
now I'm just thinking of Giguk yelling "tournament arc!"
got another recommendation from it then?
yeah, even if I never watch this, I will loop this song a few times probably <:GenjuroThumbsUp:336657189475188740>
well also I only watched a few anime before this year as well so I'm not aware of much beyond what I've encountered this year and stuff big enough the jump past the anime bubble <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
I'm a sci-fi guy, so not really something I look into
think I might actually like its look more than the main Gundam Aerial
also I pre-ordered the HG Lfrith today
but yeah- 08th MS Team (mecha nam with a squad of likable characters and good and bad people on both sides narative) for those looking into the mil scifi stuff of gundam, 0080 War in Pocket (kid learns war isn't just fun and games when some zeon agents, which he befriends one of, sneak into his neutral colony) for more character and message focused stuff
watched millers report after getting my 08th bd and it was a real bland experience
the red jewel event has miku as mom and biki as dad <:HibikiKiss:738240567049191505> <:MikuKiss:738240587014340649>  (according to zababa)
wow the patlabor one has a lot of discs
my blu-rays from the rightstuf sale came in today <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
Also prob due to un numbered recap episodes
Think 86 had a 11 and a 12
cour is like 11-13 right?
True, still a 2021 movie for a 2016 show
I guess would also explain a sequel movie years later
Ah, was just thinking of the animation side of things
||losing your partner to old age when you are in your 30's||
||and even before she is strained to that the show calls attention to the fact that a hayate freyja relationship could be a bad choice since even if both healthy hayate would long outlive her||
||she's at her midway point in life but crystalizing like the old men||
||but it is a deviation from the boring comp movie which dulled all the stakes||
||well she was in bad shape at the end of the show||
But given Delta only had a show, a comp movie, and a sequel movie I don't think it's a "move on from delta" issue and more "make a macross show for the first time in yrars" issue
Well the sequel movie apparently has ||the main girl die so it is pretty obvious that movie is the end of delta||
I cried when the gal realized
It ends at a good place, so the anime won't leave you desparate to find out more
Yeah if you cut that last wandering the wasteland episode it could easily be passed of as being made to be standalone
Also I found where the anime ended a perfect stopping point
And the story ended well too
You'd think people would be vocally pissed
But yeah, idk why no videos from the time I've seen mention this mess
Good show, just skip the recaps
Glad I watched well after it aired and could just skip the recaps
Lucky it came out so great then
If your split cour has a main arc end in the middle (like 86) call them separate seasons, if not (like spyxfam) call it one season with a long break
I feel zababa benefitted some later seasons, not so much for maria herself though
Yeah, fine is a bit underdeveloped until xv gave her more context
Also some humor and/or drama is often thrown in
Yeah things that the audience would be asking are answered a bit after they would start asking (example my sister), and are in situations exposition makes sense
Also when watching it with my sister I often had her asking about things a bit before it would get exposition explained, so I feel the average audience wouldn't know most of it episodes ahead
You didn't specify what kind of plot and story <:TsubasaSmug:585839805737467920>
Except season 1 of gear
Like each part is about as long as a symphogear season

Better than crunchyroll at least, that labels all the dubs "s1" and the sub "s2" <:Ver:704169051391524875>
They are separate entries on list sites
But yeah, season 1 is the best part and works standalone
The ending of season 2 is really good though
Finished my rewatch of birdy the mighty: decode season 1, forgot how bitter sweet the ending was <:MikuCry:688397678584791074>
But yeah, I also need to finish off some of the old mecha I started but have been slow watching through and get to recoil
I'm currently rewatching one of their older works, birdy the mighty: decode, and it's pretty good too
never seen it but I often hear it brought up as anime cgi done well
*googles* oh that gem one
was a great show to watch in my tween/teen years and I still love it to this day
so glad the original run had new episodes up for 2 weeks starting a few days after airing CN on the star wars website so (after a lot of buffering) I could watch them despite my family not having CN
great action, good visual quality (that kept improving over time), turned clone cannon fodder from the movies into characters you cared about, interesting stories, and also general star wars cool stuff
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Xxk8LYX0SQ
clone wars
it's about the skin not the shape I guess <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
Also funny there is a sailor moon looking gundam <:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
Watched a video on it recently, looks fun
And dragonball was doing well
G was created because japan was getting burned out on UC
So from the looks of things 08th is more popular in the west than japan
Yeah, been meaning to read scans of it online myself
~~still waiting on the 3rd thunderbolt movie and most of the potential kits from the second~~
Guess they realized 50 eps was overwhelming but didn't want to fully give it up <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
Yeah, same with spyxfam, there is no resolution and and the last episode recaps so much it feels like the first ep of a second season
Exactly
still have yet to see a 3d cg tv show live up to clone wars in visuals, even the follow up, Rebels, didn't look near as good
The characters' skin can look a bit playdough (though clearly it was a style choice), but everything else looks great imo
the 86 part 2 ending just popped back up in my recommended <:HibiMikuCry:586026583870013455>||  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2jNjpdX2gA ||
this was during season 2 if I remember correctly, actually first found the show the year before when some kids a few grades below me were talking about how episodes were posted on the website (my first episode was bombad jedi <:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611> )
I remember my one friend in 5th grade (though he was in 6th but it was a small school so you often had 3 grades in one room) had CN and would watch the new episodes Friday night but we couldn't talk about it during lunch on Monday since it didn't go up on the star wars website for me to watch (with lots of buffering) till that day
so both late 00's and early 10's
08-14
those and clone wars
So far have read the first half, nice seeing something talking about good kinds of masculinity instead of purely complaints on toxic masculinity you see all over the internet. Talking about how you can be masculine by watching out for those you care about (along the lines of the typically masculine traits of being a protector and provider) without needing to act unfeeling or aggressive, which is often the toxic ways those traits are expressed. Good work, will finish later. <:GenjuroThumbsUp:336657189475188740>

saw a video on it recently (also the merch that was released)
CCA is what I'm thinking of yeah
I think merch of them even came out recently
isn't there a gundam show or movie with balloon dummies?
slapping the moping protag in mecha is a long time thing
https://tenor.com/view/mobile-suit-gundam-amuro-ray-bright-noa-gif-14847904
a currently airing kamen rider anime
https://myanimelist.net/anime/48649/Fuuto_Tantei?q=Fuuto%20PI&cat=anime
oh so this is where a lot of gear people went once gear was over?
looking at mal the only overlap I see is the animation director of the xv finale eps did storyboards, does this studio have any other gear overlap?

oh cool they have videos about finding it linked in the description
wow, that thing was found all this time later?
like unless there are multiple seasonals I want to watch right when they come out I don't really have a reason to use them instead of 9anime with an adblocker
yeah, makes sense, I used a 3 month trial then paid for a month weeks after the trial ended to finish up some spring seasonals, but I don't think it's worth staying subbed to either
huh, never had such issues in america, but that is their home turf
ok, seeya later <:HibikiHi:336657249827028993>
or could be isp's, they've been known to throttle streaming services
never had that issue on my very mid-tier connection, so maybe it's their eu servers that suck
have had no issues on pc... but on the switch app I often have subs desync from the footage
yeah, lots to complain about cr, but having to pay to watch new stuff shouldn't be one of the big things
I mean having to pay to watch new shows is pretty standard streaming service
Well decided to not wait till I finished up the old mecha I was watching and have now watched the first episode of recoil, very cute with some moments of cool <:MikuCute:672908542763859968> <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
liking reading something how it was in your head not how it is on the paper/screen
yeah, even with school papers, you had others check as you often skim past your own mistakes
that's the thing you feel the old ones were good since only the good ones (or the hilariously over the top ones) are still remembered/circulated
yeah because crap pay is better than no pay if you already are going to be putting a lot of time into tl's and subs
as with a lot of jobs in the entertainment industry, like game devs, they want to work on something they love and feel like if they leave a crap job in the industry they might never get back in (whether or not that's true)
and reduced competition for licenses
but while sonny is willing to pay big bucks to acquire everything, they don't want to spend big bucks after the thing is acquired <:MikuSigh:688429722799308883>
expected, but oof
weren't the funimation translators worried about things getting worse for them when crunchyrol aquired them?
though probably the worst thing about cr is they apparently pay less and rush more their translators than other anime streaming sites
while starting out an illegal streaming site <:Ver:704169051391524875>
yeah, most of the money comes from the service initially buying the license right? Not much comes after that
~~9anime~~
I only turned on embeds recently so I instinctively click twitter links still
it's verified
like gwitch doesn't even have an english language twitter, the west hasn't even gotten an official way to view prologue yet
given it's a japanese show and the hashtag is in japanese...
on the 17th episode one is being shown at some manga and anime festival, idk what's happening on the 4th though
well with this server, cute girls (with hints of yuri) doing action stuff kinda fits with the symphogear fanbase
well it's a pr time-skip prequel that's pretty self contained in it's story
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YGW2JRxWUU Witch from Mercury prologue is finally official available subbed
almost caught up on recoil now
avoid all that...well that's why you use more than one bomb  <:Ver:704169051391524875>
even if you evade the explosion, you'll still catch the shrapnel, and if you avoid the shrapnel there is still the concussive blast <:CoolNoiseDontLookAtExplosions:929758650157895711>
"dodge this!" <:ChrisBang:702166093065748500>
bullet dodging/blocking is cool and all until the shotguns, flamethrowers, gas, or explosives come out <:ChrisHehehe:688429717019426821>
though I guess also like star wars such a weapon won't show up in the show since it counters the cool super human protag too hard
Though I guess scattershot type weapons are just the go-to for dealing with superhuman dodgers/blockers, given the Star Wars lore of mando's using such weapons to get around jedi blocking shots with their sabers
so I'm slowly catching up on Lycoris Recoil, and in episode 3 it's mentioned the protag's bullet dodging is because she's very good at judging timings and predicting aim and also that being a more precise shooter makes it easier for her to dodge, so does just just make her weakness a simple sawed off with buckshot? Also at the start of ep 4 it's brought up getting close makes hitting her inaccurate rubber bullets easier and that's why she walks up dodging before shooting, which makes a sawed off seem like even more of an easy counter. <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
the anniversary of the favorite anime of meme-y ww2 youtubers and WoT / War Thunder players <:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
But it sounds cool <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Nah, that high pitched squeek doesn't really happen.
The youtube version at least does the hollywood high pitched style of silenced gunfire
Also I think I recall the silenced guns literally making no noise in the old uploads
I think they even improved the version on youtube from what they streamed in Japan earlier
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfa2HX_v6w0
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_American_XB-70_Valkyrie
watching some more zeta gundam... apparently the valkyrie bomber and the USAF were cannon to the gundam universe <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
well technically it's only been out a few days outside japan so you aren't that lazy <:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
that is the look of just pure happy contentment with life <:ChrisHappy:660870796696223744>
so far though zeta is looking to be my second favorite
so besides labeling 08th as my favorite and saying the 2nd thunderbolt has my favorite action scenes I can't really do much ranking
since I only started watching anime early this year I've only seen the original (Toonami dub), 08th, 0080, 0083, Cucuruz Doan's Island, gwitch prolouge, both Thunderbolt movies, and a quarter of Zeta
true, but unlike 0079, in 0080 it's about al and al is in most of it
mainly down to me finding Al annoying (which again, isn't a flaw, since it fits the kid he's supposed to be, just isn't something I enjoyed)
0080 was a show where I went "can't really find flaws, and it did what it set out to do well, but I just didn't super enjoy it"
what's your #1? currently mine is 08th
i'm only 14 episodes into zeta tbf
so yeah, guess my answer to favorite mecha mechanic is her- https://gundam.fandom.com/wiki/Mora_Boscht
but yeah, in most of the anime I've watched mechanics are either pure background and/or the pilots work on their own stuff
oh! and the big gal from 0083, one of the few good non-antagonist characters from that
trying to think of mechanic characters I've seen, Astonaige, the pink memeber of walkure, the mechanic crew also from delta, and the blonde guy from muv-luv alt te, and the jazz guy's friend from thunderbolt
but I just can't think of many mechanic characters from what I've watched so far
yeah, he has nothing really stand out
https://twitter.com/MON0EYE/status/1561511475239346176
the dude from zeta is simple but nice
ooo, cool looking mechanic character <:ElfneinWeld:586027421296492585>
Or just ignores long range combat outright
To be fair, pretty much every movie/show nerfs homing missiles in some way since bvr combat isn't that exciting
the system isn't just single letter
but those add a y, not replace a letter the means something with a y <:TsubasaYareYare:407397617451139073>
yeah, the yf-22 being the test f-22
also, vf stands for "variable fighter", what does yf mean?
why are some yf and some vf? like what are the distinguishing aspects
this is my 1/72 kit on a 1/100 action base in gerwalk mode, so a 1/100 of a macross plane wouldn't be too small, especially, as blockio said, in batroid mode
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1962_United_States_Tri-Service_aircraft_designation_system#Non-systematic_aircraft_designations

||Don't think it shoots long range for a shotgun, point blank only shotguns are pretty much just a video game thing. Though I found it really cool they used the 2 tube system the shotgun has, shooting the non-lethal rounds than changing tube and thus ammo to breach the door <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720> ||
think I watched like 2-9 over like 2 days
tbh I also had to binge catch up since I held off due to wanting to finish some other stuff I was watching first
nothing wrong with a good anime binge <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>

Just finished Recoil. Cute ending to a cute show. <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456> || kinda wanted to see the cover up fail though || Also now I can click a lot of the spoiler tags in here lol <:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
https://tenor.com/view/symphogear-gif-5661873
And some pretty cute art
Yup and it's good. And if I remember correctly you were looking forward to Max being in it? He is in most of the film.
Browsing yt and bed and saw there is now confirmation on g-witch streams
Ok, that was a great movie. Full of action and feels. <:MikuCry:688397678584791074>
Past Macross is being a bit more heavily referenced than the name drops of the show and first movie. Max obviously is here, but also the AI from Plus is being brought up (still need to watch that)
the villain in this does seem to have a more interesting stated motive than the "revenge and ruling the galaxy" of the original show's villain. ||(fleet comander who thinks many of the lives of those under him could have been spared through use of banned ai and organ cloning tech, also lost many when he was denied using reaction bombs to stop an overwhelming force. Then on top of that he hates how the head of Xaos supports these bans while getting away with using such tech for her own gain)||
But ignoring my preferences for the show's progression and ending point over the retcon movie, so far really enjoying the first third of this sequel movie (which I couldn't say for like the first 2 thirds of the retcon movie)
also like the first movie they have a cgi dance number, but it is less visually jarring than the one in the first movie
this movie is starting at a weaker point since it's continuing from the first movie not the show. Also even though this is set after the events of the show/movie due to what the first movie left out there is some plot point retreads (and with those some new minor retcons) from the show ||so far mainly around Freyja and Hayate's relationship and the backstory of Hayate's father||
yup, leave it this guy to weave his macross between mountains
quite the menacing antagonist macross class
~~wow, quality anime piracy is fast~~ <:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
oh nvm, it's on 9anime already
it's just a straight mkv rip so it's like 30 gigs...well with this grandparent internet looks like my latop will be left on overnight lol
Oh cool! a rip of the Macross Delta Zetai Live movie was put up for torrenting earlier today
Yeah, even in western live action it's not that rare
Same scene as the basa butt shot
Yeah, nudity and being suggestive aren't always one in the same
Yeah, barbie doll level nudity in every s1 op
Yeah
Ah, Frontier and Plus are the 2 next Macross I plan to watch
Which ones are those other 2 from?
Max probably has the most lines/screentime of those not part of Walkure or Delta flight
Nope, they are on his Macross for most of the film
II is like far future/au isn't it?
given the references in zetai live and it being shorter that was already the plan
Yeah Max and Milia is the one thing that might get me to watch it, but definitely putting frontier, plus, and some gundam stuff ahead of it in line <:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
yeah, 7 is the one that looks a bit *too* goofy for my tastes <:GenjuroLaugh:689563633516150872>
in your sci-fi show that has had no reference to religion at all before or after in the run
also in singing silent night in it's entirety in japanese, with none of the christian aspects removed
then have your kid sit in your lap when piloting
like the progression of beat you at flying, beat you at the arcade, beat you in a knife fight, married
fair
make sense? yes. still goofy though
I love delta, but anything involving hacking in that was so goofy
that was one scene when they needed to fundraise and also hack into people's devices for intel on occupied worlds
movie 1/show spoiler so yes
watch it <:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
yeah ||messer's death onward I actually wasn't actively bored/annoyed with the first movie||
||in the ship hallway <:MikuCry:688397678584791074> ||
same, ||though I cried more in the middle than the actual death||
even the end of the show pushes that hard
||but it was one the end of the show and this movie's trailer had me expecting already||
though I got a death spoiled by wiki info box <:HibikiTired:422925410490253313>
saw someone post the pineapple on twitter and was confused
oh, didn't catch that, but now that you mention it
||Max beating Hayate by also dancing was pretty cool||
also the ai mentions remind me I need to watch Plus
yeah, glad I had seen the original series before the sequel just so I could appreciate max more
I said "a little"
glad the post credits was there to ease the sadness a little
and if it really hooks you and you want more freyja + hayate and good action watch like the last third of the comp movie (first 2 thirds are pretty boring and pointless if you have seen the show) so you know where the sequel is starting from then watch the sequel
but yeah, for now I would just recommend watching the original 26 episode show, it's a cute time with some action and tears along the way
yeah the comp movie is a bit odd, the main plot is the exact same but a lot of character stuff is jumped over
yeah, like you could get away with not, but some minor characters will be alive not dead and some relationships haven't progressed as far
(also the sequel movie is a bit weird since it continues from the meh compilation retcon movie, not the show)
the sequel movie is a bit more heavy on past connections, but can still be enjoyed without seeing past stuff
delta was my first macross, most of the past references are like "my grandparents were aces from (war in the oringal series)" or Freyja lists off the human music that inspired her and it's all the musicians form past shows.
the show can be watched with no knowledge of the past stuff, and any basic universe info is often explained
I cried last night at the new Macross Delta movie <:MikuCry:688397678584791074>
though fortunately the motion smoothing didn't seem to go that agro on the character animations
I was recently reminded it's not just ai bros who push for stupid smoothed out animation, casting macross delta from my phone to the tv to watch with my mom, and the amount of motion smoothing from the tv you can see on camera movements and cgi visuals <:KirikaDisgust:688431636043268097>
Wasn't thunderbolt already like web episodes before it became movies? ~~also where's more thunderbolt kits and the next movie~~
oh hey, looking on wikipedia 40 years from the first episode is next monday
given we're in the 40th anniversary, explains why zetai live is much more reference heavy than base delta
Guess maybe to get more people to leave to CR faster <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
At least once the issue is resolved you can watch the rest on youtube since you're in asia
Kinda showing the bionicle formula wasn't a fluke
Yeah, managed to adapt what made bionicle successful but in a more standard theme aimed at a slightly younger demographic
tbh I mainly noticed the cg with the ariel, mainly how they handled the glossy bit on the chest
at a mech school
yeah it's the default training mech
"why is you name showing?" "I might have helped <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>  "
yeah, I could quickly tell when cg mechs were used, but they visually blended in quite well (the main issue imo with cg in anime is how often the lighting sticks out) and they were used when it made sense (rotating slowly, etc.)
Just watched G-Witch episode 1. ||Awkward gays and special tomatoes, Maria would love this show. <:MariaChuckle:672465496515411984> || Action is good, characters are decent so far, and as is usual with gundam shows my favorite character so for is a mechanic supporting character.
https://twitter.com/megi_sin/status/1576417390681763840
Looking forward to the results of that <:HibikiFingerguns:688429715836502063>
speaking of you watching mecha, have you gotten around to the new Delta movie yet?
"arranged gay marriage" vs "probably gay friends"
tbh liked it more than most of the original series it's spun off from
good movie
I just watched a rip day after release since japan sold blu-rays at the theaters
oh yeah, forgot some places in the west are getting that in theaters
Well, been a good past week for mecha. Macross Delta closes out with a great movie and G-Witch starts. <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
https://twitter.com/adriftingtender/status/1576630283066974211
yeah that was the most obvious cg bit in the episode imo
matte stuff sticks out less in cg in anime
yeah, she's a good pilot and is willing to stand up for things, she just sucks at communicating
also this reply is my thought exactly- https://twitter.com/OrehCursor/status/1576712730421051392
looked at the replies, good choice of post-hit plug <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456> https://twitter.com/SpookSpark/status/1576662685932036100
yeah pretty sure the plan that was announced was cour 1, thunderbolt and some other movies made tv versions of for japanese broadcast in the middle, then 2nd cour
some of the spinoff ova's (like 08th ms team and 0083 stardust memory) have as many episodes as a modern seasonal
a lot of shows had 50+ episode runs during the days gundam initially took off
kinda is the standard for gundam shows
the actions aren't super yuri, but twitter is freaking out because it's directly stated and not just *heavily* implied like most shows labeled yuri
yeah, the term "my groom" is given to a gal by another gal
no yuri lovey dovey stuff (at least yet)
I mean technically
https://twitter.com/HobbySite/status/1576744002124386305 very cool grunt suit

you and a lot of twitter <:GenjuroLaugh:689563633516150872>
oh we aren't talking just anime
thunderbolt
well the OYW war side stories are better than his work anyway <:ChrisHehehe:688429717019426821>
0083 may have had annoying characters, but the soundtrack is my fav in gundam so far- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eP0U3irjIow
yeah, 0080 has nothing that really directly connects to 0079 beyond "fed and zeon are fighting" "zeon lost"
tbh starting with 0080 puts you more in the shoes of the protag <:HibikiFingerguns:688429715836502063>
I feel 08th and 0080 are also good starts
after I finish zeta probably my next gundam is going to be an au, when I come back to UC I might skip ZZ since I probably don't want to commit to another old 50 episode UC show
though I've heard you can jump straight from 0079 movies to CCA, since that's what a lot of the Japanese population did at the time (watched the 0079 movies and didn't keep up with the shows, but showwed up to watch CCA)
though watching Zeta atm, I think that would be a bad starting point due to the referencing of amuro and char's past and newtype stuff just being a thing
while I feel most would be better off geting into UC via the OYW OVA's, I don't see 0079 as a bad starting point
yup
yeah 0079 isn't a bad starting point, just a meh hook
also the earth gov exploiting colonies is pretty standard in sci-fi, with often the earth gov shown as the bad guys for it (titanfall, and even halo to an extent)
tbf 0079 kicked off the "good and bad people on both sides (even for higher ups)" focus
feeling like approaching pre-dinsey clone wars era of overlapping and contradicting events
I will say, the amount of stories shoved into a "one year war" is getting a bit much
yeah colony gassing is actually shown in like 08th and 0083 mayfly of space in flashbacks, not 0079
08th is still my fav gundam and 0080 tells it's message better
now the spying stuff ramping up with wide support was definitely a big fast change
I mean there was desert storm before that, and some actions south of us. So the invading things part wasn't new.
like churchill going from super liked to out of office
yeah like zeon, germany had a reason to be upset at the powers that be (treaty of versai and the actual terms not being the suggested points), but then they followed a very evil group and became clearly the bad guys in their actions
though ignoring side stories, 0079 does show the higher up feds as quite the unlikable bunch, and zeon as having a good reason to break off, just the zabi family corrupted it from independence to domination
https://tenor.com/view/the-road-to-el-dorado-both-both-is-good-gif-8304204
both are good though
gives context but is a very different setting and tone from episode 1
oh the annoying womanizer, best past (outside of action) in 0083 was the mechanic gal hitting him for messing with those under her
yeah
tom cruise with no spine or charisma
so far I've found kamile one of the less annoying gundam protags (one of the worst being from your favorite, 0083)
they were forced to stay on for reasons of maintaining the confidentiality of gundam and white base for a while
yeah
mirage moves from battle buddies to love triangle briefly (it's macross, some kind of love triangle is required) but that doesn't last long and they go back to battle buddies
was worried for a sec you were watching the comp movie since they kinda start as battle buddies in that <:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
cool
how many episodes in are you?
like "if you are going to label both AD we're going to run with it"
may have put the idea in, but I think they were half joking with that
long time top singer... with like 2-3 songs
thanks for reminding me how SDF killed its songs with repetition <:TsubasaYareYare:407397617451139073>
Like at least with SDF they can argue "we licensed the western release of that and put out our edit of it, Robotech. Which we still sell stuff based on". But then they spent decades getting in the way of stuff they had nothing to do with. <:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
at least the rest of the franchise got away from their grip last year and western releases are starting to trickle out <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
or you could say it's an in-between of modern mario and unreal engine fan-made mario
that head looks like a theme park mascot costume or animatronic <:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
like in thunderbolt they have "gundam head gm's" so even in UC gundam being down to look is being bucked a bit
collection 2 is on normal retailers for normal prices while collection 1 is just from resellers for like $100+
I'm just sad the only blu-rays kept in stock are just the second half one (the worse half)
fan service episodes followed by a finale with the world's most idiotic antagonists <:Ver:704169051391524875>
total eclipse anime is good..till like the the last third
https://twitter.com/t_features/status/1577999642012196864
I'm wondering if the show will at a point go beyond the school duels and become more like prologue 🤔
best g-witch kit 🍅
https://twitter.com/shin0bu46/status/1577974974123372545
I'll still drop the yt link for any others who haven't watched- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YGW2JRxWUU
if so, enjoy prologue <:HibikiFingerguns:688429715836502063>
you mean you're downloading?
so no need to download
also prolouge is free on youtube world wide I'm pretty sure
might give you some slight increased context on the protag, gund arm/gundams and some of the corpos, but yeah it's just good
she's a cute mechanic, not an asshole soul sucker <:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
<:MikuCute:672908542763859968>
~~at least they didn't pick the red head this time~~ <:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
yup
and no longer has shaggy hair, and they chose for their token black to be the stoner <:TsubasaYareYare:407397617451139073>
though I get not calling him shaggy, given they gave him such short and non-shaggy hair for this for some reason
also https://twitter.com/BuggieSmuggie/status/1578148363618619392
also with fred, one comment on that tweet made me realize, fred doesn't look like he's form the same show as the others, the eyes and shading...
yeah... going by his first name is the one thing people are upset about <:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
tbh I like how this looks way more than the normal units
yeah, lol trying to claim there is an explanation to the series where the christian symbolism was just "I thought it  looked cool" in the end
<:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
it's japan so probably Qoo
yeah definitely is something that will hook you on the characters rather than the plot if it hooks you, the plot of delta is just kinda there to move the characters along
but hey, one of those 2 shows is in my top 10 still
but also tbh I haven't watched much anime given I watched only 2 shows, 1 movie, and one short ova in total before this year
sci-fi female heroines, intense mech fights, and/or crying are my weaknesses <:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
Oh, tbh I forgot there was a slideshow bit
||the hotel bit?||
Tbh I forgot I recommended it to you <:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
Of those have only seen pancreas
oh yeah, the large scale fundraiser/hacking
the red haired one?
fair
I haven't watched Frontier, but that usually is most macross fans' favorite (both delta likers and haters) so not surprised you enjoy that more
and I thought normal eva sounded weird....
ball hair
~~just look at all the art in sfw from the show~~
still waiting on my lfrith preorder to ship out <:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>

Companies in 2022 still treating the global internet like broadcast <:TsubasaYareYare:407397617451139073>
Ok, that just makes bandai region locking youtube even more stupid <:HibikiThink:688429715362414641>
context- https://twitter.com/alma314_/status/1579058451065733120
https://twitter.com/MON0EYE/status/1579273545644789760
(though a "meh" symphogear season is still better than actual "meh" shows)
along those lines, while AXZ was the most "meh" Symphogear season for me, it has a stellar op- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywa_uDjChOQ
OP's are often some of the highlights of an anime, even meh shows often have decent OP's <:GenjuroLaugh:689563633516150872>
the video I posted is a fan upload of the OP
no, I'm talking the OP, aka the opening, aka visuals+music used at the opening of a show
it's a separate thing
that's not the op, that's the music video for the op's song
also apparently there are official uploads of the op and ed...but bandai region locked them
and it's nice to see the mechanic gal is getting decent focus for a side character <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahIBDYCx-0g
also the op is nice
Just watched G-Witch episode 2, actually found it more interesting than episode 1 <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
and decided to keep having performance scenes
and overused <:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
though mediclorians does raise the question "if you suspect the dark lord who is strong with the force is part of the senate, why not blood test the senate?"
tbh I was bugged far more in the prequels by how dumb the council was than by mediclorians or other lore dumps
I found them boring in the original trilogy, though I liked Luke as a character
also clones best part of clone wars
pilots > jedi
well I guess it also didn't bother me too much since the force is the least interesting part of Star Wars for me anyways
tbh when I watched the prequels midichlorians didn't even shock me due to the original trilogy establishing being strong in the force can be inherited, so I already assumed something along those lines
ah <:HibikiWhoops:585839808115507222>
oh from each other
oh you mean from SDF not Delta
wow, from the looks of it I was not expecting 7 to go for realism
well I started with Delta (due to expecting something like Gear) so I wasn't in the "play nice with science" mindset
I mean it is kinda Gear level sci-fi with less random history name drops <:Ver:704169051391524875>
not an issue for me, but that is definitely a change
stupid Sony
oh yeah, that is definitely a possibility <:MikuSigh:688429722799308883>
I mean at least official english subs already exist so at least crunchy shouldn't mess that up
besides just "our publishing arm is putting out delta in the west on blu-ray"
this slide is the only info I've been able to find
then silence
they announced it months ago
speaking of dates, we still have no more info from rightstuf on the macross delta western BD <:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
maybe we'll actually get a date and sub examples for XV
No! Please Stop! <:KirikaPanic:644235681677180958>
though I guess the better singing let it earworm better
ok, listening to this, at least "my boyfriend is a pilot" is sung better <:TsubasaYareYare:407397617451139073>
I have "my boyfriend is a pilot" pop in my head whenever SDF is brought up <:KirikaPanic:644235681677180958>
eh, repeated animation doesn't stick in your head like an annoying earworm
The community even has a term for the middle bit "the dark ages"<:Ver:704169051391524875>
Hey, the story of most AFOL's (adult fans of lego)
hey, it's like the 2020's version of the government using a zombie apocalypse to teach people about disaster prep <:Ver:704169051391524875>
from young business men bring VHS tapes home with them to world domination, what a long term plan <:MikuWhoa:670502684692054042>
never underestimate young adult social media interns <:Ver:704169051391524875>
(it has english subs)
probably going to put the movie on for a rewatch tonight <:MikuCry:688397678584791074>
can't read the booklet, but the middle has quite a few pages of character/mech design art
first imported BD <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
oh yeah, doing XV's ending 3 years before XV (but more weird)
https://myanimelist.net/anime/33806/Macross_%CE%94__Delta_Shougekijou
well they also have an even lower budget version of shinais <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
glad you had a fun time, even if it was a bit messy <:GenjuroThumbsUp:336657189475188740>
poor mirage, just wants to be a good pilot
(at least that's what I've heard)
"not my fault the creator of delta wanted just Freyja Hayate but was required to throw in a love triangle because it's Macross"
glad you clarified <:GenjuroThumbsUp:336657189475188740>
but you weren't tagging/replying so it seemed out of nowhere
never have seen them, and I understood zettai fine, they do reference past stuff (the ai from plus for example) but I feel the only real context is delta and the original (since Max from the original and 7 has a lot of screen time in Zettai)
also apparently the macross comp movie is cannon...as a in-universe movie adaption of the "real" events
apparently the original macross has a decent comp movie, but that's another show of the same era that also had some messy production values for the broadcast
sad 2 of my favorite mechas have boring comp movies that remove the best parts in favor of filler (delta and 08th)
yeah, I only watched it for sequel movie context, it bored me until like the last third, than had a decent finale (I gave delta a 9/10, I gave the comp movie a 6/10)
||things only really get on track at the scene the reaper dies||
the comp movie for like the first 2/3 guts character progression for boring fluff
||yeah, hayate sadly doesn't really have an arc in the comp movie, he doesn't grow to like freyja from annoyance, his dad was never suspected of nuking his gf's home, and he was new pilot from the very start, not recruited reluctantly etc.||
||freedom from the UN was the point of the war, both in show and movie||
||also you might have noticed the pilot knight that died who loved his son is alive||
the dad stuff isn't in the comp movie
it's a sequel to a retcon movie
not worth the money
still "video unavailable" here in the states
nope https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aU8ruUe7UlE
and the ed- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDLij4k0lgw
nice since the fan upload was taken down days ago
crunchy finally uploaded a non region locked version of the g-witch op- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqZ9tCxq9Yw
plain old thriller would be things like mission impossible, winter soldier, etc.
hmm, I do like thrillers, sigh, another gundam to add to the backlouge
I look forward to tomorrow <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
speaking of cg "just because walkure concerts have been done with cg doesn't mean your movies each need a cg dance number"
also in that scene ||accidentally flexing having a caring parent on him||
||she has to look at her fingers to keep track <:HibikiWhoops:585839808115507222> ||
Also, love cute nerds interacting <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
Watched G-witch episode 3. So many great character interactions, as well as a fun duel.
as long as comments keep praising the "title guy" they'll keep doing silly titles <:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
I mean at least it appears to just be some bigger sections, not a bunch of small pieces or anything
I mean, given the bigger pricier 1/72 kits have issues with the parts not staying flush in plane mode and can be a bit of a headache to transform, I don't blame them for using some part swapping for the batroid torso and plane cockpit in the smaller and cheaper high-grade

It is a parts-former unlike the 1/72 kits, but it looks good and isn't as big or pricey
oh and speaking of Plus, <@272127150579122178> since you've mentioned wanting Macross kits but not as big as the 1/72 kits, the first 1/100 Macross High Grade is coming next year, a YF-19 kit from Plus- https://www.hlj.com/1-100-scale-hg-yf-19-macross-bans64258
Also the ai/drone stuff was neat. Both as added context for the Delta sequel movie, and as drones and computer generated art/artists have become more common with time.
The test pilots with drama reminded me of a movie I liked growing up, The Right Stuff.
Decided on a whim to get around to watching Macross Plus tonight, was good. <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
Like after russia it's a mess
Only 2 eps of TE being good is a bit harsh, I recommended dropping it half way through the season instead <:Ver:704169051391524875>
Cool name not of the creator's language that sounds basic and silly when translated
This is sounding like swapped language "die katana" <:GenjuroLaugh:689563633516150872>
But at the end of it all the ending of 86 is nice
looks like we're going to see pink haired girl's custom mech next ep- https://twitter.com/G_Witch_M/status/1584077163099217921
definitely a cool idea they did of giving each faction/company a different mechanical designer with a different style
hope we do get to see the Zowort used in actual ms vs ms combat later though
the gm quell is cool despite being made to "quell" riots and uprisings (even has ankle cams to see the people it's fighting/stomping) <:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
the base zowort is at least set up for that to work, but who knows, might just be for mold reuse for a heavy kit
oh and just noticed the holes on the shoulders for the added armor
though looking at the regular zowort, the heavie's gun is just one piece added on https://twitter.com/HobbySite/status/1576744002124386305
one thing I wonder with the Zowort Heavy is if it will end up being a p-bandai thing, or will their be an add-on parts kit like with the demi trainer weapons
looked through their twitter, they apparently also did designs for zettai live
final episode (12) time skips to the young guy from 08th and the red-head village girl looking for Shiro, and mostly focuses on interactions they have with a bunch of former zeon test subject kids living alone
barely has anything to do with the rest of the show
Lol they don't include episode 12 <:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLJV1h9xQ7Hx_NWf-b29CR8o3HpUN_zKOx 08th ms team is on the gundaminfo youtube now <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
the designer did work on an armored core game- https://www.mobygames.com/developer/sheet/view/developerId,400028/
"Wataru Inata" according to the wiki
well since they seem to have a different designer for each company, prob the same as the other Peil Tech MS- https://gundam.fandom.com/wiki/Gundam_Pharact
https://twitter.com/G_Witch_M/status/1584105597116424192
||my comment that got you talking was just about the rejection, I hadn't even reached the JK scene when I posted that||
||ok, Guel's jk a few scenes later is something that we need to see how that goes through, but the rejection on the field I felt wasn't an unexpected outcome at all||
||Unless they decided to build her a harem, it was the expected outcome tbh, just maybe not this sudden. Would be kinda odd if this out of the blue proposal was taken as a serious cliff-hanger||
just started the new g-witch episode ||best rejection ever, run into mech and fly away|| <:GenjuroLaugh:689563633516150872>
https://twitter.com/discotekmedia/status/1584712333275721729
wonder if we will actually see sub examples for xv
episode one also got posted for free on crunchyroll's youtube channel a few days ago

little figures to display with kits is nice, loved how the HG 86 Juggernaut kits came with a little Lena figure
wrinkley plastic wrap makes it look worse as decor though <:KanadeWink:690470895608791040>
but yeah, before that my family only had wii
lol, I bought a used xbox one s late 2020 to have a bd player when I started living alone (also to play game pass games)
or 2 gens ago if a ps3
not even a console from last or current gen?
buying physical media and then leaving them sealed, smh
prob not for a bit, the translator hadn't even done any real work on it by the time it was initially announced (why not even the op they showed had subs, and why the translator didn't post her standard sub examples like with past gear announcements)
yeah, they mentioned the connection it had to gunbuster on the stream to transition between that and the gunbuster bd <:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
https://youtu.be/bfyKZt1gIhY
though it is just what I've heard, I haven't watched it
from what I've heard a season 2 continuation would defeat the point
looking forward to the 2nd beefy blue mobile suit with a shield minigun (also I am currently building the HG Gouf custom from 08th)
makes me wonder if it will see combat outside of school, or if that will just be used for a duel or some marksman course
that has been in the promo images for that model since before the show even started
New? She had that last ep.
what makes gundam's "special" varies from show to show, but they are always the rare powerful protag machines
yeah that's the general idea
but yeah, gundams tend to have some certain iconic design tropes to them plus some in-universe explanation of special or rare tech
in UC "gundams" are eperimental more full featured (but expensive) suits while in G-Witch they now have that remote control "Gund-arm" tech as their defining aspect
mobile suits are the default names for the mechs in all shows, gundams have only been the "special ones"
looked up "gundam patrick" and I now understand this meme I came across <:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611> ||https://twitter.com/AllianceMecha/status/1586704442191380480||
||yeah, a rest and/or a win against someone not a random student is what's needed||
||as I said, he's becoming a punching bag||
||Yeah he definitely has improved and lessened his overconfidence each duel, but at this point it's killing the tension of any duel he's in as he just loses by default at this point.||
Guel meme- ||https://twitter.com/joanna890508/status/1586706468396732418||
Just watched the new G-Witch episode. ||Nice to see more info and developments on the gund-arm side of things. Also cool seeing prologue stuff starting to overlap more. And the duels were cool, though speaking of, even though I don't like Guel the show really needs to give him a win soon, he's feeling like a punching bag at this point.||
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BM9-nDt4lI0
or early on, new star wars series (mando seasons 1+2 and clone wars final season did wonders for them I feel)
apparently the reasoning (besides the obvious of getting people to pay more for the disney+,hulu,espn bundle) is kids and whole family content goes on d+ and things that don't fit that go on hulu
hulu and disney+ both being owned by dinesy but separating content will always be stupid <:TsubasaYareYare:407397617451139073>
looks it up ~~crap another franchise that's pretty much PS only~~
nah, just heated old nerd discussion
mecha nerds arguing gundam definition, the usual
(aside from piracy) full series on youtube for some of asia/oceania , Crunchy has the license for pretty much everywhere else, 1st ep is free on their youtube channel though (and prolouge has been non-region locked on gundam info's yt for a while)
product page said "Coming in Sep 2022" when I ordered early August, now it says "Coming in Oct 2022" and it still hasn't shipped <:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
speaking of no v-fin gundams, still waiting on my hg lfrith pre-order <:ChrisBored:672575526346424351>
well to be fair with your question, throughout g-witch there's been big plot points on whether something was a gundam or not and gundams being banned, so you thinking they were all gundams was kinda silly <:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
See what you did <@171395487247630336> ? You got the mecha nerds arguing again. <:GenjuroLaugh:689563633516150872>
for a sec I thought the embed was just grabbing a review
that description from gundam planet <:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
~~but they said Aerial wasn't a gundam~~ <:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
she was potentially willing to fight Guel then and there <:Ver:704169051391524875>
it's her battle stance <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
oof
yeah along the lines of "one of original creators doesn't like the new stuff so new stuff is just bad", can see that happening
yeah
well if he did say "for him", that's not gatekeeping, just personal preference
want a hg ground gm type c and aqua cannon <:HibikiSad:738234648509022368>
also even the thunderbolt movies that do exist are very lacking in kits
not only is the manga ongoing, but the 2nd movie leaves things pretty unresolved more "we survived and now here's the truth about who's behind this"
and 3rd thunderbolt movie when?
Blockio is German if I remember right
different time zone but similar sleep schedule here <:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
fair
yeah, save the "told you so" till if/when the issues catch up with the product
like if the show starts taking visual downgrades learning of the production issues will be something the audience will want to know, but till then the product is still fine and also there's nothing we can do as the audience to fix the problems
yeah, only those who worked on the thing and their families or those researching the production read credits
production issues could lead to visible issues for the general audience, but if that does happen, it hasn't happened yet
oh hey, a translation of this
https://twitter.com/icedoll456/status/1588226254540447744
https://tenor.com/view/arc-troopers-galactic-republic-gif-20467766
They are when animated at least
Still is a cartoon, cartoon does not equal a full show inherently
Standalone straight to vhs/dvd
Actually I did see one batman cartoon growing up, scooby doo meets batman and robin <:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
(my childhood batman media was the 60's movie on dvd)
Never grew up watching a batman cartoon but have seen clips with him so many times online
One of the 3 most iconic batman voices and one of the 2 most beloved
BD's hold 25 gigs per layer, up to 4 layers
given western releases of shows have no issue putting 13 episodes on a single disk I doubt that is the case
just wish they would hurry up on getting a timeline out <:ChrisBored:672575526346424351>
but yeah, american me will wait since even a western collector's edition will prob be cheaper than the japanese method of putting a season across a billion disks
still no emails out of this <:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
well then go ahead, they have english subs, just menu navigation can be a bit weird
another company also putting out the macross pluss movie on bd
rightstuf's publishing arm is doing it
not yet, announced at cons this past summer
I'm holding off until the announced western release to get the show's bd's, I did buy the sequel movie's bd though, japanese macross bd's do have english subs
eh boring movie 1 (the compilation movie) is kinda needed for sequel movie (great) so as long as you watch the show first nothing wrong with that
https://tenor.com/view/macross-delta-thumbs-up-mecha-vf31-gif-20164342
asshole incarnate
and has anti-war takes like this- https://twitter.com/ExtremeSManpig/status/1591271832417607680
worst part imo was them writing the other characters considering an incest pair as a serious and ok option in the love triangle rivalry
and even if it was a real person, this reads more of a list of wrongs than any harsh insult lol.
looks like twitter doesn't like people insulting the worst macross character <:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
my super hero stuff when growing up was things we had on dvd (we never had cable or satellite). So 60's batman movie, 90's fantastic 4 tv show my dad got as a gift at some christmas party, and bibleman
so the only aniplex disk I have is a funimation save edition dvd of birdy the mighty decode I got used
yeah shame two of my favorite recent anime are under their control (86 and Vivy)
oh yeah, "A" companies that are involved with A1 stuff, got it mixed up <:HibikiWhoops:585839808115507222>
oh really? since I always thought that was the worst one
still need to watch more than a few episodes on both of these though <:HibikiWhoops:585839808115507222>
yeah, was the end of the rightstuf bday sale, got that, symphogear G and this for under 90 usd- https://www.rightstufanime.com/Armored-Trooper-VOTOMS-Ultimate-Collection-Blu-ray
and it's literally everything from the franchise
back to collections, the most disks I have in a collection is thing thing I got for like $35 on sale- https://www.rightstufanime.com/Patlabor-Special-Edition-Blu-ray
though atm my only bd player is a used xbox one s from ebay
if I end up getting a bd drive I'm making backups with makemkv rather that just paying a license to play them
yeah either way you have to pay for importing and have to have a non local bd player
and more layers means more capacity but more cost
as I said earlier, like dvds they have a per layer capacity with a max ammount of layers, for bd's that's 25 gigs per at 4 layers for the max
added dubs and commentary tracks can take up more space if a dub is included, though that makes japanese releases using more disks more odd
nah, just 13+1 episodes, trailers, op/ed, and a booklet for $165 msrp (but sold at $130)
Still have never seen any evidence or sacrificed quality on western releases. You keep saying that but I can find nothing on it.
4-disk seasons of clone wars on dvd every christmas was my thing. (though the on disk bts mini-docs were cut down from the web versions as they were 1 per disk not 1 per episode)
I would just rather pick and choose music and display pieces
though A1 tries to pull the japanese pricing in the west with their releases. (never getting a vivy bd <:MikuSigh:688429722799308883> )
but yeah, imo I find the japanese bd release method a bit too price gougey for my tatses. Pricey disks with a few episodes or an equally pricey full season justified with some bonus stuff. I just want the show physically in HD for a reasonable price, any bonuses like music I can get separately as I see fit or find online.
or was that about the western gear releases?
not worth hundreds for a full season though
tbh more compressed bonus stuff matters less than the show itself
not disk capacity, player memory
only recall them talking about subtitle techniques pushing the limits of baseline blu-ray player memory with GX
never heard of that or seen any examples
unless your using uhd BD's which I don't think anime often comes on
BD is all 1080p, western or Japanese
yeah, volumes of 2-3 episodes pluss some bonuses for like 40 bucks each seems the standard for japan
Vivy would prob be a more solid 10 if the ending was more interesting
my currents 10's (not meaning perfection for me, more best in class of what I've seen) Is Gear season 1, 86 cour 1, I Want to Eat Your Pancreas, and depending on my mood Vivy bounces between a 9 and 10.
speaking of armaments, I recently realized Reginleif kits exist and now I want the rocket pod one someday https://www.gundamplanet.com/hg-1-48-reginleif-kurena-anju-use.html
yeah for me cour 1 is one of my few 10/10s while the finale of cour 2 took that from like a high 7 or an 8 to a 9
and while not the end of the story, the cour 2 finale is prob the best stopping point you could get for a still ongoing LN series
for me 86's fainle elevated cour 2 a whole lot but I would have really loved the show anyway for cour 1 without it
the price of smiles finale deflated my opinion on the show, didn't make me hate it, just went from "this is a pretty neat show" to "well that was kind of a waste of all the set up"
can't say so for a series, but could for a season
oh yeah, that is one bonus goodie that is often worth it
you can do a bit with vlc too, like tweaking the x264 settings
I did once have some visual glitches on vlc after pausing or jumping around, but that was fixed just by turning off hardware-accelerated decoding (guess cpu handles this stuff better than gpu)
if vlc doesn't play a video file likely nothing will
vlc is pretty much the media player standard
I use VLC on pc, and on my phone I don't watch downloaded video much but when I do I either use the player built into the file system or VLC
I would prob throw some clone wars arcs into my general media 10/10's (not seasons, but it's mostly an episodic show so a season doesn't really have anything super overarching)
and they sit among shows with better action (and/or fewer minor annoyances) but less emotional impact that are also 9's on my scale (08th ms team and armor hunter mellowlink)
that being the criteria I would prob also add the other gear seasons (except axz), macross delta, and birdy the mighty: decode season 1 in there to my existing 10's, but given emotional impact is a big factor for me but not the only one those are currently 9's
that zaku is about to be punished for his ball crimes
yes
I told her "spy family" is correct "spy ecks family" is common and "spy cross family" is weird <:Ver:704169051391524875>
yup lol
also the entire dub was officially on youtube for a while I think
https://tenor.com/view/witchblade-cael-anime-gif-14997922
Mine was Witchblade because horny teenage me browsed comic wiki's instead of porn sites <:GenjuroLaugh:689563633516150872>
think before I showed my sister gear this spring she had been shown Jujutsu Kaisen and a Fantasy anime as her first full animes
also apparently she was recently introduced to hunter x hunter as well and knew how to say it right despite admitting to saying "ecks" most of the time <:GenjuroLaugh:689563633516150872>
Just had a phone call with my sister and very early into the call she brings up she's watching season 1 of spy x family with a college friend and the 2 things she says is it's cute and asking me for clarification on how the title is said <:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
except maybe when text is on screen
though at least for animation dvd rips with no extra compression don't look too bad
when I heard "upscaler" my mind initially went to like ai upscalers, why I mentioned dvd rips lol
like the window size I use is often somewhere between 720 and 1080 on my 1440p monitor
my monitor is 1440p but I don't full screen anything besides games, don't like details not being in my center focus
might look into that for playing dvd rips then
do you mean nyaa?
on zeta gundam episode 29...was not expecting to see a penis... <:KirikaDisgust:688431636043268097>
A gundam where the suits aren't flight capable, air or space, so it's fighter pilots and mech pilots working together and trying to keep each other alive, in space the suits are ship defense and boarding.
I'm starting to hit that point in zeta atm <:TsubasaYareYare:407397617451139073>
bouncy walks <:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
though even this server pushed me to actually watched it, I did like a 7 episode binge to catch up lol
spring was spy x family and love after world domination, summer was recoil, and now in fall it's g-witch
think recoil was my only seasonal last season, but I mainly just have been watching 1-2 new shows and 1-2 old ones each season
also has some good music https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R57m9kRXA4E
maybe not in a lot of the fights (unless the ship itself is under serious threat), but the crew would definitely be a part of the "down time on the ship" for sure
I personally liked takina giddy over winning rock paper scissors
https://tenor.com/view/lycoris-recoil-takina-yes-yes-yes-kazumaozk-gif-26404957
once played a custom tabletop game made of lego but funy enough I don't think it made use of you being able to disassemble the units lol
also I think the idea of an 08th kind of mech team with a star wars kind of fighter squadron team working together to get through their missions and the war, with some downtime on their ship in between, would be a nice dynamic
so thruster if any would be for reorientation and slowing an impact
was going for more the mechs don't have enough power to fly that far, even in space
but it's been months
don't recall gunbuster having air support

since it's thin metal meant to crumple in a crash and plastic mainly
why police cars might have added stuff in their doors compared to civilian models
like the talk in the firing range where Takina lays out why using the non-lethal rounds would get her killed was such a relief the show wasn't just going "become like Chisato or you're bad"
I like how while Chisato's distaste for killing was an overall good thing, they showed that the blanks aren't always the right choice for everyone and every situation
show does seem to have a general power struggle background
and the council of mobile suit companies he's giving the speech to is the counsel he now heads, and those companies are the houses at the school (besides earth house)
the one talking about why gundams should be banned while the facility is raided
prologue speech guy is rich girl's father
I'm not watching for yuri I'm watching for mechs, the corporate intrigue, and the positive mechanic <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456> https://twitter.com/G_Witch_M/status/1592827320234115075
it's the anime way <:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
but with mechs, including mechs for riot police
that also works
well they aren't, just engaged
Well it's the typical view of players, like tall highschoolers being asked if they play basketball
Just thinking of a 5'5 basketball player is funny when the nba average is (googles) 6'7
A 170cm basketball player?
ruthless corporatism can include the military industrial complex though
and over such a short time frame, so stupid
Just watched Zeta Gundam episodes 35+36 ||they really brought Four back just to kill her again?|| <:TsubasaAngry:692141154531016765>
https://twitter.com/KennyLauderdal3/status/1594807474678276104
this reminds me, when I watched the Vivy dub I was like "why does she sound so familiar?" turns out the VA also does the english VA of Ladybug <:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
yeah <@404782531582623744> I just have no interest in more super robot styled mecha
sadly most of her wishlist is likely either out of stock or a delayed pre-order <:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
https://tenor.com/view/gundam-thunderbolt-drums-anime-recording-gif-8040782
wasn't cour 2 pushed back a bit already? so that should mean plenty of time to recover from something
wondering the same thing about the cours <:HibikiThink:688429715362414641>
Hope she gets better soon <:ChrisPray:672578403156885504>
in other news, for these final few episodes I've lost track on what the actual battle is about <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
if that was a retcon then ||it was just literal plot-armor pre-retcon||
||that sounds like some powerful relic kind of tech, not a gundam thought up by a kid who barely had any experience and one engineer quickly|| <:TsubasaYareYare:407397617451139073>
aaaand ||the last pilot I actually cared about is dead||
||kamile gets upset, he and zeta gundam glows pink and beams do nothing to it||
Zeta 49 ||new type powers now include invincibility?|| <:ShemHaWhat:929756727493132288>
Just realized now watching the last few episodes, Zeta being cool action and designs but with mostly stupid characters makes 0083 an even more fitting prequel in retrospect <:Ver:704169051391524875>
when I do watch CCA, I am looking forward to the 0079 dub cast
well I'm done with going through 50 episodes for this era of gundam, and ZZ has no comp movie so I think after this I'm jumping straight to CCA then trying out other timelines as far as gundam goes
I actually enjoyed the first half of Zeta more than the vast majority of 0079, this last half has been pretty frustrating though besides some good action here and there
Well 0079 improving over time and Zeta having a solid first half had me hopeful for watching more UC shows, but I think I'm done with full series UC, too much time spent on annoying children getting away with being stupid.
well I've mainly seen OVA's from UC, where child characters are minimized (or in 0080's case, are being children, not battleship crew)
How much of the second half of this show is just kids taking off without permission and getting away with it? <:ChrisEnraged:423196924368388105>
zeta gundam episode 46 ||wow that went from first use of funnels to straight up stupid mind battles over the course of a minute huh?|| <:TsubasaYareYare:407397617451139073>
zeta gundam episode 45 ||rip one of the few named pilots I actually cared about||
||he's not a vegetable, he's just reverted to a (younger) child mentally||
finished the last episode, guess ||Kamile's complaints about adults being worse than children came back to bite him|| <:Ver:704169051391524875>
when I mentioned I was watching zeta to someone in dm's they said how much they hated her and since I was still at the ||pre-Scirocco|| part of her plot I didn't get it lol <:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
the most stupid of the adult characters
at least all his pre-O transforming suits looked like they were part of the same weird family
just saying he spends all show making bug suits then ends with a chunky guy that looks more like a fat Rick Dias than any of his suits
I find it funny his last and apparently peak suit is the most normal one out of his sub-faction <:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
Hizak and Gundam Mk.II are nice visual improvements from their 0079 counterparts that also give them a more gournded feel, really like the Rick Dias, and the Nemo is good, even if not GM level of cool grunt suit
but yeah, I find the initial suits in Zeta the best ones
makes sense as he gets most of the focus later on
pretty much every titan's suit added after the marasai and the asshimar got added I don't really like
still far better looking  than all the titan transformers that came after it
the O is just meh and chunky, I'm mainly saying how pretty much all the transformers after ashmir and zeta look like goofy bugs
tbh I find most of the suits added in later on really silly looking
ah
I like the mk.II's look better
so I at least got to hear both actual op songs before switching over the generic instrumental openings <:Ver:704169051391524875>
what I've been doing since like episode 26
like so much dumb is going on I barely felt a thing when characters I did like died ||Apolly, Emma, and Henken||
tbh I wouldn't mind the depressing bits if it wasn't combined with the dumb bits
for me first half was great, 2nd half got dumb, and final stretch was dumb but with added death
but who knows, I might have just missed some lines while being stunned by characters being dumb <:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
||all of a sudden axis is about to hit the moon after not being mentioned for a bit, then apparently aeug now has the space laser working after sabotaging it's power and chasing off zeon just like the previous day, and every Titan is just on board with being alongside zeon with no struggle all of a sudden||
I know the wider conflict, just more what's being fought over when and what each side has
also <@148466885917147136> I now see ||why vegetable is said since he is one in that first ZZ ep, he's just memory lost and child like in the end of Zeta||
just skimmed ZZ's first ep ||wow it's just a direct continuation of Zeta, no time skip or anything||
fitting given ||how he's all about manipulating women||
Not even that, Char said he wanted Lalah to be his mother, guess he couldn't accept Amuro as his dad <:Ver:704169051391524875>
tbh a goofy mess of a dub like this is better than a flatly performed dub (looking at you every non-0079 character in Zeta)
||and the thing is they attempted it, so the thought must have been in their heads, but they just *had* to justify the T thing and have it backfire on Char||
||tbh if they just went with everyone brought together by newtype understanding to save the earth instead of that being attempted but failing, it would be cheesy but at least would have made more sense and fit the message of gundam better||
I guess lastly my thoughts on the general plot. It did a bunch of stuff from past gundams I both liked and disliked before but at least always seemed to do them a bit better. For example, ||Quess may be annoying, but it's bearable (besides when she comments on conversations she isn't a part of while they happen) and the plot between Char, her, and Hathaway is far less frustrating than Paptimus, pink hair girl, and Katz doing a very similar thing in Zeta.|| One exception was the ending, Instead of the ||climatic hard-fought victory|| of 0079, or the ||everybody looses depression|| of Zeta, it's just most out of nowhere nonsensical deus ex machina.
yeah, that was the one flub of the dub that stuck out bad lol
Also, while I skimmed a ZZ/First Neo Zeon War summary before watching, seems like just 0079 and Zeta are what's needed to get everything besides the basic knowledge that ||the Zeon faction from Zeta is decapitated in ZZ||
||CCA seemed to be the worst gundam to be a mechanic in, both named ones die||
||speaking of gf's, Chan was a far better one than that blonde Amuro had in Zeta, dick move Hathaway|| <:ChrisEnraged:423196924368388105>
||Also rip him and his gf, they seemed nice together|| <:HibikiSad:738234648509022368>
||I was wiki info bar spoiled that he died but was in ZZ and CCA before I even watched Zeta, and I only said he survived the Zeta ending mass death. ||
Speaking of, Bright still is the most competent good guy in UC.
The animation was good and I like how the equipment has gotten more competent (battleships have lower/more protected bridges for combat, mobiles suits have escape pods, and crew have personal grapples to get around in zero g)
Just watched Char's Counterattack. Watched the dub since I enjoyed the 0079 Toonami dub this cast reprises their roles from, and they still do a good job and the new characters have energy to them (avoided the Zeta dub because when I tried an episode of it the acting was so flat).
yes
Hoping she gets better, and also hoping she returns for cour 2. <:ChrisPray:672578403156885504>
||and even in Zeta the mechanic lives||
||yeah, while I think g-witch will get darker, I don't expect a zeta gundam level named character massacre from this style of show||
||true, just hoping Nika actually gets to the end of the series||
https://twitter.com/MON0EYE/status/1598464087079489538 oh so that's who the replacement is. Tbh a decent fit. Also I guess now my favorite side character from 2 different mecha's share a VA. ||Hope Nika has a better life than Kaie though.||
the top 2 there are some of the initial ones my sister's classmates showed her in college I think <:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
that would be a big change of opinion for her then, she's always been quite against them for moderation reasons, though the live did get a thread so I guess that opinion has softened
yeah, seen a few servers do thing like that, current anime for things airing/under a year old and a more general anime channel
guess I might need to un mute/hide that channel in the near future, despite me barely caring what's in there
ah, never saw that post
given talking anime (a narrative medium) inherently involves spoilers, I feel <#377148557796442134> is more a "just in case" someone has spoilers that don't fit in the channels for certain interests
just saying concentrated days
Recoil days last season and Gundam days this season, walls of black bars lol <:GenjuroLaugh:689563633516150872> (motivates me to watch the episode so I can click on them all <:Ver:704169051391524875>)
barely anyone talks anime there anyway (also why didn't you say anything the past 10 minus 1 Sundays? <:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>)
what really surprised me with macross is when they sung silent night in Japanese, Jesus stuff and all
I guess I should rephrase my statement from "anime" to "japanese tv media"
ah
oh wait, 86 had christmas stuff too
only anime christmas I've seen is from the original macross <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
I mean it is supposed to be a Jesus birth celebration....
Gundam on Christmas though <:HibikiFingerguns:688429715836502063>
"delayed to the 18th" nothing is delayed to the 18th, 11 is delayed to the 25th from the 18th
also no episode on the 1st due to new year's programing
this seems to show the episode that was on the 18th was delayed, not the next episode delayed to the 18th
Delta plus is mostly grey
Other, that one isn't common or mainly dark blue
Dark blue common transforming unit
I quite liked Methus but cooler
Funny enough I found the unicorn and banahee the least interesting suits lol
Well before I move on to SEED I'm taking a Gundam break and starting Macross Frontier during my plane flights today. <:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
||artificial Char more consistent to Char than real Bright||
Oh also I watched the dub and found it ironic how Full Frontal sounds more like the old dub Char than Bright's (still most competent UC character <:GenjuroThumbsUp:336657189475188740>) VA compared to the past one
Also watching this makes me understand what people have said about modern UC not being friendly to new comers with how it leans so hard on past events <:Ver:704169051391524875>
Just finished Unicorn, while I said I was done with full 50 ep UC shows I did want to give this UC OVA a try due to seeing some cool mechs and action from it. And I have to say, I really enjoyed it and found it a better wrap up to what came before in UC than CCA by a lot. Characters good, action and designs were good, and music was good. Plot was pretty decent as well. Riddy's arc was a bit all over the place and there was some silly newtype magic contrivances but it did not stumble hard at the end like Zeta or CCA. Also enjoyed the cycles of revenge focus and did get a chuckle from some Symphogear XV similarities (protag saying "even so", curses that can be blessings/prayers, and believe in what humanity can do in the future). <:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
Kid learns war is not a game, I just find kids annoying <:Ver:704169051391524875>
Didn't love it personally but it does what it set out to do perfectly
Hit the ||fake out of repeat skull leader death|| during my last flight, man this show is a callback addict.
And speaking of my watches, watched the first 8 episodes of Macross Frontier on my first flight today, none of the characters are grabbing me except Ranka, the songs and action are mostly meh (except episode 7 for both), and it wastes so much time trying to be a generic comedy...how is this the favorite Macross of so many? Unless it has a major shift?
Think I might have heard that since the original not the remaster is on my watchlist
Oh wait I think I've heard this, isn't one considered a worse dub than the other?
Has a decent dub apparently and that made 0079 not so bad so not too worried
Seeing a lot of the characters return probably (not bothering with the thing in between) but in no rush to, Macross Frontier and SEED are my next mecha watches
wonder if there is a recording of this somewhere https://twitter.com/aniki_z/status/933549495287083008
as someone who hasn't heard of this guy before this story, any good songs from him to listen to?
love when translators get creative for the sake of the joke <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
https://twitter.com/topherflorence/status/1602052383143596033
I could definitely see him disliking the commercialized side though
Just saying, "fetishize the weapons" of his anti-war story you say like it's contrary to him while Tomino himself finds weapons cool.
But hasn't Tomino also reacted to an American WW2 bomber with that, despite the fact it could have killed him in the past, he still can find it cool?
well I guess Aoi at least has a gundam <:HibikiFingerguns:688429715836502063>
tbh I might have mixed things up, both girls look similar in their helmets <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>

Green Lantern TAS was pretty decent too
At least in the mainline comics, he got to have a nice family in the renew your vows au
||well this is a new Elan||
just realized all of the Lupin the 3rd Part 2 dub is officially on youtube...which makes it being put behind paywall on crunchy a few months ago even more odd
Cursed
Maybe if the most competent man in UC didn't have to always be saving the world he could have raised his son better <:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
Question for the Gundam fans here, does the Hathaway movie ever bring up any regret/redemption for Hathaway being an ||intentional teamkiller of a good person||? Since if it doesn't I don't think I'll bother watching it as I couldn't respect him as a protag if that part of his past is just unaddressed or accepted as fine.
||guessing the one not the cat girl is the tsun||
only have watched the op and some early clips, but looks like a nice show, enjoy <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
do it yourself?
at least you get more new anime on youtube (gundam) and netflix <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
that' stupid, like I can watch clips and trailers on Netflix's anime youtube when most of the things they post aren't even on American Netflix <:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
Speaking of fun dubs, getting the itch to return to watching Lupin the 3rd part 2
I'll try those out Blockio, except Unicorn but only because I've already listened to that <:GenjuroThumbsUp:336657189475188740>
I was asking for song recommendations not whole ost's
Dropped Kill la Kill, never have seen any attack on titan except that gigguk joke dub and the op
Any recs? I have only found stuff from him through those 2 shows.
He makes good mecha music then <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
Due to looking up the music on youtube and them being on the same artist's official channel <:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
Just learned Gundam Unicorn had the same composer as 86
(also I recently ordered the LN chapter after the anime ends to hit free shipping on a bluray order)
Going to rewatch it soon and show my family, I'm looking forward to it
A better time frame than thunderbolt's 3rd movie, which is none
guess it's a bit better than doing the colony drop constantly
oh so that concept has spread outside of UC? (just watched Zeta and Unicorn so that's fresh on my mind)
This one merch announcement has launched a lot of fanart already and "congrats" tweets
Skimming through the first 86 book, surprised the ending scene of the show (that covers books 1-3 from what I've heard) is actually one of the book 1 epilogues. Guess that makes sense to put that good ending in book 1 if you don't know you're getting more books, also has that scene make even more sense as the end cap of the show now.
My order from the rightstuf holiday sale came in, including my first LN's
speaking of the OYW https://twitter.com/MON0EYE/status/1605059109073584128
or fans not posting non-spoiler action clips or fanart
since it's an impossible task for people getting into gundam, unless they go into anime full blind off title alone
like seems like a mindset only vet fans who have watched most series as they aired would have
which is kind of why my initial reaction to people dodging mech spoilers was "wow, sounds like a mess to do".  Since I have not seen a single mecha show were I hadn't seen the mechs in it multiple times before even choosing to watch.
then there's new comers to gundam like me who will often come across most of the mecha designs before they ever get around to sitting down to a show (especially 50 episode monsters like most gundam full series)
but now that I know I'll make kit spoilers dodgers' hard task a bit easier by spoilering any I post
I see kit announcements rewteeted by gear fan artists and general anime fans who do gunpla. <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095> And even beyond announcements, kits come out and builds get posted before the mechs show up it seems as well.
didn't realize people were still talking in the "episode 10" thread, let alone about future kits not in episode 10
fair
must be a mess to dodge then
Oh?
a new gundam without a name atm

Would have been a nice contrast
||Tbh it was nice seeing spearhead try to adjust to normal life after their awful childhoods, but yeah, would have liked switching povs in episodes like cour 1||
Oh yeah, seeing more of her organize the defense as things collapse would have been cool
At least in the anime I feel Shin has less focus for most of cour 2 than cour 1, since he's no longer fighting his own demon as the main threat.
It's good, just pulled down a bit by my dislike of headstrong little kid characters (like why I only found 0080 just ok personal taste wise)
Knew anime was book 1 cour 1 and books 2-3 cour 2. So when I saw that epilogue in my skim I knew what it time skipped.
Ik
Well I guess the one really great and not just good part of cour 2 is the book 1 epilogue <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
I mean the anime ended great by ending there so I can see that. I mainly got book 4 to see some post-reunion Lena and Spearhead interactions, not because the anime ending left me wanting plot-wise.
My sister is apparently on episode 100 something after her college friends got her into it
2011 one
Sister is showing me the first episode of Hunter x Hunter
Just passed the climax of cour 1 of 86 with my family. They wondered what Anju's back tatoo was in the shower scene and since I just got the LN I checked there... it wasn't a tatoo. <:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
Though I guess my sister and Suletta are both "tall" red head girls
Though she's college age not highschool
My little sister is taller <:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
Oh, that's adorable then <:MikuCute:672908542763859968>
Context? (Not a Pokemon watcher, think I saw the one episode on tv as a kid where the girl borrowed pikachu)
My sister has been showing me it, at episode 9 atm. I like the characters but not the concept that much so far.
Karen is the type to give orders and to tell people to stop whining (and scare off boyfriends)
That is a prerequisite
And unlike suletta, she is capable of flooring bad people herself <:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
Wonder how tall the other female redhead gundam pilot is 🤔
In the top 3 <:HibikiFingerguns:688429715836502063>
https://twitter.com/MarcFBR/status/1606745618348933120
we have a thread for G-Witch stuff now
and so is the end bit of SDF Macross (complete with Silent Night in Japanese)
||https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZwSNxXxsO0k||
86 cour 2 is also a christmas show <:GenjuroThumbsUp:336657189475188740>
~~pile of hamburger for Christmas dinner?~~
I guess 86 part 2 had its lovely ending in 2022 but I didn't watch that as it aired and it started in 2021.  <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
Recoil prob is my favorite new anime this year but I've only seen a few (Spy x Family, Love after World Domination, Recoil, and G-Witch). But also I've liked all those.
Been a good year.
that apparently never addresses that one thing he had done before in the timeline
still amazed that teamkiller got a movie at all
Oh yeah. Since you only see the supply core supplying white base they just blended as white base crew in my mind<:HibikiWhoops:585839808115507222>
if Full Frontal wanted to do good things I feel Angelo would be for that, just Full Frontal doesn't want to do good things so neither does Angelo
he's a fanboying teen, he's less charismatic than Full Frontal but as far as morals, he's pretty much a Full Frontal yes man
he is pretty much just a die-hard (and simp) follower of Full Frontal so I don't really distinguish the 2 in "how bad" rankings
at least in the OVA, have no clue how the manga frames things
but then, Full Frontal is the one framed the least sympathetically of Unicron Neo Zeon
Full Frontal and his lackeys fit that, though most of the rest seem to be more mimicing people from hot spots of decades long ethnic tension and/or places the war on terror has occurred
at least the Zeons in Unicorn that are made sympathetic (so those not mainly following Full Frontal) are more acting like multi-generational rebels/terrorists, stuck in a cycle of revenge as their reason to fight rather than firm belief in the spacenoid supremist ideals of Zeon/early iterations of Neo Zeon
though it goes back to 0079, before gundam fanboys in general existed
actually I guess the one old general in 0079 was fine
tbh, like most UC media (including 0079) I found every fed not part of the protag (and/or Bright's) crew an asshole
Goggles fed in 0083 is the main officer of the antagonist faction. He leads the black uniformed group you see get founded at the end of 0083. Pretty much a facist peace through power and control rouge (but powerful) fed faction.
It makes sense the feds we see acting this way when looking at this as a prequel that sets up Zeta/the Titans (where the Titans made up of these feds are pretty much fed Zeon, mech designs, colony drops, and all), though making them effectively protags in it is where is loses me.
also Mora, (though her main role is putting the womanizing fed in his place)
My 0083 experience was pretty much "could you awful and/or stupid characters stop distracting from the cool music and visuals please?"
Was looking through my family's dvds for what I want to make backups of, turns out my dad has aquired his childhood anime on dvd <:GenjuroLaugh:689563633516150872>
Tbh I didn't jump right into cour 2 since I found the school focused episodes later in cour 1 a bit lacking, was so happy when the last ep went back to mainly family stuff (even if the naration made it feel like it should have been the start of cour 2)
I'll prob get to Bocchi and cour 2 of SpyxFam next year when I need a sci-fi break
Though I think my favorite thing that aired this year was the last episode of 86 cour 2
As far as shows that aired this year I wayched (not many), Recoil would be on top with G-Witch and SpyxFamily (only have seen cour 1) the tier below that
I mean he often jokes about even enjoying hot trash if it's up his alley <:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
(they said they were a magical girl and mecha fan so I jumped at that chance)
oh, looks like my recipient just got my recommendation too, they just added Symphogear and Symphogear G to their plan to watch <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
I participated in the MAL secret santa and got it recommended for me because my santa saw I had "sci-fi" "cute friendships" and "characters sacrificing for each other" in my list of likes
Astra Lost in Space
not a bad result for an anime forum secret santa then
Just got this from my MAL secret santa recommendation today (delays), is it good?
https://twitter.com/KennyLauderdal3/status/1609341946262355969
oh yeah, wish there was a BOX equivalent for the BGM's, since I love them but I'm not buying a random spread of BD's to have them physically
I am tempted to get season 1 disk 1 for the cover art and the kanade song cd
10th anniversary ain't a bad time to get into a show <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I joked with some people shortly after watching the show "love this show but I have no interest in buying a bd, shame there isn't a full soundtrack" under a week before the BOX announcement <:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
only to learn the admins here have little to do with the sub itself, though I was shown anime art sourcing sites which was handy
I joined since I found the sub reddit and was trying to see if anyone knew the sources for the cycling banner art on the old reddit version of the sub
despite all my watching my only airing seasonals have been lycoreco, cour 1 of spy x family, that romcom set in a power rangers type universe, and g-witch
kinda sad I was in Japan most of summer 2018-summer 2019 but wasn't into anime till after I left (even birdy the mighty: decode I only watched on the travel to see family after back state side)
my family had that "speed racer the movie" dvd with 2 story arcs from the old show, and I watched witchblade in 2016 and birdy the mighty: decode in 2019, but beyond that I wasn't diving into anime till I watched gear mid January
made a thread of the anime I've watched this year (first year of the brainrot) https://twitter.com/ENDfilms44/status/1609317646008475648
I just find making any space sci-fi being labeled as an isekai makes the term broad to the point of pointless lol
"my world changed forever"
"world" doesn't just mean planet
By that logic going to a foreign country on a road trip is an isekai
That was part of far
No, they just get small and travel far
https://tenor.com/view/cyberchase-gif-23534582
Oh...that is an isekai...
Isn't reboot computer people, not people transported into a computer?
||though ignoring the intentional wordplay, in-universe there are 86 districts of the republic, and the 86th one is the warzone the segregated have to fight the invaders in while the majority race hang out in 1-85||
||I had a math teacher that would tell students to "86 that hoodie"||
I've hinted that there might be *some* survivors, but leaving her uncertain who
I had to say so many "we'll see"s to my sister towards the end of half one about the main 5
||turning does not mean out of blast radius||
||tbh I still remember checking back to Raiden's "death" because I was confused he was alive, only to see there was no mech in sight during the shot of the rail impacting||
looking forward to her reaction when we watch the final 2
just watched the final battle of 86 with my family, 2 episodes left, my sister was saying she isn't liking how it's ending (in the sad character death sense), all I told her was "we've seen no bodies yet" <:ChrisHehehe:688429717019426821>
Then laughed about it
They brought the Sulletta to tears
Racist bullies that sabotaged mechs before tests
~~can rvb become one by association then?~~
Like if you try to define by style you could throw things like Avatar and Teen Titans in, and the million other japan inspired cartoons
Yeah that's what I feel is the most common and solid western use
Since those more subjective definitions flex easily
Well that's the only way to define it solidly is by place of origin. Do you think anime should be defined by genre, tropes, or eye and head proportions? <:Ver:704169051391524875>
Like if you want to argue about style, a lot of older anime made in Japan with Japanese ip for Japanese audiences...looked like western stuff
Imo anime (in the west) just means animation from Japan, though I guess the "anime" worked on by korean and chinese animators might slide that definition to east asia as a whole
Exactly
Well a person in Japan could call western cartoons "anime". <:Ver:704169051391524875>
Also this rewatch solidified my own enjoyment of the 2nd cour (1st cour was already a 10/10 for me since first watch). I had put cour 2 at a 9/10 on MAL on first watch, and I still feel that's right, just more solidly now and not slipping towards an 8 compared to my first watch. Federica worked better for me this time around and also I was reminded how emotionally impactful the final few episodes were, not just the ending scene I have rewatched on youtube multiple time.
Finished showing 86 to my family tonight, final 2 episodes for the last watch session. My sister was real antsy for ||Shin and Lena to meet each other face to face the whole time tonight, so seeing her pop off a bit when it did happen was great||. Everyone liked it. <:MikuPraise:585839808765493249> Right after the watch I went to read the first page or two of volume 4 of the LN (got 1 and 4 during a holiday sale) and my sister asked to see volume 1 to skim the pictures and ended up reading the first chapter in one sitting. <:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
Like most of the plot
Characters in Frontier didn't arc, they jumped around
Compared to Frontier? Lol
Vivy hit harder for me, but Recoil is more fun and has the better ending (Vivy involves time travel so that near guarantees it being a little messy to end)
I can solidly recommend Recoil or Vivy
Zero I thought was just fine. Nothing about it bugged me and the action and characters were a decent watch for it's short duration. Just had nothing exceptional (except for decent looking cg integration for the time, frontier's cg planes stuck out worse years later)
Delta comp movie is my true least fave due to how it made my fave bland and more padded
Except maybe the non character/plot stuff just in the end bit for Frontier
Delta had characters and, more importantly, character relations/development I loved, consistently great songs, hype action, and an unexceptional but flowing plot/conflic. None of which I could say for Frontier.
Still puzzled how this one is like the default favorite for most you ask about Macross.
<@272127150579122178> you were right that it does pick up in the last 3rd, but just in songs and interesting things (action, etc.), plot and characters stayed uninteresting or messy for the most part.
Just finished Macross Frontier. My least favorite Macross show so far, not bad (Macross has a good quality bar if this is the worst one), just bounces between dull and things just happening with no good buildup.
At least it's that clean if you ignore ovas
Solo idols to rockbands to rival idols (and high school drama) to idol groups to artificial singers
7 was the lowest on my macross priorities because of how wild it seemed lol
I mean we've ready hit vocaloids and ai, we're getting close lol
7 is the only non summary movie or short I haven't seen
Yeah, that was the pilots name drops
Like the only thing I was confused on past shows explained was Frontier and fold quartz effects
Like all the Delta (show) tie ins are name drops of past pilots and singers and not much further, why I wasn't left confused starting with it
Yeah, I don't think Delta would work as a non-macross show (singing and plane mechs are at its core), but it could have easily been an AU before the movies tied it in further
I guess that's why most big Delta fans in the west have it as the show that got them to first enjoy macross
Also I guess they ended the love triangle differently (by doing what the muv luv te anime would later do lol)
Though at least most of the callbacks weren't shock tropes in Frontier, like them in-universe making a Macross 0 movie for some reason
Frontier's is teasing fans, while SDF was actually trying to be emotional
Though it makes the SDF one look more dumb in retrospect ||ha ha, he was just unlucky||
They did nothing different, just a case of luck
Nah, the frontier version is a beat for beat repeat just without a ||death||
So what's your thoughts on the skull leader bait and switch in Frontier?
Thought you said you've only seen delta and frontier?
Ponytail boy puts on the earring
The only time singing helps a pilot beyond morale and surpressing var is when someone is wearing fold quartz, which is a straight from Frontier thing
Frontier did that hard, just more effect on the enemy than the pilot. ||Though like Hayate, ponytail boy eventually wears some fold quartz and get pulled into the astral space by gf singing||
Exactly
Yeah, one battle does not god-tier make. Also she isn't a bad pilot, just not near the ace tier of Hayate or her Grandpa
What retcons? If they had them they weren't as in your face as Frontier's forced callbacks to SDF and Zero
She wasn't god tier she just found a place she did well at after a life of trying to live up to her family
Think it actually was the creator didn't want one but was pretty much forced to since it's a macross staple
They actually do some decent stuff with her in the sequel movie thankfully
I feel bad for her, but as someone who tends to find love triangles are more annoying than they're worth, glad they pretty much just gave it the bare minimum for the sake of the franchise checklist
At least his relationship developed, Frontier ponytail boy can barely say that.
Like I've heard and seen stills of Ghost in the Shell but know little about it
Hm, cool
Not its mechs
Wait, exo force had him involved?
0083 is the only one of these anime I know lol
I'm curious
What has he designed outside of Macross mechs?
Decent motive tbh lol
Might eventually get to 7 just for more of Max's family though
Tbh I would be up for a new rockband, as it's the super robot ness not the band that's kept me from 7 lol
We really do be in Macross news limbo (outside of bandai merch). No new updates of the western bd's since July and still waiting on the next thing to be announced now that walkure is ending
Though I guess you could argue for most of plus it's auto tune lol
Plus doing ai already and Zero not really having a trend
maybe it's a delay in subbing or maybe they are cutting it so close they can't give them the file to upload early enough
could be much worse, could be 86 cour 2 (having a gap from mid december to mid march between episodes 21 and 22) <:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
I've only watched the english dub, was good though
Think the first few episodes of witchblade are officially on youtube too
Enjoy the story about motherhood and corprate plots while scantily armored women fight robot monsters and each other
I mean "ecstacy", the breathing, and the visuals would hint at that
https://youtu.be/MnY4IWwlzQo
And hey the next heroine anime I watched through was gear, so early 2010's
Horny teen browsing comic wikis
Witchblade is mid 2000's and birdy decode is late 2000's if I recall
Horny teenage me stumbling into good stories with attractive heroines, did not seek them out as anime lol
Oh hey the eras of my first 2 animes (that I watched in the mid-late 2010's)
it was stated to have part of inspired Man of Steel (though at least in Birdy it was abandoned buildings they were smashing through <:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>)
now I'm just thinking how Birdy the Mighty Decade's visuals was 50/50, great visuals season one, very rough stuff in season 2
looking at A-1's list of shows, just realized the shounen my sister is watching atm is them too
so you can blame Birdy season 2 for all the jokes about how Superman is killing everyone when fighting Zod <:Ver:704169051391524875>
it was his childhood anime, but it came on in the morning and the bus would come before an episode would finish <:Ver:704169051391524875>
Started watching Star Blazers (Space Battleship Yamato dub) with my dad tonight <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
Oh hey look, Shaggy with Shaggy hair, who would have thought? /s
And also they chose the pothead styled character to be who they made black <:TsubasaYareYare:407397617451139073>
6 episodes in to Star Blazers so far, cool seeing the non-mecha design style predecessor to the early real robot shows I've seen so far (0079 Gundam and SDF Macross)
His special ability makes the final fight cool when you get to it <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Each project in the franchise is pretty much it's own separate thing. So I've mainly just heard to watch the initial ova series to know the characters then do what you want (show, movies, etc.)
I remember thinking it sounded good from gigguk's video on the series, so might give the anime a try since I'm not really a manga reader
That's getting an anime this year right?
prob more people just avoided and haven't reviewed velma would be my guess
prob the most "special" issue it had was being an clear example of Crunchyroll lying through their teeth when they say the money to them supports the Japanese animation industry (given HGS was going to be the first of multiple western made animations funded by crunchy, but then the backlash and delayed production made them abandon that plan)
Oh and my dad felt the setting was familiar, turns out where it's set is just 2 hours from where we were stationed in 2018/2019 and where we would need to go for a trip on the bullet train. <:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
With a couple days left here with family and not enough time to watch another show, I showed my dad (and re-showed my mom) *I Want to Eat Your Pancreas*. A while since I first watched but I still love this movie, the main guy is relatable to me (very much for offline me), the story is touching, and the end still hits me in the feels hard.
I need to read her main star wars books eventually (the clone commando ones)
I learned Kriffing from the Clone Wars movie novelization by Karen Travis, since she mainly does military sci-fi and gave the clones (and their soldier ways) a lot more focus than the movie
Kriffing
Though I sometimes find myself using the star wars swear (not slur) word in my head sometimes lol
Never have played cyberpunk but wouldn't surprise me
That's not a slur, "split lip" and "hinge head" are though (oh hey guess I remember more than droid ones)
The only fictional "slurs" I can remember are for battle droids, "clankers" and "tinnies".
Yeah, exactly. It was probably fine, nothing amazing or awful for many to talk about.
Also on my flight I watched the first 6 episodes of SEED (original dub). Really enjoying protecting those they care about being the main motivator for our protag. Also wow, with the protag and his friends there are actually kid gundam characters that don't come off as annoying off the bat that I'm actually enjoying seeing. Also the designs and action is pretty good.
Watched Macross DYRL on my flight. Fixxed every problem I had with the original but also removed my favorite aspects and reworked the conflict in a way I enjoyed less. Good watch but I'm glad future shows used the original show as their base.
Actually I skipped from Zeta to CCA with just a quick wiki skim of ZZ lol
Well when they are talking severity of past things that either side has done in the past that context helps
Still, they name drop a lot of stuff from zeta-cca
Also one last thing about seed, glad I took the time to find how to get the original dub, liking it
Didn't watch my current second favorite till late on, since it's Unicorn and you kinda need to work through UC to get what's going on
My first gundam was 08th, which is still my favorite gundam
Well hey if it "gets good" at 20 and I've had a better time in 1-6 than most of 0079 or zeta I think I'll like this show
Yeah, kids sticking up for their friends is such a nice change of pace from all the whiners in UC
Also do far SEED is the first time I'm not instantly annoyed at the young gundam protags
It did take like 6 episodes to stop cliffhangering lol
But yeah gundam can flop hard late in (looking at you Zeta)
6 episodes in I'm liking it more than any other non-ova gundam I've seen
Speaking of gundam, <@954207824248967188> I started watching the show with your beloved Strike on my first flight today <:GenjuroThumbsUp:336657189475188740>
So that kind of stuff is interesting
Oh yeah, I recall a star wars book that listed the costs of various weapons and tech
Food and manpower are probably their limiting factors
Metal (astroids) and fuel (jupitor fleets) are the 2 things UC Gundam doesn't lack
Well in UC they just keep bringing astroids into orbit
Think I'm going to keep my Eva experiences to just people poking fun at it <:Ver:704169051391524875>
Finished the original Patlabor OVA. Some nice fun at the begining (though sometimes getting a bit too goofy). Some action and intrigue for 5 and 6, and a nice balance of those past 2 aspects for the last episode. So far not regretting getting this collection on sale in the summer, prob will watch movies 1 and 2 this week.
Me to. Though replacing non-updated tf2 and dirtybomb and painful apex arenas instead of OW which I was never super into.
You mean g-witch delays right? Since evo has met its given dates that I recall.
If they don't add a witch suit next season they better for the season overlaping season 2's start
Tbh I'm surprised they added nu instead of ariel this last season, especially since both are funnel focused
||mad scientist forcefully evolving meteorite bacteria into a giant sea man, and it actually being real and not some ploy or robot||
So I just finished the 3rd episode of the original Patlabor OVA, been a fun sci-fi cop show so far but was not expecting just how silly episode 3 turned out to be....
Starts as more a mystery/procedural then ends as more an action/thriller.
Patlabor 1 good movie.
Checked, yeah, Evan Call. I looked him up after he showed up in one of videos on the G blu-ray. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evan_Call
The American that worked on G and GX's ost was involved in that right?
I have listened to some of it's ost I think though.
And no, have not seen Violet Evergarden.
Tbh Pancreas amazed me that it managed to surprise me when ||the girl, who being terminally ill has been the central thing of this, died||
It's a metaphor combining 2 superstitions joked about early in their relationship
It's a phrase that comes into play at the end but the basis for it making sense comes early on.
It's cute then gut punches you towards the end, but the end is good. Bedt summary I have for it is "2 very different people grow to want to learn from each other (and one is terminally ill)"
My current 10/10's from 1 year of anime are gear season 1, I Want to Eat Your Pancreas, and 86 cour 1.
I have it as a 9/10 too, but I haven't found a 10/10 gundam, so it sits at the top. Even from general mecha I've seen 86 cour 1 is the only thing above 08th so far.
I don't find it awful, just meh and kinda pointless.
Though even the gundaminfo uploads ignore 12 <:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
Even if it is weeker, I still find the second half (except 12) very good.
nvm, looking at mal I watched 0079 between 08th and 0080, then watched thunderbolt before 0083. But did start both 0080 and 0083 in the same week.
I watched it and 0083 as my next 2 gundams after starting with 08th (wasn't keen on jumping into 50 episodes a show back then). Funny watching those things back to back for me, this they are pretty much the opposites of each other (outside of quality animation of the era for both). 0083- bad plot but great action 0080- great plot but a bit boring
like it's one of those shows I would change nothing about, despite me not loving it
yeah 0080 is prob the most successful mecha I've seen so far at executing its message, I just find it meh when it comes to entertainment
0083 is a mess, great visuals and music, but the characters suck for the most part
yeah but most of it's run time focusing on an annoying kid, the best done and least pointless annoying kid, but still annoying
no whiney kids, no newtype goofiness, no characters just making the stupidest decisions for no reason
episode 12 is pointless (beyond seeing/hearing how the characters are at the very start and end) and Miller's Report is on par with the Macross Delta movie of making a good show boring, but episodes 1-11 and the short made for the BD are all peak good gundam for me
though besides the start of SEED I haven't really left UC yet
my first gundam and still my favorite
https://twitter.com/180223/status/1617900702864674816 might be a good time for a rewatch <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
https://twitter.com/dustinsdivot/status/1618507833611517953
maybe that vpn server is used so much it's blocked <:Ver:704169051391524875>
oh wait, you were already vpn'd to US?
and I guess they don't feel the need to bother making it available right away for places were english isn't the main language <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
I guess that makes sense since crunchy doesn't have the rights to SEA and instead you guys get it free on gundam info
ah, region lock
~~also the dub is already up on the "9" site under prologue~~
yeah it's on cr as episode 0 of g-witch (yeah, you switch to the dub with the tab you use to switch dubs/seasons)
also being a dub re-watch could be decent background for doing other things
if the dub cast is as good for the main cast as for the prolouge cast I might watch through the g-witch dub coming out as I wait for season 2, especially given nothing this season has caught my eye so far
well we don't know if they will start pronouncing the other lfriths that have appeared when part 2 comes around
I've always pronounced it in my head as the romanization spells it, but "el/il-frith" still sounds weird given the way I and most others I've heard (who aren't just skipping to the japanese spelling's sound) is "la-frith", "il/el-frith" still sounds weird in the dub
Yeah lol
Yeah, just checked mal. Could try and check if there are any credits on the dub itself
Enjoyed MSG, 0080, CCA (besides that one weird pronunciation in Char's speech), Thunderbolt, Unicorn, and so far SEED (original dub) dubbed
Think so far Zeta and 08th are the only gundam dubs I've tried and disliked
Yeah, most of the dubbed anime I've watched at this point have been gundam stuff.
Have you seen the glasses gear antagonist whose tf rips off gear hard(er than the rest of the show)?
I only have minimum knowledge of sentai to even get anyhting out of the parody and I just enjoyed the characters
nothing amazing, but was a nice time watching that show every week back in spring
also very supportive <:ShirabeCheer:671887003414954005>
forgot about her <:ShiraBean:736607747834904667>
I recall in the Bible Solomon's big sin was having a whole lot of wives.
I mean Shirabe was designed to be cute. <:ShirabeChibi:698939825155473499>  Actually before G came out they were sure Shirabe was going to have fans but they weren't sure about Kirika. <:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
Tbh, despite the drawn out talk with old guy about new types, I found Unicorn to do something UC often messes up, not diving into frustrating stupidity in the last half. So it has that over 0083, Zeta, and CCA.
yeah but that first link I posted was just bd (and dvd) 1 sales
and this says the lottery tickets were coming in volume 6
though maybe just that was the merch selling poorly and not the anime <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
but still kinda interesting seeing a show with decent hype sell less than a show that supposedly didn't do amazing to the point of many partners pulling out
though volume 2 without any character songs and just part 1 of the soundtrack also broke 4k disks sold
was the concert even known to be happening when gear bd 1 came out? (though yeah, had kanade's cd in it)
hold up... symphogear's bd 1 sold better back in 2012 than chainsaw man's bd 1? https://symphogear.blogspot.com/2012/04/sales.html
though the gundam one does look cooler since I like things being more angular and "armored looking"

makes me think muv-luv lol <:GenjuroLaugh:689563633516150872>
I enjoyed the full run, especially relative to most UC I've seen. Music, action, and designs were great. Enjoyed the characters on average more than any UC show except 0080 and 08th, and actually going into cycles of conflict and revenge instead of just plain "war causes suffering for everyone" and "why do we have to fight?" every other UC show usually sticks to. Also a kid Gundam protag who will put protecting others above his whining about fighting resonates better with me (also why I'm liking SEED more than most UC so far).
Never heard of that, guess it is true no one acknowledges it <:Ver:704169051391524875>
Another sequel?
I've heard base wing is even dumber with politics
The guy I watched grew up on G not Wing, and he really disliked wing but liked ew when going through gundam shows
I have seen people who disliked wing enjoy ew
I am tempted to watch endless waltz without watching wing propper
||oh yeah, the soldier scene||
thank you random japanese caller <:KirikaSalute:620069889838809089>
Speaking of her VA, always be nice to people taking your phone calls at businesses.
https://myanimelist.net/anime/6115/Lupin_III_vs_Detective_Conan?q=lupin&cat=anime
yup
The chracter Kanade's VA is most known for has crossed over with Lupin as well <:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
Oh and for season 2 and 3 they moved all the capital rewards to the free track of the pass
The balance changes and new units have been decent
Well in the winter they had a month long event that made it pretty easy to earn capital for a new unit just for playing a number of matches. And they've been doing some login rewards for tickets, so they are making some progress on free rewards
Yeah, the Dom is mainly decent because it's pretty much normal dom in the new design style. It does not stand on its own, yeah. Just look at the results of the poll/quiz gunevo did. <:Ver:704169051391524875>
windam is cool at least, and the dom remake is decent
Looks like she's making use of a classroom.
Also when it comes to things happening again ||I guess being a past friend of an officer in special vehicles means you are more likely to try and start a war.|| <:HibikiWhoops:585839808115507222>
Though given it's in the timeline of the original OVA series it is kind goofy that ||they didn't clamp down on the SDF after the last time some of them rose up.|| Though at least the guy behind it all this had more of a reason for his actions, ||being forced to be picked off as UN peacekeepers due orders not to attack||, than just being some crazy nationalist.
Got back around to Patlabor and just watched the 2nd movie. While it isn't as much of a "Patlabor" movie, going by what has been set by the OVA series and the first movie. Compared to those 2 has far less focus on the main cast and their personalities (and thus less humor blended into the action) and there isn't much looking into thoughts around how mechs and the projects they are involved with effect the world. But as it's own thing it's a very good thriller movie backed up by some impressive visuals (designs, details, animation, etc.). And still as a continuation of the OVA series and first movie, while it mainly focuses on Goto and Nagumo, it is nice to see where the crew is at after a bit of a time skip (except for the sad lack of the American gal who was always fun in the previous works). So while I think the first movie was a good encapsulation of the franchise, I think I liked the second one more as a movie.
so not just the first amv maker, but one to the end
also looks like he had been working on redoing some of his old ones
wow he made a new amv in 2020 even- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pz4hC-3MTU
a nice gundam (various uc shows/ova's/movies) one- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UWBjgHPi2lk
even the original amv maker knew highway to the danger zone went with any plane anime <:GenjuroThumbsUp:336657189475188740> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa3yuIIp3v8
here's a macross one he made were he replaced the original casssette audio with cd audio- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loA3dtaL0R4
though his channel has quite a few of his amv's (glad he preserved them online) <:KirikaSalute:620069889838809089>
sadly it seems the version of the amv on his channel has the audio muted these days <:HibikiSad:738234648509022368> - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8_doHoKAgY
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=riGfsBxcS4U
Music rights? Like why Eva on Netflix was missing some iconic music and everyone briefly complained?
from the manga his wife made
this is the man whose own wife says he measures things in merch dimensions, he is not the most smart with money lol
also gainax was pretty new back then so they might not have been fully clear on how to properly use money <:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
though I would say the fact some of the B&W stuff looks more like storyboards and animatics prob points to some cost cutting
https://youtu.be/Q39fo_mVZuI?t=1210 "based on what I've been able to find online it actually would have been easier, more cost effective, and more efficient to have stuck to color", so it might have been gainax wanting to be artsy <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
the reason I have muted channels hidden here is because of nsfw misclicks when flicking to sfw <:HibikiWhoops:585839808115507222>
while I have some nsfw art in my folders, I have that channel muted
I like my form fitting outfits, but I tend to find nipples and other sensitive parts gross
instead the movie was spending time on naked bath scene with russian chick <:HibikiTired:422925410490253313>
yeah, he himself had little time to be attached to for the audience
||the dude dying early on ||was a decent gut punch though
unless you count the old "speed racer: the movie" compilation of the speed racer dubs my first anime was witchblade in 2016
I pretty much go into every show like "I'm here for the action/comedy, but please gut punch or endear me"
also I got a lot of "Guyver" recs from some of the older anime fans there, but that got boring real quick
"Protagonist puts on sci-fi gear and fights powerful enemies with their main motivation being protecting those they care about. Then add some intrigue from the plots of secretive groups and developing relationships (friendship, family, or romantic, doesn't matter) to keep you looking forward to what's next." -dug up the thread
I pretty much threw the overlapping aspects I liked of the 3 anime I watched so far (Witchblade, Birdy the Mighty, and Gear) and asked for recs
though I first looked into it since it was one of the most common responses when I made a thread on r/anime looking for recs after watching gear and wanting more sci-fi anime
didn't know about the fight, just watched some videos reviewing/talking about talent behind it
yeah it was the first anime I got a real "this was overhyped" feeling when watching after looking for recs
oh wait, didn't skilled gal hook up with the coach?
I forgot there was romance
tbh as someone who gets easily annoyed by "main character is always whining and crying over doing their job" I didn't get super hooked into a good chunk of early on in gunbuster, I did like the movie, and the early parts had some good moments, just wasn't a favorite
been like a year since I watched
or was that later on
did the black and white scare them off?
pretty sure both of them were in the flat part of the stadium (so not in the back)
I'm going to see if I can spot Millhi's tall friend (and my symphogear argument rival <:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>) in the crowd
guess you could run an android emulator on pc <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
none of the japanese tv watching sites I've been looking through have animax on them sadly
there is an android app to watch japanese tv, you can just search the channel's japanese name in the app to watch
https://twitter.com/jhon_98G/status/1618310878952292352
Also music might be why Crunchyroll has MSG and ZZ but not Zeta
Since I swapped to gundaminfo over halfway through my watch and that's when I noticed
Pretty sure op2 was also swapped out
Also why Zeta has its ops swapped out for gundaminfo uploads
oh you picked the worse version, though now you are set up for the good sequel movie that uses this continuity as the starting point
Also OP 2 isn't as good as OP 1
Gundam SEED episodes 14+15. Please just commit to a clip show and let me skip instead of nestling in new scenes either giving conflict background (14) or character stuff (15) among full scene replays of past stuff. <:TsubasaYareYare:407397617451139073>
it was some nice hope after the sadness
(and yeah. Zettai Live decided to go full bore in making up for the emotional and character stuff the 1st movie took out of the show <:HibiMikuCry:586026583870013455>)
did you watch the post credits scene?
to be fair you won't forget the differences the 1st movie had and go "why are things this way" by doing that
though yeah, the show does a lot better on character stuff (expecially Freyja and Hayate's arcs)
true
https://twitter.com/Gundam79_bot/status/1624650309888012288 <:MikuWhoa:670502684692054042>
hey, battle royale was a Japanese thing first <:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
they pretty much did that back in CCA too, going full "appease (space) hitler and he'll calm down" of pre ww2 britain
You may not like it but you can't say 0083 is what changed things to "feds and zeon are both bad guys" for all later media, it was just one of the earlier popular versions of it being done very sloppily
Also the Antarctic treaty was pretty much a trade of both sides giving up ways of mass death, Zeon said no more colony drops, Feds said no more nukes. Zeon was just the one that made use of such things in a significant way enough for such an agreement to come about.
just saying since the start gundam has pretty much been saying "all the top tiers in a war, on both sides, are evil or corrupt"
like if you cut out the zabies and makuve the only "zeon bad" sign you're given beyond the german stylings is the brief mention of the colony drop in the intro
well if we're talking about Zeon good not about Feds bad, when watching MSG pretty much portrayed every zeon not in the top tiers of power as sympathetic and/or just normal people doing their job
again, f91, which predates 0083's start by months, has feds wanting to grab civilian kids to be human shields
eh, still feel that's more side content building off what the main content (shows and movies) were already pushing towards, making 0083 more a result than a cause
Zeta- the Tians, CCA- the feds letting Char do what he wants and leaving it to Lando Bell to save the day (after that one guy leaks what the feds did to Bright), and rewatching this F91 review reminds me F91's (which came out months before 0083) first battle has Feds trying to grab the kid protags as human shields vs the Crossbone Vangaurd until one of their dads flies in and kills the mech pilot with a torch
Like even if 0083 didn't exist, given how bad the Feds are often shown in full shows and movies Zeta onwards, unless the franchise tried to squeeze even more stories out of the OYW than they already do way too much of for a "one year" conflict we would have hit evil fed anyway
what side stuff was pre-0083? since I can't think of ova's around or older than 0083's age that's post OYW
though pre-0083 was a lot of OYW stuff, so the feds hadn't gotten that bad yet from a universe perspective
Stardust might have had a mess of a plot, but if anything Zeta from many years before is what set up the feds being bad
I'm more pushing against the whole "goes back to decisions Stardust made", feds were shown as crap in MSG, and in Zeta, which stardust are a prequel to, the main fed force was the *Titans*
eh, even MSG showed them as pretty crap (aside from white base, the supply corps, and general revel)
guess even bandai doesn't like F91 getting attention
and again, I don't think any of his other reviews do this
it's "v3", he had tried less before<:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gl2-Cm3A1c8 well this is the one time this guy had to go this far
including  pulsing "Bandai doesn't want you to see this" <:Ver:704169051391524875>
looked up a review I watched before and was reminded how agro they had to get with effects to avoid content id
Unicorn is mainly CCA and ZZ stuff
Though if we're talking like cca, things get slightly bigger
If I recall
Actually late UC gets smaller since gundam and gunpla was in a slump and they needed to save money
Gundam not that big as far as advanced war machines go <:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
Valentines has inspired me to get around to a full Macross Delta rewatch. Love the Freyja Hayate relationship progression.
ah, towards the end of cour 1
how far in are you?
86 good
cute girls and cool action, with some intrigue mixed in, what's not to like? <:KanadeWink:690470895608791040>
not lacking in shows to watch, just getting around to watching them
also given I just got into anime a year ago I have a whole backlog of old shows to go through I prob will enjoy more
for me my issues are more about not understanding when/how to enter and exit discussions (thus barely talking or not shutting up), over reading tone, and then maybe some regrets if I get too wrapped up in an argument
also, while I'm a bit socially awkward, it's not the type that would get me going "just like me" form bochi like a lot of the people who seem to really love it
oh yeah, don't doubt its well made and endearing, just not my type of show (don't really watch slice of life), also as someone who catches second hand awkwardness and embarrassment not sure I want to watch a show with a perma awkward character
tbh the only thing that interests me is what I've already seen from shared clips- the crazy animations
ah, haven't watched bocchi
guessing they have like the big hits of 2022 anime playing in a playlist
in nice little paper bags
there's not just threads left around at the end of season 1, there's also a lot of guns
only have seen the aliens become a band
only have watched the first one or two songs of it
never realized these daft punk music vids have similar character design to space battleship yamato...
though they both apparently are the dub va's for those characters in origin and doan's island, so at least modern UC has some va stability
I found it funny that in the Unicorn dub (with a completely new cast) "fake Char" full frontal sounds more like 0079 and CCA Char than real Bright sounds like Bright from 0079/CCA <:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
CCA dub is good, except Char calling the Titans "Tea-tawns" in his big speech <:HibikiWhoops:585839808115507222>
Zeta lost most of the Va's for the returning cast (and the new cast members, for both new and old characters, weren't as good as the wing/g/0079 cast, kinda flat) then they didn't bother with ZZ and just dubbed CCA with the original 0079 cast
the whole dub is on cr and blu-ray
what was? they aired all but doan's island
from my experience with MSG+CCA and what I've heard about G, Toonami did a good job with dubbing Gundam shows
though apparently even the company before bandai that made kits barely touched non-vf's with their 1/72 and 1/100 kits
sadly bandai doesn't seem to bother with kits that aren't vf's (or with delta, the enemy equivalent of a vf)
shuttle that becomes ship killing arty <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>

sadly the sdf version is still stuck as an ancient mono-color and the F/Delta version is stuck as pricey dx non-kit models
my dream macross kit is a monster though
yes, I want a high grade vf-1 or 0 and then maybe one of the vf-31's besides hayate's
oh I forget the one in frontier was also skull <:HibikiWhoops:585839808115507222>
look at this chonker
well that would be even more expensive since the vf-1 just has a full plane (with booster at that), not a cockpit, at that scale
like a Mirage or Max
huh, wonder if they'll do figures for the pilots of some of the other cockpits
Tbh it was better than the first, aside from less dangerzone
That's pretty good, also I should rewatch maverick at some point
"hey, once you become a near-monopoly we can start getting our profits then, but for now, devour everything" <:FudouEyes:672846284725682195>
though if you look at modern startups and tech companies, you don't even need the constant profit, just the "GROWGROWGROWGROW" <:HibikiTired:422925410490253313>
so if money goes down, even if still making profit, costs got to go down or investors thinking about short-term stock value will get upset, and they are the ones who technically own the company
they still make money, but that stupid expectation of publicly traded companies (or ones owned by said companies) to grow forever....
well less money, not no money
everyone started playing online games and watching streaming services when they could barely go out because of covid restrictions, companies went "cool, big growth, let's hire more so we can grow even more" then covid restrictions faded away and many people went back to irl entertainment over online
also ceo's of public companies are required by law to act in what they see as the shareholders' best interests
tech built up like the covid boom of online entertainment wouldn't fade, then it did (and yeah also inflation/recession making there be less money on the consumer end to spend)
not even anime is safe from the tech contraction
well there go all the "ash is a father" theories lol
Watching some more SEED. Really becoming even more clear they are building this around the framework of 0079 for the major non-personal beats. I am enjoying it, and it is its own thing in the details and characters, but pretty much young Ramba Ral and wife during a desert detour is making go, "oh it isn't just *starting* like 0079". <:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
tbh the only shows here I've watched are in your great or best tier, and I liked them, so can't really hate lol
https://cutepresea.tumblr.com/post/708840317640638464/chapter-19-part-1-is-up-it-starts-out-with-maria

what a roller coaster in 3 posts lol
You can look at all the raws on the wiki, but for teanslated, the fan project lost their tl after vol 1 chapter 4 or 5
https://youtu.be/X4JW-Ux7REY
And hey, I've found often I diverge in taste from the general western mecha fanbase, especially when it comes to newer entries vs "classics" (I find Macross Delta best Macross, Unicorn better than Zeta or CCA, etc.)
0079 wasn't anything amazing, and I've been enjoying seed decently more than it so far, so it not following 0079 message lead closesly might not be a bad thing. Though yeah, after Zeta and CCA I know gundam shows risk going full stupid towards the end.
Original, prefer a good english dub if I'm going through a long show
very limited viewing (and none watched I disliked) due to mainly catching up on old shows, also added in Zettai Live as it got its home release for western viewers to see was in 2021
I watched like 50 anime shows/ovas/movies last year, but most of them were from the past
This actually works really well <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
https://youtu.be/8kvH1L30HZI
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrQtsLVa504 why does a f2p horde shooter have such a banger? (I still remember being tired from staying up late to complete this story quest so I was very vulnerable to this music giving me the feels when it kicks in at the cutscene)
yeah, the All Insane Kids stuff doesn't live up to the Cryoshell stuff
fair
still amazed a band made purely to sell toys, cryoshell, made so many bangers and lived on after the toy work
also Hero is pretty good(All Insane Kids assumed to be a proto Cryoshell when lego was just starting to gather some local music industry people for bionicle music)- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxYeW8lYUBM
yeah, I mainly just listen to the Bionicle ones as I like them the most, just listening to them outside of the Bionicle context is what I was referring to
glad someone else listens to cryshell beyond just the bionicle connection it has <:MikuPraise:585839808765493249>
it's bionicle day, so listening to some Cryoshell music- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA3PXjv04os https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sc9V0jSS2d0 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NktqApbI06g
I'm seen the movie, but I've forgotten what the ost was like tbh
still wish I could find the guitar battle music from the dub of the original show
oh, I really like when the the guitar and synth comes in at the middle

yeah, not sure when I'll get to it, but frontier will probably be the next macross show I watch
also kinda surprising how much cross promo Delta and Frontier have, like the blu-ray of Zettai Live is a combo with a Frontier short film (that apparently premiered alongside Zettai Live)
haven't watched frontier yet but I have listened to a few of the songs from it, cool to see this
is this a delta song sung by the frontier singers? sounds nice <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>

should have know tbh given my many times reassembled green rahkshi from 2003 still is perfectly fine
though after I learned it was the 2007+ stuff I've gotten some used older sets over the years
too many cracks on first assembly is what made me not really buy any bionicle with my own money till the reboot with the beefed up ccbs sockets
2007 sockets onward were infamously prone to cracking, and lime green plastic was even more prone
phantoka lewa joints <:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>

though I think some artists returned for the remaster's music
think it was down to licensing, the classic graphics are pretty much a re-release of the game the music was licensed for while the remake might be seen as a new game

Glad my sister wanted me to see it after all my mecha talk
Saw the movie for the first time last night and looked up the ost right after finishing lol
https://youtu.be/1vU7XqToZso
But yeah, 1, 2, (or 3 with that ost) would come down to how much I spend on whatever main item motivates me to pay the shipping for imports.
Though kinda stupid the dark group's songs are on the ost and not the album
Debating next time I do an import if I should throw in a cd of the crossover album or the cd with the Zettai Live songs or both (given I already have the first 2 walkure cds)
Think it was right after your delta watch
Good stuff
Yeah, you posting one of the songs to music made me notice it months ago
(for some reason the only decent upload of this song on youtube is mobile game footage)

Macross spawning out of the s of stomp pop lol

Digging through old files and came across an old download of this https://youtu.be/AnMhdn0wJ4I
https://youtu.be/HlYR1qqNVoI was humming this in a dream last night, think this is the first time anime music has entered my dreams lol, hadn't even listened to it the previous days
linkin park + mecha <:HibikiFingerguns:688429715836502063> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3eOvBro0mM https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdvqUfYCyUI

yeah, while the whole show is good, those first few episodes (1-2 mini arcs) were the best
the ending with that song and how that episode tied into the last episode's gut punch made it quite the tear jerker
also <:MikuCry:688397678584791074>
