Phosssss
lmao
üçå
wixosssssssss
oof, best of luck
Mmhmm, even the small things can mean a whole lot
oof ;w;
and that you're there for them
I know  the feeling, cause I have a friend like that too. It really stings when dark days hit them so badly. Listening like Emily said is always best

Though if somedays no communication, best to just leave them a message to ask if they're alright
Hope that all made sense haha
Through many days, weeks of a number of things.

Depression is something that isn't easliy shaken off, but you prob know that. There are a number of ways you can try to shake it. 

First: Don't believe your mind on what it tries telling you in a negative way. As your mind can be your worst foe, and will tell you things that aren't true. Ignore those negative thoughts, as you're better than that.
Second: Let things out in a reasonable way. Like it's OK to cry, it's OK to feel bad. Let it out either by yourself, as we all need a mental break here or there, or through supportive friends who are there for you. Better letting it out than keeping it in. Accepting your feelings and dealing with them in a good way can help you get over them quicker.
Third: Distract yourself. Keeping your mind occupied will keep your mind away from overthinking things.

This is a number of things that I did when I wanted to over come my in and out of depression cycle. Which I have done, and haven't been depressed for almost two years now. While I know everyone's situation is different, but know this. Just coming out with it here takes a lot, you took a bold step when you could've just hid it. I'm proud of you for that. Stay strong, and keep moving forward. You'll learn to over comethings, and feel better about yourself
Its alright, listening to all of this and seeing it is bound to get you in a raging mood. So it's good to just let it out
Wtf, then fuck him
glad hes suspended
I have no clue who that is, but if they're bad then yay
Yeah, being with others really helps, along with taking my time with it all. Thanks though ‚ù§Ô∏è It's why I mainly reached out to get some ideas of how to do such
Yea, today has been a bit of a grieving stage, sleep has sorta helped that
More than likely yeah
Spoiler'd cause tw: As it's hard to take in, and wanna be careful||What's a good way or two of distracting one self after losing a pet||
Job offers are never easy to just plain accept. As one who recently got into one. Keep your head up. It‚Äôll turn out better then you might think
s3when
i cant wait
yes!
ep is out btw
oh hella
yeee I liked it too
same, that's a huge mood
friend a lot: watch smphogear pls
me: oh alright in the end

me now to another friend: watch symphogear pls

it comes full circle
Even though I enjoyed the show, i can really see all your points, and honestly agree with you on that, cause oof, that does look bad taste
Tbh, I thought the first half was pretty good, but the second half really fell flat honestly
*only 37 more eps to go*
Phos needs hugs
Oh I prob will watch it at some stage, as I'm aiming to watch a load of things, from popular shows, to not so popular, to even obscure shows
Aaaah, just I never took to watch the first season, then all of a sudden, everywhere I looked, someone was raving about it, and how good it is, and I was just like

'??? did I miss something??' phlplh
but thanks for explaining
Is it weird that I don't get the hype around the show?
Like what makes one want to watch it?
Is it the good story? twists and turns? characters?
Shirobako aaaaaaa yesss
I relate to it so much cause I worked in that kind of environment for a year
i wish there was more new game content now all cause of this server lol
me when I'm watching anime I put on hold for years
also yessss goood
one of my very first animes right there
I remember ep1 of first season being like 50mins lol
Some websites cut it into ep 0 and ep 1
saaammmee, gonna be weird for me, cause I watched s1 in one go, but now have to go week by week
Prob me too when I first started watching it lol
back in 11-13 whenever it came out
I would've watched it years ago, but like a couple of other animes, I went into a major burn out, so been playing catch up this year, watching shows I put off years ago
Can say that cause I watched it recently lol
^
Glad to see I'm not the only one who thought it wasn't much at all tbh
but have fun~
it really was
isnt it a game or something
I was just hitting a goal for me really, cause that was one show I wanted to watch like many years ago lol
lmao I watched that finally last month
already did love live
quietly adds more shows to my plan to watch list cause of all this-
hmmm, so far in terms of idol shows I've watched this year
LL((Both series)) 22/7, Budoukan
watched ZLS last year
JoJo is something I should really watch next year tbh, as all of it that it's currently up to
mmhm it is
I've been watching the series month to fit into my planned anime watch, and will be watching the movie this month tbh
I finished SAO season 1 at the end of last month, and while I did find plot holes, and there were things I didn't like, I personally didn't find it a bad show at all. Sure, had it's issues, but wasn't overall bad in my view.
I'm always under the impression for me 'Try it for yourself to see how you like' even with other's opinions within my mind. Because a show that might be deemed 'bad' could end up being your favourite show if given a chance. Never know until you try for yourself, and form your own view on it.  

But also while doing that, I don't mind, others views on it either, I could never be smart about it lol, in either sense
I don't mind it tbh, can never say I hated it though, or disliked it
I will say, I saw it a lot, but I was never really on a side per say, I tried six episodes last year, and just couldn't get into it at the time. But I'm the sort to give things a shot, and didn't want to drop it as things can get better/good as it goes along. Though I found the second half od SAO s1 better than the first half. By time I finished, didn't think it was bad as some put it out to be, nor did I find it great either, found it in the middle honestly
yes
Omf Spyce lol
Spyce is like the first anime centred server I've joined next to this one lol
thats a mood always
so they become megu-
imean
im already in that hole
Never really watched Railgun before, and why this might seem stupid to ask considering you all seem to like it, but is it worth getting into?
ü¶à
i love water themed decks, so of course love shark
oh really? its one of those types of 'movies'
I still need to watch the movie tbh
rest of it I've watched
lul
omfg kokoro
same
üëè
oh hey more that have watched it too lol
All my first shows were basically Yugioh, Pokemon, Digimon, Beyblade lol
also Cubix of all things

But also Cardcaptor Sakura
'50' animes with over 27 ep,(('50' cause load of them are same kind of series like Pokemon for example)) 10 of me them having 100+
I watch too much lmao
üëè
oh hella
Good stuff
lmao but thanks for the help all just gonna wach a ton of them next month and rest of this month
Nope
21eos in
That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm watching currently lol
I need more horror/psychological stuff for next month
ew
good on wixoss
I'm watching that too lol
its still thursday for me, so my thursdays will be that
Only liked two things in Gibiate, one was the the mc lol
been waiting for it all day
oh it finally came out
ye
goood
gooood
me: thinking these shows come out on sunday
shows: comes out on saturday instead
first ep was pretty good tbh
it was a nice opener that left a lot of interest for me
if they keep it up, should be a good show
really depends how next few eps go, if it's the same thing, then the jokes may get repetitive and will cause it to be boring, but if something else happens, it may pick up
lul
I mean, you can do basically 3 eps in an hour, so ten hours would be round 30eps, maybe little less cause it's not exactly an hour, but I can see it
good for my witch needs
tho I need to watch Strike one day
I tend to not drop anything, since I'm a completionist in a way, only things I'd consider dropping, is if say One piece, cause like over 900eps, lol fuck that 
12/13 or 24 eps? sure
I think I'm like watching around 20 things this season lol
that's on top of watching some horror themed shows this month, and my precure binge
she matured so much, i love it
ah gibiate lol, only liked two things from that series
Yea, I looked through some worsted rated ones before, hell watched a movie that was rated low on MAL
yay now I can read reactions, gpdldplsg
Really need to stop waking up late to when the eps come up lol
o h
I'd prob watch it one day, only cause it'd prob be something I could do since it's finished lol
Something I have watched this month already I mean I would again for sure lol. But I need to find a movie fitting for this month
What‚Äôs a good horror/psychological anime movie to watch
Eyyy, thats amazing
I think the only anime shows my parents know I've watched, or have glimpsed over are Yugioh, DIgimon, and Pokemon lmao
Aahh and omg
Not to, I guess make it sound weird lol when asking this
but is it strange to watch anime with your parents?
cause I doubt mine would give a shit on it in general lmao
Prob will be more fluff, both as it seems like it's going that way in terms of what story is in each eps
mood
Yea, it's why I'm keeping my mouth shut cause I have read it, and wouldn't want to spoil ti for anyone
it really is
there is 54 chaps up atm
Nana made me read the manga
and I hardly read manga lol
only things I read beforehand was uptodate with Watamote
and a bit of Swapswap
yes lol
its on every monday if anyone is keeping up with it, or wants to : D
one of my faves of the season
and i love it
yea fruit tart is very gay
Might try to read it sooner than expected
I was gonna start reading it soon too
Huh
Guess I‚Äôll look at it too
Oh
gotta stretch it ouuuuuuuuuuttt till like ep11 lol
oh
whats dis ooo:
I basically started from the first series, and working my way up, along with being caught up on Healin
that was the last one I watched, I'm currently on the next series
oh, gdsokgd, at first my mind didn't connect to that
whats this from? ooo:
||And I cannot wait to see everyone's reactions to it all, good or bad||
best of luck
here I thought watamote had a long title lol
thats a long ass title
^
soooon
I mean, I stopped watching Pokemon like think it was X/Y days, just stopped watching it all together, only watched half of Sun/Moon series, and up to date on the current one
Yugioh, digimon, Pokemon over here 
also same, never really bothered to watch Naruto, though in my case at all
Latest series will prob be finished by time I reach there lol
six series away
Yeee, I'm really enjoying it
Prob would've been further since I used to be able to binge episodes easy, but been taking my time with it
I've just been going through it from the start upwards, with up to date on the latest season, almost finished the 8th series in Suite
good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0024STgJD0&feature=youtu.be&ab_channel=WarnerBros.JapanAnime
||Tbh I think I can prob guess where it'll end, but I'm not gonna say anything of course||
hell yes
Watch 2 eps of precure a day, 4 on fri/weekend, so another 4 tomorrow, while watching the other shows I'm watching one at a time
I'll prob start em soon tbh, only got rest of Smile 14 ep, Clannad after story 10ep left to go, along with another Fate anime, and Himouto to go, all in all 75eps left
I've gotta watch those two I've mentioned, Non non, and Cells at work, only found Non non recently, and then see it's getting third season in Jan lol
already worked out what I'm gonna watch, with three shows left to add cause not sure what day they're on, hopefully not friday, cause then I'd have TEN shows on friday
I was gonna watch Promised neverland, and quintuplets at some points lol, so might as well

am caught up on dr stone and re zero though
As if I haven't saw first season of a show, prob won't watch second yet
thats me, mostly cause lot of shows next season seem to be sequels
Finished Smile Precure
now 6 eps into Dokidoki
I just have a lot of love for it cause of the characters, plus I worked in an environment like it, not anything anime related of course, but it resonates with me a lot
Aaaaa sweet
Aaaah yessss, I wish there was more Shirobako cause I loved it too
There is for sure prob enough content for a second season of Nana honestly, or least I believe so
like they prob could make a movie off the final part tbh
If they do it same way they're doing it with same ep count, I'd say two more seasons, two or three with another movie or two
You two are just making me hype for the next chapter of Nana honestly with all this talk lol
Thank you for letting me know
wait its out OOO:
Me: digimon is nice
me when I finally had net and could look at more: wait there is more digimon?!

its the same with Yugioh lol, saw a dub ep of 5ds and didn't even know there was more
Thing is with Digimon for me, cause I didn't have net for a while, and by time I did, so my memories of Digimon have mostly been dub of Adventure 01 and 02, and Tamers, did watch Frontier years later though, but p much nothing after that, besides one 3d looking movie I can't remember the name of with holy knights in it, and the current Digimon anime
reminds me I need to stop being lazy and continue reading the manga of Kuma lol
been reading that
oh hey slow loop
but still less than last
still a lot sure
it was prob close to 30 last season lol, just over 30
I've got less to watch next season, which is pretty nice, not by much but, means more chill time
M:1
T:1(3)
W:3
T:2(3?)
F:4(7)
S:4
S:3(6 three 3am shows))

even on which day the brackets are cause of on going shows, like how digimon, yugioh, precure all come very early sunday
it was real good, I can't wait to see what happens next honestly
can't believe I skipped it when it was airing
I figured I'd watch em at some point, but then Winter 2021 came round and so I had to lol
Cells, Quintuplets, and now Neverland done
Only Non non to do and I'm ready for new season in 2021 : D
Tbh, if the plot gets a lot of attention if a second season comes round, not that the plot was bad, more that it needed work in areas, but basically now that s1 has established who the characters are, the world itself in a sense, and what is what, then they could focus on diff things, and if done right, it could make the first season look better as a result if a s2 does well
Spoilers just in case: ||I just felt that like Adachi became a bit too obessive/possessive in the end, and it just made me uncomfy, hell I could see or figure it was even making Shima uneasy a little, and I just oof. Shima doesn't help matters as she doesn't tell her to calm, and just lets it happen, I get they're both awkward in their own right, and deal with their own issues/problems, sure. But it just left an uneasy taste for me, feel like they need to talk about that and work on that, idk just felt a little toxic I guess? One needs to calm down, the other needs to not allow things to just slide and happen||
I liked AdaShim but
relationship needs work lol
both of them need work on themselves, last few eps were a bit mmm, nop for me in some ways
oh god Pet
that was a weird ride lmao
I'm in love with the songs that came on it too
eyyy id
||Not sure what to say, cause it's my first time on this side of things, cause normally I don't read Manga, but Nana made me want to, but it's good, so I'd say give it a read, it'd only be just under 30 more chaps from where the show left off.||
||I sort of figured like, episode 8 or episode 7 that we were gonna end with that part, I could've said something a while back tbh gdspdgpldg||
oh nice
Finished Dokidoki episodic wise, will watch it's movie maybe tomorrow, but next is Happiness
thankie, just wanted to check in case my friends wanted to know
ahhh good good
what chap does the anime end at?
i forget
aye
lol
yeee, though I've still got one later to go
watch a few eps per day and within a few days or a week boom donew
just do what I do
lol
time to check them all
good thing you mentioned that cause I put it in my planned to watch list but its not in my notepad for some reason gdpgdsg
Been pretty good tbh, it's been enjoyable for the most part, and I'm hoping to finish the rest off before either Monday, or on Monday
I feel like this place has influenced me, mainly the gaming part lol, cause started the year off, and I've done 4 of the Digimon Tri movies now
thats it lol
I only liked one thing from gibiate, and it was the fact the mc was cute
eeeee finally finished all the Digimon Tri and it's final movie
great way to start the year
that and Princess Connect Re:dive lol
Honestly didn't see any issues with it tbh, the themes of the show made it fit
Spider is fuuuunnn
i love her already, so I'm pretty hap its getting 24 eps
5eps in Bloom into you
Really enjoying it so far
Or should I say
||Bloom into Yuu||
I was gonna say Sunday might be my fave day for this season, then I come here and remember gotta watch that too lol
Oh Ex is up too, I'll watch that in a bit lmao
But Non non was cute as always
Finished HappinessCharge, will prob watch it's movie tomorrow or this week
next up is Go! Princess
its weird, but it's that interesting kind of weird, and leaves you wanting to know more
The anime came out late 2019 though final ep was in 2020 : D
I finally finish Bloom into you, finally cause had a few lazy days of anime watching, but yee, I did like it
which I just watched, so happy is back
This place has influenced me to watch it too honestly, but I'm a break from anime films, after watching all 7 digimon movies, and happinesscharge pre cure's movie lol
this is getting a second film? ooo:
Yeee I get that feeling, it's how I feel about it tbh lol
In terms of the shows I'm watching at least, it can be enjoyable, but can't help but having that feeling while watching it
Gekidol is prob my biggest let down of the season tbh, Expected more from it, and while I understand most of it, just wasn't what I was expecting lol
Caught up to the manga a few weeks ago, which resulted in me reading the other two dragons in Monster's can't clean, and the 5000 year ol vegan dragon, so I'm pretty hype for iiitt, the colours look real great
cant wait for slime yessssssss
found it pretty eh tbh, though do love Kozakura
thanks for letting me know it was up, just watched it
Though that's prob cause I didn't really like the previous two eps, cause they made the two MCs unlikeable for me in certain ways, compared to how the first couple of eps were, did enjoy the start and the end parts of the episode however of this week
agreeed
mmhmm, gonna be enjoyable for sure
The new precure series seems good
Maybe I'll start it after I finish Akuma no Riddle
I watched a vid about it before, so figured I'd watch it at some point, so might as well start it soon
I still need to watch the first season of part timer
I mean I could guess what is going on, but a lot of things just seem thrown together lol
finished Hug tto precure, now finally at the final precure series that I need to catch up on to be fully caught up episode wise
I mean, I'd say that for a lot of shows, but in terms of the way PM did it, I'd disagree, still a good show, but yeah
Prob why it didn't make me feel anything towards it, since you knew it was coming
I'd be sad at PM, but already guessed what the ending was by like either 2nd ep honestly, so the ending didn't really make me cry
Like I have 3 on mon
tue, wed, and thursday 2
friday 3

then weekend is like: 8 on sat, 5-7 on sunday
Spring weekend 2021
most of the stuff I'm gonna watch next season is on a weekend lol
makes it ironic it's airing a decade later in same season huh
I was gonna, but forgot too, and then uhhh 12 eps go by dgspgsdlp
yesss, allllllllllllll
So started Precure from the start, on August 3rd, 2020, and now, March 2021, finally caught up on all the ep, with only like 5 movies left to watch
Currently 88 eps into Bleach, prob say I'd prob have that, MAR, and Fist done by round Summer time, or say July I bet
so prob start Gintama round then
alright, thanks all c:
I'm prob gonna do Gintama after I finish Bleach tbh, like end of  year kind
Yugioh and Pokemon lol
Retsuko's 1min 100 thing
Black Clover by tuseday
Be finishing MAR, Fist of the North star, and Sun/Moon anime soon too
Bleach is the 300 one I'm doing
Wanna ask cause want to least watch 25 100+ ep length shows
currently completed 10 100+ ep shows, with four more I know I'll be doing, but wondered if anyone has any reccomendations?
might go for under 200, as would be quicker to do, and I'm already watching one that's over 300 so lol
I'm up to date on the manga so I have to wait dgspdg
Gonna feel weird not having Black Clover next Tuseday
Finally watched Vivy and mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm good stuff
Didn't expect the first ep of Super Cub to go the way it went, but honestly enjoyed it
I'm gonna look forward to every weekend just for this
I'm so happy its finally here, loooveeee
I dunno what it is about the pace of Super Cub, but it's just super calming to me, the atmosphere is just relaxing
||Just watch today's Vivy, and I swear, she rocked all outfits today, all looked so good||
yes gdpsgpldgdlp
‚ù§Ô∏è maxed out witch
Only watched reb this year, like two months ago, and now something new pops up lol
and they include music to, which isn't an issue, just if you're looking for just the eps, its lol
I started reading the manga of that tbh
its short
