it happens
while some people had it already last night
i just got the update i think like an hour ago
so you might need to restart discord on your phone or wait for the update
it seems the feature is still being rolled out
i mean like I said, I see it on mobile too
yup
but not all of them
most of the servers I'm in have
i only mentioned it because it was a neat feature to have
yup
without being in vc
you can see the chat on mobile as well
i just checked on mobile
ok
uhh i can't really check on mobile atm

and type in it
you can look in the text chat without being in the VC
really depends on how clever the bot makers get
well can't support bots yet?
will definitely be useful during the symphogear watchtogethers
and the streaming thing happens more often than not lol
basically
it's a new feature that was revealed like 2 days ago
all good
yeah an integrated text chat
also, @ ing people in the VC chat doesn't work unless they are currently in the chat
i also just tested, bots don't work in the vc chat, as far as I can tell
yeah
it is a very cool feature though
from what I've seen of it, it's basically the same as regular text channels, and as far as I could tell, the stuff posted in the channel don't get deleted, so I assume it would end up being the same moderation as <#336298587745157120>
So I saw that a bunch of servers I am in have that new VC chat feature, and I'm wondering, will you guys let it be used in the voice chats here?
that doesn't change how true what I said is
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
don't they need to touch grass first before they can eat it?

Sapphire, a fellow code toucher
like I said, i mute every server I am in because I hate seeing the notification thing on discord. dunno if it's OCD, but it really grinds my gears.
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
don't think you're special
what, i do this with every server
i only want notifications from @'s
i have the whole server muted
i'm fine with the split too
we're bringing back the 2000s
yes
we started with forums and now we've returned to forum
we've come full circle
that's my exact feeling on it

i'd also be fine with the anime ranking stuff actually being posted in the anime club
yes
it's very bad, don't go to it and don't download
it's an xyz link with site called magicalbunny
it was a magical bunny link <@99695384296701952>

Bleach did
no
because they do great work
they need more credit
the backgrounds are really good
as a person who watched every detective conan movie
but they do some quality stuff
animation and etc
and keyframe
they do a fuckton of background work
they did stuff on Spy x Family ep 12
they've done a lot of work
https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/company.php?id=1184
Backgrounds in Most of the Detective Conan movies
they helped in Demon Slayer
Shield hero S2
oh they did 19 eps of avatar the last airbender
they work with Madhouse
ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
they did OG Death Note anime
well in this case it's just a one off thing

https://twitter.com/DiscussingFilm/status/1585025861128196096?s=20&t=tlTfCR4m9AmRqf5Ux9VLvA
but there were also a lot of newbies too
yeah a lot of them were already end game players
so far they're even on lost mons

like the previous episode ended with Dragonite taking down another of Leon's mons
yeah he ain't losing
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
this boi is pissed
look at this sheer anger
next episode is the final fight between Ash's and Leon's final mons
new pokemon aired
https://tenor.com/view/scorbunny-gif-19366526
the precious child
not after what he did to scorbunny
he doesn't deserve kindness
vindication
i'm so glad Gary motherfuckin Oak bullied his ass
but Goh in the current season I hate and hope they get rid of him soon. I'll never like him
yeah sun and moon onwards made pokemon better to watch
and barriered him to submission
just to flex
he focused punched a hariyama
mr mime is a monster
man is cracked
i'm just saying
sirfetch'd
he's got Z moves, mega evolution, dynamax, mr fish

his team is actually fire
he's been good since end of alola
ever since he won the pokemon league in Alola, he's been cracked af
not in this season
mhm
unless they end the season off just before that point, which would be pretty funny
trust
||also they do end up meeting someone relatively soon that they can't just outright beat that is an enemy also the kin summon is for something completely different, and I'm fairly certain you'll see that help part that you want to see soon enough||
||Her goal is to evolve, so that's the biggest reason for their wandering around fighting stuff||
||nah she doesn't really join any party||
it's buildin up to something interesting, trust
because that guy lost the second time
like in this season, the only person has actually lost to was Leon, with the exception of that guy with gallade doing the 1v1 against ash's farfetch'd
this is where Ash brings out the bullshit sauce sorcery that he's been cookin all season
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zTGMS3jDxV0
||peak voice acting honestly||
||The way he said "I am atomic" was such perfection in delivery that I had chills go down my spine despite how chunni the line was||

yep
Lucario is in RU
oh he is

He is now officially the strongest pokemon trainer in the pokemon anime, i never thought I would live to see this happen
he was truly built different this season

https://twitter.com/lazynico/status/1602687771256451072
he's on the top of my shitlist of bad characters in the pokemon anime
because fuck him in particular
i'm honestly glad Goh is gone
Riko and Roy
a bit hard to go higher than champion of the world tbh
i'd be fine with him actually being an adult in the new series that we see rarely
i mean, you never know

<:ChrisHehehe:688429717019426821>
like literal father
or actual dad to new protag girl
we're getting 2 new protags
like hard confirmed
no, it's actually confirmed, this is the end of Ash as the protagonist
officially
he did become the strongest pokemon trainer in the world
so it is the original visual
i don't think there was a version without togepi
ü§î
over year before gold/silver came out though
It first aired in Japan on June 25, 1998
uhh
togepi's egg showed up at ep 48 and hatched 2 eps later
because togepi was in the kanto series?
ash is finally gonna be freed from his immortal curse
and won
which he later fought again
and a 2nd one against this guy with a gallade that he 1v1'd with his farfetch'd
1 was against Leon early on
he only lost 2 fights in that season
specially in Journeys
then he moved up
at least until sun&moon and Journeys
there's not much else he can do
Ash achieved peak with this season
honestly, i'm fine with new main characters in the pokemon anime
that'd be hilarious
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3r-KAIZ8yg
trust
it's them in an alternate universe of pokemon
Gary shitting on Goh was the best part of Journeys
glad we can agree

bro was truly ready to die to protect louise

Zero no Tsukaima is also a favorite of mine. big fan of Siesta and the Queen
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
including star wars, stargate, etc
every space sci-fi is an isekai
if your point a is on planet a and your point b is not on planet a, it's an isekai. it's not that hard to grasp
in this case, it does
no because you're not leaving your planet
it's an isekai.
so by definition
nah isekai is literally leaving earth/original world to go to a different one
it's an isekai
they went to other planets too
<:Ver:704169051391524875>

but man has magic amazon prime as his skill
basically cooking isekai

shit, trash that isn't harem or ecchi doesn't exist
i've seen many that were worse than 8th son

you cannot deny that
8th son had a banger of an opening though

also banged the vampire early on

the real joke here is, Shaggy is the only one who has actually actively dated someone throughout all of the scooby doo series

for Shaggy, it just happens
there is a fine difference
Shaggy is a coward, yes, but lord has he never been a doormat.
true
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
red shirt shaggy was from the 80s
Shaggy does have excellent cardio
shaggy does somehow get all the action
based tbh
<:ChrisHehehe:688429717019426821>
and insane cardio
like it's actually cannon that shaggy has some level of combat training
he's objectively the strongest character in the scooby-dooverse
yeah also ultra instinct shaggy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEXBfRWQLWs
when he beat up the biker gang he was
nah, Shaggy wasn't ever a doormat, he was a coward, but no doormat
they turned him into a doormat.
they managed to turn Fred, the human golden retriever, into ***this***
same
this show single handedly made Scooby doo and scrappy doo a good show by comparison
they knew it would be a shitshow
I can see why they didn't allow scooby to be in this show
they absolutely destroyed everything about the scooby doo characters
that's what I want to know
https://vxtwitter.com/BurrfullyThicc/status/1613711535330697217?s=20
lord, how they massacred my boi Fred
also isekai nonbiri
and campfire cooking in another world
no, we should all watch Buddy Daddies
and that was objectively the worst entry in the scooby doo series
like Velma's writing makes Scooby Doo and Scrappy Doo's writing look like god tier peak writing
yes
because they know this would be a shitshow
because they were forbidden to use him
except scooby
they managed to massacre every member of Mystery Inc
definitely not
basically
still
Shaggy is just his nickname
Well no, Norville has always been Shaggy's name
they turned human golden retriever, Fred into as my friend called "a racist, narcissistic, daddy issues, insecure mess of a man"
da fuck I know why they did what they did
ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

with that one clip from Velma, I'm honestly not even surprised that it got a lower score than Dragonball Evolutions
not even the stronganoff song can save it
man is the embodiment of a nice guy goober
Fred can be a bit of a goofball, but he is definitely not how they portray him in Velma

TRUE
props to Fred though, he's been always only into Daphne
the fandom
honestly, best anime opening song this season
also Angel next door has a BANGER of an opening
she has 0 skill issues
https://twitter.com/kiyuri_P/status/1611999378507706368
that was a good show
that's some mad cap
magirevo is good too
yo hold up, you talking shit about angel next door?
also the angel next door spoils me rotten
also iceblade
also bofuri
because we got every flavor of webhead
you know, I think we can all agree, the IP that is truly the most inclusive will always be Spiderman

Miri is adorable
but other than the OP for Buddy Daddies, it's actually super good
probably
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
it's one of the new anime this season
buddy daddies
<:Ver:704169051391524875>

that's how I feel about every dubbed anime ever.

omnitrix failsafe 100% activates 100% of the time with that bullshit of green lantern

halloween doesn't exist in most of Germany

and ends in January
as a German, christmas starts in September
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
on this server
this is like the 3rd time I saw this
that is the biggest load of cap
anyway, my point being, the end of that death battle, green lantern doesn't win
and ya'll are downplaying Ben. Man's cracked af
Ben recreated the universe almost perfectly
green lantern does not come back from that
bro, the failsafe stopped the fucking big bang
<:ChrisMunch:688191202973319198>
so it's the opposite of XBC3
that's cap, because the MC's in XBC3 believed in humanity

Danny Phantom is a perfect example of a show that stayed good from start to end

the real GOAT though, Chalkzone
fair
I loved Rocket Power
The Wild Thornberrys was also pretty chill to watch occasionally
Ren and Stimpy was really weird
trueee
that you wouldn't know until you were an adult
they had a wild amount of adult jokes
Rocko's Modern Life was a ride on its own
CatDog, Angry Beavers, and Rugrats were great
bruh
there was a disney doug?
the opening slapped
Doug was also so good
TRUE
that and hey arnold

it was very catchy for me as a young child
i won't lie, I'm still biased to the pirate rap from one piece
it basically went downhill from there
up until like 2005, it was a good time to be a cartoon watcher
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KKmxq-9YZd0
never saw that one
i prefer the 2003 op to the 87 op
<:ChrisMunch:688191202973319198>
TMNT was 2003
the OP was a banger
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRnRUtMHGow
Static Shock was based af
TMNT back then was great
but not great
not bad
i do, it was ok
it was at least watchable
Ninja steel wasn't half as bad as megaforce
while not a cartoon, Ned‚Äôs Declassified School Survival Guide was also super good
based

chainsawman at home
is that bootleg chainsawman

i went to check the website

honestly, i wouldn't have been surprised
bruh
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
nah we already have a Latias stalking Ash since ep 1 of the final Ash eps
and that final episode was fantastic
animation was great
very good VA choices
the pacing was really good
honestly, i am very happy with how they adapted it
lmao
and Claire's VA voiced Prelati
so i just realized, Princess Iris in Eminence is voiced by Yoko Hikasa
so he isn't actually useless
he's immortal like a zombie
yeah but he has a different type of durability than Maple
ikr
np
Eminence in Shadow
really enjoy how they animated that one too
Isekai Nonbiri Nouka is doing a really good as a slice of life farming isekai anime

i'm German, good sir
I know
but lord it makes for an awkward conversation
well yeah
<:ChrisHehehe:688429717019426821>
because in german that's not what it means to an english speaker
never say mushy to a german person
üòÜ
so
in english
Mist also means a lighter version of fog
i mean
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
i think it's already in 1080p in most watchable places
the girls are usually not around him
actually not really
and they 100% chose the perfect VA for the main character
yeah
it also helps in his favor that he's OP beyond compare
it's a great laugh
he thinks it's fake, he thinks his friends (shadow garden) think it's fake, but they know it's real, and they think that he knows it's real
basically MC is spouting bullshit but it happens to be real
fair
ah
The Eminence in Shadow
<:ChrisHehehe:688429717019426821>
and the DM is pissed
think of it as the wildest DnD game you'll ever witness
which I find hilarious
everything else was amazing
like the only downside of this anime was the horses looked like shit
i know
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
