<:HibikiHi:336657249827028993> hello! Join us anywhere! The water is fine!
<:HibikiHi:336657249827028993> hello!
good job Voy
Chaos is the answer
Yes
It's always fun trying to figure out what to do with them. Maybe leave it to chance? Like make six options and roll a d6 and see what you get
It looks good, I like the character emotion as he look annoyed at his companion (?)
Awesome!
It's in the middle for plot reasons!
But was excited to find such a thing exist
Was worried about it but it's based on a Greek organization of supernatural people
Awesome!
In a good way?
I created this symbol for an faction in something I'm working on.
It's my first time working on something like this and I'm not an artist.
How does it look?
Try someone new or an idea
Exactly!
I think that might be the issue
Or maybe make it look not just staring blankly
Yeah!
Like show movement!
Add an "angle" with the face
Hmm oh i know
A beauty mark or add depth to the noise and checks?
Maybe
Like more depth or detail I assume
I assume you mean his eyes
I like his coat with the reavens
Now you peak my interest
Or uncanny as odd
Like uncanny as too real?
It's neat!
squad of 5 is 150ish
and they can cast one psychic powers a turn
two wounds, 4 plus inval, AP 2 bolters and power swords
TS terminators are amazing
kind
well
Oh yeah
Like Land Raiders with there 14 Front armor was amazing
but sometimes it's iffy
But I like how 8th anything can wound
I kind of miss armor values
Yeah
<:KirikaScared:672584678993297431>
anymore
too bad Land Raiders are not good
they are
and they do wonders
I run two in my TS for ant-tank
and they can be pretty cheap
and Predators are easy to get their hands on
True that is fair
So you can use that for *surprises*
True but they can deep strike yeah?
two units of 3 will do you wonders
You need more then two
they are gross in your legion
you need to get the new oblitz that came out in shadowspear
and Emperor's children are great
Cultists suck
what legion?
nice
If so what legion are you running?
Have you played games in 8th with them?
Very interesting collection
not bad
how big is your army Voy btw?
40k is the best
Like 30k
or flush out stuff
And CHAOS WILL WIN
Lies
Praise the gods!
Ahriman supporter
Also fuck Magnus
VENGEANCE FOR PROSPERO
I just want to kill some space dogs
You play sisters?
Oh good choice

Eww if you want to Play Xeno eldar or oaks
No where
I am that madlad who uses different spells for each unit
You think i spam smite
Lol
And nothing scream MAGIC as shooting 10 spells at people a turn
I just like MAGIC
Nice
My TS can kind of fight in said phase
Also where you khrone bereskers?
World eaters rules?
That's fair
More possessed marines? Nice!
Yes it does voy
And awesome collection Voy
I can see that
By Tuesday they might be done
I did touch ups on the titans
Very lovely Voy
Thank you Matt!
It's a demi manple for a Feriox Light Manple.
Only need 1 more warhound...or do I want me to bring in a Warbinger support titan? <:ElfneinBullying:421432763078410241>
Progress for today



I start the painting tomorrow!
Legio Crucius walk in the name of the Emperor!




They say so in a weekender
I heard Battlefleet Gothic mini game reboot is in 2021
Hence the more focus on 30k and games like 
Adeptus Titanicus
The wrap fuck up nids when enough chaos is around
Nah Chaos beats nids
40k is now the 42nd mil
Yep
And The scurring
<:MikuPraise:585839808765493249>
üëç
Thanks!
<@486087033652248576>. My titans are done








<:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
I got rest of the armor panels and touch-ups to do. But 75% done

He just a bloodletter doing blood things
?
Will be buying paints today
Skulltalker is built and his capes of skulls

Soon my friend soon
<@486087033652248576>

üëç
Still thinking if a Latin name
Athena (some Latin name suffix)
Yeah



<@64565434468282368> Wicked Gunpla
Especially those lightings
Yeah I know, hence why I am putting my painting on hold
Also those airplane models look very tempting
mechs are so cool
then start painting sometime in the week
Going to prime him today
My warbringer is fully built today
nice!
how many do you have
Nice! Your night is looking good Voy
AGE-1 Built

Nice Voy
Of my cousins
No family photos



Thanks




Office lamp
It's like 10 years old
Lamp Matt

Yep
A lamp?
Voy is 100% best boy
Well Voy creates great things
Oh
Why be shy?
<@486087033652248576> this is lit
üëç üëç
Pick It up
I have onlt built AGE-1 Gundam
Coolo
üëç üëç
Ikxi your computer thing is great too
Voy your knight is looking great
Only first layers for armor panels
The painting has started

Don't be angry
Oh?
üòâ
It's just in 8mm
I do have an Admech Titan Legio army
Woot
Also I get start painting my Warbinger today
Yeah it's crazy
Also nice Dark Eldar kits
That's a good sign
Nice
Amazing
amazing
That sounds right.
Hoping to start painting my titan over the weekend
The knight is coming out fine Voy!
true and I am in no hurry
or I could just go rage and play Khorne
I don't have to worry about shooting or psychic phase
and I kind only played tau for a little while.
but I played Eldar in 5th edition and loved them
I know
Haven't decided
Or Tau
I am thinking of playing Craftworlds
Lol
I'm doing them for my titan now and I hate it
Trimms suck
Very smooth color scheme
cute!
Claire is cool and nice pick!
Good job Matt!
10/10
Love the color one
<@84811738653929472> very cute pic!
Did it load now?
Day two progress on Adeptus Titianicus Warbringer




<@84811738653929472> Great drawings!
it makes me never want to play human armies again
Ah Dark Elder Warriors
and yes Voy
Warhammer 40k
the trimming for the titans for example was a bitch
like it takes such a long time
Space Marine and imperials armour sucks
And become one with the darkside!
Continue more!
Good good!
<:MikuPraise:585839808765493249>
<:KirikaWink:689564310908960900>
Looking good there Voy!
Warbringer getting closer to being done.
Ordered a smaller brush for touch up
Glue got messed up so like some armor can't be glue on yet




That actually make sense cause your not holding something really tight.
That is pretty true
Well Matt, your artwork is great!
Yeah I have white on my titans, and it's a pain to put in layers.
I like it
You ran out of white paint? that's rough
Please do
I have the same problem
yeah
like one of the best ones
Talos are very good DE units
<:MikuPraise:585839808765493249>
so it's easier to put them into boxes
at least devilfish are smooth
they really are hard to move around and not in a good way
like moving helldrakes and Defilers suck
Yeah and all the damn spikes
I will if I can sell TS
but still thinking about $$$
like I am set on Tau
But I am still thinking if I want to invest into the army
Yeah they are really mean
plus Carde Fireblades
and get all my dudes and crisis suits
I get to save like 20 to 30 bucks on that way
mostly likely three
hence why I probably going to be picking up at least two of those
yeah
yeah you will need a bigger one
and Ghostkneels are 65?
A broadside are 50 a pop
also why are Tau battlesuits so pricey?
Ah, still go for pain engines
you can do a lot of stuff with them
But Pain engines are really good
scourges are okay
Pain engines
ewwww
get those instead
Talos Pain Engine are very good
why are incubi so pricey?
Ouch
Voy keep pumping out those DE, who knows you might have a fully painted army by May!~
which is cool
<:MikuPraise:585839808765493249>
with a chinese mythology theme
aka Elf monk warriors
I want to play the good version
yep
They are like evil elf pirates
Yeah!
Have you not seen the pictures I posted a while back?
And there two flak guns on top too
apparently it's for  the aiming crew?
Where the giant gun is
Yep on the top
Ah I need it for my titan though
did you know Warbrings have mini stairs on them?
Yeah I am going to use it for trim control and other super small details
brush head is super small
Talking about painting I just got my new insane detail army painter brush in the mail yesterday day.
Voy your warriors look amazing!
Good job building
I highly suggest at least picking up two
Nichijou rocks btw
Nice picture!
Yellow one looks cool
üëç
Problem solved
Lol
Always Craftworlds
Craftworlds
Very nice Voy, very nice
more more!
yes yes
but see the AA flak guns?
note not mine
I am expecting battle reports
yessss.
Yes I know, it just dumb
what's up with Geedubes and their dumb platforms lately
He needs to be off his dumb platform
that's really cool not going to lie
I getting the set Khrone and Slansesh set.
I can't wait to show my Chaos Demons once the GW store opens up
Looking amazing
Look at you Voy!

<:MikuPraise:585839808765493249>

Thanks! I believe the scale is 1/200th
Brown = Bf109 E
Teal = Spitfire Mark 2
White = Zero
Silver = P52 Mustang



I like it
Nice!
No...I just bad at the humor
It's a double price increase
A dollar for each half!
Cause there two of them!
lol random two dollars?
40 dollar for a kit? Hmm not bad
how bad was the damage?
make sense
Nice job NEP!

No, this helps a lot.
Didn't even think of eyestrain
Like the lighting isn't the best
Hmm, I don't paint in the best area
Maybe I should cut that in half. Hmm, maybe should start wearing one of those masks
I general do paint for periods of two hours give or take
Eyestrain?
<@!486087033652248576>  I don't know if this is the right place to ask. But like I get headaches a lot during and after painting. Do you have any advice?
natural grown green peppers of some kind
Purple Sister!

Second outfit for rpg character
Instead on your fancy other kits
I mean if you want to customize them even more or just try new things out
Must be fun to paint those
But yeah they look pretty good for cheap dudes
Which does make sense, thanks for answering my question! I was not too sure due to their cheap price.
<@!64565434468282368> how are the 30 mins mission models? They do look pretty fun to mess around with
Looking nice

Ah, sorry guys. I make sure to include the source for now on. I just assume Shirabe would find it. <:HibikiWhoops:585839808115507222>
I'm pretty sure i got it on Pinterest somewhere.
I just thought of it as an art piece to shown he's move on from being a rider cause the world does not need him anymore. Like the pic is a empty build suit left to mother nature.

Both?
<:HibikiWow:614268629952757760>
Like for real?
They do?
Yes! Thank you Melua for the name!
Probability why UC is such a sadfest
Actually, gundam is quite political if you think about it.
UC touch military-grade complex with that one company on the moon and Gundam Seed Destiny does the same with logia bit worse.
Like classism and capitalism is a minor issue touch in gundam
Oh yeah
That's what they do in Gundam UC and CE.
All the poor people get sent into space to work in factories
Sounds right
But like uncontrolled capitalism sucks
Well its betrer than most things
No it sucks
To force the common person to pay more cause it's called Apple or samsong or whatever
Our how they gouge prices due to brand names?
So like cheap labor laws and poor working conditions?
Omg that's huge
Plz do
How long is it?
Huh
I hope it folds at that height
That's huge
Wowzzers
Maybe in a couple of years?
Yeah it's too new of a thing yet.
<:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456> yeah and not cost a grand.
Like as a desk weight, or a origami pet and many other things
Like you can use it for a lot of things.
And looking cool
For folding duh
<:HibikiWow:614268629952757760> that would be AMAZING
<:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616> how will it fit in my pocket though?!!?
Well duh phones are small. But like you know small keyboards suck.
It's such a problem. Why phone keyboard so small? I have a big hands and its always an issue
Sorry for the misspell, on the phone with huge thumbs
Fair, thank you for sharing some more insight into this Melua and Rakhai09.
So queer is another term for homosexual now and not a slur?
And like gender identity = what gender you are
And sexuality = who you like
Yeah?
Yeah like at lunch sometimes based on mu activity I feel like I'm starving. But I think that's my blood sugar levels
Just a bagel with PB
I need it for low blood sugar though
I'm deleted now
I like mornings...
Why?
I have a bagel with peanut butter or hummus
I don't know how you people skip breakfast. I'm like dead if I do
Food great
You should eat
Lol what Agamine?
Which make sense, classical Marxist/neo-marxists is quite different compared to Leninists.
Ah I see, so traditional weariness to new things and only doing new things you know that wouldn't blow up in your face.
Wouldn't have thought that.
Huh, that's really interesting to know.
<:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
Yeah which it will work. Just giving a warning based on my experience
Well from my experience at least
It can but you have to be careful not using that type of mind-set too much. It can wear on the mind and carry over to your regular mindset.
<@!238855496797257729> Thats a huge milestone! Congrats!
Fair, I can understand that. How much are you trying to lose?
*dieting* why do that you yourself?
That's great to hear Fizzy!
I just hope you can find something that help you or make you happy.
Ah I see.
I'm sorry, I don't know how else to help other then give examples that worked for me.
I'm sorry
I had to move very from my hometown for reason. The first year was hard but it was worth it in the end.
It's hard moving to another place far from what you used to.
And sometimes that all you can try for.
But it will at least give you a fresh start
No it will not
So what can you do?
 Can you move out?
 Escape to a different place?
Because you have to be true to yourself and ignore or reject these people opinion.
I'm sorry, I know this isn't the best advice or if you can really trust this.
After all this is a online discourse
That is horrid and unfair.
No one deserve such a thing.
How do you deal with this?
How to you play pretend with these people?
True humans are social creatures and we do need contact with other.
I'm sorry to hear that Fluffeh Aria
That's not fair, everyone deserve a chance to be love and treasure by someone. Even if its jist a friend, family, or a lover.
If those people say such things, ignore them and don't let the bring you down.
If you do, you can only drown in despair.
We can talk and chat but in the end can you afford to trust people here or in real life?
It's always takes a first step and sometimes it okay not to reach out.
There nothing wrong with that.
We are just random people online
...what do you want to do? Do you want to be a monster? If not then stay strong, I will admit I am new here and well i do tend to look at the brighter side. But I want to believe everyone has chance to be happy. 
It's hard to trust people, it really is hard. Especially after being betrayed or abused.
Which is fair and not wrong.
My current group has some issue but we were able to work it out at least.
Ouch, that bad?
I'm sorry to hear that Fluffeh Aria.
That's one of the most important things for RPing. Cause it's a very in-depth of interaction and if you don't respect each other someone feelings will get hurt.
It's pretty fun but it really depends on what group you are a part of and if they are role-playing or roll-playing.
One is like in character
The other is just playing a game 
Both can be fun but it depends on group dynamics
<:HibikiWhat:336656482907193344>
? Something wrong with RP? <:HibikiWhat:336656482907193344>
Nice! That's my plan for Saturday. Tomorrow is RP group night
Well thank you for sharing, I know it could be awkward to open to random people. But hey, we are more than willing to listen. <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456> 
I hope you day been good too!
Sometime just having a safe space to vent or talk is more like a miracle. People have to talk and let things go, you know.
That's a very award position, I feel for you man. At least you have somewhere safe to vent without fear of attack or harassment.
Which does work a lot but that can also be hard. There only so many people your can truly trust in life. And some people aren't even luck to get one.
I feel that
Oh? What happen?
*oh my*
That is dedication, symphogear is like the first anime I seen since Sept of last year
Ah I see, thats this season anime right?
That bad?
What are you watching?
Thank you all for your support
^<:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
But still need to vent
And he does have a past issue of making events between me and him into something bigger. Like inviting his new family over and stuff like that.
Like when I said no, i felt kind of guilty about it.
But after seeing first eps of GX i feel a lot better now
He's a very complicated man and not in a good way
The not at all one
Yes
<:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
Well just thank you for listening to me and if I'm doing something inappropriate for the section I do apologize in advance. I just wanted somewhere to vent that's just not family members or my RL friends.
Thank you
You know it feelings "trapping" I guess and then he does the whole guilty thing of "oh I'm all sad now and I was really looking foward to spending time with you".
And like I didn't want to cancel but he wouldn't budge about shorting the hours he wanted to spend.
Like I actually wanted spend time with him but I think it's unfair when he knows I dont have a car (and he was going to pick me up) and decided to "chain" me the whole day.
Like I'm happy he cares about me but
But at the same time I have my own responsibilities I have to get done and I feel trapped that he knew I had these responsibilities but then changed the plans on Me on the last second to make it a whole day thing instead of just a couple hours
So I had a cancel with him and he was very saddened by it
You only said this was going to be for a couple hours not a whole day thing
So today when I you know call them to ask to confirm the about it. He makes this thing that was at the most maybe from 9 to 4 something until 10pm.
And I'm like wait I can't do that
So I agree to go meet with him for a couple of hours just to spend time. However he knows beforehand that I am also taking care of some animals for my mother. Because she's out for the weekend.
Like tomorrow he wanted me to spend some time with him for a couple hours. You know go to a local place like a mall or something and just hang out. Originally I told him yes because I wanted to spend time with him.
For all the things he's done to me and all the issues we've had he still my dad and he still cares for me.
Well I have mixed feelings for the man.
He's done some terrible things to me mentally but I still care
Okay so I have an Rocky relationship with my dad and like I do love him but he always complicates things
So we can just vent here yeah?
What's loli core?
Oh yeah that was pretty neat with overlords
^I feel that
Like I realized Bikki had the same VA as madoka pretty fast but other then that it's iffy
And second that's creepy as heck
Like eww first off
That is weird as hell
And people go all you're not a fan cuz you don't know their names
I'm terrible with names so I don't remember VA at all
It's not in person and you can't assume based on tone or face motions
But in the end that all you can do really on the web though.
That would help
communiction is a huge thing of relationship and friendship
blocking communication is not frienship
Like you have friends the next town over but they never want to visit cause you don't have a car or something.
honesty is one of the most important thing in any relationship but I get what Aria is talking about
people at our core are selfish and it's hard for them to overcome it
And that is also a hard thing
So in the end I guess it comes down if you trust someone
same mostly for me
true, and if you hangout of them too. I can see that
No one wants to be rejected
yeah, and it's hard to ask someone if you are friends because of the fear of rejection
or in RL?
Because of the nature of online?
That would make sense
that is a good question how do online person goes from stranger to friend?
I guess if you ask to be their friend with a request?
I like being at home and shit
Also, is it bad to be a homebody?
Then I want to stay inside
Fresh air is okay unless it's super hot
üòÑ
I wish you luck!
Skirts are cute
Bonds should be mutal with each other. That's the point of them! You can't force them or basis them just on bloodline
But that's not how bonds works.
I do not wish death on my father, but I would be more then happy for him to leave my life or move to another state like he is always talking about
What does make that so speical just due to random chance of birth?
then just blood?
But shouldn't I care more about the people I actually have bond with them.
Blood ties is a toughy, I have issues with my dad and his whole family. But people keep telling me I have to respect them cause we are tied in blood.
^same with the family
but like 70% freetime I like staying home
like I do get fresh air
like after a couple days at home, I willl go out for a couple of hours
I feel that
and that hard with no car
I live the suburb life
like the nearest mall is like two hour walk from my house
I don't have a car so, I car pool with people
Plus outside is $$$ people want to go out and spend money.
I rather hangout with friends or stay home
Same!
<@!87512939107450880> thank ya!
and sometime hangout with friends
like work and school
Oh I do
homebody is a person who likes stay home over the weekend
ah, maybe they were unsure about you and scot at the sametime? So they wanted nothing to do with it
they don't want to get involve and they are going with the flow.
<@!83626774000308224> that messed up that they just threw you out like that
to be overly careful in dealing with a person or situation because they get angry or offended very easily; to try very hard not to upset someone or something.
that's just bad
same
that's messed up
we are here for yea
I like it
anyways back to homebody
rapiers are quite awakard
rapier with buckers or sabers with buckers is top tier fun
Also buckers are fun to use!
Like histrocal 1600 italy style is very different then it's Engilsh verison
It is and it depends on what combat style you use
I grew up in a house that had drunks
it does not work
true, my apolizges
ah, true. but it might make you feel better at least or something.
But it is your decision in the end Aria
if you are comfort with such things
do you want to talk about it?
Through PM or other ways?
just somewhere to belong
oh well, I hope you can find one play at least
ah
huh
really?
becaues people always seem themselves in a better light most of the time then they actually are
hmm, it sounds like you only had one true friend in that group
if you don't mind me talking about
okay and what did you guys talk about?
Yes, people are always their own worst enemies
like just thinking to oneself?
Have you had any contact with them since then?
Oh? now that sounds like a plot. And that is what it sounds like
maybe pump yourself about how important that test is?
roger
do you need it for test then?
But working is nice, getting your money is amazing tbh
23 year old grad student here
ah, I got ya
like a job interview
but maybe use it when you really need it?
that is true
sometime conintue to repeat as a mantra helps
I like focusing on songs or poems I like
yeah!, I hope it works!
like swapping it to a song you like or something
maybe try to change your thought process when it's getting dark?
my bad Aria
and I apologize once more
I overstep there
that is true
I am sorry
<provided>
‚ù§Ô∏è
ooohhhhüëç
ummm
oh
aww, that's sweet! You guys are good friends! <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
You should
Yep!
Go do it! and have fun!
100% support
Aria just wants to be friends with Aya!
oh that is a interesting way of looking at it
Yeah I can agree with that
thank goodness
so she should be safe
cause by law they have to report that type of stuff
oh that is good! That's really
ah, and you can't just ask for that
just in case
could you contact the police for them?
wil he?
and yes, it's one of the most horrid thing
oh no
because they can say anything without fear of true confrontation
<:HibikiHi:336657249827028993>
exactly
FIGHT!
<:HibikiScreech:633468460030230548>
standard format?
how big?
ah that sounds like some motivation
hmm, what do you suggest radyjko
ah, yeah
but not over pump yourself due to stress
The trio being bullies were okay I guess
But Miku? That went too far but that been covered here enough
Miku was too much
Argeed
But I felt most of bikki were spot on
Miku were
Yeah
Bikki were great with how you could tell her emotions
It was very impressive how they did face motions.
@<@238855496797257729> exactly! I was hoping would point that out.
I don't think anyone arguing that Discordgear is not high quality. But the content of the material is in question. Like you can have amazingly produced movie but it still have a trash plot.
If anyone else have any clue about this please don't be afraid to ping me
Well thanks for the advice guys <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
That's what I was thinking cause HA is more like a website to find people for contract work and they HA to house their aids
Was just asking if anyone knew if HA would refund or give people credit for stuff like this
Not yet, waa going to do so after work today
Had a lawn service and recently they been banned from Home advisor (HA) and wasnt notified of it. So I paid them, lawn company like normal and they never showed up and I been trying to get in contact with them. So i check today on HA to seen them now banned
Like out of $90 bucks
I think I got scammed for a service and was wondering if I could get a refund from them
Like the website?
Any of you guys use home adviser?
Same it's not right at all
I made my choice and he made his
Yeah, I'm not going to respond back to it.
I have my own respect for myself I need to stand up for me. And not let him do that
Yeah, and the funny thing one of the people I text just told me the same thing. Thanks Dex, I feel a little better
Awesome
This is what I for being honest
Just wow
Wow
"Don't worry I'll never ask you to stay over this house again"
Got his response
<@189146272865845248> thank you
and now he's complaining how I am hurting his feelings by saying no
that's messed up
like the fuck
and now he's trying to get me to stay over but kicking one of his step-daughters out of her room to sleep with her sister
he always mention how he wants to move to another state and I pray he does.
and like a super toxic influence in my life
like he's really needy and always complaining about his life
our relationship boils down to, once in a couple of months we hangout for a day and then I don't see him for another month or two.
Yeah its how I always feel about it
Just a quick ~~final~~ vent. 

My dad just asked if I wanted to sleep over his house. I told him no, because He has a roommate I never meet.  If I did stay over I would be sleeping in the living room out in the open, with this stranger in the next room over. To me that's like super uncomfortable and I can't just do that. Like it would be different if this roommate was instead a person who lived in a different apartment or something. But in the very same house and right next to my sleeping body? Hell no, I the type of person who locks his door when he goes to sleep.  The whole reason behind this is that he wants me to stay over so he doesn't have to pick me up tomorrow for the thing he was me to do with him. Which I don't know why it's a problem, I only live at MAX 20 mins away from him.  
Second time he asked about it and the second time I told him this.
It just like anytime he wants to hangout with me I feel "trapped" when he wants me to come-over to his house. 

Thanks for reading, I do appreciate it.
A long as you focus that you're having fun in yourself let everything else go
<@302063351767498752> if you're having fun just focus on that feeling
I guess it's the most positive a nihilist can have
Oh that would make sense, but that's still a way to look at it.
It's something that happens but you can still br a positive person and look at the world kindly.
Depression can effect anyone no matter there outlook
Yep
I'm here for you
Hit me
My apologies
Ah my bad
That would be messed up but I don't know what to expect
Maybe Basa just pretend Bikki is Kanade? And like ignores reality?
That would be interesting to see
Or basa and Bikki getting along
I just don't want Trump to win again. But I think no matter who gets the Democratic nominee its going to be a tough fight for them.
Gotcha
Poland
If so I can agree
US?
I thought it was just bad
How?
Us = brainwashing
Why do people complain about USA schools again?
They seem complicated
Yeah
Are you okay?
I must have missed that. My apologize
With the professional talking to their mom?
Maybe do to them being a professional would at least make her kind of believe or something
I see, but it doesnt hurt to try though
Would that help?
What about getting your professional talking to her over the phone about it?
Correct
So she can understand truly?
That's not how depression works.
Does she know anything about it? Maybe you can get your doctor to talk to her about it and it really means?
If anything she projecting something on ya
That has nothing to do with you
How is that your fault?
How so?
Ouch that's fickening rough
Nah its fair
Yeah that's bizzare
Check to see if they are okay
Yeah that's weird your child more important dude
That's just not good
Wow
<:MikuBliss:336657233712513024>
^I feel that Dex, so many of my friends are in that situation
Why?
Nice
Huh we all have our weakness
I was going to be an elementary school teacher but well, men aren't like there (and the pay sucked)
And you have to judge one that
It does but sometimes there situations were you only have first contact
Cause it's in the mainstream conscience for a lot of Nations
Ah 
Well I think for a bit
Well here is serious discussion continue my friend
We are all passionate about something
It's like Ayamine just get into weird situations
Like you have told me way too much information
Or just stop telling me things
Please just let me wallow in peace
Why are you telling me this?
Like this is my manger
I feel I I'm a part of it to my disgust and dismay
Like she has told me so much things about her life and family
<:TsubasaDisgust:349013662775902209>
Now she talking to me about her pregnant Step-daughter and how she needs the "d" to give birth.
Like I don't even ask they just go
It's a pain
Like I try to be friendly but her and all my coworkers just assault me with their worries
Yeah
Please have mercy
And make my 8.56 USD an hour
Just please let me work my 8-hour shift in place
Just unload their all there unwanted verbage at me in person.
When your a part-time worker and your boss is going on a rant about people being gay and trans.
And I'm just sitting working and doing my minimum wage.
And she going on a mega rant.
Why do people always do this to me.
That a very good reason to follow such a career, I wish you luck in it.
Oh? How so?
And make sure we enjoy such an experience!
Maybe? I has been diagnosed with a minor version of it
I got 7 hours of sleep
Do you guys just every wake-up and wonder what's the point. Like what are doing with your life? And questioning the point of everything? And how its all a mistake? I know its just a mood or something but it hurts feeling that instead of each day being something special it's a mistake or all the hardwork you put into school or something was a mistake.
It's just my doubts and well I know i can just vent here so thanks.
They will once they lose again
~~god save us~~
So get ready for 4 more years of Trump then
Yep
And will lose badly
If Biden the chosen, the democrats just lose
They win elections?
*Shadow inc*
Made by a company called
A mobile app
Yes
The whole US voting system needs to be redo badly
No by MMA champion fights
üëç freedom
For real?
Omg
Who found the app
I thought that was a meme
They actually voted to jeb
Yes
It's from PM with a friend
I had other stuff that I didn't want to share
But it's still a problem, so should I get HR involed?
I have
Is this some form of harassment or something? Like can i report her?
I really don't want to hear about her sex life at work.
I'm just a part time worker
But lile my manger is making very uncomfortable with her sharing of her personal life.
I posted this in another group

Which should have been tested before this
Yes
This stuff should be tested months ago before Iowa
True but at the same time they should not br using new voting tech in this time and place
What's wrong with paper votes?
But the reporting shouldn't be a app program either
Ah my bad
I'm moving heavy shipping box btw
Im getting paid 8.56 an hour. I would love 10 or more
I get paid  minimum wage and I live in Florida and is not enough.
Better then Trump
Pick the guy that people want! Why is that hard?
They just want to get rid of Trump. Just go and do it it Democrats.
Which is bizzare
I am just amazed.
Democrats you have Berine as a popular figure. Just let him win if you want to beat Trump. Oh my goodness!
if Bernie does get to Trump he might win.
And the DNC are fools.
Berne is their best chance for victory.
They need get over themselves and figure out if they want another 4 years of Trump or not
It still has not decide yet?
Huh so it's still 50/50
I have wrote multiple papers on it
I know
I never understood it
Like why leave the EU?
Like I am amazed people haven't tried to cancel it.
Its about how Canada has a free trade agreement thing with EU 
And EU Is like no UK. No deal like Canada.

Oh yeah
Ah I am reading it now
Article title on BBC
Michel barnier: UK can't have Canada trade deal with EU
It was on the BBC news yesterday
Is that gone?
The special trade deal with Canada that the UK wanted?
And what happen with that trade deal with Canada btw
Breexit is just getting worse
Yeah that's a mess
Which I believe Berne will usher in at least.
And a fresh one
I am more independent then either party. But the country needs change
Agreed
I have the exact same view of her as you then.
Ah
<:HibikiWhat:336656482907193344>
How do you feel about Warren?
She will not win
Haha
Still Bernie doing very good in the polls though. He had 39% according to BBC
And I want neither to win
They are both rich men who think they can win
With Berne?
That is true but Trump had his comment against such people.
But moving on
Who's a lot less crazed individual then Trump though.
I don't believe it
Democrats would have not accept him.
No way
One of the many downside of social media
Yes that is a serious issue
Yep
True but that why you seek professional help once you realize you have an issue
True but once you do self diagnoses I would suggest check with a professional before announcing it on FB
Link?
For real?
What the hell
^agree
Ah your right.
I remember
What happen in your case?
Thanks
They are not cruel people but forgetful ones.
And it *hurts*
Only noticed when I do visit but otherwise just left behind like always.
I mean some are reaching out asking in left the group chats and stuff.
But I wonder if they only noticed that I even left or was it due to the notice you get one someone does..
Yes I do.
I am not doing this as a cry for attention but like I'm just fed up.
I'm just tired of being forgotten.
More and more as the years passed bye
Yes
Nah Saturday 
But they all plan to be somewhere else already.
And I was forgotten again
Like our friend group was so close we used to throw birthday parties for the seven of us every year.
But they have forgotten mine for the third time in a row.
Yeah one in RL and some people on discord
But i couldn't take it anymore
Yeah, but it hurts like hell
Multiple of times
I barely moved away from them.
Like an hour at the most
But it felt like I was thrown away
Since I wasn't close anymore
I wasn't *fun* enough
But they always forgot me, no matter how much I reached out.
I was just...Nothing to them.
I have decided to cut ties with them completely It's been an issue I had with them but this week was the last straw.
They are not bad people.
I had a group of friends I have known for years just shy of a decade off.
I had decide to do a hard thing today
True but we have to try at least
We need to spend it well
It is
We only got one chance at this life
Cause your body is important so treat it well
It never hurts to ask questions or get tested before doing such things with people.
Also learn about sex protection against STD before you get inmate with someone.
True, I agree with you fully Shemmy
I think Marriage can work but only in case were people are actually trying to make it work and in love with each other.
As someone who came from a divorce household I do know marriage isn't perfect but it does work for people. I have seen it.
Personally would I get married?
Possibility not but that's due to my own issues but not about marriage per say.
üëç
Stay strong
Its good to hear they are giving people two weeks of paid time off
Ah that make sense.
Well I wish you luck Melua
Thanks though
I guess Google news feeds needs to be faster.
Oh wow
How embarrassing and disgusting
Article is not professional but Gamestop official guidelines in the article damn them all the same.
https://www.ccn.com/gamestop-management-needs-to-be-prosecuted-for-trying-to-profit-from-coronavirus/
On the bases of economics
Voy I'm in a GW discord

Bandai is multi-media company
Like wut
And debaseing my own argument
They call me a hypocrite
Due what they sell
And then when I argue its cause Bandai id a very different company
And they are telling me that Bandai makes more money cause its cheaper
Exactly
When they dont live in AUs
They are defending AUS prices
Exactly
Holy hell
These people have no idea what economics are
Thankfully
In cases or death?
Also hi Cypher
Not Cypher in Italy
Ugh my country doesn't understand at all
Wow can't even give them tents
so everyone can understand your message and point
I think...you might need to describe why you are posting things with video links.
Exactly
No you have the right to be annoyed. Kaiyo is important to ya and this person was just being a dick
I mean it true at that case
üëç
Yeah, that sounds like some issues they have to work with
I would be pretty muffled about it too
oh yeah that exactly how that sounds like
what does it matter if people know you watch it
Like its just a form of entertainment
huh yeah that's kind of spineless
So what's going on persay
Well it's good your okay at least
Who is she?
Thats how its is in the states
And if they feel their patinets might hurt people with a violent crimes
Counselors? Suicide

Ah okay
what's going on?
what a scumbag
Emotional manipulation
Exactly
Do not let them drag you down Kaiyo
This is emotional manipulation
oh they vented to your friend about?
Well if they are suicidal its frankkly not your fault
they suck
block them
<:HibikiHug:620080558462205956>
I mean I know its the first week of july but its there in the back of my mind. You know?
Cause there no point working a part-time job if I get my 78 year old grandma sick.
And I live with my grandma, so I wondering what to do for bit. I don't want to take loans out but if things get worse I might have to for school and just in case.
But, as a college student if I get work it work be a part-time job somewhere.
Thankfully my mom works a job that doesn't require contact
yeah, I am getting more worried about it.
<:HibikiHug:620080558462205956>
But I think overall its been alright, leaning more to good.
Was everything perfect? No
For me, the past is something I use to do better in life. I want to live life with no regrets so I use the actions of the past to think and ponder.  To use what has happen to effect what will be.
Are you okay Cocoa?
it is saddening
This whole crisis shows how dumb my country can be
yeahhh its kind of dumb move
<:ShirabeWeep:701475635025019000>
I really really pray he loses it
I pray he lose this election
Your shitting me
please
Like are you fucking serious?
My head hurts
https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-53429800
Yeah, well at least its not Covid-19
She is sick with Pneumonia
So that's good news at least
Right so my Grandma is sick but not with Covid-19
Thank you
Thank you
At the hospital waiting outside for news
I am worried
I am going to the hospital with my Grandma.
<:HibikiHug:620080558462205956>
I will check my pilot book
Give me a couple of minutes or so
For?
And I have a master in Information Science
And it was easier to planes measures and stuff like that.
Like I mention, I am training to be a pilot. So if the official engineering is saying something different. Then that's what matters.
Oh is that the reason? As part of my pilot course they said it was used for showing the difference between airspaces
I see.
Well come back to me when you actually know the reasons why some science still use the imperial system.
Other this bias report.
Have a good day.
So you pull your source from a website that calls itself "metricaionmatters"
Do you have an official scientifical journal proof?
Or only this bias report?
What is your proof?
Please post your sources why you think that is the case.
Yes that might be the case in another century or two
Due to geographic latitude and the measurement of time
The knot is a non-SI unit. The knot is used in meteorology, and in maritime and air navigation.
Also all speed for ships for examples are in Knots which is imperial.
We use imperial system for height and vertical measures for a *lot* of reasons.
...As someone who is training a to be a pilot you are wrong.
Imperial will not die due to how expensive it would be to replace it and all the education training it will take to switch to the metric system. Also some fields like Aeronautical and Maritime professions uses the imperial systems for good reasons.
I think one of the most important factors people do have to think about in regards to the bible and history
Is that people of older time were different, they did *not* have the same morals that we do and was living in a much darker world.
Now the protestant reformation is a good
And what those people did back then was evil to our eyes and you can't defend it morale
But at the same time society, people, and what was considered good and evil was different.
Yes, we can judge it as evil. Yes we can.
But at the sametime we also have to understand that that time was pretty much a different world culturally and socially
they pretty much have to film the next series half-way through the current one
I mean the yearly thing is tough to do
You are not wrong
Sentai is well, not my cup of tea though
I really really like Kamen Rider Build
Fair
The live action was good but I can see why you think it has too much edge
The anime is really good though
Garo is good
<looks at all 20 series of Kamen Riders I have download illegal>
I don't have a problem
the struggle is real
Same
Also is yuuki yuuna wa yuusha de aru a good series? I'm thinking of watching it after symphogear
Still I think the second option sounds better
That was a fun ride
Monster musume is good. I read the manga to the point right after Mia mom arc
Just looked it up. Interesting premise, seem like trashy good fun
Monster girls have grown a lot in popularity in the last couple of years
sleep tight!
It was nice talking to yea!
<:HibikiWow:614268629952757760> <bows downs> I am not worthy
I cheesed her
but everyone else?
I did beat her fairly with vita, signum, fate, Nanoha, all the materials
I did beat her with everyone but one person...I think Einhart?
Oh nice!
But it still sucked
Oh i did after a while
when i hear Tsubasa I think it's levi at first when I was watching Gear for the first time.
Hated fighting her
the final boss Yuri or U-D sucked
The materials were tons fun
Same!
she was fun
I enjoyed Vivio a lot in the game though
Oh I see! I like Nanoha and vita a lot
<@!139432096023183360> that amazing!
Who is your fav?
YESSS
You too?!?!
and the psp games were fun too
and all the movies!~
seen nanoha!~
what anime are similar to sympogear?
Static characters can be a bore in some series
Like I like seeing it happens
But some is better then none
Oh? I love character development!
Huh really? I saw the first EP with friends and it was interesting?
Ah it's killing bites, gotcha. I saw Darwin and assume animals
With the animal people?
That's the battle one?
Wowzzers and cool figure Akeupho
Why?
Really?
I seen statues are $$$ and im like do i really want that you know?
But are those $$$?
Nice!
<:HibikiWow:614268629952757760>
It was neat
Used to have her movie figma
Lol I can feel that
Nanoha! But fate pretty tight too
Gasp! Nanoha friend!
Oh?
Nice!
Lol
Which make sense
Especially Koalas
Oh goodness they are
Eww
nice!
Wait it got an anime?!!?
well kind of
we are here for ya
Still strong
<@456226577798135808>. That's sounds really sad, how are you alive in such weather?
That's awesome. I never left my homeland. Would like to do so one day
That sucks, but at least you get to explore Japan.
Now that's a old name I haven't heard in a while.
That would have been neat
It was good cause it got fans like me into the series. Actually it was one of the first animes I ever saw
That or a gacha game! <:HibikiBlep:605209109284782090>
<:HibikiWow:614268629952757760>
^information plz?!?!
I torrent it
Okay, what is it called?
Season 1 on CR
where can I find season 2
the season 1
I found that one on CR
two seasons?
do you suggest any good anime?
I mean after the anime
?
also what do you suggest after watching it?
gotcha, and the show?
I always been curious about it, but I never touched it yet
is it that good?
also Asenshi has a thing for Selector Infected WIXOSS?
Nice! I loved that show!
wozzers
oh wow a prewuel prequel
which is?
pretty good
BD 720
found it actually
do they do batch torrent?
Asenshi  subs?
are the shiro subs good?
question
will watch them after season 1
gotcha
also is the "shiro" subs on Nyaa good for the season 1?
I going to watch the first season then the moives
I started the movies downloads
same content?
but I can watch the moives instead yeah?
is it moves?
and the chapters?
is that's what I am looking for?
what's washio Sumi
did not like it
it was weird
yeah
at best it was considered "eh" from what I can tell
I heard nothing good about it
daybreak illusion
but didn't see it yet
I heard another came out
WIXOSS is great! I saw both season
I did not like Magical girl raising project
lol
will download
oh coolo
oh same yeah, I want song lyrics
do I need to see it?
I see it's a OVA
<:HibikiWow:614268629952757760>
What subs do you suggest for this one?
sweetness
or nanoha
or madoka
if I like Gear would I like this?
from the offical trailer
so it's a threater magic girl?
oh?
I saw meme for that...
oh the giraffe thingy?
Starlight?
similar taste yeah in theory maybe?
so you might have something else I like!
you like Nanoha
just curious at your suggestion AKeupho
I really like Gear and from what I can tell, I will like Yuuki is a Hero
I am! <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
Me?
I'm worth $5!
I'm only a uncommon, but I try my best you know
I'm truly accepted here! <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
I was called out by Shirabe herself
Plz
Aka Saint Kaiser Olive
Prologue of the whole series
Are you sure? <:HibikiWhat:336656482907193344>
Just a shonen superhero theme version
Nothing special really
MHA is okay
<:HibikiWow:614268629952757760>
And like how they made it mysterious but was still pretty fun
And I liked how their magical girl stuff was tied to apps on their phones
It was pretty good opening ep
Just saw ep 1 of Yuuki Yuna is a hero
for KR
it takes me about a month to an month and a half to finish a season if I am actively watching it.
Yeah KR is so much sometimes
Flip Flappers? That's the only one I didn't know.
and like that's the last time I saw anime till I found gear two weeks ago
and like it took us four months to watch the whole thing
but I was watching it in a group
the only bad thing about wasn't the show
Fate/Zero was a really good show
like watching all five season of Symphogear in two weeks was tons of fun
haven't watch anime so much in years and its been pretty fun so far
hey once I finish what you gave me for anime recs. I going to come to ya for some more AKeupho
lol
Might as well just give up
I did it cause everyone just called me that
umm...Shirabe wrong channel
Really? Hmm okay.
<@!139432096023183360>  yes please
Really? Nice!
but it still neat they went into the time and effort to show how Togo getting around in school
I figure it out when I get there
Gotcha
but does anyone know where I can find the other half
and I know the second season has the movies in it
I got all the movies download
question about the second season
fair
(who has this on a sunday anyways?)
(in the middle of online school discussion meeting, lecture thingy)
I am hoping to get to ep 5 today
I was hoping it was more then just the first ep.
Nice!
Cause I am big fan of all those little details
like I never seen an anime show do that before and that only got me really interested.
I  do like all the details they put in based on Togo disability and how she gets around
it was a very nice touch and I respect the show greatly for that so far.
So one thing I do want to say about Yuuki Yuna is a hero so far. (I still only seen ep 1, later today I hope to see more)
It's that bad?
oh that's cool
is this a prequel movies?
sooo yeah
I like yuri a lot and MGs
that's the band one yeah?
what's Rondo Rondo Rondo?
(also hi Dex!)
and so far they have been good!
they are pointing me to these shows
it's thanks to AKepuho
and now this flip flapper thingy
then starlight
starting to go more into Yuuki Yuna is a hero
it's third on my list now
lol okay okay
like all the magic and stuff is so cool
Magical Girls shows are my guilty pleasure
I'm okay with gayer
you got me then
Well, if AKeupho recs it
(I like that type of things and mecha)
So it's more of a magical girl show?
what if you didn't like FLCL?
DESS?! Date Togo?!!?
I already do so much reading for school <:TsubasaDisgust:349013662775902209>
I might wait then
oh
forms
just different media
it's pretty much the same thing
K-On is cute though
but I came from no anime so
...I liked Fate Deen...
if it wasn't for that show I wouldn't be here
Hey that was my first anime ever! Fate Deen!
never got to Striker S and onwards
and the movies
I seen the original series and A
No I mean the original HDN game 
Also Nanoha is fun
and even beat it
yes that one, with *random chance for skills to use, even healing*
started with the first one
I am a big fan of the games
it was fun
I have seen Neptunia actually
<:HibikiWhat:336656482907193344>
<:HibikiWhoops:585839808115507222>
Oh, my apologies for assuming
I figured friend
Who?
one of my RL friends is a huge fan of it
Yes, I think so and a light novel series
but that increase files size then?
I see
wow that means they are not doing a good job on the files then
Why is that series so large!?!?
jesus that's huge
I'm going to fully check it out once its finished
What happen? I drop the gacha cause it was kind if a bore
Oh?
haven't watch anime got distracted with DDLC mods...why are their so many of them? <:KirikaPanic:644235681677180958>
Anyways around 8pm will be time for Yuuki Yuuna is a hero!
<@238855496797257729> aww thanks!
Meat shields could work and its nice when they are willing to die for you
That too
Tanya is a legit psycho
Carol is fun though
<:MikuFear:642799630605615114>
But like she would be the anti-fun
That would be awesome
<:KirikaSmug:607742561414676517>
We could swap naruo into one piece
Like a character swap hmm...
Nanoha Shippuden the crossover that we need
Haha
Tell me how that goes
Lol okay Ayamine
Made in the abyss is not cute! Well i did hear animal school is
I am actually going to watch Yuuki Yuna is a hero (why such a long title)  and not play any more DDLC mods. <:KirikaSmug:607742561414676517>
What's everyone anime plan for today?
?
Lol
Even Karin is suprised at Togo 3 spirits
Oh shoot Karin spirit said a different line!
It called Yuuna a brute
They are?
???
I'm only in ep 3
Actually no spoilers
...they are?
Interesting
Karin? So it's she a official hero sent from the government
Oh hell her spirit actually talks that's neat
Also who the hell is the sword girl chick
I mean she already mentioned she lost her memory so it has to be something related to that
That or she's a super Chosen One
That's what I'm putting down
I bet in the past she was a hero
I bet this is how  they connect this to her losing her memory
Why is the cripple the badass, like it's super awesome but extremely suspicious
RL being super distracting
Yeah
My red flags are flying in my head
...why does Tougoo have three spirits to everyone's 1?
So they have to seal the vortex?  And not just destroy them...sounds fishy
Anime time!!!
You guys are being mean
Wait what
Lol what?
Also alpha waves lol
What did the gov sent her
Ah shit Fu and Karen are talking shit with each other
I'm scared now
You guys are saying this with a straight face
Omg
Yuna and Togo are MC
Exactly
Togo knows some really random shit
I bet they're going to kill her sister off first
Noooooooo
Fu amusing
Nooooooo
Oh dear they are going mami her
Wait...karin not in the opening?
Its covered so we are okay
I want Karin to sing so I can call her red <:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
How cute
Ah she joined the group chat
Now all she do is sing
Also karia is giving me I'm a blade vibbe
I'm lame like that
I hate being spoiled
I'm not pressing them
Huh
So the girls can actually level up and it's called blooming
Like that's a neat little detail there
But she's sending her status reports in English
Karin is actually training which is pretty cool
Lol
The plot thickens
It's like the government papers all over again
Oh dear so man black lines
Weakest one so far
It was cute but eh
Ep 4 felt like filler to be honest
Already 30mins pass bedtime for work
Well I dont have time tonight
This ep 4 seems like a good stopping point
Anyways
I'm mean you can say proper henshin
Welp ep 4 was just the sister backstory / slash of life
Yesss
And he came out in 2000
There's a famous fight scene where he does exact the same thing
It's a reference to Kuuga I believe?
üòù
I saw gear first
Nah don't care
And that make Togo Miku?
Unless Yuuna is a expy bikki
You can't punch gods Yuuna
This isn't Gear
Is this a reverse Madoka situation
For what? Getting Togo?
Lol
It's a giant conspiracy
Too op
Exactly she op
What a devious smug little girl
Sure
Lol
She faking it
I beat she not even crippled
And likes fucking with people
Got it
Togo is evil homura
Fu stop raising death flags
Like these girls are fuck
Also there's like five of these Vortex coming at them
What
I got pops up supplements for the fight
Also love how Karin takes drugs before the battle
Random shit
That's just Shirabe being herself
The what?
Burning chapel is kuuga
Insightful as always
Haha thanks Shirabe
But still longish
I know
Why such a long title
Onto EP 5 of Yuuki is hero
~~and a yandere gf~~
He has tons of 1-ups
He's just well...kind of a nerd at heart
I like him
That's tight Subaru isn't a bad guy at heart
So they call her Ferris yeah? And not Felix anymore
They are? That's neat
even I knew that and I never seen Re-Zero
That's like a common fact of it Ayamine
I need $$$
Nah i got work at 7am
Yuuna just pulled a bikki
Wtf
For each other
They seem gay
So are like Yuuna and Togo a thing
Actually how can they breathe in space
Togo has a spacd battleship
So tomorrow I'll be starting on episode 8
I'll probably just watch three episodes tonight
Oh
Another show?!?!
Pm
Till 10:45ish
It's coming from space
Is that a spaceship
I figured
Lol
Togo has a fricking battleship
Ah
Oh boy the vortexes spirit bombing them now
Wait so when they're in Blooming mode they can just kill these things
Thr fuck
Itsuki too
Oh and she just flat-out killed them
And put a little Japanese flag on her forehead
She just bloomed also
Togo
Is this blooming
Wait
Oh
Now fu is drowning
Total party kill
They just went Power Rangers on these girls
Oh goodness they fused
Yay
Itsuki actually did something
Watch out!
Togo!!!!!
Oh man The Vortex of using a sound attack against them
This reaction as I watch has been fun
I don't really see anime but thanks to grad school in sick of reading even for fun
Yuyuyu is easy to remember i shall call it that for now on
I can roll with that
Yuyuyu is the be nick name?
So are these girls like you know paid for this and shit
So it is an after effect blooming
So Karin is okay
That's harsh
Damn
The government doesn't want to them to fight anymore because their disabilities are forever
üëç
Oh Togo keep charts
I would lose smell
Also taste or smell?
Ah she lost hearing in her left ear for Togo
The best would be smell I think
To be honest
You know Yuuna got lucky with her thing
Got it
So blooming = disability after use
So their powers gives them disabilities if they bloom
The right one?
So Togo cant hear from one ear?
Oh shit that's a sick eyepatch
...can she not hear from one of her ears now
Wait is that how Togo lost her legs
Nooo Yuuna can't taste anymore
And you don't have to fight until all the other heroes get killed and your the last ones
That's cool I dig it
Oh that's nice of the government saying that they're done with fighting
Oh shit itsuki mute
It does
Lol
Fu and her eye
Going to move onwards to starlight or flap flappers
Nah
( my auto voice thing sucks)
After I finish the first season, I'm going into the movies and then the rest of season 2
Oh right
Post them once I finish the series please
Yay
Well it looks like they're all alive
Save to watch later
Even has gungir fist
Maybe it's a magical phone idk
Huh
I guess not cuz it's tied to  the hero system
Yeah
His tail looks like a sickle
At the end of ep 7
That came with the phones
The new one
Yo the spirit looks Grim as f***
And a spirit
More of them are coming
It was cute
That's enough for today
Alright ep 7 is done
And this animation as a reference to World War II
What are the vortex made by The Americans
Aw crap there's more than 12
The Vortex are based on constellations
And Togo telling scary stories
Ah Fu rolled into Karin bed
So long
And I'm like ehm
Then learn like part 3 was like 40 episode
I enjoyed the first two parts
And I think six episodes of Stardust Crusaders
Talking about JoJo I've only seen part 1 and 2
Like JoJo <:KirikaApproval:586957465552158720>
Oh s*** the government set them on a beach vacation
But haven't touch the anime
I read parts of manga
Fair
Easy sell for most people
Kids plus shock factors
And the government might be lying aboit blooming side-effects
Aww Karin gets to stay
Fu her version? It's the one I'm drawing a blank on
Togo her hearing of music and Yuna voice
Itsuki her voice = singing
Yuna lost taste of the snacks she likes
All of there disabilities reflect something they like
I just realized something
...<:ShirabeStare:582381430915596289>
Or  like hey you have disabilities now for Life thanks for saving mankind
Dude what have you guys gotten me into
It been pretty good so far
I have truly step into a minefield
Yuyuyu has soo many black boxes
<:KirikaSmug:607742561414676517>
It could be both
Ah good sir
Bam pothole resolved
Telling you she got the phone when she joined the club
I dont
That's all I can think of she got the phone when she join the club
Like the phone
...maybe she got it when she join the club
Nice picks, Re-Zero pretty solid
And what is it?
Which means more free time!
Cause I get out of work early so I have time to do school work before I normally have to
Yes
üëç
Have a RP thing
Will not have time tonight
7
Okay!
Oh I should be finishing Yuyuyu tomorrow friend
Gah I always run out of time for things!
And i rewrite
I need to see Planterian
Little Busters is coming to the switch and I hope gets a it's a global release
It was fun.
I have played Clannad
I know about Key but the last thing I know about them was Rewrite
Don't be shy!~
Do tell!
Oh?
How are you today?
Hey AKeupho
YuYuYu I am after you
Anime later today!
oh wait it's midnight
No anime today
I do?
Still a good game üëç
how could you
but of course he forgot Char's Counterattack
And Ayamine list is right
Vs Gundam is amazing
I hated myself every second
and eventually went back and watched it
and I got at least 15 eps in
it is the only gundam series I every drop
AGE was trash
the old one is really old and has not age well
Origin was okay
And if it's like Age I'll drop it after ep 4 or 5
Whiskey it's the only Gundam main series I haven't seen
I am currentlly downloading Gundam Tunderbolt two movies and Reconguista in G
oh and I finished downloading Ueno-san Wa Bukiyou
Ah Yuuna huging Togo
Like they legit worship them
Lile this not Madoka dark and the government do respect these girls who gone too far
Man like I have mixed feelings here
The fuck
She  may be a crippled but now she's a mini God
20 times
Holy fuck
Mother bleep
Togo goes to her and noooooo
Nogi gave her the ribbon
04 or 5
One for ears her legs and her memories I assume
3 times
Oh so by becoming more and more crippled they become like mini Shinto gods
She's a God now
Oh s*** there like government priests around here now
Melt okay
Jalter
I would 100% burn her
I wouldn't even use her as a servant
Anyways so every time they bloom they're making an offering to the Gods
Sorry I extremely hate Jalter
Total trash
Get that fucking shit out of here
So that's why the government has been treating them so well
Shrine maidens
So they Immortal cripples
The fuck
Excuse me
Heroes can never die?
Abscisson the price of the gods powrs
When flowed fall
What the fuck
Eww
And she sounds weird talking about Togo
Nogi?
This girls in like tons of bandages
Wasahi who the fuck
The heck
A shine?
Wait where did Togo and Yuuna go
Thr heck
Why is her flower up to 3?
Wait
Also Yuuna hero kick
That's what they just talk about
Ah snap
Also the spirits are really moving now
Blessing of the God is the title hmm
Let's finish season 1 today
Yuyuyu ep 8 go!!!
Wait Yuuna you should be like more concerned your GF almost killed herself 10 times
So the fairies are like a systems firewall preventing damage to the program's aka the heroes
Oh she's testing it but that's f***** up
And her fairies are preventing it
Togo you try to kill yourself in 10 different ways
Holy fuck
Or can she not even do that
Like cuz you blow into a flute or trombone or something
That's really surprising. Oh so is sbs mute disability affecting all speaking can like she blow into an instrument like a flute or something
Exactly
Or ask her to learn a piano or guitar
Bam
Piano
It is the one good thing that the u.s. education system does do as that we give disabilities a lot of support
And in the United States like you don't do that in education
I have a lot of friends and people who are like actual teachers
What a failure of a teacher
You dick
Of course she can't sing she's mute
Are you f****** kidding me
Like they feel like they're doing a lot more with her with her disability
Is it bad that I like itsuki as a mute compared to talking.
Like fhe give hr tons more emotions and stuff
I'm not touching that show until it's completely out
Snap
Ah snap Fuu senpai know now too
Yeah I'm using Speech-to-Text device
Yeah that one had a great world and idea but the character is pretty not good
To be honest I feel like this show has significantly better characters
And I really like Madoka
But overall I am enjoying this show a lot more then Madoka
I am using voice chat
But hey you know at least they get taken care of?
I mean it's still pretty f****** s*****
Cause a big part of Madoka is that the magical girls in that show are never remembered and they're forgotten. At least with the hero Club they can still remember each other in the government does take care of them
So I think the hero club  has a better deal then madoka girls
Still I would rather be an immortal crippled that's worship vs a soul eating witch
The kissing scene yeah
I have it on my watch list
Ep 8 finished
Ah sorry AKepuho
This way I'll be able to save everyone
Togo the fuck are you doing
So it goes right to left off
Bonds of Love episode 10
So after finished the first season I should go straight into the prologue movies yeah
You absolute monster
No stop it don't show me this flashback with the little sisters singing
My mind is blown
Oh you're right
Wow
Oh I thought Yuuna what since using her own powers to deflect it not her fairies
This show blow Madoka out of the water 10 fold
That was a trip
Wow
Ep 9 over
I feel the sad
Itsuki is doing everything not to cry either
That crying hug
Yuuna you absolute fof a hero person you.
FUU feels super guilty
And now everyone is down
Still the only way to save the world
Itsuki is best sister ever
FUU just transformed
Ah shit
Aka Itsuki vocal cords going poof
I mean your body is fine if you never had that part in the first place
So I mean the government isn't lying per say there's nothing wrong with their bodies medically. It's just a supernatural phenomenon that's not Medical
When are you writing that light novel by the way
Still better then Madoka
FUU is now losing her shit
Fine
Find demigod
I mean she is a God
So they're literally Shrine maidens who are sacrificing themselves
And then she was returned to her original parents
Oh so she was adoptedil into rhe Wasshi
Oh shit she visiting her friend
Not commit ritual suicide
Just cut your arm
Jesus christ
Togo crazy
Three of them
That smug face was perfection
Amazing
Togo can use Magic
But like I like the characters so much that I don't mind
Normally I hate this type of episode
I am really enjoying this flashback episode so far
Eww Shounen
So that's how you meant them
Oh my Fuu
Uh huh
I want to have your snacks everyday
San changes to Chan
I didn't know I needed this in my life
Yuuna and Togo friendship monologue
So her birth parents dropped her because she's a cripple
Wow
Wait so like is her current parents not her real parents
Why would they change your name
They changed her name
2 years and her legs
Oh so she didn't forget all her memories just a chunk of it
Oh so she's from a family that works with the government
Flashback
Kid Togo
Yeah I downloaded the movies Blu-rays and the other half of season 2 Blu-ray
I love the soft music
...into playing now
Stop Togo
No
I'm actually okay with that
Oh so the government holy ritual magic or whatever gives them the stuff
Like cars and cell phones
How do they have the resources to produce modern technology
Wait if it's one world and a little Island
That's even worse
Omg
So half of the gods attacked and killed mankind
And the rest were saved by the other gods.
Explains why Fuu and her sisters are blonds.
Japan / whatever country it is now
Is it literally the rest of humanity and the world
Nooo
The year
When did that happen
What how
Baby Jesus in heaven
Ignore it
Wrong chatrrom
For Blooming once
I was also talking about like how the government is already worshipping them
21 fairy!!!
Yeah and Togo fucking going bonkers Nogi what did you tell her
The truth of the world
So by becoming hero their adopted into the gods family and made into mini demigods
Oh
Because it's the path of divinity
I can tell
Wait the government is already worshipping these girls even thought they have bloom only once
Oh I see I see
That's because they live in a government that super religious
Been watching
Haven't been following
Ah
I'm asking
Ah shit Karin and Yuuna know the truth
Wouldn't thr tee take her power back
Why is Togo still a magical girl if she anti tree
Don't worry I'm using fansubs
I am going to watch
Right after I do the movies
Also is the second half of season 2 before this season
If only you know
Yuuna goes straight to Togo
Poor girl
DEX!!!!
Togo ending song makes me sad
I'm not sorry
I do find it interesting that the vortex aren't attacking her anymore. Like at the end of ep of 10
Um that get all your friends kill
I'll end this wretched world
I just had a rewind it cuz I didn't realize they changed the ending song
That's not what i meant and you know
...
You just blew a hole in the wall
And Togo are you thinking straight
That's a very good explanation and it's not a plot hole awesome
So is divine magic okay I'm okay with this
Oh s*** she's blind and her hearing
Her legs though
She just Bloom again
And she's just say that here Club rules
Oh no she lost the use of her arm after blooming
I don't want to see anyone cry
From now on I will fight as a member of the hero Club
Ah I guess
I have no knowledge of the series
Um spoiler?
Hell yea
FUU back in the fight
STAND PROUD
Itsuki you brave girl
I'm already reading 300 page a week because of grad school I'm not doing more reading
Not going to lie I don't have time to read them
The what?
Also FU lost her shit and is crulled unto a ball
Togo you crazed girl
Blooming for the 5 time
MF Karin
Yuuna legs are gone
Then how did Nogi keep her memories
Yeah the memory issue the problem
Ewww
Umm when do I click that
Ah nice
Nice
How long are the prologue movies by the way
Ep 12!
Yeah but other people want to be alive
But I would rather be alive than dead
I mean I guess they won't suffer
Because in a way she's just getting everyone killed
I still don't get her whole thing
Yeah that was good
Hero Punch indeed
Sorry finishing ep
FUU fighting Togo
Oh so if she transforms again she's okay
It's the Google one
Android
Ah I noticed the ribbon niw
Her hair color is different
Wtf
First movie is called friends
Togo
Gin
Blond girl
Nogi
Gone
2/4
They are all going to die expect for Togo and Nogi
I'm worried that the first line of the song is the call of Fate will call these girls
Movie opening
Time for our duty
Um Togo goes right into it
And not destroyed
Oh the bridge okay
Where is Nogi then?
Gin?
Wait
She short hair?
Gasp Nogi
Oh no I'm just watching the first movie
Cool because I have to go to bed at like 10:45
Should I just stop here then
Cause time
I will
What do you mean by Yuuna with the petals
Also small Togo is cute
Correct
Also the tree gave back
Oh man all the stuff is censored.
Well only one movie today
Going straight into the prologue
It was amazing
Ugh I just want to jump into the "sequel" half of season two. I really want to know what happen to Yuuna
I'll be fine uh huh
All shit Yuuna fell
The hell did  Yuuna do
During Yuna speech
Nogi okay too
Wait whag
Wait what
So by being released by the tree they became normal again
With Togo and Yuuna
And Togo like fuck the tree Yuuna came back herself
What a role reversal
Yuuna back baby
To...go..san
Yuuna is in a coma
Oh
Oh successors
Oh hey Karin not competely blind any more
Wait So they are free from the tree
Togo can walk ish
Itsuki talking
Lol yeah
Lol Togo smol ver is look at Gin being late
Who made weapons look like toys as a quirk
Yep and was like Yuuna but a tad bit darker and a mad scientist
The funny thing is that she was called Yuna in it
Hahaha
Maybe
Hmm
Thank you
Perfect
Smol Togo is as gay as the big one
Lies
It's cute
As a smol
Togo still have her quirky faces
üëç
Togo reading a victory speech to rhem
Lol
And they are in the know
Maybe the school they go to are like high class place
Just join the hero club
Lol
Togo going to a website
"How to make friends"
?
Like they're in school than  immediately was sent into battle
Not yet
It's killed the Vertex
Oh
...
Wait so is the bridge super important
Or talk
It's easier to type
Oh they killed it?
Yep
How handy
Ah Nogi spear is a umbrella
Gin just drunk Vortex water
Later Akeupho
Also they're getting there assed kicked
And gin not serious Karin
So Togo has bow
Nogi henshin was weird
Not instant henshin
Wait they are chanting here
The hair color threw me off
Make sense
Grad School man
Lol
<:HibikiGay:670494484701773845>
<@431214733463519232>. I do it for you man
I don't want to put more on my plate
It's just I have so much reading due class man
Fingers Cross
Around 8pmish est
üëç
If all goes well
Going to get the rest of the prologue movies done today
I promise
Ciao
When I do
I'll post here
Or Wednesday
I will watch more tomorrow
Welp that's enough for me.
Probably but I don't care that much
Smol Togo talked to her friends by there nicknames or Gin by her first. What a cute way to end that movie.
Overall all very fun and yeah you do need to see season 1 to get it
Cool
There no answer is there
So why do they not re build the bridge after the two years of prologue to season 1
Okay
Click?
Gin is just Yuuna with siblings
Yep
Wait Gin has more siblings
Also Togo Why do you have spy glasses
Dead
I'm kind of sad cuz I just realized with the apocalypse all the animals in the world are also did
I bet Gin is late cause she has no parents
Oh
Togo annoyed face about Gin being late
Nogi pj
I like ships too Togo
Amazing
And Smol Togo is still a history nerd
They are a gay
And now they are just staring at their coach
Wow
Even small Togo has big boobs
Make sense
Anyways I meant the hero club
I love this new pic
She's the only one
I do like how they're getting actual training though
Instead of complete Japanese
Why do they use English words once in awhile
What I don't understand if they're in post-apocalypse whatever
Don't do a gap year
You should go straight into after undergrad btw
Yep
But your like 50 pages jump to 250 plus
It's mostly reading
It's like undergrad but 3x times the work
Lol
Amazing
And now she just on Japanese Imperial Navy rant about a aircraft carrier
Ah you right
Aka redheads
So Togo has a *type*

(Had to pause for family)

Pictures are love
Omg
And pictures
Noise bleed
In super cute clothing
Togo freaking out
Gin in cute clothing
Meme queen
Hail Togo
Banzi!
Togo is doing it too
She singing in English
And her limo
Nogi English killed me
More training is always good
Smol Togo intro was brooding
I shall start with Washi is a hero move 2
Alrighty
OvD live reaction to anime
Aka
We might as well make this a tradition
Lol
Will be hitting the other movies tonight
From the curse of hw
I'm freed
I fixed above post
I was looking at something else
Yeah
And that's small
Guam is 540¬†km2
*Guam* is bigger then this
And this island is 225km?
At 2,707¬†km2
Like even Rhode Island is bigger then this little island
Wait how small os this island
Things to make a lot more sense now.
Not something that can hold 3.2 million people.
I thought their Island was like the size of Hawaii or something.
Like
Shit that's huge
Oh
I thought this island was small
But yeau
Oh dear
Also where is Gin parents
Wait how big is this island
Whole moly that's a huge island
How big is the population of their island
Togo chat image thing is just the Japanese flag
Omg
Oh no
Enrich the country and strengthen the military.
Oh god please stop this
Like Kamen Rider has better CGI than this.
This CGI dancing is horrible.
And now they are singing
Amazing
Hahah
As military riders
Nogi and Togo
All my goodness
I'm enjoying it
All the Togo faces are <:MikuBliss:336657233712513024>
It's amazing
That face
Haha
Amazing
Nogi gets a love letter
And Gin and Togo
Assume it's a letter of challenge
32
Tv
Yes
Camera
Because it's discord mobile
" I failed to share the country's Glory"
Also Washi failed novel
Nogi dreams
Omg
Lol
I super into navy stuff
I knew before hand
Well then.
Oh, they're telling the whole class why she's dead.
Gin dead
We are tree huggers here
We don't want your dick pic
Fuck you too Gods
How rude
Other then exist
What did we do to them
But why
Of course
God dicks pic
And that's how half of humanity died
Dick pics everywhere
Dick movies
Yes
Like the hell gods dick movie
Also do they every explain why half of the gods wanted to shank mankind
*Good bye Gin*
<:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
Spirits
So far these movies are like a hundred times more bloodier than the first season
I'm being blunt Dex
I'm not
Oh yeah she going to die
She got shot
Oh
And gin soloing them
It's like three vertex
Being arguing about land
Haven't been paying attention
I think
They just got fucked up
Oh man
Not even 1%
That's very small
But it's very thick
It's still not a long island
I see a number and I post
Don't have time to really look
Sorry I'm watching anime and doing this
Was only looking at length and not total area
My bad
Just length
I have not been looking at area
I'm being dumb
?
If Guam is bigger
This is a small island
Anyways
I'm looking at length
It's only 225 km long
I think it is
Wait is this the Vertex final boss of season 1?
Bridge gone
Togo legs went out
Ah shit
Noooo
Nogi eye went
They bloomed...
Smol Togo is on big Togo costume with gun
Like it's a catch-22.
Because if they don't the girls might not fight then all of humanity is dead.
I mean I can understand why they kept this a secret.
Like both girls parents were legitimately pissed.
Togo adopted parents were legit enraged
And Nogi mom and dad were crying
You actually have a spine
You go parents
And the parents are actually pissed
Oh man
The parents know about the blooming
That's messed up
Oh, the class made a sign for them.
That's actually heart warming
her adopted parents couldn't have kids.
That Togo had
It's the egg spirit
Their trainer is really reading the instructions for the spirits and apparently Blooming also
*harsh*
And I just realized Togo forgot Gin
They are only sixth graders
Oh man
What did they deserve for this
But what about the animals
I'm not defending the Gods on mankind killing f*** them.
Also, like I can understand that they want to destroy mankind. But why blow up the Earth and kill all the other animals?
Or this is forever war
So after what 1000 years they will just leave them alone
Dude, it's been three hundred years get over it.
Wait with them as the 3 girls as the first heroes
Ah make sense
Also, it's been like three hundred years.
Can't the other gods just leave Humanity alone now.
But it's due to this event of them being heroes is why the spirits are created?
Yes.
So these three girls aren't the first Heroes.
It's life, man and Google sama
Togo lose her shit
Oh s***, they're being called to battle during it.
This funeral scene man, I feel for the little bro.
I'll just ask for the information once I finish the movie.
Funeral scene
Yes
Plz
It
I'm not going to have a chance to read
Just tell me about
I beat it was some asshole
Who made the gods hate us
Like what
Fuck you too gods
Gotcha
So Gods are dicks
It's kind of weird to be honest
Yep
(Only 1 ep behind)
And been update on zero-1
I saw 5 season of KR from Sept to Dec
I been on a KR break cause of watching anime
Just a couple of people like my reactions when I started season 1 right now last week.

Hey me too! I'm on ep 10 of blade
KR is great
And fair
No pressure
Feel that
What's up
Also hey Brownstar
Heavily better
It's better then Madoka
Best magical girl show
It's amazing
And I hope you guys don't mind my live Reaction to the series and probably future series.
Flip Flappers?
Okay that's 1 for that
Starlight is at zero 
( I'm going to watch both series cuz I already downloaded them. I just wanted to know which one I should watch first.)
I was suggested Flip Flappers and Starlight Revere
What should I see next after YuYuYu?
(I will maybe start season 2 tomorrow if not Friday if all goes well)
Also
Or 4.5 out 5
I would give it an A
Overall, very solid prequel trilogy
And the first movie you was pretty good also.
Third movie was good, but it was really just a wrap up.
I really enjoyed the slice of life and then the tragedy at the end.
Not going to lie. The second one was the best.
The movies were pretty good.
Thank you BlackRaiden
Plz
LN run down?
Anyways
I'm a sixth grader now
Shirabe thanks I guess
Make sense
Ah okay
Can i click it
What's the reason
I believe the Taisha part
?
But Multiple times in the movies they had scenes where the parents actually say like all she's so good for us and she's amazing and they love her.
Like they legit did
So why did the adoptive parents give her up if they actually really loved Washi
Bridge is gone
Heart not beating
Yep
All 12
No
Oh
Oh this is where she bloom 21 times
Brutal
But not Nogi
She know who gin is
Wait
"Who are you?"
Nooooo
*her heart not beating excuse me?*
Nogi
*learnt the truth*
üëç
Oh my
A weed huh how cruel
Good lore building
I learn so much
Wow
<:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
Oh so || humans broke the deal then? ||
<@468591607332208641>. That thing about Karin is mind blowing. Also thank you so much for the summary. The thing about Yuna make a lot more sense.
|| Also if the Gov. Made a deal with the heavenly gods. Why are the god attacking them now? ||
So that make sense
Well most of humanity dies
Thank you
That's amazing
Oh nice
Lol fair
Ah we should move this to non spoiler section
JoJo is something
I don't think it's as bad as people say it is
It's decent
I enjoyed it
it was my first anime
nice
which one
but Part 5 takes it waaaaay too far
I think some flamboyant is not bad
anyways
and is not need around these parts
and crazy
how about their designs is very flamboyant
I mean you Voy
well yeah he's right
ah
and Voy don't you dare
you can't tell me it looks good
it's still a silly design
ugh
and a pink suit shirt thing
like a heart shape hole in your chest
I just can't even bother
Part 5 the character just look so dumb
the anime does not do it justice at all
haha, but his manga when you see in person is very impressive.
I don't watch most shounnen anymore
That is fair
But part 5 the characters are too much design wise even for JoJo
I do have to admit I kind of interested in part 4
I do like how it's a murder mystery
Part 3 was well too long
Part 2 was a fun battle anime
Part 1 wasn't bad it was enjoyable
Dio was such a dick
yes
Not fans of the stands I guess
I enjoyed Part 1 and 2
But part 3 was boring
Fate is better anyways
I am very excited for it
I should be able to get two at least
also sometime next week I will be starting Starlight
I will start messing here once cool shit happen or interesting thing
I hope to get at least two eps tonight
Yep
I will be starting right after the prolouge movies
I am very excited
i will be watching YuYuYu season two in 15mins
IDK but I hear it's amazing
Oh
Wait, did they forget about her cuz she went to play hero.

Wow, it's been awhile, and now your a black hole
The fuck
A black hole
They have chrages
Like the fairy don't always protect them now
But it doesn't sound as strong
Oh okay
Then their last one
Post-sange system seems weaker
It's cute
Also I like how Nogi calls Yuna YuYuYu
Interesting
Wait they made a new system
Make sense
Oh yeah worship her
Nogi brought them their phones back

Lies...or is it? We never do see Yuuna parenrs

<:TsubasaUpset:672861878703357968>

No telling
Yuna has to be the chosen undead by herself
Oh, okay. That makes sense.

The actually fuck
What the fuck
I wonder if Yuuna would just show them
Yeah
Stop hallucinating the dark sign on your friends.
Yuuna Is hallucinating again.
Damn she fast

Nice
Please I need your help <:ShiraBean:661294258795446326>
I need gifs of Tougou Mimori
Friends
Thank you
Or is it all prequel stuff?
Also is there anything in the YuYuYu timeline after season 2?
In a way
So I mean the Taisha won there
||who's bodies were from the Tree god themselves||
Like super duper holy ones
And well the Taisha got five holy girls out of it
She must have really believe in the power of love then
Brutal
Ouch
Oh make sense
Or something
So what was that bit about Nogi being a mastermind?
Anyways
It was pretty solid
Ah fair
I have work
?
You know, this is not action pack at the last season, but this is still as good as season 1
Will finish tomorrow
Well I got to stop here
Lol that is true
Nooo
And the Curse of the Undead is killing her
Yuna is ||a body made by the tree god||
Oh shit
Oh and it explains what happen to her at the end of Season 1
And it's a ||curse from the Heaven God's||
Oh snap to government does know
Or are they just "friends"
Togo is in love with Yuuna right?
Yo I love how she goes into Yuuna room And immediately know something is wrong because of a book.
Hold up. She taught her fairy military hands signs
Oh thats why Togo been taking pictures
Oh Yuuna fainted
Oh man this scene with Karin and Yuuna
The cat ran away
Oh are animals scared of Yuuna now?
Wait is FUU and Karin into each other
Sky on fire
Ah shit
Fuck off heavens gods
Its getting serious
Frostbite warning
Ah shit
Cause I'm on Yuuna side od it
It kind of did but not
Let her light the kin
Honey
What's the right thing?
Yuuna face at ||Itsuki crying||
Please dont kill yourself
Um Togo
Yep
Cue curse appears on club and Yuuna freaks out
And the club like we can figure it out
I *have to light the first flame*
I'm the chosen undead
Yuuna is like
Of course hero club is like no way fam
Fail
*No Way*
How could it
Can't
You mean a üå≥
So Yuna is Jesus Chosen Undead
Into the realms of the gods
Oh, so they're trying to ascend Humanity.
So she marries the tree to make sure the barrier doesn't fall.
I'm confused
How does marrige thing works
So like by doing this does the barrier not fail
I'm disappointed
Worse ship
Nani
And it's the god
Togo freaks out
Yuuna is getting married what
Pure Hearts huh?
It's time for feels
Who?
I am ready
YuYuYu finishing up in 10 mins start
I get the point
Hmm no that's not it
Movies also an 8/10
I would season 1 was a 9/10
But still a solid 8/10
But I don't know some about the climax is bugging me
Like season 2 is good
But it didn't have that bang of Season 1 or the movies
Like I enjoyed it
Ah okay
Like it was good
It did feel off
So the finale was post to be two eps
Ah
Lol
Idk
But feels off
Like it was good
But why am I not satisfied with this ending?
...
And Earth is back to normal
üå≥ gone
Heaven fucker are dead
Mankind won
Cool
The first hero?
Yeah
?
Wassi soul pop up...is Togo different?
Wait
I feel like I'm noting getting this
Their souls are?
Even if its a different form
Humanity survives
But if they save her everyone dies
I think saving the world is good
So..
Why are they trying to stop Yuuna?
Oh the tree blocking. FUU and Togo
Don't go forward by yourself and Mankai
Karin noooo
Oh neato
Gacha games tie in
Nothing never important happens in it
That's how it works
It's gacha
That's just rude
Why
Who is it
I guess it's *hero time* now
No wonder there no *future*
Uh shit this is legit endgame
It's a really cool touch
I noticed
What are you responding to?
I'm confused by your post
What?
Not that this was a thing in the past
I assume since she was a miko and a hero the Taisha were just trying some thing new
Not in the novel
That's something that should have been explain om the show
See
Anyways
Have mixed feelings on that but oh well
Ah okay
By that
Kind disappointed actually
I assume this was just a periodical thing of something
That's not the impression I got due to the graves
Oh
Yeah they brought more time for mankind
No like weren't the vertex been attacking them since the barrier went up pretty much?
They have for 300 years?
Seems tangible
Humanity didn't go extinct
They did accomplish something tangible
Man people have way too high expectations
Why would these Automaticly fix that?
Humanity been protect for 300 years
?
Why would they assume it wouldn't end otherwise?
Don't see how it was hard to get?
I thought it was the üå≥ rewarding them for winning the battle or protecting humanity
She did kill or beat the final Vortex and had ot blew up on her directly
That should have be obvious due to everyone being healed.
It would make sense she would be effected longer due her taking the brunt of the damage
Where?
Season 1 had "deus ex machina"?
Really? Season 1 made perfect sense and I went in blind
The movies did
Season 1 did
Exactly
The ending should make sense without having to read the LN
See that's the problem
Ugh
Idk
Or non Japanese fans?
Then?
So I guess I should say western fans
I thought it was light novel they got popular into anime versiom
Ah I did not know that
But the final ep was okay.
Ending good but it's just idk I'm not impressed?
And how they were handling it
Like I like the curse arc
Most people aren't going to read the LN
But for a regular viewer it is
But the lead up is eh
And I like the ending
Like Yuuna final thing was cool
If that make sense
But how it lead there
Not Yuuna ||hero punch||
I guess?
Out of no where
But it feels i don't know
Like and stuff
So I don't know too much
I never really been super into the anime scene.
Like they don't have to be magical girls anime. But like if I liked this show what are similar shows I would like?
Actually what animes are like YuYuYu
AKeupho recommend me this anime along with starlight and YuYuYu
All I've been told is that it's a magical girl anime.
Nice and tomorrow my "Friday night" so I'm going to go watch at least 4 eps
So yay
Also I'm blind into it too
Flip flap tomorrow
Fuck it
...
I only have 41 eps of blade yet <:TsubasaBliss:672861879000891432>
Haven't decided yet
Or watch KR blade
I will start flip Flappers maybe tomorrow
Anyways
Exactly
Its why Togo went crazy
They did explain in season 1 about the gods attacking humanity
Oh that sucks
I will geez
I need to start that
Talking about dub, the Konosuba one was very good
Super excited
Going to be going through at least 1 Gundam Thunderbolt movie today
I am downloading those anime movies they have
Also realized I never saw Zeta Gundam
but the series is now finished and they will finish it after the flash trilogy
Sad it ended with a cliff-hanger
Just finished Thunderbolt
Starting!
Will watch soonish
Thunderbolt it is!
<:KirikaPanic:644235681677180958>
I can't decide
Flip Flappers yeah? Or should I watch thunderbolt?
I'll so it Saturday or Sunday night
What's your favorite one Whiskey?
Also saw Thunderbolt yesterday and it was amazing.
and I also downloaded Turn A, Reconquest in G, the Gundam Zeta movies (I never saw Zeta at all),
I watched right before AGE
Yeah it was 00
I think OO?
and coming off something else that was serious
but I was like 16
I only saw the first three eps and hated it
But I did
I don't know why
I re-downloaded Gundam Age
SCP manga?

3rd not bad
Big Zam is cool
<:MikuBliss:336657233712513024>
and I really liked Judau and his ZZ
I had all the Gundam Dynasty warrior games
Wings are cool
My second favorite is the Gundam ZZ and my third is A-Turn
So many
Yeah
I really really enjoyed it
Hmm, IBO I think
oh show?
This boy is my favorite and I normally don't like Zeon mechs
go ahead
sure
Suits or shows
what's your top five?
hmm, okay
argeed
<:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
and F91
like all the side-stories and shit I have seen
hence the movies downloads
I seen all UC but Zeta and ZZ
Ah
Like it started off interesting but it just got weird
I'm not too into it
Also how do you feel about Unicorn?
Yeah it could have
Everyone was just so...*ugh*
Wing was bad
I don't think it was good but it wasn't bad
Destiny was okay
Oh yeah
(season 1 Seed)
I don't like Wing but Seed
Well unpopular opinion here
AGE? Huh
I loved it
I actually saw IBO last year.
It was really damn good
*do it*
if you think about it
<:MariaSunglasses:336656798687690752>  is a char clone
I did like Full Frontal
I guess
Quattro Bajeena was best Char
Oh shit that's awesome
Lacus Clyne sucks balls
loved A Turn in all the Games it was in
I am very excited about that
Too bad, I really like how Victory likes
So skip it?
Also how is Gundam Victory?
Oh yeah 100%
G is not Gundam. But a Super Robot show that thinks it's Gundam
duh
So I only have 25 eps
My torrrent is still downloading
Oh
25?
what how big is this show
and then see AGE 3?
so eps wise?
You have my interest Voy
Wait movies
Same
and Virtue is nice choice
<:MariaSunglasses:336656798687690752> = Char
Brother
It was pretty good.
It went really fast pace but I've played like a lot of Gundam video games that was on the PS2. So even though I never saw Zeta before I was still able to follow what was going on.
Now if I never saw the TV show or knew anything about Gundam I would be very confused
Finish
Watching 1st Zeta movie
The heck was that Kamille family hostage situation.
What a crazy start
Ending can be YouTube
Nope don't care
Gundam zeta movie start!
Going start the Gundam Zeta movies tonight.
Never saw this series but I hear the movies are just a recap
my friend just recommend that one to me
Any good anime suggestions for Magical girl anime or mechas?
show wise
showed the same time as G
Actually Build fighters
I have no idea, I mostly watch the shows and play the video games
that ending was rather, weak
I actually enjoyed until the last five epiodes
it was fun
Just finished gundam reconguista in G
Victory or Age?
Maybe I should watch Victory next
Ah, I only played the games that had Victory Suits in it
That looks dumb
That's a bummer
oh
Victory is one of favorite one
What's wrong with the Victory 2 Gundam MG?
You have a lot of the models?
if you are buying online
Really? Ah I must be adding shipping charges
USD
I always see HG around there like 20 to 40ish?
MG is the one above the HG right?
It's...something
Gundam
On EP 13 of Age
Newtypes are Psykers change my mind
Psycho-Frame are bull shit
have you seen it?
Like it's quite bizarre how powerful Newtypes are.
it's weird but kind of neat
like they go full on Newtype powers and the power of souls
watching Gunadm NT (Narrative) and this is really trippy
AGE was fun. 
7.5 out of 10
I enjoyed that last little scene with ||Flint statue and the Gundam Museum||
Wrap up AGE
Why must the climax fail at the final step?
It was so good
Flint just pull the trigger
He's preventing my boy Flint for killing all those dirty Vagans
I take everything back about defending Kio
<@486087033652248576>
and not be tied to Crossbone or Victory
lol
Hence why I am convinced we are getting with F91 that different so they can spin late UC into whatever they want
Past Flash
I  feel like they are setting things up for something big in UC
other then selling new models
I am just trying to figure out what's Bandai big game plan with this
Yep
or a OVA series of it
unless they completely change F91 and afterwards
They could give us a F91 series due to that UC project timeline thing they are doing
Hence why Unicorn and Narrative make no sense
true
Ah I don't understand Japanese, and I saw Unicorn with English dub.
Yep
I got the first two words you said but none of the rest
???
Unless they change hathaway flash
cause all of this shit is for nothing
due to F91 and Victory Gundam
is that it's all of nothing
What I don't get about Unicorn and Narrative
thanks voy for your suport
lol
I'm talking GOT size books
Then became anime 
And no light novels
It was a 10 novel scif series
It not regualr anime at all
It's very political drama
I'm in love
Have you seen it?
It's amazing
On EP 17 of 100+
Soooo good
Watch Legend of the Galactic Heroes
The original series if you love political drama
I seen all of those but X.
Will see that soonish
After Legend of the Galactic Heroes
Ah my mistake
It's jist slice of life mecha action
True
Build is not
Also maybe Build Fighters of you just wanted fun action scenes without war drama
Yep
Wait didn't I send you a whole picture about this
Hmm
Then 00 good entry point
Have you seen any gundam?
Fair
Hope you enjoy it
Cause it's also portrayed as a war documentary
But this is my type of jam 100%
Fair
So second
Good anime
War anime?
Legends of the galactic heroes
Agreed
Why is anyone fighting for this government
Like we get the Earth doesn't care but it's still a democracy how did the time frame from Zeta to Double Zeta make the Feddies 10x worse
Like I feel its unrealistic for them to develop in the way they do
I never understand the feddies past Zeta
If that make sense
But not evil
But some of the other eps paints the Feddies as super evil.
Which in not saying the Feddies are saints but I always figured they were incompetent big government
I do like the ep with Char in the Texas colony
I seen parts of it but lost interest
Make sense for a military using it as a terror weapons
Like Guntanks are whatever
So Origins gives the Feddis Guncanno outside of Project V?
Cool
And the second movie is the aftermath of the main characters in the wake of the OYW
I thought it was a battlefront during the OYW
I seen Thunderbolt
Gotcha
So Gundam anime is Amuro POV
Oh okay
I'm only half way there
When your anime series still have 50 + eps left
I still haven't seen it
Take it to the spoilers channel then please
No spoilers
No spoilers please
I haven't seen it
Or what could have been done better
We are just pointing out plot holes
We are not insulting the writer
I think we can still judge the show though
I forgot about that Serious
Lol
Like have her take back her country from thr corrupt nobles.
She has the support of the military and public population
*use it*
Like that's just dumb
You flew around with her on the battlefield
Using her to make a Coup in ORB
And you know
"Cagulia is crying" is not a justification
Or Kira reasoning for everything he does
Yep
And I think it's hilarious if Lacus never got almost assassinated
Kira and co would have stay in ORB probability
Same
Character wise
But man they murder the fudge out of him
They could have really done something cool with Shin
But a bad ending always leaves a bad taste
Hmm, I can say it was fine until the last third
Or Cagulia
I don't like how they handle Kira or Lacus in Destiny.
It was amusing to see the Gunpla server ripping him a new one the other day
I enjoyed Seed and the start of Destiny was interesting until Kira pop up
I have After War still in my list it's my next show to watch
True
It does but it makes it very hard to recommend
But it's tiring to see the UC just getting worse
If anything only Judeu (ZZ) makes any permanent impact buy gathering a bunch of Newtypes into a colony ship and leaving the solar system.
Like I get that i really do
But what's the point of any of the man characters if they don't change anything for the better
It does
I like the AU better
Exactly
It's boring and pointless
Like what's the point of all these wars if the situation gets worse
Well in UC nothing *good* happens
Like in Gundam Age as time goes on the Earth Gov there got reformed, tech advanced, things were getting *done*
There always have to be a status quo
Yeah I think that's why its a weak time line
And F91 i guess
Victory Gundam shows me
Also yeah i know
At least the hearts and mind
You know if Zeon wasn't cartoonishy evil they would have won
Even if it takes years
I hope we got another Gundam main series in the future that's not just another Build.
Drats that's lame
What happen?
Not surprised
Oh
Tell me more please
A CE movie?
They mention it in one of the side manga
Cause if I remember from background materials Mars is competely colonized but having it's own issues
Maybe explore what's going Mars and stuff
I would like a return to CE though
I only think he becomes bad in Destiny
My favorite ships
No going to lie I love the Archangel and Minvera designs
But it had a flashy ending
Same
Also what's everyone issues with Age?
I thought it was a fine show but Age 2 section which is also the shortest of all the Age parts
00 is pretty good
Lol
And its useless
Yep
That would have been fine
Like it would have been different if there was an actually plan and they lost
But it feels cheap in a way
Like it was no point
Just Mr Chocolate plan in general
Not that our dudes lost
Like that whole plot made me maf
So fricken dumb
And that's it
Yes let me use our founder original mobile suit the Baal
I just find chocolate man who plan dumb as fuck
Like I'm fine that they lost
Yeah
Lol
Tekkadan took a gamble and lost
It just wasn't done well
I understand what they trying to do
Eh Season 2 was interesting
I think IBO soundtrack is pretty good too
I enjoyed it a lot
I enjoyed Stargazers but itbhas been years
CE music is good
Anyways
What do you guys think of Star something movie Seed got
Also would we see a return to the CE in the future?
Like what's your thought on that?
Cause CE is popular still yeah?
Thank you
Strange but yeah?
Huh
Anime remake?
Setsuna will really become the GUNDAM then
Its been years since I saw it
Cause humans befriends aliens in that 00 movie right?
Hmm a Gundam series against aliens would be cool
A movie or an actually TV anime
Wait wut
And I recommend to anyone who really like political drama and debates about government types.
The show was definitely a epic of one
Overall I enjoyed it 
But man ep 40 to 75ish were a slog
Its just 100+ep in like three weeks is a lot.
I don't think I would ever watch this anime again.
But I don't regret watching
This has been one heck of a ride.
Oh the last ep of the Legends of the galactic heroes
Love this anime and card game
Hell yes!
But that what happen when you translate ten sci fi novels into 47 hours of animations
This anime still good but noe is seriously lagging plot wise
On EP 89 of Legend of the Galactic Heroes
Really good! üëç
Just finished the first movie
Also liked how Alto aka MC fled from being a child actor due to Identity Crisis well that's what the movies making it sound like.
Anyways the movie been really good
Only thing
I was saying its only 2059 AD in MF
But Macross tech kind of blows gundam out of the water.
That was comparing tech
So at least the movies kind of count
It really more comes to time and there a bunch of series I want to watch.
I'll moving onto something different
Just cause of time
Thanks though
Nah
Like this movie
Cause I don't mind if it's a little rush if it's good
When I have options to watch movies over the anime episodes I always do movies
Straight into the movie
And like its easier to watch two movies
Yeah it's been pretty good
Also man Idols are serious busy in Macross. I kind of forgot about it
And kind of a jerk
Like she coming off as a big nerd trying to be cool
Also I like how Sherry tries to be cool but she kind of not
But man its smooth tech
That is true
Find amusing that it takes place in 2059 AD and humanity like super advanced...like tech wise Gundam looks kind of lame.
Watching Macross fronter first movie
Oh?
Thanks!
I actually will event watch Delta and frontier now
Yeah I totally felt that
I am watching Ueno-san wa bukiyou
Delta kind of remind me of Symphogear funny enough
Its like a romance with mecha through in
And Macross Delta felt like a idol show with mecha in it.
Like its a mecha show but not?
Finished Macross Frontier movie and the Macross Delta movie.
As someone who only seen Gundam, Eva, Robotech
Macross is well so different
star design is okay
https://www.crunchyroll.com/anime-news/2020/04/15-1/nurture-your-own-angels-from-evangelion-with-these-evatchi-tamagotchi
please watch
Sengoku Basara is amazing
And well, no spoilers fo you
Nicol is fun with how he tries.
he hasn't
then no
Has um Nicol shown up yet?
the character I like hasn't show up yet in the anime then
which is umm... pass the "game" and that's all I say
I'm in the second phase of the manga
I can't say for spoliers
I am the same way
It's a fun anime, actually the otome reincarnation manga is a guilty pleasure of mine.
Haha, I can feel that.
I haven't check the anime ver yet
With my next life as villianess was a really fun Manga
Is there?
Nanoha was fun
Two chapters in and it's been amusing so far.
https://manganelo.com/manga/jx920482
It is very funny
So she has a play damage control
Also I highly recommend recommend reading the spin-off version of the series because it has the MC inserted at the start of the video game instead of before it
Highly enjoying it
Watching anime version of 
My next life as a villainess.
It's great to see one of your favorite manga updated and adapted into such a pretty anime.
True
*giggles*
I do think Nicole is the best of the guys.
And the only route she didn't play
I only see a female lead winning
Exactly
And legit only see them as friends
I want Maria to win
Truly she is amazing
Thank you!
Nice!
is amazing, the show is so good. Oh wait Ep 6 is out right?
The anime will have the scenes for such thing last for a couple of minutes
The manga still have the lolicon stuff buts only a panel or two
I would suggest the Illya manga over the anime
S1 and S2 are too different from each other imo
The movie was something
I agree with you 100%
And showcase how humanity can unite, if they have a singular foe
They did a great job of showing how the world reacts to such a thing
Yeah season 1 of OO hit a lot of plot points I wanted to see in Gundam
And the magic chibi mechs
I like both of the main characters
On EP 4 of Grandbelm
Very good anime so far
And the Re:Zero art work work better then expected
Very impressive with it
Yeah I might do that in a couple of months
Obviously
Best girl?
White Lily and Void Katze
And I liked with the idea they did with life
I give it a 4 out of 5
Finished Grandbelm it was a very good show.
Am I the only one that wants more Grandbelm? I enjoyed it a lot
Is pretty good too
https://mangaread.co/manga/tearmoon-teikoku-monogatari/
https://mangadex.org/title/31932/hero-san-and-former-general-san
Very good manga plz read
http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2020/06/pokemon_releases_new_looney_tunes-style_cartoon_starring_scraggy_and_mimikyu
Not *too* wrong

Is this what nightmares are made of
<:KirikaWhat:671948299179130885>
Wait RIAS = MARIA VA?
So she has to play fire control
Also it has an awesome spin-off where MC doesn't remember until the game start
The manga goes further
It's was a good one
Will catch up on Bakarina tomorrow. Super stoked
üëç
oh snap that's actually kind of neat
what's the different of progressive vs vanilla?
ah I forgot about it
its good
Gridman
Caught up in Bakarina. It's good the episode with the dungeon and the maid wasn't in the manga. But great additions
fuck yeah
plz
Mary endings?
ALL MY YES
YESSSS
https://bleedingcool.com/tv/transformers-war-for-cybertron-trilogy-siege-hits-netflix-this-july/
Cool anime hat.
Kill La Kill is amazing
Any recommendations?
anyways, what's good this season?
Okay, I am just going to disagree with you. Let's move onto a different topic, because you are missing my point.
Hence the narrator
Its filled like a documentary in universe
No its filmed in that type of style
I don't understand how you would find historical reference to RL in a sci-fi book series
LOGH is a sci-fi book series frame as a historical documentary
no thats more of a war action anime
It is
The biggest problem of LOGH is that they sent-ups for plots will take tons of episodes.
its more like a historical documentory where on event happens and you see the effects of that full bloom like 20 eps down the line
I picked up LOGH for its historical tone and enjoyed greatly
Haven't looked at it except of bakarina
But it's okay.
Anyways, anything good this season of anime?
no, that wasn't it either
I disagree. But that's okay. they mention it a couple of time before hand.
But fair enough, its just not your thing
Well the republic is a puppet government for the true bad dudes
that was the whole point
Well yes, the nobles are retarded
just not your thing?
So what made you stop at ep 24?
no like the main bad guys eps are in the 70"s
The terra church plot happens in the 70's
for LOGH?
EPIC
Saw the whole OG anime
Yo, was that legend of the galatic heroes I saw?
I still need to see crystal
I assume everyone here seen Sailor moon?
AoT was okay persay, but also not my thing
OG dragonball was fun as a kid. Tried to rewatch as a teen, not my cup of tea any more
That's Zeta Gundam.
agreeded
I seen the Origin version, it was enjoyable
lol wut
Ah, Sailor moon was one of my first anime
Right you guys have fun then
Nope still nothing
Never heard about it
I don't see the issue to be honest
And why is that a bad thing? PreCure been there for a long time
What else was you expecting?
In japan.
Its not related to it in any other way
its an adpation of the series and that's it
It was a spin-off series
Man that fire emblem game really go him going
Is he?
lol, true
HYPE
https://youtu.be/UksT5I1lvJM

I know its not anime, but I don't know where else to put this
The company who makes the game is Chinese and they have Chinese VA for it too
But HI3 is Chinese?
I watched the first four eps of Aldnoah.Zero today. I am enjoying it
Even six episodes would have been too much
But for visual media it is not that great of an idea
But you get my point, I read the books and I understand the idea
Even worse
It should have been at the most 2
I think the biggest issue with Endless Eight was well it was actually 8 eps.
interesting artcile
https://www.crunchyroll.com/anime-feature/2020/07/22/in-defense-of-endless-eight
Love how the good guys are in the mooks suits.
I am really enjoying how the show works.
Got to ep 10 S1 of Aldnoah Zero
I see.
Ah okay
Ah okay.
Does the anime cover all the light novels of of it?
Anyways its a visual novel correct?
I got it for free
<:TsubasaPeek:623246193002151938>
I am currently uhmm..."getting" the series with the Date a Live Rio Reincarnation
I know there some fans of Date A live on this Server, so I was just asking
Is Date A live a good series?
I actually didn't like monogatari...<:TsubasaDere:689195981841236109>
I get what you are saying Zaia and I agree with you
Make sense
Do you like the characters? The setting?
Okay.
Well how did you like the series?
https://youtu.be/TBO9ANTBCjM
This counts right?
Finished Aldnoah Zero today.
It was very good but the ending was bizzare
The novels were great
Cause it's a good show
Yep Houmra was screwed from the start
I already stated my opinion on the subject. Don't know if I wanted to watch Rebellion for a sixth time.
<@!202444817043685386>  Madoka stuff
|| By the time Madoka and the girls got into Homura's labyrinth it was already too late for Homura. She was not saved by the Laws of Cycle and in the end realized she was a witch. This is why she *rejected* Madoka trying to save her. It was already too late. Why would a witch, which works on people negative emotions want to be *saved*? ||
Madoka showing up with the gang was *already* too late
Homura was in my opinion already fucked before || Kyubey turn her into a witch with his experiment ||
that is true
I have seen Rebellion five times and enjoyed every single time
They give you no choice but to pirate
I'm not made of gold
Cheapen Madoka anime please
Weekend watch!
I guess I'll download it tonight
I'm not expecting it. I actually played Magia Record for a bit. So I know how it is
How good is it?
I really need to see the Magia Record anime
So someone with get to it
Madoka is still quite popular
Manga spin off x 20?
<:KirikaDisgust:688431636043268097> Gacha
I agreed with solo and Nikosuba
How cruel
To gather our hopes
Why are Madoka figma $$$
Kyubey is cool though. My plush version is still going strong
