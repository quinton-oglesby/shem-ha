i feel like symphogear and touhou fans overlap more than people realize
I am indeed
which is approximately the other 50% of the world
yeah, there's also china
it ain't that great
as someone from the states
if you're going to 4chan, it won't be on /a/, Its more likely to be on /mu/
hello
Season 4 was a bit lacklustser, but they seemed to be building up to something
Honestly, i can't wait for that
woops
>TFW i brought the wrong color team to thing
rewatch? like, of the series?
But otherwise, I just enjoy the franchise, so i have no reason not to be here anyways
Honestly, i just joined up for XDU advice
Hello
that last ones just a gengar
Not that she wouldn't, really, i'm just pointing it out
at that size, it looks like biki humping chris
https://thumbs.gfycat.com/UniformSpecificHarvestmouse-poster.jpg
okay, i need context
no wonder its taking so long
Wait, this isn't just the chris stuff
Indeed she is
No regrets
Maybe i'm a dumb shit for trying to download the entire folder at once
but i get your point
I used that term with the highest praise imaginable, mind
madmen doing gods work
kerrik now on the level of that one youmufag that sent me a several gig folder of shit
Well fuck
messy is not a problem
I have giant folders of completel unsorted shit
ðŸ‘€
christ, i wish i had that much chris art
I take you for a man of taste
its not even a quarter of the way done
its still trying to prepare the download
then its just massive
right
yeah
we haven't even seen him shirtless
but i just realized we've never seen the full extent of that mans body
i was gonna say something about genjuro
y'know
also, is this pre or post being 90% gungnir
can biki even get wasted?
dude, i don't give a shit what anyone says, vivid strike was rad
best part of this is kiri
she is if you believe she is
seems legit
but here we are
i never knew i needed such a thing in my life
>Cat burglar chris
you can tell the edge biki was literally just plucked from another world while doing something
"Sorry, i sneezed. What villains?"
she doesn't fire more shots. Just the one that hits the hardest
>ninja roomba
<#371105434771390465>
Since were not even talking about a series
Anime probably
Trigger would be a "Major" company
The key term is "Major"
Trigger is the fun half of gainax
Undertale would be indie, as an example
Full scale companies aren't in the purview of the term
No, it's not. Indie is a term reserved for smaller self published groups. Like jap doujin circles
They aren't, because they are big enough to be self sufficient
Very different things
Trigger is basically the fun half of gainax,  and they've been going strong for a while
Because they aren't what I'd call indie
Like, studio trigger?
>indie
not what i intended, but that works better
lewd
well then
oh. well thats not optimal
the last couple episodes are actually pretty good
Bit of a shame
wait, really?
and they played fuuka's story into vivio's anyways, so it all works out
but for her story, i thought fuuka was really good
undoubtedly
>people here like fuuka
people of culture, i see
i dunno what the in-joke is, but neat
>C-MS with the OOO's driver
so logically? yeah, she's the only person in line, so it defaults to her
besides, well, her dad
well, i'm pretty sure genjuro isn't, and they don't have any other relatives i'm aware of
TATOBA! TATOBA TATOBA!
does she also have a weird obsession with underpants?
fair enough
dat underboob
i'm with bikki on this one
Also she does junk warriors signature move at the start of S2
i know someone that'll lose their mind over it
thats good
thats a picture of yuuki aoi in a dress designed after gungnir isn't it
i was under the impression they always did
look at terry bogard
baseball caps can be aesthetic as fuck
Nice fuu-chan
a China Dess
i gues you could call that
i think the one that got hit the worst from the outfit changes was blake
yeah
but thats just me
personally, i prefer ruby
it was sure to have an audience somewhere in japan
to be fair, rwby is filled to the brim with competently designed waifu's
must be hell on the pacing
then there really is just the 13 episodes, horribly scrunched down?
that changes quite a bit
oh
not enough to warrant continued localization, anyways
if i had to guess, it just wasn't terribly popular in japan
huh
9anime has the first volume if you don't mind streaming
even on streaming sites, there's only 1 volume
lets go with that then
13 episodes
is that even the right word? Cour? part?
from what i can see, only the first season was localized for japan
which is why i'm saying calling him just a pair of hands is boiling things down a little to far
it might run, but running correctly is entirely a seperate thing
its like taking out a key component to an engine and hoping it'll still run right
rooster teeth may have pulled it back in and gotten things back on track, but pretending monty's passing wasn't a major hit to them is a little absurd
which means he was the lead creative director as well
the very future of the series was in question for a hot minute there, after all
but my point was more that monty was a very influential force in the whole thing, not "Just a pair of hands"
points to them for being able to haul it back in
i'd call that damage control
yeah, and until that point monty's name was plastered all over it
true dat
since monty was ostensibly the director, it's not quite fair to call it "Just a pair of hands shorter"
its a pretty common thing in the animation industry
i mean, you can say that, but how often does anime get slammed and the director blamed for this or that?
yeah, it gets a lot smoother
but their other animation was fucking wack
y'know, its really strange. their fight choreography was pretty stellar
there's some points where they could have upped it to the same levels without disrupting much of the flow
i think they just got a bit lazier with the choreography after a while
it was a main selling point of their show, so cutting it down a bit was a disservice
i enjoy most of it, but the over the top choreography from volume 1-2 was something they should have kept up on
i think they've just found a balance
the fights are a bit stronger in early seasons, but the story itself gets stronger as the series goes on
yeah, blake needed another outfit change
Right
and i love that
literally so strong that its nigh unexplainable
in rough terms, daidouji's skill set is basically hoshiguma yuugi
she's made of fucking steel
difference is, daidouji can't take damage for shit
yeah, its outright sidesplitting. Her idealized combat mode is the least feminine thing possible, and yet she strives to be more feminine normally
https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DOsudAoXcAEDrwc.png:large
yep. the gap moe on her normal self and banchou ass transformed self is kino as fuck
daidouji's is that
in senran, the shinobi transformations are basically an idealized combat mode
literally one of the strongest people in the series
casually at that
literally punched her way out of stopped time
imagine being so badass that you realize time stopped and just punch your way out of it
that said, daidouji best girl
the anime actually messes with the story a bit, even
indeed
2010 rather
luckily, pixiv lets you search by dates, so its not hard to narrow it down, since it has to be after 2007, but before 2009
Sad to say, i can't find anything in pixiv on that time frame
but even if you do find something, there's not likely to be anything else the guy did
if there was an IQDB or Saucenau equivalent for pixiv, you could try that
might be able to find something if you could get a result on pixiv, but i dunno how you'd go about that
from what i got from IQDB, its a piece from over 10 years ago with no known artist
Well, i can tell that its zeronos, altair form
<:MikuPraise:585839808765493249>
i learned how to search pixiv by dates
on the bright side
sorry i couldn't be more help
10 years and 2 months, according to sankaku complex
but there's just nothing like it on pixiv
I'd say thats a bit too rigid, but i'm not in any position to really argue
How so? Until you realize otherwise, its just a neat bit of fanart of one girl with guns and fat titties dressed as another girl with guns and fat titties
Thats all i was trying to say, really
thus making it a full fledged spoiler
Only given context by being called a spoiler do people realize what it actually is without the full context
to be a spoiler implies it can spoil something. A clothes swap doesn't do that
i'm just trying to point out the irony that it only became a spoiler because it was pointed out as one
Well, i'm not really arguing
Fair, i guess
if a picture can't reasonably inform anyone of anything without prior knowledge, its not really a spoiler
All i'm saying is, going a little overboard on it
and still, no one would know that unless its brought up
to the average eye, its just a clothes swap
which is only apparent if brought up
which, strangely enough, features almost no grenades
its chris wearing the outfit of a chick from an anime called grenadier
pretty sure thats not XV
that is some actual horse shit
i'm still pissed that summer kanade is locked behind a nigh impossible hexaquest
it is a comfy place to chill
its the attic of a cafe
regularly
but how does one explode a bike
okay
thats a low bar
yeah, they look to be reading scripts, so thats probably the case
i can't speak moon, so why is chris zeshou-ing?
people lose their minds over references
second, because its a reference
Well, first because of course they do
i love maidbikki's giant mittens
which is a precious rare commodity
Its legitimately good and interesting edutainement
somehow it even treats cancer with some humility
But yeah, i gotta agree
like her ahoge and being generally terrible at being a red blood cell
its a theory with some solid logic behind it
like the fact that the main girl is actually a stand in for a sickle cell, rather than a normal red blood cell
there's some things that can go over your head
i wasn't even pissed that i was learning shit
its actually pretty good
grown women from the 90's maybe
that is the raddest shit i've seen all day
Is that chris weaponizing hibiki's power of "Fuck you" into a grenade launcher
butterfly girl a cute
apple cider obviously
That or its just miku losing her mind over edgebikki and regular bikki's matching sweaters
Its the joke about "The two similar but obviously different things look the same" and chris is like "Seriously?" and miku is like "OH SHIT I CAN"T TELL"
anyone got the gif of chris doing the "Bang!" thing, but bikki getting gungir yeeted at her is edited in?
it became relevant to something i was doing but i couldn't find it
thank you
perfect
that one
yeah
Yo, does anyone have that one image of hibiki holding her arm because someone has a nephilim plush?
Yugioh had that problem a fair bit too, if memory serves
on any real level
yeah, because they're trying to translate that shit and it don't make no sense
i dunno bout beyblade specifically though
i prefer japanese, because there's just some shit japanese say that hits way harder due to how their language sounds
don't you mean ~~let it rip~~
regardless of the fic
Well, astolfo's genuinely like that
The True Gungnir
In the case of SSJ, it was a complete relic, so even if it is destroyed you could theoretically make a gear out of the bits
Dude, busou renkin is my jam
>Crashing chris's birthday party
<:ChrisEnraged:423196924368388105>
terrifying
>instead of beating up chris, miku shoves a sandwich in her mouth
Good to see someone's on my level
I can imagine this with hibiki and miku respectively
There was this one fgo meme of someone saying fuck, and nursery rhyme said it, and atalanta got pissed
because it really captured the musical aspect of the show
if we're talking OPs, i think synchrograzer is probably the best of them
Because she was the OG ignite
she probably shouldn't have missed, but probably let it slide for the sake of a joke
with all the training biki's had with genjuro
y'know
i'm not sure she realized bikki could defy the laws of physics as she pleases
i was avoiding that
damn you
which only really decides the brand of crazy
the only differentiating factor we know of is whether miku is there or not
what causes her to have a screw loose is the survivor shaming her family is put through afterward
nah, hibiki was otherwise a normal girl before the first zwei wing concert where gungnir got yeeted into her chest
that was before biki Friendshipped the shit out of her
she can barely do her homework, let alone all that paperwork and political BS
hibiki is not commander material
i meant genjuro in the capacity that he turned bikki into an outright combat monster
>Hibiki is the new genjuro
They would but i like the idea that nanoha taught teena the breaker because it makes up for an inherent deficiency of hers
Her gear has a lot more factors to keep in mind than "Punch" or "Sword" after all
Chris has a lot to think about, especially when using her gear
who needs strategy when you can bullshit your way through shit?
The belt was amazing
Love that part of build
YABEI
and while your mileage varies on those, the art itself was never bad
who did re:zero and Goblin slayer
the original studio was white fox
the weird thing is
yeah, they rarely phone it in
back on arifureta though, its outright jacked up. You may have better mileage reading the manga or LN, depending on how the production issues fuck it up
yeah. I haven't seen how it all resolves itself as of yet, but shit seriously hits the fan
a bunch of shit will go down basically immediately at the start of next season
it wasn't entirely out of left field
so
but the only event of a win that early on was rimuru eating something
yeah, thats totally fair
it does have a lot of shit to run through after the orc disaster arc though, so there's that
sadly, the anime sort of bungled the interest curve on slime lad
the anime never got to the portion where shit actually hit the fan
In the defense of that
which made it get pushed back to now
and basically all the staff changed
it's studio got swapped halfway through production
arifureta does definitely suffer from production issues though
its not anything that really breaks the mold, but the characters are likeable enough
Thats the thing. They function wholly outside of the realm of needing to be a gear
thats what synchrograzer is
i mean, to be fair
possibly both
the moon thing was fine's last ditch effort
yeah, durandal basically fucked nehushtans regen
unless of course you are genjuro or durandal
The thing about immortality and regen is that its a slow burn. A battle of attrition. No matter how weak it may seem at first glance, it doesn't really matter because at the end of the day, it will be at 100% when you are at 0%
In this case, the geahs took the third option, via durandal
so you have to make a choice of sitting there till it kills you, you reset the game, or you hope to god you have some bullshit in your bag that'll let you deal with it
Its like playing a video game, and you go in underleveled, and the boss outregens your entire party's damage
but it does quickly hammer home a point of futility
Regeneration doesn't give the big "Fuck you" that straight facetanking does as quickly
Largely, its a matter of perception
because frankly, he's a good example
you mean using ban as an example?
i would argue the opposite. Its all a matter of perspective
your point is that the needless extra damage makes them look weaker than intended, yes
well, meliodas is bullshit anyways
Ban is straight up completely outright immortal
its not a type of writing, so much as its an admittance that there's actually no point to him defending
ban has absolutely no need to
right, but the difference is, the others, at the very minimum, tense up
if you're able to regenerate fast enough, defense becomes moot, and in some cases actively negative
ban just stands there like an ass
they protect vitals, shield their faces, whatever
in a lot of those, the others actively defend
you said there were lots of points where they all took the same damage right?
Well, lets use ban as an example again
and he got shanked via a cheap shot
the only one who outright beat her down i think was genjuro
To be fair, there was time where the geah's couldn't even touch her
What he's saying is that it doesn't seem as strong because it chips away so easily
Also, Ban is strong, he just actively does not care to dodge and makes a show of it
regen builds always do look squishy at a casual glance
Yep
>What in the actual fuck
>Holy shit this girl got a piece of gungnir yeeted into her, survived, attuned with it, and is slowly becoming the strongest of the bunch
well, that and scientific curiosity in and of itself
once fine gets her hands on the nehushtan armor, it becomes a lot stronger because she can actively not care about the consequences
chris also wasn't using full power nehushtan
to be fair
turning a complete relic into a gear would be the direct opposite, and likely means toning down its power to almost the same point for the sole reason of not causing the user to become berserk like hibiki did
the gears are taking a small amount and stretching it over a wide base
well, i see it like this
it may have also just been a bit of lazy animation in general
very possible
thats probably an animation error then
applying that idea as a coating all over ones body basically makes a nigh impervious armor
well, durandal as a myth was nigh unbreakable
is that if durandal was a gear, its selling point would be its durability
also, the irony of this conversation
Fair enough
Yeah, bikki in a half berserk state adds just enough to durandal to win out
she doesn't, everything she has was a hand me down from someone else anyways
and its a damn shame
basically, i'm saying they're wasting airgetlams basic premise
~~i'm talking for her skillset in general, rather than just her transformation~~
also, fragarach was called the answerer, because if it was forced to someones throat, it was said they weren't able to lie. Maybe they can do something with that?
that would be pretty amazing
because the knife would actually be fragarach
being serious for a second, i mean that they need to do more with the actual hand portion of airgetlam
Airgetlam isn't a sword, its literally the arm of a dude
whats up with the sword?
see, the thing with airgetlam is
they lean into their gears main gimmick entirely and capitalize on the strange nature of their weapons
at least kirika and shirabe have unique moves
she should reintegrate that kinda thing
yeah, the cape moves with black gungnir were baller
yeah, but thats just a poor mans ichiaval
and that doesn't come into play very often
the only thing they've had unique to airgetlam is that it can transfer the energy that hibiki snatches
the barrier thing was basically a rip off from the nehushtan, the sword is usually a poor mans ame no habakiri
yeah, but there's nothing airgetlam does that isn't really just an alteration of something another gear does
i mean, yeah
subbers do some fun stuff
while this works in a lot of mobage, due to a lack of complex interpersonal relationships and there being an expy of the player anyways, it doesn't work so much with symphogear, where both of those things aren't true
unfortunately, not quickly enough
yeah, it was apparently supposed to make the girls more open to relationships or something, but they very quickly realized why this was stupid
Chris is A fanservice character, but also the cutest.
She was good even from the design phase
I like the subtle touch that gugnir's fringe bits aren't orange like her motif but gold
but somehow makes it work
She's like that one dude that goes full melee in an FPS
And hibiki's over there ignoring the rules entirely, and everyones just like "How the fuck is she doing any of that"
Shirabe is the exception due to fine hacks
she's like that kid from gundam seed, in that regard
the rest cut off somewhere
I mean, only one side is properly lined up
surprisingly so
i'll give trump one thing, he does do well with foreign diplomats and peers
like GATLING
the difference i'd say is that the ZENBU hits hardest in makyuu, but a lot of the lyrics hit hard in bye bye
both makyuu and byebye are fucking amazing
GUNGNIR DATTO
because thats not how basa's room does
he didn't keep it clean
to be fair
well
but considering the previous reference to grenadier and the overall memey nature of the recent transformations, i'd be inclined to believe they had basa reference another Sword (Person)
also posssible
not a bad thought
there's parallels between basa and yasuri shichika from katanagatari. Who's symbol also happens to be that type of leaf
yes, but the thing is
thats a fuck mothering katanagatari reference, isn't it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ALwKeSEYs
I'm sorry nani the FUCK
>elf9 song
Hibiki's is good because there's very little excess, which really fits her as a character
with that swallow that flies at her
If i'm being real, i was hoping they'd reference sasaki kojirou, if anything
It isn't, but them all standing straight like that in midair is quite a parallel
that second one i'd bet money on being a reference to byakuya kuchiki
https://spng.pinpng.com/pngs/s/297-2978100_jojo-jojosbizarreadventure-menacing-freetoedit-jojo-bizarre-adventure-words.png
better question is what the fuck is up with her hand
with the exception of hibiki who sort of just kenpachi's everything, as a comparison point
90% of geah moves are basically that
i mean
that had a lot of animation dedicated to it for a giant reference
Except for that one time biki used the junk warrior attack in G
Kamen rider's old as fuck, so its not really a surprise that it set some trends that are used to this day
To be fair, the original kamen rider came out a full 15 years before most other examples of the move
Plus its related to airgetlam itself
you don't get a nickname like "The Answerer" without being baller as fuck
yeah, fragarachs a cool weapon, conceptually
I'm still betting on airgetlam actually being fragarach
even the VA's are like "yeah, they're basically a married couple"
its like "This shit is completely new and out of control"
honestly, i really liked the big bunch of shit happening to bikki in her initial transformation
but seriously
not the stupidest thing i've ever heard loki do
okay seriously what
This is amazing
WHAT
>Autoscorers and carol back
Not to mention, he never really leverages the unique properties of anything he has
which is why i said "By all rights" he should be, but nasuverse is dumb
he's got prototypes of almost any noble phantasm out there
well, thats the thing. he is omnipotent, by all rights. He's just not "Omniscient". Or inclined to give a fuck most of the time
but that works too
i meant from the bot
its funny, because i can just hear the scathing sarcasm
>you have 0 coins which is enough for 0 pulls
I know it's an automated response, but that Maria bot with the sick burns
more news at 11
youtube has no idea how to handle its own content policies
breaking news
too many cooks in the kitchen and whatnot
well, that and they have an entire group of people leading it, like kerrik said
See, the psychology portion is a weird area, because the brain can do some amazing and weird shit if it believes it can
Pics taken moments before disaster
Not to belittle the argument, i'm just saying
They can be used for objects, for the record. 
>Where are the apples
>They are over there
but it is something to keep in mind that we're overturning millions of years of thought in the span of 10-ish
like i get that
which is why i said its best to just let sleeping dogs lie
its also unrealistic to expect everyone to be 100% up to date on that kinda thing
yeah
because its gonna cause a shitshow either way
honestly, its best to just let sleeping dogs lie on that, regardless of where you fall
the guy was fine until he got into it about gender stuff
yeah, isn't the point of a ban that you don't have to think or worry about said problem person anymore?
s'all good
yeah, i'm just tired and a little delirious
man that came out wrong
at the very least, don't talk about it
in general
i was talking the entire thing
this... really got out of hand. Like, wow.
my bad
to be fair, i egged it on a little bit
at the very least, it gets less extreme
well thats ass
Let's be fair
During the previous election, it was hillary
I'm just saying, everyone flings shit about colluding with Russia if they think itll hurt the other guy
Yeah, the rest is legit
Because it's the first thing everyone shitflings when they get a chance
I dont believe anything about russia
So far as I can tell? Nothing that should make people hate him like Nixon after the Watergate scandals
But that's his secret. He IS always angry
The issue with government systems is that most of them sound good on paper. Then people inevitably screw it up
Would the system be broken if everyone did their research?
I give it a 70/30 split
While I agree, it's also willful stupidity, so i won't place it entirely on the government t
I also hate that people just vote for a letter without looking into anything
Agreed
The dems dont have a strong candidate currently
Okay, I fucking get it
I cant confirm any of that, so I'm not going to comment on it
When half your government is actively detrimental to your work
I'm saying it's an understandable reaction
I'd be pissed too
Of course they do, on some level. The ones coming over illegally are basically making their jobs more difficult and making them a joke
its an internal issue with japan itself, and they really hate foreign interference
while i agree with the sentiment, there's not really anything foreign anime consumers can do about that
because thats time and effort better spent doing literally anything else if i can help it
sure, but i'd rather not need to to start with
frankly, most motives are dumb motives to kill people
everyone does
thats going to reflect poorly on just about every other anime watcher out there
If it actually was because he didn't like violet evergarden or some shit though
if its for personal reasons, then thats that
which is why his motive will seriously change the effects of the aftermath
yep
and thats going to be a stigma the rest of us will have to deal with for a good while
but i more meant the media will slam into that hard
maybe, maybe not
if it was some disgruntled fan, thats gonna look bad for the rest of us
and thats the effect it has on the anime community in general
there's about one thing that will change depending on his motive
The rest was sorta botched though
so that part is more or less fine
That guy played an important part in that he's a clear link to the past world and a clear important person of power for gaining the nations trust in the long term
Honestly, that arc was supposed to be less about the kids and more about the spirit queen fairy
2 or 3
the kids got like, 2 episodes or something
You can tell they were just trying to rush it too
which basically fixes half of your complaints
Like i said earlier, they rushed through the kids at a really poor part of the season, and didn't properly set up the next arc
and tries to get back to the whole "Ruling a country" thing
Anyways, my point is the kids stop mattering once he leaves
but one that had to happen, so they just sorta rushed through it
The kids were more a plot device to set up future shit
is just super awkward in general
Honestly, the arc with the kids
I'm saying that slime's an inherently slower show at hitting the peaks of the interest curve because outright combat and fighting aren't always the solution
there's more inherent obstacles, so the interest curve is immediate and direct
i mean, yeah
the end of the season sped through some stuff to set up the next big tihng
Not to spoiler too much
rather, on his way back
The events that happen next are sequentially directly after he leaves
no
bout that
uh
The nation that spawns around it is
Rimuru being unbeatable isn't the endgame
Yeah, but the thing is
nobody of any grand importance anyways
i mean, yeah
Or at least the manga and LN do
Besides, the show leads with the fact that 90% of everyone will be on his side eventually
Bold of you to assume
Milim exists wholly to drive that point home
I'd give it a shot, honestly. its not like rimuru is unrivaled
too many take the premise of being an overpowered shit too far, but it uses it more as a means to an end, rather than the end itself
The slime ones pretty good
if memory serves, even from the manga adaptation, they slimmed down on some character moments
Also, hamon isn't well defined, no, but in the same way that ki or anything else isn't
wow,  i didn't know that victorian london was a post apocalyptic dystopian future
I'm the odd man out that prefers 1
BEM?
there's some good shit coming up in the next couple seasons at least
Yeah, but thats also, like you pointed out, just a product of the times
they needed an area where sunlight could hit
Anyways, with how dio is set up, the balcony thing only makes sense
one games all you need, really
if castlevania was a thing at the time, anyways
If anything, that part probably took more inspiration from castlevania than it did FoTNS
frankly speaking, there wouldn't be many better places for them to have fought dio anyways
the boat?
what location? a random castle that dio took over due to his god complex?
jonathan
GOD DAMNIT
the only outright similarity i saw was josephs design
or even a "rip off"
was still on the bloodstained thing in my head
my bad
i meant jonathan
they only seem similar superficially
and even then, joseph himself is very different to kenshiro
but thats about it
i'll give you designs, again
bleach took inspiration from 5 different things just for ichigo, doesn't mean its yu yu hakusho, inu yasha, or any other number of things
Taking inspiration and being the same thing aren't the same thing
Also the mask joseph and ceaser used for training is an accessory
i mean she does it in the flamboyant over the top way jojo does
and i mean literally jojo poses, not "She makes a pose"
if you hold up for long enough, the character jojo poses
i did that with bloodstained twice, actually
thats an issue in the fandom
thats not even the shows issue
Flanderizing it down to that level makes anything about burly dudes hitting eachother a FoTNS rip off
I'll give the character designs, at least partially, but thats about it
hokuto shinken is "I poke you and you die"
so i can believe that the trigger guys wanted more expletives
Panty and stocking was one of the last great things gainax worked on before it imploded and split into trigger and itself
that was ages ago
i plan to eventually, i just haven't
the story lost me after a certain point and i never went back
i've never gotten all the way through baccano though, so i can't attest to that
i do hear that
Right right
Oh yeah, i'm not saying BL's sub is bad, i'm just saying that theres some things you just don't get out of the two series' if you don't try the dub
I agree that japanese generally hits harder as a language, but for those two, the english fits the over all tone and theme's better
even just to experience the dub
In the case of panty and stocking and Black lagoon, they are two of the few i would ever recommend watching the dub for
this is also a thing for black lagoon, if memory serves
the big difference is that english expletives hit harder
Each version has its ups and downs, for panty and stocking
gridmans growth animation, the way fights look from a human perspective, a lot of it is really cleverly choreographed
There's a lot of small nods they do in the animation
but how they used it was perfect for what they were doing
Yeah, its not that its "Good" in the sense you would think of it
Houseki is also really good
gridman, for example
Depends on how well they use the CGI, really
Kumo desu ga i would seriously consider yorin
The initial edge is sorta required setup, more than anything
Also, Kumo Desu ga is good
Also, all of triggers stuff has big stuff has been a hit
From when gainax lost its shit and anyone fun left
Not to mention, trigger is staffed almost completely by industry vets
It really is
Anyways, trigger
amazing
pretty funny, all things considered
i've actually read that one
that depends largely on the context
easily
as someone translating a jap tabletop game with google translate
But I'll agree with luluco tv
I dont generally count ova's
No one said anything about worst
But it probably doesnt
If it went to improving the product I wouldn't mind
Well, it also saves on upfront costs, so there's that
sounds terrible already
They have a patreon?
Nitro plus has some big names attached so that's not a terribly big surprise
If not a single person
Yeah, indie by its nature usually means a small group
While true, it was relatively unknown until trigger made a name for themselves
Long answer, no
Inferno cop I give slack on numbers because it was their first thing
The fun half of it at least
The worst thing I can actively think of that trigger did on their own was luluco, and that's because it was a massive plot to make a mascot character and plug LWA
Yeah
Right
Oh
Ibo?
It read like something that might won some contest or something
Not of any known material at least
Yeah, look what happened to kiznaiver<:TsubasaSmug:585839805737467920>
With a scant few exceptions
Trigger is almost entirely original stuff
With intermittent shit they get hired for
They do
Also franxxx was half A-one
Yeah, they were hired to make it
It's not great, no
Kiznaiver wasnt stupid big, but I dont think It did poorly commercially
And how much of that was them is up for debate
The only recent issue being franxx
Ironic wording for a show about magic
First rather
Lost some of the magic of the movies
worst case scenario, stream the episodes you have issues with
i may be stupid
i dunno why i thought agito and rein were the kids fate took in
Vivid is apparently a while after strikers
they do skip a large portion of his powering up
so whether they stick the landing on that is basically what will make or break it
It should also be mentioned, after this initial prologue, the tone shifts a good amount
hard, but not impossible
if they can tighten it up going forward, thats the important part
as of yet, i'd say its missed its first step
I wouldn't say that much
and shuffles a VN adaptation
mirai nikki and corpse party cater to a rather specific audience, after all
so its no small wonder their scores are so low
Most of their stuff is also pretty niche though
Yusibu actually looks way better than it probably should, given its ass backwards story
but usually its not animated terribly
the anime themselves will vary based on story
anyways, visually they aren't terrible
its over or under, theres usually no inbetween
and mal scores are horse shit anyways
Mirai nikki, corpse party, and shuffle are probably the biggest projects they've done
Admittedly, asread hasn't done a whole lot, but there's not a lot they've done thats outright terrible
largely, the issue is that they were shoved a project that was being done by someone else and forced to make something out of it in a shorter timeframe than normal
they do some pretty good visual work
Asread isn't bad
but frankly, taking your chances with white foxes stuff was probably better than forcing a massive overhaul
Thats totally possible
prize money
oh, its easy to symphathize with her. thats the point
not really, no
it really does. Its given us some of the best reaction images in ages
it detracts from something like fate, but the same issues can actually enhance a comedy series
and honestly? Deen gets shit for a lot, but their animation style really works for comedy
i was asking what all they're doing, yeah
and i love that
it looks stupid as hell
machikado is one i'm actually a bit excited for
The milf isekai doesn't look terrible visually, but the concept puts me off pretty bad
wait, what all are they working on?
quite the opposite usually
an opening isn't generally indicative of a shows actual quality, i've found
watched the first episode of the accelerator anime. last order and sisters a cute
speaking of
thats all i needed
yeah, but she was there, she was cute, and the sisters made an appearance too
lets be real, the best part of any index is misaka
XV was basically a glorified 2 cour anime
Well, thats not necessarily the case arm
either way, their involvement isn't exactly heavy anymore, and it shows
it may well be that they just handed over the completed assets and thats it
if thats even the case
whether he liked the new designs or not, the chances are they were good and usable
he should have dealt with white fox
its pretty middle of the road, really
about as popular as any other isekai shlock
yeah, they basically had to retool what was handed too them
Yep
almost 20 episodes of "What the fuck" before it stuck a tone shift and rode it home
look at katekyo hitman reborn
a bad prologue can kill a series, but it doesn't necessarily have too
Yeah. Sticking that tone shift will decide on whether its actually worth any time or not
yeah, thats a thing
better ways, sure
and i'd argue they succeeded to some degree
being a spiritual sequel to ashita no joe, they really tried to get that older grittier feeling to it
like megalo box
that is true, but some go the extra mile to try to capture that older aesthetic
<:ChrisAngry:336656958272700417>
Yes i know i'm unnaturally angry about this
literally just using terms like they picked up a thesaurus or something
not to mention all the shoehorned in religious shit from a teenage fanfic
literally fucking why
who the fuck calls your secret super weapon a, and i'm not joking about this, "Nimrod"
another issue is that the story is outright terrible
yeah, there's always growing pains
it'd hurt less
i'd rather take a knife to the chest than watch hand shakers
there's nothing even remotely redeemable
this is not one of them
i will generally play devils advocate for most shows
it is actually complete garbage, yes
there's very little in that show that isn't at least touched up with CG
you think i was joking?
almost everywhere
>Somewhere
it was a garbage fire that sold like ass
literally fucking how
it is legit the worst kind of chuuni shlock, and its not even trying to be ironic about it
Hand shakers is a dumpster fire on all levels
the issue is the CG dumpsterfire it was
it was always for a niche audience, and it knew that
yeah, the issue with berserk was never its audience or translating mediums
like committee's slapdash throwing projects at people, or the arifureta guy shooting himself in the foot
honestly, it seems that a lot of shit is coming out worse than it should be because people higher up don't have a basic understanding of what they are doing
that doesn't bode well
taboo tattoo suffered from being dumb as shit
even the filler stuff was passable
its hilarious, really
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaseline
Either way, its not exactly a science to push out older feeling material in a quick way, as of yet
but okay
i was talking about the actual art style itself
if you're talking about old school artifacts
i mean, sure
but i appreciate the effort and attempt
but i did enjoy G-Gundam
i wouldn't  call myself a gundam fan. i'm not generally into the super robot thing
i haven't, but i will give it points on art, from what i have seen of it
its only tangentially related to the nanoha universe as a whole, but it does what it does and it does it well
yeah, no, vivid strike is a fucking ride
Yeah, vivid strike doesnt hold back on that shit and I love it
fuuka's a damn champion in the making
no fucking kidding
its just these girls going about their lives, basically
they aren't world endingly high
yeah, the stakes in vivid and vivid strike are very personal
current leading theory is that they were aiming for specific people for personal reasons, but no ones quite sure yet
chances are, it wasn't some disgruntled fan or anything
From all the information pouring in, it was a completely premeditated crime, that even took into account a blind spot in security
I can see it now
>Nanoha brings vivio home
>Grandparents freak out, ask who the father was, and why they were never introduced to her boyfriend
>Nanoha looks at them confused "The fucks a boyfriend?"
military machine, rather
well, i'm pretty sure macross and robotech and stuff had the mecha's be purely machine
seems legit
>idol girl voiced by yuuki aoi gets into fun shenanigans
oh, which ones the most toxic
the one where the kids mom is way hotter than she had any right to be for the demographic
more of a kids show, if memory serves?
wasn't build fighters something else entirely?
its really good
which is why G-Gundam hits a sweet spot for me
and i also don't generally care for that
once that special quality is gone, its basically just a military show
well, thats the other issue i have
in G-gundam, this is somewhat remedied because the skill of the pilot in combat is a direct influence
There's a lot of emphasis put on the pilot that just doesn't make sense to me
its like the dude actually inside is a placeholder
there's a large disconnect in it for me, where the pilot has some "SPECIAL QUALITY" that for some reason makes him innately better in an equally matched mecha, or maybe he's the key to unlocking some ability in it, or something like that, but at the end of the day, its just a dude sitting in a cockpit
i don't generally like mecha
on wording
well, i just conflated most mecha together there, so that was my bad
its a cop out, either way
thats an asspull they use too often
there needs to be a reason its them, not just because they happen to pilot good with no prior training
yeah, that does help
and why the other is an outright disconnect for me
i'm just pointing out why one of its main draws doesn't work for me
of course
so that doesn't help me in this situation at all
to be fair, my family is pretty pro-military, and i'm inherently sick of hearing shit like that
i'm trying to explain why i don't care for regular mecha
Oh, totally
which is why i like G-Gundam
but there's no intrinsic personal factor
thats just it, there's generally no explanation for it. He's a natural ace, he's got a high synchronization factor with the tech, something like that
why?
why this specific guy
the actual pilot can generally be anyone
yeah, thats true. but thats a perception based band-aid on the problem i have
sometimes literally
and with a large portion of mecha, its just some rando in a mech
my point is that with superpowers, super suits, and the like, there's an inherent personal factor to them
no, but he also has the powers of thunder and lightning besides
Tony stark himself is key to how ironman functions
the one who makes, updates, and improves the suits is tony stark, and tony stark alone
But there's a key difference in that scenario
oh, totally. i thought of that myself, actually
the person inside is a secondary factor to that
my issue with that is
live down, or let live down?
fucking what
G-gundam shies away from both of my issues with gundam as a whole
but there's also quite a few instances of literally who's
that lapses into my dislike of the military setting, which is entirely on me
which is all totally fair
there's a very different skillset at work there
also to be fair, being in the military doesn't necessarily mean you know how to pilot a helicopter, as an example
i'm talking when literally who gets in the robot and it just works
well, with amuro and OG, that makes sense. Its not "Without explanation" if he went out of his way to figure it out
fuck outta here with that shit
we're talking high grade military tech and a rando can literally just walk into it and pilot it fine with no explanation at all?
but i don't like the fact that there's no training or explanation sometimes
i don't have an issue with power fantasies per se
even if the dynamic is reversed, and the rival is the weaker one to start with, they simply need to get strong enough to act as a consistent opposing force
well, thats not necessarily true
this is why you don't let people write their gundam fanfic and put it to production
which is amusing to me
one thing i do find funny though, about the whole pilot thrust into an unfamiliar situation thing. If they do get it after just a little explanation, it makes everyone else look sorta retarded by comparison
look at SAO
it doesn't matter if the characters literal cardboard if he's doing something "Cool"
japan tends to go far harder into its power fantasies than other places do, so maybe thats why
Yep. Humans dig trends. Its weird, but you live with it
that got pretty popular for a hot minute
To a lesser extent, there's also the little sister thing
information is so much easier to get these days, and everything happens far quicker than it did even 10 years ago
especially because of the sheer rate at which things come out, comparatively
so i'd give it 5, max
I'd argue we've already hit the top of the bell curve and are on the way down
like the early 2000's with all the shounenshit
anime just goes through phases like this
in all due fairness
When you stare into the abyss, yada yada yada
>Didn't expect the isekai about a kid and his mom to try to ship him and his mom
its actually funny, in the really stupid way
the one with the paranoid asshole
oh, its that one isnt it
why would they do something like take a risk?
Its profitable
index prints money, and accelerator is a fan favorite
well, i expected accelerator to be up there
its bog standard
having read a large portion of the manga
also i heard fire force is already shitting its pants animation wise
i wasn't expecting takagi and aggretsuko to be that far up though
Last order is adorable
all arguing aside, i think we can all agree
the only thing i will give endless eight is that its a perfect setup to dissappearance
imagine going through that shit and remembering it
is setting up just how depressing nagato's life is
one thing i will say the endless eight did properly
i can't remember if it had a source material or not, but i think that gets fixed going down the line
most of them didn't have the gear too
well, if memory serves
it really is
understandable, but harsh
yeah, its pretty harsh
not to mention, it was aesthetic as fuck
its only near the end that it got a bit awkward
the first entire half was pitch perfect
oh totally
my issue with kabaneri is that it sorta lost track of itself in the last several episodes
especially athena
the biggest thing is that the characters were well designed and likeable
campione was way better than it actually had a right to be, all things considered
i'm all for soft looking main characters, but if they should have muscle out the ass, then pull a kenichi and have him ripped under his clothes
and yeah, muscle where muscle is due was a bit of a fading thing
someone like that
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
having ripped chicks
another cool thing they did that anime doesn't normally do
except that one conductor chick who had that fucking MUSCLE
but the rest did job pretty hard
so that is understandable
I mean, the archer princess chicks entire point was to be a contrast to everyone willing to immediately bash heads
that always bothered me
why bother even introducing a world where everythings decided by games, bets, and wagers if you're just going to abandon it?
its a good approximation
yeah, i've read ahead some. It sorta just loses its premise after a while and goes full shounen
besides the overarching theme of games
i do not see how he even remotely reached that conclusion
not a particularly great one, but a fun one
dog days is a fun anime
the smug and memes
its mostly the smug
its a common visual shorthand for shadowy BS
a mix
not sure why, but shadow and dark are always mixed with bending reality
but not if you've seen any amount of anime
the only one that would seem weird even at a glance is shadow anyways
No problem, glad i could help
Because in the order you posted it, those would be Wind, light, ice, fire, electric, shadow, and earth
are you just looking for what their powers are specifically, or?
with the occassional stake thrown in for suspense
its just dumb cute fun
its a good one
sure, some side stuff edges in, but its always in the interest of broadening the world
But yeah, the game premise is actual a legit thing that isn't abandoned completely
I know, i'm just saying you're delving a bit too deep for AC
you'd probably be better off putting that in non-SG spoilers
dog days is way too fluffy and friendly to even warrant a remote comparison to mondaiji
Either way, yea
Yeah, but that feels like a copout to do away with your own preset conditions
it even features a breakdancing black guy
i'd say it does
there's precedent for the lion thing being possible
I mean
>Not scientific at all
>Gave an actual recipe for black powder and had to warn kids not to use it
Its very basic so far as a shounen goes
but that doesn't really excuse that kinda thing
yeah, i get that translation is sometimes more art than science
I don't doubt that, honestly
eh, thats a bit harsh. maybe 60%
90% of everything tohru does is harassment
they sort of are
because things can change
it doesn't need to fit the overall tone
"I'm not into women" Does fit with the overall tone of kobayashi
to be fair
that one i'll give you
not to mention a patriarchy basically not existing
so why get so upset over a poor choice of a single word?
right
the infamously stupid and hilariously bad gag dub
Or ghost stories
hoo boy
you think shiny's bad?
man, i remember the garage dubs of the olden days
because Xan took exception to how it was handled, i guess?
primate kids strong, and to a degree smart, but not infallable
any number of stupid reasons
its not"Scientific" no but neither is medusa going full tilt on the world
there's also a specific plot point he brings up there regarding how the petrification works
last i checked, he just got knocked out, for all intents and purposes
in that case, who expected anything else?
oh
i came here to watch anime, if i needed that shit, i'd go on twitter
and no one cares about your political agenda
but dude, you didn't even write this originally
like, i appreciate their work
yeah, sometimes translators think they've got more power than they do
so yes, you do have to catch up
its an extremely major turning point in the series, and Ufotable seems to have thrown the entire budget of fate/zero at it
that'd be season 2
that doesn't stop the poor adaptation from being a poor adaptation though
its sales were pretty good
it does, but the markets changed
During the time of the "Big 3" though, no one wanted to take big risks, so they just kept churning out single season ads for the LN's
Oh, the series itself did fine, i'm saying they adapted it poorly
it wasn't terribly uncommon back then, but it certainly got less common as the bleach, one piece, and naruto  dominated the market for several years
but they did it poorly because they're lazy hacks
Familiar of zero was one of those where it was taken advantage of to churn out as much as possible in the hopes of making back a profit
but they need to fucking stop it with status windows and game stats
i'm fine with isekai
because to be fair, her initial character is for all intents warranted
is in how louise's development is handled
The main difference, besides the general story
Nobunagun is extremely good
