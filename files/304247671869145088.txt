I'll move anything else regarding me arriving to the general chat, sorry for being a bother in this channel mods~
Yes, I'm a mod <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
Will do, now if you excuse me I'll be ~~scavenging your NSFW Channel~~ checking out the discord.
Yeah, plus with the new season on horizon. But later on, I may be coming to ask if you guys are interested in a Community Spotlight since I don't have one after Yuru Camp (/r/laidbackcamp) that's getting posted this weekend
Hey R, it has. Was checking the sub to see the activity (for possible community spotlight), and discovered that a new sub discord was made.
Hello, thank you for the welcome~
Maybe could use the backpack, but already got the bag. You go camping often?
What are you returning? ~~So I can stalk your REI when the garage sale comes around next month~~
Mainly energy. Get better sleep, more energy throughout the day, thoughtful eating habits, and more willing to excercise; worse sleep, you replace with the energy you need with calories/caffeine, tired throughout, and don't let yourself think as well. Naps can still help also, but generally no more than an hour.
It isn't easy to lose weight, and there will be infuriating times. Rather thinking of a diet as being stuff you have to eat, think of eating as "Get it over with" and less of something that needs to be enjoyable. Not all meals need to be good.
What I found best during my weight lost (lost ~40 lbs) was packing my lunches/Dinners. I didn't necessarily pack "healthy", but there was the time packing to think about some questions:
"Do I have a Microwave/Freezer where I'll be at?"
"Will I really need this much for my meal?"
"I have a lot of breaded food, should I pack maybe an apple or something?"
When packing, there's just thoughts to go through, and you can control more of what you eat than say going out to eat where you buy the cheapest thing while it's high in calories. 
Also, heavily underrated tip is sleep.
Also, may not be best to bring up anime recs, but I believe it's very relevant for the kind of situation we're in, I'd recommend checking out Honey and Clover. It's on college students/graduates moving onto the workforce, and transition from student to adulthood, and also how some deal with it. https://myanimelist.net/anime/16
Or hell, any kind of exercise is great for stress relieving. Climbing is body warmed up and tired out at once (even on the easy stuff), ax throwing for just going as hard as you can but be on target, biking for both adventure and exercise.
I doubt you're in the Pittsburgh area, but just posting an example of one near myself: https://breakroomirwin.com/
That basically throws out all the transformations, any risky or mildly fan service shots, and obviously beach episode...

Nothing can be this "risque", or else will result in a ban...
I did gifs and pics in mine, and they're done from multiple users also.
I'm legit concerned doing the Sympho rewatch and having users unintentionally banned from Reddit, with respect to hohofan4life's ban over the Kaguya pic... I know Sympho has some fan service scenes, and there's the possibility of the admins taking too hard of force (Especially with Season 1 designs, Shirabe, Kirika, Elfnein, and Carol leaning towards Loli looking)...

This was an unexpected twist.
