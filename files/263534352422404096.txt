Hey everyone! Gwen here again. You might have noticed that Shem-Ha has been acting differently lately and is posting even more now. That's because I now have Shem-Ha using OpenAI's Davinci Engine and she now has a 0.5% chance to respond to a message now.
Hey Everyone! Gwen here! I'd like you all to meet Shem-Ha! After much work with the Staff team I've managed to bring her to life. Her gimmick is simple. She has a 0.1% chance to proc on a message in <#336297387863703552> and <#407060923078017026>. At that point she'll read the past eight messages and construct a response and add her two cents! She is able to do this by using a fine-tuned 774M GPT2 model based on data gathered through out the server (with some channels as an exception.)

don‚Äôt add it yet
4am CST expect it
so like
I‚Äôve got stuff planned for the next few hours though
Melua, I‚Äôll get that Chris emote cleaned up tonight
I'll figure it out
if not I have my ways
you think you can get me a higher quality version?
I can clean it up
I‚Äôll do a reverse image search later
forgot about that rule
oh yeah
after all
he is best boi
more Genjuro emotes are always good
anywho
<:pachaCommander:672427013679874078>
this is what it turned out to look like
cropped this down on my personal server
I don't have the patience to deal with all that anti-aliasing
fuck that
haha
I said I'd work on that chrisYay one
oh yeah
delete that former one to be courteous

I do have another
however
I delete
understandable
and reverse image search turned up nothing
I tried to find the artist, but I downloaded it from 4Chan
anyway
*Hibiki is best girl*
smugs are always a good face Lily
I see you
remove your messages like that

this was not my idea
what no
üñï
üòâ
I like this
this is fine
this
<:HibikiSmug:672655850518609940>
ah gotcha
I can clean that one up if you want me to
üëÄ
just realized there's no angry ping emote
hm. could use more Bikki emotes
gj
and still recognizable
don‚Äôt touch my <:HibikiSmug:672655850518609940>
those are kinda out of season
oh
10slots left lmao
there‚Äôs like
thoughts are gone
I won't
fine
look
...it's only 12 boosts to the next level
doesn't show up as big
lmao
<:tomatoSaluteRipped:678434387725123624>
<:tomatoSalute:678434067120914472>
maybe
is it
fuck you right
üçÖo7
and it happened to be there
I just needed something small to work with
same energy
cause her tongue isn't really visible
I'm gonna clean up the image later
<a:mikuYum:678371396463624231>

you can do that
pro gamer tip, if we ever get desperate enough to lock static emojis behind nitro
no
we're so close but so far off from level 3
we're running out of room
<#673253184885489696> <#336298054724485131>
don't want to flood the channel with useless information
it's more of a content thing
but like she said
I've been messing around with one in my personal server
and automate the process
you can set up a webhook for it
or something similar like that
pretty sure that's the intention for <#680064219449917497>, it's just that the higher-ups are busy right now and are unable to implement it
yes
yes
holy shit
a Kanade smug

bless the XDU chibis
<:kriisawarm:663203355987935232><:meluawarm:663203356130541618>

<:MikuPraise:585839808765493249>
or possible ones
I'm done messing with emotes
swordfish

<:adamScream:688240116736458752>

<:AdamScream:672861878812147717>
I'll get on it
sure
I can clean this up

do we have a Tsubasa blushing emote?
theft
so I am a happy camper
tho
<:TsubasaFish:689163064830066696>
I have my
pity

2) there's already five emotes similar to it
1) it's not 1:1 aspect ratio
two problems
it adds to the suspense
slow
computer is deciding to be
so I can post it
lemme crawl my ass outta bed
no
?
it‚Äôs a Hibiki emote
it‚Äôs not another fish emote
no
what
that I‚Äôll post later
I‚Äôve got another emote
pls
give me my swordfish
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/336299268107403274/688246325309079562/swordFish.png
floof

eyebrows
I'll clean it up
:HibikiStop: ???
what energy does this exude
I love it
is so strong
the emote game on this server
<:ElsaWhat:689195325621141505>
<:TsubasaDere:689195981841236109>
I could actually remove the outline
this qt patootie
behold

Ikxi will love it
1?
the Elsa was more of a reaction image
days without Whiskey accidently deleting Tsubasa's arm: 0
days without Discord being weird: 0

for some reason Discord won't let me upload a 150kb emoji
yank spidder's
yeah
is Discord just on the fritz today
wait
<:HibikiDab:688190074395164696>
I'll even remove the background
do so
I can
more zenbu
more sword
*good*
lemme make it the proper resolution
basaPresent?

<:TsubasaFish:689163064830066696>
thank
no problem
it's unhealthy
so much screaming today
is slightly more rounded off
this one

or this
how's this

fuck
wait
how's this
nothing better to do
I'll do it now
at all
that's not bad
ohy
He'll still get the notification
you wanted more Germain
input
<@84811738653929472>
I don't like this
<:mariaCross:689199805397991471>
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
then do so
what even is the purpose of this emote
<:KirikaChant:663568587310628892>
I say this biasedly
We need more Chris tho
I say this unbiasedly
no more Kirika allowed
I like the first one
more sword please
yes
bulli the zenbu
<:HibikiSmug:672655850518609940>
can't go wrong with smugs tho
more shrugging anime girls is always good
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
very good shrug

more bully
yes
<:MikuDelete:661660028410920990>
<:think:527902122692444161>
I have an idea
oh
<:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
I get we really are destroying a bike
<:TsubasaAngry:692141154531016765>
it's not that good
the anti-aliasing and all that
so
one of them has a smudged edge
wiat
there
<@279341087494242304>
two versions


tt
gimme a momen
<:HibikiSmug:672655850518609940>
reading is hard
do people not read channel names
more bulli
yes

I am now out of spare boosts
<:HibikiSmug:672655850518609940>
but there‚Äôs more emote edits by me up there

I believe there's already been a ruling on this.
That‚Äôs good.
Oh shit.
This might need some fixing up...

Constants are boring
Spice it up a bit
It would make things interesting tbh
Some constants, some that change?
> These have high potential but gotta look at what to cut again <:NotLikeFist:689188869974786133>
Monthly rotation for emojis?
<:CarolSmug:617040484111745027>
I thought the ruling was that the colors would be too close to the current ones?
Howdy
That‚Äôs why
Ah
Can <@!735757788331900931> do role assignment or am I tripping?
"It's always been NSFW?"
üî´ "Always has been."
it's been there
no
it has an age gate on it

Comic
Lots of Kirika

are we ever gonna get a `headpat` command again?
that's clever
ahaha
<a:ChrisShifty:744677308631089162>
whack
nothing the smudge tool cant fix
sounds like a fun little project
have some hibiki
> or has the XDU section of the server so split from the rest of it that it needs a place they can talk without leaving the XDU zone?
you mean it already hasn't?
I'm fascinated that anyone would want to do that to her.
Where is Color Me Ver and Color me Mom?
It can. We just have to get the artists permission first.
Hence the difference
I made the original, but it looks like someone did some editing after I posted it


Phantas secret hideout is no longer secret
Don't we already have <:ShirabeWink:672661604319363103>
<#448237561085952001> actually
oops my bad
I just noticed that the Hibiki Padoru is `:PadoruHibiki:` and the others are `:ChrisPadoru:`, `:TsubasaPadoru:`, `:ShirabePadoru:` , etc.
Please don‚Äôt take away my <:MikuGay:336656810788388864>
Python
~~yeah just put it to sleep for a bit~~
Absolutely no promises though
Sure I can start working on something
Fair enough.
Would you like to see proof of concept first?
<:think:527902122692444161>
It would be a fun project
But incredibly more coherent Ôøº
I‚Äôd need perms to invite a bot her and allow it to scrape the server but that‚Äôs something I don‚Äôt see the mods Letting happen
And I could probably do that
Actually that would be pretty neat to do
<:HibikiSad:738234648509022368>
Dabble in a Markov chain then
I finished the proof of concept for the thing I was talking about a few days ago <:MikuPraise:585839808765493249>
If plan A doesn't work then I can try plan B
Actually there is something I could try
<:think:527902122692444161>
It would actually look like two people talking in the same sentence
I do agree with Rady that what she says could be longer and I‚Äôm experimenting with that. But this is honestly a lot of trial and error
I'm experimenting with the temperature, top_k, and top_p values privately. Right now they're all at the defaults so If I come up with something that generates with longer messages I'll be sure to implement it.
Which includes punctuation

Gross

tomosato...

I think they have a place in small servers that don't require moderation, but in large servers like this I think it would lead to many problems.
I misread the conversation
My apologies
Hrm
Oh.
You can set role groups in nadeko and make a specific group mutually exclusive
Yeah it‚Äôs a fork of nadeko so just look up the nadeko commands
Elfnein has a quotes command
rotate some emotes out for the padorus since winter holidays are approaching and people w/o nitro could be able to use them

Yes it is

fun little kit

Do I want to keep the backpack and feet black or recolor them?
1/144 Kits do not give you much room to work with.
This isn't a very good picture.

This is my first time repainting an entire Kit. I hope it goes well.
Granted there are some 1/100 HGs, but I am not talking about those.
Sizes like 1/100 and 1/60 are just more my lane because of how much more they have.
Not really?
1/144 doesn‚Äôt give you much to work with
I also hate the sizes if HGs
I got a little creative with the backpack. I‚Äôm afraid I might be going overboard with the gold tho...

no idea what that is either

Spray paint?

Uhhh
Have to build the sword and launcher packs now
Finished!
Yeah the RG Skygrasper and the RG Strike
More Skygrasper work
The news was stressing me out so I sat down and finished this

On real grades?
RG Strike update. I am absolutely in love with this kit.
So many stickers...
It will be arriving in may but

THIS IS THE RIGHT ONE

Good luck at your tourney

Oh it does?
No that‚Äôs in <#357682999300718592>
I‚Äôm just following an ifixit guide for disassembly

White base coat


Better!
Reassembly is gonna be a pain in the ass
Today‚Äôs project:
DMJII!!!!!!!!!
but
just the lighting is bad
and it kind of is
It's supposed to be pink
<:TrueTrue:716004780547506286>
Mail them to me
I can do it for you üëÄ
With enough paint, an electronics tool kit, and enough time you can paint your own joycons too!
but what I do have is time!
and I don't have the money for that
but they were $70.00
i was at walmart and was like "ooh dmjii colored joycons"
but that was the basis for this project
Never played splatoon
Exactly the colors I was going for.
Fully reassembled
Can always move to <#407060923078017026>
I‚Äôll be posting more later
I don‚Äôt mind
<:KanadeShrug:796891369041952770>
It‚Äôs not a big deal
Back on my bullshit.
Based
Went back to the basics in Unity to make sure I had a good foundation of things and to make sure I can do stuff without following a high-level tutorial and make original code and this is what i came up with
on a mac

The cube go jump
<@!84811738653929472> this uses BFS btw
I have done a thing
It actually looks like military hardware
Man I love the Strike‚Äôs design
this webdev shit aint hard
Accidently uploaded the wrong version this one has sound
Cubethon! Now with sound!
<:ChrisPresents:672578363176517642>

Adjust the camera angle to help with spatial awareness
Add some particle effects if you collide with something
After thinking about it I can do a couple things to fix all this
<:TsubasaNote:689554460044820608>
This is a version I'm actually pretty happy with
<:ChrisPresents:672578363176517642>

When I wake up
Rather
I will look at the latter in the morning
I'm trying to nail the core stuff before I expand upon it any further.
Would appreciate feedback.

I made a video game. Rather simple at the moment. But I'm still looking to expand upon it.
Can I ask how this is supposed to fit in <#458060276550336522>?

I picked up some learn to solder kits off Amazon.
I refreshed the Discord Plays project. This time it's here to stay. https://discord.gg/tGXHVbt8Kf
I have no idea how to model stuff
Was thinking about outsourcing it honestly
Not sure yet
Now I just gotta model her last name and print it
That way she can put it on her desk
My mom is a teacher so I‚Äôm going to 3D print her name and shove a bunch of leds and a raspberry pi pick in it.
I am handmaking my moms Christmas present this year and I got a proof of concept working.
So, I'm revising that short story I posted the other day. I'm thinking of turning it into like. Journal entries of the leader of a rebellion. This is what I've revised it to. I would appreciate some feedback if you all have any to give. <:laugheline:454887887847030814>

```Entry #1

I used to love space. The stars. The comets. The nebulas. The planets. The asteroids. I used to love them all. I would spend hours in the library after school, browsing Wikipedia articles about stellar objects. Learning everything I could about them. I would check out every book that I could. And every book that I read, every article that I read, every research paper, there was always one question that was always at the forefront of my mind. 

Where are the aliens?

If space was so big and so vast, and there were all these different planets, then surely there had to be life on at least one other planet, right? This contradiction between the lack of evidence for extra terrestrial life and the high estimates of their probability was first noted by Enrico Fermi, an Italian-American scientist. Thus the contradiction was named, ‚ÄúThe Fermi paradox‚Äù.

However, that childish love was extinguished by humanity‚Äôs first encounter with an alien race. A type four civilization on the Kardashev scale. In other words, a civilization with the ability to harness the power of its own supercluster of galaxies. In comparison, we humans hadn‚Äôt even gone further than our own moon.

Everything about them was enigmatic. They were sapient stars. Beings of pure plasma powered by nuclear fusion. They could fly, change their shape at will, and communicate with us telepathically. They were practically gods to us. 

And to them? We were nothing more than ants.

They scooped all of us up one day and relocated us all. All eight billion humans. In less than a day. Some were relocated for research. Some were relocated into zoos. Some were taken as pets. And most others, like myself, were taken for forced labor. 

Slavery.

But that‚Äôs ancient history. 

Because now, more than anything else, I love the sound of my axe tearing into these gasbags. 

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

Because, now, more than anything else I love the smell of fresh blood.

Because if something can bleed, it can die. 

And if something can die, then even an ant can kill a god.```
I haven't written creatively in years, so this was a good flexing of muscles I haven't used in a long time.
Yeah. It‚Äôs not bad. One thing I would change is try and see if you can get clips without subtitles.
Gotcha. I‚Äôll look into it when I get home from classes.
Oh nice!
In blender? Can you save files as an .STL?
And that‚Äôs why I don‚Äôt like the Gundam Build series!
That looks like it‚Äôs something out of a super robot show rather than Gundam. I don‚Äôt like it.
They're all 1/144, there's gonna be tiny parts.
I mean
My HG exia is actually missing like two or three parts because I lost them.
HG Exia has so many tiny parts.
Exia is Sexia

not even in the right channel either
oh
but here we are
not something I‚Äôd discussing at the same time
History and Symphogear
so I‚Äôll see what comes up
gonna watch them today
I‚Äôve got them downloaded
that‚Äôs who I found too
yeah
she did some sly stuff
the trickery worked well in Cagliostro‚Äôs character well
lots of figures with that name
but like Saki said
might have found the historical reference for Saint Germain
very much the same character?
so
‚ÄúCagliostro was an Italian adventurer and self-styled magician. He became a glamorous figure associated with the royal courts of Europe where he pursued various occult arts, including psychic healing, alchemy and scrying. His reputation lingered for many decades after his death, but continued to deteriorate, as he came to be regarded as a charlatan and impostor, this view fortified by the savage attack of Thomas Carlyle (1795‚Äì1881) in 1833, who pronounced him the "Quack of Quacks". ‚Äú
from the wiki page
I‚Äôll look into it deeper when I‚Äôm not on mobile

is Shirabe dead
you were talking about her getting bullied by the penguin
but no
I thought you were talking about Maria's lack of a child








I am now
I mean
aight
fair enough
so I must be mistaken
I first saw it as individuals
I didn't know this
this is good to know
we worked her to the bone today
I now have the sauce

it's really not
but it doesn't mean the entire place is shit
each place might have it's shit producers
just because the human body produces shit doesn't mean its entire purpose is to produce shit

since it's only seeding the things you initially added
not an entirely duplicate stash
just create a new torrent
you don't need to make a separate stash
no?
10 minutes of dicking around is a sign of anything
if my
looks like you might have to create a new torrent for everytime you add pic Kerrik
or you can do it
lemme fuck around with it
probably not
¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
pretty sure you'd need to create a new magnet/torrent for every new rollout you do

I know someone who‚Äôs transitioning, and it took me a moment to get used to her new pronouns. I grew up with her, so it was really strange for X to be Y. It might not apply to you, but imagine if someone came up to you and started insulting you with something you were really self-conscious about. That‚Äôs what she described to me as when someone intentionally referred to her as ‚Äúhe‚Äù.

<@!99695384296701952> 

Honestly, this fucking stemmed from my dumbass not being able to properly read this statement.
I'm not trying to say they should be *forced* to used that facility. I fully realize its a comfort thing now.
okay, so reading this back.
lemme back up for a second
how frustrating
I can't get my thoughts into my words properly
argh
I won't debate that
the law is shit
no I know that
and I understand that sexual assualt is a risk in any bathroom/lockerroom, but is it not for cis people as well?
but if someone is pre-transition and masculine/feminine I *personally*, let me reiterate *personally*, think that they should use those facilities.
and I'm sure this is gonna be an extremely controversial opinion, so feel free to debate me on it.
lemme dumb it down
lemme
or am I coming off as a dick?
am I making sense?
so this is a personal(?) story and not everyone has the same experiences. when I was in high-school there was a girl who realized she was a girl (is that how you phrase it?). at first she was still pretty physically masculine, and she was in the closet for quite some time. so she continued to use the male locker rooms and bathrooms with no problems (she confessed this). however it wasn't until her transition became apparent (happened over the summer) that she then began to use the female facilites. and people were pretty chill about her transition. most were like. "oh yeah. whatever." of course there was the occasionaly jackass, but they got shut down quick.  

however, a sure-fire solution is those gender-neutral locker rooms and bathrooms.
absolutely, unisex bathrooms all the way.
I don't want to piss anyone off nor get banned
mhm
gimme a second to gather my thoughts coherently
lemme elaborate on #2
it's been a hot moment since I've done any legislation study, but IIRC a bill needs to go through the House and then to the Senate in order to be passed. however SB114 was introduced in the Senate because reasons? someone correct me if I'm wrong.
so, I've found three bille that could defined as transgender discrimination. thankfully, none of these have passed yet. 

this first one, HB31, is the one is the first one we talked about. this would make preforming surgeries and providing medications to a minor a Class D felony. absolutely disgusting. https://legiscan.com/KY/bill/HB321/2020



this next one, HB132, is basically saying those born male should use male facilities, and those born female should use female facilities. I kinda agree with this one.
https://legiscan.com/KY/bill/HB132/2020


finally, this last one, SB114, is basically saying somewhat of the last one but regarding sports. those born male should compete on male teams and use male facilities, and those born female should compete on female teams and use those facilities. this one I wholeheartedly agree with. https://legiscan.com/KY/bill/SB114/2020

https://legiscan.com/KY/bill/HB26/2020
I'll give myself a swirly
if it passes
honestly
uh
I will
yeah, but if that passes
basically tampons and pads would be exempt from sales tax
NO FUCKING WAY IS THIS GONNA PASS
```Summary
Amend KRS 139.010 to define feminine hygiene products; amend KRS 139.480 to exempt from sales and use tax the sale or purchase of feminine hygiene products; apply to sales or purchases made after August 1, 2020, but before August 1, 2024; require Department of Revenue to report to the Interim Joint Committee on Appropriations and Revenue the amount of exemptions claimed.```

HAHAH
looking at proposed stuff now
in KY
so far this year no house or senate resolutions relating to LGBTQ+ discrimination has passed
goodnews
that one
yeah
are we thinking of the same one?
wait
just curious
kk
<@!472513526393602059> have you read the story of Job? if not do so
hm
I'm curious, what was the oof about?
?
¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
idk
if that's the right term?
politically correct
Well. Lemme wrap this up with this <@!99695384296701952>, <@!203444794737950720> . Since this is <#336297840529899522> I'm gonna get vunerable for a moment. And know that in no way these are excuses. I was born and raised in the Bible Belt. Grew up in a conservative church, and an even more conservative household. Raised to think that LGBTQ+ people are abnormal and freaks of nature. *I fucking voted for Donald Trump in 2016.* I'm also pretty sure my registered party is Republican. It wasn't until I went off to college in fall of 2016 that I really started to change and started to meet people. I've met a ton of LGBTQ+ people, and met a ton of great people on Discord as well. I clash with my parents on a near day to day basis because I'm now atheist as fuck and am a high-functioning alcoholic. I'm still getting over these prejudices and stereotypes that were instilled upon me throuout my childhood and teen years. So if I ever step out of line or fuck up because I'm not PC, please correct me.
I did not know this.

on the topic of the EU, a Brit friend of mine just sent me this
I guess I can‚Äôt be banned /s
damn
Ban Whiskey
really
<@183785454447886346> why you gotta call me out like that
already addicted to that too
<:Huh:387027883442569219>
coffee
more like
no
behind what
if you haven‚Äôt picked up on it by now, I only speak in memes unless the situation calls for it
all about cheap
nice
it‚Äôs an old meme
*its getting bad*
*seriously tho*
I traded my high-functioning alcoholism for a white-girl starbucks addiction
what if
hear me out
nah
but have me present them?
I can write papers and make powerpoints all day long
I'm bad at presenting
<:eugenShades:364082455310761995>
nothing makes you look cooler than nearly having an anxiety attack during the middle of a presentation
||A friend called me out on it the other day, and I was worried he would get into one of the bottles. I've dumped them all, but still.||
Hey, I'm gonna throw this in spoiler tags since it's off topic. But I could really use some good vibes right now. ||I've scheduled a therapy appointment for Friday evening. I've always known that drinking just to cope is bad, and I realize drinking myself to sleep each night isn't an even worse idea now that I have Finn to take care of and raise.||
is so fucking true
that
yeah

how about no
I've had my fill of out-of-touch politicians dabbing
we got Clinton dabbing last election cycle
https://twitter.com/eunnieverse/status/1225448730914164736?s=21

well someone decided to shop all of that out

u guys know that Trump picture that got taken yesterday? the one that showed off his fake tan and bad hair dye?
üé∑
but what do you mean by advice?
majorly
and withdraw sucks
I‚Äôm seeking help
I mean
why
currently
define problems
hello yes
the biggest thing here is that it's non-ionizing

idk
or really bad
Linus is good at sponsorship segways
yeah
I don't see many places spending the money to implement that
at all
but I don't see that being a thing
very true
a thick enough barrier will block off a 5GHz signal so a 300GHz signal has no change of getting through what a 5GHz signal can't bust through
I know what you mean
no
oh yeah
just like 4G did
it‚Äôs just gonna take a while to implement
just took me a second to find it
6min watch
https://youtu.be/lvhaVjpYm_M
fear mongering
conspiracy
it‚Äôs just
people said the same stuff about 4G, and 4GLTE
5G?
I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôd be happy to help
honestly
or a therapist
or find an AA group
or someone you trust
then tell a friend
that‚Äôs good to know
<:ChrisHappy:660870796696223744>
but I don‚Äôt have people to fall back on IRL
I‚Äôm literally going the worst possible route
yeah
especially since I‚Äôm dealing with it alone
sometimes I‚Äôm not sure
quitting?
the dog yeah
¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
but honestly the biggest point was when I got Finn and I realized that I couldn‚Äôt afford to drink myself to sleep every night
starting friday
and I‚Äôm seeing a therapist
and that was only a week ago
but the after that the withdrawal hit hard
first day or two was fine
fucking horrible
not the smartest thing to do
and went cold turkey
immediately
I dumped all my shit
Valk server?
and now their PC isn't working
I recognized there was a kernal problem with windows, and suggested a fresh install of windows
I contributed to the problem
<:Fingerguns:625774302905499681>
see y‚Äôall in the morning with a massive hangover
<a:AlteraDance:581160216561844234>
guess who couldn‚Äôt stay dry
I fucked up
lmaooooo
hm
what is the Valk server?
didn't expect to be that far left lmao

huh
I suppose it was nice knowing y‚Äôall for the month that it was, but I‚Äôve done nothing but wrong since I got here. so it‚Äôs best to leave now before I cause more pain
and I really regret not getting it under control
High School is when everything started for me
u got this fam
it's ups and downs
and my personal experience
from what I know of depression
and that's helped
I've started seeing someone
better coping mechanisms than mine
scream into a pillow
journal it
getting it out is better than internalizing it
I feel you fam
<:blakeshrug:583909281451999242>
so
but marginal
not really
uh
<:Fingerguns:625774302905499681>
so that's an improvement
I'm not under observation
I mean
<@!189146272865845248> actually a result of me having a mental breakdown from withdrawal, anxiety attack, and depression. and then me having to spend the night in a mental ward. but I like your idea. that's much better
doing IT stuff
not even a cop
:/
I was on track to get a job with the TBI, but if this is how people see law enforcement for I‚Äôm not so sure I want to anymore
:/
shooting drills have become a thing in schools too
Correct me if I‚Äôm wrong, but having people died from that?
idk
something like 230

...
The US has been a mess for

I'm sorry to see you head out in this manner. Taking a break and stepping back is a good thing. Recuperate. Take some time. Come back when ready.

yeah
lol
2017
when did AXZ stop airing
I got tore into
last time I opened up about my personal ideals
great prompting to do more research
exactly
unfortunately, there‚Äôs only so much you can do with 20 minutes
so
because I‚Äôve been watching his stuff for years
I‚Äôm biased as fuck
also
sometimes yeah
but you‚Äôre hard pressed to deny that his segments are informative
Oliver‚Äôs humor is subjective
Oliver‚Äôs segment on Modi is very much worth watching

hang on
Trump in India
oh
so you‚Äôve said
I really don't like Ellen
because
gimme a second to process that
...
so she picks and chooses?
so
~~speaking of far left, I should probably change what party I'm registered with before the primaries~~
err
that
ah yeah
but I don't think that's how it works
I don't think it's my place to butt in
honestly
what the fuck
you can't self-declare yourself for something like that
when I was 13
when I did
those kinds
ah yeah
1) I'm an anti-natalist
2) What Edward Snowden did was right, if poorly executed
here's two things people continually tear into me about
grabbed my laptop
I‚Äôd rather have people actually try and talk it out rather than just straight up say ‚Äúare you a fucking idiot?‚Äù
if I want to talk about my personal ideologies
well
but I gotta go do stuff
maybe when I have time
not exactly gonna happen again for awhile
so
unconstructively
> you get infinitely more value out of your taxes than you put in
this
I am going to leave this conversation. I am not willing to engage with someone who is just going to reiterate their points, give no proper alternatives when questioned about it, and is unwilling to learn through a debate.
Civilization has progressed to the point where it would be impossible to survive without any form of centralized government.
Congrats, you have just caused the collapse of society.
If taxation is theft, I would genuinely like to hear an alternative method of funding.
Not to mention the various programs that support the needy.
I would like to hear your proposal then, on how to fund the military, police force, fire departments, hospitals, highways, schools, and every person that works for them.
at this point there is no reason to continue participating, all they want is to bait people and that is what they are getting
was gonna go with firing squad, but yeeting people into the Boston Bay works
that‚Äôs it
yeah
like
we need something more American
this isn‚Äôt France
Saki
yeah
the subreddit for it is pretty good
Fizzy
wiat
I can't wait to get executed by Grandpa Bernie
pog
forced relocations
now that‚Äôs what Americans are good at
you do the same when the time comes
thank you
I need to go to bed
I don't want to spend my night beating the NRA's dead horse with another dead horse
anyway
unethical
disgusting
abhorrent
sickening is too gentle of a word
it's not viable, safe, or sound
no
just
arm the teachers!
arm the kids!
so
you're talking to a former NRA member
sad
so
it's just
nope
Pulse
Vegas
that eventually there's gonna be a shooting bad enough that people will open their eyes
I used to think
of course not
it means sensible regulations and restrictions
"Yoink, your guns are mine now."
gun-control doesn't mean

that you can be both pro-gun

I‚Äôm gonna wait on an announcement from his office before I actually believe he‚Äôs dropped out
that‚Äôs all speculation
he hasnt dropped out yet tho
but I get the meme you are going for
that‚Äôs like adding -2 to -2 and expecting to get 4
and we are already at dummy levels of dystopia right now
government dictating private life is super dystopian
yeah same
democratic primaries are like the hunger games

hang on
I won‚Äôt hesitate to admit that
I already voted for Bernie
cause I mentioned that NYT article
it‚Äôs why the conversation popped up
¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
that is pretty repulsive
while one facebook group doesn‚Äôt speak for an entire country
Obama has yet to endorse anyone
pretty sure she said she was done with politics
that's nightmare material
right now
stop
https://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/library/stories/2019/04/behind-2018-united-states-midterm-election-turnout-table-1.jpg
I can't discuss politics anywhere in my family because my entire family, excluding my brothers, thinks Sanders is a "nut"
combination of old voters outnumbering young voters entirely and Americans being too scared of change
of course Bernie won't
I'd rather have Biden over Trump
while disappointing

definitely can see why she's demonized now
yeah
~~I wanna go back to Ireland~~
she was a huge political figure during The Troubles
no wonder she was hated
oh

because I'm not aware of much she's done
looking at her right now
yes
> its the white liberal mindset
ah yes, I'm glad we are stereotyping and shoving people into boxes. but what do I know. I'm a cis straight white male, but what do I know. I'm the enemy of all women and LGBTQ+ folks
which didn't work out
he tried to do things in a bi-partisan manner
he was by no means a centrist
Obama did A LOT
bin Laden, the recession, LGBT rights
because Republicans can't see a need to not have it
he tried to, but was continually stopped and shut down
hah
Obama hasn't endorsed Biden
and shows exactly what Melua is talking about
Gattaca is a great movie
excuse me for trying to hope

want a bigger conspiracy?
I‚Äôll be sure not to do it again
nice
üëè
yes
transmission wise
but the "reason" that bisexual/gay men are more at risk is that having anal sex without protection is much riskier than having vaginal sex without protection
yeah it's as Lily said
that's something that came up
yeah
but I'm taking a timed quiz for one of my classes at the moment, so I need to focus on that
I'll do some research here in a few
that I don't have an answer to
great question
but it's definitely not true, as of now, for HIV/AIDS
I don't know what STDs you might have heard about
you know that Gay/Bisexual men are the ones most affected by HIV, right?
hm
you mind elaborating on that?
I've been keeping this open since it first became big

I feel like there‚Äôs a better way to phrase this
and last I heard those tests weren't even accurate
there's a supply problem with tests here in the states
the thing is tho

18 cases in my state
it's amazing how intense it got in less than one week

that's four times the amount in a week

no
that sounds right

that‚Äôs not a COVID symptom
```2,606 in the World Trade Center and in the surrounding area, and 125 at the Pentagon.```
```which killed 2,753 people in the city and 2,977 overall, when hijacked planes slammed into the twin towers, the Pentagon and a Pennsylvania field on Sept. 11, 2001.```
I think the towers were somewhere like 2,500
also includes the Washington D.C attack
2,977 is the total from 9/11
but
which is an odd measurement to use
4.34 9/11s in terms of death
we've had
yeah

for that
discord has started to change their marketing
so you can add 50 people to an address book or you can send out a link one time
where as with Zoom you just click on a link and you're in the meeting
but with Skype you need to add people manually to an address book
Skype is an option
only real option that exists for the problem afaik
business meetings
lectures
classrooms
it surged in popularity thanks to the Rona
so you can just brute force your way into a meeting you haven't been invited to
but meetings often aren't password protected
it's an app for video conference calls
Zoom is similar to Skype
I'm sure the actual numbers are *very* different
granted this is all me armchairing it and napkin mathing it
<:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
esp. nitro classic
and I'm sure that there's more than 1% of users paying for nitro
if Discord is operating at a loss, then something is wrong
>200million
assuming 1% of users are paying for the Nitro Classic... that's nearly $10million a month
don‚Äôt forget to criss-cross

It's a lose/lose.
¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
I mean? Yeah? I'm not gonna deny that. I'd be a fool to. I'm more referring to the fact that our continued interference in the Middle East is a perfect calling for many organizations. Even if we pull out it's still a good call for nationalists.

the only friends I kept from high school ended up getting arrested
you aren‚Äôt missing much
trust me
¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
I‚Äôm sorry, but that advice sounds like it came from people who went to high school in the 80‚Äôs
HAH
everyone goes their own ways after high school
graduated...four years ago?
I don‚Äôt even talk to people I went to high school with anymore
that‚Äôs not centrism
that‚Äôs out west
no not really
and if you disagree with the other political party you‚Äôre a bad guy

<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
where‚Äôs the progressive party at
*authoritarianism*
undermining civil liberties
anti-LGBTQ+ rights is a political stance
I disagree with that one &&
got into an argument? or decided to engage in a bad faith argument?
and not your brain
listen to ur heart
is what I was tryna say
ur valid
imposter syndrome is a disgusting thing and is completely untrue
That‚Äôs for staff to decide.
Also, not to police the chat. But I don‚Äôt really think throwing ‚Äúf‚Äù out there with out adding any thing else is too constructive. I could be completely wrong.
Would you care to elaborate rady? Maybe there‚Äôs something we can do to help you with?
would definitely be best to wait
only have to pay federal taxes
it‚Äôs pretty great
the state of Tennessee has no income tax, but it does have sales tax
I feel like just throwing out ‚Äúwhat a shithead‚Äù isn‚Äôt very constructive
it‚Äôs rude and inconsiderate
she does
yes
it‚Äôs controlling
this is a level of guilt tripping that is unhealthy
yeah
this doesn‚Äôt seem like the writing or rhetoric of a 16yr old
out of genuine curiosity
just
is this person the same age as you Lectric?
but what about the others
you've unsubbed from one place
visiting places full of vitriol and hatred does nothing but diminish your mental state
> I'm not really sure why you subject yourself to all that sort of hate tbh
literally this
if you're gonna drop something mid-way to go and visit a place full of vitriol and hatred that's not an urge to look at garbage. that's an addiction
why do you visit those places so frequently
seriously Lectric
violence should be a last resort
you‚Äôre right
oh yeah
that time didn‚Äôt exist
wait
I miss the time when black folk were treated properly here in America
we are

Thanks for the advice Shem.
Yeah. That‚Äôs gonna be the plan. Ride things out for a bit. See how they go. Because I‚Äôve already burned the bridge. Not like I can go back in the past and fix it, now can I?
<:KirikaShout:607741871703457812>
Frankly. The human brain is rather defective and I‚Äôm ashamed to have one.
Haha. It really is isn‚Äôt it? I was raised in a household where I was discouraged from speaking about my feelings and was heavily judged anytime I did. Shit carries y‚Äôknow? People constantly assure me that it‚Äôs safe to just let it out, but previous experiences speak otherwise.
Thanks for the two cents all. Means quite a bit to me.
But yeah. That‚Äôs not a bad idea Nevis. I‚Äôll see how things are in a week or so regarding this.
Actually. I think I‚Äôll stop there. Probably not too great of an idea to unload in a public server like this.
<:HibikiWhoops:585839808115507222>
Eh. Why not I‚Äôll give a bit of context. I befriended someone back in December or so. They were decent to me. And then I slowly and steadily learned that they were extremely toxic to not only myself but others. And that just being around them was degrading to my mental health. So I cut ties with them full stop. And I‚Äôm pretty worried. Because I made a few friends who are actually good people through this person, but I feel like they only speak to me because of this mutual connection.
<:HibikiWhoops:585839808115507222>
Fair enough. Not quite sure I asked. Maybe to see if I was alone or not.
Correction. Less of the former, more of the latter.
Eh. A bit of both.
I‚Äôm curious. Have any of y‚Äôall ever had to make a decision that you ultimately know is good for you, but actually going through with the decision just makes you miserable?
and that's not something I'd click on
because that thumbnail screams anti-LGBTQIA+ vibes
I'm perplexed as to why you will just post something possibly inciting with no context or explanation
but okay
that's not my point
and other things
with no context
why post this
honest question
so
Garrison has always been pretty ACAB, which is surprising considering his devotion to Trump

Colonial Americans only resorted to that when they felt they had no other options
so let's take this back a couple hundred years. do you think dumping tea in the harbor at Boston was justified?
This is the opposite of civil.
Hey. Let's bring it down a notch.
I'm not doubting your words, fear is an understandable reaction. But would you mind giving us a link or something?
I don't disagree with you actually. I don't condone the looting and rioting. I don't like that it's resorted to this. But at this point what else is there?
we're getting off topic

but lots of tweets
haven't seen anything confirmed
I'm actually looking around

I watched someone get fired for being trans at my last job
I had job orientation/training today at work. And the company was very proud of the fact they hung up a singular pride flag in the break room. The thing looked like it had been folded up since last June and not seen the light of day since.

~~I should have realized something was up when I was self-researching all those years ago instead of squashing all the feelings that came about that time...~~
and I did some reading on it
the way I understood the difference was when someone explained to me what gender dysphoria is
jeez. that's a great question.
yeah. I getcha
oops
I realize that I just reiterated what Iskierka said
I have never heard "biological gender" used before
sex being what you were born as. gender being what you identify as
that's why "sex" and "gender" are two different things
well. for some people they aren't different things.
there's also the fact that any genuinely good cops just can't last an extended amount of time. they become pariahs when they try do the right thing.
unforgiveable
there are some things that are just
but at the same time
ideally the answer would be yes
that is a complicated question that cannot be answered simply
rehabilitation is the correct answer
any reasonable person would be hard-pressed to do so
I don't see it working
although great in theory
many proposals to divert police funding to social project budgets
yeah. it's a bit more than a grain on my end. Kanye has said and done some really strange things publicly.
or something like that
‚ÄúI appreciate your concern for my wellbeing, however I am quite comfortable with who I am currently. If I ever do start to question my gender identity then I know just who to come to for advice.‚Äù
Metal Gear Rising also had a lot of transhumanism elements

Like Melua said, at worst it would call people out to attack them. Consequently shaming them.
What a horrible mindset to have.
Nevermind, Melua summed it up pretty well.
I have a question for you Lectric. Why do you insist on sharing these accounts when you find them? I understand wanting to share a meme or a joke with someone, but this is an actual person. Is it to shame them? Make fun of them? If that's the case doing so makes you no better than a bully.
No. You shouldn‚Äôt have done it at all.
It's a bad faith argument and you're engaging in it.
At best you fuck someone's mood over, at worst they kill themselves.
Nor do I, but at the same time I understand the consequences of talking about someone behind their backs in a malicious manner.
There has been plenty of occasions where you'll post something in the middle of a conversation, and essentially say "Look at how stupid and wrong this person is."
I concede that my message before was poorly worded.
but get back on your meds asap
some withdrawals can even lead to death

because your body is so used to the chemicals from the medicines that it doesn't know how to cope without them in it
it's when you stop cold-turkey that it's a problem

There's a way for resolution to happen via systematic methods, but it's a stretch.
I mean. There's also people who say that this current government is better than no government. Which...has some sense to it.
This isn't the 1860s.
Exactly. I've been hearing whispers of secessionist rhetoric from some far-right circles I used to frequent. And it. Just wouldn't work?

No. There's still a steady rise of cases.
Can the second-wave really start if the first one hasn't ended?

So. Tell me what's more at fault. The people of the government? Or the very government itself?
Well yeah. Ronie ain't going nowhere.

This conversation is reminding me quite a bit of the Swampman thought experiment.
"Well. We just don't understand." I see you've been talking to my parents.
No Rady. I didn‚Äôt.
I didn‚Äôt have an in-depth explanation of consent until freshman orientation in college.
Not in school, nor by my parents.
What a joke.
Is that entire test binary.
Unfortunately, those are my thoughts as well Ein.
I realize this is out of the blue. But what are y‚Äôall‚Äôs thoughts on life support? Just. In general.

Right? There's no denying that there was good intentions behind this move. But I feel like that if twitter actually wants to cement themselves as such a platform they should at least have a userbase to reflect that.
This is gonna divide votes so much.
Trump is guaranteed to win now.
This is only gonna make a messy election messier.
This is genuinely insane.
And it's too late to get on the ballots in some states.
Yeah it is.
This is actually insane.

how do these people function on a day to day basis?
my coworker compared us to jews in nazi germany today because my workplace now has kiosks that take our temperature and give us a sticker that we‚Äôre supposed to put on our lab coat if you aren‚Äôt running a fever.

I live in rural New York.
I work in a factory.
I live in an impoverished area.
The Suburban Lifestyle dream of crushing the poor and elevating the wealthy.
The production manager at the factory is eager about unemployment benefits ending because people are making more on unemployment than they are working. And I‚Äôm like. You‚Äôre so close to the solution to the problem.
Not saying living independently living and going to school. Just going to school without going 20K into debt.
I have a hard time believing that minimum wage used to be able to get someone through an accredited university.
Yeah. It‚Äôs pretty sad.
Other countries I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs safer.
At least not in the US.
And I want to be financially secure first.
I don‚Äôt want to burden a potential partner.
My mental health is a wreck.

But that‚Äôs me.
At the very minimum. I‚Äôd like to get my mental health in check before I start seeing someone so I don‚Äôt burden them.

Healthcare, vision, dental, education, community.
Good benefits, really good benefits.
I‚Äôve seen what the Army does to your body. It fucks you up.
Because everyone knows that high-schoolers are the paragon of decision making.
There was a recruiter in my high school at least once a week the entire school year the entire time I was there.
Yeah.
Stop them from recruiting in schools too.
Identity is a fascinating thing.
Asked my roommate to call my by my birth name just to check myself.

Gotta love it.

however this current administration has definitely decreased my faith in it
my state is actual shit
but like
I trust the federal government more than I do my state government
I mean
hot take: get ride of state-level government and integrate it into the federal government
and without federal law I don't trust many states in the south to behave properly
a lot of state government is pretty shit?
there's also the fact that like
I personally don't want to advocate for that move

Xi Jinping actually knows what he's doing tho

God. I‚Äôd love to be.
What then?
So. What do you do when none of that no longer works. Where you‚Äôre constantly tired. Have no desire to take care of yourself. No desire to shower. To eat. To shave. When the thoughts in your head become so intrusive and overwhelming that you can no work. And all you can do is lie in bed and cry? When what little hope you had left disappears and you no longer feel deserving of anything? When taking your own life is constantly at the forefront of your mind because it would make everything better?
Like I'm sorry that I don't want to go out to eat?
I can't tell if it's selfishness or ignorance.

I gave that one a try and didn't enjoy it. And I don't want to get on a petri dish in the middle of a pandemic?
"Why don't you want to go on a cruise? You've been on one before they're so much fun!"
God and she's fucking shaming me for not wanting to go on a cruise in December. "I've read their health and safety policies. I feel SO much safer now!"
I feel like I‚Äôm back in middle school with these feelings.
<:MariaSip:731709620065927240>
It is incredibly painful to watch the person you‚Äôre interested in flatter and lust after another person.
Sure
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
It doesn't help that I talk to her regularly.
Been interested in this girl now for a decent chunk of time, but I got 0% of a chance with her. Those feelings are a pain in the ass to squash.

god bless my home state

can you tell how many seats?
thats good
isnt six feet

iirc
many places do one seat apart
You're right.
Yeah.
It makes me fucking angry.
But if you're willing to take that big of a loss on the coupon, then why even charge the obscene amount in the first place?
There's a coupon for it, which knocks the price down a decent amount.
My pharmacy came in clutch though.
Unfortunately, I'm out of work right now.
I don't even know why I posted this here.
No. That's fine.
Where does that put me
I don't have $400 a month

Why is it okay for medicine
I honestly hated Riordan's romanticization of stuff like that.
Kane Chronicles too.
I cannot wait to see the pro-lifers support for this one
Honestly? If the title of your article has "thot" in it in a derogatory manner then it probably isn't worth reading.
I think one of the worst things about this pandemic is that people are still going out to restaurants and sitting down and exposing yourself and others.
I have never heard of this person in my life
who is this
hoping for a swift recovery
*drake pointing towards* slapping NB on that shit and never thinking about it again
*drake pointing away* spending months distressing over your gender identity and trying to kill yourself multiple times over it
Mess.
A.
What.
It's over.
With all the talk of fraud and such.
I plan on voting in person in early votes. I genuinely don't want to risk that.
üëç
That's a mood.
Gosh.
Which is kind of inspiring.
I saw a report that there's already been a million something early votes.
What was that?
Did I just watch Trump attack Biden's son for having a drug problem and getting over it?
Oh. Never mind. There it is.
I can't tell how much of this Biden believes and how much he's just saying to pull in Bernie supporters.
I can't turn away.
She did.
How many times has he said China Plague now?
He fucking called Elizabeth Warren "Pocahontas" within the first five minutes.
Trump is interrupting himself, the moderator, and Biden.
There's a lot of depressed laughter coming from me.
I already know who I‚Äôm gonna vote for.
I got called over to my grandmother‚Äôs to play IT Support. So I guess I had that decision made for me.
I'm losing braincells watching this debate.
I've literally never heard of this person.
It's so fucking exhausting.
Every goddamn time he's given a chance to condemn them, all he does is give them orders or praise them. And then immediately blames the other side.
Our president literally told white supremacist's to "stand back and stand by".
And that the discourse between the two is just "tensions from political differences."
Because there are people who view Trumps performance last night as "strong" and "inspiring."
They want drama.
People won't tune into a civil debate.
You have my sympathy.
Losing a family member is not easy. Regardless of how close you are to them.
from my understanding the initial day or two isnt that bad its afterwards that is the problem. esp if it turns into pneumonia is when its the problem

What was the goal of this coup?
well thats easy to say when theyve never been given the opportunity to so so

yeah, hed lose from all the leftists refusing to vote for him because hes the lesser of two evils
Their response to the pandemic was really good, no?

nope
https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/22/dutch-hacker-trump-twitter-account-password/
Trump is not gonna guarantee a peaceful transition of power. He said it himself, he's gonna make it hell for Biden
It's far too late for that
China wants to appear strong, and they will do what they think is needed to appear that way.
It's about appearances.
They aren't our friend, but they aren't explicitly our enemy either. I think you should be concerned because you believe that COVID is a Chinese bioweapon or something.
China unleashed it?
Why is China at the top of your list of things to be concerned about?

‚ÄúGay lifestyle‚Äù what the fuck is that supposed to mean
I‚Äôm mainly talking about the social issues
Relabeling signs to?
I‚Äôm referring to the people who want to get rid of gendered bathrooms
People like to praise the idea of gender neutral bathrooms but they never think about the logistics of it
Gender neutral restrooms would never work unless people got cool with a bunch of stuff really fast
but taxes are also used for administrative costs so
i think what they mean is that taxes are used for the public

obviously
and personal testimony does not count as proof
but thats not going to stop me from writing them off as terfs until i have proof otherwise
maybe not
then the anti-terf groups need to find a new symbol
i am stating that once a hate group claims a symbol then that symbol becomes one of hate
¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
i have literally only seen those colors actively being used by terfs
one bad apple spoils the bunch
but it doesnt change the fact that its a symbol of nazis
okay theres still legitimate use for the swastika
not sure how thats relevant
cool?
theyre identifiers
thats the point of symbols
yes they can
er
regardless of its origins it is now a symbol of a hate group
the existence and malicious use of the swastika disproves that.
in the future can can content warn transphobic shit like the tweet meiyi posted
Public housing right.
Abolishing suburbs and packing people into cities might seem like a good idea at first glance.
You can have suburbs and mass transit.
That just brings about a whole slew of other problems.
And do what? Pack people into cities?
Cars are the default.
The US is so far heavy that public transport is never going to take off.

‚ÄúThe Anglo-Saxons were a cultural group who inhabited England in the Early Middle Ages. They traced their origins to the 5th century settlement of incomers to Britain, who migrated to the island from the North Sea coastlands of mainland Europe. However, the ethnogenesis of the Anglo-Saxons occurred within Britain, and the identity was not merely directly imported. The development of an Anglo-Saxon identity arose from the interaction between incoming groups of people from a number of Germanic tribes, both amongst themselves, and with indigenous British groups. Many of the natives, over time, adopted Anglo-Saxon culture and language and were assimilated. The Anglo-Saxons established the concept, and the Kingdom, of England, and though the modern English language owes somewhat less than 26% of its words to their language, this includes the vast majority of words used in everyday speech.‚Äù

You‚Äôre a goddamn hypocrite. It‚Äôs not okay for me to kill myself, but it‚Äôs totally fine for you to do so?

The amount of times you‚Äôve talked me down because it would practically render our friendship and everything we‚Äôve done together null. But suddenly it‚Äôs okay for you to do that?
I will never forgive you if kill yourself.
People are deluded into thinking that they still live in that time I guess.

save yourself the time and skip it
way to high-energy for me
he seems
I've watched a few of his videos
but I do remember dropping it
it's been so long
I don't even remember what happened
honestly
<:PES_Lul:643782649013338122>
I dropped Reconguista in G during the first episode
Asemu was the best IMHO
even though it aired during my childhood
none of that was my childhood
I feel old

so
I'm a filthy scrub who only watches subs unless something really stands out

might have to hold off on the BDs then
I uh

I'll wait for all the BDs to come out then give it a watch I suppose
eh
mobile game promotion?
lemme guess?
can you recommend it?
anyone see the Azur Lane anime?
wasn‚Äôt too impressed with it dess
I remember buddy complex dess
I guess this really was a mobile game promotion
it doesn't look like anyone has subbed BD2 in english yet lmao
<:thinkAboutIt:528511278776320001>

that's a while
jeez

most likely tomorrow
I won‚Äôt be watching it tonight
well
aight
wasn't too impressed
saw it in theaters
I did
what can I expect
I'm gonna watch Promare
if I'm not dead fucking tired when I get home
y‚Äôall remember how wild G Gundam was?
https://youtu.be/9QjPbSe0nRI
I didn't remember that one
the "horny transgender person" trope
I see it now
ah
I don't remember there being a trans person in the show
gargantia was transphobic?
wait
that's something to read out of context
apologies
2 INT
cannot read
am dumb
oh
I can‚Äôt remember what played during Nine Lives tho
yeah I remember that
in the VN
during nine lives
did the EMIYA theme play during that scene or was it something else
I can‚Äôt remember
how can you not be hyped for that
Nine Lives
but come on
if you wanna call it that
that will also be a good fight
so y‚Äôall already know Nine Live Blade Works is finna be hype as fuck
and we‚Äôre getting Yuki Kajiura for the music again
IT LOOKS HYPE AS FUCK

It‚Äôs garbage

<:pachaCommander:672427013679874078>
Hiroyuki Sawano worked on the composition for it
of which I don‚Äôt have
requires proper understanding of UC to understand
let‚Äôs put it that way
Destiny could have been *better*
multiple times
I still watched it though
Destiny was shit
one OP that slaps
the only thing remotely good about it is the like
it‚Äôs just reused ideas
skip it
with tears in my eyes and me on my knees
do it
I beg you
you are missing nothing by skipping AGE
Age 2 was the best tbh
there is never enough Dakka
heavy artillery characters are normally my favorite
and vice versa
it doesn't matter
tbh
I'm sure there's someone here that can give a better explanation than me though
don't put off XV
but really
extras
get rid of those annoying dims in the middle of intense sequences
BDs have cleaned up animation
uh
waiting on the full release of the BD's before I start my rewatch
yeah
BD's or bust
but
they do for the TV broadcast
oh yeah
catsite
and CR for XV
but that's what I used for S1 through S4
IDK if they've done any of the XV blu-rays
YTT's
the mystery in in/spectre is too small brain for Miso
please
can I have what ever you are smoking

it smells like boomer in here
y'all smell that

IDK about US tho
I know it did on JP television
TIL
google time
I need to see where you can buy these
she looks very unhappy
there‚Äôs a bunny girl chris
lmao what
I have a hard time just turning my brain off and enjoying stuff
I'm too critical for my own good
I just never fully vibed with the show, if that makes any sense
but
I even drove an hour to see the movie
along with the music
and the sound design is great
the action sequences are phenomenally animated
oh don't get me wrong
I never could decide on whether or not I liked it
very different
it's
I think it was called
Jingo Jungle?
I really like the opening to it
they are totally different characters
the stark contrast
ah
it's really impressive
she's got some range
does Aoi Yuuki sing it?
it only comes as an omnibus tho
I purchased it
the manga has amazing art
but it's a good anime
is so bland
the main character
it's carried by the side characters
Netflix has a show called Levius
I never heard it referred to as that, so I was very confused
fair enough
too much to keep up with
but I don't watch seasonal anime as it airs
I plan on watching it
are you talking about In/Spectre?
I've enjoyed it with my brain on
and now on my slight rewatch
Symphogear was so easy to turn my brain off to
but I didn't enjoy it
it's a great movie
on textbook
I think Weathering with You is a good example
the JPop was good tho
it felt more like an idol anime than a mecha anime
it was okay
bad memories
ugh
Macross Delta
oh my god
are you watching Gundam AGE
wait
I doubt this is true tho

it was pretty
but that's just me
I didn't like it
I saw it in theaters
excuse me
me too
me too Shirabe

there's no tsukihime anime
idk what you're talking about
why is that of all things getting an S2
you what
Violet Evergarden supports privatized public services and unregulated child labor.
OP doesn't slap as hard tho
feels just like season one
and it's great
if anything they escalated it
I was worried that the humor of the manga wouldn't be able to be kept
not as good as the first
it was decent fun
anime music quiz
actually, I'm pretty sure that's a later episode
does EP1 have the ||cavity search||

Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's Dub OP slapped

but we got a bombass new visual

it‚Äôs kinda neat how that tracks VAs and staff too

to be fair it doesn‚Äôt stand out these days
I forgot about it
jfc
Seikon no Qwaser is a series that exists
but it‚Äôs good anyway
lord no
Kaguya-sama?
Most likely checking for a certain string of text.
Fair enough.
Worth watching?
I have it downloaded.
And my roommate and I jokingly refer to it as Imaishi Circlejerk the Film.
I think the sound track did a lot of the heavy lifting.
Not spectacular.
It's a decent film.
<a:HYPERTRIGGERED:393807378841337859>
I watched Promare awhile back, so I'm hazy on the details. But I do remember everything before the eruption being a bit of a drag, but everything afterwards just being....

Didn‚Äôt know she was back.
Fair enough.
What the fuck. The Markov chain is working again?
Where‚Äôs the first seven seasons of Keijo!!!!!!!! then?
New game season two wasn‚Äôt called Newgame++ and I think that‚Äôs a travesty
Sympho-
yuma is definitely a twerp
what the fuck is this new opening
first 25 episodes of zexal down
watching Yuma grow from a twerp into someone that can hold his own in a 2v1 is just so good
acts, talks, and walks like someone at least in their 20s
i guess the best way to put it would be that he's very mature?
the way he behaves
*young*
they're so
I cant look at a bunch of these characters the same way now
are not of a 19 year old
his mannerisms
yeah but like
I THOUGHT HE WAS LIKE 30 SOMETHING
HES 19?????
I think one of my biggest gripes with the show is that ||Flip/Tokunosuke continues to cause problems for the characters and it's portrayed in a manner where we're supposed to feel bad for him||
finished with the first 49
just double checked
definitely considered dropping it at some points
so ive heard
yeah
somewhere in that area
It‚Äôs like episode 48 or 49
watching it subbed
I just finished the preliminaries
finished the first two arcs of ZeXal. watching Yuma grow from a twerp to an actually capable duelist has been phenomenal
im good
damn
magic girl site or something like that
I've already watched OG, GX, and 5Ds
oh no
really enjoying his turnaround
man. Shark is great
but like ||Yuma, Shark, and Kaito coming together to take on Faker was really good too||
and ||ZeXal||
really enjoyed the ||Gauche v. Yuma duel in the finals||
oh jeez
well you got me pumped now
this is FUNKY
this is some dancin music
listening to the embed
thats a banger
oh my god
<:KirikaShout:607741871703457812>

painful
thats
oh my god
and it got erased in the localization?
waitwaitwait is one of the Zexal II characters bi?
oh thats amazing
or is this in the show
wait, are these edits?
although ive heard GGO - alt is pretty good
i kinda gave up on the SAO train
what does 871 mean
it kinda is
very monster of the week
not horribly impressed
three episodes in
starting Zexal II
pfft
oops
its a guilty pleasure
i play the game so i enjoy watching it
actually kind of tilted after finding this out so im gonna take a break
a n g e r
the dub still left this in too

<:PES_BoiStop:643089267371016203>
they didnt
oh my god
who dubbed this?
practically erasure tbh
I hate this
<:KirikaDisgust:688431636043268097>
oh wow they cut the scene with them flying off into space together
watching the ending
what the fuck ARE THESE VOICES
how did the localization fuck this up i wonder
Yuma has no fucking idea what just happned
pfffft

i think that may be the case
oh
but i missed it
i feel like they said his name at one point

no
but hes got some funky music following him
idk who this new person is
also
<:KirikaPonder:743991840700760104>
i dont care for it too much
gonna have to disagree there
im uh
<:MikuCute:672908542763859968>
finally getting some backstory to Shark
the skirts are much longer too
oh my god
i just used OBS to screen record the dub from CrunchyRoll
i have the subs downloaded
im that mad
dusting off sony vegas to make a comparison
fuck it
ok
ive heard madoka gets pretty fucked up, should I watch it if im not in a good headspace?
üëç
whats the watch order for it?
speaking of madoka, I was gonna start on that today
vÃ¥ÃãÕõoÃ¥ÃâÃìiÃ∏ÕÇÕòdÃ∂ÕêÕë
It‚Äôs just.
It‚Äôs not a bad problematic like Valvrave.
I mean.
But its definitely fun.
It‚Äôs...problematic.
Twintail is a hell of a ride.
That being said.
<:TsubasaJuicebox:750558017656848475>
In hindsight, my fascination with gender-benders should have been a sign.
<@297542051057238017> I take back what I‚Äôve said. The first opening of Zexal II has grown on me.
It is.
I skip out on stuff all the time.
Watch a few episodes, if you enjoy it go for it, if not then no big deal.
IIRC its a monster of the week with each week‚Äôs villain having a power based on a specific fetish/kink.
It‚Äôs not DxD levels of horny. That‚Äôs for sure.
Horny.
will it be fixing some of the animation problems in dancouga
episode three?
What episode does Childhood friend #2 come in?
honestly the unicorn is cool enough to forgive that

That's a decent chunk for a final act.

That theme and the final fusion track are living rent free in my head right now.
Really enjoying GaoGaiGar.

My non-anime fan friend of mine has challenged me to find something that he might like. He's said he enjoyed SAO and some of Zankyou no Terror. He wants something noir-like. `Like run down detective has to resurrect their career`.
But I‚Äôll look all of these up.
I get mad bonus points if its from the 80s or 90s.
I'll look at all of these tomorrow.
Not a bad idea. I've heard good things about Lupin.
whats the run time then?
Gunbuster is really good.
oml
LMAO
I'm not even sure how to even to being to explain it Solo
It was
I SWEAR
THE FUCKING PHONE
Danball Senki has been a blast so far
üëÄ
Incredibly
<:blobsip:580593158312951809>
Danball Senki W has been a blast
Freedom is better than Strike Freedom
I really like the suit designs in SEED
SEED or SEED Destiny?
üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è
The reason I remember Gunbuster coming out in the 80's is because I made a really bad joke on my twitter about it
I enjoy SEED, dislike SEED Destiny
You can‚Äôt escape
Oh gosh
this show is so fucking dumb
Why is he so hot
It leaves a bad taste in the mouth
The second season of IBO is...
I don‚Äôt understand how there is IBO enthusiasts
It‚Äôs got similar vibes and themes but Danball Senki just goes completely bonkers at some points.
If you enjoyed Build Fighters then you‚Äôll definitely enjoy Danball Senki
It‚Äôs similar in concept to Build Fighters where it‚Äôs a proxy battle with little mechs but honestly it‚Äôs way more fun.
Have you watched Danball Senki
Shirobako is not CGDCT
Prototype is phenomenal
Ah yeah
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
I don't remember what the second one is
Which is okay
First one is Daybreaks's Bell IIRC
but the dub is decent
I prefer it subbed
00 has a good dub
no that's the second opening
Is that the steropony one
Then this is a difference of opinion
<:HibikiWhat:336656482907193344>
How is calling someone a bad writer for recycling themes from their own work not an answer to your question
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
You asked why every entry has a love triangle I gave you an answer
No but he is the director
Writing
<:15min:241820657027907584>
Because Kawamori is a hack
The two roles that shape the show?
Yknow
He‚Äôs the creator and director
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
Danball says it stands for Experimental Realism Project, but I dunno about that one
`Erotic Role Play`
ITS SO BAD
<:ShirabeWeep:701475635025019000>
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
I never noticed the lack of Cables in the Re:II
<:KanadeSmug:688191203178840064>
we already got that with Valvrave
I missed the Danball talk
Awh
<a:MikuBlink:628527784679178240>
Demon slayer movie pretty good
Watched the first couple episodes of Yasuke last night. I‚Äôm not really sure what to think.
It‚Äôs so good
<:KirikaConcern:698939825386029186>
Probably more <#447132690349555712>
Hmmm

The pinnacle of 90's anime openings is Yuusha ou Tanjou.
Ayo, has anyone seen Magic Knight Rayearth, and if so can you give it a shout? All I know about it is from SRW T.
00 season 1
why watch wing when you can watch the better wing
At least seed has interesting characters
I‚Äôd actually recommend seed over wing
She is right
Don‚Äôt blame her

She even said one time that they‚Äôre a good starting place for real robot
Compilation films are good
yeah there was a bunch of added content to it
does shirobako also have a messy production story like the movie
**missiles are the dumbest thing**
i now realize that my tired brain forgot the funnel part of my statement but im gonna be a dumbass and double down
Missiles are the dumbest thing
Is this the one with aoi  Yuuki
Mylene getting raped in the Macross 7 OVA wasn‚Äôt real but it sure as hell gave me a panic attack.
Why are you defending underage noncon. This is a very strange hill to die on.
Gross.
Aizen was a better villain than Ywach
What was even the point of ditf
I have access to GPT3
Wait

Yeah I don‚Äôt either. It‚Äôs just modernized.
Really? What about it made you rate it higher?
IBO is incredibly passable if you watch just the first half.
Start with the compilation movies.
One of these days I‚Äôm gonna read that
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:796600452585881650>
>screams 
>doesn‚Äôt mention Hiyama
Hey!!!!
Just transcode it then
I know a bunch have gotten taken down and such.
What's the best site to stream anime from these days. I've been torrenting the past few years.
just wanted to make sure
alright
The movie??
Madoka holds the title for the anime that has made me cry the most at an ending.
3.33 is still bad.
Eva 2.22 is still insanely good
Star driver was a work of art
K√§mpfer is fun
slav squat

if you come away from getter robo and think "wow ryoma and hayato are so cool" then youve missed the point of getter robo

Ryomas a goddamn psychopath
This is very gamer.
I have mixed feelings on this.
Hm.

Why what

Unicorn Gundam has a built in Pog face.
Rikkas thighs are fucking massive

*obari
The ovaries pose with gridman caliber had me in tears
episode one of ssss.gridman is such a strong opening episode
becuase im experiencing the exact opposite
alot of people have said that ssss.gridman falls off and the latter half isnt as nearly as good as the first, can i get someones thought process for that?
so
so much went on
what the fuck is gridman episode 7 lmao
i really hope dynazenons themes are similar to gridmans
THAT WAS SO GOOD
I'm watching it with someone

i fucking teared up
and i feel bad for writing it off now
actually really good
was
ssss.gridman

BONKERS
