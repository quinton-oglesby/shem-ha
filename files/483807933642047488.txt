is there any other character worth maining
well I would take you up if I consistently played
Welcome
I've been waiting
id then compare mental states
I mean does au basa have anything that puts her at an advantage?
> the blue sword girl
this one wins
the blue sword girl
It was definitely easier in the novels cause we didn't see her as much
gay
because sex and violence are a bit different
the justification is worse than the action
no shaft syndrome?
which is a lot more important imo
emotionally and mentally that is
I think that he is at a much different point rn
Frieren is good and today was great
they are good
I shill adashima everywhere
adachi is in my top 3 gayest girls
> God, I love Adachi to Shimamura way too much
its so good
first time I get to feel like an elitist ln reader too but its sol so what is there to be elitist about
adashima is wonderful
ig watch it if you like anime thighs
not madoka (again) by shaft
which is just a normal relationship problem so im good with that
g was miku hating that hibiki was putting herself at risk while xv was miku and hibiki not communicating
hmm while xv and g were similar what they discussed was much different
and then doesn't do things that I find particularly off-putting
I like it when a show does at least one thing particularly well
I just also really enjoyed spending 8 novels inside the heads of the two protagonists of adashima because i hadn't had a story explore romance from that perspective that strongly before
yeah
it is why I love xv
I binged all 8 novels in a few days so the pacing is a little different in my head <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
by the time it was getting stalish for me was ln 5 and that is certainly a way to unstale it
AK is the one who got me to read it
I *really* like adashima so ill shill it at every point I can get
i get that
yeah
if you want actual gay romance watch adashima but if you want thigh fanservice plus yuri then watch alb
> thicc thighs save lives
watch assault lily
how much do you like thighs?
side note:
yuri connotes the kinda over sexualization of girls to appeal to the teen boy audience instead of having actual well done romance is maybe what they mean about alb
its just weird to not like the romance in a show about the power of love
they already said it was romance in general
symphogear was always about the power of love so how could it end without addressing the love between hibiki and miku is how I think about it
since it is done remarkably well for the quality of the writing otherwise
symphogear is good because of yuri to me
it wasn't solved
but the main plotline was their romance/relationship as a whole
show them the gx opening scene and ask them if they are interested
the first ep of xv
symphogear
MHA the anime with the second hypest fight including the words "one for all" and "all for one"

overlord isn't very good so not getting into it is fine
> Is SAO was even that bad as people complaining.
no they are just projecting the problems of their favorite shows
my go to show to shit on is shield hero
whenever im bored or something I don't like is happening I skip forward 5 seconds
irregular is my forward arrow key show
"don't even talk to me until you've seen x"
that is what I do
should I forward arrow key through part 3
ill attempt it again at some point but I can't go through 40 more episodes of this
I couldn't get past part 3
there were some very good episodes
it is a good premise I just don't like how it went about doing it and the ending was just so poorly done
> 18 mediocre episodes? Thats kinda harse. I feel like the only bad episode was zenitsu introduction episode
its a meme not supposed to be all facts
My nitpit for demon slayer is that tanjiro cut his hair and he was hot before that
> yeah I tried the novel and it gives me the vibes of "actually, the story when he's building his guild seems better than the story we are given"
huh
and then idk about the movies
you watch A's after s1
> Oh, you mean Befriending beam of Destruction?
Yes "friends"
starlight breaker is such a badass attack name
Nanoha A's pog
Bookworm was nice
though since I haven't heard anyone that much against it in a while I want to know why
probably not for everyone Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯
the second is airing in winter
yeah its 2 cour
adashima is an in-depth character analysis of the two girls and how they are creating and developing their relationship
look at it when you're done
this is for adashima ep 7

but like all shounen symphogear is better
cause s3 had a good arc
which is weird
gn
yeah it's too bad
traded that away for money sorry
sorry im jewish what else am I supposed to do <:KirikaSmug:607742561414676517>
if anything I can say that it doesn't get good
I bothered to read to aru and it didn't change my opinions of the serie
ðŸ‘€
I thought you've read everything
I don't care for sao
how is it?
true ive never seen anything related to ryuo
oh look there are 0 good series there <:HibikiSmug:672655850518609940>
its everywhere
oh no..
my only complain is that the op doesn't fit the tone of the series at all
I was about to say watch symphogear but then I remembered what server I was in
why would you possibly be doing this :kaguyasmug:
I wouldn't recommend the rest
the rest of toaru is very...
railgun has good arcs
cutting out a lot to fit it into a movie?
I think the second season was good the way it was
not sure about that
it really shows off aka's strengths and weaknesses as a awriter
oshi no mo
Ikr
||flower scene is 10/10||
my eyes skimmed over it
oh I see it now
have you watched egg ash?
shes so pretty

I just find that the world makes very little sense even by its own rules
even from just a prose standpoint the writing is not good
the index light novel is pretty terrible though
railgun is the best part of the franchise
so have fun ig
the tropes in index really bother me which kills the enjoyment I could get out of it
the writing itself is never very good but expecting light novels to be as good as adashima is a hard line to beat
i found magic to be really underwhelming in new testament but that may be an unpopular opinions
although my experiences with it are souring during rewatches <:KaguyaPensive:675011075749576718>
I find the science side way more interesting so  Ilike railgun better
so we know what is being fought for
the extra amount of sol in railgun allows the humanity of the clones to be shown
yes but in index it is done much worse than railgun because of how it is shown
the scope of the battle is far more than she can fight
we have also been shown that accelerator isn't the entirety of the enemy
to misaka it is far more than herself and we have been shown that not told it
to touma it isn't much
what stands to be lost is what matters
"War must be, while we defend our lives against a destroyer who would devour all; but I do not love the bright sword for its sharpness, nor the arrow for its swiftness, nor the warrior for his glory. I love only that which they defend."
but they are never the climaxes
there are plenty of great battles
take lord of the rings for an example
story wise physical fights do not matter
the fight doesn't matter
to touma he was just someone else to punch
what made accelerator threatening was what he represented to misaka
the fight isn't what made accelerator threatening
just from the perspective change he becomes a much greater threat
not so much in index
in railgun he is
any amount of injuries that touma suffers doesn't change that
if something can be solved with a punch than it isn't that much of a threat
its sort of
thats another issue, all the villains are delusional instead of being confrontations to the characters
since it all ends with a punch so much of the time
My last issue with index is that I didn't find the emotional climaxes to be fulfilling
level 6 is incredibly interesting and it is just never touched upon outside of "doing this is bad"
it doesn't actually have to be a wider power system as we've seen in railgun T
it gets worse in new testament
there is some combining magic and science but it still seems almost all magic
with the grand battle in the world science seems more and more like an irrelevant part of the picture while magic is utterly massive
An issue I have with the clash of personalities is that only touma's really has an effect on the others
like the "three types of heroes" just isn't done well
after reading index I just couldn't find a purpose the story has
My biggest problem with index id say is that it just doesn't do anything for the genre it's in. If you take symphogear as an example, despite its many writing flaws, it talks about the impact of music on the world while also doing the quintessential love part of the mg genre.
when nuance is attempted it just doesn't do anything
yeah, he just lacks a lot of nuance and thats critical for me
touma is just not a very good character even in the novels
accelerator has some decent development
probably because shes just a normal person in an abnormal world
saten in railgun is probably the best written character the franchise has
well yeah, she doesn't even have an arc
and their destinations
there are plenty of likable characters I just dislike their arcs
not to mention I don't really like how the characters are written a lot of the time in index
a lot of people like it better but I find the writing to be fever dreamish and not in really the good way
while that is true in new testament the power levels go off the rails
how the magic goes from being myth to reality doesn't really make that much sense either
the power levels don't particularly make sense at all
the roots are fine for the most part
yes but it doesn't actually make sense
there is some consistency with the sci fi science side
The entire magic system
Adashima is good, sayaka novels are good- especially number 1, and I'm in love with the villainess 1&2 are my good yuri novels
I think the fan translation is better though
<:Poguya:701155514611925042>
I'd recommend adashima if you are reading light novels
which is when my enjoyment of the series started to rapidly decline
when I binged new testament in a week it was a massive fever dream
A lot of my issues come from the icky way index treats its characters, especially women, and the prose itself being really hard to read
night
I actually liked index 3 more than the novels it covered
My issue with oregairu is that it does romance/its themes worse than other shows
nanoha A's is good
oh yeah its tpn not sk8 oops
cloverworks is doing egg, horimiya, and sk8
snow rain >>>
nanoha A's is good
or the entirety of death parade
well madoka ep 10
film critics are interesting no matter what they critic
not that I watch him often but when I do its time well spent
glass reflection has good analysis most of the time
its really really bad
need to watch that
yeah
baccano? but thats kinda just how the story is told
wonder egg has flashbacks in it too
Shit fantasy (bottom)
Great fantasy (top)
See:
the covers have me so hyped
sorta unrelated but I love how IFTV handles ||their relationship by the end of 2 where even though they can't marry due to social reasons its just so good||
machikado pog
I'm the slightly sadistic girl in the yuri manga
