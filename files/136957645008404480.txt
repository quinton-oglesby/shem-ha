Estelle not even best girl in her own arc
Laura best Kiseki
they reiterated that a few weeks ago
because Uma Musume ahs asked we not lewd the horses
but we don't talk about that
some artists also do some good lewd horse
that look like Basa's feet swords
she has these things on her feet
she's often compared to Basa tbh
that ones Mihono Bourbon

nothing feels worse than being let down by something you were really excited for
the disappointment felt more pronounced
I think people were so hyped for the mesoamerican aesthetic and story

3_skip

they even did a collab w/ Top Gun when maverick released
from Uma Musume
Its Mayano Top Gun
<:RiceNom:830258666073882624>
was a successful racehorse from 1995-1997
the tweet from the top gun account celebrating the horse bday
https://twitter.com/topgunmovie_jp/status/1374526376162824192
but they did an advertising collab
when released was poor choice of words
3_skip
~~sans removing the Taiwanese Flag from her jacket because China~~
but Mayano Top Guns character design has always been that way
Bananice
How do you know Towa but not Sara
Not what I was going for but it works
Towa is trans dimensional
Yes
I haven’t played Xanadu yet. There’s a cold steel character in it. And lots of kiseki references
Sara is pretty good. Schera probably edges out because whip
Sharon is sexy bondage maid with wires
Sara is young alcoholic sexy teacher
Cold Steel
Yea but the real question is: does Sara or Sharon beat Schera
But we all know Das gonna simp for Schera
Estelle as a character is good
<:rikoShrug:358316586890952704>
Then I misunderstood what the “when an opinion happens” comment was
You’re the one who called me out. I wasn’t telling you you were wrong
I agree
And I object to wit
Immature, childish
Cross dressing Joshua exists
Schera exists
Kloe exists
Not even the best girl in her own game
Estelle is aight
See I know how he ends up
spoilerino for late trails ||he does marry Schera tho||
that I can see
I don't think Olivier is gay
uhhhh
but I will bet Das goes for Olivier
not quite Olivier
who are you asking
makes Agate's look small
She has a *big* sword
she's best trails girl

pls
I'm not
and then says since it's hair and will grow back it's temporary
and she's like "it was a show of resolve andd etermination"
somebody asks
she cuts her hair
she literally says as much
it was that trope
ngl I got really sad when Kloe cut her hair

Yes. But if you know her you know Sara since Sara is prologue
I’m working on Ys Celceta atm before I do sky 3
Oh did I forget to mention there’s an aggressive butch lesbian in cold steel. She’s great
didn't know the name
oh
is that ||renne||
I probably know it but not the acronym or name
I don't recognize sd15
Trails worldbuilding is the best
but it's all good
I prefer their world building to their characters or plot or gameplay
Trails is good
yup
tries to seduce anything that moves
Olivier is literally the "horny bard" DnD trope
and Arts are bonkers OP
making him the best Arts user
he has the highest ATS stat in the game, and a single quartz line
Olivier is a Sky character, wandering bard, uses a pistol, is the single strongest character in the game

kinda sad that was AXZ only
I miss golden bikki
oh so slowly
slowly
im slowly trying to be active on this server again
oh hi rookie
some interesting story/characters
but visual spectacle
kinda felt overused
Takt op leaned really heavy on a deadpan comedy
but is otherwise cute and idolly
so we'll see
I've heard it starts by doing some blasphemous shit
last one for me to watch today
can't get hurt if you're the one putting on the hurt
<:AgnesEcstasy:858023176058830858>
Uma
oh are we talking about
Fena killin it
top 2 form last season
Fena is amazing
chibi mechs? Granbelm?
anime
eh
ye it was a kinda
i didnt know
Urasekai picnic had an anime
theres been far worse
self aware comedic trashy
its like
nah its no eromanga sensei
its gloriously hot garbage

Isekai from this season
praise be to Onii-sama
Praise be to Anos
And yes I know she doesn’t want to wipe out humanity
their story so damn boring
I'm Ariel's camp of destroy all humans
its a disservice to ImoSae to compare the 2
Eromanga sensei is trash
Imosae was an exceptional work
not the best follow up to the first ep
theres a few good english dubs out there
was good ep
like something in the 5s is prob ass
theyre a decent benchmark
^
aquatope pretty gay tho
i think its great theyre handling it this way
its a complicated sotry to say the least. Nobody is right or wrong because its so grey.
fuck even w/o knoing Haebaru is a single mom
and come in for late night shift overtime
Im not normally on the hate train, and Haebaru has been a bit of a bitch, but holy fuck how entitled are you to think somebody cant suddenly drop everything, chnage their schedule
Kukuru in todays ep
I wish the finale was more a fully pitched battle between Abel, Team Fena, and the RUmble Roses back with a vengeance
when Yukimaru rowed through and showed none of the main ones I knew they survived
yea
half of that
but at least i got
I was always hoping they would miraculously survive and show up with a vengeance in the finale
why wasthe title Pirate Princess
multiple times
changed the direction of the story
I think they like
yea that was unfortunate
so amazing and visceral
episode 7 was
i would say ep 9 was the first weaker episode for me
hmm maybe
really?
it
because god did I love 90% of i
im still gonna love it tho
like did we really need 12 minutes of Cody rambling about some nonsensical bullshit
was eh
where all it amounted to was memory wipe fena
just the weird non-ending
even a little bit of the magical possession
the joan of arc stuff
i mean some of the historical crap was fun
yea
but overall i wihs they had just stuck with the adventure
it definitely could have used more time
the whole time
but overall i wihs they had just stuck with the adventure
it definitely could have used more time
yea
designs and visuals
the characters were great
even if the ending wasnt
this was a show where the Journey was really worth it
im still leaning 8/10 or 9/10, but thats *really* apologizing for the finale
cause I really dont wanna hold it against a show I fell in love with for the first 8ish episodes
gonna try to forget the 12 minutes of the final ep
bad
yea it was
and Yukimaru CONFESSED
MARY LIVES
CAUSE OUR RUMBLE ROSES LIVED
and a Rumble Rose spinoff
I still want a season 2 tho
nice final sequence tho
but they did kinda go off the deep end for the ending
especially the first half and the adventure
I still loved the show
well, Fena ending could have been better
sounds fun
think so
now I can only dream of what it could have been
but man
even if the ending wasnt
cause the adventure was that good
still coming out saying I enjoyed it tho
easy AotY
yea if it stuck the landing
still probably my top 3 from last season
yes
well, we did still get a lot of pirates and ninjas
yea
of the finale
but im gonna straight up tell them to skip the 1st 12 minutes
Im still gonna recommend the show to people
yea
exactly
mystical bullshit
and instead we got
new manga chapter TLd today
IFTV
speaking of
I enjoy that manga
I favor the villainess
ooh
but after XV i did go back
Im def more of a pog brain
like the Engrish
other than some of the rough patches of S1
i dont remember disliking much while watching symphogear
and just outrageously exciting
and gay
was fun, and cute
and enjoyed it
I just did
I dont remember why I started symphogear
and appreciate how they tied the lore together
ok looking at Lanks list
if you saw how i rated parts 1-5
i think you would actually block me
<a:ChomuShook:611826769053351990>
sounds about right for Jojo
and about half a year played on my wow classic character
but i had over 1 year played on 1 character
not that ii can check it anymore since i deleted it
i dont wanna talk about my world of warcraft time
yea mine are all airing
well some im not actively watching. Like Mieruko is on there but i only watched 1 ep so who knows if i actually finish it
pretty close # of completed
looks a lot like mine
so its demonstrated twive
oh it also happens w/ the thug and his shovel
how would you like to describe this ability?
you can call it something else
Kid attacks tree. Instead of the tree being damaged, kid takes damage from the attack. An ability Giorno demonstrates in this instance and never again. You can choose, or choose not, to call it reflecting damage
youre gonna nitpick semantics on an ability he demonstrates once at th ebeginning and never again

and it reflects the damage onto him
he attacks Giornos tree
with the Act 3
whatever the kids name
to the first episode
15 minutes in
found it
on the kid
where he reflects the damage
from the 1st ep
find a screenshot
lemme go like
100% did
but then they got rid of that
the jojo can
in the first ep
he could reflect dmg or someshit
immediately forgotten?
but it was like
and the MC had a second power
like a weird healing power
i can only vaguely remember some parts of 5
by sengoku
nice
oh im actuaslly blocked now
like i cant even remember enough about it
it was kinda an uninteresting blur to me
i dont really remember much of 5
mm
its right there
I did
well certified hasnt blocked me yet
and tell myself im not gonna wtach again
and am disappointed
and say fuck it and wtach it
and then i inevitably get really bored the season its airing
every time i get done w/ a jojo season I say to myself i have no need to watch another
i dont know how I got through that excruciating shit
honestly Stardust Crusaders should probably be lower
here you go
lmao
very different taste
we have
characters were good
pacing was rough
like i said
but I really liked the character dynamics
pacing was rough
I enjoyed it
whoa
wait a S2
really really good
really good
Horses good
Uma Musume is gasssssss
her gf Meisho Doto a qt too
also voiced by Soramaru
TM Opera O has the best solo song
up to 3 praise stickers

for Dia
great work
The fanarts have done
Suzuka, Oguri Cap, Super Creek, Teio, Seiun Sky
but theres a lot of really good other horses

easy
TM Opera O
man I missed the Uma convo
but I still preferred <:McTeioKiss2:892678558663725076>
Rice had a good arc
I liked how well they developed that while they were largely side characters with little screentime
was such a goood couple
and Mejiro Palmer
Daitaku Helios
was the only time the ED changed in S1
the Silence suzuka starting gate solo was played during the ED of her episode
has solo songs for like, 30 of the horses
starting gate good
<:seiunhigh:460678870757277697><:seiunhigh:460678870757277697><:seiunhigh:460678870757277697><:seiunhigh:460678870757277697>
tho Seiun Sky is my favorite grass horse
which is funny
fanartists made her full yandere
grass is cute
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8zvu15JySU
slightly wrong
oh wait
Opera song
well the songs have been out since S1
prob
Opera only girl w/ short hair
<a:DorothyDrinking2:398986594562080778>
but that is probably best in <#336297808221044736>
and dorothy boobs emote
i would post my chris zenbus emote
Chris best geah
TM Opera O best horse
Banana best stage girl
Dorothy best spy
Princess Principal spy girls
+ Spy girls
the holy trinity
Horses, Stage Girls, and Geahs
<a:Bananaisu:476011303916273674>
<:JunanaKiss2:498789658436567050>
Banana best
so I might just not have bothered reading it
but I also knew basically all the horses
I dont remember them being small
Meisho a cute
Meisho Doto x TM opera O is the correct ship
for the record
shes pretty cute
Tosen Jordan is the other gyaru horse
the blasphemy that is Matikanefukukitaru x Meisho Doto
RiceBourbon
which says a lot cause S2 has some great ships
prob my favorite ship in S2
i lvoe what they did with Heliospalmer
for a couple very side characters
Helios is good
already on S2
yes
and they cover each generation of horses in separate seasons
theres just horses in the story like Special week from a different generation
all of the races in the season are in the correct order
then after an Apr 26 race Teio doesnt race again til Nov 29, 1992, and Teios last race is over a year after that on Dec 26, 1993
so IRL due to injuries Teio does have some big gaps in races

May 26, 1991 the Derby

next race is on Apr 5, 1992
yes
are all in accurate chronological order
but all the Teio/Rice/McQueen race they cover
but its a little out of order for like, Special Week being active at the same time
the individual races occur in chronological order for that horse generations story
Kita/Dia or Scarlet/Vodka are the likely next stories. Kita Dia tho is a much more recent generation 2016-2018, and it looks like they dont have as many licenses for the horses from the last decade or 2
that manga is killing it in Young Jump atm
im hoping they adapt cinderella grey
no S3 announcement yet
since shes 1998ish
hence no special week races
so that 1991-1992 ish range is season 2
yea, all the side stories are things that happened in the same timeline
but the timeline of the individual stories is cirrect
the timeline is a bit whack tho
but basically everything in Uma Musume is a faithful recreation of IRL horse races
rgiht before Teio/McQueen
Oguri Cap (the main character of the Cinderella Grey manga) was 1988-1990 ish
so right after the Sweek generation
Operas legendary. undefeated year was 2000
Opera/Doto was 1999-2001
and what held the middle between the TeioMcQueen era and the Sweek era was a briefly hyped up group of horses called BNW (Biwa Hayahide, Narita Taishin, Winning Ticket) but they didnt deliver the epic races so it was a somewhat more dull era. They are covered a bit in S2, and also in a 3 part OVA after S1
so theyve basically completed those 2 generations of horses
Teio and McQueen were 1991-1992 ish
Sweek/Suzuka etc are around 1997-1999
Gold Ship 2011
Scarlet/Vodka are around 2007
Sweek is done, Teio is S2, GOld Ship, VOdka, and Scarlet are later generations
but they didnt want to make the show that depressing
the horse died on the track
the race where Suzuka injured herself
its like, 95% accurate to IRL
All the races and the race outcomes are based on IRL horse races
and Suzuka going to America is a metaphor for the death of the horse
theyve already finished Suzuka and Sweeks story
everything is canon
besides the final race in S1
The thing is Uma Musume follows their IRL races
but?
it was kinda ll over the place
but I did enjoy the darker stuff they hinted at
not the best anime ever
?
(also some weird alien shit)
watch Centaur no Nayami
with interesting exploration of a world with moster girls, and discrimination, and the dark sid eof things
if you wanna see a world
and thankfully, the lack of discrimination
because delving that deep exposes the weird absense of thought in a world that never had horses but has horse girls
and the truth is to not delve that deep
updated the names
Tannhauser, ~~Nice Nature~~ Nishikino Maki, Ikutus, Double Engine
the strongest team
but can you name Team Canopus
a lot
yea theres
in S2
but 2nd cour has been far more enjoyable for me
i had a backlog of eps around ep 5-8 where i wasnt watching weekly
the 1st cour kinda lost me at points
I have enjoyed the 2nd cour *far* more than the 1st
Huh
interesting
over Rice/Bourbon/Palmer/Helios
what S1 side characters stand out to you
and decided what it wanted ot be
but I felt the show hadnt settled in
but S1 is more carefree and happy
IMO S2 basically a masterpiece
tho it is pretty uncommon to like S1 more i think
I love both
its a fiine choice
Heel ja nai, hero da!
PalmerHelios cute af
iconic like
I'm not a heel, I'm a hero
everybody loves rice
i mean the side characters are amazing too
Teios miraculous comeback race afte rinjurt
Twin Turbo pulling out the win
and the final races
yea but they. give a TeioMcQueen date
yea the OVA is after S2
that covers them
then theres a 3 part OVA from the end of S1
they start coming to prominence during the end of TeioMcQueen
yea
mcqueen is 1990-1993
BNW is 1992-1994
mostly directly after
Suzuka and Special Week are half brothers
and Symboli Rudolf is Tokai Teios father
for instance, IRL Mejiro McQueen is GOld Ships grandfather
they smoosh horses of many different generations together, but their stories are told distinctly, by generation
but tells their stories distinctly
but the Uma Musume verse kinda sets them concurrently
tehcnically, yes
the Rice arc from S2 is widely considered the best Uma Musu arc so far, but honestly I really enjoy the ending of TeioMcQueen even more
good taste
Doga Kobo and 3Hz
highly recommend, no bias
I think the announced Healer Girls anime gonna be gay too
Flip Flappers
<:thatsmyfetish:462885134656471041>
SAO Alternative
we got Princess Principal
Studio 3Hz does a lot of good gay
cute af
I favor the villainess
whats it called
i really like uh
just need to find the time and motivation to watch them
I have both downloaded
and Adachi to Shimamura
so Bloom into you is still on my to watch
i am ashamed of myself tho. Im a self described yuri fan, but I was pretty off SoL, especially high school romance the past couple years
and a best friend who was real best girl
i remember htere was a little shit that ruined everything
I cant recall much, but i remember reading from someone else the manga gets stuck in a rut for an age where nothign happens
hey theyre gay for eachother, now watch them have a bunch of gay drama and angst without actually progressing the gay
well it was gay but it was like, explicit gay bait
too mcuh drama, not enough gay, too much bait
not what I hoped it would be
something
citrus was
not that kind of sister
oh <@!284772810445029386> is also in this server. Sorry for the ping friend, thought you might enjoy more aquatope discussion
theyre firmly in the sisterzone atm
I strongly think the show isnt gonna go that route
but i seriously doubt
one can hope
like what I posted in <#336297808221044736> ?
2nd best girl Umi-yan
nobody even close
Fuuka ez best girl btw
And we still got to see just how perceptive and considerate Fuuka is
which was that closure, that acceptance
todays ep we saw her giving the heels to Ruka
why she chose not to
but we never really got that closure
she didnt
at the end of cour 1 we didnt really knnow if Fuuka was going to return to idoling
todays episode was closure for Fuuka
I would argue ep 17 was far more skippable than todays ep
for what it meant for Fuuka
like I really liked this episode
I just wanna see the characters interact and grow and mature
i dont really need ot be going anywhere in a show like this
I guess I care more for the SoL and the characters than I do for the drama of the 1st season
he got the bag from Saria iirc. She had a fruit of evolution starter kit
or Mushoku tensei
would rather watch fruit than cheat magician
and doesnt take itself seriously
but at least its marginally self aware
no way evo is worse. It may be absolute trash
MT just isnt one of them
non parody
parody
theres plenty of good isekai
regardless, I shouldnt have mentioned it
<:WizCringe:716334229885157427>
but good story?
and good animation
it has high production value
and calling it quality is gross
I dunno, I think there can be isekai where the MC isnt a pedo child groomer
I cant give a fuck about an anime where the MC doesnt give a fuck about the anime
its like he got told he was the MC of an anime. And instead hes like, "Im only here because its in my contract, but I would rather be at home playing the piano"
blind adn deaf to the world
hes just like
to be an asshole
hes not present enough
hes not an MC
no
like MT
so its a shiny turd
but the fights are really pretty
and then theres the comical villain
its how much he drags it down
its infuriating every moment hes on the screen
how fucking lethargic he is
but there is no words I can use to describe how fucking irritating the MC is
but it turns out ||The #2 in the SYmphonica is the actual bad guy. The aliens were pushed back before the show, but theyve been reawakened, and it turns out hes doing it to purge humanity of the poor people. He did this at the event that killed MCs friend and awakened his powers||
to join the justice league of conductors
and now hes trying to get to new york
(normally they need to be like, curated)
anyways bad shit happens, his friend dies, but then becomes a musicart and he becomes a conductor
but with a piano
hes like those grown as adults that play video games 24/7, arent employed, living in their aprents basement
only wants to play on the piano
full on severe depression, but without the depression
literally is completely incompetent
anyways our music addicted MC
it summons them
of, the bad aliens are attracted to music
And our MC can literally only think of music
(think Noise, and Symphogears, but the Symphogears are Jojo stands/humans)
that could fight the bad aliens
but then others appeared, humans called conductors, and their humanoid assistants, called Musicarts, powered by a different spac estone
Takt Op world: many years previous aliens originating from a specific space stone came and fucked shit up. THey were immune to conventional weaponry
man, I was considering maybe giving Sakugan a shot
that anybody thought this would be good
its honestly an insult to the audience
is the most unlikeable piece of shit
the fucking main character
with how unlikeable takt is
I cant begin
honestly, plot/story/world wise, it has things worth comparing to symphogear. But its like somebody took the synopsis of Symphogea,r without any actual understanding of the show, ran it over with a car, and then cooked it into a burger to sell at Mc DOnalds
it has so little inspiration, or character to it
a soulless amalgam
its like a pretty animation, mappa covered turd
comically evil and completely insane villain
godawful, wholly unlikeable lead
talk about mediocrity
God Takt Op continues to be the biggest disappointment of the season
good 3d
i miss the gems
in the same year
how did that happen twice
oh right
tesla note
we havent even mentioned the aoty tho
for dissing Irina
and i was gonna tear into you
i almsot forgot there was a 2nd vampire anime
cant say ive heard anything about it
wow there really is like nothing else this season
how the fuck is Assassin isekai, and Saihate ranked higer than Shin no Nakama on MAL right now. Fucking joke
and Blue Period
everyone seems to be raving about OUsama
lets see what else is there this season im not watching
theyre so different
kinda amazing Dogo Kobo has that and Senpai this season
didnt seem good
oh yea I gave that a 1 ep shot too
might give it a shot again at some point
its unfortunate I couldnt get into the love live sunshine spinoff
wrong yuzu
Rit is just good
too perfect
too pure
Yuzu is like
best girl
Rit is fucking
real close to breaking into the top
Shin no Nakama is good
Which of the top 4 will end as AotS is still very much up in the air
want to learn which fansubs are good cause I know the netflix subs are almost as bad as Takt Op
gonna wait til the season ends for Komi prob
Best of the season:
Irina
Senpai
Taishou
Aquatope

Good:
Shin no Nakama
Jahy
Douki
Mieruko
Douki
86
Saihate 
World Trigger

Fine:
Assassin isekai
Isekai Shokudou

Trash:
Fruit of Evolution
Takt Op
lets see what am I watching
sadly
i gave that 2 episodes but I couldn't quite get into it
Irina
What else
Taishou
Senpai
My top this season is like
One of the best of the season
Senpai is good
do you have anything else to go off of?
not for everybody
<:MeguShrug:586122984637595658>
so all the goofy party dynamics
including director
it gives a lot of Konosuba vibes, mostly because it has a lot of the same staff
and it might have a story, who knows
theres some other characters
Pecorine is cute
Kyaru is cute
its cute
some potnetially interesting sol
priconne s2
lots of basic fantasy
but it looks like itll have stuff to entertain
cant say i recognize a lot of this
New Mahouka ep
lets see, next season
but it has some good ones at least
yea its not an exceptional season
latest episode was very good
so theres at least a decent selection of good shows this season
I see a lot of people raving about Ousama ranking too
all 4 very good
and Aquatope 2nd cour
Senpai ga Uzai
Taisho Otome
Irina
my top this season is like
i almost didnt give S2 a shot with how bad S1 was, glad I did
but you have to be an individual that survived World Trigger S1
World Trigger S3 is good
almost breaking into ym top tier of the season
Shin No Nakama is just good tho
entertaining enough story and characters
cute designs
assassin is still kinda middling but
https://gfycat.com/tinteddaringamericanbobtail
the shin no nakama ep good too
ye
DJ goddess
that bodysuit
Maha ended up cometing w/ Tarte for best girl real fast
yes
i just want wholesome fuuka
or what
i wonder if theyre building to kukuru quitting
the shit she pulled when Chiyu wasnt going to do overtime
ditching work
but Kukuru needs to fix her own issues (outside of the AD)
theres definitely no redeeming the AD
episode ends with her MIA
ditching work to care for the dolphin etc
Kukuru has her own issues outside of him
that doesnt justify half this shit
It feels like they want it to be this throw Kukuru into the pool to teach her how to swim thing but like
hes maliciously incompetent
but at the same time
with how soft he was on her after the presentation
it really feels like theyre setting up to redeem the AD
being Kukuru is suffering
Taisho Otome spoiler for today
pizza butt
Today I learned MAL can count to 1000
comically pathetic villains
highly unlikeable MC
the most recent episode was the best, the rest of the episodes ahve been largely atrocious
Takt Op is a hot fucking mess
uh what
yes Aquatope will be good
and thats about all I will give it
sure, Takt is prettier than Symphogear S1
which I strongly disagree with
you also said "most of the things it does are better than Symphogear"
entirely self absorbed MC
theres only so many times I can tolerate Takt whining about wanting to play the piano and not caring about literally anybody else
there is a long distance between not the most amazing MC and I literally want to turn the show off when the MC is on screen
and not enough to save the train wreck
but theyre barely present
the only redeeming characters are like, Anna, Lenny and Titan
Takt Op easily has the least likeable MC ive had the misfortune of watching in a long time
but you just had to ignore the last 7 episodes of completely uninspired cardboard
are almost likeable
the MC and Destiny
the most recent ep of Takt Op was genuinely good
fighting alien creatures with music based powers
and I can see the points of comparison
in terms of themes, and style, it is similar
comparing Takt Op is an insult to Symphogear, thats how bad Takt Op is
an entirely uninspired and uninteresting plot
Easy AOTS for me.
Uma S2 a masterpiece
As it stands, probably the best non sequel I watched was Vivy
Easily best of the year
If I could rate it only on the first 8 or so episodes
God I wish Fena had stuck the landing
Best sequel horse

At least best sequel is easy
I keep hearing rave reviews of Ousama Ranking too
||Honestly... I'd rather see Kukuru suffer over that bloodied penguin. Not that I particularly want to see either, but if you put a gun to my head and forced me to choose||
first rule of ||penguin fight club. You don't talk about penguin fight club||
shes too good for Kukuru
Fuuka too wholesome for this world
today on Trainwreck Op Destiny
death flags
death flags everywhere
Also ||Fuuka deserves better than Kukuru don't @ me||
Sorry but ||Yuri bait show is yuri bait. How gay can they make the characters without actually calling them gay. *Especially* with the male childhood friend who's clearly crushing on Kukuru||
one of the few anime I would recommend dubbed
Ultimate is also excellent to watch Dubbed
compared to Ultimate?
~~and Fuuka deserves better than Kukuru~~
they kinda already set up the Kai thing
if anything, like I said above and like Ash said
nothing is ever gonna happen
It's 100% yuri bait
They hated him because he told the truth
