Thank you!
5?  I don't think I could function with *only* 5
I was just given this link and couldn't resist.  And yeah, what's *one more* discord server at this point...

I just borrowed a little inspiration from Dr.Horrible, where Captain Hammer has to explain his comment
Ach
I think this might have a *little* more impact...
While there was some Revenge story in Shield Hero, I think that bit detracted from the overall story.  You have someone who's basically shit on going out there and making a difference because he trats the world like a real world, instead of just some game to have fun in like the other Heros.  There's actually some growth to it.  

The betrayal at the beginning is shitty, and I think the MC is turned off others for a little too long, but other than that, I thought the show had a lot of potential..

The whole trial of the King and Daughter later on though..  it was just petty filler..  the show probably could have been better without it, or with a simple exile.. but the renaming aspect was just petty and childish.

Redo, on the other hand..   I watched it to see what the buzz was about, and it's just..   I don't know if it can really recover from that.  I mean, it could go on to have a phenomenal story, but it wouldn't really matter because of how bad the first few episodes are.
I see mention of Gohan, and wonder who is named Rice
