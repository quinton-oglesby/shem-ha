<:nene_scream:670463442343428127>
Yeah they cleared two
~~can’t Teemo make a new account?~~
But I hope Teemo gets a good rest
I can’t really complain about it though when I got 5/7 from teemo’s help
My rng sucks
~~didn’t get a red still~~ <:NotLikeClaudine:636922023888814100>
Yeah, cleared a power raid from za

Teemo even helped and I didn’t get the red gem
<:AyaDed:511063532880789518>
I’ll wait until tomorrow to try to get Chris Lv 70
Teemo is sleeping now <:kasumiCheer:426585348039114752>
<:KarenYabai:487283095943380993>

My raid rng sucks
<:Despasayo:498189358487306241>
Why game why
Thank you Teemo!
Teemo is helping us
Teemo is really nice
<:kasumiCry:589654698752213014>
I was bringing it down
Oh I just killed it LOL
Which one?
Nice!
LOL
f
I need to finish my other two and I'll dog pile with you XD
Sunset just finished
but I think I'm getting 4th
I'm doing sunset right now to raise my ranking
~~I need to do damage~~ <:Despasayo:498189358487306241>
I got lucky and got a bunch of 4*blue shirabe
I was doing the other raids and all I see is Cais's 800k as I scroll down <:XD:527154185981132811>
Wow Cais that damage
XD
I thought its suppose to be cause too
Oh its the power relic that has a move called cause
f
Since after Chris I have enough to limit unlock 1 or 2 more characters
I can also try for giga tech and Intell too
Yeah I'm still one away
I'm probably going to do these in hopes for getting the Giga power today <:yayimusak:356679757187907587>
I found the other half way one too

~~Waiting for the picture to appear~~

I been doing the top one for a while <:kasumiCheer:426585348039114752>
There is a power raid going on that is at lower half <a:aBlobCycloneFaster:444994738160926721>
Its better to save for the future, I'm just mlb for best girl Shirabe and Chris <:XD:527154185981132811>
I need to UL my blue Shirabe
Thanks Cais for your power raid
Got it! <:SayoDab:652638892373180454>
Ok, thank you!
Oh Angela, can you make some space for me to follow you?
I need to do that <:KokoroSlain:481681707695603733>
I didn’t get a single Giga power <:Despasayo:498189358487306241>
at the moment
Also Gridlock I can't find anymore
<:KasumiOk:470669730274082817>
Oh I'm still in another raid so I wouldnt be able to poke it much <:KokoroSlain:481681707695603733>
<:SayoBruh:511064259711467520>
My losses are mostly from that one unit
Same, the Erenbikki screws me over
As the gap between the current ranks and 100 are huge
Yeah, a lot of the top spots are from people using their song stones to get T100
Ooo I heard the news Teemo is here?!
Imma just join some for fun, I need intelligent and tech raids now so I'm focusing on that
Ahahaha.... there are so many raids now
Its teemo <:AyaWow:432993136265134091>
... Mine got full?! <:AkoPanic:511062797959036958>
Ohh okay!
Ahhh... You need to make more accounts the more you do these raids?
Congrats!
True <:KokoroSlain:481681707695603733>
Everyone is naming themself <:AyaWow:432993136265134091>
I need to join the blues
Ah I need some blues too
Ahahaha... I'm in the same situation again Punchkun
Thank you Teemo! I haven't seen Sanic yet <:KokoroSlain:481681707695603733>
