but yea
just need either 1-2 full commission job and i can comfortably buy any belt
my spirit/performance reached their hearts
the only thing thats missing is the armor
i needed to use thicker material
hence needing to remake the suit at some point if i am buying Juuga Driver
im not sure if i want to buy juuga driver so i can remake the juuga armor for another event thats not that one 

or if i should buy another kamen rider belt for another kamen rider so i have a new armor instead
and what the judge said to me
now after the event and all of that
Me and 001
