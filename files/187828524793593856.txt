Thanks!
I posted a story recap with pics if anyone wants to check it out and refresh their mind and/or correct my lore: https://www.reddit.com/r/Symphogear/comments/da7hj4/symphogear_story_recap_before_the_finale/
It was just a translation error everyone. Don't worry, I fixed it.

They've made spirit appearances before I'm pretty sure.
Re:Chris, she has an altar in her room and talks to her dead parents every day, so she's probably fine
During the black screen, they confessed, kissed, then Hibiki proposed. Happy ever after.
This explains my understanding of the whole Fine situation: https://www.reddit.com/r/Symphogear/comments/da7hj4/symphogear_story_recap_before_the_finale/
It increases the link coefficient, which  reduces the damage.
She didn't take any linker at the concert.
I don't think so.
Fine orchestrated that.
Kanade died because she didn't have LiNKER in her system.
Everyone else had some angsty relationships... meanwhile Kirika and Shirabe were over there doing POLYFILM SCISSOR LOVE DREAMS. Kirika and Shirabe already solved the series.
That weird hairstyle is actually force-dampening springs. First opportunity she's had to use it in the series.
I like when Tsubasa turned Tear Rain into Iceberg Rain https://imgur.com/eUeJB2I
I want to take Miku for myself! ... So I can hold her hand platonically!
POLYFILM SCISSOR LOVE DREAMS
My bd downloads didn't have them translated so I streamed them from somewhere else.
I'm dumb and don't know how to quote, sorry.
>still need to fit fighting songs in there somewhere though
It's a musical
SOL that ends with  Hibiki/Miku marriage and Shirabe catching the bouquet
I think we all agree lol
I mean purposeful on the writer/whoever choosing it for the name of the song/attack
Cause that's pretty damn cool
I saw somewhere that metanoia is ai no tame backwards with japanese mora, and that means "for love". Was this purposeful or coincidence?
Agreed. I also love the build-up of Chris's new song.
I was so happy seeing hanasaku yuuki after loving that concert duet in the 2018 live
When you have so much to fist so you grow two more fists
"Watch Symphogear", truly the fastest, shortest path! Steady, straight ahead!
Hibiki parrying tank shells always gets my heart racing.
Well, that's how I learned about symphogear too.

Much gratitude.
Ah, best currency
Do you guys get paid?
I imagine Shirabe to be a more nyaa person and Kirika to be more wan wan
Shem-Ha is the scorpion. Here's her silver scorpion mech https://imgur.com/tCufYle
<@237434678355689472> Anunnaki made human prototype Adam. Adam founds the Illuminati. They develop Alchemy from Anunnaki tech aka Black Arts.
Then the concert
Maybe it was Noble Red because she saved them
<@!327840556959006720> She can just be singing and looking at the glowy ball and light show in the middle of the room
They celebrated it, but it was off-camera.
Hopefully they fix the cameo thing in the bds.
Chris has a shrine dedicated to her parents in her room and she talks to it frequently.
https://imgur.com/HSZCL88
Anyone notice how Hibiki and Maria's wings come from their back, Tsubasa and Chris's come from their hips, and Kirika and Shirabe's come from their heads?
Reminder that Carol was trying to save Miku, but if she wasn't she totally could have turned a God into gold.
They're built with Carol's consciousness, which is now gone, so no more autoscorers.
I want to see Garie one more time
idk, I think that would be a bit weird.
I hope what I want to tell you is the same thing you want to tell me.
I love y-                   I'm hungr-
um.                           Oh.
Yeah,
You get lots of nipple depending on the rating.
The culture that values great butt and crotch shots
It's okay, during the end screen they confess, kiss, get married, then have lots of sex.

Symphogear's final epic attack was hugging it out.
Metanoia grew on me a lot over the season.
I'm waiting for translated songs for ep13
<@125353790537728001> XD
<@!476058996315389953> maybe they use all the silver and gold to pay for the most extravagant wedding ever
Nice, so basically you're just doing what the show should have done
<@!476058996315389953> what's it about?
I would play XDU if I knew Japanese..
seeing the improvement is hype when rewatching though
They're not sticking with SONG?
With a tiny pistol
Which one has babies first though?
They've also been sleeping together for years
https://informationisbeautiful.net/visualizations/covid-19-coronavirus-infographic-datapack/
first paragraph https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/summary.html
and the disease is called COVID-19, standing for coronavirus disease 2019
technically the virus is called SARS-CoV-2
googled it and it seems possible gluten can affect mood https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6266949/
Idk if omad is good for most people, but it doesn't typically put you in much danger as far as I understand.
And for a decent meal a day, that's a common diet that people use to be healthier by eating less than their normal unhealthy diets.
But you can be pretty confident that you won't die if you go 2 weeks with a small meal every day.
Obviously not recommended.
There will be no flat rule for basically any medical advice. 3 weeks is a common number given out, and it appears there is evidence for people surviving 30-40 days.
You can survive without food for 3 weeks.
Done very often by many people.
And the US has more infections than China despite having less than 1/4 the population.
https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/us/

NY has over 37,000 cases thus far.
Nice. On a similar topic, I saw an interview with a domestic abuse expert talking about how under quarantine victims have it much worse and it's basically impossible to get help. Makes sense and is concerning. I don't think anything can even be done about that except listening out for your neighbors being beaten and reporting it.

There are all kind of strategies people use to push their politics without any substance, facts, or logic. Lots of "argument" smoke and mirrors. First step is to recognize it https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLJA_jUddXvY7v0VkYRbANnTnzkA_HMFtQ
Also the electoral college is shit. 1 person's vote should be equal to another person's vote. Your vote shouldn't count less because your state has lots of people.
We should all do condorcet voting where everyone ranks candidates https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condorcet_method

Or at least not first-past-the-post which is the laziest, shittiest voting system.

It's probably just another blame the scapegoat situation.
Early coronavirus info was all from WHO collecting the data and giving press conferences. Maybe they didn't get totally accurate info from China, but they were extremely valuable in presenting the information they could gather and distributing test kits to various countries.
not quick enough wrt the administration in charge
Trump appointed this guy https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_Gorsuch
and later the one you're thinking about https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brett_Kavanaugh
And Congress blocked Obama from appointing a SC judge (without voting on it) for like 300 days so Trump could could appoint a conservative judge.
NK doesn't have a superpower coercing other countries to pretend it doesn't exist.
They were holding conferences about it for a while before they declared pandemic too.

That German cover is high quality. Awesome.
