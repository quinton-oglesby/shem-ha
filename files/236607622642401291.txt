👋 hello!
welcome!
yep! that's her outfit from the current event
ooooh, much better
Fox Kanade and Tiger Bikki
👀
i love it!
aww that's a good nico
i cried, thats too cute
Yep. I’ve died and gone to heaven. MariaChris is perfect 💖💖💖
Being Bikki is suffering almost always :v
you drew you, and you're pretty! there's nothing wrong with appreciating that fact
there's nothing wrong with admiring your own work, even if it is a self portrait
not at all!
that would look amazing framed
cute!!!!
👀👀👀 Kanade Drive
am v tired
nvm, carnival is from the game :V
i'm partial to MegaDeth Carnival but i will agree that Queen's Inferno is top tier










me @ zenbu
i refuse to romance anyone who isn't named Haru Okumura
cutest teacher
still no shame! you're pretty! and you can enjoy the fact that you're pretty c:
Gamer that was mean
MAHAA
Also though
pls
is that Chris?
is
I want to hug sad Chris
Omg sad Chris D:
no need to apologize ❤
that's a lot of mights. things that *might* happen. but they don't have to be your future. there's just as many positive outcomes are there are negative ones. I personally believe that you'll eventually get to be yourself without fear of persecution. it's hard to have hope for yourself. i myself struggle with that a lot. so that's why i'll have hope for you c:
it's an awful path to walk a lot of the time. it's dangerous, and you'll often be vilified for it. and i am so, so sorry that you'll have to deal with it. but it also gets better. i promise you, while its hell right now, it absolutely will get better.
my family still has issues with me being trans so I'm all too familiar with that kind of garbage
i'm very familiar with this kind of situation. i'd offer hugs if i could Rakhi ❤
it's still not too bad. in canada we're used to traveling for hours and still being nowhere. at least in the states there's like a town every two minutes :p
i'm like a two hour drive away from the niagara border
oh hey! you'll be relatively close to where i live then!
;_; i want to give you a big hug
oh nice!
jesus thats terrifying! is there anything else that can be done to help you?
D:
you're all lovely ❤
D: i'm glad you're all okay now!
i try to be humorous about it, cause otherwise it'd be super depressing lmao
and Fine thought she knew pain :v
well, on the inside. my skin is just super stretchy but there's no more padding in my joints so all my bones are grinding on each other
oh, sorry, i stepped away for dinner. i have a genetic disorder called Ehler Danlos Syndrome. it's a defect in my connective tissue so i'm literally falling apart :v
oh, i should have specified. i have a physical disability :v
~~any other disabled people here?~~
yep! Lucifer added me in earlier today. also thank you for the hugs ❤
^this. i ended up like that
it is chronic unfortunately
like, if i had another option i'd take it, but i'm just too scared to try any opioids for pain relief so weed it is
the novelty wears off, but my need for pain relief doesn't :v
one thing Colorado and Canada have in common- the good green pain relief is legal in both places now
i can finagle some stuff on my end to expedite the process probably
you should all just more to canada :^)
don'cha kno
lol i'm 27
lol i can't remember the last time anyone called me that. i'll probably be okay by tomorrow afternoon. thanks for asking though ❤
this is why i don't go outside anymore <:ChrisEmbarassed:336656400472080386>
who's got two thumbs and fucked up her back?
this dumbass :v
There’s a lot that goes into it, more than most people realize
I had to retire from the hobby because my POS disabled body couldn’t keep up with the physical or skill based demands
Again, not necessarily
You can be good at a LARPs mechanics but if you’re a shit fighter it doesn’t matter
Not necessarily
There’s almost no difference
I have lots of friends in both communities
HEMA is just larping for SUPER SRS PPL
And you get to fight with p much any weapon you want
It’s so much fun
Dude just larp instead
Archery! 😄
America as a whole right now is frankly disgusting. There are a lot of wonderful people living there (see: the beautiful people on this server), but there’s far more scumbags who either need to A) die, or B) be locked up
Ban all guns. Bam, problem solved
~~also hello I’m not dead anymore~~
Doesn’t mean that negates the rest of the party wanting me, Saki, and every other trans person dead. A small amount of not shit people don’t mean the shit people don’t exist
¯\_(ツ)_/¯ good enough
Sorry 😐
Seriously, between this and your fucking “let’s all be friends” middle ground political bullshit, I’m surprised you have any friends at all
Then you have a shitty understanding of it
You wanna see what larp is like? Go look up Bicolline (in Quebec) or any of the large scale European games
No, what’s edgy is you putting down a hobby you haven’t even tried because of inaccurate assumptions you’ve likely gathered from biased media. This along with the fact that you’re completely unwilling to even consider the idea as something you’d want to do based on those false assumptions is what makes you a holier-than-thou edgelord
Ah, so you’re just a holier-than-thou edgelord then

actually, it is about fuel taxes
fuel tax hikes
Country by country we’re falling into complete chaos and I am genuinely concerned that we’ll see another world war in our lifetime
The whole world is.
