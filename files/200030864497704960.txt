Rewatch and new season hype <:GermainOnFire:457676909455736840>
It's the top google result if you search symphogear discord 🤔 only thing I can figure, is it publicly listed on the discord communities page?
she looks great when I pose her
The basa figma I got was so worth though <:MariaHappy:236871184807886848>
<:ChibiDess:391790922565812225>
<:MeguDead:447369042936856577>

Dess is Cute
I thought there was more I hadn't found
Oh hahaha
wait where'd you find the translated xdu comics 😮
so that's how she does her hair
https://imgur.com/a/Z9lKI
It looks more like a younger geah picture
man that might be fanart but i would have assumed it was from the show or something otherwise


https://imgur.com/a/4NzL7
music is art
technically
was Standy Up Ready, Standy Up Lady, and then the instrumental versions of both
yeah the CD I got
third is instrumental
tv
second is t
First looks like studio
Unless you get the BDs I suppose
4:10
yeah Stand Up Ready CD version is
they tend to not do the sing yelling asmuch in studio versions
but
Audio is usually a bit cleaner as well
no voice lines for one
i want the studio version from the more recent Axz songs
I can see if I can rip the songs and upload them
I have the Stand Up Ready CD actually
the CD version is amazing
I love stand up ready from this season
So I run Amazon for SteelSeries for example
I plan and manage Amazon global marketplaces for different corporations
Hell I play XDU at work
Hmm yeah

I was listening to that on my phone today at work
Some but not all
<:MariaBliss:336657061209309184>
I've just been taking all these maria pics so it's worked out well thanks
to do songs
plus they could still find some way
and do some goofy slice of life comedy series, maybe even in the zesshoushanai(SP?) style
what attack on titan did with attack on titan high school
Just do like
and interact/hang out with everyone
So serena and Kanade can come back
after the main story is over
we get some sort of alternative media series
I do hope
XDU has helped her a lot
Once those get too big I'll just make further subfolders
Maria/Basa pictures in another
So like Maria solo pictures into one folder
I do by picture type
Though
I just sort Maria stuff


Chris x Food OTP

📸
I eclipse my entire office in nerdiness/weebdom by so much it's not even funny
hah no
but i've been debating bringing in my tsubasa figma and setting it up in there
I keep a couple figures on my desk at work none from anime yet
if I can get this company to make me a figure
I should see
Oh man
go with my Cecillia and Chitoge
I'd buy a maria nedroid in a heartbeat
that was a fan make
was a custom kit from Comiket
The only Maria figure I'v ever seen
but those run like $150
There's some super nice bellfine's
I got a tsubasa figma for like ~$60 off Amazon
There's so few of them available in the West too
I'm okay with this
*Senpais team up to take advantage of defenseless Kouhai*
<:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>

There was also this one






man today was a good twitter art monday
I want that new Kanade Maria memoria to get translated
I thought this was Maria in Kanade's Gungir first
How much time passes right at the end of s1 between the incident and then the reveal of them being alive
I think wait
Yes
do we know?
Since 3.5 has to happen during august
So that would then mean GX ended in July
which I think if I remember grades are posted 3 times
My only knowledge is from persona
cause Chris was helping them with their homework right?
yeah that was in a Zesshou to I think
but shes's a  year ahead of bikki
Okay that makes sense then
that's 4 cataclysmic events in about a year
How is the rest of the world not a mess
marks the turnover of a new school year
I don't think summer break there
relatively speaking
Oh that's not that long then if it's only 2 weeks
Yeah there's the start of S1 up to Biki "death" time skip, reveal of them being alive, timeskip G
Man they were with FiS forever then
Oh wow
for 3 of the last 4 years
jesus April-May have sucked in this time line
perish the thought
Tsubasa really does like older women
we can confirm
So all in all
She was how old at the time 15?
I wish it said all you get in ep 1 is the 2 years earlier overlay
the concert is 2 years before the end of s1
but there's not a visible date on in
there's a newspaper miku's dad is reading in s1 ep1 during the zwei wing concert
omg that was awesome
<:thonk:393573712760406018>
<:Thinkki:388829211311472641>
You could write such an angsty fic about Hunter Basa coming across Lady Maria


oooh new art I don't have 📸
<:MariaHappy:236871184807886848>

<:MariaHappy:236871184807886848>


hussies
they're not even wearing gloves
<:LEWD:419228593961435147>
"WHO IS YOUR FATHER AND WHAT DOES HE DO"
there's the one pic where it looks like Kanade's head was stuck on the bodybuilder's body
<:MariaHappy:236871184807886848>
Oh yeah now that I look the hair is 100% basa
I think it's just the facial expression
huh basa looked like Kanade too me
is that maria and Kanade?
wait I think there was one to the Fine event
I don't believe XDU has had an event sequel yet
I think at the end of the edgebikki storyline Edgebikki and altMiku are going to meet up/have met up now
^
she isn't dead, at least from what I remember
it'd just be...surprsing to see them let Fine walk around with them after what she did/pulled. St. Germain would seem to fit into that kind of role better but that's just my opinion
Oh of that I'm not sure
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JeYIlET3szA
all over again
i feel like it'd be that ProZD video
Late this summer most likely

I'm excited for full release
Her?

my favorite is UMP45
Vector a qt
open beta should start at the end of the month with the full EN release sometime after that
yeah
Sorry sadly I don't have a source for that Girl's Frontline Pic, I found it on their discord server <:MariaShocked:273278132184940544>
<:KanadeSitting:268593107732398081>
just evolve the gears instead of getting new personas
Oh yeah
just because it requires an MC kun and that'd be...really weird
idk if a persona style JPRG would work
<:topnep:389579295896633344>
That would be fun
<:MariaShocked:273278132184940544>

<:BlobSweats:356568919743660035>
I'm just a bit taller than Adam <:MariaHappy:236871184807886848>
I dunno I imagine elf9 just sits in her office spinning in her chair instead of working on the linker
elf9 can get a new role in XV doing her actual job
I just want one good Maria figure, or I guess I should say I want A Maria figure considering none have been made
I don't like the lack of the cat ears or the facial expression but I'm picky
I really wish the Maria plushie looked better, I still want it but I don't love the way it looks <:MariaShocked:273278132184940544>
JFC that Biker Maria pose <a:ablobsweats:412748432944529410>

Nice <:MariaHappy:236871184807886848> Just watch some of the edges of words, Chris cuts off Room in the last panel of the 2nd comic. So it looks like she's saying Roon
Did you guys typeset this yourselves?

<:MariaHappy:236871184807886848>
I just ordered her Nedroid today
but tbh I barely pay attention to XDU stories
I don't think there's an AU dmjii
but it's cute
I mean given Serena's complete lack of characterization outside of pure imouto it's a total crackship
Plus the fan given personality to Serena matches up in a very amusing way with Kanade
oh yeah
She was good at it just she was wacky
she spent the entire time pretending and narrating what was going on, like the Indiana Jones show she liked
Nah she was the nutty one in miner
in the miner/dungeon event though
Serena was really funny
<:TsubaHmph:230502632974843904>

Episode one Nanzo
`EPISODE 01 "From Beyond Human History"
A casket, sealed away in ages past, surfaces in midsummer.
What lies within is sin, punishment— And the truth.
Its silence is stunning, as words themselves are stolen away.

The fiends of remnant gaze down from above, freed from their yokes.
Dreaming of a future denied, they seek vengeance for a disgrace suffered.`

Miku is gonna team up with Enki to purge the world of anything that's gonna ruin Bikki's normal life
mega gay
it's like
Bikki B side song TL
||To You Alone

The sun begins to set, the wind begins to change
The streetlamps quietly come alight

Anxiety and loneliness
Trying to distract me

I'm afraid now, I'm scared of being alone
The past stares back at me in the dark of night

My hand, my heart, my everything
All for the future

But all I can do now is destroy

The ache in my heart slowly envelopes me
I try to see the night where I'm not lonely anymore

As the galaxy falls around us
I squeeze your hand tightly

I know I can't cry, but...

I'm a tattered, uncool weakling of a hero
Whenever you weren't in danger, I failed to notice your tears

Just by saying that I'd return soon, I was hurting you
I didn't even give you the chance to try and protect me

You thanking me for being born,
All of your spirit, gave me the courage to stand

Now I have to respond to your love

I'm no good with difficult things
I don't know how to say this, but

On this star out of all the ones in the sky
Let's live out our time together

Just joining our hands is a miracle!

My hand, my heart, my everything
Were all for the future

I want to promise an eternity to you
The time that's engraved into your name

Those days where we could just say "see you tomorrow"
Standing in the sunshine, a flower was able to bloom

Let's make our dreams sound out

Let's live our lives together

Being a tattered, uncool hero is fine
As long as I can protect the single person in front of me||
<a:springdabsfaster:580751185531764776> Milhi too fast
I think we're getting either a Maria or Basa sad ballad <:TsubasaExcited:409481619842400257>
Maria's AXZ transformation was amazing
<:Ver:244664866529345537>
👀
ep 2 pv and next CD announcement should come soon too
a lot of the continuing series
<:Ver:244664866529345537>
though Vinland Saga was amazing
but new stuff is limited
are really good
Lasting Song
Yeah
The first arc of Yu-gi-oh that wasn't in the anime was super dark
<:homeThonk:484732324198744097>
some are definitely meant to be used as a form of mockery tho
Which is a cr rip
Horriblesubs
Available as a torrent from HS

kiri is lewd
You might need to flip the sub track on

<:jam:450352537623724032>
The opening shot of basa and Maria running and fighting is <:JustFine:256624508025307137>
That thigh shot
her AXZ one was <:yummy:235243310086750208> too
Shirabe's are usually pretty fuckin lewd
god how lewd are the Maria, Shirabe and Chris henshins gonna get <:MariaGasm:507595615040045086>
<:yummy:235243310086750208>
hopefully original is on the BD
I can't believe that's true it's so great
<:Ver:244664866529345537>
Yes
you can see the Durga power array
right at the start during the Maria/Serena shots
<:worriedserena:586122033075847168>
Hopefully Ogawa made it out
<:yummy:235243310086750208>
and this is the not as lewd version
Yes
or at least strongly connected to them
Maria was already known to be one I'm pretty sure
2 at most
There's just not enough time for that to play out effectively
the former is more likely than the latter
based on the vampys bio
personally
I'm pretty sure the corpse was the guy we saw in the opening scene of ep 1
Also it's not like their attacks wouldn't also hit the audience members, if Tsubasa just starts raining down swords it's gonna kill the people trying to escape
and there's also not 100,000 of them
but the shorter chapters have definitely not helped, the anime adaption might actually fix the pacing issues somewhat
the current arc has dragged on WAY too long
remotely close lol
Not even like
everyone knows youtube comments are where you go to find the finest and most well balanced conversations on any topic
I think it's just to invoke season 1 ep 1 not actually be the same person
which is probably why they had to change it
<:LUL:243896110001684480>
makes 0 sense
due to the timeframe now
which granted
people assumed Yugoslavia iirc
Yeah
and now <:Elfnein:231434633357688833> knows the secret to the recipe so they can freely replicate it
they had Ver's version which was better than Ryoko's version
Alchemists caused the nuclear meltdown <:animejanai:444100532169211914>
Testament is a banger of a song
I think I like Lasting Song more though
Its a really good song I really like it
Yah
Maria will be some great shots <:yummy:235243310086750208> and probably a good amount of chain whips
^
Adam was a fun villain
<:ADAM:338363978797547539>
the only villain I'd want back this season is Fine
maybe this is all part of his Hyuga genetics tier plotting and he's operating on 5D Chess plans
like him paying off the alchemists to attack the concert to try and force Tsubasa on his side
there's a lot they could do with Fudou that would be horrific <:ChriGraine:232987926349217792>
she's gonna become lady kazanari when Maria proposes to her <:MariaConfident:336657338729627658>
Also that's an incredibly nuanced discussion that's exceedingly difficult to have in a crowded and fast moving discord channel
<:GarieHee:255583679332483072>
so who knows what madness awaits in the second half of the season
also that ep 4 quote, I believe, comes from an interview from about halfway through recording
I agree with that
what life <:Ver:244664866529345537>
The fact that it's Serena and Maria as kids with the shot of the power array in the background makes me think it's gonna be less about Serena and Maria specifically and more about their family/bloodline
hell AXZ literally had characters just being like "This is my motivation and problems"
ever since then though it's been pretty blunt
<:GarieHee:255583679332483072>
subtlety is not geahs strong suit
it wouldn't even fit
it is interesting seeing the reaction to the episode across the different communities
I need to go back and double check this but I know Maria is the only one either known to be a user or connected with them since that was a condition of her release at the start of GX
Maria wouldn't have made it out of G without becoming a witch <:lul:497179258326614035>
No mikugeah no resurrections
God please no
Mind Flaying doesn't really suggest that but I guess it's possible 🤔
<:ChriGraine:232987926349217792>
God that Shinai was hillarious
<:Basically:409081694109433866>
<:MariaEmbarrassed:364433057517797379>
and here i am excited cause hanyw is doing Maria's henshin and he's the biggest fan on the animation team <:yummy:235243310086750208>
<:MariaYell:336657352264646657>
<:CUHRAYZEEver:232760673740783627>
I wish to see the masterpiece the HabaCar has created
which I suppose is a running thesis of Geah
I would have loved to see more in developing the relationships between the different pairs the idea was good but the execution wasn't great
they had similarities but they spent so little time developing and speaking about them that the pairings didn't carry the weight they should have. Maria and Chris DO have similar backstories and shared items but there was 0 time spent on that <:MariaShocked:497711685109547009>
I think the issue is both points are right
<:MariaHappy:236871184807886848>

protect this smile
I also know TsubaMari has the lowest % chance of getting any actual development/focus this season, I'd be happy with a battle duet and maybe a good ending where they go off to sing together
people like different pairings <:Shrug:580570288702488579>
Eh
Nah Sat
and that wasn't live that was the BD batches afterwards
just AXZ
lol
I'm pretty sure we're getting more about Airgetlahm this season so here's to hoping
that was awesome <:MariaConfident:336657338729627658>
She already had the single punch into transformation in GX
ep 3 preview comic

👀
Shirabe CD is out
definitely possible
the likely assumption is Maria this week and then Tsubasa at some point in the future
Yes <:MariaConfident:336657338729627658>
suggestive manner <:yummy:235243310086750208>
my guess is we'll get a similar ep structure to last week with a Maria henshin and rather unconnected action scene to start before moving into a Bikki and Miku centric 2nd half of the episode
yeah I'd put good money on getting Maria this week
What are you betting on? 🤔
<a:KomiPointerUp:511713316645765120>
<:ChriGraine:232987926349217792>
<:BikkiSad:497709420122341386>
cause that was impressive
now I wanna watch the rest
I caught Fire force ep 1
especially with it really just being set up for XV
so it just won't get talked about
its good but not great
AXZ is gonna suffer the same fate as G eventually I feel
GX gets talked about A LOT because people dislike it so much
usually it's split between S1 and G
I know a lot of people that feel like S1 is the best
Really?
by a decent margin I feel like
right now if it maintains this level it'll be the best season
this has been a fantastic season so far
I had no fear about Maria's treatment this episode I knew she was gonna get an amazing sequence and she did <:MariaHappy:236871184807886848>
<:MariaConfident:336657338729627658>
<:MariaHappy:236871184807886848>
he treated her so well
Bless Hanyw
That henshin was a work of art
and YTs version of Shirogane no Honoo is superior <:MariaConfident:336657338729627658>
what a fucking great episode <:MariaHappy:236871184807886848>
oh same
Personally, this was like peak symphogear to me. It was one of the best ep of the series so far. Maria song, fight, and henshin were all incredible especially the quality. And the entire back half of the ep with the Amalgam gear and the st.germain/bikki duet was just like peak geah <:MariaHappy:236871184807886848>
weird seeing how opinions on this ep are crazy different among people
<a:MariaShake:493803268850319360>
<a:HyperChris:396506394804879361>
I can't wait to buy the Maria CD
<:wow:257239526441746434>
yeah okay i thought you meant something else
Oh
but I need to go back over G to be sure of that
I want to say her gungnir was not the same as Kanade's
I need it
Shirogane no Honoo was 🔥
<:MariaConfident:336657338729627658>
i'm gonna be buying the Maria CD through a proxy as soon as it drops next week
I'd be really surprised if they resold the XV Cds, but buying them isn't too bad. I was able to get the Maria AXZ CD off of NA Amazon pretty easily
hanyw really loves Maria <:maria_happy3:584389762052259856>

Eh she could still be hurt and bleeding but I do also doubt it's Maria
Nazo for tomorrow's episode
`Symphogear: Climax Song of the Valkyries - Episode 05 "What Was Hidden in the Bag"

The words sealed away are finally and suddenly blurted out.
I couldn't reveal my feelings, nor myself.
I vent my frustration onto you, the one that will never understand.

How many mountains of bodies and rivers of blood must be created in order to protect the flame?
As clouds combine to plunge the road into shadow, death approaches even as you desperately attempt to escape.`

<:GarieHee:255583679332483072>
Yeah I'd stay away from Twitter
yeah 100% do not spoil this episode
<:Ver:244664866529345537>
👏
nah but I imagine it'll be hard for elfnein to remake them. I imagine Carol is going to have to burn her memories of this current situation to use her alchemy and will end up vanishing by the end of the scene
maybe we'll get an epilogue thing of Elfnein trying to rebuild them or something
I think both Carol and the autoscorers will be fully gone by the end of next ep
is this the little matchstick girl?
personally, I think Carol will be gone after this scene. I think she's gonna use up the memories she has left and fade away similar to Fine leaving just Elfnein behind
or some approximation of them
i think at most we'll get an epilogue thing about Elfnein trying to rebuild them
<:DEDEDESS:230494351560540160>
I actually really liked Adam as a villain <:GarieHee:255583679332483072>

https://twitter.com/YameteTomete
all the tl'd comics are on the twitter page, idk if anyone has pulled them and put them into an imgur album yet
for this one not yet
no one understands the degeneracy of weebs better than other weebs <:MariaConfident:336657338729627658>

Weebs <:AngeryChris:281802280985165824>
so there's still some new geah content coming out after the season ends
and the live
there's still Shinais
<:GarieHee:255583679332483072>
Just watch the ep solo?
when bikki was flying towards godbaby
we'll get Fadeaways if there are any deaths at best
That smug tango <:MariaConfident:336657338729627658>
XDU is meaningless
Yeah digital release was as soon as the ep was over
It's really good
<:GarieHee:255583679332483072>
also like every gear got knocked out during that sequence
?
they're basically longer descriptions of important concepts, ideas, and people
there all 6 and 7 keywords were updated today
https://wiki.poweris.moe/wiki/List_of_Symphogear_XV_Episodes
I'm gonna buy at least a few copies of 1 and 2 each
I think between all of YTT we should be good
Well
<:JustFine:256624508025307137>
its gonna be so good at the live
BD4 <:ChriGraine:232987926349217792>
No its the song playing during the Xdrive sequence
and then they fight him
I'm still going with Fudou extracts Shemha from Miku somehow

they'll have FC subbed
if we don't beat commie out
It'll be a bit our normal typesetter is on vacation
no they're not
<:LUL:243896110001684480>
watching the livestream was basically like that this week
I mean
encoding is hard
oh you mean the dimming
Like Carol and Adam are roughly around the same level but they're both way stronger than the SG crew and the SG crew is WAY stronger than NR
NR is really weak
Carol and Adam are probably on similar power scales, off the top of my head first reaction
<:CUHRAYZEEver:232760673740783627>
Adam was specifically trying to prevent this <:ADAM:338363978797547539>
I can post again one sec
It's posted way up above
it is
Yes
keywords will be important for this week's episode
Yeah?
Oh yeah them betraying him wouldn't be surprising I'm more expecting them to pop up a la Cags and Prelati at the last minute more so
I think NR will be relegated to heroic sacrifice or fucking with Fudou unexpectedly at this point
it would make a lot of sense
i wouldn't be surprised if all of the adaptors sacrificed their geahs to defeat the final boss

and then they fought together during the car chase
CTF was about it
<:LUL:243896110001684480>
none of the above
I'm going with option D
I don't think Carol is going to be floating around anymore than St. Germain has continued too
It's not carol carol though
I could see Vanessa and Mil both dying in sacrifices and only cat making it
try and survive, prolly try and fuck with fudou if the opprotunity presents itself
I'm not sure who's talking about them trusting fudou again
oh
not you, you're making sense
No the shemha stuff
where are you getting this from?
????
<:GarieHee:255583679332483072>
Inferred friendship
Oh yeah you're not wrong but symphogear never takes time for character conversations like that
or if symphogear just had more episodes for character development like that
<:ADAM:338363978797547539>
basically us going into AXZ 12 all over again

<:kalinaGem:427818502141902848>
<:work:582681037759578123>
I thought it was completely destroyed during the frontier incident
is SSJ back in play?
Adventures of Pirate Fine
so them walking completely away from it seems unlikely but is the current announced plan
Symphogear prints money
the future is
<:lul:497179258326614035>
I could see NR wanting to switch to Shem-ha's side but I get the impression Shem-ha wants nothing to do with any of humanity
muh cute vampire
Once they're out
Keywords will give us a lot
I think his counter to Bikki being the god slayer is to have miku be the body of the god most likely to keep bikki from wanting to slay her
<:GarieWink:336657101273169921>
that's Maria's job
🤔
Miku would be a goddess too in this case like Aqua
<:BikkiSad:391790930967134208>
sadly it also had to involve him
Yeah they had to shoehorn a linker solution in there somehow
<:GarieWink:336657101273169921>
I went through what was available already
<:worriedserena:586122033075847168>
FC is still blasting on repeat <:JustFine:256624508025307137>
<:ChriGraine:232987926349217792>
<:GarieHee:255583679332483072>
that was Alien
that one wasn't me
that event never made it out of editing
oh yeah
<:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
shouldn't it be bike
Redeem her from what?
<:CUHRAYZEEver:232760673740783627>
tbf that is the rantings of Ver
<a:MariaShake:493803268850319360>
<:GarieHee:255583679332483072>
I figure with reselling those I can make back maybe 100 total?
yeah that's roughly where I'm ballparking it
🤔
I mean I guess I'm gonna end up spending more than that on BDs
god that'd be fucking evil <:ChriGraine:232987926349217792>
guaranteed ticket with the boxset <:GarieHee:255583679332483072>
<:MikuPraise:584465493176352768>
praise <:nana:348253132981141504>
Yet
Tactical Russian Deployment
So the belief in superiority makes sense
Shem ha is above humans
I mean
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
correctly
Especially since we see Miku reaching out towards what's presumably Shem-ha in an earlier episode if I remember
But that wouldn't be miku it'd be an approximation of Miku from Bikki's memories
the most twisted ending <:ChriGraine:232987926349217792>
oh god that'd be like
that would be awful
they just won't do that
yeah narratively you could construct an ending to fit that style
but I just can't see gear going for that
yeah the narrative bookends of having Tsubasa or Maria sacrifice themselves would be pretty cool
but those are the only two I could see
Maybe maaaaaybe Tsubasa dies instead
Like I could MAYBE see Maria sacrificing herself but even that seems HIGHLY unlikely
<:thonk:393573712760406018>
the chance of any gear user dying is like less than 5% imo
the chance of Miku dying is like less than 1%
I think it's the 2nd or 3rd highest rated show of the season
it's extremely popular
F
from hamster to handsome
<:PraiseTikki:398808517139628042>
and keywords
Gib song
<:PraiseTikki:398808517139628042>
Pure art
<a:02nod:580750168375427083>
so a bit of a toss up
Well I mean weren't the noise killed at the end of G, like Miku yeeting that thing back up into their dimension destroyed them I thought or was that just sealing them back inside their dimension. I know we've only had Alca-noise since GX
aren't the noise gone?
if not the vast majority of it
Yeah i'm expecting Kamiku to fuck off quickly into this episode and be gone for a good part of it
<:lul:497179258326614035>
It's gonna be so shit <:ChriGraine:232987926349217792>  ))
and Maria gets ver
if they did Amalgams for them all
God I'd be so annoyed
clearly they've moved up in the world
<:Happyjii:336396501771091969>
define have their shit together <:GarieHee:255583679332483072>
<a:confusedbu:586119489712816150>
I mean the end of S1 was a complete shock to her, they pulled a complete miracle to activate it
I'm sure she had contingencies
what delay? The basa CD?
this message brought to you by autoscorer gang <:MichaHee:260224421476696064>
none can escape the harem
lol that Maria emote
<a:15min:585535798338912286>
heaven right there <:MariaGasm:376533506345402368>
<:MariaConfident:336657338729627658>
watch him say something that's stupid yet profound that gives bikki the idea to save the day
I need to go back and watch that scene again, but I'm fairly sure they were talking about seeing each other again in that conversation
topdad is less surprising given the phone call earlier this season
I really like the XV designs
he finally gave up the last of his relevant information in AXZ he'd be included JUST for the meme of at this point
Ver has nothing left to contribute
I think some of the blocked bullets even ricocheted into the soldiers if I remember correctly
but that was with much stronger gears
<:MariaShocked:273278132184940544>
at least in Maria's defense they were actively firing at her
the Nazo?
it's pretty much what just those soldiers in the Office building right?
<:PraiseTikki:398808517139628042>

he comes for us all
<:useless:272874872416370689>
everything else
and then
first half of s3 was good too
I loved it too
<:ChriGraine:232987926349217792>
it went downhill SO hard SO fast
that show was so bad i had to stop watching
oh man I'm sorry
Like there's NOTHING in the series or writing that would suggest a turn like that. Kaneko said we'd be getting a bitter sweet ending not an insane tragedy and hibiki's B side makes no sense if she killed Miku

I just finished WC
I got it Millhi one sec
||smol bikki alert||
<:Ver:244664866529345537>
this is an important announcement
Nazo for today's episode
```You know it's too late to be yourself anymore,
but you do not run away from yourself, therefore you will not be deceived by anyone.
You thought you would always be together, simply thinking only of your bonds.

You yet stand far from the mountain of corpses. The sentinel, ultimately human, wishes you fortune.
A wind of blood surges past the spot at which you have arrived, carrying with it numerous farewells.```
<:MikuOverjoyed:273395118982299658>
well at the end there
Gen kept Tsubasa from turning into the monster Fudou wanted to turn her into
yeah
<:MariaHappy:236871184807886848>
<:MariaHappy:236871184807886848>
Someone did do a good comparison on twitter, I need to find it, it a lot of the shots from the Maria/Basa fight were inverted shots from their second fight in G

there's 4 songs yet to be unveiled

best was relative to dragonball
and it'd be a better product
you could straight up remove episodes from super
symphogear doesn't have useless episodes
inside the same arc
and some of the worst episodes ever
Super had some of the best episodes/fights ever
<:JiiCry:421446826177331220>
If only dragon ball understood pacing
<:PraiseTikki:398808517139628042>
<:ChriGraine:232987926349217792>
Escalation that would be bad for symphogear would be the reveal of ANOTHER villain who's actually even more powerful than Shem-ha
Escalation is fine as long as there's clear limits and constraints placed upon the power system
<:MariaShocked:273278132184940544>
and to reinforce the idea of humanity coming together
<:thonk:393573712760406018>

I was more talking aloud
Right but they could have elfnein reverse engineer from those to recreate the gears which is more plausible than her ever being able to rebuild them from scratch
When the shem -ha hands grab everyone and drops them on the ground I believe you can see the fragments of the gears lying on the ground around them
No the left over fragments
to potentially re-acquire the gears
in theory the left themselves a backdoor
Probably

Honestly I'm just happy, my absolute favorite show got to go out on its own terms telling the story it wanted too. While I'll miss the characters I'm glad we actually get a conclusion so to speak
<:WhenLifeGetsAtYou:581851494064586782>
I want to say this was even mentioned during G but I don't have the ability to check atm
I'm fairly certain, FIS was operating and underway prior to Bikki's emergence as the gungnir hybrid. So it would make sense for her to be moving to a backup plan prior to bikki appearing
this will be a good season too
Ryoko/Fine smuggled some of the gungnir remnants to FIS during S1
Yes they'll come with the later BD vol releases
<:Maria_Sing:599038163037716490>
like Macross frontier series to Macross Frontier movies were an improvement
Reboots can totally be better
an S1 rebuild movie wouldn't be awful tbh

No he did a bait and switch joke with Momsekai
not summer
you posted spring
That looks like first cour of Summer only shows
Delta probably shares the most overt similarities to Gear
They're good <:MariaHappy:236871184807886848>
I think I sniped mine off Amazon for like 60-70$ which still isn't amazing but I was happy with that
I have the Tsubasa Figma you can do a lot of really different poses with her it's pretty cool
I'd guess Vol 3 for the first one
sadly the Shinais don't begin with this volume
yeet the miku
I don't think we did those, but I'm not sure if they're official or not

I've known a few people that DDLC really got too, it's written to really get into your head and certain people are SUPER susceptible to the way it went about its business
well I mean that's what we have right now
yep and /r9k/ was reinstated about 8-9 years ago if I remember correctly around the same time /pol/ was separated from /int/ both the reinstatement of /r9k/ and the creation of /pol/ are big reasons why internet discourse is the way it is today imo
The containment board on 4chan with /r9k/ just ended up back firing in the worst way possible
yeah, Tim Horton's dropped their supplier I think around  a decade or so back and McDonalds picked them up afterwards. ever since then people have talked about how Tim Horton's coffee went super downhill and McDonalds coffee is actually pretty good now
McDonalds coffee has been way better ever since they picked up the old Tim Horton's supplier years back
its the paradox of tolerance
because there's a lot of money to be made by sending Johnny to go fire that automatic rifle at some people in a country you have no business being in
yeah i don't play GW2 so I don't have any idea of the surrounding circumstances either
I think the issue here is that while ArenaNet was right to release these two employees for their actions and the way they represented the company. The fact that they did it seemingly only in response too the community outrage and in reaction to that outrage that it just emboldens the worst elements of the community to go "Hey it worked to get rid of them, we can do this to anyone we don't like"
I feel like league hasn't even been that bad for a long time
jesus that's awful
yeah the article isn't the best written, it's pretty opinionated, but it at least explains what happens
it seems two employees lost their jobs after arguing with community members

mine is from a french word but I have no french ancestry in my family so that's a weird one to try and figure out

There is some value in picking something generic like Johnson it has the added effect of making your new identity a bit more anonymous so people can't try and look you up easily after the fact

Well
Like I remember when I read r/tumblrinaction and I was *convinced* this was like a "plague" infesting modern society. That SJWs and PC style smackdowns over privilege and using wrong terms were a near daily occurrence and it was merely a matter of time before I or someone I knew was "blasted" for being bad. But like I can't remember one time when actually speaking with anyone that this stuff EVER came up. The moment for me that crystallized what was actually happening was when people were going off on the subreddit over some post and I realized that it was like some 14 year olds blog. Like are we really going to try and pretend this 14 year old is the "voice of the PC movement" and in anyway properly reflects the current main stream discourse or points that they're pushing.
Is it even that loud would be my question?
Has that like ever actually happened?
I'm certainly don't like "paying" taxes, but I like what they bring me. And I certainly perfer having taxes to having the wild west of libertarianism

use us as power supply
go full matrix
We stayed at the Golden Nugget over on Freemont street which was pretty cheap but it's off strip and we stayed there specifically so we could drink and gamble and stuff so idk if that'd work great for you
Ouch
all that booze, gambling and legal weed ran up the tab real fast
yeah all the vices that stole my money are 21 and over <:GarieHee:255583679332483072>
Ah yeah its 21 for both, I know vegas has tried to lower it to 18 a few times but I don't think they've been successful yet
my friend actually won like 2 grand while we were there
We stayed off strip so we ended up having to pay a bit more in ubers and lyfts to get around
1 grand for doing stuff should be pretty good unless you throw that all away gambling <:GarieHee:255583679332483072>
and then getting around Vegas and Food will be a lot more expensive than you think unless you're staying at Mandalay Bay
Yeah I'd say set aside like 60-100$ for picking up art stuff
Ah well at least it all got resolved and you'll get your stuff <:MariaHappy:236871184807886848>
oh an Android 21 print
and one more 🤔
I picked up a Elphelt print, a Baiken one, a Jack-O one
<:TsubasaBlush:273275932469362688> It's super cute
I didn't buy any of her stuff though
and she did the CEOtaku mascot design from a year or two back
I saw her booth at Evo last year
Ohy yeah
👏 have fun at evo its so worth going
Yeah that's really bad on them to have the card go missing in transit
<:DEDEDESS:230494351560540160>
Yeah same I've always liked Beagle and its nice to see him say something like that
<:GarieHee:255583679332483072>
so it's never an issue
Oh yeah I'm just going off what they were saying to me at the time, my car is awful so I can't even get it above 70mph without it shaking and rattling
generally up to 8 mph over won't get you in too much trouble, at least that's what they said to me when i was taking a police training course, that ideally they're looking for people 8 mph over the limit or more
Oh wow

Thats somewhat unrealistic considering there are reasons for someone to die in custody that isn't the gov'ts fault but the idea is the conditions in this camps should in no way contribute or cause any deaths is 100% correct and should be the standard
Well
okay yeah I understand that, this is the precursor to events like that even if we're not there yet
Wait are you saying what's going on currently is worse than what happened in like Auzchwitz
I'd say that if he wasn't an executive producer on the show
Oh yeah I could see a kid not understanding just how like messed up this is, especially one raised in hollywood. It's the adults around this encouraging, signing off, and funding this that are really evil

Yeah I've heard more about the Finland isn't a real country it's actually a sea used by the Japanese and Russians for Whaling conspiracy than this
I heard unsubstantiated rumors that someone was yelling about plagiarism and that the perpetrator was schizophrenic

Well HK is set up as a special autonomous zone for economical purposes similar to Taiwan and Macau. As of 2017 HK was equivalent 2.9% of total CN GDP based on what they made and that number has continued to shrink as regions in Shenzen and Shanghai have grown. However HK is the number 1 zone for foreign investment and business to be conducted in China and where most inroads are made by Western countries. It is also the only way foreigners can invest in the CN stock market through the HK stock market
We can find out what HK made in GDP but the economic situation regarding hong kong is extremely complex
HK contributions are not counted towards the CN economy
We actually don't know
China is hoping to outlast the trade war, the tariffs are having an effect on them certainly but at the same time they are negatively effecting America. However Xi has the luxury of much more time to wait than the US does given the upcoming election

Warcraft is insane in CN
I have no skin in the game more just curious if my guess is on the mark
though I am curious who's over there saying that stuff, I have my guess <:GarieHee:255583679332483072>
Nothing has changed in terms of the style and moderation, take that for what it's worth
I can't speak for Mel, but I personally believe Iran would be unlikely to be jumpy and shoot down the international airliner because that'd be the one way to actually force other countries into the conflict, if there was one. If everything was as it was without the plane explosion the only countries that would likely follow the US into Iran would be Saudi Arabia and Israel but if an international airliner carrying Canadians, Germans, Ukrainians among others was attacked it'd be the one way to force NATO into the fight
my friend went from Rockstar to Paradox funnily enough
that's so funny you mention rockstar
but I think working at Paradox makes it easier since it's a pretty international company

whoo anime
I'm going back over Flugel tonight it got retranslated <:MariaShocked:273278132184940544>
<:work:406858377285861398> <:cheekyUMPs:414084638156521472>
though I imagine that's something that gets expanded in the LN
but they never really go back to it
I'm sad cause in the first few episodes they tease an actual interesting magic system and ideas behind it
Records is almost painfully generic, if you like battle high school harems it gets the job done but that's aboutit
Cavalry is more fun that Records imo
but I could be wrong
personally I think the eventual outcome of this match has been extremely telegraphed
especially after the previous match it's a little bit incongruent with the expected skill levels of the previous opponent compared to the current opponent
Pacing and the way in which the opposing team is succeeding
but if you don't care I will spoil some
I don't want to spoils <:MariaShocked:273278132184940544>
I even think a lot of this current matches issues will be less apparent in the anime
soon I hope I so want these matches animated
and so far it's progressing in exactly that manner
this one, idk I felt like i knew exactly how it was going to play out from the beginning
it was more hype than the Shiratorizawa match for sure
the match before this current one is probably my favorite one of the entire series
less so in the west right now
the current haikyuu match is super popular in JP too
That's all I can remember otherwise it's pretty much entirely divorced from the SAO, doesn't the guy who writes the LNs write a couple other really well respected ones
i think the only reference in GGO to SAO is the initial explaining of the world and a really subtle reference to Kirito and Sinon
Bebop the Movie is really good
The weird harem aspect I could do without especially since he's pretty blunt about being in love with Asuna. It's...odd how everyone else just sort of follows them around offering jealous commentary
I think Alicization is supposed to fix a lot of that stuff
and the initial stakes and mood of UBW just felt very different than Zero. But Zero was so dark and serious I'm not sure you could have kept that up through multiple seasons without it getting shlocky
Well having watched F/S Zero the two issues i had with UBW was the big obvious one of one of the "twists" being pre spoiled essentially
I think I tried to play one of the VNs but I tried to play it right after playing Persona, I hadn't really played any VNs at that point so I was annoyed by like the initial lack of interactivity so I ended up dropping it. Maybe I'll go back and give it another chance
Do you really need to play the VNs to get them
I tried to move to UBW but I just didn't like it as much as Zero
I started with F/S Zero
MuvLuv looked nuts
<:MariaLaugh:507595695843442688>
I remember him from the first UBW episodes
oh it's that guy
maybe I missed some settings that's entirely possible 🤔
I'd have to check the engine again it's been a while since I've tried
Yeah but I'm missing all the VA lines then
VNs annoy me cause I read too fast <:MariaShocked:273278132184940544>
Okay I'll definitely give the series another go, just need to find time to watch it. I love the trappings of fate but there's so much media to consume to get a handle on whats going on
Hahah
Ah okay that makes sense
So each of those routes would cover the same story framework but the plot beats within would change significantly I'm assuming
I could probably return to it now since I'm no longer coming in hot off of Zero
I just really liked the super dark and serious vibe of Zero, not to say UBW or the later seasons couldn't have moved into that but the initial switch in tone was offputting when I tried to watch it
Oh yeah I knew that going in
oh absolutely fantastic
<:GarieHee:255583679332483072>
Paranoia Agent I'd recommend as well
if you haven't 100% recommend Monster I think it would be right up your alley
I'm assuming you've watched Monster Solo
though all I'll say
Haikyuu is really really good
Surprised it's not Keeanu

arifureta is such awful garbage
<:DEDEDESS:230494351560540160>

Otome isekai should be great <:BongoDown:490908344551473172>
i imagine it's pretty easy to just roll out a new one each season
also isekai fans demand very little

Haikyuu season 4 finally <a:HyperBasa:396506752025362432>

Arifureta has been gloriously awful this season
I think so
<:PraiseTikki:398808517139628042>

I'm prolly gonna watch
yeah there's some rather key differences between Delta and Gear which I think could turn some people off but at the same time they do share a lot of ideas and scenarios
like Arifureta
Tio besto
<:lul:497179258326614035>
I think the olympics this coming summer is making scheduling a bit tougher than normal
unlikely
<:ChriGraine:232987926349217792>
I had way too much fun watching it
Yayyyyyyy
<a:BeefStroganoff:393778449862492164>
We're getting mahouka s2
Wait
<:CUHRAYZEEver:232760673740783627>

Yoooooo

one of my favorite LNs is getting an anime
yayyyy
<:maria_happy3:584389762052259856>
Slime is a fluffy isekai
Its so good <:maria_happy3:584389762052259856>
I remember the OP for that show being really goofy
I didn't even realize <a:Yay:580751199461179410>
s3 bandori starts today <:ANIMEJANAI:286324788279115778>
its haikyuu day <a:HYPE:590239328282607626>
s2 was confusing enough for people that hadn't played the mobile game
god I can't imagine jumping into s3 without having watched s2
that show was so much fun <:sereyay:586123449982910474>
Also that basa carrying a present picture is so cute
<:MariaConfident:336657338729627658>
<:MariaConfident:336657338729627658>
finally she takes a dominant role with her sword
<:Ver:244664866529345537>
Maria full bully this episode

<:topcute:582380743016054812>
<:MariaConfident:336657338729627658>
Yes sorry that wasn't clear <:DEDESS:434136208721969182>
I don't want to spend 2/4 Shinais on NR and Shemha they should be combined into one imo
<:MariaConfident:336657338729627658>

cause it's very cute
important leak
Cute vampire
and not enough time
there's so many things out now I want to  play
2 of my friends have been playing they've been really enjoying it
weren't they in street fighter x tekken too?
Sonic chasing something more fun than rings now
which is just amazing
instead upload all the pictures as a ZIP each week so I can download all of them i don't like having to look everywhere
and he was like no stop doing that
I still love that the creator of Nier Autotmata heard people were posting lewd fanart of 2b on the internet
she's who I play in BB
Makoto is really fun
Time loops
hasn't been in any fighting games
Gene from Godhand
I still can't believe
Neps + Platinum
would be fucking hillarious
Kirito interacting with Ragna
tho
no Kirito
pls no
Saitama
ugh probably
*we all answered symphogear*
they had a survey asking what characters and franchises people wanted added in
they could be
I have it on PC and Ps4 <:StrawberryJam:342564989556490240>
4 was better imo
but
I enjoy playing it
like sf5 has so little neutral compared to 4
depends on the game
and dictate which is huge in fighting games
well you get to set tempo/pace
Oh yeah
I'm excited for the crossover game
I wasn't ever super into BB
REALLY hard
Just punch things
Makoto is how I imagine bikki would play
They look similar
bullet is weird
Oh hahaha
44444444444444444
I was hoping it'd just be the robot voice going
I tried to start learning Drauganov but I just didn't enjoy his style
I learned Katarina whom i find really fun even if I know she's not great
who do you play?
Tekken 7 is so good <:MariaHappy:236871184807886848>
*But I want it*
I wish I knew
no idea
<@!263983345669505025>  This was the image I was talking about earlier today
I will post it tonight when I get home if it hasn't been already sadly I'm at work and don't have it saved here
there's another one where bikki is fighting Kirika
yeah
one of the actual game and one of character select
or two actually
that just looks incredible
There's a mockup screen I've seen
me three
I know there's a guy at Arksys trying to get them to do a fighting game
Geah rhythm game, musou game, or a fighting game is the dream I'd take any of them
<:MariaGasm:376533506345402368> GOTY
i'm curious enough to try them out my friend enjoyed the p4 rhythm game a lot
Dancing Star Night and Dancing Moon Night next month or maybe the one after too
p5 was my Goty last year got the plat trophy was an amazing experience
<:PraiseTikki:398808517139628042>
both games are super worth it though
the long wait
though I guess if I hear something good I'd try it
yeah I stayed away
those are some good gaems
I mean even on emp walls and an archer into composite bowman should be able to hold for quite some time
Yeah but you have ~250 turns till tanks
You might be able to bro it up with Montezuma and then use him to come down on the Mongols
are you on the same continent as Aztecs too?
it might be emp or its one up from that
I can't remember which difficulty gives them a free settler
What turn is it?
You can probably still roll mongolia and just take their capital as a 2nd city
What difficulty?
there's defined sections unlike in HZD
yeah plus the world isn't continuous in BB
is Bloodborne open world? 🤔 cause if it is there's 2 open world games I've liked
HZD is like one of the only open world games I really enjoyed they did such a good job with the world design
Just let babylon build and then steal everything from them <:GarieHee:255583679332483072>
ooof is babylon near the mountains tho
get that religion
<:MariaHappy:236871184807886848>
and there's gonna be PQ2
<:StrawberryJam:342564989556490240>
there was no more running outside of tarturus
p3 portable had some cool stuff but it also took away certain things
p4golden on Vita was amazing
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
p3 is....dated in some aspects
with Hifumi restored as a party member
give me P5 crimson
man p5 was so good and now we get the spinoffs <:MariaHappy:236871184807886848>
I can only imagine how many bundled ps4s and HZD2s they could sell
and it works as a system seller
It was one of the biggest ps4 exclusives last year
oh yeah
i hope they make a sequel and add some boss level monsters
I haven't got around to it yet
Have you tried the DLC?
<:FineShocked:299645400468684800>
I think so, they moved away from a match 3 to a management tycoon style game
oh yeah super vanilla
I heard the 2nd game was complete garbage though
I enjoyed it
The first one was pretty fun
Huniepop <:Ver:336656981144109066>
and Capcom monetarily supporting tournament prize pools it'd be dead
If it wasn't for Capcom Cup
technically?
so we can all go back to playing SF4
also can SFV just die
Dolls Alchemists Ver and Genjuuro as DLC
i want to believe <:MariaShocked:273278132184940544>
pls arksys
when are they gonna make a Symphogear fighting game
facts
them's fighting words <:ChrisAngry:336656958272700417>
<:MariaHappy:236871184807886848>
D20 a crit!
<:Thinkki2:383667419366817802>
Hmmmm
I died to that less than Rom the first time <:MariaShocked:273278132184940544>
is fucking Rom
is the boss I've died to by far the most
Whats weird
<:ANIMEJANAI:286324788279115778>
I just took out Darkbeast in NG+ not looking forward to that fight mk 2
<:MariaShocked:273278132184940544>
and I think a few Ritual Blood 4s maybe 5?
I need 20 arcane haze and the two bastards of Loran
I know all the bosses
<:ANIMEJANAI:286324788279115778>
Gonna take out what is, from what I've heard, the hardest fight in the base game <:MariaConfident:278546066087870464>
I get to take on the Bloody Crow this time <:MichaHee:260224421476696064>
My friend gave me a checklist for the main game
-50% hp though <:MariaShocked:273278132184940544>
I just need to scrape the materials together to get in
I'm down to the Defiled Chalice
Not yet
I'm excited <:MichaHee:260224421476696064>
I've heard how crazy hard it is
I didn't have the money to get it before now <:MariaShocked:273278132184940544>
I am going too
cause damn did I have to learn
as a result I know every move and the range of the Hunter's Axe through and through
Granted
it was like a different game
Oh god yeah
instead of having to manually aim all your swings
I found out you could actually target enemies
and then like 3-5 hours in
I struggled so hard at the beginning, I was like wow people really weren't kidding about how hard the souls games are
the combat just feels awesome
Bloodborne was/is incredible so far. I've beat it once, playing through again on NG+ to grab the two bosses I missed the first time and too clear the chalice dungeons. It's my first "souls" game it's been phenomenal
I'm excited I've been playing through Bloodborne, so between the remaster and then picking up 3 I have a bunch of new games to play
apparently the demo was fine at Pax so I wonder what the issue with the switch port was, perhaps Nintendo's online wasn't working well enough for them to launch
I will!
tbh gun damage seems pretty whatever i just use it to parry
awww
I wanted to use the Evelyn(sp?) gun
i think 20 bt and maybe 8 arcane
got 35 vit, 25 end, 30 str, and like 42-43 skill
I did that
whoo
and that gets me the best return per point on damage for that
I've been mostly leveling Skill since I've been using Ludwig's Holy Blade
*looks at his 35 vit nervously*
<:MariaShocked:273278132184940544>
Rakuyo
there's a DLC weapon I want really bad so I'm def getting it
<:MariaShocked:273278132184940544>
only 1 1/2 hours left
Oooh I'll read this when i get home from work today
Oh huh that will be something to adjust to when moving to the other games in the series
Like the brainsuckers shit <:ANGRY:279957716976271360>
you can't spam out of
Oh yeah I just hate how there's a few attacks
and you're not put into a knockdown state
what's worse is if you try and dodge to your right, his left he moves forward with his arm and still hits you, just for way less damage
I beat him last night
fuck that guy <:ChrisAngry:235387246205730816>
that'd be unreal
Oh good god
with the visual aesthetic strength of the main game and some better design put into them
but a chalice dungeon type system
but going through them it's just....eh?
could be a really good concept in its own game
I feel like the Chalice dungeons
<:wow:257239526441746434>
man if only persona 5 scaled with ng+ <:TsubasaExcited:409481619842400257>
reading your article did actually explain why the NG+ felt so hard at first until I happened to start randomly doing chalice dungeons since I hadn't done them really on my first playthrough
<:DEDEDESS:230494351560540160>
it was briefly mentioned <:MariaAgent:278546060849184769>
🤔
how was it
thank you baseball and athleticism you saved me from being a complete weeb in highschool <:PraiseTikki:398808517139628042>  I was able to hide it my whole life
I prefer Skiing to snowboarding
compared to SSX certainly
very
well combined NGE series and EoE
ooof number 1 of all time I think still has to go to EVA for me
I've enjoyed it a ton so far there's a week break now before going into ep 16-24 for the back 1/3rd of the series
and goddamn that ending to ep 15 was amazing
people were really mad after ep 14, but ep 15 derailed the hate train for one of the characters
plus some of the references are amazing
same with SPL which is just silly and fun
and Space patrol luluco
X-Com with giant mechs <:MariaHappy:236871184807886848> <:MariaHappy:236871184807886848> <:MariaHappy:236871184807886848> <:MariaHappy:236871184807886848>
IT LOOKS SO GOOD
where's Ultra Instinct Shaggy
looks like a butt <:KirikaBinocular:409481619431489553>
I mean they need to change something with AD carries they've dominated the meta since like halfway through the season
the 8.10 changes? They look...really weird I don't like the jungle stuff I haven't looked over the Marksmen/Ad Carry changes
<:BikkiHey:276033233500766208>
as i basically only used it to play p4g
I sold my vita a while ago
yeah
I didn't play p4 DAN but I kinda wanna get p5 dancing <a:think:395165318244335616>
is that the P3,4,5 dancing games <:KirikaBinocular:409481619431489553>
I got the take your heart edition when it came out. I use the bag like every day to carry my stuff around
Nice
I only got her sister so far
still waiting on my UMP45 <:MariaShocked:273278132184940544>
IDWWWWWWW
<:cheekyUMPs:414084638156521472>
<:PraiseTikki:398808517139628042>
<:M4A1Spray:414084482283601921>
mines 3024 feel free to use my team to clear <:MariaHappy:236871184807886848>
<a:ablobsweats:412748432944529410>
Oooh battery time
that chalkboard drawing <:MariaHappy:236871184807886848>
Blazblue was so goddamn confusing
is BlazBlue
the only story worse
oh god GG story is nonsense
if I was in Japan <:MariaShocked:273278132184940544>
the GG OSTs are so good they get concerts I'd seriously go to one of them
I love that the dude that does all the character designs for GG also writes and plays all the music
it would be so amazing
please daisuke ishiwatari
get him to do the OST for a Symphogear fighting game
my god the music
and the music
Jam is very cute those china dresses <:MariaGasm:376533506345402368>
🤔
I play Vega in Sf4, Katarina in Tekken 7, Jam in Xrd, laura/kolin in 5, then a Cell/16/21 team in DB Fighterz
<:MariaShocked:273278132184940544>
I wish we could go back to Sf4
Eltnum's theme from Uniel is fucking 🔥
so I kinda wanna try it out
there's been a Uniel theme that i really like
I like to play Jam and I want to learn Elephet especially since she'll get into the crossover with Girls Frontline
only Tekken is worse in that
I play a lot of fighting games and Xrd still makes me feel dumb sometimes
do you play Baiken?
goddamn i can't wait to go
SFV
DB Fighterz
Melee
GG Xrd
Tekken 7
it's not even a Sunday game at Evo this year
We've been trying <:MariaShocked:273278132184940544>
<a:HyperClap:433038052844371968>
<:topnep:389579295896633344>
it was nice
I got 2 of her last night
I want a strong console scene
I'm happy when all 3 are doing well
Really
it's been a sick run
Sony has killed their exclusives over the last year
<:MariaHappy:236871184807886848>
<:WhatTheFuck:337249596386443265>
Work at 745 went to bed at 3 AM
<:BikkiTired:421446825967484939>
that was me today
such a pure relationship <:GarieHee:255583679332483072>
<:TsubasaShocked:234521504031834112>
Add Bikki and Chris in
Hey come on if you were gonna prototype a fighting engine for a Symphogear fighting game wouldn't testing the mechanics in Cross tag first make sense
which is why I wanna see Bikki in Cross Tag <:yummy:235243310086750208>
in
because if you wanted to prototype systems and character types for a new fighting game this vrs game is the perfect arena to do it
so you're left with BlazeBlu or some weird Arksys vs fighter title
Well UNIEL and RWBY are smaller overall franchises and calling it a Persona game isn't something they'd probably do unless it's a full persona game
Those NJPW look so cool <:TsubasaExcited:409481619842400257>
Yooooo
Oh cool
I want to get it
yah that one
there's a cyberpunk VN on Steam I've wanted to try for a while about being a bartender
oh wow a Kar she's so pretty <:TsubasaExcited:409481619842400257> I still need her
ooh I haven't been running her I have my main squad for clearing and I've been leveling up a second one so I could bring rifles for Chap 6 and 0 bosses
Sparkle has been trying to get Kar98 super hard
I have her other doll NTW-20 <:KirikaWink:236697222538985472>
Kar98 so cute <:MariaHappy:236871184807886848>
<:PraiseTikki:398808517139628042>
() predatory early access games
add in
eh i've felt the same way, that's why i got bored of the Fate VN
True but it was still fun <:MariaHappy:236871184807886848>
I want to try Danganropa and the Nonary series
I tried playing the fate VN and I didn't like it, DDLC was fun, I played this really really bad one called Just Desserts that was awful and fun
Persona helped me get into VNs more
I won't
though I think they're going to wait until the current match completes before announcing it
we've finally got enough distance from where the anime dropped off where they could do a 2 cour full season
I think soon though
Not yet <:MariaShocked:273278132184940544>
I'm so excited for the next anime season it's going to be amazing
oh man the manga is so good right now <:MariaHappy:236871184807886848>
and new chapter tomorrow <a:HyperBasa:396506752025362432>
he's a good child
They could :^) I hope to find out more at EVO
yeah the replay value on fighting games is among the highest out there
GG has a zillion versions as well
the persona arena games also suffered from this
but Arksys does stuff like this all the time, release a version at 60$. release three or four $8-10 characters then release a new version at 60$ the next year with those DLC characters included and then add three or four new $8-10 dlc characters rinse repeat
for the Senran characters it looks like
I think Techno said $20
even then it was somewhat better during the 4 era since the additoinal versions were available at a discounted DLC price, SFV's model sucks horrifically
the ultra issues are just because you can't update a console game the same way they can patch their arcade machines in Japan which is a really big part of fighting games there and the development behind them
Well western fans get screwed on fighting games was harder than Japanese fans which is more a cultural issue you can't fix
Yeah your comment is on the money for day one DLC released that wasn't on Disc alice
<:Ver:244664866529345537>
I can't remember which though
There was another game semi recently last 5-10 years that had a similar thing
Sony is worse than Microsfot from what I've heard
if it's on the disc it had to go through the final verification process at microsoft and sony so it has to be done several months before the game releases, where as day one dlc can be worked on for longer up to the release of the game since it only has to be authorized for release by the company as a patch and they can pay extra to get speedier verification from Microsoft/Sony
There is an actual time difference in when the content was done
only GG has been somewhat exempt from this
tbf ArkSys has always sucked really hard with their DLC so it's more a continuation of shit policies rather than something new
it's like crimminally wrong
You cannot do a Marvel vs game without the Xmen
Also the dumb issues with licensing the Xmen characters
Bandai Namco is weird with Tekken
People are starting to revolt, SFVs numbers are dropping rapidly and MVCI was ignored. Capcom isn't doing so hot in the FGC department right now. Arksys had a really big win with DB FighterZ but is tryin to pull some stuff with BBTAG
<:PraiseTikki:398808517139628042>
Its so awesome
hypest shit ever
competetive Catherine
There's some hillarious side tournies at Evo
I'm happy with the lineup for sunday this year I can't wait to watch
Dragonball FighterZ is gonna be way more hype <a:HyperBasa:396506752025362432>
isn't even at EVO
brand new capcom release super hyped
Yeah people wholesale rejected that game
:^)
all smash games are party games it's okay
prize pools for most FGC tourneys are really low compared to big esport titles
at the time just fans mostly
nintendo does do stuff for 4, because it's the game they're actively selling. Whereas they basically do nothing for melee, even though it is bigger because they don't sell anything from it
funnily enough
the smash 4 vs melee thing
This is literally
it's all about the betting tbh
Most don't even play for tourney money outside of capcom cup
yeah and there still is enough legitimate pushback against what is percieved as "Esports"
with Arksys games especially in the west the community is so much smaller they tend to just stick to the newest version of the game cause that will have the most players in the west, and that's all the japense players will play when they come over since they can always just play the new versions in the arcades there
but everyone still plays the older versions pretty regularly
and everyone wants to play the version the pros play
but capcom shuts streams down of 4, and invests all their prize pool money into 5. Why play a 10k SF4 tourney when you can play in a 100k SFV tourney
Oh they would have tried that with SF4 over 5
oh and fighterz on pc
yeah I have SF4 and 5, and one of the blazblues on PC and then GG Xrd, T7 and SF5 on Ps4 i'll play
how good all of the OSTs are
that's the real secret of the fighting game genre
God I love animu fighting games <:MariaHappy:236871184807886848>
Ohhhhh okay nevermind I thought you were saying something else
Is that a catcher in the rye reference?
It's a perfectly evolved MvC2 from a gameplay perspective
its his baby tho
Skullgirls is both amazing and suffers from adhereing to it's visual aesthetic and gameplay/engine choices so strictly to MikeZ's vision
that twitter chain
wow that's actually pretty accurate
FGC is poverty there's no money to spend
Here's looking at you Paradox games
It is interesting seeing how some genres of games have insane DLC stuff and the community just goes with it
yeah they cry on reddit about DLC while snapping up every pack that's released
You are right though Alice, more gaming fans need to rise up and speak out and actually act against pracitices they hate. EA will keep being EA as long as people keep buying their shit every year
Your favorite character is a function <:kappa:279049620212940800>
That is technically correct, the best kind of correct
they gameplay isn't half awful but the graphics and UI are <:grosssss:396191332793712641>
they're so iconic to the franchise
ugh it's like the marvel vs series started with Xmen vs Street fighter you gotta have at least wolverine, magento and storm
I think everyone should buy this new Skyrim for Android the ports gonna be great
they don't even know what game to announce yet they'll just see what people hype up the most and go with that <:Kappa:258649137363419136>
it's 10/10 viral marketing and research by bethesda
DICK PUNCH
YES
that's footsies when you're thinking in 300D
holy shit
Please buy Skyrim my name is Rod Boward
i still can't believe I got so lucky with 1-4n
<:topnep:389579295896633344>
5 is just so comfy especially with all the DLC <:MariaHappy:236871184807886848>
are you playing 6? I haven't played it since it like first released I didn't like a lot of the changes
the ghandi strat
ah
I still need to get and play the dlc <:MariaShocked:273278132184940544>
now collect those draw cards for calibration tickets <:MichaHee:260224421476696064>
grats on finishing
I'm curious to see how well they get the bartending aspect of it down <:GarieHee:255583679332483072>
Yeah I'm looking forward to trying it
Also has anyone played VA-11 Hall-A? I just picked it up on steam
congrats! <:lauraYay:382995471846604809>
I really want to go home so i can keep playing VA-11 HALL-A, I've been listening to the soundtrack at work it's so good <:MariaHappy:236871184807886848>
man I picked up VA-11 HALL-A the other day. I played it for real the first time last night got like 2 1/2-3 hours into the story it's so good so far <:TsubasaExcited:409481619842400257>
<:PraiseTikki:398808517139628042>
Oh boy it's my turn for the IDW or Grizzly game <:BasaExcite:391790924843319298>
Yeah idk I've really clicked with it. I've been playing it like mad and now I have new chapters to clear since they released Chapter 4 Night <:MariaHappy:236871184807886848>
ah yeah that was my issue with XDU i play on my phone and so I had to be active while playing it but there's nothing to do in XDU so it was super boring
I dropped XDU I just couldn't do it anymore
and then onto Machine Guns <:StrawberryJam:342564989556490240>
Now just to craft Welrod
I finally just got my <:homete:410658578014273538> I'm so happy
Go go Grizzly!
to your resources, contracts and cores <:Ver:244664866529345537>
Are you ready to say goodbye
and heavy production starts next week or the week after
🐻
Tokarev is super cute grats on the costume <:TsubasaBlush:273275932469362688>
Who are you pulling for?
Oh boy downloading GG Xrd Rev 2 <:MariaHappy:236871184807886848>
<:GWnanamiRoWow:399930868141129731>
I loved it but man did the ending kinda just happen I could have kept playing for a lot longer
Oh yeah I finished VA-11 Hall-a last night
UNI[EL] ost though is making it tough
Me and a friend are trying to decide what anime fighter to get into probably gonna end up playing GG Xrd Rev 2, though UNI[EL] and BB:CrTag are on the list
Oooh Fighting Ex Layer looks cool
well at least you can rig heavy production a little in your favor
don't do that <:TsubasaShocked:234521504031834112>
I kinda like it because power isn't as tied to a money gacha just pretty costumes
So pretty!
<:TsubasaBlush:273275932469362688>
Grats <:lauraYay:382995471846604809>
Oooh New Vegas is over halfway done downloading <:KirikaBinocular:409481619431489553>
Grats <:MariaHappy:236871184807886848>
but they are a 100% 3* or better
and you can still pull non SGs from heavy prod <:rip:289434959297511424>
what game?
Whoa
+ contracts and cores
for one heavy prod
It's about 17k rsc
for your resources <:MichaHee:260224421476696064>
Yeah Heavy Production is coming
<:GarieHee:255583679332483072>
Kotal Khan was more...regal, I want to say, than angry but he did smash people if needed
the Sparta kick
acutally i found BSB pretty easy first run through sadly I think the boss I died to most was Rom <:MariaShocked:273278132184940544>
<:GarieHee:255583679332483072> I'm watching Forsen blind run bloodborne and BSB is just wrecking him so hard
and it resets with every battle
those are set by the base formation you enter combat with
but moving units in combat does not effect formation buffs
you can move your units around in combat, and actually becomes very important for avoiding attacks endgame
yes
there's a very few select number of untis that break those buff convention
SMGs buff ARs
ARs buff SMGs
RFs buff HGs
HGs buff either RFs or Everyone
Shotguns buff Machine Guns
Machine guns buff Shotfguns
generally
units have buffs they give to one another based on what type they are
talk to Chris when he's around I think he's played both as well
you choose to do
oh okay in this its a separate map type
were night battles random?
Ah okay nvm then
like high rarity I mean
is KC also very tilted towards units having to be high rated to be good?
that's the impression I got from talking to Frog on Valk server
I think this game is a lot less heavy on the mind numbing grind compared to KC
no perma death
sent <:lauraYay:382995471846604809>
is that what it says at My ID?
you can also quick repair and resupply on them
and for every one you control you get an additional move
they allow you to spawn in additional units to help
outside of just your own greed
and no real traps
it takes you through the tutorial through the first set of missions and explains all the new stuff you unlock when you unlock it
no
^
she voices two guns <:MariaHappy:236871184807886848>
but they also have <:ChibiDess:391790922565812225>
and they have a lot of different artists designing guns
there's a lot more international representation in GFL
sorry 3* AR
if you're lucky
it could be a solid 3* RF
HGs are weak until end game, so its easier to wait until you can spam level them once you have resources to
that's recipie gives SMGs ARs and RFs which are very good to start out with
https://en.gfwiki.com/wiki/T-Doll_Production
and you can use dupes to dummy link to increase the number of units present on the battle field from 1 to eventually 5
and you can retire which breaks them down for resources
in this you can enhance which dumps girls into one girl increasing their stats
and EN might not even get that event
those 4 units are story mode units and can't be produced in the factory and have only ever come back in an event once
and gives you a small amount of resources and possibly cores,  the dummy link resource, depending on rarity
no it breaks the unit down
M4A1, M16A1, SOPMODII, ST AR-15
don't ever ever ever retire
Oh just this is really the only massive mistake you can make in this game
dummy links is pretty fair as a system I like it
so the way it works in GFL is dummy links
ascending units and 5*s in this is WAY WAY less obnoxious compared to XDU
XDU requires it
and that general use resource is very common and easy to get after a certain point
however there's also a general use resource to ascend them
both
CD decreases and duration/power increases with skill rank though
nope
There's also additional ways to level them but you won't have unlocked those yet
Nada
no
it works like that here as well
yes right now the highest level needed to run them is 45+
and you don't need to have leveled a gun to use it for dummy linking it can be level 1
yes
no
you'll still need to feed it other guns in the enhancement screen in order to max out its stats
before its maxed dummy linked
however you can also spend cores or a combination of units and cores to dummy link them as well
90 it costs 3
for 70 it costs 2
so for 10 and 30 the dummy links cost 1 of each gun
actually no
up to a max of 5 per unit
each dummy link adds another of that gun to the field in the little unit box
so basically like right now you have 1 of each gun on the field
yes and 90
Armory
yeah but they do a good job of slowly introducing stuff so it at least isn't too overwhelming
did you assign her to another?
I find I can do 1 a day pretty comfortably
yeah two of the guys that lef the Stalker studio left and founded 4A studios the company that made Metro 2033 <:MariaHappy:236871184807886848>
believe let me double check
I believ Metro is the spiritual successor to the Stalker franchise
The undercurrent of realisim makes Stalker feel a bit grittier to me than Fallout. Stalker is a bit more "grounded" compared to t he Fallout universe
the Zone (game map) is as much a character as any human. It feels very alive and can lead to some really desperate and intense moments
the world of stalker and especially the atomosphere is a lot more oppressive than say Fallout, the game world feels very hostile and surviving feels like a goal unto itself. Unfortunately the game is a bit feature light especially without modding. But the atompshere and experience are top notch
Do you like the fallout games but wish they were a bit grittier?
It's a fun but buggy shooter
sorry back
I have
p5 is so amazing <:MariaHappy:236871184807886848>
and usually the crashes are from pretty obvious things
Other than it being a little crashy from time to time it's not bad
Oh i've modded it like mad already
I've been playing NV recently for the first time <:fug:294311099615019008>
<:lauraYay:382995471846604809>
i think there's a comic book series based on that too
<:GWnanamiChiakiYeah:402195682108243968>
👀
she's the oldest t-doll too <:GarieHee:255583679332483072>
<:karlicious:414085222217416705>
<:wow:257239526441746434>
I dumped a ton of contracts into crafting her and I finally got her a week or two back. now she's level 75 and once she's 90 she's going on the main team <:MariaHappy:236871184807886848>
https://imgur.com/o6GfBh1
look how cute she is ahhhh <:MariaHappy:236871184807886848>
all she wants is praise
she is def not a tsun gun
g41 is <:homete:410658578014273538>
I hope NA gets the event crossover guns too
and Nana
Need to get Yoko to voice a T-Doll now
maybe we'll get an anime <:MichaHee:260224421476696064>
well the pre registration for Japan is shattering expectations
so many cores
gotta x5 9 different guns <:rip:289434959297511424>
I'm about to suffer through true core hell <:GWupuChitogeCry:390299759639789570>
<:BikkiSad:391790930967134208>
and Kar98 is one amazing adjutant <:yummy:235243310086750208> <:karlicious:414085222217416705>
NTW is a strong endgame gun too
<:MariaHappy:236871184807886848>
45 just says I look Dopey
<:KirikaBinocular:409481619431489553>
>< It's just what the game calls it
jesus it's shit right now :\
i'm not sure what other ones exist
i'm not sure what other ones exist
416, Lee Enfield, and I know Thompson get ones
Certain T-Doll outfits have that property as well
So you know how Kalina in the store bounces all around and moves?
So you know how Kalina in the store bounces all around and moves?
yeah like the 416 costume or the Lee enfield wedding dress one
so you'd have to wale REALLY hard to get the outfit
like 600+ tickets
are stupid expensive
though the live 2d ones
Yes
<:ANIMEJANAI:286324788279115778> I had a squad not doing logistics by accident
I like the outfit gachas cause they're pretty targeted and progress isn't locked behind a paywall
🐻
yeah I'm gonna get there early for the finals on sunday and just camp there all day so I can watch everything
Got my tickets for Evo too <:MariaConfident:336657338729627658>
I did just pick up Guilty Gear Xrd Rev 2 <:MariaHappy:236871184807886848>
I have Chronophantasm Extend on PC but I've barely touched it
I hear Mario vs Rabbids is actually a fun Xcom type game but is that a switch game 🤔
<:PraiseTikki:398808517139628042>
things felt a lot easier after 3-6 for a while, for me at least
3-6 is a big hurdle
but it is night missions so just a heads up
<:cheekyUMPs:414084638156521472>
<:PraiseTikki:398808517139628042>
this event shouldn't be too bad from a CE strength standpoint thankfully, I think people were saying a 4x (level 70 ) should be good enough to clear everything. It fits in between chap 5 and 6
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
even though I really want some of them
which with those idk if we'll ever get them sadly
and potentially cross over event dolls
I think the only other things not in NA are dolls yet to be released
6p62 and Ash-12.7 are the only two I can think off of the top of my head you might not be able to get again
Ash-12.7 was last months, and 6P62 was the first months and 21D this months are the exclusive daily log in dolls I am unsure if these return in anyway
or was that a different gone 🤔
She was the login reward the first month right?
they have a time limited rate up this week for crafting as well
the sleepo beepo herself G11 and the MG PKP
Yes so Operation Cube does launch tomorrow as well as 2 new T-Dolls
we'll probably get a wedding rerun at a discount afterwards
I think the swim gacha goes live tomorrow
but even that could be wrong
Yes the gachas will cycle back through, I think it's just the store bought outfits and event drops that don't return
Sten MKII had a wedding costume given away during her event, I don't think that will be available during the rerun gacha
5-7 was exclusive to her event, but I'm like 95% sure she's a stage drop during cube so she'll be acquirable again.
There's a few dolls that have been given away as part of the monthly drops that I'm not sure how to get
but I could be wrong let me check
I thought I was reading it was opening up tomorrow
and 5-7 returns as a stage drop in Operation Cube so if you missed her you'll have a second chance here to collect her <:MariaHappy:236871184807886848>
This event task list is a lot more manageable than the 5-7 event task list there were some really annoying ones in that one
Operation cube which opens tomorrow will be the first event to add new maps in
there was the first 5-7 event that was like this one, we then had the Bingo event for the Sten wedding costume, and now we've had this task list event again
<:cheekyUMPs:414084638156521472>
45 cutest
Oh hey Alice that unique drop gun, 6P62, from the monthly event is available as a limited drop in Operation Cube. So you can farm her here to get her <:MariaHappy:236871184807886848>
<:cheekyUMPs:414084638156521472>
👆
🤔
It'd work so well
God you could write such a trashy angsty BB Geah crossover with Tsubasa as a hunter and Maria as lady maria <:Ver:244664866529345537>
but Saint hates that pic cause someone colored it <:Ver:244664866529345537>
Lol that was my last one
hell look at my avatar <:MariaHappy:236871184807886848>
I've only heard amazing things about The Old Hunters
oh yeah I need to pick up the DLC for HZD and Bloodborne <:MariaShocked:273278132184940544>
I was going for a plat in Horizon Zero Dawn but I just got bored
I think I just need to finish collecting weapons and the chalice dungeons
Though I'm getting pretty close to Bloodborne
p5 has been the only game I've plat'd
I got the plat trophy after 4 or 5 playthroughs it was totally worth <:MariaHappy:236871184807886848>
Doesn't the Ps4 have a native streaming function? Oh but then you wouldn't have all the PC set up tools then right?
Mass Effect 2 was probably my favorite single player game until persona 5 came along
so I'm probably more forgiving than most
I really like Bioware games so I'm super biased in that respect
I enjoyed it, it was what I was expecting from a Bioware title. It definitely didn't reach the heights of any of the main line mass effect games but it wasn't like this abomination of a game. BUT
Andromeda really wasn't as bad as people made it out to be <:BikkiSad:391790930967134208>
I haven't tried for PKP yet
took me about 20 crafts roughly
I used 97/404/404/97 for G11
I didn't get as far as I would have liked too yesterday only had time to finish the first 3 stages
<:lauraYay:382995471846604809>
<:cheekyUMPs:414084638156521472>
45 best gunfu
<:lauraYay:382995471846604809>
I retired like 3 416's the other day cause I'm not planning on leveling her soon
I pretty much retire anything I'm not actively planning to build
you get 1 core for a 3*, 3 cores for a 4* and 5 cores for a 5*
yeah you can scrap 3*, 4*, and 5*s for cores
I hate them less than most but anything to make them less predatory is great in my book
yeah CSGO just pulled their loot boxes from those markets
<:GarieHee:255583679332483072>
I think the thing that made me the saddest was realizing that I had messed up on my all requests achievement in like october
I think finsihing the conpendium was my last one
oh wow
what was the achieve that pushed you over?
congrats! <:lauraYay:382995471846604809>
<:MariaShocked:273278132184940544>
and knowing I was gonna have to do an another entire playthrough to finish
so 4 main ones
Goku Goku Blue Goku ss3 Vegito
<:lauraYay:382995471846604809>
going there to go 0-2 in Guilty Gear <:MariaConfident:336657338729627658>
I'm so excited for it next week
<:MariaShocked:273278132184940544>
are you going to Evo
Sketch <:TsubasaExcited:409481619842400257>
<:ChrisEmbarassed:336656400472080386>
Only Gourmet King from 3 comes close
he's my least favorite confidant/social link in the series probably
yeah fuck Yosuke
Actually the boys of the P5 party are great, I think that's why i liked p5 so much. There wasn't a member of the group that I actively disliked like in 3 and 4
<:TsubasaShocked:234521504031834112>
was 👌
the anime personality they gave him
<:Ver:244664866529345537>
Door-kun?
it makes me kinda sad some stuff is better than the original for her but then other sections seem so strange due to the switch
FeMC is all over the place in P3P
aye
When's the first flu day I thought it wasn't till like fallish
Reaper?
Yeah there's a few high level persona that could probably solo that fight pretty eays
I think you can get access to it around May
that fight was SO much fun
Optional boss is best boss though
And that tool is amazing saves so much time when hunting for personas
Ragnda or rangda carried me for so long once I could fuse it
Kaneshiro's the bank
Freed from the handholding of the first two palaces <:lauraYay:382995471846604809>
<:lauraYay:382995471846604809>
Not raising your social stats on your first playthrough <:MariaShock:423196877354303498>
and palaces generally only take the minimum number of days to pass as well since you're a lot more familiar with them
<:MariaHappy:236871184807886848>
no social stat raising
you have so much time to do whatever you want
the second playthrough is so much more fun
Ragnda for me I'd say I leveled him manually from like 51 - 63 or something like that
<:GarieHee:255583679332483072>
I want to go home and retake Lordaeron <a:HyperBasa:396506752025362432>
that was fantastic
Especially elegy
those two stories they released yesterday were really good
WE WILL RETAKE LORDAERON
🤔
I think those are the only ones
Magician, Arcana(igors)
Empress, Sun
in 5? 🤔
so don't worry about missing answers or anything
and hers auto ranks up each visit <:MariaHappy:236871184807886848>
It's super fun <:MariaHappy:236871184807886848>
TIME TO HUNT THEM MONSTERS <:MariaHappy:236871184807886848>
Elegy was pretty heartbreaking <:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
the full prequel novel
if you haven't
Before the Storm was a good read too
one of the best things they've released in a long time
Elegy was fantastic
*want to do it again* <:MichaHee:260224421476696064>
that's why i love the insect glaive, it's like oh you just mounted the monster and knocked it down.
I might try the switchaxe or the big switchsword for those bloodborne memories <:MariaHappy:236871184807886848>
Doot Doot
<:MariaShocked:273278132184940544>
sometimes it's annoying cause you want or don't want certain bugs to come through depending on the monster. the spinny stuff is really good against some. and really bad against others
so I can finish out his weapons
I need to do some more Nergigante hunts
my bug army will rule the world <:MichaHee:260224421476696064>
Ah i've played with Insect Glaive the whole time
the pukei pukei armor is super cute too <:MariaHappy:236871184807886848>
most of the time it's just graphics, roster updates tho
Sometimes there's a big gameplay jump, like when they introduced hit stick and or the new tackling system
and Girls Frontline
I got distracted by XDU
No I haven't logged into HI recently <:MariaShocked:273278132184940544>
OhhH
not really
in MH?
<:BikkiSad:391790930967134208>
my ps4 shut off last night in the middle of my B-52 hunt
Go get him <:Germain:421434126856486912>
