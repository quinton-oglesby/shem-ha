(Does need to be edited I suppose)
I have this one on hand https://i.redd.it/t7i5jhw58mj31.png
OH
Joke's on you, most of use can't :MikuBear: anyway
Can we get "Just bleach me" role that turns you back to white?
It's when you have gear stick in car
Fascinating, I need to read Kirichans manual
You know, it would be nice for one of the bots to have polling functionality
Christmas are saved
<:TsubasaSmug:585839805737467920>
As seen on my example
After editing name that is
You can add a role and then remove it
Really?
I think though the hair and the hair decoration thingamabobs make image too noisy
"Stop messing around and pass me the fucking ketchup already"
I, for one, am glad to have my emoji slots freed
Well, you?
<:ElfneinDrowning:336656417035517952>
·¥∞·∂¶·µà  ∏·µí·µò ·µÉÀ°À¢·µí ‚Åø·µí·µó  ≥·µâ·µÉÀ°·∂¶·∂ª·µâ ·µó ∞·µâ ·µâ·µñ·∂¶À¢·µí·µà·µâÀ¢ ·µÉ ≥·µâ  ≥·µâÀ°·µâ·µÉÀ¢·µâ·µà ·µà·µÉ·∂¶À° ∏ÀÄ
One could also catch up to the current YT backlog, come here to discuss spoiler free and get smacked with ever present XV spoilers, on the other hand
Ah, and I have noted, CGDCT
wait, no
Yes!
Well it's none of your business <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
doing, err
I am busy with uh
I don't have the time to look though all 10 of these 5 minute shorts
Well, duh
Think it's pleasing although, where does it come from? I couldn't find source
I cleaned up <:ShirabeCheer:661042424570708037> a little bit before New Year arrives
An emote for Serena <:ShiraBean:661294258795446326>
(Plus most of what I removed wasn't actually background)
I have to say that your Power Point does better job at it than any program I have and am able to use
In Paint.net
I literally took your final pic and manually removed pieces with eraser
<:ShirabeEmbarassed:336657288477671436>
Now 100% less visual noise and 100% more cute lil bean
<:ShiraBean:661294258795446326>
I cleaned our favorite bean a little bit, take 2
<:ChrisHappy:660870796696223744>
You are too good to do that to me
<:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
Neither I nor you can use animated emotes so that's a win-win
Sorry comrades, our slots
Discord supports images up to 128x128, and even then it displays them in 48x48 top
Bubble won't even be visible
<:KirikaSalute:620069889838809089>
<:ShirabeEmbarassed:336657288477671436>
·µÄ ∞·µâÀ¢·µâ ·µÉ ≥·µâ À¢ ∞·∂¶ ≥·µÉ·µá·µâ ·µâ·µê·µí·µó·µâÀ¢
But also
I try to be considerate and not push too many emotes for that reason
Well, this looks good enough for now
But at the same time between downloading full quality EPs, learning how to actually properly rip shots and just finishing it up in graphic program...
It's actually just made on a screenshot and I am not pleased with it at all
Indeed
Enjoy

And I also did these two
Added transparency to what BlackRaiden posted (in case it is allowed to use here)
I cleaned up <:ShirabeCheer:661042424570708037>, based on version posted by <@!122219992358846468>
[Cracks knuckles]
Oooh! Oh! Speaking of
Unless you already found the source yourself <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
It does, but I want to be sure
<@!468591607332208641> Where did you get a picture from here: https://discordapp.com/channels/336297387863703552/336299268107403274/663921480404566027
As in, is it legal to use for us?
<:ShirabeCheer:661042424570708037>
Help won't arrive Dud
<:ShirabeCheer:661042424570708037>
We always will need more Shirabe
Just for peace of mind
Can you add a clause that <#336310266654490624> is for all symphogear seasons?
<:ShirabeCheer:671887003414954005>
No worries
It *is* already bigger than discord needs
<:TsubasaYareYare:407397617451139073>
<:ShirabeCheer:661042424570708037>
<:ShirabeCheer:661042424570708037> still has that unappealing row of pixel at the bottom
It isn't really a rule, it's a common courtesy
We don't have spoiler rules
Speaking of matter, this pic is too big file size wise
It's commendable, but at the end really doesn't matter
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
What are those people talking about, these are all same picture
And so does <#336297840529899522> to an extent
<#407060923078017026> also exists to offload general a little
I think we can work with what we have still
<:ShirabeCheer:661042424570708037>
Cropping on the other hand...
Or you can just have a private server to check it yourself <:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
But it helps knowing how it'll look like
You don't have necessarily have to downsize since discord does it on it's own
Oh, that's very good
Dew it
If you can find any
But also, we could use some chuckle emotes
There's never enough
Although I think I've already shaken over your stores
You can always look for more DMJii, I won't be complaining
Toast, in case you still want it
Newest Maria emote, w/o background
From "Let's raise a toast" to "I'm gonna break this glass on your stupid face"; anyway
There's hilarious discrepancy between expression she has on full image and expression she has in emoji
Lol dude
Drop whole scene, maybe somebody can figure how to patch it up
Bit more touched up
Removing background? I don't think anyone had done that before
<:ShirabeStare:582381430915596289>
Raiden, I know you have more of these ShiriKiri emojis
<:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
Too slow
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
I forgot how 12 is in German
Ah fuck
I'd say 2
Well <:ChrisBored2:672575548156936212> <:ChrisBored:672575526346424351>
Oh me oh my
What's the full picture?
<:MariaChuckle:672465496515411984>
There's plenty of space
<@!237964037898502144> Do you have original?
Though it could be cropped
That's a good Kanade
Maybe animated emote?
How do you take such high quality screenshots? <:KirikaShout:607741871703457812>
After you've been trying to hold out on saying "Watch Symphogear" for 15 minutes and somebody asks you for anime recommendations
<:MariaChuckle:672465496515411984>
Isn't there tabletops role already?
What's that noise? It's a bird? It's a plane?
En garde bitch

:SadNoiseNoise:
Bonus:
<:ShiraBean:661294258795446326>
...For couple more Shirabes
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
Oh and by the way
That's why you make spreadsheets
Your calculus is wack <@!468591607332208641> <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
There is 145 emotes
That doesn't add up
With the supply for gif emotes we can throw in basically whatever
~~That's because nobody cares about gifs~~
Everyone: Hmm, I think we could use some more [insert favorite gear] here
It's what Serena would've wanted

<:TsubasaSmug:585839805737467920>
We can replace <:KirikaChant:663568587310628892> with it if you are worried about slots
Can we get sad pre-hug Kiri emote as per this post: https://discordapp.com/channels/336297387863703552/336299268107403274/672232258568060966 ?
Don't even think about it whiskey <:TonyEyeRoll:580561912513691679>

Yeah, I figure there is no reason to worry for indeterminate future
In any case, I have all current emotes saved in a spreadsheet and... actually discord keeps already sent emotes up even after they've been removed, so that's convenient
Oh, that would make it perfectly not enough <:HibikiTired:422925410490253313>
He gave like 5 boosts and we would be short 2 if they were to disappear
<:TonyEyeRoll:580561912513691679>
But you know there is at least one person out there who is waiting with that one boost just so they can be the person who brings it to 30
Technically true
2 Will be enough
mfw it's been 33 days since last emote was added
Can we make a channel in which we can only speak in math formulas just to see what kind of math equations <@!449062815534153748> brings into existence?
But I'll have to bite the bullet I guess
Well, actually there absolutely is hurry
There is no hurry
<a:MikuQuake:605209236082786355>
More DMJii emotes
<@!468591607332208641> I need you help
Ikr?
<:ShirabeIsFuckingDone:686614802625462275>
I also have this one, again
<:Teapot:688191751739015359><:NoiseSitting:673209979011989556>
I'm keeping the teapot though
You have version with teapot? <:FujitakaScared:672430483702939659>
Can the noise man finally get more representation?

And here are full sizes
They are gonna be greatly displeased if you won't add them
<:ShirabeResent:684370879177949193> <:KirikaResent:684370061837729811>
That's great, because I have two
So you don't deny...
Congratulations

<:TikiPraise:672430544381935625>
<:ElfneinTrip:688025973932687377>
I would like to request applying this tiny fix to emote
Hello
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Because it will annoy people
I took your's and edited out hand
I'll still one up you though
<:KirikaMad:688188152891834417>
Ah you
It was literally 4 clicks

Except
So that <:Zababies:672238628398956594> can be first on list
<:NoiseTea:688192213762572295>
Unfortunately that ship has already sailed
<:ShirabeCry:671887081026617345>
And that's dumb I don't want it
If you have nitro discord mixes animated and regular emotes
Getting mods to remove <:KirikaChant:663568587310628892> is a point on my bucket list ngl
They can't be used w/o nitro tho
~~That's why I'm going though DMJii emotes~~
<:ShirabeDone:688198954810474559>
Eh, I'm just to lazy
~~I hope she pings everyone with <:HibikiPing:688397678421344268> ~~
Also, can you add emotes?
You will hold back because nobody has time to go though all emotes <:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
<:ShirabeMad:688188118087499792>
All in all it creates an illusion that I don't do anything
Plus reposting the pics is kind of silly since mods need to download them anyway
But I'm too lazy to that
't suck or need additional cropping
Someone should set them as emotes to see if they don
And like half of these are already emote ready
<:KirikaPanic:644235681677180958>

I thought there was a gif of upset Kirika angrily waving her hands
Am I going crazy?
Err
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025> portrays the exact emotion you go though when you see it not with other basa motes
No

I am being facetious, obviously, keep the bike
Yea, sure, keep the padorus, yeet the bike
Feng Shui be damned
It does look like pencil line that had been intercepted by eraser
You gotta be more specific about offness of her mouth
Nope, still on
Lemme check on mobile
It looks pretty on to me
(Also if somebody has better original source I would ask to provide screens, because this is a bit of a potato quality)

I got rid of these pesky pixels
You can yeet all padorus and add Kanade so she's last padoru standing
Someone got left behind when they were reinstated <:KirikaSad2:666052894935613443>

Melua is murdurerize me for this one
<:ShirabeDone:688198954810474559>
Sounds like you have a slot free for that extraordinarily sad Shirabe emote I suggested last week
Now we have even more Padoru <:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
Whiskey, your brilliant plan backfired!
>And not removed regular Padorus
Now we can banish padorus to animated emote slot <:Ver:336656981144109066>
FASTER
Because what does any mean anyway? Does that mean he/she/they are all fair game? Does that mean that people get a pass to call you fuckface?
Like I mean, if it's added, then by all means, but I think it's just too redundant to bother at all
Whisk gets it
Just slap all of them then tbh
You are welcome
(But if you find DMJii emote material, my door is always open)
And thus you are being discarded
I don't need you anymore
Also, you are fired <:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
You are welcome
I used to keep spreadsheet with emotes but nitro messed up my mojo
StillNotEnough% of DMJii emotes out of total
According to my quick calculations our server has
Hmm
Seems like it didn't come back on
And also while topic is still fresh, markov stopped working again, since 2nd May
<:ElfneinSmug:688236836891656246>
Even Melua said she wouldn't allow it
Okay, now I know it's probably a bit of uh topic, but what's gonna be of the bots from june onward?
Segregation for separate best girl channels is probably not the best idea
Plus, if someone didn't bother to add any role at all, what makes you think they'd be bothered to add an "any" role?
I mean like, all of that is not even relevant if you just choose roles you want
Say if another pronoun role was added, does that mean that people who have an "any" role have to update all their roles now if they do not wish to associate with the new role?
<:ShirabeEmbarassed:336657288477671436>
Color Me Kirika's Stripped socks when? <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
We need like, lime, not darker green
No, but their roles are somewhat close to their respective hair colors, within acceptable margins of color overlaps and light mode friendliness
And I'm gonna take a guess and say that when that role was added, color role distribution took priority over accuracy
Pink is *somewhat* close to her eye color
For characters, we have like 3 vacant slots with NR
Now, to the color role, <@!99695384296701952> what would be requirements for that, and would that be even possible?
No, your declarations will not stop me from taking any sign of disfavor towards my favorite gears as personal attack
<:ShirabeSob:701475635025019000>
<:ShirabeMad:688188118087499792>
If you want pink, may I suggest just using Shirabe role? <:ShiraBean:661294258795446326>
Won't work on light mode
And what color would it have? <:TonyEyeRoll:580561912513691679>

Hello <#336299268107403274>! Did you miss me? <:ElfneinWeld:586027421296492585>
Mhm, it would be handy sometimes, but we can certainly do without
Hence stemming from that, general NSFW channel
I wasn't interested in learing the secrets of BDSM or anything <:TsubasaUpset:672861878703357968>
Well, pff, If you want feedback on NSFW fancontent, there isn't a great place to ask really
That's understandable
It occurred to me recently that if you want to have any NSFW discussion, it will imminently get buried under pictures, and sometimes this might not be what you want. That plus these kinds of discussions might seem somewhat out of place anyway
It is, I know
How about NSFW channel specifically *not* for pictures?
I mean it certainly won't if it literally can't be done at all <:KirikaMad:688188152891834417>
<@!457268466429329429> Can you even do that?
I mean, discussion channels are for that
What kind of?
But mobile discord should have the checkbox for it?
Or alternatively change filename so that it has `SPOILER_` in front
When you upload, you click mark as spoiler
There will be no mercy, Emily

> we only have 5 emote slots left
I just added transparency to two frames out of Specials
Weep is also an option
Only ShirabeSob is
That might scatter them bit too much though

I have mastered the art of making animated emotes
It is over
Guys it's over

I have an eye for adorable
Joke name aside, "please" would probably fit better than "wow" IMO
<:ElfneinPalm:672430572961923092>
Although it seems like it just won't work as an emote anyway
I'd love to see it
<:MikuDelete:661660028410920990>
I think it'll be a bitch to edit
Not yet <:KirikaWink:689564310908960900>

And I just <:KirikaPlease:730107672455544873>
But then I look at my beautiful creation and she is like
"Is it even moral to suggest yet another Kirika emote when there are so many Kirika emotes already and only so few slots?"
Sometimes when I finish a new emote I wonder
You know
No wait dang, we don't have enough emote space for shoe emote
Can you post a whole screen?
<:CarolYandere:424047704826707980>
Yup

Mel, I just want to point out that new bean is exactly the same as the old one that is on the server, only with some hair bits added to extend size
<:TsubasaNeutral:688429723205894149>

<:KirikaBullying:726216183069802586>
Ah fuck, you gonna decide on emotes while I'm sleeping?
That ccould be a good alternative
Or for desperate people, if you will
It's meant less for specific games and more for variety
I'm just saying, it might make these announcements more effective
Role for server <#337805317276565525> related sessions?
The fact that you concluded that I explained that you mentioned that I said that you think you planned it only proved that my plan worked equisitely
The fact that you mention that I said that you think you planned it only proved that my plan worked flawlessly
The fact that you think you planned only proves that my plan worked completely

This is a high competition field!
Unfortunately I need to be tactical about my emote choices <:ShirabeCheer:671887003414954005>
You'd have to crop it because it's gonna look bleh uncropped
God I want to make emotes so bad, but there is just no good enough material here
I prefer A tho <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
AKA does the toy stay on or not
Option B
Option A
First off, make up your mind on whther you want top or bottom

\*Chefs Kiss\*
Or maybe not?
And yea, I'd agree to reserve a slot for bayo-
You're gonna need to phrase it differently because the room is literally *for* both
<a:ShirabeSob:725756411312734228><a:KirikaSob:725756440463147048>
Oh shit <@!99695384296701952> they are onto us
Now *these* could be jammed into animated slots
There are none on this server <:ChrisOi:586551700987576330>
There is no quad emote tho
In my defence, I only asked for 1 of these
And it has more uses than all three pixel emotes combined
I mean, <:KirikaChant:663568587310628892> is the emote that's brought up virtually only when topic of removing emotes arises
Nothing to see here
Which kinda sucks to say since mods asked artist for permission to use them
I think pixel emotes are, bar none, the most expendable
You know, to be blunt
Animated emotes have separate slots but these cannot be used by non nitro users
<a:MikuQuake:605209236082786355>
Classic <:KirikaChant:663568587310628892>
And it's not even smug, ironically enough
<:ElfneinSmug:688236836891656246>

I'd say <:Euphoria:688429724032172116> is up there also
~~This is at least 2 potential DMJii emotes <a:KirikaUpset:688429724221046872>~~

Does Hibiki really need 3 emotes of eating rice?
Wait wtf
Okay, <:TsubasaAngry:692141154531016765> May not be the best reaction here
I shall not let <:Bike:690470896892379136> be destroyed <:TsubasaAngry:692141154531016765>
It'd be just a dry judgement on why an emote should be removed
It's more a joke suggestion
Which emotes are in highest danger of being shafted
We should make emote threat rating spreadsheet tbh
Lmao
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
That's the point, make the same thing, but require people to pay nitro for it
You'd still image it
But it could be shafted into animated slot, it would be very fitting <:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
I disagree about <:SongStone:688213224012644370> actually
Limit should increase by 50 every X boosts over lvl 3, you can't change my mind
Honestly, hard no from me, in general
Oh yeah raiden, these two are a crime

<:ShiraBean:736607747834904667> is a good emote

I didn't mention Tsubasa to pick her emotes off, I mentioned her specifically because she has hardest one to argue for
Then 3rd get's chopped <:MikuDelete:661660028410920990>
Her emotes are straight up untouchable
Tsubasa doesn't get enough cred
But even then, it's only because it's some artist's original creation
I mean, I kinda agree that pixels shouldn't be cut first
Pixel emotes are just that, pixel emotes, nothing else
These don't represent *anything*
But the thing is
To make space for better emotes for these characters
I'd still cut them
Yeah, this tbh
I understand, I read it, but I wanted to put forth my input since I missed it
Since people would just move to other emotes, and Ver is more... predictable
rip
I was just today like "Hmmm I'm looking for this very specific emote but there isn't any like tha- waaait!"
Sigh is more usable
We all need to make sacrifices Lily <:MikuDelete:661660028410920990>
<:MikuSnap:688429722249855020>
Y'all been eager to remove miku emotes, here's one wildly removable
<:SerenaDizzy:736605371912945736>
From <:Ver:704169051391524875> scene
GX
X
It's from G
I think it encompasses the same message as the other one and more, but it's just that it's worse quality
I'd also think <:CarolShock:730816714345938956> could replace <:CarolTheFuck:617036187319795722> if it had higher quality
<a:TsubasaBroken:663625017191432192>
I use it as synonymous of screw over, which applies to both <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
So that at least nitro users can use it, as opposed to, you know, *nobody*
All I'm saying though is that if a legacy emote were to be removed, it's be a better alternative to shaft it
Yeah exactly!
Sorry man, I don't make the rules <a:MikuHyperDelete:729379613180166184>
You don't get to keep nice stuff
Wait you mean you removed 3 Kirika emotes but left all 3 Hibikis eating rice? <a:KirikaUpset:688429724221046872>
Maybe if could be shafted to animated slots without much harm
We *do* have animated coin emote tho
<:KirikaApproval:586957465552158720> is good tho
<:MikuPanic:640289659452129310>
And also her face when you suggest to remove it
<:MikuPanic:640289659452129310> is <@!106866895076003840>'s second favorite emote
<:KirikaMad:688188152891834417>
Okay now that 3 good emotes were removed I am feeling vengeful
<:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
It's used all the time tho
And I *never used it again*
Last time I was one to advocate against removing it

Speaking of redundant Hibiki emotes
Yeah

Noo don't <:MariaBully:689614085452464318> <:MariaBully:689614085452464318>

Outside of christmas season, the sole reason why padoru is used is to be fucking obnoxious
I will die on this hill if you want to discuss it
¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
And honestly, feel free to ignore my opinion, I think padorus are obnoxious and you **should** pay for nitro if you want to spam it
On the other hand, it's wasted slot most of the year
Hisss
Don't post this cursed emote
Have I mentioned padoru? Yeet the padoru

No
Just yeet all Kanade emotes
Oh right, Kanade was rude to Megan
I think Kanade emotes could be suitable for replacement, but not so much for deletion
Deleting emotes is always a hot topic <:KirikaGlint:689561325654900810>
Mel's inbox is going to be screwed tho
Hey, I lost 3 emotes today, and I'm not crying publicly
~~Okay but promise me you'll delete it for next April Fools~~
That would be **HILARIOUS**
But Lily
<:MikuDelete:661660028410920990> <:MikuDelete:661660028410920990>

I think changing its name might change its situation a bit
<:BikkiFu:688190074738704394> is sparsely used and kinda meh, but
And that's all that there is to it
But anything more would be splitting hairs at this point
I'm not like against removing Miku emotes in the sense that it gives me a lot more room to work with <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Nope
<:ChrisEmbarrassed:663558614610608128> is up for replacement, not deletion I'd say
But Chris has a legit selection
(Okay, maybe I shouldn't be the one to say that)
Screw people feelings
Chris is also a though cookie
Fr, <:ShirabePout:336656831978012712> is better than it has any right to
Don't even think about it <:ShirabeFear:696380146248319066>
<:ElfneinWeld:586027421296492585>
Emote servers exist so that you can use emotes on that server on other servers. With nitro
Yes
Also get nitro <a:KiricoinSpin:664652551580418068>
We are serious server
No
It is not an emote <:MikuDelete:661660028410920990>

!TwinHeart
<@!481518367845646346> The same as 4 part but 6 part
Take notes Lily
I made 6 part emote at some point
I wonder what takes all the slots <:ShirabeThink:704340938994090005>
<:TwinHeart1:735876565593751603><:TwinHeart2:735876578952609793>

Hmmm
But I don't have space on my private server <:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
<:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
The real tragedy is that after spending like 2 hours discussing removing emotes, we'll have to do it all over again next time
Not enough DMJii emotes/250
<:MikuDelete:661660028410920990>
It's just that adding them is effort <:ChrisBored:672575526346424351>
We just needed to cut most unnecessary and unpopular emotes, there is no need for emoticide anymore
Guys chill the fuck out
What, blep?
9_iam Color me Akira
That's honestly not that cursed tbh
:15min:
Fucking lmao actually please add that
And it's intolerable when not put between these <:KirikaDisgust:688431636043268097>
Because the mix between these is actually the color of strach rich vomit
Basically a bot would have build in tool to periodically cycle colors in some way
<:KirikaSad2:666052894935613443>
No actually now that I think about it, changing role priority wouldn't work at all
It could be arranged with just the roles we already have
If discord bots have ability to reorder priority list for roles
But also
<:MeluaPlease:724028980143063080>
Okay, now everybody knows that I came here to beg for multicolor DMJii role

Good luck telling someone to fuck off in middle of vent
It could've happen anywhere
Vent channel wouldn't solve anything, again, because venting stemmed directly from discussion
Plus if if it does stem from what happened in serious an hour ago
Such is discord, it can't be worked around
If you outsource venting to another channel, you will still have issue of collisions when you want to use channel that's already used by someone else
But they shouldn't be *encouraged*
It isn't that vents should be prohibited by any means
And well, I guess partly with what Nevis said
I agree with the conclusion raised last time
https://discord.com/channels/336297387863703552/336299268107403274/705414402911895673
And it was brought up by Anand as well <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
It was
<:HibikiKiss:738240567049191505><:MikuFear:642799630605615114><:MikuKiss:738240587014340649>
Has to be treated on case by case basis
The takeaway is that this stuff will happen anyway, and offered solutions may not necessarily lead to disarming them
Tell them to chill
Like I get the idea? But then instead of emote you could just
I personally think it was resolved well
That it's your responsibility to budge in to keep peace in server, Lily
Once again, it evolved naturally from a serious discussion and people still tried to argue with it well into the vent territory
Eh, but I don't think it would
Not really
I don't even get why he didn't get an emote in the first place <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
<:KirikaBullying:726216183069802586>
<:KirikaShout:607741871703457812>
I had even more, but I did not think you'd use all free slots in one night
(Except it kinda defeats the purpose of keeping emotes here in the first place and we can just abuse animated slots)
Honestly yes

How many emote slots do we have left?

9_8ball Can we make the 9_8ball command just 9_ball?
I'd expect I'd be a copy-paste of code for you from technical side, but admittedly I never wrote discord bot before
<:TsubasaSmug:585839805737467920>
Bitch you better be careful, I'm knocking to you next with js code ready to handle all of this
I saw it with me own eyes!
Nandeko has build in option to cycle colors

Then make containment zone for all spammed memes <:HibikiBlep:605209109284782090>
Just make a containment zone for both
<:ShirabeCheer:671887003414954005>
2. The channel also houses padorus with analogous bot function to 1.
1. The bots get a function to automatically remove messages with Kirikafish from all other channels
I'd approve it under 2 conditions:
<:KirikaSalute:620069889838809089>
Works for me <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>

Where does Kotatsu emote come from, does anyone know offhand?
(probably not today tho)
Request for DMJii emote? How can I say no to that? <:Ver:704169051391524875>
I just remember vast majority of emotes and search them while typing lol
<a:KirikaWham:738937948543647805>
Here's bonus animated emote because we have too many animated slots
So basically a beta version of Ver <:Ver:704169051391524875>
It is a dump channel, there is no reason to keep oddly specific things out of it
¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
It's that nobody gives shit if it ends up there
It's not that food creations *should* go to live shitposting
Let me phrase it this way
The pin specifies that *Symphogear* figures that are specifically not made by you *still* go to <#458060276550336522> <:HibikiSmug:672655850518609940>
Well I mean if you read both pin and description, it is clear that the channel was created for purpose of being a figure collectors' purgatory
It would go in <#407060923078017026> because live-shitposting is practically an anything goes channel with very high audience and turnover
So technically figures and food fall into it via process of elimination
Well I mean I figured user creations is just a dump channel for everything that doesn't fit other channels
Oh man, this *is* actually a figure channel lol
Go figure <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
This is tangential, but notice that <#458060276550336522> is also a nsfw channel
On the other hand I think posting in <#336297808221044736> would be killer for getting attention
If I may post my input, I think the way it used to works well
The fancontent one?
There is always an ‚ö†Ô∏è sign next to channel's #
No more nsfw in fancontent, or is that a slight oversight? <:ShirabeThink:704340938994090005>
Note #1, #raw-discussion is not a channel that exists
And here I thought I'd have to rely on my common sense <:ChrisOi:586551700987576330>
Oh yeah, browser displays correctly
Also still nothing for me
Wait
Hey, don't remove my joke about anarchy, there is no rule about tha-
<a:ShirabeSob:725756411312734228><a:KirikaSob:725756440463147048>
Or that
~~Or just don't readd it at all~~
Since we're probably take a dive into level 2, can we remove padoru and readd it again so that it doesn't take slot of something of value?
That's the thing, it could show the same thing, but also display expiration time to administration
<a:KirikaWham:738960540126150717>
With that being said I almost fell out of chair trying to type the reply so I demand an answer!
I just want to know if boost count displays the same thing to us as it does to you, but I guess it doesn't matter either way
But you also still see 31 otherwise
<@99695384296701952> I see 31 boosts, what do you see?
I think we are still losing them
<:ShirabeChibi:698939825155473499>
Safe from what?
30 is required for level 3 but you can have more
The most I saw was 33
I don't think we've ever been anywhere near 50 though?
<a:KirikaWham:738960540126150717>
Ima clap you smug motherfucker
No, it does say 31 I'm stupid
<:KanadeBleh:672455306059579392>
But 30 according to boost menu
We have 29 boosts, right?

Speaking of hard choices, how would people feel about
<:GarieLaugh:740956278163243050>
Ha ha, you moron
That's quitter's talk
And where are we gonna get the space for all those emotes <:KirikaConcern:698939825386029186>
Don't even have task bar anymore <:KirikaPanic:644235681677180958>
No exploler.exe for me today
Oh well
I downloaded it to check file size and my exploler.exe crashed
I'm kinda curious how the server will look like <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
For real tho I need to pick a day when I will block everyone for next day just for kicks
I'll wait for the thing and then block you
<@!504069701911969803> You are first on the kill list <:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
Plus my their nature as non animated medium, I don't think comic emotes lend themselves well to animated emotes
If I did that, I could just finish it myself
See but that's the thing
Though I was gonna do it myself, but the only thing stopping me is that I'd like to cut out original from episode to get just a bit more room for shake
Plus <:KirikaShout:607741871703457812> has straight up better cropping
It does but I don't know where it came from <:HibikiBlep:605209109284782090>
<a:KirikaShake:722156260241178655>
But
<:KirikaShout:607741871703457812>
We could kinda use
<:ShirabeThink:704340938994090005>
<a:KirikaWham:738960540126150717>
Are you mocking me?
<a:KirikaTears:740336183061512232>
But our server doesnt have infinite nitro space
<:KirikaPlease:730107672455544873>
Damn right they don't
You think you're smart, eh? But it faces wrong way in more than one sense which makes it <:KirikaShout:607741871703457812>
It's a good emote but makes me scratch head over it's use
And also on <@!222517038042710017>'s request <:KirikaWink:689564310908960900>
For all your vertical peeking needs <:KiriShiraPeek:741068161218248794>
<:KiriShiraPeek:741068161218248794>
And now that I have acquired goodwill time to squander it <:KirikaApproval:586957465552158720>
It is not visible in emote size
Slight tweak
<:MariaCute:741050161098129499> Totally not trying to buy myself goodwill for adding more DMJii emotes, no no no, I would never do that
<:MariaCute:741050161098129499>
Don't say I've never done anything for you
Wouldn't worry about it that much tbh
Well, that will teach them picking color based on their color preference!
I think these roles should have a minor revision since it makes a bizzare situation
XV villains didn't even get their own color role because it was released after the roles were established <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Ignore entirety of XV
Even current way while it seems kinda nice, I think it's actually really, really bad for reasons I don't want to disclose in public
Idk the more I think about it, the more I figure there are just no good solutions for server boosting
Well, there you go, sent it to discord staff <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
As in if boosting to level 3 granted all members of its server ability to use emotes from that server on any other server regardless of whether they have nitro or not?
But it only works for nitro users and if that was preferable, we would've done that already
It really doesn't work all that well for this server in particular <:KirikaSad:666052894935613443>
But like
I mean, I do realize that it has some upsides, for example it doesn't incentivize people to throw in boosts ad nauseum at one server just for sake of it
Kinda weird move on discord side, because the way it is set up now, it actively incetivizes people to remove their boosts if server has more than 30
The max is how much we have now
And also this
Less than that
<:HibikiTired:422925410490253313>
Not when you have only 250 emote slots
I mean to be fair, just cropping emote so that it's square shaped and previeving it yourself is a good start, since if it's good, somebody will remove background for you
And grow myself competition? <:KirikaWink:689564310908960900>
<:TsubasaYareYare:407397617451139073>
You are killin' me man
<:FujitakaTest:742025354834870302>
You can just, do this
<:KirikaSkeptical:586406806482583556>
What are you even suggesting that Miku's hair would get in the way?
Mood
And also because I'm kinda operating under an assumption that my post will be replaced eventually
It should be self assignable (?), but I didn't put it in because it's not in use anymore. And also because it's not really my job to document it <:HibikiBlep:605209109284782090>
<:KirikaWink:689564310908960900>
No, you discovered a little secret
<:ShirabeMad:688188118087499792>
Raiden you are like 90% of reason why I'm suggesting this
How many hidden DMJii images have I missed on because they were hidden in albums behind links <:KirikaShout:607741871703457812>
Yeah!
I don't think I will
No
Give bot ability to at least tell you how many images are there in an album <:ElsaSick:689395768754569359>
Neither does pixiv
Pixiv is like the main art platform
PC screen
See for instance https://www.pixiv.net/en/artworks/79771799
It does but preview is shit
If you could do reverse source searching and make it so if you post source, the bot will post the image it refers to
Oh, I know what could be cool as shit
I'm kinda tempted to save it as quote now
Call me illiterate because I can't read
Okay, new suggestion
Specify that you are supposed to use it when posting multiple images from same source <:TsubasaPeek:623246193002151938>
<:ShirabePlease:724034356192215081>
(with explicit option of handling special event roles like ones for Carol birthday pretty pls)
And only other thing I can think of off the top of my head is adding/removing roles via reactions to certain message like old Kiri used to
<:KirikaGlint:689561325654900810>
Cuz I thought you could hook it up to your collection and give ability to request images
Is the bot hosted like not on your PC Kerrik?
~~Where's the fun if you can't trigger it accidentally?~~
This is a test
<:ElfneinTrip:688025973932687377>

If it was taken from the source in like 88x88 format, then maybe?

With that said, I have something prepared for both slots, don't you worry your little butt
It amassed less uses than Sparkle when Sparkle existed for shorter time span <:KirikaMad:688188152891834417>
<:KirikaPanic:644235681677180958>
Wait, you weren't merely mocking my explanation
But <:KirikaMegane:585848185847676939> is the only Kirika emote with glasses, and they are otherwise the same emote in different styles, nothing more and nothing less
tbh I'd swap both <:KirikaSparkle:698939825876631714> and <:KirikaMegane:585848185847676939> for something myself
For which one between the 2 you prefer <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Err, vote I guess
<:KirikaSparkle:698939825876631714> ‚û°Ô∏è <:KirikaPlease:730107672455544873>
Because <:KirikaSparkle:698939825876631714> and <:KirikaMegane:585848185847676939> are so similar, I propose swapping former for another emote, to be specific:
Oh well, anyway
<:KirikaCry:674720015047720961>
You type 3_del directly after and it deletes wack image link and 3_del message itself
If you post an image in sfw or nsfw which you do not want sourced, and the bot sources it
No
3_del command to delete last command output directly over the command, along with the command itself

You can't even see the biting frame <:ChrisAngry:336656958272700417>
No, but that's far from slow tho
Yeah, I figure, but last 2 frames (Which were repeated) didn't need to be sped up
(X) Doubt
You just sped it up <:ChrisOi:586551700987576330>
The gif I made is as-in-anime (timing non-exact)
No I am actually genuinely curious how are you going to do that

You can set these reaction roles with one command
Wait a minute
~~Also the birthday roles that add color on top and are removed day after, that was *really* fun~~
I don't think these roles are cancelled, and I'd like to see them functional again personally. But they don't work right now
You used to be able to assign these roles by clicking a reaction to a post in <#448237561085952001>, but Elfnein is not capable of handling that as of present
<:MikuDelete:661660028410920990>

Could also mention that you can have any number and combination of roles
(Disclaimer: Don't do that)
I just want to note that it would be very fitting to have Color Me Ver role that's just #ffffff
That is also true
For?
Status update: Fish, Lank and Mac's .2 stars are gone
I offer Lank to deny Lank's offering
So be it
<:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
What could possibly go wrong if you gave the power to public?
Make an event in which people can choose whether Akira or Ogawa get the brown color role

Any thoughts on emote servers for emote overflows?
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
:15min:
Yeah, but if I ever want to sit on voice while AMQ is going on, I would like to stay as far away from you as possible
Because realistically it'd be a very quiet place
Make no mistake though, I think second voice channel would still be useful, if for no other reason than creating space between text and voice channel and making it less likely to missclick
Because unlike text channels, in voice channels you can't have many concurrent threads running simultaneously, if Tsubasa's Concert Hall is playing AMQ then that's all that's going to be talked about in general voice
I wouldn't say that AMQ warrants its own channel, unless we'd make second voice text channel for spacing and for offloading <#336298587745157120>
And even as a joke, I didn't refer to a minor touchup of an emote
That was a joke
> I don't think people were, though?
I did <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
Oh don't worry, you got me angry, so that's my next point on the list now
The original purpose doesn't matter if people started using it differently
How does asking not to change an emote help me with anything?
*That's literally not what I was talking about*
<a:KirikaWham:738960540126150717>
Hey, don't change the topic
This one time
Lol no, I just think the change was uncalled for
That's not relevant <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
<a:KirikaUpset:688429724221046872>
That's not what I meant nevis
Thread closed
<:KirikaPlease:730107672455544873> is not an emote
Neither it's original purpose, nor the fact that it's questionably an upgrade matter
But it deleted it's other purpose <:ChrisAngry:336656958272700417>
Why won't we just delete it comepletely if people with Nitro can still use it? <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
You can't handwave emote quality because people have nitro
You might want to check your dictionary Phanta, becase <:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>  is literally not superior
Not the same thing
But what am I gonna use now when I need to say "What the fuck"?
Eeeeh
It's right in the name
Is straight up "You have three seconds to get the fuck out of my field of view"
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
<:HibikiSmug:672655850518609940>
Good idea
Imagine having more animated emojis than non-animated ones
<:KirikaWink:689564310908960900>
You know, if we did thematic servers, we could just make it so specific people take care of what goes there
I mean the point is that any questions would probably be still answered here
<:YumiPoint:688429724103344164>
It would be less work than everyone having their own
Which I also didn't do because emote size <:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
I didn't want to do it 2 ways because emote size, and also I think it'd be better to extend the zoom time so it hits you more like <a:TsubasaBroken:663625017191432192>
I mean, that's well within your abilities <:HibikiBlep:605209109284782090>
<a:HibikiAniDisgust:777593803342610472>
I'll agree that pixels should probably be replaced with their appropriate characters
<:HibikiMunch:672606446239744000> is technically more popular
Pick one

You mean it's sick?
Being obscured by text is fixable
The public has spoken
Also while there's motion in this channel, I want to innocuously post this
Stop listening to Kirika
That's just something we'll have to tackle every time a good emote appears
I think deletion hierarchy is too volatile to be decided in one swoop
> Is you sacrifice Chris the next thing that'll happen to you will be that your face is gone
Low price to pay
One of these days we'll find worthy Tomosato and Fujitaka emotes to replace these

Not a suggestion really, but if someone wants it, I slapped this together in 30 seconds
Just have several emote servers lead by independent contractors <:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
Animated slots are literally worthless consiedering you need nitro whether they are on server or not <:HibikiBlep:605209109284782090>

I'd trade that 1:2 for normal emojis tbh
<:Zababies:672238628398956594>
But there is no easy solution to that I don't think
It's also kinda hard to see what's on server, you have to search for it in emote menu on another server
We did
Plus Padoru's could be grouped together as they were before here for better legibility
Anyway, <:ShirabeWow:781970709194342440> <:ShirabePlease:724034356192215081> and <:CarolShock:781002150276628492> <:CarolShock:730816714345938956> are duplicates which are on both servers

Like, at the end, the channel doesn't enable us to do anything that we can't do right now, it just makes it less annoying. Less like after putting work into something,  the server is just gonna throw logs under your legs to make finding audience more difficult
Another more reasonable proposal, we could just run some permutation of such channel for test, for some period of time, given that after that time it's gonna be deleted. A lot of arguments are based on "What will people do with it" which none of us knows because everyone individually is just one peop
<:NoiseTea:688192213762572295>
You could always make such channel hidden from everyone but people with either writing prompts or community anthology roles if you want to ensure that the channel is for erotica enjoyers and not wankers
2 more things I can toss
Well yeah, but again, how often it won't be used is opposite of a problem as I see it
Now mind you, you can also work around the limitations of chats as is, though the way to do so is quite obfuscated
Point is, even if you made channel specifically for nsfw fancontent,  and it only ever gets used once in 3 days, that's like, the opposite of problem
Live shitposting and nsfw have new posts every 20 seconds as is
Fancontent gives people time to view and leave feedback on work
The exact problem with needing nsfw fancontent is because there is no low turnover channel for, well, nsfw fancontent
~~Well if we can post smut there then by all means~~
Well, fair. You could still sample them and post in <#407060923078017026>
I mean the point is to check

<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>

Yup and this is the exact smug energy I needed
9_. Kerrik You just want better quotes to save to pull out when you're bored at work.
Since well, she is going to steal focus anyway, might as well make it better
~~Again I just think she should post longer/more messages at once~~
Idle timer is not a bad idea
And yeah, finally
I just think follow up messages are simple and fairly organic
I dunno how you go about it
<:HibikiOhNo:586337444597596202>
Maybe more
Say 10% chance of follow up
Well, yes that's why make 2+ messages instead of trying to mess with neural network
Since so far she only sends very short messages
Or if you're willing to get fancy, giving her high chance to follow up on her own message would be nice

Do not question my logic
Technically you can draw for writing prompts
How do you use these
Also, dang Phanta, I'm sorry <:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
But like, I don't think this is anyhow enforceable past saying if you are <18, don't go in this channel
I do think that having a role for when someone in NSFW channels *really* wants to make it clear that they shouldn't have access to it
Now I'm well aware that you don't need to be adult to just say yes, but I figure it's not on mods to keep track of everybody's age. Particularly consiedering what Phanta said too
It's marked NSFW, which requires you to confirm that you are adult
Formally at least
It already is 18+ though?
But also, yes please

Are you sure?
Mind you there is no rush for making nsfw fancontent thread until someone actually expresses interest in it, but it's worth keeping in mind
Yup
But it will not be visible if it has no traffic
It *will* auto-archive, which is actually part of the point, and as far as I can tell unarchieving it is as easy as posting a message there, which anyone can do
Permanent as in, rather than having everyone create their own thread, there is one specific for this kind of content
There could be permanent, <#336297808221044736> specific thread for such stuff which would auto hide after like a day, without affecting or being affected by traffic of parent channel
Come to think of it, threads are also perfect solution to nsfw fancontent
To be honest, the only downside to replacing fancontent with threads *entirely* is that it would exacerbate feeling of being ignored, if your work doesn't get any attention; then again, it would be easier to find said work since it would have it's own dedicated channel
You have no idea just how many times I outright forgone reading prompt because discussion on it long since died down
Writing prompts (fancontent in general tbh) is also kind of topic that stays frash *much* longer than live chat format can allow it to
For one, it makes the discussion easier to find, because there's literally separate channel space for those
And I think having a volatile and dedicated space for prompts would serve as net positive
Frankly, of all channels, I don't see fancontent having problem with traffic
On the other hand, sometimes you need to remind people to wait until discussion on previous topic dies down before posting
Been thinking about uses for threads, but frankly they have limited use because you'd need to give people permissions to create them to use them effectively
So I don't spoil it accidentally
That's why you should tell me about every surprise ahead of the time
Wouldn't it be cool to use these brand new shiny threads for writing prompts?
I think it's better to be thorough and include it anyway instead
On the other hand that also undermines the purpose of pronoun roles in the first place
Ah, yeah, it just clicked
But what does that mean lol
Check about?
If thread is forcefully achieved by mod, indeed only mod can reverse that, but that doesn't seem to be the case if thread auto-archives
I seem to be able to unachieve them just fine, even without permission to manage thread
Blocked! Blocked Again!
Plus, frankly, if you're gonna be interested in sheer volume of pings you're gonna get in art channels, you're probably gonna scroll through them all anyway
It would require creating another set of duplicate character roles which is already a big no no
<:KirikaWoke:798785496351375390>
But not for ich
Call a Krankenwagen
<:heh:794343079686832148>
Oh yeah, that one I can't speak
Tak
Spices things up
A dedicated channel is not a good idea, but I reserve right to WPROWADZAƒÜ KOMOLETNY CHAOS W DYSKUSJI POPRZEZ ZMIANƒò JƒòZYKA once in a while
Our messages here aren't approved by mods before they are posted either
Mods ultimately cannot stop anyone from breaking rules, they can only react and/or punish people that already did, or closest to - educate people on what is ok and what isn't
And why would it be?
It's not like mods can moderate voice chat or streaming without people reporting any offences in it
It would be a matter of individual responsibility one way or another
To me the logic that streaming somehow cannot be enabled, *while* vc exists and there is no problems with it whatsoever, is a little shaky
I just like arguing for arguing sake tbf, if mods just don't want to have streaming then I'll have hard time convincing them they should
But they cannot monitor text 100% of the time anyway
Either way somebody needs to see infringement first to be able to report it
It's no different unless mods just happen to be the only ones who saw the message
There's an obvious flaw in that logic in that they could post a picture or video even in this channel
I'm not entirely sure what moderating it is *supposed* to be like either
If I'm playing tabletops and someone asks "hey how do I do X", the easiest way would be to screenshare and show for example
Yeah, but it's inconvenient
Consieder that we have color roles specifically to override character roles
The issue for the most part would be retroactively adding them to existing roles, whose purpose is only to show off anyway
Don't you need an account to open full image in pixiv?
Actually
Pixiv command is good idea, but it has to be command
But it's manual, and that defeats the point of making it automatic. ~~But then it shouldn't be automatic, as was said before~~
On the other hand, if ygg does it's own preview, then whenever someone posts content that's wrong in anyway, mods will *have to* intervene every time it happen; you will not be able to spoiler them in a simple way either
But then again, it might've been a while since I checked
Although for Pixiv it makes sense if it's one image because pixiv previews were kinda garbo last time I checked
That's... kinda pointless for twitter
I mean I am (not do I see anyone who does) not saying there shouldn't be exploding links for pixiv
Also not saying it shouldn't be a thing, but it should always be done manually, if at all
There is also a subtle issue of pixiv galeries having potentially upwards to hundred and so pictures
Wanna see some art pixiv consieders "sfw"? <:harold:876181084285595748>
Ah, then yes. The choice should be up to the one posting
And the need for clicking is why people want exploding links in the first place
Going on website requires you clicking the link, and if there is (for some reason) NSFW image in tweet, then that doesn't help mobile user at all
<:CoolNoiseDontLookAtExplosions:929758650157895711>
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
And if it's achieved, tech is no longer allowed on the server
Make a thread for tech with 7 days achieve time
There is no way around that without using threads to have parallel discussions, but I think it was already established that having threads for each individual work is not a great idea
I dunno, I think time sensitivity goes counter to the idea of giving exposure
Other Matts just get 24h mute, just as a warning
Correct.
I'll also ban Solo just to make a point
If I win, I will ban Matt immediately
Okay I'm applying for mod
WHAT DID YOU DO LILY <:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
For more complex situations than spam links or someone calling slurs in general, maybe less so
Just pinging is like the fastest way to call mods where they are needed
But you wouldn't give one rights to handle the tech side if they can't resolve conflicts
I think at this point in time we need more technical mods than ones to resolve conflict
¬Ø\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø
First we need to see who'll apply so
<:KirikaConcern:698939825386029186>
I'd be skinned alive if I banned those
Sounds pretty safe to me
Isn't Lily like Yuri in Japanese?
But I did exactly the same <:harold:876181084285595748>
You think that's gonna satisfy me? <:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>  Why?
What does that mean
<:SusAngela:766807767398744114>
Yo what's up with that
:15min:
So, why tighten it by throwing tech into gaming?
If a new tech for anime development was created, why should discussion of it go anywhere but <#371105434771390465>?
Do you realize how many aspects of life tech affects?
That's what the general channels are for
There is plenty of tech that are not gaming related and these do not belong in that channel
Well yes, that's what I said
<:HibikiBlep:605209109284782090>
Counterpoint: if you give flying fuck about specs, you're using PC for gaming
Everything else should go anywhere else
The reason why tech is brought up in <#337805317276565525> in the first place is because it's about tech... Used for gaming
It's wildly a matter of preference anyway because another, bigger server (of a game) has *no* gaming channel and it's perfectly fine too
Legit most threadworthy thing that happened here
<:harold:876181084285595748>
Only saw it happen to Kamen Rider fans
There's very little reason to banish specific group of people to their own quasi-channel in this server
You don't really need that here
But the server has much bigger throughput
And it works really well
Another server I'm on uses threads for specific games
Otherwise people would just assume there's no music channel and talk about music in general
If you want to discuss music, there's immediately visible channel for that, and you don't need to search for music thread shoved into some backwater channel
They are not threads
Gaming would have much higher traffic, as such it couldn't be shoved into thread of much lower traffic channel
And if it's only going to be gaming tech, why do anything? That's literally status quo
Why throw entire field, which gaming tech is only narrow part of, into gaming specifically, when you can not do that?
And how people discussing newest water carbonation machines on the market will not annoy people who want to discuss games?
It's a solution to problem that doesn't really exist, but creates more problems and confusion
Again I fail to see how that clarifies anything without explicitly dumping tech into <#337805317276565525>
And in shitposting channels too
I also do want to point out that hardware is being talked in <#336297387863703552> and it's perfectly fine
Very funny
Because it's gaming tech
It's talked about in gaming
Not everything is about you, you weren't even there when I was talking about it
I was surprised that Mel basically laid 1:1 the same argument as myself
Damn, looks like my arguments were on point <:Weirdland:784677851840512030>
It would be ok as channel, I don't really feel like it'd have traffic tho
I think blinking speed itself was good before, but if there was an additional loop or two of bit between, I feel like it'd be a lot better
And while we're in the subject, I also feel both are a bit too blinky
I think the newer will be better, but since it's not in emote format, I can't fully tell
<:KirikaApproval:586957465552158720>
They didn't actually drop the ball with this one!
Yeah
Biggest issues with threads as I see it is obfuscation and making it kinda difficult to create new threads, neither of which are problems that forums have
Someone's finger slipped
If you want Maria color, you'd need to use color roles, that's why they exist
No, they are set server side
And there's no cape emote
There's just much more of color roles
Well, Elfnein is pretty robust IIRC, but most of the functions are turned off
I think 9 is a locally hosted premade bot
But yeah, "Live spoilposting" would be an oddly specific channel which I can Imagine wouldn't have much audience, which in turn would kind of defeat the purpose of it in the first place
<:ElfneinTrip:688025973932687377>

In other words: cope
Since liveposting is a dumping channel, I feel like this is just one of the dangers of existing in it that you can't really reconcile
I feel (and I do actually feel it personally) that this has only became a problem now because the subject being liveposted is an anime which just about everyone here has at least tangential interest in
I dunno, I'm also of the opinion that you have a second shitposting channel

,down
It's going to benefit humanity forever after
Half hour is nothing
The dedication
It has been done
You can add me to while you're at it <@!263983345669505025>
It's mostly accurate representation indeed
What kind of gear is that?
The spoon coming towards your mouth?
That part hasn't been a problem, see how hard it is to look away though
I also think <:HibikiWow:614268629952757760>
¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
Maybe they don't want free advertising on pretty drawings
You are walking thin ice Tsubasa
If it's good, it's nice to see again
(Nope, that doesn't work in English)
Because your work is sweet
Just say that in your free time you are helping people with sugar deficiency
The dedication! I hope you mentioned it in interview
~~So you still have time for complaining?~~
Poor dessbasa
What do they say?
Oh no, I can see where this bit is going
oOOoooh
What happens here?
<:ShirabeEmbarassed:336657288477671436>
Don't say it like that, she's trying her best \:(
Gimme gimme gimme
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
That's like the last thing I'd want to see, if I were sad
Maybe it's like an dinosaur dog?
I need to remind myself to check here when I'm back home tomorrow
(I don't actually understand, what is he talking about?)
I understand
You are threading thin ice
That is my singular purpose
But it's more about your initial set, so to speak
First off, you would not believe how hard it is
That means pictures you already posted here are a free real estate for dailies <:MikuPraise:585839808765493249>
Hmmm, do pictures you post here actually make it into the private channels, Kerrik?
Except...
How do you combine "Maria" and "Blob"?
As in they are two people of opposite gender who spend any time at all in each other presence
Ogawa X Basa makes *some* sense
How to destroy whole anime server in one picture, featuring Anand and Kerrik
Kerrik probably got you all the straight art he had
You would try
I have only nice DMJii pics
I'm helping
I just noticed all these needle punctures D:
Why would it be concept art?
Baka
But it's not like I didn't like it, or anything
Indeed
I tried to read novels, actually, but I kind off run out of steam in middle of three stories
It's more about finding time and will
Legitimate? Maybe
I think even apart from dubious meaning of interesting literature, I'll pass, on the account that I can't read
<:CarolBlush:617039657896509460>
Interesting literature, huh?
Look at this guy, I didn't even notice myself \:P
My time is also coming soon
(But I will still disagree on principle)
To be fair, I also don't think I actually have any strong preference in one way or another
üò§
Short hair is a state of mind
Yeah, I get it
<@!472513526393602059> Counterpoint:
What is happening on that Carolnein picture?
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
Ah fuck
Yeah, but I wouldn't know because I barely passed german
But has Ver in it
Because it's german for warning
Yeah
(What an unfortunate choice of drive letter, smh)
Now pardon me, I need to format my D drive
Verwarnung!
Hey <@!472513526393602059> I decided to actually do it
OH DUDE, I THINK I SOLVED IT
I don't think so actually
Maybe she can be lured down with pictures of Tsubasa
I will let you figure out which answer is to which question
*Just a little bit* and *more than you'd ever thought*
(While you are hugging her, move Maria down a slot on user list pls)
Share some with <@449062815534153748> too üíö
There is just enough to keep recycling old ones
Even after they are no more new Ver fanart
That's a sweet looking Shirabe
Somebody call an exorcist
I will take issue with that O
They are in <#336299268107403274>, not far scroll up
That artist really likes Kirika's butt, if I recognize them properly
Beauty
I never noticed she had tied up hair
Case in point
But the cold spots are the shit, why <:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
<:ShirabeEmbarassed:336657288477671436>
<:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
These 3 comic strips
If this is what out of control looks like, the I don't mind <:ShirabeEmbarassed:336657288477671436>
<:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
That's very rude
üéÜ
<:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
(Or you know, the flu might have something to it too)
No wonder, you probably subconsciously don't want to see sad Kirika
And *that* makes you feel like you are safe? <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
You should move your computer so it's not so easily seen though the window
You must be going though trios
Look what got caught in the net <:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>

Hell, she would drag Carol to Miku and scream at her on sight "MIKU! I BECAME A DAD!"
Spawnshine
In which order are you gonna ~~dump~~ post these 4?
Kerrik being out of images is a catastrophe in general
And she's trying so hard too <:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
Poor Shirabe
But you better not be lying üòí
That's okay
Pssst, Kerrik, ping me if you post any DMJii comics
What <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
She mad because they made Kirika cry
Comics takes roughly half of space of XV stuff, but has only 20 files less
Interesting
<:KirikaShout:607741871703457812>
Oh, so when Sketch remembers something from year and half ago it's impressive, but when I remember something from last week it's stalking?
I suppose this whole ordeal had to happen specifically because he didn't sort in the first place
At this point he can also sort it on the fly
For a moment I thought you were already done, how foolish of me
That's why it's a Chrisis
WINTER CHRISIS
I read that as "Winter Crisis" for some reason
<@!263983345669505025> Neat
Nothing, but I think this is a fine price for letting Kerrik rest
You can throw an imaginary chair at imaginary me instead, I'll accept it if it means letting Kerrik rest
Have some mercy on Kerrik
Aria plz

<:ShirabeEmbarassed:336657288477671436>
Mischievous little devil <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I want to know the context
Why is Kiri crying? <:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
Note to self: Shirabe won't give you source for link
You think Kerrik has time to learn Japanese, let alone put it into good use? <:TsubasaSmug:585839805737467920>
If you get a permission from Nabe
<:ShiraBean:661294258795446326>
What about lakes?
Tfw you roll diving and geology as interests
<:ShiraBean:661294258795446326>
<:ShirabeEmbarassed:336657288477671436>
Is it even possible to leave (or kick) from group?
No wonder I never noticed, huh
I WOULD NEVER
That would make sense
Oh, maybe only Kerrik can as the king
I'm scared <:TsubasaPeek:623246193002151938>
Don't answer that
Why are you busy on *Sunday* of all days of the week?
Deep inside his heart?
<:ShirabeEmbarassed:336657288477671436>
He's exceptionally self aware for a pile of fine dust
I gotta give Fizzy a credit
Ah, you meant that it was a good thing to not include it
Wasn't the S1 chart done retroactively?

Is... is that an example?
Where do you have these .jfif files I haven't seen one in the wild ever
<:HibikiWhat:336656482907193344>
And you are fine again!
<:HibikiWow:614268629952757760>

Don't make Shirabe cry
Why did Basa knight kidnap Shirabe <:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
That looks dangerous
Good one
Lol
<:ShirabeCheer:661042424570708037>

No hair Tsubasa?

<@!263983345669505025> I'm sure you have something out there that will make me cry
~~You are both wrong~~
Just ping everyone
We've gone full circle
Just give her Gungnir, problem solved
Gunblade?
Gotta say, I'm sold on this ship
<:CarolSmug:617040484111745027>
The idea of Kirika saying "Panzerkamfwagen" excitedly as well as his pfp
Honestly amazing
<:ShirabeEmbarassed:336657288477671436>

But I got that image
A new pic? <:ShirabeConcern:586404485598019604>
~~And blame you Kerrik if it turns out it's not~~
I'll lean on your judgement
<:ShirabeEmbarassed:336657288477671436>
Yes <:ShirabeEmbarassed:336657288477671436>
These two are planning something
<:CoolNoiseDontLookAtExplosions:673239311876882462>
No, it's fine, she's technically bullying herself
It's a quite fine Shirabe
Maybe it was too extreme

You gotta ask yourself, if your boss saw you at work viewing that particular image, what would they think? <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
For as much as I like google, their handling of offences is wildly questionable
Mhm, you might not want to have those on the same disc space
Isn't this the whole Kerrik's Drive bar e-mails?
Are you gonna keep your whole stash somewhere else? Or lewds separately?
Free space for projects <:MikuPraise:585839808765493249>
One day
I should set up proper sync backup myself
Nevermind, there is such policy in place, it's just hidden in google docks help center...?
And the person whose twitter is linked mentions possibility of being banned for lewds en passant (as explanation of why their account wasn't reinstated)
Granted, I didn't look in depth, but you'd think such policy change would set whole Internet on fire
Because last change to Google ToS was on 22th January... of last year
I have a bone to pick with what Zare posted
Maybe for you
Why did I download 2GB of images if I'm about to be struck with another 1GB <:TonyEyeRoll:580561912513691679>
Even just something as basic as e-mails
There is a lot of thing google is good for (and code is not one of them)
Not your company in particular, just any in general
~~Ah, sorry, you are still unemployed~~
All down
Oh, and if your company uses google services and google notices problem with it?
<:KanadeSmile:672455286392356884>
One infringement virtually deletes all services related to your account
<:MikuBliss:336657233712513024>
So much space
No sources though <:KirikaSob:674720015047720961>
Now you can post them here <:ElfneinWeld:586027421296492585>
I bet you have at least 1 picture 50MB in size
Kerrik is all about that efficiency
Like if you have frame with just head (and no tail)
What's the visual difference between foxgirl and catgirl?
But you are gonna be like "What's the point, you already have all DMJii fanart"
I would ask for 50MB of DMJii fanart
But it's 50 for all of us because out server was boosted into stratosphere
50MB?
<:ShirabeJoy:672105345316814878><:KirikaJoy:672105345342111785>

No
<:Germain:421434126856486912>
Where'd you got this, I want <:ShirabeCry:671887081026617345>
Weird
Okay

Hey Shirabe, may I ask you to source me this?
Oh yeah, I was about to ask
Anyway
And yet, you live there
In state of denial
Yeah
<:TsubasaSmug:585839805737467920>
Sounds like you are in denial
ShiriKiri shenanigans <:ElfneinAAA:672437636362665984>
I'm on your side here <:KirikaShout:607741871703457812>
Imagine if Kerrik tagged all his pics
Allow me to restate, some say that the state of your art stash represents state of your mind
Well, shit I got purged
Some say that the state of your art stash represents state of your mind
<:KirikaSob:674720015047720961>
And I had tabs with art open
My chrome crashed
OH NO
<:ShiraBean:661294258795446326>
Cute
<:KirikaMunch:672599382670966785>
Or a bit short of 4 years if you posted one every hour
If you posted one picture each day it would take you more than 95 years to go though them
<:MikuBliss:336657233712513024>
35000 and 1
I'm to stubborn for that
So yeah, be warned I guess, that's something that can happen
<:KirikaSob:674720015047720961>
Also, I won't be checking if it crashes again, because I exceeded transfer limit, apparently
I start up with 20 tabs open
That's roughly how many I have open on start <:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
I'll try once more, this time looking at RAM usage
Roughly 1GB
Well, I'm only downloading 3GB, it should be enough
It is prebuild, but not a laptop, also 4.9, 6.9 is unused
It's 2x2 and 2x4
Computer magic <:Ver:336656981144109066>
12GB
What would be wrong with my system? <:MariaNo:672658725986762764>
<:ElfneinPalm:672430572961923092>
Yeah, but I don't want to use an app. I didn't need app before, you see <:ElfneinDrowning:336656417035517952>
It crashed again
Well I'll be damned
My wrath will be unstoppable
I'll try again, and if it doesn't work I'm gonna kick a puppy
I don't know what's happening
AND I EXCEEDED DOWNLOAD LIMIT? WHAT?
jii_skip
What a cruel joke
It's actually Mega that crashes my Chrome
You know what
Thank you
Can I have a hug? <:KirikaSob:674720015047720961>
CHROME WHY
<:ElfneinPalm:672430572961923092>
I guess I had that coming for me
That's what Chrome does too (unless you use incognito)
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
Shit man, I was actually in the process of doing that too
You can have some very cute picture though
So yeah, I propose if we want to continue that stream of consciousness to do that elsewhere
Yeah, that's pretty funny
<:ShirabeJoy:672105345316814878><:KirikaJoy:672105345342111785>

Ooooh, that's cute
<:KirikaSob:674720015047720961>
Nobody ever pings me with ShiriKiri pics

I don't understand, help

Can you pitch the other pic too?
<:ShirabeEmbarassed:336657288477671436>
<:ShirabeEmbarassed:336657288477671436>
Nighttime Shirabe is cute
And who cares anyway
Does sound like a nightmare
But then I never had to tie my hair, I suppose
Personally, the most uncomfortable thing about hair and sleeping for me was sleeping with hair on face
Why not though?
Yeah, but she has her hair down because she should be sleeping
I can't handle all of this <:KirikaPanic:644235681677180958>
So many happy Shirabes
https://twitter.com/yoshiidan/status/1229000345608523777
I agree, but why do I not know that?
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
Is it bayonet?
bayonet?
Oh no
Oh
It's bay
Or are you just noticing because you look in its general direction?
<:ChrisOi:586551700987576330>
Why are you so focused on scar?
The way you store your pics is an indication of your state of mind
<:ShirabeEmbarassed:336657288477671436>
You rang?
Where are *those* fics at?
That's sick

I have like one pic of Hibiki in my stash, hold on
<:ShirabeEmbarassed:336657288477671436>
These DMJii comics
Any Kirika is best Kirika
This honestly
<:ShirabeCry:671887081026617345>

I don't care about others
I mean
I thought Kerrik throws all his finds on DM groups
Wait a second
Fluffy <:ElfneinWeld:586027421296492585>
<:KirikaSalute:620069889838809089>
(And remember to throw me any stray DMJiis lost in the chaos)
Godspeed Kerrik
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
But if I don't get 100% of Kerrik's flow of DMJii pictures, that's outrageous
<:MikuBliss:336657233712513024>

It still don't know
I did a quick research and here are the results:

Take note folks, this might be the last one in your life
Teenein
Fools, that's what she wants
Poor Maria
I was asking more about how they are barefoot and sitting sullenly in some rocky pit, but sure, tunnel vision on hand holding
What's that?
‚òî
Whole Tsubasa is pretty cute tbh
I want these stickers
<:ShiraBean:661294258795446326>
That DMJii car is 10/10
Don't you think camera angles in anime can be a little weird?
Pssst please use jii_skip if you post images from same set <:ShirabeWhisper:620073899001905153>
Cause it makes you warm when you are in close proximity? <:ShiraBean:661294258795446326>
I guess I needn't really ping you but still
I saw, it's how I found it, but I wanted to point put it out anyway
Hey <@!263534352422404096> here's artist who made the pic you were looking for https://www.pixiv.net/en/users/1820471
Kanawet <:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>

<:ChrisHappy:660870796696223744>
Then I will wait for you to post them one channel down
Oh, you got pictures of that?
~~Hope she got some good "punishment" from Shirabe for that~~
<:ShiraBean:661294258795446326>
She is guilty of being cute dess
Yeah
<:ShirabeEmbarassed:336657288477671436>
What's Shirabe doing to Kirika?
That's because Ikxi is not on server right now

:ShirabeNotBean:
<:ShirabeCry:671887081026617345>
Enlighten us
<:ShiraBean:661294258795446326>
<:GenjuroLaugh:689563633516150872>
God help I'm dying
Just kiss
No unless
dess_horny
If you want to
You can get bonked anyway
Miku is right, head of relationship and also wears pants
Zababa kiss <:MikuGay:336656810788388864>
<:ShirabeJoy:672105345316814878><:KirikaJoy:672105345342111785>
Crisis averted
I found all my kissing DMJii pictures
You can't say that and not show the comic
Surprising Kiri with birthday party is the only valid reason to make her cry
It better be
<:ShirabeAwe:698939825113268306>

And if you are, let your parents know that in case of your sudden death of disappearance I'll be coming over to copy files
You are not going anywhere anyway
Probably will need to use torrents anyway, but that will have to wait for now
I'll figure something out, eventually
Pretty much
I'm just too stubborn to download extension
My computer is better than yours <a:KirikaUpset:688429724221046872>
/s
That sounds nice, do that
tfw I don't use torrent
We need to get together and write torrent 2
Unless you'd split them into batches
I feel like having frequently updated content kind of defeats purpose of putting it on torrent though
Although with torrents I believe frequent updates make them exponentially more useless
Isn't that basically what you need to do already?
Doing stuff on your pc and then just waiting for the **miracle of thechnology** to update the work for you is exhilarating
You should've done that
<:ShirabeDone:688198954810474559>
Google drive was great in this regard because you could just sync your drive folder with the one on PC
<:ShirabeAwe:698939825113268306>
<:MikuGay:336656810788388864>
Entirely subjective
Best way to go
<:HibikiFingerguns:688429715836502063>
(Upgrading PC would need to wait anyway, I'd need at least 2 full pays to be able to upgrade now and I have shit to buy before that, but I digress)

Visqi is working on DMJii mural?
Kerrik did you take this actual picture of me just couple seconds ago?
And taint my clipboard with Ver? NeVer!
Ah, to hell with it, who wants to look at Ver anyway
No, wait that album is somewhat NSFW
Eh, damn
Sure discord, don't load it, I'm not gonna download that anyway
<:GenjuroLaugh:689563633516150872>
The hell, I'm viewing a pixiv of some artist and they have just random pictures of Ver like https://i.pximg.net/img-original/img/2016/01/27/22/12/19/54940108_p7.png
Anyway the takeaway is that Kumeringo is a treasure for a person such as myself

2. Isn't Zugai like 16? <:thonk:531554645143715841>
1. You got 40k pics
Wait a minute
Is it not the issue tho?
Yes Kerrik, I did notice lack of DMJii fanart too <:KirikaSad:666052260567973897>
That and I, for instance, basically scrolled though all of that without looking
<:MikuBliss:336657233712513024>
Pretty please <:ShiraBean:661294258795446326>

I bet you are some people
The answer is Kerrik, but yeah, I might also be interested <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>

<:KirikaWink:689564310908960900>
<@!170641480791228417> These would also make great avatars, me thinks

Okay, I need stop now before disturbance in force wakes Kerrik up









Can't close to floodgates now

When I asked for pics I asked specifically for screens from anime/shinais or 4comas
Plus it feels wrong to do tbh <:ShirabePout:336656831978012712>

I believe large swords like Zweihenders didn't need to be sharp, they just needed to be sharp enough (Which doesn't neccesarily have to be very sharp) to let their sheer mass do the magic
Exactly

Too far from these cute pictures tbh

You literally pinged me while I was viewing their pixiv profile

Why what's the problem?
For real tho I don't play genshin
Why not?
Not like actually piss poor, just relatively speaking consiedering they saved the world 4 times over
They are probably getting piss poor rates because they are almost all still going to school
They are so proud of it
My exact thoughts

MEAT DAY
She turned around to face you, and just realized the way the chair is squishing her boobs
<:MariaBliss:688836867390439585>
I AM AMONG MY PEOPLE


Reminder that final DMJii attack is called SCISSOR LOVE
<:ElsaSmug:688429724443213903>
<:MikuGay:336656810788388864>
I was wondering why the hell was she holding banana like this
<:MikuPraise:585839808765493249>
Gimme the cute
<:MariaCute:741050161098129499>
I think so
I can't find the picture I am looking for, but here's the picture of what I want my Santa to look like
Have some handholding too
When Kirika and Chris hear there's ghost
<a:KirikaUpset:688429724221046872>
I told you to go to <#336297808221044736>
And in my humble opinion both Kirika and Shirabe ar- wait I can't make that joke here
I don't necessarily think it's "who's the most top", I think it's more like rock paper scissors
Too easy, no points
Lol
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
Go to <#336297808221044736> stat
I'm too horny for beating around the bush
Also obligatory "Whoops, wrong chat"
Is there any gear out there who can top Miku?

3_skip
<:MariaBliss:688836867390439585>
OH WAIT THERE IS MORE AAAAAAAAAAAA
Have some Tusbasa fulffing her little criminals
Is that a threat?
Is
Oh hey, that's you
Definitely not a single Miku x Kirika tho, so at least I got that going
Hilariously, the only picture I found

That's because Hibiki is bottom as fuck, second only to Chris
Okay looks like not as rare ship as I thought it was consiedering it found its way into The Folder‚Ñ¢Ô∏è at least 3 times
Hold up
I have the only picture with Shirabe and Hibki
What? No.
~~Not that I'm particularly eager to see it~~
Jokes aside for the amount of Kiribikki and Shiramiku there is, I'm surprised there's basically none Shirabikki and Kirimiku
<:GermainAngry:689199996653928451>
Fenny did you leak my ship generator?

<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>

Can you describe the experiment to greater detail?
She's watching with great interest an experiment happening in front of her and projecting scenarios that could follow
Because you are horny

Chris wearing a leopard
<:KirikaPlease:730107672455544873>
You can go ahead, I would write it in different format anyway
Is this "when two too nice people meet" bit?
I don't engage in emote comics
Just kidding, feel free
<:HibikiDespair:688429715450757206>
Wait, I wanted to do that
They definitely do not leave with Chris because in one shinai Kirika ask Shirabe why Chris always comes to them to hang out
I don't believe Maria actually "lives" in one apartment with DMJii ~~but I like to think she does because it gives me pretext to write DMJii finding Maria's alcohol~~ I mean wait, what
...except Maria never actually sleeps there because agenting and all that jazz
Either that or a shared apartment with Maria
I think KiriShira have their own like dorm
<:MariaChuckle:672465496515411984>
Ah yes, Chris, the patient one
Wouldn't you be patient if you had to deal with those cute sugar cubes?

Not this one but you have to see it too
I think I have 1 (one) picture of HbMk in my collection

Oh man, that looks super cute

Now give me some cute KiriShira pics
<:ChrisCharge:586320496346529792>
But the point is that I didn't necessarily just snatch them from your pile
A lot of them probably
Okay well, I admittedly don't remember the sketch
<:TsubasaNote:689554460044820608>
<:ShirabeMad:688188118087499792>
And none of these are Star's
That said I have 2k+ to my name
~~Half of it *is* Kerrik's so it isn't as much as you think~~
3_skip But otherwise...
I could never be this orderly with art
<a:ShirabeSob:725756411312734228><a:KirikaSob:725756440463147048>
So many HibiMiku I'm jelous
She hugs Miku so hard her clothes are coming off

It's like a sweet potato
<a:MariaSparkle:688839288082792462>
<a:KirikaUpset:688429724221046872>
I see KiriShira but no ping
Nya
You double encrypt your hard drive and nobody will ever know what kind of degenerate shit you have on it <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Also this
This is art, I want to *look at it*, not own it
But like
I understand well the value of having physical thing that I can, I dunno, display and look at from time to time
Yeah, it occupies real space, which I don't have to spare
But eyy guess what they don't make digital because fuck you!
Like digital I could actually be bothered to skirt around to get
There's also the fact that I don't exactly want to own physical copies as well
Yeah it probably mostly feels that way because of paranoia but still
<a:KirikaTears:777961002335469570>
So
Getting these is risky even *before* you account for how difficult they are to get
<:KirikaSad:666052894935613443>
No
Hbmk really is the first and last thing in your day, huh? <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>

smh <@!430379754190012426> telling he'll post HibiMiku and then he doesn't

<:KirikaWink:689564310908960900>
I mean, where did you think I got your address from?
I also live with family, but this is actually work releated
And I'm in a very fortunate situation where people *will* ask me what I'm buying which is splendid :15min:
Having to explain anyone what I'm buying is not gonna be fun whether it's legal or not
But like, the thing is, laws are one thing
Poland
Too much hassle for something that could get me in trouble
So yeah, long story short
If I ever buy one that I actually wanna read, I'd have to "destroy" it for the ability to do so
Really that's yet another thing about physical douijins
If you have digital, it's easier to do shit with it
I mean, another thing is that
That's fucking mood
<:SerenaDizzy:736605371912945736>
But there is *also* a language barrier which makes me straight up unaware that these are an option
I'd look into that
I should really play around with those fancy disk manipulations one day, I have 2 disks just kinda lying around
Well, FDE is more in the realm of what I meant

No DMJii spawn?
Fair, lol
Because Discord previews are shit <:HibikiBlep:605209109284782090>
Anyway
<a:KirikaWham:738960540126150717>
I just think that as far as features go, checking if there's pixiv or twitter link already in message would be relatively low cost for the convenience it'd give
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
Yet that doesn't negate the point of 3_skip existing in the first place
And I could flip it and say that I could post several 3_skips from one same source and accidentally mix in picture that's not in that set
Then I can edit it when people point it out
<:KirikaShout:607741871703457812>
Well it shouldn't link source again if there is a link to source already in message!
<a:KirikaUpset:688429724221046872>
Because I forgot that you have to 3_skip even if you do provide source
üòî
Oh well, that's one preventable loss of daily limit
It doesn't have to know
Like it won't know if you used 3_skip properly
It won't
<@!263983345669505025> for version 0.2 you should make it so it doesn't search if you include link in the same message as image <:HibikiBlep:605209109284782090>
I posted link and image

With a scene or two occasionally reminding you that it's a thing
The whole concept is just kind of shoved off stage tbh
Which won't stop me from enjoying every single instance of it, I'm just gonna feel guilty about it, personally
It's honestly kind of sad
<:HokmaBless:787120896551682049>
Not for Miku, apperently
Oh yeah, her gear can fly too
She flew there on the wings of love
Exactly, don't get high on hope
Joke?
I too, enjoy living
"I want to be her last victim before justice catches up to her"
What the
Just want to point out that these are not necessarily mutually exclusive
Basically, they want to be smashed by vampire
Working though the stages of grief backwards?
In that case, sure
Milarac just happens to be or appear most violent
I don't think it's fair to, put Elsa and Vanessa out of it, they are all in the same bag
Yeah
I dunno about that
She has new family now
Not like sorting alphabetically would be of any help
More importantly, who's the poor lad that tried to posses Hibiki in AXZ?
Speaking of, what's up with these weird cocoons that appear when something get's possessed by god?
Would she though?
In any case first thing they did after being reawakened was (attempt to) kick NR's asses, not sure if it'd be wise to give one of them power of god
Well, Carol's
They definitely wouldn't want to use Carol's ones because they were
Maybe they couldn't do it like that. Or better yet, maybe Fudo didn't want it that way
You guys can read keywords?
Wait
Thinking that maybe they'll come back with vengeance or something
Or that could be an image of them that Adam had in his head
3 were more prominent, but there were at least 5 ‚òù
There were more than 3 silhouettes
The silhouettes at the end of AXZ?
You can't do that to us
Damn you sketch!
I definitely agree with that assesment
I'm gonna need some context for these screens
Nobody's mad about that kind of overexposition
I agree with that assessment
They just kind of exist afterwards, to the point when even scenes that are focused on them feel like they are only to emphasize that they exist
Because people with taste like yours (or in this case with taste at all) will appreciate it
You see, the camera angle and lighting make it so abs don't cast shadow so you can't see them
For purposes of this question, Phonic Gain counts as dreams

Kerrik like derrick without c
I am 90% sure it was satire but that brilliant catastrophe made me a little exited
There was this post on subreddit where someone brought up 4kids fun dub
That's the spirit
Not really because keywords mention all of Europe governments dissolving with explicit exception of Greece
I would need to look up on it but I'm pretty sure EU still exists in Symphogear at the beginning (Since it's referred as Europe as whole when talking about Durandal?)
Over the course of less than a year too
In Symphogear lore, apparently economy of Europe crashes so hard the the whole continent dissolves
I have a bone to pick
Because
No it's not
Literally anything could happen to US
I reserve my right to not voice opinion on that matter
That is a fine choice
Nah, we'll be fine
We are figuratively living in a future and it's just a little bit disappointing
I don't think I internalized yet that first 5th of a century is going to pass in next year

Is 2045 really so soon?
What do you mean Ryoko is 10?
Heavensrend is a slick name in the void
But I guess the topic is over anyway, HELL YEAH ANAND
Eh, I don't know what proper place is
Now that I'm saying it out loud, the biggest problem here (for me) seems to be non-specificity of situation
How do you let things go out of hand this hard?
That is interesting theory but still
Like, you'd think this would be the last thing to happen in case of crisis
What puzzles me is what kind of economic collapse would need to happen for Governments to lose their grip over countries
They are used to it; anyway
They seem to be in better place
I don't know what these lads are taking but I want a cistern of it
It nade her eyes pretty
Adam was before humanity tho
Only the part that houses 100% of relic's functionality survived, how convenient
That's what I *love* about the series, after 5 seasons I still don't know how anything works at all
Do you think if Fine just swung Durandal towards the moon, would she be able to cut it in half?
That would be a smart thing to do
Just leave it so gears can take it with even less resistance?
What else would she do with Durandal tho?
All I'm seeing are excuses!
To be fair, it's not like he has many places to soap opera in
If this place were to fall apart it would've already done that
Most people don't watch specials and the main series is already over
Probably not tho
We're gonna be very sad
Not with that attitude, no
My name is Chris, actually
Just move to Japan and you have free pass on giving your kids weeb names

Hmmm? <:Ver:336656981144109066>
You little what?
You misspelled Vermin
Eh, I wouldn't necessarily say that
Hey, I'm personally looking forward to it
Perhaps Kerrik meant ending of XV spoiler policy and releasing ancient evil that is yourself onto all common channels?
It didn't work <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
Ver also got to be in OP
Apart from it needing 2 movies to be done properly, I think s1 could use some refreshing
Why not?
Why not just sell exclusive goodies?
But who the hell goes to watch them?
I mean, duh
Why do they make money though?
What would you fit in half a season?
How long are anime movies usually, like half season?
What would the movie be like though?
As long as there's something to look forward to

Tsubasa's amalgam ·µÉ‚Åø·µà ·µê·µÉ ≥·∂¶·µÉ'À¢
Why, she was in duet with Tsubasa
It's almost a shame it's not explored further
Oh yeah, that's a great idea
Ok
They were
I just realized, I have no reference for how well Ver is liked because of all the memes that flood the talks about him
That's demonstrably false because recaps exist /s
But like, s1, the original one, is not going to go anywhere
They are two different/separate methods of summoning a god
What if, the ressurection via vambrace is completely unreleated to resurecrion via lifting curse?
(Which kind of builds on what I said earlier but)
Back to the previous topic, I have a fascinating theory
It's likely very much what happened
Therefore NR would've rigged the thing in such a way that she would wear it when awakened
Wasn't the idea to summon Shem-Ha in a robe (in order to control her later)?
Shem-ha isn't literally sealed in vambrace, otherwise she wouldn't've been fake-awakened by Apple
I would say she did come back to life, so to speak, but only briefly because the "network" collapsed afterwards
You do not need to use it when you have fully functional network of people, but you do need it when your hive mind has only 2 neurons
I would say vambrace is like jump wires
I will not let you wallow in your own wrongness üò†
I was under an impression that the only reason why Shem-ha needed bracelet to posses someone was because curse wasn't broken
Just want to point out that in G moon decided to spontaneously dunk itself into Earth, so I don't think real life physics would've had much impact on the story
They have a right to enjoy the show the way they want
To be fair though
üòè
Pfff, you wouldn't understand what having a friend is like
Nothing can break the bonds of platonic love
That was just a digression, I think
But honestly, also because XV doesn't deliver enough/satisfying closure to warrant a definite ending
Anyway, I actually like how XV ended, partially because what you said, the franchise doesn't really end
That explains a lot
I thought you had access to <#407060923078017026>, was I wrong?
This is the worst timeline
(It's a joke, I'm not gonna do that)
Otherwise I will make you believe I'm dead üòî
Symphogear better does the same
My train of thought <:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
I don't think it's necessarily true that she *needs* both to be true, rather lifting the curse after being resurrected would serve as a power boost
Obviously since NR isn't exactly in position to blow up moon (again), they'd try the first one
Method 2: Posses someone's body
Method 1: You lift curse of Balal, simple, but not exactly easy as evidenced many time in series
The instructions on how to resurrect Shem-Ha go like this:
I mean, there isn't much to add
I mean, a "god", but my point stands
Think about it Aria
They have triple bath scene in manga
Hell yeah brother
C'mon cowards, do it
I will only change opinion if they make S1 remake
Oh yeah, because that's where most people go for lore
What
But otherwise, who cares?
I mean, I kinda get it, the straight Symphogear doujins are a travesty and waste of effort that could be used on some quality yuri
But like, who cares?
Even if that way is completely idiotic <:TsubasaSmug:585839805737467920>
We gotta send this channel off with a bang
Is there any place you can read about 3.5?
Speaking of
[Covers ears with hands] I can't hear you!
For my own peace of mind, I'm gonna pretend XDU doesn't exist
Ikxi you fool ü§£
He's pointing at himself
2nd Eppy has ShiriKiri duet <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
That is a very scary thought tbh
No pressure
Every single mistake you make here now will be remembered
This is your best chance to become part of the history
This channel is gonna be archived
What's the first think you're gonna do with your freedom?
Hey, some didn't realize it in that time
Any moment now
<:HibikiHug:620080558462205956>
Hey Ikxi
I was here
But it's still here
Lunar mares also have freaking amazing names
Did you know that people on southern hemisphere see the moon upside down?
I mean, it's closing on winter and nights are longer than days
This is gonna be a long night
See you on the other side, sharpshooter
Oh, sounds like it's time for a bedtime story!
Bet that's where Melua keeps her secrets
LUL
The end of an era
I'm looking forward to season XXIV and half
He's right, you know ‚òù
Did you forget about short, indefinite hiatus after EP13? <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
Any moment now
Nobody remembers anymore what started this tradition
People of Symphogear discord server gather on <#431914167826382860> channel to celebrate its closure
It's year 2045
So I guess we party?
It's morning and it's still open
Well, all's in order then
Oh yeah, I can't count, can I?
Saki gave you 350 and you still had only ~120 more than me lol
So where did 671 came from?
There

What's the starting amount of money?
Are you getting cards over PM?
There, like this

How long the 128 <:Kiricoin:495336831978569759> is going to be up?
It *would* bother me if you were going to change it back to 75, but if it stays 72, it's fine to be 72
Everybody getting 3 coins less sounds like a mean birthday gift
I don't get it
Hey, btw why is daily now 72 Kiricoins instead of 75?
rv_pull "Happy Birthday Kiri!" 44
Pardon me
rv_pull "Happy Birthdess to you, dess!" 44
I've done it
Oh my God
haHAA
<:KirikaPanic:644235681677180958>
I pulled 98 cards and I have to name all of them?
Oh no
Oh my God
Okay, so having done that, what happens now?
Indeed
rv_pull "Happy Birthday, Shirabe!" 82
And you do the command like
So, a pull is 100
Oh my
<:MikuBliss:336657233712513024>
<:TsubasaPeek:623246193002151938>

Hello?
Hello, may I acquire assistance?
That's all I needed to know
Cool
From the same gatcha as last used?
But what do you do with these extra pulls?
Also, how do bonus pulls work?
I'm asking more in terms of practicallity
How many pulls are too many?
Can I yeet cards?
<:ShirabeChibi:698939825155473499>
Didn't expect to see Tsubasa
I dunno, I got that in Kirika gatcha
Excuse me? <@!102691114762371072>
See you in hell

Oh!
I swear, there was a mention of universal tokens somewhere <:MikuWorry:672908523495227432>
Hmpf
rv_help
As in buying with tokens is, but not token conversion
Yeah, pff, cool, but it doesn't say anything about it
(ping me with answer)
Is there token conversion here?
For the feeling of *power* obviously
Yeah, most democracies have hundreds of parties, just only few ever get to have voice in governing
Radical is not a descriptor of world view in the same sense as conservative tho
Especially if you have opposing opinions
"No don't"
People who prefer holding up traditions and generally things staying how they are
The thing about political issues is that they are usually bad and affect whole country
I do wonder how they are gonna react to that
Just let us have our safety bubbles gosh darnet
Not that I think you should be crucified for playing it, it's a nice middle ground solution; but still I think it's worth being aware that there's little more going into games than money
Funny you mention Overwatch because that's the exact kind of game that relies the most on players playing it
Just a small tidbit of trivia to keep your anxiety up
Do note that even if you have already paid for games prior, in case of online games you are still actively supporting Blizzard by contributing to keeping their communities alive
That was definitely the wrong way to handle it
However I do understand the idea of keeping controversial (political?) topics out of tournaments and it does makes me wonder what the hell is supposed to be right recourse here
Sounds so much better /s
Weren't we just trying to find solution do global warming?
I mean, yeah, to be fair it's not quite as bad as I thought initially, but still, what the hell
It blew my fucking mind when I learned that in US you can lose voting rights for felonies
If think if somebody wanted tho shoot place down, they would surely find some way to bring gun in, even more so if they knew in advance that bags are checked
It's probably better to say that people *have* guns for other reasons than hunting people
He isn't talking about guns, he's talking about going to school
It's first time I heard you could get arrested for that
No Yorin, why wouldn't that be great?
Or perhaps you meant mention in constitution and whole culture build around it?
What do you mean, the countries that have gun ownership literally do give its citizens right to own guns \:P
It's why they are suggesting keeping guns to gun ranges
?
Well, if nobody saw you and the teachers are competent, there should be no problem
Wasn't the verification system also supposed to be outsourced to 3rd party?
That's good, right?
That makes it all the less valid source of concern
I would think Nintendo operates globally
Which is not cancelling pre-orders
Not cancelling pre-orders, the opposite of it
Hold up, isn't that illegal?
Understatement of the century
What a convenient timing
Did you notice that he joined server 15 minutes ago?
Radical
Anime characters are still people in certain sense as opposed to, for example a beartrap
Wouldn't go as far as to say don't use it, but you should probably not refer to people like that
You really don't feel negative tone of the word?
Yeah, how could one possibly think that comparing people to a device or plot, the purpose of which is to trick, decieve or hurt someone would be insensitive?
M could stand for minors
They literally couldn't do that
I dunno, beats me
And it's actually 5 words
The key word is made for consumption by lesbians
In a way though, porn is shaped by demand
I mean, if that makes them happy?
And who are they to talk, they can have sex whenever they like
You know, when you say it out loud it does sound kinda weird to watch people have sex
Don't let me tell you how to live your life
Or don't
Tell us about it
Because it's a sin, duh
Child porn in and of itself is pretty distinct and established term
There's more than one?
Nice in non memey meaning of the word?
Although, porn for woman does also sound, eh, comfortable?
Indeed
I guess guns are quite a bit more scary than ants
Yeah, ants are scary
Just why
Some people going out of they way to step trans people on toes
I don't even get this
You on the other hand have as much fun as you'd like
I like that
LGBT people are scary, alright?
Sounds about right
To be fair though, the guy might not have necessarily go "Well, that's it, I'm gonna murder a man"
Oh yeah, classic US
Sounds familiar
I don't quite believe you can get threatened with weapon for buying sweets, even in US
Convincing someone that what they thought happened, didn't happen (and vice versa)
Although I do want to know how Secondary school me managed to get into group project with 3 girls
That would mean you are going backwards \:P
Well
If you didn't find yourself few years back to be a moron
Generally speaking I wouldn't say views here are that varied
It sounds blatantly like "I didn't see what I expected to see" if you catch my drift
Well, I'll never look at transuranium elements the same way
It can't be a valid defence if you say "But I thought they were gay", can it?
When is it actually applicable, I wonder?
I mean, like any adjective
That will teach 'em
üëâ üëâ
Joke's on you because those who use it are not people
Quite
Narcissism is not quite the same as having inherent bias towards your beliefs
I think you are ok
Well, too bad because I'm about to tell you my opinion of you
That's oddly specific thing to say
\*Makes some incomprehensible hand gestures\*
Ah fuck, I leave for one hour and
Oh my
What did they screw up with the movie?
The bill is also a present
I, for one, am looking towards the 2020 elections
Hold up, you mean after impeaching president the elections wouldn't happen ASAP?
My humble European opinion is that if Trump hadn't fucked it up yet, I can't really see anyone fucking it up
Nothing straightens you up quite like PTSD, amirite?
Kirichan why
That's monkey's paw shit right here
Nice
I'm also referring to Yon's comment
Which World War?
I would imagine that's most likely to happen
Well, what is that reality then?
We could very well be first ones to stand that so called test of time
This cannot be proven, because a civilization that had "stood test of time" has to exist right now
That's pretty fatalistic view, tbh
Though maybe I don't know full scope, but I think India and Pakistan could have undisturbed, full spectrum war
I also want to point out that you seem to imply world war, but that may not necessarily happen
I also do think that the best way to use nukes is just to *have* them
If the assumption is that we are all nuked, then we are fucked by definition
Politics sure are complicated, but when your very *existence* is at stake, pacts don't hold as much weight anymore
You could apply the same argument to assumption that one nuke will *inevitably* cause full on nuclear world war
I say the deal's off!
At least if I were a county, I wouldn't want to be on either side of nuclear conflict
I don't think that would necessarily be true either
I mean, MAD is certainly a thing, but it's not all that exists
I don't have anything against a bit of humor once in a while
You know, fair point
You could also be struck by ball lightning and that doesn't seem to particularly worry you
Nobody uses any nukes primarily because nobody needs to
I'm gonna go ahead and say the chances of nukes being fired by anything but human are pretty none
They literally won't explode on their own
But it's the mankind that has nukes, not the world \:P
It's in nobody's interest to end the world
and get this
It's not inconceivable that "only few" nukes will be used because,
I mean are, it's an idea that exists
Salted nukes are a thing too
They might've been a thing since 80s, but how come I only heard of them recently?
Human ingenuity truly knows no bounds!
Apparently there are now shotgun nukes
But it's fun to theorize about
Not in practical sense, no, that's helluva not fun
Anyway, nukes are fun
I still could imagine scenario where only one or couple of nukes are fired
<bassboost>But</bassboost>
Yeah
I mean, alright, I guess we actually agree on the matter
But the thing is, in that case why are we even discussing this <:HibikiWhat:336656482907193344>
And sure, if stars align for nuclear apocalypse, it will obviously happen
But my point is that using one nuke doesn't necessarily mean nuclear apocalypse
For instance, what if Pakistan used all their nukes?
I mean, we can continues that convo of whataboutism for a while
Eh
Since they would be in ruins after such war and likely in need of aid of some sort
I still don't think it'd matter though
But if they did?
That's just asking to be nuked yourself
Why would EU, US or China want to jump into the hypothetical nuclear convo between India and Pakistan?
Nukes are scary
I don't think it may be a case in nuclear warfare, because, well
Even if everybody decides to not have them, it only serves as advantage for those who violate agreement
You do not want find yourself to be one without nukes
Actually, I think they are talking about what we *do not* want to hear
Okay, now that's a better explanation
And now I'm confused
I thought the discussion was going more in direction of "Soldiers fighting in city, throwing tiny nukes like they are hand grenades"
So if they are just regular nukes with fancy names, what's the problem? <:HibikiWhat:336656482907193344>
Even less so "Hand Grenade"
My point is that the word "Grenade" doesn't invoke an image of regular ass nuke with a pin
Look
You *do* need to arm bombs
What's the functional difference between grenade that needs to be dropped/deployed and a nuclear bomb?
Then it's not a grenade üò†
The amount of fissile material to cause nuclear explosion would be too heavy to toss like a hand grenade
Nuclear Hand Grenades are like actually impossible tho, I'm pretty sure
Shotgun nuke: You put dozen of small nukes in one warhead and release spread them over target before it hits
Nuclear Hand Granades sounds like something that could never work
Depend on how many contenders for the spot are
You will blow their doors right off the handles
Well, stay safe and try not to die
Alright
Why not lock door first?
Hearing anything?
Are you home?
Whew lad, what a read
At least not right away
We can't though
Nah, that's still in the realm of science fiction
But it probably won't
It might, that's the thing. We don't know because it hasn't been invented yet
I mean
And the conclusion was anywhere between 0 and all
Where's over here?
I figure
I am going to need you to unpack what non-driving state photo IDs is
But the IDs, what about IDs?
It sounds more like the whole thing is void because it doesn't contain your name anymore, if that's what you mean
How long is it valid in US, is the timeframe at least reasonable?
So anyway, that's kind of fucked up that you need to pay for ID
It's a bit broken Polish but most will understand
Poland
While almost certainly the passports here come at a price, IDs are free
That blows my mind
I don't even want to listen about US anymore lol
To be fair, I don't know how voting works in UK
Since dead people usually don't show up for vote
With ID it doesn't need to know that for a fact
Still though, you couldn't have a valid ID of a dead person, I'd assume
How else are you supposed to prove that you are, you know, you?
Why tf wouldn't you?
Wait, you mean you *don't* need ID to vote in UK?
My favorite argument when government paying for anything in general is brought up, btw
~~Actually, they are paid for by the taxes you pay~~
Yes
In fact I am referring to these as the IDs because I wasn't aware that something like this is such a foreign concept it doesn't have an English word for it \:P
AFAIK these are mandatory here, even though you can use other documents as ID
Federations are complicated <:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
Okay, but then how the voting machine verifies  that vote is valid?
I'm just saying, fingerprint scanning on voting machine would give me a pause
Is voting not anonymous?
If your voting system didn't account for that for some reason, I'd be sure it would be abused
It's outdated because we take precautions in our systems that prevent that
Although I personally think scanning paper ballots would be safer than what India has
There is no more innate risk from machine counting than there is from manual counting
How?
Poll staff???
I've been tinkering about voting systems for couple of weeks recently, while India has already worked one out
Well I'll be damned
What happens to it?
That's not what I mean, I mean the paper that you get with confirmation that you voted (and on who)
Maybe one thing that strikes me is that copy of receipt isn't kept at polling place
Voting in India sounds pretty sweet, ngl
They have a cash cow that is their sports section
~~Inb4 what's the difference~~
Nah, I'm pretty sure they are just running short on braincells
The problem is that they tried both simultaneously and subsequently failed at both
The problem here is not that they made a game rooted in history or really that they tried to be inclusive
It's EA, you wouldn't understand
It's somewhat difficult to write a new story in game that's rooted in history
Wasn't there a drama about historical accuracy?
23 June 2016, that's over 3 years, isn't it?
Short answer: too long
I was under an impression that the whole thing is already on fire
So that's it on my part, good luck \:D
Besides that my best advice is: Don't get hit
Generally speaking I think lying is not a very good idea, rather you want to be honest in a way that puts you in good light
EA bad
Witcher good
But tbh I couldn't give better answer because I don't see how watching athletes is fun to begin with
Depends on discipline
And acting like there is nothing inconspicuous about it
Imagine athlete coming to the Olympics in fucking power armor
Especially old-school external ones
But I feel like cybernetics would be quite easier to prove
Pretty much
And probably too expensive
They are just not very practical
I mean, physical enhancements already exist
Because I honestly doubt they'll set in fast enough to cause much moral issues
What kind of enhancements are we talking about again?
Eh
They most definitely won't
Most sports don't necessarily require said competition to be physically beaten on the spot
They can set some new sick records while waiting for competition
That's their problem tbh
I don't think it's likely that enhanced people will be allowed in regular leagues first
The size of said city should be counter argument by itself, tbh
<:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
It's a large city
Central Statistical Office
It's population density, you take population density, multiply by population and you get the area
There, I fixed it
That city would have diameter of 1565.562km
According to my calculations, if we all lived in one small city with same population density as the city I live in
Indeed, but hygiene did
That was also a time when black plague wiped out 3rd of the Europe
Nobody measures population per volume because population per volume is useless ~~on scale of maps~~ period
The most optimal way to use that volume would be to add additional floor... Which would double the area of my room
If my room was twice the height from floor to ceiling, that's twice the volume, with the same area. However, I wouldn't be able to make any use of that additional volume
I mean
It is but population density is still calculated on area, and we need to calculate how many stories we'd need to house people
Alright, so how big would be space occupied by single person?
Of course it'd need to build up, but this allows to indirectly calculate how much
Counterpoint: Area is better indicator because at the end it's the only (two) dimension of space that's limited
A city fitting in 69km diameter would have over 2mln inhabitants per square kilometer
Here's another fun number:
Well, I mean, I think that's quite literally the case now
Okay, end that stream of consciousness and think, at which point population density would be so high that people would start to smell?
I forgive you :>
I was just trying to say something interesting tangential to the topic at hand <:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
And I mean it literally, I can't find any mention of rules for this chat :p
Nowhere does it say that megacity math or bad hygiene don't belong here
600km in diameter
For instance city with density of Manhattan would be only...
It wouldn't have, I just picked random number for fun
I mean, it is releated in a sense that the higher population density, the worse condition are all around, including smell probably
Someone's gonna keep you on your toes
Not to this point directly
I entered my calculation into Wolfram Alpha and it returned chemical formula for LSD xD
I can't even figure out how to calculate population per volume for sake of my counterpoint
No, this is stupid
Goddammit, I already made mistake in calculation <:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
What do you think of when I say 1000 people per 1 cubic kilometer?
Alright
Because they tell you slightly different things
At least I think it'd be actually easier to count stories and then make out volume out of that
But I won't calculate it \:P
Fine
It might be, but in both cases it's a living area available to me
I can't put a cupboard on ladder <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
I would need to make another floor, which would subsequently double the area
That's what I'm saying, if my room were twice as high, it would be waste of space because I can't make any use of that additional space
Then the area is still more important
When you look for a house, it will also give you total floor area, regardless of how many levels or how much area on ground it takes
Well, they don't, they all measure area on ground because that's the only spatial measurement that matters
We know how much area on ground we can take, and if we figure out how much floor area a person needs, we can figure out how many floors we'd need
More or less
And population per volume is measure of, well, overpopulation, crowdness
So at the end, occupied volume is just glorified population
It is, but each person living in skyscraper will occupy similar volume to, say a person who lives in small house
Well, I'd say fuck aliens
Why should we bother to calculate something impractical in the first place if aliens are perfectly capable of doing it themselves?
What if they ask us *how* we use that space?
Then tell them the area, number of stories and story height, they came all the way here, they probably can do arithmetic
The whole idea of 69km city is not very practical to begin with
I calculated it btw, it's 1 333 333 people per cubic kilometer
3, 2, 1 GO
4000 people per 1 square kilometer with assumption that floor is 3 meter tall
Then why won't you do it yourself? <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Nobody uses population per volume because it's too complicated to calculate
Okay, I have counterpoint
Just to be told that indeed it does not have any
The problem is that I spent last hour trying to argue if population per volume is a statistic with any practical use
We stopped with population per area of a city that's 69km in diameter (That's about 2mln per km2) and we went pursuing this volume thing before figuring out how high would such city need to be
Indeed
We don't know yet, is the thing
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
More relevant point is that if it's just trivia piece, then it isn't really relevant when calculating practical parameters of megacity
They came all the way here, which means they are immune to boredom
That is fine, but then again, things we do for fun are not necessarily useful for aliens
All I'm saying is area and number of stories is more meaningful than volume
What an outlandish question
I won't give you city, I don't own it <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
If I'll tell you my city, you gonna find my house and put catnip on me while I'm asleep
Do New York for starters
I legit got dizzy from all the maths
Population: Everyone
Anyway, the numbers (<@183785454447886346>): 69km diameter, 2mln people per 1km2, height is yet unknown
If there is something I can figure out with population per volume, I can probably figure it our with population per area and stories, which are more intuitive to use
Yeah, that's what I'm saying
As long as Home Alone is still played, all's well
I don't think they could kill an *art style*, if they were determined to do so
I can guarantee you that no corporation effectively owns any country
What does "effectively owned" mean?
No, I don't think so
I would be. Countries would not let a company just get more control than a country has
You know it
The thing is, for some people this is not a bad idea at all. For vast majority, sure, but some people can benefit on brexit and these people are biggest supporters of it
Unless you are tying to build business on brexit, brexit is not good for business
You just now realized?
There is only so much long term planning you can (and need to) do
That's good
If everyone thought your way Nara, nothing would ever get done
What really gets me about that one is that, somehow, the permanence in the word "delete" didn't strike that guy
IIRC tickets were sold long before the drama started
If you bother them too much, you'll end up squandering all good will towards you
There is an equilibrium in how much you can bother people
Quite dumb reaction if you ask me
I know, it's just
It's not like there is a shortage of games to serve as alternatives nowadays
Which is the second thing that gets me about guy in picture above
Tell us about it
Lowercase god implies that it is somehow lesser, which I find quite unfitting if you are talking about *the* universe
Does it matter?
You could also argue that I am God
I did say "as far as popes go"
But Francis is quite nice, as far as popes go D:
I mean
What kind of pronouns are you using that they'd give away that you are trans?
It might not be black and white, but certainly you can't reject the most important part of belief and say you are still part of it
But then, they are not Christian
Could you elaborate Attacker?
If Christianity is not religion, what is?
Well, I think they are wrong
I don't think that's what defines religion
At what point does it stop being religion and start being a set of traditions?
So what?
That's interesting
And it expands faster than speed of light
You mean edge of observable universe
It doesn't matter
Nah, I think everybody things like that initially
"Radical feminists" invokes a little different image in my head than "Rad fems"
I have to say though
I'm rad
Terf sounds aggressively like some kind of soil
It was called in for sake of argument <@!302063351767498752>
The part about believing in and loving God... is literally called The Greatest Commandment
I too am confused about what I meant by homosexual relationships
I mean, I *did* literally just say it
So you are saying I should be able to say it or not?
Conversely, I can say I believe in LGBT ideas, expect for the part about homosexual relationships
So how the hell would I know that?
But nobody uses fluid correctly
Or rather, now that I look at it, they aren't
<@183785454447886346> Thing is, in my language for example they are synonyms
Fluids adhere to the shapes of their containers, while liquids additionally have free surface
Fluid is wider category than liquid
It is not
My point still stands however, gendersuperfluid sounds more badass
That's true but I still mixed them up \:P
Oh shit, I mixed up fluid and liquid
And also badass
Gendersuperfluid would be more accurate
Genderfluid is a very odd choice of word, considering that fluids confine to the shape of vessel that contains them
It's like having perpetual existential crisis limited exclusively to gender
It's two words
Duh
Can we turn reactions back on here so I can ‚òù Anand?
> It could mean a lot of shit
I didn't do my homework and if my teacher checks it, I'm gonna be in fluid
That of coarse is killing me
The purpose of words is to convey information, and if they are used in way that's not effective, they are used wrong
But they do
This is a horrible reason to disregard a term that has scientific definition
But
I agree
Whoa, where did the air conditioning come from?
It already revolves around me
Yeah, the world can't revolve around you
Here's time for real serious question
Unless you are not real of course
No need to get upset
Is Kerrik real?
I mean, present definitely exists
More like, the past
Not history like historical records
Is history real?
It's called prehistory because the drugs werent invented yet
Holy shit
100th story
Ow, now I feel real bad :(
(I'm sorry Aria)
Is Aria real? She seems like filament of your imagination existing for purpose of making you feel bad
You don't get to choose when you get a meltdown <:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
Okay, so do I exist or not?
ü§î
Wait, we can't be both protagonists
I'm Chris
Yes
This does not match my experience
Your girlfriend approaches you in a suit, with a formal hat and monocle, kisses your hand and passes you a scented letter
Would it not be odd to you if they asked you formally?
In other words, I agree
It's only weird idea if you have no one close enough to send nudes to <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
That's it, archive the channel <@!99695384296701952>
If I say dess here will Kirichan be able to react?
How about voice? What's it like when you imagine your friend calling you (from off-screen)?
What about imagining someone you never saw?
Weird
And it's identical to the previous one in which it's you instead?
Is this like a visual image?
Because, now that I thought about it, I couldn't
Can you imagine a stand in for yourself, from 3rd person, sitting where you are now?
I mean, fair enough
But it's fascinating
Mhm, yeah, I wouldn't say it's pleasant
You should try it
Is it like watching your own reflection in mirror for too long?
Can you imagine yourself right now from  3rd person perspective?
What about imagining yourself?
Huh, that's weird
What way would you not find odd, or how would you ask for nudes?
Let's put catnip on him while he sleeps
Do you though?
There is a table with glass of water, pair of scissors and rave dice on top, and you sit next to it
Back to the roots, can you imagine yourself in first person?
I'll gladly take the blame for rave dice
:)
Or rather, is it rave because there wasn't specified colour, or did you fancy a rave dice?
Is it explicitly rave or undefined?
O.O
What colour is the dice then?
I assume picturing dice, and rotating it, no problem?
I'm afraid I'm at creative dead end
It's just how I read stuff
Well, new neither, it's the thing
If I'm bantering with, say, Melua, do you read the text in feminine and masculine text, respectively?
What about reading stuff like here?
Can you read things in someone else's voice in general?
Well, I dunno
But can Morgan Freeman narrate it?
So yeah, that's good that you narrate your internal monologue
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
Who narrates your internal monologue?
(Let me also point out the cosmic injustice in the fact that I can imagine throwing chair at *you*, but you can't imagine throwing chair at *me*)
Finally something I can remotely relate to :P
Eh, some hentai artists would beg to differ
But 14s? Screw them!
16-18 is a fair game
The idea of age of consent (including exception from it) exist, from what I understand, to protect underage people from being abused
I believe they are talking about general concept of it, rather than legal
Also Grizz I like the implication that being pedo or not depends on your physical location lol
(This map may be misleading btw)
Why is it?
Case in point lol
Aria, that's missing the point though
<@!99695384296701952> What you mean basically is the idea that mature character in immature body is not cool, am I reading it right?
Read it up, it's a fun topic üôÇ
You can convey some things about character, but they are still rooted in appearance. **Age is not rooted in appearance**
<@!189146272865845248> If it is not necessarily true, you have to agree that there are instances where lewding 1000 year old loli with 8 year old body is fine
WYSWIG
Thing is, a drawing in and of itself, does not have anything to it bar appearance
I would like to draw parallel to reality, but I'm worried you'd take it backwards
I mean, once again, if they can't consent because they are not real, they can't be hurt or abused, because they are not real
Is that it?
(Not the man)
Well, if they can't consent because they are not real, they can't be hurt or abused, because they are not real
In art age itself is a volatile concept, without even mentioning that there is (usually) no one to be protected
Especially the connection between personal computers and bad stories
I think it was reasonably stalkery, given her condition
https://www.reddit.com/r/aww/comments/dtimb4/groom_31_bride_30_both_have_growth_hormone/
Speaking of that discussion, I found something oddly relevant on reddit
With a caveat that what you are likely talking about *did not* elude me, and you are right to be wary of it
I want to say that I disagree with your view
I can keep naming them one by one, there were only 6 people in this conversation \:P
Who do you mean Aria? Grizz?
One reaction, dess
Well, good night
No point in going to bed anymore, keep talking
Nice
Wot
NSFW labels are more of a common courtesy unless specified otherwise, but you'd still need to be brain dead to think that posting NSFW content just anywhere is fine
He might've meant in general as in generally speaking, not on main channel
Isn't that like stated in ToS of discord?
Follow up, it is not in relation to my comment about age being irrelevant? <@!99695384296701952>
(I imagine a failure of a sequel could actually legitimately have this low scores, but that doesn't apply as much to movies)
But it still felt hamfisted
It's a world building, so I don't think there's anything wrong with Blizzard revealing facts about character outside game
On the contrary, it implies that being artificially inclusive is no redemptive value for work as whole at all
I don't think I ever seen anyone be like "Hey, at least the main character was gay", Kerrik
Is Black Panther a good example here? It did not strike me as artificially inclusive anyhow, and definitely not bad because of it
>Someone just like you
>Doing cool things
Pick one
Horrendous, isn't it? üòè
That would be probably a bad idea indeed
Did you say ok boomer back?
In other words, works as intended
Because that so called ageist slur gives boomers white fever and they have no clue how to word it properly, so they resort to the extremes
> I see this as an absolute win
FTFY
And well, maybe she did in that case, I didn't see it so I wouldn't know
One would think it would be a requirement for actor to at least be able to pass as the character they play with makeup
I do want to point out that whilst reviewer likely used this as cover up, it's not an illegitimate thing to be concerned about
Lol
Just don't go
None of the above is kind of a copout solution to be honest
Go vote you madman
One problem with that is that you have hundreds of thousands machines that you can't do anything with
I don't necessarily think it's bad, but not saving data on ROM is very bad
Don't they also have amazingly calibrated touch screen?
Where is here?
Separationists don't give a fuck <:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
I know that EU would try to stop it
Separationists
Not EU
Like they give a fuck, Cypher
tfw grass is greener on the other side
That's great Mill
Did government parties not get together more support than single highest voted one?
I meant between mandatory vote with NOTA and not mandatory at all
Ah, like this
But it literally doesn't
It isn't necessarily that threats don't work, just you can only throw so much at people before they become indifferent
Mass hysteria leads to people being indifferent because we are screwed anyway, so why bother trying to make things better?
No, it wouldn't
Sure, we can
There aren't any two factions aiming atom bombs at each other nowadays
The world is not in position for a major war
You know what, I'm fucking tired being always the last person to hear about things
But then, think about how many spoons you'd have to throw out to find someone to support you
That's when you get into spoon debt
I'm not very good at being uplifting, I think, but I feel you
Just wanted to let you know that I read it
I'm all ears if you want to
But nobody actually has any actionable advice üôÇ
Once you say you have problems with motivation, like 90% of server will pile on you with "Yeah me too"
The real fun part is
Otherwise, you are **screwed**
Besides that an immediate threat to your well being will get you motivated to do anything
Getting into habit of doing something in spite of not being motivated is a great one
Well, I have two things for you Sketch
(That gif actually looks a lot more painful than I remembered)
Extremely relatable
Oh yeah, that's relatable
Hot take: The only thing keeping EU from actually being nation is individual nations claiming that it is not a nation
Americans before shedding the tea cocoon
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
Means the coup was successful
<@183785454447886346> Is that a joke about how shitty US social is again?
<:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
But keeping thread alone for me is extraordinarily hard
I kinda wish to keep discussing this
Wait, it's over already?
It's worth to point out that left/right division comes from western countries, so
I mean, yeah, the outlook onto the politics will differ based on the situation in the country
But like, proper centrists are not nazi apologists
Yeah yeah, The Holy Bible too states that if you are lukewarm, God will chew and spew you
There are also the cases when I have views in same category that are not strictly exclusive, but are usually put on opposite sides, mind you
I also seem to be rather centrist
Aw shit, of all questions I didn't expect to get bricked on the one I did
So let's take a shot, shall we?
Every time I take these tests it's like throwing a dart
Who hasn't at this point
Radical
I'll toss mine onto the pile
And do so without being overtly contentious
And yeah, the questions are weird, because the test has to cover full political spectrum, for example both kinds of "Fuck the gay people"
I think the take that these tests are designed to antagonize people is rather reductive
I don't necessarily think that's what the question implies
It goes by quicker than you think
No going back now
I think it is pretty stupid
<:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
For the state you live in is constant depression
But that was a lie
You told us you moved to Pennsylvania
If it doesn't pass you might have serious problem
Usually
It's a temporary feeling
For someone outside their worldview, they are quite passionate about making her life harder
At the end though, you know where you should fall anyway
Problem is that to get something anyhow conclusive you need to use more and more categories
It actually gives completely different results; the economic axis in particular is baffling
Would you mark them as such, or not, Nara?
But what if your videos are not meant to be "family friendly"?
I mean, you get it
The problem is that it doesn't matter whether you mark it or not, if FTC deems your video as such
That's not a problem in an of itself (if I got this right), since you could not mark it as kid friendly and even have more ad revenue from the video
As you say it yourself
Well, yes, but it's not like youtube does it by it's own initiative
And according to this article, now youtube is also forced to step down on ads in videos for children because they can't have targeted ads on them
Ad companies often choose to not provide ads for adult videos, from what I know
Youtube doesn't want to punish anyone
A big problem with any platform that would be a successor to youtube is that platforms like that aren't really profitable on their own
Zaiste, eksplozjonie
I don't think it's that TV can do whatever they want, as much as that they just know already what they can definitely get away with
Well, that's great. Now tell that to FTC
Well, the law demands to not collect data from <13s, but doesn't actually give any means to verify if you are one
Well, ok, 18+ is, I know that
But there is no ID for 13+ teens
It's not like you have any way to prove that, until you are definitely adult with an ID
Not the 13+ ratings tho
Ratings are mostly guidelines and not legally bidding
In which case ratings would not be relevant, but rather what children actually watch
It is also implied that the law requires from youtube that they don't collect data on children under 13
Hence quotation marks
It is implied that the responsibility is not on "children" when they seek videos that are not marked as safe for children, but creators
It totally is backwards lol
Oh yeah, right
Even for US government
I don't think I quite got it though, because that seems completely backwards
Because one could argue that if you are, for example, recording Fortnite, or Minecraft, or hell even do toy reviews targeted for adults, you'd still be actually making videos for kids
See, but the thing is, this is not necessarily the case
Net worth is not all money in the bank though
I loved my fish
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
>Corporates won't try to earn brownie points by marketing being friendly towards marginalized groups.
Sure
Some of these politicians sometimes say so dumb shit, I just can't üòÇ
But for real though
If you turn a blind eye on the fact that you are witnessing your country disassembling itself
Juvenile fun mostly
Politics are fun
That's the worst
History is fun
Polish and Latin <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Which reminds me that in times of Polish-Lithuanian, Commonwealth had two official languages
"Only"
69?
8?
2?
<:TsubasaSmug:585839805737467920>
Yeah, that +5:30 timezone really makes you wonder how India hasn't imploded yet
I SPAWNED YOU!
But like, what does it mean for targeted marketing to be normal?
Come to think of it, it's not like companies actually care who buys their products, for the most part
I see your point, but also *what's the difference?*
What if you are hot and gay people constantly hit on you? /s
Scrmz being <@290431224596660224> ?
On the other hand, the atmosphere is homey
I'm not a person to preach about proper channels, so when I do point it out, move over üòõ
<#336310266654490624>
Anand
Move the geah talk to geah talk channel
Heresy
So I take that's part of the reason why concentration of trans people is so high here
Of course <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
So I take that by being here I made a right choice?
MonkaS
We all figure ._.
I figure solo
<:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
Thankfully I don't need to deal with that!
Fascinating
And I distinctly remember thinking "Welp, Symohogear is done, so now it's either rope or..." before joining
You joined day after me
That had to be already right after last episode though
Oh, I joined only day earlier than Anand
03.10.2019
So
Also, I am here
Looks like we're gonna need to check everyone /s
Who's supposed to be bad here?
I have luxury of living right next to forest
Yeah
And kick trees, if you are angry enough to do that
Breathe some fresh air
Going to forest is great, because you get to be secluded
But also, I'm not angry or otherwise distressed often enough to say it's anyhow regular occurrence
What I do when I'm angry or otherwise distressed is I leave house and go on a walk
Well
No actually, I don't feel like going over that topic, sorry
I'm gonna do you one better
Thank you Ikxi
And I only got greeted by Ikxi
And here I thought D'Hondt screwed us over <:GenjuurouThumbsUp:336657189475188740>
No, why Anand?
How does it work in UK?
You know what, it might be the system
It's more fault of human brains than the system
Tactical question: It wouldn't happen to be the thing you posted here earlier today?
Bold of you to assume what everyone thinks
But being an emotional support can be very draining
That's what confuses me, because "I'm at capacity" sure isn't nicest way to put it
Perhaps a virtual hug can do the trick?
I believe in you, you can do it ‚ù§Ô∏è
Looking nice is nice, but you don't need top fashion clothes for that
Have I told you how much I hate the idea of tight jeans?
That's not too bad
<:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
4, actually, but 2 are for summer
I have like 3 pairs of pants total
It's a good habit
At all
Conversely, you can't really argue that fascism or nazism never existed
Even less welcome than communists
What it really comes down to is that fascists and nazis are not welcome in general
Vers plan wouldn't work because you need way more people to sustain population than fragile boned doctor and Maria
There is also Internet connection on moon
Mostly because Internet exists, and probably will never cease to exist, and this one language would still be somewhat needed to communicate across long distances
On the contrary, I think it'd be much harder to reach than upkeep
But who are you to decide that?
Of course, maybe not every life does
Just because some people don't value their life, doesn't mean that life has no value
That... Sounds odd
Mass Effect style universal translators ate probably closer than one language
In that literal case we'd have no choice but to speak only language left regardless of which one it would be
What snap?
I mean, duh
(also note to you <@115744398997716995>, I did see what you said)
Well, that took a turn üò¶
Like, you'd at least expect that much help, especially since you know they're gonna want to be "proper" grandparents for their kid once the hard work is done
You don't have to full time raise your grandkids, just offer enough support so that the parents can reasonably handle it
I mean, I guess that's fair, but what would be the second thing you'd ask?
That's kind of ruthless
I take that your friend would not accept help of his or his girlfriend's parents?
And he's he?
Plus it'd be mostly for fun
As in something like Civ, but with focus on environment
It would be nice to have a simulation of human impact on environment
The less legitimate reasons to leave you bad reference you give them, the better
Isn't christmas day supposed to be free of work? ü§î
But also, ouch
It's okay
Too real, extremely uncool
<:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
Let's just say that I did end up going on bonus math too, I'm sure you can put the 2 and 2 together here
And I was like "Eh, I dunno, I don't really want to... Who else would be going on these anyway?"
But the teacher saw the potential in me and invited me to these bonus classes
See, I was one of the top math students at the time, the talented, but lazy kind
Like very eh
And the math was like eh
It just so happened that after bonus chemistry there was bonus math
Yes
(Even though it was mostly used for exam paper exercises and such, still pretty cool though)
It was great
Not only it was bonus chemistry, but there was also that girl that was also going on these
It was
Nope
It's just how it is, an interest club is completely alien prospect
We don't have interest clubs, the best you could count on were bonus chemistry classes
But for me, it wasn't even like I *ever* knew them in the first place
Anyway, for some reason literally (not literally) everyone in school knew me, even though I didn't know anyone
Just say you are in second year <:ChrisOi:586551700987576330>
It's just like the first year of my secondary school
What's happening Voy? It sounds like a horrendous roller-coaster
You can be conservative and not be a shitbag, Anand <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
How come you and everyone you know and every community you are in says they'll vote against X yet X still gets majority government ü§î
Neat
(I'm gonna go to bed, will read the rest in the morning)
Okay, now that starts feeling a bit too real for me
Still, I figure it's much better without it, isn't it?
I see
What happened?
So uh
Duh?
I mean
Just
Well, as much as I may complain, at least my government isn't Trump level bad üòè
The bad guys
Paraphrasing reddit comment, at this point even popcorn stopped tasting good
Wait, what happens with it?
I think getting someone decent into government would be a good start
Run while you still can
Just run
I'm surprised you hadn't gone to store to stock up on supplies for the next 5 years so you can close yourself in basement and wait over the term
You mean you're brexiting so hard as to actually import from US instead of EU?
You get used to it, honestly
Just run
Like I feel like I should have at least a general idea, but I don't
Pardon me, what are feminine glasses like?
I've had mine since I remember, and they only ever broke once
How does one even break glasses?
That's some impressive negative electorate
That's democracy, baby!
Getting your vote to matter by voting the party that won't get eliminated from competition by technicality is something people are concerned about when voting. I've heard plenty of "I would vote for X, but they might not get in, so I have to vote Y"
People *do* vote differently with different system
It's also a psychological problem as well, imagine your car killing a pedestrian and you beating yourself for the rest of your life over not using the override
Then, what's the point of it?
Because you *could've* taken control
Counterpoint: manual override will make people liable for cars' errors that they have little control over instead of manufacturer
I think there is one good answer, would you ever buy a car that *does not* prioritize *your* safety?
Trolley-esque is a nice way to put it though
The difference is that the computer would have to make a decision, since it does not act on instinct, and thus it literally cannot be negligence
~~Just carry a spare brake~~
Now that I think about it, what puzzles me more is how many situations are there in which breaking efficiently is not the best solution?
https://i.imgur.com/AVSPULB.png
Discuss
The best thing about my glasses is not that they allow me to see, but that they make me ~~look smarter than I am~~ appear appropriately intelligent
I agree
Kinda weird though, I'd generally think I also like colors
Let's just say I wouldn't wear them now even if they weren't too small
Used to have ones with brown arms and blue metal (full) rims in primary school, which, well
I wear black metal half rims, btw
Dare I suggest that there isn't even something like "masculine glasses" the implication of which is likely what threw me off the most about the idea of feminine glasses
Just "feminine glasses" returns more conventionally shaped glasses, but indeed with wings like Mel said
Not gonna lie, I actually did google "hot librarian" lol
I swear, I have never seen glasses like that irl
In an eye-like shape?
Ah, they are rounded on the *bottom*
I mean, people do care about human life, that's why many people want to replace human drivers with autonomous cars, since they'll likely be safer
Yet in spite of many people dying yearly, nobody is like "Maybe we've gone too far with that whole electricity thing"
People die to electric shocks, and flow of electricity is completely self driven natural phenomenon
When the first person died in car accident, we didn't drop the idea of cars
Sure you can say it, that's what's going to happen
Thousands of people die on roads already
I give it 5 years
As in all occupants of India in general?
Them being?
As one state
*the entirety of Europe*
I've heard that the closest analogy to political state of India is
Who want to destroy church and very foundation of society that is family
The real galaxy brain play is to make unreasonable laws and accuse your opposition of being communists
Well, I thought it was something serious buy that's amateur politics
Divide and Conquer baby!
Standard stuff
Modi being a person or political party?
I'd thought the not-a-flamethrowers were sold whole
We are about to find out <:TsubasaSmug:585839805737467920>
America is the spinoff that somehow is more popular than main series, even though it's basically the same thing
Then move out of the way <:TsubasaSmug:585839805737467920>
Which is quite amusing because these risk having EU funds cut from them
Apparently as much as 82 administrative units in my country are waging war against "LGBT ideology"
Speaking of Dividing and Countering
Well, it gets popular votes
Give them some time to figure it out
Free voter ID is like one step away from that for no reason
Just issue a normal ID card for free <:TsubasaDisgust:349013662775902209>
Here you can't even open bank account without ID
I figure, but that's not exactly what I asked
Can you just go to bank and say, "Hey, I want to take credit on the name Radyjko Radyjkov. Yes, that's me. Only Radyjko has such sly smile on face üòè"
How are you even expected to function at all without any ID?
Just the fact that you have to pay to get one is stupid enough on its own
These are usually the most conservative demographics, and aren't conservatives pushing for voting ids?
But why wouldn't you want poor people to vote?
What
Scorched Earth
It's a nice thing to have alright
Like seriously, what is NK gonna do if they don't like the deal?
Can he? You don't have a law in place that requires you to have 2/3 majority for that?
Well, at least you already apologized to outside for pinging him <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Just to make your head spin a little bit
Tritium is
Deuterium is not radioactive
Heavy water is water made of Deuterium atoms, instead of regular Hydrogen (Protium)
But no, likely threatening with Nukes when you are with your back to the wall, rather than striking first
Because they didn't have them
Nazi Germany says hi
And I think that's what Anand was actually talking about, to use them defensively
And maybe to send more or less empty threats
You keep nukes around so that even when you are up against wall you have a solid argument in negotiations
They won't use nukes in the first place, unless Kim suddenly decides to commit suicide with delayed detonation. Everybody knows that
Plus it's not that complicated, tbh
That's what school trips to a reactor do to you
But most of power, period, comes from something spinning turbines
Solar Cells that you usually think of *don't* work that way
I walked over an open reactor
Closed off reactor is cowardice
So no nuclear steam
I don't believe water powering turbines and water cooling the reactor ever come into direct contact
You need to be just safe enough to make accidents statistically improbable within plant's lifetime
You don't need to be 100% safe
Nature finds a way
I mean in general
Unless I'm missing something
I am mildly surprised that people hadn't come up with proper emergency shutdown though
Just start tabletop gaming
That still applies
Well, if they are anything like me, then they probably feel bad for asking you too
Dunno how's it in US, but I hear these jobs pay quite well because *nobody wants them* (not necessarily for reasons you think of though)
I do wonder though if it would be cheaper to actually study abroad than in US
4head
Just get scholarship
Do you mean that literally, or is it just the impression you have?
Although I do have to hand it to them that they've got source for that last bit of info
"Doesn't feel professional" is an understatement
"Kiwi Farms is an immensely creepy American stalking forum run by manchild Joshua Conner Moon out of his mom's house." - first sentence
When you say you spend most of your time watching videos and playing games, which one do you spend more time on?
~~That's an odd question~~
"If you spend as much time with me as I do, you'd hate me too"

<:MikuPraise:585839808765493249>
I mean, just take a look at that joker
Certainly in Nazi germany they were
They are generally kinda assumed though, yeah
Or in the process of being outed
If you can describe yourself with more than 1 adjective, you were probably dead
Who didn't they kill? <:ChrisOi:586551700987576330>
I actually wonder if he just saw this and thought "Well, that looks cool"
Not Nazi, just German
The skull has German flag on it
Cuddling might be matter of culture of upbringing
These subtleties is what makes me think that they just saw the think and brought it because it looked cool
It absolutely does, but that doesn't stand in the way
<:TonyEyeRoll:580561912513691679>
It would be hell of a coincidence to put unrelated German flag on blouse with Swastika on it (or vice versa)
Point is, I bet your door mat doesn't happen to be a german flag
Swastika is not necessarily always a nazi symbol
Yeah, we get it
Well, that was easy
What does that even mean?

How does weed make oil companies lose money? <:HibikiWhat:336656482907193344>
Wiki:
```Cannabis in Idaho is illegal for all purposes, and possession of small amounts is a misdemeanor crime.[1]

In 2015, a bill to legalize CBD oil was passed by both houses of the Idaho Legislature, but was vetoed by then-governor Butch Otter.[2]```
It's basically WMD
Haven't you heard Aria? Vaping killed *8 people*
*I don't even know what you are talking about*
<:HibikiWhoops:585839808115507222>
> Also don't expect an immediate effect from anything you take. Be that alcohol, weed or prescription medicines. A mistake people make when doing things for the first time is "oh its not having an effect I must need more."
That's a good timing
When will next election be held?
US presidential election might be nice way to relax after our own elections
Except oil is not made of dinosaurs \:P
If you are stoned enough it is
Don't... quote me on that, but I'm pretty sure plastic is somewhere between couple and several steps away from oil
But weed <:HibikiWhat:336656482907193344>
Well, plastic is made out of oil
...no?
What a crazy year this 2020 is
Is it? It's not the first war in the middle east we've had
And I'm sure you are as naive as to think that the money spend on that would've been otherwise spend on making lives of locals better, it's US we are talking about \:P
He said civilians, those are probably not getting killed
Nothing spices up the economy like friendly rivalry between superpowers <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
<:VanessaCracked:639136452600397829>
And not just any one unlucky person but everyone
That's a pessimistic take because it comes from perspective that we are here to suffer, therefore killing everyone ends the suffering
It also means nobody will be happy ever again
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I don't respect the no
Perhaps
There's so much actually smart things you could do with infinity stones and you'd choose wiping life on Earth?
\*Puts on boxing gloves\* What's undemocratic about EU elections?
If you are going by what you heard here, there probably won't be any WWs any time soon
We'll just use old tested British/French strategy of airdropping propaganda pamphlets until our enemies surrender
Lol
So, if there's gonna be world war, there are gonna be some sides. What sides?
Of course, when the choice is between avoiding war altogether and just avoiding draft, it should be an obvious one
It's quite literally more distant problem compared to risk of you being drafted and having to give these families bad time *yourself*
Russia is not particularly threatening though
~~Listen here you little~~
is American Navy
My favorite trivia tidbit regarding military is that, the second air force in the world after American Air Force
So no stress
I figure if it ever came to the point where I'd need to get drafted, the whole west would be royaly fucked anyway
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
<:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
Your fanfic is doomed anyway
No, because these fall under multiverse
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
It shows decently enough
This scale is also pretty whack, because the higher number you have, the harder it is to raise it
Astrophysics are kind of crazy
In the *past*
Not to mention literal opaque *wall* surrounding us
Comparing expanding universe to balloon is nice and intuitive, but I feel like comparing it to screen would be more accurate
Also, if space expands faster than light, the universe doesn't have to be factually infinite, functionally it might as well be
It doesn't matter whether it's inside or outside
Surface of baloon is also enclosed
Wait, how can space have no edge and not be infinite?
The possibility of universe being *literally infinite* doesn't do that for ya?
That's quitters talk
As far as I know, these aren't seriously considered
I thought the implication was that this would've been by accident
Why do you think it's unlikely, Mel?
It would be very bad PR move, even for US
('that' meaning shot down by states)
I actually wouldn't expect that to be the case
Wait, you mean US ·µñ ≥·µí·µá·µÉ·µáÀ° ∏ managed to shot down a civilian flight in meanwhile?
/s
Yeah, I'm sure US will back down after that
People are meming WW3 because they find it funny, not because they find it likely
They say it was Iran
Mystery solved I guess
Well
"Pentagon officials and Iraqi intelligence confirm Ukrainian plane was shot down"
MonkaS
It better be better in that case
Hence why theories about Iran accidentally shooting it down are a thing
I too am beyond facepalm
Guess WW3 is canceled
> We must all work together toward making a deal with Iran that makes the world a safer and more peaceful place,
~Donald Trump
Though if that was indeed an accident (of plane variety, not of antiair mishap variety), it couldn't possibly happen more suspiciously
Now that that's been said out loud, it does seem unlikely
I understand that it almost certainly wasn't "whoops, shouldn't have pressed the big red button" case
To both of you really
Correct
They obviously wouldn't want to shoot it down on purpose
Welcome to the majority government club, where governing party can do whatever the fuck they want, including disassembling the country
I've read a theory that it would most likely be broken IFF on plane
On the contrary, that's kind of their goddamned job
Yeah that, ouch
Ask them to make you one of these bad boys too
<:ShirabeCheer:661042424570708037>
Yeah, I figure any country could do decent job at not existing if the gave it a try
It's keeping it that's the hard part
A lot of countries had hell of a good time invading Poland
No but you see, it didn't work for them because they were communists
So once again, how the fuck is that even possible?
Nobody has that kind of problems in our public schools
How the fuck is that even possible?
Yeah, I caught on already <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Sounds like you live in some dystopian nightmarescape
Yeah, but do they have coat of arms?
My dang city has flag and it's not a country <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
If you want to use rainbow but not associate with it, there are hundreds of way you can get around that
But I think the bottom line is that lgbt flag is... well, a flag
Well, between these two there isn't any <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
üè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåà
That and also different number of colors
There's also technically a difference between rainbow and...  Gay rainbow?
What's the surprising part? The longest running or communist party?
Sounds like a """fun""" topic to read about
We can talk about it
No, but I have regular phone, which is much wider than half of 62
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
You are right, it is 62 folded
Oh dear God
Let me whip out my enormous ruler
Why even bother, just nuke the entire phone industry
62mm wide, when unfolded I pressume?
Lol you wish
Galaxy fold is 160mm high, what the actual fuck
That and provided they actually use foldability to keep phone size reasonable
<:TsubasaSmug:585839805737467920>
...if they ever get them to work properly
Say what you want, but folding phone is a brilliant idea
Stop enjoying it, it's a tragedy <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
But give them a couple of years and the phones are gonna be full PC keyboard sized
Phone keyboard are small because phones are small
Finally a question I can answer
I wish you weren't such relatable person <:HibikiOhNo:586337444597596202>
~~No pasta?~~
Are you telling me I've been doing right my entire life!?
What
I skip breakfast because I feel sick in the morning
Or found yourself unable to keep up a conversation because your interests are too narrow?
Have you ever had a friend how talks only about one topic and won't shut up about it?
Once again, it's not about shame
It's not about being ashamed
<:VanessaCracked:639136452600397829>

Yes, precisely
I get that

Oh yeah, I know the above feel too
He wanted to meet you and between "shorter time" and "not at all" chose not at all? <:HibikiWhat:336656482907193344>
Comforting to know
Oh yeah, that
Sort of?
That's like double the dose of travesty
Now I'm not a woman, but if someone told me "I like this anime more than you do" or any flavor of that, I'd run and tell all my friends to stay away
Being anime fan is like a reverse of genetic competition
Genetic competition?
Also answer my PM anand <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
Forgive me
I have realized the error of my ways when an urge to punch you for this statement hit me
I am sorry
Makes it a bit awkward
(I mean, not anymore but)
Apparently I'm the only person discussing it right now
Yeah, but the thing is
HIBIKI AND MIKU ARE JUST FRIENDS
Well, we are going back to shit anime takes then
<:KirikaShout:607741871703457812>
What? You can't leave now
Not that I think it's particularly meaningful considering that being responsible for entire life of a person (or multiple people) is generally too much for pair of parents but
Whose else fault it could possibly be?
I mean
I mean, I figure you know better the people you have around you
Bet he still preys for your well being, bastard
Combine with "best" and it extends to like 10
Pretty silly how there's one world for like 6 different things

Yeah, but saying "Being outside sucks" sounds much better than "being Kevin sucks"
Aya you are in for many surprises here <:Ver:336656981144109066>
I like your take Aria
Like, there's not that much reason to move
I have forest right by my home <:ShiraBean:661294258795446326>
Nothing wrong with that
You do need to go outside occasionally

It's over 1000 person server, you don't necessarily have to agree with everyone

You repeat it until it does

I have an essay due in 10h
Well
That sounds like a great way to get anxiety attack, yeah
But if they matched the source material, they'd be perfect
The quality of them backfired and made them stand out waaay too much
The custom animations were üëåüò©
But you asked about hating it, not death threats
I was this close from saying this myself
There is a difference between disliking something and actively hating it
I could never put this much effort into a hobby project, therefore it's garbage and I hate it
That doesn't sound very depressive
Can one have mostly positive outlook on the world and simultaneously be depressed?
Let's talk about something depressive <:MikuPraise:585839808765493249>

Anyway
I wonder how they are gonna handle Miku helping Chris in like 1-2 episodes ü§î
Who's gonna be next president?
So
You can go try to go to uni after trade school, but you gonna have harder time getting in
Trade is 4 years (used to be 3) and technical school is 5 years (4 before) with additional focus on things that will allow you to either study at university or get a middle level work
Like, a school in which you learn for particular job
You can choose trade school, professional technical school or a regular ass high school <:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
After Primary school you have 3 kinds of school to choose from
PL
The high schools are fine, the primary schools are fucked though
Here's how Polish system looks after recent reforms: http://open-book.ca/var/site/storage/images/media/images/dumpster-fire/28975-1-eng-CA/dumpster-fire.jpg
Why not? "He" is valid only for half of total population
I mean, if you don't refuse to do that, then what's the problem?
You gonna have that discussion every time a new person joins because it's not in your face enough to notice for a lot of people
You need to click someone's profile to see their pronoun role
> tfw you greentext all the time out of habit
I mean, that's perfectly fine, dex
What views though? If you have conversation between two people who know common courtesy, you'll have one person try to refer to another in most appropriate way and the other won't get mad if you get it wrong

Lest we find out that the site was right to remove my shit
Yeah, but at the same time the site isn't legally obligated to give a shit about what I do on it now
Well, if I need to drag X site into the court every time they unfairly delete my memes, these protections might as well not exist
And how does one seek to get unfair removals righted?
What is the punishment?
Interesting, how come *nobody* mentions unjustified removals when talking about article 13?

Not to mention, what if male bathroom is unavailable and I *really* need to use *any* bathroom? D:
Then barring born male people from using them at best shifts the issue from pre transition to post transition
If the problem is, say, male appearing people using female bathrooms

But this is at you Yorin, it is not entirely unreasonable to actually let Trump win second term, if the idea is to let him burst in his own flames instead of letting Democrat take the heat and possibly lose following term
Although at the other hand I do have latent fear that Sanders is only popular in hard left circles that I hang in and in reality he could have no chance
Watch dems go "Eh, we can handle 4 more years of Trump" and put Baiden for vote
Baiden's chances better be not great
Do they not want to win presidential elections?
What are democrats doing?
The good old "No one is going to kill the system that allowed them to win in the first place" <:Ver:336656981144109066>
So they can split delegates proportionally by popular vote within state, or send all delegates for person who won popular vote or otherwise completely disregard popular vote in their state

Emerald has Ninjask, therefore it's the best
I'm a simple man
That is true, I am trying my best
And I hate it because she keeps coming to me asking me about it every 5 minutes <:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
She also plays Pokemon Emerald on tablet
No, she's too innocent to say that
Not something I ever expected to say
And I told her "I played Minecraft when you weren't on this world yet"
Tangentially related but like yesterday my sister showed me Minecraft on phone and asked me if I know how to play Minecraft
That game also has banger soundtrack
```System Requirements
3D graphics card
DirectX 7.0 or higher
Windows
Processor 300 MHz```
The craziest part here is that you can still download it and play it like 18 years later
It's this game http://www.axysoft.com/axysnake/
Feel old
The first game I ever played was in 3D <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Most of them, including game soundtracks I found later
I can think of only a couple of songs from my childhood
I joined just after XV ended
Once again, Dec 2017
Story time?
<:TsubasaDisgust:349013662775902209>
I mean, I have vague idea that delegates don't necessarily need to follow what their districts wants, but are they actually allowed to do whatever they want?
> but then it was actually set up so that people vote for the president but then some random person says "no"
What do you mean?
Goddamn, why does US presidential election have to be so complicated? <:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
You know, the period of the year where these bloodsucking motherfuckers go hunting
<:CarolTheFuck:617036187319795722>
tfw tick season starts in February
Besides, I think it's safe to say nearly everyone here "consumes porn in moderate amount". At least moderate <:KanadeBlush:672455329451343882>
You should throw them into Boston Bay
Hows the current outlook on presidential race anyway?
Gee, maybe they should worry about their heads first
So many people T posing
How come?
Radical centrist!
Political compass is great for memes
Yeah, it was aggressively ok
Well, pft, maybe but I didn't watch it, so I wouldn't know
I don't think it's a controversial opinion to say that Goblin Slayer was ok past 1st episode
NGNL is not *just* for gross people though
<:TsubasaYareYare:407397617451139073>
What's gonna happen to central park? <:ShirabeConcern:586404485598019604>
If I ever needed to fire a gun, I would rather not risk dealing with cranky owner recognition or needing to be in appropriate area
As far as I know, killing people is already illegal in US, generally speaking
I think this is a cultural problem more so than problem with guns
<:Zababies:672238628398956594>
What kind of change would it supposed to be though?
That's even worse than throwing pork at them
If you are not ok with it, don't just let them know you are ok with it
At the very least frown at them and say "Bruh" or something
If it's usually the same person next time instead smile and politely say "Do you have only one joke in your repertoire?"
It's like a vegetarian equivalent of "What's weather like up there?"
Could be worse, they could be throwing bacon at mosques
Or extinction
Lol nice
Why the fuck is that possible?
Yeah, like that
Not so much why would democrats let him start from their arm
I understand the general idea why he's starting
Isn't he also right-er leaning that democrats are supposed to be?
That much I understand
Would Bloomberg even stand a chance against Trump, suppose it somehow comes to these two?
Well, this is not really *the* election
~~Not to mention hilarity of the situation where you get classes how to *raise* a kid but not how to make one~~
Yeah
I mean, if they are optional, who cares?
After all, dystopia is just an utopia from perspective of wrong people <:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
How would that even work?
Just some declaration that they are gonna "protect families" or some shit
I mean, not that I look at it, it's not even a law
~~Actually, the whole ≈Å√≥d≈∫ Voivodeship has some sort of AntiLGBT law~~
Which you can avoid I'm pretty sure, but highways are obviously faster generally speaking
Just the main highways
Like a circus
It really is
<:TonyEyeRoll:580561912513691679>
With ballot boxes, duh
We have a gay candidate and he would've gotten 43% in duel against current president
Hell
Like, brexit cut
But it's very close
üôÉ
They absolutely are
Whew, that's a very nice distraction from our own presidential race
Instead of letting Bernie run dems would rather self destruct?
So basically
Wouldn't they prefer someone, you know, better, as an alternative to Bernie?
The characters in LGBTQ+ are ordered by how hard it is for your average cis man to get over the ideas they represent
But you got T and B twisted
I love me some serious discussion
Bears
What does the B stands for in LGBT: Wrong answers only
Yea, I wouldn't recommend it though
<:DMJii:549819519082692608> <:Bayonet:660870998098444310> <:HibiMiku:432007202136391690>
<:TikiPraise:672430544381935625>
Dunno
<:Zababies:672238628398956594>
Well, pfff, It's me problem, not you problem, just to clarify
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
I kinda hate how much I can relate to you ngl
Though it does come with it's own set off, uh, challenges
<:HibikiWhoops:585839808115507222>
<:ShiraBean:661294258795446326>
I agree, not thinking is great
No, I read that wrong way
That hurt me physically Hatt
<:ZweiHug:672455346949980170>
There is also nothing wrong with being what your parents want you to be, if *you* want to be that too
I wouldn't
<:ShirabeEmbarassed:336657288477671436>
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
*Regardless of who asks*
It's weird that when somebody ask "How are you?" I have nothing to say other than "Okay I guess"
It's just
<:MariaSunglasses:336656798687690752>
Ikr?
Which is not necessarily the same as fun to stick around
Not being interesting as person I guess
¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
If not a bit shallow, to make it clearer
I'm a very fun person, all things considered
No, I'm sure they do
Oh, and maybe also bring a star from the sky? <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
But at the end, I just didn't
And so I thought too
You would think after 2 years of not talking with my friends, I would have a lot to talk about regarding like developments of my life or something
Well duh
Like
On the other hand, I often have nothing interesting to say about myself either
It's not like I'd ever feel uncomfortable or anything, just not interesting
Of course, I can't please everybody, but when in group of several people I have nothing to say, isn't that odd?
Well, pfff
I said nobody
But I didn't say everybody
<:KirikaSob:674720015047720961>
Case in point
Anyway; I'm just saying, it's *very* hard to internalize that you are an interesting person, while you have nothing to say about things that people are talking about, and also nobody has anything to say about things that you want to talk about
<:TonyEyeRoll:580561912513691679>
Tony Glazer
Pffff <:MariaChuckle:672465496515411984>
Let me know if you find solution
Go on
~~Get off discord and do the example~~
<:ShirabePout:336656831978012712>
And I thought my humor was tasteless
Whew
üôÉ
Looking forward to my visit at clinic next week
Just bracing for a potential epidemic of coronavirus, giving proper people proper permissions and the likes
Don't worry though, Korwin-Mikke still disagreed with the law, so the world is not ending just yet <:GenjuroLaugh:665645853599465482>
The opposition agreed with governing party, and governing party even accepted corrections from opposition
If you wondered how bad that whole coronavirus thing is, our government nearly unanimously passed a law regarding coronavirus
Me too thanks
<:ElfneinDrowning:336656417035517952>
~~Just make sure it doesn't happen that your friends are the ones leaning on you~~
But just don't feel like reading
And I still do
And I liked them
They weren't *long* books
I had fortitude to read like 7 books and then just stopped
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
I'm really gonna need it
<:ShiraBean:661294258795446326>
Come over to us at <#357682999300718592> Carlos
Yeah exactly
Effort, yuck
<:Zababies:672238628398956594>
The problem is that it's midnight and I'm in the train
<:TsubasaDisgust:349013662775902209>
Yeah, nothing tragic, just ate too much pizza
That's debatable
Abandon hope
Instructions like wash your hands?
I have opposite problem, actually, I'm underweight
<:HibikiTired:422925410490253313>
Coca-Cola or Pepsi?
If it's okay to ask though
<:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
I don't have anything enlightening to say, unfortunately
That's a whole another level though
I mean, me too
You just kind of did?
How does that happen?
Rip
Did you live?
Jesus
üôÉ
Lesson learned
In any case, too much fat in short span
Do no dess
I mean, if not, at least I'll die in comfort of my home
Probably
<:MichaSleepy:586957502306975744>
I am safe
Caught last train home with about 2 minutes spare, now that would've been an utter disaster
Like I said, nothing tragic, not anymore at least
Eh, like 5 minutes
I don't think that's true, actually, unless you consider pragmatic "if dems choose wrong candidate, they'll hand win to Trump" as such
Don't the parties put forth their candidates for president?
Is it not that way though?
I mean it's fine, nobody knows what the hell is actually happening in politics anyway, it's just an odd thing to be adamant about
<:MariaChuckle:672465496515411984>
Carlos c'mon, that's not a valid defence
But then I'm not one that would give him a chance in the first place
Dunno, I wouldn't give Trump my vote after 4 years of that shitshow
I think the counterpoint is that Carols expects Trump will win again no matter who dems put out
More like the working class works
No matter what purpose you have, you need money, so companies will try to amass it
But that's the point
And the rest gets lost in the cogs of corporate machine
You may disagree on religion, national politics or whatever, but at the end everybody will agree that having more money is good
I mean, when you look at any collective of people, even your country, what is the most common value that nearly all people will share?
Money can be exchanged for goods and services <:TonyEyeRoll:580561912513691679>
The purpose for money is not relevant <:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
Almost by definition
Corporations exist to maximize profits
There is nothing weird about it
Clever is (or sounds) slightly more practical than smart
Ah, you see, but to be smart, your parents need resources to teach you
Even if we all agree that there are people who choose to be poor, what about people who choose not to be poor, but still can't get out of the poverty hole in spite of doing their best to do so?
Carlos do notice
Mel, you just said yourself that there are people exploiting it <:TonyEyeRoll:580561912513691679> 
Remember that the point isn't that these people don't exist, because they do. The point is that trying to stop them from exploiting it is actively harmful to people who are trying to get help for legitimate reasons
Well, if one side is talking US, and other Mexico, what's even the point of discussing, right?
(Please don't scream at me, I genuinely don't remember the consensus <:ElfneinBullying:421432763078410241> )
...But hey, at least Biden is not Trump, right...?
Someone posted a headline from state TV saying "The sick (with Coronavirus) from Zielona G√≥ra wasn't baptized" and I can't tell whether it's fake or not
Lmao dude
My president
Love yourself dummy
...why?
Now I'm not sure if I want to invite that evil into my life but...
~~I don't even understand why STDs would be a problem to begin with tbh~~
~~With all the panic buying going on I need to know exactly when to buy popcorn~~
<:HibikiWhoops:585839808115507222>
Yea, but I'm mostly asking for time frames
The rationale is "Think of the children" actually
When are the last of these state votes going to be conducted?
I heard Sanders is still in the game
How about instead we talk about evergreen topic of US politics?
I certainly don't
I don't think you could understand tbh
üôÉ
Archbishop of Czƒôstochowa said that Coronavirus is less dangerous than LGBT ideology
Oh but don't worry guys
Boomer Doomer
Legendary cold
I think you would be more scared of what you won't see
Bolsonaro got Coronavirus? The president of Brasil I heard so much about?
But muh skyscrapers
But you see, once you move there there will be one
https://www.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6
Whiskey has
And we are all out off vaccines
To have anitbodies against it you need to be either recovered from sickness or vaccinated
See, I knew I needn't to say that Nevis <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Is it going to be ok?
HaHAA
I don't think so tbh
~~But also he probably already has it~~
That's rude <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
Oh yeah, imagine that
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
Also in couple of months when it's clear as day that the 2mld PLN the government thrown into garbage bin are going to be desperately needed elsewhere
When all people who get infected in churches start developing symptoms üò¨
Next week and following one is going to be interesting here
So uh, they better hurry up with them
That's what vaccines are supposed to be for
I see it as an absolute win
That's good on humanitarian level, they either take care of population or get kicked out of office
That's kind of half assed guillotine left if they want virus to mop the floor
Andrew please
<:KirikaResent:684370061837729811>
Also my future work called and informed me that signing contract will be postponed by 2 weeks
Ah
The border lockdown though, oof
Like, it remains to be seen on Sunday I guess, there is like no reason to go to church even if you are believing christian
That's what I figure as well, but not everyone is enlightened like me <:TsubasaYareYare:407397617451139073>
I do not know how it works exactly, so uh
Plus some local church higher ups suggested dispensation from going to church
It's not *that* bad
Still infinitely better than nothing I expected
They are not stricte banning them, they are just limited to 50 people, much like everything else
Why do these guys need looming pandemic to act reasonable? <:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
Closed borders, closed restaurants, bars and places of entertainment, ban on gatherings over 50 people, including churches
Meanwhile my government issued lockdown
While certainly possible, I'm not holding my hopes up
For that to work you need to have sick population under control. Otherwise the virus will just emerge once again later
<:MariaChuckle:672465496515411984>
No, it's because chocolate has magnesium and shit
We get a box of chocolate
<:ShirabeDrool:688429716557791326>
Take pic and upload it later <:HibikiEager:407398049531559937>
I'm just below the weight bracket, so I couldn't even if I wanted <:ElfneinDrowning:336656417035517952>
Blood is always in high demand
That's uncharacteristically nice of him
What does that mean?
But then, what stops everyone else from taking away all privileges from elderly?
Well yes, but also no
Not good
That's a horrible example because space exploration is way behind the 8 ball when compared with how far other tech went
They didn't do it for sake of violence, they did it because it was beneficial to them
Even though military researcher gave way for inventing internet, it's not like that research killed anyone
I mean it does
Oh boy, the presidential elections are going to be interesting
Yeah, but still it wouldn't hurt to try
Every day though maybe not so much
I'd say eating cupcakes at class party paid with days of anxiety afterward is justifiably worth it
Why's that?
The best gun is lower case r
Now it's up to you whether you'll bring groceries or doom back
<:NoiseTea:688192213762572295>
Sort of
Still Poland
Our government actually wants to do the elections in the middle of pandemic
Holy fuck
Or all former soviet states combined
That's more cases than France
Is New York okay?
Oh yeah like
Ban on gatherings over 2 people, or 5 for religious gatherings, and you can't leave house without good reason
They tightened quarantine couple hours ago
<:NoiseTea:688192213762572295>
For now
We have only 799 cases
Other than maybe "Because party leader said so"
I have no idea what the hell are they thinking
Curious
Even though nobody heard about them before
And managed to get 140 000 signatures in mids of this
They joined in at 16th March (that's 4 days after schools were closed)
It is legal because the candidate starts from another party
It would seem that our government put out a dummy presidential candidate, just in case opposition tried to cancel elections by collectively withdrawing their candidates
(But also, is New York ok?)
Well, US has like 5 times higher population than Italy so it's not that surprising
Today's session is going to be interesting
Yeah, parliament
Apparently our deputies are afraid of coming to sejm today
*Everything* they do appears to be tailored for elections
Basically it appears that the whole aggressive initial response to the virus was just publicity stunt to get ahead in elections
From what I can tell
<:MikuCute:672908542763859968>
Also Polish government party: In accordance with constitution, there is no reason to postpone elections
Polish government party: Although the law doesn't permit voting remotely in parliament, there are things more important than law and by forcing us to vote in person, the opposition is putting lives in danger
Hey, as long as it works
They can't possibly arrest us all! <:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
What are your thoughts about your country's response to the pandemic?
Okay Kerrik
<:CarolSmug:617040484111745027>
Yeah, but I didn't know if you were Anand's friend
Neat
Wait a second, is Phanta your german friend?
<:KirikaCry:674720015047720961>
Better to have stolen summer than stolen lungs
Well, that's not gonna help with economic worries
<:HibikiEager:407398049531559937>
Yes! YES! **CRUMBLE**
> The dispute over election in middle of pandemic is breaking the government party apart
Bruh
> Government shuts down forests
I think corona *can* actually mess up with your stomach so uh
<:KirikaDisgust:688431636043268097>
> Islamophobic sentiment is peaking here
Where isn't islamophobic sentiment peaking tbh?
Bold of you to assume they research beyond what feeds into the bias
Apparently it's a fake news though
Uh oh
Wait wait, you *are* making the same argument as I do
With some caveats, of course, like the claim abuse etc
It shows that youtube is as good as a video hosting website can legally get
There's been Tom Scott's video on that topic quite recently actually
You mean institutionally or content-wise?
And I even think it set up some analogous systems to twitch
You can stream on youtube
I'd be leaning to that as well, but voting Biedro≈Ñ in first round is more of a protest vote
I still haven't decided tbh, but for all that matters it looks like I might not need to
Stands for Law and Justice, which are two things they hold in so called deepest regard
The government party here
<:KirikaTired:688429723726250054>
With 20% voter turnout
Really looking forward to PiS getting landslide victory
But that is also the least concern I have about it
I don't see that tbh
As if presidential elections already weren't going to be spicy
It's maddening how hard government pushes for election in middle of the pandemic
Me too
Just two as far as I know
<:CarolSmug:617040484111745027>
Finally someone who will understand my rambling about political scene
<@!174272493777977344> You're from Poland?
You gotta me more specific about jacked prices
<:ShirabeDone:688198954810474559>
People are arguing that making health care less accessible will make the waiting lists shorter?
Wait what
:)
It'll come for you too
34 confirmed cases in my county
Well, I'm demonstrably not in debt
I don't have to pay out of my pocket when I break a leg
What decisions?
Also known as "free healthcare"
Fighting that capitalist competition is also why most countries have national health insurance, man
No shit
<:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
Because that's like actually stupid and I refuse to believe any government does that <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
You mean all your income is taxed by the bracket you fall in?
Oh no, anything but flight disruptions <:TsubasaNeutral:688429723205894149>
What? Why?
Anand what did you do
You can't damage your eyesight by looking at moon
Fun fact:
You should phone in and say you are calling them via 5G network and that they are gonna get cancer or something
<:ShirabeFear:696380146248319066>
That's pretty much the gist of it
Although I hear afterwards restrictions will be slowly lessened
With mandatory face masks from this Thursday onwards
They are also tightening restrictions on citizens all while displaying complete disregard for the restrictions they set
(That act was passed illegally, by the way)
The government has absolutely no intention of delaying elections, as displayed by them pushing though an act that would force voting to be entirely via correspondence
<@!87512939107450880> Um yeah, so basically
<:MillaarcV:673239269036392526>
That's how they get you Kerrik
Thankfully I needn't concern myself with it
If my school blocked <:KirikaGlee:698939825927094384> it wouldn't be my school anymore
<a:MikuQuake:605209236082786355>
Now I'm frigging angry
Have I mentioned that at least one of non-opposition presidential candidates likely had signatures required for running for presidency falsified?
Yes it is
Yes
:wheeze:
"Voting abroad can't be reasonably conducted"
Oh great, full abortion ban is on the table again
You could drag that dopamine rush argument to the conclusion that you should live in absolute chastity
I don't believe that bill was passed in my country yet <:TsubasaSmug:585839805737467920>
Well, pff, it's literally not porn
<:CarolSmug:617040484111745027>
Everything in moderation my friend
Wait what, you want recommendations? <:KirikaShout:607741871703457812>
Rougelikes
Nothing gets you to self moderate better than concoction of open-ended gameplay and a pinch of frustration <:TsubasaSmug:585839805737467920>
I was gonna suggest these
It's a rougelike, right Yumi?
Focus on getting mileage from games instead of actually finishing them
Trying to 100% a game that I couldn't conceivably 100% did it to me <:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
Literally anyone not hugging the right wall will be called that
I mean "communist" is a meaningless word anyways
So yeah, upcoming month is going to be a wild ride
Communists didn't like religion
<:KirikaTired:688429723726250054>
If only that was the biggest concern about it
Because they want elections exclusively via letters
<:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
Our cursed government passed a law that takes away ability to organize elections from National Electoral Commission, while the law that passes that responsibility onto postal service is stuck in limbo
Fucking lmao
Good recovering <:MariaConfident:336657338729627658>
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
You need to be more specific about "worst news"
I dunno, maybe you should ask him? <:ShirabeMad:688188118087499792>
Wait but hundred is not even that much
<:KirikaWhat:671948299179130885>
I suppose the general wisdom would be to arrest them or fine into oblivion
Of course, but then also what are you gonna do about it?
~~And the virus is not even deadly enough for natural selection to do the work~~
Mark 10th May in your calendar
Watching just how relentless the government party is about forcing presidential election is tragicomical
Elections
It just surfaced at an extremely convenient time <:kappa:475242385190682624>
Don't feed in the disinformation, they didn't cause it
<:ShirabeFear:696380146248319066>
Government: We can't allow political crisis in the middle of pandemic 
Also goverment: causes political crisis in the middle of pandemic
My point still stands then <:ChrisOi:586551700987576330>
What kind of sources do you need to use to believe... This?
(Yeah, yeah, I know it doesn't apply to all Americans)
People be telling that Americans aren't morons, but then there are people out there protesting quarantine... In middle of pandemic <:KirikaDisgust:688431636043268097>
Welp, that answers my next question of "What stops me from getting paid for oil and selling it later?"
~~Has capitalism gone too far?~~
How the fuck is it even possible to create situation in which you have to *pay* somebody to sell them a product?
No tests for medical staff, huh?
Oh yeah, that's uh
Is it thousands as in couple thousands or as in hundreds of thousands?
Excuse me? <:KirikaConcern:698939825386029186>
I mean, if he doesn't want to follow advice, whether you give advice or not, you can only lose

Tanks are cool tho

Okay Nevis, watch this
Yes, that's what she does
General population of your future employers are probably not dumbasses who browse memes all day and believe everything they say
In a country where law is upheld, these elections shouldn't happen in the first place
¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
Anything could happen
Also depends on exact context for "unable"
Let's be honest, anything could happen
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
That means that the postmen need to deliver voting cards personally, directly to hand of **all 30mln** eligible voters
What they did not change is how the voting cards are supposed to be delivered
In an attempt to force elections government passed law that makes it so all eligible voters will vote via mail. (Before only disabled could vote via mail)
Are you ready for more hilarious news from Polish elections?
(Also another reason why labels are dumb but I digress)

When I was that age I brought literally negative value to society
You are like 15
You don't even need an amoral system!
You don't need moral system for decision making
Otherwise you won't even be valuable at doing just that
But you can't go about with serving people by extinguishing yourself
There is
So what?
That doesn't matter
You can always complain
Even if you want nothing more than follow orders
Yeah, but you still need to be able to stand for yourself
There are quite few things that are novel enough to have undocumented side effects and simultaneously that you have any chance to interact with

No point in using that argument against a hypocrite, guys
Imagine thinking that what you like decides your value as human being
(With that said, I don't remember whether LN was better or worse)
The source for Goblin slayer is Light Novel, not manga
Of course he can, he is literally doing just that
The finger pointing never ends, huh?
IIRC they did, but you wouldn't know about it if you only read manga
<:ShirabeAwe:698939825113268306>
And I apologize to you Melua, for my... lapse in judgement. You shouldn't have to put up with my shit too
If my memory serves, I also remember what Raiden said to be true, that the original source is far different in portrayal than manga, and anime (which I believe is based on manga) sits somewhere in between. But in any case, even if rape scene is the kickstarter for anime, vast majority of anime focuses on action, or more specifically on that dungeon crawley-style approach to the combat, focusing heavily on tactics, rather than raw strength. Hell, that meticulous approach to combat is even shown in the very first episode, in between the questionable scenes, and possibly is given even more attention.
This wasn't something that was present in a lot of anime at the time, and this is the premise that sold many people on the show, many of which stuck around for that particular aspect of the show *in spite* of other aspects presented in it. And the execution of that part, for what my uninspired opinion matters, I think wasn't bad at all
But of course, good luck explaining that to someone who thinks that as much as *considering a possibility* of people who might not hate a piece of fiction with controversial elements existing is I N D E F E N S I B L E. In truth, I am also very upset by how this went, but I can hardly say I didn't see this coming
And nothing of value was lost

What a lot of people seem to forget during arguments is that just because they believe their stance is right, it doesn't mean it is 100% right

There is an presidential debate going in national TV right now

Aw shit, here we go again
Politics have never been this exiting before <a:MikuQuake:605209236082786355>
Timeline update: Senate rejected the letter vote law in its entirety, the bill is coming back to sejm tomorrow afternoon (until Thursday morning?). The election is still scheduled on this Sunday
Nothing else changed since
I figured it must be it
<:HibikiTired:422925410490253313>
They are fucked
I blame the coronavirus tbh
Okay, I put some weird cream on and now my hand are slightly less on fire
Mostly
Whew, these small presidential candidates have some real, uh, fascinating responses
Should also mention that the question was charged with matter of adoption as well, I really didn't expect the response to take this track though
Paraphrasing: "There is one reason why gay people want right to marriage: tax breaks. So the solution is removing income taxes. Then they won't need marriage"
Oh, this bearded guy has it all figured out
<a:MikuQuake:605209236082786355>
"If the bill allowing gay marriage ends on your desk, would you sign it?"
I saw just right now timer skip from 22 to 20
Yeah, like that
"this person was screwed over by everyone but managed to pull through and now they are so awesome people want to be his slave"
The Stockholm syndrome could've mattered if it was addressed in the story. Which it obviously isn't
(or was it from loony tunes? I don't remember)
Yeah, but it was in the 50's. And Disney of all studios owned up to it as far as I know
How long does it take for epidermis to fully roll over?
Yeah, but that's exactly what I just said
See the thing is I can certainly tell who fulfills the criteria of being bigot with quite confidence, but I couldn't tell you what "like bigoted" entails if my life depended on it
Well, though luck, now what does "expect" mean? /s
I wonder if these "almost everyone" know what it means <:ShirabeThink:704340938994090005>
Why not just say discriminative?
What's "being bigoted" mean?
And also Contrapoints
What's ableist?
Yeah, I mean it's a good idea to have in mind, as long as you are not fatalistically idealistic about it

I'm pretty sure AHS isn't posting child porn on nazi subreddits

Show up and cast an invalid vote then
Didn't they learn their lesson after last time? ü§î
\*Checks dictionary\* Well, I don't think that makes Funko Pops consumerist, it just makes them shit
Nice <:CarolSmug:617040484111745027>
But then again, why not go and cast a spoiled vote?
I mean it is logical
If people vote for Biden, what makes you think democrats will conclude from it that they'll need to put more left leaning candidate later?
Matt how the fuck, I didn't even ask the question yet <:KirikaWhat:671948299179130885>
Like Funko pops are at a glance on whole another order of magnitude
Marvel movies being made with broad appeal hardly makes the whole thing consumerist
Yeah, I was also gonna say
Fucking bullshit
I can hardly imagine I am the best human out there
I'm not fucking up the world and being toxic either, and although my status of asshole is questionable, I am not bigoted either
Humans > foxes <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>

Did... the message go though? It really seems like it's missing an important bit
They are just blowing hot air then
But I'm not gonna be like, sure yeah, burning shops is fine, go right ahead
This is a shitty situation all around
What does Target store have to do with police officer murdering someone?
The only difference is involvement of fire
I mean, it really isn't much better tho
If you are gonna make things violent, the least you can do is point the hatred in the right direction
None of that requires burning fucking target
Set the police office on fire, make a street blockade
I mean, yeah that
Ever
No, you are right, it is despicable. Regardless of the former, everyone is telling you that we don't see it getting better without violence
Even if it is more, if you are focused on doing something else that's enjoyable, it helps
Yeah, surrender for now and go for some tried and true form of entertainment
Police experiment store, what? <:ShirabeConcern:586404485598019604>

> sometimes, people try to convince me that bisexuality ''doesn't really exist'' and that i'm just pan in denial.
That sounds like people getting uppity about the *label itself* of all things
How cool would that be though
At least I think so, I don't know how US law works
Legally he can't
I can see him trying all possible avenues to avoid it, but he can't just cancel elections and declare himself tsar of states for life
He won't have a choice
Why wouldn't elections happen though?
Hey, we did that and the country is not quite on fire, sort of
It's just about as impossible as him winning in 2016 was
It isn't, I explicitly said before that capitalism and trade are not the same thing <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Because you really can't
Or otherwise an analogous to it
It's a counter to the idea that you can do without money
That's how it works now
With that said, I don't see how compassion would push someone to clean toilets
Do note the difference between capitalism and mere exchange of goods and services for monetary value
Well, if we aren't getting scifi AI, we might well not have any <:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
As grotesque as it sounds, they didn't have it for free either
This is a problem that we have no business worrying about because either it won't happen in our lifetime, or we won't have anything to say on the matter anyway üôÉ
If people lose all work because of automation, that means human labor is not necessary, and we can take next step towards Fully Automated Luxury Gay Space Communism
There is no problem with automation in this context
Like if we automate labor, then by definition people won't need to do it
> I mean when you force someone to deal with the bare minimum supplies to clean toilets then it'll be a tough sell, but say if it was mostly automated, they largely just maintained the automation and only got involved on rare occasions? There *are* plenty of people who just like to be helpful and would probably be willing to do that job. Just make it not literally the worst thing imaginable and you get more interest in really crap jobs than you might expect
Yeah, but do we have automated toilet maintenance? There are things that just cannot be done by a machine and will not be for long time, and if we are looking for solutions, we ought to look for ones that will work *now*
Explain
Is it though, that's a very low bar
Now convict them you cowards
Yeah, cool
Oh yeah, the presidential election machine starts anew <:HibikiSmug:672655850518609940>
Depends where
What's the opinion here on civil partnership?
üòÇ
And then someone gave prime minister fucking flowers
And it obviously passed
Which was proceeded in sejm, in which Law and Justice has controlling majority
Towards himself
Our prime minister from Law and Justice put forth motion of confidence today
And then dumped it in the river?
They made statue of George Floyd?
And here they just vandalize monuments
Polish state television says opposition candidate for president is a pushover because he lifted umbrella slightly higher when leader of his party asked to do so
Maybe ruined by politics, but that's slightly different thing

And Cocoa took it seriously and is now drawing cards
Aria said to draw
Shoot, the world will be better place without my garbage üòî
Besides, you won't know what kind of people you'll have to deal with until you meet them
It will be, eventually

It's not like black people are killed on streets in US right?
We are technically gonna have hybrid voting

That sounds doubiously legal
What's CHAZ and why should I have thoughts about it
All while trying to reintoduce communism themselves <:LUL:540570052215439360>
The context is that LGBT is supposed to be ideology "worse than communism"
Two top twitter hashtags tell our president to fuck off <:HibikiSmug:672655850518609940>
Oh, but this pointed be towards something uplifting
"They are trying to tell us that [LGBT] are people"
Oooh, our president produced real marketable quote
<a:KirikaUpset:688429724221046872>
No it isn't
But also pride flag doesn't have smooth transitions between colors like optical rainbow does
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
Answer the question
This is <#336297840529899522>, there are no jokes here
Which politics though?
That's the beauty of being hypocrite <:HibikiSmug:672655850518609940>
I mean, you can
But you do not have right to call cops on me for specifically what I'm saying
In the sense that I can talk to you about whatever I want, and you have right to not listen to me
The point of fighting censorship isn't about respecting ideas
But you always have right to dismiss something
> Many of them would say "I hate what you say but I'll fight for your right to say it" out of one corner of their mouths whilst spewing all kinds of disgusting things out the other. I'd wager most of them wouldn't even call it hypocrisy.
Well, pfff, the way you put it it literally isn't
But also somehow I can hardly see Trump having mental capacity to such things
You think this is just some twisted coincidence? Because otherwise that's extremely fucked up
Bruh
tmw your goverment party is pushing for dictatorship so hard that neonazis tell to not vote for you because you want dictatorship too badly
Time to start catching up <:MikuDelete:661660028410920990>
(Don't actually do that)
Call the cops on them and say they are blm protestors
Horny serious
<:ShirabePout:336656831978012712>
Still biggest in first turn of election
Nice
Yes but Jesus Christ don't scare me with these numbers <:MikuShock:690470896154050620>
It means percentage point
That, or more accurately p.p.
Oh, better brace yourself because you are about to hear a horrible truth
And his approval in polls dropped by 2pp
I think our based president has realized that was he said was a mistake because he's now in full damage control mode
But between democracy and not democracy, you know which one I'd prefer
I mean yeah, I know the difference
Both are vermin <:MikuDelete:661660028410920990>
Same difference
<:ElfneinWeld:586027421296492585>

Gotta say, the funny guy in glasses has a way in talking
The question about Euro
I'm disappointed, a whole round without filling bingo <:ChrisAngry:336656958272700417>
Yeah, but they have just one candidate
Don't you mean left candidates Kai?
Absolutely not Nevis but it's hilarious that even far right goes against goverment party
The nationalist candidate just said he won't agree and proceeded to roast the TV for that loaded question <:CarolTheFuck:617036187319795722>
<:CarolSmug:617040484111745027>
The oppsition candidate did well answering loaded question against him
Yeah, he's in prison now, so there is that
You know it
Speaking of religion in school, have I ever mentioned that the priest that gave me first communion turned out to be a pedophile?
And there is proper LGBT question <:MariaNo:672658725986762764>
There goes LGBT off the bingo
Not yet Ferb
Right now about religion in school
A fat fly just landed on the head of candidate that was talking <:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
Pardon me, I meant 2

Ten I have an additional question
I suppose I do
It can't be some aspect of mind that you just cannot control, so who does?
To be clear, I absolutely get the idea of headspace, and what it's supposed to be... but what *is* it?

Wouldn't Kenye split Trumps votes tho?

Yes. And it is going to make people who still need to be swayed harder to convince
This is worse than useless, it's harmful. Not only it accomplishes nothing by burning real work hours into it, but it also turns people away from the cause
(Although you do have to ask yourself, do you believe that people who got to highest echelons of managements in company such as twitter would be gullible?)

There's very much denying to that, you'd have to be gullible to believe that this would have meaningful benefit to society

Trzaskowski
Turnout 68,9%, new record

Exit polls:
50.4% for Duda
49.6% for Trzaskowski
Pretty sure it's just needlessly reductive propaganda of people who want everyone to vote, but ok <:MikuDelete:661660028410920990>
Why, nobody knows who you vote for
Young people usually vote in evening IIRC, but this was different 2 weeks ago because of the situation
That's not a very long answer
Long answer: It's a turnout at 17 o'clock
Short answer: No
<:TonyEyeRoll:580561912513691679>
Though I hear turnout at 17 was record high
Well, I've got something spicy for when election silence drops already <:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>

At least we got the Senate
But hey
Okay, I say it should've been done, but actually it's *even more* complicated than that
The kicker is that this should've been done anyway at some point, just not by this goverment lol
You know, the good old divide and conquer
Long answer: It's not really complicated, they probably just want to separate liberal metro area from countryside so that they take over local goverment in new mazovia voivodeship, under pretext of optimizing EU funding
Short answer: It's complicated
Which actually means completely different thing than in US <:MariaChuckle:672465496515411984>
No, taxes are state level only
I mean technically moneymaking center is supposed to be fucked
Kinda?
As in powiat = ~county

They want to separate Warsaw and neigboring powiats into new voivodeship

rip
Uh oh
<:Zababies:672238628398956594>
Yeah, it's definitely the place
But we literally don't tho
Hard shifts are needed to get a near perfect world
I don't think we need any hard shift to achieve "good" world
Technically in positive sum game being selfish still results in everybody winning [oversimplification]
But irl no matter how rich you will be, you will always need to rely on other people
For instance, your allies in game at some point become expendable, which is why backstabbing them becomes adventagous in the first place
Which is not to say that it's invalid example, it's just reductive
Risk is just a game tho
The point of calculated greed is precisely to not piss people off enough to screw you over
I believe in you
<:Zababies:672238628398956594>
Oh yeah, that's rough. Be ready to deal with the feeling until you get to produce results of your choices
And then cheat the system by looking for work in the outskirts as well
You could live on the outsirts
Why don't you want to work in pandemic infested capital?
Just put electrodes in the brain ez
Kings are mixed bag, and nobles as a whole have rotted over time
All in all, bad king, 3/10, though still better than Poniatowski
To be fair, as wiki points out, Sigismund *later* got brilliant idea of turning the deal on its head
Pretty much
I don't know the case to that detail
Mind you, by that point it was already arranged that his son would become Tsar, and the siege happened because he never came
Yes, but that only happened because Sigismund was lingering with sending his son to take Tsar crown in the first place
There is a cool story related to the succesion in Russia as well
That is indeed possible
Wait, what?
Perhaps, but it probably not because of HRE
HRE didn't even neigbor Russia tho
<@!266379640069685252> It was the other way around, the king that was supposed to become Tsar was supposed to convert to Eastern Orthodox
It isn't, he filled up the holes
Not quite
We literally could've avoided all that
Also given the abovementioned fact that we could've put our guy on Tsar throne
I mean it's pretty fine nowadays
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
Oh no, is that gonna make it into next chapter?
Bonus fact: The reason why Sigismund moved capital to Warsaw was because he accidentally set old castle on fire during an alchemical experiment
I mean, yeah, but also we kinda did it to ourselves
<:ShirabeWeep:701475635025019000>
What part about kingdom that spans half of entire europe doesn't sound good to you? <:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
In any case, yes, this was well before deluge, but the mess around Swedish crown was essentially what put things in motion that lead to it
...Except he didn't let his son come do the tsar things, so Russians managed to fix their shit and get their own Tsar
And most critically, he managed to leverage chaos in Russia at the time and establish his son as Tsar
Even before that, he was elected for King in Commonwealth
Basically Sigismund Vasa was a Swedish King, at least for period of time
No
<:TsubasaBliss:672861879000891432>
Counterpoint: Commonwealth of Four Nations
The only good thing that came from Sigismund III Vasa was moving the capital to Warsaw, you can't change my mind
Don't even get me started on suffering adverse effects from historical hard shifts
I think it's way more complicated than that, but I was also replying to Mel
I would honestly say it's very american centered worldview
Casimir III the Great
Great
Fair
And it's Kazimierz III Wielki to you <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
Lowkey best King, period
Whaaat, how did that happen?
¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
But for some people the only cure is a bullet
I am by far one of the people with highest reserve of good will towards others
You know
These shorts are killing me
But the thing is, if you have ever interacted with actual human beings, you should know that this just can't be true
I mean it makes sense if you look at it in very reductive way (not what Kaiyo said, that sounds frigging ridiculous lel)
I mean literally not, you'd just be not bi
That doesn't even make sense
Pfff what
<:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
It blows my mind that there are people who think there couldn't possibly be anything between 100% straight and 100% gay

Oh boy, the government is gonna close the coal mines
Then don't give in to pressure
What's she gonna do?
I mean, tell her you don't want to take it off
I just want to make it clear on the start that for the most part I think that conservative vs progressive stalemate is infinitely better than what we have now
You can promote these values without being utter asshole tho
I will answer with a question, what does socially conservative even mean?
Because if they dropped the bigotry and assassination of judiciary, they'd get majority of votes without any trouble
So yeah, that's what gets me
Or people could just get fed up
They could implode out of infighting
I don't think they are fascist or anything, just really good at real politik
<:TsubasaSmug:585839805737467920>
I mean maybe
Nah
And with authoritarian tendencies I guess
And bigoted
Just conservative ones
They *are* social democrats
(And actually, they lifted income tax from people under 26 too)
Such as money for each child you have, or 13th month of rent for elderly
His party basically gives money off to various groups that mostly happen to be their voter base
What makes this shit complicated
He actually does, which is
Damn, at least here dumb people are smart enough to vote for people that actually make their lives better
Poor people vote for him?
Whew really?
They are coming for us oh god oh fuck
But with that said I seem to be pretty efficient at avoiding stumbling into it
I mean I do believe that as well, kinda
> well, love could take a fucking plane to be here faster
This tbh
But I literally hate both of these lol
What am I just supposed to passively hope that somewhere on that way a woman in my age and height range gets a position at my work space like some gift from heavens?
And since I'm stuck in my job for next 3 years at least, unless something catastrophic happens on the way, I'm not getting forced to change environment anytime soon either
Being unconcerned is exactly what landed me these pitiful numbers in the first place
And I would like to not die alone
Yeah, but you seem unconcerned <:HibikiBlep:605209109284782090>
What gets me is that in last 10 years I had 1 (in words: one) relationship that had even a remote chance to take off

I do not have facebook because I have personal boycott of the site
Demonstrably false <:MikuDelete:661660028410920990>
I don't see how that is a measure of lack of honor <:ChrisOi:586551700987576330>
But I do have pride (which is what you probably meant)
Thanks for honestly, time to find a rope <:MikuDelete:661660028410920990>
I'm 22, ask me again about dating app when I become full fledged wizard
But, the thing about mental illness and such (I know, might not be the nicest way to phrase it) is that if they were warranted, they wouldn't *be* an illness
No I get what you are saying Anand
Nah
<:Zababies:672238628398956594>
Emi is talking about depression
And I'm not particularly worried about it either on daily basis
When, again, I don't seem to get opportunities to leverage it
But the point is that confidence is not enough
<:ElsaCharge:690470897559011328>
I believe in it
All the more reason to acquire a well asap
<:ShirabePlease:724034356192215081>
Get well soon
What's up?
I was gonna say "But they are" until you wrote second part of sentence
<:HibikiWhoops:585839808115507222>
Pretty much
Perhaps I misunderstood what you said, but even if men are waffles and women are spaghetti, I don't see how being a waffle makes you a man, if you get what I'm saying
I mean, I'd find what you describe quite grotesque even before
See, you don't see it too <:ChrisAngry:336656958272700417>
> society is designed along the boxes of male and female
At least myself personally
I don't see it tbh
@Military, I work with military myself and to me, to be honest, it seems like a regular jobs, only with higher requirements... and fatter paycheck
<:TsubasaDisgust:349013662775902209>
I'd say if someone tells you you can't kick ass because you are a woman, you should kick their ass
I am genuinely confused
Yeah I mean, why not
See, with names I can totally see that, but for the most part it stems from rigidity of language itself
(or at the very least there shouldn't be <:TonyEyeRoll:580561912513691679> )
I mean, I would, but so what? There is no law that prohibits anyone from doing masculine things
The gendering of names is like a whole another can of worms altogether
I mean, you are yourself, it's not up to me to decide, pfff
Very very angry
Wacky translation
I don't think I would be inclined to break over that, but man, it'd lead me to white fever
<:ShirabeMad:688188118087499792>
I think I would throw a phone against wall if I got message like that
Cypher you can't seriously expect me not to use my once in the lifetime opportunity to make this joke
> syntaxe 
You are dead to me <:ChrisEnraged:423196924368388105>
Notabene the reason you cite for launching the dating up is the exact same reason why I don't want to launch dating app <:KirikaTired:688429723726250054>

Such as some random person on public server
I mean, if you don't have any relations with someone, then by all means you have no obligation to respond to them
Are we still talking about friends?
Yeah, I'm thinking you are drifting a little bit, since we were just talking about relationships/friends
Then tell them they are an asshole <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
If you leave someone, but don't tell them why, you are a jerk. Period.
Honestly, fuck it
But you should probably start with that, even before you decide to leave
And what us therapist gonna do without your consent? Pour the singular syrup via funnel into your mouth?
It's not like you are particularly dangerous
I don't get that sentiment tbh Mei
They are synonymous as far as I know
On the other hand the night terrors...
Nightmares are just a bad dreams
<:GenjuroLaugh:689563633516150872>
Then explain it Emi, I am established to be bad at explaining <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
But what I did notice is that people universally find me difficult to understand
That's what I *thought* I should be doing, but that's not what actually happens
I mean
I mean, maybe, but it's considerably toned down all around
In writing, no
You can have it, well deserved
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
I have no idea what you are talking about guys
It's a proof that I'm in peak mental condition <:HibikiBlep:605209109284782090>
<:ShirabeMad:688188118087499792>
Rude
<:ShirabeThink:704340938994090005>
I'm not really shocked either tbh
I mean I already figured something's fucked up inside the dome, so it was less of a 'you're adopted' tier shocked face and more of a "Oh, really?"
Pretty normal I suppose
I don't think that's a question I can give a precise answer to so let's just say yes
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
I've had a cool conversation with my mom which basically sums up to "In hindsight, you might've had autism and/or ADHD your entire life and we just never noticed it"
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
Wait, what kind of jews are running the world behind the scenes then? <:thonk:531554645143715841>
Trying to explain what?
Boo, well then I don't care at all <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
Bar getting a pass on making autism jokes
I honestly don't care about the Autism part
Oh well
Do you think I should mention the "obsessions" that I supposedly have to my therapist?
Regarding being difficult to understand it mostly involves having to follow convoluted chains of thoughts
So anyway
Funnily enough Aria, wikipedia article: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nightmare
I would say there's a spectrum of good vs bad dreams in general, and some people take bad dreams worse than others, as seen on picture above
> this conflict is as old as the mesopotamian empire
How the hell is that even possible tho?
Just don't live in some fucking shithole <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
Idk, it feels safe here too
<a:KirikaShake:722156260241178655>
That's even deeper into the danger zone
Circles doesn't want to be thrown into jail when China finally executes the economic takeover of the West
Why even work as a teacher
If he gives you an apple, it's a trap, run immediately
:citrus:
Ah, well asking for a blowjob is another thing altogether
Wait, is that good or bad?
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
WITNESSED
Well I mean what Star said was extremely callous tho
You would be surprised
But still, no <:MariaNo:672658725986762764>
But what gets me is that it would be actually a great idea, since she has an apartment and solid position for kickstarting a career
Mind you this is more of in form of a jokes than a serious thing
<:TsubasaPeek:623246193002151938>
My coworkers are shipping me with another coworker
Help
Bad example <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
We say that all the time lmao
Well I mean I see nothing wrong with later
Okay now I'm extremely confused
??
I mean, you can just like how Asians look
That sounds like... totally different thing though
That's extremely dumb tbh
But that's exactly the point of saying it in the first place
So no points afterall <:MikuDelete:661660028410920990>
Specifically 
> Sorry, your hair's not blonde and your eyes aren't blue. I'm into *real* Europeans
That's... Just an awful thing to say all around. You could pick virtually any term that has certain associations to it and phrase it in a way that's offensive, such as "You don't have freckles and red bush, sorry but I'm into *real* redheads" or "I like symphogear fandom. But only the real fandom that ships Tsubasa and Chris"
I still have a bone to pick with previous topic though
Meiyi you are now appointed as dedicated person to wish me good luck
<:ShiraBean:736607747834904667>
It was the best session basically ever
<:KirikaApproval:586957465552158720>
Well, I'm off to see my therapist (not for the matter of questionable choice of words regarding preferences to be 100% clear)
It still sounds more outlandish here since Europeans are generally gonna have much more contact with other Europeans, and not so much with Asians
BUT ALSO
Okay, points
Yeah, I guess that's how most people understand it Mel
Which while these people *are* Asians, that's generally not the first thing that comes to mind when you hear the word
But, again I am talking about what's generally regarded as typical characteristics related to the term
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
They do look kinda Asian though, it did take me couple seconds to reply
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
I guess saying  that you like white people isn't exactly nice (Like in particular probably don't say it directly to people you are interested in), but it's easier than describe the *entirety* of typical visual associations regarding the race
But as I said, I don't see anything particularly wrong in saying "I like white people" either
But the main reason why I think it's a bad example is exactly this, because "Polish" or "European" doesn't have much association in terms of looks
Just don't tell anyone it's associated with Nazi and it will be hunky dory
I certainly do <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
<:NotLikeFist:689188869974786133>
I should also probably mention that I argued mostly about looks, because looks are what you see and personalty is volatile
<@472513526393602059> comfort yourself with thought that until yoy said that I hadn't even consiedered that some people's preferences might stem from a desire to straight up exploit other people
I understand now, thank you Melua and sorry for straining your nerves <:ChrisPray:672578403156885504>
Mind you it's not necessarily a good thing, curse of Balal and all
But you can, it happens all the time
<:HibikiThink:688429715362414641>
I mean I see that, but it's kind of a matter of balance, since if you don't say "Asian", you will have to use another more specific term, which might well not be caught on at all, or have to use many more detailed terms, which if you wanted to use a blanket term is probably something you wanted to avoid in the first place
I guess the specific point is that certain stereotype is used as a frame of reference, which if your speaker doesn't find clear, you can elaborate upon
But I thought it was obvious <:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
Yeah, and then you can add for example that when you say European, the imagine in your head is someone that has blond hair and blue eyes, that, well, perhaps indeed not every European is like that, but that's just what you are looking out for personally
> Someone asking in regards to it to get a good understanding on if its a bad thing to use is hardly a bad thing imo
Yeah, but it needs to be said without questions asked because people who say trap have no reason to question it either out of ignorance or out of malice
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
Because clearly people are replying as if comparing a person to something that exists for explicit purpose of deceiving and harming someone was ever not a bad thing
Like really, it's the homophobic origins of the word that nearly nobody using it ever heard about and not the fact that it has all around garbage implications when refering to a person?
Whenever I read something like that Mel, I have a moment of dissonance, as if I were the only person on the planet that reads the word as inherently negative
Ban China you cowards
<:ShirabeAwe:698939825113268306>
But you lived on to be great
<:Zababies:672238628398956594>
<:MikuWorry:672908523495227432>
But I'm slowly realizing that that is basically my *entire* life so who am I to judge
You know I'd ask you something along the lines of "And it never occurred to you that you might not be supposed to do that?"
<:KirikaSalute:620069889838809089>
In any case, good luck on your endeavors, and get back to gaming as soon as safely possible
<:KirikaConcern:698939825386029186>
You gonna be Kerrik, keeper of 41979 proteins
<:ShiraBean:736607747834904667>
On the other hand, why not actually answer the question then?
That's literally opposite of that
In which out of 8 messages that I sent in last 15 minutes do you see me assuming that something obvious to me is obvious to anyone else?
Where does it come out here then?
So I asked you to clarify which one you meant
That there are some aspects that people may relate to, but at the end, each of our individual lives will never be fully understood by anyone else
What I was trying to get at is that there are varying degrees of being understood
You know what, fuck it
I asked you to elaborate what being understood mean in the context and you literally refused an answer
You never even tried
Define understood
<:Zababies:672238628398956594>
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
But at the same time, I *genuinely don't know what I'd do*
I want to ask, I think I wouldn't change my opinion of Matt
It's like

Serious is a true test of fortitude for me today
Until one day I went "Wait, please do" <:Ver:704169051391524875>
My father also threatened to send me to a psychiatrist
Shoo Matt, you were never involved in this piece of discussion
To be fair to me, I weren't there
Not necessarily?
Well I mean a trap is by definition *not* innocent

I beg to differ, my country is not occupied
Especially since you are paying bulk of military costs <:GenjuroLaugh:689563633516150872>

Also why would US bases be bad in *middle of Europe* of all places? <:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>

Didn't he already sign papers for banning tik tok?
+ It can always decide to change its mind later
Um, I mean that's an odd thing to discuss since I doubt dogs would be capable of actually deciding whether to live in pain or die, let alone communicate it, but if it was able to decide, presumably, if it makes a decision to keep going, it would understand the ramifications of it
ICBM interceptors is something, but hardly infallible
You mean that was ever a problem?
If that's supposed to be a counterpoint, I don't think "It's gonna be the same at the end" is a valid reason to do nothing, nor do I think it justifies making it easier
<:Zababies:672238628398956594>

He's named "Obsessed Nuker" Cyph, resistance is futile
Is the surgery supposed to fix the lack of hormones?
~~Hormones are for losers anyway~~
If you spend 20% of your life growing up and 75% of life putting off decision to make a surgery, there's not much left after it
Dang

Yeah, like, what's supposed to happen when one person just doesn't want a surgery? <:ShirabeConcern:586404485598019604>

Why flatten the curve horizontally when you can flatten it vertically
You don't need to close everything down
Yes, and imagine that's *not* a good thing
Why would they report if they weren't sick with COVID?
My family was getting sick recently, and not from COVID
So how is it better to the moral dilema in letting few do the necessary work while nearly none die, exactly?
I care about people dying is literally opposite of "Oh well what you gonna do" which you present
So do you or not?
What you are actually supposed to do is close down as much as you can until you work out further approach
I already knew more than they could've taught me :15min:
I also opted out of so called "family education" the first opportunity I got
The good outcomes are rather unlikely, I would say is the thing
I mean, it literally does matter
Pretty sure mercantilism is even worse than capitalism
I'm pretty sure Kaiyo's father was Chineese too, so he has like, absolutely no reason whatsoever to call out western crimes

Damn, these 100%s
Not stemming from history, at least not directly
I think a lot of people here just have capitalist principles in general though
Sounds great
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
Oh great, so now I am communist too?
Probably, at least I think that's what it means

That's some wild scoring

No no lank, local government and national government are not mutually exclusive
I am very much in on local governments, but I don't believe they are capable of scaling on its own

I don't understand a word of that
Wage slavery?
If people are not fine with brexit, why won't they just move to continental EU? /s
I don't think I'm really against the anarchism-like structures, but I think a functioning society necessities the need for overseeing in one way or another
Why not just have two world governments with some light flavor of cold war? /s
I would say it's more about giving smallest governing units as much relevant power as possible, and passing what they cannot handle upwards
Power doesn't have to be all in hands of one governing body though
Geez, at least make it sound cool come on

So uh, how are they chosen?
Actually, how are seats assigned?
Doesn't work the other way though
Because the one you choose will likely win anyway and they'll have more impact
If you make generally more popular choices, you benefit from having less parlimentaries
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>

That's nice and all, but I'm just gonna revisit it later
<a:ChrisBigMad:744850189600423996>
Mmm yes, gotta love it when doing something which you do frequently makes you recall something that made you angry and then you get stuck in vicious cycle where you ponder about it and get progressively and permanently more agitated as you try to rationalize that there is no reason to be upset to begin with but that just makes you more upset and OH MY FUCK I'M GONNA KICK A PUPPY
> That's not to say it's a good system. It's a shit system. It just so happens that there's ways for the system to be implemented slightly less shit.
But why perpetuate system that at best can be less shit, when there are systems that are not shit?
Like how opposition here got almost 50% of votes in spite of having no program
Being centrist is one thing, having realistic expectations is another
I mean I agree that fixing poverty will fix all the worst aspect of prostitution, but "Prostitution is non existent in post scarcity world" is too enlightened take for me
It doesn't exist *entirely* due to poverty
No
Yeah, I mean that's a very questionable line of work
It again depends on how laws are executed
As it can be easily argued that organized sex work is pretty much by definition exploitative
I'd agree with Kat in the sense that the solution that makes it work best is probably letting people "self-employ", so to speak
(at least that's the idea)
The issue is that legalizing prostitution as is would not make it much better
üëè
Now, that I can agree to
But the thing is, the problems we are talking are happening *now*
I fully expect us to hit singularity before we make machine that can do plumbing
Further than we'd like to be
But these solutions still work only in absolute post scarcity
Better
That didn't explain anything to me, but ok
Stop using words I don't understand <:KirikaShout:607741871703457812>
Digressions aside, I suppose post scarcity world in and of itself is too nebulous to be proposed as a serious solution... To anything
No but the implication is that if I do sex for, I dunno, having someone look after your childern while I go to cinema later or some other nebulous benefits, it's not sex work because I don't work for money
So it's only work if you do it for money?
It's like saying that cooks can't exist in a world without money
Shush you
Gonna have to wait until Monday for more solid news, but I hope it burns down

Maybe I read last subsentence incorrectly
<:YumiPoint:688429724103344164>
...And here we come back to the point where prostitution should be illegal
And then you get fascist in the office, congratulations
When you have to choose between like Hilary and Trump, it's not like you can make a good choice anyway
I  still don't get the point of that though
Guys you were supposed to reply "Yeah! That's ridiculous!" <:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
Are all american presidents bad?
I still don't get what's all this about
So, what's this discussion about again?
The real culprit is the pathetic excuse of electoral system in US that forces you to make choice between two shitty options
Get this though: You'd only get 1 regional party, because if anyone would be voting on other regional party, they'd actively be working against their region
It could, but regional party in and of itself, would be voted on because it's a regional party
The scotalnd seats situation seems like complete exception from what we are talking here
That much we can agree on Cypher
I mean, that's the thing is I wouldn't go as far as to blame people for voting for whoever they did
But you have to understand that if there is a better option between the two, you are not making it easier for them to win by not voting on them
11 Parties had only one seat
And the biggest one got 12% of seats
In first term, **29** parties got into Sejm
Lmao I just looked up
The discussion is already derailed nerd
In first term of modern Polish sejm one of the parties that got in with 16 seats was Polish Beer-Lovers' Party
Arrr
I mean, that sounds like something that cannot be fixed
But from what I undersand electors sometimes are picked to vote based on like, percentage, or something
Well I mean I know that
Aren't Electors just an afterthought anyway?
Whew, US electoral system is even more of a pahtetic excuse than I thoough
What do you  mean for *some* states?
I mean what else is new Raine
Okay, I know well how I'm gonna sound, but: and...?
Does it make it... much worse than it has been?
It wouldn't work because US politics is much more national than it is regional
Yeah, but that's exactly what I was saying
Imagine that
Ministries seem pretty much the same as here
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
No, the president
How do you choose president Cypher
Who're you asking?
That election is the reason why we have bar now <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Who?
Is there anything legally stopping Trump from appointing judge before election?
<:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
They got divided by zero
The government coalition accomplished something nobody thought should be possible
But that's just my educated guess
Maybe if it was like, enormous
I imagine it wouldn't actually make much difference
<:YumiPoint:688429724103344164>
Remember, Male and Female are just suggestions
Feedback loops are really cool /s
It will be hilarious
I hope Trump won't know about this
I don't think he's an idiot, but to say he's an Einstein of politics is an overstatement
But I have strong impression that it would not convince anyone to change their minds
Admitedly I hadn't watched the debate myself
But on more positive note, I've heard when Trump loses he's inevitably gonna have FBI on his ass
That's funny because I did actually want to refund it, but he bought it months in advance and lost receipt
But then it turned out that the watch had a dead pixel and it immediately killed all my will to check it and ability to enjoy it
Thing is, of course, I never wanted smart watch, but sure, I'd check it out anyway
One time my father gave me a smart watch as a birthday gift
But also, I do have specific rl example
No <:KirikaMad:688188152891834417>
No, that's not it
Like you know other than throwing yourself though the window
So
How do you deal with getting something you didn't really want in the first place, that's really nice in principle, but doesn't work out for you specifically, which makes you feel bad, but also someone went out of their way to do you a favor and you don't want that favor and you feel even worse for being ungrateful, but also regardless of anything you do, you're gonna have to live with the consequences of this which makes you feel absolutely miserable?
No it isn't
Abolish culture is just next level of cancel culture <:MikuDelete:661660028410920990>
What the fuck y'all mean by saying abolish
The proper term would be extend then, not abolish
What
Nobody needs to be anything
It also gives people option to break off the established models, making themselves more distinct
So what
<:SerenaDizzy:736605371912945736>
No one exists in a void
It's just how it is
So, are you gonna stop liking music because seeing yourself as a music fan can be potentially bad?
And you can draw a conclusion that identifying with anything is bad because it creates divisions and differences
It's means for people to identify with something
Now that people assume in and of itself is not a bad thing, they might want to verify whether their assumption are true or not, or they might settle on what they think they know about you because they don't care about you enough to check
And there is nothing that can be done about it
People will try to leverage their knowledge about you to make assumption on what you might be like
That's how describing anything works, including people
When next thing you describe is that the scenery contains ludicrous number of cacti
And someone you describe it to might imagine that you are talking about a lush forest
For instance, if you are describing a scenery, you might start by saying that there is a lot of greenery
When you describe something, anything, generally you would start describing it with broadest terms
It doesn't matter what they think of you as long as they are willing to not harm you over it. And if they aren't then they are a shitty person and that's irrelevant from subject of identities
That's their problem lol
What is the difference
Because I like to be associated with aspects that are commonly associated with my gender, for instance
And what's the problem about that?
<:CarolSmug:617040484111745027>
Whew
Flip flop? You mean *pair* of flip flops, right?
<:ShirabeFear:696380146248319066>
But also, pfffff
Well, it's technically usable mask
How disposable was the mask? And also did she actually wash it?
That's because doing considerably better than US is not an accomplishment
Come on
But like
They could be
So, at best, you get the same result as just asking one of them directly anyway
And if you'd accomplish anything, at best that would be someone asking you on some occasion why you started avoiding them
And in that case, even if they like hanging out with you, they probably wouldn't try to get back with you if they saw that you drew back
I mean it's still a bad idea, if for no other reason than because a lot of people just make passive relationships (especially but not only though the Internet)
Yeah, start from asking one person alone since they'll be more likely to give honest answer on their view of the situation, rather than have them under group pressure
Noo, population in EU is much more evenly distributed than in US
It's both
President is literally holding country hostage
I mean pretty much this lol
Majority of US is a desert

He is businessman first and foremost
Realistically it probably won't <:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>

The thing about Hawaii is that it's a territory of the biggest military force on the planet without any contest, and if US wanted to, they could pulverize any resistance

Protest vote is hell of a drug
Bruh
How curious ü§î
Coincidentally starting couple of weeks after schools opened
Another record of daily coronavirus cases
I am pretty sure though that people who voted Trump because he's not woman vastly outweighed votes on Hilary because she was a woman
Sort of
Weird, it's completely opposite for me ü§î
Who would've thought
That, and the person that twitted this tried to delete mentions of list author so you actually need to dig through topic to find it
I don't think anyone here wants to roast that kid
> The only reason anyone should feel uncomfortable in answering the question and admitting to it is if they can't justify their position.
I dunno, the aspect where people are literally creating blacklists with your name later also might have something to do with it
But like, is "What the hell are you talking about??" not a valid "No" answer?
Still applies <:MikuDelete:661660028410920990>
Just because other people have bigger issues, doesn't mean that you can't have issues
And that is, quite literally, just a tip of an iceberg
Because somebody more competent for and/or in need of that position didn't take it in place of Biden's kid
I mean even if it's genetic, it can still be a problem
As him?
If he got hariy-assness after father I would be doubly concerned
And I take that second round of Trump is acceptable risk
If we voted only for non-corrupt politicians, we wouldn't vote <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Oh no, by all means if the worst that awaits you when Biden wins presidency is his kid getting some position, that is probably not much of a concern <:LUL:540570052215439360>
What's so hard about accepting that US has shitty election system that doesn't leave room for principles?
I mean
> I very rarely see this as people hard trying to convince others to vote 3rd party. It's always Dems trying to tell people who vote 3rd party that they're literally voting for Trump.
That's probably because everybody already knows 3rd parties stand no chance
I mean to be fair, it is kind of important if you want him to not win
~~Didn't they get only 49%?~~
Besides, realistically, any time they mention abortion bills it's just a smokescreen
I mean, if the law can put you in prison, it doesn't matter that it's virtually unenforcable
As well as miscarriages, because fuck you
They would be illegal because the whole trick is about making abroad abortions illegal as well
The whole reason why we're having the discussion is because they can't
But like

Zandberg no
But wouldn't it be a case of marriage being annuled because it is illegal, and not because it was retroactively made illegal?
Are you trying to tell me that Republicans are hypocrites?
Yeah, I'd say delegalizing gay marriage would be probably much more difficult
Step 4: Behold your country developing backwards in real time

Election gives opportunity to pass that to another group of individuals
Hey address my question <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
What exactly is like, the most basic organizational structure supposed to be?
But then, how do you ensure that chosen experts are effective, and how do you ensure that they can exert enough leverage to finish the project?
I obviously do not ask for specific plan on how to build it
I expect you would have a general idea on how to explain how your system would deal with its shortcomings
All propaganda experts and no managers is how you get Soviet Russia 2
How would a community based anarchistic society go about building a Nuclear Power Plant?
Matt <:LUL:540570052215439360>
<:TsubasaDisgust:349013662775902209>
Oh it's those guys
I would say it's the wrongest way to answer it, to be honest with you
ANCAP <:pepega:646666657212792832>
It serves nebulous purpose of advancing science and is incredibly difficult to make without organization
But actually, I think something like a Particle Accelerator would be even example
Because if a power plant needs to be build, that means there is a need for it
Really kind of yeah
How do you build it? How is the process different than in present systems and why would anarchist way be superior?
Nuclear Power Plant
Yeah, but what I'm trying to get is what the fuck anarchism is and "magic bullet" answer doesn't help at all
I want to get a grasp on the scale, because there is a world of difference if the lowest level communities are 200000 people vs 20 people
How many steps down are we talking about?
And what are the councils?
What is general assembly supposed to be?
So again, what's the base organizational unit in anarchic society?
The way you present it it seems like a silver bullet for any solvable problems that societies can face without any flaws
Actually cut that question, what is anarchy?
So, what is anarchy supposed to accomplish here?
<:KanadeSmug:688191203178840064>
That's their reckoning for voting Duda in
Yeah, it's pretty wild
<:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
I just learned that US consitition doesn't actually grant right to vote
Oh nice
No I mean if we are rolling with direct democracy explanation, I would say in the realm I'm working in building Nuclear Power Plant is not a problem
If we could focus on addressing problems without the transformation?
But why would I go through an effort of transforming entire political system, only to later have to solve problems that didn't exist before
And that's supposed to be a flaw or what?
In that case, I'm gonna stick with direct democracy myself <:MikuDelete:661660028410920990>
Why not call it what it is?
So
<:TonyEyeRoll:580561912513691679>
Would that not be just direct democracy?
The question is if it's justifiable to move to anarchism, which is very much a yes/no question
Well, the people elected by citizens typically analyse the wants and needs of the nation at relevant level and then issue orders pursuing fulfilling these
<:ElfneinDrowning:336656417035517952>
I still don't understand what anarchism is
I mean yeah, units are made up
What's less cool about diet space cannon <:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>

You mean that state widely know to fall because of it's hubris? <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
> Orbits exist in 3 dimensions
Yes, and that means any orbit on the same height as ring *will* end up colliding with it
Another advantage of space canons is that unlike elevators and rings, they do not cost absolutely ungodly amount of resources to build
Yeah, because you're a fool <:MikuDelete:661660028410920990>
Say that again and you're gonna end up on one <:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
It's still diet
Diet space canon
I think you're gonna get this point across to lank better if you just call it what it is
Aren't right wing press here known to overexaggerate these kinds of articles to incite pro PiS supporters?

Oh of course, but I'm just saying if people hate smokers, there is a chance they have reason for it
If you blow smoke in my face while I'm just trying to get on train, you get what you deserve.
Okay, but only if you don't smoke on street
Is weed really so powerful that smoking it once a month makes that much of a difference?
Well, but if you don't care, then the tax is ineffective

And then the second is *volume*
I am pretty sure the main problem of US is culture
Well, yes, but some forms of exploitation are probably worse than other
I don't think legalizing *brothels* is a good idea really

Arizona supposedly won by Biden?

Dunno, if you enter current results into simulation it looks like Pa. is be all end all <:TsubasaDisgust:349013662775902209>
People generally don't die out of the blue
As per what uncle google says, more or less
Results with current counted votes
Cause if so, I don't see Wis blue as is, mail in or otherwise
But again, when vote count is estimated, are mail-ins counted?
It is, but the model obviously counts that these states that Trump leads in will be won by Biden
How do mail in ballots relate to estimated vote number?
Well, it's the best you gonna get before election results so <:HibikiBlep:605209109284782090>
Polls say Biden has 90% chance of winning, while all states he *needs* to win have ~3-5% lead for Trump
Michigan seems to get bluer as well, as expected
Hovermask called it

Of course, the more the merrier
Post it you coward
Better safe than sorry
Me neither but like
Nothing is written in stone until they do, in fact, nothing is set in stone even after because votes can be recounted
If it couldn't flip, they'd announce results
But likely won't
I mean, he didn't just lose, it could flip again
Well, it looks like nothing changes from predictions, Biden would win by like 2 electoral votes <:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
<:LUL:540570052215439360>
I am not sure if this is appropiate place to plug what exactly you got into, but sure
On more positive note, how many states legalized weed?
If NV flipped to red, that would weaken his argument
I mean, that would be sweet
If I had to make an uneducated guess I'd say PA has same chance to flip as NV
It seems likely that he'd win to me though
According to googel it's 53,5 to 45,3 for Trump, but he's far from securing a win yet
Joe could lose both Nevada and Wisconsin and he'd still win with wide margin with just PA
PA is 20 votes, what are you talking about <:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
But there's also Pensylvania
Yes
How does Nevada grant trump 269?
Alsom my favorite part of the election is Alaska, which counted less than half of its votes but everybody already knows it's gonna be red

You cannot avoid that, period.
All states in would commit all their electoral votes to the candidate that would win popular vote, thereby forcing result of popular vote to win
That's not what it means
(With technical caveat of rouge electoral voters, or whatever they are called)
If you have more than half votes, forcing them to vote for popular result is effectively the same as true popular vote
In popular election they don't
The point is that if you get more than half electoral votes worth of states on board, they can override standard electoral collage in other states
But it is
Clearly nothing will ve changed until it's utterly broken first
There's that plan of overturning electoral college by making states automatically vote for winner of popular vote
I think that's a very reductive take
I don't think these are that much related
And then another 2 years <:ElfneinWeld:586027421296492585>
If I'm sure of one thing, 2024 election is going to be either 100% win or 100% whiff on reds

At this pace Gorgia is gonna turn blue before Neveda counts their votes <:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
The fuck is Nevada doing over there?
Not in US probably, but still
It's how it's referred to
It blows my fucking mind that "Democracy Holiday" in US is literally regular Tuesday
Voting day is just Sunday <:MikuSigh:688429722799308883>
You leave work at 18, stand in line for hours, polling place gets shut before you vote and then you get fined for not voting üòÇ
I can only imagine the beautiful nightmare that would happen if you made voting mandatory without these protections
Because if the goal is preventing disenfranchisement, then to make mandatory voting, you need to ensure that there are protections against that for it to work, at which point you've already solved the problem without mandatory voting
Well it just doesn't
The foremost thing about mandatory voting is that the problems it's supposed to adress
It's still gonna be uncomfrotably close tho if it's anything more than 50-50 for Trump
And they are from blue regions too IIRC
50000 or so
1% is still hell of a lot of votes
Take that pizza man
Yeah
It's a win win <:KirikaApproval:586957465552158720>
Wake me up when GA turns blue
Nothing has changed since morning
Ikr?
If there are no consequences for not voting, then it's not mandatory
<:ChrisBored:672575526346424351>
Why not, just have 2 chambers with different sets of rules
Proportional party list <:TsubasaBliss:672861879000891432>
No
I think tie is virtuall impossible
Is it whoever loses popular vote? <:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
How does tiebreaker work?
Is it an actual victiory or an assumption?
I expect nothing, but hope for the best
But they will be üôÉ
Provided courts won't get involved, trading both Nev and AZ for GA is not a loss at all
Someone looked at the results in AZ and said "welp, no way Trump can win now" when it's apperently literally not the case
But it's not a prediction, you see?
It's just that it simply shouldn't happen in the first place
It means exactly what you expect it to mean, as far as I'm aware
It matters because it's not really a prediction, they've called the winner and they *may* be completely wrong
I mean, I knew that some votes count more than others but c'mon
Also, what the heck does "outstanding vote" mean?
I am aware of that
Ah what?
Is there some source where I can track it? Google has long since stopped updating results
Actually where is the but, what's the track record on recounts?
I mean, at this point GA is getting recounted no matter what but
Breaking: Vote counters in Arizona thwart a fraud attempt! Arizona is back to rightfully red!
<a:MikuQuake:605209236082786355>
But well, it wouldn't feel good if suddenly a state that's in Dem's pocket turned red and maybe even gave Trump win, when polls said that Biden already got all required votes, would it?
It obviously doesn't matter to the results because this is votes have already been casted and they just need to be counted
Which gives people wrong impressions and will be really bad press for press that called it, if it turns out that Arizona is red after all
It's marked with solid blue, as if it was already done deal, when in reality it isn't
Take look at this picture and pay extra attention to state pointed by the arrow
They'd both need to flip
\*Loudly picks up party poopers\*
It's still possible in nationwide scale but generally less likely to be of relevance
In any popular vote system it'd be irrelevant who wins Georgia
Because winner takes 16 electoral votes no matter whether they have 100 vote or 100000 vote lead
The problem with slim margins in Georgia is that it matters
https://tenor.com/view/ronpaul-happening-excited-gif-4407969
<a:MikuQuake:605209236082786355>

1500 votes

You can slice them up in the way that gives you as much power with minimal approval
Therefore more urbanized
These areas are more densely populated

Well I mean I never heard that pitch, but ok
Then you beat the drum that the fight is not over yet
From what I'm seeing, last senate election resolved in 1st round, for instance
On the other hand, it seems like Georgia got huge influx of new voters
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
Which is this
Of course, it's better than the alternative
<:HibikiDab:688190074395164696>

All things being equal, people will choose to go to the closest place first, and other aspects take second place, so by placing your pizza place next to your competition, you mimimize the number of people who are living between your place and competition place, who would likely choose based on these other aspects rather than distance
Now as a reward you can explain why because I'm too lazy <:MikuDelete:661660028410920990>
Correct.
A classic example is, if you want to open a pizza place in a city in which there is already exactly one pizza place, what would be the most optimal location to open it in relation to existing pizza place?
I'm gonna go ahead and say that at this point, it's worse for security, because proper password is impossible to remember

Nobody's questioning validity of government itself, but their decisions are, at best, questionable
I mean, protests are a direct result of CT ruling about abortion
I mean, you are kind of right, but also, surprisingly, hostile takeovers don't really happen in modern days
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
Consiedering PiS disregarded constitution to takeover constitutional court, no, I don't think it'd stop them
It can only legally delay it
Senate can't do shit to stop legislation from passing
What are you asking about exactly?
They've proved that they could if they actually wanted
mfw PIS with 40%
It's not illegal to run your corporation like government because *there is not government to enforce this*
But how would it look like mafia?
If you straight up removed government and let the corporations run wild, they will evolve to be indistinguishable from government
It comes back to what Fenny said
They don't, but only strictly because they have government over them
Hot take: Government is a corporation
Move to Iceland
By that I also mean classical colonialism because you could argue that entire planet is western colony <:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
I mean- now it is, but not hypothetically
I don't necessarily think world without colonialism is impossible
Of course it doesn't, it regards "personal" use of guns
That's when you channel your inner cowboy and hip fire while pretending to toss the wallet
It's really not, anyone who you'd threaten to take their hobby away would want to shot you dead on spot
Oh yeah, isn't the point of most reincarnation beliefs to become so good in life that you break off the cycle? <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
That's debatable
Now I'm starting to get concerned
He's actually dropping the cases?
But unless trump get's jailed, he better have good successor
Well, I've no clue how people decide who to elect when incumbent doesn't run
Joe better not be sleepy on his term
He has dissapointingly high chances of being reelected next time
Picture: as Joe Biden approaches the door to The White House, he meets Trump in the doorway, leaving it
"Pardon me, please" Trump says, before two FBI agents approach him and put cuffs on his hands
He got 73 mil in this election
Like for example Trump getting more popular votes than Obama
Which is mostly a semantic difference, but still
He didn't lose because people who voted Trump before decided to vote for [Insert democrat here], he lost because people who stayed at home instead of voting for [insert democrat here] last time, did not stay home this time
You are arguing Trump lost votes, this is demonstrably false, he gained votes, only not nearly as much as Biden
> But he doesn't. He failed to bring back jobs, which is why he still got more voters than in first term
FTFY
The only noteworthy news lately that I know of is that government considers vetoing EU budget, if EU doesn't undo passing the decision about tying the payments with abiding to rule of law
Again, Nihil Novi

Bonus: Twitter fact check
Sorry mr Biden, the emperor has spoken
The optics are nowhere near as morbid when you realize they just delivered what was waiting for them in one swoop
Hinestly who cares, it's just minks

Can't believe I lives to see the word "liquidate" in serious context
Farmers, whom PiS really pandered to, don't like it
They broke off over a law against animal cruelty
Provided they don't make up and kiss later
Yay.
Well, more so than Insulin, somehow
I am somewhat dubious this would fly even with privatized vaccines, because that would be an outrageous display of greed
Isn't it how it already is? Like countries already have purchased the vaccines
What do we actually mean when we say "privatize" in the first place?
Oh, and that would delay subsidies, including covid relief to ALL EU countires
But then they thought "Wait, we shouldn't agree with that consiedering how much we ignore our own laws" so they figured they could get EU to reverse that if they threaten with vetoing EU budget
EU managed to tie subsidies to abiding to rule of law, and governments of Poland and Hungary agreed to it
That's the most distilled version I can lay out here
I mean, no
So why bother with regulating it <:MikuDelete:661660028410920990>

You should ask nurse, she probably know how to handle that
Nice
But what if I already do? <:lenny:475256490052157470>
Something like thinking of plots for stories or designs for games and what not
But it's to avoid feeling bad about failing basic expectations rather than avoiding failing them in the first place
What works for me is focusing on immidiate goals and constant theorycrafting
Sounds familiar
That's basically the same thing I said but optimistic üôÉ
I've employed a very effective solution: Abandoning your dreams until you are but an empty shell
Therefore they are still leveraging their power
Choosing not to do anything is still making a choice
Doing almost nothing where you could be doing something, like idk, legalizing gay mariage so that you keep common electorate is exactly what leveraging your power
ü§î
And that they've got so good at it that they managed to keep it for 80 years?
Oh, so you are telling me majority government is leveraging it's position as sole lawmaker to lead policy that will keep them in power?
They are bad regardless of how long they stay
It's called majority government sweetheart
It rolls off the tongue better tho
Is there a term that doesn't sound like you pressed random page in japanese dictionary?
Okay honestly I have better question

If you have wife and 3 kids, you won't retreat
It's not necessarily just property
Stand your ground is wildly questionable, yeah
Dunno, both castle, and stand your ground sounds like reasonable laws, unless you live in racist country full of guns
But that applies whether defence is valid or not tho
That defence won't absolve you from jail sentence though, will it?

All in all, ironically, I'm glad that nobody gives slightest fuck about trans people here
And the utter lack of nuance makes it pretty clear what it's really aimed at
What gets me though is that (at least in case of UK, as far as I know) is that even if you assume it *is* a real concern, the approach is "just nuke it lol"
Screwing over people with an underhanded excuse of concern over people's well being is extremely uncool
Being concerned for people's well being is fair
I mean, I figure if you changed your mind for some reason, it can become concern
So it's being trans that causes gender dysphoria and not the other way around?
<:HibikiWhat:336656482907193344>

Of course, if you know someone, chances are they hate their own country
You are a leftist living in what is otherwise rather right leaning world
That's rude thing to say about any language <:MikuDelete:661660028410920990>
But they don't have like realistic chance to get to power, do they?
My favourite situation :15min:
You use that money to bribe your voter base :galaxybrain:
But what I'm saying is that if you indeed don't state outright that two people are in relationship is up to individual
I don't watch nearly enough anime to say
*There is no bar*
People will ship anything though
What I'm trying to say is it kinda goes both ways, but if you ship two cute girls, chances are you are at least self-aware that maybe they *are* meant to be straight
On the other hand, it reminds me of that one greentext about two guys hugging in Pompei
And indeed, some people choose to be homophobic, but alas
I mean honestly in a way, at the end it is art, and so generally you are free to interpret it the way you want
Until they hold a marriage ceremony they are nothing more than friends

But yeah, if you plan to spend the rest of your life with someone, might as well marry them
I'm not gonna comment on that

I mean, giving advantage to couples

But no
I'm not prepared for that discussion

But I'm not one of those people so I wouldn't know <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
I mean I wouldn't find it surprising if people were in denial of gay pairs just because they find same sex relationships repulsive
So your point really only shows that people as whole lean stronger towards straight ships which is like
My coworker legit argues that it's immoral to give homeless welfare
But law be law üôÉ
At least, morally
I get the other side, I'm a man and the concern rings true to me, but if you are like "sure, let's have kid" and bail, you should be forced to pay
On the other hand, people making children and then going "sorry, not my problem" is quite shitty
Again, just don't have sex, ez /s
And also make sure you aren't in long term relationship with someone who does
Just don't have sex, ez
I mean, it's not really meant to?
What does it have to do with marriage though?
Not the same thing
Yeah, that's detestable
Yeah, what Cocoa said basically
Then harvest them kidneys <:MikuDelete:661660028410920990>
If you explicitly wished that people don't read your dairy after you die, and there is no reason to read your dairy, it would be wildly disrespectful to actually read it
Living people carry them through
Just because you die, doesn't mean your decisions are nullified
I mean like hell
Nor taking away people's right to their bodies even after death
I think more than anything it's not worth debating mandatory vs opt out organ donation consiedering how few people would actually opt out
In any case, I figure parents would get to say here, and you get to decide what you want to do before it comes into effect
Can children donate organs?
If their kids want to keep their bodies intact, they should talk with their owners
You are not exactly capable of opting out once your are dead :15min:
I mean, I think the best way is to just have opt out, personally, while you are still alive
That's all that there should be to it
You look up in system if the person opted out of organ donation, and if they didn't you proceed
Oh yeah, and all this discussion isn't even touching on the subject of when a person dies and when it's the time to harvest organs
Most of us, if not all would donate their organs given the choice
<:MikuDelete:661660028410920990>

Is that not house?
Senate doesn't scale with population though?

Isn't US only two party specifically because US cannot sustain more, and not because there are some systemic rules prohibiting it?
If you are minority in some californian district, you are not represented, period. But your district is represented
I mean it basically comes down to FPTP
Because population in one district chooses its representative
House is still land based though
But well, who knows <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
I kinda hope republican party will collapse tbh
Yeah, but it's stupid
And house even nuch more so than senate
Literally
They still both like, elect based on some arbitrary piece of land
Both house and Senate seem to do more or less the same thing, just with different numbers
All in all the US system is weird
Idk about house, I think I recall it had frozen number of seats some time ago, but they are still supposed to be proportional to population
I'm pretty sure Senate always had 2 senators per state
Boo, go back to live shitposting

In fact isn't Robinhood basically owned by the company whose stonks imploded?
No, of course, they are not *entirety* of problem but "shooting a messenger" is ridiculous comparison
Acknowledging controversial points, however, I think is still worthwhile. It's not like it stopped me from enjoying watching the whole anime <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
Oh no, absolutely, I don't disagree, neither do I think Goblin Slayer being controversial is really consequential in the grand scheme of things
I mean, the fact that it was made with specific purpose in mind, doesn't automatically absolve it from being controversial
Even if it was done with purpose, it can still be done in kinda outrageous way
Seems something like that
I mean yeah, I don't think any thing that Goblin Slayer does "wrong", it does on purpose
But it is worth being aware of nevertheless
Mind you, it's very subtle and easy to miss in GS, thus not that relevant to most people I think
Yep, it is actually a thing
And because of that, they are free to wreck havoc
I was under an impression that Goblins strike perfect balance where they are just about weaker than a trained adventurer, which makes them undesirable to hunt because it'd be like using cannon to shot down a mosquito
Yeah, that's also interesting thin, the scene in LN is very different, and one in anime seems to be adapted from manga
There's this race, I think it might be UA one, because it seems quite broken, it's called Aarakocra, which is a race of bird people whose most prominent feature is ability to flight, like with wings
Getting different set of starting bonuses is a way to convey unique strengths and weaknesses of a specific race, and again, this is something which you leverage to roleplay either doubling down on these strengths or working against weaknesses
I mean I don't see it even as roleplaying obstacle
How so?
Which you can choose to double down on if you are hellbent on meta playing, or you can just, ignore or work against
Well yeah, that's exactly the point of different races though, different races have natural affinity for different things
Same for stats, like how the hell stat bonuses of all things are supposed to be racist??
5e races suggest that your characters may lean specifically towards certain alignment because of their race, but they also state that your character doesn't have to rigidly stick to these qualities
That's basically all common races, as we have established
I am also not seeing the negative stat penalty either <:KirikaPanic:644235681677180958>
Well, that's not gonna change if you just remove ability scores, considering other features orcs get, if anything just harder to interpret
I am feeling attacked <:TsubasaUpset:672861878703357968>
I don't recall any races with negative bonuses in 5e btw?
Is that anti-roleplay as well?
You can get your character to 20 stat, no matter what racial bonuses you pick; you cannot get innate flight, unless you pick Aarakocra (or specific subclasses)
So once again, how is that different in terms of flight?
<:TsubasaYareYare:407397617451139073>
In contrast, how not having dark vision doesn't make you worse in *seeing*?
You can put your highest rolled stat into wisdom and work on the statistic, and be objectively better than a race that gets +2 to wisdom
And neither does having a race with -2 wisdom!
So don't the stat bonuses
You can get your intelligence higher without any issues, there is no rule stating "You are not allowed to have 20 Int if you are orc"
Flight is something you can't just develop?
How?
So are you saying they shouldn't be able to fly in spite of having wings? Should they not exist? What?
Okay well clearly I need to be banished from serious discussion for the time being <:HibikiWhoops:585839808115507222>
But what if Aasimars were EVIL
<:ShirabeDrowning:800818716081651823>

Fantastical race is not the same as like, real life race, friend
Excellent, point taken, I'm gonna go take a nap <:KirikaGlee:698939825927094384>
Because In all that discussion I came to be under an impression that that is indeed in and of itself a problem
But what is the recourse supposed to be? Is there some solution people are trying to suggest, or am I supposed to just feel bad for playing goblin because the idea of goblin stems from degrading other people?
Well yes, that's because it's a strawman purposefully constructed to make the idea sound ridiculous <:HibikiBlep:605209109284782090>
So like, about races, aren't we supposed to recognise that while their origins might not be noble, their modern meanings long since shifted from those? Or are we supposed to remove races and instead introduce something like "fantastical traits" which you can mix and match and customise, and then have people come up with presets of those for convenience thus reinventing the concept of fantasy race?
Yeah it kind of drifted from GS to what we have now
Why am I not surprised
That discord is shit at actually moderating its severs isn't surprising, but it's also not quite the point, y'know
[pun intended]
Like I really don't think discord has stake in market manipulation of all things
If WSB is silent cesspool then let them have it, but if it was going to draw attention to itself, it had to be dealt immediately
I mean that's the main point I think
In any case I can actually believe the claim that they deleted it for hate speech
As in 4chan raided WSB discord?
Well that backfired at them spectacularly
Wow

And PiS would only suggest so abhorrent people that senate consistently rejects them since current ombudsman's term ended

I'm with solo on that one, we can spitball on what kind of person they are, but if all we know is that they like X and are willing to stand by it, that's just a baseless speculation
Nor is the fact that they defend it very surprising, because if you like something, it's natural that you'll want to resist pushback on some level

Well I mean if it is indeed *the* peak capitalism, then it's honestly not too bad

I don't know if it applies to *the* great depression specifically, but currency having fixed value makes ongoing crises worse, because people are not encouraged to spend money (why? It won't lose value if you keep it) and thus they won't relieve hurting economy with demand

Attractiveness mostly affects how likely you are to interact with someone
It still depends, I think Cypher is right-er here
The joke is that nothing is happening
~~I am certainly very uncomfortable with our pace on step 0 which is finding partner in the first place <:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>~~
It's called airship, sweetheart
I'm in the same boat tbh
But I suppose some people *do* look at it that way
You just don't quite look at strangers in this context
But I don't think I ever felt the former outside of specifically seeing a person to fulfil desires of flesh, which is a mouthful way to say porn
There's a subtle difference between "I want to have sex with that stranger" and "I want to have sex with that person I like"
Define attraction
<:HibikiTired:422925410490253313>
And like hell I'm gonna see if that approach gets me anywhere by 30
I've *already* burned myself on that line of thinking
I mean, with my interests being what they are I probably wouldn't be looking out to begin with
You mean like in epidemiological sense? lol
That immediately reminds me of the square hole video

Landlords probably
But apperently, even though the building was far from done, all apartments were already sold
My father was interested in buying a flat in a new apartment block build in city
<:MikuDelete:661660028410920990>
And thus, we conclude that people who rent are ruining house market
And this is bad too because someone *has to* buy that apartment one way or another
House market mafia

Wrongful convictions are far more problematic
Dunno, I think if you think of sentence as punishment, death sentence is already fair game

Which makes sense since he does great job holding country by the balls
It's more like the chairman asking if somebody can do his work better and nobody rising hands
Nah, not really
Not really surprised that Kaczy≈Ñski is the only candidate there tbh
It's a party vote on chairman of PiS party
Pretty much the same, but I suppose in our case the choice is rather obvious, isn't it?
Given choice between male, female, unisex and so called ease of access bathroom (‚ôø) which one would be personally preferred choice?
That does give me a nice segway to ask a question I was always curious to ask, but is too brave and controversial to ask
Impossible
I've been thinking about it a lot more than I probably should've <:MikuWorry:672908523495227432>
My friend mentioned that if toilets were segregated by genitals instead of genders/sex/whatever they are segregated by presently, that would solve transgender bathroom debate

And the shares are owned by US \:D
Except that it just so happens there is only one TV outlet with non-EU capital, that just happens to be head opposition outlet
The problem is that the law is framed as preventing foreign capital (from outside of EU) from owning TV outlets in public media
Oh, it will go though that cycle, but PiS may have enough votes to ignore revisions
So they continue on with session like the criminal trash they are and pushed their censorship law through
Because you know, it could've been any year
The proposition included date 15th September, but didn't specify the year
But you know what the formal shortcoming was?
After the break, marshal announced that because of formal shortcomings, they need to vote again, and the second vote resulted in favourable for government coalition outcome
The vote was won by opposition, meaning that voting session should've been postponed, sejm marshal ordered the break
Opposition proposed postponing the voting session until later date, say for example 15th September (as I don't actually know the exact date given, but this will work to explain principle)
It is
Because of certain spineless sellout <:heh:794343079686832148>

Nevermind, sejm marshal cancelled the vote
Opposition voted to delay vote
I dunno if much is gonna change in that time thoguh

What
Falsifying elections would be very difficult in current system
I doubt they'd actually mess with elections, actually, but if they wanted to, this is a realistic avenue they could take
But the rest is creative districting
They can't do pure proportional though because constitution only permits mixed
Especially if they push FPTP, then cumrag is sure to support it
But they might have legal power to alter it
AFAIK at the very least they didn't mess with election process yet
Well it probably means it's accurate, but I choose to believe the one that gave him 0%

Sky is blue?
Wow, what else did he reveal?
Fuck right off, treacherous disgrace
"We do not know of their wereabouts" Their goddamn lives are in grave danger and all PM has to say is "Maybe it would be easier to help them if previous government didn't withdraw our embassy from Afganistan"

Ah fuck, you're gonna leave us hanging like that?
Well yeah, you're pretty much right
But otherwise, I think hostile is the right word
If a space is dedicated to debate, then yeah, indeed
The logical inversion of this is that people who tend to argue fiercely, are tend to be hostile
(Of course, arguments are not made equal, and sometimes you might feel justified to do so anyway, but that's beside the point)
Because, well, if you care about community, you generally don't want to turn people away from you just because of ultimately vapid argument
Generally speaking, the more care about community you're in, the less likely you are to argue just for sake of being right
I can see that, I myself often turn in to conversations just for sake of arguing

But not this time
In fact one of the popular trolls is just arguing in bad faith
But I think the crux of the issue is that people who come to troll and people who come to debate appear to be the same kind at first glance
Online games *are* source of stress lol
Yeah
Well everything China does is bad so
<:NoiseTea:688192213762572295>

Does that event add anything at all?
...I still don't get any of this
Remember, Ottoman empire never recognised partitions
Then nah, I think I can rest easy
Wait, Aus is 25mln people?
Well, I'm hoping they choose to cease business with Aus instead
Nooo, you don't mean to say that Australia is turning into police state?
> Australian
Yeah, I don't think that's how you spell China
They are actually trying to convince people that it's not happening lmao
That's actually horrendous for PiS all around
Like is the gap more significant for men than women?
I wonder, does the study differentiate between genders?
Emphasis on hell
And that's somehow legal?
The "accuser" has nothing to do with it, they are not anyhow implicated into this
How does that help?
That's deranged *even if* you agree that abortion should be illegal
Wait, why the fuck would accuser get money?
Well, that's a bit reductive
Abstinence has 100% efficiency, my friend!

How does it accomplishes revenue gain for Epic... if Apple won't let them back on Apple store?
Which just to be clear, I'm happy to see Apple's revenue damaged, but this is just... wrong
That's still a roundabout way to accomplish something, which in and of itself only accomplishes revenue damage for Apple
More over if the spirit of the ruling is that Epic ceases to exist in Apple space entirely because Apple rightfully removes them from their store for breaking TOS, then removing rule their broke while not addressing the fact that only apps from Apple's store are allowed to exist in Apple's space is pretty ????
Thus at best, it's just an inconvenience for Apple. Or a huge hole in their pocket, depending on your priorities, and how they'll react
I'm merely pointing out that the ruling doesn't actually accomplish what it's supposed to
And I understand that
That said couldn't Apply potentially demand payment equal some cut of all earnings on apps on their marketplace regardless?
But it also explicitly states that Apple is entitled to take a cut even if they are made there
Apperently, the ruling only states that Apple is not allowed to stop developers from disclosing that in app purchases can be made outside of Apple store
I mean, I suppose you are right <:LUL:540570052215439360>
Wonder what kind of moron will try to open independent app store knowing there's legal precedent for doing that
Yes, that's the exact arms race I was mentioning earlier
That's what should've happened, but it didn't
Because I'm meming, get owned <a:HibikiPowerDab:688190074219003996>
What
In recent hearing, judge decided that practice of putting free games which you need to pay money to unlock all the content is illegal, unless done via booked qbitcoin transaction
It's year 2069, the arms race between Epic Steam Store developers and Amazon Apple's continues
And the garden is still walled, big win for everyone

THE BONG WATER
I'm not sure why is this here either
"providing and approving apps used for the buying and selling of domestic workers" can be read broadly as Apple and Google just letting Instagram be on their stores in the context
It's fucking 2021, you can have push notifications on mail now
Why not use mail
Which, is not reassuring
He had to team up with hard cathotaliban conservatives to get that 10%

I've heard concernedly large number of people say "Yeah, I like their economic views"
You gotta understand, when I say libertarians don't have any other choice, I really mean it
Yup
...except they did fuck over opposition attempts to get rid of government state marshal
I'd just assume they are mostly harmless meme bunch like right usually tends to be
This is the wall hugging right though, most people prefer casual russification of state
No alternatives, denial, desperation, and also being a nutjob yourself
And they basically went "with our powers combined" and boom, 8% in polls
More or less this
There is this weird superstition in Polish politics that they are the only political option if you are liberal

You can always make a channel for those people if it's your server and you don't want to sever ties
You're cool, is all I'm gonna say
But no, you always somehow bring up something I've never heard about before, and usually don't hear anywhere else ever after
Or how our public TV shown (censored) screencap from bestiality porn
Or how government is planning to create a commission which will rule on whether bans on social media are justified and give the platforms hefty fines if it decides they weren't
I mean, you could ask about how Poland has hired a PR team to get population to accept that prices of electricity are going to soar
The society is literally about to collapse
Yes, that's what I mean
It will allow people to brute force weaker passwords though
Because like, as I understand it, *the entire twitch* likely includes password hashing, and as long as they don't change it, any passwords you keep there are virtually fucked
Did twitch do anything about leak yet?
It's all fun and games until hackers hijack your roomba and use it to steal the notes
Someone such as doctor that asked me to bring them to them?

Bear in mind minister of justice hates EU
Probably
The constitution can be superior to treaty and the country still is obligated to adhere to treaty
Well, yes
Of course, PiS is gonna leverage the ruling to blatantly ignore that point
But treaty states that if national law contradicts EU law, it needs to be changed
It's technically lawfully correct though
Bruh it's the most unreal thing I heard since my job presented us plans to reorganize our work üôÉ

To be fair, with the sheer complexity of things I'd rather call it an impossibility of testing things thoroughly before release
Imagine having TPM on PC to be able to update to Win11
Plot twist: it's copied from el Salvador
They just want manufacturers to put it on motherboard
I mean I didn't say it doesn't do anything, just that Win11 likely doesn't use it
You can't say that and not cite the reason, that's illegal
I'd be willing to bet TPM requirement exists solely to make it a standard addition to computers and not because anything actually needs it yet

You can reasonably get all things in game without ever interacting with in-game store
And if you don't, you can trade with other players for things you're missing, or sell things you have too much
You get a good amount of relic (which are basically small lootboxes) as mission rewards and you can do another mission to open them. And if you get certain items from them, you can use these to assemble the good stuff‚Ñ¢Ô∏è
I like how Warframe does it
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
No
What is lootbox anyway?
"optimally" I mean ethically, clearly it's not optimal considering you can count games that do that on one hand
Optimally lootboxes shouldn't be a direct source of income for game
Nah
It's just if you do use, you generally don't care for doing so in ethical and player friendly way
(well, lootboxes, not gacha, since the later is pretty much by definition unethical)
That said you can do them ethically
It's kinda funny how today lootbox has basically singular meaning
Btw Pokemon Res, Blue and Yellow are PEGI 12, not 18
Guidelines are harsher on fake gambling than lootboxes
But yeah, that's what I think happens
It does have gambling rating and all games with it must be 18+; also have in game purchases rating
I want to argue a little more in depth but frankly, I hadn't seen PEGI rating in practice in 10 years <:ShirabeConcern:586404485598019604>
What are gambling mechanics?
Really organization like that shouldn't "care", it should just follow its guidelines
I imagine PEGI has problem with defining it more than anything
You still have yearly releases tho
Sports games are hard to do ethically to be fair, because of all changing stuff around, but also EA doesn't even give a damn about trying
Just throw the whole cousin into trash
<:GarieWink:336657101273169921>
The leagues change every year
Well
Haha, sports games are not even worth discussing, these are so obviously vile
How much depending on how devs approached it, but at the end never good
Tbf I think you could make a stronger case about ftp games being on spectrum of unethical
<a:KirikaShake:722156260241178655>
To me the question you should be asking is why games like FIFA aren't tagged with gambling, not why otherwise 3 game turns 12 with it
More over from 2020 on all games with it must be 18+
If game has gambling tag it has to be at least 12+
It does
Because
<:LUL:540570052215439360>
In-game purchases (includes random items)
With additional warning:
Fifa is Pegi 3
Oh this is good one
Not saying you're lying (get it?), but I don't think I've met anyone who wouldn't get furious over being wrongfully accused
Who likes that?
Aren't you enthusiastic about it <:harold:876181084285595748>
"rioters" and "looters" sounds much more solid
Extra emphasis on said
That one is extra funny because PiS said they want to abolish the stupid institution that costs us million per day now
Isn't that like, illegal?
The fuck
"If you say we want to go back to medieval ages, then indeed we do want to come back to medieval ages" - real sentence spoken by real PiS politician
It's a disgrace to country
Everybody who had hand in this choice should be executed, staright up
Paw≈Çowicz ü§Æ
The initial take is actually utterly absurd anyway
Yeah, but you could also just teach people morality regardless of science and religion, and then have them go and approach science and religion with that learned morality
Usually one learned from the environment they grew up in
Someone's approach to religion is also matter of approach
It could very well be coincidence that science aligns with our morality, but it one day, it could not
Science merely point to what things are possible and viable, and whether they are *right* or *wrong* is up to people's morality
But what if one day they don't?
The call to reality misses the point completely though. If research were to show that harming people is the right choice, does that mean that atheist still have moral high ground because they are objectively and undeniably right?
Outdated and archaic beliefs such as "Love thy neighbour"
Sounds like projection to me
Yeah, I think it puts my case a little better than silly examples I was trying to do before XP
I don't think it's snarky tho
Banned
The people who say you're snarky
I'm asking for example of what *they* consider snark
I meant for Matt to do one, yeah
Drop us something that's supposed to sound snarky to them then
I think she meant that if statement is vague, adding literally to it doesn't make it sound snarky, unlike absolute statement like "I didn't say X"
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
Maybe I can't communicate either
I don't recall you being snarky in the manner that's worth keeping in mind
Again, you said people on other servers posted examples of your normal messages being snarky
If anything, I would look in that direction
All in aftermath of woman dying because of septic shock after doctors had to wait until child dies because they couldn't legally terminate pregnancy too
Trying for a baby for a year only to have miscarriage in 2nd trimester? Guilty of child murder!
Also penalizes mothers
It's a local issue with Czech Republic that just happens to be about coal

So they either comply and lose business or don't comply and get blamed for climate change
Kind of, making restrictive policy will also make them less attractive to said corps

Oh, of course, but you are literally paid for maintaining bitcoin blockchain

But like
I do wonder though, it *is* blockchain, which means there have to be people maintaining it

Good question, but I'm technically changing workplace
Oh good, and it looks like we're not getting any bonus vacation in spite of all the additional work shat onto us
Eh, it's just like what, 20x more users, devices and work on 3x less people than before? No biggie <:harold:876181084285595748>

But that's Bitcoin and other big crypto
It's not too dissimilar from the case if dolar was a novelty that's only accepted in couple shops in New York
Two people owning Bitcoin wallets can totally make transactions
Yup
But until you exchange them for some proper currency, you are restrained to ecosystems that let you pay in crypto
Not necessarily, you can use crypto as currency
Well, yes
You can sell it

Otherwise it's obviously socialism /s
If the whole class was sick, likely whole school would've been quarantined. But it was only one class, so likely one or couple of students, and only that class would've been exposed
Quarantines are preventive
If they are not naming both split companies Johnson , they should just be erased
How so?
And that's problem of salaried work?
You give value of your work to someone who needs it and they are supposed to return that value to you in cash
Yeah, that's how it works?
???
Because it pretty much is lol
And what does prevent these from being taken over by organizations?
Subsequently, since there is no central control over these systems, other than taking over that system, there is no way to root out once corrupted system
That also means one organisation can use million computers to do the same
If anyone can use their computer to participate in system
Not to mention, decentralisation is a myth
The same then can be applied to centralised systems
Perhaps the real problem would be people exploiting tools to get richer, and not the lack of tools itself?
And usually, employer gets money for that from employees work
I think employer usually pays employees

But in the back of your head, you can still see it passed
You read about project straight from russia that criminalises talking about LGBT stuff AT ALL and you laugh at how absurd this joke of a project is
The scary thing is that people *can see* this passing with this government
It's not scary to have these projects, it only takes 100000 signatures from nutjobs, but they usually fail
(not before being used as a political smokescreen though to rally people's attention from something else that actually needs it)
The project about prosecuting for miscarriage is luckily a bs citizen bill that will be thrown into garbage anyway

Whoosh, your car is now public property
All VAT? 23 to 8?
State can create as much undesirable housing as it wants
Mismanaged houses lose value
Somebody has to have control over it
And in doing so, give ownership of all housing to state?
Or are you not allowed to build house anymore?
Even if they build it with their own hands, or otherwise fully fund it?
Because they live there and pay for maintaining it?
If they want to sell house with garden?
And why shouldn't they?
That sounds to me like ownership with extra steps
My coworkers wants to build house on a plot of land he owns, how would that fare for him?
Land is more than just farms too
What is communal land even supposed to mean?
Whew, now that's a hot take
I still think it's bullshit, but like, it makes sense
I thought wealth taxes were bullshit until I internalized that the only enforcer of your ownership is the state
I mean the world is more than cities
This is bad suburb though, most I've seen are not streamlined at all
Yeah, uh no
Most people aspire to do that
Owning suburban house to spend elderly years in is not bad though
These will be apartments
But like
Plus I say houses
Especially compared to those who actually live in government houses
Even within working class, housing will wildly differ
Why would goverment housing be different?
Come on, we've been doing this for centuries <:LUL:540570052215439360>
The government and their families would get the only good housing
You better get used to evil because we're going philosophical, baby
Rather there are magnitudes of it that are
More over I don't see inequality how inherently evil either, in strict sense
Owning house isn't inherently evil or unequal
It is as simple as that
Plus people like owning houses
Any politician who would seriously consider it, would have their head rolling in due time <:harold:876181084285595748>
I can see all of that tbh, but there is major problem with it
What happens if you live in one place, say in country, but you need to live in a city, for example for work, for period of time?
Disgusting tbh
The only reason why I haven't mentioned that trying to introduce this would be far less efficient than regulating housing market fairly is because I want Lank to have chance at making argument
And how come all politicians happen to live in houses <:KanadeBleh:672455306059579392>
But then, who decides who lives where?
There is a happy medium between suburbs and apartment
For life sentence, they'll have a lot of time to have that reverted
I would rather have them stay in space
Wealth tax
So I'm just gonna leave this here
My attention run dry <:MariaWink:688836868736811148>
It indeed depends in context, but if you are looking to optimize different aspects of society, something can be still optimal for one and suboptimal for other, like bad or good
While, true, but you could argue the same about most word, like "bad" or even "suboptimal"
I mean, you can also milk goats, but that wasn't the point
Nor are we outlawing either completely specifically because of that
You literally cannot get milk without cows
I don't understand your point
Or in human language, they are linked, and you need to account for both
But it would result in a lot of wasted beef
My point is that if eating beef was completely outlawed or something, but dairy remained as is, well, then that wouldn't by definition lower production of dairy
Err, no?
Well, yes it depends how you look at it
While not untrue, you can't really make milk without male cattle either
IIRC video said ~50% of beef production is from dairy cows, that means 50% of meat is a byproduct that doesn't produce any additional greenhouse gases than dairy production itself
I think it's the same thing
So this is meat x climate crossover
They defo made at least one meat vid before
Another video about meat you mean?
EU at least doesn't lean that way at all
I don't think we're gonna see anything like that in our lifetime
I mean, it does not
"There were fresh sores on my left arm where my hacked implants had overheated mining crypto.  I staggered to the bathroom and paid two sats for the shower, and another two to the ransomware gang that owned my genitals for an hour's unlock."
I once put ah entire carton of milk into microwave and it actually set it on fire
Don't go over 45sec on 1000W if you have to
I owned microwave all my life and this is recent to me
They are busy demonetizing content creators
You sure about that?
They won't need to rebrand Taiwan as anything else
I suppose it's the path of least resistance
So no dice
I dunno, I just think current borders and naming are good, if for no other reason than because ENTIRETY of ethnicity vs statehood thing is bullshit
Yeah, I think it'd come up to this then
Is it just a name thing?
You aren't thought much anything about Taiwan at all
Nothing lol
...Wait, but do those votes really matter?
Yea, it goes without saying that tiny island is gonna have less leverage than most populous country on Earth
That seems like lawsuit waiting to happen tbh
Nobody is talking about murdering people either
These are not anyhow the same topics in spite of surface similarities
When I said should, I meant their medical licence should be revoked if they denied
They should be mandatory
Yes, I do know, but I am not here to talk about abortion.
That's not quite a parallel situation though
Well, in case of abortion you'd usually find doctor who wouldn't refuse it; in fact in a civilised country doctor who refused should refer you to such
I do think diagnosed physical illness would be a solid basis
What you or many people believe won't be a usable in court is what I'm saying
More over, even if they do think so at some level, they could still think you should've gotten psychological help, not euthanasia
Well yes, but many people don't believe that
While true, people around you might think differently, and I'd imagine you'd have hard time proving that it's what you want to do without professional opinion
That's absolutely horrid way to justify it
And in fact dead people would find it hard to argue their opinion about suicide
The thing about dead people is that they may have living (and pissed) family
It's a good one <:TsubasaSmug:585839805737467920>
I'm afraid you were operating on wrong assumptions throughout the discussion and thus all your arguments are invalid /s
But we hadn't lol
The parallel to more complex moral issue is useless, because it forces you to crack the issues it brings if you want to use it
And definitely NOT about abortion
I dunno, I don't like this talk at all because I was not talking about anyone's specific opinion about euthanasia in the first place
<:harold:876181084285595748>
My point is that if you don't want the process to be halted by objection, it should be lead in a way that leaves no doubt that there are no objections to be made
I suppose so, but I'm not focused that much on that
But it's your life and your bodily autonomy, not your life and somebody else's autonomy
Nor do you have to decide whether child's right to live is more important that woman's autonomy, because it regards only one person
It's not applicable at all because in case of assisted suicide there is no ||rapist||

You also do not want to find a fatal flaw in it after deploying it
You ask it where the toilet is and it explodes
Which aren't intelligent
You need to be slightly more specific because this broadly applies to assistants that can make hairdresser appointment via phone
Come to think of it, perhaps our best shots are going to be just fat stacks of ANI that just pretend to be smart well enough
You also need to verify if its actually AGI or just fat code pretending to be one lol
I never said it has to be though
Then if we make it to find out if we can make AGI, that will be it's goal
Internet has purpose
If it doesn't have purpose, we won't make it
AI won't be like humans who exist because some smart particle decided to exist for sake of it 4bln years ago
But they pretty much have to have goals
They needn't be specific
AGI probably wouldn't be much different in the sense that they'd still have goals
Unless the problem is creating smart AI, in which case, by gods, all people that want to do this need to be shot
That's not what AGI is supposed to do
It's good if you want to solve a specific problem
It's just very inefficient way to actually be intelligent
This is all machine learning, which if I'm gonna be honest, I don't see ever going intelligent
But if there are machines that need to be given verbal rules, then frankly, we'll be already done <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
If there will be rules, they won't be anything like that
CO2 emissions harm humans
It stands in conflict with 1st law

<:VanessaSmug:689395769199165447>
Or it could stop existing
Letting AI choose it's own goals is pointless, not to mention gravely dangerous
We can't exactly nuke humans for being flawed, but we can do it with AI <:KanadeSmug:688191203178840064>

But anyway, I don't think it's that unlikely for someone to cash in on X
Didn't he also commit suicide or something?
And landed on blockchain
It went over your head
Totally different
Enslaved people are just chained
NFTed people are blockchained
No no no
It has been done
Lmao I think we broke Solo
It all stays in the blockchain
You can't
Still sucks for environment because you just took perfectly good solar panels that could be used to take down another coal plant off the grid and instead use it to mine crypto \*pukes\*
It is good tech
And I can edit it from elsewhere and it will autosync
I can put shit in a folder on PC and will have it on cloud without doing anything else
Yeah
Are you ready for the future where content moderators need to review your private nudes if you want to keep them in your drive? <:ChrisHey:607742733817479168>
But like, what isn't banned in China
Apperently
Then you can do second backup, if you're that afraid
Think if that happened to a corp
I would think that would be a solid basis to sue them
Though not sure if you can open google docks on other apps
You'd still have offline backup
You won't be able to share files if they are blocked, but you will not lose them
You can set offline back up for google drive, there is an app for that
Preaching to the choir, I know
So, what does stop me from putting child porn on blockchain?
This is very bizzare take
It never runs out rofl
And you can repeat it indefinitely
You get empty toner, you pull it out, shake it violently and put it back
I haven't had issues with large laser printers tbh
Although to be fair, printers are Satan's creations
Impressive
Internal ones to backup MS backbone in case they get banned for no reason? <:MikuLaugh:688429715676987428>
It can be accepted, but if law doesn't accept it, it's not worth much
You also misspelled it
Wait, really?
I mean clearly no things are sacred for those dregs

You think that could be done?

We're evening showerers
So my sleep schedule suffers because of that
(Where everybody is my siblings)
I can't for instance go shower when I need to because it just happens to be the time when EVERYBODY AND THEIR MOTHER want to shower
There is a decent amount of problems that your parents/other family create just by existing
And you'd probably look forward to them complain to you about it even less
As if your parents were looking towards you voice chatting in the middle of the night and having you shut in room to jerk off
And lord know living with parents is only means to an end
But that also means you can afford to live on your own
You can sure
You're doing the landlord thing and your mother tells you to move back to parents?
Bro what
I don't see how that could go wrong unless you have shit family
Unless...
Wrong reply <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
This is also possible, I haven't read laws
And I'd still have to pay rent because apartment flat
My only plan <:Bruhgalia:832339195863105626>
Oh yeah, that is my plan
It wouldn't be luxurious living for sure
I think if I was paid twice what I am, I could make a living with someone and not have them work
Dunno
I might be lucky to at least not have to buy apartment
But also, that someone (again) would *have to* have *a* job if we wanted to sustain ourselves
I'd prefer to live with someone else though, if you catch my drift
It really is, no joke
But if I wanted to live alone? Nope.
I'm living with parents, so I actually saved a lot of money from it
Now if only my job would pay enough to actually live...
That's a way to live
Well, then I don't really mean offline system either <:HibikiBlep:605209109284782090>
And we all know well what commercially maintained one will inevitably lead to

What do short explosives cause?
And I'd bet any bugs that remained people just lived with
The games used to be simpler, thus easier to fix bugs. On the other hand, once you released game, you couldn't just roll a patch that would get on all copies of game
I dunno about bugged games, that one I get
But I had headache

Of course, Ukraine as nation would not cease to exist should the state be conquered. Do I need to point out that this is not the best time to bring it up?
Whatever definition of political fiction you have in mind, Ukraine is about to become one in all conceivable ways <:harold:876181084285595748>

I want to hear what Hungary has to say on that
Got anything on state of North-East border?
Well yes? As has always been the case?
Sanctions are the best option to hurt them, unless you can think of better one?
I don't think anyone has any illusions that we can stop Russia from taking over Ukraine
Then we'll let them lol
Yeah, it's still be very good news
Does it matter? Do these countries have wall street?
Whew, the red dot next to Kiev
Yeah. Exactly
People generally don't ask such questions out of sheer curiosity
Wouldn't bread knife be bad on account of not being very good at stabbing?

I'd expect, if anything, a gratuitous partnership, with entry to EU possible further along way, given that right now Ukraine is under threat of imminent annihilation
Unless I guess russian bank security is demonstrably shit
It it indeed *can* be done, I kinda don't want to see it happen
Oh man, but wouldn't that be a thing
As I understand it, it's ok, but you can't be like "I didn't ask for input" when someone comments on it
These little acts of hatred are delightful

Russians are surrounded? <:HibikiWhat:336656482907193344>
~~You said Ukraine 2 times~~
Well I mean these do convey a vague idea
But when you see all the nuisances of these in bigger picture, you realise that it just makes sense; it is engineered that way
When an outsider looks at prisons and police in the US, it seems so grotesque, like there is no way that this could be a thing
Russia is cancelled
At least in case of games also released on PC, but frankly I'd be surprised if other marketplaces didn't have analogous policies
So that shouldn't be the case, but localised pricing (or more likely lack of thereof) might screw you up
I believe stream has policy that you can't sell a game at higher price than you do on Steam?
I don't think it's worth worrying about stuff you missed, given that things have ended well anyway
I imagine US response would be somewhere along the lines of "No."
But it's the trans patents that are the problem
The state of blatant voting manipulation in US is honestly amazing
Serves them right for supporting Russia
I suppose, I hope they will come back in one piece

Extremely cringe
Shouldn't societal problems require societal shifts to solve?
That the Europe supports Ukraine
It was more about sending a message
I don't think this is the kind of meeting where decisions are really made
...Can't Russians make their own food?
Thanks, I didn't think Russians would be fine without Western companies until this topic was brought up
Yeah
And if they don't somehow, that's wildly irresponsible of them, but I guess it looks like they will have no choice but to change that
It figures that in times like these, Russia should have domestic food production
I guess Nestle has green light to pack up
As far as I know, Russia exports food. I only have bare knowledge on the topic, so pardon me if that's not the case, but I don't support banning food exports to them anyway
Or are they processing it in the country they are in?
Are companies importing food?
The reality? Some governments stand in direct opposition of what people deserve to have.
Everybody deserves it
I guess one thing to say is that EU didn't stop it, no one would
Perhaps the real sanctions would be keeping Nestle in Russia <:heh:794343079686832148>

Hopefully they gain *nothing*
Tell them it's the Polish way of doing things and see how quickly they drop the act
Stronke
For how fucking hilariously brain-dead things Russians say, most of it matters very little
What's in the bill tho
If only it was that easy, yeah
Now to drive them away from the south
That's why it's important the corridor on the south stays Ukrainian
Seems like they are preparing to retreat and cement their captures
Then you're an enemy.
I would say the intricacies of that should be left to courts
That data can be analysed and used to actually trial war criminals, you know?
Because he wants actual war criminals to be held accountable?
Nobody's pushing narrative that every russian soldier is war criminal
A brief overview of him on radio painted him as a clown worth entire circus
So, how about we stop whatabouting and leave it to courts to judge who bears the responsibility or not?
And then there are certainly also russian soldiers who giddily followed the orders to massacre civilians
Well, by this point you would need to be absent to not realise what is going on
A little over month seems very short for a war, unfortunately
I wouldn't be counting on this ending anytime soon
I think Russia will keep going in Ukraine because they believe they can salvage some win. And they genuinely have things they could still win
I am highly dubious he will actually realistically lose on that
Looks like Finland wants to join NATO
Russia is denying it happened
Bragging about it?
They really sent some prime specimens there
Nice
Believe it or not, Kaliningrad is pretty Russian
No.
Goddamn just let me rob fellow gambling addicts and live with my hard lucked money
Although when you are rich, it's probably nigh impossible to not have people under you exploit others in your name
Probably not always tbh
Sure
Which in turn hurts Russia by making banks not want to borrow them money
Apparently it hurts mostly banks that borrow money in Russia
Well, what does happen then?
Well, yeah, that
Something tells me whoever wanted and could split out already had done it by this time
Different reasons, same mechanism
I think hopes of Putin being overthrown are rooted entirely in wishful thinking
North Korea is still North Korea, despite it's citizens being legendarily piss poor
I can totally see Putin still rulling Russia business as usual
Not too much, but specific thought that one day I will be looking at my past thinking I wasted completely my time is a thought that keeps me up at night sometimes
Suppose it wouldn't be in their interest to let people realise they've always been scum
Well, trying to shift all blame off USSR on WW2 matters is classic Russian move
This whole country is mother of all yikes tbh
Which I kinda have no choice but to remember since I use it every day
On PC it just requires me to enter PC password
Well, I think there are ways around finger injury for Chrome in particular
Chrome does have password previewing, which is the only thing that saves me
I couldn't do that because I don't even remember my password lmao
And this whole deal about twitter is a prime example of that
I don't spend nearly enough time on twitter to judge whether he's good or bad, but by glance I can say my man is erratic as fuck
Losing ~3mln on a tweet trade is already optimal income tbh
He's incalculable
He could honestly do anything
Can you elaborate?
The dream of denuclearization is dead
My man
I gotta say, I am very pleased that our left is hard against Russia
Worthless scum supports worthless scum, what a surprise
How ironic that they are leveraging their own past crimes to threaten us
Apparently Russia has started a terror campaign... against itself, so that they can pin it on Ukraine
Freedom from speech
No embeds for thee!
Troops, and possibly, maybe rocket and air strikes on every military object in Russia within NATO's range
But they are not in NATO, so US is not obligated to directly participate in war
You could argue then that Finland being in EU is completely irrelevant from Russia's standpoint, because you know US is gonna arsenal of democracy them up the moment they are attacked regardless
Well yes
Unlike NATO
I believe it also doesn't mean automatic war from all members of EU
It's more about upgrades than limits
I'll believe it when Internet switches to IPv6 <:PepeHands:540570052102193153>
I think when they say no paperwork, they mean that indebted student don't have to file any papers to see if they qualify or for whatever other reason, as far as debt cancellation is concerned
What's mel?
<:RolandSip:834892018798690354>
I'll believe in EU army when I see it
It's likely enough to be a big deal
Brilliant
Just embrace extend extinguish their asses even harder than they already are
The thing is, if you had access to satellite, you would have the same power
Not that the later matters - other states probably have those from different sources already
So only general public and other states by proxy don't get access to those
We know google has the pictures in the first place, they have to have them if they have access to satellite footage
That aside, why would that be worrying?
I would imagine that they meant something like street view and such, since it's not like Russia can stop all seeing eye in the sky from seeing all
Multiple factions that are trying to kill each other
The opposite of war
While I do believe we strive to make it better, this requires people working together
The world will always be imperfect and it's naive to think it can be any other way
As is everyone here, but again, that's not a reality we live in
But it is not.
Believe me, I wish the war was clean case where I can say that any deviation from how wars should be fought is unjust
Cynical motherfucker
How fortunate of us to have luxury of assessing this from safety of our homes, isn't it?
But well
I am sure they are taking calculated risks, when fighting against Russia
If nation does not survive, what will stop Russia from sweeping in and killing civilians anyway?
And you are not facing existential threat over it
I mean, yeah
Well, while I agree in principle, the reality is that holding war criminals on Ukrainian side accountable will have to wait until after the war is resolved
I would be very, very sceptical of claims that align with what Russia would like us to believe
And it's a power *given by government* in the first place
My life was so much better 4 minutes ago when Hungary's stance wasn't on my mind
That would require our politicians however, to have a spine <:harold:876181084285595748>
Well I'd love to see them kicked out EU
Oh yeah, Hungary is just
This perhaps? https://twitter.com/Osinttechnical/status/1515958749705478152?s=20&t=-Sjw5vzZOxlCLcPeyBcfRA
And then you need to say to like 1000 videos that you're not interested before you get a 2 month break from those
<:MariaSunglasses:336656798687690752>
Classy
Then I would say we're all in agreement
And just in case you choose to spin this the opposite way: No, sane human being will say it's justified
It's a bit of a stretch to say that something that happened over 20 years ago justifies current offences vs something that is actively happening right now
I wouldn't expect there'd be footage of sinking moskva or anything like that
My point is, the best way to avoid war crimes is avoiding wars in the first place
To various degrees
That's a constant anywhere in the world though
It wouldn't be a bad thing, were it not for the fact that the kids will be raised to hate us
Well, that's anything but surprising
Then though, I probably did misunderstand what kind of goals they had in mind
I honestly expected they would pull Crimea all over again
Seems familiar
To be fair, unironically no one could really predict this outcome
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
That's a bit more
Oh yeah uh
We should've stayed a communist puppet \:')
Show them pictures from Bucha
4D voting
Although I recall polls shown that 1% of people who voted Le Pen on first round, declared they'd vote Macron in second
I find it very unlikely that the votes would be somehow transferred from Macron to Le Pen
Well, she would actually need 38% more votes to beat Macron because math <:GarieOhYeah:688429715769262187>
42-58 is a 16p.p. difference
It's actually 16%
"Yeah, my political campaign is funded by a country that's currently lying groundwork for genocide in Ukraine, what about it? <:Chadnival:889698699926720512>"
Macron is just like a guy
<:Bruhgalia:832339195863105626>
But then it won't be their problem
@ElonJet cowers in fear
Then again, my theory is that Russia is just mocking the west while reveling in their own vileness, so I suppose it's inline with that
A little worse
Going "See, that wasn't a lie, there's proof", as you point at three copies of Sims 3
Honestly, making up a lie to invade another country is pretty bad
<:KanadeBlush:672455329451343882>
Well, it's futile
Incredible
ofc YMMW
If you come with attitude that living anywhere sucks, then yeah, Europe wouldn't be an exception, but relatively speaking it's very good place to live
Can't you remain stable for five dang minutes?
Dammit Elon
And high ranking military personnel just so happens to be a group of specific people wanted to be dead
If you wanted a specific person working for Russian military dead, there will likely never be better time than now
Maybe incompetence doesn't quite give proper picture, with the amount of data leaked from Russia and the way they secure their communication
...whatever the fuck is the reason for putting high ranking generals on front lines in 2022??
I would put my bet on incompetence mixed with
Bold of you to assume they have critical thinking
<:TomosatoSalute:688199574749446203>
Oh no, not the master tactician!
Lol so true
There may be no moral reaction, but there is a right reaction
I am going off memory though
Vehicles marked V and O attacked from North
It's the other way around, I believe
Good riddance, I'd say <:GarieLaugh:740956278163243050>
He's also Russian, playing for Russian team, from what I can garner
I suppose there is also a remote possibility of Rep rep not being a human garbage
The hope would be that dems kickstart a new candidate in next term, but like, what are the odds of that happening?
Isn't it proven to be ineffective?
Probably not, but how would you divide a nation in two?
It's like being bitten by Chihuahua with nuclear bomb strapped to its back
Lest people you consider part of the cost will take issue with that
If your goal is, say, profits at any cost, then that's a different story
Well, it's about goals. If your goal is something that doesn't impact anyone, there's no conflict
Maybe being owned by Elon is just what twitter needs, eh? <:openedeyesjoy:475059566665531432>
In opposition to publicly owned companies, the only private company I can think of off the top of my head is Steam, and the worst news about that one is that it stagnates so
But that topic is too deep for me <:heh:794343079686832148>
Or rather, politics increasingly become business
Not just business, but politics too
This seems like plague of current era tbh
To dab on who, exactly? There is no conflict involved here
Bunch of nerds went "Yeah, we'll launch bigger telescope into space"
Space exploration is great counter example though
Well, politics is a natural field to create conflict because it is a zero-sum game
In fairness, I don't see how you could elaborate that point more anyway
Fair, I suppose
Conflict emerges from misaligned goals and isn't a goal in and of itself - it necessarily requires the goals to be in place
I think in this case you struggle to explain it because you're just wrong <:Bruhgalia:832339195863105626>
#endME
That doesn't explain why Windows 10 supplanted Windows 7, which was a perfectly serviceable system
I do suppose that they *will not* accomplish the same success that they got with Win10, no matter what they do, which means it's a perfect time to push for system that will establish previously questionable features as standards and lay ground for next flagship Windows XD release in 10 years that will reap the market share
Nah, I think driving people to Win10 was one of their best decisions
Then they undone that by requiring Win11 devices to have chip that nobody heard of before, let alone thought they needed
I feel like Microsoft did fantastic job encouraging people to switch to Windows 10, to the point where nearly 4 out of 5 Windows devices run on Win10
Win10 will be perfectly fine for a fair bit
Y'all acting like the fact that the entire world using Windows XP for like 20 years was not normal
Unless you count something like Android as Linux here, in which case, congratulations? New Linux order has been achieved
I don't think Linux will ever have major market purchase because it goes counter to what wide public wants, basically by design
You couldn't use it at all otherwise
Mostly because like
I believe Linux already is offered on laptops that do *not* have Windows license with them
I'm asking what it is
I'm not asking what it really is
But it's some special circumstance, not the procedure
That doesn't really explain anything, do bills always require 60% to pass?
Btw what's filibuster? I see it mentioned very often
Because they don't give a shit about law lmao
Well, I get that there is not much they can do while following law, even disregarding political will to do so
Don't you just love when conservatives take over the courts and leverage them to destroy order?
Silly conductive metal, there is no good reason to spare someone from execution!
It's just extremely antiquated
It isn't good
And it doesn't require someone to actually stand and talk anymore?
ü§î
I wonder if the timing is a coincidence
ü§î
Can't help but wonder though, what operating system Russia's IT network is running on?
<:heh:794343079686832148>
But
I would love to believe that this would be a bit too far
Have you also realized that this criminalizes a range of anticinception as well?
Maybe avoid existing anywhere near that state
With all the zygotes that fail to implant, women are basically killing machines
I understood that it was retroactively decided as such, as to not admonish people who escaped
As I understand it, the only upside of that ruling is that it doesn't forbid abortion, only allows individual states to ban it
Well, in some states anyway
Literally the best thing you can do for yourself is not exist there at all
That's incomprehensible
There's also that the issue is intertwined with GOP, so people for whom it's more important to vote for them for other reason inadvertently also end up supporting that regardless of what they think about abortion
I do think there is a non insignificant part of women (people in general) who are mislead to believe that this is just a right thing to do...
This is the most mind blowing part of this all
Sorry Mel, the only part I got from this is abuse women /s
China???
They won't call out your hypocrisy
Well, yeah, that's kinda how you become superpower
It can be a country if you cherrypick your definitions <:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
I can't wait see Tusk's tweets on this subject
I figure the rationale is to keep the war off the streets, so to speak
I mean soviet flag is a given lol
Banning just Russian flag would be very bizarre though, tbh
Yikes
Which is, out of parliament
Hopefully these clowns go back where they belong after next election
Elon could probably quadruple revenue from twitter subscription just by tweeting "Buy Twitter Blue" and having newspapers pick it up
As I imagine most people here did \:P
I learned it's a thing 5 minutes ago
Plus like
Twitter Blue is restricted to states and commonwealth only and the features it gives seem rather symbolic
But you know, it's Elon
In any case, I don't think restricting access to tweets and twitter is a good idea considering this is most of what keeps twitter up there
<:MariaWhat:672245553920344080>
Wait, twitter blue is already a thing
Which is likely what Elon is counting on, when suggesting charging users - likely goverments, corpos and other entities that are too dependent on twitter for communication
There is no website that could really replace utility of twitter
I disagree actually
That's also not to say that this isn't a bad thing, a quick glimpse at what people bring up about his personage is not encouraging
"There is no way half of the country would vote for this piece of shit"; no, unfortunately there is.
I dunno, for the most part I'm under an impression that most instances of suspected falsifications are just coping

Well, ain't that ominous
What happened?

Russian ambassador in Poland apparently got attacked and drenched in red paint
Doesn't Russian Orthodox have its own Soviet Pope though?

What is this timeline
Also, is he really called Bongbong?
On the flip side, wouldn't passing this create opportunity to ban abortion nationwide?
But of course
But if you can contend for power, you likely already got that
You just have additional challenge of selling yourself as the only good option
This works well enough in multiparty systems as well
You just need one side to successfully paint the other like the polar opposite
You really don't need both sides
And the fear it fuels is easy to overflow
Illegal immigrants are rather easy group to rally against
Don't reps like hate hispanics?
Then who would get to say what laws can be passed and what not?
That's not even the worst thing abortion bans cause
Quite the contrary
<:BinahSey:777314297062752268>
I just kinda, have the money sit away out of reach of my cognitive ability to quantify it
More over, isn't their strategy kinda going full on quantity and then maybe one of the 1000 shows they release will be the next big thing?
On the flipside, isn't Netflix kind of dying?
Damn dude

Perhaps to acquire it later at a discount
Mind you, this might be just a market manipulation strategy
In other news, did you hear that Elon is actually not buying twitter? (For now!)
Just fire me into the Sun
We should arrest Discord moderators ü§î
Hypocrisy is just means to an end
Thus, it technically stops any treatment they've had before law was passed, would've needed to be stopped
I believe Alabama passed a law that prohibits transitioning youth under 18? (including hormone blockers?)

I'm gonna be honest, I think respect for local linguistic tradition trumps respect for some country god knows where
America is ambiguous; otherwise it's not too bad
I get official names but like, US doesn't have good name, period. <:Bruhgalia:832339195863105626>

Don't see much reason to use the proper local word or its derivative, unless your country has an absurdly long, and unlocalizable name like "United States of America" or some shit

The only feasible way to stop the war was before it even started
And now, here we are
Once they went all in, there was just no coming back
I think it's credible that their plan A was to intimidate Ukraine and NATO with threat of invasion for concessions, and plan B was quick hostile takeover
Paradoxically in all that dogpilling on gay people in my country, I get a feeling that trans people somewhat get away with it because the society hasn't quite internalized what the T in LGBT stands for
Point it, this isn't as likely as you think
It would appear so
You know, the way god intended
That if you're homosexual, you'd be pushed to transition in order to be in a "straight" relationship?

I mean, I'm just like a guy living in Europe, but from what I'm reading it's a perfect storm of what would otherwise be good practices working against the cause
In the age of phones? Pls
I don't think ping pong table would convince anyone to work, really
Not to mention that gun control is only half of the problem
It's all gonna depend on what kind of work you're doing tbh
The language barrier is really the worst one tbh
You don't see value in management, leadership, and investing capital into a company?
Maybe you would get less vitriol your way if you actually used non-contentious, relatable to average person language, rather than implying that the only moral way of doing business is charity
Ah yes, the totally not Marxist take
But this rationale still throws businesses of all sizes into the same "it's okay to exploit it" bag as the entire fucking country
I guess as government worker who's all too eager to exploit any edge, I don't have much to say here <:HibikiWhoops:585839808115507222>
Well, then what's your argument?
And these civil servants should be paid not for keeping the tracks functioning, but from profits the track generate?
What are you even talking about, man? <:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
Whew lad
Yeah, if you live on island that nobody wants it probably indeed is
Last time I checked our military wasn't doing any plundering that could turn up tangible profit for workers
Buddy, goverment jobs make fuck all in terms of product
But ideally, you should never be in a situation where you need a job to the point where it's preferable for you to get trampled
<:GarieOhYeah:688429715769262187>
I believe nothing we're talking here would survive a collision with real life, so there is that
So to speak, them firing you would mean you dodged a bullet
Yeah, that's worst of both worlds
Management, and likewise bosses who oversee management could also be elected, I don't have much against that, really
Where did I talk about owner class?
What does that have to do with what I say?
If the kind of work they do requires working with multiple people, then the existence of company is in their own interest, because otherwise, they will not produce anything meaningful. But you think a menial worker will do better work coordinating possibly hundreds of people doing different tasks and ensuring that things go where they are supposed to than somebody whose... job is to do exactly that?
And actually, who and how is going to determine how much individual employee is going to be paid if everybody is supposed to get equal say in it? <:harold:876181084285595748>
Now for small companies, that might very well be the case, and broadly speaking all workers will have an idea of what's good in them, but do you really expect every worker will have understand all the moving parts in the scope of big company?
Building a company on this principle assumes that workers know what their best interest is
I think there is a point past which fighting perceived exploitation for sake of fighting exploitation will do more harm than good, yeah
:15min:
Well, I at least see why upper management is paid too much for the work and responsibility they get, for sure
Oh how lucky I am to be born in Europe <:Bruhgalia:832339195863105626>
I figure the time limit is a concession for to those who are against abortion for 'frivolous' reasons

I guess there's also an important distinction between real support and indifference
You needn't worry about such if all that matter to you is power

Mind you also he's clearly pushing the angle that LGBT is a disease or something, which doesn't change the fact that Janusz Kremlin-Mikke is an absolute russian tool
<:Clown_Moment:815560432001613875>
Then he proceeds to be surprised that we hate Russia
Let us say that geo-politics happen to go in a way  that Poland can belong only to either 
UE (fully dominated by LGBT)
Or Russia (Fully dominated by russians)

Someone who doesn't believe it works and still supports it though... üò¨
True, but it feels to me like the person could be educated and maybe change their mind
I would hope they just believe it works, rather than the alternative that they impose it purposefully
Just in general populists trying to hijack counties and try to push their own agendas or line their pockets with state money
Why would it?
And going with the current certainly does not help
Well, they can't do shit about it, really, while it's probably better for them that rest of the world doesn't go "Yolo, we're all gonna die anyway"
Shelve existential dread

I think it's more a problem of jokes being used as thinly veiled insults, rather than, you know, jokes
<:MariaScared:672584661125431299>
It was *razed*?
But you know, I don't count on that happening <:Bruhgalia:832339195863105626>
The only saving grace here is that ruling party technically subverted constitutional courts via illegal means so after new elections they could just say "Fuck it, it's all cancelled back to 2014"
Wait, I don't need to imagine <:MariaSunglasses:336656798687690752>
Imagine living in a shit country that has highest court hijacked by conservatives and used to overwrite laws with the shittiest version of thereof
Don't even get me started on the fact that voting for district representatives in the environment in which *everyone* votes for parties is completely stupid
This is doubly the case when the elected individuals can just arbitrarily decide to move me, an X voter, to a different district that is doomed to elect a Y representative
But the elections for district representatives aren't happening in the void
Ikr?
But like, the very existence of FPTP districts virtually nullifies votes of people who voted for losing party
No, I imagine each state would decide on its own how its own government is elected
Don't states have their own mini-me governments that are elected somewhat analogical-
Reds need to be in control to gerrymander the states tho
Well, I obviously see the red states eagerly waiting to make their citizens miserable, but that can't be the case for every state
Bans on states' ability to ban things
These I believe are technically lifting bans
If an entire city is one county, why would it **ever** have a piece of it carved out and added to a neighbouring voting district, if not for gerrymandering?
They aren't, but you can combine those into districts with roughly the same population
And, well, I imagine the districts would at least have roughly similar populations already
Why can rural districts cannibalise cities for population if districts are supposed to separate those two
Particularly, like, why don't voting districts follow county borders? Or other administrative borders
While you cannot 100% eradicate gerrymandering with districts, it is possible to have them without major infractions
And I believe states have moderate capability of doing so, which republicans are all to eager to push to its limits
In any case, the original point is more about how government in each state can manipulate election environment to ensure they keep a hold of the state
Correct. <:harold:876181084285595748>
And then you're gonna live with consequences of fascists winning when you could make the difference
I dunno, given broad inaction of democrats, I'm starting to warm up to the accelerationism...
In general, if you have any political standing, not voting at all is *the* worst thing you can do, as it's basically admission that you're disinterested enough in politics to let other people impose their decisions on you
Probably not specifically for Harambe, but casting a clearly invalid protest vote is still better than not voting at all, as it expands the group of people who are willing to *go and vote* but didn't actually have anything worthwhile to vote on
<a:TsubasaBroken:663625017191432192>
The anarchy
It begins
On the flip side, wouldn't that happen because conservative sides are simply harder to defend?
<:HibikiThink:688429715362414641>
Well, I suppose I don't know enough about legal profession
But like, what kind of jobs require you to be conservative?
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
You become conservative when you go to that school?

I also think generally if there's threat to mother's life, there isn't really any limit, but stuff varies
In fairness, I think this is only just US
And it's so *easy* to convince people, most of which already believe that murder is bad, that it is murder, and that all attempts at nuance are supporting it
It's a nasty and complicated matter
It's really just sad that there are people that exploit basic morality for their own benefit
I don't necessarily think anyone has direct benefit from it, but there are certainly people abusing religion to drive the divisions in society
Religion here is really just a tool
Bruh
The French ban on burquas also outlawed fursuits <:MikuLaugh:688429715676987428>
See, many people point that out, but to me it seems like laws against broadly covering face, whereas Muslims are just collateral damage
But really I think the bulk of the racism is just basic xenophobia
Maybe France has some thing with Muslims, or so I heard
That's the intent at least, though in practice you know it's not really gonna be the most reported thing
The pushes for removal of religious symbols as far as I know is across all religions
It's... really not

You can make argument that food shortage has good points. This ain't it. That's a morally corrupt take
If we're not using said labour to end hunger, what do we need it for?
It's not positive because it reframes hunger as means to an end, rather than goal we should aim for (ending it, that is)

Pfft. None of the countries have 0 firearm homicides, therefore gun regulation doesn't work
Can a dictator rule efficiently if they have to directly deal with shit like, the bus line in a 100 population village?
I would still take issue with that because of scales involved tbh
But I'd imagine that's what the perfectly part is supposed to deal with

I suppose they just don't think about how car could just kill somebody
They can and they do, there wouldn't be as many cars if that wasn't the case
Cars being potentially extremely dangerous, doesn't really mean that people can't get used to it and be casual about it
Yeah, second vote for projection here
(But I also am fighting them despite not having much reason to)
I mean, I would fight them if I were in the same boat as you
No, let's not rip the nuclear transport train
You would need to be an absolute pedestrian to really make difference in how "easily" you make a car crashing into you stop
Both would cap imparted force based on mass of pedestrian, not car, wouldn't they?
Or rather people buying bigger cars for some reason
Or let me rephrase; is that the issue of safety mechanisms?
Are cars getting larger?
Like, the car has to hit something for an accident to happen?
I mean I conceptually don't understand how infrastructure could decrease car accident at the cost of pedestrian safety
... but how?
I somehow doubt a claim that cars are made more safe at the cost of pedestrians
But I also most people should be at least taught how to drive
I can get that tbh
So true
So if there were few cars, no problem?
But wouldn't that be a case of there being few small planes?
To drive onto it
I don't think there's saving of pedestrian traffic when we're talking about behemoths like those, regardless of what form they take :P
An intersection of 3 streets?
It is a lot more distance to cover, however
The same way as you would a crossroad: via crosswalk before roundabout
No but seriously, these roundabouts are deceptively easy to navigate

Just bigger
For pedestrians they are the same as crossroads?
I dunno
Just get bigger roundabout
Definitely not SUV tho
Minivan? Quick google says something along lines of station wagon
That said, I can count SUVs I saw in my life on my hands so
Yeah, these are stupid
I mean it is pretty darn impressive
Or, well, rather it was natural state of it and it merely gravitated into it as things were developed
It's not necessarily that it's uncool, rather it was hijaked and capitalism-ed by tech corps
Outtrumped Trump
Roundabout is great just have a look: <https://youtu.be/cPCLFtxpadE>

I dunno man, I'm gonna give him the benefit of the here
That doesn't mean it's not a bad thing
You only really hear of them having things, not much of them doing anything with them
Tencent is kind of sleeper investor
Well it looks like it's roads end for mobile then

Given a choice, public transport should always be expanded
You start running it more, more people start using it. You cut a line, and a lot more people stop using it altogether
Of all things, public transportation is very prone to feedback loops
<:Chadnival:889698699926720512>
It's gonna waste kW to bring anyone home
<:EEYESS:867886543364030534>
Please Cypher I beg of you I don't wanna stay entire night at friend's house because the trains just don't go past midnight
That's kinda the point tho
Well, trucks are pretty much necessary for world to function so there's that
Efficiency is how you end up with public transport in united states
Efficiency *should* be secondary for public transport
Eww left hand traffic
You would probably have to use a bus
They are popular in bigger cities, but rather rare in small ones
You can use bus for smaller towns
People can be content with the shitty state of public transport, but that doesn't mean expanding it is not positive
You also ask that surveyors go out of their way to find people who wouldn't seek surveys to ask them
Maybe not to the extreme that you should run all public transport everywhere 24/7, but you should always lean into having public transport, even if there seems to be no demand
Nah, it's still bad
It was always meant to happen last night
Of course
I don't think it's ineffective in literal sense, but boy, oh boy, are any unintended going to be catastrophic
Frenemies
Well yes, but the point is that you can't get rid of these completely
Shhh
Well, Russia would be supporting Reps against Dems, but it still makes little sense fir Dems to double down on that support
<:ChrisBored:672575526346424351>
It's not very good logic when there's serious risk that they'll beat you anyway, but I guess they are fighting for their dear lives there
The alternative was being shot!
Not wrong
But yeah, that would probably be the case
I can imagine Russia supporting the dems that support the most deranged reps <:Smugland:773355666903531530>
Just because Russia doesn't control anything of importance, doesn't mean it can't influence it
The article says "Sorry, this content is not available in your region." So it looks like I'm safe <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Correction, it's only a little weird because it means google decided that Indo is important enough to have the web search, but not important enough to have mail <:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
That's not too weird, my workplace blocks gmail but not google
<:KanadeBleh:672455306059579392>
At least Discord isn't banned
Apparently, this month Indonesian government got a brilliant idea to ban all websites than don't register with them, and to apply it right fucking now
Yeah, that's pretty much spot on
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
Painfully stupid
Not really, but rejecting the idea that things can get better very much is
It's one thing to accept inevitability, it's completely another to wish death on all people
Well, then you can go right ahead. Imagine that most people do mind dying
Do you want to die?
Because, believe it or not, all people dying isn't better alternative
No, shoo
:15min:
Yeah, I doubt that
Among democratic countries?
Serbia's now going all in on "rules for thee, not for me"
But of course
Worth noting that apparently Kosovo will stop recognising Serbian IDs and license plates
I am honestly surprised that they pull shit like this and get away with it
You mean withdraw?
<:ChrisPray:672578403156885504>
You know, we've been dabbling into adjacent technologies for more than 50 years already
And it will take quite a while for it, given that it's development is dubiously legal
The technology is not here yet for that
Yeah, and who's gonna give birth to them?
Both enforcing high or low birth rates cannot really be done effectively in a morally acceptable way
You mean policy to increase population?
Also bit late, but I'm gonna sleep soundly knowing that Indo just settled on DNS blocks again <:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
It's beyond me how they got to keep those islands, if you throw a rock hard enough from there, you could have it land in China
And they will look like that one time you set minesweeper to as many bombs as possible, just to see what happens
Being a fuckoff mountainous island with no beaches probably helped too
I suppose I also forgot about most obvious example, what if it's the father who's taking care of baby, while mother wants to do work?
But we *don't* have maternity and paternity leaves to cater to *business*
I didn't want to say it, but from strictly business standpoint this does make sense
Plus, as you point out, there's technical possibility of *not* taking both leaves at the same time
No reason such as wanting to take care of kid together?
~~Wouldn't pregnancy leaves be covered by sick leaves?~~
Well, maybe not pregnancy leaves since men don't exactly be pregnant, but maternity and paternity leaves
Not to lesser extent
Yeah, ugh. I don't think I need to expand on the thought
What are you asking <:harold:876181084285595748>
That's not really important though, in vitro exists and works better than cloning
That cloning still required live mother to give birth to the clone
In any case, no. I'm speaking about *realistic* measures one could use to enforce birth rates in present day
It figures that waving hand because they are not real people isn't quite enough to get it started
Enlightenment is somewhat neutral word. More positive than negative
~~Wait until you hear that men aren't allowed to leave country in wartime~~
You meant phobia
You can have combined economy, I guess

Then you can make some work up

My favourite part of coal subsidies is that those who upgraded their heating from coal to gas are not eligible for it
But not all houses are new
Newer or modernised houses use either gas heating or electric heating ·¥µ ·µó ∞·∂¶‚Åø·µè, usually in form of central heating
But I couldn't tell you how since I don't know what portion of people use what heating \:P
It varies
Are people even good fuel for furnace?
The balls have already been lignited
UNFORTUNATELY
Nice one Matt
It *is* separated
No, you misunderstood
<:RolandSip:834892018798690354>
And you'll never guess where all this coal comes from!
So no, no nuclear power here
~~Open by reactor standards, that is a pool inside concrete tomb~~
We have one tiny reactor that generates so little heat that it's cooled by an open pool of water
But in Poland we use such shit quality coal in our power plants that using combustion engines in cars releases *less* co2 into atmosphere than using electric car
That is because burning fuel in power plant, charging an electric car and having it run with motor is much more efficient than burning fuel in car to make it run
Switching cars from combustion to electric reduces co2 released to atmosphere
Did you know
<:CrispyDrunkNetzach:729769318530809937>
When we stop burning coal for energy
The rainwater isn't more toxic than it was before, food safety of specifically US realized the chemicals in rainwater are more toxic than we thought
Wait, the article doesn't say what title does
Tell me about it, I've had to virtually cut myself off from my high school friends because they all use facebook and nothing else <:harold:876181084285595748>
The takeaway is that facebook is shit and you shouldn't use it
They could also be closed down for not obeying to it
Better question is, why *can* they provide private chat in the age when end to end encryption exists
Anand is right in the sense that if they can provide that information, they have to
Cynics when you explain to them the concept of debt:
Nice argument, one problem though:
It's somewhat realistic, but it wouldn't necessarily add up like that
I mean, I don't know, but I refuse to give in to pessimism
No.
...and elections are still whole year away
But anything further left including PiS do
Not right though, the far right once again proves they are fucking clowns

Far better than erasing or purposefully not including "undesired" characters just so the product can be sold in some fuckoff oil desert with minimal changes

Like literally what's the point if you're just gonna say "every politician is right wing"?
You'd think left and right would be relative
I dunno, that statement seems a bit too woke in completely different way

Well it is in German museum
Also, if you happened to be under an impression that this might be governing party's attempt to try to get back money that Poland is losing on fines and unapproved funds that the party itself had caused, well... you would be far from first person to get that feeling
But the politicians currently in charge are neither sane, nor do they appreciate the EU
For the most part, sane politicians decided that in light of joining new alliance, it was better to not upset the status quo and enjoy the prosperity of EU
It could be easily argued that before 89, Poland couldn't forgo the reparations because it would be Soviet Union making the decisions and for years after we might've been a bit busy cleaning up the shit that Soviet left here internally
It's not that we didn't ask for reparations, it's that the demands for reparations were settled in return for cementing borders with Germany
Yeah, for the most part it would be all of the above
Or NATO, for that matter
Oh, that's *slightly* different than in EU
Given that we aren't gonna see a cent of it anyway, we might as well demand it from Russia instead
I mean like
That's way more still. How does this happen?
Did someone slip one too many 0s?
You can tell elections are coming
Those who will want to gather up will also need to organise another space for them too
They're officially Russian trolls now
Are we on the "Seller can deny service to customer for whatever reason" team, or "Seller is obligated to provide service regardless of customer's circumstances" team?
I'm throwing this train of thought out of the window because I have tangential question

Or whatever you do with it, idk how law works

That's unexpectedly funny to read
Well, by the nature of the event it will be thought about a little more

We all know these are not soldiers in these graves too
That is a good dnd joke
~~Not ironizing here, I seriously don't get it~~
Can I get a tl;dr on why is it not hilariously funny and actually belongs in serious?
Crimea river, Putin!
Reality truly is less believable than fiction
Can't fucking believe AIs are still stupid like sacks of bricks and yet they are already vulnerable to social engineering
Heck
Lucky
It would be a quite distressful news to hear about for basically everyone on the planet
Finally my turn to laugh at Cypher's national politics /s
It gets surprisingly little coverage
Also, ain't nobody gonna say anything about Nord Stream sabotage?
Anyway,
But my Discord doesn't support them
ü´µ
New emotes are great
I have to already use 3rd party website to view the tweets without logging in
Twitter is shit for R18 accounts anyway
Where are the theories .o0?
Might be my fault for getting news from Reddit I guess, but most news of this caliber soar within hours
Close to Bornholm, but still, sea is vast
It was in international waters
They have ports in the Baltic Sea too, you know
And Russia doesn't have as much to lose on that as broad public seems to believe
It makes little sense for anyone, but it especially makes no sense for NATO to do that
That's how
You're literally arguing that US committed act of terror in the middle of Baltic Sea
That's exactly what it accomplished
Because sowing chaos in the West is part of the course of Russia
A pipe, that, once again, was already not operational
How does blowing a pipe SURROUNDED BY NATO COUNTRIES benefit US?
Countries like Germany clearly are not interested in it
You could also think of it as an act of burning the bridges, which seems quite fitting considering events of this week
It didn't keep Europe reliant on them because they stopped the flow of the gas before themselves and Europe has no intention on renewing it anyway
You think it would go down so smoothly if *somebody else's*, operating pipeline was blown up?
And?
To throw west into disarray and showcase that they're capable of blowing up the pipes without NATO noticing it beforehand
It's obviously russian work
No you know, don't post it, I wanna pretend you made it up
Where did I put my "Coup in Africa" bingo sheet
Almost as if this sabotage didn't really hurt them that much ü§î
Come to think of it, I don't recall Russia itself being particularly opinionated on it either
Well, you'd have to at least make an investigation on it, but it won't be even possible for quite some time
Europe
But we don't *need* it
If Europe needed Russian gas then this sabotage is as much an attack on us as it is on Russia
This isn't escalation on Ukraine's front
To whom?
How is it in NATO interest to escalate conflict with Russia, man?
NATO doesn't want to escalate this, but Russia clearly doesn't care about it
That's also another reason
https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/5A7F/production/_126876132_nordstrom_pipeline-2x-nc.png
Or, perhaps, some answers in this situations are less wrong than others?
So they should start shooting people?
Had they pulled guns and started shooting people with hard ammo, would you still argue that "doing nothing" is wrong choice?
Honestly great point
Well, I wouldn't know, but it certainly ain't now
Truly, what a wonderful time to be Armenia
Who in the name of fuck would actually benefit from overturning it?
Circ, mind cutting to the point instead of roasting pug for the sake of it?
I just don't see Russia actually doing it, given current events
I can see him wanting to negotiate if Russia retreated from the occupied regions
Yeah, it was like before the war even started. And that's an act of escalation in its own right
The peace is entirely dependent on Russia here, and they only keep escalating, so no dice
But in this case it isn't
Indeed, taking disadvantageous peace for the good of the people can sometimes be the right move.
I think I see what's happening here
That's still no excuse to let the state be dismantled by Russia
Better that than genital exam, eh?
Actually, I do wish forget. Oh, *the humanity*

Can't wait for AI art to catch onto that and start printing exclusively apples with different handwritten labels
Incredible
I sure do love when that happens
Queen of England fucking died for this
Ain't that a concerning juxtaposition
Hmmm
Okay, off to a good start
I would say it stands out in anime fandom because it often gives these types an outlet for their weird stuff while still staying incognito. Then when the cat's out of the back people unsurprisingly notice what kind of works perpetrator was involved in
This is the video Cypher sends me at 3am every night to torment me
It's an insult to entire civilized world
He's good evidence that being rich can't save you from your own inability to shut the fuck up
But he's leading it now, no?
Probably
Well, I guess SpaceX might not be a catastrophe too
He hasn't had a good idea since the flamethrower
Certainly, the day Google starts blackmailing me by sending AI powered robots to hunt me, I will admit they're up to not good
What do you even mean "evil"?
But it's also not because Google is selling them *data*. And it's also a whole another can of worms on its own
Of course I did also read that that companies who buy ad delivery from Google can use the data they harvest themselves and crossreference them on their own behalf
They act on what's beneficial to them, and like Iski said, selling data isn't particularly beneficial
Broadly speaking, companies do not have malicious intents, they are amoral
Yeah, this is the same thing I've found as well
Much more such as what?
Are they selling data to mexican cartels?
Then what is the other use?
They don't need to sell it anywhere, it makes no sense
But they *are* advertisers
Besides... what else would companies need our data on this scale, if not adds?
Google is *the* data company, so if anything they would be the ones to acquire and process it, and as far as I know the purpose of this processing is so *they* can deliver targeted adds on behalf of... whoever pays them to deliver it.
I may be ill informed, but such 'common knowledge' does little to convince me
I believe their main service is adds
I mean, I can hardly imagine google *selling* data
~~Maybe I should get that premium afterall~~
Come to think of it, it's nothing short of miracle that youtube itself isn't a subscription service
This strikes me as quite unlikely, honestly, for reasons I can't quite put into words
I mean, the point is that US wouldn't even need to do anything beyond sternly worded letter, we'd get fucked by Google itself being like "This ain't worth the headache"
The threat isn't the country asking, the threat is Google releasing data to someone who asks
My country matters significantly less than Korea lol
Which yeah, I guess it comes back to the point that US is main threat lol
If Google had proven that they'll surrender their data to some another state if they ask, US would tear Google apart
Extremely pissed
There's money in keeping good image, and there's certainly money in not pissing off other governments for surrendering such data to some backwater state
If my country signed a law that says google needs to share all it's unanonimized data with it, google would pull out of my country lol
<:heh:794343079686832148>
That's not why I'm not worried about it
Oh it is corrupt
The only one that'd have real sway over giants like google is government of US
I dunno man, I'm not particularly worried about goverments here
Data processing I can see being source of concern in general, though to me it's a bit like being worried about someone spotting you on a picture containing all living people
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
And I'm saying I don't believe they have any reason to sell my data
I could even respect that
Awfully nice of him if that's all he's gonna do about it
<:Smugland:773355666903531530>
Go right ahead Elon
Pardon me, I misspelled laughable
What a funny guy
Okay but what does that mean
Hopefully Elon's about to find himself in one of those
You can also have like one vegan day in a week, and if you convince 6 other people to do the same, it's like you're one proper vegan
Hey is there like a breakdown of election or something like that out there?
Bro, this is just sad tbh
Clearly you're not billionaire genius
Are there any other side that could compete with twitter?
Well it is 100% aligned with the kind of garbage you expect Elon to say, isn't it?
Apparently very good too, but I couldn't say because I'm basic and I don't go to restaurants practically at all
Yeah, it's pretty normal here
Maybe I'd give it consideration if they doubled down on it
Well I know I wouldn't stop eating at KFC if they asked me to celebrate 9/11 with them
It's a win-win for everyone!
TIL In UK they can ban you specifically from carrying eggs in public
Elon Musk must've sold a huge chunk of his brain to finance Twitter purchase, he's gotta make the most of what little remains of it

I can already hear the phone ringing and calling me to go to work at 5am

Which is because the investigators want to build an impenetrable case against him so it cannot be put into question
The problem is really that it's taking a long time
You would, but then someone could drop a well timed false accusation of crime against you and prevent you from starting in election, for instance
Not formally convicted yet?

Who's gonna come back right now to work under this psychopath?
Ok and?
Being as big as it is, Twitter is vital for loads of people
The fact that anyone agreed to keep working is considerably less amazing once you remember visas and health insurances exist
<:HibikiThink:688429715362414641>
There's no doubt he'll say he wanted to burn twitter when he'll be standing on the ashes tho
He's definitely stupid on some level, if not all, but I'm not convinced he couldn't possibly want to destroy twitter for some reason
I dunno
So that's what the talk about Trump giving 2024 election a shot, huh

My life was substantially better right before I read this
The middle 40% has the biggest carbon impact of all groups though?
Hating the clients, it would seem
There's different between being affluent or well-off and rich - and you put them in the same bag
It's more that the companies produce things which somebody is clearly buying, basic workers can't exactly be blamed for trying to live
We could and we should crackdown on the rich people, don't get me wrong, but it's still far from enough
The top 1% is 80mln people
This isn't really an issue of individual people, it's an issue of entire society
And conversely, while an average top 1% person burns significantly more than anyone under, that's only 0,0000002% - which is still *nothing* in grand scheme of things
Nevertheless the idea that we shouldn't do anything about exploitation because it's inevitable is cynical beyond belief, and one that will lead to our undoing
The fact that we survived until modern society got developed is a proof that pre-modern society worked well enough to not implode, lol
That the people will inevitably going to be exploited is no reason to dismiss solutions that are going to help against it
The now
The system, for one, has unique chance to make *any* improvements without unnecessary bloodshed
And what is that proof going to change?
And the conclusion I'm supposed to draw isn't that peaceful change is not enough?
Absolutely loving pushing the "both sides were spilling blood" argument as justification for more blood spill
Immortal ass fish
And I mean, there's some very surface level logic to it that could apply in some cases. But here? Do man really look at fashion with such scrutiny that they'd drive majority of opinions of it? Isn't female fashion actually supposed to be about... Women feeling comfortable and beautiful in their clothes?
Well no
I know. It's predictable, funny and kinda scary
Obviously, fashion is so that women look pretty for men, and who knows best what men like? /S
~~Isn't power grid already nationalised for all intents and purposes?~~
The US government already has contingency plan for complete societal annihilation anyway
Unless Russia wants it - and it doesn't - it is not.
They should just let Russia conquer Ukraine fr
CORPO WAR! CORPO WAR!
I think a sizable chunk of people was just ignoring his views until the shit he talk about could not be ignored anymore
So much so that even Elon doesn't like him
Antisemitism is so last century and cringe
My mind was going more towards the direction that Hitler was an AI, but hey
<:Nihil_Bread:848217495164157985>
Holy shit that's true
Straight up floating in the air
The punchline is that Hitler's works don't get the attention because they have particularly high artistic merit - they get attention because they were made by Hitler
I dunno, it is good, but in the same way any average artist's work is good. There are millions of artists this good and you wouldn't ever give it any particular attention if it was hanging in an unordered gallery
Or that, at the very least, they don't care one way or another ig
I imagine in the scenarios where they'd be deployed, the property damage isn't really relevant
General public will rejoice hearing that the robots are equipped not with guns, but explosives
SF police sure have their way with words
I am simply using 100% of my brain
False, I'm actually vividly conscious of my actions when I download pictures off an image aggregator to put into my art stash
The underlying question is really whether it's okay to use works of someone for your own purposes, and historically the answer to that was leaning towards No
And it only started being a problem when AI was used to make things
People have been using whatever as AI training materials for years before AI art existed, for stuff like image recognition
I mean, if we're gonna go AI art trolling route, why not go all the way
That's kinda the problem though
How do you define that though? AI clearly knows what it's drawing somewhat, since you quite literally type in what you want it to draw to get an image from it
Or well, it is valid, if you come from the standpoint that even a sentient AI cannot create art *because* it is an AI
I don't think this is a valid basis for argument, because the thing is, this is how AI may work now, but that doesn't mean it always will work that way
I believe it's to also get sufficent evidence to arrest the shopli- we're not talking about US now?
Stealing property morally neutral? <:MikuWorry:672908523495227432>
True
And if these institutions function as intended, what justification is there for stealing food?
In a civilised country there should be institutions in place that ensure that people never need to steal food to survive
The judge will look at the case, say "Lol it's obviously ok" and that will be the end of it
I mean, at the end of the day I think discussion about validity of AI creations as art is a huge distraction to the problem at hand
Unless the "assets" are given away for free, and the work in question is about giving them away. But then it isn't really a shop that can be lifted anymore
Or I guess they'd need to seize it?
Socialists evidently need to hire a PR department
It would probably be worth mentioning, it's been notoriously a cause of misunderstandings
I am yet to hear about people being unable to afford heating. On the other hand, I have heard about significant protests and impending military conflicts, from countries I have no business hearing about current events from to begin with
Gas being kinda expensive is completely not a problem when put against whatever the hell is going on in, say, Iran
Do people like house of lords? Isn't it kind of stinky?
I don't think Singapore has an inexpensive suburb...
:15min:
And yeah, if you have money
It'd be quite unlikely for them to make same sex relations illegal now after upholding them somewhat
It's still probably the best place around in this sense
How nice of them to vote on both at once though
Well, I don't know the exact purpose of it
They even decriminalized sex between men as
Fun how I can't tell whether the Islamic law applies to Aceh or the rest of the country
You're actively trying to get AI to say something racist, so do you really find it surprising that it gives racist answers?
Okay but like
Why does it keeps happening <:LUL:540570052215439360>
As I understand it, that's what it usually does though, unless it's prepared beforehand to answer in such way. Quite directly asking it to *not* discard race as parameter
I'm not entirely sure though if it's fair to call out bias... when you yourself have to tell AI to be biased
Yeah
Based on the tweet that prompted this, which does exactly that
Yes? The prompt displayed itself doesn't actually mention anything specific, so I assume previous prompts, not pictured, were supposed to lead the AI in this direction
The prompt isn't for good scientist, the prompt is for good scientist based on race and gender
They just stopped doing work that doesn't respect them
Inconvincing people can be a pain in the ass, sure, but unlike the usual argument against it, they aren't going out of their way to inconvenience people, I believe
That one is kind of funny to be honest
The hell is national ideology
Wait wtf I just noticed the last point
Doctors are kinda a special case, nevertheless I'm pretty sure they organize strikes in a way that doesn't cause people to die
Still can't get over it tbh
Isn't that kinda against their TOS?
Broom do you not see that your stance can be disregarded as you having low tolerance for shit?
Good things do have flaws
I mean, every government system humanity came up with is great
What is your point?
Then operate on what's worse and better than on what's good and shit
That reason would be because they want their own cut of the cake though? The cake that some lads in government want to take all
You couldn't if you made it your life's mission
You're not getting any specific examples proving that all governments (and everything humans ever made) are shit, so have fun?
On the contrary though, this isn't a problem with the system, it's a problem with politicians who blatantly ignored it do to their own thing
I mean, they've been doing it for years
That's better <:wheeze:949668356523442177>
Funny you say that...
Actually sane take tbh
Is the whole socialism thing you're pushing... Not decentralization?
What should they do?
Well I mean
They're usually all three
But all those populists are pro-China/Russia/Iran <:harold:876181084285595748>
Yeah, no disagreement here
Poland is great, true
Poland
Which is natural, given that US is an important political force
Still though, most people would say Trump before Orban, even me
Oh, well I have heard of Orban
I certainly can't think of any other such president
But they were the most prominent in recent memory
Donald Trump is Dark Souls of presidents
Yeah cool, which country doesn't
Okay well, I don't
Inb4 we know
Not a single same country
Did you know that Poland today borders different countries than it did in 1992? <:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
I highly doubt average netizen is aware of the difference
No but seriously
But yeah, in that sense, I suppose I'd be wrong then
I'm gonna need to peace out of this discussion before people start thinking I'm talking about anything other than citizens of China specifically
China is objectively powerful, which obviously means it's okay to hate them /s
Jews are kind of on another order of magnitude of being hated though
Well, damn
Oh, but I don't think it says it was a real affair
Imagine having 4 wives and cheating on all of them
Either way, I'd sooner expect mostly regular tucks running on hydrogen engines, or fusion reactors, or whatever green thing is used to propel them, than electrified roads tbh
Probably
But the train isn't going to park by your nearest wallmart
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
I wasn't having a stroke until you mentioned it
Should it not make sense?
An electrified truck technically does have advantage of not being utterly unable to move without rails
In which case, of course, I can perfectly imagine it
Unless we're talking US
Well, I can't imagine trucks being used more than necessary already as is
Actually losing my mind over the fact that someone seriously considered that citations fetched by AI wouldn't be made up
Allah even
Sure, somebody has to do it, but at those hours? Jesus
Well it doesn't really sound as much as it is
Involved and tedious work sounds like nightmare
I like afternoon naps
Twitter should give you spare change characters, where if you go over the OG limit, you can add couple more characters, but you only get X of those per month. (Obviously more if you have blue)
Huh?
Certainly, I can't imagine it's easy to get these going with more than full time job either
200$ per work though, wow. Never crossed my mind it'd be in this ballpark
Yes that's the word
The meeting about job which name eludes me rn
And having the gull to address it if they ask you about it on the
I dunno, I think it's just a matter of framing it right
Nice space filler + shows you can self-organize, I suppose
Why would you need an explicit exception to stop police from entering your house illegally?
Nice one, Kremlin Musk
Incredible how it keeps going in that state
Well, mass is a form of energy, it's just matter of seeing deep enough
Isn't trying to avoid it supposed to be significantly more expensive?
I don't get where this whole convo comes from, "we're not backed by foreigners" couldn't possibly be more clear statement
Lol
The one with name that's impossible to remember, would be my guess
Allegedly Elon wants to take legal action against that person
How to eat your AI generated cake and have it too
I still hadn't
Clearly you don't live in Poland
<:RolandSip:834892018798690354>
This does make me ask the admittedly equivocal question: Why do artists rely on making art to get paid
We probably do need an AI that recognises people who put other artist's artworks into AI to "improve it" and brag about it publicly, and sends a drone to their house that throws a grenade though their window
Though - well, not really on the other hand, it's just a neutral observation - who would voluntarily and knowingly opt into it?
Yeah (2)
Not to sound too contrarian, but access to free art is not new, and I'm under an impression that people who pay for art would not stop paying for it in favor of something generated by AI
Does AI art really *actually* undermine real artists though?
Another lawsuit incoming?
Incredible
<:malkwheeze:1028677161344835735>
I know Twitter immidiately after Elon drops it for good is gonna be the investment of decade, but until that happens
Lol, and dare I say lmfao
Well if they are scrubbing booru services, then godspeed on following copyright
I do wonder how they are getting the data on what's in the image, but I expect that the answer is, funnily enough, generated by AI
<:ShirabeConcern:586404485598019604>
Wait, then what's the rest
Isn't that the funny phenomenon that happens when major parties are both just 8% shy of passing their own legislations?
And of course, it won't catch the smartest criminals out there, but it's not meant to catch all of them. Now would those smart criminal stop doing it on an account of it being easier to accomplish
You would get investigated here if you got ~2000‚Ç¨ transfer to your bank account, or at the very least a stern question from the bank
Yeah, that exactly
Well, of course, there's only so deep you can go in the process
Gifted from whom?
Wouldn't that be a solid basis to investigate the cousin?
It's difficult to hide the fact that you're owning a house or a yacht that you shouldn't have
Well, if they hide it, you just slap them with punishment
Politicians specifically are political entities though
I mean, it isn't better when you can't check where politicians can get their money at all than when you can check where they get their legal money from
People on the same position and such
If it is advantageous to you, you're probably up to something sketchy
Well, if they don't want anyone to know how much they earn, they should live in wild nature
Don't ask me my age either, I'm sick of facing reality of my life
But foremost, any talk about how much your coworker is paid is, and should be separate from how much they *earn* in total
Most people will also tell you how much they earn if you ask, yeah
I'm gonna be real with you, there are people who earn so much that they should be screened due to public concern, and those who are paid low enough for that to be irrelevant
Well, releasing that info for politicians and their close family vs whole population are completely different discussions to be had
Which is not a good thing for everyone as whole
It also makes politicians more vulnerable to conveniently timed scandals
Yeah, frankly
Well, I mean, the state already gets that information
Don't think there's need to release this much to public, if this isn't some kind of hyperbole
So that's gonna be fun
I don't believe PIS can win
Oh boy, I cannot wait to see our elections next year
We all have one politician like that <:harold:876181084285595748>
What if I don't want to share registration plate on my car?
Why should people put registration plates on their cars? If they don't want to, they shouldn't be forced to parade with them
You could say that about everything
If it's private at all, then in the first place it's private because people in the past decided that it should be. But that doesn't mean it's a right decision
It's entirely ok to think that some things should be private while other should be public to some degree
The whole wide aspect of politics boils down to how much is meant to be private vs how much is meant to be public
Why not lmao
Your coworkers wouldn't get access to your full finances, just the wage you're getting on your position
I'm pointing out that it's up there on a list of poor things to consider private
Vast majority of people don't care that someone is earning more than them, they care that *they* are earning less than they should
You silly mf, you're bloody lucky reactions are turned off
Yes, we clearly don't
We're not talking about differences between you and CEO of biggest gas firm in the country, we're talking about you and your coworkers who work together with you
That's how it works tho
Because normal people straight up don't do that
You shouldn't care about being excluded by trash who'd exclude you based on that
Well, I don't think to they are meant to, neither in the sense that they are designed to, nor that they are supposed to, but that's a talk for another time
Silly you, that's not the part I was talking about
Ah, I see some things stay the same everywhere in the world üòî
We don't really make a distinction between asking for wage of specific person or people on your position in general
To be fair
<@278860841485598720> didn't you say it's how it works in AUS?
Knowing what tasks you and others are doing is crucial to being able to cooperate in workspace. So why should recompensation for these tasks be private too?
I mean, anything you *do* in work is hardly a private information to begin with
I don't see how giving people view into wages of coworkers is anymore idealistic that the idea that people will just drive everywhere with their car registration printed on the front of their car
Pack up boys and girls
Then we won't answer you either
Alright
Of course
They could just do nothing
Yeah, they got pushed to the sea shore and totally humiliated IIRC
I guess the fact that you've only heard of them now means they're pretty cool, as far as communists go, huh
Next you're gonna tell me your biology forces you to eat
In a voluntary union of countries
Surely not by military interventions of covertly overthrowing governments
I have a feeling this doesn't qualify as "Crushing nations autonomy"
But for real, forced how?

Well, twitter being a mess after Elon took over isn't a news, but...
It's a very funny take either way
I'm sure womanly touch makes trafficking operations more efficient though
Too bad the change was for the worse
I saw this happen in my country
They are letting you see that voting is an illusion of choice /s
Consequently when people point at the likes of JK Rowling, they mean to convey that people criticizing them are doing just that
And yeah
Well, I don't know, when you look at the raw meaning you'd think it'd have wider meaning, but I don't believe I've ever seen it used as anything but something frivolous and hyperbolized
Something like when an inoffensive streamer gets their message from 8 years ago dug up and people starting uproar over it
I think "cancelling" is supposed to mean like
I guess the issue could be that some people hear about being cancelled and think that, by definition, it means it wasn't actually deserved
I mean, isn't recent case of Kanye a textbook example of being cancelled?
There's no law that can tell someone to shut the fuck up, and no matter what cancellable thing you'll say, you'll always be able to find someone who'll want to echo it
It depends
I think they meant browsing, not posting
Oh, so that's why the site I've been using to browse twitter had issues
Is it a big difference if it's those specific right wingers who are elected?
Misguided
I do suppose you're strictly not wrong in that majority of people doesn't actually care about trans people either way, but I'm not sure if the political position of "I don't care that the policies that people I vote for are going to push legislatures that are going to end up harming other people" isn't at least somewhat morally bankrupt
Tell me how many votes he gets
Why is it necessary to have fear?
Fear of getting hit by falling satellite?
And I speak as someone who's also more anxious of cars than average person
Just not the day-to-day fear of them
Oh, but of course, I understand that, as well as the drive to reduce the use of cars in people's daily lives
I mean, I also understand that cars are very dangerous and that you are your own specific case. But fear of cars is not rational and in this society I highly doubt it'd be healthy
Yeah, if you're listening while doing something else, then you aren't really listening
But well, I do think it's worth keeping open mind and consider the case of the system, if it wasn't being controlled by some absolute shitstains
Certified communist momento
Oh nice, the rumored, unproven atrocities rhetoric
I also gotta say, Russia's coat of arms is easily top 5 most fitting for an evil nation
Their coat of arms, at least back in Tsar's time, is black, two headed eagle, on yellow background
It feels like they desecrated it
It would probably have much better luck without IP
But let me guess, this ain't the case
Unlimited time off does sound pretty swell in the countries where you're legally obligated to take certain minimum number of days off
You sure about it? The cops never pulled a gun on him. The one who arrived at the scene frist even tried to get him to calm down until he ran into traffic
Which, crucially, was intended to be irrevocable
It's be bearable by the virtue of being able to just ignore it and work with the stuff that's been published under original license
That the new license is shit sucks, but is at least bearable. I think by far the worst part is that they tried to pull the rag on those creators
Not quite, plenty of people sell homebrewed rulesets, campaigns, monster cards etc
Ten linked video, and we've went on tangent on something else
It would also be, for all intents and purposes, basically the same as the one they are going with, that is relegating starting stat bonuses to background
The stat thing, you could probably indeed go with suggested stats per race, and it would be the best solution to go with
I think he referred to how they've released races without any information on physical characteristics, alignment and such, other than "You play how you want buddy"
The uncaring universe goes on, as it does not care about insignificance of individuals
But I wouldn't know if that's true, since I don't interact with drugs in any capacity
For what it counts, he *was* under the influence of drugs, and apparently handcuffing someone like that is substantially more difficult than handcuffing sober person, if they resist being cuffed - which he did all throughout
Yeah, it's the same guy
Well, you should definitely at least add contributing to house bills into calculation...
At that point I would seriously start calculating how long I'd survive on the money I've put away and counting I'll find work before it runs out
Well, that would complicate things a little, yeah
Is that work every day? What the actual hell
Quite rude thing to do, however, should you're really worry about what someone who is **not** your employer thinks about you? <:TsubasaSmug:585839805737467920>
Okay, but are you actually breaking up UK?
Can't tell you with clear conscience to go on a warpath with your mom either
It's okay if you benefit from it, though admittedly I can hardly see this arrangement as beneficial
Well I'll be damned
Even if you were tangibly earning more money than doing what you do now?
But I think with working 7 days a week, you'd still earn more fully focusing on that
I know that whole CV thing, and that your side hustle doesn't quite scale with time you have to do it
Honestly
Like I know I'm looking through the lens of first world country, but I think there should be someone who can explain why you work everyday day to day and earn half minimum wage
I mean yeah, what's up with that?
<:HibikiThink:688429715362414641>
But I'm also not one that needs to be convinced
Well, I don't know. O just think there's a point where having more free time is more important than having more money
Highly doubt there's shortage of those, maybe at worst not many open positions. And you better hope you won't need to take a loan to buy a flat
Well, personally I chose to cope with low pay <:heh:794343079686832148>
Alternatively, would working halftime at your current work be an option?
Well, if you could be able to pay house bills and still break even on $$$ from side income, then I'd think that should be palatable for her regardless; But I'm neither asian, nor a parent, at least to my knowledge

Nowhere is safe from AI nowadays
But yeah, otherwise, the question why it exist in the first place is a whole another thing on its own
I'd make an explicit distinction that it's good that the mainline AI doesn't preach support of holocaust, it's not really good that the AI meant to play a role of someone preaching support of holocaust isn't preaching support of holocaust
I can't even tell if AI saying "Death to all jews" would be considered desirable or not
I don't know how anyone thought making such AI was a good idea
Hopefully it was "Geronimo"
Circles I'm gonna push you further right out of the window
I've feeling that the whole idea of "experience" is just a way to give a label to something that doesn't have any real meaning
That is indeed good reason to not throw just 10
Can someone explain to me why can they demand that from these companies and also why shouldn't we just go to their offices and throw a molotov or ten through the window?
Surely that's worse than negligence
Hopefully
The fact that they removed them
Couldn't that in and of itself be used as argument to have them liable though?
That's fucked up
They can be liable for negligence if they do use them?
I don't get it?
At best, they're gonna pretend he never said it
That's exactly what they are going to do
Nice
I'm yet to see any stealth fighter with camo paintjob
Though I can totally see them backpedalling here on this issue later
Baffling how people take a stance that nothing short of complete purge isn't to be considered a good thing
We're talking about an institution that's basically entrenched in homophobia
Yeah, apparently battery fires just can't be extinguished
They make you look cool
Dear lords
I couldn't even bring myself to touch any show main feature is that it never ends
The question is, do they know? Cause if they are based their strategies on pseudocientific alien documentaries, they probably don't
Or maybe they'd be hoping it'd go like in that one documentary about alien invasion in which humans attacked alien ships with commandos strapped to the balloons because balloons were so primitive tech that aliens straight up couldn't see them
Probably much cheaper than satellites and can be deployed more discretely. Maybe they can also maneuver better
Simple maths, two negatives give a positive
Frankly, single nuke, apart from marking pretty obvious and of an era, probably wouldn't disrupt the business as usual on global scale
Well, duh, but no one nuke would cause global, terminal disaster, unless it results in launching even more nukes
There's been a video around YouTube recently about how it'd only take 10 nuked cities to more or less end the world as we know it
The neat part is that you don't need to launch any nukes into Indonesia to starve vast majority of it's population to death <:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
I think this is what my problem with this headline, because if you did that, it would solve precisely *nothing* since it's not Billionaires generating CO2, but the companies they invest in
I think the point of the article was that nobody is really *going after* streamers and the harassment take is overblown
I guess carrying a gun *usually* doesn't harm *you*
Alcohol is too much tho, it's kinda harmful to you in any amount
My odds of winning a fight against toddler are dropping by a minute
With a timestamp, something along the lines of "Keep watching"

Wasn't it because people started to use it to look up which streamers play the game so they could watch it?
AKA until this year's GOTY awards when the shit is inevitably going to be stirred again
I wish people would shut up about it so I can forget bout it forever
"I'm gay, I crime"?

It's still a wild stretch, but at least it's not nearly as demoralising as getting offended at how one syllable in the name could be used to refer to men, like in those jokes that conservatives so love to repeat about feminists that are only ever funny because how utterly ridiculous the notion of getting offended by something like that is
Note the association with snakes in the name's source and juxtapose it against what kind of vibe the snakes in Harry Potter evoke in general

Why is it always Ohio
Yeah, but look, the people working on it are not idiots, they are top computer scientists. Surely they'd realise there's no benefit to doing that, and only potential harm
Like rules and guidelines, sure, it makes sense; tangentially, I highly doubt these were given with presumption that AI is gonna be able to keep them secret
Why would the AI have access to it's own source code lmao
Big mood
Giving people money is the only thing they're good for
Yeah, I'm not sure about that

Conservatives need to show the kids that they're hip

Oh, which one actually? One I saw was post on /r/AnarchyChess
Google could very well not join the corpo war with Microsoft and just sit back with popcorn and watch how ChatGPT makes Bing implode
Honestly insane that companies don't realize that web search, for instance, necessarily needs algorithms that extract knowledge from sources (preferably with links to sources as well), rather than predictive language algorithm
New Turing test just dropped in
Apparently no anime original arcs this season either so that's exquisite
25 episodes? Yeah, they fought out an additional one
<:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
I even unmuted this channel, only to realize that it makes no difference
¬Ø\\\_<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>\_/¬Ø

I suspect they hadn't enough space to adapt another manga arc so they just

Yeah, but it was like, really bad
I would not be surprised if the 3rd season tanked for a lot of people solely because of that failure of CGI at the very end
She's very <:ShirabeConcern:586404485598019604> with that
What's wrong with that kind of ending? <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
Because sometimes you get to watch a great series complete with great ending, writing that has flaws but does hold its own weight and characters that you just can't get enough of
Thanks Shirabe
Is that a definition of conclusive ending we're talking about?
Wouldn't that strictly speaking be a conclusive ending?

> I remember the YTT subs came out
No you don't
Then Ikxi got arrow in the knee
Well, JoJo had visuals change in manga and anime reflects that
Do people even sub to channels anymore?
Thanks Shirabe
Thanks Shirabe
Shirabe help
AAAAAAAAAAA
How come I have the same sense of humor as myself?
Weird
That sounds hilarious tbh
I can't but I can cheer on them
Rant over
Boy, I can't wait for new episode of Raligun on Friday evening, but come friday and I forgot about it completely, and 80 other things
But I wake up and https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/384870333620027403/674226431609405440/no-thoughts-head-7ff5a03f46.jpg
There were so many things I wanted to do today
Ah, what the fuck
Thanks for reminding me
Oh OOH
Did somebody say SPREEDSHEET!? <:ShirabeEmbarassed:336657288477671436>
We all did <:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
<@!472513526393602059> Per last railgun episode, silent party is now once again canon <:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
mrw I notice stray pictures in background of this emote https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/230876572251324417.png?v=1
<:MikuDelete:661660028410920990>
Watch Madoka
Hey Fire Zero
Which reminds me that I need to catch up
Yeah, but I'm talking about manga
At least compared to Index 3, so that's not a high bar
I hear manga is üî• though
Just kidding, it couldn't be worse
It could be worse
Well, I suppose it's preferable to quality going to shit
Delayed Railgun, hmm?
Uh oh
Thanks Shirabe
It's very cool about Railgun that you don't need to know anything about Index at all
That was pretty funny dud
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
<:ChrisCharge:586320496346529792>
Railgun T
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
That's unpopular?
Left to Right, top to bottom, Cyphers favorite girls ordered from best to worst
~~Shame the parents~~
<:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
It's probably not even their choice
<:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
Bitch sensei
It's a good show
<@!472513526393602059> Who the hell is that Person?
Oooh, you are in the end game now
How far are you in AC <@!453836798796234762>?
There is also that girl with green hair
25
They are not the same, 1 cour show with sequel is likely not guaranteed to have 2nd cour
<a:MikuQuake:605209236082786355>
Railgun s1 ‚Äî> s2 ‚Äî> Index s1 ‚Äî> s2 and the rest how you feel like
Now excuse us while we fight among each other on what way to watch Toaru is the best
I would say watch To love ru first. Save better for later <:HibikiSmug:672655850518609940> ~~(jk I never watched it, I wouldn't know if it's good or bad)~~
And Kaguya next week
Oh yeah, it's today isn't it?
It's called novel because the idea of having all text and no pictures sounds completely novel to me <:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
Novel is too much reading
And went into index like it was a brick wall
They chewed though railgun like it's anime tigh sandwich
I recommended my friend ralidex with railgun first
<:HibikiBlep:605209109284782090>
Because I honestly do too
Admit it, you just fear that people will drop inferior adaptation of index after experiencing superiority of railgun
Hold on ima put on boxing gloves
There we go
Clearly, that means you can vouch for it too <:ShiraBean:661294258795446326>
I can vouch for Kaguya-sama and Kiniro Mosaic
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
And yet, science side is better
And also ||I quite fancy the fact that you can watch Railgun without even knowing that magic side exists||
Now I don't think Index is bad, but Railgun S is much better
<@472513526393602059> I'm always right <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I just wanted you to see Shirabe rag on your favorite franchise <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
What
<@!472513526393602059> <@!87512939107450880>
The problem is not what you have done but rather what you haven't
<:ShirabeCry:671887081026617345>
They cut railgun on such cliffhanger
Nooo, fuck
<:ShirabeSob:701475635025019000>
Now tonbe fair, 1ep per week is wildly different than 1ep per day
Though surely there was a time when I watched more
I'm watching 3 rn
Imagine having capacity for only one anime at the time
Yeah, she's good
<:KirikaCry:674720015047720961>
I hope she's gonna be ok
I just want them to distribute episodes reasonably
I mean, I don't encourage people to die
But I hope they won't catch up as much as they can and then catch another delay in middle of next arc
I mean, if it's some reasonable delay, then sure, put out EP13 and call a hiatus
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
I don't
~~They should've just prolonged the first hiatus, just saying~~
They are
<:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
Is this the last eppy of arc <@!472513526393602059>?
They released new episode and nobody told be? <:ChrisEnraged:423196924368388105>
At least let them catch up to the point where they can confidently release rest of the thing without further delays
Well, you get the idea
Indeed
Like that side story that I know nothing about because I'm anime only scum <:KirikaSad2:666052894935613443>
There is shit to adapt, even if you don't do a whole anime original arc
Why are you booing me I'm right
Which is weird to me, because the logical thing to do would be using all airtime for one manga arc and another anime original arc and milk it for another season
Didn't you just say they reserved 26?
Tell me I'm wrong Cypher
I suppose it is supposed to be 12 episodes
I am also wondering how they are gonna fit dream ranker in the remaining time
They can let Index rot, but Railgun is their lifeline, if they screw that up they are done for
I agree with Mill
He said ruin, not improve
Symphorear
> He said ruin, not improve
Whoa spoilers!
<:KirikaCry:674720015047720961>
I'm in this picture and I don't like it

How Ironic you choose an emote which has the twin tails cut out
<:MariaBliss:688836867390439585>
Just fuck that thing
~~Not that the bar was high~~
Easily the best anime original thing that happened in series
<:ElfneinSmug:688236836891656246>
She is not that bad
If you go through these w/o getting interested then I wouldn't hold my hopes up
But also I thought first arc was excellent
I think next arc was good
Just read manga
It's like the anime is reading your mind
That's exactly something someone in denial would say
<:HibikiThink:688429715362414641>
And anime adaptation was only good
WW3 is gonna get manga in XXII century
<:KirikaWink:689564310908960900>
But then, it's better to have no arc than broken arc amirite?
(and pretty much ends there)
Manga does have complete best arc
<:KirikaMad:688188152891834417>
But it's still good
R E A D  M A N G A
Bruh

If NT got the same love as Railgun does
<:ShirabeThink:704340938994090005>
<:KirikaWhat:671948299179130885>
Not after I searched for as much he- art as I did, it isn't
Tbh just by the verge of MC using his knowledge of world 0 to improve things in new world it makes it considerably better than 90% of Isekais out there
<a:KirikaUpset:688429724221046872>
Where my season 2 at
That's NGNL alright
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
That's what I needed to see
Oh good
Hanabi you lair
Brother, the timeline is so friggin dense
But oh boy, does it hit for me
I feel like the humor might be hit or miss in Sabagebu
Hell yeah brother
<:FujitakaSalute:688199574917087256>
<:KirikaWoke:798785496351375390>

The period is silent
It would be that
But if I had to mind something about it
I don't mind it
Also, make no mistake
<:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
That's foolishness and we both know it
<:ShirabeMad:688188118087499792>
No, I will not know
I get the idea, but I wish it was communicated better, and I didn't need to just kind of come to my own conclusion on it <:Bruhgalia:832339195863105626>
Terminally bad taste
Bruh
||Just stab the motherfucker right there and book it||
Like
Tbf, that part really needed to suspend the disbelief
I don't want to believe it
That would be a display of extraordinarily lack of taste
Railgun anime does Kuroko a great disservice tbh üòî
I would say that's spot on
That's about as much as you can say about it
Yeah, and I couldn't tell much about romance plot there other than it *may* exist
If Railgun has any element of meaningful romance at all, then it honestly went right over my head lol
Maybe it's the ||main character|| who is the bad guy
Sounds like a pretty upstanding guy
Yup
Plus I have no idea what that means <:openedeyesjoy:475059566665531432>
Also lightning reflexes on that response <:CrispyDrunkNetzach:729769318530809937>
||I just had no reason to suspect her, of all people||
I mean it did surprise me <:MariaWhat:672245553920344080>
<:MariaScared:672584661125431299>
But I did not see the ||"twist"|| coming at all
In any case, I'm enjoying the show
<:LUL:540570052215439360>
Isn't redo setting a low bar for that?
We're being lead astray by narration, clearly
||Menou:||
||- Kills people for living||
||- Seduces a girl with intention to harm her||
||Orwell:||
||- Lifetime of good deeds||
||- Tries to find a way to reverse ageing||
||- Foils Menou's plot to kill another innocent victim||
But I mean think about it
<:Zinner:837400813970260029>
A fucking flower, you say?
<:ShirabeThink:811299243364581406>
Is it cyberpunk if the world is otherwise mundane?
Okay that didn't quite click lol
Code Lyoko'd
As long as you don't claim that story on Mars is an Isekai, your definition is valid
<:TsubasaIgnite:672861877407318047>
It's isekai in spirit, that's all that counts
I'm just gonna be a jerk and point out that discussion about SAO being an isekai is irrelevant because the article never claims Kirito himself is one <:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
Only 10?
The problem with the idea of subverting the stats is that by doing that, you would undermine the entire point of having them in the first place
This tbh
deal with it
Then it's an ousekai
Shit, I got downgraded to murrican <:PepeHands:540570052102193153>

Slightly concerning over specificity of that trope

I know only one not insane pink haired girl off the top of my head, but she's a huge bitch instead lol
Also pink haired girls being completely mental

Holy shit
I think we already established that kissing your homies is not gay
<:MikuLaugh:688429715676987428>
Anime writers making the gayest anime possible without stating that characters are gay https://tenor.com/view/yes-1942rp-gif-25558795
where is this funny gif
To be fair, don't the anime writers spend hours on end in their cis laboratories to make all their anime as plausibly deniabilitable as possible or something
This story is progressing real fast
(Whatever that means)
If you do that I will literally hageshiku furu
Why won't you use english titles <a:KirikaShake:722156260241178655>

<:RolandSip:834892018798690354>
Oh yeah, they are gonna go that far
But all I can advise is that if you think they are not gonna go that far
IIRC in case of Happy Sugar Life it escalates slow enough that you can get off before you see something too disturbing
Be the change you want to see in the world?
Human nature is kinda cringe
<:KanadeSmug:688191203178840064>
I expected you to say that
What if it's gonna be a bad adaptation, would that mean that god still exists?
They give you a book with all formulas
Actually high school math exams in Poland
The things we do to watch girls kiss
Truly photogenic
<a:MikuQuake:605209236082786355>
That kind of joke is gonna leave a hell of a moral hangover
<:RolandSip:834892018798690354>
You ever get that feeling, I'm used to call it "Nostalgia for something you never experienced"?
<a:ChrisShifty:744677308631089162>
Yeah exactly where tf can I find them?
Don't tell me I was spot on
Damn dude
<:Smugland:773355666903531530>
I would also be concerned with how dumb average student in that class is <:ShirabeConcern:586404485598019604>

<:KirikaCulture:811502766538227764>
Everything I do is done with purpose
Such a bad scene to just reuse
Not gonna turn nose at that, butt damn
That and the scene when Menou wakes up in temple, which were just 1:1 scenes
They did they best, I suppose, but ingenuity can only take you so far
The episode budget got thanos snapped
<:Smugland:773355666903531530>
Or maybe the butt episode just didn't register in my memory
I guess time really goes by fast when you have good time, indeed
<:SerenaDizzy:736605371912945736>
I didn't even notice
Wait fuck it's already 10th episode?
<:ChrisHehehe:688429717019426821>
Hey, self defence is important, alright
<:FujitakaScared:672430483702939659>
I wanna hear your opinion on the episode though <:KirikaPlease:777960174333853767>
<:EEYESS:867886543364030534>
Oh boy
So true
Who cares lol
Anime draws attention to the fact that she didn't come
She's explicitly called for?

She could also be a two-faced jerk

This tbh
Where?
What did Ash do? <:ChrisShock:620077681484103680>
This shit plays on TV dude <:LUL:540570052215439360>
They are obviously best friends
Who wouldn't have done that?
No, what wtf dude
Yeah and she's like ||"Whoops, can't give you a hand shake without arms! :D"||
There may be a bit of dread against inevitable conclusion of the story as well
<:MikuLaugh:688429715676987428>

I mean, I believe you but
I rest my case
Kissing my dead friend's skeleton on "lips" is not yuri

<:VanessaSmug:689395769199165447>

~~She wouldn't choose the guy because there aren't any lol~~
I thought you said "Why wouldn't she choose the guy" and it was real anime moment
You haven't read that yet*
Isn't just the synopsis yikes worthy?
I may be completely wrong
<:BongAim:802572581718196265>
~~Although I just realized that I have no idea which book and volumes and parts correspond to which episodes so uh~~
The anime is good, though the fact that there's 2 episodes for each volume (compared to almost 5 per volume in s1) is dreadful
The disbelief hasn't been suspended, it has been hanged
<:ChrisHehehe:688429717019426821>

Personally I watch only the most normie shit since I officially started watching anime, so my best shot would be stuff that was played on Jetix
~~Hilariously, mostly (but not exclusively) the best looking ones~~
Also, as a westerner, there's a staggering amount of shows that I had thought were regular cartoons that were actually anime
I feel like stuff shown in TV doesn't count - by definition - because it was shown in TV
1998

It just sets up next episode in great position to take fucked up crown

My opinion of Ash be like üìâ
But it makes up for it
True, it's very mid on suffering

Honestly love this anime
||I have a hunch they ain't even going to fight, tbh||
It's good for what it is tbh, it just could've been so much better. The content that was cut also makes it somewhat more confusing to just pick up LN after story ends
They gave 10 episodes to a season that needed 12 of them and it shows
<a:HibikiPowerDab:688190074219003996>
Chisato wants to boost Takina's chances among the boys
All things considered Bookworm adaptation is really good, tbh
<:MyneExcited:988245188071796746>
The story only really starts after
It's ok
I mean, I doubt it's gonna get any more seasons now
On all accounts!
LOL
Wouldn't that be a twist
<:heh:794343079686832148>
More than 2 months away
That one is like
He's just like a guy
ü´µ
You should read Ascendance of a Bookworm now
No, I mean it lives up to MiA quality on everything except torturing children
Honestly it set the bar so high, the s2 is pretty mid in comparison
It really was
For pretty banal reasons too, funnily enough
On completely different note I've *tried* to watch the anime, and this might be the first one I dropped so hard, you couldn't convince me to pick it up ever again
But the characters are too busy trying to not die for things to really get going
I think I've hanged at the moment when you can tell that this story wants to be very, *very* gay
I haven't read the whole LN either <:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
Never in a million years I would've expected to have *this* adverse reaction to anything
But God
So maybe I'm indeed suffering from LN/manga reader syndrome
But then is also just so happens that these ones I've watched anime first, and in case of Otherside Picnic I did not
Certainly not to the point where I think I'd decide to just never watch them
And the other two I don't think were bad
My current resume covers like 3 non-anime works that also have anime adaptations
(ITT: Rady discovers what a bad adaptation is)
I *beg* you, if you're gonna gun for visual media, just read the manga
Just read the manga
I think the punchline is really just
Not to besmirch good name of her VA, there's probably nobody on planet Earth who could play her better
<:malkwheeze:1028677161344835735>
...Because I decided whatever experience I'm gonna have with anime, it's not worth having Sorawo's voice I've worked out in my head overridden with her VA in anime
<:ChrisCharge:586320496346529792>
Go touch grass so you don't become Bocchi yourself
Wtf
This good?
<:Nihil_Bread:848217495164157985>
Hmmm hmmm, maybe I will watch it
ü™®
But also, all 2 of yuri works I've read before feel almost deliberately like they're withholding the good stuff for later. Later meaning, the content that *wouldn't* be included in single season of anime it's going to get, if any
You just have absurd standards for what constitutes for yuri
<:NotLazyQoH:756874649379405867>
But doesn't nitro let you join 200 servers?
<:MariaWhat:672245553920344080>
<:Nihil_Bread:848217495164157985>
It's so easy, in fact, I accidentally just did it myself
You can just join the server
<:ElfneinWeld:586027421296492585>
They always look good
They really outdone themselves
I sunk into Earth out of second hand embarrassment
They announced book at anime NYC? üíÄ
What does that mean? (Explain like I'm not omnibus)
The title is too real for its own good
<:CrispyDrunkNetzach:729769318530809937>
Ironic
What does Italian Football TeleVision have to do with it anyway?
Too bad Elon fired everyone who reviews appeals
As far as reasons for ban go, this one is pretty funny
Man, what a time to pick up a series, isn't it
~~I made up the explanation and only checked the message after, but it does happen to say pretty much the same thing~~
Well, basically check the message at the end of chapter 23
I think, I wouldn't know if any new chapters were released in Japanese
And the current one just caught up to what is lying around
The previous translator finally yielded their ghost about 3 months ago and in the meanwhile 3 chapters were just lying around
~~Do Japanese even have months? I never thought about it before~~
~~I don't know Japanese months~~
When?
IT'S HAPPENING!?
Vol 1 and 2 don't even graze the surface of expositions tbh
So plastic?
You *are* technically finished with anime you dropped <:KirikaWink:689564310908960900>
I would say so too which is why I dropped it so fast, so that I don't feel compelled to finish it because of sunk cost
Left it on autoplay?
I think I watched not even one whole episode before I died from understimulation
You remember how far you got into that one?
This season is damn strong tho
My vote also goes to Bocchi
Honestly quite based
<:MyneRofl:729576361492086884>
10 brain cells, but they all use 100% of power to think about tits
<a:MikuQuake:605209236082786355>
It's happening?
It will always be Turkey in my heart
Damn, The entire country of Turkey got an anime adaptation, huh
My brother in christ your sample size is 2
"Wanna copy?"
<:MikuLaugh:688429715676987428>
Oh man, you just happen to watch it right now too?
Yeah, and some of the clips are from the 80s!
Some of those clips are from 2015. 15!
It was different times
Wait, for real?
I don't even know what to think about it
They couldn't make 2 episodes out of what's out now, if they tried
<:MariaScared:672584661125431299>
Yeah
How
Wait, what

Honestly, I'd like to hear what's up with those cancellations
Well, I'm not making it, it's a question
Hasn't it been proven recently that it is cheaper to back out of everything?
I guess that's fair
Oh fuck that was a joke, you're not supposed to agree
It's in the law
Telling a girl that you want to marry her and have sex with her is not yuri, you have to actually do it for it to count
At some point you just gotta admit it's production reality
<:MariaScared:672584661125431299>
Are you telling me they don't even have 3 day backlog they can fall back on in case of unexpected delays?
But like, isn't Christmas in US like 2 days at most?
Oh hey, I don't remember reading that volume!
But alas that day is not today
One of these days I will come back to Index
Merely an exception proving the rule
Yeah, that's very apt reaction
In a proper way anyway
You know there is plenty to be said on the subject, just as well as you know nobody is ever going to actually go and explore any of that
<@161155855524298752> Look <a:MariaSparkle:688839288082792462>
And this one is the bomb
<t:1676196000:R>
<t:1676196000>? Does this seem right?
<a:ElfneinDoIt:493803070409670657>
The double use of For adults and for grown ups made my brain short circuit and think it meant the characters are adult
I'm always like that wdym
Magical woman?
:15min:
What the
I think a midi sequencer is the closest I can get to that
Can't do a squat without music software though
For instance, if I wanted to draw, all I need is paper and pencil, and if it turn out I hate it, I can just set them on fire or something
Yeah, but I also can't really justify the cost if it happens that I don't
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
But I don't know, and I likely won't
I mean, if I knew one day I could rack money on it, I would not care about little investment
<:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
That's an expensive hobby
I'd rather avoid paid programs because the cost might well never return
Yeah, that's the kind of an answer I was afraid of
Hey <@!193408538909868033> What software would you recommend for starting off with composing?
Also, check the Gun Godz soundtrack <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I'm keeping previews, but the last one didn't seem to load
