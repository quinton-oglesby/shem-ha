Thanks for this!
I was wondering what the values were.
Ugh, another one without Giga Fantasy Crystal <:cfcTogaSaddest:469875288440963084>
And red ones are more visible after all ðŸ˜„
You are farming exactly what I need ðŸ˜„
~~Hopefully it will still be up :D~~
I'll jump on it soon
I would love some INT mats, but they also drop from Power Carol so maybe that's why
Awesome, followed <:KazumaThumbsUp:606982849983414283>
> I should have spots free
But looks like you don't have spots <@!127991170201681920> ðŸ˜„
It's up.
Open for everyone
I should have spots free
Okay
Need Gigas for XD Jii
I can host one
Carol or normal Power?
You have to win for the weekly mission indeed
That was quick ðŸ˜„
Gigas or smaller?
> I could use it for the Giga Intel/Rainbow but I just got magic crystals during the last one ;/
Btw, those magic crystals you talked about
<@!279115815494877184> Yea, saw it, gonna do it after spending AP <:notamiKonataThumbsUp:469872257863516161>
<:notamiKonataThumbsUp:469872257863516161>
Sure, if you want.
For raids you start, you always get hidden first row
yep
Well, thanks, game, now I totally know how many I got
We are doing P Carols
I really hope you guys get something because for me it's a fail after fail
<@!279115815494877184> Done, do you have one more option to start the raid?
So Garie and Micha
Not D Carol
P Carol
Carol does not prevent skill use
Zerker makes you unable to use skills
Rage
Keep it for followers only again so we can easily get top 3 rewards
Hope you guys got some Magics because I got nothing
<@!279115815494877184> Done, bring a new one <:KillMeNowXD:617772820847656987>
I have better I units so I like P Carols more
Gonna poke it
It's for followers only
Saw the P one
<@!195044406343106560> Not sure if you missed ping, so I'll ask again to be sure <:KillMeNowXD:617772820847656987> 
Could you free a slot on your list? I keep forgetting to ask <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
Healing Shirabe
<:cfcTogaSaddest:469875288440963084>
That's how it is with gachas
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
Like whole party faint and many buffs for Carol
Because Phara has some annoying gimmicks
But if you are going to run the D Carol, it may be worth.
Ah, that.
She doesn't really need active targeting if you bring I units to kill Carol first
On either Carols
The top autoscorer always uses taunt
If you need to target autoscorers, you don't really need memoria
Raid bosses should be considered bosses but...
So successful for both of us <:notamiKonataThumbsUp:469872257863516161>
I got the Magics I wanted
Nice
And before I forget again...
<@!195044406343106560> Could you free a space? <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456> 
I keep forgetting to ask you <:teehee:592134527963627521>
<@!279115815494877184> Carol done, get your stuff <:thumbsup:687085282628993140>
They are for ignite units
The Magic/Miracle ones are the pain
Believe me, normal element ones are easy
Then that's a huge success
On this comment, I suppose?

> Pause as in, don't continue hitting the raid?
Yep, join the raid, pause, press the emoji and then when we are ready, we kill the boss
We press the emoji when we are ready (means in raid and paused)
Which are gigas ofc
Because hunt = highest chance of getting best rewards
How does that work btw?
You kill until desired HP and then retire?
~~If you know your l33t speak <:XD:381376953921568768> ~~
You can read the name as well ðŸ˜„
Yep
Don't need them now, but surely will be worth in the future
Sure, I can join
And I would really love if game could automatically unfollow mutual if I remove them from one section...
Due to both slots having event chars <a:sataniaXD:610230882615427092>
I actually don't have them now ðŸ˜„
Wtf this speed
And I'm on 60 followers again <:rooBlank:596244851503267842>
Awesome, followed <:ThumbsUp:486240598408560650>
Ah, 4* one
Int Maria
Bride?
<:SataniaLMAO:654709767528513565>
Thanks for the hunt <@!195044406343106560> <:thumbsup:687085282628993140>
Holy lord
ðŸ‘€ 
5 miracles
Hmm?
No one else?
Heiki hecchara?
> red means you're mutuals
Oh. So if you are only follower, you don't see it red?
Should be a follower/friend only
When I was joining, it looked like a public one
Hmm, I didn't see the red indicator
I wonder how many people are going to get it since it's a public raid ðŸ˜„
Big
Cock-oa
Reacted to the It's done post
I'm in
She can solo it despite the recovery down debuff?
LOL
Don't see it
4 including Hanabi + you now makes it 5
Not body, though
Hanabi is
Regardless of what happens elsewhere
Hunt = you kill the boss on your screen
Good one
<a:sataniaXD:610230882615427092>
Gacha: Am I joke to you?
That's where you are forced to give up on <:SongStone:688213224012644370>
Advent shops too
They are in event shops
<:valknaruhodo:585541603284877343>
~~Selection ticket?~~
No XD Jii?
~~I want that new players celebration CP that gives her 3 times~~
She's my starter unit and she's only 54
Everyone getting Ignite Bikkis and here I'm wishing for her copies <:cfcTogaSaddest:469875288440963084>
Once you leave this cycle, you can kill some raids even alone
You need 70 units for raids and you need raids for 70 units.
It's just a matter of leaving the cycle.
Okay, after 40 turns of poking Adam due to choosing non-T support by mistake, I can check...
Hmm, 187k FP.
Looks like I'm as lazy as in FGO <:thonkeyeslocal:617773886221844480> (5M FP)
I wonder how many FPs I have...
https://discordapp.com/channels/336297387863703552/680064266539499535/700007347657113720
> i mean it also makes it easier to get to 30 card gacha mission
Ofc, it's THE way to get those missions
Too much clicking getting rid of the useless stuff
I'm not doing those free rolls either
> who need free roll ?
That too
> the free gacha in FGO was way better
Still is
It's stupid we get only solo daily free, though
Reason 2 if you aren't pulling <:SongStone:688213224012644370> gacha
FP gacha is pretty much for two reasons.
1) Getting the bond memo
2) Doing the missions for pulling 20/30 cards
> if I hit it more, I risk killing it probably
Just retire before kill
> How do you get raid badges?
It's like ignite festa.
1 per 1 roll
11 per 10 roll
Leave it on auto
> is it bad to let the ai do the work in a raid?
AI is dumb, but you don't want to pay attention during raids
Ouch
> actually how do you earn tix
Event shops, login bonuses, etc
We do have one such banner now actually
> but there's no guarantee i'll get the same cards
Well, even better, new gear means more levels to get
> hmm should i use my gold rice on 5* tix and spend them or keep the tix
You will get new enhancing targets at least
Well, she's a base 3*, even on max unlock, her stats aren't going to be that good
> she does her job only before LU
By LUing, she loses def pierce on her skill
> are there other 3 star healers than the I and P jii?
Only those 2
she does her job only before LU
That will give you a lot of levels to go through
Then time to LU them
That's some dedication
Holy shit
You have all 3* max LBed too?
<a:sataniaXD:610230882615427092>
I don't have western name
Oi
I'm waiting for refill
Dunno about Kat
No CP here <a:sataniaXD:610230882615427092>
<:thumbsup:687085282628993140>
Yep
But didn't see the follow arrow. 
Did you follow me?
Not that I would mind that <:lewdrain:387521080643944448>
~~Equip your Bikki, she is nude~~
Got you
kek
<@!457268466429329429> What is your ID/nick?
> added you satoshi
Got you too <:notamiKonataThumbsUp:469872257863516161>
> i wish there was more follower slots. Getting real hard to purge since most of my list is people from here
Yea... there should be unlimited follower slots at least...
Empty slots
Gonna clear
Damned Koreans
<:fuck:398634229736669184>
<:fuck:398634229736669184>
This is raids
<@!140931012061298688> I'll jump on it
> And nobody had lvl70 when I first farmed mine ðŸ˜¦
But at the start, due to glitches no one also needed 70s ðŸ˜„
Once you get out of it, you will be the one helping others
It's that cycle I told you about.
^
I would have to count.
I have like... 15?
Nice ðŸ˜„
Gacha only or including welfares?
~~Don't check pulls channel~~
Nah, I'm not pulling non guaranteeds
> Basa banner
Hmm... Basa Booster
I need that fucking last copy
At least she's not 48 like mine :/
Yep
> Pause after they start the raid and such
You pause so others can also join and get the reward
<@!140931012061298688> You can finish, it's gone
Damn, someone sniped Cais' Carol
2 5CP can end up being better
10CP doesn't guarantee best income
> so always go for 10 CP?
Not really. 
Bosses have nasty debuffs and shit so 5CP is better
Doesn't matter if you do 1M damage in 1 or 20 attempts
Only damage
So we can snipe
Gonna stop at about 10k
I'm doing it right now
Wait
And everyone needs Gigas to go to 70
Gigas are only available in hard raids
Then you won't be able to 70 anyone
> trying to complete kat's right now...
Tell me when you are done, I'll poke the Cais' one and we can snipe
True that...
Normal = no Giga mats
What about Cais' raid, are we doing the same?

Flying XD Jii is cute <a:sataniaXD:610230882615427092>
Paused
I did a bad choice of using 3 CP so I'm slowly killing it <:kyonfacepalm:442317724765519876>
I'm still doing it
I'll try to jump on it if I can finish the R raid within the time
I think if you enter within the time it would still count...
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
You get 11 5* gears per roll
Don't lie
Cais is F2P
Ignite Bikki <a:aPepeHands:580749883674329088> 
XD Maria <:PepeHands:584971772705898506>
I think Kazu talks about LUed units ðŸ˜„
> Rage Raid doesn't penalize non-Rage units?
Dunno if it penalizes them, but it's soloable at least due to being Rage
I'll host
> what's the best raid for getting giga melody
Since the other Melody hunting Raid are I and H.     
Dex units are pretty bad so H raids are tough and not many people have LUed B units.
So Rage Raid is the best one for melodies.
Melodies would be the Rage Fine
<@!279115815494877184> It's like this.
1) Someone with a strong team starts a raid and ends up with almost killing the boss and on low damage (10k-) they retire.
All damage they did counts.
2) Then they send request to their followers (so it doesn't get sniped by randoms)
3) Everyone enters the low HP raid and pauses until everyone enters
4) Then everyone happily kill the low HP boss and get the rewards
<@!192432957946855424> You want too?
<@!140931012061298688> <@!174272493777977344> <@!140931012061298688> I have the Rage ready, wanna jump on it?
It's on 9.4k HP
It's okay, it's the one I started, but thanks <:notamiKonataThumbsUp:469872257863516161>
Now I'm going to prepare the Rage one
2 Giga INTs, 0 Magics
Ofc nothing
<@!140931012061298688> <@!457268466429329429> Killed that Carol
Okay, gonna jump on Kazusa's Carol
Best girl obviously
Futaba-tan kawaii btw
> And we are all whaling !
Yes, exactly!
66 turns, nice.
No need to release 1.0.7
No one is macroing here.
Devs <:E_MonkaChrist:585837175124525056>
Okay, XD Jii lost to poison, gonna be done soon
~~But at the same time I want to know if I can solo the boss on 3CPs~~
This was such a bad idea I want to retire now
60T
Saving currency isn't equivalent to the time spent
Never want to do that ever again
I'm usually lazy and just throw full CP bar so doing this with 3CPs was a fresh experience
Yea
Well, you learn by mistakes
I really shouldn't have done that
And halfway done
45 turns now
I'm never doing this again
Other than that, it's limited to MLB units
And her normal skill
That's Kanade's passive after all
Only max LUed units can counter after all
Well, it wasn't short for sure
> What's this million in 1 attempt bullshit <:VanessaCracked:639136452600397829>
Btw, this really made me laugh like a madman, thx <a:sataniaXD:610230882615427092>
54 Ignite Bikki (#ForeverSadForNo70), 70 release Chris, 70 XD Jii, 70 Hexa Jii, 70 Ignite Jii, 70 Burnbasa
> What units did you even have?
I LUed Burbasa today <a:sataniaXD:610230882615427092>
This was it, right?
<a:sataniaXD:610230882615427092>
I saw something to spend 5CP on and poked it a bit too much
Oh, it was your raid
https://discordapp.com/channels/336297387863703552/680064266539499535/690623454738645054
> How much % damage should I try to do on a Hard Boss to get the bare minimum items?
I gave you a link
You don't have stones anyway
Except for FM Chris
There is no bad choice on LUing, though
Nice, faster than me
https://discordapp.com/channels/336297387863703552/680064266539499535/690623454738645054
Mega and regular are better on Normal
Paused too
Jumped on it as well
If you start something, it isn't cleared and you didn't do 3% of the overall HP, you don't get rewards
The raid has to be cleared
Also additional rewards since you started the raid
You do since you participated it
> you know quartz isn't a made up thing for minecraft right?
Exactly, Quartz is for FGO
<@!259169633389510656> I have daily Fines so we can share.
I open Fine, you open Lion
Yup yup
I can 5CP Fine, but I have to manual to clear out the ded debuff :/
> I can 2 10cp fines but i dont have anymore to open
Auto?
I just need someone to open
I can do lion by myself too
Global
You can throw Fine as well if you want <:KillMeNowXD:617772820847656987>
Can someone open the Lion raids for me?
Exhausted daily quota and no one is sending requests <:RIP:601775310056456222>
Ah, it's Cocoa, no need to worry then
Someone changed reaction
3rd guy joined on Lion
I'm in
We can kill?
I'm there
Finally appeared
I thought it was open public since ded gaem <:Ver:704169051391524875>
I don't have that acc
I have to add ahegao first
Not yet
That would explain things
Oh, it's for followers only
Yea, refreshing
Fine or Lion?
Oh well
Not me
There will also be my Fine up for you
And then you can continue
Then pause and I'll kill it
Are you in raid?
So I'll close and jump on Kazu's
I just opened Fine
Wait
> So uh can i kill?
Kill share if possible
Done
Killing lion now
Interesting. A team of Union Jii, Dr. Jii and XD Serena can actually hold their ground and without the bois around, they can actually somehow solo Fine auto without manual input <a:5_Hmm:585845634830172176>
Wait a bit, killing Fine
GENOCIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIDE
Damn you Pokelabo for waiting for so long to put this event up
> I'm 29 short <a:sataniaXD:610230882615427092>
I really shouldn't have given up on raids the last week...
I'm already doing it
I'm 29 short <a:sataniaXD:610230882615427092>
Thanks for the raids <:ThumpsUp:583771529431613461>
> This is Global correct?
Yes
> you guys want carols or nah?
No need, I only need new stuff
I see, that explains things
> I was 2 x10 cp fine until lu test
You have Serena?
> I think i can 5 cp fine manually, will test on auto later
I tested that I just have to kill Gen and Hero and then auto can do Fine <:KillMeNowXD:617772820847656987>
So I could make it <a:sweataf:535572151009542154>
I'm almost done
Awesome, still up.
So people probably solo them
Less people can solo Fine than Lions
Probably because Lions are ezy
I'll tell you if I catch it so then you can know when you can kill <:notamiKonataThumbsUp:469872257863516161>
Then rip, I'm probably not gonna make it ðŸ˜„
Damn <:shockedrito:664402788385554433>
It's soloable, but daaaamn, it takes a lot of time
Thanks, in the middle of one Fine, but then immediately gonna jump on it <:thumbsup:687085282628993140>
You need Ancient? ðŸ˜„
She works there even uncapped so yea, good test <:Ver:704169051391524875>
Tested <:Hehe:377430103480598529>
Once I finish up Fine
Any Lions you can spare? <:KillMeNowXD:617772820847656987>
Got it <:thumbsup:687085282628993140>
Okay, thanks
Yep
Anyone can open Lion and Fine raids?
But I keep saying that better than 0
Same :/
Ah, I see, thanks.
Her JP name?
Why is the Unison dess actually called Hitsuai btw?
Stun galore
kek
Mostly due to lack of Bs, but overall gets a lot of great gears
Well, INT is pretty much the best type
I'm in
So not even close
Chris is 54 and Dedededess is 52
Swordswoman Jii is my only Unison
<@!301227758678179840> Do you have any more Lions?
Yea, when you are not blocked by something, you are blocked by something else <:lul:412246645527543810>
> However many alchs i mlb x 15
Full Alch like HanaBiS? ðŸ˜„
Okay, then I'm in killing it, so you can go too
<@!259169633389510656> Are you joining on the Lion raid?
But Fine is worse for me.
I'm okay with Lion and Fine at least has two mats so something always drops
Alchs and Test came and I had 0 of everything <:LULW:606978613044051979>
Indeed
Followed
> You have me added?
Checking now
The limit of 3 is so BS
Awesome
<@!301227758678179840> You have some open slots for Lion btw?
Looks like Lion is ded, so you guys can kill it
Only 54
No Meido here :/
So I'm 10CPing now
But it takes so much time
I (after damned 21 rolls) LUed her so I was able to 5CP Fine
> oh is that consort Yu?
Yep
And that's why I got jack shit
So that's where my drops went
<:YuShock:617796815705866241>
I'm in
Ok, I can go now
In the middle of Fine so if you can wait, I would appreciate it <:TsubasaFish:689163064830066696>
<@!301227758678179840> Thanks again. Got exactly what I needed!
Done with Lion, so no thanks
Thanks <:thumbsup:687085282628993140>
Then you can just put it up
Depends on you
I can, but if you can do some damage, you have higher chance of rewards
> I can put them up but I'm doing 0 damage
It's okay, I can kill her for you
Anyone can prepare some Fines?
I only watched animu
Then you are definitely farther
<a:S3vigneWink:410812466172395541>
Also a good choice
Oi, Saorin is cute
> what are its strongest points?
Nana and Yukarin
Very nice
And stats
Can I share my humble stats as well?
