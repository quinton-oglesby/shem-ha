^ my dream look everyone... my dream look.... sadly I'm not blond.....




YAY!
I got it already
LOL
FOX!?
lol
that's consistent
although, every transformation sequence still gives me goosebumps.
That is what I was talking about, they broke that consistency
Also, I mean the whole 'spotlight' thing, with the chanting.
Hello everyone... I would like to point out that this first episode breaks a HUGELY consistent mechanic of the anime... If you note (Unless this has been talked about before) Hibiki and the other girls are falling when BAM! Hibiki suddenly gets a spotlight for her transformation... now... you may be asking... 'aaaaaand?' And I would LOVE to point out that this breaks a consistent thing where in the air, there will always be the visible background, and on the ground is when they get their solo spotlight... I just... found it... jarring that they didn't hold to it... but it makes sense to show off the heart crystal...
the original is where it's at
5ds was... meh
I lost my shit when Shirabe pulled those Yo-yo moves
Z-ZOOOOID WHY!?
ZOID WHY!?
WAIT
wait
Basa just needs a new hobby <:Ver:336656981144109066>
I don't recommend, but it's amazing
10/10 experience
I'm watching symphogear drunk
I see what you did there
..... *Killer*
I mean... they... PROBABLY knew Tsubasa was going to do that, so most likely had something planned.
I know
AND KNUCKLES MEME RETURNS!
LOL
Whoever posted this is a genius
THAT IS *NOT* WHAT I TYPED
WOW
It has funk
Because it doesn't have the trademarked hyper green girl
beGONE THHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHOT
<Shamelessly stole the gif
I need the Jiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii
;-;
Jiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii
;-;
that startup beat is just, nnnngh
did we wait that long during AXZ?
I can't wait that loooooong
;-;
COME OOOOOOOOOON!
NEXT MONTH!?
when was the first blu-ray releasing?
only took 4 seasons
?
does anyone have that last ad that played after?
Does anyone have Hibiki's farewell?
And Symphogear does it well
....
I watched Gs op
Symphogear was filling YuYuYu's hole
I feel lost already
h-help...
I mean... they did do other things
it's... pretty harsh voice work
I don't think the other women wanna do Gear anymore either
However Aoi doesn't want to do this anymore... not that I really blame her... her poor vocal cords
I'm crying because there is nothing to the scale of gear...
;-;
I can't have more symphogear
but...
;-;
I want Symphogear
I want action singing...
anyone have a translation for the final song?
;-;
lol
.......... That's every season
... next time I'll take a page from Hibiki's book and just punch it
you win with logic this round
fair enough
everything else is meaningless
.......... they only existed to bring them back to earth
THAT IS LITERALLY ALL THEY WERE THERE FOR!
ONLY EXISTED TO BRING THE GEARS BACK TO EARTH!!!
Nobile Red
that
I'd like to point out
Right?
the intro to Metanoia is glorious

....
I'm not in <#407060923078017026>
.... I just realized
..... um.... that was VEEEERY symphogear, tonal shifts up the ass....
BUT ADORABLE!
but at the same time however......
This is making more sense...
aaaand that is where I stop
0.0
THAT BASTARD IS THE REASON!!!!
NANI!?

iiiiiii don't think fingers work like that... or the angle is shitty...

<:animejanai:253355801694044160>
