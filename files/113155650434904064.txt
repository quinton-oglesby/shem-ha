So many ints in pvp

My power raid is up
Iâ€™ll throw up my P raid now

Thanks for the help Accelerate I got the last giga power I needed for Shirabe ðŸ™‚
If anyone wants to help me with my power raid itâ€™d be appreciated <:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
blue
im paused
I can do dex or power idm
ty ty
ok
I also followed you mousy
Sweet, followed
If you guys open up any space ping me so I can follow back and fav so I donâ€™t accidentally remove lol
If you havenâ€™t Iâ€™ve cleared some space
My hard power is up
I can put one a power hard in a sec, I could use some@giga power crystals
Ah that would make sense ye
3* int or 4*
Ty ty
Iâ€™m paused
Ty ty
In and paused
2 giga int and 5 giga magic, ty ty
I am
ty for the raids, that was my last one
Iâ€™m still missing 2
Whatâ€™s your team of 6? Last time you usually did 1.1-1.4m dmg each time
I freed up some room if it was my raid you werenâ€™t able to find
And mine? I can free up some follower space after I die to the Rage one
I wonâ€™t complain, I need the money from it too
I can poke your raid, I started my power raid which Iâ€™ll be chipping away at today
Is that the 3 or 4* Maria?
It shouldnâ€™t be, I just opened it
Iâ€™ve got a low miracle up for followers (and I just cleared some room)
I need to start getting units other than power so I can actually help on more than the P/D and Miracle raids
I have no more 5*s to use xp mats on
Wasnâ€™t expecting for it to go on this long
I tagged it ty ðŸ™‚
Ah
Is the tech raid weaker to special or phys
I can start one
5 giga heart and dex, thanks Haz
<@!293555261250076673> did you still need this Carol? I can open it in a few
Also paused
Iâ€™m going to start killing it now
Iâ€™ll open it now for followers (Iâ€™ve got space) and Iâ€™ll sit on the pause screen for 5min if anyone wants to nab hunt bonus
Iâ€™ll open this in ~10-15min, going to clear some space in a sec
*dont see it
If you don't see if I have some follower space free
Its also up now
Seems to be doing well enough
What team do you use? since youre doing like 500k per attempt
I managed to snag 1 giga from that one
*just
You can ust hit it
its open
Im opening it now Crystal
Ok, Iâ€™ll open it in 2min once I get my CP back
My Tech raid is at half if anyone needs it
After half Iâ€™m lucky to get 150k <:Ver:336656981144109066>
I only do like 300k with 5cp on T raids before half
I also have a Tech raid up if someone doesnâ€™t mind poking it, Iâ€™ll do another run once i dump some AP
I need some blues and pinks to make small Carol easier still
If I get decent luck I can 2shot miracles, but it depends on how low I get Phara the first run
Yea xd jii and ignite bikki carry me
Yea hanabi once Phara is at like 10% I can usually take out the miracle in one run outside of horrible rng
Fair enough no worries ðŸ™‚
Ah ok
BoulÃ© do you have follower space?
Crystal I killed your miracle one
I really wish I pulled on xd bikki <:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
I managed 1.5m without any int units but Dr Jii, it just takes forever <:VanessaCracked:639136452600397829>
Oh the power raid is done? Iâ€™m still on turn 80 <:VanessaCracked:639136452600397829>
Iâ€™m slowly chipping away at your power raid crystal
Thanks BoulÃ© ðŸ™‚
I didnâ€™t see you had to rejoin so Iâ€™m glad I ended up using 3cp
*and
Iâ€™m in an paused
its dead
Yea Phara lasted for 6turns
Itll be dead eventually unless someone kills it before I do
She only buffs reds at LU ya?
Whoâ€™s your 6th? Xd bikki?
Hadnâ€™t considered using her
Oh thatâ€™s Hexa Shirabe?
What Jii is that BoulÃ©
xd jii with no add and no heal down basically lives forever outside of horrible rng
but she buffs power dmg
yea
I call the dex one crab because of the claws
Man if I had an xd bikky my crab advent would be insane
poison is still a meme ye?
her burn is on an aoe skill?
even with mlbd burnbasa
burn rng is <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
her buff at mlb to both int and power units is really useful
it just takes literal ages
Yea its the only reason I can do any reasonable chunk to the power raid without any ints
oof
at mlb
for advent I believe the ones that show up are just the leaders for the advent parties, not the usual first and second party leaders that show up for regular nodes
Just missing challenge
