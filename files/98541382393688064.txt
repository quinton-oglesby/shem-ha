I wish I could read moon runes, or there was a translation
I might have a new favorite gear art genre

***"LISTEN UP YOU BOZOS, MY NAME IS KAITO MOMOTA, LUMINARY OF THE STARS"***

And transcend the  pleb I once was
I will soon fill the emptiness with 4k gaming
<:MikuSad:336657015961026560>

But where's the bun/bear/pagoda
I'm in love with Brigitte
2nd one she had to take a week long family vacation for homecoming weekend
Followed by being ghosted
First one I ended up seeing chronicle by myself (awesome movie)
I've only had 2 girls say yes to me
I feel like I'm getting too depressing for not being in serious discussion
2 girls moved to Alabama
Like they don't want to talk to me anymore
Infact after I ask a girl I liked, I usually end up worse off than before
I've not though
That's a 100% success rate
If you can call a blind man on a quest for grass in the desert "looking" then sure
Kinda stopped keeping track
Personally I am 0 for 15+ throughout my life
Bone transplant
Cus first I got to find a girl who is taller than me
Which tbh makes finding a gf taller than me soooo much harder
Toll boi not smol boi
6 3
I'm only 225, yknow I don't need a zarya
And also physically
Just want a girl who can lift me up spiritually
Even though my parents push super hard for me to get a qt Asian girlfriend, a girl like Brigitte would make me very happy
When I see Brigitte, I start to understand the people who legit fell in love with mercy


They make me stronger
Yes the girls in suits
Speaking of dikki

Yaoi hands >_>
Beastie boys
espescially the cindy one
i love all this yukari

Was there post credit
Kirika didn't get a season 1 callback in her henshin but shirabe does????
Also
<@189146272865845248> didn't you see the henshin sequence it comes from her boobs
"but it's totally okay I totally love Japan"
Tsubasas granddad is responsible for the biggest tragedy in Japanese history
I just watched it

Man, I just wanted to to gush and meme over the newest episode
This all started because I made a dumb meme anyway
Let's calm down
<:TsubasaDisgust:349013662775902209>
Reminds me of all the fuccboi tiktok videos
The v thing she does makes me uncomfortable
I hope for no redemption this season
^
In the words of my favorite uncle "she's crazy and needs to go down"
If the writers want me to feel any sympathy for her and her family, it's too late
It's just like
Millaarc: "I WONT LET YOU HURT MY FAMILY, I LOVE THEM"

also Millaarc:
Ty
But the sword is a massive bike
That one big sword kick move
That's powerful Japanese families for ya
that didnt take a long time to happen
still not on vrv <:ChrisAngry:336656958272700417>

vrv doesnt have episode 4 yet
Like a triumphant return
<@265617214931992576> basa probably get hers way late
What if you wanted to get your bodies back, but God said "DATO SHITEMO"
That was cool as fuck
And you can see the robot girl reflected in argartleims blade
That moment when Maria is doing fighting things
*Kills tens of thousands of people*

"The whole world is against us"
Bikkis stand [REEL BIG FIST]
Last season we had ora ora and now she's manifesting her stand
Bikki definitely watches jojo
They should upload uncut henshins
Wait 8 seasons and be disappointed
Kazanari bowl
Fudo vs genjuuro

when you emote wrong and all your blood comes out
?
there was a change in episode 4 op
Looked on the subreddit but couldn't find any
We got transformation streamables yet?
If it's Miku I don't know how the fandom at large will react
No bulli <:ElfneinBullying:421432763078410241>
I'm betting rn millarc stabbed creepy government guy
I was most scared the water tower one would be Miku
I was terrified the fake miilarcs would end up with one being a person
Tsubasa going ham like that should have been hype but it really just made me scared
<:ElfneinBullying:421432763078410241>
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
We going back to kadingo too?
That was nuts to see again
Yeah
What was the cathedral from gx called again?
Imagine thinking the moon is real
Pfft
"OH NOW ITS OK"
Fine reappears just to say
The gears win by destroying the moon
Can't wait
At hospitals
Or to fabricate the need for blood transfusion
Did they do it just to seal invade tsubasa?
The more episodes I see the more I question the massacre of episode 2
Genjuuro watches symphogear
Like a true man of culture
Ntm
It goes prelati, basa, shirabe, kirika, hibiki, Maria, Chris, genjuuro for chest size
What if the blood fountain is top dad sacrificing himself for his daughters girlfriend
<@289013001632350208> I'm betting the op shot is from the Iran war
<:TsubasaSmug:585839805737467920>
No

Antikythera gear powered tiki
Kurumabunshin no jutsu
Nobody talking about how ogawa retrieved a piece of tiki ||I think that's what happened||
Chris saw wanted and said "but what if it was missiles"
Genjuuro or bikki
Instead I got a literal missile rollercoaster
I thought once Vanessa Spider-Man her way into a truck they were gonna change the future to chase her
Mirrors s2 Chris sideswap
Given the desert and scorpions
Inb4 it's missile drifting
All those mannequins in the chataeu remind me of the S1 ED
A continuous 22 minute long POG
SHE'S DOING THINGS
WE GENOCIDE ONCE AGAIN BOIS
HOLY SHIT
YOOOOOOOOOOOOO
chris can hold 2 guns

but vanessa has 10 fingers
Carol tposed inside of Daedalus end
I've never gone from yes yes yes to no no no so quickly

Someone make this fudou

They played us like a damn fiddle! -vanessa
I'd be surprised if the boob squish was more than 20 frames
Maria's tits x Chris's tits is OTP I will fite u
Dur da bla datto sounds like gibberish
And no way to counter it
So he wants God power for japan
With this triple cross
What was fudos goal in the end
We need to look into shem-has Twitter and see if there's anything from the past that we can cancel him for
<:paliCri:546495536442638363> miku
Villain redemption sentai
Finé, doctor ver, Carol, hibiki using amalgam, and Noble red all working together to beat Shem ha

Maya why spoiler tag that in the xv chat
I just feel like it would be a hell of a power move
Yoink
Also did she henshin in real time? I didn't notice a pocket dimension(where mahou shoujos can transform safely) like with the gears
Implying that she wasn't already<:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
<@263983345669505025> >latent
"cushion? Shirabe that's food" hibiki probably
This episode 8 feels like another seasons episode 12

81 buck for base game?
wow

gear movie by bones*
gear by bones
Vanessa got decapped so if she's alive she's gotta work fast
I was taken aback by the pierce of Elsa, but when she pulled sideways I was terrified
Shem ha mercing NR legitimately scared me
The post credits scene seems like it's cut short on vrv
There are people who believe God created the earth 2000 years ago
Well to be fair
Tsubasa stopped
So pure
<@222804286759763969> that kazanari blood my guy
I didn't see tsubasas dad dying coming and that hit me bad

I was reallylate watching the episode
MY TWITCH CHAT HAS AS MUCH *PHONICU GAYN DA* AS 7 BILLION HUMANS
Do the mech from season 2 that did absolutely nothing
That's just Chris swan song
When shirabes shield turned into a mech of herself I couldn't help but hold my head and repeat "what? WHAT?!"
DM me the true meaning
/:|
First to predict it?
Oh
You sure?

Revolver but big
I straight up thought Maria was gonna get decapitated before the OP
Yoo
When I saw noble reds new forehead symbols my brain immediately went *"so for instance if I told you to kill all the Japanese"*
The looped animation
Anyone feel like the close-up shot of Vanessa fighting bikki felt weird

It doesn't have to be the moon
"I simply came into being"

But the laugh was more unexpected than a burp
I laughed out loud at that
you get bunny girl vanessa instead
too bad
cant tell who i wanna be in that pic
<:HibikiAAA:620079684109205534>
and i <:rooPog:597854138784546817>
but they did it + amalgam
i was watching it with my friend and when they stopped singing i said "ignition" out loud, i didnt think theyd do it
First time without the ghosting and dimming for tv
I just actually watched that video of fushicho
Holy shit
<@398201668338057216> ty
Can't find it on YouTube
Anyone have a streamable of the idol concert from szs G of fushicho no flamme?
symphogear?
people said savage maidens wouldnt have a satisfying ending and it did so i have hope
what tagline, like the episode title?
THE ENTIRE FUCKING EPISODE WAS JUST SO HYPE
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
What is genjuuro supposed to be saying when he asks carol "do you intend to anyone for killing your friends" apparently it's a mistranslation
Shem ha wanted power to attack the custodians who left
I'm crying too
The no subs on the final song was infuriating
Yeah
They finally got to see the shooting stars together
Can't wait to see cars reaction to kanade
What's shaider
What was that huge stand Chris had
"you can't save the world with songs"

Literally the only thing that could save the world is songs
Pass
No music for a musical
Manga gear wouldn't be as good
whats the lifespan on this chat now?
scary
did you see that?
eww
if you have an item that tells time, but its shaped like a phallus, is it filled with clockwork or cockwork?
Why am I saying these things
I need a nap
I still maintain that you didn't try hard enough to put things inside your old penis
True
You can put things in a dick you quitter

I see it was discussed already but my point stands
If you have any suicidal thoughts please call a hotline or talk to a friend or family member
Twitch streamer Etika committed suicide, and was found in his apartment
It wasn't that a kid was killed for not pledging allegiance
Had it wrong
By an adult
There was a story about a kid who was killed for not pledging at a sporting event
And stopped doing the pledge
Coincidentally, junior year was when I learned to be my own person
I live in Texas and we pledged allegiance to both federal and state flags, every single day until like 3rd year of high School
Considering I didn't even know it was happening
Now won't pretend know anything about that
It was a dumb idea and now we're so entrenched we can't get back out easily
Ask away
Compulsory
The day before they took away that regulation my brother had to shave at an assembly
Facial hair used to be unacceptable at my high school
I keep finding stuff about knights taking off their helmets
A kid was beaten up by an adult for not taking his hat off during the national anthem

I really need to watch gunbuster and die Buster
All my protagonists need to do for my undying support is cross their arms in the face of the enemy and stand tall
I'm a sucker for the gainax pose tho it gets me hype as fuck
I liked it more than a shitload of people on Reddit did
No nipples vaginas or wing Wongs either

Looks like saibou is the popular show until grand blue airs

The power of boners

But latooni
Weird

I'm assuming it's a manga where ugly boi gets a bunny girl he never even dreamed of
Fucking dead
They keep telling me there's no high school girls in college
Hana kana as a yandere makes me really uncomfortable
Great season for laughs
Grand blue is my favourite comedy but asobi asobase is such a close second
So many surprises for me this season, only wanting to watch grand blue

Fucking Feb 27th can't get here fast enough
I can't wait for more shouta X Lucoa shenanigans
It could be gal cleaning
It could be worse
And it's been on hiatus for 2 weeks with no resume date
why don't you just fucking stab me in the face it would hurt less
ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING WITH THIS CLIFFHANGER
My favourite page so far
The phrase "just fuck already" is ever present in my mind
600 chapters into MT now
im just saying MT is way faster to read than your typical manga
<@!388516680742993933> keep in mind a chapter is literally 1 page 4 panels
i binged 330 chapters of mousou telepathy today
so since i caught up on perfect GF and Amnesia

<@256945399338631168> Net-juu no susume author is ill?
But haruhism has ponytails
Madokaism is way better than haruhism
Can magicla girls still exist
And a good lesbian is god
I felt even rebellion felt a little bit extra
Where can madoka go from here
I love this manga so much
Arigato
My friend is asking for sauce on this anime
Would y'all say kyubey is true neutral?

for someone who loves LL like i do, im sad it took me so long to realize the mom is cosplaying honoka
<@279341087494242304> nobody ever reacts to anything I say, don't act like it's not business as usual
Ver never died, he just got sent to feudal japan
Probably just gonna use nyaa
Wanted to watch it with my dad :(
Oof
Since masterani.me is gone and I refuse to use kissanime
Is there anywhere to watch angel beats legally?
Also one of my favorite parts
Very shaftesque
<@231025503643893770> it's because of when she falls through all the windows
Aochan can't study has a reeeally catchy OP
healing fluff abound
update: used my ps4 to watch senko san
BUT BRIGHTCOVE DOESNT WORK ON ANYTHING
when you get home from work and you feel like hammered shit and just want to watch anime about fluffy tail fox gril
To me kyubey seems no different than thanos
Nobody: 
Urokodaki: 👺
Anyone know when hitoribocci op comes out
Me like 2 minutes ago: oh yeah devil is a part timer
Me the other day: " how come there's no reverse isekai, where an otherworlder ends up in Japan and just goes with it"
I haven't seen any memes
How so
Shiawase~~~~~
Senko San after work
The hardest choices require the strongest wills
Also
>Reading YouTube comments
<@231025503643893770> ty
https://youtu.be/Eaxjmqy5oPA can someone tell me what episode this is from
I like that Japanese Twitter memes and English speaking Twitter memes are so similar

There's some good ones
<@388516680742993933> I'm saving Twitter memes from the YC announcement
Heh
January can't get here soon enough
For the perfect campground
Looks like their going on a quest
<@231025503643893770> ooooooooooo
Pls no
Took me 6 episodes to figure out Tanya degurachauff is aoi yuuki
<@302063351767498752> have you checked out miageru to Kimi wa yet
theres more but i feel like thats too many links
https://youtu.be/r5WkkObyH40 senko to
Its finally out<:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
https://youtu.be/HS48ZEcaaqg
<:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
Nobody I know is reading miageru to Kimi wa
Didn't see someone else plug tonikaku
So is miageru but like I said they're teasing a bit of drama
But the first two are like total fluff cuteness
<@302063351767498752> my perfect girlfriend

Tonikaku kawaii

Miageru to Kimi wa

All these are good SoL although looking up to you is teasing some drama rn
Promare looks so freaking cool
https://youtu.be/Q1z8XFR3nNg
And all of youjo senki in 2 days
I binged 2 and a half seasons of overlord in 2-3 days
<@87512939107450880> it's like a drug
New isekai quartet characters!!!!
I want to see the movie
I really liked it
I finished youjo senki today
No just throwing in my useless 2¢ way too late
Bitch/slut was a horrible person through and through she tried to fuck over naofumi at every turn for no reason and plotted to murder her sister for political gain, she deserved that guillotine
Isekai quartet has been so delightful
I'm gonna miss all these shows next season
Started watching evangelion on Netflix just because, still haven't passed where I dropped it
Just realized that
My mp4 does not play on mobile correctly
mfw
man what a dick
I'm gonna miss aochan so much next season


I don't even like Eva but not having fly me to the Moon feels really weird
Oof
So does all this shitting on Netflix EVA come from sweeping kaworu under the rug or is there more bad stuff
Ao chan was one of the best rom coms I've seen in a long time
<@486087033652248576> they were all wonderful episodes
I will miss my 3 adorable dummies
Bocchi, ao, and nanako
<:TsubasaSmug:585839805737467920>
3 is very beautiful
But 5 was my favorite to read
It's 4>3>5>2>1
For me only talking about anime
It's so much fun
Onegai muscle might be my favorite op this season
Fuck Netflix
Is takagi San 2 on nyaa?
i keep seeing stuff about "vinland saga" what is that
<@246146781832806401> have you been to Okinawa before?
it gave me the best profile pic
im watching the non non biyori movie finally
It's fuckin good
O maidens in their Savage season
Yo has anyone seen
I'll probably rewatch in the winter when I actually exercise
Machio is my hero
Danberu is so good
#fucknetflix
I missed takagis 5head so much
Now I see Eren carry the boulder and I'm like YOOOOOOOOOOOOO
And was like "hey this is pretty good"
Like I watched it airing in '13
I don't remember season 1 of aot being this hype
This is nice
I will die on this hill
Jiyuu no tsubasa is better than guren no yumiya
Is gear on Saturday
Yeah
In another world with my MILF is worth it just for the milf
I hope ara Ara oneesans never leave
Then again
I like Naruto's story, all the way to the end <:HibikiWhoops:585839808115507222>
I gave SAO 50 episodes despite the fact I hated alfheim
And you can tell
One look at how many things I have 10/10 on Mal
People who know me know I'm *very* forgiving when it comes to anime
But I watched gigguks aot video and now I'm super interested in seeing it all unfold
That's valid
Is it as not subtle as I think it is or am I just able to tell because I know the secrets
They set up things in aot season 1 that make sense later in the series vlike female titan changing direction completely, just after "crushing" Reiner
MILFbook
Ah yes
Did she make a drill in season 3?
Bikki watched TTGL once between seasons 3 and 4
They watch Clannad once a year
Fujikata is the guy
Fujikata?
Is one
Fumisato
They watch SoL shows about couples together
<@437292788611153931> that guy isn't ogawa
Tsubasas granddad watches ntr
Also who is female ogawa
One piece
Maybe she watch matrix as well?
We know Chris watched equilibrium (not an anime but Canon)
Yes
Genjuuro watches megalobox and one punch man
Ver watches euphoria on loop 24/7
Miku watches exclusively Yuri shows
Serena watches things like sweetness and lightning, pure wholesome fluff
Then bikki watches fairytail
But friendship
Chris would like black lagoon
Like a real man
Ogawa ships shikatem
Ogawa watches it too
Basa too
100%
Bikki
I dropped boruto after the mist field trip arc
<:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
Naruto meeting his parents and getting the real story of the night Naruto was born in the games is like
I played the storm games
I didn't watch the anime
Mal works just fine for me
<@87512939107450880> kanako itou songs are great
Holy fuck
I'm 40 episodes into attack on Titan now
https://youtu.be/-K4TaXrKHRc when you roll up to pewter city gym with a Blastoise
gigguk:i will donate all the ad revenue from the first 2 weeks to kyoani and then turn off ads

youtube: demonetized
january cant come fast enough guys
i miss yuru camp
im happy
dumbell op is out
As well as mondaiji
Ngnl is also watched
I've already seen all of overlord and I just kinda dropped slime
i wanna see an isekai where the protag has a balanced party of male and female companions

Albedo and shallchair drooling over ainz is bad but inuyasha which has miroku gets a pass?
So I just did a jelly donut instead
Somehow there isn't a donut emoji
It's so fun
https://streamable.com/bdkpu look at the actual op itself
<@99695384296701952> you think that's different
https://youtu.be/VDQnCESXd6c
I'm trying to start my dad on demon slayer
Can't wait for zls s2
Demon slayer<:TsubasaSmug:585839805737467920>
Bocci episode 8 made me cry and no anime this season has done that yet
She almost killed the fuck out of her
Seeing Tanya believe that aqua was sonzai X was the best part of IQ
Of course there was also hitori bocci
Ao chan, isekai quartet, senryuu shoujo
My favorites last season were the short series
Last season was actually really good for me
I take that back
I feel like last season was weaker
She's like a wholesome hex maniac
But just wants friends
New girl introduced and she's all spooky
Try episode 6 since it's so episodic
Won't deny it was
There's a scene where the chuuni gets up in a tree outside the class window and the teacher just opens the window and says "please take your seat" and as the next scene plays out, a man in a cherry picker is helping her down in the background.
I find it really funny
I like it more than asobi asobase tho
Wasteful days of highschool girls it's like a more grounded asobi asobase
Maidens and wasteful days are both really good
There's a bunch of quality non action stuff this season imo
We don't deserve ufotable
The most recent demon Slayer was some of the best anime I've ever seen
I should mention that episode 2 is also good <@238855496797257729>
<@238855496797257729> did you ever check out wasteful days of highschool girls episode 6
ah
<@!263983345669505025> wut anime
I'd pick gakkou gurashi or etotama probably
If you could pick a show to get a second season what would it be
Agreed
https://streamable.com/r8zzj
This show is so fucking good
I'm rewatching gakkou gurashi with a friend who hasn't seen it
I already stole that meme
Too late
<@238855496797257729> *yoink*

<@456226577798135808> you seen gurren lagann?
school live will never be continued and i hate that so much
better hide my assets
swell with 4 counts of tax evasion
log horizon mentioned
my mind
<@!193408538909868033> seperate seasons dont count

Sensei likes girls in suits too it seems
Mudazukai was really funny
I don't know why I stopped
I started watching gintama again finally
Also that demon slayer episode is fucking murdering me with that cliffhanger
Majo best girl
ano sa
nichihoes is so good
YES

I got a deku figure :)
it would
women can cum too
<@238855496797257729>  make sure you use a blacklight on it
thats actually p great

im gonna be mad if hongou fucks her teacher
Wasteful days was fucking hilarious
i just clicked on it because it was there
my precious ears
theres no volume slider
He thought it was awesome
Godamn it's still so cool
I'm excited to see how he reacts to the hinokami
My dad and I are about to hit episode 19 of demon Slayer
Honestly I like all of them but I like her the most
I like goe
I started watching episode 1 of release the spyce
My favorite robot genre is trigger robot
Why do I feel like shrimpy is the physically stronger one
i would love to cosplay genjuuro
so i dont get to see it
turns out my promare ticket was for a theater thats a 5 hour drive from me
How long until takagi-san season 2 exits Netflix prison?
Veeerrrrryyyy little
I know about some stuff but like
I know there's like 150+
I stopped at 61 cus I read in volumes
Actually made me buy 7 volumes of manga I was enjoying it so much
Dr.stone has been exceeding my expectations
Meanwhile
It fucking ruins the pacing Because they also do the whole "ooooh I'm so embarrassed please don't hit me I'm sorry" both times too
*twice in a row*
Then shinra fell into tamakis tits
They had a really great setup for a super tense fightscene that was being badass the whole time
He had stars in his eyes
Shinra vs. rekka was the last straw for me
For me this season has been great even tho fire force was a wet fart
It probably comes and goes, maybe next season has more to catch your eye
Kinda thing
And I can kinda see a "if you like Geah check this out"
No clue, but the show is really good <@237964037898502144>
Really enjoyed it
I finished release the spyce
now we just wait for mha and haikyuu
my dad finally finished demon slayer
watch release the spyce
<a:CampRave:598649311852756992>
Promare is coming to my movie theatre after all!
10/10
Goddamnit it's like they made a movie just for me
I just got back from seeing promare
YOOOOO HOLY SHIT
Manofculture.jpg
Uruka besto
F tier teacher
My point still stands
I got the fu
What's sensei's name
I forget her name
W/e
Any real, good teacher would be fucking thrilled to have a passionate driven student
Someone please explain why fumino sensei is so popular, my brother and I don't get it.

Here you have 2 incredibly smart teenage students who happen to be bad at one subject, a subject that they have passion and future plans to go into and a drive to **actually** study it

And she says they shouldn't bother
It's been a minute
Iirc that's TWGOK protag
Zenitsu I mean
Isn't demon slayers VA the same as keis?
Wait
It's fucking good
Trippy you got a TWGOK tierlist?
I'd post a pic of bullied aqua if I could
I just like her man
Even if it's Japanese warlord otaku
F you I like otaku grils
I still love miku and yostuba
Senpai is short purple right?
Just want you to know where I'm coming from
I get you
None of them would probably agree with mafuyus motivation
Got 3 teachers in my immediate family, even more in the uncles and cousins
<@388516680742993933> just wanted to add
Which is to say not
Zenitsu and keima are like, complete opposites in the romance world yet somehow both are equally dateable
My ears and memory are good my guy
https://youtu.be/4jS_Um40C1s >professionally trained singer
I'll see if I can find it
Funny thing is the specific sample of keima I had in mind
I compared keimas voice to zenitsus in my head and I was right
I FUCKING KNEW IT
So if people wanna watch anime together on discord you can now
Audio works
Discord screenshare has finally been fixed
Btw
What's that
I was really close
Keima
Is sword oratoria required?
Watching danmachi s2
Oh shit she's vanessa
Why can't I find a page on them
But like
I see them in cast credits a lot
Who is M ° A ° O
It's p fun
I almost forgot what binging on anime felt like
jesus chris
But does he know martial arts
What are keywords
considering theyre all pretty terrible people
its perfectly acceptable if the main cast of konosuba annoys you
And the tiddies
I love konosuba comedy
<@83626774000308224> I set a shitton of reminders to ask for the day off lol
I am so goddamn lucky, the konosuba movie is coming to my theater next month
Off I go
I gotta
Or should that be in <#377148557796442134>
Can I gush about my favorite manga here
what a day
and kaguya s2 announced
my dad is finally caught up on dr stone
I'm not even mad
Second place goes to genjuuro
I did both
My dad enabled isp protection and it fully blocks nyaa
I can't use nyaa
KissAnime doesn't seem to have it either
Also I don't know my parents Hulu acc rn
I just want to watch cautious hero and I'm broke af
Lmao wtf
Funimation free trial charges you money
That's rough
I don't get the invisible tsukihime jokes
My car has some trouble acquiring album art
I'm dead

Melua sounds mighty prep right now
I can't imagine needing one
My pc has no disk drive for the opposite reason
It
I guess my ps2 might take ot
Nothing has a disk drive
To what
It's old as shit
Basically
Garage cleaning day found an ancient relic
<@388516680742993933> any recommendations while I wait for more kaguya?
It's fucking fantastic
Gotta say
I'm finally caught up with the kaguya manga
I don't watch ladybug but if I did my ship would be "2 nerds nerding it out"
https://youtu.be/hs4V0PnbZmc I asked cus a guy I subscribe to made a video
<@102691114762371072> only just saw your reply
What is miraculous ladybug, have any of y'all seen it
cautious hero is better than choyoyu
There has to be a name for it
https://youtu.be/19rs7PM10xc they do it at 1:15 in this op too
Does anyone know what this is
That post credit scene!

I'm at the konosuba movie waiting for it to start <a:FastFujiYay:568897528263737383>
Like this is pretty me_irl
Despite only ever seeing them on anime girls
Am I weird for thinking yukatas look really fucking pretty
Today's ep made me sad with that last line
I love rising of the book hero
<@238855496797257729> hi
<:IshiNoo:591600260665704451>
ok was gonna say
ntr?
Next big anime movie is tenki no ko right?
Makes me wonder why they put all that effort into such an unimportant scene

I'm starting chihayafuru
I'm busy with the holiday season and other things like video games
I can't marathon it the way I want too either <:HayaCry:545107142693093387>
<@238855496797257729> I'm only on S1 e5
Holy crap  <@238855496797257729> how did I sleep on this for so long
I already like the MC girl
I cried with her
When chihaya found her newspaper clippings in a scrapbook
<@238855496797257729> I won't lie
<@238855496797257729> I fucking love it
<@472513526393602059> chihayafuru
I finished season 1
<@238855496797257729>
Fr
I'm fucking hyped
CHIHAYA VS MASHIMA NEXT EPISODE
AYAMINE
Also
Cool
Dumb question but still
Do BDs have subs
Kongou
If I actually had to pick just 1
Like
Kongou is actually my waifu  <@238855496797257729>  <@238855496797257729>
Episode 3s ending gave me chills like mad
<@238855496797257729> I'm on season 3 now
K thx
<@238855496797257729> what day of the week do the episodes air?
Went to watch the next episode but it didn't exist 😢
But I'm caught up now
I didn't realize it
<@238855496797257729>
It's taking like an hour to finish a 20 minute show
What the actual fuck is wrong with vrv, I'm watching a show and it constantly crashes and then when I reload it, the subs are different and also not there for large spans of talking

Night
In others no
In some ways
It just happens in 12
I actually only work 5 hours
I gotta sleep cus I got work in 12 hours
<:KirikaApproval:586957465552158720>
The ED is a banger
And when the guy forfeited his match so she could sleep I was heartwarmed
When she beat inokuma I was pumped as fuck
Sorry I immediately went to bed aftwards
<@472513526393602059> is gud
It's a fucking rollercoaster
Finally got around to watching the Tanya the evil movie
NETFLIX HAS TAKAGI SAN IM SO HAPPY
Neko box



Also I got best boy for Christmas
I'm so freaking excited
Just found out about bookworm season 2
:)
Can't wait for bookworm second cour
Like how running in the nineties runs around your ears
I hate that unless it's meant to be done
Honzuki very good
Also
Funi player straight up doesn't work for me unless I'm on ps4
Funi sucks ass
:/
I feel like I need to watch it
Is there anywhere to stream lucky star
For me it was probably steins gate or madoka
What do you think your favourite anime of the decade was?
I actually really liked everything but s1
Yeah S1 is wild

I bought some manga :)

And that's adorable
Apparently puck got his own seat after Subaru made a petition
Sebas X Wilhelm is what I crave
Isekai quartet S2 started fairly strong compared to s1
spoilers
wish she didnt have pink hair tho
i like new madoka
Gotem
Bofuri's nuts
Are there xv zesshoushinai
Healing and escapism
Iyashikei and isekai are very popular for good reasons
im so excited to see how s4 of haikyuu turns out<:MikuPanic:640289659452129310>

The op I mean
I like mousou express
That kicked me in the heart
The part that really hit me in the heart was the little brother saying ||bring back my sister|| towards the end
I was actually surprised by the ending
<@256945399338631168> hell yeah it was<a:MichaNod:493803314593660958>
Sorry got distracted
<@87512939107450880> <@471416654346321930> re zero 1,2,3

<@350222094522646538> nise has some of the lewdest moments
i love it
4 haikyuu bois
I want everyone to be happy but the episode where they went to jaxa really hit me
<:MillarcPlead:663522911067570176>
I love Monroe and I want her to achieve her goals
I'm watching koisuru asteroid
Ainz definitely got the best deal of the 5 shows
It's a capitalistic dystopian hell
Tons of Reddit comments in the recent quartet episode discussion
Not that I read them
It's explained in a side story book LN
And the non rich are kept stupid
Ainz never went to middle school as it was too expensive in the year 2138 where everything past elementary school is tuition

Pretty sure I just got gotobun spoiled for me by a dickhead who wasn't thinking
Rezero v1 is in my backpack

<@!115744398997716995> isnt that just the whole show
I could watch this shit forever
I never want bofuri to end
Stein's gate
It just tickles my funnybone
I can't love the writing in this show any more than I already do
https://youtu.be/mmUbe6Z47pU
<:ShiraBean:661294258795446326>
So much sweetness
Gochiusa s3, kinmoza movie, yuru camp s2, and many more
I know some people don't like it but it's something I really appreciate
New season of isekai quartet announced at the end of s2 <:MikuCute:672908542763859968>
I don't want the show to pass up my book reading tho
Getting my dad to watch rezero from time to time
but in some places it feels like its moving too fast
i like the lack of un needed expositing
i have mixed feeling about tower of god
im sure i could breath in like that

I'm watching Castlevania and I keep waiting for saint Germaine to turn into a hot woman with a gun
But it's awesome
I didn't think I'd like my next life as a villainess
Kaguya airs on my birthday<:TsubasaJoy:688191716620238870>
Inject it into my veins pls
Yeeeeeaahhhh bookworm s2

For that
What day of the week is it again?
I love bakarina
Especially the teacups shot
I love the bakarina op so much
Why?
Some freaking insane animation though
What a ride
Finally finished castlevania S3 last night
I'm working on finishing violet evergarden but it's hard to read subtitles when you're ugly crying
I finished takagi San s2, cute as fuck
Castlevania can be an anime
All art imitates other people's art
We Stan harbor porpoise

But I just don't have very many shows I'm watching currently airing
This season feels really empty compared to last season, what I am watching I'm enjoying so much tho
The end of promare always makes me tear up
They basically did it all for the last episodes post credits scene
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
Al is really cool and interesting to me and I want to know about his mysteries but he never shows up
Fuck
Heavily
I've been reading the LN and Al got screwed by the adaptation
I'm more mad at how they treated al<@139432096023183360>
After the post credits scene he said "Fuck you I hate you I never wanna watch this show ever again, it's bullshit" <:Ver:704169051391524875> <:Ver:704169051391524875> <:Ver:704169051391524875> <:Ver:704169051391524875> <:Ver:704169051391524875> <:Ver:704169051391524875>
And uh
I just finished the rezero directors cut with my dad for father's day
How do the TV stations handle that
Good timing
Nice

ISHYGDDT
>not thinking shinso wo sasageyo is the best op
And I actually really like it
I started watching cardcaptor Sakura
<a:NekoRainbowDance:684537322578116659>
they put the BNA op and ed on spotify
"he's too powerful"
I wonder why the horny in soul eater doesn't bother me but in fire force it does
I got 4.5 hours left
<:ShirabeCry:671887081026617345>
I wanna go home and watch anime
I can tell they're all great
Yeah
Instantly more hooked than I was the first 11 episodes of tower of god
First episode of God of highschool was so good
My dad wont
He's leorio
<@202444817043685386> you seen hxh?
For one thing they skipped the fact that ||he's from Japan too||
But when s1 aired he got completely skipped
Yup
Helmet bro
Aldebaran
But I'm still not happy
Like I get it
I'm still kinda miffed at the handling of Al in s1
Lmao
"Emilia doesn't have strong feelings about anyone or anything"
I like how my brother put it
Petra doesn't count as part of a harem
Jsyk
Hey I haven't seen s2e1 yet
>Wilhelm is stronger than Reinhardt

<:TonyEyeRoll:580561912513691679>
I'm reading it rn
Manga is so good
God, soul eater would have been so fucking cool if it hadnt split from the manga
Cant wait for the new stuff of MiA
<@481518367845646346> I don't remember Emilia saying that
I'm so ready for goblins crown and shaman king
He hadn't given thought to it before I mentioned it
I opened my friends eyes to the amount of sexual assault in Sao yesterday
I cried
Rezero was so fucking good this week
love that
the bickering between mira and mori at the end was wonderful
that new episode was 🔥
i really like the character design in this manga im looking at called school zone
<@199928870810419200>
<@155150213445582850>  school zone
This manga is fantastic

Having said I'd hate uzaki irl, I also kinda want a girl who'd pull me out of my shell as a friend
I like the cafe dad and daughter a lot
If uzaki was real I'd hate her guts
I absolutely agree with that
^
And no fuckin way am I going to let someone shame me at 24 for thinking she's attractive at 20
Short people can have big boobs
Working at a grocery store I see so many kinds of people of all shapes and sizes, thousands every day
I really am enjoying uzaki chan, yet I feel everyone I see online talking about it is shitting on it
but i think shes hilarious
akaze is 57 shades of fucked up
koisuru asteroid is another cgdct with a decent plot
if you want some cgdct im really enjoying *school zone* which seems to update daily

but how different is japanese beer to american
and i never thought about it
i was watching uzaki and they did a 20th birthday inaugural "getting completely wasted" party
I love it with all my heart

I found a figure I want badly but orders are closed :(
Master of the craft truly
Reki kawahara you've done it again
probly a good choice but im still addicted
yes <@456226577798135808> its from the most todays chapter
Me irl


I miss it <a:ShirabeSob:725756411312734228>
I wish chihayafuru would come back
I've been feeling too smart, gotta bring it down
I might rewatch AHO girl
Seems fun
This is "I'm gonna be the twintail"?
It's good too

I got spoiled on the end of the current arc of haikyuus anime
Spoilers can ruin hype
For a sports (read: "sports") property
Well
Why am I so dumb
And still clicked it
I read that multiple times
>manga spoiler
Might be a bit biased I grew up in a sports oriented family
Tbh good sports anime to me are just as good as any battle shonen
Haikyuu is so goddamn good
Kinda killed my excitement for the rest of the arc because now there's no suspence
I haven't watched any of kanokari or read it
She's cute
Yup! Ty
Voiced by Nao Toyama I think
Who's the kanokari girl with short brown hair
Such a great movie
My dad and I just watched tenki no ko
Which may not seem long but it was updated daily so it's hard to go from that to nothing
It's been almost 2 months
My favourite manga started updating again
AAAAAAAAAAAAGGGHHHHH
HAIKYUU IS BACK AND IT FEELS SO NICE
Super good looking super fun
Kodaka from danganronpa and I think the author of gakkou gurashi
And it's probably my favorite of the season
I watched all available akudama drive episodes today
It's kinda like anime ||The Boys||
I saw people on reddit shitting on it but I could tell they just wanted my hero academia
That's all I've seen
Nana e1 was super good
But
I'm not clicking that

<:KanadeAngry:672861874966233118>
This anime pisses me off so much but I'm at the point where I'm enjoying my anger
I'm binging rent a girlfriend
I like the drums too
personally when i have a thought about something someone obviously loves and its not very nice, i dont say it
way to be passive aggresive
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTh9MI8eqPo
i love the haikyuu op
But Nao Toyama is so good
This show is bad
6 damn episodes
I personally can't believe how long it took to introduce ONE new girl
/manga
Probably my #1 harem anime
The manga for it is awesome
I was sick from work
Back in '14 I watched all 3 seasons of the world god only knows in 2 days
So it's too late for me
Well to be fair I'm already into hololive
HA
Sakuya syndrome?
Back when I could get 3 seasons done in 2 days
I haven't gone into the time capsule in like 7 years
I'm honestly shocked I was able to
I got through 10/12 kanokari episodes today
i need to watch it
I had a crush on sango as a kid
<@171395487247630336> you were right that was a wild ride
Wasteful days is so good
I just want a Hephaestus figure
Tfw your waifu gets no merch because she barely matters in the show
Which is very exciting for me
Til apparently etotama is getting a second season at some point
Yuru camp 2, Dr stone 2, Neverland 2, horimiya, log horizon 3, non non biyori, re zero and any new shows I might find interesting
Next season is something I'm super excited about
The pacing is syrupy
To say nothing of astas voice
The black clover anime is so freaking bad
It was October tho so it might feel closer
Yup
It's not that they make good shows, it's that they made 3 really well animated shows so close together
And all of them have some super good animation
They did god of high school, now they're doing Jujutsu kaisen, and now they're doing attack on titan
Studio mappa seems crazy to me rn
the end of that ep confused me
<@!274279989506211841>
||is that supposed to be eren||
For anyone unfamiliar

I love this shirt so much
My family did Christmas today because of scheduling stuff
lmao
baseball can also be a free space
what show?
Catching up with sleepy princess in the demon castle has been so much fun
That being said I only saw s1e1 of regular
I like it way more than regular
I showed him episode 2 of black
We both like it a lot
Dad's been a biology teacher for 35 years
I watched cells at work black with my mom and dad
These recent jujutsu kaisen episodes have been fucking awesome
This manga has the best facial expressions
Now I gotta watch it
I just learned that mamoru miyano, tomokazu sugita and nana mizuki are all in uramichi oniisan
It's always been very hard to get a read on the tech level
Pepsi exists in Naruto

Im watching Naruto with my dad, and jiraiya was looking at some ladies when I noticed something

It's a fantastic video
They were playing gmod

I just don't like doing it :I
<:TsubasaDisgust:349013662775902209>
I don't think I'm getting it back anytime soon

But I looked for the sequel
And I got the first game on Amazon for like 18 dollars
Champions of norrath
<@90229127075893248> so there was this realms of EverQuest series on PS2 that I loved

Iunno
So we're planning on getting an inu to be it's friend

Gimme the husky GODDAMNIT
I don't play games
I'd rather have a dog please, euthanize the cat please
NTM cats suck
I don't have a cat
I don't have the most profitable job
Can't buy everything I see

When the budget allows for it ;)
Patience silly
I have a perfectly fine ps2
Like
I don't like using emulators
Meh
How is it illegal
Cus I have a PS2 but my PS3 is long dead and gone
The ps2 version or ps3 or is there another newer one
double life consequences
"this mg42, my life... They are... SYMPHOGEAR!"
"the noise don't stand a chance"
Muselk uploaded his view of the Gmod video
but like
its trash
have you seen the anime "gamers!" ?
projecting and stuff
like
mostly cus ive gotten really good at filling holes in characterization in my mind
you are right i do care a lot about a good story tho
your reason to care about dana and chad is different than my reason to care about hajime and chiaki
i cant argue that point because its based purely in your mindset, different things make people care about different things
well i prefer games where making an arbitrary choice doesnt get someone killed randomly 2 acts later so 😋
i like guessing which one will die next and which one did it, and using reading comprehension common sense and logic to figure it out
i didnt find UD very interesting tho
unless your game is procedurally generated
ntm every death in almost every story ever made was scripted
and if there was a way for nobody to die in dgrp itd be boring
he lets the kids do the killing all by themselves
because the mastermind takes a hands off approach to the killing
saw is different
i think the concept is cool >_>
is an amazing game
yes
**BEST GAME**
<@246146781832806401>
10/10 100/100 BEST GAME
*she's* not killing them  <@246146781832806401> *gravity* is
oh
<@178132156592160769> it aint there
i dont know if yall have divinity original sin 2 but this game is amazing
thats hilarious
i dont really have a "so bad its funny" anime
but akame was just not fun to watch
i enjoyed brynhildr while i watched it, im sure i probably wouldnt now tho
i agree with mill
akame ga kill for instance
ive seen worse anime than brynhildr
And in project diva f
i think i remember now
anyone recognize these cats?
Limited ammo and all that
Also it's like a resident evil 4 kinda 3rd person shooter
Now I wanna break their fuckin tiny necks
You don't meet too many other characters, and the bad guys are elementary school kids
Dgrp another episode ultra despair girls is weird

every movie without fail
*when*
not if
"take a shot when jason throws someone out of a window"
like
and because theres a formula to the movies you can make a drinking game
in the 7th he takes a boat to manhattan
in the 9th movie jason gets augmented with nanomachines and in the tenth he goes to the moon
they are fucking hilarious
have you seen the original friday the 13th movies
but i also like masterpieces
i like garbage anime
nvm i cant make it sound good
I do enjoy estival vs on pc
When Japan figures out pcs
In a couple years
I might have a knack for this game
cus winning ranked matches this much is getting boring
if anyone has senran kagura peach beach splash on ps4, add me i need a co-op buddy

Also because kaito is kamina, he's prime husbando
My mind was fucked
Also I just finished the first class trial
fte?
i like tojos design the most of the girls
* sweats profusely *
What kind of.... Idiot would do that
Y-yeah

Yo this game ***gets*** me
I love that kaito momota is voiced by Kyle hebert
I don't think that's possible but maybe
Ta da, your game has now crashed
Put barrel 1 in barrel 3
And using the inventory
Then put barrel 3 in barrel 2
Put barrel 2 in barrel 1
1 2 and 3
Apparently you can crash dos 2 with just 3 barrels
But none of my state side friends have it so it's really hard to just have a campaign
Dos2 is one of my favorite games rn
<@170426616759975936> IT WAS A BAIT AND SWITCH my waifu is fine
eeehhhhh
ive done 2 episodes of future arc and 2 episodes of despair arc
no
i worked so hard to finish asahinas report card in trigger happy havoc
<@!170426616759975936>  THIS IS FUCKING BULLSHIT
Trust me, when I binge hard I can finish this no problem

The devs for A hat in time are great
And it got a 7/10 simply because it has full voice acting (which can be turned off)
A hat in time is fuckin amazing

Well he knew what he was doing
YOU GUYS A HAT IN TIME IS SO GOOD
I sell propane and propane accessories

me_irl
Mood
But I still gained rank
FINALLY lost a game
And shooting doesn't reveal you
<@246146781832806401> part of me feels like the ability to go invisible for 15 seconds when your gun has a ttk of like 3 seconds is overpowered
I can't be stopped
It's triple 6 now
But that's just because the mini gun is op
To be fair  <@184465748431863812> I beat a 5th tier in my first game
What beautiful matchmaking
Night
Anywho I'm done for tonight, got work early af
Zeni
But she's op
Estival let's you do missions as daidoji anytime iirc
Estival vs is way upgraded
But I had to have pbs as soon as possible so I got the PS4 game

I put a bunch of tiny electronic candles behind my soldier 76 mask and took a picture
I also voted for jaune arc, yatsuhashi daichi and mercury black

Storm 4 was a good decision
I think I'll try platinum trophy for ultimate ninja storm 4

My favourite racing game was split second
I had flat out in 04
And you only need red for crazy moves
All 3 at once equals all three stronger
White is move speed, orange is knockback resist and red is damage
<@174440042289168384> whats in the dlc?
And I don't caaaaaaaaaaaaaare
But now I'm doing the hebi/taka arc
I just finished the hidan/kakuzu fight which was cool
Can't even buy anything with storm points
Cool
Ok the ranks have no meaning
when you lose 58% of your hp in the fight and still get s rank
That's fucked up
What I can't forgive is skipping the zabuza arc so that naruto's 1 tail form has more impact in storm 1
I can see why they do it sometimes
When you oversleep
unless they added a racing mode
why is rocket league in the racing category?

Congratulations to the naruto to boruto shinobi strikers beta, for ending before I could get into a game
Still haven't done anything besides the tutorial
Update
But it's just naruto xenoverse
I had the exact same thought <@99158582326497280>
I did the tutorial and haven't been allowed in the game since
The shinobi strikers beta has spent it's entirety of the first day 90% in maintenance
A symphogear community?
Also btw I put like 60 hours on nier automata on PS4 my frames never dropped
<@231025503643893770> you should play monster hunter with me sometime, I just incorporated the wiggler hat into my build and it's great

<@174440042289168384> you're a patriots fan?

Obv I'm a fucking egg my dood
Because PlayStation is being a bunch of cucks about the issue
It's the only remnant of my dark past I haven't discarded
<@127644949884698624> listen every body has some dark past
I'm appljakk (until the very second psn lets me change my name)
I love RWBY fak yuu
I wanted ctb to play a game with rwby characters in it, because God knows rooster teeth can't do it
I don't need the dlc
But the characters I want are all free
Ah yes
Ctb?
Beat my big brother, felt REALLY good about it
I played Tekken once, I played the bear and I was in grade school
Ah
Last real fighting game I owned was SC 4
Most of my racing game pedigree is in flat out and split/second
I think I acclimatized pretty quickly to paradise
BuT thAtS KiE Ay dAYs LIe
EVEN IN RACING GAMES I CANT ESCAPE THIS FUCKING SONG
<@231025503643893770> wish my real drivers license looked like this
Since only one person needs it to play coop
I'm probably going to get a way out
Nice
I thought it was your initials
Its really fun
Just did a lot of a way out
A way out is available, now to wait for someone to play with

20% off anything you want if you watch a video about MLB the show 2018
Just had a multiplayer game of burnout paradise and we devolved into a demolition derby and it felt like top bants
**so many poppos**
So many trap cards
Having orange juice flashbacks
It's such a damn good game
I beat "a way out" last night
A real man keeps moving forward
I have 0 backlogs
Its really good but requires  2 people
<@188714906143424513> after some light googling, I'd say it's not like that game past the fact that it's coop
Never played it
<@188714906143424513> if they made a way out movie, I'd watch it
After future Barron trump brought out his no fun tank I couldn't win
I never beat Valkyrie chronicles
I beat data larxene on critical! FUCK I've been trying to do that for forever

<@174440042289168384> that final combo had me like
I'm really dreading roxas
https://youtu.be/vsD44sj9yU4

Uploading it to YouTube rn

I'm in the process of recording my fights with data 13
I like kingdom hearts
<@188714906143424513>
I'm just trying to use the casual strats I'm learning from bloodybizkits097
Pls explain
<@263983345669505025>
That's where you only do the first half of his ex right?
I'm not one for fatal crest but to each their own
Nice
Is that your friend
Their ais will have different patterns and maybe even different moves
Proud mode and critical are worlds apart though
And lingerie Willie can kiss my ass
No it's not level 1
But data is gonna suck
Until I listened to the strat and beat him first try
Marluxias absent silhouette was an ass
And I'm not about to grind to level 99 just for him
He's gonna be tough cus I can only get hit 79 times
Marluxia
I'm saving mansex for last
Who should I fight next
Minus the time I was at work and such
This took me all day
https://youtu.be/e5zZOfLe7KQ
Enjoying it, chose Rowlet and named him "tux"
And Pokémon sun cus I hadn't played it
I went to gamestop today and bought a pre-owned "new 3ds"
Speaking of Pokémon
That's too dark for a kids franchise <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
Any trainer who makes their Pokémon so happy they undergo a genetic mutation, isn't going to 180 like that imo
<@127644949884698624> evolution is irreversible
Like sylveon
It's also my shortest data battle at 1:47
4 left
Data axel down!
<@263983345669505025> <@174440042289168384> I just beat demyx

From my hero academia
<@99158582326497280> 
https://goo.gl/images/q9XzfE
My trainer looks familiar

Yes
And good thing it activated there and not at 99 forms like the fight right before
Yeah

<@263983345669505025>  <@174440042289168384>
And I won anyway
The game decided to handicap me
Just Roxas and xemnas now
You're gonna wanna see it

<@174440042289168384> im pretty sure i cant beat roxas
Why is that toilet filled with fire wood

"Tux healed his burn through sheer determination so his trainer wouldn't worry"
He just likes me so much he said "nah I'm not burned"
That's an ability, my Pokemon doesn't have it
<@127644949884698624> different thing
How would that even work
But like
My Pokemon healed its burn through sheer determination

<@273256087107403777> should kirika be Darksiders 2
Testament bikki is asuras wrath
I miss the Scott pilgrim video game
WOULD PLAY
The game
Symphogear vs the world
Kingdom hearts in a nutshell
It's Spider-Man silly

I always end up coming back to this PS4 theme
I don't even play wot
On the less awesome end of the spectrum
New PS4 arrived finally!
I assumed he was
Why not young Goku with the nimbus
Or I guess I should have pinged trippy instead
What's wrong with normal goku
<@188714906143424513>
Yays externally
Not much god killing in this one, they're definitely saving it for later
It will be remembered as one of the more lame ones I bet
But if the next game(s) are more exciting
Awesome
Finished god of war this morning

To get away from what's real
That's why I play video games
Realism is for nerds
Like steep?
Is it a snowboard game?
Showed me anime was more than naruto
Ttgl was not my first but it was my gateway
So I tend to watch anything trigger puts out, tho I haven't seen franxxx
Ttgl is my number 1 of all time
I fuckin love little witch academia
I really like kiznaiver
<@188714906143424513>
That scene where ryuko slams a chair and puts one leg on it is actually my favourite bit of non action animation in kill la kill
I like rwby


Valkyrie boss fights still kick my ass
And brought the difficulty down to explore
I beat gow on hard
Well tbf I'm never going to fight Luxord again
The difference between me beating data saix the first time and beating him now is 4 whole minutes
Style points
https://youtu.be/BryJYovkBXI  <@263983345669505025> very fond of the actual killing blow
<@263983345669505025> is it a case of good gameplay bad story?
Kingdom hearts in a nutshell
im really not enjoying the people who let me win and them completely destroy me twice in a row
im really enjoying ruby
as my first real fighting game
Its very fun to me
I did a thing
https://youtu.be/NTOvgd9E9Uo
But here I am with 7 actual wins and 1 asshole who let me win
I never thought I would beat actual people at a non Naruto fighting game
Once people with less than 99 wins approach me I kindof have a chance
I got a resonance finisher as ruby rose and it was fucking cool
I think I'm better with analog stick than I am with dpad
Fighting games are hard
In other news, my thumb hurts a lot right now.
Good references in the extra color palettes





It's fucking great
I got a Nintendo switch
3???
My PC couldn't run it lol
I never finished bayo 1 either
I saw Bayonetta and the other witch riding on top of f-16s and I caved
I'm addicted to stardew Valley and I love my wife
<@193408538909868033> in stardew valley
<@193408538909868033> penny
I couldn't just let her be there
Yeah
I swear she keeps finding new ways to make me go "aawwwwww"
Penny is adorable lovable fluff ball the entire time
I think
My best friend chose Haley too
Currently Wondering if 4 spouses will increase the rate of "I woke up early and watered your crops" event
I plan on marrying penny Because I will never not marry penny
And marriage is also still there we think
So everyone getting a max backpack is 48k total
And wallet is shared
Backpacks are separate progression
Important things
And planted like 200 strawberries year one
We made a huuuuuge farm
Came back before an hour passed in game
One guy crashed once in an hours long session
Didn't have any desync
Holy shit it's so much fun
I did multiplayer stardew Valley for the first time with my best friends
https://youtu.be/x3vmFWmYwt8
My favorite vn series

I GET THE FIRST MID QUEST DISCONNECT IVE HAD SINCE MARCH

I never had a problem understanding kingdom hearts story
She's best
NOT WHAT I TYPED BUT OK
Futaba best gril
I want to save them
I feel so bad for my sad trio of birth by sleep kids
Finally beat WoL today
***STILT MAN***

Mysterio

Electro has scars resembling his comic book mask
Never felt so vindicated
RIDLEY IN SMASH, THE MEME IS DEAD
Been playing octopath traveler demo
I didn't think I'd like it this much
I've been at work for 4/6  hours and all I want to do is play octopath traveler
Nvm I can't read
Kill me I shouldn't have bought mario odyssey
Just realized octopath traveler is already released
10/10
Aside from the actual heist missions
I liked the non combat parts of p5 more than the combat
Primrose best girl
Olberic the warrior is voiced by endeavour
Dope game
Such a fucking great game
I cried for 2b
But yellow orbs are expensive and sometimes I get killed by bosses
It hasn't happened to me
Start from mission 1?
What happens if I die with no yellow orbs in dmc2001
<@263983345669505025> just curious
I opted out of easy
This camera is like cancer if every white blood cell had a Hitler mustache
But it's cool
I hate it
Dmc4 was the only one I ever played
I got the dmc hd collection
He said "there's one song that any FF concert would be remiss without, and you can even sing along, because you really only need to know one word"
And a minute later he comes back like, "you fucking thought, here's OWA"
Conductor walks out
Played the final fantasy ending music and credits roll on the back screen

What is SRR ?
Three days till octopath traveler
Right now you can only do [BAYONET CHARGE]
Beat saber needs more than red and blue colors, cus all the duets need the various colors
YO I JUST REALIZED SRR LOGO
Not a big fan of toriyamas artstyle so idrc about DQ
I like turn based(fucking octopath my dude) but I don't like neptunias like, "turnbased but you move around" thing
SICK
https://youtu.be/kTf6t3zAuGo this is the most relatable video I've ever seen on youtube

"Letten the hunt beginnen"
Her battle quote is "Letten my arrow flyen true"
Haanit talks so weird
New demo
All 8
Get the 3 hour demo and learn to hate haanits guts for talking like a moron

R/shitpostpathtraveler made sure of that
A game doesn't need to be released for memes to be made silly
13th
Probably not getting it
On sale
I sort by great deals it's top billing as 4$
Only 10-12 tracks eeehhhhh
I'm looking at it
Riptide is a Motocross on water game
And looks dope

Riptide has 9/10 on steam
🔥
That music is dope tho
If I get Celeste I'm scared I'm gonna break my switch
I did the srr demo and I wasn't crazy about it
Too much
Any recommendations for me?
I have 16.80 in eshop coins

Fuckin lods of emone

Get octopath it's fucking cool
NGL THE SWITCH IS SOOOOO GOOD
One of them is from RWBY and it's hard as fuck
Rock band 4 has two new songs today
Changing the sex of anyone(in the wagon) causes it to flip around wildly
If one little thing is changed it freaks the fuck out
Skyrims opening scene is the most high maintenance thing in the whole game
I do have an ssd
