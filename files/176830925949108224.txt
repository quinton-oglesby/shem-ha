I'm already a Hibiki
_the Kirika in me is strong_
Indeed!
~~no but srsly, people say I am a lot like Kirika~~
Dess!!
Hey guys, I just wanna say that my birthday is on April 13th, dess
hello!
Alright!
Ihere!
And I hope I get Tsubasa's figma someday
I'm still happy that I've got Hibiki for christmas =v=
More floofy goodness
Thanks!
<@!193408538909868033> again, thanks for the screenshot! I am this far with the model now!
The texture are there!
And dis border for the character
And I also drew this OC
Like, I made these clouds just by experimenting a new brush on the PC
I did it for clouds too
or hell, even experiment on things
Or look at tutorials
^^^^^^^^^^
using a drawing tablet
And thanks! I have been drawing and conceptualizing characters on the PC for 3 years now
oh
And I also drew here a month or two ago
I guess Kira's referring to that some roleplayers uses pictures as a way to express the character's emotions
Ohhh
Kira said it and I'm like: nani?
Wait, you Rp?<@!87512939107450880>
Mood
So i drew my character going **NYOOM**

Speaking of smug
Eyup
Okie! Good night!
True
I just have waaay too much time in my hands, that's all ^^''
Mhm!
I do it from time to time for characters I want to model
what I'm saying is that you can make concept art for 3D characters if you've got the skills for it too
Also an advice. If you can draw, you can conceptualize models like I did for mine!
yw!
Well, I did start drawing at a very early age and continued at it. But uuugh what was my traditional art skills criiinge
And I've also drew the girl from before in another form of hers
y'know what I mean. Experimenting never hurts
Maybe???
So I doodled acertain elf girl c:
I drew some thing for my OC because why not
zenbu gundam
Indeed!
<@!378750276057694213> I also drew Kiana too
Ayyyyyy
<@!378750276057694213> eyup!
yeah, but this is again node based with a matcap and the stars as textures
Actually, I use a matcap texture so that's why
I've got a lovely bunch of dragon balls
Well either way, I might  use that portal effect for something
Blender doesn't have a built in game engine anymore since 2.8
Oh really? Well since Godot will have an updated FBX importer system in game I hope to try that out for sure!
Now the portals animated
https://youtu.be/iVSIiRQITgk
I has portals
Am working on house
Have some fire
Oh
<@!354236264595324928> Well, you've got a lot of free time to do so, right? ovo/
np
I t hink this is the one
Uhhh lemme check
the rest of the outfit
the skirt
the other cuff
the shoes
The wings
There are 7 things i still need to do before I can say her model is finished
Yeah, I've got a plugin that allows me apply modifiers while shape keys are present in the model
_I am not looking forward to it_
Specifically facial rigging
Though speaking of modeling, the annoying part of this project is basically soon upon me: Rigging
<@!237964037898502144> Yeah I do! I model in 2.79 and put them in toon shader in 2.9
Eheh, thanks!

Did some more work on the model
My current progress on modeling
Mhm!
The armband has been exported
Working on the OC model again and I am happy with how this is turning out
That moment when you're learning how to make animu grass
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/481557490387910656/780417924699390022/unknown.png
Testing the rig of my OC in MMD, but also god damn does this look good with autoluminous/bloom on the glowing effects
_Genocide and genocide_
Genocide
Thanks! But the work tho...It's...
But aside from facial rigging which I still need to learn to do, I'm almost done
Wings that I've made like 3 to 4 days ago
Yeee, wings
Reusing the old twintails mesh because I'm lazy, but also because it looks so good even to this day
Grand blue
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaand guilty gear and dragon ball fighterz
I know right?
Mhm! It's what I was aiming for usually, especially in art
**AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA**
Also
The outline however is just a mix of the solidify modifier and just a texture
Well, the shading is an effect AND textured too
Tho fortunately there's always the future to look forward to!
Maybe? I mean, if you look closely it's  actually trash tier in terms of texturing <:KirikaCry:674720015047720961>
_Well, not 3 years, more like 3 days, but you get what I mean_
DONE
AFTER 3 YEARS
THE SHOES
I see
Naisu! And nice shading too! I love that you did it traditionally too! Are you going to color them someday?
I'm using both. The newest one for Nodes and the older one for modeling
thanks!
<:KanadeWink:690470895608791040>
I plan to finish her before 2021
yee. Tho I look forward to just finishing the model tho ' '
Bits and pieces, but I do have a name, age and an idea of what to make of the characters, especially for the pink one and her blonde haired brother
Mhm! Tho that outfit I'm currently making is like my world's equivalent of a symphogear in terms of being armor
As well as the same character but in a different outfit
Ahh yee
part of me wants to use her in a game, but then again, I don't know
and honestly I don't know
And I plan to mainly focus on the shoe for tomorrow instead of working on it alongside other stuff at the same day
Mhm
The next is just mainly focusing on the shoe seeing how complicated of a model it would be
My current goal for today is to get the right cuff done
Oof ;v;/
that I designed from scratch
I have a whole character model for her
Tho then again...
Imagination
I know right? That's what I thought to myself!
Today I've currently finished the skirt and the wings
Oh
¯\\_(ツ)\_/¯
Smug

At least she packing stuff
You mean a gaynado?
https://tenor.com/KC9C.gif
So she a deadly laser?
KEK
_Hibiki, you don't get the shading memo, do you?_
wait...
Now compare Hanaka to Hibiki and you'll see--
Also, compare Hanaka to Nanoko-- the character I got mainly inspired by and I don't see any similarities c:
Nah, those wings are bendable, like Kiana Knight Moonbeam's wings, the main inspiration to them
Oh? o_O
She ain't done as I have texturing work and perfecting the rigging work, but I love how she looks already
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/673598787503259658/786229575083622416/unknown.png
She's nearly done in terms of outfit...But I just gave her a thigh squished by socks part
Now the mid boobs are covered
shoes and leg armor*
She comin' together!
Time to work on the torso part
<@!740195087895756820> As an MMDer, I laugh too :v
Yeeeee
And her wings too-- It's just basically a physics day for me
Also rigged the skirt too, so that's fun
_They bounce_
<@!237964037898502144> Good news pal
MOOD
I know right?
I am hella excited and hyped about my model xD
What I'm saying here is....
Thanks! If I'm honest here, I'm fangushing like a lil kid seeing their favorite person in real life
<@!237964037898502144>

Ah right. It's a shadow issue
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/402836591170551810/788137864738242610/unknown.png

Speaking of faces, which one of the two faces do you guys like more? The left (updated) or the right?
The one who knows what's up
The one who wants to buy it
_That moment when one pretends to be a couple so that you can get a 50% discount on a product_
Also
Dragon gorilla\
_Not right here_
Something's....
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/623223130244251668/788080891964162048/unknown.png
In this life she too busy to get it on with anyone
In her past life she is :v
and gayness, that too
cuz cute and cool is basically symphogear in a nutshell :v
Or more specifically:
_Symphogear vibes_
Just put her in a pose
Finally did the right cuff, so yeah
Tested that on one of my other OC's hoodie and oh my goodness
Just finished the animu material shader <:VanessaCracked:639136452600397829>
LASER EYES
Who has wings
Who is also smug
Who's ready for action
A cutie patootie
**OwO**
vwv
owo
it is useful for some effects c:
But for me, it
They're really useful for like high tech stuff
I've already added said effect, but also that blue hue ring
Tho I'm thinking of making a trimsheet texture for her effects
Hecc, it was so easy, I even made it a few minutes ago xD
Thanks! That was basically the easiest thing to make of the things in this picture
Indeed! And those who are against dabbing, get ready to battle her xD
Yay
I meant imagine her with Kirika I meant what if the two were together as pals :v
Indeed. Good luck with lewding her tho xD
Thanks!
_And now imagine her with Kirika_
A 16 year old waifu thatt can also kick your butt :v
a 16 year old waifu :v

Back of her head remodeled, finally
Nice!
Awww, thanks!
Mhm. Probably the most unique design out of all of my characters
That and her model which her hair still needs to be improved upon
Mhm! I have a whole front concept for her done
Speaking of, I know now what color my robo queen OC's mouth would be
I know right?
Like, matching the chin outline of the WIP one (which I am putting it in a red outline) with the current one you can see that the outline on the current face isn't matching the red outline
And with the face that I'm currently using (the left one) I noticed that said left one has a slight bump on her chin compared to the center face and right one
She also got a boyfriend/future husband in the main timeline c:
And thanks!
Hence why the rings are there on the screenshot
Actually, they're supposed to be glass orbs so I know what textures I have to set the materials to to get the glass effects on the orbs you see on this pinkie c:
Preparing some stuff for another character to model = v=/
That looks pretty damn good tho
OOF
_That's why I speak germain_
_I know my german sucks_
_**SIND WIR DER ESSEN NEIN WIR SIND DE JAEGER--**_
MENACING
Is it just me or is she be lookin' kinda **_T H I C C_**
they're got gravity disabled
both
Emission wings :v
So I got the wings to glow now
Flight of the bumbefloofs
Sharing this here just because

The bottom left you mean or the top left?
_Ngl, this is looking like a legitimate website now_
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/655167339779588096/791316410126565416/unknown.png
As for me, I'm currently designing an armored female holy knight/Valkyrie kind of woman
Ohhh, I like it!
Ohhh I like it! The right arm funnily enough reminds me of either Angelic Buster from Maplestory or Megaman
_Current progress_
_Yes, I listen to so many stuff and am too lazy to close any of them_
Second website training and already it's looking a little bit more like how I wanted it to be
I've learned how to use the fonts that was saved in the local folders
Actually, I want to one day have my websites look as flashy as the one from HI3
Ayyyyy
Yeeeee
_Eyuo_
https://tenor.com/IEEk.gif
A shitty website to train, but oh well
STONK
_Cute until she clubbers a monster to death_
Some quick strokes of my pen and lots of ctrl+z since I almost NEVER do it in one time ;v;/
In terms of straight lines
Well I don't :v
So I drew this waifu today c:
At least the dork quickly got used to it for a couple of reasons
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Why he became a girl?
There's a couple of reasons, but one of them is that he uses a magical ring that holds the power of the wielder of that armor
She one of the alternate timeline stories for this blonde dork
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Then again, at that point, maybe time travel is possible
Since the game's story takes place 2000+ years before she exist
Then again, maybe I'll find a way to make her part of the story so she wouldn't be DLC
maybe DLC?
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
**SHE'S DONE**
too*
_Cagliostro might highly approve of her t oo_
BUUUUUUUUUUUUUT she's looking good IMO
She's yet to be fully colored
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
But also to for practice purposes. if it ends up being the way I want it to be then I'll likely use it for said game prototype's webpage. Other then that?
That too
Yeee, plus my PC's hella powerful
DERP
Oh
I see <:HibikiThink:688429715362414641>
Indeed. Part of that is thanks to her dragon blood, but also because of the ring that she wields
_And if she was a little bit taller, she would be considered a titan as well_
This valkyrie I drew a few days or a week ago? She'll be one of those Valkyries who wield the title of Bahamut
Yeah. Barricade users are mostly shield users. Beserkers mostly use close range weapons and Thegns are also mostly close range users, though long range weapons like bows and such
I have yet to think of a title for long range users as of now
Indeed
Mhm. These kinds of higher up Valkyries are known as Freyja. They're pretty much the leaders of the Valkyrie society. 
Actually, I have the current progress of the titles and such in this txt file
I also have ranks/titles for the Valkyries if you're curious about it
That's basically the gist of it. Then again, it's a WIP
_I wanted t oshare some kind of WIP for the bio for the Valkyrie society that I've been working on this week so here y'all go!_
**“Not many people have seen Valkyries in their life and those that did even fewer have lived to tell the tale. If you see one during a battle, pray to god that the Valkyries will be on your side.”**
On the eastern side of the planet in which Lawain resides, there exist a society of female warriors that brings judgement upon those who they see unfit to live.
These warriors– Valkyries, originated 2.500 years ago, originally as a special force that the military force of Lawain can call upon. Now they live to fight in the name of the goddess of life and death.
In times where they’re not needed or do not need to battle, they’re mostly staying at their home in the east side of the planet. Though there are those who wishes to travel. Those who do mostly are in it to expand their knowledge or to find a good place to either train or find a tavern/bar to buy a drink or two.
Thanks! I mostly got inspired by shakespear from honkai impact
Doodling a valkyrie OC once more
_True art_
**EXPAND LE CONTENT**
Ah yes...
Designing a freyja class/ rank valkyrie
Noice!
It's new years and what am I doing?
_trying out my model on a game engine_
Nice uvs
It does look good yeee! What would it be used for if I may ask?
Maybe it'll be a minigame where you can get a achievement and a reward c:
KEK
So I've modeled my own football today
Maybe
TIME FOR SOCCER
_I LOVE BALLS_
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/402836591170551810/796419308883542056/unknown.png
Oof
_booty blaster_
_butt rocket_
She be walkin
I think I'll be using physics to determine that like how I did in my MMD model and/or how Honkai Impact did it with the wing parts for Knight Moonbeam / Herrscher of the Void Kiana
Besides, if I want to do the rest all I have to do is make some in blender, export the throwaway model with the animations to godot, save the animations and delete said throwaway model 😛
_Ima do the basics first before doing the rest_
Ima try doing the simple walk, run, idle, jumping, dashing maybe
YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
DOING SOME ANIMATION WORK
_Are you oki doki doki?_
Uhhhh...Hanaka?
So I'm trying out a new camera node and I think it looks pretty nice so far!
Oh yeah that you can!
I think it's easy to work in. It uses it's own scripting language, but it's rather easy to learn so far
So I made me toon shader in Godot today c:

<:MariaYell:336657352264646657>
> _noise_
It's a looking good now
Indeed! It'll turn your head inside out!
Punishing people is raising it a bit much :v
It's hard to for the pun police to pun-ish me cause I am the pun police c:\
_Ba dum tss_
Doing some more blender modeling work. This time I'm escalating it to a whole other level
Funny enough, I saw something about mario strikers on Deviantart today
Glowing soccer ball :v
KEK
I found this outfit model yesterday and I HAD to make her wear it ;w;/
_ara ara_
Indeedy
Working on a hud c:
HUMONGOUS SNEK
Snekroom made
True
IT'S A BIG SNEK
Who likes big snek?
BICC-A-THICC
Grass became a bit too bicc
I has grass
Anyway, I'm going to try and learn how a segmented enemy works
or C: it's the actual size and the other one's gigantic
Actual snek size c:
Hud's working now!
that's why I nicknamed her floofball :v
no problemo!
Nice! I look forward to your progress!
you have an electric guitar too? Nice!
👀
now we need it to change shape and then we have a transformer
Trans - the LEG
well, pink and teal
It's definitely nice looking! Pink and blue
Just found out spmaps in mmd shaders are actually rougness maps c:
Already on it
Yeeeeee!
Though this is just a concept art of her previous version. I will be using her newer model's base and model the outfit around that
I've decided to start modeling Hanaka's school uniform c:
_It is..._

HLSL is difficult IMO because the tutorials aren't there so far as I can see, right?
I'm doing it very slowly, but I am starting to get to writing my anime shader for MMD

but god damn
This ain't done,
Those are more like belts, but yee those are basically cloth hoops too
Wait till she colored
A WIP for now, but I am drawing another one of my many OCs
I've been meaning to get a midi keyboard so I can make melody more then 1 octave long, but I kinda like how this has been going
That radiates stonks feels tbh
I did a blender render test using the new shader c:
I doodled a God
Someone mentioned that too
Indeed
https://tenor.com/uQST.gif
I'm thinking of redoing one of my other OC's hairstyle and keep the anime theme of it in mind
And make them fall slower
She's more or less inspired by her and by Hanaka-- the pinkette who's model I made in december!
One of the character with them most change to it's inspiration material has to be Jinki, aka this one
I played lots of Maplestory back in the day
I see
--er, well. Read
Really? That's surprising to hear tbh
Mhm. That's why I am asking for other people's opinions about her
The design tbh. Angelic Buster is from the game Maplestory-- a very famous MMORPG game from the company Nexon, a famous MMORPG company.

And there's Tsukine who I've yet to have a story and such
Mhm, Angelic Buster is basically contracted by a pervy magical dragon
Which makes me somewhat unsure about her design
True, true.
Compared to Angelic buster (the pinkette I was inspired by) it's much different then before
You can think of that as one, yes
This design tho for the right one is much different the left one, to the point where I'm pretty comfortable with using it-- even though I plan to use this as a upgraded form or an ult. form
It's fine. I'm glad you've responded appropriately. While I really like the right pinkette's design, I had been thinking about similar the two were honestly
Ahh, gotcha
But I was more or less asking if you guys find one of the two similair to the other
I mean yeah she cute not gonna lie
I just realized that the pinkette on the right that I drew a while ago looks more like the one on the left now that I think about it :/

What do you guys think?
Oh that means quirks are gonna be a thing too
That or we can parent the symphokiddos c:
that means Symphogear's becoming real too
~~if it is then holy shit one of my OCs might've become real~~
_Oh_
**CRASH**
I have a robo OC who's got a supercomputer inside of her. She will definitely not--
This was how it started off at
Aaaaa thanks!
I did a little drum beat test ;v;/

I'll let you all be the judge of that c:
I already am!
Am learning modular synthesis <:KirikaSalute:620069889838809089>
_Rozaliya no--_
Yeah, it is! (Tho it's just a midi sample of a drumline)
Oof, plus it's an MP3 file .w.
practicing with mixing and mastering drums.. Any critique you guys wanna send?
_I can see why drummers need a lot of inputs_
So I'm learning how to use these mix busses and...
True, true
Hmmm I don't think I've done something exactly like that, no
Time to UV map
Funnily enough the most polygons on the sword is the hilt/wristguard portion
A sword sword
eyup!
Added some lil details at the hilt and oh mah goodness
Current progress on blade c:
I'm working on a sword c:
Yoooo that's a one sicc artstyle!
Man I love vocoders
But a boss weapon
Fortunately this weapon is not a gacha weapon
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
I've improved it a lil bit
:3c
I guess?
Ohhh
Transistor?
My first animation render
https://youtu.be/UpS9vsNXXBc
the render can easily be used as an icon
Yeaa, but still
Maybe?
I mean, outside of the dots and aftershadow and maybe the white outline, I guess it can be used as a weapon selection icon
_This just looks 2D now_
...
I've tweaked the shader a bit and it looks perfect IMO
Same sword but with a custom anime shader in blender
The sword's basically done now =v=
Ahh gotcha
the light blue on the right?
Eyup
👍
Hmmmm 🤔
Naisu!
Mhm! It's basically FireAlpaca, but it's got online account features with more stuff dedicated for manga like art
I use a drawing program called Medibang to do it. I export my UV maps in blender, import them to medibang and work on there
I'm currently doing the texture test on Blender since it's way easier then in PMX editor
I've just added a lil cresent/logo thing on her sword now
Mhm and she's 158cm c:
Yea it's pretty THICC
And let's not forget the blade herself Tsubasa <:MariaConfident:336657338729627658>
And that one guy from bezerker
_points at Cloud_
Welp
Tho to see the pixels you need to be very close to the weapon which most people don't
**YEAH, HELLO KIANA!?**
_Kiana is that  you?_
I was doodling an OC of mine as an elf and...
I've just checked how HI3's camera works and it appears to be a falloff/easing of the camera turn and I've only noticed that now thanks to your comment on my camera movement so thanks!
My life in a nutshell
_How many indicators do you want?_

**Y E S**
_\Funny how you said that as if it's not (yet) happening in her story_
She got compressed
Well then
There's no fall off yet, but maybe I can add it as an option?
Here's a lil recording how the camera is turning out
https://youtu.be/vGt_7W4aIbI
I fixed something about the camera since it doesn't turn sideways when you turn the two thumbsticks opposite to eachother
One terrified waifu
That moment when you go
_A boobie trap that actually catches boobies_
_Amazing_
That moment when gacha
I was doodling yesterday and it turned out the doodle looks so good that I might make a concept of that design
A priest and a samurai walk into a club
When your waifu is a legend...
_In drinking_
Mhm :3
Then it again, 5000/5000hp is basically 5000 hp left out of the 5000 hp
Maybe?
I mean...
I've just noticed that now
It's starting to look like something at least
Welp
I feel like working on a level today
Fixing some more camera things
Ahh okie
What's it supposed to be if I may ask?
When you're bored enough to make a wallpaper of your characters
what's it gonna be?
👀
He turned out good!
Mhm!
specifically in the proportion spectrum
Drawing him makes me realize how much I've improved in terms of artstyle
I'm glad I'm not the only one who noticed the J.J similarities on him!
that profile name tho
I've tried to make a pixelart version of a hud, so I did
_This face is a mood_
I did a meme
She a mafia boss mom
So I'm designing a new character
I've made an elf girl
Sooooo
Hmmm...
Which version shall I go with? 🤔
Also, dialogue system is coming together nicely
_It shoots laser beams_
Nope.
Or I am planning to make it do things
_It actually does things_
Except unlike Navi
BEHOLD...
_glass fairy thingy_
In all seriousness, I actually worked on my dialogue system BECAUSE of the json files
https://tenor.com/bshaU.gif
It's not much, but coding wise it's nicer for me to work on in the long run
I've been thinking of updating my dialogue system that I've first implemented in my old prototype from a year ago
^
Exactly. I was going for a pixelart aesthetic
These are just sprites for now. However I do plan to make them functional
I made some sprites today!
and it seems like it's working perfectly! Transitions included!
Welp, I did bit of practice on how to make it slanted
And I think I know how to pull it off
Mhm
but yeah, that's what I am planning to do
I think--
Nah. More like this (a fellow godot user made this in a game jam)
I was thinking of giving the buttons a more of a diagonal offset too
Mhm. Though that too is just a placeholder. Like I said, the menu screen for now is just a giant placeholder. Everything here is a placeholder with the only exception being the text on the bottom left
Mhm. I'm thinking of giving it more of a space like theme
True true. Then again the main menu screen as of now is just a giant placeholder. I have yet to work on the fancy transitions and such and the background to make it work
_I should really make better menu screens then this_
_jfc_
_It doesn't cause it's an audio bus_
Not the bus, but the audio it can
Time to work on the busses 😎
Trying to make a menu screen is hecc
_Reality_
Expectations
The scren's looking better and better as a prototype
_Well that helps a ton tbh_
WELL TURNS OUT THERE'S A WAY TO TURN THE LINEAR VALUE OF THE SLIDER TO DB
That's because I've already had that finished, just the style was something that i needed to change
_Honestly, It's a bit sharper then expected_
I've just tried it on this prototype option screen and...
I see
Monospaced?
And anti aliasing off
The font i use is Ebrima, text size 14, bold and outline size to 1 pixel
Ahh yes, the highlight

An ikea salesman with a love for his tuna--
I wanted it to fit one of my character's color theme, but instead it's looking like an xbox desk setup--
It's starting to look like something!
Decided to work on furnitures for once--
Genshin bs and stuff I guess
idk
Eyup--
I got so bored today that I decided to record a video and edit it to try it out--
https://youtu.be/WyDlviwPpME
I see 🤔
Yeah I've seen his videos, I might use some of his tips and tricks on my models too--
Currently in this version specifically I'm using standard shading, tho I do plan to add normal editing to it--
Yeah, but when you see them textured they look nice--
Yeah, the current version also has a lot of vertices, but a bit less and is currently using a subsurface division modifier for easier modeling
Yeah, the old model had issues with the cheeks, the normals and the shapekeys itself
Mhm. That and the overal mesh since the current version uses the old face mesh
the eye lashes and eyes itself probably
Working on the face again
So I felt like doodling some more--
Designing an upgraded form for an OC of mine =~=
One lil post editing later
Nice--

Also bored so I posed again
Also--

Then I'll go for both then!
With the pink one for the demon form
I need some input. Which of the two looks better as a succubus? The left one or the right one?
Me working on a succubus OC
~~_And a qiqi_~~
_~~Gives u amber 2.0~~_
_when RNJesus hates you_
maybe? I'm not sure if I'll finish it tbh xD
When you're of the last survivors from your planet, who is also currently looking at the direction of the former planet which may or may not be in ruins

When a robot's love for another is so strong that they changed form along the way
WIP maybe. Might finish this or not, idk--
Well then I'll have myself some hooters c:
Have a tsun I needa fully finish drawing and color--
"hey, I only have one arm. Where's my happy time arm?"
Naisu!
you bet
https://tenor.com/beIyh.gif
_That's because she is_
:3
_One tsun coming right up_
dr. WAIFU robotknik
_EGGHEAD_
5+ years or so I think???
Bigger mood
But I will do a lil quick ghetto one to start it off =v=
The stockings and armwarmers shall be done once the base of the model is done :v
Mood tbh
https://tenor.com/bKXKQ.gif
<:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
One thing for certain: Like Bikki, she's got the charm point :v
Thankies!
She considers herself a magical girl and other's consider her one too, but she's actually a magician/wizard rather then a traditional magical girl c:
KEK
And this is the girl Imma model =v=
Boots made from scratch c:
I've designed those boots myself and is actually part of an outfit for an OC I'm mkaing <:ChrisWave:738169593574719568>
The shoe need a wee bit more work in the UV department, especially on it's nose, but for the rest the shoes are done!
True true
These shoes are made for walking
And I'm working on a new model!
Naisu--
<:KirikaMad:688188152891834417>
_whatevs_
_TMW you're not interested in anything_
I've actually just been curious how said hair would look like on the head
It is actually the same character's hair
The one with the boots I've made this week?
WHY DOES THAT FACE GO WITH THAT HAIRSTYLE SO WELL--
<:ChrisShock:620077681484103680>
So I was a wee bit curious on how the head would look with some hair, so I've added the picture of the hair onto the screenshot of the head

And if not? Welp--
Indeed
but with blender constantly updating, I've decided to learn how to rig the lips instead
I know
2. because I've seen a good amount of models nowadays with those lip bones so why not add them in my model
1. because this mesh is currently using a subdivision surface modifier and I can't apply it when there are shapekeys. I can do it if there are bones though
LIP RIGGING TIME..._Oh god--_
Indeedy
(putting it on spoiler cuz nudity and such) I am rigging the body right now. So far it's looking pretty nice. I've even added bones for the booty--
Indeed
mostly thickening the outlines
I've just did some changes in the head, most notably in the eyes
https://tenor.com/bGGHH.gif
Le backhair's done. now the twintails
AAAAAAAA THE BACK HAIR IS FINALLY DONE IN TEMRS OF MODELING...
Making some moar pogress
Mhm--
I've been thinking of adding a solidify modifier to the bangs to add an outline to the hair, while using an outline vertex group to determine the thickness of the outline c:
I'm liking how this is turning out
SMUG
Welp, time to resume on the new OC
_That must've been her breath--_
cause le french hon hon
_Le wink--_
ngl, the rigged face makes expressions so much easier--
Speaking of swords
But it'll definitely be worth i
Working on rigging the face is a pain in the ass x__x
IT'S DA SOUND OF DA BEAT
WOOP WOOP
Welp, she's gettin' somewhere
https://tenor.com/bAhpv.gif
yes, cause I'm with the science team!
BODY TEXTURED QwQ
_Eh, too lazy to fully UV map it_
shrödingers censor
>:3c
Well... trying to get the feel of the shape--
I JUST REALIZED THAT YOU'VE MADE A REFERENCE TO MY WORLD (if I remember it correctly--)
ohhh
OH
Tho I do wonder when build strike first was revealed 🤔
Almost same leg too
Yeah they do
Ohhh
eh? Whaddaya mean by thatr?
Indeed! It's the build strike ovo/
I HAS GUNDAM AND MAKING IT
Nice indeed
Oh and she also plans to become the owner of a tea shop (???)
Not really, but she is a ninja actually, this is just her casual attire :v
New OC design ahoy!
HIBIKI NO
A reminder that she's surprisingly stable without the stand in some poses
Hmmm... I can see what you mean by that
hibiki: putting the gun in Gungnir

headfin went kapüt
And gay hamster
Did it for his accessories too
Panel lined it
Me making road
DAB TEST
We've got a shy Gundam and a gay hamster with the charm point
Stickered
That would be great if I have the budget for all of them
Hmmm...
I wonder what other Gundams I'll save up for in the future...

Anyway, I am learning how to use a dictionary file for custom enemies so I can edit their values here and there on the fly without having to do it for each and every single enemy individually
ayyy
So I'm learning a bit about dictionaries a bit more in blender c:
Facepalming Gundam
I did have to use a wee bit of code from the forcefield shader made by curly brace, but that's mostly for the intersect thing
Finally got the intersection of the forcefield to work
Time for me to learn about using vertex in my shader
His limbs got yeeted to another plane of existence
Or a shrödinger's cat situation
It uses magic that's for sure so perhapsd
I guess? 🤔
I forgot to add le arm cannon before, but here it is with the arm cannon!
"GET REKT SCRUB"
Forgot to draw the ring around her horn things
Working on Angelic Buster and I gotta say, she doesn't look bad in my artstyle 🤔
they both use the same peg size
"OKAY WHO EXPERIMENTED ON MY LEGS"
bar bae tho
That feature's added
thanks for reminding me
Oh yeah motion blur--
_Yo I herd u liek settings so I added settings in your settings so you can set your settings for your settings_
He do be walkin'
Well in any case I got it to work now, so that's one plusside
Currently there's only the values thing in the resource file, but if I ever want to implement a texture thing to the dictionary it's hopefully only a code or two away--
nah, although I did the JSON thing in my dialogue test.
What I'm actually doing is making a unique resource file for every different version of an enemy, using the dictionary in a GD script for the info and maybe even a picture if I plan to add an enemy biography list in the future for the player to see what the enemy is called and such
yeah. I'm currently trying to make enemies where I can make custom files for them where I can set in the values manually
_I made a smug_
My new profile picture
I'm making a reference sheet too- though for front and sideview thing since it'll be a model-- or at least I hope it will become a model--
Ooohhh
Ahh gotcha
Ohhh
_The side and back are also ones I need to do--_
But that's just the front view...
I think I finally got a point where I am liking the design x__x
Yeah, though I might go for 6, though I don't know for sure yet 🤔
And the answer is to show my current progress with deciding what bangs to choose
6 now
I didn't ask which bangs one would prefer but thanks for the input anyway! 👍
Dammit I made a 5th set of bangs--
<:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
Great minds think alike I've heard
<:ElfneinPresents:691733046633955439>
Yes, she's someone you can ride :v
Thanks! Le elf girl (Mercedes)'s bangs aren't finalized yet. Hell, I still don't know yet as you can see it x__x
Elf girl be looking pwetty
Fuq it, imma give her leg and tail armor
_Also, she can lift a truck--_
Ahh, gotcha!
Ohhh, is it in terms of shading?
Freedom planet? Imma look it up
Mhm, now with a bit more color
Still in the design process, but Imma give her thunder thighs
https://tenor.com/bLSFi.gif
Quite the _horny_ person
So it seems
Just don't get hit by either one of her four horns
You've described her theme to a T
When a big ball of floof becomes a pink ball of _spiky_ floof
Current progress: _She finally can hear ~~other's B.S~~ things now!_
Working on the shirt
T'is time to work on her--
_Lotsa detail I see--_
_Maybe?_
She has head
~~I get what you mean, but still--~~
_Because she hasn't?_
So turns out Mercedes has a 3d model already in a game during a collab...
_Imma use it to look for missing details I need to add for my reference_
"_nooo_"
_"Doing a performance? But I don't wanna get outta beeeed"_
v be like
https://tenor.com/bpKgc.gif
~~and she got the tit~~
Time to model her jacket finally
Tru tru
_So I tried in on one of my OCs and it's a wee big for her--_
Surprised it took that artwork to realize considering the handles in the weapon
Mhm
It's her main fighting style too
_Yes_
AND MAKE IT DOUBLE
Prepare for trouble,
Neat! As for me I'm finally going to texture and rig the crossbow
c:
And she's got a young half brother--
And at the same time a younger half sister
and the earrings are actually claws nails from her dragon form that got broken
eyup, she's got dragon blood from her dear dad
So I felt like redrawing my half dragon elf princess
She's the same girl as her
_More maplestory character designs_
eyup, she is one!
A nine tailed one too, but too lazy to draw le tails :v
And yes
She got some serious honkers
A real set of badonkers
Doodling a fox girl now--
When life gives you lemons.. 
_sing a song about your crush's booty in front of her_
I see someone knows her :v c
Probably?
https://tenor.com/bP4Ia.gif
well, she no longer horni now, huh?
and ||~~exposed bra~~|| c:
So I was doodling some more and this time I felt like drawing angelic buster/Tear with some battle damage.
Putting it in spoiler cause a wee bit of blood just in case--
And then there's the grin
Caution: she bites
So I'm doodling one of my OCs again
FINISHED QwQ
She's getting colored now!
After seeing Angelic Buster some more, I've decided to retry drawing her again--
Nu >:c

_But I grace you her smile--_
~~or if one wants seggz with her~~
_Like handholding_
_When she sees lewd stuff_
Hmmm
I'm currently liking the current one more. But I'll LOOK into other eye tomorrow. SEE if there's one that please my EYEBALLS
Nah
I'm thinking of her being a wee bit more serious
_I redid the eyes_
No one expects the PC acquisition!
So I'm drawing a milf
That too
Welp, I've changed the leg armor and such
The progress so far--
~~probably lewd a dragon boy or something~~
So I was going to doodle one of my Magical girls again, but when it came to the outfit I suddenly started to draw a magical knight girl instead xD
herpaderp
Ermagherd
It hecking WIMDY
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
at least not yet anyway, that's in their future
We're talking them being in a relationships, not being married or having children :v
One is 19, the other's 20
They're canonically a couple :v
but I am also going to be working on a new face for the male cause gdi it seems offputting now
Smug waifu
Maybe?

Well I kinda lied she's not really done as she has rigging issues bot modeling wise she is done
Shorts with star shaped cutouts on the side!
And she wears shorts!
SHE'S DUN
PROGRESS FINALLY
Okay time for school
ooohhhh
Oh?
idk, they have their heads above the clouds atm
_not yet_
Well, now that you said it...
_I brought them together_
_Oh._
Ahh, magical gi--
spiky jacket
I agree
~~She's on her way to bonk your head then--~~
smug levels?
So I was bored today--
Instead we have magical floof
if she was blonde she would've been a lot more desslier
Would be more or less a staff or a hammer or a scythe but I don't have a model for those yet
she 'bout to get serious
Now her in a pose
the rigging improved! Except on the flaps of her top--
Time to fix some rigging issues on the model
a protagonist with a cute lil sister
the smug little sister who ships her ~~with her big bro~~
Of course we have the smug too
They gonna be cute together. I just need to work on the boi's new model tho
https://tenor.com/bR53E.gif
_~~make her do the stickbug dance~~_
~~True true~~
tru tru
And I'm not the only one
I seem to love posing her
Big fists
Last picture before going to sleep but
I should really work on the face rigging at some point
Magical girl-ness level: stronk
Suddenly jojo pose

Rigging a model be like
_The gomu gomu no fruit has been consumed_
Suddenly noodly arm
Stumpy waifu
Suddenly
Old pics but moods
_Yatta!_
And here's the same one as a Nymph--
Here's a punchy pixie
The hair is sorta a blue ish flame, hence why it looks so upright yet flowy
Helmet test maybe
c:
_Where's that damn fourth_
_Tmw someone says something very stoop!d_
_The elven princess cannot believe it took me so long just to get started drawing her again_
Levels of smug: _foxy_
I made a biography page for one of my characters today and the sole reason for me to do it is honestly the accordions
_So I think I can make a page now_
https://lawain-dimensional-heroes.tumblr.com/maroon
Well, she is partly inspired by Hibiki :v
Just decided to add a white outline around it to make the thicc black lines show off better
Thanks! Had to revamp the old version due to how different the proportions were back then
_Cause that's where it counts_
And now she's really PONK
Nah, she ain't Cag
_Time to give her some thicc lines_
Ohey, MMD version--
But you already know that
...You're going to have to take it
_Y'know_
Was doodling this cause I felt  a bit...
I should draw her a lot more, she's so kyoot
Probably?
_**da gurl found da booty**_
_Swiggity Swooty_
So I was doodling and
Update:
And this time, the cheeks can glow, allowing her to blush c:
So I doodled a mugshot of another robo OC of mine
I was doodling once again and
Been working on my room again-- specifically bought a new carpet for it c:
Default ui for the message
Everything else except for the clock it's unfiltered
Working on the UI element of my game project today =v=
That and my personal man cave B)
Mhm!
Idk if this fits to post this here but I've just finished cable managing shit
Smug and...
_Wait--_
Finally doodling again
Okay, now that I'm awake and on my PC I can explain it a bit more precise.

It's a beat em up game that looks and plays mostly like a 2D beat em up, but you're in a 3D environment.
A beat em up in a pixel art art style
Should I go with le arrows? 🤔
concept as of now-- but I'm planning to make it a functioning game-- or at least a demo
nvm, updated it
Title screen be like:
I don't think I have yet--
Now it's looking like a options screen
I finally got the settings menu and the settings code itself to work! (and saving these)
OOO with our favorite super gay hamster gal
Nyet
The dialogue system is looking ni--
So I'm actually trying to make it work in my game instead of making edits

_It's easy to see I'm enjoying this--_
_This suddenly went outta hand_
Tmw you use blender to try and make pixel-art like art
_Finally, camera system works--_
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/488370207409045525/1016026962889822279/2022-09-04_18-46-08.mp4
Blender 2.90.1
_And as for me a slight change in angles to a cute angel_
_Ah, a familiar face_
Glowing eyes go BRRRRR
As someone who uses Godot, I can agree with that sentence
_Correction: make that 3_
I know way two white haired people to agree with you on that one--
mw someone gives you _this_ look part 2
tmw someone gives you _this_ look
Who likes a speedy boi
Mhm! And for dynamic shots like the ones arc system's 3D games have!
Mostly just showing how it helps the dynamics of a character and how it helps with giving attention to the thing you want to give attention to!
Nothing really special, just something I wanna share this fun comparison between how a model looks like with and without bones that scale
Now I got the next looking right now
After many graceful landings
_What a graceful landing_
I present to you!...
_A blep_
_Swolltsune Miku when she sees brittish people_
Hatsune...
SWOLL MIKU
Finally...
Sad magical girl :c
As you can see on this one here
That's just a mesh I wanted to add so I can make this part seem like it's glowing to the point where the light is bleeding out of it
Oh, the ones That should be here you mean?
Any suggestions to add to le staff?
As one of royalty should :v
_Well now this looks better_
Longarm
I just noticed the length of that arm...
_Now I can't unsee it and it's annoying the hell out of me now--_
(Don't mind the weird thing on the sides, it was originally an effect piece that I'm now UV mapping it on the weapon itself)
Does this look better?
That's temporary-- but I'm not sure what kind of reflection will look like 🤔
Fuck it imma go for this staff--
Making staff for magical girls can be pain x_x
_Especially if one can change too_
Time to draw an idiot
_hmmmmm, snoopingas usual I see_
Yeah I'm aware it's a good choice
_Doesn't watch any VTubers_
oh
https://tenor.com/SKKd.gif
_yes_
_Ohey a king_
And when it's time to D-D-D-D-DUEL
_Doodling another magical girl time_
Someone: go outside and touch some grass
Me: okay
Also me:
_Cuteness overload_
_Oooooooh gotcha_
I mean, she's designed to be a magical dragon girl idol, so what's not to love?
<@134296520273952768> <@331908049822547978> <@457268466429329429> Seems like y'all like a dragon girl idol :v
_Indeed_
there we go :^)
<@457268466429329429>
...
Gimme a second--
_she's there_
_Took me many tries to get her proportions right but finally_

_I found some sprites and there was only one thing my mind wanted to do_
_So I tried to make her look menacing_
upside on windy days? At least there's no heat issue
downside: _bad hair day_

_Instructions unclear, chief_
_nu_
Help I turned a cute GF to a smol one
Although what you said could also be a good edition to it since I did somewhat think that light source on the side can be used as a kind of like a sort of hologram projector thing to make those wings appear, so who knows
And it's also a tiny bit more blue tinted
That's exactly what I was trying to do--
And this is now--
I've made a small difference in the gray color of her dress and socks.
This is before
Working on a familiar floofball of mine again :3
So this is like my 2nd-- or rather 3rd time drawing a chibi character this year...
_Looks good tbh_

More of a crappy edit but whatevs
Cube.729.000
:^)

yeah that's true
I mean... Maplestory did get exactly that, but only for a year
_Maplestory_
c:
nope but it is an online game
_So time to model a thingy. Guess what game that came from--_

~~_Smack someone whoever is Horni_~~
Suddenly filter effect
So I found this small portable FM radio...
_I know what Imma be listening to tomorrow_ =v=
Ooh, a 3D Vase!
Hmmm...
This also looks nice
I can somewhat understand but I am so, so used to customizing pages in that fashion that the Niagara Launcher is kind of a turn off for me sorry m8
I've installed that launcher and... Idk chief, I'm not all too interested in it's layout
the niagara launcher that is, that's if that's a suggestion to using one
Oh right-- launchers! Imma try one out--
Decided to overhaul my phone's appearance with a new theme, wallpaper and font--
I look forward to learning cause it seems easy to learn yes-- might even consider Davinci over Hitfilm honestly
So I'm learning Davinci Resolve
~~Do you have zoom installed?~~
So I got a cassette recorder for Christmas!
here he comes the swivel,
the swivel man,
he's swivel man~
Indeed...
As well as the...SWIVEL on the head--
Tho what should I do with her once she's done.. <:HibikiThink:688429715362414641>
https://tenor.com/bp3nD.gif
_~~Yes the horni has taken control over my thoughts and Imma rig her for sure--~~_
Will do it for the elf regardless
https://tenor.com/bI0aW.gif
https://tenor.com/t0LI.gif
_thanks..._
Mostly just a cube or something along with subsurface division and mirror and that's it
when it comes to concept/reference art/texturing: Medibang
Straight up Blender
I'm almost done with  the model fitting and stuff for her...
_Soon it's rigging time_
Well, she's missing her ears, but still!
Ladies and gents
Elf girl
ah cool! That looks grea--
**[BRICKED]**
So I found this old camera in the closet today
_Hue_
Just finished a handjob...
_:^)_
_It feels a tiny bit outta sync from the music somehow but y'know what that's great tho_
or play the song at .75x speed and it'll match perfectly--
now speed it up 1.25x and play that in the background
And they even took the windows transparency
So I found out one of the lenses I have is a very vintage and well known lens: HELIOS 44-2 <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
When I get a DSLR or a mirrorless camera i swear to God I'm using these lenses
Mhm. it would definitely look good in like those 3rd person beat em up games like genshin/honkai, but I'm more thinking of like a TMNT fighting game like game
True true-- I'll see what I can do with that
thanks! Hopefully I can get to a point where I can actually use her in a game--
Thanks! Technically it's still not done yet cause it's missing, teeth, tongue and ears and the facial rigging could do with some improvements here and there
Indeed--
I was originally thinking like potentially going straight up 2D sprite, but I'm not good of a sprite artist tbh--
Basically started off with a bit of scale editing on this model ~~Which I might use for placeholder still--~~

But other than that? idk
Nice!
I've been trying to figure out how to best make her 3d model look pixelated like a pixel art style--
_One thing's for sure I need to either redo the model from scratch or just forego the 3d model or pixel artstyle_
Oh I like the slime mesh a lot!
Nice!
I saw that on twitter too!
Nice!
Thanks! I'm glad you like it ^^
I know the pain YwY
Thanks vwv/
https://www.pixiv.net/member_illust.php?mode=medium&illust_id=68418352

The moment I saw the custodian with the blue hair, my mind was immediately thinking of the one from gurren lagan
Or death and rebirth?
And if Sham-Ha Miku is like HoV, we'll likely get a battle of the century

miku trying to resist from within

I feel this is Mei vs HoV all over again. <:KirikaSpook:605209108827734017>
Even a prequal to the game HI3 <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Atleast, if a god could be killed
but what if god's gone?
technically it's the cocoon, but I guess you could say that
And villains assemble hasn't been marked?

Bold of you to say she's being measured
And the fact that gridman and the other collab is basically canonically in the same universe <:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>

Hears about the potential war that could happen thanks to trump.
_Me to the people who wants to take back USA from trump_
Not yet here in Holland
They do highly advice it outside tho and make it a necessity to do it on public transport, but outside it's not necessary.
I fucking know right?
Dutch Government: Why do people want to take off masks all of a sudden?
Also Dutch government: _is discussing if people must put on masks....AT THEIR HOMES._ (but not make it a necessity outside yet)

Seriously, my country right now is doing a piss poor job at combatting the virus..
that's when you know it's not a good idea to go at war
I see... Thanks for making me feel more relieved about this. I still feel very terrible for the the citizens of Ukraine that they have to deal with this.
The Ukraine thing to me as a European (Netherlands specifically) genuinely concerns about if Putin's army stops at just Ukraine or not. I only hear/read tiny bits about it so far.
