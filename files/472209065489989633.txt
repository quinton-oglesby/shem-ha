I am EATING today
The 1st episode was sorta good though, but it quickly fell off from there imo
It's a standard quasi-harem where the cardboard girls tell the MC how good he is every episode. And the MC himself looks bland and uninteresting probably so the audience can relate to him
Bokutachi was sooo mediocre

Me when I literally go back in time and say "this is so cool" and not think about it too hard ever since
But almost any girl looks cute with short hair so <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
