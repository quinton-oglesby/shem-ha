Hello to everyone around here then, hopefully you are all doing great today!
After just finishing the masterpiece that Symphogear has honestly become personally, I decided to join this server that I had found out about after the Valkyries one, which I had joined when I was only at the beginning of the series. 
I can definitely say that it has impacted me very much and that it quickly became one of my all-time favourites, as it probably felt like for many of the people here as well. 
Although I am not sure how frequently I will decide to speak here due to being way less active on the platform and coming back nowadays, sincerely thank you very much for welcoming me here! The atmosphere of the server feels extremely great already, and hopefully that's enough of an introduction to start with, for the moment at least. 
Now that it has been said, a wonderful week to every person in the server, take care of yourselves and never forget to believe in the songs within your hearts of course! See you later!
