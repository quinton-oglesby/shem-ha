I didn't take it as an insult, I just wanted to askðŸ˜…
Ik but maybe a logo or smt else would be better
It's unfair for other people who ship other pairs
Can we change the group icon to smt other than a ship?
It took 4 hours and it's finally done

Cute<:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>

<:MikuBliss:336657233712513024>
I m good with elza and vanessa but I hate millarc<:TsubasaDisgust:349013662775902209>
We might have that problem with Tsubasa
The shipment is expensive for me too so I usually buy few things at the same time and wait more<:TsubasaDisgust:349013662775902209>
I know how you feel<:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
References are everywhere in this season
<:TsubasaYareYare:407397617451139073>
Oh noo
I love this henshin<:TsubasaSmug:585839805737467920>
Nyaa takes a little time
Even if they didnt they will in few mins
Horrible subs already released it i guess
Im in love once again
Thats why she is fine
Shes fine
Yea<:TsubasaYareYare:407397617451139073>
But i want more suffering
Ik
Im gonna bet millaarc stabbed elf9
Cant get it out
That song stuck on my mind
Me too
Finally they did smt right for this anime
I hope they spelled her name right
That makes sense
Same<:TsubasaSmug:585839805737467920>
Millaarc would be dead<:TsubasaSmug:585839805737467920>
My bad<:MariaSunglasses:336656798687690752>
I need more boob missiles
Tsubasa must get her revenge<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
I hope so <:TsubasaDisgust:349013662775902209>
Nana wills it
Dont hate me for it but I laughed so hard when miku screamed like that
Probably
And its sad
Yea i know<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
+ I dont want her to be broken
Yea you're right
She might kill a civilian in the future episodes
I think they've gone pretty far already
I think last song will include every gear user
Wow<:CarolShock:430939013235474432>
I wanna know its secret
Btw is anybody interested in airgetlam now
Yea that was pretty ridiculous
I want miku to remain a gear user in the game tbh
OhðŸ˜…
Ssj?
I really hope it wont happen<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
Btw Im gald that Miku isnt the main arc in this season
Fudou needs miku
It will end pretty fast and lame i think
I dont want a bikki one tbh
I really want him dead<:TsubasaDisgust:349013662775902209>
It still wouldnt be fair tho
Ikr
Most likely maria
Lol
<:MikuGay:336656810788388864>
Hibiku and mibiki<:TsubasaSmug:585839805737467920>
I would love that
Or a prequel about tsubasa and kanade
Credit scene about its new movie<:TsubasaSmug:585839805737467920>
Kakegurui had a lot if fingernail parts
Another group song maybe
There might be more
Yup
It would be lame
And I really dont want hibiki in that fight
Its between maria and basa
I hope not tho
Yea
Mark my words it will happen
Im waiting for maria vs basa
<:TsubasaSmug:585839805737467920>
I think basa just made up with maria
<:MariaSunglasses:336656798687690752>
Of course
But it shouldnt be on base
@<@247701824335904770>  ikr?
Im still waiting for a basa vs maria
Yea
That smile will be ruined
Btw I'm still shocked to see happy basa
Me too
What are the other geahs are for?
<@506219877724454929> i hate it when hibiki solos
I hope not
Same
Rare basa
I agree
I want her dead
That batgirl has to die as well
Nope
Its symphoverse
<:GenjuurouThumbsUp:336657189475188740>
My imagination just leveled up
<:MikuGay:336656810788388864>
It would be cute and funny
I can see that happening
<:MariaSunglasses:336656798687690752>
They make me put her on top
I think the same but some maria moments...
I still cant decide who to put on top when it comes to tsubamari<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
UwU
<:MariaSunglasses:336656798687690752>

Way too nice
That smile will be ruined
I wanna know why chris said that her time wont last long (ep 2)

She has to die
I ship sg and hibiki from now on
I dont care about miku anymore tbh
Lol
<:TsubasaSmug:585839805737467920>
Manga was better tho
I knew her from rosario vampire
I learned that Mizuki Nana was here
sword of culture
I started watching it for its  tragedy
<:TsubasaSmug:585839805737467920>
Lol
Yea
It will happen
We'll get a zesshou in the end<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
No swords dying in this show
Drawing was off
Dont get me wrong but I couldnt enjoy this ep
I would love to see that coming as an arc
I hope they'll lose their divine status
But some of the drawings from this ep will kill me
Dont think so
It made me sad again<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
I thought I would love to see Tsubasa with that smile but nope
Lol
Whole season is moving way too fast
Ikr?
That transformation makes my day better
I think the same
It was cute but felt different
I couldnt like that face because of the drawing<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
Maria where u at
Lol
I ll keep waiting for basa arc
<:TsubasaSmug:585839805737467920>
Happy bike day btw

We'll just have to wait and see<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>

Never
I love those too <:MikuGay:336656810788388864>
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025> 
Maybe they'll be together in another anime
it would feel like avengers endgame
(I hope it wont end like that<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025> )
But XV might end with geahs giving up on their geahs so movie might not happen
-movie
-kanade/tsubasa prequel
-spin-off
-OVA
-XDU event episodes
(I'll be waiting for these)
I wouldnt have any problem with that
That would be amazing
4 eps isnt enough to cover everything
They might close XV plot holes with xdu events
Yup
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
XV main event when
He got some respect with xdu event i think
I  agree joppy
BASA
It was
She reached out her hand to basa
Lol
I wouldnt say no to this but it feels weird after watching ep 9
Well I want basa to be happy
Except gen and yatsuhiro
This is wrong
Check out @kokonag222â€™s Tweet: https://twitter.com/kokonag222/status/1168185135037943808?s=09
YT beats CR
Basa had a rough time ever since she was born<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
That would break my heart again
<:CarolShock:430939013235474432>
When I watched ep 9 I kept thinking about it
Same
I knew
Murakumo to heavencloud
Ame no habakiri to heavenrend
I heard nana's voice in some scenes too  <:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
We'll get something waaaaay to different from the preview I think
As torrent
Its up
You know shem-ha can take miku with her so I wouldnt wish for that
Wait till last ep to find out
It would feel off for me
I dont think hibiki has to respond like that
Did that song played in anime yet
Really
Well she's dense
I already did that
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
NOOOOOOO
same -_-
I was expecting a group attack tbh
<:TsubasaDisgust:349013662775902209>
another solo attack
<@480107127042736139>
maybe I'm thinking too much into this
in the ad bikki said matta itsuka... which is translated to someday...
I'm expecting smt other than just Live concert, anybody feeling same (thanks to ad that was shown at the end)
I think Kanade counts as a character
ok I'm dead
not really
<:CarolShock:430939013235474432>
I hope miku wont be a gear user if there'll be a movie
rany's spirit died
nope
I wish they remade the last ep
dont forget pain
