If so then I'll whale on this HARD

Big uff. Good luck with that

Just share art. Who cares if its reruns
Anywhere i could watch it? I look it up and all i find is some random crap



> <@!213530532766679041> Sorry for the tag but the Maria artwork you shared last night seems to have been deleted from PIXIV?
<@!262326868366065664> i guess it did.

I am curious but is there any more of these chibi expression memes and stuff thats symphogear? I want a folder of them
would these ovas have english subs?
is nyaa safe? last time i used a program for that was similar i ended up with a bunch of viruses and couldnt remove it
nyaa?
but i am just wondering if anyone has any to share as well
where can i watch the OVA's?

Literally everyone when the whole quarantine is finished
nm i found a website to watch them. Goddamn yeah i can see the meme potentials now
> <@!213530532766679041> If you don't feel like downloading all of them, there's a fairly safe site I can DM you where you can watch the OVAs (minus XV's)
<@!209536346413465600> could you please if you dont mind
for some reason its not wanting to play the videos...rip
So apparently pre orders are up for Shirabe Tsukuyomi figures
@kerrick52 and @bolue/degurechaf where did you found those at?
Where could i read these djs? They seem nice and a bit wholesome

Yes thank you
Does anyone have the gif thats being used as the account profile with maria blushing? Can someone upload that here please?
I feel it was more fated that i would eventually watch symphogear and become a fan of the franchise

What's more funnier. I found this in 2015 and in my god honest opinion I was like, "huh cute and cool looking oc's"

Browsing through my old photos on my phone and found this was saved in 2014...
