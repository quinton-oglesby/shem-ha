Do you have the og image I need it for research
What comic was this from????
That could work but idk how to run a zine and as Meula said I don’t think the staff has the time to run and organize one
I mean we have a ton of great artists here and I don’t think it’s been done before so I think it could be fun
This is a shot in the dark but what if this server hosted a symphogear 10th anniversary zine?

Sorry I didn’t mean to derail the convo
It’s worse when your black and trans though cause it feels like no matter how hard you try everyone seems to want to dead or just out of the picture for just existing and no one seems to care
Everything seems to be getting worse and worse by the day
I know it just really sucks right now
Hell at least last time you could just immigrate somewhere if shit really started getting bad but now we’re stuck here
Sorry I’m just scared of having hope this time only to have it come crashing down again
True true
I feel like we’re doing that now by thinking that Biden is going to save us from him
I’m just trying to be realistic after what happened four years ago. I want a blue wave and for everything to start getting better but I don’t want to get my hopes up again
And it’s fine dude
A lot of his supporters are those big companies though and people in congress and if dems don’t become the majority there could be another Obama situation where all of his “radical” bills he wanted to pass didn’t cause they kept blocking them
True
Ik why people did, they felt ignored by liberals and trump put himself out as the guy who would take down the elites (even though he is on) and have their voices be heard. Plus the fact that Hilary never visited Midwest states helped him a lot
Either way the plans he kept coming up with were garbage and are we really going to trust the billionaire to give us free healthcare
Huh must of missed that
He just said he would get rid of Obama care and replace it with his own thing and everyone hated it
We both know they’re not gonna do that
So basically we’re fucked
God fucking damnit
> Do you think people would riot if Trump wins this year's election?
We’ll cross that bridge when we get there
That’s how they got the frat boy in
No but they can block him from doing it
Oh I didn’t know shit...
You know divorce is always an option
There’s been so much going on I don’t know what’s real and what’s a joke
Oh shit it’s fake
It doesn’t matter if they were white or not someone just got away with murder
Yeah no kidding
This is such a cut and dry case how the hell did this happen
I hate it here
Only five??
Oh that’s good!
I’m not trying to defend it I’m just saying there’s a reason for it
Yeah....when a lot of people of a certain gender have been shitty to you it’s easy to assume everyone of that gender is shitty
They would probably start shouting if they did that
I know but how do I tell him without hurting his feelings
He always talks about how he wants to die and it’s triggering to me
> but is it a situation where you are always uncomfortable with it?
Pretty much
Plus his parents won’t let him get any help
I’ve already asked him to get some and call the hotline but he said that he wasn’t comfortable with it
I want to tell this guy I’m friends with that I’m not comfortable with him talking about ||self harm and suicide|| whenever he vents to me and I don’t know how to say it or do it cause I feel like I’m going to hurt him
How do you confront people?
“No *spritz* bad nominee wait your turn”
Perfect!
Spray them whenever the candidate goes over the limit
No I’m with you I don’t want a repeat of the last election
That summarizes this whole election
I’m going to swim to Canada I swear to god
Eh true
Okay but if he elects a hard conservative judge it’ll be easier to overturn it
I know Biden won’t do that
I’m talking about pence
Well not everything but he’ll sure as hell undo gay marriage if he gets power, plus if the Supreme Court nominee gets approved he’ll have an easier time doing it
There’s no guarantee that he won’t undo everything while he’s in power
Is it bad that I hope he gets the virus to
How do you know if people genuinely like you or their just tolerating you cause they don’t know how to tell you to fuck off
Honestly this is getting out of hand I don’t even want to think about what’s going to happen if Biden gets elected
Biden supporters don’t try to kidnap mayors and send bombs to left wing officials and news stations
Yup
Can trump supporters just chill for a fucking second
Start a civil war for some reason
Jesus fucking christ
Who the fuck thought it was a good idea to kidnap the governor of Michigan and try and start a civil war
Do any of you realize that this mentality is why trump is in office
It’s not I acknowledge that
Oh
Who knows
This isn’t the time to be self righteous
Neither are democrats
Lank
A party historically known for losing elections
Please explain to me your logic
Okay lank please explain to me how letting this guy win is going to help the US
^^^
I’m so glad some of y’all don’t live in the us
I get it I don’t like the guy either but I want to feel safe here again
Do any of you guys realize that if we don’t vote for Biden everything is fucked?
I thought she wasn’t
No their just really moderate about them
Well last time people protest voted cause a candidate sucked we got stuck with this mess so is this really the time to debate who’s worse
Those are the only reasons he has tho and not wanting more of this shit is a good reason
> I thought he wasn't able to be a candidate due to him trying to join too late?
<@481518367845646346>  no he qualified
I know and I hate it
If anyone here votes Kanye I’m going to riot
Exactly it just steers votes away from someone who has a chance of getting elected
Mac I swear to god
Why hold ourselves accountable when you can blame other people for doing a bad job
*then why are you suggesting going third party*
I just wanna enjoy my night without getting reminded of all the bad shit is that too much to ask
Haha flashbacks go burrrr
Please take your meds
That’s kinda scary
You I’m starting to get why people hate the word simp now...
It’s literally never going to happen until we fix how we deal with how we vote for candidates
Biden is winning thank god but a lot of states are turning red and I’m getting concerned
Guess who’s genuinely terrified about the election outcome :3
And voter id laws
It would be easy but voter suppression exists
Rock Paper Scissors would be more democratic than this
Right so let’s just focus on the two guys who will either destroy America or try to transform it back into a really not good but better than we are now state
I just want this to be over and it’s so close so that’s what’s making this so frustrating
I know and it’s so stressful waiting for all of them to be counted
But in Nevada could just hurry the fuck up that would be great
I get that poll workers have a hard job and it takes a while to count all the in person + mail in votes
I’m pretty sure it’ll get struck down by the state courts tho
They’re okay
its where we put all the racists
huh
Can’t he get arrested for that if he confesses to it? Or are Jp statute of limitations different??
Oh yeah
IF YOU’RE GOING TO BE EVIL AT LEAST BE SMART ABOUT IT
ARE YOU DUMB???
THATS WHAT I WAS THINKING WHAT PROMPTED YOU TO TELL AN INTERVIEWER ABOUT THIS????
YEAH
I don’t even know what to say this is just fucking cartoon villain evil and he’s going to get away with it cause they don’t fucking care
For some reason
He talked about it in a past interview
Yeah uh
Sure it wasn’t directly to them and he probably googled it but it’s the thought that counts :))))))))))))))) /s
But hey he apologized about it so that makes it okay /s
Just a thought
Plus the Olympics are a big deal so maybe fire the guy who ||made a disabled kid eat his own shit and jerk off in public|| to save face..
Yeah but I kinda expected torture to be where they drew the line…
Yeah
So uh

The person behind the symphoscreencap and shem ha bot
I ment on Twitter
Okay I just got kinda worried when I noticed their accounts were gone ^^”
Is Gwen okay they kinda left everything
Yeah I can’t find anything on it
Cool now they’re even more cut off from the world
I think we’re all still processing it rn
yeah
I’m sorry I kept chickening out of talking to you again
I hope wherever they are they’re at peace and knew that there were people who still loved them in the end
I didn’t really get to know them that well. I met them on here and later on twitter and were mutuals for a bit. They was really nice and the few times I got to talk to them and I enjoyed every conversation we had. I just wish I got to reconnect and talk to them more. They really brought a lot of great things to the fandom and it feels so weird not to have them here anymore.
Ooo you wanna buy a skirt so bad
^^^^^^^
I’m about to break down crying I’m so glad she’s okay
Why was I tagged here-
So I know I was the main one that was like “hey we can’t just not vote or else we’ll let the other side win and things will get worse” two years ago with a Biden. but things are already getting worse and the dems kinda just hope that they can ride on that anti right wing/trumpism wave forever and keep getting re elected without having to do anything and it’s kinda depressing that I don’t want to vote but the other side is genuinely worse so the situation has just become “do you want to drink the fast acting poison or the slow one with the blm sticker” and I’m tempted to just say neither and let the world fall apart. Anyway here’s an unrelated picture of Konota cause lucky star is the only other thing bringing me joy right now in these trying times
Like please..just grow a pair…bully republicans it’s so easy
I just wish dems and liberals would start acting like the “scary socialists” the right keeps telling people about cause its not like they don’t have the power they just don’t want to use it
It’s just a really shitty damned if you do and still damned but you get a little rainbow flag and some thoughts and prayers on your way down
Listen I am fully always that conservatives are way fucking worse for the country as a whole I’m just pissed at liberals for not doing anything after they promised they would start doing *something*
I’m still gonna vote I’m just mad
Any other alternatives
Do we even have any alternatives?
I wonder if that effects any of her decisions /s
Also she’s worth 29.3 million dollars
Me when the woman worth 29.3 million dollars keeps asking for money
Trump got raided by the fbi
Watching Fox News for the first time in years (I’m not conservative my mom was so it played a lot) just to see the anchors reactions to the Mar a lago raid is like peaking into a bizzaro universe
We’re gonna have a problem here
Will the real Elon Musk please stand up

Ah yes
Fuck rent get Alita
> Does it have yuri?
<@!676272618839605249>  it’s a magical girl manga of course there’s yuri
The manga is called “don’t call me magical girl I’m ooxx”
Does anyone know any way to read this I’ve been trying to find it for a while now
Is Assult lily good or?
You’ve hit a climax
It’s just ready to burst

It’s not gay if the balls don’t touch
They can? <:KirikaDisgust:688431636043268097>
I don’t know ask the straight people
No I’m saying that cause whenever there’s lesbians in public they’re either sisters or cousins for some reason
They must be cousins
Just a Sappho and her friend
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Valkyrie drive is the show I would watch with friends drunk
Can I get a yuri that’s not a borderline hentai
No
**And then not even say them and have the screen cut to black**
You know it’s true
They could makeout and the show will still say they’re the best of friends
Yes I also give my friend a ring on one leg and would risk everything to save them
It’s more queerbaiting tbh...
> Honestly given how College takes up so much time...
<@!149704282793443328>  so does high school but that’s most of anime
