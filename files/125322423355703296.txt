If i could just play the grand order game <:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
Mash <3
We all know short hair like between the shoulders length and just past under the ears length are the superior choice! Dont ruin my bikki with long hair <:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
JUST saying but the only reason they need symhpogear through out the seasons is because of noise, otherwise gen could have wooped all the enemies lol
wait what betrayal?
i dont remember which episode it was but early today when i saw it that ogawa and his bs and car jutsu had me laughing for quite some time
its nice
partly why i have this idea
anyone heard and read the lyrics for hibikis second character song this season we havent heard in anime yet?
well either that or only miku
btw who else have a bad feeling of the ending will be with miku and hibiki dying together?
that way the noble red was just slaughtered out of the series wow, just finished the episode after using the last 5 days on binging the whole series haha
this is the last season with an end and all right?
if we count all of them
5 best season tho
i honestly thought her arm would be gone for at least one episode or something
with bikki arm
yeah im glad i didnt have to experiance that cliffhanger
btw can we all agree this is teh best emote <:Ver:336656981144109066>
im at a loss for what to do until the next episode is out, it was so easy to just go to next episode all up to episode 9, guess i'll watch the series again before next saturday lol
those sounds he made
had me laughing a lot
gotta love ver screaming and whining when people come after him
HERO DAAAAAAAA
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
DR. VEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEER
currently just playing kimi dake ni (second hibiki song this season) on repeat
i have a feeling im gonna end up crying in one of the future episodes
started on season 5 yesterday and finished up today
so i ended using my whole week and getting 2 hours sleep each night before work just so i could get one season down a day
and decided to give it a shot but found out there was 4 seasons before that
i didnt think of the series honestly, i saw hibiki tranformation from the new season in summer anime in a nutshell
currently just listening to the music haha
i love how all the op/ed and character songs are on the wikia and not on youtube
everything would still be on jap tho right?
rip
nothing popped up
btw how do you even get the game, was searching on google store
the fun ones right?
wait the mini series?
only thought it was some of em
that all endings are sung by chris and op by tsubasa
just now realized through the wikia
OH WOW
seriously op and ed of season 5 is just amazing
ah
season 3?
where is the story at 3.5
i know there is an event where miku meet edgybiki
so is the game story cannon?
even japs love azur lane more
kancolle is so puny now compared to azur lane
and get a hibiki ship
and hope for a collab with symphogear
guess i'll stick to azur lane
wish the game was in english
was confirmed in g
lol
ogawa is jesus
well basically just meant who is peoples fav girl üòõ
<:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
i cant withstand hibiki, she is everything!
so who is peoples fav waifu?
heh
what a plot twist
lol
ah
btw how come this is not a emote https://media1.tenor.com/images/4eff4ce3d203a870273f96cb081a4f82/tenor.gif?itemid=14443927
died like some other meat shield side characters
they look pretty ded to me
do tell
so if i like symphogear THIS much i would probably also like madoka series
saw people compare this and that show in the comments of the episodes
gotta get that anime watched at some point
ye those two
hmmm i think i understand my friend who is massively shipping madoka and name i dont remember in a yuri ship (havent seen the anime myself) , after watching this series i cant stop shipping miku and hibiki even tho im not normally a yuri shipper haha. is this the power of symphogear?! <:Ver:336656981144109066>
but it hurts T_T
its so good!
why am i torturing myself listening to kimi dake ni on repeat
rip
oh
got something to do until next episode as well
think im gonna read the manga, sounds like there is a lot of different scenes
woah what
with hibiki getting all powers
honestly they did in a way against adam
so why not all 6
they did a 2 way some times
im surprised we havent seen a 6 way symphogear combination yet like all power ranger like lol
the god just granted their wish to be normal girls again, in their next life, but that part is written in small letters
Idk i love ver
Its fine <:Ver:336656981144109066> will save them
Prob
All symp girls and co be like "wonder where those other guys went"
I like the idea that nobody is even gonna notice they died, nobody was there and the masion is prob rip before people can search it
Well she is not completely cut in half lol
From her arm to their bodies look
Lol hslf the laser disappears before she swings it
From The Boys
Its like watching homelander killing people again with his laser eyes
Oof
Gotta train like <a:HibikiOraOra:582365734097780746>
The hero we didnt deserve but got
Ver best hero
Nr warcraft abomination lmao
Was funny as hell

Is it just me or are catholics in anime always douchbags <:HibikiWhat:336656482907193344>
Literally catholism is the reason for carol being evil lol
<:GarieWink:336657101273169921>
Then i did see the post credit
Oh right the moon activated shit
The last scene is the beam shooting up from the ground right?
Post credit?
Cryo freeze me until oktober when the last 4 episodes are out lol
The suffering <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
Day 1 without being able to binge symphogear episodes since ibwatched it all the pastb5 days . . . I think im going insane because of thebwait for next episode
Lol
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
"What are those weird beings, they touched those guys . . . . OH SHEIT"
The vr symphogear would be coming to one of tsubasa concerts
<:HibiMiku:432007202136391690>
Yeeeeeaaaaaah <:MikuGay:336656810788388864>

Hibimiku kiss would be to risky, us veiwers wouldnt be able to take all that adoarble sweetness <:MikuBliss:336657233712513024>

But the dad dad is ded
As tsuba dad is biologically the grandfarther
Technically tsuba dad is still alive
Tbh it was weird watching s1 symphogear, because the place i know hibikis va from is youyo senkinwith psycho loli, so it was weird hering her voice in such a caring person lol
1 day left <a:PartyBlibbleWibble:613783618644607007>
Why are people talking about hibiki in wedding dress, what did i miss <:MikuBliss:336657233712513024>

<@189146272865845248> true but that was in that special mode glowing n shit, do they not need to breathe in normal mode as well?
on the moon
hmmm what stops shem-ha from blowing a hole in the wall and suffocate the gear users lol
VER
what an awesome episode
OH BABY
<@189146272865845248> haha i guess
<@189146272865845248> true but they only went into that with miracles as they are saying each time, by using the music power stuff they get from people, and there are no people to gain that from on the moon, unless noble red joins them
<@115744398997716995> technically doll x doll
<:OwariWOKE:588629686578315264>
NO, LOVE IS A MYTH
Yuri ships be normal in symphogear <:MikuGay:336656810788388864>

We can only hope for hibimiku in whatever epilouge we'll get in epi 13 üôè
To be honest that pre episode pic with bikki and measument thingy, in the back of my mind i was hoping it was for measuring for her wedding dress with miku lmao

Ty ty

5:18am i should rly sleep lol
So hyped for bikki sacrifice, i believe my dreams!
<:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
This is a fortelling, my dreams literally spoiled the show for me, calling it now
Ikr
Is this foretelling <:HibikiWhat:336656482907193344>
And then dies for dramatic scene and drama, where noble red gives up their new power and life to revive her
I just had a dream this night about the way bikki saving miku, using some precurser stuff, to put on the back of shem-ha the red thingy on her back then removing her from miku, but to get that close bikki gets in distance to literally hug her and shem-ha impales bikki with those light beams while bikki just laughs saying im taking back my best friend.
Oh no
WHY
Why is there such a difference in asian and europa?!
This is the difference of asians and danish people
Ready for a funny picture of tall small people?
Dont mind sharing for the fun
No its a personal pic
Its really funny
Anyone wanna see what a 2m tall person looks like beside an asian girl?
Come to the north lots of tall people like me
Lmao im 200cm
Btw i laughed so hard in season 4 when they picked up bikki at school in a chopper and kiriko screaming des des des while the subs said (kiriko being kiriko)
<:HibikiEager:407398049531559937>

Mybdreams foretold this!
Bikki will sacrifice herself to get shem-ha out of miku and noble red will give theirnpowers from shem-ha and their life force to revive bikki
They dont lie
My dreams told mr tonight!
Will make for some great drama
Im just looking forward to bikki sacrificing herself to get miku back
Yes
Bikki and miku got a family running
10 years later
<:HibikiOhNo:586337444597596202>

Can we all agree on how cool this moment was
HonorableMaleKillifish-max-1mb.gif (320√ó180)
Gif work
Dammit
Thats our mc hibiki for ya
Lol that suits her to well
Interresting
Huh, so thats what hibikis name mean
What does hibiki mean, the word itself have been in a few songs in the series so far
And then one whole epilougisode with hibimiku centered around their marriage plz
<:OwariWOKE:588629686578315264>
They end up doing ignite and amalgam at the same time
What if
Every a and b side is kimi dake ni
Ah
What is b-side <:HibikiWhat:336656482907193344>
So the sooner means early boss fight and more epilouge for hibimiku material <:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
We'll get it when she gets miku back from shem-ha
We always get hibiki second song
We gon get it for sure
<:HibiMiku:432007202136391690>
Poor bikki tho, will have to smack her waifu around a bit in the upcoming episodes
Ikr
Its hard witing for the next ep . . .
https://youtu.be/hE-7z2VNwv4
Oh no
<:HibikiOhNo:586337444597596202>

I think i'd be cool to have some biki sacrificing herself to get waifu back scene
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
My dreams already foretold bikki will use some precurser thingy to get shem-ha out of miku but to get close enough to stick it on her baxk where that red part is so she literally hugs her and gets pierced by the weird light rays, bikki dies with lots of drama and miku crying, and then noble red gives their new energy and life force to revive her to get redemption, actually happened in a dream 2 nights ago lol
Sueing reason will be "you hurt my feelings"
I'll sue them if they dont let hibimiku happen at the end . . .
Hmmm
Havent really seen why people should be scared
How did you scare people away lol?
Lol
<a:HibikiOraOra:582365734097780746>

Hibiki and her stando, THE BIG GAY!
hopefully we will get a bikki that realises the love she has for miku is not just the friendly one, as she fights her trying to get her back on the moon
we're going on a trip to japan
one more time before it all ends
if we do end up not getting hibimiku confirmed in the show then i at least will demand that they give us this
btw
haha probably
now this would be interresting lol
true
BiKkI dIeS iN sHeM-hA fIgHt?!
plus knowing bikki and her go on mood, later when she haad getten used to the fact of a false arm i could see her grin it off when she is trying to do something with the arm and not having getten the hang of it yet and messing stuff up heh
why didnt they do this T_T
oh god this is amazing
time to search around
OH

lol just realized after looking up bikkis and genjuros training song up, its on chinese haha
just remembered one of the short series where miku is standing behind genjoru while the song miku sings in g is playing, remembering back to bikki telling her the lyrics are from the heart and she just starts screaming of embarresment lmao
When is pics out?
Birthday suits
i love drama when bikki is in it
3 hours of boredom
Sitting in a train traveling across my country ugh
And then last fight begins
Getting her back and banishing shem ha out of her body
Then bikki revives and reach out to miku who is now fully controlled and somehow reaches her
Ye
Not unless shem ha kills bikki and shows it to miku
Miku never gon give up
Who dosnt want to be gay with bikki
Obviously
She want to be gay with bikki
But the shem ha one wasnt there
Yeah i clicked the link and saw the different pics
Whats with the shem ha pic in strings, i dont see it under the preveiw pics
And its gonna hurt our economy badly if brexit succeds
Btw how is brexit going, its literally a mess in our news
Ah
Oh we got it from merica
What country?
Cool
Ooohhhh
Thx i guess V:
Oh
Oh we got a zoo animal from you???
Dippy?
Old danish swedish love for each other lmao
Why, you swedish?
This is why i love denmark, it takes 3 hours to get across the country in train
And i hate traveling
But its on the other side of the world rip
I want to go

<a:VerSpin:409479566172618753>
Bikki gif!
Look at my profile pic
I love nitro
With the power of love
Both bikki and miku gets annuniki powers and fuck shem ha up together
Even better omg
Like miku
Thats why she disnt have the curse
Ye
And slam dunk sham has ass
Bikki dosmt have the curse, woulnd surprise me if all relics get rekted but bikki gets annuniki powers
Could also be cool
But i feel it would be when the battle ends aginst shem ha, either that or we get bikki barehanded punching shem ha because of godly powers awakening in bikki like how strong enki is
I have a feeling yeah
Yaaaaazzzzzzz
<a:VerSpin:409479566172618753>
I live for hibimiku
Mmmmhhhhmmmm
And gayship
Lots of <:HibiMiku:432007202136391690> drama
=
The more bikki suffers from dmg the more sad miku we get
Because bikki
And efter it all with surviving she will get cool prostetic arm with ROCKETO PUUUUUNCHE
Thats more like it!
But arm gets cut off and she is impaled by the light beams
Thats not mortal in anime tho
And even with a certain death wound she gets shem ha out of miku and fights shem ha real new body and after that just collapses from the wound pain and fatige and then we get to miku caring for bikki for awhile <a:PartyBlibbleWibble:613783618644607007>
Woulnd surprise me honestly
Yup
Bruh
I deffidently gotta binge the whole series again when its all out
And 9 episodes on the fifth
Binged the 4 first seasons in 4 days
A few week ride for me
Riiiip
That episode was so good and long
Pull a kanata no astra last episode on us symphogear
Nah the 40 min epi will be 13
Would be a devestating cliffhanger oof
And ends with bikki death making miku give up and being fully controlled
After bikki is killed by shem ha and revived somehow ofc
Bikki and miku get annuniki powers and slam dunk shem together calling it
Yee
Got off track there
Haha
Sry  <@263983345669505025>
So it helps a bit
Oh well i cant go to symphogear 2020 but at least im going to babymetal in feburary and rammstein in august both in aarhus
<:MutsukiHyperStare:588629678017871872>

Stuff like dat
And the shadows apprentice
Like deltore quest
I read a lot of adventure novels as a teen
Yes as in i do like to read, but no as in i dont do it because i became a weeb so now its just manga
Well yes and no
Oh that was for me V:
Ye?
I just dont remeber what i might be right in so i sent the catwat emote haha
No no xD
<:catWhat:606168575576899585>
On that day sumphogear discussien channel got a grim reminder, that the jojo will always take over
Bites za dusto!!!
Maybe a season where it goes back to right after the season xdu diverge from the anime series
Gib xdu anime
As long as they release symphogear songs in xdu i'll never forget symphogear heh

Gungnir is gonna get destroyed calling it
Bikki stronk
True
I like those, main character secret identity is found out and turns their life upside down kinda stuff a lot
The old one got smashed
As it was just a handful of people who was up above grouns to see it
I wasnt sure if it was all who knew by the end of s1
No random strangers being like, omg you the girl who saved the world
Everything is like it didnt happen
Like season 3 starts
I still love how none at the school reconised biiki at the end of season 2 when she was streamed world wide
You see them at the end of axv inthink without sounds and at the start at xv
Their voice actors wasnt hired for those 2 seasons
The girl trio at school
Well uuhhh they did actually remove 3 characters from axv and xv
Im fine with it as im a massive bikki fan and like it when she is the "hero" C:
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
The big song
The superb song that also consumes their relics i bet
Ooohhhh
<:OwariWOKE:588629686578315264>
ENLIGHTEN ME FELLOW WEEBS

Lmao i would go out and kill someone of anger
<:HibiMiku:432007202136391690>

<:Ver:336656981144109066>
XD
ARE YOU KIDDING ME
HE FUCKING SHOWED UP
LMAO

it felt way more rushed than the other endings or is that just me???
im just being salty i think
not satisfied
and no kimi dake ni
could they atleast say i love you
btw that last scene reeeeeeeee
idk, it just felt weird to me
hmmm
it just felt really weird
it was weird
this ending felt bad
i am so confused and dissappointed by dis
okay, this was one hell of a fucking weird last episode
tho i'll forever stay salty about bikki not directly singing kimi dake ni
hmmm
"lmao let me save you from explosion and have nice dialoge with you two"
is one of the things i mean by weird
the way shem-ha casually turns good out of nowhere tho
<a:VerSpin:409479566172618753>  <- literally me right now
help me plz
I AM SO CONFUSED RIGHT NOW
WHY ARE WE ALL SCREAMING
fucking sheit
and that my theories were wrong
thats probably why im so salty and feeling the ending is weird
im probably just in denial
guys i think i know whats wrong
LMAO amazing
wait there is an extended scene in gx?
top 10 things thats scared me
starting azur lane without knowing the volume on your phone is max "AZURE LANEU!!!!!!!"
and i want the story as well
but xdu got nice songs n shit
10k danish crowns btw
what would i not do with symphogear
i literally already used 10k on azur lane in 1 year
they can put xdu in the west i promise they'll make money
i want english xdu T_T
that right there is pretty bittersweet <:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
^
we dont really know for certain if the gears are forever broke
heard
or thats what i head
btw im confused, wasnt it supposed to be a bitter sweet ending?
im happy for them
btw i love how many fans got their wish fulfilled with the normal miku finally being a gear user
wait wasnt there a third ova seires?!
YES!

and in the opening
nah teh symphogears are fine
YEEEEEEEEEEEEE
which means lets get this movie on the road and beat some returning custodians!
so the gears are probably still there
which have happened many times
so far they just get dmged enough in the explosion to get put out of relic form
it never really says anything about them being destroyed
dont think so
watching the two fire force episodes im behind, hearing tamaki talk hurts, same VA as bikki T_T
AAAAAAARRRRRRRRHHHHHHHHGGGGGGGGG IT HURTS
<a:VerSpin:409479566172618753>
<@104194257908154368> lmao wtf dude (hit me up with a link when your done plz)
or my friends will literally kill me
i jsut have to finish part 5 jojo and demonslayer something that just finished airing first
i'll have to binge the whole series again . . .
<:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
might just go off myself honestly
i think im losing it bois
day 1 without symphogear
i like lolies . . . but for the love of god anime its because they are inncent and cute liek suika in doctor stone, dont turn them in to cringe fests T_T
oh no
because i have already seen all the memes about her dying
and then i wont have to see her suffer
oh yeah gotta watch the illya magical girl thingy, looks fun haha
saber is jsut ugh
because sakura is also better girl
and heavns feel when all 3 movies are out
rin better girl anyway
probably just gonna watch ubw at some point instead
the saber route one is meh
and tried watching the first stay one but it was to old and meh
only watched zero
i hate this fate lybarinth
of wait the jeanne thing is from apocryphia, jesus series stop having so many names . . .
the one with jean d arc as mc and then some with the pink haired chick as mc
isnt there like 4 or something?
because so far i know there is a few of them lol
but is she in the anime as well? and which of the grand orders then?
i saw she is in the fate grand order game
someone from fate or what i could find, but which of the many thousand series lmao
who is okita?
gotta look up all the animes she is in as a character that is either mc or shows up a lot and see if its worth watching just for more aoi yuuki haha
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
thank you solo
but now oh god i do
ACTUALLY not thinking that for once
i was actually
obviously its gen our man
it was never the girls being the mc
everyone we are completely wrong
to be honest
ye
well, the 6 girls are the main girls really, with bikki being the main main girl
i keep putting two 'n' in lol
a canon kiss okay im sorry
LMAO
if its cannon im happy
or in xdu, i dont care if its just a cg
i atleast want an actual cannon kiss between them <:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
we need a movie!
but seriously tho
same
'hmmmmm
but still dont allow it in real life
japan and their love for gay ships in anime
rip
dont even remember what year
oh wait just forgot that the actual legal gay marriage is a kinda new thing lol, even tho i live in the country who allowed it first in the world
gay is legal in japan?!
well i wouldnt mind buying the stuff if it was possible
and then after the fight bikki and miku gets married
PLZ
and bikki man fisting them all
give us movie with bad custodians coming back to earth
i want
plz
looks like some dark stuff
oh no
google is my friend
gib sec
tsukihime?
there characters in carnival that arent from fate aint there?
all i know from carnival is that its fun and happy instead of dark and sad like the series, and that lancer dies all the fucking time lmao
what happens when i go into this chat
oh christ its 3:21, i was about to go to bed at 2:50 lmao
i like
bikki being gay mmmmhhhhmmmm
ah
In classical antiquity, the seven classical planets were (are) the seven moving astronomical objects in the sky visible to the naked eye: the Moon, Mercury, Venus, the Sun, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn.
whats a classical planet
but the moon isnt a planet, earth is
not the moon
i think bikki is earth btw
your in denial <:Ver:336656981144109066>
LMAO
evil bikki is interresting
my sunshine is nice
he was practically fine because he stood infront of tsubasa sword right after to protect him
why he lost
only because he couldnt really hurt him
gen could beat everyone else
only reason for symphogears to be used is because of noise lmao
gen is a literal god
