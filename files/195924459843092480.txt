Sunrise has made a new Mai-HiME series in the franchise since 2010 in collaboration of Satelight, best known for our fave franchise.
ok, the guy who created Mai-HiME franchise who helped the other creators created Symphogear franchise goes under the different name as Mr. Inai or Inai-san, now that makes sense where Mai-HiME as well as Mai-Otome influence comes from.  Now you know why Symphogear is the modern Mai-Otome

Mai-SymphoGeAR is a good ring to the title
yo, this would have been a sickass collab... maybe one day when Sunrise/Bamco and Satelight do something about it... Ah well, it would have been a nice April Fool joke tho


After this post on Twitter, everyone on Twitter starts to talk about it. There will be 2nd Mai-HiME anime. So that Uki guy is going to be responsible for new Mai-series? Sounds about right... He does Digimon.... So that fits his career.

Hello, how is everyone's start of the New Year. Finally, the whole Mai-HiME Destiny has been fully translated. That took like exactly 15 years to be done with English translation. The first 8 chapters is done by Ris and Makoto of Maki Maki Scanlations while the last 5 chapters is done by none other than me. I hope everyone have a great start of the year.  I'll be doing some small edits on the last 5 chapters.
