Guys...
What do you think about biological weapon facilities found in Ukraine?
Probably played MW 2019 singleplayer too much
Man...
It's so hard to trust Mass Media nowdays
It Physically hurts me to see a news about Xenophobic behavoir against Russian people
https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/russia-accuses-ukraine-of-missile-strike-on-donetsk--ukraine-denies/47430430
It's difficult to trust mass media nowdays
This is what i once said there
You probably seen an unconfirmed rumor
I didn't found any news about blocking Discord
Maybe because they're poor and having a family to feed?
He should support the diplomatic solutions to Ukranian crisis, not military
I can't understand Josep Borrell
Russian military never uses a chemical weapons
A lie
I can't stop watching news and hoping for the best...
Urghh...

I really should stop posting here
and stop reading the news
it's really hard to find the truth in media these days
But at the end...
There will be no winners on this war...
I won't say that i supporting Putin
But i don't believe that Ukraine's suffering will end before winter if they keep sending military help
How the heck military help from other countries will help him to end this conflict before winter?
It would be better if he would ask G7 for help in negotiations with Putin
I just don't understand why Zelensky keeps asking for military help in conflict he have very low chances to win?
Check the comments on this article
https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10956653/Zelensky-says-Ukraine-war-end-winter-calls-G7-leaders-anti-aircraft-systems.html#comments
I am afraid of a future of Ukraine
Long wars do not benefit to anyone
Can't disagree
I doubt that Putin would let Ukraine take donbass back
What about donbass?
It might take 10 years or more to recover from all this calamity
is that a joke?
Nothing
that was a cringe
I remember him saying that if Putin was a woman he woudn't attack Ukraine
Yeah
ok
in ohter words:pracically not good?
how fast it would reload?
Wow
How much creativity this guy had?

I imagine some kid finding a horror video in YTKids and getting psychological trauma
Especially Live-action Mulan
That was supposed to pander to Chineese
Remember production problems of SW Episodes VIII and IX
and every their IP as a milking cow
Disney treats every studio like a machine
I thought gaming industry have a shitty working conditions
I won't be surprised if i see something like this in some TV-show or movie about future
This looks like a gag from Futurama
But would he really agree to order people to make a Gachi statue?
Yeah 
he would ask to destroy Catherine II's statue
Would Zelenskiy agree on that?
<:MikuWorry:672908523495227432>
That dosen't sound real at all
Thanks.
