I remember speaking to someone (Who i regret not assaulting) who said "At least fascists care about the culture" and said it was fine that once nazis are in power the culture card is thrown away
and people in general are afraid of change
neonazis exist because they are extremely good at propaganda
and when they get shit thats like "oh there were fascists here make them THIS strong" they just reject it with a flat "lol no"
I mean, i respect the people behind kaiserreich since they take submissions for actually researched possible alternate histories
eugh
nazis in viddy game
I mean... i really liked Red Orchestra 2 because at least half the time playing was killing nazis
do people not expect this to be found...
~~idk if adenauer was good or bad so forgive me~~
my boy adenauer
Im glad that theres options now for germany to play as democratic imperial or communist
oh yeah no paradox grandstrats are great, the players are not
how it spits in the face of his racist ideology
theres a news event that talks about the 1936 berlin olympics and how hitler was snubbed by an african american getting a gold medal
HOI IV does point out the nazis racism in other ways though
though i think thats a case of "We dont want a 'push this button for genocide' button in our game"
also hearts of iron iv makes no reference to the holocaust, even in western releases...
senor hilter who can lead argentina in _Very difficult to attain circumstances_

Hearts of iron also has...
and even in the western version all swastikas are replaced with iron crosses
hearts of iron IV does not display hitler at all
the impetus for having more children is often poverty/harsh conditions
but that also means more industrial production doesnt it?
i'll wait for them to explain if they like
i did jump the gun im sorry
did you mean economic growth rates
or
re: China's birth limit
<@!476058996315389953> i dont want to be rude but... that is a very bad idea
hhhhhhhhhhhhh
hhhhhhhhh
theyre just expressing their extreme frustration
imho it cant be fixed
ignoring the fact that the east german govt was run by the nazis they didnt hang?
but they both require a level of personal responsibility
Liberty and safety are not mutually exclusive rights
let me rephrase my initial statement
I prefer the term liberty over freedom
like murder n stuff
and morally certain actions deserve consequence
the missing ingredient is justice
safety is a responsibility
freedom is a right
It really isnt
shut the fuck up
super fuckang mad
like
im really mad that the national guard is no longer regulated at the state level
i need to re-read the constitution
so in that case its constitutional to infringe upon their gun rights
the constitution also defines those who have committed felonies as being forfeit of their rights
"The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people."
revocation on status of felonly is a state level deal i think
thats as it is, how it always was
A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.
no
No
i have a lot to say about guns but i dont have the energy right now
though thats besides the point
I know florida ~~of all places~~ is revisiting voting rights laws for convicts
though that differs state by state
convicts can earn the right to vote over time, but cannot regain the ability to own a a gun
i mean in switzerland they give you an automatic rifle
but no matter what the FBI is involved in every legal gun purchase
in the US there are varying levels of how much documentation you need
and got banned
said some fuck shit
he showed up
either way, you're being an idiot for reducing the argument to the absurd
or within my heavy object throwing distance
or my workplace
I dont have to let you be an asshole in my home
I dont think you can really argue "There's genocides happening, leave japan alone to sell child pornography in open air markets"
I dont see it being morally justifiable to not be on the list
yeah that's a can of worms im not gonna touch with a 20 foot pole and a hazmat suit on
oh that was the context

thanks DUP...
<:ok:564041496836177920>
Fair enough
Oh
You mean subversion of expectations
Oh
I know what you mean
Ok I'm not trying to be rude but "expectancy violation" sounds weird
Uhh
OK
I believe this bill is irrelevant to protecting children from abuse, and wont stop or cause any either way
If the UN is not putting effort towards protecting children from abuse, i beleive they should
I dont think the UN's consideration of this bill is taking away from any (if they exist) efforts towards protecting children from abuse
so let me put it this way, before we get frustrated about things
I think it can be compared to treating a drug addiction by just taking "a smaller dose" of the drug
wanting to play a violent video game is a different urge than wanting to consume child porn
I dont think thats true
but is it unreasonable to also say they're both legitimate problems that need addressing
yeah
and can prevent someone from getting psychiatric help
Is it unreasonable to say that it's enabling of that behavior
?
vote for me 2020
the ATF has to give you a shotgun if you're lgbta and if you dont want it you get a puppy
free guns if youre lgbta
I would say "keep the idea, but put it before a committee for review and fleshing out"
i mean yeah
oh no we cant have pantyshots of middle school girls anymore /s
because logically that can reduce to "we dont need to do anything, because something worse can come up"
its a big fallacy to say "Oh there's worse shit going on"
its just not a great sentiment
and i get anand's initial statement but
but thats still _not a good look_
like cool you think genocide is bad because it is
Chaos Space EMarines
I dont think a child should find out that out there someone is consuming a facsimile of their abuse
yes
I believe the existence of drawn child pornography is harmful to children
then my one remaining issue is this
it rules but thats valid
but its cool because it has a battleaxe
this one isnt very popular because its reclaimed nazi markings

that one and the one with the battleaxe
there's only two lesbian flags
Darjeeling did nothing wrong
nice
Matoi Ryuuko?
if i ever say something like "SHALL NOT BE INFRINGED" please understand that my tongue is firmly in my cheek
sometimes yeah
i dont like arguing that much
i just try to be as clear and considerate as possible
i mean

civilizations fall but people are left behind
ok
you wanna explain what you mean by that buddy
even in europe
but you'd notice
its like an edge up of 0.0001% than the rest of the world
before someone tells me whats fucked up here
that is a very strong relatively
**relatively** good in the USA
ftmp we have it
tbh i just wanna shack up deep in the wilderness with a pile of guns, a cat, a dog and some rudimentary farming tools
let it be know that i hate the fuck democrats and i hate the fuck republicans
for a president?
so theres zero chance trump is removed from office
it's really a bad faith effort
but no the democrats are performing the impeachment proceedings because it forces GOP politicians to reckon with the BS that trump is pulling
since the pretense of the impeachment is regarding quid pro quo with another country then if trump is removed from office so too is pence
also if a president is impeached for something treasonous their whole administration is ousted
ayyyup
and it wasnt the NSA it was the FBI
or discord has to report certain patterns to the feds
that is, los federales are watching discord for red flags
but it is something to consider
Its not legal, in the specific case the charges were dropped
the FBI has raided an otherwise innocent person for making memes using the term
its not offensive, just a flag word for law enforcement
something something 2 electric b______
please dont use it
hey: real talk: a certain phrase that rhymes with "big igloo" and "booger glue" can get our server tagged by the NSA and ATF
sue me
whatever
okay
Im not afraid
but <@!189146272865845248> i'm a gun nut online
[looks at my `router`]
[looks at my `several` guns]
i just felt it prudent to warn yall
yeah
all i know is, two firearms enthusiast discords i know have banned the phrase altogether
thats 70 years old
I'm going to jail for my military spec rifle...
i have a few antiques
my skeet shotgun nooooo
oh fuck
oh jeeze
The phrase "boogaloo" refers to shooting government agents attempting to seize firearms
Im looking for it
well they can't
<@115744398997716995> its used a lot by people who joke about shooting law enforcement
find my own planet and horatio
If we get sufficiently advanced space travel imma just
hmm
politiscales keeps callin me a socialist
what is it about
I think you have the wrong idea
but lets not get into that in the anime channel
I prefer home-made justice
even if its a cop show
it's really good so far
im on ep 2
nice
is anyone else watching Babylon
thats the reverse?inverse? harem
Kyou wa have a nice day at the brandenburg gate huh
