I wish you the best
Yeah I think theyd be more receptive now if you told them more. But I can’t really make that call for you of course.
Yeah
Rip
Oh
I honestly believe you should tell a medical professional or dietician if possible but then again I’m not sure how that would pan out
<:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
