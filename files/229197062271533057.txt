Welcome <@298016239798976523>
welcome everyone
We should have shown him the glory before he left 😢
Welcome
Welcome 😄
<@!625229248461930497> well, nice to see you, welcome 😄
i don't know if you mean that, but if i hear ange, i mostly remember cross ange 😄
oh, you should, princess principal was a really enjoyable watch (the movie as well)
that was quick, welcome 😄
heyho 😄
does at least look divine enough to be
Since I don‘t use twitter, it was more of my own curiosity as I won‘t be in the place to share pictures. 😄
Just out of curiosity, would it be ok, if the account credited the owner of the content (with link and all)
at least isn't far off 😄
so, a catgirl kiri does make sense
well, Kiri does have a tail on some of her clothes
But I do feel better now 😅
I just have to vent a little and was on this discord so I apologize in advance and put everything into spoiler so you don’t have to read it, if you don’t want, especially since it’s about politics and I don’t want to discuss, just went:
||why do I idiot share news articles about migration politics with my brother, he is extremely on the opinion you have to get everyone into here and give them everything without even demanding something, like if you want a house, here, get a house and so on. On the other side of the discussion is my stepfather who is fed up at this point since there are indeed a few black sheep within the groups who fled and seek asylum here... I sit between them I have the opinion, as long as you can help you should help, but helping the right way and not just push money around. And you don’t follow the law should go, we have enough native idiots here... and for both I am not enough on their side and get flak from both... I should learn and never bring up politics if either of them is close||
Sorry, I just had this server open when I was angry and now you had to suffer because of it, I am really sorry
yeah, had in my head that they used stronger language
didn't even the Taliban condemn Russia?
well, was a big explosion either way
https://twitter.com/ywnreporter/status/1498723256999755777?s=21
don't know how real this footage is, but there seemed to be a big explosion near Kharkiv
A very inhumane way to keep yourself safe from Russia is to forbid learning Russian and expel every Russian speaking person.
Now Russia has no one in your country to claim.

But as I said, that’s a very inhumane way and I doubt any country would do it and if one country does it, there will be international backlash
True, but I only need to learn Russian and I am automatically a Russian citizen, a interesting way to define your citizen
So, if I were to learn Russian, I am a Russian and can vote in Russia etc?
well, from experience, when I am stressed, I sleep less
since i am no expert, I won't say which one is true, just that I heard it does 🤷
depending on the country, google tells you something different 🤔 

"psychological stress increases the risk of miscarriage. There is an disturbance that causes an imbalance in the immune system and hormone balance during pregnancy. A lower hormone balance (especially progesterone) can be witnessed, which maintain the pregnancy."
but stress can affect the pregnancy. They can't terminate it themselves at will, sure. But too much stress over an extended period of time can end in a miscarriage afaik
the current numbers, let's see how it will turn out after everything is counted, only in Soest the first past the post is known (CDU got that seat)
at the edge to the Emsland
nope Münsterland
yeah, went an hour ago before I forgot 😄
until 18:00
yes
the few people here living in NRW, I hope you did vote today (or still will) 😄
True
Reminds me of the winter war, technically a soviet win since they got land but humiliated themselves during it
True
well, if you are an english speaker, there are some options, just to name a few: Australia, England, Ireland, New Zealand, Northern Ireland, Scotland or Wales (and yes, I did split up the UK)
I think the only way to change it, is if a someone storms a meeting of high level republican politicians and starts shooting them. Not saying someone should do it, just that unless those are victims of gun violence, they won't change their mind
people who claim otherwise are just idiots who need an assault rifle to hunt a deer since they are just to dumb to aim correctly with a rifle
yeah, everyone has the right to bear arms but at the same time are responsible for using them. So yeah, stricter gun laws wouldn't be against the second amendment 😂
I didn't read the article, but what I can see without clicking on it, it seems what we predicted in my family came true. Shutdown commands on the farm equipment was used 😄
It is also “The Netherlands” and not just “Netherlands”. Some countries are just this way
worst case nothing to lose
That’s the very reason why promise and the word for “slip of tongue” (or “misspoke) are the same in german 😄
Ich habe versprochen… (I did promise/pledge…)
Ich habe mich versprochen (roughly: I misspoke)
true
If all wars can be handled this or in a similar way
just setting up a flag and put a bottle of alcohol, then the next country comes, changes the flag, takes the bottle and leave their own bottle 😄
but a funny kind of war
just, that they most likely have less money to use afterwards, since they are on their own
doesn't mean they shouldn't be independent, if they want
it is the same, why a lot of small islands are still part of their colonial overlord, they would lose a lot of economic benefits
So Greenland would lose $591 million each year, or to be precise, has that much less each year to use
$591 million in subsidies annually
and Greenland needs to get it some other way
so that money would be gone
yes, but Denmark pays Greenland a shit ton of money (don't remember the exact amount though)
at least until they have enough infrastructure to extract the gas and oil, the melting ice might expose
but Denmark pumps a lot of money into Greenland, so I think it will be more advantageous for Greenland to remain in the Kingdom of Denmark
Because I wouldn’t be surprised if republicans would vote for him (and some democrats as well)
But if he indeed relinquish his US citizenship once, like Kat said, we should be in the clear
Oh god…
But Boris wasn’t born in the US, doesn’t that automatically disqualify him?
I don’t defend her (nor do I judge her), just saying she wasn’t Russian by birth
Her upbringing does.
Catherine was a born german though.
Yes, she adopted Russian culture and religion early during her time at the court
There is no equal amount of female leaders in any military in the world, so yeah, if Putin would have been a woman, the chances would be way lower for Putin to be in power and able to wage war.
In Russia? Yeah
Well, Johnson finally resigned it seems
Idiots…
Which one?
Yeah, who needs a car? The house I am living in has three people (two apartments). There are two cars but one is from the work place and will be gone next year.
We three will share the one remaining car starting then since we can get by mostly by walking, riding the bike or using the trains.
I would be scared as well, BUT I am neither a soldier nor a policeman. So there is a difference between them and me
and I don't let it get to me too much, only annoying thing is if family members get on my nerve to socialize more even if I feel uncomfortable for more socializing than I do atm
don't worry 😉
meeting people, having fun with them, go drinking and all is no problem, but I just can't get any closer. There are only two people I am close enough to call my friends and those I know since I was a small child
and relationships are build on trust
might just be that I don't trust people in general
don't know why though
It's not
I just don't feel like having an intimate relationship with anyone
🤷
I don't know, I am not comfortable with any close relationship, no matter if the over person is a man, woman or other.
then 79F sounds ok, if outside is warmer
ah yeah, forgot that texas needs cooling more than heating...
79F is way to warm in an apartment around 64.4 is enough
NEVER trust other drivers, always expect them to be either total assholes or incompetent. Can safe your life
Well, it is his son, so it is ok. If it were other people, then it would be a problem for him.
then it sounds you might just get a small talking to
but I don't think you get fired, that would be the more unlikely result (still a possibility though)
depends, does it now seem like the company lost money? If you reported your mistake right away it depends on your boss, so it can range from being warned to be more careful up to being fired
sure, questioned yes, but just refusing to follow them until they are changed (if the change makes sense), then you are still liable to be sentenced to some sort of penalty and that you have to accept in that case
if you are born and raised in a country, also you adopted the culture (what ever that exactly means), you are of that nationality and nothing else.
even if your ethnicity doesn't come originally from that country, you are still of that country. Still dividing causes divide within the society of that country and breeds trouble.
sure, if they are first generation immigrants (they came to the country from outside themselves), I can still understand it a bit, or if they refuse to adapt to that country. Not saying one should forget where they are from, but if you wanna live in a different country, you have to follow that countries laws, need to speak the language etc. If your customs (religious or cultural ones for example) would go against the law of the country you moved to, then you have to let it go.
if your parents are US citizen, you are an US American, nothing else 🤷
before Napoleon there wasn't even nationalism in Germany, each of the (sometimes up to) 300 independent (but within the administration of the HRE) states had their own thing
Germany is comparable to Italy in that regard, a shit ton of dialects, different foods and a few different customs as well.
for sure, compare to european countries the US isn't that divers.
Even in smaller countries (for example Switzerland), there are multiple ethnic groups, languages etc.
There are bigger countries like Italy and Germany which are, at least as an united entity, very young. There are a lot of local customs and languages, that differ from the rest of the country. And both are maybe the size of Texas.
It’s more that they are open about it and don’t hide. So it does look like it got more but in reality it didn’t
On the other hand, if someone does something and it doesn’t negatively impact me, I don’t care.
Marry if you want, it’s just not for me 😄
Lily
Well, marriage itself, or the need for marriage to be exact annoys me as well
I am recovered since 30th of June this year, still cough a lot. My doctor prescribed me an asthma spray this week, let’s see if it helps
Pictures? <:ElfneinPlease:853855738786217994>  (Not in this Channel of course 😄 )
For sure but as long as warmongers are sitting on a nice chair at home while soldiers fight, we will have armed conflict.
If they are at high risk of dying themselves, they might be less inclined for armed conflict
And Sahara was the first region that came to mind with very few to no people
I saw the “does” before your edit
If they wanna fight, why not send them and the opposing army into the Sahara and let them fight.
Obviously together with those who ordered the war.
Should prevent collateral damage
It is not the most beautiful crown but an old one with a lot of historical significance
As long as they don’t have real power I don’t mind monarchs, but overall they are a relic of the past.
If they still exist in a country and just have representative duty and no power, let them be 🤷
I meant just saying the phrase, god save the queen rolls better of the tongue than god save the king.
Just comparing these two, not to other anthems
But maybe just because one is used to it
Queen sounds better though
From god save the queen to god save the king
The anthem needs to be changed as well again
Charles isn’t crowned yet but de facto the king
For that reason I used the neutral “monarch”
Isn’t the British monarch de jure head of state of all the commonwealth nations?
De facto the monarch delegates that power though iirc
Inheritance war and complete dissolution of the commonwealth
To be fair to Estonia and Latvia, they don’t have the same economy as the front runners in that statistic.
Going by % of GDP would paint a little different picture
Everyone can believe what they want as long as they don’t force it on other people.
Well, a bomb threat is forcing one’s beliefs/opinion on other I would say
Just saw, she is resigning 😂
to be fair, meeting Johnson and Truss in the same meeting with an old woman will kill everyone
I don’t know, I don’t care for him. Know his name but always forgot what he is famous for
Comparing planned parenthood/abortion with the holocaust is an insult to the victims of the holocaust
Well, some sort of compensation should be awarded at least.
But yeah, a billion is crazy 😂
true as well
yeah, destroying money or donating it to a charity, I think we can all agree, the donation is the better option
We lowered ours to 16 under the current government as well (or are still in the process of doing so) here in Germany
Bigger countries (in area or in population) do need to be divided if we want a federal European country
I am no art critic, but that looks better than some “art” that gets attention nowadays
He was charismatic for sure, sadly used it for the wrong things
I think this was one of his
