After her arc in GX and Stand up! Ready!!, she's finally the queen I wanted her to be in G
I know! Talk about timing.
Thanks. Started watching the series back in November and fell madly in love. I need folks to talk about it forever with instead of blowing up my friends' chats or other servers
They do not have the determination

It'll also be good for summer cons if I go to one this year 'cause it gets *HOT* out here
We‚Äôll be inside the whole time, so should be okay
Pieces obtained today. We‚Äôre going for the summer look with the suspenders and no black overshirt (‚Äòcause those puff sleeves are hard to find). Just need the tie, gloves, and belt and I‚Äôm good to go
No guarantees
Funnily enough, that‚Äôs something of our relationship as friends. Legit calls me his mom
Friend wanted to do Zircon and he called me in to do Yellow Diamond

Cosplay is fun.
Although one's my thrifted D&D character cosplay. Other one is Fire Emblem Awakening's Robin.
I had one for each day of the con. I think I've got...two more fits? So max 5.

One of the art vendors recognized my Land of the Lustrous look and we talked for a bit. Mans ended up sliding me a button of Phos for free
Also, cool AF Makima

Macross Delta is the one I was most aware of (because of the September meme). Have been meaning to check it out, but Symphogear got me first

What‚Äôs strange about the dynamic of Drei Wing is that Tsubasa functions so differently between her relationship with Maria and her relationship with Kanade, so that expression of ‚Äúwat‚Äù is apt

Yes~
Go off
Aside from making beef stroganoff
And that's a Bikky who wouldn't know how to throw hands <:HibikiOhNo:586337444597596202>
"Why do you go to school that's two hours away from home?"
-"I wanted to escape my *dark past*."
Thaaaat's it. I think I got it mixed up with a joke from Bocchi the Rock
Well, wait, I forget, was it that Hibiki attended Lydian to get away from her old home where every knew about her involvement in the incident, or was that something that I misremembered?
<:TsubasaNote:689554460044820608>
We could count it
Perhaps
So
And she likely wouldn't have transformed if they weren't in immediate danger
Wait, wait, wait... G Ep.7, where Hibiki transforms to protect the Stroganoffs from Dr. Ver's Noise. Hibiki almost spontaneously combusted during the fight
Had to prove if Bikky was an anime character or not
I mean, Elfnein was unwittingly a part of a scheme that nearly did get everyone killed, so maybe not *directly* an attempt on her life, but still...
Now *this* is accurate
This I require.

üëÄ
The show gives us interesting indications via Chris and Tsubasa‚Äôs respective visions, so there‚Äôs a tone set. The trouble is some of the detail with certain characters. I feel like the Zababies would be tough to do because their pasts are so undefined. ~~But I‚Äôm also not super invested in them so that‚Äôs another barrier~~
We'll never know <:MariaDefeated:688429716780089397>

Yes. Good. Protecc she.

I just want to listen to Kakusei and scream it at the top of my lungs while stomping my feet and clapping
TRIGGER dubs end up being pretty good. I love the Kill la Kill dub
Saw the English dub in theaters, I‚Äôm more partial to Japanese Kray, but that‚Äôs it
REAL
I‚Äôve seen it twice in theaters, and I own it on Blu-Ray
Love that opening
I think there's something about the stillness of the manga, the way the paneling breaks down moments into something you can just absorb for as long as you want that lets stuff sink in and really feel
Having seen the anime before reading the manga, I knew what was going to happen in certain scenes, but the way the paneling goes in certain scenes just sticks with me. Shit hits different
Land of the Lustrous do be like that
||Here for a good time, not a long time.||
||GHOST THE GOAT||
That bit is fantastic
If the last three episodes could've been the whole series, that's a show I'd be all about.
I didn't really enjoy Knights & Magic. Watching it, I learned the value of conflict. I was...very bored. Didn't find the development of the mechs very compelling. It was all motivated by the main character's hard-on for robots and nothing else. I get why dedicated mecha fans or folks who are also into engineering and robots might like it, but I did not
No
It's an university anime club classic. We always watch it for our April Fools' meeting as an absurd break from the plain awful stuff
The best kind of trash.
I still need to go and finish this. It's so goofy and I love it
Joan of Arc was not blonde, folks
I love this OP
Even better.
It's free real estate
Adults however?
This is a warning for children exclusively
That‚Äôs me hearing Matt Mercer in anything
My heart feels like lead, but it ended with *just* enough of a positive note to not leave me with the overpowering feeling of overwhelming disgust that Dawn of the Deep Soul still invests in me.
Tonight, I watched Made In Abyss Season 2. All of it. In one sitting.
As nice as the visuals are, there is no plot or character worth investing in. All the hopes instilled by the first episode (which is pretty compelling) will be dashed by Ep.4 and then continue to trend down and down and down
Watched Sonny Boy, all of it.

My advice? Don‚Äôt do it.
We‚Äôre already onstage.
I freaking *love* that Revue
YORI TATAKU YORI KAGAYUKU
I am tempted to mention a little visual detail that you won't be able to unsee.
||In just about every single frame, there's a little reddish-pink glow or lens flare. The light of the Top Star, faint, but always there--always in the minds of the characters.||
Good man.
You also *need* to watch the movie if you enjoy the series. The film takes everything to the next level.
Bit of a film nerd's paradise, if you're into that kind of heavy visual kind of experience.
Very dense with symbolism.
Revue Starlight is... something else.
YAS
*hee hee hee*
Depends ü§î
Same, but I‚Äôll admit I‚Äôm the exact kind of person who‚Äôd indulge its melodrama and metaphor.
I need to improve it. I don‚Äôt actually have a cord for the jacket. Also need to 3D print the button.

I did learn how to make banana bread for that too. I committed hard to the bit.
I cosplay one of the Revue girls, so my stance on the show is somewhat evident.
There can only be one.
Same
I think it‚Äôs well-executed
Honestly, that‚Äôs all you need to know
A wish, more or less
Revue has solid character work

They're already onstage.
So there's some trivia.
I have been informed about that
> its a reference to Demian: The Story of Emil Sinclair's Youth, a novel that utena is heavilty inspired from
Have seen first three episodes of Utena. I am enjoying.
They provide a lot of good stuff. All that stuff I‚Äôve been posting in <#357682999300718592> ? Thrown together on school computers

Nono was my favorite part of Diebuster, so I am pleased
Host of Gunbuster/Diebuster watch party gave me this
Double feature.

Yes
We were asking if they fired the colorist
I‚Äôll take it
<:YumiPoint:688429724103344164>
I don‚Äôt think Smith was a worthwhile character though
If only because of how it affected Noriko, yeah, I agree
The end managed to do that, but I‚Äôll admit it didn‚Äôt grab me the same all the way through. Didn‚Äôt get quite into the characterization
See, the folks who left weren‚Äôt willing to invest on that level
I think they are cowards
It was was before even that
Also, Jung? She‚Äôs the realest
Just- Transcendent
I was nearly overwhelmed by the weight of history as the host pointed out that *that* was where the crossed mecha arms thing came from
We had a lot of folks leave before that fight. They are losers.
