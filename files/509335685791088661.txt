Thanks I had it commissioned from a friend of mine. I even got stickers made.
Hello
I wanna try a Moderoid kit myself.
Yeah, it honestly surpised me that Good smile got might gaine even though kotobukiya has been doing all the Brave Series Robots so far.
Facts
I love that thing so much
My favorite kit of the line so far is the Mazinkaiser
My local hobby shop just got in Kotetsu Jeeg
Awesome! Love the Infinitism Kits!
Those look really good. <@782841825069236236> also I don’t know if you saw but they showed a teaser video for Super mini pla Gao King and Super Shodo Gaoranger.
How are those kits?I haven’t tried one yet?
Yeah, I always keep glue on stand by when I build any kotobukiya kits
Imagine a female lead Kamen Rider
Love the art style
Those two are perfect as Double
That is Awesome!!
There is?!?!
The art looks really cool
Genius

I dont know which one I want to start with. lol.
Thanks! based on these descriptions some of these seem really good.
That was my mind set
Skateboarding cool!!!!
I haven’t seen either of those but I know a lot of people like those so that was a good indicator for the show.
Agree to all that and it also has a banger OP.
Dios va is in it and he is crazy
I’m enjoying the current show they are doing now Sk8 the Infinity.
I don't believe the second movie is cannon but the first takes place between season 2 and 3 I believe. I could be wrong tho.
Dont get me wrong I liked the movie but it was so over the top that I had seen enough of the franchise.
The second MHA movie ruined the show for me personally.
Nice
It does not need a dub
Wow
I wish I owned more gundam Blu-ray’s but they are so expensive.
Lockon Stratos best boi.
I cant believe sony owns them both now
Funimation is straight trash
Id like to read Skullman. I dont know if its been translated or not.
Im glad they are showing a lot more love to the Cyborg Bug Man of Justice.
Last thing anyone wants is for them to stop midway through.
That’s really good to hear.
I need to rewatch revue Starlight. Discotek better not disappoint. Lol. I hope people are buying the Blu-ray’s.
And I sit here and patiently wait for GX. The last good Blu-ray sale I got was Gatchaman Crowds season 1 + 2 for 18 dollars.
Yeah, I would have gotten it but I had to preorder the symphogear Blu-ray’s. Lol. Priorities come first.
The best I’ve seen Eureka Seven on sale was like 25 dollars but it was just the normal Blu-ray’s.
WHAT?!?
I am jealous lol
The Christmas sales from where I get my Blu-ray’s are never that good.
The Blu-ray’s are at least 50 dollars each and it’s only for 1 season.
That’s a really good price
Damn
or worse?
Is it as horny as DxD?
How is Testament? Its been on my watch list for a while.
Most hyped show of the year for me.
One month till SSSS.Dynazenon premieres. I am so hype.
A lot of that sameness can contributed to multiple gundams being derived or re engineered from past gundams. This case is well known especially in Universal Century.
Core gundam was a day one like for me because of Ebikawa.
Long legs and a lot of decals
Yeah, I’ve seen those. I want to make a Hibiki one of my own now. Those are awesome!
I’m still missing the Titans and G3 core gundams for my collection.
Yeah, I’ve seen some awesome customers from just mixing the standard parts.
FACTS
In what way did Gridman trip up?
I am so hype for Dynazenon. Gridman better show up.
and Superhuman Samurai Syber Squad.
I thought Gridman was amazing. All the references in the show are amazing. Especially if you watched the original tokusatsu.
nice
His slaps hold a great power
I believe that entirely
Its looks like Bandai is putting all their resources in Hathaway
Its not a gundam anime if someone doesnt get slapped
I have not watched Seed yet.
Rita
Thats the only time aliens have been in Gundam. and 00 awakening of the trailbreaker is a fun movie
I never would have imagined that in a Gundam anime
I was dying when I saw the ||Newtype Dolphins||
