<:KyonFacepalm:304559896022614016>
Why is the world full of idiots?
Wtf??
Still, this video made me more angry and disgusted than usual
Unfortunately, that’s true
https://youtu.be/p7nVntZpJLM
That’s fucked up
<:caRach:722393151796543518>
<:ChrisPray:672578403156885504>
Stay safe guys
Ouch
Some of my family members live in Tennessee. Idk how they feel about this
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
More like we're moving towards a dystopian society
That's so awful
<:TsubasaDisgust:349013662775902209>
And Leafy doesn’t seem to give a fuck either
I don’t care about Leafy, but the point has to be made
How can they look at this situation and say “That’s ok!”
I’m just saying that what Leafy did was not nearly as horrible as what Peluchin and all these other garbage people are doing
This is an actual sign for a person to become a serial killer
This is literally a serial killer in the making
Especially when it comes to punishing minors
The Latin America governments are fucking useless
Yeah, they can’t be bothered to deal with a Spanish speaking channel who is literally violating their terms of service and committing crimes for money
That’s the thing
His parents don’t give a shit
I just...I just can’t
They left this sick fuck alone for 2 years or so, but deleted Leafy’s channel like it was somehow worse
But Idk if YouTube is actually gonna do anything about it
Good thing Charlie talked about it because he has over 5 million subscribers
Absolutely disgusted that that Chile hasn’t thrown this sick fuck in prison for life and that YouTube has ignored this for years
Now Charlie reveals that Peluchin is still around YouTube killing cats
I remember seeing a lady who made a video about Peluchin last year
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUfcjcmUBmc
<:CinnaSorry:614728987058372609>
Again, I apologize for jumping the gun prematurely
But now I'm doubtful about all of my claims
Agreed
<:caYotsuBow:641059453571039282>
Uh, my bad guys, I just get really disgusted over this kind of shit
But yeah, we'll just have to wait and see
That's too much
Yeah, but kids tho?
If it actually showcases child nudity, fuck this film, but for now, we'll have to see to believe
But I guess we're just gonna have to wait to see
Uh, maybe it was manufactured, and it certainly seems insane
Uhhh, ok that's suspicious
IMDb put that in their guide
Again, the political angle doesn't matter to me
It's on IMDb for fucks sake
That's some grade A conspiracy bullshit
All I'm saying is that Netflix fucked up by bringing this film on their website in the first place
I don't care about the political angle here
https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9196192/parentalguide
<@!454822882045067298> It's from IMDb:
Yes, it would be inexcusable
This is the parents guide
https://twitter.com/errolwebber/status/1304176263289016320?s=21
But I don't like what I've heard about this film itself
It completely botched what the film was about
And I say fuck Netflix because the marketing was trash
Again, child nudity is too much
But there's better ways of handling this sort of thing
And that technically, it's not CP
Look, I get that this is personal experience
<:KirikaDisgust:688431636043268097>
Fuck Netflix
And that's not ok, no matter the reason
What we have in the case of Cuties is legal CP
<@!213645184125239317> The problem with the film is that it's showing off child nudity. I don't give a fuck about the reasons, that's inexcusable. There are better ways of handling this tough subject matter
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
I never watched it tho
I never saw the video you linked Lankpants, but that looks off
I don’t care if you agree
<:caTopKek:641148533038120960>
LMAOOO
The rest is ok
Those were good
He does have some really interesting videos, like the Traffichub video and the Club Penguin Online video
I just watch them in the background
Eh, I think his videos are ok
Not the best video
And the first video was just talking about the user reviews on Metacritic, but yeah, that’s a bit misleading
It’s a very quick review, but I feel like it got its point across fine
There’s other videos about the film too
And he said some positive things about it
The film, I mean
The second video actually saw it
I’ll give the video a quick rewatch
It’s on Netflix
Then it came out 2 days ago
He only mentioned what the critics had to say because they saw the film first
The majority of critics on the site have praised the film
Again, he’s just talking about the critics, not the audience
This is gross
But I still stand by everything else
Ok, the Rotten Tomatoes bit was stupid to say
I care about kids being exploited
<@284390402210136064> I don’t care about the politics
It’s focusing on what the critics say, bot the audience
But I cannot believe there’s people defending this sort of thing
Fair enough
And fuck Rotten Tomatoes
Fuck Netflix
Fuck this film
This is legit
Yeah, no. This isn’t about politics
https://youtu.be/ZciUIxbD4L4
https://youtu.be/C652uZNCCEg
It’s from a different server that I frequent
<:caOyasumi:641145185170096128>
Well, good night fellas
<:ShirabeCry:671887081026617345>
Again, sorry for judging too quickly
It’s on Netflix now
Maybe I’ll watch this film to see if my initial reaction is completely wrong
I'm a little cautious
It probably isn't even bad, but still
I want to know the truth, but I'm a little scared
So maybe we can confirm it soon
Cuties has been released on Netflix
If that's the case
I'm perfectly fine with that sort of thing then
Is that what the film is about?
Outrage is easy to exploit
This might’ve just been under the radar if Netflix didn’t do that
Yeah
Thanks for your time
This is the last time I’m gonna talk about this until I see the film
But yeah, this is just a mess
I’ll probably watch it to understand the truth
Because I’m just hesitant
But regardless, this situation makes me feel uncomfortable
I get that reactionaries are using this to gain attention
But I have a lot of suspicions
Maybe I wouldn’t have even realized it existed
I know
Regardless, I feel like what Kat is saying is drawing a line
Netflix fucked up
Netflix is at fault for their marketing
That’s probably true
And frankly disgusting and amoral
If the film wanted to tell a message about children should not be exploited by social media and producers, that’s fine, but if actual child nudity and exploitation is in the film...that’s hypocritical
That’s my main issue
That’s what I’ve seen
> from what I gathered from reactions, The Cuties are pretty pedophilic for shock value, as expected of edgy French director.
<@174272493777977344>
I’m really scared about doing this tho
And form my own opinion
At this rate, I might have to watch the film to see for myself
<:caJillSweat:717931554965422082>
I’ll look for other videos...
Well shit
I just found the video linked because of the first video
Oh...
<a:TsubasaBroken:663625017191432192>
Link?
I never heard of that?
Wait, what?
I’m sure there’s more in depth reviews for it
Simple and quick
Again, it’s just quick review
And if nothing else, the review I posted is at least decent
Look, from what I’ve seen so far, I’m scared to check it out
<:caPhosDed:692922721713258537>
The clips I’ve heard of aren’t exactly promising
I don’t
I’m done talking about this, until I see the film
But it depends on how the film is actually like
Fuck Facebook
<:KirikaDisgust:688431636043268097>
<:ChrisHibikiHug:630262562361049121>
Thanks man
Again, I know a friend who was affected
<@676272618839605249> Well, I personally haven’t heard of this person until today, but it seems like it was an anime community
Read the thread for more context
I also know one of the people mentioned
To warn for this kind of thing
I would like anyone here who has a Twitter to spread this around
https://twitter.com/LakeElysia/status/1333819144538611714
Yeah, I’ve had to look up words plenty of times, especially whenever I end up reading
This person isn’t a friend of mine, but another friend of mine retweeted it and I just had to try and spread the word
That makes sense
I usually wouldn’t but this seems so bad
Is it not a good idea to post gofundme stuff?
Please donate and spread this around
This person isn’t a friend of mine, but still
https://twitter.com/yukinogatari/status/1426342057124274179?s=21
Having said that, I’d hate to be a downer, but I saw this tweet get retweeted online by a friend:
Congratulations!
I do not trust this, but I voted yes

It’s cool that Madoka and Hibiki are voiced by Aoi Yuki
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
Never understood the giant girl fetish
Hibiki could make use of that too
True, although Tsubasa is the one who needs it the most in Symphogear
<:YumiPoint:688429724103344164>
That’s true
<:SayaDespair_MM:617329327465431044>
The closest person Madoka has to someone like Miku is Sayaka
> Madoka needs her own Miku emotional support

Why would anyone bother with Big Order? Lmao

I even wrote a review about it months ago
It handles its themes with the subtly and tact of a brick breaking a window
Ugh, I hated YLIA tbh
Yeah, I’ve been too busy with college and my stats professor is probably the worst one I’ve ever had, but I’ll talk more about that later too
It’s just that we should’ve got far more information on Kousei’s mother to understand how she got there
Good rebuttal tho
Again, I’ll go into more detail later
We only see the bad side of his mother, which is why that climax at the halfway mark is so bad to me
You could say he got help, but we don’t know
What I will say is that I just felt like something should’ve been done to help Kousei move past his trauma, hence why I mentioned the doctor bit
It’s too late for me to say much
A lot of interesting points, but I’ll have to respond to it later
I was too busy with college yesterday to do it then

<@!278860841485598720> Here's my response about what you said about YLIA:
<:caJillSweat:717931554965422082>
Idk about that, lol
Just wanted to address your arguments
Yeah, I posted that yesterday because I was busy on Monday
Oh, ok
<@!278860841485598720> Thoughts on my response?
Yui was amazing
Yeah, this latest episode is the best in the arc so far
Inuyasha is my first anime, as a matter of fact
Lmao, that sums up a lot of the comedy
