<:HibikiHug:620080558462205956>
<@193408538909868033> Nice sounds like it'll be a fun game :)
Thank you :)

Like a good easy to use app?
It could be better. I don't have a computer to draw with. Kind of had to use my phone. Does anyone know how to draw using just a phone?

Coconut Water :) always kills and prevents hangovers. Or at least for me that was the case. It's just a really good hydrator. If you are going to drink hard eat something. XD
https://www.pixiv.net/member_illust.php?mode=medium&illust_id=75494170
OMG Ogawa and Tsubasa would be really cute together. Male Tsubasa and Female Ogawa idk they almost deserve an anime. I'd watch this if it were it's own show. High school Musician dates Ninja Girl manager XD
Omg that one looks so much like Kanade XD
Actually some of those pics just make me lol. They are so out of character.
Oh God I get Homura Vibes
Oh nice! I'm getting long haired Hibiki tonight XD

Yeah <:MikuBliss:336657233712513024>
Yeah all this long hair stuff confused me
I could actually see Chris finding Miku attractive if she was a dude because she befriended Miku before she befriended everyone else XD
The scarest thing is that I can totally see this being entertaining. I'd totally play this over the new KFC game XD
Me too! <:HibikiWow:614268629952757760>
Mismagius=Carol 
Scyther=Kirika
MegaMawile=Shirabe
Slyveon=Serena
Jigglypuff=Maria 
Pikachu=Hibiki
RedMegaGyrados=Chris
Fearrow=Kanade
AltariaXhonedge=Tsubasa 
Cloyster=Miku 
Not on there Groudon=Genjiro

Ok I fixed it
I should've made Chris a mega red gyrados possibly.
I did make tsubasa two pokemon
I guess I was trying to poke fun at all the characters. Hoping they'd all be self explanatory, but there's so much to work with. It would be more fun to make them trainers and try to give them a team that fits them.
I didn't think of that. That's hillarious. I actually was just focusing on her overall elegance.
I was too lazy to look for Kanade and Serena because they havin't appeared alive in show. If I did an XDU one I would've.
I couldn't unsee it when someone said Hibiki looked like pikachu then I saw them all.

Omg she was halfed! I couldn't tell because it went by so fast.
Like they took symetrical docking and made more of it somehow XD
I noticed that about symphogear though. It feels like a symphogear thing to take something that happens one season and double it the next. S2 felt like S1x2
Oh I thought frontier was on the moon
Oh god XD
I had no idea who that was
Oh that makes sense
I remember a scene with a dude dying on the moon.
I guess the next thing borthering me is...are there people on the moon? Does Shemha want to kill them?
That makes way more sense
He must've known longer than when SONG got taken over then. So then the scene with Milarc was just trolling us.
It amazes me that Fudo knew exactly how Miku works. He gave her a faust robe of shenshoujin. That's like omg he did his research. They came up with that on the fly too because Milarc was going to take out Miku. It almost seems kind of stupid. What was his plan before Miku? How did he get the faust robe? How did he decide he needs to control God to protect Japan? What is this guy thinking? If he was that power he could've potentially stopped Fine?
Worst Dad is still alive XD
That's sad :( It's interesting the paralells the characters have to actual voice actors now. Here I thought Cagli being a guy IRL was mind blowing. I'd still perfer Tsubasa have a dad though tbh.
I had no idea. Thank you I love the VAs but I don't know a lot about them.
OMG!!!
Oh how so? I don't know a lot about Nana
Tsubasa really needed a real dad besides Genjiro so that left a bad taste in my mouth. She's supposed to become a Nana Mitsuki as an adult and her dad was supposed to attend her concerts. Or at least that's my selfish ending
The man is a saint
Was it worth it for Genjiro to hold back? Knowing that both his brother and Niece's lives were at risk as welll as all his own men?
I feel like they will come back. They faked the deaths in AXZ If they are monsters can they heal themselves?
Maybe Fudo had the Ultimate Forsighting for this show
I can't blame her though. She was being manipulated by Fudo since her very conception. Kanade was the only friend she made who was part of her world at one point.
For Jam?
Shemha is threatening because she's not afraid to break the rules of symphogear. Hibiki has to hold hands with that.
Where is all the blood in Vanessa's body. Is it just in her head!?
Vanessa carrying her head around like Celty from Durararara would be kind of creepy XD
I felt bad for Elsa though. I really liked her character design.
I'm just saying that because I want Fine to come back and more amalgam and moon stuff with GODS.
Even though this season is so HYPE it feels like it could've easily been more episodes. It almost feels like too much.
No she can't. It's not fair because she was supposed to progress after the Kanade thing. Now this..... poor Tsubasa
She's the Purple Ranger because any other colour would be stupid at this point
I played XDU and it feels very established that Shenshoujin is Miku's.
I'm hoping Miku gets seperated from Shemha somehow. In a final battle against some other bigger enemy so that she can battle with the gears and carol in Xdrive style faust robes. I'm not asking for much.
That makes sense because in the XDU all the Tigar images in her attacks
Hibiki gets a stand because she's a Jojo paraody. Chris is a Gundam, and Tsubasa is a Samurai so she's really only destined for pain.
XD when you think about it wanting a female heir makes no sense unless she's gonna become a magical girl!
Awwwe XD I didn't do that one either
Oh that's where those Exclusive songs come from
That's not a bad story so far....
Too late XD thank you for the advice though :) I also got frusterated because I couldn't figure out how to Level 70 them.
What was the sun event in a nutshell?
My account got deleted so I decided to just stop playing
I might be baised because I pulled them all at the time.
Oh damn but wasn't the water park even with the alcamists kind of ok?
Well isn't XDU basically just travel to a paralell world fight karma noise meet up with dead friends/family and transform gears to suit situation?
At the same time I can see why
That's pretty harsh
NANDATTO!!!
OMG XD here I played like three events and was like it's not that bad. I can believe it was that bad tbh
XD After playing XDU I can totally believe that
That story was that terrible but so cute at the same time. When I played the Alchemist trio waterpark event I thought oh damn this is too cute.
Yeah but I never got it
I thought about wanting to post videos with subs but the problem is that I don't gets the Japanese memes well enough to translate them.
We should put english subs to be fair. If everyone can't enjoy it what's the point
Just reroll for Madoka XD
Actually yes if you like madoka Magia Record is worth a play
That's true the Story in Magia Record was better but I like the gameplay of XDU more
XDU is cute and fun though.
Out of the two games I liked symphogear more
I noticed that for Madoka they are extending the series with the Mobile Game so it's not really a stretch for symphogear.
That HAIR though! Has anyone talked about how Tsubasa got her gorgeous hair from Fudo. Other than Tsubasa Herself that's the only nice thing he gave her besides her "brothers" XD
I should just save my questions for the XDU chat instead.
Thank you for telling me the story behind it though. I loved the artwork for it.
The only problem I had with it was I couldn't get the items I needed to bring it to level 70. At the same time I never completed all the main quests because I lost everything.
That's really cool because I didn't know what the story was behind it. I was just glad I had it
It was my best gear and it cost like 90 to use
Ok I think I might've rolled the Sungear
Basa's had enough (>_<)
I found Yatsuhiro's death pretty tragic esspecially after the second episode.
Is Genjiro going to die? (O_o)
It feels TOO obvious to kill off Miku unless she's already dead?
Oh :/
Miku Miku Miku.....Hibiki could be the one who actually Dies last ep? They trolled us with S1 what if it's finally time!? :/
Idk If I were in the show I'd be a little interested in breaking the curse too. Just to see if it did bring world peace.
That's bad
All humans being psychic with a mutual understanding?
Is destroying the curse a bad thing?
Can Alchemy restore Nobel Red's bodies?
I was all excited to see the rocket go to the moon. At the end of the episode I was like "yay we still made it there!" XD
That makes more sense. I do have a feeling they might stop shem ha and release the curse.
XD not orange tang what if everyone just have a loving understanding of one another and they build a paradise without need technology like cellphones to communicate.
Is this a thing where the curse allowed humans to exist with seperate egos instead of exist as a hive mind?
Millarc is Vampire I wonder if her body biologically makes her act violently? Like how a lion craves food? Does she have to surpress the desire to eat humans or something 24/7 to keep herself sane?
That was cute XD
They could start an idol group and pretend that thier bodies are cosplay outfits to hide their real identities. That they stay in stage outfits 24/7 XD
Having monster bodies really messed them up psychologically. They identify with them too much.
I feel pretty bad for NR
Fine saved Shirabe
Oh God they were really trying to connect her to her VA
That's not true what if her song was to save him?
When they were carrying Tsubasa's dad I was hoping he'd survive. They should've put him in a coma clinging to life or something because Tsubasa's lost way too much. For me that was over kill. It wasn't character development it was pure victimhood.
Not frontier Carol's House XD
Didn't Dr. Ver sacrifice himself in frontier?
Oh God I just envisioned "scissors of love in a dream" in XDU That would actually need it's own card.
XD
How are they gonna incorporate amalgam into XDU <:MariaShock:423196877354303498>
How come no one seems to have noticed that the giant white rose fisting could replace white lilies on the bingo board? Unless they are waiting and saving it for the last symphocast?
Does anyone know where I can listen to the Aufwachen Form of Metanoia?
Everyone's hair caught on fire upon re~entry and now it won't stop burning because Magic. <:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
omg (T_T)
I didn't get enough moon, but re~entry made up for it
That would be fun to read XD practice some japanese
Are those the scripts?
Omg this place is so dangerous
Was Shemha a custodian? I thought there were multiple.
EVERYONE Was there XD
We'd of had a kiss under different circumstances
That's true
same
That ending was in the closet meanwhile the episode was so out of the closet XD
They were protecting us from the posibility
The closet ending
It needed more fan service in the credits
XD
That felt incredibly gay. I loved it
Why did they introduce Ogawa's family when they practically did nothing?
<@239893407122718721> It's so true XD
One OVA that's high quality with great fan service. Just one plz XD
Oh that makes perfect sense
I wanted a time skip too
That would be nice XD
Is anime over now?
Hibiki hugging miku looks like a phenoix
Chris got a stand XD
hard not to when you have Aoi being MC
I perfer this to the Madoka ending
The reason miku said yes to Shemha <3

Wait that was supposed to heal her from the fusing? I read on the wiki it was to fix boob pain.
Oh dear god that Chris's boobs gave her back pain she needed shock therapy for
She can probably handle it.
XD
If you want to be able to show non anine fans symphogear
That's the one scene that really shouldn't be in there XD
I guess I could FF past that scene
True but that scene made me go OMG
12 Forever was nightmare fuel to me
Some of the cartoons she watches I find to be nightmare fuel.
She's seen pri para
Yeah they went there in mlpfim though 
 I could picture her enjoying mob psycho 100. She loves My Hero Academia. Stuff like Eva and psycho pass she'd hate.
And saw the new Steven Universe movie
I want to stay away from too much violence and sexual related content in a show. She just finished the last ep of MLPFIM
Is Granblem any good? What's the age rating? I don't want to show Symphogear to my little sister because of the scene with Chris and Fine.
I hadn't read the manga before. The artwork seems to show more skin than the show XD It feels even more fan servicing to me somehow.
It's still hilariously fascinating to me that they still included it and tried to justify it XD
I'm only fascinated by this because it's so hilarious
Is that in the manga?
According to the bonus page of volume 2 of the manga, Finé would torture Chris with a low current to "cure" her shoulder pains caused by her large breasts.
Omg this is on the wiki under fine
Hahaha XD
Dear God there was a legit reason. Why did they not make that more clear in the show. It almost gets away with the bdsm scene.
Last time it said it was caused by her boobs being too big. I guess I was wrong (>_<) tbh I kind of wanted to believe it was caused by boob pain that's much more believable XD
OMG THEY CHANGED IT XD
"Both the manga and anime keywords state that Chris was also tortured to removed the Nehushtan's corrosion from her body to stop her fusing with the relic like Hibiki and later Finé herself. The keywords state that Finé chose electrocution specifically because of her sadism and belief that "pain is the only thing that connects the hearts of people".
I have to run it by our mother who's really strict towards my sister. Apparently, it's a No.
Flip Flappers is adorable! I think I can show that one to my sister  XD <:KirikaMegane:585848185847676939>
Kanade reminds me of Padparadscha from Houseki no Kuni XD
You just need a red shirt, white tie and amazing voice XD
<:HibikiWow:614268629952757760>
<@189146272865845248> I don't blame you for feeling that way tbh. I'd still enjoy your cosplay though. I actually lost some weight myself recently. Eating vegan made my tummy effortlessly go flat. It's just not "FIT" It needs muscle tone but it is flat. I feel like I could wear a cosplay but I don't like to cosplay Alone. That's my thing I prefer to cosplay with people. Or for someone. I don't mind someone asking me to cosplay a character they like. It just feels really boring cosplaying by yourself.
<@302063351767498752> That'd be cool :)
<@98541382393688064> I would love to see that XD I havin't seen that done yet.
How do people on here feel about Cosplayers? I personally love seeing symphogear cosplays especially if they are really well done. Does anyone on here cosplay or want to cosplay a symphogear character? That would be cool to see. I've thought about it myself but I'm on the fence about cosplaying. I'm female like the characters but if I were a dude I'd consider a gender bent character.
