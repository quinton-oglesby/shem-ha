before last week i was in FFXIV for like 3 months tho
thats why im playing wow atm :v
yes
usually whenever wow runs out of content
i play it on and off
i have all classes at max level <:feelscry:472970891953831936>

yeah it was realllly boring
i played wildstar for like 3 hours and hated every second of it so i didnt keep playing :v
but never kept up with it
i played GW2 way back when it first came out
ooh
is that wildstar
i get to roleplay as a cute girl because the IRL character creator was not so kind <:feelsbadman:426138552653316128>
but yeah glamour is the true end game
lmao
i was trying to make a best girl miku glam for a while but couldnt get it quite right
i have a hibiki-inspired MNK glam
i'd show more of mine but i cba to dig through my folder for my recent ones :v
SMN is a class i still cant figure out a glam for
oh thats cute
i spend hours making new glams
glamour is like the main reason i even play the game tbh
yeah
i prefer playing healers in mmos so getting to top dps charts while healing was great for me :v
that was what made it fun
