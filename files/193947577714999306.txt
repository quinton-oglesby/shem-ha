thank you i love serena with shades

and yeah lol
fate/cero i kind of question...some of their choice of words...lol
also i like the abridged series, even if it's just retelling, i personally just like it cause it cuts away from how i felt like it dragged out scenes in the original while in the least being mildly amusing about it
more like *mostly* fate
where does fgo learning with manga animation stand then? ðŸ¤”

Oki
God, i still feel torn up when i remember Chikage got Taisha'd after going mad
Lmaoooo
hello i heard someone say yuuki yuuna?
*rises from the depths*


someone mention yuuki yuuna in here?
:karinpeek:
Lmao
spoiler thing for yuuki yuuna ||and about the reverse clapping thing||

and more light novel spoilers: ||chikage lost her powers the moment she started attacking wakaba||
and it's briefly explained in s2 why tougou doesn't just, get her powers taken away after the incident
yes the tree can but that's ||nowayu light novel spoilers||
you watch the entire second season on youtube cause someone uploaded proper subs on there <:TsubasaSmug:585839805737467920>
is it really unbelievable though?
hell yeah she was
"togo was gay even before she met yuna tbh"
she lost her arm ||just like Gin did||
the scene that made me sob like a bitch
*that scene*
ah yes
as i need to remember some details
i need to reread the novel before i go back to writing my fic though <:TsubasaDisgust:349013662775902209>
I have very thorough knowledge of the series <:KirikaSmug:607742561414676517>

||then again, that  kind of prevention is kind of inconsistent considered what tougou is doing||
||oh i forgot about that||
yes there's a manga version but it skims over alot of things
nowayu, the prequel
i thought the prevention was just them prevented from dying
Kancolle has perma death
that's basically Kancolle
and Tougou got the SSR
yeah mankai it's a gacha of suffering
Nogi got lucky
and then it'll reach the point where she's barely even a person anymore
she thinks they're fighting a losing battle and ||all they have to show for it is a permanently bedridden girl who didn't ask for any of this, lost memories, a dead friend, and a new group of friends all progressively losing themselves until they have nothing to offer anymore||
||Sonoko has no heartbeat||
||do you want her to end up like Sonoko?||
yeah they are supplemented in mankai form
:)
:)))
:)
isn't that just ||akamine yuuna then?||
here it is

oh wait i have it somewhere
and then you'll eventually know why it's not very well known in yuyuyu <:CarolSmug:617040484111745027>
i like this face alot

||one is also erased from history||
||all but one yuusha dies horribly and the last one is the sole survivor and the ancestor of Sonoko||
a very heavy spoiler
like
do you want a spoiler then?
i have the pdf if you want it
well, that and some crazy stuff that happens to the first heroes
and if you think wasuyu was dark, nowayu is even darker
Nowayu light novel is takes place when the vertex first attacks mankind, and the story of the first heroes. It also sets up the foundations of some things and some key points that are important later down the line for rest of the series.
Just dropping this here for anyone who wants to add me
