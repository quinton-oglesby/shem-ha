Hold up gotta bring back a classic HibiHibi
Found this
This one too
Before I go digging, might as well share this ignited Kanade
Lemme see
<:hmmm:753004413018308668>
Do you mean like her purple gear in XDU or just art that features her gear as if it upgraded and evolved like the others did each season

<:TsubasaJoy:688191716620238870>
Probably my favorite. Either this or the Saber one.



Oh I love that artist
<:KirikaPog:605209108827734017>

Other than XDU ignited Miku
Didn't find anything
<:MikuCry:688397678584791074>
Lemme see if I can find non ignited upgraded Shenshoujing




Oh yeah the plot doesn't really kick into full throttle until the halfway point from what I remember
I wasn't a fan of all the fanservice but I enjoyed the characters too much to stop watching
Oh damn. Dropped KLK huh. <:MikuCry:688397678584791074>

Yeah I think that's all I got in terms of slightly edgy Gear art. Don't really save that kinda stuff too often. There's probably more buried deep

Too bad I don't find too much Tsubasa x Shirabe art

<:ahh:821820218581712947>
Grocery store seems more stressful, at least as a cashier, having a never ending line all day
Then people see $108 go down to $103 and ask where the discount is
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
Which is usually equivalent to the amount of points you would get, unless there's a VIP promotion going on
We do give a 5% discount for the VIP membership tho
<:HibikiFingerguns:688429715836502063>
Which leads to many annoyed customers
My store's main differences are not being able process returns for items not bought in-store, we are not able to give VIP points, and we cannot process Lego gift cards.

Hasn't changed anything yet

Yeah I keep hearing Merlin is owned by Lego now

Yeah
I prefer that over the studio version
Love in EP one of GX when Hibiki screams "HIKARI AREEEEEE" as she suplexes the ship
G episode 10 <:ChrisPray:672578403156885504>
That's probably my favorite episode of Gear
HIBIKE
Live
Love the struggle and passion in Hibiki's voice
Yeah
I know exactly what you mean
Yes
Everything
Even the b side songs
I love G's soundtrack
Yesss
I don't play it as often
Synchrogazer feels iconic every time I hear it now
Sakura <:HibikiGay:670494484701773845>
Also I would rewatch each season at least once and listen to it's soundtrack thoroughly before moving on to the next
I just wanted the enjoyment I had with the series last longer
:0
Lol
Same
Didn't get to XV until last month actually
I was introduced to Gear in like October, watched EP 1 in December iirc, kinda forgot about it, then I think I finished season 1 in Jan or Feb
Oh you found Gear in January?
Hmm I think the first seasonal i kept up with was Wonder Egg Priority
Well I started watching the popular shounens back in middle school, but I didn't really get into other anime until late highschool/early college
Me too
https://tenor.com/view/saul-better-call-saul-call-saul-he-didnt-call-saul-wheelchair-saul-gif-25782666
I used to wait for seasonals to end so I could binge them, but then I would lose interest in them after they aired. So Im forcing myself to watch it weekly.
Hoping they can end it with a bang
Well I like it so far. I have to watch the latest ep.
<:MikuSad:336657015961026560>

Best Girl of Type-Moon


Well I'd say start with Kara no Kyoukai
<:Unravel:752997011522846892>
<@575135735599071232> Are u a fan of Tsukihime and Kara no Kyoukai?


Ok I don't think it plays fully in the CD version, but I do prefer her acapella intro. Both sound cool tho
It's not playing for some reason tho <:TsubasaIgnite:672861877407318047>
I have the song on my phone
Maybe I didn't hear it
That might be in the background of her acapella intro
Wait i might be wrong
The beginning was not included
https://youtu.be/QwY1VuT-sgc
Also this
Yeah that part sounds dope
Shows how much she loves to voice Hibiki
Like as she's singing
Yeah
Like she'll add in some crazy Bikki screams

That would be crazy
Hmm wouldn't an ||actual heart transplant|| be better tho. That would be really hard to find tho. Imagine||Takina gets fatally wounded and gives her heart to Chisato.||
If they do choose to end it like that, ||I think I would be satisfied if she at least enjoys her last moments. Then there would definitely be no season 2. Of course it would be better if they find her a new heart.||
Didn't expect it to get this sad <:ShirabeCry:671887081026617345>

<:HibikiSad:738234648509022368>
https://twitter.com/SymphogearGIFs/status/1594159727591686144
And also Mahoyo
I need to read Kagetsu Tohya
<a:ChrisShifty:744677308631089162>
<:MikuDelete:661660028410920990>
True
But I enjoyed the manga anyway. Probably my favorite manga that I've read.
Thank you. Actually I got a new PC since then and I haven't even tried it on here yet.
Crash upon startup
I honestly don't remember. I probably did. But I also had the same problem with Melty Blood AACC on Steam
Like it crashed upon startup every time
Hm my PC wouldn't let the VN run so I read the manga
<:MikuPraise:585839808765493249>
Anyone here ever watch Kara no Kyoukai or read Tsukihime (manga/original VN)
Bruh
<a:ChrisShifty:744677308631089162>
I enjoyed watching Saber Alter more than the original Saber
<:MikuPraise:585839808765493249>
Bruh I see an H and instantly think HF
<:HibikiLaugh:963908260811898940>
I see
Hollow Ataraxia
Ohhhhh
Bruh
The films are probably my favorite piece of Fate
The VN route? Or the films
Movie too <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
yess
New Trigun?
Wait what
Maybe I will after reading. I cry pretty easily
Anyone read that new Chainsaw Man chapter
Bruh

<:KirikaPog:605209108827734017>
Just watched the first 2 eps of Lycoris Recoil before work. I like what I see so far.
Left off at Neko and then I got distracted by other series and Symphogear. Well Symphogear was a good distraction.
AHHHHH I need to pick Monogatari back up
<:TsubasaPeek:623246193002151938>
Has me anxious
New CSM chapter was good
I can respect that opinion. <:KirikaSalute:620069889838809089>
ALSO ARARAGI
https://tenor.com/view/mayoi-hachikuji-kiss-monogatari-koyomi-araragi-kick-gif-21187012
Just finished Dynazenon. Better than Gridman in most aspects imo. I enjoyed it a lot.
Damn I first discovered Dashie back when he made skits. I was in like 5th grade probably. Too bad he stopped making them regularly. Crazy it's been like a decade
They want us to learn Japanese
Nice to hear Aoi Yuuki too
Youjo Senki is better than I expected so far
https://tenor.com/view/lycoris-recoil-chisato-nishikigi-gif-26283708
Oh
You don't have any spare headphones?
Hmm if I had to rank the seasons, it'd probably go G>AXZ or XV>S1>GX. AXZ and XV could be switched. Can't decide which I like better. I can understand why yall would rank AXZ lower.
All I can say is what the fuck
Just read Sayonara Eri
Learn Japanese
Mind explaining this? Is it a game collab?
<:HibikiFingerguns:688429715836502063>

Cool
Bruh
Does anyone here read Chainsaw Man?

Bruh

<a:HibikiPowerDab:688190074219003996>
New CSM PV??
Oh
Manga?
Oh yeah I was looking at those
<:hmmm:753004413018308668>
Just wanted to get a feel for the franchise
Yeah
Tbh I haven't actually watched any Gundam series yet. Not entirely sure where I should start. I definitely want to watch at least a few before G Witch airs. Don't really have much time to finish all of the UC timeline. I'm a pretty slow watcher. I was thinking starting with IBO or 00. Idk tho.
Hmm I just watched the G-Witch Prologue and I like it a lot so far. Can't wait to watch the anime in the fall.
https://tenor.com/view/laugh-blush-kyouko-toshinou-yuru-yuri-gif-5593668

Wait is this Chisato? Why are her hair and eye colors different? Unless that's just for the Light Novel illustration and doesn't mean anything for the story.
It's my favorite Shounen. Love all the characters. Feel like no character is wasted. It's not just the main characters saving the day. Everyone plays their part.
I love it. Currently caught up with part 2. Make sure u don't get spoiled
https://tenor.com/view/red-gif-20768550

Hmm yeah 97 chapts. Guess I like to take my time with stuff. I read like 1-2 volumes a day. I see you like Reze <:ChrisRead:688429724334161987>

Bruh
You already finished??
Wait hold up
I have the anime stalled on like EP 6 for months
I should finish the anime and read the manga
:0
No wonder it was bootleg quality when I watched it
I didn't realize it wasn't globally released yet
Bruh
Happens when i try to keep up with seasonals. Unless they really have me hooked, like LycoReco.
I'd be unreliable at watching like that. I'd probably forget to watch or lose interest from not watching at least like 6 eps a day.
I see
Thought u started a while back ngl
Oh bruh
What episode are u on
https://tenor.com/view/evangelion-eva-rei-ayanami-congrats-congratulations-gif-25137905
<a:ChisatoDrive:998524286149066792>
Pretty crazy stuff
Finished Youjo Senki season 1
It had been a long time since I last heard Platinum Disco. Probably like over a year. So it played on AMQ and I completely forgot that Yuka Iguchi voices Tsukihi. So now I can't unhear Miku's voice in the song.
Everyone using a pistol lol
Didn't think about that tbh
That's about it
From funny YouTube clips
I know of Yuyushiki
The fantranslation ain't so bad tho
Too bad the English publisher went bankrupt like halfway through
Probably my favorite manga of all time
If you're an Arcueid fan
Tsukihime manga is great
Like they don't wanna be alone but they don't know how to convey it
2 ppl struggling to figure out how to socialize with each other
I love the interactions between Shinji and Asuka
I figured
<:KirikaDess:1015095623176966184>
What did it adapt? A light novel?
https://tenor.com/view/neco-arc-acrued-brunestud-arcueid-neco-neco-arc-micsmod-gif-25309281

If u ever wanna play tho @ me

Nah ur probably better than me

https://tenor.com/view/necoarc-melty-blood-type-lumina-melty-blood-type-lumina-nekoarc-gif-26524234
I play it from time to time. I'm not that good tho.
Ah ok
U play Melty Blood?
Yeah
Kagetsu Tohya
And uh
Gotta read that and Mahoyo
That's cool
Oh shit
It was cool watching Kara no Kyoukai before Fate and seeing ||Touko|| at the end of HF III and her having a part in ||Shirou's|| ending
Lol
Well good enough for me
Oh
Uh Tsuki no Sango is also in the Nasuverse iirc
I have more interest in the other parts of the Nasuverse tbh. Tsukihime, Kara no Kyoukai, Mahoyo, etc.
I've only got F/Z and HF under my belt rn. Weird combo to start with I know.
Just to consume everything Fate
I'm probably still gonna watch eventually

Yes I love it. Finished season 1 this morning btw. And uh ep 7 definitely made me sad. Reminded me of ||Chris and Finé||. But then it also introduced us to the ||Time-Space Administrative Bureau|| so the world building is just getting started. My favorite scene in season 1 is ||Fate deciding to live freely for herself as "Take a Shot" starts playing. Then she repairs Bardiche and comes to Nanoha's aid.|| Had me crying a bit more than I expected lol.

Got quite a bit to get through
https://tenor.com/view/pepe-gif-10374658

Gotta find the graphic I was following
Uh I forgor the exact watch order I was following but I think I had to watch Hanamonogatari next.
I wanna pick it back up soon tho
I'm a poser <:Chrisrember:1015095109932560404>
Tbh I have no business talking about favorite arcs yet. I haven't even finished the series yet <:MikuLaugh:688429715676987428>. I stalled like over a year ago. Maybe 2. I was like halfway through.
👍
Could happen. Seemed to be a past history to explore|| between the LilyBells and the Lycoris based on the look that one guy gave Chisato||
Lol

There was this show called The Loud House that had 2 gay dads and their adoptive son
Memories do be getting intertwined like that <:ElfneinDrowning:336656417035517952>
iirc
There's a kiss like in the next frame in the comic that continues it lol
<:KirikaDisgust:688431636043268097>
Adventure Time or Korra

I think LycoReco got this tho
There's always a fear in me that a series can be ruined instantly by a bad ending

https://tenor.com/view/pepe-sad-pepe-crying-pepe-the-pepe-gif-21617046
Just finished Edgerunners
Ok. Yeah I heard they're an au?
I'm going to stick with the TV series but I will probably rewatch the series in movie format eventually
Goosebumps
Just watched Nanoha A's EP 1 before work. I was limited to watching on my phone, but ||Fate's entrance|| was still hype as Hell

Well then my favorite is Takis
Bruh cheese
<:ShirabeCry:671887081026617345>
I didn't even consider this as an outcome until now
https://tenor.com/view/thank-you-laughing-dance-happy-turn-gif-15130805
Yeah it looked really bad <:Chrisrember:1015095109932560404>
The only reason I stick with TV versions of anime most of the time is because I enjoy watching and listening to the ops and eds every ep
<:ShirabeShock:744441685324595231>
Bruh
https://tenor.com/view/anime-noted-gif-20648403
?
So it's like an alternate universe
Bruh
<:KirikaDisgust:688431636043268097>
So you gotta watch the compilation movie if u wanna watch the sequel movie
Uh
A lot of Macross's out here <:ShirabeShock:744441685324595231>
Or can Delta be watched on it's own
What is the watch order for if i want to watch Macross Delta? Do I have to watch the original series or Frontier?
I haven't watched since season 4 aired
Does she wear clothes now
What
Well those look like moons lol
*When the stars became music...*
<:ShirabeFear:696380146248319066>
So are you saying that the first cour is going to have issues?
https://tenor.com/view/looney-tunes-quarantine-sleeping-sleeping-beauty-beauty-sleep-gif-16980796
Watching Demon Slayer?
<:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
Oh so it will still be airing Sunday tho right
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
<:Chrisrember:1015095109932560404>
And I watched Naruto from start to finish
I didn't know Nana Mizuki was the voice of Hinata until like last week
You know what's crazy
Idk if watching EoE right away was a good choice on my part. Guess I was desperate looking for a more concrete ending. It was like my first time watching a show where the ending is up to self interpretation. <:MikuLaugh:688429715676987428>
👀
Always liked this one

I hope u get to Dynazenon at some point. I liked it way more than Gridman.
<:Chrisrember:1015095109932560404>
Yeah I think Anno said something along the lines of he "forgot about her"
<:ShirabeShock:744441685324595231>
So the Aerial unit is sentient?
<:ShirabeCry:671887081026617345>
Gotta wait until after work and HW <:Unravel:752997011522846892>
Just finished the ep
<:haha:751477218286239876>
Brings back the pain every time I listen to Let You Down
<:Chrisrember:1015095109932560404>
There are some decent filler arcs tho. Mainly flashback arcs for characters like Kakashi and Itachi, as well as filler arcs that adapt light novels.
I watched it in highschool but I skipped most of the filler
Like 200+ eps iirc
Did u watch Shippuden too?
https://tenor.com/view/boruto-crying-gif-25520175

https://tenor.com/view/chris-pratt-andy-dwyer-jimmy-kimmel-interview-excited-gif-22198805
Really liking A's btw. So far, it feels like a huge step up from season 1.
Damn I gotta watch Mob Psycho 100 II soon so I can watch season 3. That will definitely be next
<:ShirabeShock:744441685324595231>
Should be finished by tonight
Right now I'm watching Nanoha A's
I have a ptw but I don't think I've watched much on it at all other than sequels. I'll find a series that isn't even on it and watch that instead.
Uh I didn't get too far tbh. One of the few series I lost interest in.
<:KirikaDisgust:688431636043268097>
Btw I don't recommend Penguindrum
All bangers <:ChrisDJ:690470897194369034>
She sings the ED for Space Dandy and the OPs for this anime called Mawaru Penguindrum
I love the artist for that ED
True
Oh i forgot Trigger's 10 year anniversary was like last year
Since the same team worked on it iirc

A part of me wants to watch it, but I don't like wasting my time with stuff I probably won't like
I heard it was shit
So u enjoyed it huh?
<:TsubasaNote:689554460044820608>
Hm interesting
At first glance
I know of T&B but I've never watched it. Kinda reminds me of Samurai Flamenco

Tensura 2 part 2

Hm I don't like watching Youtube videos on Eva
2.0/2.22 is probably my favorite piece of EVA
Haven't been in the mood
I still need to watch 3.0 and Thrice Upon a Time
Well it's one End to Eva
<:ShirabeMad:688188118087499792>
Reject Humanity, become Fanta
Wait isn't that Hibike Euphonium in the bottom left? Didn't u say u dropped Eupho
<:TsubasaNote:689554460044820608>
Oh I didn't know the series was ongoing
Actually I technically have a Princess Principal poster, but it's double-sided with Symphogear on the other side lol. Got the Symphogear side up on the wall of course.
Never watched it myself
Princess Principal is one of your favs? Interesting
<:ShirabeShock:744441685324595231>
Well it's been recommended by many. Should've watched it a long time ago tbh.
Oh yeah u told me to watch it but I forgor <:ElsaSick:689395768754569359>
I have not watched that yet
Kimisui huh
Top 11 <:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
I really wanna add Gurren Lagann
Actually
Hmmm
<:TikiPraise:672430544381935625>

Here it is
Didn't think to make a top 10 favorite for my MAL until now
<:HibikiSad:738234648509022368>
I see
Oh
<:TsubasaNote:689554460044820608>
Mainly because of Gen Urobuchi and my love for Meguca
I've never watched any Kamen Rider tbh but I enjoy Fuuto Pi. A friend recommended I check out Kamen Rider Gaim.
Also that new op goes hard <:ChrisDJ:690470897194369034>
<:MikuLaugh:688429715676987428>
Anyone else watch Mob III ep 1? Reigen had me dying
Bruh
wtf
<:ElsaWhat:689195325621141505>
Oh I often spot Anima in Barnes and Noble. Intrigued me but I never attempted to read.
lmao
I love using this gif
Oh
It's like a rom com manga. At least from what I read up to.
What
Oh lmao
Have yall read the "Shinji Ikari Raising Project" manga
Best part for me is the very beginnning tho when she's staring at the stars
The op is so good
I watched ep 2 about an hour ago
https://tenor.com/view/shocked-face-surprised-wee-bey-the-wire-revelation-gif-23831754
I'm caught up with the manga and it's become one of my favorites. It's a little over hyped but Fujimoto's storytelling is definitely worth it. Very wacky but also pretty dark. EP 1 was great.
And Ringo was annoying
Kinda lost interest
I never finished Penguindrum
https://tenor.com/view/ghost-stories-dub-gif-20485951
Like live action
The opening for season 2 is literally a Kamen Rider op and it has Shouta Aoi in it
They change the art style sometimes for different parodies
Lmao
A pleasant suprise <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
I didn't know ed 2 was gonna be Zutomayo
Time to get some tickets
Bruh

Because they still look like kids on the covers
So Detonation and reflection take place in an alternate timeline right? Are they in a similar time period as Strikers?
<:KirikaDisgust:688431636043268097>
I rarely watch anything over 12 eps these days because slow pacing bores me easily
Oh
<:Chrisrember:1015095109932560404>
Yeah I saw
They're part of an agency that stops crime before the public becomes aware of it
Lycoris Recoil?
The series is finished ?
I wanna start it soon
I need to start Strikers
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
lol
<:ShirabeShock:744441685324595231>
And a bunch of group projects for college on top of that <:ShirabeCry:671887081026617345>
<:HibikiSad:738234648509022368>
Yeah rn I'm trying to stay caught up on seasonals, as well as continuing my Monogatari watch through. Probably won't get to StikerS for a while.
Oh so u haven't seen Nanoha Vivid either
<:ShirabeShock:744441685324595231>
<@127848372131463168> Thoughts on Vivid Strike compared to the main series?
Jk i need to watch Vivid Strike
<:KirikaDisgust:688431636043268097>
<:ElsaSmug:688429724443213903>
https://tenor.com/view/nanoha-fate-fate-testarossa-movie2nd-gif-17837658
And Bardiche lol
Hmmmmmmm so far probably Fate
Btw I just posted some Nanoha fanart in <#336297674707828747> <:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
<:Chrisrember:1015095109932560404>
I see
Oh ok
Just to confirm, those 2 movies are part of an alternate timeline right? Like they won't lead into Strikers at all
Bruh
Hm I don't exactly remember ep 8,  but after reading the summary, I wonder where the novels go from there
https://tenor.com/view/akane-shinj%C5%8D-shinjou-akane-kick-anime-cute-gif-16341276
<:ChrisWTF:987187615289720832>
Being a ||devil||, she doesn't understand the concept of ||hygiene|| lol
<:haha:751477218286239876>
<:haha:751477218286239876>
Been listening to that on repeat since I watched EP 4
Think the mangaka said something about creating a spin off to fill some holes
👌
Can't click that yet
<:ChrisWTF:987187615289720832>
Idk who you're talking about but you have me nervous
Bruh
Ah
Bed at 6am
Damn
Can't wait to see what he has to say
<:ShirabeShock:744441685324595231>
<:HibikiSad:738234648509022368>
Bruh
Has all of the ppl she wrote letters for in the anime
Oh shit this is pretty cool
🥹


That's the soldier from one episode of the anime I'm pretty sure
Lol yeah no
Or u just don't remember
Oh you didn't watch?
Bruh
That ep probably hit me the hardest. Idk why.
Wait is that the soldier ||that she couldn't save in time <:Unravel:752997011522846892> ||?
Bruh. It didn't even cross my mind before and while watching that the Violet Evergarden Auto Memory Doll movie could be Yuri. I guess because of knowing how Violet is and also having not seen any Yuri at the time.
<:HibikiSad:738234648509022368>
<:Chrisrember:1015095109932560404>
<:MikuCry:688397678584791074>
Latest episode of Mob had me in tears
I was obsessed with the DC animated universe back in middle school. Watched through Batman TAS, Batman Beyond, Justice League, and all the other animated films Kevin played in. The Batman Arkham series was also my favorite game series at that time. Kevin Conroy will always be my favorite Batman. <:MikuCry:688397678584791074>
Hm looking through some of my 10/10's, we got Symphogear G, Madoka, Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood, Black Lagoon Second Barrage, Evangelion 2.0, Kara no Kyoukai 5, Violet Evergarden, Fate/Stay Night Heavens Feel III, Mob Psycho 100 II
I couldn't get through like 5 eps of that
<:HibikiLaugh:963908260811898940>
Wtf
Definitely my favorite part of the op
https://tenor.com/view/lycoris-recoil-takina-inoue-chisato-nishikigi-lycoris-recoil-op-gif-26173800
Wait I didn't watch Fairy Tail
Fire Force is probably the only big name Shounen I haven't watched other than One Piece
Bruh
<:ShirabeCry:671887081026617345>

Bloody faced Takina had me in tears
<:Unravel:752997011522846892>
<:TsubasaAngry:692141154531016765>
Low-key only watched for Hideri, and he doesn't even appear until like the second half
I thought it was average. The comedy was decent. I despised how they kept trying to push the relationship between the owner and Maika. It made me really uncomfortable.
<:ShirabeCry:671887081026617345>
Probably until sundown <:HibikiSad:738234648509022368>
I wonder how long she waited for him
<:Unravel:752997011522846892>

<:Chrisrember:1015095109932560404>
Dumb question i know
I will probably read the translated novel soon. However, I saw they made it into an audio drama recently? Anyone know if that is subbed anywhere?
Besides the recap
6 is the latest ep right?
<:Unravel:752997011522846892>
Based on what we have so far
I feel some heavy plot twists and deaths are bound to happen
Well I mean while watching G-Witch in general
Bruh I'm terrified
<:Chrisrember:1015095109932560404>
<:haha:751477218286239876>
Dyna is so good
Please watch before the movie comes out 🙏
Or they have accelerated aging
Gridman timeline has me so confused lol. My only explanation is that Gridknight and The 2nd are time travelers <:haha:751477218286239876>
Pig tails Chise <:MikuBliss:336657233712513024>
Does anyone here read Undead Unluck? I feel like I've found a hidden gem in terms of Shounen manga
<:Chrisrember:1015095109932560404>
Ok nah y'all definitely discusssing something else
Nana is still ongoing??
Huh
Understood
🥹 👍
https://tenor.com/view/non-non-biyori-renge-miyauchi-noo-gif-22315075
Yeah
I guess the obvious one ||RyouxKita||
Well
Me either
lol
||I could see Kita seeing Bocchi's skills as motivation to get better||
<:NijikaGun:1031459767765434398>
(ep 8)
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tc14WHUoMw
Can't stop watching the solo
<:NijikaGun:1031459767765434398>
Bocchi good
Yeah probably not lol
<:TsubasaNote:689554460044820608>
Seems like it goes to shit after season 1 from what I've seen in here
I wanna watch YuYuYu so bad because it looks really cool but I get less ecstatic to watch it every time yall talk about it
<:ShirabeCry:671887081026617345>
<:ShirabeDone:688198954810474559>
"Kiri-chan, what is a coffin again?"
Can't stand the Crunchy subs
I love those subs
<:haha:751477218286239876>
Are Commie subs the ones with colorful subs for the character songs and ops/eds? And Chris be like "Fuck this shit" in them
But can never decide which
Me too
<:Chrisrember:1015095109932560404>
Here's my list if anyone cares to browse lol 
https://www.anime-planet.com/users/petezc123
Hmmm you've watched less than I thought <:ShirabeShock:744441685324595231>
<:mercurytomato:1026469176379973632>
Yes for my sake please
Probably too short tho
Or movie
Sayonara Eri OVA 👀
I wanted to see her evolve
Yeah I'd rather not experience that same level of cringe
:0
Watched the anime and wanted to read but I kinda forgot about it
I need to read Watamote
Bruh
No love for Gauma
Damn
Symphogear season 1 remake

Fate/Stay Night remake

Tsukihime anime remake that adapts the manga's ending

Fullmetal Alchemist remake that uses the first half of 2003 up until the story splits from the manga and the 2nd half of FMAB

And last choice is kinda hard. I guess I've always wanted to see a future in DBZ where Trunks has no ability to travel back in time, so it's remains a post apocalyptic future with no Dragon Balls. Either that or an adaptation of this fan made manga called Dragon Ball Multiverse.
Definitely my fav op of the season
Yuri Camp
Ah yes

Oh bruh
G Witch is going to have Golf delays in the 2nd cour?
Wooby
Of Nadeko for some reason
Only romance t shirt I have is Monogatari
Bruh
Yeah that mf was annoying
<:haha:751477218286239876>
<:ChrismasRember:1048044815327186964>
It's been a few years since I've watched
Hm so no return of ||kouko|| basically. Leave it up to the viewer for what happens next.
<:haha:751477218286239876>
Oh
Wait what changes would u have made?
Takemiya also wrote Golden Time, which was ok to me.
I have a love/hate relationship with Toradora. Probably more on the love side tho.
Yeah lol
Hm I haven't watched enough romance tbh. My favorite is probably Oregairu tho. My friend who only watches romance for the most part says his favorite is Kimi ni Todoke, which I should get around to soon.
I probably just enjoyed listening to the ops and eds mostly
So I probably will someday
Also makes me wanna continue
Lol
That's exactly why I wanted to watch
My friend swears Oreimo is peak romance tho
I'd stay away from Oreimo tho
I'll say I somewhat enjoyed Eromanga Sensei
<:KirikaDisgust:688431636043268097>
Alright Monogatari is an exception
And then that one stalker girl
Yeah. Why did one of the bros ||kiss his sister|| at the end of one ep? <:haha:751477218286239876>
Oof. Sorry I couldn't enjoy it like you <:ChrismasRember:1048044815327186964> . Maybe I'll pick it back up someday.
The ops are really good tho
I couldn't get past like ep 5
<:KirikaDisgust:688431636043268097>

I'm used to abbreviating like that because of this Discord bot minigame where you guess anime. It only accepts BNHA as an abbreviation so I'm too used to calling it that.

<:ChrisHappy:660870796696223744>
I read Tomo-chan a few years back. Never thought it would get an adaptation.
As you've seen me say many times, Dynazenon <:KirikaSparkle:698939825876631714>
Yeah
Bruh
Oh
I haven't watched SAO past s1 but Alicization looked amazing from what I saw
Indeed
<:ShirabeShock:744441685324595231>
A rare sight
Bruh Boz.o0 in <#371105434771390465>

Unfortunately I don't remember that
<:LuffyDisgust:1048048219470446642>
Didn't it have an ending with a time skip
Bruh
Bofuris nuts
Yeah that was also my only issue with it
https://tenor.com/view/lycoris-recoil-chisato-cope-gif-26310115

Ohhhh shit
https://tenor.com/view/naruto-itachi-sharingan-mangekyo-gif-14774483
Decent dub
I watched that weekly when it aired on Toonami in dub
<:ShirabeShock:744441685324595231>
Lol

That is fine. As long as it's confirmed. <:ElsaSmug:688429724443213903>
<:TsubasaNote:689554460044820608>
:0
And it ain't on that CD iirc
I need a full version of Sick Hack's concert song
Oh
<:KirikaDisgust:688431636043268097>
Bruh
My first watch was on a shitty Discord stream <:Chrisrember:1015095109932560404>
I need to rewatch at some point

<:AkaShrug:425776378135183360>
I think it was originally announced that they wanted to do a 4th movie like 10 years ago. And yeah 2021 was when they gave it a title iirc. Hopefully we get new info soon.
It was amazing but it left me ||in even more pain || <:ElsaSick:689395768754569359>
I put it off for like a year after finishing the anime, but I finally watched Madoka Magica Rebellion <:ShirabeWeep:701475635025019000>
Isn't that delayed
Scarred Souls Shine like Stars <:Chrisrember:1015095109932560404>

I was disappointed at how boring Mujina was, but she was hot
I agree Akane much more enjoyable

Didn't watch too much from 2022
My fav song on that album was Come Home With Me
Bruh I haven't heard this song in years
Nah it's old. It's from Nanoha movie 1.

I find it very cool whenever the main characters' seiyuus sing the OPs and/or EDs.
Think this might be my favorite
Took me a bit too long to notice that Nanoha's seiyuu does all the EDs
https://youtu.be/odW-KwtTs1Q
