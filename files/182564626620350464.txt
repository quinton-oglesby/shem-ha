Weeeeeelllll tsubasa does like older women <:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>

Desssss...
<:MikuBliss:336657233712513024>
Stay strong
Is it tingling below your belly?
Maybe i should check more pages instead of assuming from one page
on a side note is ao3 symphogear mostly perv stuff? ðŸ¤”
Haven't read it but i believe the two here more then that guy after reading his comment better <:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
No useful critics->complains because its not 100% correct->whiny bitch
wait no maybe i phrased that wrong
?
which Chris is supposed to have
think he just has a problem with the Trauma part
got curious and took a look
Fair enough
is really great tho
the one you posted last
i dont remember ever doing more then 700k
did they kill it?
kill streak?
was completely crap
Ability damage
because in the past
and it shows
Magisa is an old character
nonono that was the problem
i.e. Magisa
to the old nukes
Well it can't compared tho
Yea
A lot of testing
Think its going to need
No clue tho
or ougi
atleast people can now either go for TA
because ougi was completely trash
i think its actually nice
I know some people use him seriously
yea
And then went back to the trashcan
Godlike for a few hours
When Dsaru wasn't trash
That one moment
Dsaru also did broken damage when Summer Zoey got released
So the enmity completely goes through the roof
By using Yggdrasil Bows and double Yggdrasil summons
yep
iirc
used to do a billion
Her ground Zero
Have you ever seen old Sarasa?
the numbers would go insane tho
since that means getting 2 Ultima Weapons
It's gonna be a pain in the ass tho
does it stack twice?
so he might've been confused
not too long ago
And there was an Ougi cap increase update
Maybe he has other cap increasing stuff
think its just 50%
dont think so
10m?
think highest dmg with dsaru right now is
ohh
think it was around 4-5m with full stacks?
yep
because of her atk buffs
But you prefer to not ougi with Izmir
Yea
and better survival then her Summer version
She still does most damage tho
because of Seraph weapons
But she's kind of got killed
Does more ougi damage now
only for it to be complete unncessary
was made to complement Lecia
rip hairpotato
or they might add a complete new mechanic to the game
I don't see Skills getting into the racing so it will probably stay like that forever
for competitive skill damage
get their formula
maybe Cygames will eventually
but who knows
same with debuffs
buffs go for all sides tho
with 1 skill
for me it feels like i can probably get 3 TAs off
is it 1?
Which Cygames obviously doesn't want
unless it does high damage
Then its like i said almost impossible to compete
If we ignore animations
is kind of a next level thing tho
But multibox racing
that too
and there are some slow animation skills
Some are kind of ok ish
Unless the skills have boring and fast animations
Im also pretty sure that with 1 skill usage you can get a TA off on the whole party
since they have high cooldowns
for skills they need to do way more
each character would do 1,5m dmg total
considering on a racing level
which basically kills almost all the bosses
with each skill
you would need to do above 10m+ dmg
But to make it competitive
yea
competitive burns out too fast
and try to gather characters that have interactions with each other when fightning
But i've stopped caring about it and am mostly playing for the characters now
to make it really fit in a mobage
In a easier way to say.... It's too awkward
Hmm
since that would mean 1shotting a lot of things
and they can't make the numbers high enough for racing
because of the cooldowns
personally its probably gonna be an impossible thing
especially with the QoL changes
this year just a bit mixed feeling but i would personally say it got better again
2nd year it got better
I've heard a lot of bad stuff in the 1st year
ah yea
since i've only started playing 1,5 year back
a really long time ago then
that must've been
you never have to worry about apk and app versions
with the browser version
on a side note
gbf browser link ^
game.granbluefantasy.jp
inferior to the browser version
are for some reason
the app on pc and the app on phone
in the phone browser
you can still play it on the phone
it is
It's better to use the Browser version
the App version of gbf is pretty bad
But anyway
but then thats android isn't?
you could
might have been jp stores only then
when you needed to download the app version for gbf
maybe they were old guides
no problems with that
to make a gbf account
I've even been using my gmail account
Nope
No regrets tho
because most strong people left
Now its full with casuals and weak people
So i removed it in my crew
I hated that
yea
and help out if i see nightmares
i just do what i can
and the minimum you need to do
depends on how much honor you can get
it just started
yep
since she only starts to be good at lvl 100 haha
caglio takes ages to level anyway
Man earth got some great buffers
Shes also great
Oh yea i forgot they've added yugu
not so great for this nightmare boss sadly
halle is also great
since her cleanse is still stuck on her buff skill
well... almost all
they've literally fixed all her problems
and they've lowered the cooldown
and she also gives crit now
which stacks with all
her buff is now an unique type
Shes really good now
actually scratch that
which made her good again
and then there was a rebalancing update
then Mahira and earth DLF came out
her 5* made her decent
would've helped me a lot
i kind of regret not being able to level caglio to 100
even if they are worse then the top tiers
But yea im mostly using character i like tho
1m more then her old ougi cap?
yea
Haha
Since shes summer only
Which is actually still bad
Diantha fixes it tho
Yea that too
But so much investment needed
Man primal water is so good
True
Was it 3 for double varuna?
2 fimbuls is enough iirc
Thats already really good
And extend it with Quatre
If you also use the idol summon
I've heard you can have a 50% uptime with hype
Oh yea about diantha
He basically becomes your GW dagger
Yes
Forgot 5* Quatre is too good
Oh and Quatre
Uno for sure
Dont know what endgame water is tho
And damascus/gold bars
Which is a good amount of money
Only if you have like 4 Murgleis
Since its a guaranteed Ta
Would be pretty op
TA is 1 turn
That i dont know
And stackable ougi dmg buff
Tension indeed
Up to 60% normal multiplier Atk buff and 50% DA on ougi
She gives guaranteed TA to party
But no chhaser
Wel yes
No
Her buffs are amazing
Though diantha also buffed water elemental attack
Oh i also made mistake
Killed by gabriel
Rip normal izmir
Thats a lot of water
She is water's best buffer now iirc
So that's probably first thing you want to check
I don't remember if Altair and Diantha buffs stack with each other tho
4* Quatre debuffs isn't as reliable as 5*
unless you plan to do all the debuffs with your MC
and silva out
then probably keep altair
ah
that is 5* quatre or 4*?
ye
If it was magna i would've probably said Altair
hmm Varuna tho
Depends on what your water team is
and got Summer De La Fille instead
i did do a 10 draw tho
I didn't have the money to do scamgacha
Whoa lucky
might be possible for just 1 suptix
suptix seems to have slowed down
also 4 mlb Gisla... That's so much moons/surprise ticket/bars needed<:KirikaWhat:336657327325315084>
Looks like an Shiva/Shiva Grid
But then again that would turn into a lucha meme team
And use zoi without diantha
You could get some trium weapons and your fine
Im pretty lazy with it tho so its gonna take a looooong while
I still need so many weapons from Baal
Cant be worse then primal grids
Hmm.... nope dont think i have heard/seen double yugu ougi team
For chain burst damage
i did see an ougi team with Grani and alexiel
So they can kind of get away with it
But earth has really good enmity enablers
But thats also enmity
There is also a Titan yugu grid
Most likely actually
Maybe with yugu bows
Nope?
So i hope i wont get any new primal yet
Im still busy with building titan
True that
True
Since i dont really plan to invest for moon/gacha weapons
Or do them really slowly
I might skip new primal grids actually
That would be craziest investment needed ever
Please no
Tiamat guns are too good
i think it still has a good chunk of stats
being a Xeno weapon and 150
and the FLB upgrade is not really interesting either
Spear was 3rd weakest weapon iirc
good thing we only have to farm one in a wind grid
the spear is pretty bad too
and i saw most of the triggers
did check the gbf wiki for the fight
and a raid
only did a few extreme so far
most of his triggers are selfbuffs tho
it does
yep
was before seraph weapons too? not sure
but close enough
kind of different with what you happened
rip vohu
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymCfoYOrNcg
with skill damage only
where someone 1T her
Xeno Vohu
this reminds me of a video i saw with
oh yea.....
thats true
ah
thats the same isn;t?
i can see why its the best ultima upgrade
its still a crapton of cap increase
yea
40-45%
its 45% only
nope 2nd skill doesn't stack either
your right
oh
ah
who has Axe and Sword
except Sarasa
since everyone only has 1 favorite weapon
cant even use 2 different ones
since i asked Ultima/Atma
think both
if they are the same
2 Ultima doesn't stack
apparantly
Just asked in crew
thats pretty good
100% sure to cap
welp just bring yourself to 1 hp
true
if the 1st skill doesn't stack
it would hurt the dmg tho
only the ultima effect right?
did 2 atma weapon stack?
gonna be 6 guns, seraph, xeno, coda, mh
yep
won't beat tia guns
but having a 2nd one
f2p agni is pretty easy to make tho
already got most agni stuff?
you even run 3 if you use Shiva/Shiva summon
others 2 if they dont have pinya filler
some run 1 xeno and 1 pinya
but not everyone has pinya axe tho
and the stats was also higher iirc?
thats alot tho
where most people get 2 or 3
compared to xeno ifrit
only need to grind 1 mlb spear so its not that bad
i've spend the whole week grinding for 2 mlb xeno in the Xeno Vohu event
thats pretty lucky
and a Whale HL raid weapon
oh actually its only Gandalf sword
that grid is a pretty high investment tho
apparantly
with only seraph
2,5m
around 2m?
highest i got was
2,5m with just 2 combo
the chain burst is pretty high in the vid
2m with seraph
1.6m
altho it's actually more of a Chain Burst team then ougi
and doing good damage
pretty cool seeing the ougi team
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QufGQcahpIw
did i show you space whale/ougi team video already?
which is weird
but Sarasa is out of place tho
probably ougi team
because of the self enmity enabler
i've heard people are saying Titan can outrace Hades
which makes them really good
earth has really good self enmity enablers
mostly earth as 3rd tho
but i've seen other elements in their too
water and light are more superior
but your way weaker
you can use other elements too
nah
since i don't have the characters or grid for it
or atleast a long while
which wont ever happen for me
for MC and 20k for the rest
need to satisfy the 30k hp minimum first
or did you mean HL?
normal one
since lack of heals and phalanx
the bad runs wasn't fun
and a few bad runs
i've had a few good runs
depends on the group
nope
its Harp and Bow
ah wait no
harp and sword iirc
and i would probably get weapon first
its more of an issue that im too lazy to actually do that
unless i draw varuna in this legfest ðŸ¤”
hahaha
gonna take a loooooooong while for that
gonna use 4 baal axe and 2 spymur
atleast thats the plan
yea
so never bothered
i've only started using titan after not too long ago actually
i've always kept my friend list empty except for a few friends
i should probably start looking for titan friends
i only have titan and a base bahamut
nope
since you dont need to farm another 70 nightmare materials
1 drop makes life so much easier
yea
i dont want to do a 4th trade
i do hope i get a drop
only got enough for 1 base spear
haven't farmed yet
Nope
probably killed him before 10%
10%
i made a mistake and got blasted for 16k in my face with trigger in nm100
yea
is better then no succes rate
since any increase in succes rate
i always use the skill tho
same
was it?
or so i've heard
the normal R Lunalu has an even lower rate
the summer R lunalu that is
think somewhere around 30-40%?
its alright
and pray she copies
i usually combine him with Lunalu
iirc
yea his reset has a 1 turn cooldown
you can only do 2 per turn wasn;t?
haha
ah
Cant remember he got nerfed
Did they nerf nezha?
People leech in everywhere
Haha true
So gw is fine too
You can do xeno fine
Ah
And you want a few of them for agni
Eche sacks colo is good tho
Well except i still need to flb the guns
I just need one of this xeno spear and im done too
Oh yea i forgot gw has ele resistance too
Since dark can hit cap anyway
Would only hurt xeno diablo so not making a light isnt that bad even
Haha
I luckily started farming rainbow really early
And xeno diablo probably wont come for a long while anyway
I can understand that
After drawing in each legfest
Got my 1st light ssr after 7months ish
Light is my smallest character pool
Or full gunslinger
You either had to go full sword and zeus
Ahhh true
Probably because you kind of "need" swords but the droprate are horrible
But thats because i had a dark grid and characters
I usually host chev and kill it
Even tho i got most things already
Got 2 mlb swords but never bothered farming the materials for flb
That reminds me i should probably start on flb my chev swords
I've already max skill leveled everything in all elements so i just need to do seraph weapons since any increase is good increase
Too much of a mix i take it
The hp is nice tho
Yea
20% dmg increase+cap and 10% normal
Its great even in magna
Bit annoying that they have bahamut costs lvl
3 of them are still lvl 5
The fodder hurts tho
Wasnt that bad after they increased the bahamut horn droprate
I've grinded all seraph weapons at a decent speed
Ah
Got the others already?
And personally i find kirin more of a niche thing then the others
Sword is indeed unknown
Harp is mostly because its better then GW harp for elysian
10% cap increase is really good for dark since they cap dmg already
Nice almost max lvl too
and Bow increases cap by 10% with a Massive Normal Atk
and Big atk increase
since it reduces light dmg taken
altho sword is alright too
Danganronpa ðŸ¤”
Maybe i will change my mind if i do get Agni
only done 1 whale HL raid
havent done any T3 raids yet
since i prefer to be on a decent life
i will probably skip the prometheus tho
not too bad
max HP
apparantly it burns for 5%
just checking wiki
since it burns your team doesn't?
prometheus staff is with enmity tho
since f2p Agni is also really good
I might...maybeeeee do an Agni
yep
only bought Suptix
mostly because im sort of f2p-ish
hearing all these primal grids and whale items makes me more convinced to not build any primal after titan
Xeno cocy probably after sagi
I usually retreat raids when it seems like progress has died
I can only remember Medusa HL being the only T1 raid nerfed
making bad use of my AP/EP/BP now
i made a mistake to buy XCOM 2 DLC
my standards for anime have degraded so badly over time i don't remember when the last time i saw a bad anime
<:TsubasaDisgust:349013662775902209>
hope it gets better in xdu
Sadness rolling crap in an other gacha game
wouldn't that work too if you put 1 into 2?
The campaign going pretty bad tho <:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
Pretty chaotic and fun
And managed to convince 2 others for Dos2
I duoâ€™ed DoS1 with a friend
Stagnating on mobages again
Finally had some money to buy Divinity: Original Sin 2
Good games are a mistake
is it auto pilot?
Bullet hell ðŸ¤”
touhou?
iirc
but is a lot better then Kantai Collection
Chinese ripoff of Kantai Collection
Azurlane
i've no clue how those candles work but do they hurt your eyes when you wear it?
and thats a pretty cool visor
wanted SSR Kata and Yuel badly for my water atma team
i guess my desires were leaking too much for Murg and Yuel
61 draws with Titan, Twin elements and Sophia
i bought the mahira outfit and and managed to get another 14 draws
and yep they gave Lennah a 5* and at lvl 100 a 100% succes rate Ressurection
Someday they will get rid of useless summons like Quezalcoatl and Vortex Dragon
might splurge a tiny bit
tried 46 rolls for the new Yuel didn't get her got twin, Titan both useless for me now and Sophia where the relation also ended with since Lennah 5* is a thing now
grindblue at its finest
After months.....i did it
is gonna play Chie/Yang/Makoto in Tag
a friend of mines that likes Makoto
you would like Makoto too
yea if you like Yang
Oh Makoto
BB started as pretty broken > even more broken > slightly saved > back to broken > decent > bit broken
the more broken ones
and Junpei from P4 but he will never come
CTB i want to play half the cast of BB, half the cast of Uniel and everyone of RWBY
wasn't the RWBY Musou-like(Hack&Slash) game pretty good?
i was thinking of going full android if Android 21 is playable
I do know that i've too many characters i wanna play in BBTCB
I've no clue yet what im gonna play in DBFZ
and welcoming the new fightning game overlords while capcom dies in a ditch
while playing GGrev2, BBCF and Tekken 7 <:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
DBFZ and BBTCB comes out
im here just waiting till
But for now
true that
but thought it was funny if it was true
altho iirc the blog wasn't really the most trustworthy blog
was that the creator of smash told in an interview that it was intended as a party game
i think the most funny thing about that argument for me
but that might be because i've always played it as a party game
Personally i can't see Smash as a fightning game
Smash? ðŸ¤¢
Uniel[st] has pretty good balancing too now
dunno about SFV/MvCI since i really dislike the direction they went with those USF4 was pretty good
Tekken 7 has pretty good balancing except for the top tiers
probably most balanced fighter atm? or atleast anime fighter
the amount of time and effort you put in
with Guilty Gear it eventually ends back to
But anyway
at the highest level <:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
since theres a potemkin in top 8 for a good amount
That's a lie tho
Doing pretty well with my Potemkin
also Tiers luckily don't matter a lot in Guilty gear since balancing is pretty good
Sadlife for baiken players
Baiken is bottom tho
just hard to pick up
Ram isn't that bad actually
on a side note i doubt i would be a great training partner tho since i suck at explaining
and try to find people over there
you could try the guilty gear discord
Eu tho
Rev2 pc
I do
time loops
Alternate timelines
was such a huge clusterfuck
.....
BB story
iirc
before they start on BBxGG
They also wanted to finish the story in both respective games first
they can probably manage to make them wait even longer
fans wanted BBxGG for so long
nah they won't
throwning items for days
Teddy+Faust
If only GG was in CTB
characters from Dengeki
SAO
other populair anime stuff
or FGO/Granblue and idk
Akira
but we will probably get
Believe in Bikki
yea
with CTB
feels like anything is still possible
with all the issues they had and have
i didn't buy it
and am i glad
and offline at friends
only played it beta
i haven't bought SFV tho
yea
SFV makes me fall asleep
then the fun parts start
and get in
Gotta survive the Neutral first
nah not in start tho
its something in general
im talking about
nah its not just BB tho
or a higher tier characters
when you play against another player at a decent skill
Rushdown characters is hell to play tho
yea
but oh well
i should sleep soon
most Rushdown characters are really fun tho
But she ain't no squirrel
I did thought about Bullet since you said explodey arms
oh
Good night~
or enjoy losing just like me since it feels as a challenge and that you can improve
and hope you don't get salty to it
A LOT
and lose alot
If you want to get better in GG just practise a lot in training room, watch videos, read frame data
Anyway time to sleep
Everyone wants Ragna
some kind of time reset
