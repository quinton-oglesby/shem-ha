lol what is kung fu panda 4 even supposed to be about, the story already feels completed
Probably mid to late 2023
Yea it's coming out in 2023
Oh this the upcoming yuri series
how bad was it
kinda sad, feels like its gonna be really rushed
yea
https://twitter.com/Haikyu_EN/status/1558378287369428993?t=LvcVwNX7hSWRuPjKghBaag&s=33
<:sad:711459298752069633>
still no news of season 2
yea i mean like the way the 3rd movie ended off was already really good and there was no need to continue, it just looks more like they are just trying to milk the franchise for what its got
If it can be gay, it can be yuri too
Yea true
It was announced to get a sequel a while back, surprised to see it do good enough to get one tho
bloom into you because its just that good
<:copium:874086088271085609>
We will get a s2 one day
more likely to be actually gay than bait after the recent episode tbh
read the manga ahead of the anime and its pretty decent
<:smug:711459299137683526>
yuri is my job gonna be airing soon
though it probably wont happen now
it has just about enough for an anime adaptation
i was really hoping it would get an anime
too soon
<:notlikethis:565754539236655125>
<:meguPuke:238539036619177985>
if sk8 could get a season 2, lycoris may get a season 2 too <:Copium:835106373158567993>

It is pretty good from what I have watched so far
<:SuiDerp:870791756667580436>
I mean I'm like halfway thru watching katanagatari
Maybe
1 day I will get around to watching them
I'm just a seasonal anime watcher
<a:run:748379340508495962>
Of all of them I have only watched symphogear
<a:run:748379340508495962>
Mika is confirmed to be gay after all
And very gay
Because its a great anime

What this series about
best character from apocrypha together with her master
<:SuiDerp:870791756667580436>
sounds pretty interesting, will give it a watch when it comes out
what is this series about?
thats a big red sign if i've ever seen one
`netflix`
Kaguya is a SOL comedy anime, until it suddenly isn't and hits you with the feels
it do be a pretty good series
Damn that's awesome, kinda wanna watch but heard the subs quality are shit
trailer for the genshin anime looks pretty cool
I like
Her nendo is very cute
<:sad:711459298752069633>
if only
<a:run:748379340508495962>
summertime render is great and everyone should watch it
the new rwby anime feels kinda disappointing
https://youtu.be/-tAaJ7hsas0
Oh yea the final fight looked like a Harry Potter fight lol
How bad was the adaptation? I remember watching the season and I thought it was pretty good
still waiting for fate route adaptation

Finally some season 2 news
praying for s2
<:sad:711459298752069633>

<a:dead:484694323640795136>

Danmachi s4 was initially announced to be a 2 cour
new fate anime is pog
https://vxtwitter.com/Fate_SF_Anime/status/1573566797529620480
already have this
|| https://twitter.com/rainennonatsu20/status/1573697417568202753 ||
shes so cute
||also since majima is still alive, they can do a season 2 where he comes back and screws with DA||
need season 2
<:WhenLifeGetsAtYou:647974931094831114>
lycoris is over
<:WhenLifeGetsAtYou:647974931094831114>
saturdays arent gonna be the same without lycoreco
||tbf the cover up will most likely not be 100% successful, there will definitely be people who doubt that it was all an act, and that will give us our s2 content <:SuiDerp:870791756667580436> ||
they are so gay and cute
last episode of s2 was yikes <:SaberTrauma:585553580010766342>
and i would say there is good potential for s2 lycoreco with how it ended
i mean sk8 did get a sequel even tho it was pretty much resolved
<:SuiComfy:870840672754757663>
That's some pretty good sales
https://twitter.com/Namaryuu/status/1574688514922500096?t=xBtWGOiLavh_mMQNybC-1Q&s=33
Ah yes cheese, my favorite lycoreco character
No reason for them to stop working on SAO just for lycoreco, SAO is a big money printing machine and A1 is capable of making multiple animes at the same time
<:SuiComfy:870840672754757663>
best kaguya arc
you forgot about the last half that just watching them fight
and maybeeeee season 2 in the future
theres LN and manga
<a:kyokoThumbsUp:705221549405241415>
whats ths anime about

https://twitter.com/AniTrendz/status/1576357594830376960?t=AfC7ksoBCFJ_vbDIhvx4qg&s=33

<a:NOTED:827627404293963777>

Maybe I'll give it a watch
<a:NOTED:827627404293963777>

<:illiteratejeannepotatobrain:801192247575183393>
i let my friend order for me because i have no idea what to eat
ikr
<a:run:748379340508495962>
~~in bed~~
dont be mean to the baby
speaking is hard
shes basically hibiki so thats another plus
lol imagine if the story was following a 4 year old girl piloting a gundam
a worthy sacrifice
lol
<a:NOTED:827627404293963777>
actually i kinda want to ask a question ||is aerial and lfrith the same gundam||
what if the pilot was hit by accident
lol
so could they technically legally nuke earth and get away with it
<a:NOTED:827627404293963777>
pls do enlighten
wdym humans fucked the earth
<:worrysus:962356550196936804>

This is some really messed up logic
https://twitter.com/anitrendz/status/1578009274898227200?s=46&t=PUSPMjYaNcy6pmnMPYsKHA
imagine if part 7 does get made and has to go thru the same treatment

DIY looks really cute so far and i love it
shamiko is so cute, need s3
<:notlikethis:565754539236655125>
