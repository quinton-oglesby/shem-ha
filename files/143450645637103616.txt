I came from the raildex server  where a couple of us were talking about symphogear to the symphogear server where you were talking about raildex
reee spoilers
now all my excitement for the last ep is gone
at least the animation quality makes the show seem almost real
When someone is being a pussy
I use it to describe harem portags a lot
Unlike it sounds it is not a lesbian act of foot fetishism
Indeed
so nothing has confirmed that this is the last season but everything they are saying is pointing towards it?
he is being scared of main girl being anger

ok cool
and the last one you posted has all of them
question, what are those huge charts that were getting posted?
<@185949743321579520> are you sure it is missing some?
there appears to be 13 images for each season and then an extra one for the ending scene
ah ok
and only one gay pair right?
at least in the anime
only one of them sings tho right?
ive only seen the anime not the ln
or did the guy have a heart attack
i mean like "was an aileron stuck"
but like holy shit that plane crash
what happened
either something went wrong with the plane that caused the crash, or something happened to the pilot
