lol "Symphofear" I love that name
The second one feels more emotive to me tbh
<:KirikaPog:605209108827734017>

That's cursed
Yeah my dorm had an oven
<:ChrisHappy:660870796696223744>
She absolutely does
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
You know which Basa emote needs some pats?
<:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
All these reminders that I can't use the nice gif emotes we have
<:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
Does that mean you're a boomer Melua?
I didn't even know we had those emotes
Lily, your name being a different color is throwing me off
Does Tsubasa really have the iq to be pondering things though
That's a nice Chris
Ah I forgot it was a nitro only thing
Can you use an animated slot as a normal emote slot?
Don't bully elfnein
But still cute
ooh that's a cool Miku
<:ElfneinTrip:688025973932687377>
Just be like rady and DMJii. Talk about something enough that people will automatically think of you when they post it <:HibikiFingerguns:688429715836502063>
Don't remind me <:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
Salt is gonna remove moisture from the soil. So the grass won't be able to get the water it needs and will likely wilt.

That's quite the hot pair
First superstar ep was fantastic, I'll try to give it a watch later.
<:KanonHug:716009756313256016>
I'm a Teio fan but Rice Shower is a really good girl too
<:KirikaSmug:607742561414676517>
Fantastic anime tho
That's an emote of a character I wouldn't expect to see
<:CarolSmug:617040484111745027>
Uma Musume is quality
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
Too much spinning
Those chairs at the bar(?) Look uncomfortable
Nashville is a cool place
👀
That looks pretty neat
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
*feet*
~~lewd~~
I see a missing detail, there's no head
I thought that second pic was showing them in the trash lol
<:MariaScared:672584661125431299>
that looks good
<:KirikaPog:605209108827734017>
Cute girls climbing mountains <:CarolSmug:617040484111745027>
All I can see is a bunch of worms crawling across the water 🪱
That looks like so much gravy
Lewd

<:ChrisHappy:660870796696223744>
These are all adorable af
No idea what the text is saying, but that def looks like the average interaction I'd expect from Chris and Hibiki judging by their expressions lol
Ahhh they're so cute together
Ooh that actually looks really nice, I like that style.
A lot of really nice Carol/Elfnein art too
That Chris  is cute af, she looks super cozy
Ahh they're  so cute together <:MikuPraise:585839808765493249> <:HibikiWow:614268629952757760>
<:ChrisPray:672578403156885504>
I appreciate your efforts
<:ChrisHappy:660870796696223744>
Looking through  the  massive collection of art in the pinned message, I never realized just how much edgebikki art there is around.
<:ChrisShock:620077681484103680>
How could anyone even think of eating something that cute tho
With Chris making that kinda face at food, it's gotta be spaghetti right?
Oh god Chris with a kid, she's so cute. They're both so adorable
Ahh Chris is so cute
"just draw me better than senpai would" lmao I forgot about Tsubasa's drawing
Chris and food always makes for a good pic
<:ChrisEating:384879395829186560>
That was a good read, ty <:ChrisHappy:660870796696223744>
<:ChrisHappy:660870796696223744>
Ahh she's so cute

For those that were interested
<:ChrisHappy:660870796696223744>
<:ChrisPray:672578403156885504>
I appreciate all the blessed pics of Chris eating <@!468591607332208641>
I'd 100% sub to that lol
There needs to be more pics of Chris eating tbh
<:ChrisMunch:688191202973319198>
Damn Chris lookin cute af in that maid outfit
<:ChrisHappy:660870796696223744>
<:ChrisHappy:660870796696223744>
<:KirikaSparkle:698939825876631714>
The ice cream cone on the right definitely feels like it's meant for Miku lol
Chris in that regal outfit with that sword, so damn good
Damn Kirika with long hair looks really good, it's a shame we hardly see her with it in the anime.
St. Germain guiding Hibiki on everyday tasks and decisions would've been a great short for one of the OVA's
If she knows they're meant for blowing up
Does she even bother with insurance tbh
They're both cute af
Oh yeah, it was really wholesome
Took me a minute  to figure out the right direction to read that comic in
Chris and Ryoko tho? Idk how I feel about that one
I just rewatched her XV transformation, and damn. I forgot how damn cool it is.
Wait are those yo-yo's on her head? How have I never noticed
Damn, those gloves look impressive
Damn I forgot how cute that AU Chris was
<:HibikiGay:670494484701773845>
<:ChrisEating:384879395829186560>
I ship Chris and Food
Is that Chris dressed like a noise?
Young basa
I like how they're all just offering tributes while Maria is just chillin in the back recording it all.
<:ChrisHappy:660870796696223744>
OwO I'll have to check in later to see all the Chris and HibiMiku stuff I've missed
<:ChrisMunch:688191202973319198>
Carol and Elfnein in the Lydian outfit, I fully support this
<:ChrisEmbarrassed:663558614610608128>
That Chris is real cute too
For a second I thought that was Chris instead of Maria and got real confused
Ah, I just assumed it was Tsubasa xD
Tsubasa in Gungnir, that's a thought I don't see often.
Chris and Maria being intimidating like that, dayum
<:HibiMiku:432007202136391690>
Hibiki and Miku both look lonely in those pics, Let them be together already!
<:ChrisHappy:660870796696223744>
Ahh so much good Chris art
Anyone happen to know of any art with Chris in a party hat? I looked around a bit and couldn't seem to find anything.
True, that too
I love that AU Chris so much, she's cute af
I forget, how much older is Chris than Hibiki/Miku? A year?
Chris being far more concerned with her food than the people around her in that scenario is definitely pretty accurate.
<:ChrisPray:672578403156885504>
40k
<:KirikaPog:605209108827734017>
I forget who it was, but wasn't there someone who was doing a playthrough and posting a summary of what's going on on their twitter? Prob the best alternative since you can't play it
<:MikuPraise:585839808765493249>
Damn, that's a nice Miku
I like the assertion that Chris is enjoying wearing that outfit lol
<:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
<:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
My Chris plushie is getting delayed shipping because of covid
It looks like Hibiki has just kinda merged with the bed in that pic
Oh damn, I didn't even notice her abs. Nice.
<:ChrisHappy:660870796696223744>
<:ChrisHappy:660870796696223744>
She's still cute regardless
I'm moreso on the side of "Chris is just the cool friend of the group, she doesn't need to be shipped with anyone" but everyone's got their own takes
It's interesting that because Chris isn't really shipped with anyone in particular, she just gets shipped with *everyone*
No idea what references we're talking about here, but she looks great.
Chris lookin about as uncomfortable in that outfit as I'd expect.
Is XDU giving us the confirmation of HibiMiku?
Yeah, it is

I think so
<:ChrisHappy:660870796696223744>
There's a tragic shortage of Chris shooting a bow in gear, I wish we got more scenes where she used one.
<:ChrisBang:702166093065748500>
The one just posted? Looks like Hifumi from New Game! But I'm not positive.
I did kinda forget about considering those two as a pair tbh.
I can relate
Far right Miku is a mood tbh
Those are some nice Miku's
Oh yeah S2 started today didn't it?

That's a lotta Chris and Tsubasa
Yeah there's plenty of content for a second season too
It does get pretty gay
<:ChrisBang:702166093065748500>
There's a few that I found in kerrik's archive like this one
<:ChrisHappy:660870796696223744>
Yeah they've got a ton of great stuff, plus their feed is always full of Chris stuff which is nice
Yeah, I saw that one earlier. That's a tough interaction for Chris
^ My hopes for Bofuri S2
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>

Ah I was looking on mobile which is why I didn't see it.
Wait suit Chris? Did I miss a Chris post?
<:HibikiMunch:672606446239744000>
Well that's a sad image
That's a nice Chris
I hope there'll be some translations of the event
<:ChrisHappy:660870796696223744>
<:ChrisMunch:688191202973319198>
That's a nice Chris
Oh man, I hope translations come soon
Oh yeah doesn't that event launch today with Android Kirika?
<:KirikaSparkle:698939825876631714>
I like that design of Hibiki with Tsubasas gear.
<:CarolStare:336656462287994882>
Is that a cosplay of the XV logo? lmao
Chris in a hoodie with cat ears, damn that's cute.
<:HibiMiku:432007202136391690>
I actually really like that shirabe and kirika with that artstyle
<:ChrisPray:672578403156885504>
Waking up to all these Chris images is nice.
She probably just hurt it while helping a cat out of a tree or something
Damn that's a cute HibiMiku
Ah didn't realize it was that image
I just noticed the mugs are colored to match their colors too, that's a nice touch
I like how Chris seems to be taking it super seriously
I do wonder what the text in the corner says tho
<:ChrisHappy:660870796696223744>
Well regardless of the details, she's cute anyway

That's adorable
I like their outfits in that one
She never really actually fights with a spear tho does she
I kinda wish we got to see a scene with Hibiki actually using the spear instead of just her fists.
<:KirikaSparkle:698939825876631714>
I love it
Ponytail kiri? Don't think I have
Maybe I just have a thing for long hair now that I think about it...
Long haired Hibiki and Kirika are both adorable
Hibiki's got some nsfw thoughts hiding behind those eyes of what she's about to do to Miku
Chris with a bow <:KirikaPog:605209108827734017>
That's wholesome af
<:KirikaPog:605209108827734017>

Long hair Hibiki
Ayy the fanart is already here
<:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
I was hoping it'd be happy
Oh no
That's what I wanna see in XDU, Edgebikki really does need a hug
<:ChrisEmbarrassed:738167509869527060>
<:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
Pls no, she's suffered enough
Wdym photoshop, this is clearly a real frame from gear
I'll have to download the Chris folder again
<:KirikaPog:605209108827734017>  more art
I vote for cursed
yeah that one
Wheres that one pic with Chris in the middle of all the ships
I feel like I don't see Miku and Chris art as much as I'd expect. I guess it's probably because HibiMiku is already such a thing
<:ChrisBang:702166093065748500>
That's a stern face on that Chris
I really like the artstyle on that Carol
<:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
Nice, I can always use some yuri on my twitter feed
Miku in a SONG uniform lookin good af
<:ChrisPresents:672578363176517642>
Kanade as a mecha centaur, now that's something I wouldn't expect to see
<:HibikiGay:670494484701773845>
Miku carrying Hibiki
Thats some nice Miku
<:Zababies:672238628398956594>
DMJii pics

Oh hey I had to learn how to use one of those in my genetics lab lol
DMJii content is always so wholesome
I thought the same thing lmao
Its always fun seeing the emote sources
<:MikuJoy:738234684655403110>
<:MikuBliss:336657233712513024>
Yeah that one
Isnt there an XDU comic with like 50 hibikis
Seeing long haired versions of characters with normally short hair has made me realize I have a thing for long hair <:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
Long hair <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
"Do that at home"

Ooh this is a nice crossover. I love it
HibiMiku <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
<:KanadeLewd:690470896174891008>
That's a fair answer tbh
You know that pic makes me think. I wonder if the gears ever got any proper training in skydiving or if they just jump out of helicopters and other high places frequently regardless.
That's a nice Miku
<:HibikiKiss:738240567049191505><:MikuKiss:738240587014340649>
Based on those outfits, it only took 5 seasons
<:ChrisHappy:660870796696223744>
Now show me what comes right after that picture
<:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
I could always use some more Chris art
<:ChrisHappy:660870796696223744>

Is this about to get into some <#336297808221044736> discussion
The better question is: *Should* you post that much art of it.
That's uhhhhhhh, certainly *something*

That too, I just feel like there'll probably be more maria art but who knows
Im already anticipating the influx of loli maria art in here when that event goes live
<:ChrisMunch:688191202973319198>
<:ShirabeAwe:698939825113268306>
Because I glanced at it, thought "Yep, DMJII, that's cute" and moved on without looking any further into it
Oh wait I didnt even notice they were in the wrong gears and they were color swapped lmao
That's real cute
That was an assault to the ears. I love it.
<:MikuCute:672908542763859968> 🔪

That's got a cult vibe
Oof, that's rough

You know, I see shemmiku so often that I actually forgot about her actual form lol
Shemmy out here going hard with the Miku pics
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
That long hair tho

These artists are quick lol
Oh nice we've got fanart in that hoodie already
That's quite the look
Kirika is trying her best
That's pretty cute
Miku and Chris <:KirikaPog:605209108827734017>

Wasnt it the south pole
Ooh thats an interesting pairing
Ooh a ponytail
<:ShirabeAwe:698939825113268306>
Ooh, that's a look. I love it
I wonder how hard it would be to find pics you don't have rady
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
Long Hair
That's a lot of wholesome hibimiku
Hell yeah, more Gen and Chris interactions
That's the kinda interaction between Gen and Chris that I would've loved to see
I love long hair on any of the characters, it always looks great
Ooh they're both so cute
That's some nice hibimiku
That's a nice outfit Chris is in
<:ChrisPray:672578403156885504>
Ahh such blessed art
That's a really nice pic of the gears and Elfnein just hanging out
Ooh, Elaina art
I love the emotes with Chris eating so much
I like to think that all the gears are rich as hell after saving the world a few times which would make it even more hilarious if they still were that price conscious.
Now I wanna see more of DMJii being cheap when it's not necessary
Ah, I really wanna see what happens after that but I'm not sure if I wanna read ahead in the manga or wait until god knows when for it to be adapted.
Ah, is the manga already finished, or is it still ongoing
Oh have you not seen it?
That guy may be a horrible dad, but man that movie was amazing
Those are some really pretty eyes
Very cute
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>

Ponytail Kirika
I like the oddly specific tags on that picture like "#sitting with hands around knees"
Ooh they're cute
That's some nice HibiMiku

The baby kinda reminds me of Honoka from Love Live
What exactly is going on in this image
Damn that was wholesome
That's a lot of hibimiku
We need more happy Chris
Probably both
Idk how I feel about this one
<:ChrisMunch:688191202973319198>
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Ooh. she cute
If I got told this was a memoria I'd believe it
Pairings aside though, that's some damn good art
Seeing either Kirika or Shirabe paired with anyone but each other is pretty unusual
Hibiki *kinda* uses one a couple times, but not really. I wanna see her using one like Kanade did
I wish we got Hibiki using a spear at least once
<:KirikaMunch:672599382670966785>
It's interesting how Shirabe is the dom in those
There we go, good stuff
Cmon rady, what are ya hiding
<:ShirabeStare:582381430915596289>
<:HibiMiku:432007202136391690>
<:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
I'm shocked Chris, or anyone for that matter, would actually get on a bike with Tsubasa
Bakarina being dense is great
That's some cute Chris and Basa
Ooh that's a nice Shirabe
Because the suffering in the anime wasn't enough, it has to extend to merch as well.
it's a shame we didn't get more out of Dainsleif, it's such a cool looking sword
<:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
Oh wow, that's a look
Ooh, good stuff
<:ChrisPray:672578403156885504>
That's some nice HibiMiku
<:HibikiGay:670494484701773845>
That's a lot of Miku
Wait is Yumi the only one we have an emote for
<:YumiPoint:688429724103344164>
I'm not sure how I'm supposed to feel about that one
Christmas Carol <:CarolSmug:617040484111745027>
Handholding? I think that's too lewd for sfw
Ooh, they're cute
<:KirikaPog:605209108827734017>
Elaina art!
I hadn't considered this, but I'll ship it
<:ChrisMunch:688191202973319198>
||Kyubey just likes watching like the sick fuck he is||
I don't really know the details of image, but I think I'd rather not know.
Ryuko lookin good
Nice and wholesome Tsubasa and Chris, I like it
Very true
Damn that Chris is cute as hell
<:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
THEY'RE SO CUTE TOGETHER <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
Shemha is making such a great face there
<:ChrisHappy:660870796696223744>
Good, Chris deserves hugs
I wonder what Chris is reading there
I want an actual Utazukin anime
<:ChrisPresents:672578363176517642>
God there's so many cute memorias
It's always nice to wake up and look through all the art that got posted when I was asleep
Very comfy
Edgebikki needs that hug
She only appears briefly in like one episode iirc
They all need more hugs
That's a combination I never would've expected to see
Long Hair Hibiki <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
That long hair tho, cute af
What's to the left of Tsubasa in that pic?
Is that some Fate and Nanoha? Fuck yeah
Oh hey, I remember using one of those devices in my genetics labs
Hell yeah wholesome af
<:ShirabeCry:671887081026617345>
I really like the upside down elfnein
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
Kirika is giving off a super evil vibe
<:ChrisHappy:660870796696223744>
Is that a happy Chris I see?
O shit she's got the spear, I love it
Those poses look incredibly awkward and uncomfortable to hold
Show them your collection of Symphogear pics and I'm sure they'll be so impressed that you'll get it
Hand reveal <:KirikaPog:605209108827734017>
I didn't even recognize that as elfnein at first tbh
Yeah
I find this pic more attractive than all the nsfw ones of her tbh
Yeah all I ever see is nsfw pics of her, so its kinda lost its novelty from seeing it all the time. Whereas I don't see sfw pics around here nearly as much.
Ooh that's a nice looking basa
Shamiko and Momo <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
Handholding? Doesn't that much lewdness belong in <#336297808221044736>
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
Ahh the best girl in the idol anime who isnt an idol
NIjigasaki has so many good characters
KASUKASU
I still want a song out of her even though she isnt an idol
What the hell is that, it looks cursed
Seeing this made me think "Wait, did Aoi Yuuki voice Ryuko too? How could I miss that?" Because I saw Hibiki and Madoka and thought this was a VA thing
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
<:HibikiFingerguns:688429715836502063>
Just don't sleep, problem solved
<:ChrisPray:672578403156885504>
Art of Chris eating is always a blessing <:ChrisMunch:688191202973319198> <:ChrisEating:384879395829186560>
Tiny Chris! She's so adorable
Long Hair <:ShirabeAwe:698939825113268306>
~~I wish Chris would step on me~~
Hell yeah Shirabe, pat the Chris
They're so cute together <:ChrisHappy:660870796696223744>
Hey it's KasuKasu
That's a lotta Kasumin, good stuff
<:MikuBliss:336657233712513024>
HibiMiku is always nice <:HibikiGay:670494484701773845> <:MikuGay:336656810788388864>
Ah, I knew it seemed kinda familiar, but I had no idea where it was from
Is this some reference I just don't get?
Cute outfit
She's building her harem <:KirikaPog:605209108827734017>
Huh, I never noticed
Wait, is there normally a bow on the back?
I feel like it's really rare to see art of Tsubasa w/o her usual hair style
Ahh they're both so good
Those hoodies are amazing, I want them <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
It's a shame that despite how damn cool the her spear is we barely got to see it in action at all.
Ooh Kanade art
<:ChrisPray:672578403156885504>
Also, I appreciate all this blessed HibiMiku Shemmy
Oh god that's horrifying
I feel like Carol would be great at rapping
Ah, IF version?
I'm surprised there's no Kanade
Ooh they're cute <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
Edgebikki deserves to be happy, she's been through a lot of shit
<:ShirabeAwe:698939825113268306>
That's quite the depiction
poor Nico
I dont remember the ending, I'll have to look at that one later
<:KirikaPog:605209108827734017>

All these twintails, but I'm surprised no one has posted tail red
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
She definitely looks like she's about to murder some people there
Ooh that's a nice Miku
<:ChrisWave:738169593574719568>
All these nice Chris posts
Kerrik you're too powerful, being able to meet the demands for requests like that
Hibiki looks so excited to be thrown
yeah with a quick glance at the scene I can't think of any reasonable way to check the distance that the portal was in the air. But I'm no expert so who knows <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
I wonder if there's any good way to gauge the distance to actually calculate how good Mikus throw is
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
Poor Tsubasa
<:ChrisBang:702166093065748500>
That hoodie looks great, I want one
Kirika's definitely got the right vibe for a cheerleader
Ez solution, just start flirting with Kozakura instead
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
<:ChrisPray:672578403156885504>
What a blessed image
Lewdness aside, all these girls are still really cute
Damn thats cute
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
Yuri!
Ooh she's really cute
<:ChrisHappy:660870796696223744>
Tiny Chris! They're all so adorable
That's a nice outfit
Flannel is great
stereotype?
I like how they're just supporting Chris eating
I've said it before, but edgebikkis hoodie is really nice, I want one
<:ChrisWave:738169593574719568>
Oh hey, I use that Chris as my phone background
I know they're a part of the Lost Song stuff, but beyond that I have no clue
Ooh, long hair *and* black gungnir. Now that's a look
Maki looks so nonchalant about it.
Ahh all that nice Kirika up there, good stuff <:KirikaSalute:620069889838809089>
That's a cute Miku
Her nails are really pretty in that pic
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
Ooh fair point
The nsfw version happened right before miku fell asleep <:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
Damn, that looks amazing
All the valentines art, so cute
That's uhhh interesting
Who's she giving them to in the memoria? Is it tsubasa?
<:ChrisEmbarrassed:738167509869527060>
cursed
Ooh they've even got the colored ties with the uniform, I love it
Ooh that's a good group
That's some nice Kirika
<:ShirabeStare:582381430915596289>
Damn now there's an interesting scenario
<:HibikiGay:670494484701773845>
Ooh Miku with the spear
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
That's a lotta Hibiki
<:MikuDelete:661660028410920990>
I was gonna say they give a very Nanoha vibe, only to see Nanoha in the tags lol
<:ShirabeHeart:738932033635483738><:KirikaHeart:738932018116821034>
That's some really wholesome DMJii you got there
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
She looks like she'd easily murder me
The lines under their eyes makes it seem like they're really sleep deprived lol
Ooh, I like the scorpion girl, but the others are kinda creepy for me
Kirika's outfits are always really good
Damn those are some nice Kirikas
<:ShirabeAwe:698939825113268306>
I saw that and thought of Madoka for a sec
Nanoha and Fate <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
Truth? Wdym? Santa's clearly real, that's why Maki keeps the chimney clean and Santa visits her.
Nico no, that's forbidden
<:ChrisMunch:688191202973319198>
Ooh they're cute
I'm assuming that's not the real text (maybe it is) but what's that from
For some reason those glasses make Honoka look smart, which just isn't right
More of Yuu being best girl i see
That Hibiki kinda reminds me of Senko
Miku and Chris interactions <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
She's so cute
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
Now there's something I wouldn't expect
Yeah it's a really cute bikki regardless
Maybe it's just me tho
The closed eye just looks a bit off
"If you miss me to death... then die" what a line
That's a really cute Fate
Now there's something I don't think I've ever seen art of
For a second I thought, "Wait, did Aoi Yuki voice the girl from Re:Zero" because I assumed it was a 'same VA' thing.
I'd trust Serena as a detective more than I would Tsubasa tbh
Is that a memoria?
Ooh NicoMaki <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
Well, they're all from different Love Live seasons: School Idol Project, Nijigasaki, and Sunshine
Seeing those three together is unexpected
Damn that looks cool as hell
That microwave needs to be cleaned
This just gives a "It's not like I wanted you to carry me or anything" vibe
That's some real nice HibiMiku up there
For some reason this gives off really depressing vibes lol
That's some good stuff Shemmy
<:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
I feel like I rarely see art of Honoka in here
Ooh those eyes <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
Ahh she's adorable
<:ChrisHappy:660870796696223744>
<:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
Kanade's outfit lookin sexy af
Damn thats cute
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
<:KirikaMegane:585848185847676939>
Ooh, Teio is cute
Ooh Frieren art <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
I mean when you put it like that
Looking through the list of stuff that year, Attack on Titan and Railgun S are the only ones that really stick out to me
Symphogear G came out in 2013 <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
NicoMaki is good stuff indeed
It's such a good design
Idk why but this just fits really well
God that outfit is hot
Oh yeah I forgot that was a whole thing
I don't remember much of anything from Vivid
Ahh they're so cute together
Nanoha and Fate <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
Ahh what a good pair
Best dad
This kinda gives a Warframe vibe
Big Nanoha and smol Nanoha
That's some sexy Christmas attire
Oh my god I love it
I maintain that Tsubasa's hair clip is a relic and that's how she keeps her hair up
Maybe it's a relic
The tail on Kirika's outfit is underrated tbh. I love it
Thats some nice Nanoha stuff
Damn that's pretty impressive
So much Tsubasa and Chris, they're super cute
I thought this one was Nanoha and Fate for a sec
Good stuff <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
That's some really nice Maple art
Ganbare Shamiko
She's really cute but man did I not enjoy that anime at all
They look like they're staring into my soul
Apparently the artist has a bunch of art of that girl <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>  She's really cute
Maple of the wool what is your wisdom?
Precious smile
Elfnein just decided to thanos snap the entire timeline outta existence
Holy shit that's some good art
I'm pretty confident Elfnein would beat the hell outta me
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
Seeing this reminded me, I always kinda wondered how Noise were treated in the Symphogear world. Like, is there noise merch that exists? Are there like childrens shows that depict noise as bad guys?
Cursed
I want a s2
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
Elaina
Maybe I should go watch it so I can understand the event when it comes out
Yeah I figured, I haven't seen it but it was familiar
That jacket looks super comfy
Is that Shamiko and Kaos? Two of my favorite CGDCT girls?
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
Is it a powerful card?
https://myanimelist.net/anime/44274/Puraore_Pride_of_Orange
Semi-related, but while it's not quite idols, there is that anime that got announced about girls doing ice hockey.
Best Aquors girl indeed
Ooh, super cute
OwO? Wedding dress You?
Of course you do
Nico no! Don't crush her dreams
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
Nanoha and Fate
Ooh that's a super pretty dress
I didn't even know it was a collab in the first place until y'all just mentioned it lol
Isn't there that one XDU event where all the girls basically join bands? Was Hibiki on the guitar? I forget
Maki <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
I would imagine that it'd be pretty hard to find a plushie of a pile of ash <:Ver:704169051391524875>
I don't see any cat ear hair, therefore it can't be Maria
Got a source on that one Nova?
protecc the Miku
Elaina is cute af
<:ChrisMunch:688191202973319198>
Yuu being cute as usual
Is that a steampunk HibiMiku? Looks good
Seeing someone other than Fate with Nanoha is throwing me off
I forgot yuno existed lol
That thing Serena is holding always reminds me of an Ewok from Star Wars
Does efficiency really matter if it looks cool
Kanade gets to dual wield spears? Damn that's cool
<:GenjuroLaugh:689563633516150872>
Genjuro is the best dad
One of those pice looks like the pic Hibiki and miku took in S1 (the one furthest to the right) but anyone know the other two pics on the ground?
It ranked like 4th or 5th in a poll asking what people wanna see adapted
Damn it gimme an anime adaptation already
What a powerful gay duo <:HibikiGay:670494484701773845>
Looks like I have a new twitter account to follow <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
I remember reading a few chapters of that, I should revisit it
Is that catgirl yuri? <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
They're super cute
I'm surprised I never considered shipping them lol
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
Saten looks like she's absolutely beat the hell outta me with that bat
Are those some horse girls? <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
Scrolling through the art channels when I wake up is always nice because I get to see nice art like this. Rika <:KirikaPog:605209108827734017>
<:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
Abs
I like to think that Chris is on the taller building to compensate for her height
Cute Girls <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
That's older than I expected tbh
How old is Serena anyway? Everytime I see her I'm reminded that she's a damn child
That looks very wholesome <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
<:ChrisDJ:690470897194369034>
She's about to drop a banger
Nehushtan Chris <:KirikaPog:605209108827734017>
<:ChrisMunch:688191202973319198>
That's a good looking Ai
🥚
Those are some pretty close friends
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
It's such a cool outfit
Ooh I like that artstyle
That's a lot of Chris, I love it
I was gonna say "wouldn't it normally be the opposite" but then I saw Shirabes hand and realized that Kirika's presumably helping her because of it
If we all choose to believe it then does that make it canon <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
Wait is this actually something that they mentioned
Ahh edgebikki and her Miku are adorable together
There are some really nice ones in that link like Miku presumably telling other Miku some lewd Hibiki-related things
3_skip
Ahh they're so cute. Now I wanna see someone write a fic about that
I want a New Game S3 already <:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
I love the look of that outfit, it just looks so sparkly and pretty
I liked Riko and You, but that's about it <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
Really? interesting. I guess I never thought about it much because I didn't care that much about the Aqours girls
I feel like that's a ship I never really thought about
That's a real cute Yuu right there <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
Oh hey its banana girl
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
Good manga
Is that twintails art? <:KirikaPog:605209108827734017>
<:ChrisPray:672578403156885504>
Chris eating is blessed
Doesnt this imply Chris works out, sounds pretty far fetched tbh
Coincidentally that's also the photo I use as my phone background, though I forget what the source actually is lol
Thats the shot from ep 4 of G
3_skip
Ahh makes sense
Isn't that just from the anime itself
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
Chris using her bow <:KirikaPog:605209108827734017>
Is that Chris and Tsubasa as catgirls? <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
Also that's some nice Miku and Chris up there
~~Step on me please~~
<:HibikiGay:670494484701773845>
Teio!
Wise words
Famous clip?
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
Happy Hibikis, something they both need more of
Ah, no wonder I didn't know. I don't really care about Maria <:Ver:704169051391524875>
Wait who's Mios VA?
Those are some cute girls right there <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
ooh that's a nice miku <:HibikiGay:670494484701773845>

Friendship through superior firepower
I remember watching some of those movies, the way they'd just throw two animals together was hilarious
Damn that's some good Chris art. Her eyes especially are really pretty <:ChrisWave:738169593574719568>
Well either way it's real cute
Wait so which Miku is that
I support this ship <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
<@!203444794737950720> ^
Yousoro!
That's more than I expected, maybe I'll binge it all after I'm done with my semester
How much bandori is there to watch nova
The only idol anime I've seen is basically Love Live since Nova talked about it a lot lol
I gotta check that out at some point
Cute catgirls <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>

AHHHH holy shit they're so good together <:ShirabeHeart:738932033635483738><:KirikaHeart:738932018116821034>

Those are quite the faces they've got there
Good Yuri anime <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
Ooh a S1 Chris
Ooh they all look really pretty <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
Ahh they look so smol and cute
Very true <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
For some reason the thought of Nanoha having a manga never even occurred to me
Their art style is nice, their eyes are really pretty in particular <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
Do they do a lot of Love Live art or something?
Ooh there's some nice Maki up there too
wife*
Friendship through superior firepower <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
Oh yeah looking back at some clips with her I can totally hear her voice
I didn't realize
Wait shes voiced by Aoi Yuuki?
Long haired Hibiki <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>

I'll make sure to watch it soon <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
I saw you post and spent a good minute thinking "wait which Love Live girls are these" before realizing it had nothing to do with that franchise lol
Kirika with some quality fashion as usual
That's a cool looking outfit
I can hear the "Chris-chan!"
Miku's making up for all that lost time with Edgebikki
I mean you do have an animal in your name and pfp <:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
Very edgy, I love it
Long haired Kirika <:ShirabeAwe:698939825113268306>
Ver maybe?
StrikerS <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
That girl looks cute too <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
True, it's still super cute
Is that a Shirabe without the twintails? It feels kinda wrong
Idk how I'm supposed to feel about this one
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
Shamiko <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
Horse girls <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
<:ChrisHappy:660870796696223744>
Long Hair <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
~~I wish Chris would step on me like that~~
Oh damn that's some good art
Or from things that the bot can't source like Screenshots or manga pages
<:ChrisPray:672578403156885504>
I can imagine why they might not have gotten much <:MikuGay:336656810788388864> <:HibikiGay:670494484701773845>
Ooh I like that artstyle, and HibiMiku is always nice too
"Sexist Gungnir" Is that not what it said?
I mean, the only users of Gungnir have all been female, sounds kinda sexist to me <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
That's Yuu not You
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
Long Hair Hibiki <:MikuPraise:585839808765493249>
Oh god it's so wholesome but also <:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
<:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
Also can I just mention how in the pixiv link there's the tag of "bewitching thighs" on that pic
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
Maki
Honoka's dad is literally the only one I can think of
I mean, men don't exist in that anime do they?
<:TomosatoPixel:691727930371342447> ☕
Just find Honoka to fight Ayumu with her kendo skills <:Ver:704169051391524875>
Nova, you're really tempting me here. Do I really wanna go down the hole of SIFAS
This feels cursed
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
Now I kinda wanna read this lol
Wait Honoka is in a kendo club **AND** she's good at it? <:MariaScared:672584661125431299>
*Yousoro!*
Apparently there's a whole page which is hilarious https://love-live-fanon.fandom.com/wiki/Men_in_Love_Live!
3_skip Oh god this feels so weird
Ahhh Yuu looks so pretty <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
<:HibikiGay:670494484701773845>
That's a lotta hibimiku
True, I didn't notice them as much because Chris and Hibiki's shoulders are partially covering them
Chris's zenbus look absolutely huge in that art
<:KanadeWink:690470895608791040>
Miku out here with the pro gay strats<:MikuGay:336656810788388864>
<:MariaScared:672584661125431299> what is she making
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
Teio!
<:MikuBliss:336657233712513024>
Is that handholding I see?
Truly, even though it's never gonna happen, I'd love a S2
Oh hey, spyce art. I feel like I don't see too much of that in here
I just remember her as banana girl too lmao
I thought Kirika too tbh
Those are some really nice looking outfits
<:CarolSmug:617040484111745027>
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
Aren't you a teacher irl nova, I'm down for some Love Live classroom
I'll keep that important information in mind
<:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
That's some nice Maki
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
She needs to go find Nico to warm those hands up <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
So, Hayate is now a basketball playing idol?

<:ChrisHappy:660870796696223744>
Shirabe no put that down
Ooh this looks super comfy
Real cute tho
That's certainly a set of characters I would've never expected to see.
Pat the edgebikki <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
Ooh a Shizuku
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
🍌
Yeah I like how they have the ribbons
<:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
Chris looks absolutely pissed, I really wanna know what's going on there
Ikxi quit being lewd, this is sfw <:MikuDelete:661660028410920990>
Also, there's a lot of good stuff in that pixiv link
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
Wait is that Teio's outfit?
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
Sord
<:TsubasaBliss:672861879000891432>
MIku's face looks terrifying
Who are the two on the far left?
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
NicoMaki
Gen being best dad
Chris looks adorable
Holy shit that's amazing
Idk who she is, but she's cute
large zenbus
Yeah that was
AXZ too now that I think about it
There's also the airship in G although that may be the result of some relic shenanigans rather than future tech
It's only like the 2040s tho, so it's not too far in the future
<:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
Have fun, I thought it was complete trash myself, but apparently it's popular enough to have like 3 seasons so I guess some people like it.
It's Maki which I love, but it's also show by rock which I don't like at all. I'm conflicted <:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
How do I see those?
Ai and Rina are such a good pair
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
Chris about to <:ChrisEnraged:423196924368388105>
Bondage <:CarolSmug:617040484111745027>
Now I'm wondering what all that text says
Maple and Sally are super cute together
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
<:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
<:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
Oh god
<:MikuGay:336656810788388864>
Ahh it's nice to wake up to some wholesome stuff in here
There's a lack of Chris/Miku interactions and it's a tragedy
lol, I'm glad to see a lot of us thought the same
I only realized because I clicked the pixiv and saw the tags
Wait I didn't even realize that was Hibiki at first, I thought it was Chris for a good minute lol
Yeah that one, ty ❤️
Anyone happen to have art of Chris in a cowboy (cowgirl?) outfit? I know it's somewhere in Kerrik's archive but I don't have it downloaded atm.
Chris *is* very smart
NicoMaki <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
This reminds me of some kind of hybrid between Kaos and Koyume from Comic Girls. <:Ver:704169051391524875>
That reminds me I really need to get back to watching Bang Dream
Emma and Karin are some of the Nijigasaki characters that I don't really pay that much attention to.
I feel like I don't see too much art of those two, but they're a really good pair
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
All that HibiMiku up there <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
I remember I got recommended that a long time ago but never got around to it
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
Best Niji girl Yuu
C.C. is great <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
Ooh she's really cute
Is this a missile personified as an anime girl?
That looks very comfy
Ooh, her eyes are pretty
cute couple <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
Very cute
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
I gotta actually finish that anime xD
<:HibikiThink:688429715362414641>
why is kasumi a long cat
Do I even wanna question what's going on there
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
Oh right, I forgot that was gonna be a thing
<:ChrisPray:672578403156885504>
Very true
<:MikuCry:688397678584791074>
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
That just makes them cuter
<:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
<#336297674707828747> is real nice today with all the Maki in here.
Ahhhh she's so cute
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
That's a lot of Maki forms
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
It's probably my favorite pairing from Love Live now that I think about it
<:ChrisPray:672578403156885504>
NicoMaki is good stuff
Maki <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
xD such a great line
<:MikuGay:336656810788388864>
Hibiki carrying her wife
Hayasaka <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
I feel like I've never seen those two together in art
Orca <:TsubasaBliss:672861879000891432>
Very gay <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
<:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
<:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
Ahh fuck that's so sad
I love her eyes
Ooh she's super cute
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
Watch it so you can then have S2 to look forward to
poor Sally
Bofuri is also nice because of Maple x Sally art
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
<:ChrisMunch:688191202973319198>
Poor Mii, Maple probably did something outrageous to her
iirc S2 was set for 2022 so maybe by then it'll be pretty close
I had to google Gawain  because I didn't realize that's what it was called lol
Ahh so it was that
This feels familiar, what's it from?
Pretty eyes <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
I guess that's why she has it then
lmao
Now I'm totally imagining her as some kinda assassin lol
Huh I never noticed, TIL
Wait is it just a common thing to have her with a dagger? Is that in her actual outfit?
<:nade_scared:807880399681617950>
Who's Rice targeting with that knife?
<:MariaScared:672584661125431299>
cute af
I'm a Teio fan myself, but Rice is a close second
She deserves some good headpats
Now that I think about it, that pic reminds me of Aoba from New Game lol
Oooh she's super cute
Where's my New Game S3 <:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
Cool sword
Banana Girl <:MariaScared:672584661125431299>
I feel like the Miku one is the only one I'd recognize because the shoulder things are really distinctive.
Ah
Wait which one is this again?
Nice stuff as well
That's a good one
ye
I wanna read more yuri manga but there's not much out there <:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
I think I read a few chapters of that one
I really gotta get around to the manga one day
Yeah || God damn final scene of those two was heart wrenching though <:MikuSad:336657015961026560> ||
~~same tho~~
<a:holyspray:834889778511609936>
I'm always excited for more anime of cute girls doing things
That's the girls doing ice hockey one right?
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
Theyre such a good couple
She's cute
oof
No idea who they are, but they look cute <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
Cute catgirl
<:MariaScared:672584661125431299>
I feel like all I can see banana girl as is scary
Oh is that what it's a crossover from?
Rika <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
Double Hibiki
Best girl Yuu <:YuuHeart:737647995750973481>
That's a sexy pirate
Chris/Genjuro <:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
I wanna see an adaptation so bad
Go commission some then
Yeah maybe it is just Saten that sucks <:Ver:704169051391524875>
Or vice versa
It's also possible that Uiharu does know, but Saten just sucks and crashed into her lol
Misaka and Kuroko <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
I wasn't a huge fan but it wasn't bad either
Ah, I forgot all about that anime lol
Who
Ah I haven't seen that one
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
Idk who they are, but
Shes cute
HibiMiku is always nice
Lookin real cute
Teio! <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
Best Sunshine girl <:Yousoro:715479194888437811>
<:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
That's a lotta Kasu
I think cheetah Ai is my favorite
They all fit so well too
Oh I only saw the first pic because I was on mobile, I didn't know there were more <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
Damn those are super cute
I always love seeing some Teio in here <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
Ariel is cute
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
Oh wow, I think that's the first time I've seen Uma Musume cosplay <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
I'm so used to reading comics right to left so it took me a sec to figure out what was going on lol
I love seeing nice interactions like this
<:ChrisPray:672578403156885504>
NicoMaki is blessed
I like the twisty hair
Cute <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
Lmao
Maki <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
the what now
This is canon
I would absolutely not trust Tsubasa at all as a doctor <:MariaScared:672584661125431299>
Fate <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
Girls kissing <:KirikaPog:605209108827734017>
She looks like she's about to fuckin murder someone
Holy shit that's cute
Who's body is in the bag, who did Kirika murder?
Long haired Misaka <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
<:ChrisHappy:660870796696223744>
I'd trust her
GuP <:KirikaPog:605209108827734017>
Damn she looks cute
Is that Maki being jealous in the back?
<:HibikiGay:670494484701773845>
<:MariaScared:672584661125431299>
All I can think about when I see her is that she's scary
Misaka and Kuroko <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
I love how they're just super radiant in all the art
sparkly
JUst make your bot accept jpegs
<:SetsuHappy:715459030314647555>

I support this ship too
<:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
Who needs the boring Index MC when you can get the teleporting lesbian instead
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
C.C.
It's so wholesome
<:ChrisMunch:688191202973319198>
same
<:UmiScared:785587961529892894>
<:MariaScared:672584661125431299>
All banana girl pics are scary to me
The only thing I know about that anime is that I see a lot of Yuri fanart from it lol
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
I see a lot of yuri in here
with the paw on the screen
The front left
Ah lol
Although I think I like the cheetah Ai in that art that was posted in here like a week ago more
I think the Ai is my favorite
WHo are the two in the back cat tower
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
Best dad
I mean we know she did running don't we? Unless she also did more
I mean we know Miku has some strong arms from the end of G
<:ChrisBang:702166093065748500>
Hot
Those are some pretty eyes <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
That looks comfy
That's nice too
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
She's cute
Comic Girls is a fantastic anime
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
Documentation? Sorry but I can't read
Banana girl is scary
<:MariaScared:672584661125431299>
Idk what this is but it's cute
<:HibikiGay:670494484701773845>
Shamiko and Momo
What a waste of water
<a:YuCheer:754740038994231346>
I love the faces in the third pic
Its like the first or second week of july isnt it
When does that start btw
<:MikuGay:336656810788388864>
Really cool art tho
<:MariaScared:672584661125431299>
<:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
Abs
Since she's my favorite lol
I just hope there'a a good amount of Rika
Ah true, I'm looking forward to it but I don't have high hopes tbh
That reminds me doesnt the last WEP episode air today
Idk who they are but they look really cute
From what I remember the orange haired one looked cool, but the others didn't appeal much to me. (Though since I don't know what they're actually saying, who knows)
rip
Is there a subbed one, last time I saw it there wasnt
Time to wait and see if I like any of the girls this time around
Chris suffering lol
I like that artstyle
I don't necessarily dislike her, I just liked other members much more
Kuroko!
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095> I'm just not a big fan
NicoMaki is the only reason I like Nico at all
I'm sure handholding was all they were doing there. <:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
<:HibikiGay:670494484701773845> <:MikuGay:336656810788388864>
But also wholesome af
Very lewd
Yeah i'm aware, that doesn't mean she isn't doing something lewd with it tho
what's she about to do with that remote? probably something lewd
Some Kuroko and Misaka up in here <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
<:NicoNicoNii:715458641720901663>
That's a lotta Misaka
<:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
DMJii and HibiMiku look like they're having such a good time. And tiny Chris is just chilling there
Maria what the hell are you doing
Those pancakes look really good
<:MariaScared:672584661125431299>
<:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
Nice Chris
<:ChrisPray:672578403156885504>
<a:YuCheer:754740038994231346>
Teio!
Good horse girls <:ChrisPray:672578403156885504>
<:MikuGay:336656810788388864>
Is banana girl without bananas really banana girl
<:MariaScared:672584661125431299>
I'm not fooled by the innocent look, Banana Girl is scary <:MariaScared:672584661125431299>
Ooh that's a nice design
That's uhh, certainty one I haven't seen before
<:KanonThink:712602427353726976>
Holy shit that's adorable
Yeah I saw the sleeves but couldn't tell if it was the S1 outfit or the Lydian outfit. I had to think for a sec
Is that Chris's S1 outfit? I can't tell
<:KanonRun:860449384370274304>
I'm more of a Riko x You fan but I'll gladly support almost any Yuri <:RikoSmug:715458803570573332>
<:sweaty:839235693699661834>
God damn that Riko tho
<a:YuCheer:754740038994231346>
That's some nice Love Live up there
Good pair <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
Hell yeah
Is there a Kuroko and Misaka getting married tag instead?
I remember seeing that Riko the other day, god she's so hot there
Man they look so fucking cool in those outfits lol
Those are some nice outfits <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
How I look at my McChicken that I'm about to devour tbh
<:RikoSmug:715458803570573332>
Apparently tags say it's Dia x Riko
Is that Riko?
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
<:HibikiThink:688429715362414641>
Who's the 'her' in this convo
Idk much about these two but I totally support it too
Ayy there's one I can get down with
Cute outfit
That reminds me I gotta watch ep 2
NicoMaki is real cute tho <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
I'm conflicted, I really like Kanon but I don't like Keke at all lol <:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
<:MariaScared:672584661125431299>
<:HibikiThink:688429715362414641>
I wonder what it could be
Good girls
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
Sasha <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
Trying to think of how you'd actually use that lol
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
<:MariaScared:672584661125431299>
Fuck that's so cute
There's also that cute girls doing ice hockey anime coming (Though it pretty much definitely isn't gonna be Yuri)
Yu is a good girl
<a:YuCheer:754740038994231346>
<a:AyuPyon:764461994613932087>
Banana girl is scary too <:MariaScared:672584661125431299>
Ayumu is scary
Truly tragic
<:KanonShook:858787780934369300>
<:UmiScared:785587961529892894>
Is that blood on her sword?
Ahhh it's so cute
Push them in and close the door.
<:KanadeWink:690470895608791040>
I like seeing all this Kanade art in here, good stuff
And a hot beverage, looks super comf
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
Comf
It's so sparkly I love it
I've said it plenty of times before, but man Kanade's outfit with Brisingamen looks fucking amazing. It's just so damn cool
I always love seeing some Tsubasa and Chris
<:TsubasaJoy:688191716620238870>
Ooh they look pretty cute together
<:KirikaSmug:607742561414676517>
But it's still great
What a wild crossover, I absolutely love it
ooh Nanoha
I barely even know what that is xD
Idk what any of that was about but it seemed cute
Her smile is precious
She's cute, I like the outfit
Ahh that was cute
Damn that looks impressive
I always loved the outfits in revue, the coats look really fluffy
<:HibikiGay:670494484701773845>
She's adorable I love it
<:ChrisMunch:688191202973319198>
Also those poor girls, put some damn clothes on
Ooh art with the S1 outfits
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
That's super cute
<:HibikiGay:670494484701773845>
They're pretty
I like her eyes
<:GenjuroThumbsUp:336657189475188740>
You know, that could work too
I feel like Hibiki would probably choose Basa
I'd believe it
Chris knows what they're about to go do at home
<:ShirabeHeart:738932033635483738><:KirikaHeart:738932018116821034>
Ok so I saw this and thought that Tsubasa had just an absolutely *HUGE* mouth.
how lewd
<:ShirabeAwe:698939825113268306>
I feel like that outfit is also something Chris would totally wear normally, it's pretty similar to her AXZ(?) outfit isn't it?
Cute Fate <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
Man I'd love one of those plushies but I'm sure even if I could find one it'd be crazy expensive
<:ChrisWave:738169593574719568>
Wholesome af
<:TsubasaYareYare:407397617451139073>
Some random cute girl was dragging me around while I was barely staying upright
That's pretty much how it was the first time I tried roller skating lol
I feel like ice skating would be fun to try though I'd almost certainly suck hard at it.
That's some impressive flexibility
<:ChrisBang:702166093065748500>
Wait I was focused on the face I didn't even notice the outfit lol
Idk who that is but she's adorable
I support Yu x Setsuna, get outta here with your yandere Ayumu
Nice and wholesome with a bit of gay in there. Good stuff
I always like stories where we see Chris dealing with her problems
That was super wholesome i love it
That outfit is cute af
<:HibikiGay:670494484701773845>
<:HibikiGay:670494484701773845>
They look cute together
Interesting
Pomu?
<:SetsuHappy:715459030314647555>
<a:YuCheer:754740038994231346>
<:KirikaShout:607741871703457812>
Oh no her ice cream!
<:ChrisMunch:688191202973319198>
Ahhh it's so damn wholesome
<:ChrisWave:738169593574719568>
Ahh Chris and Miku
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
Kaos is precious
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
Well, still cute
Ah lol
Idk who she is but I really like her vibe
True
That's a lot of chris
<:ChrisWave:738169593574719568>
Idk who they are but pink haired girl is adorable
C.C. cute
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
That's a cute af outfit
<:PanaSob:749356046941814875>
Listen Nova, she's not the most memorable character
It took me a sec to realize that was Hanayo lol, I forgot her eyes were purple
<:HonkBread:715458424854282370>
That's a nice looking honk
Miku being a good wife <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
Hell yeah Homura, kill the evil rat bastard
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
Teio!
Ah, I think i watched like 1 ep of that one, but never continued
<:HibikiGay:670494484701773845>
Idk who these girls are, but they're real cute together
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
Some nice stuff you got there Ikxi
Shamiko and Momo <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
Idk but it's cute
<a:HibikiEatGood:688429714876006520>
Chris with a bow
The green in the hair reminded me of <:YuuShocked:762379673572474960>  for a sec lol
Ooohhh that's super good
<:KirikaPog:605209108827734017>
I'd like to imagine she's cheering for Tsubasa
Chris looks way more enthusiastic than I'd expect her to be wearing a cheerleader costume.
I thought that was a Kyubey hat for a second
That's a super nice outfit
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
Ooh I love Kirika and Shirabes outfits there
<:ShirabeAwe:698939825113268306>
Spiders <:MariaScared:672584661125431299>
Winter is definitely the best season
Chris being a good senpai
Wait that art is in the manga?
~~I mean, considering how most of their parents are~~
<:HibikiThink:688429715362414641>
Finé being there is slightly questionable, but otherwise <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>  they're so cute
<:KanadeLewd:690470896174891008>
Idk who they are but I totally relate to the taller one lol.
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
<:ChrisDJ:690470897194369034>
Damn that's a nice Chris
<:sweaty:839235693699661834>
<:ChrisEmbarrassed:738167509869527060>
<:TsubasaJoy:688191716620238870>
Very true
Ahhh it's so wholesome
I don't care for Keke at all, I just find her really annoying <:KasuShrug:626072720404250669>
The ship I'm going for this season
Strike Witches has a lot of good ships
<:HibikiGay:670494484701773845>
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
It's Silence Suzuka
but I love it <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
That's a crossover I never would've expected to see
<:KanonYo:843630060283494410>
Kanon is super cute
10/10 eyes
<:ChrisBang:702166093065748500>
Lucchini from Strike Witches I think
Potentially Kirika/Shirabe too to some extent since I don't think their life in FIS was very good.
Now I'm sad <:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
Now that I think about it, I wonder if Chris's height is attributable to malnutrition considering her childhood. At least partially.
Chris starts at 16 in S1
The Madoka cast are also younger than Chris too aren't they <:wheeze:837213179380891688>
Chris has the heels tho which makes her seem taller
Chris is smol
155 vs 153 cm
I had to look it up apparently yeah
<:ChrisMunch:688191202973319198>
👀
All the art I've seen in here has me realize that I totally have a thing for long hair
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
Long hair
I like the two lolis outfits from Bofuri https://www.pixiv.net/en/artworks/79914363
I can't wait for S2 of Bofuri
Maple <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
i want some
those headphones are cute as fuck
I'm often reminded that Shamiko isn't her actual name and it throws me off lol
Shamiko <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
NicoMaki is good too
<:MakiFlushed:731393148613427241>
cute Maki
<a:ChrisBaka:670628703734333450>
<:MikuGay:336656810788388864>
That detail is so good
Reminds me of 'Sora no Woto' for some reason
<:HibikiGay:670494484701773845>
Cute horse girls
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
Her? Silence Suzuka from Uma Musume
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
XDU Crossover event when?
<:MiraiZura:715458629234589718>
<:RubyAngry:731393148798107716>
Ariel is cute
<:RikoOfCulture:749327484411183205>
Yohane and Riko is a good pair
Teio! <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
Such a nice Chris
<:ChrisHappy:660870796696223744>
It's Perrine from Strike Witches doing the sword thing from Demon Slayer I believe
I never would've expected to see that lol
I feel like I could totally see her getting hit by truck-kun
<:ChrisHappy:660870796696223744>
Chris deserves some hugs
Hell yeah
Chris eating is real good stuff <:ChrisMunch:688191202973319198>
Uma Musume was crazy in the sense that I was surprised it somehow got a second season but man was that season absolutely amazing. I never expected that I'd want a third
||Now where's S3 where she's the protag? <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594> ||
now i remember
Ahhh her
Who's that again? She is super cute tho
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
The front of that train lookin kinda thicc tho
What is with her face <:MariaScared:672584661125431299>
Ah vivid strike, the one Nanoha I haven't seen
Is she from Nanoha?
Twintails <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
Damn NicoMaki is a good ship and a good hairstyle
ahhh tiny bikki is adorable
Yeah, Kerrik gonna have a lot to add to his archive lol
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
Holy shit she's so cute

she looks so young
Thats a really good Chris right there
<:ChrisHappy:660870796696223744>
Very nice Chris
Huh, I forgot about that lol
Nico being assertive 👀
Adorable
<:ChrisMunch:688191202973319198>
Dang they've got a lot of characters in there, even some of the more minor ones
Teio!
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
Ngl I totally forgot her name for a sec
<:PanaSob:749356046941814875>
<:wheeze:758563748172136478>
I don't like Keke but I'd totally ship them
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
protecc
idk who she is but she looks precious af
She kinda reminds me of Mira from Kenja no Deshi wo Nanoru Kenja
Chris protecc
<:ChrisMunch:688191202973319198>
Ooh she's cute
Best dad indeed
<:KirikaMunch:672599382670966785>
Get the snacks Kirika!
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
ahhhh they're so cute
Is that the one that's based on the outfits they wore at the symphogear live?
Because i removed it

ayyy
~~Wedding gears~~
<:ChrisBang:702166093065748500>
<:ChrisEating:384879395829186560>
I kinda wanna go rewatch the spaghetti scene now
It is kinda interesting tho because in S1 with the Nehushtan armor she was pretty physically active (though maybe that's part of the armors ability now that i think about it) who knows <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
<:ChrisEating:384879395829186560>
Ooh that's a cute dress
<:HibikiFingerguns:688429715836502063>
<:ChrisEating:384879395829186560>
I mean, Chris looks fine with it
Why does Shirabe look so terrified
<:ChrisPray:672578403156885504>
Art of Chris eating is always a blessing
oh wait the red haired one on the left is from revue isn't she
Kasumi is the only one i recognize lol
I forgot about Saint Snow lol
<:RikoOfCulture:749327484411183205>
ooh Riko
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
ayyy
<:MakiBlep:774326100552712202>
Now there just needs to be a Maki there to warm her up
ahhh carol is so good
Damn they're cute <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
NicoMaki being super cute is the only reason I like Nico at all
I was about to ask if that was Precure but then I saw the #precure in the post
Throw Hibiki in there and you've got some real intense befriending going on
Ooh Nanoha and Madoka
Edgebikki and Miku interactions are so good
Holy shit she's adorable
Chris's hoodie looks comfy
Is that a fluffy Chris I see? <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
It took me a sec to realize who that creature in the back was
<:YumiPoint:688429724103344164>
Having no context to this, yeah that absolutely looks like a door
Oh god <:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
At least with A-RISE I remember Tsubasa. I don't remember any other the other rival groups names tho lol
What's her name again btw Nova, I honestly forgot
<:TsubasaBliss:672861879000891432>
Fluffy Chris
They look dope tho
I forget the name of the saint snow girls
Lmao my exact thoughts
<:MikuYay:588083917207109636>
Hibiki and Edgebikki art is always nice to see
Ooh she's cute, that outfit is cool too
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
C.C.
ahhhhh the Chris there is super adorable
That looks pretty cool tho
<:ShirabeConcern:586404485598019604>
Tsubasa and an Orca. Very nsfw
I mean, at least it's not the most cursed tsubasa pic out there 🐳
Oh my god she's adorable
Is this some befriending I see?
Which reminds me, ~~Uma Musume global version when~~
I'm a Teio fan myself, but Rice is a very good horse too <:CarolSmug:617040484111745027>
<:HibikiMunch:672606446239744000>
Is that Rice Shower in a rice maker?
i know i see webp a lot when i grab random images from google searches.
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
<:TsubasaIgnite:672861877407318047>
But memes aside, that's cute af
<:MikuBliss:336657233712513024>
Handholding
Yeah since I didn't have the full context I only vaguely understood the event.
I'll have to look at that tomorrow
👀
<:ChrisPray:672578403156885504>
i remember reading through the bayonet stuff but there was a bunch of stuff i didnt understand since i think i was supposed to read some other events first
<:wheeze:758563748172136478>
lmao i didn't even notice the shirabe
One of these days I need to properly read the XDU stuff so I can see the AU Basa/Chris events
Ooh Ponytail, I like how it still splits into the four strands
<:ChrisHappy:660870796696223744>
Well, I love seeing any Chris but
I always love seeing Fluffy Chris
<:TsubasaBliss:672861879000891432>
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
That's a lotta dess
<:MakiBlep:774326100552712202>
Still cute tho
Maki on the other hand not so much imo
Oh hey <:KirikaPog:605209108827734017>
~~Wait so who's bigger, do we even know adult Carol's size?~~
Hibiki wearing Miku's bow is something I never even thought about. Is there any Miku with Hibiki's hair clips?
Looking back at the first ep now that I rewatched a bit of S1 I think I see what you mean. The backgrounds in particular definitely feel a lot less detailed.
It just started airing today
https://anilist.co/anime/132806/Restaurant-to-Another-World-2/
Does it not look as good as S1? I can't really tell the difference <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>  If anything it looks better than i expected it to
I'm rewatching some isekai shoukudou right now so I can refresh my memory a bit now that S2 is here. They're cute <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
<:ChrisBang:702166093065748500>
Doesn't that kid have one too many legs in that pic <:NoiseTea:688192213762572295>
Is that about how Aoi Yuki voiced Eevee?
<:HibikiGay:670494484701773845>
that looks like some really good gay
She's so precious
Like, not even as a ship, but I absolutely love seeing Miku/Chris interactions as friends. It's just such a wholesome relationship.
MikuChris is good
Hibiki probably deserved it
<@203444794737950720>
<:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
Poor Chris
<:MikuCute:672908542763859968>
Hibiki is truly an angel
Ahhh such a cute Chris
Plus Miku stopped doing track awhile ago
Ahh there's so much good stuff up here. All the nice Nanoha content, Chris being adorable, wholesome Carol/Elfnein stuff
I need to catch up on Superstar, I'm pretty behind
They are really cute however <:HibikiGay:670494484701773845>
I feel like I've seen them in here before but i forget where they're from
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
ooh, she's really cute
It blended in with my discord background and I skipped over it lol
Oh wait I didn't even notice this one
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
That's some good stuff Ikxi
<:TsubasaBliss:672861879000891432>
Fate
Same, they deserve to be happy
NanoFate is good <:CarolSmug:617040484111745027>
<:NicoSmug:749327484511846580>
<:ChrisPray:672578403156885504>
NanoFate is blessed
<:HibikiGay:670494484701773845>
d4dj was the one with all the 3d right?
<:YuuHeart:737647995750973481>
Yu and her harem
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
The art I see of them is always really cute
<:CarolSmug:617040484111745027>
That's some nice Teio
👀
<:CarolSmug:617040484111745027>
Carol lookin 10/10
Damn that's good
<:HibikiGay:670494484701773845>
Someone about to get befriended
<:ChrisHappy:660870796696223744>
That's a lotta cute art up there
~~She's probably used to having her on a leash~~
Anyone know what Miku is saying?
<:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
Now I'm imagining Miku as Mako in that one scene yelling at her to get naked
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
<:MikuSnap:688429722249855020>
I didn't even realize anything was off at a first glance lol
The girl in black kinda reminds me of Nero from Black Clover
I feel like I never notice these things
Wait I didn't even realize the costume change lol.
<:ChrisPray:672578403156885504>
I'd totally buy a pair
Ahhhhh she's so cute
She's been through a lot, she absolutely does deserve tons of happiness
That's a super nice Chris, I love the eyes
Cute <:CarolSmug:617040484111745027>
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
~~Oh hey it's Maple~~
Now that's quite something
<:ChrisEating:384879395829186560>
The absolute best kind of Chris art
Ooh cute
<:HibikiPing:688397678421344268>
Did she finally snap after her manga got rejected again?
<:MariaScared:672584661125431299>
Watcha got there Kaos
Kaos is adorable
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594> <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594> <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
If I ever do commission art, Chris eating is pretty high up there on the list of things I may choose.
Blessed Kaos
<:ChrisPray:672578403156885504>
I love them
They're so gay
<:HibikiGay:670494484701773845>
I see. She looks cute so I'll support that, why not
What's Guilty Gear? <:Ver:704169051391524875>
What's BlazBlue?
Who's the blonde?
one of these days i'll catch up with it
<:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
<:ChrisHappy:660870796696223744>
i like it, it's a bit messy looking but also fluffy looking
that's quite the hair she has
ah, i'm only like vaguely aware of evangelion
I remember seeing that, ~~Not that i know what the spear is tho~~
she looks terrifying
<:MariaScared:672584661125431299>
Then again I guess there's not much distinguishable about her other than her outfit
I feel like I don't see too much AU Basa art by herself. It's usually with fluffy Chris
that scarf looks comf
Not the Fluffy Chris I'm used to but it's a good fluffy Chris regardless

Wasn't there a pirate event in xdu? Is that what this is from?

Damn that's good
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
i cant even tell what her weapon is supposed to be
Also, MikuChris <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
They fit those outfits well
I like the (presumably Misaka) dressed gekota
Kuroko is cool
<:TsubasaBliss:672861879000891432>
Those eyes look super good, plus they're purple which I love too
that dress is cool af
That's super cool art tho
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
Oh god the suffering would be too much
ayy team traffic lights
I'd vote Miku too tbh
Tsubasa feels like the last person who'd be good as a maid lol
~~All the girls i knew irl who played volleyball were really hot~~
Volleyball is nice
She looks so sad with Shirabes gear lol
<:TsubasaBliss:672861879000891432>
Twintails art
Wholesome af
Carol in a cute magical girl outfit is good <:CarolSmug:617040484111745027>
I like how the propellors are just thrown on top.
All I can think about is a video I saw of Inori Minase singing the Sailor Moon OP. The only thing I could imagine was Carol in a Sailor Moon outfit singing it.
Makes sense, VA's aren't something that usually come to mind when seeing art unless it's characters that I'm more familiar with the VA's for.
Huh, that's a combo of characters i never would have imagined lol
I see Fate but who's the other girl
Horse girl on ice?
<:TsubasaBliss:672861879000891432>
Long Hair
is that actually the explanation
Isn't that a thing in XDU
I feel like basa/hibiki is a ship i've seen practically none of
<:TsubasaBliss:672861879000891432>
All the art I see of Mordred is always cute af
Poor Einhart
Sporty look <:TsubasaBliss:672861879000891432>
I literally know nothing about it except that I've heard the name here and there.
No idea who she is, but she looks cute
That Carol is super cool and all, but i gotta ask. Wtf is that in the background
<:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
Is that really considered a skill when she destroys all the motorcycles?

Ooh that pic of Miku doing the high jump is nice, I don't think I've seen it before
<:ElfneinAAA:672437636362665984>

Character progression <:ChrisHappy:660870796696223744>
S1 is mostly just the communicator things isn't it? Which I mean I guess are phones but
Actually now that I think about it, how often do we actually see anyone using a phone in gear
Good shit

I usually see announcements, read a few lines to see if it's relevant. Then ignore it
Hibiki and edgebikki interactions are always nice

I can't wait for S2
Bofuri is nice because they're all cute

Is that a sword in the drink that Tsubasas comes with?
<:ShirabeStare:582381430915596289>
I just noticed the pic they used for Shirabe, nice choice there
Now we can overdose on linker irl just like Kirika!
One of these days I want to go to Antarctica irl (partly because of that anime lol)

If I remember right the XDU card that pic is from is called "The ring of promise" or something along those lines

God damnit
Some of them I was just left thinking "What the hell is this purple blob with a swirly? What could it mean?"
Yeah, Ai, Karin, and Setsuna I think are the only ones I guessed.
I didn't even know they had icons (though I'm not really surprised they do) I feel like I can at least guess a few of them, but some I have no clue who they could be for.
is that <:ShioSmile:750932013556432896> <:LanzhuPray:871436512397520916> <:MiaTPose:793598918411288587> ?

Now that i think about it, doesn't Riri use a Gungnir as her weapon?
The Maria and Chris one reminds me of that one memoria where maria is giving Chris a lap pillow
I didn't even notice Maria had Tsubasas hair at first. Tsubasa with cat ear hair works surprisingly well though.
what's the Chris to the left of the top right plushies head? Is that a Chris with glasses?

Regardless of the reason though, it is super cute
Why is Tsubasa carrying Shirabe? Anyone  know moonrunes and can elaborate?
<:HibikiGay:670494484701773845>
That totally sounds like something Tsubasa would say lol

love live and sonic?
well we've got drunk serena in xdu, so i assume its basically that
well, i was looking at japan law which is apparently 20 according to a google search. Though who knows, gear is in the 2040s so maybe its changed by then
who can drink in gear? Is it just Maria?
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
ooh cute girls
HibiMiku good

Usually Chris is the one in the middle, what a nice changeup
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
Somehow the ponytail feels like an attachment to her head. It just kinda feels like it doesn't belong.
She's got cool hair
NanoFate <:ChrisPray:672578403156885504>

Looks too happy, where's the suffering?
Lelouch looks super handsome there lol
Ooh cute outfit

C.C. good
it is, the fight scenes were great too. Rinne beating the fuck outta the bullies was 10/10
StrikerS does have its share of problems but personally it's my favorite season (Though that does seem to be an unpopular opinion lol)
tbh i don't even remember vivid too well, i remember a lot more from vivid strike since i watched it somewhat recently
<:HibikiThink:688429715362414641>
Vivid Strike was better than i thought it'd be

Ah, is that game stuff?
are the other two costumes from something? I don't recognize them
is the one on the right from uma musume?
I mean, I literally know absolutely nothing at all about it, so I'm covered there with ignoring the fandom <:HibikiFingerguns:688429715836502063>
Sounds like a confusing weapon
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>

Same, that's a cute nature girl right there
im pretty sure i'd get kicked out of the kitchen if my culinary teacher saw me holding a knife like that lol
Maria is stopping her
also, is she peeling a banana with that? That just raises more questions
<:ShirabeConcern:586404485598019604>
kirika what the fuck, that's a super dangerous way to hold a knife
That's unexpected, but I love it
Maybe normal ice skating is just too easy for them so they had to make it harder
Volleyball <:TsubasaBliss:672861879000891432>
Sally in diving gear is art i never expected to see

Hibiki got that style with the louis vuitton purse lol
I like the hoodie
blue dress is cute too, i like the flower straps

Hibiki with the drip

<:TsubasaBliss:672861879000891432>
Long hair good

Is this an Uma Musume thing? It gives off those vibes lol
<:MariaScared:672584661125431299>
She's not wearing a seatbelt
The girl shaking while barely staying upright would totally be me if I tried ice skating. I'd love to give it a shot some time.

Oh god

"bluenette"
That's some nice hair

It really does feel like Chris would totally act just like that lol
Yeah shirabe totally taught her
Yeah shirabe skates around all the time in her gear, and in the (AXZ?) OP we see her on roller skates
I didn't expect it xD
Oh wait I think it's art by the actual artist. Makes more sense
Nice 👌
Idk who she is but I like the vibe here
Kirika being a fashion icon as usual

Such a wholesome image
yeah, i didnt pay attention to that detail
I didn't even notice it was Edgebikki
I don't even remember Maria's outfits

Maria was blonde in some early character designs
ah right, blond maria almost existed

<:ChrisEating:384879395829186560>
i thought she had spaghet in her mouth for a sec
That's an interesting style to see them in

hard to find a high quality img tho
I tried
Is that a hint of Shirabe next to Tsubasa?
Tsubasa has a really cool outfit
Also, why isn't it a fighter jet? Sounds like one to me
Yeah but, "That's a cute twin-engine stealth attack aircraft" doesn't sound as good.
Henkei Shoujo is the only plane girl I'll accept
"That's a cute fighter jet" isn't a sentence I thought I'd be saying
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
Oooh Lelouch and C.C.
Ooh adorable Chris
I've said it a lot before, but spaghet scene is one of my favorites in the whole series.
<:ChrisEating:384879395829186560>
<:ChrisHappy:660870796696223744>
You could say that in S1 she's been through some shit, but she's softening up a bit in G now that she has her place to belong.
Yeah that is pretty similar now that I compare them
I was gonna say it reminded me more of her AXZ or XV outfit
Shirabe's outfit looks like something Chris would wear almost
there's some pretty lewd stuff in this
Also, <a:AlySweats:770160546041167885>

I reject this reality and support YouxRiko instead
I completely forgot that anime was a thing lol

For a sec I thought this was Honoka and Umi from Love Live lol
Ah I didn't even realize
Now that's a look

I wanna see her making more friends!
I'd love another season of that, but I guess I'll settle for 'Bocchi the Rock' which is close enough xD

That's an interesting pairing
I know we've got Tsubasa as a witch with Nana voicing Vanessa in Black Clover
Long hair good

S1 outfit is probably one of my least favorite chris outfits
ooh pretty eyes

ooh glasses too
all in one
G is probably my favorite, it's a super comfy looking hoodie and also a cute dress
aww the one with Shirabe is super cute
I mean, the time I watched it was pretty much before I really thought about VA's while watching something.
I never realized Iguchi voiced that lol
https://twitter.com/ao_s_room/status/1518123521805008896 Poor Nyaos-sensei
I loved Vivid Strike, Fuuka was super cool
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
Good Girl
Wait I just realized, ~~I guess it all makes sense now seeing Chris drinking milk all the time~~
Chris with a bow <:TsubasaBliss:672861879000891432>

Miku and Chris, such a great pair with a tragic lack of character interactions
I just like the color purple <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
Ahh I love Edgebikki so much
Clearly it's all about efficiency, they just wear each others stuff because it's more cost effective
Abs

Ooh, Kirika looks cute with that hair style
<:ShirabeDrool:688429716557791326>
Ooh, long haired Kirika in a dress
Why is Tsubasa on an Elephant
3_skip The art style reminds me of the MC in 'Death is the only ending for the Villainess' Like, I could totally see that in a villainess Manhwa lol

Chris absolutely deserves that happiness
<:KirikaPog:605209108827734017>
I remember reading somewhere that one dub (maybe it was German) made them sisters
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
Those two are the ones that are totally together aren't they?
<:MariaScared:672584661125431299>
gay af, nice
<:CarolSmug:617040484111745027>

Wait why is Maria horrified?
Noooo the ice cream
I like the whole vibe here, the black dress, the green eyes and white hair, good stuff
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
~~I don't see any cat ears, I wonder who that is on the right~~
The chopsticks one is a mood though, those things are complicated <:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
<:HibikiFingerguns:688429715836502063>
So basically they're soulmates
Not like that's stopped anyone in anime before
I mean <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
I'd ship them
Which reminds me i still need to finish superstar
I support it
Mio has the same VA as Maria? Interesting
What an unexpected combo lol
Is that Fate and Mio?
Somehow my thought process when seeing that was, "Huh, that's an interesting combo. Maybe it feels so weird because it seems like she should be in a blue gear. Well, there isn't even a blue gear so. Oh wait <:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089> "
She looks pissed
ahhh tiny kanade is adorable
She looks cool and cute there
<:CarolSmug:617040484111745027>
<:KanonYo:843630060283494410>
I need to finish Superstar
I agree with the person who brought up Xtreme Vibes in the comments. I'm totally expected to see them when i watched xv and was surprised not to.

So reverse Isekai?
That looks dope as fuck
Ooh a sword too
She really does have 10/10 fashion sense
I love her so much
<:TsubasaBliss:672861879000891432>
Sparkly Kanade
Did they ever get an amalgam version in XDU?
<:ShirabeDrool:688429716557791326>
I love seeing Kirika in a dress. Like, her usual casual outfits are already really great, but the cuteness of her being in a dress is something else.
Kirika lookin 10/10
<:HibikiMonch:688190074646691843>
Hibiki is eating a bit too much rice it seems
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
A rarepair but a good pair
I'll just watch some Shirabe, that's all I need as a reference right?
I'd love to try it one day but I have 0 clue how I'd do that lol
Ice skating looks fun
<:CarolSmug:617040484111745027>

3_skip It's better to not think about it too much. I'll just watch things
<:HibikiThink:688429715362414641>
I've basically decided that I'm not really gonna bother thinking about the watch order anyway when I do check out Fate. I'm just gonna say fuck it and watch em in whatever order they released in
<:MariaScared:672584661125431299>
oh god

I've said it before but Chris definitely takes the award for best character growth imo
<:ChrisPray:672578403156885504>
thinking about it, there really are a lot of parallels you can draw between those characters

Kirika's 10/10 fashion
Dunno what's going on here but it looks cool
great anime <:CarolSmug:617040484111745027>

<:CarolSmug:617040484111745027>
Still very cute tho

kirika and her 10/10 fashion
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
3_skip she could replace this girl from 'Villains are Destined to Die'
She looks like she'd fit right into an otome Isekai Manhwa with that art style lol
If Hibiki is the one using Nehushtan then does that mean Chris has Gungnir? Following that logic, Chris x Miku? <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
she can hold so many hands with those
Since Shirabe has the whole roller skates thing going on, skis totally seems right for Kirika
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>

All the purple <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
i'm pretty sure in some areas you'd need a permit to buy something that high lol
but yeah I'm surprised that something like that would even be drinkable. I'm pretty sure I'd need to handle that in a hood if I was using it for anything.
that's usually isopropyl alcohol tho isnt it
Isn't that nearly pure ethanol at that point

I wouldn't look nearly as cute as that girl, but I'd totally wear that too
Fuuka good
I really love Kirika in this one
if evil why hot
she seems cool
Miku Chris <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
Sparkly Kanade is my favorite outfit of hers
It's crazy how much kanade art there can be when she died in ep 1
Cute girls with big hats <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
Someone's about to get fucked up <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
Ooh, I like her vibe
I ship it
Based on their twitter, I'm guessing Kurama from Yu Yu Hakusho
They look comf
I like the fluffy looking socks
And who would that be?
Good girls too
Ooh, that's a nice art style
Kirika just absolutely lovestruck looking at shirabe
Also I just wanna say again that Kirika is a fashion icon, her outfits are always 10/10
~~Except the writers were too cowardly to actually do it~~
<:ShirabeDrool:688429716557791326>

I didn't even notice the ice xD
Ooh, I love her vibe. The flowers and other plants everywhere, the pretty blue eye, cute sparkly outfit. Good stuff

Fluffy Chris is good
Isn't that just AU Chris
I always like seeing wholesome Genjuro/Chris stuff
Chris secretly wants to do it too but is too shy to say it
Now there's an edgy basa
Ooh she's so pretty
<:KirikaPog:605209108827734017>

That's a massive OSHA violation there. No railing? No safety harness being up that high? Those shoes don't seem appropriate. Just a disaster waiting to happen

I wouldn't count on a clear victory with NV. Even if Biden does win it, I wouldn't be surprised if there's a shitshow with complaints about mail in ballots and recounts.
I'd consider voting if there was candy as an incentive tbh
Wait Trudeau said that? Damn
Is it normal to have slim margins? I never pay attention to that kinda thing since I dont really believe in democracy
That's a pretty slim margin
Regardless of who wins, there's probably gonna be a recount anyway for Georgia with how close the margins are
Because if they call it then it ends. Why would they wanna lose that viewership
PiS?
Melua seeing your name in purple is throwing me off, I'm not used to it lol

Is it common to have vote counts with a difference of a few thousand in a state? Idk what the margins for this kinda thing have been like in past elections.

I mean if there's an alien society advanced enough to produce space faring technologies that would allow them to come here then I'd wager they could do better at managing my life then I could.
I mean the more likely scenario would be them introducing new even deadlier diseases
An alien invasion would be pretty neat
I absolutely support mysterious monoliths appearing in random places. Considering what the news is usually like, it's refreshing to see some stuff like that.

Yeah apparently there's more widespread outages than I thought
Since it was near an AT&T building there were some communications affected as well and from what I've heard emergency services might have had some issues due to that. So there's no telling if there may have been casualties as a result. One of my friends apparently didn't have service for several hours because of it.
O shit I had no idea that happened in Nashville
jesus
Wait holy shit is this an actual article and not satire?
We're an awful state, that's why

I guess I'm a bit out of the loop here, what's Parler? And why is this important?
But think of all the extra organs you'd have

I didn't know hand cycling was a thing that even existed, the more you know

Wait, are people crying for regulations after the gamestop thing?
Somewhat off topic, but I can understand K-12, but why do institutions of higher education need relief money? Don't they get enough from things like tuition?
<:ZweiHug:672455346949980170>
I mean maybe I'm just cynical, but it feels like the main purpose of schools in the US is to profit as opposed to actually educate.
I wonder if there's any way to claim ownership of debris like that if it lands on your property. Although I'm sure there's all sorts of laws and FAA stuff saying that you can't.
There was once a huge truck that crashed in front of my house. I definitely took a few souvenirs.
It's crazy how much safety regulations there are for planes to be able to operate under certain conditions, but it makes sense for there to be that many. From what I understand a lot of those regulations are a result of: Aviation accident happens -> Look for why it happened -> Now make new rules to prevent that from happening again.

What's with the fact of the percentages not adding up to 100%? Was there a third option that was something like 'indifferent'?

Although it is worth noting that there could be tuna but it's so processed they can't easily detect it. ""“There’s two conclusions. One, it’s so heavily processed that whatever we could pull out, we couldn’t make an identification,” a lab spokesperson explained. “Or we got some and there’s just nothing there that’s tuna.” NYT spoke with a tuna expert who pointed out that the protein can be difficult to identify once it becomes broken down after being cooked."

So in other words, a company that's massively in debt has caused an environmental disaster?
My university had a building named after Nathan Bedford Forrest which they apparently appealed to change the name of to the state but were repeatedly denied.
I know Blizzard isn't the best company but Jesus, I never expected it to be that bad
Plus I don't think MTSU itself is even bothering pursuing it anymore
Yeah, especially since iirc you need the Tennessee Historical Commission to approve it and that's not happening it seems
I wonder if there's potential for other things bearing Forrest's name to be removed. Though I doubt it

By not viewing the videos on YouTube, there's less of a chance that people will click on more YouTube videos causing lost revenue for YouTube I assume.
I pretty much always default to 'they' when referring to people because I have a tendency to avoid using people's names because I'm afraid that I'll mess them up.
I mean fuck corporations and all yeah, but I feel like YouTube does kinda have a fair reason there from what I understand.
I remember i had to provide proof of some vaccinations before i could be approved to live on campus at my college. Though that's a bit of a different scenario i imagine.

I wonder if something like that will actually hold up in a court.
i mean if you're making a face like that guy, then i dont think that's "normal" tbf
I wonder if most people watching that even know what an nft is

There may be some stuff about crossing state borders depending on the crime but

"Currently a doctor or doctors need to be involved to prescribe the sodium pentobarbital and to confirm the person’s mental capacity. We want to remove any kind of psychiatric review from the process and allow the individual to control the method themselves. "

Man 2014, it feels like that was so more recent than 7 years ago
That makes sense too
Some college makes sense at least thinking about student loan debt. They likely incurred the debt to go those few years, but didn't gain any degree making them worse off than those who didn't go to college at all.
So of the lowest decile there for wealth, 40% of them are college educated? Or am I reading that wrong? What's the reason for so many in the lowest decile, but the other ones are as you'd expect? Student loan debt?
Oh god

I remember my college having a building named after a KKK member, trying to change its name got the state court involved. I imagine an army base would be even worse with all the hoops you'd have to jump through.
I mean there are movies I wish I saw in theaters because I know they have great music and it probably would've been a better experience than watching at home
oh im sure there are
I'm not too familiar with how school boards work, but having gone to school in Tennessee, I can say for sure I've read stuff with a lot worse language like 'To Kill a Mockingbird' for example. I imagine that whatever one decides to approve or ban isn't consistent at all across counties. (Which is probably a problem as well)
America's education system aside, it is worth noting that this is just a decision made by a single county's school board which doesn't even have 1% of the states population.
Is it for the same reason it was last time?
I'm out of the loop, what is Gumroad?

"The social media company is also temporarily allowing some posts that call for death to Russian President Vladimir Putin or Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko, according to internal emails to its content moderators."
I mean if that's true that's kinda sketchy. Sure Russia is bad and all right now, but do we really want Facebook deciding who to allow hate speech against?
But yikes, it also looks real bad seeing how low stuff like the education budget is compared to the police.
Aren't they pretty similar, they both light up homes of poor people.
What is this a chart of, there's no label on the y axis.
I really hope he does follow through on releasing that manilla envelope

Yeah the cops job is to protect the law not protect you.
Yikes
I mean makes sense
Iirc the rule is something like to end a debate you need 60% of the vote. So in order to block bills that would normally pass with 50% of the vote, you basically stand up there and talk for hours to delay it from being voted on.

I don't really see the logic in having a special alert just for violence against law enforcement. But then again it's not that surprising it's a thing
Didn't know TN had a special alert for that. Don't think I ever got one
tennessee bureau of investigation I assume. I'm guessing a blue alert is like a notice put out about some criminal
Public Transit <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>

Can't say I'm surprised knowing Tennessee
I thought this was in the shitposting channel than I realize fuckin Ted Cruz tweeted it. Like, why tho
Knowing Tennessee, I'm more surprised they're trying to end it
Glancing through the report a bit, it feels like the conclusion is more so "There's no available evidence that trans women have an advantage, but there's also not much data"
Genuinely surprised because knowing how Tennessee is, I would've totally expected people to pushback against that.
Yeah who is FTX Digital Markets and why are they getting their assets frozen

The fact that they like consistently rank near the bottom for sanitation in their locations makes me never wanna go there

Yeah wtf, monkey labor is a thing?
what a sad response
I'm surprised i've never heard of that one. The only one i really knew of is libgen
Huh, interesting. I didn't know that
Wait what? Anime casting on Twitter?
Seems like an interesting situation. The kids do have a point that if you can drive, work, pay taxes, etc. Why can't you vote?
I don't think any invaders would have a chance. I mean, Japan has a gundam
Yeah that kinda sucks about America. Whevever i move im gonna have to make sure that where i go has good public transit.
Yeah when I think about how I'd have to pay for the car itself, gas, maintenance, insurance, etc. and then think about how i only pay like $40 a month for a bus pass. I have no desire to get a car at all.
1500 animals in 4 years, jesus thats crazy. As someone who works in a lab, I can confirm you're 100% gonna cause fuckups if you try to rush things. Causing fuckups by rushing things involving living creatures though? That's even worse
I mean with all the data that gets scraped for this kinda stuff, I'd totally assume it'd pull real citations
~~There's already Florida to take that spot tho~~
So if there were things from Russia I wanted to buy, now would be a good time because it'd be cheaper?
I mean, we also don't know what happened before the video. If they were asked to leave the train and refused then i'd say the police could be merited
The tweet says "emotional support dog" so I assume not
I think you could make the argument that the animal poses a health risk tbh. If that's the "right" thing to do can be debated, but I don't see any issue unless i'm missing something
I mean, just looking at this at a glance, Amtrak seems well within their rights to kick them off
The way I see it, the removal was justified by Amtrak's policy. Maybe debatable sure but ultimately that's for Amtrak to decide 🤷
If I go to a store, and violate some policy and they ask me to leave and I refuse, what is the store supposed to do? Just let me stay there? I'd say getting the cops to remove me is valid.
Assuming that she was asked to leave, and refused, what she did to merit that action in the first place doesn't really matter.
So does that mean I can cause a disturbance on a train, refuse to leave, and they can't do anything? Again, we have no clue what happened before this video, staff could have tried to deescalate already
I don't see another option than escalating
So if there's a passenger that refuses to leave when asked by staff, what should the response be then? I can't imagine the staff are allowed to force them off
Refuse to leave the train?
I mean, while they could have done that, it's also possible that staff *were* called and after that didnt work it escalated to police. We don't know
Then what is it?
By violating their policy and refusing to leave? Presumably making the train delayed?
I mean idk what you expect me to say here. The company? From what I see, it honestly does not matter. The response from the cops was warranted by the refusal to leave. The company has the power here, and from my understanding it's basically considered trespassing at that point which would merit the cops. Maybe I'm wrong there but that's how I see it.
Yeah I'm not sure I agree there
Isn't it basically trespassing at that point if they refused to leave? Are staff supposed to force them out instead of the cops?

that's quite something lmao
holy shit
that's wild

Yeah after finishing the show, idk how I feel about it. I can't say I was a big fan of the whole deeper plot they presented, but I did enjoy a lot of the characters interactions with each other. I guess it just wasn't my cup of tea.
Damn, just got to the episode with Hatoko's speech
Maybe I'll give the actual show a watch so I can see the context
Oh god I think I remember seeing that scene somewhere
I typically have a few seasonal animes on my watchlist that aren't really the kind of thing I'd normally go for that usually end up being pretty good. But sometimes inbetween waiting for new episodes, I just wanna relax and see some cute wholesome stuff but it's hard to find new stuff these days.
I just want some nice and wholesome Slice of Life/CGDCT anime, but I feel like I've watched so much at this point it's getting hard to find things I haven't seen.
Where do y'all generally look to find new anime to watch? Are there any resources you'd recommend for finding new titles to check out?
The issue I have with just looking at what others are talking about it that it's mostly just really popular shows or seasonal shows. So I end up missing out on stuff that might've aired a few years ago, but was still pretty good for example.
I was gonna ask if you had any Yuri recommendations since that seems to be mostly what you watch lol. I'm always up for expanding my horizons.
I remember watching Kiniro Mosaic not paying much attention,then just getting blindsided with the ayaya scene because I didn't realize it was from this anime.
Chris actually had one of my favorite character developments out of any of the characters. Though I may be a bit biased since I just really like Chris <:ChrisHappy:660870796696223744>
Didn't Maria ||straight up murder some people at one point||
Kirika and Shirabe really got cheated out of better stories imo
Writing aside, I do feel like the action sequences definitely got cooler as the seasons went on at least. XV has some damn cool fights.
Right?
When Maria was giving her speech to the world
Yeah I can definitely see how it could feel just kinda thrown in there for no reason.
Yeah
I think part of it for me is that after a couple seasons of all the gears and relics thrown at me, GX had something new to play with.
Don't crucify me, but I kinda liked GX a lot tbh
XV is kinda low on my list of favorite seasons tbh, it had a lot of good aspects, but a lot of what drove the plot like ||Noble Red and Fudou|| for example just weren't interesting.
Damn, you're gonna make me cry again and I'm not even watching it
After ep 10, the emotional impact really ramped up
Oh yeah, I fuckin cried a lot after that one too
Which one was 11 again? I forget
Oh god *that* episode
No idea what it's about from the trailer, but it looks pretty cool. Maybe I'll give it a watch at some point.
Damn, I was not expecting that to be the kinda show that ||I'd end up in tears at the end||
Granbelm has been really interesting so far, ty to whoever mentioned it earlier
Wait, that manga is getting an anime?
Yeah I learned that the other day when I tried playing lol
I tend to skip openings a lot so I hardly remember any of them
Oh wait, I didn't notice one of them was Assassination Classroom, I have seen that one though I don't remember the opening song lol. And while I've never watched it, i think I have Voracity on my playlist.
Interesting, I have no idea what any of those are.
Is Tsubasa not a Harem MC?
Comic Girls is wholesome af, one of my favorites
Even though I just watched it recently, I might give Granbelm a rewatch to see what all there is to notice now that I know about all the stuff we learn in the later episodes.
Synopsis for Amanchu looks interesting, think I'll add that one to my list <:ChrisHappy:660870796696223744>
I need more SoL animes to watch, I feel like I've watched so many already, but I also know there's a ton I haven't seen yet too.
I gotta search for something to watch next, I don't really have much on my list that I feel like starting rn.
Well,  after 12 episodes I still don't really know what I just watched, but I did enjoy it. I feel like there's probably a lot of symbolism and depth that's there, but I don't know what any of it means.
I'm actually really liking the story so far, and since I used to be in the geology department, all the rocks are interesting as well.
I've had a couple people recommend Land of the Lustrous to me and heard a few things about it, but idk how I'm feeling about this animation style though. Maybe it'll grow on me as I watch more.
I hope it gets another season at some point, I'd love to see a lot of what I just read animated
To whoever was mentioning the Machikado Mazoku manga awhile ago, I had forgotten about that show, ty. Damn, what a read tho. ||They're so gay for each other and I love them||
I finished watching all of the nice and wholesome Slice of Life CGDCT anime I had on my watchlist. Now I gotta search for more <:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
Why does Invisible girl from MHA get a trash rating
Yeah I can't even see a single thing in that image lol
It's because if Chris was there, there wouldn't be a need to even bother ranking the rest
Bookworm was really good this week, I can't wait to know how things are gonna progress next week. With all the mention about it  in this episode, I hope we can see ||Myne using some actual magic||
Jeez, I feel like I've hardly watched much anime at all compared to y'all.
Yeah I noticed I've got like 2/3rd of your entries but only 1/3 of the time watched. So I figured you probably had a few long series in there.
That's a lot of anime. I think I'm only at like a third of that myself
How could you even have more? It sorta ended in a pretty conclusive way didn't it?
I tend to watch a lot of the nice and wholesome slice of life stuff. Just good material to chill out and watch where I don't have to put too much thought into what's going on lol.
I didn't start really getting into watching anime until somewhat recently, but I have been checking out the seasonal releases that interest me. My biggest problem is finding new stuff to watch that's *not* current seasonal releases.
I want a S2 of Koisuru Asteroid, but I know that's probably not gonna happen.
A lot of the time I watch anime, I just wanna chill out and see some nice and wholesome stuff that makes me feel good. And CGDCT/SoL stuff typically hits that mark for me. Though I see how it's not really for everyone.
> See I don't particularly like slice of life or cute girls doing cute things, is the thing. 
Slice of Life CGDCT is probably my favorite type of anime heh
I think I remember reading a bit of that manga a long time ago
Seeing the Universal intro play at the start of these episodes is throwing me off. It's not something I've ever associated with anime lol
I'm not really familiar with the series so I haven't seen Index yet. I'm just watching in the order that a couple friends recommended to me.
I didn't have much of an expectation going into it, but A Certain Scientific Railgun is actually much better than I was expecting so far. The intro is a banger too.
Even though there are literally 0 stakes and the only one who sees it is me, rating the shows I watch is too stressful for me.
Damn, Railgun was good, I wanna see more Misaka shooting stuff. Time to start Railgun S I guess.
I'd highly recommend checking out the 2 OVA's for Gabriel Dropout too.
I just wanna see more Misaka doing cool stuff lol
I've run out of Railgun to watch <:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970> 
Guess I'll start Index now I suppose
Now that I'm starting railgun T, I just realized I'm gonna get to a point where I've reached the last episode and have to wait for more. The inevitable anticipation when binge watching a currently airing show I suppose.  And it looks like new episodes are gonna be delayed for quite a bit too
I can't wait for more railgun, I tried watching Index, but it just wasn't all that interesting to me.
Pacing would be a challenge there wouldn't it? Knowing when to play the music to correspond to what part the reader is at
I actually *just* watched the railgun OVA like an hour ago. Was actually much better than I expected.
<:ChrisHappy:660870796696223744>
Now watch start watching Railgun S
Oh man, the finale has some really good scenes
Speaking of the opening though, that song is fantastic.
Was she? I didn't even realize she was in the opening lol
That lady was always sketchy as hell from the first time we saw her
that's the one where ||Misaka recognizes her from when she saw that one woman's memories|| right?
I think Railgun S is probably my favourite of the bunch
Oh man you're at that part, stuff is gonna start getting much more wild from there
Idk how I feel about Misaki, I still think I don't like her all that much
Oh man there's still so much good stuff you haven't seen if you're on ep 8
https://unlimited.poweris.moe/ has some of the events
There's some translated XDU stuff, but not all that much compared to how much untranslated stuff there is.
Now that I think about it, does Satania actually do anything power wise? I can't remember her really doing much lol
I enjoyed S a bit more myself, but T is really good so far. Story is interesting, plus there's a ton of great action scenes
Railgun T?
Best Arc
Lol same, I've got a handful of titles on my plan to watch list that I'm probably never gonna watch.
I think I've got like 60 on my list right now because I added a ton yesterday. Finding stuff is hard for me
203 planning jeez
That's starting to get to some of the really good stuff of the sisters arc
The only reason I see myself watching more Index is for Misaka content tbh
I think i only got to like episode 12 of index before I stopped watching. Maybe I'll try to pick it up another time, but I doubt it.
I felt the same tbh, the main characters of Index just weren't all that interesting to me compared to the Railgun cast.
those are some uhh, intense tags
Im not a very observant viewer so it's probably just me lol
Just finished Princess Principal, it was a bit confusing ||trying to figure out whos who and whos *acting as who*|| near the end. I think I was expecting a bit more action, but I really enjoyed the steampunk aesthetic because that's not something I normally watch.
I love finding the source material for memes that I've seen when I'm watching anime. It's like a hidden bonus, randomly coming across a scene and thinking, "Oh hey, so this is the scene where that meme came from"
I think that's probably my favorite episode out of any of the seasons. ||Kongou launching the gundam into the sky and then Misaka shooting the damn thing as a railgun, Shirai teleporting giant spears into robots, the sisters coming in clutch|| so many damn good scenes.
Ooh, the finale to that one was really good
I only recognize like 3 of those names lol
I think I recognize like 5 of those, that's more than I expected too tbh
I'm also a fan of the shows that I *think* are nice and wholesome, but then I realize that they are gonna take a real sad turn and leave me crying.
Lol yeah, I like watching the nice and wholesome stuff.
I just realized how much of the anime that I watch is from Doga Kobo lol
Man, Luck & Logic was more disappointing than I expected.
I'll end up watching something then see that "Oh, there's 8 seasons and a dozen specials/OVAs,  guess I gotta watch them all now"
For me, a lot of it is that there's a ton of sequels/OVAs/Spinoffs/etc. so I end up watching like 3 or 4 more things related to the show I just finished.
I feel like I always end up adding like 2 or 3 shows to my plan to watch list after i finish an anime. the list just never gets shorter
So I think there's still a couple to go
Kaguya S2 is 12 eps I think
I feel like Girl's last tour had some kinda deeper message, but I'm not smart enough to figure out what it is lol
<:YumiPoint:688429724103344164>
New Game S3 would be great, there's plenty of material for it in the manga too that I'd love to see animated
How dare you bamboozle me with a Comic Girls thumbnail
That's a nice dress
How's the summer season looking? I don't imagine there's too much with the current pandemic situation and all that.
Just finished Bakarina ||Poor dark magic guy, someone give him a hug please||
That sounds terrifying lol
psychological horror isn't usually my kinda thing, but I could check it out
Now that's the hard question lol
I'm always up for recommendations, feel free
<:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
That post anime season feeling is starting to hit tho, All I've got left is to catch up on Princess Connect! Re:Dive and the last episode of kaguya whenever that airs
I just caught up on the last couple episodes of bookworm. Damn, those episodes were fantastic. I need more
I think DBZ is the oldest anime I've seen, I don't watch much older stuff lol
I'm curious how a S2 will go considering S1 seemed to wrap everything up
The last couple episodes were absolutely fantastic. I need to know where the story is gonna go next
There better be more bookworm
I'm too invested at this point to quit now, if I'm gonna watch something I can't leave it halfway completed. I'm gonna see this through.
I just watched 25 episodes of an anime focused on Mahjong. I have 0 idea how Mahjong works and still don't have any idea. I question my own decisions sometimes.
Ooh there's a new chapter, that was interesting
Tower of God was one of those anime that was apparently super popular this season, but just didn't interest me all that much
Just finished Nanoha StrikerS, it felt like it took awhile for things to really start happening. But when things did start happening, man did it go quick. I enjoyed it a lot more than I as expecting to though.
Yeah Railgun is probably what I'm most looking forward to
<:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
The summer anime this time around have me sad, I don't really see anything that stands out in particular too much or any CGDCT/Slice of Life kinda stuff either.
After watching both the Nanoha episodes and the first movie, I can see why some would recommend to just watch the movie. I didn't go into watching them with very high expectations, but I'm actually pretty surprised how much I enjoyed it despite it not being the kinda thing I normally watch.
So, I've heard a few different things, but does anyone have suggestions for what order I should watch all the Nanoha stuff in? Should I just watch them like: "Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha" -> "A's" -> "StrikerS" -> "ViVid" ?
Ah, *that* one
Which one was before it
Yeah that ep gets mentioned a lot
I wonder how long it'll be after it releases before I can actually watch it tho
Speaking of Violet Evergarden, the movie got a date announced for September(?) didn't it?
I heard "CGDCT" and went to add it to my plan to watch list, but it was already there lol
I think I've heard of that one, but never seen it
I didn't like her as much at the start but when I got into the latter part of S and the start of T, I started liking her as a character more.
Just caught up on the end of Kaguya S2, that ending scene was really good lol
I guess I shouldn't be surprised there's a tool for that lol
I wanna watch some anime, but I've put so much on my plan to watch list that now I can't choose which one to watch. Decisions are hard
That reminds me, I gotta throw Steins Gate on my list and see that eventually
I've def added a few titles to my plan to watch list from AMQ on occasion. It's a good source to find stuff I may have missed, though the chances of CGDCT stuff coming up when it isnt already on my list aren't very high anyway lol
Pretty sure it was lol
The bicycle ones were "Minami Kamakura High School Girls Cycling Club" and "Long Riders!" and the motorcycle one was "Bakuon!!"
I just realized that in the past few days I've watched 2 different anime that were CGDCT with bicycles and one with motorcycles lol.
Tbh I didn't enjoy it all that much, but I do think it had a lot of interesting aspects to it. A lot of people seem to have enjoyed it though, so I'd say give it a go and form your own opinion.
Just watched 'I want to eat your pancreas' and damn, that's not what I was expecting at all.
Going through those polls is interesting because I don't recognize 90% of the characters
Poor Phos
<:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
I keep watching anime that get halfway through a tournament then never get a second season so I never get to know what happens.
I only super vaguely know what goes on index because I never actually watched it, so I'm excited to see how I'll enjoy Railgun without having that knowledge.
Ooh that's starting to get closer, I can't wait
I forget, when is Railgun T continuing, isn't it like late July-ish?
Ooh that ones on my list, maybe I'll check it out lol
Now I gotta decide which title to clear from my watch list next, what a struggle.
At first it was just a nice acid trip to watch, but then the real shit started happening.
I just finished Flip Flappers and despite not really understanding what I just watched, I enjoyed it quite a lot. What an interesting journey
That site is usually my goto for when something isnt on crunchyroll
Ooh I saw that one earlier, I have no idea what it's about but it looks fun lol
Machikado Mazoku S2 when is the real question
After watching the first episode, Lapis Re:LiGHTs is better than I expected, it looks fun.
Now that look at these, it seems like it doesn't matter anyway because I've only seen 2 anime on that list lol
Oh god there's no pictures, how am I supposed to recognize the characters based on name alone lmao
I only recognize 4 of  those
I decided that I'm gonna try to watch almost everything that's airing this season (that's not a sequel of something I haven't seen) but I watched the first ep of that and immediately dropped it. Just not for me I guess 🤷🏻‍♀️
Oh god I watched that second one, it was so awful
I should check back in on my seasonal anime because it's been a few days so new stuff might've aired.
Yeah, I appreciate it. Just wanted to throw it out there. I watched railgun, then tried to get into index, but got bored halfway through the first season because I didn't find any of the characters very interesting. I might go finish it eventually, but it's pretty low on my list.
I know y'all are usually pretty good about this, but I just wanna mention it anyway. Pls make sure to spoiler anything that's gonna talk about what's gonna happen in the rest of Railgun T. Not having seen index, I wanna make sure I go in blind.
I'm glad they aren't just gonna leave us with all those cliffhangers
O shit, a bookworm season 3 got announced?
The anime that I've thrown on my list because I've seen them in AMQ at some point are better than I expected. Just finished up Strike Witches 2 and Brave Witches. Good stuff
Oh yeah I forgot about Houkago Teibou Nisshi
I didn't even know there was more SAO tbh, I watched the first one and the one with guns. I kinda forgot about it after that lol
But story wise, there's not all that much I'm interested in this season, I get that. There's some continuations like Black Clover and Railgun that I'm keeping up with and some sequels like Fire Force and Re:Zero. But other than those, Deca Dence looked cool, and Lapis Re:LiGHTs and that's pretty much it.
I don't think I really pay attention to the animation quality at all when watching anime
Ooh that ones on my watch list
There's not all that much plot (but that's kinda expected anyway) but it was still really fun to watch
Ooh, I really enjoyed Sansha Sanyou
Idk, I was kinda confused, but I'm also the kinda watcher who doesn't pay all that much attention to all the details of what's going on so I probably just missed some stuff.
So,I just caught up on ep2 of Deca-Dence, and I see what y'all were talking about. Wtf is even going on anymore
Same, I don't see the appeal, but I guess some people are interested in that kind of appearance 🤷‍♀️
I've heard of that one before, guess I had forgotten to add it to my list. Maybe I'll start Hidamari Sketch next, ty for the suggestion <:ChrisHappy:660870796696223744>
Would an anilist link be better? https://anilist.co/user/Gelb8374/animelist
https://myanimelist.net/animelist/Gelb8374
Hang on, lemme find my MAL link
I gotta find more CGDCT anime to add to my list, I've watched so much that I'm having trouble finding new ones lol
Yeah, it's a bit slow, but it does start developing a bit of a plot as it goes on
It looks like it's gonna be sad lol
Ooh I forgot there's gonna be a s3 of that
I guess I just don't pay that much attention lol
I just finished Made in Abyss, and dang that was not what I was expecting at all. I enjoyed it a ton though, I'm surprised I haven't heard of it before for how amazing it was.
I watched Sakura Trick not too long ago, there was more action than I expected lol
I can't say I really understand the hype around it, but I'm watching it anyway. Maybe it's just not my kinda anime 🤷‍♀️
I'm just waiting for more Railgun, it's coming up soon <:KirikaPog:605209108827734017>
Yeah there's not really any anime I'm super into this season, but there's still a good amount of interesting stuff to watch.
Tbh I feel like it needs more exposition after what they showed in ep 2, but I'll have to see how I feel about it after I watch it later.
I haven't seen it yet so idk
Was  ep 3 of Deca-Dence *that* bad? Or do you mean you were bored before that?
Aight so after catching up on Deca-Dence ep 3, I'd say I enjoyed it a lot more than the first 2 eps. It also explained went into more detail about ep 2 stuff which was good because I was still a bit confused after that.
Maybe one day I'll get around to actually watching Index, who knows <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
That reminds me, new railgun episode is soon!
I don't think I've watched an idol anime , except for gear of course
Huh, I don't remember that nurse
Wait, what show is this?
That's a cute one
<:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
New Railgun ep was great, now I gotta wait until next week for more though
Which one is Tsubaki again?
Brave has a few mentions to stuff that happens near the end of strike witches S1 iirc
Strike Witches -> Strike Witches 2 -> Strike Witches: Operation Victory Arrow > Strike Witches Movie -> Brave Witches episodes 1-7 -> Brave Witches: Petersburg Daisenryaku (OVA) -> Brave Witches episodes 8-12. This was the watch order I followed, I think it's the right order but idk
I think the movie was probably my favourite thing from Strike Witches
That's why I like her lol
I'm not really into idol stuff, but I'll  watch it anyway because I've enjoyed the witches stuff so far. Hopefully it'll be good
isnt luminous witches  the idol one
<:KirikaPog:605209108827734017>
Ah, *her*
That kinda caught me off guard a bit too lol
Who needs pants anyway
A wise decision
I forgot how gay strike witches could be at times lol.
lmao
<:ChrisBang:702166093065748500>
Are you watching S1 or S2? I forget which one these scenes are from
Tbh I wish we got more of this content than the actual plot we did get lol.
Keijo is the best anime tbh
Flip Flappers was fantastic, despite how confused I was left after watching it lol
Same
GX is my favourite season tbh
I need more cute girl anime in my life
Asteroid is probably one of my favorite slice of life animes tbh
Yeah it really doesn't from what I've watched
Koisuru asteroid is defiantly gay as hell tbf
I always need more Doga Kobo anime
Ooh, I forgot there was a new ep of Re:zero today. Guess I'm watching that later
I mean, ||The two main characters move in together||  in asteroid which is further than a lot of shows get lol
Koisuru Asteroid
New railgun episode was great, more Kuroko action and some plot starting to develop. <:KirikaPog:605209108827734017>
Yeah, that's one they *just* dropped today I think https://www.crunchyroll.com/anime-news/2020/07/30/august-updates-to-the-crunchyroll-catalog
Oh maybe they already dropped it
I think so, I also believe they're dropping that soon iirc
That's quite a fan club
I don't think I've used crunchy in awhile. I got fed up with how garbage their player is and how often it broke that I just found other sites
🎵  Flip Flap, Flip Flap 🎵
The reactions to the ending of that movie from the people in the theater I was  in were amusing
lol
I forget most of what he even did in that movie tbh
I remember hearing last week's ep got pretty poor reviews lol
Oh I forgot there's a new episode. I'll have to watch that at some point
<:ChrisHappy:660870796696223744>
As someone who's only watched railgun and only has a vague knowledge of index stuff, ty for spoiler tagging stuff btw
That's a nice Chris emote you got there
I only got like halfway through index s1 before I got bored because all the magic stuff just wasn't interesting for me.
It's not like there's too much else to watch this season, so I'm just taking what I can get I guess lol
I've been watching that one, but I have no idea why I'm still watching it lol
I don't need to be crying rn
Ah fuck that song
Ah, a lot of that franchise kinda blurs together for me lol
Which one is that again, I forget. Brave Witches?
<:KirikaPog:605209108827734017>
Girls doing climbing? More to add to the list <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
I'm more into the serious plot stuff that Railgun pulls, but it was an alright ep for me
interesting...
Just watched it, that railgun ep was uhhh
You can never watch too many CGDCT shows <:ChrisHappy:660870796696223744>
I wish my school had clubs that cool
I mean, I guess I can understand it being called a sports anime when you put it like that. I just never thought about it in that way lol
I never thought about Girls und Panzer as a sports anime lol
Lol that's an interesting way of putting it
Yeah I remember having that problem
Yeah you'll get answers
Ah, I remember what goes on in that season
I mean, considering we've got Vivid, I'd say they're pretty solidly together
I think that ones on my list, so I'll get to it at some point
Maybe I'll try to get my friend to watch Nanoha next if she ever ends up watching Symphogear.
Left pic is kinda scary to me tbh lol
Ah the opening for season two is reminding me of all the times I've heard it in AMQ and missed it every time. Maybe now I'll have a chance.
My conclusion is that they're all precious and must be protected
So I finally got around to watching K-On!
The first season felt like half a plot for me, so I can't say I'm too surprised
I'm left wondering if we'll see a reunion between her and Misaka.
Now that I'm caught up on current anime, time to watch more K-On!!
New Railgun episode, it seems like its finally getting to some plot <:KirikaPog:605209108827734017>
<:ChrisPray:672578403156885504>
Man that OP is a banger
I want a second season of Koisuru Asteroid, but I know it has little to no chance of getting one.
It's been a long time since I've watched Yuruyuri, maybe I'll give it a rewatch at some point
Now that I think about it, I think I remember throwing this one on my list awhile back lol
Ooh a ping, is that an idol anime? I can't tell. I can't really say I've seen any idol stuff really, but it looks cute enough so maybe I'll give it a shot
So I finished the K-On movie. I knew what was coming, but I still cried anyway 10/10
Ah fuck I didn't expect K-On!! to make me cry
It's a minor detail, but I appreciate the effort they went through to keep Azusa tanned throughout the various scenes rather than just go back to normal. 10/10 continuity lol.
I'm halfway through it so far and It's been great
I just realized that K-On's second season has 26 episodes <:KirikaPog:605209108827734017>
When I first was getting into anime that kinda thing always confused me lol
The manga stuff after S2 has a bit more of that kinda thing
Land of the lustrous CG threw me off at first, but I grew to like it.
Hmm, Idolm@ster and Love Live. I'll keep those in mind.
So, if I'm looking to watch some idol anime, keeping in mind that I haven't really watched any before, any recommendations on what I should start with?
Ooh that anime, good stuff
Wait what happens in ep 18? I don't remember that much
Kaos is very precious
OwO we talking about some CGDCT in here?
Oh, that anime
Twintails is fun, I watched that one recently
Ah Comic Girls is nice and wholesome
Did it? Didn't know that
I want a Comic Girls S2, though I know it's never gonna get one
<:KirikaPog:605209108827734017>
Then you can start waiting for S3
I need to get back to watching some new anime. I've just been keeping up with the current seasonal stuff, but other than that I haven't watched anything new recently.
Ms. Vampire who lives in my neighborhood is a good one, I enjoyed it. Lots of fun vampire related plots lol
OwO we talking CGDCT here?
I forgot about that scene lol
I gotta catch up on all the new episodes for the seasonal stuff I'm watching. I'm a little behind.
Yeah reading that I don't think I've any interest in watching it. but hey, at least fripside songs are always bangers so theres that.
<:KirikaPog:605209108827734017>
Fripside?
> SO MUCH SHIT TO WATCH
Big mood
My recollection of what things happen when is so jumbled up. I'm gonna have to refresh my memory on whats going on before whenever S2 airs lol.
Ah with that
Where does volume 4 end again? I don't remember
I wonder how much they'll cover in S2
I've read ahead in the manga and there's so much good stuff to look forward to
Holy shit I'm so excited for this
What does that say lol
Finally caught up with all the anime I've missed in the past week. That Re:Zero episode was certainly something. Railgun's getting into some interesting plot too, I can't wait for the action scenes that are gonna come.
Yeah and a bit through Index's sisters arc. I stopped at episode 12 iirc
Yeah its on my list of "I'll watch this eventually" but it's pretty low in that list. I got like halfway through index S1 and was just so uninterested in the characters and plot I dropped it.
I've basically only watched Railgun, so I don't have Index to really compare it to. Sisters arc and railgun S in general was absolutely phenomenal tho
Railgun ranks pretty highly among my favourite anime. There's a lot to enjoy
One of these days I'll watch Index, although I hear the adaptation isn't great in the first place
Twintails is a masterpiece of an anime
I'm not really interested that much in light novels so the anime adaptations are all I'm gonna have to judge.
Like for example had I watched Index first, I would've already known about all the Sisters stuff, as opposed to seeing it for the first time in railgun S.
I mean how much of Index can I watch without getting any railgun spoilers.
On the topic of Index btw, assuming I've only seen Railgun, how far can I watch without coming across any spoilers
Oh man I missed some twintails discussion, what a shame
I think I remember watching like 1 episode of madoka, got confused, and didn't continue. I'll have to actually give it a proper watch eventually.
Maybe I'll finally get around to giving Madoka a shot this weekend
Guess I'll just have to actually watch Index if I want some content
This weeks Railgun episode was <:KirikaPog:605209108827734017> , though it's a shame there's only a few more left. I wanna see more <:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
Anime be like that sometimes, I remember watching the entirety of Saki despite not knowing how Mahjong works or having any interest in it.
At least Misaka is doing well
I feel like we didn't get all that much information from the new episode, but it did clear up some details and answer some questions which was good.
Oh that's what that line meant
Huh, didn't know that lol
I just wanna see more Misaka action
So what I've gathered so far is that Madoka is basically Hibiki, is that pretty accurate?
Alright, so 1 episode in I'm already trusting no one
I'm gonna try and give Madoka a watch today and see how this goes. All I really know going into it is that there's gonna be some trauma.
I have absolutely no idea where this story is going at this point and I like that.
Finished ep 8, that's a lotta things happening at once.
I knew that ||Kyubey was sketchy as hell before I even started Madoka, but I wasn't expecting that||
That was uhh, not something I was expecting
Just finished episode 6, wtf
Twintails is a masterpiece
Well, finished ep 3 and can't say I was expecting that
More suffering? I'll be sure to check it out
Maybe I'll give it a watch if I end up having some time this weekend.
Is the spin-off worth a watch?
Ah
Btw what do I watch after finishing Madoka? I know there are movies, but aren't they just recaps? Is there other stuff?
I gotta admit I don't know what I was expecting, but that certainly wasn't anything I could've imagined lol
Well that was quite the journey
Well, I can see why there's a lot of talk about episode 10 now
Only a few more episodes left
Also, ||Damn Kyubey's motives are far more fucked up than I imagined they would be||
Jeez this just gets more sad each episode doesn't it lol
I just googled it and this looks horny af
I'm liking how often I see Twintails talked about in here recently. It's a very cultured anime
I'm probably better off just reading an explanation, I'm not good at all at picking up on symbolism
Idk how good or bad it was because I didn't understand what was going on for like 80% of it lol
That's a top quality subreddit right there lol
Ah, is that a popular debate?
So, I finished that Madoka movie. I have barely any clue what I just watched, but I enjoyed it nonetheless lol
Where can I find the concept movie trailer?
> Yeah all we have is a concept movie trailer
Oh yeah i forgot I was told to watch that too
I'm the kinda viewer that doesn't pay all that much attention when I'm watching stuff and just takes it at face value which makes it hard to understand if there's some deep meaning behind what's going on that's not plainly obvious.
After watching that trailer, as seems to be the case with anything madoka for me, I don't really know what i just watched, but it looked interesting nonetheless.
yeah I saw that one, I was kinda hoping for some english tho
Wtf is *THAT*
Yeah I can't say I'm all that interested in it so far either, and there's only a few episodes left too
Oh hey that reminds me there's a new railgun ep today
Damn, I didn't understand any of what was said in that trailer but I still cried
The finale for that arc is one of my favourite episodes from the whole series.
Also the music for this ep is great
A bit less action than I was expecting, but this weeks ep was alright. I'm looking forward to the last couple episodes.
Yeah I've heard that arc gets some bad reviews but I loved it
I think that ones on my plan to watch list, but I haven't seen it yet
I didnt even realize that's what it was tbf, but I'm also a bit oblivious lol
Yeah I think this week's railgun episode is probably one of my favourites. Lots of good action scenes
Damn ,even the first few minutes of this episode are already insane
<:KirikaPog:605209108827734017>
Today's Friday, time for this  week's Railgun
What live action anime have there even been? The only one I can think of off the top of my head is Death Note.
Speaking of Violet Evergarden, is the movie already released? Or is that soon
I just googled the Saki live action and man does it look absolutely terrible lol
Wait there was a Saki live action?
Yeah I know it'll be ages before more Railgun anime is even considered
Im just over here hoping for more Railgun anime eventually
> ||Wasn't that confirmed to be that girl that can transform into other people through their blood?||
Was it? I don't remember seeing that anywhere
I think the only thing I have left to watch from Nanoha is ViVid Strike, but I can't really say I'm too interested in that
I'm loving these action scenes tho
Nanoha Reflection was alright, the plot wasn't too surprising but I still enjoyed it. Onwards to Detonation now
Oh i forgot about her
I think I only recognize like 2 of those characters lol
Sakura Trick <:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
Ahh I can't wait for the winter season
Oh man I missed some good stuff in this channel. Uma Musume season 2? I can't wait to see more horse girls
In general, I'm not very observant as a viewer so I often miss a lot of details when watching stuff. So unless the plot is pretty straightforward I'll probably miss some relevant detail and end up confused.
S2 of Re:Zero has just left me confused tbh whereas I mostly understood S1
Oh damn, I didn't realize the last episode had aired for Deca Dence
<:KirikaPog:605209108827734017>
"final" pls no, I want more
Eventually I'll have to make my way through Index as wwell
I just want more Misaka, but if Junko is the best I can do then I'll take what I can get.
Ah, maybe I'll look into that
What is Astral Buddy, I've heard the name a few times but I'm not familiar with it
I know it'll take years at best but I want more Railgun lol
<:KirikaPog:605209108827734017>
Hopefully
<:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
Railgun is finally over
152 days watched damn
Now that I've sorted out all the anime I wanna watch for the fall season into a nice list based on air date, i'm realizing how many there are
Anichart seems to be the closest to what I'm looking for, ty
Is there any list floating around for what days each of the fall anime starts airing somewhere. I remember seeing a list floating around r/anime for previous seasons but I don't think i've seen one yet for fall.
Damn that's a lot. There's at least like 12 that I am probably gonna watch and about the same amount that I wanna at least check out as well.
Any good lists for all the stuff that's airing in the fall season anywhere?
Now that Summer stuff is ending, I gotta figure out what I'm gonna keep up with for the Fall season
Man, what a wild ride The Misfit of Demon King Academy was. Probably my favorite anime this season that's not a continuation.
I finally got around to finishing Gibiate, man what an absolute trainwreck that was from start to finish
Oh nice, I've got that to look forward to later today. I gotta finish up the summer stuff I was watching first tho
Oh is ep 1 of Assault Lily already out? I thought it didnt show until tomorrow
It's only an hour long so it's not like you'll have lost much even if you don't enjoy it
I feel like Burn the Witch kinda had a decent setup for a plot then just completely failed in execution. At least thats how I saw it
Also, the OP and ED for Assault Lily are great
Assault Lily looks better than I was expecting, it reminds me a bit of Hina Logic.
Now that i just finished Re:Zero I'm finally done with all the stuff I was watching for the summer season. Time to start on Fall stuff <:KirikaPog:605209108827734017>
Ah, yeah the one I'm watching has the black paw
catpaw?
Well, I guess I'll pay attention more to the Op next week
Yeah I saw the top one
Yeah I probably wouldn't notice that lol, I'm not very observant when it comes to that kinda thing
Was there something wrong with the OP? I didn't notice anything, but maybe I just wasnt paying attention
Correct OP? Wdym
Higurashi didn't seem that appealing to me based on the description, but maybe I'll at least check it out after a few episodes have aired
I said it earlier, but Elaina is cute af
Very true
I just realized that AMQ is gonna get a lot harder because there's gonna be all the fall anime im watching in there soon
I mean, I knew it was gonna be wholesome, but It was a lot more wholesome than I expected
Majo no Tabitabi is way more wholesome than I expected, plus Elaina is cute af too
The OP is more of a banger than I expected
I just realized that Rail Romanesque is just episodes that are only a few minutes long. I assumed it was a normal length anime, but I guess I'll just have to live with only a few minutes of train girls each week. <:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
Yeah, I feel like it had a lot of potential, but just couldn't get there
That's one I'm really interested in too, but aniwatch doesn't have it up yet so I can't check it out just yet
I wasn't really expecting to enjoy Tonikaku Kawaii, but based on the first episode it looks pretty wholesome. I'm looking forward to it.
I feel good about most of the first episodes I've seen so far, if I had to choose some drop candidates it'd probably be I'm "Standing on a Million Lives" and "Talentless Nana"
I was disappointed to learn that Rail Romanesque was just shorts. I wanted full eps of train girls
I could just drop the ones that arent full of cute girls, that may get rid of a few
I'm debating if I should just drop some of the weaker ones, or just no-life it and watch everything
Theres still so much fall stuff I wanna watch that hasnt aired yet, my watchlist is gonna be packed this season.
It might in the next few episodes, I just didn't really get that vibe from the first ep. Ty btw for that link Lank, it took some shenanigans but I managed to download it eventually.
I think I have like a dozen things im currently watching for fall so far assuming I dont drop any. Idk if I'll be able to keep up with it all
Sports Climbing Girls was a more fun watch than I expected. There doesn't seem to really be any yuri, but there are abs I can look at instead <:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
erai?
Anyone got a source to watch Sports Climbing girls (Aside from crunchy)
I noticed that too lol
Yeah nothing is coming out the day I'm expecting it
Sometimes it just be like that
> And never see lapis relights on these charts and its legit funny and nobody watches it
Lapis definitely got ignored more than it should have unfortunately. It was a really fun watch
Uzaki is weird in the sense that I was under the impression that it was getting generally poor reviews but apparently is popular.
Wait I think I've read this lmao
Yeah that's a mystery too
I hope we get a lot more worldbuilding, I wanna know more about the pillars.
Interesting, TIL. But yeah, Warlords of Sigrdrifa is great so far
Was that the case for Re:Zero? I dont remember
On the topic of Warlords of Sigrdrifa, is there a reason the first episode was so long? Are all the eps gonna be that long, or was it just made to be really long so they could get all the backstory out of the way.
I think it is for me as well
I'm kinda surprised that theres nothing I dislike that I've seen so far this season. It's all been pretty good
Wise words
Oh yeah I completely forgot there's a new strike witches this season
I'd genuinely consider giving crunchy money if their player wasn't so god damn awful. Half the reason I pirate the stuff I watch is because the pirated streams are usually better than the legal ones.
I dont usually remember what day stuff airs because I rely on anilist's timers a lot lol
Ah, friday. Ty
Any1 know when it airs? Isn't it like sometime next weekend?
Well, if the anime doesn't end up going well I can always go read the manga/light novel I suppose
Oh nice, I'm looking forward to it
Depending on how gay it ends up being, Adachi and Shimamura might be up there on my favorite list as well
Yeah same
I dont even recognize most of those characters lol
Good point
The animation doesn't seem great, but it's not bad either
Idk how I feel about Sleepy Princess in the Demon Castle. On one hand it's Doga Kobo which is a plus, but on the other hand it seems kinda repetitive. The OP is a banger tho
Listening to this is fun because I have no clue who almost all of the characters in these pics are
> unrelated to y'all's discussion
> genocide in the demon castle?
Ah, I knew that VA's name sounded familiar
Theres a tragic lack of votes for Misaka around here.
Is that the fortune telling one? It sounds familiar
Now that Railgun T has ended, I'm just left wanting even more Railgun content
> there is one with a princess and her father- the king - wants to marry her off and she flat out says "I like girls"
I think I've read that one, unless that kinda thing happens in numerous stories
At least if its finished then I dont have to endlessly wait without knowing if there will be more chapters or not
Damn, that's a lot of good looking content. I've read some of these too
I need to find some more stuff to read anyway so I'll probably check it out
Yeah based on the description this sounds awful. Maybe I'll read it lmao
What's this one called?
Oh yeah the first ep of strike witches is out isn't it
360 minutes would be more than an entire season of a normal anime wouldn't it
Strike witches is a banger so far, ||Yoshika stops a polar bear with magic and battles an iceburg. Absolute quality content||
Come watch Strike Witches, there's *plenty* of panty shots there
I get that. Like if I'm 6/12 through an anime I'm not sure I enjoy all that much then I might as well just finish it because then I can add another entry to my completed list lol
When the rest of the stuff on my plan to watch list airs I think I'll be at about 20 things for the season if I dont drop anything
Ah that one. I'm looking forward to it as well
Which one is that?
There are like 3 or 4 I may drop depending how things go, but I haven't seen anything that I really dislike like so far. It's all been pretty good at this point.
My watchlist for this season is getting way too full. I already have 17 things I'm watching lmao
There's also Operation Victory Arrow between S2 and the movie, but its not really important
Bear girl is cute, I'm enjoying Kuma Kuma Kuma Bear despite having absolutely no clue where this is going.
There is a reference to the movie as well in the first ep of this season, but idk if the movie contents are gonna have any importance other than a few references here and there
Adachi and Shimamura was nice. It feels like its gonna take awhile though, gimme the gay already
I'll just wait for it to show up somewhere other than funi where I can stream it
I have no control over that lol
For some reason torrents just wont download at all on my desktop and I can't be bothered to figure out why
Oh is that out already?
So after finishing ep 2, this is going about as I expected so far. The gay vibes going on are more than I expected as well.
We gettin all sorts of relics in here
Starting ep 2 of Assault Lily, I forgot how much of a banger the OP is
"I've Been Killing Slimes for 300 Years and Maxed Out My Level" I completely forgot about this getting an adaptation so seeing new art for it was a surprise.  Apparently its coming in the spring anime season too which is much sooner than I expected. https://twitter.com/slime300_PR/status/1314400280260218880
Idol stuff is something that I've never really watched so I figured I'd give it a shot
If I wanna check out the Love Live! franchise, is "Love Live! School Idol Project" the one I start with?
Maybe I will clear something from my plan to watch list, but first I gotta decide what to watch lol.
Ah, I suppose there was some gay there
Which one?
I've watched all the new episodes that I'm keeping up with for today, now I gotta wait until tomorrow for more content <:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
Majo no Tabitabi is so wholesome, I'm gonna look forward to seeing more of Elaina being smug as hell each week.
Gymnastics anime?
I just love seeing Elaina being smug as hell, its great
Well, I've ordered some food am now ready to check out some Love Live. Let's see how this goes
Its a bit late so maybe I'll get through it all tomorrow
So what do I watch next? the season 2 right?
I was expecting some normal idol stuff not some kinda inception dream shenanigans.
What the hell is this creepy OVA for love live
So I finished 'Love Live! School Idol Project'. Idk how I feel about it tbh, it was enjoyable for the most part but I wasn't really that into it.
After goin back and listening to them, I can agree with that take
I mean I'm a completionist and I'm already invested this much so might as well watch everything that the franchise offers.
So what do I watch after the movie? Sunshine?
Is that the final song?
I think the movie also probably had my favorite song as well. Idk the name but it's after they return to Japan and sing about running away because they're popular. Its a banger
Im kinda sad that the adventure in america was so short because that was full of hilarious content.
Ah so theres no clear answer
I do have a question though after seeing the movie. Who was the mysterious singing woman? Are we just supposed to speculate something or was there some detail I missed.
Alright, I finished the movie, good stuff. The decision they came to and the way it ended is definitely fitting.
The portrayal of america is already hilarious
Alright, time to watch this and see how it goes
What's next after S2 btw? The movie right?
So I finished 'Love Live! School Idol Project Season 2' I enjoyed it a lot more than S1. Maybe because I didn't enjoy all the drama from S1 about forming the group that much. And S2 starts with the full group so there wasn't really any of that.
The new Gochiusa is nice and wholesome as usual
Hmm, idk how I feel about it yet. I'll probably give it a few more episodes to see where this is going
I just started it <:KirikaPog:605209108827734017>
I'm impressed you even noticed that detail
Lol, the article on the sidebar. Rip Global
Oh they licensed the novel and manga for bofuri, I didn't notice that. I'm looking forward to it.
Bofuri <:KirikaPog:605209108827734017>
I never pay that much attention to the details lol
I just got to the end, I see what you mean
I recognize most of these
I didn't know it was by the same author of Koisuru Asteroid
<:HibikiGay:670494484701773845>
OwO I'll have to look into that
Ayy I jumped into that rabbit hole a few days ago
Damn if only this one had an OP so it could show up in AMQ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeZiu9kDaPU
Some of this stuff is so old and obscure I'd probably have a hard time finding a subbed version of it
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
Watching this gave me a great idea. Maybe I'll start going through and watching the lowest rated stuff I can find so my terrible choices can appear in AMQ.
Alright, having just watched that I can confirm that it's appallingly bad
Ah, this one is the lowest rated isn't it? I wanna watch it now
The only reason I kept watching it was to keep up with the weekly discussion threads talking about how much of a trainwreck it was.
On MAL for example, there's literally only 5 series (excluding stuff like movies/OVA's) rated lower than it.
Gibiate
Although now that I think about it, it shouldn't be much of a surprise that this season is better when last season had one of the worst rated series I've ever seen.
I am kinda surprised though with this season's content. There's nothing that I've watched that's particularly bad. I'm enjoying everything I've seen for the most part so far. Unlike last season where I suffered through a few shows because there wasnt much to watch.
It does feel like its gonna get a bit repetitive
I think with this I've now started everything this season that I was interested in. I've got 21 titles on my watch list lmao
Oh hey I'm literally watching that right now
I really need to rewatch S1 of Re:Zero then rewatch part 1 of S2. I feel like I was missing a lot of details because not much made sense to me.
I'm not a huge fan of that one, the characters just weren't that interesting for me
I'm rewatching a bit of K-On! and I'm realizing how different it feels without Azusa
Kuma Kuma Kuma Bear is surprisingly wholesome, I feel like I'm getting some Bofuri vibes from it
The new Strike Witches episode was fun as usual, lots of explosions
I'd consider watching anime 'legally' if any of the legal sources actually had a player that wasn't completely terrible.
Its not a crime if I don't get caught <:HibikiFingerguns:688429715836502063>
I forgot that aired today, can't wait to watch it later
Speaking of yuri, is the new Assault Lily episode out? I can't seem to find it anywhere
<:HibikiGay:670494484701773845>
I just watched the new Adachi and Shimamura episode and damn this is gay as hell, I love it.
I'll have to give Bloom into You another shot at some point. I remember not being that into it, but that was awhile ago.
Thigh <:HibikiGay:670494484701773845>
Damn that gif is nice af
This season has so much wholesome content. Majo no Tabitabi, Tonikaku Kawaii, Adachi and Shimamura, they're all great.
A wise decision
Assault Lily is nice as usual. Especially all those *thicc* thighs. <:HibikiGay:670494484701773845>
This weeks Majo no Tabitabi was certainly something ||I wasn't expecting something that dark||
<:KirikaPog:605209108827734017>
I like how much the discussion about Assault Lily is just about the thighs lol
<:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>

Yeah I think New Game would be at the top for me too. There's also plenty of content for them to adapt
<:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
Despite knowing basically all of them are never gonna get another season
There's a lot of CGDCT anime that I'd love another season for and comic girls is pretty high on that list.
Tragically there's only one entry for Comic Girls. Well, I guess I could read the manga and add that as well, but that's too much effort.
Plus It's an excuse to add more entries to my anime list
All this talk made me go watch Miru Tights. That was certainly an experience.
Tonikaku Kawaii is absolutely a wild ride
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
"Genre: Yuri"
Talentless Nana is a wild ride so far. I have no clue where the hell this is going
Welcome to the wild ride
Ah I just finished the bit about her story
Speaking of some gay manga, Ouji-sama Nante Iranai is pretty nice so far
Those are some really pretty eyes, nice colours.
> Fruit Tart got a lot more gay this week
Im looking forward to that <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
Well, now that I've read through that though. Anyone got some nice yuri manga recommendations?
But yeah its like 10 chapters lol
I mean, they talk about it the very next chapter tbf
True, fair point
Alright, I caught up with Ouji-sama Nante Iranai and that's some good shit. ||What a slow burn, it took like 180 chapters for a kiss, but they're so cute together||
I've heard really good things about Akudama Drive
> I was just about ready to drop it for being another MHA with even less girls and focus on this wimpy guy who's just a touma expy
Yeah I'm sorta glad that ||We dont get to focus on nullifying powers guy, he seemed pretty boring tbh||
I love that I have no idea where the story is gonna go next, it's a fun watch
'Kuma Kuma Kuma Bear' is super wholesome and I'm glad it turned out to be that way. Yuna is also smug as hell which is always an enjoyable watch.
Isnt assault lily delayed to fridays now?
I'll take that at face value, *for now*......
Now I'm left wondering if there's gonna be some kinda hidden secret with the kitty lmao
<:KirikaPog:605209108827734017>
Oh don't worry I didn't mean here, I trust people here not to do stuff like that
I didn't know there was a manga, but knowing that makes me wanna avoid any discussions about it. Because now I'm worried that all the "theories" that people are throwing out are just spoilers from the manga.
Yeah
That's what I'm loving about it
Hmm, good question ||It's hard to tell if they were just pulling a switcheroo at the beginning and that's all nanao was useful for or if there's gonna be something more going on and he'll return somehow.||
There's also ||The other character in the promo materials. Have we met them yet and I just forgot or are they still unknown.||
Speaking of ep 3 ||I really love invincible guy, I really hope we get to see him for the rest of the series instead of killing him off soon.||
Someone has to dismantle it
At least theres tons of nice stuff to watch in the meantime this season
Now I have to wait another week for a new episode 😦
Speaking of Adashima, I just watched the new ep, nice and gay as usual
Going by number of series, I've got like twice as many that are tagged female protag compared to male protag
I think the only reason my time watched on Male Protags is so high is because I've got some longer series like HunterxHunter, Black Clover, or Dragon Ball that add quite a bit of time.
I'm surprised that I have so much time watched for the "Male Protagonist" tag
Anilist stats are always fun to look at
Hmm?
Like, gay bear girls are intriguing but I'm not gonna put that much effort into it
Yeah I decided to nope outta there after ep 1 lol
I'm the kinda viewer who just takes everything at face value and doesn't put much thought into what's going on. So stuff that I gotta think a lot to interpret or some hidden symbolism or something isn't for me lol
This seems too high iq for me
I didn't realize how weird some of the stuff on my plan to watch list was gonna be. I tried to watch 'Yuri Kuma Arashi' and god damn I have no clue what the hell is going on.
That's setting up a death flag regardless of what anime you're in lol
Yeah I went to check their twitter after seeing that lol
Hold up, one of these things is not like the other
Yeah that was quite the episode
What the fuck even is this
Yeah I'm like halfway through and I see what you're talking about now
Not yet, but since you're saying that now I'm worried lol
Every week I'm grateful for all the wholesome anime we have this season.
This week's Majo no Tabitabi was quite the experience ||I want the nice and wholesome stories back already||
Not only is Assault Lily not being subtle *at all* there's also the nice and copious supply of thigh shots as well. <:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
I think the movies (Detonation/Reflection) are after A's. The other movies are just recaps of the normal season. (Someone feel free to correct me on that if I'm wrong)
What'd you think of it?
<:KirikaPog:605209108827734017>
Damn, Munou na Nana is getting good af
Friendship through superior firepower
Damn, you're hyping this up more and more but all I can do is wait lol
Oh yeah, I knew it was a wild ride since after seeing ep 1 lol. How wild is that ride gonna get though? I'll just have to watch and see
The one thing I'm loving about it so far is that I have no fucking clue what's gonna come next, so if they do tease a S2 then I'm definitely gonna hold off on reading it because I wanna keep that feeling
Damn, now I kinda wanna read it, but that'll have to wait until at least the anime ends. But if they announce a second season or something then I dont wanna read it and already know the ending. The struggle is real
What chapter is it on now?
So is the anime not gonna get to the end of the story then? (Does it have an end? or is it ongoing?)
Yeah new guy is crazy, but im not expecting to see him for long lol
munou na nana is getting real good
I'm just waiting for some confessions. Cmon Adachi, I know you can do it
Adachi and Shimamura was a nice dose of wholesome gay this week as usual
Wdym baiting? We've already got our YuRi couple
I mean crunchy is already pretty bad themselves, can Sony really be much worse?
Is Sony bad or something?
Damn tonikawa is lewd af with all this handholding
Damn the ending of that Assault Lily episode, that's not something I expected
Oh yeah theres Elaina today too. I havent seen any of the eps released today
Characters? Who needs characters when you have all the thigh shots <:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
I haven't seen it yet, but now I'm looking forward to it even more <:KirikaPog:605209108827734017>
Oof
I havent heard of it, is it gonna be controversial or something?
It's my favourite nanoha season though personally
From what I've heard, a lot of people aren't huge fans of StrikerS
<:KirikaPog:605209108827734017>
Usually I'm not great about recognizing VA's (Because other than gear I don't really know any)
It's always fun to be watching something and then realize "Wait, is that the same VA as this other character" I didn't realize Aoi Yuuki also voices Tamaki in Fire Force.
I know right!
That's an option too
Aniwatch has it which is what I usually use
I dont think funi has it, just the current one
<:HibikiFingerguns:688429715836502063>
Just abandon your real life obligations and watch anime instead like I do
Even the title of the next episode is foreboding, I really wanna see whats gonna happen next now
Oh shit, that ending of this weeks Munou na Nana
It *IS* great! Welcome to the yuri club
Yeah people here are good about not spoiling stuff
Its a shame that I have to avoid the discussion threads about it because I fear that people who have read the manga are gonna post "theories" about things that are just spoilers.
If there's no hints at another season after it ends, I'll probably end up reading the manga
Yeah the ed is much better than the OP for that one
I think my favourite OP this season is Majo no Tabitabi though there's probably some bias in there because that's also probably my favourite anime this season too lol
I can understand that viewpoint
Tonikaku is the kind of thing I'd probably not consider watching usually, but because I heard good things about it (and the fact that the OP is a banger) made me give it a shot. And I'm glad I did because its wholesome af
The gist I got from Goh was that the fights are the only thing worth watching. Because the plot was absolutely incoherent tbh
I havent been too into fruit tart, but I also havent really given it a fair chance
Although amusingly Symphogear S1 shows up when I'm looking through isekai lol
Yeah after looking through anilist for stuff I've watched tagged isekai, I'd probably say bookworm too
I don't pay attention enough to notice if there are translation mistakes. Unless it's just a clear atrocity which I've only seen a few times.
Finding new stuff that actually has a decent amount of chapters or hasnt been abandoned is tough
Most of the stuff I'm reading/have read is already somewhere in that one list of stuff with female mc's you posted like a month ago in here
Lmao
I dont think I've ever even looked at them, but that wouldnt surprise me
Speaking of reading that reminds me, I stumbled across some of your comments when I was reading two as one princesses the other day lol
Lol, that's not the main reason, but I won't deny it's *a reason*
I enjoyed it at the start, but started losing interest with all the muscle bois and magic stuff
This one? https://discordapp.com/channels/336297387863703552/371105434771390465/774047563237294110
That's a happy Adachi right there
Every week Adachi and Shimamura leaves me with the feeling of "Just confess to each other already damn it"
A recommendation by Ikxi <:KirikaPog:605209108827734017>  I'll look at it later
I wanna see Shimamura be assertive and confess because Adachi is gonna be way too nervous to do it.
Anyone know the VA for Eihemia from this week's Majo no Tabitabi? She sounds really familiar but I can't think of why.
Not gay enough
Fridays are nice: Assault Lily, Majo no Tabitabi, and Tonikaku Kawaii. Full of wholesome content
Munou na Nana was an absolutely wild ride this week as usual
xD
Is Ghost Stories that one with "Not because you're a rabbit, but because you're black"
Sport Climbing Girls is getting wilder and wilder with the analysis scenes for Konomi. It's great
Off topic, but I finally found out why the VA for Eihemia from the recent Majo no Tabitabi sounded so familiar. Because she also voices Misaka from Railgun
I hope they stick with that animation because I really wanna watch the trainwreck of animation thats gonna be
But regardless of how good the plot is, that animation is gonna wreck most chances of it being well received lol
I think I remember reading a bit of the manga for Ex-Arm awhile ago. I wasn't too into the plot, but it wasn't necessarily terrible.
I wonder if this will manage to beat Gibiate for worst rating on MAL
That's uhhhh, certainly some animation
How could the information be wrong? Its not like anyone can dispute that it looks bad xD
Yeah she definitely didn't leave the best impression with that stunt
<:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
I wasn't a big fan of Saya at first, but after seeing how hard she goes after Elaina I support her.
Elaina is lookin cute af in this week's Majo no Tabitabi
Yeah that gift was kinda out of the blue, but ||Considering Shimamura was saying it was for her kid sister iirc I guess it makes sense||
Yeah the vibe I'm getting is that it's moreso about the journey of getting there rather than them being together which is fine.
<:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
Don't get me wrong, it's still great, I'm just a horny gremlin and wanna see the gay
Adachi and Shimamura is baiting me hard so far, gimme the confession already, I wanna see the gay
Damn, assault Lily is one I look forward too every week
<:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
> No lily bouquet this week
Wait there isn't? Why?
Its always fun going down the seiyu rabbithole and realizing "Oh hey, this VA voiced that character too"
I've heard the name a lot, but never checked it out. Maybe I'll throw it on the list to watch eventually
<:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
I probably have like at least 40 or 50 titles on my list that have 10 or less chapters that I have no idea if there's ever gonna be more.
Its a shame when there's only a few chapters of something and you have no idea if it's even being translated anymore or just abandoned
There's only like one of these in these huge lists that I actually recognize just from the name, The Magical Revolution of the Reincarnated Princess and the Genius Young Lady.
I didnt realize there were so many villainess stories lol
Ooh, I wanna yoink some recommendations from the list too lol
Hmm, this is pretty catchy
Ah, I've heard of it but never seen it
What's the one to the left of K-On?
From what I've heard the LN's are probably something I should read if I wanna understand whats going on at all. Because the magic systems are basically not explained at all in the anime
I feel like nothing is really happening right now in munou na nana. Its just a repeat of the same stuff thats been happening
It's always fun to see a convo that's just covered in spoiler tags. Forbidden knowledge
Even if it's something that's not yuri, but I can picture it as vaguely yuri if I squint my eyes. That's fine too
Oh yeah I'm aware of that
I'm interested
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
Ooh it gets more gay? maybe I'll have to catch up on it
Ah, I'm a few episodes behind in that so I didn't recognize it lol
What anime is that?
Saya knows what she wants and goes for it. I can appreciate that
I had to think about which one the title applied to when I saw it because I've read a few different titles where the guy gets kicked out of a hero party lol
I was literally reading this a couple days ago so it was unexpected to see an adaptation announced for me lol
Ah there's a better one
I'm not familiar with this source or how valid it is, but if it's true than that's pretty neat. https://twitter.com/moca_news/status/1328518289128005632 An adaptation of "I Was Kicked out of the Hero’s Party Because I Wasn’t a True Companion so I Decided to Have a Slow Life at the Frontier"
The 4 chapters of the manga that are out have convinced me to read the LN, I'm interested in where this is gonna go lol
I'm only 1 chapter in, but I Favor the Villainess is already hilarious
Its hard to listen to that and not think about Hibiki because Aoi Yuuki is the VA
Although there's also the possibility that ||As a result of the new girl appearing it drives some character development for Shimamura||
Also, ||I swear this new girl better not start messing things up between Adachi and Shimamura||
I just watched it and damn, Adachi is thirsting hard for Shimamura
Well I looked at it before I've watched it, but that just makes me more excited
I remember watching that in the theater, good stuff
Ah I havent seen it yet
Really? I thought it was less horny
Interesting, I remember seeing that title but I haven't read it
I feel like that image is familiar, what's it from?
> FUCK
> I CAN ONLY HEAR HIBIKI
Same...
Damn thats cute
Maybe it changes based on  her mood
I like Tazusa's random interjection of "Want to try cat food with me"
This week's assault lily is full of hilarious interactions
Tonikaku Kawaii is always such a nice dose of wholesome
Like, some of these have 2 chapters and were last updated like 8 months ago. But you know what, maybe there'll be another update, I still have hope lmao
<:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
Yep
I finally decided to put all the random manga I've been reading into a list and it totaled to 127 titles. Though a lot of those only have like a couple chapters translated and are probably abandoned by now.
Well, the subs on the version I watched were atrociously bad, but the Haifuri movie was pretty dank
Girl's last tour was great
Oh my god what the hell is this plot for the recent Strike Witches
Adachi's gay panic is a highlight of the show
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
Well once I can figure out why torrents never wanna download I'll probably give it a shot. Ty
Oh do you download the subs and actual movie separately?
nyaa always confuses me because theres so many versions when I search for something and idk which one is what Im looking for
Where did you watch it Iski? The only subbed version I could find had subs that were absolutely terrible
I got some sub recommendations earlier, but I gotta figure out how to fix the problem of torrents never wanting to download first unless I can find decent subs somewhere i can stream it.
Im gonna have to rewatch it when I can get some proper subs because the subs I did watch it with were *really bad*
Yeah I kinda wish there was more ship action
I just want to watch the cute girls with big weapons, I don't need this high iq plot nonsense disrupting my experience
Assault lily seems to be building some kind of plot, but I have no clue wtf it is
I think I watched 1 ep of that and lost interest
Is that a S2 announcement I assume?
I'm like 5 episodes behind in fruit tart. I wanna catch up but I have so much irl stuff to do
I remember watching Death Note and Fate/Zero with my brother, but I haven't gotten any others in my family to watch some anime with me.
I remember hearing that about tonikawa when the season began, but I didn't expect they would make it as obvious as they are
I remember hearing good things about it, but I haven't seen it myself
Have fun on the journey
<:KirikaPog:605209108827734017>
Memes aside, I honestly didn't think it was that bad. I mean sure it definitely wasn't good, but it wasn't completely terrible to me
Wdym, Skelter Heaven is amazing
Precure's hard without a name drop lol
More precure? Oh no, AMQ is gonna get even worse
Is Initial D unrealistic? I wouldn't know lol
https://mangadex.org/title/36283/looking-up-to-magical-girls I assume
Oh nice, I wouldn't have expected that
Yeah looking at this list I don't think I'm familiar with any of these
Hmm, I'm not really that familiar with this kinda thing having only really heard that song. While it has its charm, I think I'd prefer the yoshino nanjo songs.
Fripside is <:KirikaPog:605209108827734017>
I knew from the preview it wasn't gonna be a happy one, but god damn
Holy shit that Majo no Tabitabi episode
Boat anime <:KirikaPog:605209108827734017>
I should catch up on all the anime this season I'm behind on. Tallying it up, there's like 23 episodes of stuff this season I need to watch to be up to date.
Ah so thats what it was from, I knew it looked familiar
You sure commented a lot Ikxi
That reminds me of the guy on reddit keeping track of all the "onii-sama"s per episode
I can hear the *onii-sama* from that image
Ayy man don't be hating on Haifuri the real best boat anime
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
Listening to this fate talk having no clue whats going on
What's the difference btwn 2003 and brotherhood
That's quite the praise
I should throw that one on my list too xD
<:HibikiFingerguns:688429715836502063>
I'll just throw it on the plan to watch list and probably never get around to it
I should watch that at some point
Tbf there's no real reason most of that had to be spoilered but <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
||Oof if thats the case then I'll have to wait because there's no chance I'm gonna give money to crunchy||
||Then I'll be left with the struggle of if I should read the manga when the anime ends or wait and see if there'll be a second season||
||Damn, I don't wanna be left on a cliffhanger when it's starting to get into things like this.||
||Yeah he just got introduced||
||That was the name of the last episode so I assume so||
||I really hope new boi lasts and doesn't get killed like next episode||
It's crazy how this just keeps getting more and more wild
I just caught up on the latest couple episodes of Munou na Nana. Holy shit
Oh hey I was reading that the other day
I watched like half of Index S1 but got bored
Railgun is <:KirikaPog:605209108827734017>
I just finished the adachi episode. Damn it Adachi , just GO FOR IT already
I'll probably wait for the anime adaptation and if I like it then I'll check out the manga.
Gotta admit though, tags like "Gore, Horror, and Psychological" are kinda spooky. I just want nice and wholesome yuri
Maybe I'll give that one a shot, I've always skipped over it when looking for yuri manga in the past.
This week's assault lily ||I SWEAR THEY BETTER NOT KILL YURI OFF, JUST LET RIRI AND YUYU RAISE THEIR CHILD IN PEACE||
<:KirikaPog:605209108827734017>
Cute Girls Doing Ice Hockey?
I'm glad this week's Majo no Tabitabi is nice and wholesome, I really needed that after last weeks episode
This week on Gochiusa, Rize lookin cute af
This week's Munou na Nana was interesting ||We finally get some backstory for Nana (assuming she's telling the truth that is). Jin also had some interesting statements like about how there was someone in his class who talked about the kill counts. So we get some hints about the organization. There's a new dead body and it wasn't Nana so I'm guessing it was probably Jin or some other student. If it was Jin maybe it was to throw the trail off of Nana, but if it was another student I wonder what the motive is. I'm curious how Kyoya and Nana are gonna behave in the investigation and how the other class members are gonna react.||
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
Tbh I hope there are some weird translations so I can see memes about it in here
I wonder how the translation will be and if we'll get more sunbeam
I really want a GX Bluray since it's my favorite season, so I do hope that it comes sooner rather than later
I'd be pretty surprised if they announced GX, but I'd gladly welcome it if they did
<:ChrisDJ:690470897194369034>
Just gave it a listen, I could jam to that
Is it? Interesting
Now that I think about it, why is Attack on Titan airing so much earlier than all the rest of the winter season stuff?
Ooh Nanoha would be really nice too
Gimme a GX Bluray
<:KirikaPog:605209108827734017>
Seeing that makes me realize that I basically don't know any male VA's
<:ChrisBang:702166093065748500>
Most of the 'legit' streaming services out there either have too small a catalog, or a video player that's awful or both. Pirating sites solve both those problems for me
I'd consider moving from a pirate site if there was actually a decent alternative out there
I've long abandoned both funimation and crunchyroll due to the issues I've had with them
Bofuri reference <:KirikaPog:605209108827734017>
All I know about it is that I've heard good things, but beyond that I'm basically going in blind which I prefer anyway
I forget, is the spider anime in the upcoming winter season?
I can't wait for more wholesome camping
<:KirikaPog:605209108827734017>
Yuru Camp
||Have? Or is it had? <:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970> ||
I'm enjoying it <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
Oh dang, I didn't realize today was Thursday. I'll have to watch that adachi episode later
Shimamura is great
<:KirikaPog:605209108827734017>
Cute Girls Doing Ice Hockey
This week's assault lily ||Was really sad, not just Riri and Yuyu but everyone else is suffering a bit too. I just wanna see em be happy||
I hope some of them get second seasons
This season's anime is starting to get close to their ends. It's a bit sad
<:ChrisPray:672578403156885504>
It's sad that we only have one more episode of Elaina. 2nd Season pls
Saya knows what she wants
Isn't there two cells at work anime airing next season
For me it's kinda the opposite. There's more sequels next season for stuff I've watched than there is this season. But there's also less original anime next season that I'm interested in compared to this season.
Now that I'm looking at it, I think I'll actually be watching less next season than I am this season
Yeah next season has a lot to look forward to
I feel like to have any clue what's going on in mahouka I need to read the LN.
||NOOO! How could they do that to Michiru! <:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970> ||
Yeah Tonikawa just name drops everything. I'm pretty sure theyve mentioned stuff like Sony, panasonic, the iphoneX
There was so much street fighter content in that ep
ara ara white blood cell
Winter's got a lot of good stuff
Maybe I'll throw it on the list and get to it eventually. My heart needs some time to recover after what I just watched
Is Clannad something that's gonna make me cry again?
I finally got around to watching Angel Beats and oh man, now I'm sitting here crying at 2am
yeah it ended
Yeah I organized all the manga I'm reading into mangadex not that long ago and it made it so much easier to keep track of it
Ooh, yuri manga you say? I better check it out <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
And it had a nice ending too
I've only seen like 4 of those
Anyways, my point was that I haven't seen anything before like 2009
That's quite the face
Anilist has a pretty good representation of how I basically haven't seen any older anime
This looks like some real boomer stuff
I really hope that we do get a GX release from them, I'd love to have a copy of my favorite season
Oh yeah that thing from discotek is today isnt it? Any gear announcements?
Yeah I saw that, no clue what its about but looks good
Sounds interesting
<:KirikaPog:605209108827734017>
Damn solo, that's pretty impressive. Mine is like half of that
Oh man, that was quite the adachi episode
Yeah but I'd rather see the gay than read the gay
Yeah I think out of this season, tabitabi is the anime I'd most want another season of. A second nana season would be really nice because I still have no clue where the hell that roller coaster of an anime is going. But I'd take more wholesome stuff like adachi or tonikawa instead if I had the chance.
https://twitter.com/tonikawa_anime/status/1339971551588839424 an OVA for Tonikawa is nice, but I'm still holding on to hope for another season.
This week's Assault Lily episode was wild, lots of stuff being revealed and coming together
I really hope there is one because this has been my favorite anime this season, but I don't have high hopes
Oh shit there was an ending scene too
That majo no tabitabi episode was amazing
<:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
That means that there'll be more fate in AMQ
I have like 4 anime this season that I watched a few episodes of and need to catch up on and watch the rest of now that everything is starting to end or has ended
Chat out here lookin more censored than an MKUltra document
Y'all out here knowing what's gonna happen in nana and I'm just waiting after watching last episode wondering ||IS MICHIRU GONNA BE OKAY? IS SHE DEAD? THEY BETTER NOT HURT PRECIOUS BEST GIRL LIKE THAT||
Ah
mid?
But no instead we get second seasons of things like "I'm Standing on a Million Lives" which did anyone even watch that thing?
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>  I guess it's a preference thing. If the choice is there I always prefer to watch an anime or read the manga compared to reading a LN.
<@!199928870810419200> You're our resident love live expert aren't you? What are your thoughts?
I've heard that before, is it really that bad?
I think I enjoyed school idol project more tbh, but it wasn't bad.
Finally finished sunshine, or at least the first season
I wonder how much I've read, I don't keep track of it like that
I'm no expert on file sizes, but isn't that a massive amount of manga?
Ikxi what do you even do with 69gb of manga on your phone
Alright, now that I got some food time to finish watching sunshine
You know, I thought this about the first one too with A-RISE , but the songs from the main groups competition are always bangers
Alright so I'm halfway through sunshine and my conclusion thus far is that Riko is adorable.
Well, time to add Sunshine S2 to my ptw list and get to it eventually along with the other 100 anime on there <:Ver:704169051391524875>
One thing that I was kinda sad with sunshine though was that I had hoped to see some of the girls from muse appear at least somewhere even if it was just a cameo.
As long as they're passable subs aren't a huge concern to me anyway. I've only ever watched one thing where the subs were just absolutely unbearable.
I'll probably watch it anyway for completionist sake, also I so I can see some more of my favorites You and Riko
I've heard of tamayura but apparently i didnt have it on my list
Yama no susume is great
I feel like basically nothing at all happened in Slow Start
||Don't worry it gets even worse in episode 11||
Welcome to the club
Assault lily is great
<:ChrisBang:702166093065748500>
I can't participate in any of that discussion, but what I can say is that I just watched this week's episode of nana. ||Holy shit I'm glad best girl Michiru is okay after that cliffhanger last week. Also, damn that backstory, she's such a good girl. Nana better not fuckin try anything. "Revival" That's quite the worrying next episode title. ||
I've only seen the occasional mention of it from lank in here
Well, I guess I know what I'm watching tonight
I haven't looked too extensively at next season, but I think I'm watching (or at least going to check out) about 20 titles as well
I only watched like 2 episodes of it but apparently it starts getting kinda gay so I have that to look forward to
I think this season there's 17 anime that I'm watching. I'm up to date with all of em except Sigrdrifa, standing on a mil lives, and fruit tart
For me it's: Wednesday has Kuma Kuma Kuma Bear, Our Last Crusade or the Rise of a New World, Strike Witches ; Thursday has Adachi ; Friday has Assault Lily ; Saturday has GochiUsa, Warlords of Sigrdrifa (though I'm several episodes behind there), Mahouka ; then Sunday has Nana
Yeah but its still sad
<:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
I just noticed that basically everything I'm watching is ending this week
I enjoyed that one, while not anything too fantastic it actually had a somewhat interesting plot going on
I can't wait for S2, gonna be more comfyness
I caught up on all the episodes I was behind and finished standing on 1,000,000 lives. I do think it got a lot more enjoyable in the last couple episodes. I'm curious where exactly it's gonna go from there so I'll probably end up sticking around for S2.
Shhh
Slime Isekai S2, Re:Zero S2 P2, Dr. Stone S2, Uma Musume S2, Non Non Biyori S3, Muskoku Tensei, Cells at Work, Cells at Work Black, Redo of Healer, Spider Isekai, Hidden dungeon, Last Dungeon, Yuru Camp, Ex-Arm, Urasekai Picnic, Wonder Egg, Idoly Pride, World Witches. I'm gonna have a lot to watch though I'll probably drop a few of them after a couple episodes
Wtf is the ending of that
I hope I can actually find that available somewhere when it airs
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
I might give it a few episodes
Same
"The anime's story begins when the protagonist, a 14-year-old girl named Ai Ooto, hears a mysterious voice while walking around town late at night. It gives her an egg, and beckons to her: "If you wish to change the future, you need only choose now. Now, believe in yourself, and smash the egg." It's not like the description clears anything up for Wonder Egg
Gibiate was such a disaster, I looked forward to watching it each week just I could see what terrible decision they made that episode
But this looks absolutely terrible and I can't wait to watch it. I have a feeling it's gonna be like Gibiate which was a trainwreck that you know is awful but you can't look away.
I read a couple chapters of the manga but wasn't all that into it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jCPQe9g-TE
Have you seen the trailer for ex-arm Iski?
I'm looking forward to the disaster EX-ARM is gonna be
Yeah looks like there's 17 anime airing next season that I'm interested in
On the topic of next season though, is there a good site that has an up to date list of all the stuff that's airing next season? Some I've checked don't seem to have everything listed
Oh lord *that* episode
<:ChrisEating:384879395829186560>
That looks amazing
I kinda wanna reread it again after seeing that
||AND AFTER THAT THEY HAVE THE AUDACITY TO HIT US WITH THE "See you next week" AT THE END. I NEED MORE DAMN IT||
||THE YURI IS HERE <:HibikiGay:670494484701773845> ||
Holy shit
Lemme read it now
🙋‍♂️
https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2020-12-23/kuma-kuma-kuma-bear-anime-gets-2nd-season/.167779 O shit I wasn't expecting this one to get a second season at all
Strike Witches had a nice ending ||Lots of lasers, pantsu, and of course no strike witches season is complete without some Miyafuji magic miracles. That ending song was really good too||
Girls doing fishing! They look cute, I can't wait.
<:MikuPraise:585839808765493249>
Beautiful
Unrelated, but holy shit Adachi is so precious. Gimme a Season 2 <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
I only watched like 2 episodes of fruit tart, I need to watch the rest of them
Looking at when stuff is airing next season, it looks like I'll have something to watch every day of the week.
D:
Don't worry Nova, I'm just over here talking about how great You is
I knew I'd see you here at some point
Now that they're all talking to each other I'm remembering them bit by bit
I mostly just remember the ones that were my favorites like Riko and You
Time to start Sunshine S2, now I gotta remember all their names again lol
The story did feel really rushed so if there were to be more content I hope they'd space it out appropriately
Interesting
*thigh*
Apparently there was something along the lines of saying that the story would "continue" but it's most likely just gonna be something to do with the mobile game.
Assault Lily ep 12 ||I felt like that episode was way too rushed and left some stuff out. Though the fighting scenes were really enjoyable to watch especially with the magie sphere getting thrown around and the final blow. Even though there's nothing explicit, Riri and Yuyu nearly naked in an enclosed space together is the closest this is gonna get to some yuri so I'll take what I can get. Overall it was a pretty enjoyable experience||
Also I forgot how great the OP was
Yeah I think ep 5 was where I had stopped so I didn't get to the good parts
I finally got up to date with Senyoku no Sigrdrifa before the final episode is airing and it's way more interesting than I was expecting. I kinda regret not catching up sooner.
I'd say I enjoyed it more than Sunshine S1, but I think that I enjoyed School Idol Project more
I stand by the same thoughts I had after S1 that You and Riko are my favorites.
Alright, I finished Sunshine S2
I liked Adachi, but just the style of the show wasn't the kind of thing I'm really into all that much.
Majo no Tabitabi was my favorite anime of this season
That's quite the judgement. I see where you're coming from tho
Rating tonikawa a 3? oof
It seems to work fine on my phone but not my PC <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>  Who knows
I already tried that
I'd consider disagreeing if I could actually read anything in that image
I just finished Sigrdrifa myself, I liked the sound effects in the OP tbh. I thought it was cool lol. It did feel a bit rushed near the end, but overall I enjoyed it.
See I don't, so that's probably part of the problem for me lol
I've heard it does, but I've never read it so idk
My problem with mahouka (at least the anime) is that it hardly explains anything so if you want to know what's going on you gotta read the LN it feels like.
||Well, despite being hit with that heartbreak, I am still really curious how things are gonna go next. The manga is a really tempting option||
||I feel like I probably don't want to know because I'm assuming it's sad af||
The real question though is how those of you who have read the manga ||knew what was gonna happen in the last episode and didn't warn me <:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>  God damnit my heart can't take that blow||
I gotta decide if I wanna wait for a potential S2 announcement or just give in and read the Nana manga
||AND THEN THEY'RE JUST GONNA FUCKIN LEAVE IT THERE AND GIVE ME THAT SAD CREDITS SCENE||
||HOW COULD THEY DO THIS||
That episode of Munou na Nana ||WHAT THE FUCK||
So, conclusions after watching the Sunshine movie ||You's cousin is not only cute af but also a great character too. This plot is all over the place, there's so many different things going on it feels like. Hell yeah more Saint Snow! I was sad that we only got like one song out of them in 2 seasons of Sunshine. Those costumes for the last song are rainbow-y as hell I love them. Also it feels like there was hardly any Riko. Overall though I enjoyed it, but I'd rate S2 higher. The worst problem of the movie though is the fact that there a criminally low amount of *Yousoro!*'s. ||
You know what, I might as well just do that now, why not
I need to watch the Sunshine movie, then maybe I'll watch the new love live
I won't lie though, after now realizing what it actually is, ~~I'm actually looking forward to it more~~
I just now realized that I've read the manga for Redo of Healer. Yeah now I realize why everyone is saying it's fucked up and gonna be controversial lol
I probably should get around to watching the rest of fruit tart, I only watched like 2 episodes and just never got around to watching the rest of them.
Fruit Tart has finished airing hasn't it?
Ooh that's some good stuff right there
I've been meaning to watch world trigger at some point, I watched a few episodes but never got around to continuing
Aren't there gonna be like 3 idol shows next season
It feels weird now that all the seasonal anime are over. Until next week at least. I don't have anything to look forward to watching each day.
You know, I keep saying I'm gonna sit down and watch that one, but I've just never gotten around to it.
You know, now that I think about it, I wonder if the reason that they introduce so many characters is so that they've got plenty of people to kill off.
Alright so I finished the first season of Attack on Titan. Because I've seen a lot of clips from the show here and there, there wasn't too much that I didn't expect which kinda killed some of the excitement for me. But that can't really be helped. One thing that did stand out though was the amazing OST, absolutely phenomenal.
Oh I'm sure
I know the show practically starts with mass slaughter, but man there's some dark shit going on here
I'm a few episodes in and my conclusion so far is that potato girl is best girl
So I'm finally getting around to starting Attack on Titan and man these songs are great.
I think I know what you're talking about, but I have no clue where I saw it
Oh man I completely forgot to consider fanfics, I'll have to look for some love live ones later
I just realized why something felt familiar to me about her, here's a cursed image
I'm only a couple episodes in, but my conclusions so far ||Yu is not at all what I was expecting, but she's precious; I love her already. The visuals are fantastic during the songs. Idk how I'm feeling about Ayumu yet, but I'm liking the dynamic between her and Yu so far. I'm loving Kasumi's personality, her reactions are great. She kinda reminds me of Honoka a bit for some reason.||
Ah I figured I'd summon you by just mentioning it
Alright I'm starting the new Love Live. I wonder how I'll feel about this one
Watching them early is nice, but that also means that I won't have any new episodes to see for 2 weeks after it starts airing. <:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
It's apparently some pre-air thing so idk where it was supposed to be available, but because pirating is a thing it's available if ya know where to look
Apparently episodes 1 and 2 of Mushoku Tensei are already available. It's good stuff
I'm basically gonna treat EX-ARM like Gibiate. Watching it because it's such a trainwreck that I wanna see more
Alright so I finished Nijigasaki ||It took me until like halfway through to realize that Yuu isn't actually an idol and is just playing a supportive role. I'm not too sure how I feel about that, but that's probably just because I like her as a character and wish I saw her more. I do like that they're changing up the plot a bit compared to School Idol Project and Sunshine. It's nice to not have to listen to the characters talking about going to Love Live all the time. But I feel like in the episodes we don't get to see much of the characters apart from those who are there main focus. Like, if the episode is focusing on one character, we hardly see the other characters at all. Which, while I get it, I do wish that the others had a little more presence (but maybe that's just me). With the focus on the characters individually we do get to listen to a lot more varied songs which I really enjoyed. Also, there's some nice gay going on which is always a plus. I'm not a huge fan of Ayumu though, she seems way too dependent on Yuu. Ai and Rina were probably my other favorites. Wait hold up, what's in that book? Did Yuu pass that exam? How dare they leave me with these questions? Overall it was a good watch though.||
||Yeah the ending did feel really rushed, there was a lot of stuff that felt glossed over or left out||
Nova out here promoting Love Live again
All I'm seeing is the small flying creature evolving into a super buff dude with angel wings to fight the big robot guy. As to any other context like what these things are, why that small thing turns super buff, why did it evolve, why they're fighting (are they fighting?) or any other context, who knows <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
Watching that while having no clue what's going on is an interesting experience
<:HibikiWhat:336656482907193344>
Oh god theres a diagram?
Tru, the visuals were really good in nijigasaki
Aside from the construction equipment lookin one, that chart actually makes sense
I'm watching this video, and this is some wild shit
I just kinda assumed it was like pokemon lol
Wait wait wait, these fuckin digimon talk?
Those are some pretty eyes
That's quite the diagram lmao
The animation was fine to me for the most part, there was just some wonky CG every now and then
I just watched the first episode, that was quite the experience.
Same, I was kinda surprised that horse girl anime got a second season, but i'm really looking forward to it
Yeah most of the shots they used CG for were just random walking scenes or similarly unimportant actions. It's weird
I forgot that they were also kinda idols until I got to the end of the episode tbh
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
I failed one of my calc classes, I wouldn't know
Now that I'm checking my list idk why I even thought that since I had the date written as next week too. Who knows
Oh man, I thought slime isekai S2 was airing today, but it turns out it was just a recap episode of S1.
Off topic, but Black Clover's new OP is nice
That reminds me, I gotta watch that demon slayer movie at some point
Yuru Camp was nice and comfy as usual
I feel like I need to watch a recap of Re:Zero, I just watched the new episode and am lost already.
Alright I just watched 'Kumo Desu Ga, Nani Ka?' and man all I can think of is Hibiki when the spider is talking lol
Yeah that's like the only song from madoka I remember, it's a banger.
Which one is the ED song again? Is it Magia?
O shit, they announced a date? I'm glad they did, but sad it's in 2022 so I have to wait at least another year <:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
Oh wait now that I'm reading this I realized that I actually *have* read it before
OwO, a yuri manga I haven't read? <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
<:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
February? That's sooner than I thought it'd be
Didn't Crunchyroll have a part in funding Gibiate too? <:Ver:704169051391524875>
It's such a trainwreck, I love it
The anime of the year for 2021, that's what you're looking at
A lot of what I'm watching are either second seasons so I already know what to expect, or something I've read the manga/LN for so I already know where the story is going.
I feel like nothing is really standing out for me this season so far, but maybe I gotta give it a few more episodes.
I just watched Ex-Arm and man that animation is certainly something
What chapter is that? For a friend of course....
Oh wait, that's not even a dime. Apparently it's an Eisenhower dollar, and also a specially minted bicentennial coin. What an interesting choice.
Also, why would they even be carrying around american currency in japan
What an oddly detailed dime.
I'm watching through it now and am liking it so far
Semi-related but when I was looking at Teio's VA, I found she voiced someone in 'Rifle is Beautiful' which I was literally reading the manga for yesterday and had no clue there was even an anime. So that's a nice find for me
I just wanna see happy horse girls
Oh hey that frame is like 30 seconds into the episode lol
That reminds me, I need to watch ep 2
Oh yeah I remember seeing this, it looked really nice but I have no clue wtf its about
Is there an explanation for what's supposed to be going on here? Because I'm actually curious tbh
My first thoughts were that it gave me a Flip Flappers vibe
This seems like some big brain analysis thats too high iq for me lol
Eh?
Alright, I'm just making sure I'm not the only one here lmao. I tend to miss a lot of things when I'm watching something
Like, I think I kinda get what's going on. But it's still really confusing lol
So, I just watched 'Wonder Egg Priority'. Was I supposed to understand any of what the hell just happened?
Based on that description I expected it to be lewd for some reason
Just finished Attack on Titan S2, that was a wild ride, but I'm sure it will get even more wild.
I just watched ep 1, it's about what I expected
I've only read the manga, are the LN's even worse?
It's uhh certainly going to be something
<:HibikiWhat:336656482907193344>
Hopefully it covers the chapters i'm really looking forward to seeing adapted.
Kaguya sama is also getting a 3rd season too at some point
Like, I had no idea the 1st movie released like 6 years after S1 rather than like 1 year for example
Ah fair. Since I watched it after it had all released, I guess I never gave any thoughts to the release dates
Oh is that the case? I knew there was a difference in what got covered plot-wise but I had no idea the animation quality was different as well.
The animation on that looks better than I remember
That one's been on my plan to watch list for a long time but I've never gotten around to it, maybe I'll make it my next watch.
It's really nice knowing when everything will air
I don't remember doing anything special, that's just how my home page looks like
That one is Anilist
Yeah Egg was quite the experience
With Dr.Stone S2 airing today I think I've started all the anime I'm interested in this season
There's the fantastic 'Henkei Shoujo' transformations <:Ver:704169051391524875>
I just never paid for windows in the first place 😎
Don't worry, I have the same message on my screen too lol
"Activate Windows"
Very comfy indeed
The narrator is such a good part of Kaguya sama
Ah they look so cute <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
Yeah I can't agree with "best antagonist" at all for MHA, but I really enjoyed that fight scene
And I've seen basically none of them xD
Since its only a few episodes so far and I just finished S3, I caught up with AoT S4. And man that's a hell of an episode.
So I just finished the rest of Attack on Titan S3. Man, what a wild ride that was
||Yeah with how much of a fuckin badass he is with the sword, it'd be a shame to make him use a gun instead||
||Ooh, I didn't even notice that detail||
||Reminds me of https://www.reddit.com/r/thingshomuradidwrong/||
I've seen it all and I enjoy them both but I think I like black a bit more
I just caught up on cells at work black, it's quite the experience
Mushoku tensei is pretty horny
Oh yeah I need to watch the new ep of that
Well, Kiniro Mosaic has like 2 seasons and with this it'll be 2 movies as well. So I guess that's a lot more than you'd expect a CGDCT SoL anime to get.
<:KirikaPog:605209108827734017>
Hmmm <:HibikiWhat:336656482907193344>
Is there like any info on what it's about? How do I get hyped about something I don't know anything about
Slow burn is fine there's nothing wrong with it, but I guess I'm just always expecting something more. So I always get a little disappointed when hardly anything happens.
Tbh I went into Urasekai expecting yuri, but after seeing what's really going on I basically abandoned that expectation and am just enjoying the other aspects of it.
OwO, Cute girl anime you say?
I feel like I never see Hakumei and Mikochi mentioned anywhere
It sounds kinda sad
Oh hey I literally just saw that article, like 20 seconds ago lmao
It's certainly an experience
Idk how I'm supposed to be feeling about Wonder Egg so far
I barely even noticed the CGI in AoT tbh
Nanoha <:KirikaPog:605209108827734017>
Oh hey I was reading that one earlier, good stuff <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
Wait it is? <:TsubasaJoy:688191716620238870>
Some of these sound interesting, I'll have to look into them
I'd probably give my vote for least interesting anime of last year to 'Princess Connect' or 'Koi to Producer: EVOL×LOVE' Those were two that just didn't have anything interesting going at all for me.
I feel like God of High School was basically incomprehensible plot wise, but the fight scenes were cool
Maybe we'll get more grandpa next episode
Yuru Camp was nice and comfy as expected. New girl is adorable as well
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
Maybe you just forgot you had it
Yeah looking through my list the only other idol anime I've seen is Lapis Re:LiGHTs
I don't really think of gear as an idol anime
I think Love Live is basically the only idol anime I've seen
Careful, those words are gonna summon Nova here
I avoided Idol stuff until I watched Love Live at which point I realized it's basically just CGDCT with some music.
It had really interesting worldbuilding which I enjoyed
I feel like this is something I've seen a lot, but know basically nothing about
Just wait for StrikerS, then it'll be fine to talk about all the gay
Snacks indeed <:ChrisMunch:688191202973319198>
Iris is best girl
Oh hey that's a good one 👌
wtf
Yeah this is uhhhh
Hold up, what's going on here
He just always seems to have a convenient solution to solve every problem. It's just not interesting to watch for me
I really like the other characters as well. The main guy is a big reason why I'm not a huge fan of it I think.
I suppose I'm somewhat the opposite. I didn't really enjoy mondaiji tachi much.
I enjoyed NGNL
<:TsubasaPeek:623246193002151938>
I was literally just reading that, what a coincidence. I've even got the tab still open. <:KirikaPog:605209108827734017>
I think that ||He can just choose not to heal, Back in S3(?) when Reiner was injured in that castle with everyone else his arm was injured but wasn't healing for example||
And then there's ||Eren using jaw guy to fucking chomp the crystal with the warhammer titan then drinking her blood. Eren's not fucking around this season||
Holy shit this season of Attack on Titan is insane
Koisuru as an F? Oof <:MikuCry:688397678584791074>
Yeah uhh, I don't think I would've expected that
On the list it goes!
Yuri harem you say?
Aren't there like 8 seasons or something
It's really good, I'm surprised I didn't know about it.
So I learned earlier today that Kase-san has an hour long anime adaptation and man was that a nice and wholesome watch.
I wish they gave the names instead of just the images, it'd make this a lot easier
Idol shows are just CGDCT with some music as a bonus
Also, am I expected to recognize all of these just by the image
Oh my, that's a lot of titles
There's way more than enough content to adapt too
Gimme a New Game S3 <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
Wait, I just noticed after watching that wonder egg ep, ||The new character is an idol and they're voiced by the same VA who voices You from Love Live Sunshine. No wonder they seemed familiar||
Holy shit how are they just gonna end that ep like that
Wait hang on I gotta watch this
I gotta catch up on it, I think I'm an episode behind
Wait, that one has Ayahi?
Ooh I don't think I've seen this one, I'll check it out, ty <:ChrisWave:738169593574719568>
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
Yuri you say? Got any recommendations?
Same, I don't think it will get one, but I'd still like to see another regardless
Assault Lily was good, it was pretty much as close to yuri as it could get without any actual yuri.
Yeah I guess I'll have to wait to see their actual personalities
I feel like none of the girls particularly stand out for me, maybe it's just because there's less of them idk
I've heard nothing but praise about jujutsu kaisen, maybe I'll check it out after it's finished airing
Until I heard people talking about it, I had no clue there was anything about goblin slayer that was controversial in any way
Oh wow, I wouldn't have expected that. I'm looking forward to it
<:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
Ah that one
From what I've seen, that's what most opinions are
If you say it's gay though, then I'm looking forward to it <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
Oh hey, I think I've read a chapter or two of that one
Wait there are some gay ones?
Also, apparently there's a lot of anime adaptations that got announced just recently, some of them look good <:KirikaPog:605209108827734017>
Just caught up on the latest AoT episode ||SASHA NO, YOU BASTARD HOW COULD YOU DO THAT TO POTATO GIRL||
I think I'd consider it to be yeah, but I can also see the reasoning for saying it isnt
Yeah
OwO, we talking about CGDCT in here?
You know, I'd rather watch that than a bunch of girls thirsting after a guy
Guys? <:KirikaDisgust:688431636043268097>  Gimme the girls liking other girls <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
Maybe I'll check out the LN, I've only read the manga so I'm probably missing out on a ton of content
Is the LN complete? Or is it still ongoing
I think Crunchyroll has EX-ARM
Same, because I'm watching a lot if I slack off and end up missing some episodes I end up having like 16 episodes of anime that I gotta catch up on.
Speaking of manga, I've been reading through Futaribeya. It's some really good wholesome stuff, ty for that recommendation Fenny <:HibikiGay:670494484701773845>
Those eyes are huge
I've heard really good things about promised neverland, is S2 not keeping up?
Wait I didn't realize that was Mio's VA. Interesting
I watched the wonder egg ep, all the characters are great
Oh is today egg day? I gotta go watch it
I forgot it even had a gacha
What anime come on Friday?
Teio be cute
That's cute af
CGDCT you say? On the list it goes <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
They're cute
I feel like steins gate is one of those really popular anime that I just haven't seen like Fullmetal Alchemist for example
ooh 87 chapters, maybe I'll read it next. Ty for the recommendation
I've seen it a few times when looking through stuff but I've never checked it out, how is it?
Oh?
Now I want to read some more yuri
That picture reminds me of "The Magical Revolution of the Reincarnated Princess and the Genius Young Lady "
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
Ooh that's a good one
Oh hey, I just now realized that Nana Mizuki voices Vanessa in Black Clover. I'm surprised I never noticed before
||That sounds like a reasonable explanation, I don't think there's anywhere we were supposed to get that information yet unless I just missed something||
||Huh, interesting. I guess we'll probably find out next ep though. The subs say he's her "School counselor" so I guess not necessarily her teacher. Also, I get the vibe that he's trying to (or is) dating Ai's mom, but maybe that's just me||
||I think it's this guy? I'm not 100% sure tbh. Maybe that's her dad? The teacher guy appears early on but I don't think it shows their face. Unless I'm just missing something||
||Its the teacher guy that has come to her house before||
Although I'd love for them to release all of the seasons, I really hope we do at least get GX so I can get my favorite season as physical media <:CarolSmug:617040484111745027>
The world building there is really neat
Lapis is nice
Oh is the first only 11?
Mushoku is really good, I wonder how far the anime will get
Havent all the Re:Zero episodes been super long too
I'm not familiar with the source material, does Demon Slayer have a finished story?
I feel like this season I'm not paying attention at all to what days stuff is airing. It's just "Oh hey, that aired today? Cool, guess I'll watch it later"
That's an interesting choice for the thumbnail
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
Ooh that sounds interesting
Also, I just wanna say that the OP in the last ep with all the sound effects was really cool
Yeah the ending did feel pretty rushed
Yeah it really picks up in the later half. I remember stopping at around 4 and not being too into it. Then I finally got around to catching up to the rest of it I was surprised how much it improved.
That's pretty interesting lmao
When I watched the PV it was just "Huh, well I have no idea what's going on but it looks really pretty"
Wonder egg is such an unexpectedly good show this season.
Oh god *that* episode
Swimsuit ep aside, for the amount of eps they did have I think they did a good job fitting all that content in. They even had ep 1 which was basically 2 episodes.
Maybe we could've gotten more character development if we weren't busy having that swimsuit episode.
Azuzu is a good girl
👌
Aight, I'll keep that in mind if I do end up reading the manga
Maybe after the anime finishes, I'm not *that* impatient yet
Well I guess I'll just have to wait and see
Now I'm worried <:MariaScared:672584661125431299>
Uhh ||The two girls met with the US(?) military guys and just arrived at their base(camp?)||
I finished ep 5, this is getting interesting
She's such a good girl
I'm catching up on Urasekai and Kozakura is precious as hell
All I can think of when I hear her voice in the spider isekai is Hibiki
<:HibikiScreech:633468460030230548>
Wonder Egg has some nice animation, like this for example
Yeah wonder egg is really good
Yeah I figured that was the case, I just couldn't help but see the resemblance.
Also Fenny, unrelated, but your profile pic reminds me of this girl from twintail.
Yeah yeah, I'm sure you already know all the horrifying stuff that's probably gonna come. I'm happy in my ignorance
Also, after finishing the latest ep||Those military guys are suspicious as fuck, I hope we don't see them again but I have a feeling we will.||
We're only like halfway through Urasekai but I'm already really invested in where this story is going.
That's quite the title

On the backlog it goes <:KirikaPog:605209108827734017>
Ooh that sounds interesting
What's that for?
I can't wait to watch today's egg episode later
<:ChrisMunch:688191202973319198>
What a great gif
New Frieren <:KirikaPog:605209108827734017>
Yeah I feel like it's definitely shaping up to be one of those shows where you can rewatch it and find all sorts of new things now that you know where its going
Yeah ||All we can do is speculate, considering we're not even halfway done yet literally anything can happen||
||he just emanates creepy vibes, he also seems like he's trying to get with Ai's mom which is creepy too||
Man that Wonder Egg ep was great ||The dynamic they have as a group is really fun to watch. Rika and Ai are such a great combo. Poor Neiru, she seems to be going through a lot, well all of them do to be fair. But I really do wanna hear more about her background. Also Rika seems to have more going on as well which I'm interested in.  Also, Sawaki is suspicious as fuck, I don't trust him.||
I ended up reading a couple chapters and getting invested enough to read all of it. That was a good read
Is Clannad a sad one?
I think I'm like 3 episodes behind in Re:Zero
Oh it finally got an OP?
Ooh OP skeleton knight boi
All I know about revue starlight is that the outfits look really cool
I've only seen a couple eps of Ex-Arm so far, but I see clips of later episodes here and there and its just as bad as the first eps were. No improvement at all lmao
Wait that girl kinda reminds me of Honoka lmao
Oh hey that one's on my list
"Not many" Does that mean someone has?
Yeah but like, maybe I just don't have a grasp on how big that window is, but it seems like it's *really* huge. Far bigger than a normal tuna would be
Huh, interesting. But wait, is it just a perspective thing or is that tuna actually really huge?
Wait, is that *space* outside that window?
It may just a big ad, but I'm really looking forward to it. It looks really pretty
This is the girls riding motorcycles anime right?
Yeah the best I can find are usually camrips, and while technically I could watch it like that, I'd much rather not.
It's a shame when a movie releases but I can't find it anywhere to watch <:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
Also, that's a fantastic emote name
Yeah but will "eventually" be soon after release, or months after release is the real question
Wait <:KirikaPog:605209108827734017> , I completely forgot about this. Is this just gonna air in Japan, or am I actually gonna be able to find it somewhere?
<:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
Maple's true power is quite the attack
No, begone with that thought
<:MikuDelete:661660028410920990>
The only bad episode is the last one, because that means there won't be any more Yuru Camp <:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
I just want GX, AXZ and XV would be cool, but they're a lower priority for me
GX better be on that list
You know it's coming the whole time, but still <:MikuCry:688397678584791074>
I need to watch that one, though I haven't heard good things about it lol
<:MikuDelete:661660028410920990>
Ooh she's cute
Fun fact Nova, when I first watched Love Live I immediately thought of the main girl from Haifuri when I saw Honoka lol
The movie is somewhat recent so you might have to look around for somewhere to watch it
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
Don't forget to watch the Haifuri OVA's and Movie too
Who needs boat girls when you can have girls *and* boats
Those are some nice boats
Yeah luckily people here are good about spoilers
Seeing the whole demon lord thing made me wanna avoid the discussion posts about spider isekai because I know people are gonna post "theories" that are really just facts because they've read the LN.
The OP and ED are bangers too
Hibiki as a spider
Oh dank, more Demon Slayer. I still gotta watch the movie
Join us
Yes, you do
WEP is good stuff
I see a lot of yuri art of little witch academia, I gotta add that to my list
I googled it, yeah that looks absolutely awful lmao
There's henkei shoujo, does that one count?
Some what now
The plot might not have been the greatest, but I really enjoyed the fights in that one
I just got caught up on Mushoku Tensei, probably one or two more episodes until one of the parts I'm really looking forward to seeing animated <:KirikaPog:605209108827734017>
Man, I have absolutely no clue what's going on in Urasekai but I'm enjoying it
I mean now that I think about it, yeah I can see that
Oh its the same author?
It's always fun seeing things you've read some of get an adaptation when you weren't expecting it at all
Ahh sulfuric acid, reminds me of chem lab
I like how Dr. Stone gives a disclaimer at the end. I wonder if that's just there for liability purposes or if someone's actually tried the stuff they saw and gotten hurt.

Also I just wanna say how much I love Rika
Damn that egg episode, we're only like halfway through so I wonder what's coming next
I wish I got to use fun chemicals in my genetics lab
Poor Kaos
Gimme a New Game S3 already
<:ChrisPray:672578403156885504>
It's like Kaos but in K-On!
I remember reading the manga for this a long time ago, the MC gives big Kaos vibes. I can't wait
MORE CUTE GIRL ANIME
<:KirikaPog:605209108827734017>
https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2021-02-18/bocchi-the-rock-4-panel-band-manga-gets-tv-anime/.169660
True, they're all the same but I love reading them all nonetheless.
Changing the formula up is nice every once in awhile, but I still like my generic isekais with OP MC's.
Ah, I think I've read that one
realist hero?
Ooh, I don't think I've really thought about OP/ED names. That's a neat fact
<:ChrisDJ:690470897194369034>
I forgot how much of a banger the Dr.Stone S2 OP is
You can do it anyway, I believe in you!
The guy narrating sounds kinda cool, but other than that the visuals of the trailer are uhh, *interesting*.
I feel like I don't really care at all about the students in the spider isekai. I just wanna see more Spider Hibiki
Gimme my Miyafuji magic shenanigans instead <:KirikaPog:605209108827734017>
Ah Brave Witches, I wasn't a huge fan of that one
They look familiar, who's that?
Oh nice
Wait it's Aoi Yuki that's gonna voice her?
On that topic, I wanna watch Crown Handler 1 but it's nowhere to be found <:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
Question: So with precure, is there any order that you gotta watch em in. I remember hearing somewhere that it doesn't really matter which ones you watch. Are they all just kinda standalone?
I remember I watched Tanya just so I could understand Isekai Quartet
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
Watch it so you can be prepared for Machikado S2
<:MariaScared:672584661125431299>
450 is quite a lot
Oh hey is that the gay bear one I see? 👀
For a second I thought the one on the bottom was K-On lol
Ah that's what I figured more or less. A friend was asking about it but I wasn't positive how they worked. Ty
Shamiko became a demon girl who got a second season
None of the characters particularly stood out when I watched the character PV's for the new Love Live, but I guess I'll have to wait and see when it airs. Maybe I'll end up liking them more than I expect.
New girls are fine and all, but where's that Nijigasaki S2 at, I wanna see more Yuu
I figured Nova would find their way in here soon enough
I guess I'll find out how I feel about the new Love Live girls
<:KirikaPog:605209108827734017>
Urasekai is very spooky
Also, Kozakura is adorable as hell
Urasekai was a wild ride this week, the fuckin cats were hilarious
Wait, I didn't see this one https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2021-02-21/in-the-land-of-leadale-vr-isekai-story-gets-anime/.169812 More isekai <:KirikaPog:605209108827734017>
Three and a half hours doesn't sound too bad for covering 9 seasons. Maybe I'll give it a watch
Is Teekyuu that one that has like 8 seasons or something
Just watched this week's Wonder Egg, turtle boi is the real MVP
Sigrdrifa was fun, I miss my weekly Azuzu
All this talk about WEP when I can't watch it yet because I'm in class <:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
OwO, another isekai?
Honestly I think it's my favorite so far, Rika is such a great character
That's the lewd one right?
I really ought to watch that one day
Ghost stories dub xD
Best girl indeed
On the topic of Assassination Classroom, the dub is also really good
I don't even have a driver's license and I loved Initial D.
Ahh tanks, what a good sport
Maria's VA seems to be in a lot of stuff, but I never actually recognize her voice in any of it
I think the only other role that I recognized Chris's VA in was the blacksmith girl in SAO
S4 was fine for me until ||All the stuff that was shown after Eren went on his rampage in Marley and left|| That's where I got real confused
The last few episodes at least in the AoT anime I've had to look for a summary of what's going on because it's gotten kinda confusing
The only thing I know about Shirabe's VA is that she's in fripSide. Also, apparently she voices Eli in Love Live, I had no idea
I'm pretty sure on Anilist and MAL it's the top ranked anime (Though I'm well aware those kind of sites aren't really the best way to judge something)
What exactly is mecha?
<:TsubasaPeek:623246193002151938>
Oi oi twintail was great
Wait another season of the Chad himself would be amazing
Gaidens?
Aren't there a bunch of them
I remember the captain: Misaki, the Vice captain(?): Mashiro, and the captain's friend Moka(?)
Tori kaji ippai!
I forgot her name, but poor girl. Having to navigate through that mess
Yeah the movie wasn't great but at least it had a couple cool scenes
The best boat anime is clearly Haifuri tho <:HibikiFingerguns:688429715836502063>
Ah, I haven't seen Azur Lane, but Kancolle was alright tbh
KC and AL?
How could girls in tanks possibly be bad
I voted in the poll at least, that counts for something
<:TsubasaPeek:623246193002151938>
I remember reading the LN awhile ago but there might be more of it that has been TL'ed by now that I gotta check out
Ooh that's lookin real good
No no, you gotta use her actual name "Wilhelmina Braunschweig Ingenohl Friedeburg"
Also, I just noticed those cover arts <:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
Alright cool, guess I've got that to look forward to when I read it
Well if it was the end, then I guess it's somewhat of a completed story, yeah?
Wait, I see chapters labeled "Final Chapter" and "Epilogue", is volume 2 the end?
I finished the first volume of I Favor the Villainess, the last chapter took an unexpected turn but it was still really good. The second volume seems to be even longer so I'm looking forward to it <:KirikaPog:605209108827734017>
I forgot that I still had some software installed from when I needed some textbooks and ended up using Calibre
Rei is hornier than I remembered
“If you must step on me, then please stomp harder!” <:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
Time to go read it now <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
Btw, what do I use to read an EPUB file?
Alright I finished the second volume of 'I Favor the Villainess' That escalated quickly. Great story though
<:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
I didn't like Sora Yori at first but by the end I enjoyed it a lot
ye olde days? Are you a boomer Melua?
Time to make some tea so I can be comfy while watching Yuru Camp
I am kinda curious how it continues after Volume 2 tho, because it definitely felt like a completed story.
They look cool af
That cover is really nice
Only having watched the anime, Mahouka is just a big <:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>  for me
Ah maybe my phrasing was poor lol. Yeah, Anna Mugiho. Apparently she's voiced a couple other animals too
xD
Apparently the VA for the Alpacas in 'Love Live! School Idol Project', Anna Mugiho, also voiced Chika's dog in 'Love Live! Sunshine'. I never really thought about animal VA's lol
I'll keep using pirate sites until there's a paid option that's actually better
A 🏴‍☠️ website
Rip Aniwatch <:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>  Now I gotta find somewhere else to go
There aren't that many more episodes so I wonder how far it'll get.
Like, how am I gonna remember 400 chapters of content that I haven't looked at in months
Yeah there's quite a bit. Plus since it's been awhile since I've read it so if I jump back in I'll probably be confused about what's going on.
I should catch up on the WN at some point
Tragically, there's so much good content to look forward to too
Yeah
Last manga chapter I know of is Chapter 44
They cute
Ooh reincarnated as a sword is a good one
Oh shit, we're finally starting the next part in Mushoku Tensei. Man, seeing it animated was so much cooler than I expected.
Lmao
Maybe I'll check it out at some point
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
You know, I hear y'all talk about it every week but I still have no idea. What exactly is Gekidol about?
Ah rip
Wait there isn't? <:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
Although I really like WEP, I feel like the story could be completed in the remaining episodes 9-12 without adding another.
Ah I didn't think about that
If they're calling it Episode 8, then does that mean we'll end on Ep 13 if it really doesn't count?
Do we know if Wonder Egg's recap ep is counting as one of the 12 episodes?
All the budget got spent on ep 4 clearly
One of my favorite parts was honestly the OP in the last episode. Sound effects are <:KirikaPog:605209108827734017>
But once it did it was pretty good
Yeah it definitely took a few episodes to really get going.
OwO, are those cute girls I see? <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
Hopefully there's a theater near me that's showing it
I've been looking forward to seeing the Violet Evergarden Movie
<:KirikaPog:605209108827734017>
Alright I'm interested now, I'll throw it on the list
Oh?
Hmmmmm, there's a lack of cute girls in these promo images. That's some points off in my book
I feel like that's one of those anime that's really popular but I've never seen it
I saw that title and thought it was yuri for a sec only to google it and be spooked
Listen Ikxi, I'm a low iq boi, this seems too high iq for me
Idk wtf's goin on, but spider isekai seems to be goin places
They give Miku vibes
Normally I'd go visit the r/anime discussion threads and see what people are saying, but there's a tendency that people who know what's gonna happen post their "theories" that just so happen to be exactly right. So I've been tending to avoid them
This week's Mushoku Tensei is coming in hot with a solid followup to last week's banger of an episode.
Yuru Camp is always so wholesome, I just caught up and Rin's grandpa is great
I want a full season of Fine engrish
Just dub it, but get the original cast to do it in english.
Very cursed indeed
<:MikuDelete:661660028410920990>
That's a lotta manga
OVA, Special, TV Short, ONA, etc.
Yeah 22% of mine is something other than TV or Movie
My total anime # is probably a bit inflated since there's a lot of OVA's/Shorts/etc. that bring the number up but aren't like an actual anime series
Anilist.co
I thought my number would be a lot lower than this
34 days <:KirikaPog:605209108827734017>
Kozakura is precious
<:ChrisPray:672578403156885504>
Alright time to tune in and pray for GX
When does it start?
Guess I'll just have to wait for it, but 219 was certainly building up to *something*
Oh? is 220 TL'ed somewhere already?
I just watched this week's Urasekai, poor fucking Kozakura. She just can't catch a break.
AYY THEY ANSWERED
Pretty much all the stuff they announced were things I've never even heard of lol
<:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
No GX
too high iq for me
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
So, the ending of this week's Egg ep
I wasn't expecting that one at all tbh
I just read it btw, holy shit
I've only seen less than half of those
I don't, but I'd be more than happy to get a ping about Comic Girls
I second this recommendation
I might end up checking it out when it airs, who knows
Oh it's that one? The english title wasnt anywhere so I didn't realize lol
I saw the cute girl thumbnail and got excited only to see a male character who looks important like 20 seconds in <:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>  Other than that though, I have no clue what it's about but the animation looks really good
SAIDO CHESTO
<:ChrisPray:672578403156885504>
All these nice Yuru Camp emotes
This gekidol talk *really* has me tempted to check out exactly why the hell I always hear about it making no sense one day
Is that the toothbrush one?
I've only seen a few episodes of Uma Musume this season and hearing that scares me
Yeah, you know what's coming the whole time, but it still hits hard when it does happen
I see a lotta girls here, I'm interested now
Judging by the titles in there I have seen, I'm gonna assume these are some sad stuff that I should watch at 3:00am and cry to yeah?
<:ChrisDJ:690470897194369034>
I could jam to this
Poor Maki
36$ shipping god damn
I mean I'm not surprised
Wow nova
God damn she cute
Maki was probably my favorite from μ's
Damn, though the full episode isn't all there, this week's AoT episode was a wild ride
Now that this seasons stuff is coming to an end I gotta check out what's airing next season and see what I'm gonna watch.
Off the top of my head though, I'd probably say maybe 'Sansha Sanyou'? It's one I pretty much never see mentioned that I really enjoyed
Oh uhh, I didn't have anything particular in mind lol.
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
Hold up, why am I just now finding out about a cute girls doing pottery anime? https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2021-03-15/let-make-a-mug-too-tv-anime-reveals-promo-video-more-cast-april-2-premiere/.170620
Ah I mean most of the episode aired so I counted it
Isn't it only 2 left?
I absolutely love the ED song
Well, then you can at least tie him right?
16 people are simping for Kasumi harder than you Nova, gotta pump up those numbers
I haven't seen today's episode, now I'm scared
Oh nice, hopefully somewhere near me is showing it
<:TsubasaJoy:688191716620238870>
Like god damn, the VA's performance, the animation, the music, all of them were fantastic.
On the topic of the new slime ep, can we just appreciate how damn good those last couple minutes are.
Also, the last few minutes of today's episode, *what the fuck*
After just finishing today's WEP, I kinda agree
That seems to be a pretty standard reaction
My conclusion after finishing Spec Ops Asuka is that all these girls need a hug.
I read a couple chapters the other day then realized that there was an anime so I'm going through that
So, I'm halfway through 'Magical Girl Spec-Ops Asuka' and my only conclusion so far is that Asuka is really cute. There's also angry scissors girl who's voiced by Ayahi which was nice to see.
I'l have to check those out at some point, Love Live is basically the only idol anime I've seen
I liked them more than most of the μ's songs tbh
I want some more A-Rise songs, they were bangers
There's a lot of characters, that's bound to happen
I wasn't too into all the struggles of them forming their group and whatnot, but I loved seeing what they did when they were a group
Yeah I liked S2 a lot more as well
<:KirikaPog:605209108827734017>
I can't wait to see some of the horrific abominations animated
Oh shit, I'm looking forward to that
But they probably would've said so if that was the case
Dang I was hoping for next season
I see it says 2021, but is there a specific date for it, or is it not announced yet
Space vampire girl seems really cute, I'm interested <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
Oh? Is it really ahead of the anime or something?
I hope Dr. Stone gets another season because I really wanna see more after seeing the latest episode.
Give Azusa the cake damnit, stop tormenting her Yui
<:TsubasaPeek:623246193002151938> Don't all guitars provide a rhythm though
I figured you'd get summoned eventually Nova
Ahh I'm so excited, Yama no Susume was probably one of the first cute girl anime I watched and one of my favorites
<:KirikaPog:605209108827734017>
Cute girls climbing season 4!!
Wait is that what I think it is
There's probably some near me that show stuff but I haven't really paid much attention to it. I think the only movie I've seen in a theater was the second 'my hero academia; movie. Although hopefully I'll be able to see the Violet Evergarden movie when it starts showing.
Yeah you either gotta wait a LONG time for the BD release or hope that it gets a theater release in your area. Or there's the off chance a streaming platform picks it up
That'll make it harder to watch 😦
Oh its a movie not a whole series
Is that next season?
I just watched that one, though I have no idea what it's about. Movie production?
I just made some food, I guess I should go watch Yuru Camp <:ChrisMunch:688191202973319198>
Nah they just wanted to kill Honoka
Damn, I was looking around for showings for the Violet Evergarden Movie but the closest theater to me that's showing it is like 100 miles away <:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
Probably, but I still like some nice and pure happy cgdct sometimes.
Oh no, pls don't be *sad* girls playing soccer
https://anilist.co/anime/123494/Sayonara-Watashi-no-Cramer/
Well there's only a couple episodes left, after that most people are assuming its gonna take a break to catch up to the manga
The last few episodes for Black Clover have been really nice
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
I'm looking forward to the CGDCT. there's what looks like girls playing soccer, girls riding motorcycles, and girls doing pottery.
I love me some isekai and it's got Aoi Yuki
Pretty much all the stuff I'm looking forward to next season aren't even on that list now that I think about it xD
You know, with the anime for Killing Slimes for 300 years, that's like the third slime based isekai we have right? There's tensura and 'By the Grace of the Gods'
I wasn't a huge fan of Madoka in general, but that's just my preferences. I think it was a well made anime, it just wasn't for me.
Though I feel like that's an unpopular opinion
StrikerS was my favorite tbh
At least when it comes back up, I'll probably have a ton of manga that's released to read <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
Rip mangadex for awhile https://twitter.com/MangaDex/status/1373740982483705867
Ah
What's the third one from
Sounds like a good time, I'd be down for watching some anime with Ikxi's dad
Mushoku Tensei is over for now 😦 I enjoyed looking forward to some nice isekai each week.
The fact that it just says "Dog" and is enough to have a VA attached to it is hilarious to me
I'd love some physical manga, but it's often hard to obtain or way too expensive for me.
As long as the password isn't something you've used elsewhere, does a data breach really impact anything except for maybe getting your email on some spam lists?
I can't even really go elsewhere to read the manga I'm following because my follow list is on Mangadex's website so I dont remember all of them xD
Ah
The name sounds familiar, who is that?
I keep hearing all this depressing stuff about Uma Musume this season and I'm really concerned to watch it now
Black clover has some fantastic climaxes but a lot of the content other than them can be kinda oof
If I need a guide to figure out how to watch an anime than that's just too much effort for me
Urasekai is over, but I still want more Kozakura <:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
It's probably my favorite episode from anything I've seen this season
Holy shit this week's slime isekai episode was amazing
I'm pretty curious
One of these days I'll have to watch gekidol just so I can understand why everyone is so confused.
Season 2 in particular is probably my favorite
Girls doing mountain climbing <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
It's probably good, but I can't really see myself enjoying the LN that much. I feel like it's the kinda series I'd much rather have something visual to look at as opposed to just reading it
Maybe I'll check out the manga when I get a chance
So, I just watched this week's WEP. What's even going on at this point
I didn't realize they were voiced by the same VA
That's official artwork? God damn that's cute as hell <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
New egg ep is finally out?
I've read the saint one before and enjoyed it and the second one looks like Yuri <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
I think there's only a couple of those that I plan on checking out. 'The Saint's Magic Power is Omnipotent' and 'Blue Reflection Ray'
Same, but we'll just have to wait and see I guess
Also, I just wanna say after this week's ep ||NOOO, how dare they do it to Rika too. Who's the bastard responsible for this suffering to her and best turtle boi Mannen, execute em||
Oh was it? Nice
I wouldn't say I necessarily dislike it, but it does kinda feel like they're just throwing stuff together at this point whereas before there was at least a consistently paced storyline.
Are we gonna have a new best boat anime lmao
I'll probably finish like half the stuff I'm behind on and drop the rest
I think I'm behind on like half the stuff I started this season
Ah then mine might be off lol
did I fuck up?
I just looked at anilists start day and looked at a calendar
I have a lot on saturdays but other than that its relatively balanced for me
Damn that's so few
As someone put it in the discussion thread, "Of all the shows to air this season, this sure was one of them." which pretty much sums up the experience.
Anyone happen to watch 'Soukou Musume Senki' this season? It uhh, existed.
rip kinky mahou shoujo
Suzuka got silenced
I ended up liking Rice Shower a lot more than I expected
I want those two horse girl kids as MC's, gimme a timeskip to when they're older <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
Alright, I'm fully caught up now. Yeah I think it's definitely better than S1 but I do miss my happy horse girls.
God it keeps getting worse, poor Teio
Every time I think the problem is resolved, "Nope, here's a new horse girl to add to the suffering again"
It just keeps going with the suffering
<:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
I'm catching up on Uma Musume and starting to get into the sad horse vibes
I just  saw the Dr. Stone S3 trailer, looking forward to pirate Senku
Also, cute girls building things? Fixing things? https://twitter.com/diy_anime/status/1374994712478707722 Lots of good announcements lately it seems <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
Unless I'm just missing something, I don't actually see an announcement listed in the source for it, but if true then <:KirikaPog:605209108827734017>  https://twitter.com/animetv_jp/status/1375001248529846272
Now that you're asking I feel like I'm drawing a blank as to what all there was lol
I don't think so, but maybe I just missed it
Also, it's kinda a shame that we didn't really learn anything about her in the anime, is there more of a story to her in the LN/Manga?
She looks smaller in that pic, but maybe that's just from the way she's sitting
I just want more Kozakura
Or did 12 release already
The last released volume was what? 11?
<:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
Ah makes sense
Is that young or old for VA's? I have no idea on that kinda thing
O shit it is? <:HibikiWow:738172615453048912>
It had a cute girl and that's enough to gain my interest
No idea what thats about, but I watched the video and I'm interested <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
it's good comedy
Isn't the arc basically just starting in the anime?
If its a continuation then that'll be a bit annoying because there'll probably be no place to watch it until a blu ray comes out
oof a movie, idk how I feel about that
Well, at least it's one less anime I gotta keep up with each week
I remember hearing really good things about S1 but all I've heard about S2 is bad things
Although I doubt we'll get another season, I'd love to see it.
Season 2 covered the content up to the end of volume 6 I think
From what I remember it also doesn't portray Japan very positively
I'd love to see villainess get an adaptation. Solo Leveling could also be really good, but I could see it being a bad adaptation too.
-1 The Dangers In My Heart
-2 Solo Leveling
-3 Senpai is Otokonoko
-4 A Man & His Cat
-5 I'm in Love with the Villainess
-6 Spy x Family
-7 Onimai
-8 Komi Can't Communicate
-9 Yamadakun to Lv999 no Koi wo Suru
-10 Kusuriya no Hitorigoto
Taken from the post about it on r/anime I saw earlier
Girls and tanks <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
Oh yeah I forgot that airs today doesn't it
I wonder how many anime there are at all that have 16 episodes lol
That sounds pretty interesting
"Declaring war against all of the SF series around the world!!" I think they lost that war <:Ver:704169051391524875>
If it gets a theater release I at least hope that there's one near me showing it. I wanted to watch the Violet Evergarden movie but the closest theater showing it was like 100 miles away <:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
Just gotta wait until this season's wholesome stuff starts
<:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
I just hope it'll be available somewhere and I won't have to wait months for a blu ray to watch it
So it looks like Black Clover is going the route of a movie next
Time to wait a year for more episodes
But yeah eren lookin thicc
Damn they really just gonna end on that cliffhanger
Looking at my list, I don't have a single title other than AoT that has 16
The only thing I have on my list that I could recommend that's above 100 eps (apart from Black Clover) is Hunter x Hunter
Oof an 🥚 delay
Just finished Uma Musume, Teio <:KirikaPog:605209108827734017>
Hmm, it's not bad but I think I like the first OP more. But who knows maybe I'll come to like this one more over time.
Wait, so tomorrow is the last episode for WEP? I thought I remember seeing somewhere that we were gonna get another episode because of the unexpected recap ep. https://twitter.com/WEP_anime/status/1376474212878086146
The last episode better be real good if someone went to the hospital over it
Holy shit
Man slime Isekai has been so good this season, I can't wait for part 2.
That means it'll make its way to pirate sites soon <:KirikaPog:605209108827734017>
<:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
It's only a season of waiting since part 2 is airing in the summer, but it's still a long wait
I bet they taste divine
The only thing I can think of when I hear TL notes is the whole "Keikaku means plan" thing
Honestly I was kinda hoping we would see Riko actually use her special attack and just fuckin die. At least it would've made it more interesting
Oh yeah I think I watched a few minutes, realized it was a recap ep and just skipped it lmao
Yeah, It's not like it was particularily *bad* but there wasn't anything good about it
Oh yeah
All I really wanna see at this point is some happy Rika
At this point I'm not all that interested in the last ep of egg as I was. I was really enjoying the first several episodes but the last few haven't been all that interesting to me. I am a bit curious how they're gonna end it though
So, am I supposed to understand whatever the hell that egg ep just was
Sounds like something I'd do
Lmao
MAL says 64 so yeah
Maki is truly best girl, though I'm thinking of a completely different Maki lol
4 TB jesus
The first ones that came to mind (apart for Genjuro as best dad) were Nanoha's parents
I don't know who any of these chars are, but the red haired girl is lookin real cute
Anyways, ty for the info 💜
MAL says the 3rd so maybe anilist is just wrong on this one
It does? Guess Anilist is wrong then
Anyone know anything about 'Let's Make a Mug Too'? Supposedly it aired today but I can't find it anywhere
"  Reborn to Master the Blade: From Hero-King to Extraordinary Squire by Hayaken with Illustrations by Nagu" This is a good one 👌
Whenever I hear about godzilla in here I always have to think for a sec because the only thing I'm familiar with is like the 1950s film lol
Idk where it was stated but that's what I've heard and that's what places like anilist are saying too
Wasnt there a week break
Isnt it not supposed to air at all today
Random delay?
That's a big oof
I feel like I didn't understand a single thing in that trailer but it looks kinda cool
Twintails is great
Twintail S2 when?
I remember I watched like one episode and decided it was far too high iq for me
Is that the one with the gay bears?
Flip Flap 🎵 Flip Flap 🎵
Maybe, but I have a feeling that ones gonna end up real sad
Super cub and lets make a mug are basically the only cgdct sol kinda stuff this season right? Or are there some I missed. I guess killing slimes might count too
It may just be a big ad, but I've still got high hopes
<:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
I'm glad someone else noticed that, I just wanna watch my Cute Girls doing pottery but it's nowhere to be found
Basically my reason for not watching a lot of anime xD
Elaina is very good, it probably was my favorite OP and actual anime from that season
Isn't 39 episodes still quite a lot, or were standards just different back then
Perhaps, but that's not gonna stop me from dreaming about more cute girl anime
Maybe there'll be a cute girls playing cricket anime one day <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
It's got girls doing things and Aoi Yuki so I'll probably watch it anyway
Idk how I'm feeling about that anime in general though. The animation certainly has it's own style and idk how I like it
Well I'm used to it being called soccer irl so maybe I just don't think anything is off <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
Did the subs say soccer? I didn't even notice lol
I used kissanime quite a bit tbh, it always had a lot of the obscure OVAs and Specials that I couldn't find anywhere else
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
On an unrelated note, the girls doing pottery anime is finally up and although its only like 15 minutes long it's still real cute.
Does 'everywhere' include all the sketchy pirate sites?
I should throw that on my plan to watch list later. I've seen a handful of clips and it looks hilarious.
🥚
The other two had it coming though
Poor Ruby, she's probably innocent in that
I should throw bang dream on my plan to watch list
One can only hope
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
I think I remember seeing this one, lots of cute girls <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594> For a sec I thought it was an adaptation of a cgdct manga I read where the girls were in an aquarium club lol
The start of an anime season is weird because rather than the "Oh it's Thursday, I've got X, Y, and Z anime to look forward to" that I got used to the previous season it's "Oh it's Thursday, what anime is airing today?"
So they changed the OP because someone in the band got arrested? Is that kinda reaction common in that situation?
So I watched Super Cub. I feel like I didn't expect it to be like this at all, but I'm enjoying it regardless
Chika just felt like an off brand Honoka to me
Other than Riko and You, I didn't care that much about the sunshine cast
Is that how development is? Character traits just getting passed around?
Hey <@!199928870810419200> did Kanan do anything notable? I honestly can't think of anything
At least You has something going with the whole sailor thing *Yousoro!* I don't remember a thing about Kanan
She was pretty forgettable tbh
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
Me trying to figure out what the hell the giraffe means
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
Alright so I finished Revue Starlight, I feel like I kinda understood it but also didn't fully understand it
Oh it's not the Kasumi I was thinking of lol
Wait
||I was just thinking "Oh banana girl is cool, I like her" then it's just "Wait, what, what are you doing, hold up what's going on"||
I'm like halfway through episode 8 right now
So im a bit over halfway through Revue Starlight, this isn't what I expected at all. What the heck is going on
The opening was far more of a banger than I expected it to be
Got it, I'll make sure to pay more attention to that
I'm only a couple episodes in so I wasn't sure if it was the kinda anime that went super heavy on the subtle symbolism kinda stuff.
Alright, just figured I'd check so I know what to expect lol
Listen, I have a smol brain when it comes to that kinda stuff
So, as I'm getting into this I gotta ask just out of curiosity: Is this the kinda anime that I'm probably gonna have to find some Youtube video explaining symbolism or something after I finish it?
So, I watched the first episode of Revue Starlight. I have no clue what the hell is going on, but it looks pretty gay so I'm into it regardless <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
symbolism? Oh god is this gonna be an anime that I need a big brain to understand
I finished the first ep of Blue Reflection Ray, idk where this is going but i'm down for it
Oh yeah that released today didn't it. Brb gonna go watch it
The new OP/ED are cool but I think I still like the first ones more. Maybe the new ones will grow on me though <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
Also now that I've seen it, is that XDU event with revue starlight TL'ed anywhere?
I feel like any analysis at this point is just gonna be too high iq for me. Ya gotta remember I have a smol brain
It's really cute, she just wants to live a nice and peaceful life but all this shit keeps happening. Just let her relax
Yep! I'm looking forward to it because it'll be nice to have a voice associated with the MC since I've read the manga a bit.
I just realized that the Killing Slimes for 300 years anime is airing tomorrow. So I'll get to see Aoi Yuki as a spider today and Aoi Yuki as a witch tomorrow <:HibikiWow:738172615453048912>
Also now that I'm thinking about it, the left girl reminds me of Miyafuji from Strike Witches
That's pretty lewd
I don't know what to expect from Blue Reflection Ray, I'm just hoping there's some gay in there
Well apparently its gonna go for 24 eps so hopefully that'll give me enough time to understand it lol
So far it's probably my favorite anime this season. Just some nice and peaceful cute girls
Now there's a take
What the hell is that thing <:MariaScared:672584661125431299>
<:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>  So the cute anime girls got their time cut for real girls?
I havent checked out the latest mug ep, is it still only like 15 minutes?
I see the CGDCT anime in there, good choices 👌
There's only like 3 that I'm really interested in and the rest are just kinda filler now that I think about it
Jesus that's a lot, I'm not even watching like half of that
Looking at my list, the only things I've seen pre-2005 are the DBZ Broly Movie, Initial D, Spirited Away, and Nanoha.
I've seen practically nothing on that list so I don't even know what 90% of those anime are lmao
Where are all the Yuri harems
A guy? <:KirikaDisgust:688431636043268097>
That's uhh, certainly something
Why is she wearing a collar
Harem you say? Don't those usually have men <:KirikaDisgust:688431636043268097>
Slime S2 Part 2,  Mushoku Tensei S2, Bakarina S2, Standing on 100mil lives S2 (Kinda isekai), Realist Hero, Assassin Isekai, Pharmacist Isekai, Black Company Isekai.
Yeah there's like 8 or 9 isekai lmao
A big reason why I'm looking forward to next season is that it has a lot of isekai or fantasy type stuff which I'm always a sucker for. But we've all got our own tastes
Fall only has like two I'm interested in at a glance, but yeah there's hardly anything announced yet
Just looking only at the stuff that's been announced so far, there's already more that I'm gonna watch next season than I'm watching this season
There's the kinmoza movie, but that's a movie so who knows its availability
Oh there's also two other isekai I didn't notice airing in the summer. So I've got those to look forward to as well
<:KirikaPog:605209108827734017>
Wait the aquarium girls one is airing in summer?
*onii sama*
I'm not really too interested in Mahouka, but since this one is focusing on a cute girl i'm more interested.
Slime S2 Part 2, Dragon Maid S, Mushoku Tensei S2, Bakarina S2, Standing on 100mil lives S2, Realist Hero, Mahouka, Love Live, Banished from the hero's party. For me
Next season seems to have a ton of stuff I'm more interested in than this season.
Not that that's ever gonna happen
Yeah I read the manga then learned there was the OVA. There's a lot of stuff cut. But hey they could always also adapt the follow-up when they're in college
I love me some wholesome stuff
The Kase-san OVA was nice
I think I remember reading like 1 chapter of that
Oh? Maybe I'll check it out when I get home
Ahh I like seeing all these cute girls in here <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
Ooh that one
Having read the manga, calling it that would be kinda accurate I suppose lol
I've got high hopes for it <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
On the bright side Super Cub (Though it may just be a big advertisement) is much better than I expected so I hope it keeps up with my expectations.
It only being like 15 minutes doesn't help it much either
As much as I wanna like it, I don't think I'm a huge fan of the cute girls doing pottery anime this season.
What an obscure detail to notice
They even put in those details properly? That's impressive
I do like how we're slowly getting to see the MC change a little at a time
I did! We got to meet a new character and she looks like a lot of fun
The OP for Super Cub is much more of a banger than I expected <:ChrisDJ:690470897194369034>
Yeah the quality isn't necessarily the best, but <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
<:KirikaPog:605209108827734017>  I'll have to check it out when I get home tonight
Railgun T, good stuff
What if I just wanna see some cute girls?
Hmm, I'm not familiar with Macross at all. Do I need to have watched other entries to understand what's going on?
What anime is this from?
She looks cute
Lmao
Why is the old man with a fishing pole being attacked by the horse
Reminds me of Ex-Arm "Declaring war on the whole Sci-Fi Genre"
Those are some bold words
Kaos emote <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2021-04-16/the-great-jahy-will-not-be-defeated-comedy-manga-gets-tv-anime-this-summer/.171781 I remember reading a few chapters of the manga, it looked like fun
Skeleton Soldier Couldn't Protect the Dungeon?
<:KirikaPog:605209108827734017>
Another isekai anime?
Yeah now that you mention it, if I had to pick one it'd probably be how not to summon a demon lord. It's much more of a banger than I expected lol

None of the OPs for stuff I've watched have really stood out to me.
I really like Sei's VA in that one
I like all the isekai
<:TsubasaPeek:623246193002151938>
With Iruma-kun airing today, I've now started everything I was planning on watching this season.
Eyes are one of the first things I look at when I see a character, especially in fanart
Also, that's an interesting pic they chose to post with it lol
Oof
Oh yeah that airs today  <:KirikaPog:605209108827734017>
That's the kinky mahou shoujo right?
Indeed it is <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
I feel like I haven't really found much interesting stuff lately, but maybe that's just because if I do find something new it'll only have  like 1 or 2 chapters. So I'll have to wait a week or more for another chapter which makes it hard to feel too excited about it
For reading it? I think I used mangakakalot

Twintails is culture
Good recommendation though nova, ty <:ChrisHappy:660870796696223744>
And it was last updated like a year ago too so rip my hopes
<:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
Ahh I ran out of chapters already, I want more
I'm a few chapters in and she seems precious
OwO? Name?
Interesting, I guess I learned a new term today.
So like, yuru camp?
iyashikei?
Significantly less sane? <:MariaScared:672584661125431299>
Hmm, boys are kinda oof but if they're dressed like girls than maybe It's worth considering
I'm enjoying 'The Saint's Magic Power is Omnipotent' far more than I expected to be. I didn't have high hopes when the adaptation was announced, but the visuals have been really pretty and Sei's VA is doing a fantastic job.
It's definitely up there on the list of things I never would have imagined would get another season, the real question is where's the second season for some CGDCT anime <:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/daily-briefs/2021-04-22/restaurant-to-another-world-tv-anime-season-2-listed/.172003 I remember watching this awhile ago, I never woulda expected another season <:KirikaPog:605209108827734017>
I really wanna click those spoilers, but I know I shouldn't <:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
This week's spider isekai was a wild ride
Lmao true
Understandable
I think my favorite from that list has probably gotta be 'Even if It Was Just Once, I Regret It'. Even though it starts off kinda rough it develops really nicely
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
That's a lotta yuri, and there's a handful of em I haven't read
Those are nice too <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
Beelzebub is cute af <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
I just found it on 9anime <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
Nah not a camrip
Oh hey it's available on pirate sites already <:KirikaPog:605209108827734017>  Ty for reminding me I gotta check that out
Now our resident Kasumin simp  <@!199928870810419200> may have some company
So we've got a Setsuna fan in here now?
I think I remember starting that one a long time ago
I wonder if this movie will be too high iq for me like rebellion was <:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
Like the anime made sense more or less, but Rebellion was where I got a bit lost.
I'm just out here reading this Madoka stuff like <:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>  My brain is too smol for this
I had no idea people cared about minor stuff like that kinda word choice in translation, but I guess there are always gonna be those people
Is the gacha popular? Is that why it gets more anime?
Looks like there's 2 seasons and also a spinoff, but I could've sworn there was more
I don't understand Show by Rock, apparently its popular enough to have like 4 seasons but it's probably one of my least favorite anime that I've seen. I guess I'm just not the target audience <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
I'll have to check it out later when I'm done with my assignments 👌
Why can't things be simple
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
Hub, interesting lol
1.5?
That's one of those things that's been on my list for a long time but I've just never gotten around to it. How many seasons are there again?
Ah, that one
Err, which one is that
That's certainly something
lmao
I love it
Honestly that's probably my favorite song from any of the Love Live anime
Yeah that
Now that I mentioned the movie, now all I can think about is that song about running away from the movie whatever it was called lol.
I was kinda surprised when I watched it and noticed that
The love live Movie is basically a musical xD
I only know the anime stuff and a small handful of non-anime ones but yeah there are plenty of bangers in there.
Uh huh, sure....
Sounds spooky
Wait whats that Ikxi?
I would've considered going to a cinema to see it, but since it was up on a pirate site I didn't bother lol
I just watched the Demon Slayer movie, damn that ending
I feel like I've seen a handful of CGDCT stuff announced, but hardly any of it has a date attached 😦
<:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
Seeing a new anime but realizing it's not about cute girls doing things
It could also be something about the manga ending too because that's happening. But I can still dream
Hold up, hold the fuck up https://twitter.com/nganime/status/1387179755494014976 Potential New Game third season?
<:ChrisPray:672578403156885504>
YnS <:KirikaPog:605209108827734017>
I've heard good things about that one, I should check it out
Yeah that one has been a little disappointing to me tbh, which is sad as someone who loves cute girls doing things.
"magical girls that aren't very good but I'm curious to see what happens" Pretty much my thoughts too lol
The OP is great
Not particularily related to the discussion, but on the topic of Bofuri, here's an amusing pic of stats from the LN
ye
It was Firefly
I remember telling a friend I'd watch a show they recommended to me, it's been like 3 years and I still haven't seen it xD
That's an interesting way to spell "Quality anime"
I'm not a huge fan of the artstyle and I've got no clue where the story is supposed to be going for blue reflection. But it's got girls in there and it looks kinda gay so I'm still watching
I like the fact that instead of a rubber duck its a dragon
Aoi  Yuki killing slimes is probably my favorite anime this season
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
Beelzebub is a cutie
https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2021-04-30/fullmetal-alchemist-brotherhood-yasuhiro-irie-studio-3hz-make-musical-healing-tv-anime-healer-girl/.172315 Is this idols?
Also, I'm just now looking back at it and reading it properly but ||God damn Ariel has a lot of titles, they've slaughtered enough Humans, Demons, Fairies, Monsters, Wyrms, and Dragons to have like 3 titles each just for killing them. And I've said she was really cute before, but I love her hair. It kinda reminds me of Teio from Uma Musume||
Just give me 23 minutes of spider pls
Because all the humans are boring
Probably my favorite character after aoi yuki spider lol
Also ||Now that Fei has a human form, she's still annoying, but at least she's cute so that kinda balances things out. Hearing from D again was nice as well as finally getting introduced to Ariel properly. ||
So I watched new spider isekai ep, man that 3d animation at the end lmao
<:ChrisPray:672578403156885504>
Pls
Not gay enough <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
I had to think for a sec "Wait what fucked up thing happened in ep 10" because there's so much messed up stuff throughout the series lol
Also, I just noticed, but nice profile pic <@!152896851660505088>  👌
I know whatever S2 contains is probably gonna be more fucked up and I'm so excited lol
I remember I watched a camrip version right after I finished binging the anime which was definitely a mistake because man it's so much better in the proper quality.
The movie was amazing and just left me wanting more
I'm looking forward to it
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
Oh shit S2 announced?
I like how the dancers in the back have the Tokiwadai uniforms
Though someone feel free to correct me if that's wrong
If I understand the question right ||I believe that the students were all reincarnated as babies, so what spider is doing right now is happening while the others are still babies.||
<:YumiPoint:688429724103344164>  This pls, I've heard a lot of people didn't like Spyce that much, but I thought it was great.
I'm looking forward to seeing more gay spies
<:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
Does that mean I may actually be able to watch it?
<:KirikaPog:605209108827734017>
This week's isekai maou ep was <:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
<:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
I want more of best girl who isn't even an idol
<:YumiPoint:688429724103344164>
So is orange haired girl this season's version of Honoka?
I mean Setsuna is pretty great so I could see $1700 USD being realistic too <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
Ah that makes more sense lol
Why is a Setsuna figure $1700
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
Middle girl looks a bit different but you could tell me the outer two are the same and I'd believe it
To be fair even though they might've made it clear I remember it did take me until like episode 8 or 9 to finally understand it lol
Ooh the post ED scene was cool though, I almost missed it
This week's spider isekai barely had any spider. I don't care about the humans, I just wanna see more spider <:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
Ah.
Is this like the series vs the movie or something?
I may not watch it this season, but I'll throw it on the list to get around to at some point
Huh, sounds pretty interesting
Like the show
Yeah
What's this about?
OwO?
Out of all the Love Live seasons I think I like the most characters in Niji. There's so many good ones
I honestly didn't expect another Love Live related announcement with Superstar coming up in the summer
<:KirikaPog:605209108827734017>
Wait Niji S2? Really?
Oh hey a DB Super movie, I wasn't expecting that tbh
Ah, you got to *that* episode
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>  Majo no Tabitabi was my favorite anime from that season
That's a great use of cgi
You know I just realized, if we're getting a Niji S2 then if Love Live keeps the same format they've been doing does that mean there'll be a movie too?
The animation during the songs are really nice looking
Same, if they cover the chapters I think they're gonna cover then I'm super excited
Machikado Mazoku <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
The only thing I know about this one is that I've heard pretty much nothing happens in the manga lol
Lelouch seems kinda insane and I love him so far.
Damn the first episode was wild, I'm down for whatever the hell kinda journey this is about to be. The ED is cool too <:ChrisDJ:690470897194369034>
ayy this OP is a banger <:ChrisDJ:690470897194369034>
So, if I wanna watch Code Geass, do I start with 'Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion'? because I'm looking at the MAL listings and there's a lot of related stuff it seems so I don't wanna fuck up the order. <:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
Why is giant robot man fighting the green crab monster
ngl i had to google garter belt just now in order to make sure I knew what they were
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
It's fine though, I ordered a new phone
Don't worry Nova, sifas doesn't want to work on my phone so I can't get anything from there
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
I really wanna watch R2 now but I know I shouldn't start another season this late because I'm gonna want to watch it all
What a god damn rollercoaster
Alright yo what the fuck how the hell are they just gonna end a season like that
Oh god this is escalating quickly
"Right now I'm trying to run the school festival and a coup d'état" Lmao what a line from Lelouch
Smart move because it is kinda hilarious lol
Did Pizza Hut pay a bunch to be in Code Geass or something because man it feels like they're quite prevalent lol.
I don't see why not
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
Hold up, is that girl really doing what I think she is to that table
Lmao these subs giving me a link to wikipedia
Holy shit the cat with the mask, this is peak comedy lol
I'm liking C.C. so far
So from what I'm looking at, is the 'Code Geass: Lelouch of the Re;surrection' movie the next thing to watch?
I just finished with code geass R2, that's quite the ending
Also I just wanna say how absolutely adorable C.C. is with her plushie
Man it's crazy how code geass just keeps pulling out more wild shit as the episodes go on but man am I loving it.
So far I'm enjoying it, but I'm only a few episodes in so there's a lot to go.
Hmm, overall it was way better than I was expecting. Despite being 25 episodes long I was never really bored and was always looking forward to what was coming next. Lelouch seems kinda insane and I love him for it because I know he's probably gonna do something wild. Pizza girl C.C. is cute af. I do like the whole feel that Britannia is this kind of insurmountable obstacle that Lelouch and the others are fighting against with the whole combo of Justice and nationalism. Then there's all the Geass stuff that's a big mystery, Whatever Suzaku is doing, as well as what the King is really up to. There's a lot going on
Alright, time to binge all of Code Geass R2
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
Huh, interesting. I wouldn't have even considered it to be in that category lol
Is KLK ecchi?
I'm a few behind in blue reflection. I gotta catch up
I'll just watch a video on the changes and watch it, I don't wanna watch 3 movies of stuff I've mostly seen just to understand one movie a little better.
OwO, is this gonna be girls on airplanes?
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
Oh god there's poetry? Sounds too high iq for me
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
If only that got an anime <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
I would've paid to watch it, but there wasn't as theater nearby showing it so I pirated it
Lmao
Watch Demon Slayer then <:KirikaPog:605209108827734017>
Damn all of those are good ones
How does she know about the sequel if she never played it <:HibikiThink:688429715362414641>
I was kinda surprised that there was gonna be a S2, I wonder how that's even gonna work
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
Huh, interesting
So it is profitable, but studios aren't the ones making the profit?
Is anime a really low profit margin industry?
<:ChrisPray:672578403156885504>
~~I wanna get crushed by those muscles ~~
I've heard really good things about Vivy
There's this seasons https://myanimelist.net/anime/40586/Slime_Taoshite_300-nen_Shiranai_Uchi_ni_Level_Max_ni_Nattemashita although it only has 6 eps out so far. That fits both Fantasy and female protag
<:MariaScared:672584661125431299>
Same VA
The only thing I know about LWA is that I always see a bunch of yuri fanart of it <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
<:HibikiMunch:672606446239744000>
Cute girl anime <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
Huh, maybe I'll check out a couple episodes. (I say as I'm like 20 episodes behind on this seasons stuff)
What's that anime about? I feel like I've heard about it here and there but don't actually know anything about it.
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2021-05-21/slow-loop-anime-reveals-main-staff-visual-january-2022-debut/.173047 Apparently this  anime was announced months ago but I either didn't notice or forgot. More cute girls fishing it looks like
<:ChrisEnraged:423196924368388105>
Listen man, since I've already seen the ep myself that strat may be less effective. But I won't deny there's a chance it could still work
Ooh and the post credits scene <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
This week's spider isekai was great, some real interesting stuff going on in the spider side of things.
Not that there's any problem with that <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
I feel like a lot of things start out as LN's these days because it's a lot easier to produce a LN than a manga. But sometimes LN's will progress into a manga
I mean the purpose of anime is to make money isn't it? So it makes sense unfortunately
XDU crossover when
~~I mean, I wouldn't mind being a cute anime girl with twintails~~
I don't think they've done much else afaik
Oh man I missed a whole twintails convo, it's good stuff 👌
I didn't see the title but I did see the after credits. What was it?
This week's spider isekai was good stuff 👌
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
https://myanimelist.net/anime/33478/UQ_Holder__Mahou_Sensei_Negima_2 is the only thing I've seen. Though it looks like unbeknownst to me there was stuff before that lol
MAL says fall 2017, man I could've sworn it was way before that
I think I remember watching the UQ Holder anime a long time ago
Can't wait for some gay spies
I noticed that a bit ago, I'll probably watch it later today after I get some sleep
Yeah, but consider this, had I not seen you talking about Love Live all the time I may not have seen it and ended up here
I blame you Nova
Great, having watched Code Geass just recently now I'm gonna be thinking about that too <:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
I like the style of the characters eyes <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
I blame you for that Nova
Oh god her name is Kasumi? Now I'm gonna be thinking of Love Live the whole time
MAL always shows stuff like this and it's just <:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
Nova, answer the question pls <:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
If you say so <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
Hey <@!199928870810419200>  I remember you  explained this to me awhile ago, but I forgot what you said  <:Ver:704169051391524875>  So is the one I wanna start with in the franchise this? https://myanimelist.net/anime/33573/BanG_Dream Or is there some different I should go for
I forgot this was coming up next season
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
😠
Nova, you're tempting me here
I feel like Kasumi is just dragging everyone around, those poor victims
I like vaguely remember some of this stuff because of the XDU event lmao. I should check out that afterwards so I can have the proper context.
~~True for Love Live too~~
Idk how I feel about Kasumi yet, but I'm liking Arisa so far. She cute af <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
Also holy shit Arisa is so cute I love her already <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
Idk what the hell this is, but it's amazing
My hero academia  finally got to the part I've been looking forward to  for the whole season<:KirikaPog:605209108827734017>
Macross Delta I think but I'm not positive on that
<:ChrisPray:672578403156885504>
Sakura trick is great, it's just like 11 episodes of wholesome girls kissing each other
<:MikuDelete:661660028410920990>
Too lewd for a sfw channel
Citrus <:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
Bofuri <:KirikaPog:605209108827734017>
Hearing that makes me a little worried about it's content but I'll save any judgement for after I actually read it. I just don't wanna see a bunch of poorly thought out future content for something that felt finished.
There's a book 4? Damn
I feel like it pretty much finished with book 2, but I'm not gonna be against more yuri
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
<:ChrisPray:672578403156885504>
GX Blu Ray?
<:HibikiFingerguns:688429715836502063>
Who needs faces in sifas when you can just get a rina-chan board instead
<:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
Man what a good movie, Violet Evergarden always makes me cry
I dunno, I just pirate all my anime <:HibikiFingerguns:688429715836502063>
I'm watching the Violet Evergarden movie and I'm already crying less than 10 minutes in. <:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
I loved Saki even though I have no clue how mahjong works
Err, what does this mean? I can't read moonrunes
The lack of aoi yuki spider yesterday was tragic
True
Oh right that is today, I gotta watch that
<:HibikiThink:688429715362414641>
Yeah it makes sense to be low when I think about it. Adaptations already have some following whereas original series are a gamble on if they'll be successful.
Now I'm wondering what % of anime are original as opposed to based on LNs, Manga, etc.
Wait it's actually pretty crazy that gear is that high
Human side is just so boring compared to spider side
There was no spider in this week's spider isekai. I'm offended, I don't care about the boring humans.
A big reason for that is that I took a pause as final exams were approaching and kinda never picked it back up
If I tallied it all up I'm like 50ish episodes behind this season lol
I gotta catch up on that, I feel like I watched up to like episode 3/4 for a lot of anime this season then just stopped watching most of it except for a few.
I really like Sei's VA in that
I never would've expected this to have another season, but I'm not complaining since I love me some isekai <:KirikaPog:605209108827734017> https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2021-06-04/by-the-grace-of-the-gods-anime-gets-2nd-season/.173565
<:ChrisDJ:690470897194369034>
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
Now I gotta figure out how I'm gonna add all the manga I've been reading on other sites while mangadex was down to mangadex
What the hell is this new layout tho
<:KirikaPog:605209108827734017>
I've barely been watching anything this season tbh, I started like 15 anime and have only kept up with like 3 lmao
I've heard good things about Vivy
Yeah it's a bit of a mess when you put it like that lol
Yeah I'm not a huge fan of it, I feel like it was trying to build up to some kinda message then just went off the rails
I feel like after about episode 7 I started to not enjoy it as much because I wasn't a huge fan of the direction it started going in.
Hopefully it can get a decent ending despite how much of a mess production was
Oh wow that's unexpected
<:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
No Q&A so we can't even ask about symphogear either
rip
<:ChrisPray:672578403156885504>
Nothing announced yet
The whole twitch chat is all excited everything they announce something and I'm just like <:HibikiWhat:336656482907193344>
Watching this discotek stream is weird because I know literally none of these boomer titles they're announcing

It was nice to have those to look forward to every week
You should, S2 is amazing
I was fully caught up, then got interrupted by finals week then I just kinda never caught back up
Yet another anime I'm behind on xD
Looks interesting and it has a bunch of cute girls, on the list it goes!
This? https://anilist.co/anime/133412/Healer-Girl/
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
Oh god that's cursed
Obama meme?
What a good episode this time, lots of spider
Lmao what a solid opener
<:TsubasaNeutral:688429723205894149>
Guess today's a Friday, I should go watch spider
Girls last tour is a really good one though
I've heard the Houseki no Kuni manga is just full of pure suffering
I'm still confused why Ariel is in 3d all the time <:Ver:704169051391524875>
<:ChrisPray:672578403156885504>
That opener was glorious is what it was
Ooh they cute
Damn it's Saturday again? I swear this week just flew by
<:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
I just want some more Yuri anime
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
Still looks super cute though
I feel like I want this one to be gay but it isn't gonna be
Yeah after ep 7 it started going downhill a bit for me
Wasn't it based on a game in the first place? Or do you mean a new game
the OST for wonder egg is great
One of them (8 iirc) is a recap though
I only recognize a few of those lol
That does seem quite lewd
<:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
There's a lot of summer anime I'm looking forward to, especially since there's so many isekai <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
The demon slayer movie was pretty good
That's a fuckin powerpoint slideshow
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
Wait is that like an actual scene and not a joke
I think I remember reading a few chapters of that
This is Maplestory? ~~But where are the orange mushrooms~~
Ah, I recognize a few of these
I moreso meant if there were movies that have started airing
movies?
When does summer anime start? Isn't it like 2-3 weeks from now?
Despite being a Shun episode, I'm okay with this weeks spider isekai because I got to watch him get his ass beat for 20 minutes. It was really pleasing to see
Looking at the list of crunchyroll originals, some seem to be absolute trash like Gibiate or EX-ARM but some are good like Tonikaku or Kumo desu ga
Damn it looks gay but not the kinda gay I'm interested in
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
This week's aoi yuki slime isekai was cute as fuck
<:KirikaPog:605209108827734017>
The only human side I've enjoyed was the latest ep where I got to see Shun getting fucking beaten for 20 minutes.
Instead I get several Shun episodes <:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
I just wanna see more spider
Maybe we'll get another season
We're getting so much Aoi Yuki isekai lol
<:MakiFlushed:731393148613427241>
<:HonkSuffering:715458413147979826>
So many good girls
I've said it before but Niji has the most amount of girls I really liked out of any of the seasons.
<:YuuShocked:762379673572474960>
Niji is the best one
~~I'm just out here playing the waiting game for Niji S2 <:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970> ~~
Yeah that's a big oof
Ahhhh
Wait what scene is this?
lmao
The only reason Nico gets any favorability points from me is because NicoMaki is a thing. I don't like Nico much by herself <:Ver:704169051391524875>
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
👀
~~Shoot me with that love arrow pls~~
<:UmiShocked:715459248762650635>

Fun fact, Eli is voiced by the same VA who does Shirabe
That's a nice pfp you got there <:MakiBlep:774326100552712202>
<:NicoNicoNii:715458641720901663>
I forget the timeline of SIP stuff are they past ||Honks fucking dying in the rain|| yet?
I don't even remember too much of sunshine lol
show's over, honks is dead

I liked S2 a lot more than S1
<:HonkSIF:715459152461430826>
I remember I started Love Live because it was all I ever saw Nova talk about in here lmao
Nova's managed to hook another one I see <:Ver:704169051391524875>
<:ChrisDJ:690470897194369034>
I feel like I don't remember too many songs from SIP, except for ? ←HEARTBEAT. Which is undoubtedly my favorite song lol
Yeah no μ's is great and all but A-RISE puts out some absolute bangers
<:ChrisDJ:690470897194369034>
I love A-RISE, it's a shame we don't see them more
The only thing I know about Precure is that there's a ton of them from all the times I've seen it in AMQ <:Ver:704169051391524875>
I have the exact same thoughts for Maki and Honoka, they're my two favorites from SIP
🍠
No one tell this innocent child
Maki is super precious
Sadly I can't be a school idol since I've graduated. And normal idols just aren't as cool
I didn't find a red umbrella or a pirate maki, but I did find a few other umbrellas and a captain Maki
I loved the Nico episode despite not liking Nico that much
<:NicoNicoNii:715458641720901663>
Ah you're at the nico episode
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
Too bad, you get Nozomi *hugging* you from behind instead
It is quite the good genre
Adult Video
So....
Iirc I remember it being mentioned in here that Honokas(?) VA used to be an AV actress
Who knows maybe they enjoyed it
<:PanaSob:749356046941814875>
<:PanaOnigiri:715458692430168105>

Poor honks
Is this the honoka eating too much bread part?

~~Clearly that means I should binge watch it all so I can watch the last ep when it airs~~
Hmm, It's not the kinda show I normally go for but maybe I'll check it out at some point
Is the 2001 series different?
I knew it was popular but man I didn't know it was that popular
I think I remember watching a handful of Fruits Basket episodes a long time ago
Beat up the heathen Nova!
I should finish actually watching the first season
That's something I never would have expected lol
Wait this is getting a second season?
I'm super looking forward to slime since S2 has been amazing so far. But apart from that maybe this one because I know it'll just be nice and chill
I can't wait
There's so much isekai coming soon
Doesn't it take like 40 minutes or something to actually get to the boats <:Ver:704169051391524875>
I'm just sad that despite loving the anime the movie wasn't that great <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
The Haifuri movie was rough
Man I can't wait for Machikado S2
Yes 🍔
<:HibikiGay:670494484701773845>
Those last few pages of that trailer
Fuck now I wanna reread it
I can't wait for all the gay
IM HYPED
I SAW
Second girlfriend looks cute af
Is this just a harem anime
<:MariaScared:672584661125431299>
The 3d in spider isekai is hilarious
Lmao what the hell is that convo
OwO, lolis making out you say?
Oh nice it's got a date attached now. I'm super looking forward to it, it's gonna cover some really cool stuff.
"Nudity / Count: 52" 👀
I prefer Anilists UI, but I like searching for things on MAL
I still use both MAL and anilist
Also, I see Yama no Susume there <:ChrisPray:672578403156885504>
Damn now that's an impressive number
The only tags that have more are "Female Protagonist" and "Primarily Female Cast" <:Ver:704169051391524875>

Cheerful Amnesia is a nice one
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
The only good human episode was the recent one where Shun was getting a beating. It was nice to watch
The human side in spider isekai is just so boring to me compared to spider side
I mean considering some of that awful 3d that's been goin on...
Anime seasons ending is always a rough time because I have to learn new days of the week when the next season starts
<:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
<@237964037898502144> Since spider isekai last episode is apparently postponed, how am I supposed to know when it's Friday <:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
I'm just out here not knowing a thing about zombieland saga other than what I see in here <:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
Now I wanna go reread it
Who wouldn't be excited to hear that
Maybe I'll catch up to that so I can try that and get rid of some of this alcohol in my fridge
It is a bunch of like 4 minute shorts so maybe that drops its rating
I don't remember anything bad about it tbh
https://anilist.co/anime/21315/Pan-de-Peace/
You should go watch the anime about bread then
Yeah there's gonna be a live action Made in Abyss <:MariaScared:672584661125431299>
Until I saw the pencils to the left I thought it was a huge box for a sec lol

Oh right that's ending today
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
I want CGI that's on par with the Cats movie for Nanachi
On the bright side we can look forward to how much of a trainwreck it's probably going to be
I'm just imagining how awful Nanachi would look
I can't wait to see || Blood coming out of Riko's entire body|| irl <:KirikaPog:605209108827734017>
But like, what is it about
What is the game about? I'm not familiar with it
Spyce was a good time
<:DiaBUUBUU:749327484364783688>
All I've heard about the manga is that it's just full of pure suffering
||Rip Antarcticite||
~~I've seen lewds of them either way~~
Yeah I know the game is popular
I thought it was just absolute garbage but apparently a ton of people liked it
Yeah that's an anime I didn't understand at all
Is that what I think it is
I think the only stuff I kept up with this season was spider isekai, witch isekai, my hero academia, and isekai maou
I also barely watched anything this season though so it's not really its fault
I think I watched like 4 episodes or so and wasn't too into it
Truthful title
Oh right I forgot he even did that lmao
Yeah the clown of a MC and the incoherent mess of a plot (was there even a plot?) made me not interested at all despite the cute catgirl.
Maybe it's just not for me, I don't get it
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
I guess the game probably carried the anime quite a bit
What kinda conversation did I just walk into
<:TsubasaNeutral:688429723205894149>
I have absolutely no idea what the hell I'm supposed to learn from that <:Ver:704169051391524875> There was a lot going on there lmao
I saw something about isekai and got my hopes up thinking there was another isekai anime coming out only to have them crushed.
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
Now gimme a S3
Yeah, It's not the kind of thing I'd normally watch but since I've heard good things about it and the fact that it managed to get rated that high I'll probably check it out
I enjoyed it until like ep 7 then it started dropping off quick for me
I mean I can't say I wouldn't have expected that considering the production disaster
Lmao
Pure chaos I assume
Good question xD <:Ver:704169051391524875> . I don't read much tbh, what I usually read is mostly fantasy type stuff tho I think.
Something good obviously <:Ver:704169051391524875>
Anyone got an LN recommendation I can kill time with on my flight?
Ai was cool but I mostly cared about just Rika lol
Yeah ep 7 was the last one I really enjoyed
I haven't seen it yet, is it that bad?
I'm a pirate 🏴‍☠️
Ah lol
Is there somewhere I can read Girls Kingdom? I looked around a little but couldn't find anywhere.
Isn't that one getting an anime
I'm hoping for Yuri but not expecting it
I see a lot of girls, what's this about? <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
Who's that again lol
Watching Shun get his ass kicked does sound like a good time
<@237964037898502144> Is there a lot of spider in the last ep, or is it mostly human side like it has been?
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
I haven't seen anything this season because I don't have any internet at my new apartment yet lol
Lol
Is the episode out? How was it?
It's okay but not really my kinda thing <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095> To each their own I suppose
I can't say I'm a big fan of that one
<:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
all this new stuff starting and I can't watch any of it
dang shes hot
Plus it's a finished one as well which feels rare these days
Ooh that's a good one
I'd love a second season but know that's never gonna happen. <:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
<:ChrisDJ:690470897194369034>
Plus its OP is absolute fire
I really liked that one
Like if I take it as an ending to encourage people to buy the LN then sure it was good. But if I consider it as an ending to actually tie up the plot, then it's a failure.
I feel like they just introduced a bunch of new wild stuff and nothing got resolved
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
So I watched the last episode of spider isekai
I still gotta figure out what the proper way to go about getting internet even is. Idk if I gotta talk to the people who rent the apartment first and ask them about it or if I just hit up whoever the local provider is.
All this anime I can't watch <:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
lol
also, how tall is this girl, like ???
dunno how i feel about that animation style but it looks interesting
Black haired girl kinda gives me Umi vibes
Speaking of the new Love Live, did that new PV ever get translated
I mean.....
I mean they're all school idols aren't they, so they're pretty much all the same anyway <:Ver:704169051391524875>
Hey <@199928870810419200> Gimme the Superstars details xD
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
She's the prez? Oh no, that means she's gonna be against school idols for whatever reason and then come around to the idea
My initial picks are the orange haired one and the black haired one tho.
Yeah it's hard to judge without actually seeing anything.
I don't understand a word of what's going on but I already don't like her.
I can't remember the last time I watched anime on a proper streaming site and didn't pirate it lol
She looks like she's this seasons Nico
Which one is that again?
Time to see if I like any of the new girls. This seasons Honoka looks interesting, maybe the black haired girl too.
Ahhh the cover art is so adorable

Idk, I was on a flight recently and they didn't seem like people to me.
New slime ep was nice, Veldora is cringe tho xD
<:KirikaPog:605209108827734017>
Anyone know when Slime isekai S2 Part 2 airs? (Has it aired already?)
I feel like it's got pretty good odds
~~Wheres the anime adaptation tho~~
<:KirikaPog:605209108827734017>
So much good anime I can't watch <:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
How is it? Is it cute?
Do they have a proper UI now
Ahhh this is adorable
<a:YuCheer:754740038994231346>
Oh is that airing today
Is that gonna impact S2 of the anime at all?
That's what? Like almost 6 feet tall?
I can only hope, I'd love to see an adaptation
Maki <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
"catch it two days later" but I wanna watch it now <:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
<a:YuCheer:754740038994231346>
Then again I haven't actually seen it, just some clips here and there
I would've guessed it was a lot older than that tbh
Kaos is just so precious

<:KirikaPog:605209108827734017>
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
All I can really use right now is wifi on my phone lol
<:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
nah, the earliest i could schedule the internet people to install stuff is like next weekend (assuming that i don't get put on the schedule for work that day and have to reschedule)
there's like 10 isekai this season, there's some good anime right there <:Ver:704169051391524875>
<a:ChrisRage:745358256242688102>
where are the subs tho
<:HonkSuffering:715458413147979826>
I can't wait to judge the new girls this season <:Ver:704169051391524875>
<:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
Where is it, I wanna read it <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
Sounds like something I'd read tbh
<a:YuCheer:754740038994231346>
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
I usually watch all the isekai
Usually I finish all the stuff I start watching, but last season I just wasn't feeling it and started like 20 but only finished like 3 lol
Aquatrope seemed to be full of cute girls from the trailer, is it not?
Based on the little I know about that one, <:MariaScared:672584661125431299>
Btw Lank, any good cute girl anime this season so far?
Lmao what a problem to have
I think the busses here do have wifi and my stop is about an anime episode away tbh
Lmao
I can't easily watch ~20 anime a season like I used to because of my job  <:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970> Adulting sucks
She's definitely at the top of my "Least favorite" list rn <:Ver:704169051391524875>
White haired girl (I forgot her name) seems like a nice support character. And she's adorable. But I don't really like the others so far.
I absolutely love Kanon
So I watched the first ep of the new Love Live
Where's GX Discotek <:ChrisEnraged:423196924368388105>
You're gonna summon Nova with that heresy talk <:MariaScared:672584661125431299>
If there are girls I can imagine it's Yuri all I want
I watched like 1 ep of that and dropped it, it just wasn't my kinda thing
<:ChrisPray:672578403156885504>
24 eps is a pretty big amount of time for some gay
Isn't aquatrope gonna be 24 eps
I remember looking forward to seeing the guy in the weekly discussion threads on r/anime who kept track of all of em.
I wonder what the "Onii-sama" count is gonna be by the end of the anime
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
That ought to be cheap
Just grab something like Gibiate
It's only been like one episode but I already love her
I'd spam some Superstar emotes but I don't have any. Hey <@199928870810419200> know a Love Live server with some? <a:YuCheer:754740038994231346>
We'll see I guess
<:EmmaShrug:660930299949088838>
I mean, I also only care about 2 of them so far. So if it's pretty even then that means the majority of the time I won't care about who's on screen xD
I wonder how much focus each character will have now that there's only 5
Are they? I don't really pay attn to that kind of thing
<:KanonYo:843630060283494410>
<:KanonShook:858787780934369300>
Yeah, isn't it getting delayed for like 3 weeks it something
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
I hear a lot of hate for it but I loved it
Silent party was one of my favorite arcs tbh lmao
Just do anime original Railgun, ez
<:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
Who needs Index anyway, just gimme more Railgun <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
Cute Girls <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
I thought that too and was confused for a sec lol
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
Hopefully I'll have internet on Saturday so I can watch it
Adachi <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
A dinosaur empire sounds badass
<:MariaScared:672584661125431299>
What the heck is that
I really can't wait to watch this
<:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
I'll have to throw it on the list, I've heard of it but havent seen it
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
Yuri you say?
Oh did Kageki Shoujo do something fucked up? Now I wanna watch it
at least flip flappers made sense to me somewhat, I still don't understand what the hell happened at the end of WEP
I finally got around to watching the Wonder Egg last ep, what even was that mess
Come suffer with the rest of us and watch it weekly you coward
Just devote the first half to the aquarium stuff and the second half to yuri <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
It's 24 episodes isn't it, so anything is possible tbh. Who knows where it could go
<:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
In the off chance they're not baiting though, ahhhh there's so much potential here <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
like, cmon how are they gonna show this and have it not be gay
I really do hope so
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
Yeah it's interesting how that worked out lol
I was gonna say it kinda gave off some Adachi and Shimamura vibes only to realize that Kukuru's VA also did Shimamura lol
<:HibikiGay:670494484701773845>
I'm, absolutely loving aquatope so far, the two main girls are so cute
Oof, I didn't even notice lol
I watched the first ep of Aquatrope, ahhh they're so adorable I love them already
I mean it could be a movie
I've only seen like 3 anime this season so far so I can't really form an opinion about what's good yet
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
<:HibikiGay:670494484701773845>
Aquatope is nice
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
I watch all the isekai
I think I'm probably gonna wait, but in the event it gets released in a theater near me I'll probably watch them there
lol Lank, I'm debating if I just wanna wait until all the PriPri movies are out before binging them all or watching them as they release.
That's actually pretty interesting lol, I always love hearing about stuff like this for una musume
<:KanonYo:843630060283494410>
Just imagine WEP is a 7 episode anime and it's pretty good <:Ver:704169051391524875>
🥚
My PC really doesn't like me trying to download torrents for some reason, that's too much effort xD
I didn't realize it aired today lol
Oh there's a new slime ep?
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
I'll just reminisce about the last few episodes of S2 Part 1
World building is nice and all but I wanna see some action already in slime
I've only seen the first ep of superstar so far, but I absolutely love the main girl this time around
<:KanonYo:843630060283494410>
Setsuna is a good girl
<a:YuCheer:754740038994231346>
Join the cult
Just learn moonrunes so you don't have to wait for TLs
Hi sad today, I'm Ash
It'd be an absolute trainwreck, but I'd watch every second of it
You know, I'd be down for a RuneScape anime lmao
There's Nova as expected
Oh hey, apparently Aoi Yuki is voicing a random character in standing on 1mil lives S2.
Hopefully at least the last few eps will be bangers like the eps in S2 part 1 were.
<a:ChrisRage:745358256242688102>
Gimme some cool action already
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
Tensura has been literally nothing but 3 episodes of exposition so far
||That would be one hell of a twist lol. Did they mention how her parents passed away yet? Or have they not gone into detail on that. But yeah my guess is either she has a sibling she doesn't know about (I'd be surprised if that was the case) or that her mom had a miscarriage or something of the sort and the child was lost.||
I am curious as to where they're going with the whole ||Maternity handbook thing though. That could be interesting||
This weeks Aquatope was nice, though I feel like they're hinting towards ||Choko dying and I know that's gonna be sad as fuck <:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970> ||
<a:YuCheer:754740038994231346>
Then you can start Nijigasaki
<:Yousoro:715479194888437811>
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
Kase-san is a super cute anime indeed
I forgot about dragon ball lol
I wonder if that's a lot or a little compared to other VA's. I feel like it's probably on the higher side but I have no clue
<:HibikiDab:688190074395164696>
<:KanonYo:843630060283494410>
There's also Kanon in Superstar who has orange hair <:Ver:704169051391524875>
Setsuna is really cool <:SetsuHappy:715459030314647555>
<a:YuCheer:754740038994231346>
Who's that again?
Are there still a bunch of "Onii-sama" 's coming from Miyuki?
Is that the spinoff about Miyuki(Is that her name?)
Probably, unless they decide to go in a completely different direction for whatever reason
<a:YuCheer:754740038994231346>
Or the movie that Niji will hopefully get
<:KasuShrug:626072720404250669>
True, as far as I remember there aren't really any references to previous seasons in Niji. But still
I would expect you to wake up in the middle of the night if there's idol Convo going on tbh
Oh hey Nova finally got summoned
<a:rinargb:783767052694847538>
I like Ai, her puns are always great
Protecc
She's precious
It's the whole Clark Kent/Superman thing. The glasses and the differences in behavior make no one suspect it lmao
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
<a:YuCheer:754740038994231346>
Welcome to the club
Yeah Niji has the highest amount of girls I really liked from any Love Live season. There's only like one or two that I wasn't a huge fan of (But they're still cool)
They are all cute tho <:HibikiThink:688429715362414641>
<:KasuShrug:823289963968725012>
Lol that's a good description for Kasu
Damn that's good
Like ep 1 hits and you get Setsunas firey Concert and it's just <:sweaty:839235693699661834>
The visuals for Niji are really good <:KirikaSmug:607742561414676517>
School idols hold a mysterious power
<:MariaScared:672584661125431299>
Oh no, Nova explaining sifas
Tragic
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
She is real if you're delusional enough
I'll have to rewatch it
I like vaguely remember that
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
I'm out here trying to remember what the hell y'all are even talking about
<:HibikiGay:670494484701773845>
Yep that one, good stuff lmao
Lmao
I think I've read that manga if it's what I think it is
Charm point aside, can we talk about how good Yu's hair looks when it's down like that
<:SetsuLewd:692615014934249513>
<:SetsuSparkle:802425458531893258>
I reject Yu x Ayumu and embrace Yu x Setsuna
I've got about that many too though this year is a little low compared to the last couple years
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
I may not have seen cel animation, but I have seen Cell animation
The Dragon Ball Broly movie from 1993 is apparently the oldest anime I've seen. Followed by some Initial D seasons and then Nanoha (2004)
<:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
I thought that said houseki no Kuni for a sec and was confused lol
<a:YuCheer:754740038994231346>
I think in general there's not much on my list before like 2007 so I'm not too far off from that lol
Symphogear S1 was what? Like 2011/12 or something like that
The oldest thing I've seen is probably like Initial D or something lol
I don't think I've watched anything that could be really considered as boomer anime
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
Nah you're still a boomer
Wait when did sunshine air
Superstar is the first time I'm watching Love Live while it's airing, it's an interesting experience
xD
I still need to watch ep 2 lol
<:ChrisPray:672578403156885504>
August 7th for GX Blu Ray maybe?
No spoilers pls, I haven't gotten there <:KanonYo:843630060283494410>
I feel like everyone I've seen seems to like Keke and it's weird to me because I don't like her at all xD
I like torturing myself so I'll just watch it so I can suffer the waiting
I loved ep 1 tho
I still gotta watch ep 2, maybe I'll do that later today when I get off of work.
<:KanonYo:843630060283494410>
<:MariaScared:672584661125431299>
Anyone know if there's a good  list of what's airing on what day this season compiled somewhere?
Yeah
I won't deny that there are some boring parts, but for the most part I enjoyed S2 Part 1. The last few eps in particular were easily my favorites from anything that season .
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
I just want some fight scenes, If I wanted to hear about politics for 20 minutes I'd just go watch the news
<a:ChrisRage:745358256242688102>
Tensura S2 Part 2 has now been nothing but 4 episodes of exposition. Give me some action scenes damn it
<:ChrisPray:672578403156885504>
Where's New Game season 3? I'm still praying
I know it's tragic <:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
male disguise? tsk, cowards
Yeah I remember the scene, I just don't recall the outfit
I don't even remember the outfit from the anime tbh
A goddess? <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
Of course
👀
OwO?
<:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
<:sweaty:839235693699661834>
The one on the left is lookin hot in that uniform
Idk who they are, but they're cute
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
OwO we talking about some isekai here?
I finally got around to watching the 2nd Love Live Superstar ep, good stuff
I'd have to check my list, but off the top of my head I'd probably agree tbh
<:CarolSmug:617040484111745027>
Amazing movie
Yeah all I've seen if SAO is up to the gun stuff. Anything beyond that is a mystery to me
There's a movie? TIL
So you're both boomers?
My numbers look weak in comparison lol
30k episodes watched, jesus
I think i only have like 1 anime on my dropped list, Index S1 lol
Out of curiosity i decided to see if there was any trend of scores vs years. not really xD
I feel like all those scores are high, i couldnt imagine scoring that many anime 9's and 10's
If the dark side has cute girls I'm always down to go there
<:KanonRun:860449384370274304>
At least now I can join the Love Live waiting game properly
Nova called forth by the love live mentions as usual i see
<:KanonYo:843630060283494410>
I love Kanon and the white haired girl (I forgot her name lol) tho
Nope
<a:KanonVibing:839850211631038464>
Truly a viewpoint I can't fathom
Listen, main character boi was boring as hell. And i wasnt interested at all in the magic nonsense
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
That anime left me big confused. I feel like I need an economics degree to understand it lol
Have fun with the absolute rollercoaster of a ride S2 is though. You're in for a good time
||Yes <:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970> ||
As much as I wanna click that (presumably gay) spoiler now
I'll have to watch that when I get home
Oh right Aquatope aired yesterday didn't it
<:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
They're cute <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
Horse go zoom
I loved reading the weekly discussion threads when it was airing that talked about all the facts of the irl horses.
Yeah
I've said it before, but S2 was ***Wayyyy*** better than a show about horse girls had any right to be. Like, I expected average cute girls anime and got that fantastic season.
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
Horse girls
By a *wide* margin
Yeah i think so
Yeah with how great S2 was and how popular uma musume seems to be I totally wouldn't be surprised if a S3 was announced
Uma Musume S2 was far better than I would've ever expected it to be
I know right!
Also that end scene <:MariaScared:672584661125431299>
<:HibikiGay:670494484701773845>
AHH I *really* hope this is yuri
I just watched the new Aquatope ep
Idk much about that one but she looks cute
Is that the girl from kanojo no kanojo?
You know what, fair. I'm a coward I suppose
I'm at work right now lol
I will when I get home
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
All these Aquatope spoiler tags are tempting me but I haven't seen the new ep yet so I can't click them
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
Anything with a watch order that isn't explicitly clear is just big confusion for me usually
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
Yeah googling it I wouldn't have gotten that
I probably wouldn't understand lol https://anilist.co/user/Gelb8374/animelist
<:HibikiThink:688429715362414641>
Now I'm tempted to watch it to see what you're talking about
Like it's gonna be 26 episodes, surely there's gotta be Yuri in there
They all look so good
I already clicked it of course
How gay is blue reflection btw? I've only watched like 3 eps
A second season of Anos doing insane stuff, I've been looking forward to it too
Also, that song is great
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
Yep, cute girls doing hockey
I can't wait
The girls are super cute too
Ahh it looks so good
I miss kissanime, rip <:ChrisPray:672578403156885504>
*"Onii-sama" intensifies*
Lewd, I love it <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
Apparently Jahy-sama aired today, I remember reading a little of the manga but it seems like it's gonna be a fun one.
Magia is like the one Madoka song I remember, it's great.
Oh right i completely forgot about Kyoko lol
I forget, is sayaka the blue haired one?
Lmao
<:ChrisBang:702166093065748500>
It's a good one
<:HibikiThink:688429715362414641>
It's been really nice so far
Aquatope <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
<:HibikiFingerguns:688429715836502063>
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
Good ole suffering
Big dog, dinosaur, and Splatoon
I think I only watched like 3-4 eps
That's one of the things from last season that I need to finish
Is that super cub?
Tbh I was expecting a bit more from it since I heard all about how it's the top grossing anime film and whatnot, but it was definitely enjoyable
The movie was good
Hasn't the demon slayer manga ended
I don't think I've seen any of the latter half of S5 tho
Since I've read the manga I basically skipped through the S5 anime looking for the cool scenes
I wonder how long it'll actually be until I can see it in a theater
Oh dang that's like this weekend
Yeah they're basically side stories that don't impact the main plot
Wait is the movie coming that soon?
Yeah idk where the anime is right now in terms of manga chapters
I honestly don't remember the timeline of the manga too well but I feel like there's definitely enough content for plenty more seasons
Eri is very precious
There better be some real Pog stuff coming after 5 episodes of nothing but talking
That scene was cool as hell 👌
Give me a fight scene for gods sake please
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
It's been 5 episodes and it's just been exposition
Slime isekai is driving me crazy this season
<:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
I thought Aquatope was today only to realize that it airs tomorrow instead.
That's super cute I love it
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
How gay is it
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
When timelines start getting all fucky wucky I get confused real quick
I just remember I got really confused, probably because I didn't pay enough attention. I only have so much brain power to devote to thinking about the plot of an anime and Re:Zero exceeded that.
Maybe one day I'll finish that
I gotta start that one
~~That didn't stop Citrus~~
Yeah I wonder if that'll be the way they lead into it
Now that I think about it, there's also ||Fuuka's idol past to cover as a plot point. Surely there's gotta be an episode or two where someone she used to know as an idol or that one girl who took her spot shows up for whatever reason.|| So many different routes this could go
That'd be kinda fucked up lol
Yeah I have no clue how much time is gonna be covered in the anime. It could go anywhere at this point
Yeah, ||That was the resolution I was hoping for when the mom was introduced at the end of last episode. She accepts that Fuuka wants to stay and let's her. I also hope that Fuuka ends up transferring to Kukuru's school instead of leaving at the end of summer. ||
Even if it doesn't it's still super cute and wholesome but I'm still hoping
God I really hope Aquatope turns out to be yuri
<:HibikiGay:670494484701773845>
She looks so good
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
I didn't even notice
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
It's super cute
I've been looking forward to Aquatope in particular all week
Unrelated, but man this week's Aquatope ep was super cute ||I loved Kukuru immediately going into full action mode to help Fuuka avoid her mom who wanted to take her back. Good job Kukuru, protecc her well||
Isn't that the lewd one?
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
An isekai protag that likes socializing?
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
Humanity hasn't gone far enough, we need more
<a:FastRin:694380776485289985>
Gotta go fast
But still <:KirikaPog:605209108827734017>
I thought that one had already been announced
Yeah that's the only one I remember
Idk how I'm feeling about that trailer tho
I've read that manga a bit and enjoyed it
Oh hey, isekai
I see a lot of cute girls but I don't they're doing cute things here
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
Maybe one day I'll watch it again
GX pls
<:ChrisPray:672578403156885504>
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095> there's a handful of series like that though I don't think it's as common nowadays.
The first 2 movies are just recaps I think
<a:YuRinaPat:685159694809169933>
I remember trying to watch something on Funimation once, the video kept resetting back to the start for no reason and messing up the subs. It was a bad experience lol
Torrents never wanna work on my PC for whatever reason lol
On the topic of bocchi, there's a completely unrelated manga called "bocchi the rock!" That has some similar vibes and is getting an anime at some point.
<:KanonHug:716009756313256016>
Oh right it was this week wasn't it
Generally if there's an anime for a series announced or airing I try not to read the manga unless it was something I was already reading.
I feel like I could've literally read a summary of the last 6 episodes and I wouldn't have lost anything if I didn't watch the anime
<a:ChrisRage:745358256242688102>
Tensura is absolutely killing me this season. It's been 6 episodes of nothing but exposition. Please, give me a fucking combat scene already. I'm suffering here.
You know what, they can do as much exposition as they want. But the last few eps better be bangers like they were last season.
<:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
Pls no
~~*How many more episodes of pure exposition are there gonna be though*~~
Slime S2 part 1 was amazing

Gimme animated edgebikki
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
Symphogear XDU
Also, those eyes are really pretty. I just noticed
Good girls
Pizza girl <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
Those questions aside though, I wanna see some gay already <:MikuGay:336656810788388864>
Yeah ||I assumed that Kukuru was seeing her sister||
Yeah I was hoping it'd lead to a cool easter egg but the anime website is a fine option too
<:HibikiGay:670494484701773845>
Aquarium lesbians are full of top secret info
This week's Aquatope ep ||This ep starting hard with the newspaper article about Gama Gama closing <:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970> Udon coming in clutch tho with the food help <:ChrisMunch:688191202973319198> I have a feeling that the social media stuff may eventually lead to some stuff with Fuuka and her idol past. Like, someone she knows sees her in an image that got posted or something. Who knows though, this anime could go in any direction at this point. Old dude who visits the aquarium every year seems like a total bro <:GenjuroThumbsUp:336657189475188740> We also got some more info on the whole maternity handbook thing maybe? <:HibikiThink:688429715362414641> Good ep though, props to Udon-chan for being a good girl||
There's a QR code in the ep <:KirikaPog:605209108827734017>
<:HibikiGay:670494484701773845>
I'm home and I've got food, time for Aquatope
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
I've been looking forward to watching it when I get home all day
<:KirikaPog:605209108827734017>  I watched 2 from that year
Also, there's a Maplestory anime? I had no idea lmao https://anilist.co/anime/2719/MapleStory/
Ah it finally worked, I've only seen 1 thing on that list lol
I can't even see anything in that list xD
Is that Teio? Fuck she's so cute
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
Surely it's gotta be https://anilist.co/anime/8876/Working-with-Voice/
<:HibikiThink:688429715362414641>
Ah I remember her now
Oh was Aoi Yuki in that?
It definitely wasn't the most well written thing but it had some cool scenes imo
I never rate any anime <:HibikiFingerguns:688429715836502063>
Maybe i'll check it out latert
Does it work with stuff like pirate sites, or just official stuff?
How does it know to update?
There's still so many good isekai that could use adaptations tho
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2021-08-15/chiyu-maho-no-machigatta-tsukai-kata-isekai-comedy-light-novel-gets-anime/.176276 More isekai
There's that OVA(?) Too right? Live house or something
Apparently anilist also has Granbelm, LBX Girls, and Nanoha: Detonation as stuff I've watched that it has tagged as mecha.
Yeah Code Geass is the only thing I think I've seen that I could count as Mecha. Maybe Knights & Magic too.
Holy shit there was actually some fighting in this week's Tensura
<:KirikaPog:605209108827734017>
There's an OVA in between them technically but it's not like it had anything you need to know to watch S2 https://anilist.co/anime/6862/KON-Live-House/
<:MariaScared:672584661125431299>
Spider
I'm on the galaxy brain solution of having 0 Precure on my list
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
*Me trying to guess a Precure OP in AMQ*
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
I can't find her anything except annoying
The only one I don't like so far is definitely Keke tho
Oh right, I honestly forgot she wasn't a member yet lmao
I love Kanon even more, she's just such a good character, super cute and has some interesting depth to her. Chisato is a really nice seeming support character. I honestly didn't expect to like Sumire based on the what little I saw of her in the trailer and previous eps, but surprisingly she was better than I expected. She gives off some Yohane vibes but isn't chuuni enough to have that define her character. Good stuff so far
So I caught up on Superstar.
<:ChrisPray:672578403156885504>
I may do that in a bit
I need to catch up on superstar, I'm a couple eps behind
Ah...
<:HibikiThink:688429715362414641>
Oof
I didn't even know that was a thing in Evangelion. TIL
So, I'm out of the loop here. What's all this Fly Me To The Moon stuff about?
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
Kukuru is so damn cute I love her
Just watched Aquatope, ||I really hope it doesn't close, but I do fear that you may be right <:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970> Also, holy shit this is so gay <:HibikiGay:670494484701773845> ||
<:HibikiGay:670494484701773845>
I can't wait to get home so I can watch Aquatope
Gimme Uma Musume S3
That reminds me I'll have to check out the movie whenever it gets released in theaters here
that one
Ah
I barely even remember where the plot is around this point since I haven't been keeping up with the anime but I'm pretty much caught up with the manga.
What's bad about it this time around? The animation? plot?
'Made in Abyss: The Golden City of the Scorching Sun' Ooh S2 has a cool name
<:ChrisDJ:690470897194369034>
I wasn't a huge fan of it at first, but now Tensura's OP for this season has really grown on me.
Still super wholesome tho
Idk if I'd call that one Yuri, but it's definitely CGDCT
I've seen the other two in theaters so might as well see this one too
Yeah
If S2 covers some of the stuff I think it will then it's gonna be amazing
<:MariaScared:672584661125431299>
||Also that new girl at the end of the episode was cute <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594> ||
🦀
Aquatope was good
I mean they already sleep together, why bother pushing them on the bed <:Ver:704169051391524875>
Do it
<a:YuCheer:754740038994231346>
Interesting, I forgot about that scene
Oh god I'm about to watch Aquatope when I get home. <:MariaScared:672584661125431299>
Lmao that sounds hilarious
One day I'll watch that franchise *I lie to myself knowing that I have a million other things that I say I'll watch eventually and no time*
Also can we talk about how ||Fuuka could've ridden with the guy in the truck with AC but chose to be with Kukuru instead <:HibikiGay:670494484701773845> ||
That whole bit was hilarious
🦀
🧄⬆️
well that far at least xD
I mean i only read one chapter so i assume it was mostly accurate lol
I remember reading a chapter of the manga and stopped when i saw it was getting an anime because i didnt wanna spoil myself. Maybe I'll try to watch a few eps if I get a chance
How is that one so far btw? I was gonna watch it but never got around to it
Bokutachi no Remake I assume
Nova getting summoned as usual at any mention of love live
<a:YuCheer:754740038994231346>
It was cool just not really my kinda thing
I mean I wasn't a huge fan of the anime anyway so I probably wouldnt go watch the movie anyway xD
Wait there was a movie?
👀
OwO cute girls?
<:ChrisBang:702166093065748500>
Any particular genre?
The only good Shun episode was the one near the end where he was getting beat the fuck up <:Ver:704169051391524875>
Don't give them ideas <:MariaScared:672584661125431299>
That was the one that was pretty lewd wasn't it? Or am I thinking of something else
Just go reread AinCiel <:Ver:704169051391524875> What more could you need?
I saw that one when i was at the bookstore the other day and thought about buying it
<a:ChrisRage:745358256242688102>
me want combat
I feel like barely anything significant has happened so far in Tensura this season and we're already at like ep 9
I just realized there's a guy on the bus in front of me that's watching Jojo <:KirikaPog:605209108827734017>
I feel like if I ever did watch fate I'd either just do whatever release order they aired in (I assume a bad idea) or just watch the one with the cute girls.
*Someone go find a flowchart* <:Ver:704169051391524875>
There was a bigger selection of manga/ln's than i expected to see but it was a Barnes & Noble so its a bit of a bigger chain
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
Fuck Leon too
It really was <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
I enjoyed it <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
I think I've read the manga for that one if it's what I'm thinking of
ah that one
OSO?
I've read a few decent ones, but yeah a lot of them are incoherent messes
I think I tried reading that WN once and yeah it was a disaster.
||Oh god that sounds super cute, now I want that too <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594> ||
||I'm expecting something along the lines of Fuuka getting guilted into doing some kinda idol thing she doesn't really want to and Kukuru saving her. Well, at least that's what i'm kinda hoping for||
||I'm more interested in where the Fuuka bit is going though right now||
||I feel like they're totally gonna pull a "Wow i can understand the charm of this aquarium that i once thought was trash now!" ||
||I do wonder if we're ever gonna get more detail on the whole seeing visions in the aquarium thing lol||
She really is
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
Other episode comments though ||Sister-zoned? <:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>  Also new girl was awful, beat her up Kukuru! Fuuka getting a call from idol girl, I hope she's not trying to get her to come back or something just to use her. I wonder what that ending scene is leading up to. Kukuru is visiting the new aquarium but to do what? <:HibikiThink:688429715362414641> ||
Aquatope ||AHHHH HANDHOLDING||
I wanna see some more Arisa because she was super cute
I keep telling myself that i'll continue watching bandori one day
<:MariaScared:672584661125431299>
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
With MHA I just skim through the episodes looking for the cool parts at this point since I've read the manga and know where it's going lol
Kumo desu ga was 24 eps and was pretty recent
Aquatope is also gonna be 24 eps so there's even less telling where the heck it's gonna go lol
Idk where Aquatope is gonna go at this point
Idk if i'd necessarily call that one good, but at least its not a trainwreck
I don't think i've read the manga but it feels that way in the anime at least. the story was alright until then, but then just became a mess
All you need to know is that it's isekai, the synopsis are basically all the same for those <:Ver:704169051391524875>
<:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
It's isekai so my expectations weren't the highest but man I feel like the plot for Seirei Gensouki is pretty incoherent at this point. It feels like it's just skipping around to a bunch of different events.
Panzer vor!
<:YumiPoint:688429724103344164>
it wasn't good or bad, it was just kinda there
that's all i have to say about it
lbx girls existed
I just watched it, AHHH IT LOOKS SO GOOD
I wanna see ||Another Fuji climb where Aoi(was that her name?) Gets to get to the top this time||
Cute girls doing climbing
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594> <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594> <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
I can't click that right now, but is that yama no susume s4 PV?
Oh hey i have that one open in another tab but haven't read it yet xD
<:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
nothing lewd here
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
That's the good shit i've been waiting for
Ahhh holy shit this weeks slime ep was so good
I'm looking forward to watching it when I get home
👀
<:MariaScared:672584661125431299>
bad, no
<:MikuDelete:661660028410920990>
Just watched Aquatope ||Ahhh fuck what a sad ep <:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970> I wanted cute and gay aquarium girls not the feels of them having their dreams shattered. Yeah I totally think its gonna close at this point and I know that's gonna be heartbreaking to watch. I have no clue where it'd go from there tho. Also, Damn it Fuuka, don't do it. Stay with your lover Kukuru!||
I can't wait to get home and watch Aquatope so I can click that spoiler
I wanna read that, it sounds amazing
I feel like my opinions on the characters haven't changed so far
<:KanonYo:843630060283494410>
I caught up on Superstar. Kanon is super cute as expected
a what now
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcg3hQS8-0A
Plus its OP was a banger <:ChrisDJ:690470897194369034>
👌
Spyce was a good anime
<:wheeze:758563748172136478>
OwO what's this?
<:ChrisMunch:688191202973319198> -> <:ChrisShock:620077681484103680>
<:MariaScared:672584661125431299>

Oh god it sounds so cringy lol
Friendship through superior firepower
<:KirikaPog:605209108827734017>
It sounds like the kinda thing I'd read so I'll throw it on the list of things I may read eventually
The description sounds like a complete mess lol
Wanna share with the class Ikxi?
👀
<a:mariWhale:596707359053840401>
~~Profit~~
yeah it's not like it's a masterpiece with a super engaging plot or anything. But it told a good story and the characters were good too <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
yeah spyce is fun
Who was that again?
Yeah premise wise it definitely felt pretty unique
I should catch up on S2
Dang, I didn't realize it was that popular
I remember hearing good things about that one
Ah
What is this?
<:HibikiThink:688429715362414641>
<:MariaScared:672584661125431299>
This is unsettling
A Doga Kobo cute girl show? <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594><:MikuExcited:738174629251907594><:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
<:wheeze:758563748172136478>
I remember you shilling that when it was airing <:Ver:704169051391524875>
<:KirikaDisgust:688431636043268097>
Yeah this absolutely sounds like something I'd read lmao
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
Like 'By the grace of the gods' for example
I feel like there's a lot of stuff recently that I never would've expected to see getting a second season
Isn't this one apparently getting a S2?
<:ChrisDJ:690470897194369034>
I just randomly came across it while listening to some playlist but man, the ED for Shadows House is a banger. Now i kinda wanna watch the anime even more
~~I miss Aniwatch~~ <:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
<:KanonShook:858787780934369300>
9anime is what i generally use these days and haven't really had any issues
Give 'I Favor the Villainess' an anime, it's Isekai *AND* Yuri <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
<:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
There's a bunch of Isekai I'd love to see get adaptations still. We need more! <a:ChrisRage:745358256242688102>
The real problem is that there isn't enough Isekai, we need more
This week's slime isekai ||Veldora spamming Hadoukens and anime attacks holy shit <:wheeze:758563748172136478> ||
Not even any Isekai? Shame
<:KirikaPog:605209108827734017>
OwO Fena looks cute
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
If it's continuing next season then that's another one to add to my list
That reminds me, do we know if Aquatope is continuing next season?
Hmm, there are a few i'm really looking forward to for the fall season like *Demon Slayer S2,* *Mushoku Tensei S2*, and *Mieruko-chan*. But the other stuff i'll probably watch is just isekai like: '*The World's Finest Assassin Gets Reincarnated in Another World as an Aristocrat*', '*Banished from the Hero’s Party, I Decided to Live a Quiet Life in the Countryside*', '*Isekai Shokudou S2*', '*Shinka no Mi: Shiranai Uchi ni Kachigumi Jinsei*'. Then there are a couple cute girl ones like *Pride of Orange* or *Selection Project*.
That reminds me I gotta check out what all is coming next season
I see those cute girl anime in there <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
I think I'll probably stick with all the stuff I'm planning on watching next season. Since since some of it is S2's or an adaptation of stuff I enjoyed, and the others are Isekai and CGDCT which can't really go wrong.
Well maybe I'll get lucky and it'll pop up on some pirate sites
I didn't realize
Oh is it a movie and not an actual anime? Rip
Well, guess that's another addition to the stuff I'm gonna watch next season
I don't need to have seen any of the other SAO stuff like alicization or anything to watch this do I?
<:KirikaPog:605209108827734017>
Wait this actually looks kinda pog
I'm not home yet <:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
<:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
Iski you're making me worried
<:MariaScared:672584661125431299>
<:CarolSmug:617040484111745027>
Oh nice it's got Inori Minase
<:MariaScared:672584661125431299>
Yep that's the scene
Now I guess I'm gonna have to watch that
<:MariaScared:672584661125431299>
I just saw a clip from Vivid Strike, I thought this was just cute girls but now I'm concerned
I mean ||Time skip is a possibility i could legitimately see them just throwing out there outta nowhere <:Ver:704169051391524875> ||
That bit was 10/10
<:wheeze:758563748172136478>
Also, can we talk about
||Yeah that one girl who was kinda a bitch may come into play again. if that's what they're going for||
But yeah ||I have no fucking clue where this is going next. Gay? Kukuru trying to find some new goal in life maybe? Fuuka maybe doing that movie or other idol stuff? It could go anywhere||
I expected ||Cute aquarium lesbians not two girls having their dreams shattered||
Aquatope why
AHHH ||Fuck i'm crying, I knew this was probably gonna happen but ahhhh it's so god damn sad.||
<:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
Oh god I started the Aquatope ep
Yeah I'd probably go for Fate too
A's is super <:KirikaPog:605209108827734017>
Yeah it feels like that'll probably be the case
I'm still waiting for the answer of where the hell it's gonna go next. There's still a whole other cour left
Watching through Vivid Strike and seeing the full context, yeah those kids totally deserved to be fucked up by Rinne.
its pog
I saw someone mention that in the r/anime discussion thread earlier
Math <:MariaScared:672584661125431299>
The whole time i'm watching this I can only hear Carol's voice since Inori is voicing the MC
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
Man i need to watch S2 still
There's gonna be a movie?
I forgot about dailymotion, i remember watching most of Doctor Who on there years ago
<:KirikaPog:605209108827734017>
After finishing the Vivid Strike OVA's I think I've consumed basically all the Nanoha anime there is
I'm still holding on to the fleeting hope that it's gonna be gay
<:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
Welcome to the club
Is that a fantasy genre and a cute girl I see?
<:HibikiGay:670494484701773845>
Please, I wanna see the gay
she's great, she just fucking beats the hell outta all of em
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
There's also this that isn't isekai but might as well be https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2021-09-17/the-greatest-demon-lord-is-reborn-as-a-typical-nobody-anime-reveals-2022-tv-debut-main-staff/.177497
I've read the manga, as far as isekai go it's one of the less bad ones
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
OwO no one told me about more isekai anime https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2021-09-17/my-isekai-life-tv-anime-reveals-teaser-visual-2022-premiere/.177459
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
From what I understand, that's a win
That's a good one Ikxi
But yeah they do have that idol look xD
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
I mean I'd totally be down for idols playing ice hockey too
I know nothing about ice hockey but it looks good
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594> <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594> <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
Looking at MAL, I think the only KyoAni stuff I've seen is just Violet Evergarden and k-on
~~The most underrated anime is Teekyu because it has like 9 seasons clearly~~
<:KanonYo:843630060283494410>
That movie was so damn good <:TsubasaBliss:672861879000891432>
~~There's only 1 anime on my dropped list~~
I basically never drop anything, after the few eps it takes to determine if something is a complete disaster, I figure since im already a few eps in i might as well finish it
Cypher, do we need to have a talk? I don't see Comic Girls on that list.
<:ShirabeStare:582381430915596289>
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
Exactly why I know you have good taste <:HibikiFingerguns:688429715836502063>
I don't see any Comic Girls there, truly trash taste indeed
That's a nice emote ya got there
👀
That OP sounds too cool for that anime
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
Speaking of isekai, the PV for Mushoku Tensei's second cour looks 10/10 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BbbRytVhaDs
<:wheeze:758563748172136478>
<:KirikaPog:605209108827734017>
I always wanna see more isekai
Now I'm just remembering the swimsuit ep <:MariaScared:672584661125431299>
Yeah that one got much better in the later episodes but the first half was a mess
If I've watched 3 episodes of something then I'm already too invested to quit. I already watched like 1/4 of the anime, I might as well finish it for completionist sake.
Anime is truly a disaster yeah, just like in general ya know

😠
As long as it's cgdct i'll watch all the SoL
She also helped that girl with her childhood friend, and you know what that got her? ||Trauma||
I can confirm that plants do grow. I'm well versed in that field
Hold up, what are we talking about here 👀
Cypher already saw my take when index came up earlier <:Ver:704169051391524875>
Majo no Tabitabi was my favorite anime from that season , I feel like I'd probably enjoy whatever stories they skipped a lot. <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
I saw it at the bookstore last time i went, maybe ill pick it up next time i go
👀  You're really making me wanna read LN here
<@!161155855524298752> Now I'm getting real tempted after that elaina talk earlier
🍵
Chiya is a good girl

The movie was so good
It definitely felt like they just picked a handful of the chapters from the source material and adapted them but didn't include the stuff between them so it all felt disconnected and rushed.
<:MariaScared:672584661125431299>
I do wanna watch gekidol at some point, i remember seeing people in here always talk about how it made no sense when it was airing
Lank, i already know that's probably too high iq for me
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
Now that Seirei Gensouki  is finished, I can say with confidence that it was an incomprehensible mess.
I'll have to watch it at some point
I completely forgot that one was airing this season
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
Nah it's not the format, I just feel like I barely have enough time to ever do anything <:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
One of these days i'll read it ~~I say to myself knowing i probably won't~~
I'll have to make an effort to actually read them lol. I still have the 'I Favor The Villainess' vol 3 that i bought like 2 months ago but havent read yet sitting on my desk.
I bought vol 1-3 for now, i'll probably get the rest if i ever get around to reading these
Index <:MikuDelete:661660028410920990>
I don't think they ever explained anything about how magic works in the anime so it's nice
Also, some of the details mentioned about magic are super interesting
<@161155855524298752> I'm a few chapters into the first volume and Elaina is honestly hilarious. I love seeing all her narcissistic thoughts lol
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
I haven't seen those so it's sound judgement to me
~~Maybe if it was a good anime there'd be a s2~~
Could the expenses of producing an anime really be worth however much publicity or LN sales it drives? I feel like i'm either overestimating production costs or underestimating the impact an anime has.
Maybe I just don't have a great knowledge of the industry, buy I do wonder how some of the stuff that airs actually gets made. Like, how does this stuff profit? I can't imagine people are running out to buy the LN for that pharmacist drugstore Isekai for example.
wait, there was a s3 announced too?
<:KirikaPog:605209108827734017>
The first few minutes of this week's Tensura were pog as fuck
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
I hope that it being a movie means there'll be a lot of cool fight scenes
I'm glad tho because I've been really enjoying slime
But who knows
Hopefully it'll show up in theaters
Oohhh <:KirikaPog:605209108827734017>
I'm really enjoying em, plus it's easier to read a lot of short stories than to read a long ln
Yep
I'm enjoying these far more than I thought I would. I'll probably order the next few volumes too <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
I guess I'll read the third volume tomorrow now that I've finished the second one 😺
<:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
The sheep girl though
<:HibikiGay:670494484701773845>
I also wasn't expecting some Yuri to come out of nowhere
Yeah, I think there was only like 1 covered in the anime
I'm almost done with volume 2 now <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
Also, I just now thought about it, but I wonder how many countries there are in that world
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
I finished the first volume and Majo no Tabitabi is a good read so far. It's nice to see a lot of the small details and adventures that the anime didn't include. I also love seeing more of Elaina's thoughts  because she's hilarious.
I can't wait to see who the VA's are and if it's gonna differ from how I imagine the characters to sound
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
She's precious af I love her
The only thing I really liked in that anime was Kozakura <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
That would suck, I really hope it's good.
But it's still really nice to know it's coming eventually
<:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
True
My day is so much better now that I saw that news <:ChrisHappy:660870796696223744>
Yep, that about sums it up
Hey <@237964037898502144> you've read this one right?
I wonder who's gonna voice the main characters.
It's what I'd actually consider a pretty good Isekai <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
This is one of the Isekai I was hoping would get an adaptation
<:KirikaPog:605209108827734017> <:KirikaPog:605209108827734017> <:KirikaPog:605209108827734017>
<:MariaScared:672584661125431299>
Wait what
Haven't even seen it xD
That's a good one <:HibikiGay:670494484701773845>
Should I be spending a bunch of money on LNs though? ~~Probably not~~ but oh well
Well, I just ordered the next volumes so I can suffer more once I read em <:HibikiFingerguns:688429715836502063>
<:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
Now I'm left to suffer knowing a S2 is unlikely and I won't see these stories animated.
~~I'd appreciate him if he was more interesting~~
Bland MC man
Railgun <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
<a:HibikiAniDisgust:777603915716755457>
If it does show up in theaters I'll probably give in and see it, but if it's just streaming then I'll probably wait.
I wonder if crown handler is gonna be in theaters at any point or if it's just gonna be online/Blu ray only
Oh right Aquatope is today
It's real tempting but I'm gonna wait til they're all out then treat is as a S2 and binge watch it
<:KirikaPog:605209108827734017>
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
Well, the same idea still applies
The spoilers are tormenting me, I'm just gonna yeet outta here until I watch the ep.
Wise words
One day....
I still gotta watch that one at some point
<:HibikiGay:670494484701773845>
Idk man, Sakura Trick is a pretty high bar to beat
I'm not expecting it to go the Yuri route tbh, but I'm still hoping for it regardless
they're pretty
<:HibikiGay:670494484701773845>
Also, I just noticed "Annisphia"? Is that what they're gonna TL her name as or is that just a typo
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
But still pog
I thought this was an anime announcement and I got super hyped for a sec
Oh no, I just got to the <:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089> story <:MariaScared:672584661125431299>
It's a very enjoyable read. I'll probably finish volume 3 today
Well, time to get back to reading Elaina stories now that I watched my weekly Aquatope.
<:KirikaPog:605209108827734017>
Wait, she voiced Riko? I didn't realize
I'm really hoping for yuri but im not expecting it at this point
i mean there has been a lot of sister talk ~~Though when has that ever stopped anyone *cough* Citrus *cough*~~
But yeah with that PV ||I do wonder why they just didn't include Fuuka at all <:HibikiThink:688429715362414641> ||
<:MikuDelete:661660028410920990>
OwO
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594> <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594> <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
👀
So, I watched the aquatope ep. ||I'm crying <:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970> ||
Machikado S2 is gonna be so good
i still gotta finish s1
I gotta make sure I'm ready to see the cute girl stuff at least tho
Now that this season is coming to an end I gotta finish up all the stuff I started watching so I can go into next season ready to procrastinate watching those
It still sounds really strange to me idk
Dang
Did that one end up being gay Lank?
Ive got so much Elaina now
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
The real problem is not enough isekai you heathen
Though there are magical robots like in Knights & Magic
well yeah its different if they're coming from an engine -_-
i mean cmon theyve got sparkly particles coming off of em
those things look magical af
Ah, someone in the comments already said it xD
Japan ruled and oppressed by foreign powers, fighting back with big robots. ~~Is this Code Geass~~ <:Ver:704169051391524875>
it is? Interesting
There's only like 3 anime i'm really looking forward to: Mushoku tensei, mieruko-chan, and pride of orange. I'm still gonna watch all the trash isekai tho  <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
yep, gorilla waifu
Mushoku tensei was pretty solid, but yeah the others are about what you'd expect
Of course I know the isekai next season too 🙂
-Mushoku Tensei S2
-The World's Finest Assassin Gets Reincarnated in Another World as an -Aristocrat 
-Isekai Shokudou S2
-The Fruit of Evolution: Before I Knew It My Life Had It Made
From what I can tell there's:
Mieruko-chan (Though that's also horror I suppose)
Selection Project (Idol)
Puraore!: PRIDE OF ORANGE (Girls doing ice hockey)
Yakunara Mug Cup Mo S2 (Girls doing pottery)
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
I'm just looking forward to the cute girl anime next season
That's quite something
<:MariaScared:672584661125431299>
The what <:MariaScared:672584661125431299>
<:HonkBread:715458424854282370>
<a:YuCheer:754740038994231346>
<:ChrisDJ:690470897194369034>
I don't know anything about Shaman King but that's a banger
I'm not hyped for that much this season, but there's still a few i'm really excited for. Just gotta wait a few more days for stuff to start airing <:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
Maybe one day i'll get around to checking out that franchise
I still need to finish s1 for mug
Also, I just noticed that https://anilist.co/anime/126790/Selection-Project/ is from Doga Kobo <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
I haven't started anything this season yet but apparently a few of the stuff i wanna watch start airing like friday i think
<:HibikiGay:670494484701773845>
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
Oh hey, I just realized some of the stuff i wanna watch for the fall season is airing really soon
<:ChrisPray:672578403156885504>
Well at least I got something to look forward to today. Since most fall anime haven't started yet, this week has been sad so far.
I still gotta wait until I get off of work to watch it, but still <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
<:KirikaPog:605209108827734017>
Is there still another Aquatope ep today? Or are they taking a break before the next cour?
Oof yeah if that's the case and there's not really any new stuff worth watching those eps for then I'll probably skip them.
I feel like I'll probably wait and see what the deal with Demon Slayer is after a few episodes before I watch it. If it's recap stuff then I'm just gonna not bother.
That one is pretty good 👌
Aquatope ep 13 ||Tbh i was honestly expecting Fuuka not to appear for a few episodes but I'm glad she's back. From the OP it also looked like she's living next to Kukuru <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>  I wonder what her role is gonna be tbh, support for Kukuru? Something more? Kukuru excited for her new job only to be assigned to marketing, poor girl. Also, i forget her name but man that one girl who "trained" at gama gama was a bitch.||
This week's Aquatope ep. AHHHH THAT ENDING
<:HibikiGay:670494484701773845>
I remember reading the manga for Sakura Trick and man was that a super gay ride
<:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
Gimme like 3 more seasons of Sakura Trick
👀

Wait, i thought he did that in the anime <:HibikiThink:688429715362414641>
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
I can't wait for this weekend. Mushoku Tensei, Mieruko-chan, and Isekai Shokudou are all starting <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
<:HibikiGay:670494484701773845> <:HibikiGay:670494484701773845> <:HibikiGay:670494484701773845>
<:HibikiGay:670494484701773845>
That's adorable
Clicking the circles <:KirikaPog:605209108827734017>
Oh hey, this isn't something I would've expected https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2021-10-01/our-last-crusade-or-the-rise-of-a-new-world-anime-gets-sequel/.178048
protecc
Suzune is precious
They're both precious in different ways. I don't judge between cute anime girls
the MC is precious af
It was a better than I was expecting for a first ep 👌
Selection Project aired today, a Doga Kobo show with cute girls and idols <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
<a:aKasuSwap:739563959337615493>
semi-related but another cute girl anime this season (Pride of Orange) has a character with Kasumi's VA
<a:YuCheer:754740038994231346>
Oh hey, Yu is finally getting to be an idol
<:ShirabeStare:582381430915596289>
<:NicoNicoNii:715458641720901663>
I feel like she's basically Nico
There's still enough content left for like 2 seasons tho
yeah not that long ago
Listen, I can dream
Does that mean there's even less hope for a New Game S3? 😦
<:ChrisPray:672578403156885504>
I saw that one
I don't remember much from S1, but the animation in Isekai Shoukudou S2 seems better than I expected it to be.
Comf anime
<:comf:815254068884799488>
<:ChrisDJ:690470897194369034>
I agree
Just gave it a listen
I want
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
<:ChrisPray:672578403156885504>
I think I only watched a few eps of Ex-Arm. The only disaster anime I can think of that I've finished is Gibiate
<:MariaScared:672584661125431299>
They just felt so out of place for me
One thing really weird about Mieruko was all the *questionable* camera angles outta nowhere. Like, why.
cute af

Yep
Russian vampire girl is cute as expected
Mieruko-chan is as absolutely terrifying as I imagined it to be. I love it
The new Mushoku Tensei ep was nice as expected. 👌
Well, on the list it goes. I'll probably at least watch a couple episodes.
Idk what's going on here but vampire girl looks quite cute
What now
I wanna say Mushoku Tensei, Mieruko-chan, and I forget the third one off the top of my head
I forget what all there was but I remember there's like 3 I was gonna watch
Oh hey, I just remembered a bunch of fall anime start airing today. Now I can't wait to get home <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
~~Now that there are new uniforms I need to get new pieces for my Yu cosplay~~
Oh Mia, I was looking at the other one
Is red third year?
<:YuuHyped:762379673816530984>
I like the uniforms tho
Same Nova
Ah
Shioriko looks kinda off to me, maybe it's the hair color
<a:YuCheer:754740038994231346>
It's sooner than I expected

Well, can't say I didn't try to like index <:Ver:704169051391524875>
Rip
Cypher, what's the strat for watching index if I only care about the Railgun characters? Like, how can I minimize seeing magic hand man and maximize seeing cool electric girl?
Index <:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
~~Sakira Trick needs more seasons too~~
I mean Sakura Trick is a 10/10
I've never scored any of the anime I've seen because decision making is hard lol
<:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
~~Wheres my Ms. Vampire Who Lives in My Neighborhood S2 tho~~
Oh don't get me wrong, it is really good. I just never would have expected it to continue on for as long as it has.
It has like 200+ chapters or something right now doesn't it? I'm surprised it lasted that long tbh
Oh hey, the Isekai with the gorilla waifu airs today
So, i watched the first ep of the isekai with the gorilla waifu and man that was absolute trash even by my low isekai standards lol. I'm still looking forward to it tho <:Ver:704169051391524875>
I think other than the stuff airing tomorrow, all the fall season stuff I'm planning on watching has already started. With the exception of Demon Slayer like you mentioned.
Rip no new anime I'm gonna watch for the fall season air today. But hey at least there's like 3 that I wanna watch airing tomorrow <:KirikaPog:605209108827734017>
Do you know if that's TLed anywhere yet?
I haven't even read vol 4 and 5 yet, but <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
That would be nice but I don't have any hopes sadly <:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
It's an off brand Sunshine <:wheeze:837213179380891688>
They've even got the token orange haired protagonist <:Ver:704169051391524875>
~~Now we need horse girls doing ice hockey or ice hockey girls doing horse racing~~
Yeah I was about to say that's basically Uma Musume lol
Apparently not
I mean it did look pretty idol-ish lol
Oh do they?
Is it the cute girls doing ice hockey
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
Lots of good stuff airing today. An Isekai, cute girls doing ice hockey, and a fantasy anime that's basically Isekai anyway.
I often forget her name isn't actually Shamiko
I don't recall it being *that* gay, but I also may be forgetting some stuff since it's been awhile since I've read it.
Machikado S2 is gonna be great, there's so much cool stuff coming
I was shocked when I got to that lol
Other assassin Isekai?
The power of cgdct is just that high
<:wheeze:758563748172136478>
<:ChrisDJ:690470897194369034>
it's a banger
I'm a bunch of episodes behind in Superstar <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
I mean, it sure does seem that way so far
It's a lot different than i was expecting
The only thing i can think about when all the girls are talking is that it totally reminds me of Nanoha Vivid
I'm calling it now she's totally gonna be aggressive af
Lmao Pride of Orange is starting off with a banger of an intro lol
❤️
I see, ty
Anyone know who the VA for this girl is from *'Banished from the Hero’s Party, I Decided to Live a Quiet Life in the Countryside'*? She sounds super familiar but I can't place it
The LN is great because it shows a lot more of Elaina's thoughts and they're hilarious. <:wheeze:837213179380891688>
<:ShirabeStare:582381430915596289>
That's quite the underestimation of cute girls doing ice hockey ya got there
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
I can't wait for work to be over today so I can watch Aquatope
<:HibikiGay:670494484701773845>
Aight gimme like 20 minutes and i'll get there
<:HibikiGay:670494484701773845>
<@!213645184125239317> Holy shit the first like minute of aquatope is so gay already
<@!161155855524298752> May know how gay it gets but idk
I haven't read vol 4+ yet so idk how gay they are
There was some solid gay in vol 3
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
I don't even have a driver's license, that's a multitude of crimes right there.
I'm on the bus home, I will when I get there
Wait it does?
Time to yeet outta here until I watch it
Ah
KV?
I mean, we did get the "You're like a big sister" line several episodes ago didnt we?
<:KukuruSmile:824729148446081034>
OwO that's a nice emote you got there
Kukuru's facial expressions throughout that were cute af tho
I mean fair
I'm still *Really* hoping that this is gonna be gay but I don't have any expectations at this point
<:HibikiGay:670494484701773845>
~~Comic Girls movie when~~
Comic Girls has no chance tho sadly and New Game odds are looking pretty slim
Yes to both Comic Girls and New Game. <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
I can't wait for all the additional Shamiko noises we're gonna get in S2
<:ChrisDJ:690470897194369034>
Kaos noises are good
Abababbaba
I have been summoned
👀
"I wanna make books" turns into a whole mess with magic and class conflicts lol
Bookworm is good
I think i only ever read like one chapter of the manga so I'll be going in pretty blind when it comes to the anime
That one's getting an anime adaptation isn't it?
👀 👀 👀

If i'm gonna read yuri then I'd much rather it be in manga/anime form than a LN. Which limits my options a fair bit
I don't think I've really read that much yuri
I'm gonna read through vol 4-6 this weekend so I'll have to see what other stories there are
That's a good story <:CarolSmug:617040484111745027>
What the hell kinda conversation did I just walk into here
Selection Project is going about as I expected so far
<:HibikiGay:670494484701773845>
~~Maybe it'll diverge and we'll get the yuri route~~
seems like it
<:KukuruGasp:863809996022218772>
There's a manga apparently?
OwO
👀 👀 👀
https://mangadex.org/title/930d4661-5550-4f66-a108-67ff2d55cd12/the-aquatope-on-white-sand
I'm surprised it's gonna be summer and not winter. Winter is the perfect season for comf
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
I'm hopefully gonna read through 4-6 this weekend
👀
I never finished S1 of mug
Actually, now that I look at it, I think I'm caught up on the novel. Looks like it hasn't updated in awhile
<:YumiPoint:688429724103344164>
I read a fair bit of that one, 👌
<:CarolSmug:617040484111745027>
Now there's a quality list
I think i only watched like 2 eps of jahy
You've got the cute girls on there so you're fine
See, Iski knows what's up
Imagine not having isekai or cgdct on there. Shame
Truly a line of thinking I can't fathom
Idols ranked low <:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
It's basically an isekai tho so i forgot
Wait, right it isn't lmao

Of course I'm watching it, it's an isekai
<a:ChrisAniPeek:736921566570479616>
<:CarolSmug:617040484111745027>
Mushoku Tensei was good, I just finished this weeks ep
All the lewd shots in Mieruko are still throwing me off but I'm really enjoying it so far
good stuff
👌
Ah, so it was that
Noted
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
Oh right theres a new ep of that today
After finishing it, I feel like none of the stories really stood out too much in volume 5 but it was still good nonetheless. I'll have to read vol 6 another time since it's getting late tho. <:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
Wait how many volumes are there?
👀👀👀
"Do you have a boyfriend" *I don't, and I never will.* "Do you have a girlfriend" *No.* Yuri confirmed? <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
I mean, I'm sure there are but
~~I wonder if there's fanfics of that already out there~~
There's enough other yuri here and there to satisfy me though <:CarolSmug:617040484111745027>
If it does, I haven't gotten to it yet <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095> But I'd wager no
Also, I like how the author for Elaina is 100% down for writing Yuri. 10/10
👀
They've got a lot of trust, it's nice to see
<@161155855524298752> I just finished with Vol 4 of Elaina, the story with Amnesia was so good.
I feel like it 100% is gonna do that
I'm expecting tragedy to happen and the vampire route will be abandoned
But yeah i don't think they'll get to the moon here i imagine
well the USSR did beat the US to the first guy in space anyway didn't they? So it's probably not gonna be any different here i imagine.
Oh right, i forgot the goal was just a person in space and not the moon yet
I do wonder tho if they're actually gonna make it to the moon or if they'll get beaten by whatever their version of the US is.
I think they're the USZR or something which is just an alternate USSR
Wdym
I just don't notice it i guess
I feel like animation quality doesn't really matter much to me unless it's something atrociously bad like Gibiate or Ex-Arm or something. <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
I'm enjoying space vampire even more, Irina is cute af
<:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
<:HibikiFingerguns:688429715836502063>
||Even though the anime is probably never gonna go that route, I'm still gonna believe it anyway <:HibikiGay:670494484701773845> <:MikuGay:336656810788388864>||
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
Looks like it hasn't seen an update since like may
yeah
yep
yeah i'm caught up with manga and what's TLed from the WN
Afaik that's the only one I'm aware of. Does it have an LN or something?
<:HibikiThink:688429715362414641>
I'm still waiting on more chapters to release for that one though Cypher <:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
fair
lol
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
That's a good one
👌
The gorilla waifu Isekai is such hot garbage. But I expected as much <:Ver:704169051391524875>
cute af
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
idk, gandalf is pretty cute tbh
Speaking of Mushoku, latest manga chapter was horny too
*very* horny elf lady
I feel like the author does a really good job of telling nice and wholesome stories but also throwing tragedy in there every now and then
<:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
Also, I didn't realize this but apparently there's like 17 LN volumes but we only have 6 in English so far.
👌
It's probably one of my more favorite volumes. I liked a lot of the stories in this one. Smol Elaina, the broom again, the cursed girl in the forest.
<:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
I finally finished Elaina vol 6 and now I have to wait until like January for the next one to release.
It has a game? Now that's interesting
Off-brand Love Live on ice
Idol ice hockey was good
<:CarolSmug:617040484111745027>
I wish, but my hopes aren't high at this point
<:HibikiGay:670494484701773845>
Hopefully, either that or ||It's gonna be something along the lines of him being about to confess but then deciding not to because of something like kukuru being too focused on her job||
||Although Kukuru is still having a lot of trouble at work, I'm glad she's at least getting a bit better. I like how she came to an understanding with Kaoru despite their earlier disagreements. She seems pretty cool and passionate about the marine life as well. Also, get out of here Kai, don't interrupt the yuri <:FuukaDisgust:863791717223235584> ||
This week's Aquatope was good <:CarolSmug:617040484111745027>
That's a nice emote Nova
<:KukuruBigSmile:863809995157274654>
Kukuru and Fuuka lookin good af in those dresses
xD
Hey now, there was a new song this episode!
Selection project has been nice so far. It's nothing too special, but still enjoyable nonetheless. Plus the songs are good <:ChrisDJ:690470897194369034>
||Kaoru is good <:CarolSmug:617040484111745027> ||
I don't think I've seen any Korean anime, but I have seen a few Chinese ones.
i wanna watch that one day, i remember hearing everyone talk about how it didnt make any sense and im curious
I think ep 1 aired but then it got delayed from what I heard. https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2021-10-07/world-end-harem-anime-episode-2-and-later-delayed-to-january/.178250
Idk about the last two but gorilla isekai is hot garbage and Selection project is fine but nothing too special so that's understandable.
That's a lotta dropped anime
xd
There's a handful that I started but haven't finished but there's only like one anime in my dropped catagory lol
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
I basically never drop anything so i can't relate
oof
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
If it's Isekai then I may have to give it a watch.
Is this something I've missed?
👀 👀 👀
Wait, Isekai you say?
<:MariaScared:672584661125431299>
not because they were bad or anything i just never got around to finishing them
both of those are series I only watched a few eps xd
idk there dont seem to be that many cute girls in there
<:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
rip I forgot there's no new anime I'm watching this season on Saturday
Oh right, that
Wait how did it start again, I forget
those are quite the tags
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
~~German is pretty cringe tbf~~
<:SerenaMunch:661660046370799697>
<:MariaScared:672584661125431299>
I feel like the space vampire anime is heading towards some real tragedy and i'm scared
Kampfer had a decent concept but man was the execution bad
https://myanimelist.net/anime/36943/Tachibanakan_Triangle maybe?
I mean, are there?
I can't really think of any ecchi stuff I've watched
I remember you mentioning that in the past.
your father seems cultured
<:HibikiFingerguns:688429715836502063>
You're not wrong
<:ChrisDJ:690470897194369034>
Plus the song is good
I'm not too familiar with this kinda stuff, but at least compared to some of the other 3d idol stuff i've seen it looked really good <:CarolSmug:617040484111745027>
I didn't even know there were Serbian dubs of anime. I mean, I guess I'm not too surprised, it's just not something I've ever come across.
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
Ah, it took me a sec to think of what you were talking about. Yep <:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
The gorilla waifu isekai is such hot trash, but i'm committed at this point to finish it
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
If they cover what I think they will then my hopes are high
<:MariaScared:672584661125431299>
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
Like more gay <:KukuruThumbsUp:853671530591944714>
Also, shame Ikxi, go watch Aquatope
Well its not like it's that hard to guess <:HibikiGay:670494484701773845>
Aquatope ep 16 ||I get that she has her own problems but that still doesn't excuse Chiyu from being a bitch <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>  Also, with all this child talk, it's a shame they didn't show us Kukuru and Fuuka having a kid <:HibikiGay:670494484701773845> ||
Good stuff
I remember reading the manga for this one
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
<:SetsuSparkle:802425458531893258>
Are they a different person depending on if they have glasses?
Why you gotta hurt me like that
<:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
<:YuuHeart:737647995750973481>
~~Now I just need someone to slap her song audio onto a video of Yu~~
<a:YuCheer:754740038994231346>
She's great, even more so because her VA is Yu from Nijigasaki
Suzune out here just chillin
I see a lot of girls there <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
<:MariaScared:672584661125431299>
Lank wtf is that
~~XDU anime when?~~
maybe i'll spend today actually finishing it
<:KanonYo:843630060283494410>
Apparently Love Live Superstar got a second season announced not too surprisingly.
That sounds pretty cool
Wait what
<:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
There's apparently like 17 LN volumes though only 6 are translated
There is one story in the LNs where she makes a mannequin of herself at one point
That's cute af
<:MikuBliss:336657233712513024>
but seeing the title of the next mushoku tensei ep and knowing whats coming, oh man we're in for quite the ep next time if it's what i think it is
<:HibikiFingerguns:688429715836502063>
I've already got enough of that
Also, ||Some of that foreshadowing <:MariaScared:672584661125431299> ||
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
This weeks Mushoku Tensei, Eris is looking cute as fuck
I'm glad there's some cultured individuals in here <:ChrisPray:672578403156885504>
I think the manga is over, but it's not all been TLed yet. It's getting to some good stuff 👌
👀
I mean honks is pretty iconic <:HonkBread:715458424854282370>
A well deserved loss, Saint Snow put out some bangers <:ChrisDJ:690470897194369034>
cursed
<:HonkEvil:749327484197142569>
The manga feels bizzare now, honks did Kendo for whatever reason lol
~~Umi~~
Shipping Riko/You and saint snows songs being bangers is basically all i got out of sunshine <:RikoOfCulture:749327484411183205>
<a:YuCheer:754740038994231346>
she's about to unhinge her jaw like a snake to eat that
I've only seen like half of superstar, but I doubt my opinion of her would change but who knows. I just find her super annoying <:KasuShrug:626072720404250669>
As much as I love niji, muse is just too iconic for me to not have at the best on my list. Though I haven't finished superstar so who knows <:KasuShrug:626072720404250669>
Those are some strong words <:AyumuKnife:690243842490105880>
<a:YuCheer:754740038994231346>
<:AyumuKnife:690243842490105880>
do they?
i dont think anyone does
<:CarolSmug:617040484111745027>
Seeing yuri in here is something nice to wake up to
~~300 year old lolis~~
~~Theres not enough Isekai if you ask me~~
There doesn't seem like much CGDCT next season sadly, but it looks like there's a bunch of Isekai and like 3 of em have female protags so there's that <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
I wonder what comfy CGDCT anime are coming up next season.
Ah, I'm not really familiar with that one
GFL?
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594> <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594> <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
CUTE GIRLS DOING GOLF
https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2021-10-25/yostar-pictures-kengo-saito-reveal-sorairo-utility-anime-about-golf/.178816
~~Im just out here waiting for the 11 Elaina volumes that aren't TLed yet~~
How quick do they release in English after the Japan release?
<:ChrisOi:586551700987576330>
Even then I'd probably watch it
They all look cute, I'm interested
Idols?
What is this
I see cute girls
👀
This looks super cursed
<:MariaScared:672584661125431299>
~~But what we really need is an anime~~
it was good <:CarolSmug:617040484111745027>
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
~~My attention span is too low to stay focused on reading a big book~~
It's just been sitting in my room for a couple months. I just haven't gotten around to it
Now I'm reminded that I still need to read vol 3 for IFTV
<:ChrisPray:672578403156885504>
<:MariaScared:672584661125431299>
OwO is this a garbage Isekai that I actually haven't seen?
<:CarolSmug:617040484111745027>
But yeah, good ep
He's got the right idea tho, I'd totally be down for that

<:wheeze:758563748172136478>
Sounds about right
<:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
The start of the new assassin isekai ep
Too bad there's no sequel for the anime that really need one ~~Like Comic Girls~~
~~Comic Girls Season 2 when~~
None of the VA's are people I'm familiar with but apparently one of the VAs voiced Tiki <:TikiPraise:672430544381935625>
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
Apparently it's Doga Kobo too
<@152896851660505088> what is this, I see a cute girl <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
👀 👀 👀
<:wheeze:837213179380891688>
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
There's a lot of stuff next year that i wanna watch
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
Speaking of things getting an anime, here's another isekai getting one https://twitter.com/kisimotokazuha/status/1453323570914869255 'Isekai Shoukan wa Nidome desu'
~~Guess I just gotta learn how to read moonrunes~~
Ah, they're doing Elaina. No wonder we're only at vol 6 there <:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
Based on the description of vol 3 it sounds like its behind the anime
<:HibikiThink:688429715362414641>
<:MariaScared:672584661125431299>
sulfuric acid is spooky stuff
I'm not following the manga, do you know of  its ahead of where the anime was?
I'd like to read the Bofuri LN at some point. I remember trying to read the WN at one point but the translation was awful.
Completely unrelated, but that's basically the way 'Even If It Was Just Once, I Regret It' starts. It's some nice gay manga <:HibikiGay:670494484701773845>
There's like 3 about motorbikes <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
Let's make books -> ~~Now we're doing social inequality, religious conflicts, and magic~~
At least due to the amount of isekai stuff getting adaptations it means that despite all of the garbage some good ones get adaptations too. <:HibikiFingerguns:688429715836502063>
I feel like so many are getting announced recently, not that im complaining
Well either way ~~Where can I buy it~~
<:KasuThink:626072736405389312>
Wait 40cm is pretty big isn't it?
<:YuuHyped:762379673816530984>
👀
I think I've read a bit of the manga for that. I've heard good things about it but I wasn't super interested
I've read the manga and a fair bit of the WN. I really enjoyed it but I do worry about the adaptation. I wasn't a huge fan of what I saw in the PV.
I know the English title
Which one is kenja deshi again
I forget if the other one was 2022, but next year is gonna be great
The fact that there were 2 girls doing golf anime announced like in the same week is hilarious though.
Cute girls doing golf <:CarolSmug:617040484111745027>
This week's Aquatope basically felt like a filler episode but at least there were a lot of nice gems from it
So at least that exists
Well, I'm also waiting on that last volume to be TLed too.
<:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
~~I'm still waiting for S3~~
Don't worry, they don't need practice. ||They're Rivals||
It's good
<:CarolSmug:617040484111745027>
I may watch an ep to see what the dub is like out of curiosity lol
Are the songs dubbed too?
<:YuuHeart:737647995750973481>
<:HibikiGay:670494484701773845>
I see girls
It also made me realize that i don't really care about the side characters. Suzune and Rena are basically the only ones im interested in lol
I can't say I was expecting that kind of performance for this week's Selection Project. <:ChrisDJ:690470897194369034>
<:HibikiGay:670494484701773845>
That one was pretty good

D:
I mean she hasn't shown herself to be too likeable tbf
<a:YuCheer:754740038994231346>
As it should be
Who's in first? I'm guessing Suzu or Rena
Ah
Where do you see the rankings
<:HibikiFingerguns:688429715836502063>
Well, I voted now
Voting?
True, ||It's not like they can't be idols just because they didn't win selection project.||
Fair point
||I'd be fine with Suzu and Rena winning but I don't really see *everyone* winning. But who knows. I'm also kinda curious how the others will react upon hearing the heart stuff||
Although with Rena, my guess is that ||We'll get the initial sadness/anger at Suzu for whatever reason(Not like it was her fault)/ then some big emotional reconciliation scene where the two end up becoming closer and bonding over Akari||
Though I do hear a lot of people comparing the two lol
I watched a couple eos but never finished
I should watch that at some point
But yeah when Rena finds out that'll be a scene
I wonder if Suzu actually knows. Because I can see a scenario where she doesn't realize and learns that fact from somewhere else.
Can't say this one was too surprising tho
Oh wow, I didn't even realize that was the reason
<:MariaScared:672584661125431299>
I saw a bunch of other people saying it already, but ~~Who's gonna do the railgun OP's now~~ <:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
OwO https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2021-10-31/voice-actress-yoshino-nanjo-to-leave-fripside-music-duo/.179055

Wait, Aoi Yuki is just playing every character?
This week's mushoku tensei ||Yep, that's about what I expected for the reunion scene. Rudy beating the hell outta Paul. Good stuff||
<:ChrisDJ:690470897194369034>
Plus the OP is an absolute banger
Good anime <:CarolSmug:617040484111745027>
Lank what is that I can't read moonrunes
~~How popular can it be if I haven't heard of it~~
Lank what's that
I literally don't remember a thing about her lol
Ah her
<:wheeze:837213179380891688>
Who
which feels like a rare thing these days now that i think about it
I think the LN is finished though
I've only read the manga
Mushoku Tensei
Norn is a girl
Eris is good
<:CarolSmug:617040484111745027>
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
~~Literally~~
👀

<:HibikiGay:670494484701773845>


Aquatope pls
It was way better than a show about horse girls had any right to be
S1 is good and all, but S2 is *really* good
<:YumiPoint:688429724103344164>
Yeah I doubt S2 will get to any of that kind of stuff since it's so far in the manga but who knows
Didn't the manga do some big reveal stuff already?
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
Can't say I expected that
Speaking of Season 2s, apparently Seirei Gensouki is getting one https://twitter.com/seireigensouki/status/1456561935722459143?s=20
<:CarolSmug:617040484111745027>
Wholesome anime
<:KirikaPog:605209108827734017>
OwO was that confirmed?
Same <:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
<:CarolSmug:617040484111745027>
Horse girls are good
After S2, it's gotta be Teio <:CarolSmug:617040484111745027>
Huh, Rika was You <:YouWow:749356046450950236> . Neiru was Setsuna <:SetsunaOfCulture:631576958735745034> . and Momoe was Yu <a:YuCheer:754740038994231346> . Interesting
wait they were?
Yu finally being an idol
<a:YuCheer:754740038994231346>
I only know her VA as
Ah
Anju?
I thought I signed up for ||Yu finally being an idol <a:YuCheer:754740038994231346>  not her suffering trying to be an idol <:YuuShocked:762379673572474960> ||
Alright, after finishing the Selection Project ep, ||Surprisingly I don't think they're going there. Her heart operation seems to be completely unrelated to Akari but who knows. Also tho, damn Suzune, poor girl. The after credit scene too <:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>  I feel so bad for her. Please give this girl a hug, she absolutely needs one.  Good on Rena though for being supportive as fuck. I wonder if we're gonna go the acceptance route of her embracing her scar or if she's still gonna cover it up/find another alternative. Either way tho, I wonder how she's gonna get those yells. My guess is that she's gonna get sympathy votes after telling her sob story which I sorta hope isnt the case because that feels kinda wrong.||
I just started the selection project ep and I can already see where this is going ||Swimsuit round, at first I thought it was just fanservice but then remembered Suzune's scar and her reluctance to change with others. We're totally going there aren't we. Heart of a dead idol inc?||
Twintails is quality culture man
~~Maybe because there's no Global~~
That
Ah
Did they have some other poor original anime last winter season or something?
||Nope, gotta have the character development||
ell
<:wheeze:758563748172136478>
tbf
6 eps in and I still don't care about most of em
Gotta introduce em all at some point <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
Teio!
I mean 👀
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
Isn't that just how it is for all of us irl tho anyway
Their big mistake was that they tried to have a plot <:wheeze:758563748172136478>
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
I wasn't a huge fan of this week's mushoku ep, but it was good. I prefer the more action-filled stuff
<:MariaScared:672584661125431299>
No lewding horses or the yakuza will get you
The TL for the first chapter of the last New Game volume released today. <:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
what the heck is that
I think before Ex-Arm it was the lowest rated actual anime on MAL.
The worst actual anime I've seen I think I'd give to Gibiate. That thing was a trainwreck
I honestly didn't think it was that bad tbh
OwO do I hear Isekai talk in here 👀 👀 👀
Wow, Isekai maou getting cheated there
Ah that bit
I haven't seen the ep but I've read the manga, but where is *here* supposed to be.
Live action Yu Yu Hakusho, what a bizzare  thing to exist
Oh god what
Yeah she's super good
Is that the gyaru horse
<:ChrisPray:672578403156885504>
After my hopes of it being gay were crushed, I was at least hoping for a good story.
Same
Yeah, it feels like we're spending the entire second half on "What does Kukuru want to do" except we're barely even focusing on that.
We could've ended after the first half and it would've pretty much been a complete story
Yeah, at least with the first half we had a solid event that the plot was centered around
Same
This week's Aquatope ||Tbh I'm not too interested in the Ruka stuff and I'd rather see more time be spent on Fuuka or Kukuru instead. But at least she seemed alright. Luckily no one really tried to push Fuuka back into idol stuff or question her motives to much and seemed professional about it. Props for Kukuru tho for sneaking out of her job to check on her girlfriend <:KarinSmug:878693517097050123>. I hope we get a scene of both of them watching the documentary together at some point.  Also, the baby penguin was cute af. I think we're gonna get a more Kukuru focused ep next week and I'm worried for her, she seems to be struggling. Hopefully it'll be a good outcome.||
<:KirikaPog:605209108827734017>
I don't think I really ever pay attention to studios. Doga Kobo is pretty much the only one I really remember
I barely even remember anything from citrus
Lank pls
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
<:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
Yeah, we already got the "You're like an older sister" line in the first half
I think that's a good way of putting it
I'm a few eps behind
I need to catch up on space vampire
New Mushoku ep was good <:CarolSmug:617040484111745027>  ||I forgot about the thing with Roxy and her village. Good stuff. I forget where Rudeus is going next though. I feel like there was a good few stories between him now and getting back home but I forget what they are.||
Im gonna watch it <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
<:KirikaPog:605209108827734017>
I watched one ep of that and noped the hell outta there
<:HibikiThink:688429715362414641>
oh shit that after credit scene
Oh man, ||I was gonna say that letter is totally gonna get to Rena and then we see it at the end. Yep. Time to see Rena's reaction next episode.||
Selection project new ep. oh god are we really doing this
yeah ima still watch it, but man its hot garbage lol
I think that fruit of evolution isekai airing this season might actually take the spot for the worst isekai anime i've seen. And that's saying something coming from me. It's just so damn bad <:KirikaDisgust:688431636043268097>
selfcest <:HibikiGay:670494484701773845>
<:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
You're not wrong, the yuri story doesn't involve Elaina sadly
This one actually is gay
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
Another addition to the Elaina collection
splatoon has a manga?
Panzer vor!
<:wheeze:837213179380891688>
Am I wrong tho
~~Iruma is best girl~~
Oh god now that's a name I haven't thought about in awhile
I barely read any LNs because for stuff like Isekai I can't really get into it usually without having visuals like manga/anime provide.
I read a chapter of the manga but then saw there was an anime adaptation coming so I didn't continue any further for executioner.
At least because there's so much Isekai stuff coming out some of the better ones are managing to get an adaptation due to the sheer quantity. So that's nice.
Bookworm doesn't even come to mind when I think of Isekai for me
One of these days I'll also figure out why torrents never work too lol
One of these days I'll get around to watching that anime
For some reason her having two bows like that feels weird to me lol
Railgun <:KirikaPog:605209108827734017>
I never understood the love for that one I see a lot of people have. I thought S1 was just absolute trash
Next season has a bunch of stuff I'm looking forward to tho <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
most of this season for me is "Yeah this is alright but nothing too special"
irina is probably the only thing im watching that's stood out a bit so far. Though i am a few episodes behind in it
nothing has really stood out for me this season
<:wheeze:758563748172136478>
This week's bit with the goddess was hilarious
Ah, ecchi stuff. Rip
What is this, it looks cool
Idk what kinda intentions or backstory they're gonna give him. There's no redemption in my eyes
We need more happy Kukuru
relatable
<:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
<:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
i just finished the aquatope ep, Poor kukuru
I'm only vaguely familiar with the source but that looks cool af
Just finished Selection Project. Yep. That's about how i expected that to go
Oh right that airs today. Gotta watch it when I get home
There's a Yuri in there I don't recognize 👀 👀 👀
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
maybe ill wait until it has a few more chapters then check it out
<:HibikiGay:670494484701773845>
Granted ive only seen half the superstar eps, I disliked Keke from the beginning and that view hasn't changed
<:UmiScared:883342645336866886>
also nova thats a cursed emote what the fuck
I was shocked when i first heard her lmao
<a:YuCheer:754740038994231346>
I would read it, but then im just gonna be left feeling sad that theres only like 3 chapters and releases are slow it seems
Is this gay?
👀
What's that
<:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
That looks cool af, but it's also spooky <:MariaScared:672584661125431299>
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>

Damn not yuri
Now there's an idea
Kukuru <:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
Basically my thoughts when i see people talking about literally any mecha stuff <:Ver:704169051391524875>
I'm only barely familiar with it but i've heard good things so i'm excited
<:KirikaPog:605209108827734017>
Does that one even have a release date yet
Rip we didn't get a scene with the goddess in this weeks assassin isekai
my man just wants to build robots, advancing technology by decades is just a means to that <:Ver:704169051391524875>
Looking through all the stuff i've watched this year i might agree with that too tbh
||Someone's gonna be hurting no matter what so would you rather see more kukuru suffering or some pengiun violence? Pick your poison||
<:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
<:KukuruThumbsUp:853671530591944714>
kukuru was happy with it tho and it was adorable
its only in the op now isnt it
I did work today, but I'm watching it at home since I got off early <:HibikiFingerguns:688429715836502063>
We've only got a few episodes left and I still have no clue where the hell Aquatope is going. Good episode though this week ||Kukuru running away to escape from the stress of work is a mood. Good on Fuuka for running after her wife immediately when she found out where Kukuru was. The sea turtle scene was cool as hell, watching all of em waddle to the sea was a really nice scene. I'm sure there's some symbolism somewhere there but I don't care enough to think about it.||
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
That's an adaptation I didn't expect but am looking forward to
<:KirikaPog:605209108827734017>
true
it makes me wonder how they went down in the ln a bit
yeah i remember hearing that some parts were hugely compressed
At least there's also the manga too which is pretty cool since it has some of the stories that weren't in the anime.
Better yet just gimme another season
Speaking of Elaina, I wish the LNs would release faster <:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
Yeah
At least in the LNs I feel like Elaina is getting a bit better about being less self-centered. Just a little tho
<:KukuruBigSmile:863809995157274654>
Pls no, make it stop
<:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970> <:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970> <:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
<:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
<:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
oh god more precure, *Cries thinking about AMQ*
yeah it's definitely got a lot of problems
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
StrikerS is my personal favorite of the Nanoha stuff
s2 coming in 2121 <:KirikaPog:605209108827734017>
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
Go for it Ikxi!
<:KirikaPog:605209108827734017>
go apply Ikxi, help us get more rocks suffering
👀
<:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
Nooo poor Vivio
yeah even if they split up theyre gonna get back together i imagine
The ED for example is sung by "9-tie" which i mean cmon
I'm fully expecting em all to stay at this point tbh
Just finished the selection project ep, ||I can't say I expected Rena to come to terms with Suzune having Akari's heart that quick only to then become lost and demotivated right after. I thought Rena was just gonna straight up say she was dropping out in that interview which i'm glad didnt happen. I'm gonna guess that they're all gonna vote for themselves since we saw them actually voting in the aftercredits. I wonder what'll happen if they do.||
<:MariaScared:672584661125431299>
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
~~I'm just waiting for New Game S3~~
<:YumiPoint:688429724103344164>
I didn't even know there was a dub
<:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
wait how much is the minimum in germany?
<:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
I need to watch that one one day, I've seen a few clips from it and it looks gay af <:HibikiGay:670494484701773845>
<a:STrickKiss:411002217659760640>
Sakura Trick is the first thing that comes to mind for "Very gay" <:HibikiGay:670494484701773845>
<:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
Which is sad if you can't understand Japanese because LNs are slow to get translated usually but anime basically always get subbed. (Though yeah I know English speakers aren't really the target audience)
Don't hurt my precious isekai like that
<:ChrisOi:586551700987576330>
Oh shit I think we're finally gonna get to the part I've been looking forward to in next weeks Mushoku Tensei
Well if it's the same world then it means you've got the knowledge of people, places, events, etc. That you can use. But if it's different entirely or in the future than the MC doesn't have that.
But yeah I forget if she's reborn into a different world, or if it was an alternate version of her world, or her world but in the future. Its been awhile since I've read it.
Re: library is good 👌👌
Its not Isekai is it?
Yeah
Not really, the closest we get (as far as I know) is some skinship between the MC and her sister here and there.
That thing I was posting about yesterday I think is getting an anime
Oh shit https://twitter.com/HJbunko/status/1465259241539661825
I remember I watched a few eps but didn't finish it.
I don't watch much these days tbf
I remember you recommending that one when it was airing
The manga 'even if it was just once i regret it' might fit. I'm sure I've read other manga that would work but I can't think of anything atm.
<:CarolSmug:617040484111745027>
Maybe I'll check out mdex again but the last time I visited I was left confused <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
I did and I liked the mangadex tracking, but then after their whole mess the UI there is <:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
I need to figure out a better way to track all the random manga I read
<:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
Yeah but if it's good then I'll be left wanting more and get sad because there isn't any more
I wanna read that but idk if I'd want to start it if there's only one chapter so far
Now there's a good idea
<:KirikaDisgust:688431636043268097>
I'm always down for more "Cute girls doing *Insert sport here*"
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
Aren't there two cute girl golf anime
Cute girl anime <:CarolSmug:617040484111745027>
Sounds like something I'd read
<:HibikiThink:688429715362414641>
I may end up rewatching it before S2, as a little refresher and because i absolutely loved it
<:KukuruGasp:863809996022218772>
After how insanely hype the movie was I've got high expectations
xD
I was just thinking "*That's not what I remember Riko looking like*"
That's what I thought but just wanted to double check lol
Also, did I just forget something and  I was supposed to know what was going on in that trailer? Or is it mostly stuff I'm not supposed to understand.
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594> <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594> <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
Looking through the stuff that's coming up next season and what I'm gonna watch, I'm surprised that it seems to be a pretty even balance of Fantasy/Isekai/CGDCT. I would've expected there to be a lot more of one or another.
I was looking through some Made in Abyss stuff since I was reminded of it yesterday and man, I forgot how much the OST just absolutely fucking slaps. 10/10 good shit
Protecc indeed
<:HibikiFingerguns:688429715836502063>
Comic Girls
Yeah but it's a spinoff and those tend to be cute
Looks cute, is it cute Ikxi?
Oh rip I clicked that, well I figured that would happen anyway so <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
Or the more realistic option none of us want ~~*She gets married with Kai*~~
<:KukuruShocked:863748137864265728>
there's like 2 eps left and they keep adding more plot threads, I still have no clue where the hell Aquatope is going
AHHHHHHH Aquatope pls
Just started the Aquatope ep, damn we really gonna begin like that
But also <:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
If that one is the one I think it is then it's been really good so far
Index <:MariaScared:672584661125431299>
I'm just chillin in the empty movie theater because I arrived to early now
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
Its it bad Lank?
About to go see that new SAO movie
No wonder I don't know what it is
Ah, I haven't even seen any of those
<:HibikiThink:688429715362414641>
Kaginado?
Cute idol girls and a decent story
Selection Project is probably my favorite thing this season (though tbf I'm not watching much this season)
Yeah, the story is super predictable, but even with that it's still told well
Also, a bunch of the people in the r/anime discussion thread mentioned it but ||Suzune telling Rena that she already has all the Akari merch is adorable||
Good stuff 👌
So I just watched the Selection Project ep, ||Damn I really didn't expect them to go through with just fucking disqualifying all of them. Bold move on the part of the production people. Though it's not really unexpected that they all got together anyway, I do like how Rena was hesitant still to join and how they dealt with that. Plus we got some super cute Rena smiles this ep because of it. Good stuff though, I only wonder how they're gonna fill 3 more eps. I assume with the after credit scene that they were hinting at the production people getting involved with them again somehow.||
There was also another movie announced for 2022 which I guess is gonna continue the story
Overall though I enjoyed it, it was basically floor 1 retold through Asunas perspective.
An unexpected surprise
<:CarolSmug:617040484111745027>
Speaking of the new character introduced in the sao movie, she was voiced by Inori Minase
Aquatope pls
Sameeee
I guess I'll see how it is in a bit <:HibikiFingerguns:688429715836502063>
Don't worry Cypher, I can't judge Index too much. The only thing I can critique is like half of the first season because that's all I watched before I found it too boring to continue further.
~~Yet another reason Sakura Trick is the greatest Yuri anime~~
I hope we get a good explicitly Yuri anime at some point. As far as I know there's nothing coming up anytime soon <:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
Sakura Trick has all of em, ez solution
<:CarolSmug:617040484111745027>
I get that
I was expecting adachi and shimamura to be a *lot* more gay than it actually was considering all I had heard about it leading up to it being aired. Only to be disappointed with what it actually was
<:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
I guess my net is a lot more narrow, I'm generally only really interested in something as Yuri if there's at least like clear efforts by one of them to try and establish a relationship or at the very least clearly express their interest.
I feel like a lot of the time I hear that something is Yuri, but when it actually airs there's barely anything at all.
Yeah I know
Other?
Is it actually Yuri tho
That's a real good one
<:ChrisPray:672578403156885504>
Its not like there's anything bad about stuff being slow burns, but I often feel like when that "slow burn" part of the story is the *entire story* then it's a bit unfulfilling.
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
Slow burn stuff just isn't for me I guess, if it goes that long and there's still nothing going on then I don't even really consider it Yuri at that point.
I've only seen the anime, but considering it was like 12 episodes and literally nothing happened between them what's the point in it even being yuri
<:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
Does anything even happen in the LN
Glacially slow
Ngl
I remember practically nothing from Citrus
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
Fine, I guess Citrus may count too Millhi
<:sweaty:839235693699661834>
I've only read the manga but damn
Yep
👌
Oh man that Mushoku Tensei ep. This is the one I've been waiting all season for. That's some good shit right there
<:YuTPose:754383071997984818>
I like red haired girl, she's super cute
<:HibikiThink:688429715362414641>
whats this, idol?
👀
<:ChrisBang:702166093065748500>
yeah
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
<:sweaty:839235693699661834>
she protecc Rani tho
true xd
she protecc and she attac
her facial expressions are gold
Poor girl
What comes right after that is great
At the very least she doesn't have any interest in men, so there's a chance
We do get this tho at least
From what I remember ||It's not Yuri <:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>||
I read a fair bit but stopped after awhile
I should catch back up on that novel, it was good stuff 👌
Wait are they not? I honestly don't remember
Calm down that's her sister
<:wheeze:837213179380891688>
She's a battle junkie and it's absolutely great
Right reaction indeed
<:CarolSmug:617040484111745027>
Good stuff tho 👌
I forgot the baby stuff from there
Ah that one
What is this from Iski?
<:FudouEyes:672846284725682195>
<:KirikaPog:605209108827734017>
I'm waiting til they're all out then I'm gonna treat it like a S2 and binge it
Crown Handler I assume
Apparently 3Hz did Rifle is Beautiful too. I had no idea
the only thing i know about monogatari is that there's a lot of em and that bakemonogatari has that meme op
🪥
<:MariaScared:672584661125431299>
I mean Code Geass has the table scene
🏴‍☠️
Sakura Trick <:HibikiGay:670494484701773845>
With how good the anime has been and how much I've enjoyed the manga I think I may actually give the LN a read at some point.
Easily the top episode of anything I've seen this season
I forget how far I read for that one but I should catch up at some point
<:CarolSmug:617040484111745027>
Guess I just read the gay ones then <:HibikiGay:670494484701773845>
Genderbend
That's how most gb stuff I've read is
I'd be pretty shocked if they did go that route.
The only reason I'd watch it early is if it gets a showing in theaters. Then I'd probably catch up so I could see it there
~~Anime adaptation when~~
<:KukuruEh:829126576532750387>
<:KukuruBigSmile:863809995157274654>
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
i like how so many are madoka lol
"Handsome Girl and Sheltered Girl" comes to mind as being sorta similar but it's been awhile since I've read that one so I forgot a lot of the early parts. I can't really think of much else off the top of my head tho
Yeah I absolutely love that one, the start is slightly sketch but it becomes super wholesome. And it's a finished story too
Ahh that one
Which one?
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
Is Wall-D like Initial D?
I mean, when you think about it, that's a good point.
Bofuri <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
nice
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
dang
is it a goddess scene?
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
This week's assassin isekai ep is already looking promising
Indeed
<:CarolSmug:617040484111745027>
More cute girls for next season <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594> <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594> <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
It's only a short anime but https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2021-12-10/irodorimidori-anime-reveals-staff-january-5-premiere/.180479
<:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
If you really want the spoiler
<:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
||Hinting at that yeah <:MariaScared:672584661125431299> ||
New Selection Project ep. ||Oh god that after credits scene, nononono. Pls don't hurt Suzune like that||
That was an interesting Aquatope ep, ||That ending though, HANDHOLDING <:MikuBliss:336657233712513024> Going through that ep though I guess wasn't too unexpected considering how we saw Fuuka getting interested in environmental issues recently and Kukuru doubting going to be an attendant. I wonder if we're gonna get a timeskip for the last ep or if it's just gonna be them parting ways and leaving us with a cliffhanger or just a vague reunion scene after a timeskip at the end. That sister-zoning though, rip chances for Yuri, but i'm still hoping anyway.||
I just got out of work so I'll probably do that when I get home
I forgot Aquatope was even today
👀
oh yeah those images are a thing arent they
not wrong tho
<:wheeze:758563748172136478>
anime is just manga, but played really fast
Yeah then i basically remember none of it
I wonder if this part has been covered in the manga, I feel like I super vaguely remember it, but I can't recall. Either way its gonna be new stuff to me so I'm excited to see where they go with it.
Damn that's quite the ending, both before and after the credits
I think I've heard of that one, but surprisingly it's not something I've read.
I feel like VA's getting replaced is a super uncommon thing. He fit the role so well i find it hard to imagine who's gonna be the replacement.
I saw that, I wonder how it's gonna impact S2. I'm guessing delayed or worst case cancelled.
Well usually Web Novel/Light Novels/Manga aren't translated into English that much. (Or have awful basically unreadable translation) Anime basically always get TLed at least.
<:HibikiThink:688429715362414641>
Ah
Isn't the LN completed?
I didn't realize either until I saw people in the discussion thread talking about it
<:CarolSmug:617040484111745027>
Apparently all the 'Turning Point' s are really good and so far that's been the case
I've been waiting for that scene this whole time and man did they deliver
Right!
There was some actual plot development in this weeks Isekai Shokudou, now that was unexpected. <:KirikaPog:605209108827734017>
<:ChrisPray:672578403156885504>
It wasn't bad by any means, it just didn't really have anything that made it stand out among all the isekai stuff i consume.
I've read the manga too <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>  I guess the appeal just isn't really there for me. I have heard others praise it tho
ah that one, tbh I didn't really see anything special. It just felt like the average isekai to me
<:HibikiThink:688429715362414641>
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
If it's not isekai then its gonna have to be pretty good to make me watch a male protag
👀
isekai is pog so it gets a free pass for male protags from me
There are also some good isekai with female protags too tbf
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
Male protag
I'll probably end up at least giving it a shot tho
Reading that, tbh it doesn't sound like something I'd be really into
<a:AzuPeek:734138749956653096>
I saw that one earlier. That art looks like something i'd be interested in, but the description wasn't what I was expecting sadly. I may give it a shot when it eventually airs tho
<:KirikaPog:605209108827734017>
I don't think I've seen any of their works, but hey more anime
<:ChrisPray:672578403156885504>
<:ChrisPray:672578403156885504>
https://twitter.com/discotekmedia/status/1469443935592275970 Discotek Day is coming up in a couple days, pls gimme Symphogear GX
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
*Most of the anime I watch*
I was gonna say i dont even know any of those but then saw gen
<:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
Today's Mushoku Tensei ep, oof
I've heard good things about that one, maybe I'll watch it one day
Ah, so you have to buy them together?
Omnibuses?
With some stuff I've noticed that the earlier volumes (I guess might not be in print anymore or something) will have the prices raised which kinda sucks if I'm looking to start reading it.
thats not too bad
I feel like these days i'm more open to buying LNs for stuff i really like, as long as they're available and not outrageously priced.
*Buying lns* <:HibikiThink:688429715362414641>
I see, interesting
Too bad it didn't feel like that in the anime <:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
👀
I see
Ah
That sounds odd, isn't the LN usually way ahead of the manga for most stuff?
Well, I certainly didn't see that when I watched the anime <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
My problem with otherside picnic was that before the anime aired basically the only thing I had really heard was that it was Yuri, only to watch it and be disappointed.
I feel like whenever I hear things are gay I gotta tone down my expectations. Because it never ends up being nearly to the level I think it is <:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
I can't think of any off the top of my head
<:CarolSmug:617040484111745027>
there is gonna be an ova tho which iirc is gonna be eris's perspective, though not for this, during one of the earlier eps
yep, 1 ep left
Next episode is probably gonna be setting up all the stuff for next season so I imagine we'll get a bit of it. Either that or we'll get it a bit later during some of the stuff next season.
||I think she still would've left imo||
Yeah, ||You almost forget that Rujerd has to leave because he's been there for so long. Eris leaving is a shocker since you would expect her to stay with Rudy after all they just went through.||
<:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
Oh right
A bunch of people pointed out in the discussion thread that ||This is the first time we actually see Rudeus cry, which makes it even more sad||
Yep
Ah
Which part
<:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
<:GenjuroThumbsUp:336657189475188740>
A good question
Any gay romance?
ah, im a handful of chapters behind
did they?
Wonder Egg had a great like 6 eps then went downhill from there yeah
yeah tbh i may give it to uma musume
Looking through the stuff i've watched for 2021, nothing really stands out too much for me tbh
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
~~I didn't watch 86 or Vivy so idk~~
New Mushoku Tensei manga chapter (77) dropping some wild content 👀 👀 👀
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
Something actually good? ~~So more isekai?~~
Nope <:HibikiFingerguns:688429715836502063>
that reminds me i still need to watch that one, maybe ill do it tomorrow
150 chapters? damn
👀
Well, Aquatope is finally over
ah that one, good stuff
I'm surprised it wasn't the usual Wcdonalds
man Sayaka lookin jealous af at Yuu and Touko
<:HibikiFingerguns:688429715836502063>
Well, time to continue watching YagaKimi i guess
Also, I just realized this was for Bocchi the Rock. I'm looking forward to that one <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
||Just have her perform, then she can die and her heart can go to another idol wannabe perpetuating the  cycle||
||Dorm mom "I chose this position so I could watch over and take care of the girls so something like Akari wouldn't happen again" *Immediately lets a girl who passed out from overwork go perform as soon as she wakes up* -_-||
Well, that was an episode, so next time are we gonna see ||Suzune and Akari in her dream world I guess? Even if she does wake up, wouldn't it still take a bunch of time for her to actually get to the recording location and get dressed up, makeup, etc. Plus are they really gonna let a girl with a heart condiiton who just passed out from overwork go perform as an idol immediately after she wakes up? Like, cmon that's just reckless. ||
wait wait wait, ||The dorm mom was the CEO?! Were we supposed to realize that last episode when we saw her and I just didn't notice?||
Yep, there it is
I know where this is going and i dont like it
I don't like where we're starting off <:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
I just started the ep <:MariaScared:672584661125431299>
~~Basically my reaction so far watching these episodes~~
I really like Yuu's VA so far
<:HibikiGay:670494484701773845>
So I watched the first ep of YagaKimi, this is looking gay as fuck, *I'm interested*
I feel like I know basically nothing about Yagakimi except that I've seen some super cute fanart.
I should watch that one
<:HibikiGay:670494484701773845> <:HibikiGay:670494484701773845> <:HibikiGay:670494484701773845>
I ended up reading the YagaKimi manga after i finished the anime
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
Finished YagaKimi, that's some good stuff right there
<:ChrisDJ:690470897194369034>
man the yagakimi ED is a banger
<:wheeze:758563748172136478>
ye
i remember seeing it when i was browsing stuff coming up, but i have no clue what its about
Looks cute
Honestly I maintain that it could've ended after the first cour and we wouldn't have lost much.
Can't wait to look forward to the next yuri-bait anime
<:ChrisPray:672578403156885504>
Sounds pretty neat
What's this about?
👀
<@161155855524298752> Random topic: You recommended 'Girls Kingdom' months ago and I finally got around to reading it a bit. Good stuff so far 👌
Yeah if I remember right that one was actually pretty good
<:CarolSmug:617040484111745027>
<:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
Just give 7 Isekai *and* 7 cgdct
https://anilist.co/anime/134252/Fantasy-Bishoujo-Juniku-Ojisan-to/
ah
unless there's a decent one out there now
yeah the wn i saw had absolutely awful TL's
👀
Mob Otome is well.......
I'd never heard of Bofuri before the anime came, but the anime was an absolute blast. An OSO adaptation would be neat tho
well next season, you know what i mean
we've got 2 this season interestingly enough
I really liked the story for Kenja no Deshi but I have concerns for the quality of the adaptation.
there also aren't many manga chapters for it, but from what i have seen it's lookin pretty good. Plus isekai with female MC's are rare
I've heard good things about leadale
<:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
Get some more isekai on that list you coward
At least from the stuff that i've looked at, I'll probably be watching more than I did this season. All the isekai/fantasy stuff i'm interested in (like 7 anime) I'm already familiar with the source so i know they'll be pretty good. Then there's cgdct stuff (like 3 anime) which is basically always good
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
All the anime for this season is ending, time to look forward to next season it seems
I could absolutely see a cgdct for bowling releasing at some point
<:TsubasaBliss:672861879000891432>
The absolutely precious MC is adorable too tho
<:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
I really like the S & M pair
I'm nearly done with the second volume <:CarolSmug:617040484111745027>
Neat
Oh hey robots
Aren't all names made up though <:HibikiThink:688429715362414641>
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
There are a lot of languages that seem made up, like Polish for example.
I should watch shadows house at some point. I remember hearing good things about it. The only thing I know about it is that the ED is a banger.
Well, there's still lewd scenes there, but yeah not nearly as bad
i remember a lot from vivid strike, but thats because i watched it not that long ago. I saw that clip and went to watch the anime lol
<:MariaScared:672584661125431299>
The only thing i can think of when you mention bullying is the scene in Vivid Strike
and setting up for next season
tying up all the loose ends
<:CarolSmug:617040484111745027>
Though tbh I'm basically certain it's gonna get one at some point
Yeah sadly no s2 announcement
The MC just really fucking loves robots, good stuff 👌
It was bad enough that even *I* don't want to watch it anymore. And that's saying something considering all the isekai I consume.
<:HibikiThink:688429715362414641>
I never understood the appeal for that one. S1 just felt like an absolute disaster to me
So I've heard
It makes me actually wanna watch the anime because it's so good lol
Shadows house ed is an absolute banger
Guess I'll add it to the list of things I say I'll watch eventually but probably will never get around to.
Goddess is the best character
Idk, apparently it's popular enough to have like 3 seasons or something but I don't get it at all. I thought it was absolute trash, guess it just wasn't for me.
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
<:KirikaDisgust:688431636043268097>
I remember seeing this on anilist but this is the first video of it I've seen <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594> <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594> <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
yeah 248
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
The newest Kaguya-Sama chapter
<:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
Plus, ~~I'm still recovering from the end of the anime~~, can I really handle whatever the hell comes after that
Oh hey, you got summoned by the munou na nana talk xD
I really wanna read that, but I wanna wait til its finished because I just know that if I read it now I'm gonna be left with some wild cliffhangers and I can't handle that xd
<:wheeze:758563748172136478>
Oh right, i forget thats idol lol
wait what other sports idol anime was there
10/10 episode
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
||Rudy meeting Orsted||?
I think it makes sense, ||Ruijerd has his own stuff to go do especially with improving the reputation of the Superd and his journey with Rudy is over.||
i remember reading the manga for free life fantasy, good stuff 👌
Sounds like something I'd read <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
S2 P2 where they spent a solid like 6 episodes on nothing but exposition
very true
i wonder if it's partially a quantity thing too. I feel like BL stuff is more common than GL stuff, but maybe i'm wrong there. So it feels like they go places quicker because there's just more of them in general
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
~~YagaKimi got there in chapter 1~~
<:9_PressXtoDoubt:771344715437834261>
Don't remind me
<:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
I can't handle waiting for more chapters after whatever cliffhangers its probably gonna leave
Like I said, I feel like I don't wanna read that one until its over.
<:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
And with that all the stuff I'm watching this season is over.
Finished Selection Project, Not too surprising of an ending
Oh right that's today, I'll watch it when I get home
Someone's started TLing it I see
<:KirikaPog:605209108827734017>
Wait, is the WN translated somewhere?
The description doesn't sound too bad
👀 Is this something I should add to my list of things to read?
Not the kind of gay I meant
<:ShirabeStare:582381430915596289>
Quality content
Yeah that
I know there's one about voice actors that basically does that and has some idol stuff in there.
I want some gay anime, are there even any coming up in the next few seasons?
Idk, there's a lotta wholesome villainess out there
I've heard of that but haven't read it, it sounds super up my alley though
honestly though we really do need a s2, the manga gets so much more gay its great
Isn't that just Princess Principal xd
<:MikuDelete:661660028410920990>
<:HibikiThink:688429715362414641>
I mean AinCiel is basically on hiatus with how busy Lyly is these days Ikxi
<:ChrisOi:586551700987576330>
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
~~At least an NFT has some inherent value~~
<:HibikiFingerguns:688429715836502063>
in the trash where it belongs
thats quite the video
I'm not really familiar with them, is there a list of all the stuff they had licensed that are dead now? (Unless someone else gets it I guess)
one day ill read the manga, i've heard its just ***Suffering***
ill throw it on the list
looks like something id watch
<:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
I want something with actual physical intimacy though which is what disappointed me with Adachi.
I desperately want another really gay yuri anime, I feel like there hasn't really been one in awhile
<:HibikiGay:670494484701773845>

<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
I watched half of Index S1 and was so bored I couldn't continue.
I don't really feel like there was anything hard to understand having only watched railgun <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
<:HonkBread:715458424854282370>
Just watch Selection Project for an idol battle royale ~~Though not really~~
I remember watching like 4 eps of that but never got around to continuing it. One of these days I'll pick it back up, I enjoyed it a lot.
Makes sense
Panzer vor!
Isn't anything better than Aqours though <:Ver:704169051391524875>
does the 4th one even have a release date
<:MariaScared:672584661125431299>
Yeah at least during S1 and G
Actually, now that I think about it, wouldn't Tsubasa technically be a school idol?
<:TsubasaAngry:692141154531016765>
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>  She made a phone call so who knows
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
Wait, why does the phone number have letters in it
Maria's VA is in there too but i don't really hear the similarity that much with her
<:MikuPraise:585839808765493249>
I'm rewatching some Yama no Susume and all I can hear is Miku since the MC is voiced by Yuka Iguchi
Last chapter (179) dropped today
Yep
<:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
Solo Leveling is finally over, what a ride that was.
<:wakarimasu:476452770682241062>
Idk what that is <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
What we really need are big titty Yuri harems
👀  i see two cute girls
nooo how is GuP gonna leave me with that cliffhanger
I'm watching it now and i'm shocked how high quality this animation is
<:HibikiFingerguns:688429715836502063>
good thing i didnt watch it last night then
but then again i barely understood the anime so would i even understand the movie
i should watch that
oh right thats a thing
damn thats a solid drawing
the real demon was the friends we made along the way
i guess the order thing was more about the movie apparently being after s2 i think
that was quite the unexpected development
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
Like i have 0 clue how the fuck magic works at all despite having watched like 40 episodes and a movie lmao
I feel like the anime doesn't explain how anything works and since everything is apparently out of order it makes it even more confusing.
Mahouka is just <:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
~~I'm still waiting on Comic Girls S2~~
OVA was good <:CarolSmug:617040484111745027>
i didnt realize <:KirikaPog:605209108827734017>
oh there was more
hmm?
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
So is it gonna be an adaptation where if I want anything I gotta read it <:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
I'm just questioning the Yuri aspect. Like, sure I've heard it's Yuri, but I also got told that about Otherside for example which ended up having nothing.
I'm looking forward to that one but I'm skeptical
I thought it was, but all I'm seeing googling around is just "2022"
I forget, wasn't Slow Loop cute girls doing fishing or something?
I thought it was an actual anime
Oh it was a one off? Rip
I didn't realize sorairo utility had aired already, wasnt that a cute girls doing sports one?
Now that winter season stuff is starting 👌
Now gimme cute girls doing that
<@!161155855524298752> Btw Executioner is apparently Spring 2022 and it looks pretty pog https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vG4X3HPmmEg
Nova out here dropping idol lore as usual
I only know that name from the assault lily OP
What is this
Same, isekai is always good but cute girl slice of life isekai is a nice change of pace from the usual
I wouldn't have expected that one
<:KirikaPog:605209108827734017> <:KirikaPog:605209108827734017> <:KirikaPog:605209108827734017>
<:CarolSmug:617040484111745027>
It was really nice indeed
I don't think I've even looked at my plan to watch list in awhile
I'll put it on the list of "Things I'll watch *eventually* I say knowing full well it'll probably be months at best before I get around to it"
Like the general idea sure, but the last few eps <:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
But if asked if I understood it, I'd say not really
Yeah
I feel like before I watch the movie I gotta find some YouTube video to explain the anime so I know what's going on lol.
On a scale of 1 to 10 with 1 being smol brain and 10 being Galaxy brain. How much iq do I need to understand the movie?
i can only think of like 1 anime character named minami lol
Sorairo Utility was actually super cute, man I wish that was a full anime because Minami was absolutely precious
Rip, hopefully someone subs it
Anyone happen to know if ep 1 of 'Irodorimidori' is available anywhere? https://anilist.co/anime/140950/Irodorimidori/
It does <:CarolSmug:617040484111745027>
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594> <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594> <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
Leadale starts today, time for some Isekai
If that's the manga I think it is 👀
maple gonna transform into an even more horrifying abomination
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
Bofuri s2 gonna be great
I've heard good things about leadale and have enjoyed what ive read in the manga so far
Just looking through 2022 isekai at a glance on anilist: Bofuri (kinda isekai i guess), pupil of the wiseman (genderbent), bookworm, Leadale, Fantasy bishoujo (genderbent), executioner.
Cmon now that's a good one
There's also like 2 isekais with a genderbent protag this season (If you can really consider that as a female protag lol)
<:CarolSmug:617040484111745027>
I feel like we're seeing more isekai anime with female protags these days and its nice
<a:HibikiCheer:620778132257112103>
Can we just get a Sakura Trick S2 already, I feel like it's been awhile since there's been a good yuri anime
If there's not at least one girl clearly expressing romantic interest in another girl at the bare minimum  (Even if she's just thinking it rather than verbalizing it) then personally I don't really consider it Yuri. everyones got their own standards tho
Sadly I don't have any hopes for yuri, but even still i'm excited
Definitely looks super cool tho
Also, knowing nothing about it but the general premise and seeing that PV, I'm assuming that Menou totally has a super fucked up past <:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
its not an anime
That one is certainly something
Her Majesty's Swarm?
I'm looking forward to the reincarnated as a sword adaptation, Fran is 10/10
👀
<:ChrisOi:586551700987576330>
<:HibikiFingerguns:688429715836502063>
Isekai is always fun!
Yeah some of the animation is kinda weird
<a:ChrisBaka:670628703734333450>
I can't even imagine what that could possibly mean
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
All the martial arts stuff is a big one for example
It definitely feels like there's a lot more worse TLed Chinese stuff than Japanese stuff. But I imagine that's also partially due to all the various terminology used in Chinese stuff that's hard translate or explain .
Well I read a bit of that genre too, (though a lot of it is hot garbage lol)
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
Villainess? Yuri? Isekai? That's checking all the boxes of stuff I'm interested in
<:MikuPraise:585839808765493249>
Panzer vor!
idk, ive already completed one anime this season
<:wheeze:758563748172136478>
<:CarolSmug:617040484111745027>
now i kinda wanna watch it lol
D:
just a difference in some spacing
oop
https://mangadex.org/title/fd41659a-e4ce-458f-b087-8032b7a5fab9/neta-chara-tensei-toka-anmarida
"Neta Chara Tensei To Ka Anmari Da!"
There are quite a few where it doesn't really matter and the mc immediately moves on lol
I feel like Female -> Male is much less common than the opposite but im sure theres plenty out there
But "Do genderbent characters count as female" is a whole topic in itself lol
I'd say so
👀
<:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
If only someone would TL the rest of it
<:MariaSmile:688836869550768233>
Yoko Hikasa is also in there
yeah i thought it was later too
cute girls trying to be seiyuus
<:CarolSmug:617040484111745027>
The first ep of CUE! was really cute, though they introduced like 20 characters and i dont remember any of them lol
<:ChrisPray:672578403156885504>
Now you can join me in praying that someone TLs the rest of the chapters.
She's fuckin pissed
I feel like there was some other Isekai I read a long time ago that had a similar idea
but yeah looks monthly
<:ChrisPray:672578403156885504>
There's 12 chapters in the raws apparently so maybe someone will actually pick it up and TL them one day
But the content there that is there is pog
Sadly there's not too many of them <:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
Its funny how there's two of those this season lmao
Wait it's gonna have 24 eps
Her legs are shiny
https://anilist.co/anime/109019/Diary-of-Our-Days-at-the-Breakwater/
didnt the other fishing cgdct a few seasons ago show them?
Idk, its not yuri so that's quite a few demerits from me already
else thats one hell of a coincidence
they even air right after eachother? That's gotta be planned lol
wait
'Fantasy Bishoujo Juniku Ojisan to' 'Kenja no Deshi wo Nanoru Kenja'
<:HibikiFingerguns:688429715836502063>
who needs to look at a source anyway, I'll know when it comes out when i see it released
i had tuesday on the source i was looking at, who knows <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
<:KirikaPog:605209108827734017>
I do wonder if that was truly a coincidence lol
i didnt realize that
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
gotta admit i didnt expect the sister development lol
alright that was super fucking cute
Oh that's out?
New Kaguya-sama chapter was <:KirikaPog:605209108827734017>
Wanna make a contract
／人◕ ‿‿ ◕人＼
that was more wholesome than i expected
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
Considering he recommended me actual incest before, clearly never
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
They're stepsisters Lank
Maybe it's just me but I don't like Mira's VA that much. But who knows maybe it'll grow on me.
Yeah I'm gonna watch it anyway
I was looking forward to it, but after seeing the trailer, my enthusiasm isn't nearly as high as it was.
I mean, I feel like you can just see the trailer and have questions about it's quality
I remember my dad tried to explain vlookup to me once, I got real confused lol
I know you can do some wild shit in Excel but that's all beyond me lol. I just know some of the basic functions like sum or average. That's about the extent of my knowledge lol
Jesus
"Apparently Excel is trending because a Nippon TV program did a special where they followed a new manager for Yoshimotozaka46 who uses Excel and shocked all her senpai by using a SUM function instead of manually calculating everything with a calculator! holy crap Japan why"
😠
I mean they do introduce like 17 characters in the first ep, so 12 eps wouldn't be enough to cover it lol
<:KirikaPog:605209108827734017>
Is that Aubrey Plaza?
why tho
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
I did.
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
Hey <@!199928870810419200> get in here, there's a good anime for you
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
but hey that just means we can get to best girl dragon faster
<:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
yeah they skipped quite a lot
yeah the pacing is real fast, i wonder if its gonna keep up like that or if that was just for the first ep
damn
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
Idk how i feel about this animation lol wtf is this face
Cue*
'The Strongest Sage with the Weakest Crest' was better than i was expecting, it does seem like they're going through the plot quite fast but the animation actually seems pretty good compared to what i'd expect
But yeah this and slow Loop, we got some nice looking CGDCT this season
Yeah but apparently it's 24 eps so I guess we'll have lots of time to remember em
Yeah
I wanna read the LN for that one
Where are the anime adaptations tho is the real question
Finished the Sono Bisque Doll ep, this girl is adorable i love her already
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
So, 19 seasons of yuri bait?
i like the blue girl, she seems cool
but 19 seasons, god damn
<:TsubasaNote:689554460044820608>
I see, I'm learning
Are cures what the girls are called?
how many precures are there at this point?
yuri hamlet would be real nice tho, someone get on that
<:ShirabeStare:582381430915596289>
ooh i need to watch that one
That's hilarious
<:wakarimasu:476452770682241062>
Indeed
<:CarolSmug:617040484111745027>
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
Ah, those are both looking good
What are they doing this season?
Damn, new Attack on Titan episode, shit's going down
<:wakarimasu:476452770682241062>
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
No changes pls, i wanna see the chaos unfold
Aren't there only like 20 manga chapters left to cover? That's totally doable isnt it?
I thought there was enough eps to finish it?
I'd be surprised if there was a movie tbh
I can't imagine why
<:HibikiThink:688429715362414641>
Yep, start of the last season
👌
new ep was a banger too
<:HibikiFingerguns:688429715836502063>
I just pirated it lol, no issues there
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
I get that, it is a bit different than the other OPs
<:ChrisDJ:690470897194369034>
Unrelated but I was listening to the new AoT OP again and man is it a banger.
👀
<:CarolSmug:617040484111745027>
A fellow cultured individual I see
Same for strongest sage, the animation was better than I thought it'd be but the plot is going way too fast.
Cowards, don't cop out with an OVA, gimme a full 11 episodes of a god damn beaver pokemon.
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
There's gonna be a fucking bidoof anime?
Horimiya
👀
Oh man we've even got yuri in here too?
Ahhhhh they're so adorable
whats the third
For the longest time i always got which one was Hori and which one was Miyamura mixed up lol
Man that first ep was great, hori and miyamura are cute af together
Ayy I remember seeing this clip
I've seen a handful of clips from and it looked really cute so I figured I'd give it a shot
Speaking of Horimiya, I was literally just starting to watch that right now.
Oof
Maybe I'll buy one at some point
I don't actually own any figures
<a:mariWhale:596707359053840401>
I would legit consider paying for crunchy/funi if they actually offered good service
One of the big reasons I pirate anime is because more often than not the pirate sites have better video players for me than the legit sites lmao
I'm curious what points that video made lol, I can think of plenty of good reasons
🏴‍☠️
Weakest crest first ep was fine, but the only issue for me was that the plot was going way too fast. Wasn't it like 7 manga chapters or something they covered in 1 ep
Same, don't get me wrong S1 and A's were great, but I absolutely loved StrikerS. Though I do get it definitely has a lot of problems.
StrikerS is good <:CarolSmug:617040484111745027>
<:ChrisPray:672578403156885504>
NanoFate good
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
Can't wait to make it even worse for you guys in AMQ with the intial D roulette
I think I've only ever had curry like once or twice in my life tbh
is she looking at curry
Also, all i can think of when i hear the girl in Fantasy Bishoujo is Azuzu from Sigururi since they've got the same VA
<:CarolSmug:617040484111745027>
Other than Arifureta S2, I think I've started everything i'm interested in this season. And it's all pretty good so far
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
Oh hey, someone actually subbed Irodorimidori
<:TsubasaBliss:672861879000891432>
Finished Horimiya, man that was super fucking wholesome. good shit
cute romance anime that aired a few seasons ago
time to finish Horimiya now that im home
yeah i was about to say, does fran even need to be protected lol
<:CarolSmug:617040484111745027>
Really good story there btw for anyone who may be interested, it's much better than you'd expect something with that title to be.
If I'm looking through a ton of stuff to read, why am I going to spend the time looking at something with a title that doesn't tell me anything that i may or may not enjoy when I could go for something like "That time I got reincarnated as a slime" that i know ill be interested in.
Ah the good ole befriending laser
I remember reading a few chapters a long time ago
Ahh, that
Chapter of what now
<:Yousoro:715479194888437811>
Truly the worst timeline we live in
I don't understand Show by Rock <:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>

Man, Arifureta S2 is looking like hot garbage so far, just the way I like my isekai
slow loop out here being savage
<:wheeze:758563748172136478>
all i know about that anime was that it had a really good op, but i've heard its trash lol
Granbelm was.... Well it was something
I kinda  like this one, it looks smol and cute lol
<:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
I like how they've got all the ships covered with the top right pics xD
One of the reasons I don't watch much dubbed stuff, I swear every girl character sounds the same <:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
Yeah usually the villainess either goes back in time and changes, or someone who's aware of the plot gets isekaied into the body of the villainess and acts completely different ("Wow this girl was a bitch, I'm gonna be nice from now on so I don't get the bad end"). I actually can't think of many where the villainess is actually that evil, usually it's the heroine who usually ends up being the bitch lol
<:ChrisDJ:690470897194369034>
I like it, but I also can get why people don't
<:YumiPanic:688429717174354012>
This week's CUE! ep was good, the MC's voice acting was impressive. I also just realized an anime about seiyuus is like 3 levels deep lmao. Irl voice actors playing animated VA's who are trying to be VA's for an anime.
the fuck is that
<:MariaScared:672584661125431299>
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
I love her
It absolutely is, I love it lmao
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
Hold up, what
They also both air on Sundays
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
I gotta relearn what airs what day now that a new season has started
Doesn't the sailor uniform anime also air today or is that tomorrow I forget
I'll watch it when I get home
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
First ep was real good, hopes are high
Oh right that aired today
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
For good reason, ~~Its bad~~
I feel like I can't really think of much political stuff in anime I've enjoyed. Just not my cup of tea I guess
Oof
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
Was 6 episodes of nothing but political dialogue really that interesting
There's also that manga where the MC drives a truck that isekais people
lmao
<:wheeze:758563748172136478>
"However, just as she's crossing the road 3 meters away from her home she hears a sound from her right side.
"Wait... HOW DID A TRUCK EVEN GET HERE?!""
They're doing it for love, it's fine
damn
I watched the first few mins out of curiosity
<:wheeze:758563748172136478>
tree isekai is kinda hilarious
listen, even by my isekai standards its not very good. That should really tell you something xD
https://www.scribblehub.com/series/244100/idol-is-the-strongest-job-in-this-world--reincarnated-as-an-idol/ I'll tell you ahead of time, it's not good at all lol
Overthrowing a country for yuri, truly a worthy cause

<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
the first chapter is some of the most generic garbage isekai i've read. I love it already
<@!237964037898502144> Lmao the idol isekai starts off with a love live reference
Fruit attack lmao
Indeed
<:CarolSmug:617040484111745027>
Trees are cool though lank

plant isekai?
<:MariaScared:672584661125431299>
what a cursed comment
Ooh, Machikado Mazoku and Nijigasaki S2, next season is gonna be great
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
Plus I've got even more interest since I deal with plants irl
👌
I've been reading through tree Isekai, it's surprisingly better than you'd expect from a story about a guy getting isekaied as a tree.
The names are great
mood
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>

We need another good Yuri anime, it's been awhile it feels like <:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
Not even yuri
Idk if I'll be buying any more LN's soon, I may check out the ones for 'Didn't I Say to Make My Abilities Average' since I've been eyeing those recently.
👀
part of why i like elaina so much is because they're a bunch of short stories and easier to read a few at a time
longer stuff is harder to motivate myself to read
ill get around to it eventually
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
Speaking of feb 22 releases though

I still have vol 3 sitting on my desk that i bought like 4 months ago and haven't read yet
wait vol 4 is out?
those are some real cute looking girls
'The Genius Prince's Guide to Raising a Nation Out of Debt' is actually not that bad, Ninym is a great character
rip
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
i wanna read that but i also wanna wait until its finished so i can read all of it at once
He's a very good boy, I'm glad he got some pets
Indeed it is

<:CarolSmug:617040484111745027>
That manga is pretty good
I was about to order a few volumes yesterday, but I happened to drop by a bookstore and saw the first one so why not
OwO
You've got me real tempted Lank
damn thats gay
<:sweaty:839235693699661834>
damn, i wouldn't have expected that tbh
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
👀 👀 👀
the ring chapter?
yeah but think of how much runtime is used for all that drama when it could be used for gay instead in Citrus
12 episodes of nothing but wholesome girls kissing each other
nah gimme sakura trick s2
I mean like proper yuri, not something that's mostly something other than romance with a hint of yuri
The banana stuff shocked me when I first watched the anime, I was not expecting that at all.
<:wakarimasu:476452770682241062>
<:Ver:704169051391524875>

<:CarolSmug:617040484111745027>
Oh hey, we finally got to best girl in strongest sage
~~We all want Hori to step on us, but she wants to be stepped on herself~~
I'll watch stuff with guys in it on occasion. Take some wholesome romance like Horimiya or Tonikawa for example.
yeah pretty much that
from ep 3 of Sono Bisque Doll
<:wheeze:758563748172136478>
Holy shit im dying
this weeks Sono Bisque doll is certainly starting off with an interesting scene
Any more 🦶  in akebi still?
I'll have to watch it when I get home, I'm still not used to what's airing what day this season yet
Ooh pog
Oh does that air today?
<:MariaScared:672584661125431299>
damn i really need to watch that ep lol
👀
I'm waiting for the inevitable revenge on the fiance guy
Yeah the sister is cool
I like it, it's wholesome

I was actually rereading that the other day
Ah yeah that
Finished the first volume of 'Didn't I say to make my abilities average'. I was surprised how different it was compared to the anime.
OwO there's an anime movie playing in theaters right now?
I remember seeing the McDonald's one before, so that's where it came from.
Damn it really is tho
And it does it really well too
But yeah, it definitely hits some heavy topics
You know it's coming, but it still fucking hits anyway
Ah fuck I'm crying now

I ordered em through Amazon
<:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
Rip, I ordered vol 2-4 after I finished vol 1 but they're arriving in the wrong order so I can't read it yet lol
Same, I've only seen like maybe 2 anime movies that I can think of off the top of my head that weren't attached to a series.
I know that's like, one of the popular anime movies, but I surprisingly haven't seen it.
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
Nova wtf
I hope the anime will be good

Are those cute girls I see?
👀
Leadale is actually pretty good, I wasn't expecting too much but i've been enjoying it so far
Like I've said before, S2 is gonna be real good. There's a ton of cool stuff I'm looking forward to.

Gojo is a good guy too
This week's sono bisque doll, god Marin is so precious
Ayyy best girl is here
I've seen that one before but never read it
"Didn't I say to make my abilities average'" is actually a better read than I was expecting it to be. It's nice how instead of the party just smashing everything like in the anime there's actual fights and struggles going on.
I mean, wonder egg is basically Ai's harem anyway isnt it
Ayy vol 2 is here
I'm kinda shocked that I found that by googling 'manga isekai maid wolf boy' and it was the first result lmfao
?

||Well, it makes sense that she's the top when I think about it. <:MikuLewd:336656493606862868> ||
👀 Misaka and Shokuhou are doing what now
What's this?
👀
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
too much politics
i remember reading a bit of the manga for realist hero
'The Genius Prince's Guide to Raising a Nation Out of Debt' is better than I was expecting it to be. Ninym is great and the political stuff is reasonably simple enough that even a smol brain watcher like me can follow along <:Ver:704169051391524875>
~~The best part was Kozakura~~
Knowing nothing about the source material, Otherside anime was not that great imo
If it's a good anime tho, or if it's so bad that people complain how much better the LN was I may check it out.
If I know an anime is coming, I don't wanna spoil myself with the source material.
I'd consider executioner but I'll probably wait until after the anime if I do.
<:CarolSmug:617040484111745027>
Good stuff
I need to continue that, I'm like halfway through vol 4
<:MariaScared:672584661125431299>
yep
About to go to the crescent-moon castle
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
speaking of cute girls going on adventures tho, Leadale is still pretty good
Idk sounds kinda sus
Yeah but like, there's a difference between cute girl going on adventures and dealing with political conflicts between nations.
I feel like those are gonna be full of big brain content
<a:MariWhale:596707359053840401>
Once I finish all of these though, I may start looking for another LN to waste money on
Nice, but no
<:HibikiFingerguns:688429715836502063>
Ping me when its finished and I will
<:MariaScared:672584661125431299>
<:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
Vol 10 arrives tomorrow to finish the set, but I can't read any more because vol 6 doesn't arrive until Tuesday
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>

Is that a cute girl anime I see?
<:ChrisDJ:690470897194369034>
the OP is a banger too
I'm waiting for em all to be out so I can treat it as a S2 and binge watch em. Unless they get shown in theaters then ill probably cave and go watch em
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
I remember seeing a pic from that somewhere on reddit the other day
Ah, I knew it seemed familiar
What's this Lank
👀
<:CarolSmug:617040484111745027>
I see a lotta good stuff on there
👀
I mean....
👀
Cosplaying is fun <:CarolSmug:617040484111745027>
I saw that 👀
lol
<:aesthicloss:480648958574854145>
I thought it was
The lack of comic girls S2 is truly a tragedy indeed
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
Wait I don't get it, someone explain lol
<:HibikiThink:688429715362414641>
I just started the ep, those are some nice jiggle physics indeed
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
<:MariaScared:672584661125431299>
Interesting, I see
<:TsubasaNote:689554460044820608>
I have 0 clue how expensive art commissions are lol
How much would doing something like that even cost anyway
<:HibikiFingerguns:688429715836502063>
*Yeah I'm just gonna not think about how much I spent on them*
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
Vol 6 arrived early so I now have them all and can continue reading
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
I barely even remember what happened in those movies. Maybe I should rewatch them.
<:MariaScared:672584661125431299>
That's a lot
How much precure is there at this point? Aren't there like 20 seasons or something.
<:CarolSmug:617040484111745027>
That scene was good
||I saw a bunch of people mentioning that and had to look it up 👀 👀 👀 They really did spoil a lot xd||
Sooo, this weeks AoT episode ||The OP has told us along, but we're finally here. The rumbling. Man what a fucking cool episode.||
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
They're ping pong balls clearly
Jokes on you I'll go give it a high rating now
You know, everyone always trashes that anime, but I don't remember it being that bad.
I just noticed new Elaina volume got it's release date pushed back <:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
Princess Connect is just one of those anime I don't get
I only remember the more interesting ones to me like Machikado S2 or Nijigasaki S2 until we get closer to the next season.
Oh wait it is?
Where can I read it <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
I mean as bisque doll has taught us, girls play them too
Girl or guy MC?
👀
I think I'm an ep behind on that, I need to catch up but I've been busy

Speaking of new game, I just noticed there were some new manga chapters TLed.
Yeah but idk what that is so it doesn't count <:HibikiFingerguns:688429715836502063>
All the selection project songs are bangers
👀
Did someone say CGDCT?
Anime peaked at Comic Girls clearly, nothing can match those heights.
You mean Ver x Hibiki isn't?
'The Genius Prince's Guide to Raising a Nation Out of Debt' is a nicer watch than I thought it would be so far, also, Ninym's voice is really soothing <:TsubasaBliss:672861879000891432>
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
Oh was that this spring?
Yeah I was about to say the same thing, Uma Musume was a banger
Lmao Eren Nominated for both best protagonist and antagonist
Horimiya was really good <:CarolSmug:617040484111745027>

I like how, to someone like me who has absolutely 0 context, this sounds like a nonsensical sentence lol
||"At the end" <:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970> ||
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
are we talking like slow burn "It takes 20 chapters for one of em to say they like each other" or like "They're actually in a relationship" tho
~~Most things are~~
How gay does it get?

"November 2022"
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
This totally sounds like something I'd read. And the girl looks cute too
Leadale ep 6 ||I can't say I expected there to be players still around but I'm not too surprised. I do wonder if they're ever gonna go into more detail on who got isekaied and how that worked, what the world actually is, etc. or just ignore it. I wonder if there are any other skill masters wandering around other than Cayna, would be neat to see she's not completely alone.||
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
That anime truly was a trainwreck lol
That anime truly was garbage all around lol
<:m_am_wheeze:795574586698891314>
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
Watch the best Isekai: Gibiate
I feel like I could just basically read a summary of all the political stuff then watch the fight scenes in slime and I would've gotten a better experience lol.
One of these days I'll watch it to see what all the confusion is about
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
I remember when it was airing, questions were *all* people were asking
Wasn't the anime basically to promote a mobile game?
The world building was actually really neat
I did enjoy that one too
<:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
Selection Project was great tho 😠
i dont think ive ever even heard of it
the fuck is peacock tv lol

<:TsubasaBliss:672861879000891432>
I keep hearing some wild stuff about Akebi, I need to catch up lol
<:MariaScared:672584661125431299>
The what
True, I loved tuning in each week to see how it managed to get even worse each episode.
she really does
Just finished the sono bisque ep, ||Marin is great as usual. New girl is cute af too. Wasn't Marin as that Neon girl in the OP too now that I think about it? Also, I'm kinda sad they didn't actually put in Juju peeking through the train door last ep, I even went back to see if they had her there and I just didn't notice lol.||
Ahhhh this week's ep
I was finishing off my collection for 'Didn't I say to make my abilities average' and thought I'd give it a shot since it feels like it has a similar vibe and I liked the anime.
I bought a few of the LNs so I'll have to see if I enjoy them. It seems like something up my alley.
Oof, I enjoyed it
Anyone here read the Kuma Kuma Kuma Bear LNs?
i feel like i expected the mc to have a lot cooler of a voice
<:MariaScared:672584661125431299>


idk i kinda like the banana ponytails
that's some interesting hair
ive only seen a couple eps, but all i know is people talking about Akebi getting her harem lol
👀 👀 👀
<:CarolSmug:617040484111745027>
Nanoha good
Good manga <:CarolSmug:617040484111745027>
True
"male = shoot to kill" lmao
Friendship through superior firepower
Vivid strike is good <:CarolSmug:617040484111745027>
Yeah I barely even remember he exists lol
Clearly the best character is Yuno <a:RSRatJam:940281161161256990>
<:wakarimasu:476452770682241062>
i remember reading a few chapters of that awhile back
ahhh that one
sauce?
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>

I'm gonna assume this isnt gay

speaking of that manga, there's a new chapter and it's *gay* af
<:HibikiGay:670494484701773845>
good mom
good stuff
*Yet another thing I need to watch eventually*
its just been quite awhile
oh i have
*I say as there's a ton of other new anime i've been meaning to watch piling up*
i should rewatch comic girls sometime
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
ooh
That's the completely normal school anime right?
Interesting
The name sounds familiar but I can't match it to any characters off the top of my head
Also I think I said it last week too, but Ninym's voice is super soothing. Idk who her VA is but 10/10
I'm totally down for it tho
Interesting
<:TsubasaBliss:672861879000891432>
Ninym is so good
It's always nice seeing manga updates of stuff I haven't thought about in awhile. Especially if it's Yuri <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594> <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594> <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>

there's only one yuu that matters
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
I had to think for a sec when i saw that name lol
👀
Good ep this week as usual ||That ending tho, 👀  I do wonder if anything interesting is gonna come out of the fact that there's seemingly a bunch of people who got isekaied into the Leadale world. At different times too it seems. Also the scene at the end was dope||
This weeks ledale ep ||Oh god the dragon 👀 ||
oh right that aired today
https://mangadex.org/title/b98c4daf-be1a-46c8-ad83-21d532995240/my-food-looks-very-cute
Maybe I should find more yuri manhuas tho because the only other one i know of is cute as well
~~Time to not listen~~
we need more wholesome stuff like this
it's so good
<:HibikiGay:670494484701773845>

Ahhhh the new 'Please bully me, miss villainess' chapter is so good <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594> Every chapter has been great
||<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>  I could've seen him strung along for a lot longer tbh||
||I was worried but then I finished the chapter, hell yeah. Abandon the guy and go for the Yuri||
Gay?
👀
Cool hair
Lmao true
Yeah I didn't like Brave Witches at all
We've already gotten Patton haven't we?
Just get Macarthur in there
So they just nuke the aliens?
<:MariaScared:672584661125431299>
I'd totally be down for more strike witches though I have no clue what they'd even do at this point lol. I feel like they've covered all the character development they can already (not that repeating that has stopped them before xD) Unless they'd go for more Neroui(?) story that they're just gonna ignore right after they finish lol. Guess I'll settle for the spinoffs
Rip
Is there a date for that, or just 2022 still
Girls und pantsu but idols <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
Idk the chapters in mangadex we're kinda wonky so I had to search for it on other sites lol
<@!161155855524298752> I read through all of the marriage contract one (I think at least), good stuff 👌
same
👀
chef girl out here giving me Kuroko from railgun vibes
oof i see what you mean by it being iffy for the first handful of chapters
I think i've read like one or two chapters of the marriage contract one awhile ago
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
Abandon the main novels then <:HibikiFingerguns:688429715836502063>
<:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
~~That's cool and all but where's more railgun~~
<:CarolSmug:617040484111745027>
Also, I see you're cultured as well with that top right one
Sounds like a lot of effort
All straight? rip <:HibikiGay:670494484701773845>
<:Ver:704169051391524875>

<:KirikaDisgust:688431636043268097>
Idk, there seems to be a *man* in that picture, cute girls are all I need
The only thing I think of when I think about Shokuhou is this
What porn site can I find that on?
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
I can only think of like one or two things ive read where the saintess wasn't a complete asshole lol
<:MakiBlep:774326100552712202>
Reminds me of Saki, except I watched 2 seasons of that and still have no clue how the fuck mahjong works
yep
Does stuff like Yuru Camp or Yama no Susume count?
male protag is only in there from all the isekai lol
About what I expected lol
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
time watched is the only metric i can use basically lol
interestingly, Nana Mizuki is the lowest of the  gear VAs on my list
lol my ranking for VA's is mostly gear VAs
Doga Kobo is the only name I recognize lol, i dont pay much attn to studios
I think the only mecha that exists on my list is like: Code Geass, Granbelm, and Knight's & Magic lol
<:MariaScared:672584661125431299>
yep
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
oh hey, i see amongus in there
ive got a single chinese anime in there i think
same
<:CarolSmug:617040484111745027>
JC is at the top for me
I can't handle whatever cliffhangers it's gonna throw at me and having to wait forever to see what happens next
Listen, I've said it before. When it finishes i'll read it.
*One day i'll actually read that so i can click all that spoiler text*
good shit
it's basically hitoribocchi + k-on
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>

Oh right bisque is today

<:Ver:704169051391524875>
Maybe I'd actually consider paying for anime if the legal sites had a better video player than the illegal ones
<:HibikiFingerguns:688429715836502063>
Yet another reason to pirate anime
I don't think there's anywhere is there?
<:CarolSmug:617040484111745027>
I'm catching up on Slow Loop and I realized that the two main girls totally remind me of Ao and Mira from Koisuru Asteroid
that one is pretty good
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
A lot of those titles sound like garbage i'd read

that's a really sus sounding sentence
oh god not that again

Wait what ||She was wearing color contacts the whole time?||
Oh god this week's sono bisque doll
Speaking of CGI, unrelated but why the hell doesn't anyone bother animating horse drawn carriages these days. I swear most of em I see are all 3D.
That was truly something
Gibiate xD
Give us s3 you cowards
I'm down to do that
I mean

I'd totally shill out some cash on virtual horse girls. Cygames pls

<:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
What a ride it's been
<:ChrisPray:672578403156885504>
The New Game manga is finally fully translated
yeah at that pace it'd be right about enough for a second season
is there a lot of source material that they could cover? I'm not familiar with the manga
That's nearly a 50% increase, im assuming that's pretty big for a boost in manga sales from an anime airing
Wait wait wait, did they actually just throw this in casually for the New Game epilogue chapter (152)
I see some cute girls
👀
There's only like one anime I remember watching dubbed. Maybe I'll check that out at some point and expand my horizons.
<:ChrisPray:672578403156885504>
I don't read many, but the few Yuri manhua I've read are all really good
Ahhhhhh the new 'Please bully me miss villainess' chapter
I haven't seen either of them so I have no clue lol
Interesting
~~Isnt that just the gay bear anime~~
<:RikoOfCulture:749327484411183205>
We do have Riko in Sunshine who has been shown to read yuri
Ah, the other kind of gay
Which one
👀
When we actually get some voice clips
I'll have to wait and see how I feel
Hmm, idk It doesn't quite fit in my mind
She protecc and she attacc
Good chapter, also hell yeah, Hayasaka best girl
Oh is there a new kaguya chapter?
I'm not really familiar with those VAs
👀
Too bad the actual good anime like comic girls don't get a S2 instead
the secret anime council meets and discusses it
ah that
whats it about
I'm a sucker for basically any isekai, I love the villainess stuff
she looks like someone i'd find in a cgdct anime rather than an isekai
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
it's already got a manga so we're getting there
thats a pretty low bar tho
I'm a little skeptical, but hopeful because i really want to like it. I'll wait for some PVs to see how i feel
same
Arifureta S2
I feel like you're hyping up that one a lot
<:HibikiFingerguns:688429715836502063>

i need to catch up to akebi, im several eps behind
the only thing i remember having a content warning was that one elaina ep
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
I've only seen like half of it but I really enjoyed what I did watch of Superstar. Kanon is good <a:KanonVibing:839850211631038464>
Best girl isn't even an idol
<a:YuCheer:754740038994231346> <a:YuCheer:754740038994231346> <a:YuCheer:754740038994231346>
I forget, weren't the Niji characters picked from that other love live mobile game or something.
<a:YuPyon:766912680597782540>
And then we got the best series in the franchise <a:YuCheer:754740038994231346>
I still need to finish Superstar lol
I barely even know what a vtuber is lol
<:HibikiThink:688429715362414641>
You can read hundreds of chapters and still have little idea whats going on
good old chinese martial arts manhuas
<a:YuPyon:766912680597782540>
||I'm thinking of it like Plastic Memories, you know it's coming the whole time, but it's still gonna hit hard when it does.||
Yeah it's super good, but also *suffering*
https://mangadex.org/title/6ecc62e4-25ad-4102-b0d8-580a8023d2fb/kimi-to-tsuzuru-utakata
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
<:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
We're slowly getting closer and closer to suffering as the chapters go by in this manga.
👀
<:m_am_wheeze:795574586698891314>
Didn't they even do a recap in there?
That's one of those anime I don't understand. I thought it was just absolute garbage but apparently it's popular enough to have like 4 seasons.
Show by Rock <:KirikaDisgust:688431636043268097>
This week's Tensai Ouji ep was good, I'm enjoying this series far more than I would've expected to
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
"The ultimate anime experience" I've had a far better experience on pirate sites than on Crunchyroll
Ah that befriending scene
<:HibikiGay:670494484701773845>
<:TsubasaBliss:672861879000891432>
The most recent 'Please bully me miss villainess' chapter was surprisingly wholesome
<:CarolSmug:617040484111745027>
I'm glad to see a fellow enjoyer of StrikerS
<:HibikiGay:670494484701773845>
Yeah I saw that scene and it made me wanna watch it lol
<:CarolSmug:617040484111745027>
Vivid strike good
That's one of my favorites from StrikerS
I mean, it sure isn't straight at the very least
I know i've said it a lot, but there's a bunch of cool stuff coming and I can't wait to see it animated
I'm super looking forward to Machikado
at least thats the vibe i got
https://anilist.co/anime/140830/BIRDIE-WING-Golf-Girls-Story/ it seemed to be a lot more like drama focused than cgdct
Let's see what all does next season have in the cute girl department. Bookworm (Kinda CGDCT I guess), Machikado S2, Nijigasaki S2, Golf CGDCT, RPG Real Estate, Healer Girl(?)
it reminds me of another manga I've read where its a giant (and i think a vampire?) living together. But that's probably just because i dont think i basically ever see giants in stuff i read lol
i do like the MC tho
oh god this seems dark
👀
cute girls doing golf
God it's so tempting, but that price
<:ChrisPray:672578403156885504>
Wholesome camping
Also, OwO there's a new chapter I assume?
I ship it
<:HibikiGay:670494484701773845> <:HibikiGay:670494484701773845> <:HibikiGay:670494484701773845>
<:KirikaDisgust:688431636043268097>
StrikerS good
<:CarolSmug:617040484111745027>
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
"However, there is one thing that Tsubaki can't stop thinking about. It's "men" that she has never seen or touched before. I want to meet him once--. The more she thinks about it, the more the tingling in her chest would not stop. "What should I do with this feeling?""
<:MikuDelete:661660028410920990>
<:MariaScared:672584661125431299>
A restaurant in anime that isn't Wcdonalds?
Isn't it getting an anime too?
i remember reading a bit of that, i enjoyed it
Yep, really fucking cute
bisque doll?
<:ChrisPray:672578403156885504>
NanoFate
<:KirikaDisgust:688431636043268097>
I mean, makes sense
They did?
Hold up, did we really just go there (New bisque doll ep)
true, there's not much point if they're past the feet arc
oh god
At least the manga is finished, that's better than most series.
That also reminds me I need to go order vol 7 of the LN which is coming soon
Man still though I wasn't expecting an Elaina S2, I'm excited to see which stories they'll adapt
I have high doubts about it actually being very gay. I'll believe it when I see it
Isekai
Apparently Mushoku Tensei got a S2 announcement finally as well
There is a Yuri story though idk if they'll adapt it
I've got that exact image in my wall lol

IM HYPED
AHHHH
GX pls <:ChrisPray:672578403156885504>
I'd guess however much they spend picking up the license probably isn't too much for these old titles
Yeah but that doesn't necessarily mean much when it comes to the anime
I really need to catch up on Akebi
Tsubasa suffering even while voicing another character
<:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
It better happen <a:ChrisRage:745358256242688102>
Doga Kobo <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
Maybe I'll catch up on Akebi this weekend
Hold up what
That's some impressive flexibility
👀
I think I started 12 anime this season but have only kept up with like 7
I'd play it
<:m_am_pepegun:936579451674824726>
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/daily-briefs/2022-03-08/mo-ippon-high-school-judo-anime-to-air-on-tv/.183352 Cute Girls doing Judo, we're adding to the list of cute girl sports anime
I do need to catch up on akebi tho so who knows
<:TsubasaBliss:672861879000891432>
Marin is great, but idk I'm just really loving Ninym. Her voice is super soothing too
I think Ninym is probably my favorite girl this season out of the stuff I'm watching
(Ep 9) Ahhh Ninym and Wein are great. I've said it a lot, but I'm really loving Tensai Ouji way more than I thought I would.
<:ChrisPray:672578403156885504>
Now that I think about it, Marin kinda reminds me of Hori from Horimiya.
I've heard of it but haven't read it
MC was as boring as can be even by isekai standards and the plot felt like it went absolutely nowhere and accomplished nothing
guess thats why i didn't xD
I didn't like S1 of that at all
ah that
whats that from
<:MariaScared:672584661125431299>
10/10

<:KarinBlob:823270996114931772>
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
Best boat anime
<:HibikiGay:670494484701773845>
It's *very* gay
<a:AlySweats:770160546041167885>
Oh man these last few Tadokoro-san chapters are getting real lewd
It looks a lot better than I thought it would
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
https://youtu.be/TroQ3-AtG70
yeah the movie wasn't anything too great, but it did have some cool scenes
Tori kaji ippai!
somehow i feel like this is too high iq for me lol
👀
I see a lot of girls there
oh god next weeks ep title
This ep was a great Marin ep
The fork! <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
a good volume indeed
My LN collection isn't very vast so I'm not too familiar with TL companies.
<:TsubasaNote:689554460044820608>
I see, interesting
Are they good about not dropping stuff or something? I have no idea
Yen Press I think
I just hope they keep getting TLed since there's like 17 volumes right now and it could get dropped at any time
<:KirikaDisgust:688431636043268097>
It's also really easy to read since it's a bunch of separate stories rather than one long plot line
Elaina is good <:CarolSmug:617040484111745027>
I'm hyped
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
<a:YuCheer:754740038994231346>
That takes a lotta confidence lol
https://anilist.co/
Yuu is good
<a:YuPyon:766912680597782540>
<:YuuHeart:737647995750973481>
That reminds me, I gotta get the winter uniform outfit cosplay for Niji S2 at some point so I can have the full set
~~I still gotta finish Superstar S1~~
<:YuuShocked:762379673572474960>
So we get Niji S2 then Superstar S2?
once I get a few eps behind its hard to catch up lol
yep

I think there's like 4 or 5 anime this season I'm like 6 or 7 eps behind on lol
<:CarolSmug:617040484111745027>
Board game anime Iski?
According to MAL, https://myanimelist.net/anime/16436/Tenshi_no_Drop . Although the lowest scored actual anime was https://myanimelist.net/anime/48680/Tesla_Note suprisingly.
I just watch mostly cute girl stuff and isekai lol
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
I still gotta read those Kuma Bear volumes and the IFTV vol 3
I should actually read some of my collection before I go out and buy more lol
<:ChrisPray:672578403156885504>
Can't wait to see a bunch of boomer stuff only Solo probably knows but no GX Blu Ray
We've got colored subs for songs at least
https://www.discotekmedia.com/catalog.htm There's a list of out of print stuff at the bottom
I wonder if they're gonna announce anything that I actually recognize now that they've already announced GX
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
GX BLU RAY
AHHHHHH
If they don't announce it, make sure to spam the chat to at least try to get them to comment on it xD
~~Is this mecha~~
https://www.twitch.tv/discotekmedia
5 minutes
they'll tweet a list of it at the end i think
it is a "MEGA-Panel" so they're announcing a bit more than they usually do i assume
"I spent my college years editing trailers for hentai" Some interesting wisdom from the announcers
~~You don't want GX?~~
Looking through their catalog, other than gear there's like only 3 anime they've released that i've even ever seen lol
that title totally fits Mushoku Tensei now that I think about it <:m_am_wheeze:795574586698891314>
<:TsubasaBliss:672861879000891432>
just look at those juicy melons
They used the animation budget on the important things Cypher
Listen, she's a badass
<:TsubasaBliss:672861879000891432>
Mushoku Tensei OVA was good, a full episode of Eris being 10/10
<:MikuBliss:336657233712513024>
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
<:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
I finished the new Majo no tabitabi volume and now I'm left with the long wait for the next one.
<:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
Fair, also, what's up with Japan?
Show by Rock <:KirikaDisgust:688431636043268097>
<:MariaScared:672584661125431299>
This Elaina volume keeping up the trend of throwing some real fucked up stories in there.
At that rate I could probably learn Japanese faster and read the source lol
~~Now to wait a decade for the other 10 volumes to release~~
New volume is within my grasp
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594> <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594> <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
What monster is Maple gonna turn into next
It's got a lot of hype scenes, my personal favorites are probably ||the teleportation incident and the Orsted fight.||
<:TsubasaBliss:672861879000891432>
I've got so much anime I should catch up on but here I am rewatching stuff instead
AP <:MariaScared:672584661125431299>
<:KirikaPog:605209108827734017>
"Cool surprises/announcements" NFT's?
Overlooked stuff can be good, one of my favorite CGDCT anime is a pretty obscure one
Maybe I'll rewatch that one day
<:HibikiFingerguns:688429715836502063>
Catching up on Slow Loop. ~~Koi's mom is a milf~~ <:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
~~I only finished ep 2 lol~~
I'm super behind in slow loop
Also, OwO, wholesome romance?
Is that an actual line lmao
~~Now where are the 6 digit codes for this ep~~
<a:AlySweats:770160546041167885>
Holy shit, that was *horny*
<:MariaScared:672584661125431299>
Oh god, this bisque doll ep ||Electric massager||
Wise words from Marin, very cultured <:CarolSmug:617040484111745027>
Alright 30 secs in and Gojo is horny
gonna go watch it
👀
One of these days I'll watch bandori
I'd just watch anime instead xD
Watch what now
I just don't really get the appeal? Like, what makes them any different from a normal streamer?
I don't think I've ever even watched a vtuber
Idk, vtubers aren't really my thing
Oof yeah wonder egg was a mess with how it went downhill
👀
That and GuP are the only ones I know of doing it
Just throw some Gibiate scenes in there for good measure too
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
Just wait until they announce an EX-ARM movie.
So if it looks really good it's fine, but if it's just the usual quality then that's a no?
Yeah the animation was pretty good 👌
Gotta love anime releasing 6 movies
<a:MariWhale:596707359053840401>
Movies make money, just look at Demon Slayer
<:m_am_wheeze:795574586698891314>
I don't care enough to think about how that all works myself though xD
That's what I've heard talked about
Final Season -> Final Season Part 2 -> Final Season, the Movie
yeah, I've read the manga tho and far enough in the WN that i lost interest
Hmm yeah nothing i think i would've bought a physical copy of anyway
Is there a list of what all they had licensed
<a:AlySweats:770160546041167885>
I mean it's easy to get distracted while watching it
Maybe I'll do that
I see, then if I catch up now I could watch the last ep when it airs right?
Is 11 the final ep or is it 12?
One of these days I'll catch up on Akebi
Also, I saw this and thought "Wait, doesn't this already have an anime. Hold up this is different than I remember. <:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025> " before realizing I was thinking of a different anime about competitive dancing lol
ayy i heard Miyamura's VA in there
there's like half of my list i know i'm gonna watch, and the other half is stuff im interested in but may drop depending on how it goes
that's a lot
<:MariaScared:672584661125431299>

And most of it is stuff that actually looks pretty good
Looking through what i'm gonna watch next season, I've got an almost equal balance of fantasy, isekai, and cgdct
Also, reading that article I forgot that we're almost into the spring season anime.
I liked the VA that I saw in the trailer for Menou
same <:HibikiFingerguns:688429715836502063>
Listen Cypher, don't ruin my happy facade with whatever fucked up stuff happens behind the scenes. It's cute girl action and that's all that matters
If you watch railgun it is <:HibikiFingerguns:688429715836502063>
Mahou Shoujo doesn't really feel like it works as well as an LN, which is maybe part of it. Manga sorta I guess
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
*Gibiate*
Wait, I know an isekai that isn't an adaptation
yeah like isekai is basically always an adaptation
How common are originals compared to adaptations? I imagine they're much more rare but i have no clue by how much
Makes sense
Why is it less appealing if it's not original?
looks kinda cute
is that a title? the heck
i didn't even finish that one
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
nah, gimme some more of that suffering
Ah, KasuKasu
<:EmmaWow:715458291328614414> ?
At least the manga is finished, that's more than most series get
<a:YuCheer:754740038994231346>
Which one
<:KirikaPog:605209108827734017>
<:ShirabeStare:582381430915596289>
*Comic Girls only at a 7.5*
Horimiya, Mushoku Tensei, Slime S2, and Uma Musume S2 are the only ones that really stood out too much to me from that year.
I didn't have too many things i enjoyed that much in 2021 looking at it <:HibikiThink:688429715362414641>
Looking at the last few years on anilist, I'm gonna say Majo no Tabitabi, Bofuri, and Uma Musume S2 (Or if we're not counting sequels, maybe Horimiya)
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
3 years is a pretty big time frame, that's a lot of anime
Also my standards aren't very high anyway, there's very few anime I actually didn't like <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
Jokes aside tho, it was a pretty good anime 👌
Just look at the compilation of thigh shots for Assault Lily, that's all that really matters.
honestly that one isn't even that bad
I've only seen one of those
imagine not liking an isekai
LBX Girls lmao I'm shocked to see that included
<a:HibikiOraOra:582365734097780746>
Anyone know if there's one of these, but for the spring season coming up? I usually find it by scouring the anime subreddit but don't see anything.
<:HibikiGay:670494484701773845> <:HibikiGay:670494484701773845> <:HibikiGay:670494484701773845>
I was rereading this and ahhhhh it's so wholesome https://dynasty-scans.com/series/a_timid_woman_longing_for_her_delivery_girl
I don't think there are any references to other seasons in Niji that I recall
Nope
https://twitter.com/t_chiemi1006/status/1326474041604018177?s=20&t=Ily28vQU-Udmuau88_NAyA Fun fact: Her VA recorded that in a box
Ah, Rina?
The cage around it is to keep the students locked in
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
Girls und pantsu idols
I hope there's an anime with some angry Ayahi in there at some point. Angry Chris is 10/10
Ooh , all the more reason to watch that one
i think all i have on friday is machikado
<:CarolSmug:617040484111745027>
Idk if I got the dates right, but if I did then saturdays are gonna be great for me next season 👌
Machikado Mazoku S2 is one of the things im excited for the most next season
a resolution?
Well, sono bisque doll is finally over
<:KirikaDisgust:688431636043268097>
When pirate sites have a better selection and a better video player, why would I bother
I don't think i've watched anything on crunchyroll in a year or two
it's right between the listings lank, how am i supposed to know
looking at the ones of those im watching at least, i have bookworm, golf, and healer girl listed on different days. the 12th, 6th and 4th of April
<:HibikiThink:688429715362414641>
Aren't those on different days?
wait all that on the same day? what
I think that just made it more confusing lol
are there? I know Nijigasaki S2 is there but what else
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
<:ChrisHappy:660870796696223744>
Healer Girl also has Ayahi in it
Did they? I kinda wanna read that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rq_Rl4zKw-c The animation looks way better than I was expecting
Is that cute girls I see>?
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>

School idol Setsuna? Who's that? <:SetsuSparkle:802425458531893258>
Oh wait, I thought this was a different farming Isekai lmao
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
More isekai
https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2022-03-29/kinosuke-naito-farming-life-in-another-world-light-novels-get-anime/.184163
Ninym is very pretty <:CarolSmug:617040484111745027>
I'm kinda sad now that Tensai Ouji is finished, I really enjoyed seeing Wein's shenanigans each week. I'm also gonna miss Ninym's soothing voice <:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
That sounds kinda interesting, I'll throw it on my plan to watch list and probably get to it in a few years xD
~~Clearly Symphogear since it's based on Wild Arms~~
<:KirikaDisgust:688431636043268097>
I forget which one it was, but I know there's an anime about VA's that goes into  how the industry is shit quite frequently lol
Wait what
Give New Game a few more seasons and they could get there.
I see, ty <:TsubasaNote:689554460044820608>
Random question: how much storage space does a typical 11-12 episode anime take up? I don't really download anime often.
Sounds cursed
<:comf:815254068884799488>
It's gonna be comf, I can't wait
https://youtu.be/Ouz0mLHWR00
Oh man a rudeus discussion, that's a whole topic
||Being Rudeus is suffering <:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089> ||
Machikado is definitely one of the anime I'm most looking forward to for Spring
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
I just realized that the first of the spring season stuff I'm watching starts like tomorrow
Also, fucking what. That awful Isekai with the gorilla waifu is apparently getting a second season.
Oh hey that thing I was talking about a few days ago was posted
~~Though I'm gonna need to get the winter uniform cosplay now so I can have the full set~~
Yep
<a:YuCheer:754740038994231346>
https://anilist.co/anime/133891/Love-Live-Nijigasaki-Gakuen-School-Idol-Doukoukai-2
I'm more excited for tomorrow
You're in upside down time
Oh wait
Isn't that today
Which one
Alright so Executioner ep 1 thoughts ||Already Menou's identity is sus based on the whole dream thing. I kinda like how the world is a bit different from the standard medieval setting and seems to have a bit of technology. The acid trip of null guy activating his powers was super cool. Looks like he tried to self-destruct, *That's a lot of damage*. Menou shaking as she confirms the death and going into the justification of killing him, seems like she's got some complex feelings. The dream thing is already even more sus now that Akari is talking about a similar occurrence. How might the two be linked, guess we'll find out (or not who knows). Since this is an isekai, the church is already immediately super sus, I don't trust the old lady. Menou got picked up as a kid? Sounds like a good excuse to feed her the brainwashing propaganda of the church.  I wonder if the self-destruction thing is common when the isekai'd people die since null guy and snow girl both did it. Though, Menou did seem to be surprised when null guy did it so maybe its uncommon. So I guess Ether is like mana in this world? Pink haired girl just wanted to dress up Menou in a maid outfit, I respect that <:CarolSmug:617040484111745027> I'm aboard the Momo x Menou ship train <:HibikiGay:670494484701773845> The magic system seems interesting. So are using the scripture and (normal?) magic like the flame sword guy did different? Akari seems to be having a rough time dealing with her new situation. And we're ending with them meeting, a shame I'll have to wait until next week to see them interact together. The stuff with dead Menou in the ED is kinda sus <:MariaScared:672584661125431299> Good song tho <:ChrisDJ:690470897194369034> . The setting does seem to be pretty interesting, they introduced a lot of stuff that will hopefully be expanded on as we get further. I'm interested as to where this'll go.||
I've said it countless times before, but I'm super hyped for Machikado S2. It's probably what I'm most anticipating this season

Though I don't have any huge expectations tbh
I'm looking forward to watching that when I get home.
Summer looks meh for me based on that. Nothing I'm really looking forward to
Oh look, more walls of spoiler text from Illindus I can't click.
I used to keep up with MHA but them I just got bored and lost interest
Eminence in shadow actually looks way better than I thought it would
I didn't know either lol
It's not?
Idol Girls und pantsu, good stuff Lank
Yeah that isekai isn't a very good one
Ones a movie that already aired
only like 2 of those are isekai
I enjoyed Arifureta S1 tbh, S2 a bit less so but i still found it alright
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
I didn't complete too much last season
Yeah it looks better than I expected it to and i'm really glad they aren't gonna butcher it (assuming the anime quality is as good as the trailer)
As far as isekai go, despite sounding like it'd be the usual trash, it's actually pretty good. Plus the trailer looks really promising
I'm really hyped for sword isekai
||Table kun helped||
<a:YuCheer:754740038994231346>
At least Lanzhu is more likeable so far than she was in sifas
Best girl is back
<a:YuCheer:754740038994231346> <a:YuCheer:754740038994231346> <a:YuCheer:754740038994231346>
Also, Nijigasaki ep is out
Also, that song was in english? I didn't even realixze when i first heard it lmao
it's a banger indeed
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/daily-briefs/2022-03-30/netflix-more-than-half-of-members-globally-watched-anime-last-year/.184167 It's more popular than I'd expect
show by rock <:KirikaDisgust:688431636043268097>
yeah, the whole "OP protag reincarnates into the future and is super op because everyone is even weaker" genre is basically isekai lol
But I barely remember it lol
I thought it was fine <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
I remember reading like 1 chapter of the executioner manga a long time ago
It doesn't seem like the kind of thing I'd read, but maybe if I end up really liking the anime I'll check out the LNs. How many are there?
I'm assuming it was the stuff at the  start of the episode for Niji S2 EP 1
<:comf:815254068884799488>
I had the same thought
<@!199928870810419200> get over here, there's more Kasu for you to watch now
Honestly is yugioh even a card game anymore
I did watch like 4 episodes a while ago, but I need to start from the beginning again because I don't remember much.
Though like, half of it is stuff I know I'm gonna watch, but the other half is stuff I'm interested in but may drop
xD I've got like that many this season
You miss 100% of the shots you don't take
<:HibikiFingerguns:688429715836502063>
~~Comic Girls~~
Honestly I absolutely loved it, it wasn't really on my radar going into the season but wow. That was really good
I literally just finished Healer Girl
I forgot about that
Ah right
Wait who?
it's brought itself up there with stuff i'm looking forward to most this season
<:CarolSmug:617040484111745027>
I like how most of the discussion on r/anime for healer girl is pretty much "Damn,. I didn't expect this show to be that good"
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
Also, OwO I just saw this
I've gotten too used to watching everything not too long after it comes out in japan lol
ah rip so its just not up yet
Speaking of new anime, does anyone know if https://anilist.co/anime/140830/BIRDIE-WING-Golf-Girls-Story/ is available somewhere?
Since it's Doga Kobo though, I pretty much know it's gonna be good
Not yet, I'll probably do it tomorrow
Ah
wait are they doing birdie wing?
I do like the designs tho, 👌
Cute girl adventurers?
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>

<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
Well I hope they're up by the time I get off of work and get home.
Anilist says it airs in 5 and a half hours from now
I had it listed as today
Is it?
Ah, I think I remember seeing that announcement at some point
I can't click right now, what is it?

Oh shit, Machikado airs today
I'm looking forward to this season's kaguya <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
my top pick so far this season is healer girl tbh

poor ishigami
Time for some cute girl after that trainwreck
🏴‍☠️
yeah this anime is hot garbage, i can't wait to watch it all
This looks like trash so far, I can't wait <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
oh god what is this horrible 3d in the OP
<:KirikaDisgust:688431636043268097>
Also, I just started skeleton knight isekai. That's uhh, quite a way to start an episode
I just kept comments as I was watching
xd
just finished ep 2, Executioner was pretty good. ||Momo putting in the work for the maid outfit, we all appreciate it <:CarolSmug:617040484111745027> . Menou unexpectedly letting Akari see her doing assassin shit and quickly making up a cover story even using the guy she just murdered, Damn. Healing? So is she able to heal herself and that's why Menou can't kill her? I wonder how long it's gonna take before Menou tries to murder her. Oh, that was quick lmao. Oh shit, time? So it's that kind of healing, reversing time? Menou absolutely shook she didn't die. I wonder if Akari actually does remember and is just faking, since we don't get to see her thoughts. Lmao nice distraction Momo, that's one way to do it. Akari getting princess carried, I see I see 👀 . The more the isekai'ed people use the power the more they get corrupted and lose control? Sounds like some sketchy church propaganda to me tbh. Bring Akari to the church lady? Alright my guess is that she's secretly evil and wants to use her powers somehow, there's no way this bitch is good. Akari not caring about anything Menou is saying lol, let the girl eat. Akari doesn't want to go back i see. Menou feeling something from Akari's speech perhaps 👀 . Momo getting jealous I see, I wonder if it'll eventually end up with her trying to kill Akari herself so she can have Menou to herself again. Akari standing where the null guy died <:MariaScared:672584661125431299> . Menou starting to associate her with the dream she has, 👀 Magic explanation time, Ether is basically the standard mana I see. Blowing bubbles with magic <:KirikaPog:605209108827734017> Akari got bonked. Princess lady with big sword, I like <:ShirabeDrool:688429716557791326> ||
I mean, my hopes are still very low for gay
<:ChrisDJ:690470897194369034>
I'm reminded yet again how good the OP for executioner is
oh right thats today
lmao
<:m_am_wheeze:795574586698891314>
plant <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
See, Lank gets it
😠
Then go watch it
<:ChrisHappy:660870796696223744>
Plus it has Ayahi
<:CarolSmug:617040484111745027>
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
You know, I always see people trash that one, I thought it was fine
I've finally finished getting caught up checking out all the stuff I'm interested in this season that's aired so far
Nijigasaki ep 2 was good <:CarolSmug:617040484111745027>  ||I'm curious how much of the sifas story they'll end up using. Also, Yuu seems to be struggling with her classes, poor girl, you can do it <:YuPray:817569610018193438> . I said it last week too, but Lanzhu doesn't seem too bad so far. Same with Shioriko, though she hasn't gotten much screentime yet. I wonder what Lanzhu's hidden feelings are gonna end up being. Also, "I want to be a solo artist and do this alone" Sure Lanzhu, you also have a really skilled girl writing your songs for you. Real solo work going on there I see, way to support yourself. I hope we'll hear the girls from the other school sing a bit, the side groups in Love Live have a track record of usually being bangers so I'm looking forward to it.||
😠
Of those, I've only heard of Jujutsu Kaisen and have heard good things about it. But I haven't seen it myself
Healer Girl <:CarolSmug:617040484111745027>
It's good Iski
We used up all our OG Nanoha cast points in Vivid with NanoFate being gay af
I liked it a lot more than Vivid
Vivid Strike is really good
it's out i think
It's probably my favorite anime this season so far
<:TsubasaBliss:672861879000891432>
Plus, Ayahi singing
I'm liking this a lot so far
Healer Girl is good still <:CarolSmug:617040484111745027>
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594> <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594> <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
Just gimme more Sakura Trick or YagaKimi
<:CarolSmug:617040484111745027>
||I just have high standards for what's yuri <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>  But yeah I'd be kinda dissapointed if there was some happy ending||
||Yeah, but I feel like a lot of series say that and don't actually go anywhere. Even though i know its gonna end in tragedy, I have high hopes here||
||But hey at least we might be getting some gay||
<:ShirabeStare:582381430915596289>
read it you coward
<@!161155855524298752> I know you're reading it, the new 'Kimi To Tsuzuru Utakata' chapter ahhhh its so good
<:CarolSmug:617040484111745027>
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
I'm watching the new bookworm season, I totally never realized Miku is the MC
But gay aside, I actually really do like the main characters. Like, they've actually got some depth to em imo
Everyone's got their own preferences <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
But at least we've got the MC who's openly gay so that's better than most series
As far as i've read in the WN/manga nothing has actually happened between them. So it could just string us along forever with no progress
<:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
👀
Gay?
What's that Iski?
Fenny reading some culture I see <:CarolSmug:617040484111745027>
Yeah Symphogear and Healer Girl are the exact same, we've got Ayahi singing after all
Also, unrelated but I was looking through the Yen Press website for upcoming releases. Elaina vol 8 is listed as next month, I got excited until i realized that vol 7 came out like last month. I assume that's gonna get delayed. <:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
Though sadly we all know no ship is gonna go anywhere anyway
I ship Eve and Lily
I just finished it, I enjoyed it quite a bit. A bit gay, characters with some depth to em, a plot that leaves a lot of topics unexplored for the future. Good stuff <:CarolSmug:617040484111745027>
Listen, it's a good isekai
The way they translated the names in this LN feels really weird to me since I'm used to the ones in the WN/Manga TLs I've read. Anne Sophia -> Anisphia/ Illya -> Ilia/ Euphilia -> Euphyllia. <:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
I think I've read some of the manga for that
Bofuri is good <:CarolSmug:617040484111745027>
I'd read it
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
Do you have any idea how little that narrows it down
Nah, they're not weird enough, we need weirder
I never even considered dragon maid as Isekai lol
There's like, a manga I can think of where girl from other world gets isekaied to modern world, and a few where they can go between worlds. But other than that I can't think of much
I haven't seen too much reverse Isekai stuff
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
Is it? Honestly I feel like most Isekai they barely explore the world at all.
Just start making more otome Isekai instead, ez solution
Listen, there are a lot of Isekai that I wonder how the hell are getting second seasons. While the actual good ones never do <:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
🍴
Machikado ep was good
Just finished it, I agree <:CarolSmug:617040484111745027>
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
Alright, Executioner ep 3, here's my massive wall of text no one asked for <:HibikiFingerguns:688429715836502063>   ||Alright, we got some train terrorists it seems. Princess girl is hot <:ShirabeDrool:688429716557791326>  Lmao, Menou happily chatting with the terrorist, I love it. Akari what are you doing, no. Akari not wanting to get left behind "anymore" poor girl, I'm guessing there's totally some sad backstory here <:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970> . Momo torturing one of em for into, how terrifying <:MariaScared:672584661125431299> Ooh, Momo vs the princess? <:KirikaPog:605209108827734017> Fight fight fight! Menou completely ignoring them lol. This is more of a battle of words rather than an actual fight lmao. OwO, suicide bombs in the terrorists? Oh god that's disgusting, the fleshy implosion. Ooh all the red orbs coming together, big bomb? Ah, it's a summon, interesting. Also, Menou just standing there while it forms. Like, is there no point in even trying to stop it? At least try to stab it or something smh. This guy doesn't even look threatening at all <:YumiStare:688429724065988721> Like, he's just clumsily doing some swings. Ooh, a boomerang, that's pretty neat <:KirikaPog:605209108827734017> Lmao the princess taking Momo with her, serves her right for being so smug. Oh hey, the boomerang came back, nice assist Momo! Menou has no clue what's going on tho lol. Rip, the red guy hit the engine. 👀  "I don't have the ***time*** to be dealing with this thing" I see, I see <:TsubasaNote:689554460044820608> Oh shit even Momo and the princess went back a few seconds too? What kind of range does Akari have <:MariaScared:672584661125431299> Also, clearly there's some more hints at Menou and Akari's connection since Menou just thought about it and it happened and it "feels familiar" 👀 . Oh hey, there she is. If she were to get taken? So does the red thing absorb people and form from their ether or something? Is that why it formed how it did? Ooh, we get the dope music again <:ChrisDJ:690470897194369034> This fight feels so lackluster tbh, like the knight is so slow and non threatening feeling. Ah, the good ole taser strat, nice one Menou. I still have little idea how the whole magic and scripture stuff works <:HibikiThink:688429715362414641> . Akari clapping while Menou kicks the shit out of the stone lmao. Train engine still a problem, is Akari gonna reverse its time or something and fix it? Menou caring about all the people on the train, she's a good girl <:CarolSmug:617040484111745027> Handholding! <:MikuBliss:336657233712513024> "I can always trust you" That's totally gonna be a sus line later isn't it. Ooh, Menou is gonna use Akari's ether to do some magic and stop the train. "It's gonna hurt a lot" Either Akari is gonna be fine, or Menou is gonna unexpectedly get hurt by it I think. Menou throwing out some sus lines about her past. Oi oi, why is Akari moaning <:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874> Ah, so they're both fine, maybe more than fine 😏 So she basically used a big magic slingshot to hold the train back? <:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025> This audio could be taken real out of context.... Awww, they're so cute. Oh right, I forgot about Momo and the princess lol. Oh shit that's a terrifying thought, here I thought that they just went a few seconds into the past. I never even considered that. I feel like we're setting up a lot of questions so far, I do wonder how many of them are actually gonna get resolved. Guess I'll just have to wait and see.||
I feel like everyone always talks about how they love Flip Flappers
<:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
That's pretty impressive
But yeah idk who they are but the translator is going at a crazy pace, and it's all good quality too.
As tempting as it is, I might just stop reading the manga for now and wait for the next LN volume.
Good stuff
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
Ooh there's *another* new chapter
<:CarolSmug:617040484111745027>
Dang, I was gonna see if the manga artist or LN author had done any other stuff I could look at but it looks like that's a no go <:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
Well, I'm already good on that front. Plus the manga too whenever it comes out <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
<a:MariWhale:596707359053840401>
Where can I invest in Princess Anisphia stock
I love the art in that manga, the expressions are super good
Which was also what I initially thought surprisingly because she reminded me of Kaguya when I listened to it lol
Looking into it, I think it might be Aoi Koga
<:YuuHeart:737647995750973481>
This week's Nijigasaki was a good ep for Yuu content
oh wow it'll cover that much?
It'll be a bit before i actually read it xD
I'm gonna wait first for the anime to cover it then read it to see what all it missed I think.
Yo <@161155855524298752> I've got a question btw, so, I bought Executioner vol 1. The anime hasn't covered all of that yet right?
👀 👀 👀
Is that a succubus
So Pride of Orange?
<:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
Yuri you say 👀
OwO a new chapter
ooh I didn't realize there was the post credits scene <:KirikaPog:605209108827734017>
I'm loving this anime so far, which is surprising because it feels like the sorta thing I'd normally dislike with all the random singing
Healer girl ep was adorable
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
~~Badly done 3D~~
<:SetsuSparkle:802425458531893258>
Listen, I still haven't recovered from the anime ending <:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
maybe one day i'll be able to click those spoilers
well if they are gonna be 30 min episodes then that's still more content than it would normally be even with 4 recap eps isn't it?
<:MikuYay:588083917207109636>
I'm super hyped for Yama no Susume tho
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
Also 👀👀👀
Yeah that's uhh real unexpected, but I'm excited anyway
<:ChrisOi:586551700987576330>
<:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
Dropping an anime with Ayahi singing?
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
It feels weird seeing your profile pic be different in two messages right next to each other
I mean, my standards for yuri are higher than that <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
So, Executioner ep 4 thoughts ||I like how I said the thing about trying to prove my theories right as watch and was immediately confronted with Menou and Momo talking about one of em lol. So there's the whole thing with Menou and her dream at the beginning and Akari talking about this world seeming familiar right? I'm assuming that Akari has been summoned to the world before and met Menou and then for whatever reason Akari used her power to turn back time to all the way before she got summoned. I hate Flare already, get this clown off the screen. I wonder what the math on that is, with a continent of salt dissolving into the ocean, how much would that fuck up the ecosystem. Tiny Menou is super cute even if she is wildly stabbing with a dagger. So Akari and Momo are tops and Menou is a bottom. I see <:CarolSmug:617040484111745027> . A naked Akari hugging Menou, is this gonna be the extent of the yuri? I do wonder what the old priest lady is up to with the ritual, that's probably gonna take a couple eps to get to. Original Sin? Demons? Are they just gonna throw that out there and refuse to elaborate, I wanna learn more.||
<:ChrisMunch:688191202973319198>
Now that I've got food time to actually watch the executioner ep
<3
Speaking of episodes, hey <@297542051057238017> lemme know when the vol 1 stuff is done so I can read the LN 👌
I'm gonna start watching with some theories in mind so I can try to convince myself that they're right xD
Unrelated, but seeing anime posting reminded me Executioner was today <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
Am I wrong tho
Listen, when one of them is interested but only in her thoughts and does nothing to actually act on it. And the other seems to not be interested at all. <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
exposure to cuteness maybe
I wanna see a return to Fuji
👀
I'm *concerned*
<:MariaScared:672584661125431299>
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
||I mean, it's anime. Isn't the main character always supposed to be different?||
I haven't, I saw that linked in <#407060923078017026> yesterday and will probably check it out because it looked actually gay.
||Can she actually though? Has she ever specifically been shown to be in control so far? I was under the impression she didn't have basically any control over it.||
It's good that you use em, I just find it amusing lol
I feel like whenever I see Illindus type in here it's always spoiler tagged xD
Then you just gotta live with Saya thirsting for Elaina
There are a couple actual yuri stories
<:HibikiFingerguns:688429715836502063>
Unrelated, but speaking of LN's dropping next month (If it doesn't get delayed)
I just read all of it, god this is cute af. <:HibikiGay:670494484701773845>  Nagisa is adorable
<:AiAmCool:626454184073625630>
This week's Nijigasaki ep certainly wasn't quite what I expected. I'm always down for some more Ai tho
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
i mean paper is prob fine
i know nothing about the manga except that i hear it's just *suffering*
does it even deserve the funny sex number if there's not even any sex tho
*I mean....*
<:KirikaPog:605209108827734017>  Can't wait to see em in Love Live!
Slowly gaining numbers?  Is fripside eventually gonna be an idol group? <:Ver:704169051391524875>
I did really like that OP tho, i didn't even realize it was with new singers for frip
that's not even isekai is it
Tbh, I don't really like this cover, idk it just feels weird
yeah i remember hearing that
👀
I looked to see if the artist had some other works I could check out but I don't think they really do sadly.
The expressions are 10/10 in the manga
For May I got
Looking through Yen Press and Seven Seas it's only an average of like 2 books a month that I'd like to get with a bunch more that sound interesting
It's actually not that much when i really look at it, since it's spread out across the months but
<:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
💸
Actually damn, Yen Press has a lot of stuff I'm interested in looking through their upcoming releases the next few months now that I look at it
so it gets points there
I mean, the cover is quite cute at least
Maybe I'll end up reading it eventually depending on how i feel after the anime and LN vol 1
the english is up to what, 4 coming out soon right?
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
Also semi-related but I'm already kinda sus of some things because of the shots in the OP. 👀
I listened to that one quite a lot after I heard it
<:TsubasaBliss:672861879000891432>
I really love the OP
I am looking forward to seeing what the anime didn't cover when i can eventually read the LN
Ah, I'd be surprised if that was the case but I could totally see it
is that a safe spoiler 👀
||I mean I feel like "Super advanced society that got destroyed for some reason or another and now the world is medieval looking" is a pretty common Isekai trope tbf||
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
Thigh
I'm really looking forward towards more LN volumes
I can't click the vid right now, what's that
Sounds a bit cursed
Also, the end of this week's 'Please Bully Me, Miss Villainess!' chapter ||<:MariaScared:672584661125431299>  Oh no||
Healer girl was good, Kana is adorable I love her
Lmao, poor girls
<:ChrisHappy:660870796696223744>
Oh hey, I completely forgot Healer Girl was today
||I feel like it's about to set up another one like at the start where there's no choice at all. Just "Do this horrible, violent thing, or suffer the consequences of not doing it" Which pls no, they were getting along so well <:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970> <:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970> <:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970> ||
Same, I am *concerned*
I'm glad someone else has to suffer the wait until the next chapter with that ending
I know right!
I remember learning that from the anime <:HibikiFingerguns:688429715836502063>
It could also just be a slice of life thing though which songs wouldn't matter as much
That's what I was thinking of too
Yeah
But also, I feel like there's only so much you can do when making a manga where songs are a big focus.
👀
They really are gay af
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
What the fuck is this insane golf course
So uhh, this Birdie Wing ep, what the fuck is going on lmao. This is getting weird
Poor girls
Science and Math <:MariaScared:672584661125431299>
Like I said before, maybe once it ends

Like this and Nana
I just associate you with spoiler text at this point Illindus. Since I see it so often from you xD <:Ver:704169051391524875>
<:MariaScared:672584661125431299>
Should I be concerned for this week's ep.
Executioner ep 5 ||How the fuck are they just gonna end the ep like that? ahhhhhhhhhhhh. So old priest bitch is evil as expected that's no surprise. But shooting rainbow lasers out of her cane, wild shit. Erase personalities? That's obviously makes Menou's past even more sus  especially now that we know old lady was planning this for awhile. I wonder what the motivations of the princess are, I feel like her character hasn't been explored much. I am a bit curious how this is all going to get resolved though. Princess/Momo fighting those big monsters seems like a tall order. A scripture-less Menou seems to be not too powerful. My only guesses are Akari doing some time rewinding shenanigans or Menou getting an unexpected powerup. The title for next ep only has me more concerned <:MariaScared:672584661125431299>||
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
Well, that was quite the executioner ep
<:KarinSmug:625816508714582032>
I'm down for a Setsuna x Ayumu x Yuu ship
I liked the extra pairs of clothes in this week's episode
I was sus the second I saw her lol
Isekai you say 👀
true
Also tho, ||Red eyed evil MC is hot, step on me pls <:TsubasaBliss:672861879000891432> ||
Fuck the villainess system, let them be happily gay together already damn it
<:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
I was hoping the outcome from last chapter wasn't gonna be like that but I knew it would be anyway
But also <:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
<:HibikiGay:670494484701773845>
I literally just read that chapter like 30 seconds ago lol
Yuyushiki was really boring imo lol even by sol standards
I feel like you're missing some important details there ||Ya know, like the fact that Orwell has also murdered quite a bit and is sacrificing young girls for their youthful blood||👀
D:
It's not the ride that scares Ayumu, it's seeing Yuu with another girl.
<a:YuCheer:754740038994231346>
<:YuuShocked:762379673572474960>
I never liked Ayumu that much tbh, SetsuYuu tho <:YuuHyped:762379673816530984>
👀
I feel like I'm seeing a lot of real gay screenshots from the last episode of Nijigasaki recently. I should catch up on that. 👀
<:CarolSmug:617040484111745027>
Healer girl is good

👀
Gimme a Kana plushie
I'd buy merch <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
I've said it before but I'm really enjoying Healer Girl. I definitely didn't expect anything going into it, but now it's probably my favorite thing this season
Though I can't say I expected that ||The one who saved Kana on the plane was the teacher. I guess the blonde hair was just meant to throw us off lol||
Healer girl was super comf as usual <:ChrisPray:672578403156885504>
I do hope there's also a Uma Musume S3 too because Kitasan Black looks super cute and I wanna see more of her
<:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
<:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
Where's Uma Musume global tho
<:KirikaPog:605209108827734017> <:KirikaPog:605209108827734017> <:KirikaPog:605209108827734017>
I watched like 5 seasons of it and I have 0 clue how cars work, I can't even drive irl <:Ver:704169051391524875>
Initial D is a fun time
<:CarolSmug:617040484111745027>
Gimme Umayuri instead
<:TikiPraise:672430544381935625>
Horses!
I should properly read that at some point. I remember I got a bit through it but then the translation got real janky.
Lmao I love their expressions
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
We're getting into the good stuff
Oh shit what a great episode, we're at one of the things I was really looking forward to this season
ayy i just started the machikado ep
How concerned should I be for this week's episode
I'm hyped <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
Illindus is the one over here with time powers, knowing all the future events for executioner <:Ver:704169051391524875>
honestly it doesn't even feel like much of an isekai to me
i only read like 1 chapter of the manga a long time ago, but remember next to nothing about it
||Makes sense, Menou is pretty smart. She'd probably be really suspicious||
Will do
<:HibikiFingerguns:688429715836502063>
I'll prob read the novel this weekend
You did ask... <:Ver:704169051391524875> ||Wow, priest lady caused that disaster? Damn. Also, I'm reevaluating my opinion of Flare a bit now that I know she suspected the old lady. Oh hey abs princess and Momo, I wonder how they're gonna deal with the monsters. Uhh, Akari? Watchya doing? Uhhh, Akari?!?! So, did she just unlock her memories of past regressions? "That often" How many times has she gone back? <:MariaScared:672584661125431299> She knows all about the executioner stuff too? <:MariaScared:672584661125431299> This girl is fucking terrifying, she just vaporized like 10 people what the fuck. Okay what the fuck, Akari is terirfying. So, lemme get this straight: Akari almost dies and it triggers her to regain her memories(?), then she either does some stuff to solve the situation and resets her own memories(Why tho?), or if it's too bad of a scenario (like menou dying?) she just resets the whole world like what she did on the train (and probably a lot more depending on how many times she's regressed)? Noooo the ribbons! Akari you bitch. <:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970> Poor Momo. Alright so that's how they're gonna get out of that situation, Momo getting unhinged. She fucked that dragon up god damn. Princess lived through that explosion? Those abs aren't just for show I guess <:ShirabeDrool:688429716557791326> And she's got a giant glowing sword? <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594> I love her, 10/10. "You'll run out of ether" Akari is totally gonna come in and give her some im guessing. Momo was alive? I thought she totally suicide bombed. "False sun" Uhhh, Momo? Explosion <:KirikaPog:605209108827734017> Way to ruin the moment Akari 😑 Hold up what, where did she come from, ah it was just a distraction. 10/10 strats there Menou. Yep, using Akari as a battery lol. Powerful gay eye contact? Whatever that was was probably too high iq for me <:Ver:704169051391524875> . Cool music is playing, some cool shit is about to happen. An aging laser? Old lady is dead <:KirikaPog:605209108827734017> Momo and the Princess, I ship it. Momo and Menou are real cute too tho <:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025> So Menou knows Akari regressed from the future now, but I guess she doesn't know about the whole regaining memories thing. Nooo, what is this sad scenario <:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>  That was a wild rollercoaster and there's still 6 more eps? <:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>  Good shit, I can't wait.|| (Executioner ep 6)
👀
I have it typed up on my computer, I'm outside rn
I do, I just forgot to post it <:Ver:704169051391524875>
Speaking of good eps today, the Kaguya-sama ep was a good time too. I love that ED lol
Great episode
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
So uhh, that was a wild fucking ride
Alright it's only a minute in and it's already wild
Alright time to watch executioner, I wonder what kinda wild ride i'm in for
<:KirikaPog:605209108827734017>
<:MariaScared:672584661125431299>
<:wakarimasu:476452770682241062>
<:ChrisDJ:690470897194369034>
Also the music was great too
<:KirikaPog:605209108827734017>
What a great spy x family ep, Loid is cool as fuck
I feel like completed works are rare lol, maybe it's more common for fanfics though idk
I feel like it's tough for me to read fanfics because they either: update infrequently so by the time a new chapter is posted I forget what's going on, update too often and it's hard to keep up so I end up falling behind and having to read 50 chapters to catch up, or they're going well and then get abandoned.
It really is
Are there even that many yuri novels that get translated?
<:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
I feel like it's hard for me to find good yuri i'm interested in because whenever i do find something i like it's either like 10 chapters or only updates every few months.
Shhh, just don't tell Mel and we can keep it a secret
damn valid point
Why look when I can just ask for recommendations instead <:HibikiFingerguns:688429715836502063>
<:HibikiGay:670494484701773845>
I have now
i'd read more yuri but i'd have to find it first <:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
It's so cursed
I want an adaptation of that love live manga where Honoka does Kendo <:Ver:704169051391524875>
I'm a couple eps behind, so do we not have Shioriko the usurper in the anime?
<:KirikaPog:605209108827734017>
Oh damn i didn't realize Spy x Family was gonna have a second cour too
Anya summarized this episode well
Same, I don't think I've literally ever looked at rankings or ratings on there
~~Shhhhh, I'll get around to it eventually~~
<:HibikiGay:670494484701773845>
I mean, one of the girls is pretty gay for the character voiced by Ayahi at least
I mean, nothing has happened between anyone <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
At least from the stuff I've seen, it's all just implied subtext gay, not any actual gay
I feel like this season hasn't had too much stand out stuff for me. If I had to pick my tops, they'd probably be like, machikado, executioner, and healer girl.
I mean yeah, like I don't really see anything insanely special about it to make it so popular. <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
Also, I didn't even realize that the song is apparently in english lol
<:ChrisDJ:690470897194369034>
Also, unrelated but the insert song from the last Spy x Family ep is a banger https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-97_lbCtgpg
<:ChrisHappy:660870796696223744>
~~Is this a Symphogear reference~~
I can't say I'm very familiar with some of the topics it talks about, but I hear it's pretty good representation.
Ah that one
I'm absolutely loving Kana, she's just adorable
I don't really download anime because torrents for some reason just don't wanna work for me
Idk, whatever 9anime has <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
It's even music related <:m_am_wheeze:795574586698891314>
This whole time I knew this face reminded me of something and I just now realized what it was.
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
Personally one of my favorite aspects are the expressions
<:CarolSmug:617040484111745027>
This week's healer girl ep was good as usual
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
Why is it called "Phos at *Subway*" That's clearly Mcdonalds
I mean I never thought it looked that great <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
Any actual gay yet Lank?
<:HibikiThink:688429715362414641>
what the hell
<:KirikaPog:605209108827734017> <:KirikaPog:605209108827734017> <:KirikaPog:605209108827734017>
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
Ahhhhh, fantastic machikado ep. 10/10 That's one of the scenes i was waiting to see ever since s2 got announced.
Oh shit was Machikado today?
Poor Momo
Sounds kinda interesting
<:ChrisPray:672578403156885504>
I only watched a couple eps so far but I wasn't too interested this season
<:TsubasaBliss:672861879000891432>
Machikado is great so far for S2
<:MariaScared:672584661125431299>
I am glad that we seem to be answering one of the questions I was curious about though, ||About who those two girls in the OP were. Also, she was creepy as fuck <:MariaScared:672584661125431299> She totally served those people human meat didn't she.||
This week's executioner was alright, not too much going on but I suppose that can't be helped since we just had an insane episode last week.
<:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
yeah that was too but we all know s2 is never gonna happen, though not like sakura trick has a chance either
Gimme sakura trick s2 so i can get a yuri anime that's actually gay
Rip
So basically like Adachi and Shimamura?  <:Ver:704169051391524875>
So, I feel like I have to ask, but how gay actually is this? Like, am I just gonna see girls blushing at each other, or like actual relationships
What's this
👀
Of course it's platonic, clearly there's a man waiting at the end of the aisle
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
I literally don't
Where am I gonna put the LN?
I can't read LNs if I don't have a place to live.
Sadly irl stuff is more important than my collection of unread LNs
I've been really busy lately
First I'd have to read vol 1 <:HibikiFingerguns:688429715836502063>
Like I said earlier, my hopes aren't high. I'm suspicious of how much actual Yuri there will be. (Then again I'm not familiar with the source here)
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
You give good recs tho so it's fine <:CarolSmug:617040484111745027>
alright you're off the hook this time
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
Wow, imagine shilling for a LN and not even paying for it
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
Speaking of LN's, Elaina vol 8 is coming next week
Illindus trying to shill for the executioner LNs as usual i see
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
Ayy jumping on the otome Isekai train I see
I see a girl in the background, the 3 male characters have immediately become irrelevant to me
<:KirikaDisgust:688431636043268097>
Boys? In CGDCT anime?
So never
Probably when we get YagaKimi S2
Listen, my standards are high. I've heard plenty of things are Yuri only to be let down when I actually watched them.


<:Ver:704169051391524875>
~~Doesnt that just describe Symphogear~~
They're really good tho
Every LN volume for Elaina generally has at least one fucked up story
Poor Elaina <:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
I need to catch up on that, I'm pretty behind on this seasons anime
That's ep 9 I think
<:TsubasaNote:689554460044820608>
👀
I'd like the harem ending but don't think it'll go that way at all lol
Akari Chan?
Are there even any Yuri harems out there
I'm talking about something where the main focus is romance
<:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
I still wonder when we'll get a Yuri anime next
👀 👀 👀
I haven't read that but maybe I'll pick it up

<:MariaScared:672584661125431299>
||Oh hey, a character voiced by Nana that isn't ok. Now doesn't that sound familiar <:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089> ||
oh right executioner is today, i completely forgot
<:CarolSmug:617040484111745027>
I absolutely loved the movie
<:KirikaPog:605209108827734017>
Kaguya-sama is starting to get into the good shit this season. ||It's nice being a manga reader knowing where this is going||
I barely even remember what happened in flip flappers
<:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
people actually watch the blu ray they buy?
I wonder who has the rights to nanoha, i dont think you can stream it anywhere
were the shinais included with the g blu ray?
I'm content with GX anyway
AXZ When <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
My favorite is personally StrikerS, but yeah A's is super good
<:KirikaPog:605209108827734017>
Just checked, damn that was way fucking cooler lol
is it? lemme go check
I still love that line lmao "I wonder if Fate can survive that" , like they really thought she might've just killed her lmao
Nanoha hitting em with the zenryoku zenkai
lmao valid
I wouldn't bother expecting gay otome isekai, that basically never happens
👀
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
I had to think of which one that was because i read so much otome isekai and all the titles start to blend together lol
Surprisingly i haven't read that one 👀
<:ChrisDJ:690470897194369034>
speaking of things im catching up on, i just watched the last healer girl ep, damn that was good
shhhh
<:KanonSweat:712760565801680967>
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
it's like Nana, ~~I'll get to it eventually~~
listen ive been busy
oh right, seeing Illindus reminds me i still need to watch executioner
<:CarolSmug:617040484111745027>
i mean even if they're not actually otome isekai, there's a bunch of stuff that fits close enough i'd consider it in the genre
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
wdym Mel? Drifting tanks is realistic
Same <:HibikiFingerguns:688429715836502063>
<:HibikiGay:670494484701773845>
Is there anyone who's courting death <:Ver:704169051391524875>
oof questionable TL is especially bad for chinese stuff i feel like
This sounds right up my alley
Yeah, it's super wholesome <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
im down for it
this looks cute
<:CarolSmug:617040484111745027>
one of em has the tsubasa hair too <a:TsubasaBear:605271358603132931>
i see a lot of cute girls
👀
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
all tanks look the same anyway
I love it, that kinda cute and wholesome stuff is right up my alley.
I feel like there's not really any character this season I'd buy merch of. I'm not surprised by people wanting spy x family stuff tho
im watching this weeks machikado ep, what a great intro, 10/10 lol
<:YumiPoint:688429724103344164>
<:HibikiFingerguns:688429715836502063>
So basically
i only watched a few eps of both bookworm and shield hero this season but i felt like both of em were pretty lackluster
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
speaking of airing anime, we're finally getting into the good shit in kaguya-sama
<:MariaScared:672584661125431299>
<:MariaScared:672584661125431299>
so uhh, im real behind on birdie wing. What
<:KirikaPog:605209108827734017>
people generally get upset that she isn't a hero solving every problem and righting every injustice she comes across

👀
there's also the manga which has a few differences from the anime and has some stories the anime didn't adapt
ill prob do that this weekend since im also off monday
i haven't gotten around to reading it yet
Elaina good <:CarolSmug:617040484111745027>
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
fair
she's there a few times in the LN isn't she?
I guess i should've expected that kind of response since it's coming from someone who enjoys index <:Ver:704169051391524875>
I always hear people praise that anime but I don't get the appeal. I thought it was just meh
Isn't he already cool enough even when he does nothing? I mean he has two swords! *Two*!!
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
True, i guess it does count as trash isekai too
~~I'd rather watch more trash isekai~~
<:TikiPraise:672430544381935625>
<:TsubasaNote:689554460044820608>
I see
What's a steelbook
I guess once you've done so much, you might as well do the rest lol
Yeah aren't they at a convention or something
Oh wait is discotek doing that right now?
I remember looking through discoteks catalog once and I recognized literally nothing lol
I'll still watch it since ya know, isekai. But I'm not a huge fan of Konosuba
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
~~AXZ Announcement when~~
Finally caught up to Nijigasaki, I actually like Mia quite a bit now
Catching up on Nijigasaki, Shizuku's gay fanfiction is great<:ShizuSweat:610989050018660352>
probably tearmoon empire too
I'm def gonna buy that one
ooh theres some good stuff in there
I see
||I see, I just assumed that the terrifying personality we saw in the orwell fight was her real personality||
I see, makes sense
<:TsubasaNote:689554460044820608>
Also, question from this episode ||Akari seems to have regained her memories from her past regressions again, but i feel like she's acting totally different from the last time she did that. Is there a reason for that (if i just missed something) or is that spoilers||
there's far worse isekai getting more seasons so theres hope at least
Maybe you'll get lucky and get a second season
~~Eventually~~
can it really be as wild of a ride as the first half was tho
<:MariaScared:672584661125431299>
<@297542051057238017> Just watched the last ep, I have no clue where executioner is going at this point <:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
now that I'm actually looking at it, I'm liking what I'm seeing upcoming for next season.
oh is made in abyss airing next season?
Plus like, it might not be as old as most of their stuff, but early 2000's magical girl anime totally would fit their catalog.
Or am I misremembering
Don't they only have like one season or something
Personally I'd like to see Nanoha picked up. Idk who even has the rights to it at this point
<:MiaTPose:793598918411288587>
My headcanon is that cuz of the whole global war and what not they just don't wear pants because that'll take up cloth and manufacturing capacity that could otherwise be used for war stuff.
Yeah the horny is just kinda thrown in there lol
This week's Healer Girl ep was nice as usual, the imagery while singing was especially super cool
oh my god
Ah yes, Miyafuji being thirsty for some titties
Lewd
👀
Did someone say isekai
OwO
<:ChrisPray:672578403156885504>
<:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
Uma Musume global when
Ahhh that
Yama?
Does it? I haven't looked that far ahead
I was looking at next seasons anime not that long ago and it's looking pretty good for CGDCT stuff too <:CarolSmug:617040484111745027>
<:KanaOooo:960972275715276900>
<:MariaScared:672584661125431299>
I feel like it was already going off the rails with the ||Gigantic underground golf course that transforms|| lmao
I think I stopped on like ep 4 or 5. I need to catch up
||THE CRUNCHING NOISES AS SHE TWISTS. OH GOD MAKE IT STOP <:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970> ||
Also, I just wanna say ||I think this ep definitely gets my vote for most horrifying scene I've seen in an anime this season. Like holy fuck||
||I totally took the bait of Manon being the real baddie and that girl just being a victim. What a twist indeed. ||
||Can't say I expected that one. I thought Manon was bad, but god damn this girl is fucking terrifying <:MariaScared:672584661125431299> ||
Hey <@297542051057238017> , so uhh today's executioner episode ||What the fuck <:KirikaShout:607741871703457812> ||
I've heard good things about that
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
Then, try to get people to learn Japanese
<:MariaScared:672584661125431299>
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
just try harder in your quest of trying to get people to read the LN so you can say more
my standards for gay are high
I still don't really see it but <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
Like I said earlier tho about this week's executioner ep ||Little girl doing shit like twisting her own head off and pulling a predator coming out of bodies like that. Fucking terrifying <:MariaScared:672584661125431299> ||

<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
<:SetsuHappy:715459030314647555>
Also, I just realized i somehow skipped over ep 6 for Nijigasaki S2.
Ironically last episode i was just thinking about how it felt like kasukasu seemed pretty missing in recent eps lol
<@199928870810419200> Today's Nijigasaki ep is right up your alley <a:KasuHehe:626072698501464084>
I've heard of it but never read it. It seems up my alley tho
Hmmm <:HibikiThink:688429715362414641>
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
idols und pantsu
ah right the off brand girls und pantsu
girls und pantsu was just too powerful for one studio to handle
Maybe I'll actually read one of my dozen LNs that I always say I'm gonna read but never do
hot
<:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
There's a new chapter of 'Please bully me miss villainess' out.
Rip
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
I mean the shipping will be slower but it's not like i'm actually gonna read them for like months anyway
<:HibikiFingerguns:688429715836502063>
Oh that's pretty dank. Ironically i had just ordered a few books from them from amazon earlier but it's cheaper if i do it through rightstuf 👌
It was like a maid Kirika/Shirabe and a Chris I think
Which seemed overpriced since they seemed much cheaper online anyway
I forget but they were like $200-300 or something
I saw like 3 Symphogear figures from a booth that was selling a ton of figures at the last convention I went to but that was it.
Just let the gays be happy together already <a:ChrisRage:745358256242688102>
||That god damn villainess system. She doesn't deserve this suffering <:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970> <:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970> <:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>||
I should look into that seven seas sale again. I ordered a few things things yesterday but might as well see if there's other interesting stuff
That's quite impressive
19? That's a lot of reading
Any good stuff next coming next month?
I think i've read the manga for that one
Man looking through all the seven seas stuff there's a lot of good books in here. Also some stuff I didn't realize were even getting an official TL like https://www.rightstufanime.com/The-Summer-You-Were-There-Manga-Volume-1

Because it's good, next question
<:KirikaPog:605209108827734017>
Can I teach a class on why isekai is pog?
I don't even understand why more books are necessary after vol 2. Like, it's totally a completed story
~~One day I'll actually read vol 3~~
Who needs the actual source material when I can probably go find a fanfic of her getting with Sophia and that'll be better that whenever the real story is.
interesting choice
I feel like there's definitely been a rise in adaptations for otome isekai, I hope that trend continues <:CarolSmug:617040484111745027>
I looked into seeing that, but there wasn't a theater showing it for me
👀
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
~~If you die in the otome game you die in real life~~
<:MariaScared:672584661125431299>
<:ChrisPresents:672578363176517642>
Sounds like a standard Strike Witches episode
I only watched a few eps of this season for that but It just wasn't that interesting for me
Yeah how could they get it so wrong, Berserk was the one inspired by Dark Souls not the other way around!
<:HibikiGay:670494484701773845>
I just wanna see Asumi top the childhood friend
Depending on how long Asumi keeps somehow missing her, I could totally see that happening
Nanao x Asumi's childhood friend when
<a:AlySweats:770160546041167885>
<:HibikiGay:670494484701773845>
Good chapter
<:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
Neat
So is that a real product then?
It sounds like a bunch of different plots thrown together lol
I see, interesting
<:HibikiThink:688429715362414641>
OwO what's this? Idol?
<:ChrisDJ:690470897194369034>  It's even more of a banger coming right after one of the hype scenes from that anime
With that skillset, can they explain why the rocks in Houseki no Kuni are suffering?
<:SetsuHappy:715459030314647555>
Also, I just thought about this, but the girl in that image totally reminds me of Setsuna lol
Oh, Doga Kobo is doing that? Now I'm interested again
<:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
Ooh a new chapter on a Friday? That's unexpected
some actual yuri finally I see
*I'm interested*
<:HibikiGay:670494484701773845>
Also, I forget the timeline for what happens when. Are there enough eps left to get to the Mikan stuff
Also, I'm reminded again how cool the transformation sequences are
This week's machikado good as usual <:CarolSmug:617040484111745027>
rip, it does seem a bit less interesting for me now knowing that
Somehow each week I always forget what day Machikado is and upon seeing someone say something about it just think "Oh hey, Machikado is today?"
👀
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
You're not making a very convincing case here
<:KirikaShout:607741871703457812>
Out of curiosity, how much of abs princess is there in the LN?
One day.......
And one day I'll read it......
yeah yeah at some point
||The story is getting too big brain for me, I'm more interested in abs princess and Menou doing cool stuff at this point <:Ver:704169051391524875>||
||<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095> idk i just don't like Akari that much, she's like the least interesting character for me ||
Actual executioner episode thoughts tho ||Crazy loli pandaemonium doing some more insane shit as expected. I appreciate how fucking cool the magic Menou is doing is. Like, using some magic vein stuff to summon a whole church and compress the girl into a small flesh ball while blasting her into the sky with a heavenly laser? That's some top tier content right there. Honestly I don't care about the Akari stuff all that much so sadly i wasn't too interested there, but I'm real curious how they're gonna conclude this. Also, there's only one more ep? Damn this went by fast. ||
||That's valid too, ironically my least favorite pairing is Akari and Menou xD||
||I totally ship abs princess and Menou. THE PRINCESS IS DOING A PRINCESS CARRY!!! <:HibikiGay:670494484701773845> ||
Just finished the executioner ep myself, that sure was something
Illindus summoned by executioner talk I see
oh right thats today too
I just realized kaguya-sama this season is gonna be 13 eps. I was worried for a min that there wasn't gonna be enough time to get to everything
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
Rip
I don't read too much manhua, but I read a bit of manhwa and it doesn't ring any bells for me
i think the only ghibli movie i've seen is spirited away
looks like vol 5 is out in september so 6 is quite a ways off
rip
<a:AlySweats:770160546041167885>
<:ChrisPray:672578403156885504>
Who is that?
then that probably makes it death note for me xD
the first few anime i remember watching are like: dragon ball z, yu yu hakusho, death note, and Fate/Zero
it was probably among my first thinking about it now
i should properly watch that anime one day, i remember watching a fair bit of it like 10 years ago but i dont think i watched it all
I forget, was kuwabara the big red haired guy
Has anime lied to me? I thought the kids always hung out on the roof of the school
Unwise words 😠
Wise words <:CarolSmug:617040484111745027>
You want another season? Too bad, you get gorilla waifu isekai s2 instead
<:HonkEvil:749327484197142569>
Honoka looks a little different than i remember
🐸
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
i only see one correct answer there and it's the bottom right
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
Listen, if there's not a hint of actual romantic feelings expressed anywhere how are you gonna call it yuri
It's hard to justify buying a physical manga that I'm gonna read in 15 minutes
I prefer manga in general for reading, but if it's a physical copy I'd rather buy LNs.
i think i've only ever pirated like 2 LNs
Like If there's not at least one girl clearly expressing romantic interest in another girl at the bare minimum, I wouldn't consider it yuri. I feel like a lot of what i hear people call yuri doesn't even meet that
Is that common?
So they do the subs themselves?
<a:YuCheer:754740038994231346>
interesting
wait a jp blu ray had english subs?
<:WHEEZE:977844560510222376>
ah
oh that's out?
<:HibikiGay:670494484701773845>
unbrella girl yuri isn't something i ever expected to see, but I'm totally down for it
Imagine making konosuba 3 when there's so many other good things that studio could make sequels of instead
(The fact that Isekai is great aside), Isekai is pretty straightforward to define at least. Like, someone goes to another world. There's a bit of ambiguity sometimes, but generally most people wouldn't disagree on if something is Isekai or not.
My standards are high <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
How they gonna use Horimiya for that image, the OP is great <:ChrisDJ:690470897194369034>
"Ice Queendom" sounds gay af
As much as I really want more, I feel like they're gonna end at a good place for the final ep which I'm glad about. Guess I'll have to wait and see tho
Also that after credits scene tho, looks like we're going places for the last ep
Damn today's healer girl ep was fantastic, that's probably my favorite ep so far
<:wakarimasu:476452770682241062>
<:ShioTPose:739684693464842281>
A cultured take
<:CarolSmug:617040484111745027>
a fair bit of similarity I see
Since most movies probably won't hit US theaters it'll probably be awhile before i watch em
Just going through anilist, this is probably what I'll at least check out, though i anticipate dropping a few
<:CarolSmug:617040484111745027>
I'm looking through the summer season anime since that stuff is beginning to start in a few weeks. I feel like nothing really stands out to me this time around. There definitely seems to be a lot of CGDCT and idol stuff tho which I'm hyped for. <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
Akari got bonked
<a:ShirabeBonk:801207951645605958>
I've been rewatching some YagaKimi here and there, 10/10 to Yuu's sister for being supportive of the yuri <:CarolSmug:617040484111745027>
I remember trying to watch evangelion a long time ago, too big brain for me <:Ver:704169051391524875>
Machikado is nearly at one of the moments I was looking forward to seeing animated this season <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
Like, here's cute girls, but here's also some commentary on racial discrimination.
It was a strange experience
I've only seen the anime
Could be licensing issues
I imagine stuff can get dropped for a lot of reasons
Who knows
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
Oh right, executioner is today
I'd be pretty impressed if there was a kaguya-sama convo that in-depth here lmao
xD
||That sounds like a more interesting outcome to me tbh. I felt kinda disappointed when Akari basically just ran and saved the day. ||
speaking of the princess, with the last episode ||I'm kinda sad that Menou didn't get to do some cool stuff when the princess threw her the sword. Like, sure it makes sense that Menou isn't very familiar with using something like that and she didn't have much ether. But damnit i wanted to see Menou being cool swinging a sword around||
<:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
rip
How much does the princess get elaborated on? Her having abs and being really hot aside, she was honestly one of the most interesting characters for me.
Not that I really expected anything different but still sad
I still stand by the statement that this wasn't nearly as gay as I was lead to believe
Idk, I feel unsure at this point how much I'd actually enjoy it as an LN tbh
So executioner is over now, that certainly was a ride
This week's Kaguya-sama episode ||Hayasaka being an idol is adorable as fuck <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594> <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594> <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594> ||
Like
It's some bizzare stuff
There's even a whole scene depicting the holocaust
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
heh
like i said earlier, i still have a book i bought like a year ago and havent read lol
I'll probably end up buying them but never reading them <:Ver:704169051391524875>
I see
I forget, where are the english TLs again? like vol 4 or 5 right?
*Enhance* <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
ooh she does look cool
<@297542051057238017> Why do these covers look progressively more lewd
~~There were technically~~
That's one of the series i wanna own all the manga for eventually
New Game <:KirikaPog:605209108827734017>
I ship it
I've been to like three bookstores and all of them had a bunch of centaurs life books on clearance lol
i feel like i see a ton of those when i go to a bookstore lol
ah
what manga?
<:HibikiFingerguns:688429715836502063>
watch more anime then
<:MariaScared:672584661125431299>
mine's not too far off from that
<:MariaScared:672584661125431299>
<:CarolSmug:617040484111745027>
Speaking of Yuri tho, I just finished this and damn it was a lot better than I was expecting. Good stuff
Sounds like a fair assessment
I approve of this guy
I haven't read that
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
~~Part of the reason I won't read it~~
No cuz I'm not gonna click that <:HibikiFingerguns:688429715836502063>
<:HibikiFingerguns:688429715836502063>
Like I've said before, hit me up when it finishes and I will
All the spoilers are tempting, but I'm still not gonna read Nana
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
Apparently the last ep for this season's Kaguya-sama is gonna be an hour long
Some of these fight descriptions are gruesome <:MariaScared:672584661125431299>
Oh no, Illindus is dropping some lore <:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
~~Why can't they just use Mana like a normal isekai~~
Also, reading this, question: Is 'Guiding Force' the same thing as what the anime had as 'Ether'?
Ok but like ||Are we just gonna ignore the princess doing a princess carry of Menou in the anime <:HibikiGay:670494484701773845>||
Menou x Abs Princess is the true answer
Who knows
<:CarolSmug:617040484111745027>
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
Don't worry, maybe it'll be fine to send them in a few years when I've eventually read them.
Idk, It's gonna be hard to beat art of abs princess
The best part <:ShirabeDrool:688429716557791326>
<:KirikaPog:605209108827734017>
Are all of em like that?
<@297542051057238017> I didn't expect to see a big picture
Good stuff <:CarolSmug:617040484111745027>
There's only 2 chapters but I'm enjoying this
lmao they're so casual about it
"Waking up with horns" *Is this Machikado*
Akari is honestly my least favorite character after watching the anime lol
I mean valid
I only read the WN
~~Because it's not~~
<:KanaOooo:960972275715276900>
<a:YuCheer:754740038994231346>
I agree with Lanks idea
The scene that gets my award for most horrifying thing i watched this season
<:MariaScared:672584661125431299>
I didn't go into watching it expecting much but honestly it's probably my favorite thing I watched this season
Healer Girl is finally over, that was a good last episode <:KanaOooo:960972275715276900>
Too bad GX isn't out <:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
Harem is probably like my least favorite Isekai trope tbh
||Then they pull a bait and switch on us again and have Menou kill him a second time and usurp the harem <:HibikiGay:670494484701773845>||
The anime was suffering enough
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
~~I already have~~
<:WHEEZE:977844560510222376>
||Who needs a S2, just gimme an AU spinoff of fake MC and his harem of Menou, Akari, Momo, and Ashuna instead||
Illindus has been summoned I see
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
I'd love more Healer Girl, but I'd also be fine with them leaving it there. It ended on a good note
I've only read a few of those but i'm familiar with most of em
~~Because it's so bad it should be illegal~~
That's a half sibling
?
Or am I missing something here
Aren't stepsisters, like by definition, not related?
True?
I mean stepsisters <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
Just watch Citrus
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
you're guilty by association
Illindus pls
Wow, telling me to read the manga and you haven't even watched the anime?
Luckily for me I ordered both <:HibikiFingerguns:688429715836502063>
I feel like pretty much any Isekai that has the MC reincarnate as something other than a human eventually has them get a human form.

Comic Girls S2 is what we really need
~~Where's the issue~~ <:Ver:704169051391524875>
<:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
Sadly I feel like there's 0 chance anything would ever happen with more content being produced
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
<:HibikiThink:688429715362414641>
<:RSXToDoubt:940111751490445382>
Exactly, once you've seen the anime you don't need to read the source. Wise words Iski
isnt that one getting an anime
Hold up what  <:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
Jesus that one that's nearly a year old
Sure feels like it
Who knows
Good question
I would fill my shelf with books from Rightstuf ~~If they would ever actually ship my order~~
Good anime
Ah
GLT?
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
<:KirikaPog:605209108827734017>  Final machikado ep is gonna have the scene I'm really looking forward to
some manga have color too!
isnt anime just manga but with more fps anyway
Who
I'd absolutely love a Kana neso
<:KanaShock:960972275501396038>
Quailty stuff
Last kaguya-sama ep was really good
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
I'm looking forward to the last ep. I know what's gonna happen since I've read the manga but I'm excited to see it animated
Oh really? <:KirikaPog:605209108827734017>
Kaguya sama is ending today too isn't it
Maybe I'll read those on a Friday ~~In a few months~~
Oh hey today's Friday, time for executioner ~~Oh wait~~
<a:YuCheer:754740038994231346>
Nijigasaki S2 finally over, what a good season
Idk, I see two guys in that thumbnail. You're not making a great case here
The finale this season was super good
<:CarolSmug:617040484111745027>
That graph is meaningless on mine because I don't rate anything lol
apparently
https://anilist.co/anime/104404/A-Story-of-Cigarettes/
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
If you want some real fun
164 hours watched according to the stats
plus some of those are OVA's/movies, etc
Looks like 30 completed, and the other 27 are stuff that i only watched some of, so it's not that bad
What's wrong with that many 👀
I haven't seen that much from that long ago lol
<:MariaScared:672584661125431299>
Older stuff? Ok boomer
It feels weird seeing my in progress list on anilist be so empty. Everything i was watching this season is over
I'm conflicted. On one hand it's cute girl isekai, on the other hand it's Sunshine <:KirikaDisgust:688431636043268097>
<:YuuShocked:762379673572474960>
Wait what the fuck this is actually real?
Nope
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
Personally I like that kind of thing. Having like 4 volumes and being completed is nice. It's a reasonable amount of length to tell a complete story and I don't have to go the process of reading like 15 volumes.
The only thing i might grab are some more Futaribeya volumes
Yeah, i was just about to say the only things that really stood out were FUNA's stuff like Average Abilities and the potions one
Looking through rightstuf's sale stuff myself tho, there's not really anything i'm interested in
don't you wanna see the cringe animated?
why read it when the anime is coming
this looks like an intro you'd see when launching a mobile game
I've said it before but I just can't bring myself to have much interest in Sunshine. To me it just felt like trying to copy SIP the whole time but doing it worse.
<:YuuShocked:762379673572474960>
because it's sunshine, the love live season i barely care about
https://youtu.be/XSflX-60EAI I didn't see the video yet, holy shit lmao
Same author as Cheerful Amnesia <:HibikiGay:670494484701773845>
The fact that that exists in the first place is still hilarious
<a:YuzuPray:834442350478229554>
Oh cmon, what's wrong with stepsister yuri?
yep
love live isekai anime
<:KanaOooo:960972275715276900>
One of those originals was my favorite anime for the season
Wait only 2? Damn that's a lot lower that i would've expected but i guess im not too surprised
Hey spy x family to me was: I mean sure this is cool, but I don't get the super high praise for it
In other words, Index totally copied Bofuri is what I'm hearing
true
<:WHEEZE:977844560510222376>
Nice try but that's not gonna get me to read index <:HibikiFingerguns:688429715836502063>
<:KirikaPog:605209108827734017>
any of those have cute girls? 👀
That one looks pog tho
Cowboy you say

ah that
👀
wait, isekai idols?
<a:YuCheer:754740038994231346>
hit me up if something actually happens in S2 <:Ver:704169051391524875>
<:doubt:978318046827524136>
Yet another anime i actually need to watch
Just watch more golf in the meantime https://anilist.co/anime/140700/Sorairo-Utility/
The TL for the Manhua is very good so that's reassuring
Ooh, nice
I presume you're reading the WN, How's the translation btw?
Because god wants to prevent the yuri
From what i recall, not really
Watch it then <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
C-Control, I feel like I need an economics degree to understand what the fuck happened in that one <:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
Looking through my anime list, some of my obscure ones are probably stuff like: Minami Kamakura High School Girls Cycling Club, Maerchen Maedchen , and Circlet Princess
Also, as a friendly reminder that manga is getting an anime in winter 2023 <:HibikiFingerguns:688429715836502063>  https://anilist.co/anime/142193/Eiyuuou-Bu-wo-Kiwameru-Tame-Tenseisu-Soshite-Sekai-Saikyou-no-Minarai-Kishi/
at least im pretty sure they are, maybe im wrong on that tho its been awhile

~~Though the sister is a better ship~~
I'll ship it <:CarolSmug:617040484111745027>
the hat makes him look like a mushroom
do i even wanna ask
I tried to think of a good joke but I couldn't think of any character fitting that description lol
~~Doesn't all of it have magic~~
I'd rate Index S1 a 5/10 ~~Because I only ever watched half of it~~ <:ChrisHehehe:688429717019426821>
like half of those are older than me <:Ver:704169051391524875>
Melua pls
<:KirikaShout:607741871703457812>
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
Looking through their stuff, most of these titles seem totally up my alley
Don't think I'm familiar with that one
👀
What's this?
There's also Upotte!! Where girls are the personifications of guns
Either way tho, that's way too many for me
Huh, I thought it took til vol 7
Doesn't that one take like several volumes to get anywhere <:MariaScared:672584661125431299>
Slow burn <:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
👀 don't think so
<a:YuRinaPatFast:685159788765904949>
<a:YuRinaPat:685159694809169933>
i forget where i stopped
I still need to finish vol 4 i think it was
I just noticed it was the same art as Girls Kingdom and I remember you recommended that
rip
Hey <@161155855524298752> out of curiosity have you read this
that's the spirit
<:KirikaShout:607741871703457812>
With the final ep of Machikado today, my spring season anime are all over. What a great ep it was too <:CarolSmug:617040484111745027>
I need to finish birdie wing at some point
<:KirikaShout:607741871703457812>
<:KirikaPog:605209108827734017>
The first of the summer anime I'm checking out starts today <:KirikaPog:605209108827734017>
Just start with the game  going on the whole time, then splice in flashbacks throughout the series so we can slowly understand the events leading up to the game and the characters.
I barely know what Cricket is, but I'll gladly take more Cute Girls Doing Sports anime
So I watched my first anime of the summer season. Idk how I'm feeling about this one so far, I may give it a few more eps and see how I feel. https://anilist.co/anime/142095/Phantom-of-the-Idol/
Even though it's an anime con, I would feel wayyy too awkward to buy anything nsfw there.
See any Symphogear stuff around at the convention?
There's MTAC, tho idk how close that would be for you
Ooh, I'd love a physical copy of this one <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
yeah I've got basically no interest in digital releases
oof
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
Most of that sounds like stuff I'd read
That's about the vibe i got too
i need to watch that
<:ChrisDJ:690470897194369034>
Far enough that I'd have to get a hotel which makes the cost of the journey really high
<:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
Seeing all this convention talk made me look around to see what conventions there are in a reasonable distance from me. Then crying at how expensive it'd end up being to actually go
*arp*eggio i assume
azur lane
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
I wanna see a more serious version of cute girls in tanks. Like, gimme an anime following a cute girl tank crew but in an actual war (They could even be fighting other cute girls too because I'm sure they could manage to justify that worldbuilding somehow) Like, cute slice of life, but also people fucking dying.
After GuP, I feel like there just isn't really too much you can do with the concept of girls and military ground vehicles
not really, it's just the closest thing that comes to mind
tho that feels like a stretch
https://anilist.co/anime/6802/Sound-of-the-Sky/ kinda i guess
I plan on watching a bit, but not much of it really stands out much. just standard isekai stuff, idols, etc.
Obv it's just the first ep so who knows what'll happen, but I wouldn't be surprised if I end up putting it at the top of my list for anime this season
<:CarolSmug:617040484111745027>
I've got high hopes
Cute girls aside tho, the animation looks really good and I'm interested in the world building they've got going on.
I'm absolutely loving Chisato so far
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
So I just watched ep 1 of Lycoris Recoil. Damn that was really good, I didn't pay that much attention to it going into this season but now I'm very interested.
The plot being rat mind control is the best part
rejected
yeah sorry, I don't see any blahaj there
Anyone who can look at this and not choose Haifuri as the superior boat anime is wrong.
True
Space, that's the difference
there's a spinoff?
~~Live action netflix solo leveling adaptation~~
I'd be down for an adaptation of that, though I do fear it'd totally get butchered
I'm gonna have to find a youtube video explaining madoka first before I can watch a new movie. my brain is too smol to understand these things
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
I wasn't too into Teppen after watching the first ep
Release the Spyce, Princess Principal, and now Lycoris Recoil
I support this new genre of cute girls doing espionage
the boiler room? <:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
I wouldn't be sure, there *are* men that exist in the strike witches universe after all
I wonder why
That feels like an important thing that they left out
I see, interesting
I find it kinda interesting that ||They seemingly just introduced a new mechanic out of nowhere with the familiars where I don't think that was ever mentioned in any of the strike witches anime. Unless i just missed it||
Yep
Girls und Pantsu but idols was pretty good. I'm looking forward to it
vol 3 has been sitting on my shelf unread for about a year at this point. I even have vol 4 i haven't read too <:Ver:704169051391524875>
I'll just end up buying it anyway and not read it <:ChrisHehehe:688429717019426821>
Ah, no wonder I forgot. I remember how bad god of high school was
I can't think of any off the top of my head
have there?
On one hand if it does go well, it could open up the door to more manhwa adaptations, but it could also flop and kill the prospect
I can't imagine this not getting fucked up tbh
oh god no
if evil, why hot
it really is
can the familiars die, and if so do they lose their magic if that happens?
If Love Live has taught me anything, you totally can
I'd imagine the public probably knows familiars are a thing and they can't see them so they just think "Oh, they must be doing something with their familiars" since they clearly look like witches
yeah I doubt it
This kinda makes me think tho, in the event they do produce another strike witches, I wonder if they'd include the familiars since they've shown their existence in this anime.
<:WHEEZE:977844560510222376>
I just feel bad because it's a really good comic that's probably about to get butchered
I vote for the dragon having a hot human form
~~Or just leave it up to some *creative* fan artists~~

very cute
<:CarolSmug:617040484111745027>
Truly dark times
Those sound like some sad seasons
there's only like 5 isekai this season i think
<:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
Sad tho, i wanted to see cute girls
Huh, interesting
Anyone know if there's a subbed ep 1 of Prima Doll out there yet?
Wait Wait Wait, I didn't see this one
yeah

If I looked hard enough I'm sure i could find some poorly written isekai stories with that premise
Are the ones that come to mind
That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime
My Isekai Life: I Gained a Second Character Class and Became the Strongest Sage in the World! 
By the Grace of the Gods 
I've Been Killing Slimes for 300 Years and Maxed Out My Level
How many slime isekai are there even at this point lmao
Hot garbage, I can't wait to watch 12 episodes <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
Just watched the first isekai of the season. https://anilist.co/anime/129192/My-Isekai-Life-I-Gained-a-Second-Character-Class-and-Became-the-Strongest-Sage-in-the-World/
She's really cute ~~If only it was yuri~~ <:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
I only watched a few eps and didn't bother with the rest
<:wakarimasu:476452770682241062>
Otome isekai adaptations <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2022-07-04/why-raeliana-ended-up-at-the-duke-mansion-isekai-fantasy-manhwa-gets-tv-anime/.187385
<:WHEEZE:977844560510222376>
Oh right, I forgot about that bit lol
I'm feeling meh about the anime after the first ep, but I really like the ED https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJieaH23524 Mili putting out some good stuff <:ChrisDJ:690470897194369034>
<:TsubasaNote:689554460044820608>
The only other one i might have up there is https://anilist.co/anime/149874/Smile-of-the-Arsnotoria-the-Animation/ because idk where the fuck this is going
<:CarolSmug:617040484111745027>
I'm expecting it to be up there with my favorites this season. So far only that and Lycoris Recoil have really stood out from the stuff ive seen
The Sega games probably had more frames than the rest of the anime <:WHEEZE:977844560510222376>
It wasn't really on my radar much to begin with, but oof. Isekai Ojisan was pretty bad
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
Fetish notebook? Who needs a manga for that ~~Just look at someones comment history in <#336297808221044736> ~~
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
Made in Abyss was real good stuff, I'm hyped
I always do that
Oh that one's out today? I'll have to watch it when I get home. I vaguely remember the first chapter or two but now much else.
I never read it/watched it <:ChrisPray:672578403156885504> tho
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
<:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
Rip, I was looking forward to Call of the Night, but after seeing the first ep I'm not really that into it
I'm excited to buy vol 5 and the spinoff and not read those either
So far IFTV vol 3 takes the record for LN I bought but haven't read. It's been sitting there for like a year
<:HibikiFingerguns:688429715836502063>
Or just buy them and not read them like I do
Illindus getting summoned from the mention of executioner as usual I see
Ty for the heads up
<:KirikaPog:605209108827734017>
Oh hey I missed this one, https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2022-07-07/shangri-la-frontier-web-novel-gets-tv-anime-in-2023-game/.187469 VRMMO, so basically isekai
<:CarolSmug:617040484111745027>
I don't remember much from the movie except that inori minase voiced the new char
ah that, I saw it in theaters
progressive?
Just watched it, the animation is really good. Lots of cute girls <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
and im gonna do the same thing with vol 5 and the spinoff too!
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
Yeah, I bought 4 when i haven't read 3 in a year
i have 4
My standards are high
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
The only standouts for me so far this season are Lycoris Recoil and Made in Abyss. Prima Doll was quite good too but nothing really super special imo
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
<:MariaScared:672584661125431299>
Maybe that's why I didn't like it so much lol
I'm still surprised there's anything after vol 2, like it was a complete story with that
<:KirikaShout:607741871703457812>
in other words, watch railgun

wise words
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
same tho
I feel like despite the title, this looks like the kind of thing where literally nothing happens
gimme sakura trick s2
<:KirikaShout:607741871703457812>
I wonder when there'll be another good yuri anime <:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
I enjoyed it, the animation was quite good and whatever they've got going on with the setting seems interesting
I kinda wanna see Chisato get really serious and murder someone, ~~Just to see how much it fucks her up~~
<:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
*Too fun* I just know there's gonna be some super fucked up backstory coming up for her
Chisato is badass
Lycoris Recoil ep 2 good <:CarolSmug:617040484111745027>
i feel like that could be any episode xD
what's this even from anyway
<:Ver:704169051391524875>

<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
good stuff
wait what is this
All the stuff Fenny has recommended I've enjoyed <:CarolSmug:617040484111745027>
"I wanna get around to watching Bandori at some point"

"Watches a dozen seasonal anime instead"
Lmao exactly
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
I keep saying im gonna watch stuff but never do
oh is this some symbolism stuff or something
👀
Extreme Hearts was alright, nothing too special
<:HibikiFingerguns:688429715836502063>
Gonna make sure I ping you for every Isekai I can find that has like 3 chapters that also hasn't been updated in 2 years now
Good stuff tho Fenny, ty for the recommendation 👌
<:ChrisPray:672578403156885504>
And the upload times don't inspire much hope for more chapters
Just when it was getting really good
<:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
Only 6 chapters
MC reincarnates into villainess and tries to be good while another person reincarnates into heroine and is a total bitch is a pretty common trope
I'm into it
I read a couple chapters, this seems like a pretty interesting setup compared to the standard villainess story
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
Villainess you say?
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
Oh yeah I remember that, Melua bullying me
I'm surprised how they straight up used MS word in this anime, don't they normally just make a generic program for stuff like this
i feel like i read a couple chapters of that a long time ago
manga artists in japan already suffer enough don't they, monthly is fine
I also just noticed there was a new chapter I haven't read for that one, good stuff
I thought the same thing too lmao
https://mangadex.org/title/878634d2-ea39-4001-a4bf-31458020d16a/villainess-level-99-i-may-be-the-hidden-boss-but-i-m-not-the-demon-lord ?
Cmon, gotta kill monsters for that XP and level up (which is a totally normal thing in this world)
I really wanna see that one animated
<:HibikiGay:670494484701773845>
~~Since most of what I buy is newer stuff I pretty much just always pay like retail price for stuff~~ <:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
Also, I just noticed that this artist is the same one who does the manga Iski linked earlier 'The Skirt Sings at the Landing' and there's more chapters on the dynasty page than there are on mangadex <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
Yeah Yoshino just feels better to me, maybe it's just because I've heard her more cuz newer frip and Shirabe. But to me Nao sounds like kinda higher pitched and I'm not a huge fan.
<:HibikiGay:670494484701773845>
After listening to that, i like newer fripside more
ah
wait did extreme hearts have something that would make it stop?
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
this looks interesting tho
yeah it's not yuri but is very cute <:CarolSmug:617040484111745027>
Yeah I had the one i posted first, IFTV second, then this one third
I would've put IFTV first but then I saw this one
i remember reading a bit of that manga
ah that one
<:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
I was interested because I work in a lab so I was just seeing how accurate everything I saw was <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
I used to just use the mangadex tracker but then it shut down for months and i read a bunch of different manga on a ton of other sites and my tracking vanished lol
I see <:TsubasaNote:689554460044820608>
Yeah that's what I initially thought it did and it would totally be something I'd use to keep track of all the random manga I read.
Interesting
I'd be more surprised if it didn't detect from steaming sites. Or is it mostly designed for watching torrented stuff?
Yeah I get what you're saying, it just doesn't fit my use case I guess.
Idk, the appeal just doesn't really seem to be there for me. I can't really see any reason I'd use that over just using Anilist. Though I guess it's just a interface preference.
<:HibikiThink:688429715362414641>
That looks a bit *too* minimalistic for me lol
I'd rather just use Anilist <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
Ah, yeah I don't think I'd even have a use for that
Oh wait is Taiga just for anime? I thought it was for manga too
i remember saying i was gonna use it but never bothered to actually use it
Actually now that I think about it, since it's set in like WWII, do nuclear weapons exist in the strike witches universe?
Why is North America the only continent that's super fucked up lol
Oh god it's so scuffed
Even the shot of the guy writing a report looked realistic since I've written a bunch of reports like that <:WHEEZE:977844560510222376>
I'm not as familiar with bio stuff since I'm on the chem side of things. But since all they showed was like pipetting, it looked correct to me.
The answer was, pretty accurate for the record
https://anilist.co/anime/140753/SHINEPOST/
<:HonkBread:715458424854282370>
Budget Honoka
Yeah you can just get Miyafuji to pull off some insane magical miracles and that's equivalent
Just gimme Strike Witches S4 in the meantime
Cute girl would be a good choice <:CarolSmug:617040484111745027>
I mean among the list of things I'd be down to be reincarnated as, that's pretty low.
On one hand, cute girls. On the other hand, *what*
I feel conflicted
while stuff like that is usually bad translation, there are some unexpectedly good TLs from people like that sometimes.
fair
There's plenty of trash i'm not watching tho
the only trash i've seen this season is https://anilist.co/anime/135806/UNCLE-FROM-ANOTHER-WORLD/
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594> <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594> <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
Living happily, he's right that's too unrealistic
<:HibikiGay:670494484701773845>
that just means they crammed 4 hours of complicated content into one hour
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
I can already tell this seems too high iq for me
~~That's not gonna stop me from dreaming tho~~
yeah considering GX isn't even out and AXZ is already announced but a long ways off i assume.
~~Symphogear XV Blu Ray when?~~
<:MariaScared:672584661125431299>
~~I feel like we're leading up to her *not* dodging one~~
Definately my favorite so far this season
<:CarolSmug:617040484111745027>
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
Lycoris ep good as usual, Chisato being cool af
At least for what I just watched, I totally would <:WHEEZE:977844560510222376>
I finally got around to watching Demon Slayer S2. Action scenes were cool, but that's about it imo.
~~I still doubt~~
😠
Visuals are definitely a big reason I disliked it tbf <:HibikiHi:336657249827028993>
Even if nothing is gonna happen, at least the fans have editing skills so I can pretend.
Time to ruin another anime <:KirikaPog:605209108827734017>
The fact that most yuri have getting together as the end goal <:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
They just need to adapt these
I remember seeing that somewhere, I'm looking forward to it <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
Ah, I was moreso thinking of just anime
yeah the physical is in september or something i think isnt it
ah i didnt even notice
Time to order it to add to my shelf as a decoration
<:KirikaPog:605209108827734017>
<:WHEEZE:977844560510222376>
~~Like this? https://www.polygon.com/~~
~~Where's the yuri harems at tho~~
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
Cute Girls
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7iWCME2HLY&feature=emb_logo
MC is great in that one
Now there's a contentious statement 👀
For me Nico on her own is just meh, NicoMaki though <:ShirabeDrool:688429716557791326> <:ShirabeDrool:688429716557791326> <:ShirabeDrool:688429716557791326>
<:NicoNicoNii:715458641720901663>
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
Cute girl, big hat, big gun
It's also crazy how ||We can go from jokes about panties to like a dozen lycoris getting murdered just like that.  The tone shifts in this anime are wild so far. And I have a feeling we're gonna get into some more fucked up stuff pretty soon|| (Lycoris ep 4)
Chisato is great
Wait this was getting an adaptation? https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2022-07-22/handyman-saito-in-another-world-tv-anime-reveals-promo-video-cast-staff-january-2023-premiere/.187926 Idk if i missed that one or just forgot
<:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
I think it's jp only after looking for it
That's quite something
Lmao
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
hold up what
Today's Lycoris ep, good stuff
<:TsubasaFish:689163064830066696>
I remember in the TL I watched for Code Geass they straight up linked a wikipedia article xD
<:WHEEZE:977844560510222376>
Like, this is what plays when the MC of the shounen anime gains the upper hand against some villain and starts winning
Exactly lmao, this is something I could totally see playing in MHA
Why does this scene have such epic sounding music lmao
Personally, I didn't think there was anything really good about it, but that's also partly just a matter of taste.
Lycoris is definitely at the top for my favorites this season, maybe only beat by  Made in Abyss depending on how that goes.
I'm glad Lycoris is getting attention <:CarolSmug:617040484111745027>
Wait wait wait
the only thing i know about beyblade is that moses parted the red sea with a beyblade.
I pirated 1 and 2 when i first read them
i might also just buy 1 and 2 at that point since i dont actually have physical copies of them
I'm gonna have to reread one and two to refresh my memory on what all has happened before starting 3 since it's been so long
like september i think
I may also just read it all whenever vol 5 comes out since it'll be over and I can have the complete story
Gimme a few more years and maybe I'll get around to it Fenny
It'll never work!!
~~Clearly this is just a secret plan by Illindus to leave me wanting more by linking good stuff with a few chapters in the hopes that I'll cave and read stuff like Executioner or Nana.~~
<:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
Only one chapter
Yeah this sounds way too big brain for me
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
Considering it's something you're recommending, <:MariaScared:672584661125431299>
Why is there a super buff guy in the bottom right? 💪
Yeah it def looks like it is
it's not?
Aren't there only like 3 series by FUNA anyway? And since now that 2 of em are gonna have been adapted. Yeah, I wouldn't be surprised if the last one gets one.
I'm really happy this is getting an anime though. I like FUNA's stuff and this one is definitely on my list of things I'd love to see an adaptation of.
I feel like that one will totally come eventually. I would be surprised if it didn't get an anime at some point.

Oh shit
Good ep tho
As usual, I have no clue wtf is going on in Made in Abyss.
<:KirikaPog:605209108827734017>
Isn't it moreso LNs than Manga?
<:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
Vivid strike good <:CarolSmug:617040484111745027>
Well that was an interesting Lycoris ep
I can't wait
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
<:KanaOooo:960972275715276900>
Lycoris ep 5 ||I really do wonder what they're setting up for this whole time. There's the terrorist guys who just brutally fucking murdered a Lycoris (poor girl) and the train massacre. There's the red haired woman from DA who's clearly fucking evil (she's totally the one who hired the assassin isn't she) There's the Alan Institute place who's got some background with Chisato clearly though their motives are unclear. I can't say i expected the heart thing, but that also makes me even more concerned for Chisato now. If the Alan Institute made it, then i wonder if they can just like fucking stop her heart at anytime, that's a scary thought. So much stuff going on and there's  no answers yet <:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>  I just wanna see Chisato and Takina be happy <:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970> ||
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
I'm planning on visiting a friend in October and forcing him to watch S1 and G since i have the blu rays but now I can force him to watch GX too
Wait GX is in september too? Nice
holy shit I was not expecting that
<:KirikaPog:605209108827734017>
WAIT WHAT
Seeing all this reminds me how I remember looking through discotek's catalog once and only knowing what like 3 anime were from that list
👀
Idk, there's a non-zero amount of men in that anime
My opinion is a hot take around here ranking XV so low xD GX > S1 > G > XV > AXZ
<:yui_handup:738582987658231849>
https://youtu.be/NW6NdZkeXU0 That's an interesting detail with the uniforms.
<:WHEEZE:977844560510222376>
We're talking timestamps of a video here
Symphogear XV announcement starts at around 55:20 for those curious
Csm?
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
<:MariaScared:672584661125431299>
Made in Abyss is getting more fucked up as the eps go by
I see someone had the same thought
I am extremely curious ||If we're actually gonna see Chisato shoot/kill people with real bullets. I kinda hope it doesn't happen, but I also wanna see it lol||
Ooh that's a big brain move
other than the fact that like, there's something called touhou that exists. I know literally nothing about it
Good shit
Ah, it took me a bit to figure out what the title I'm familiar with for Assorted Entanglements was since i didn't recognize that name. "Fusoroi No Renri" was what i know it by
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
It's not October yet, we're still in August Millhi
<:WHEEZE:977844560510222376>
Oh my god
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
gimme a chisato neso
I'm not really big into figures. I'd rather have plushies lol
Damn they're already on it
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
Wait so like, it's all of those?
Ahhh  so cute
<:HibikiThink:688429715362414641>
That's pretty normal tho?
Yeah, pretty standard stuff
One of the best parts of the ep
Lycoris ep 6 ||I have basically 0 faith in DA at this point, the red haired woman is super fucking sus and I don't trust her at all. I really do like how the relationship is developing between Chisato and Takina. Takina basically just barging in and becoming Chisato's roommate lol. I'm becoming increasingly worried about Chisato's safety because I totally feel like she's about to get badly injured soon <:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>  Especially now that the green haired terrorist dude is interested in her.  I'd like to believe that the Alan Institute place isn't evil but I have my doubts. It'd be nice if they end up helping out Chisato. Also, what's this mention about boy lycoris, hold up <:KirikaShout:607741871703457812> We don't need that nonsense in this cute girl anime.  I have no clue what kind of conclusion we're building up to as the episodes go by, but I'm both scared and excited to see it.||
<:CarolSmug:617040484111745027>
Lycoris ep good as usual
There is this which is pretty close https://anilist.co/anime/104723/Do-You-Love-Your-Mom-and-Her-TwoHit-MultiTarget-Attacks/
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
Aren't there already plenty of isekai where the MC gets shit on?
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
which reminds me Lycoris is today
Ooh a light novel too?
i need to watch that movie one day
Cool, I'm all caught up now, ty I'll add it to the list
~~Gimme a summary of eps 1-499 in 20 words or less so I can catch up and I'll consider it~~
I can barely watch a 12 episode anime these days. There's 0 chance I'm gonna start a 1500 episode anime
Lycoris good
If there's more evidence then sure but I'm skeptical
I mean, is the idea of an anime adaptation based on anything except for that statement about an announcement?
Sad
Based on the comments it does seem like the manga artist mentioned something about an "announcement" in a post about the next volume(if Google translate is accurate) But that could be literally anything.
<:RSXToDoubt:940111751490445382>
So, I just realized. Looking into this, unless I'm missing something, I don't actually see an anime announcement anywhere for this. And this Twitter account seems to just  post "Leaks".  So as much as I'd like my hopes to be up...
I really really hope they don't mess this up, Magirevo is definitely one of the top series on my list of things I want an adaptation of.
I did not see that coming
Holy shit
<:KirikaPog:605209108827734017> <:KirikaPog:605209108827734017> <:KirikaPog:605209108827734017> <:KirikaPog:605209108827734017> <:KirikaPog:605209108827734017>
Ruijerd is a good guy 10/10
God damn maybe I need to catch up lol
fair
I feel like the MC is definitely on the milder side of "using a cheat skill to break the other world" Like, sure she's powerful, but she doesn't do anything too outrageous. *well mostly* but still. It all feels pretty reasonable to me, at least compared to basically every other isekai
I remember feeling kinda meh about the manga tbh
I wonder how often complete series get adapted vs incomplete series. I'd imagine unfinished series get more adaptations
If magirevo really is getting an adaptation, id be kinda surprised because i totally thought iftv would get one first
Either way, I'll wait until I see an actual announcement <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
I can't wait
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
~~Girls~~
It looks good until you realize the MC is a man aren't they?
I think today's Made in Abyss ep is probably my favorite so far this season
Cool looking flowers
~~VA's~~
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
~~Strike Witches but worse~~
<:HibikiGay:670494484701773845>
Rewatching some YagaKimi is always a good time
There were 3 movies?
Yeah like I'm looking forward to it, but it is quite unexpected
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
Isn't it by the mushoku tensei studio?
I'm still shocked that one is getting an anime, I never would've expected that
I'm surprised the cover art doesn't look as lewd as vols 1-3 for vol 5
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>

Speaking of Magirevo, that reminds me
Getting an actual anime announcement for it is good <:CarolSmug:617040484111745027> I'm unsure how I feel about the animation/VAs yet, but nothing looks bad to me at the very least.
Lol technically true
Lycoris ep 7 ||Well, we did get some gay unexpectedly, not the kind I'd expect tho <:Ver:704169051391524875> . I really hope we get some art of Chisato in that dress and Takina in a suit because god damn, hot <a:AlySweats:770160546041167885> . Fan artists need to get on that. Chisato finally found out about who gave her the necklace, though I wonder what her thoughts really are about it. Are we gonna see that she's totally putting on a happy front and is gonna break down later? I wonder... It looks like we're building up to a finale with Majima trying to wreck the new tower and we'll have him confronting Chisato so who knows how that'll go. My guess is that after whatever aftermath there is from that, society finds out about the Lycoris. I'm still unsure what role the Alan Institute and DA are gonna play going forward, I'm still super sus about both of them (mostly just the commander lady).  Good ep as usual tho||
I'm finally starting elaina vol 8, we're really starting out dark here huh
Well that's certainly something
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
huh?
"it was the school"
Exactly what I first thought when I saw them
Not just baseball, it's a bunch of sports. Idols too!
<:HibikiThink:688429715362414641>
Idk why, but this shot just feels weird to me. I can't really say why tho
Because the cute girls deserve to shine clearly
I definitely had to reread that last chapter a few times to get what happened lol
<:KirikaPog:605209108827734017>
Ooh and it looks like vol 9 is releasing next month too
Overall I enjoyed vol 8 a lot. Particularly the last story. I look forward to vol 9 now <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
I never see the plot twists coming in Elaina, then the fucked up stuff hits and im just shocked lol
Well that was still kinda fucked up, but not as fucked up as I'd expect from this series
<:HibikiFingerguns:688429715836502063>
No, Elaina the Ashen Witch
Fenny pls
<:KirikaShout:607741871703457812>
<:HibikiFingerguns:688429715836502063>
because its good
Anime when
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
Looking through upcoming releases in the next few months for some LN/Manga i forgot some of this stuff is getting released
Cmon now, I do read my LNs sometimes
Don't worry, I'll read them eventually™️
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
~~I should probably check out the manga before i read the LN right?~~
I think I've read like 1 chapter of it a long time ago lol
~~Oh hey it's that thing <@297542051057238017>  is always telling me to read~~
It also feels weird to have the LN ahead of the manga, I'm not used to it being like that lol
God damn, Magirevo vol 2 was good. I really hope the ending to that gets adapted because I wanna see it animated so badly now
I remember ep 1 had a solid like 6 minutes of nonstop transformation sequences
That anime, uhh it sure existed <:WHEEZE:977844560510222376>
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
Like, I can't necessarily say I'm surprised after seeing whatever the fuck that was, but still, I wasn't expecting *that*
Yep
So this week's Made in Abyss episode, ||Oh god what the fuck <:KirikaShout:607741871703457812> ||
👀
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
whos gonna fly the plane if there's not even a pilot?
I still have 0 hope until I actually see it, but who knows <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095> If I always expect yuribait then I'm either right or get a nice surprise.
For reference on who that is 👀 👀 👀
Lycoris pls 👀
Now there'd be a good one <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
~~I'm skeptical~~
I just want some actual Yuri anime <:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
Idk what a usual amount of manga chapters an anime would cover is
But
Well, now I guess not
Is it even long enough to do that?
<:ChrisBang:702166093065748500>
<:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
Apparently 'Can't Defy the Lonely Girl' is gonna end soon in a few chapters
the closest i can think of is like Chidori RSC
Was it?
Damn, now I want some cute girls doing archery
I don't think I've ever even heard of a single one of those
||Chisato is totally about to pull a Shem-Ha isn't she? Good thing ~~Hibiki~~ Takina will be there to save her||
So today's Lycoris ep ||Uhh, what the fuck. I'm now extremely worried for Chisato||
<:ChrisDJ:690470897194369034>
I prefer the Madoka ED
~~Okay but kids can totally go on pirate streaming sites tho can't they~~
I guess it depends where you go, I don't think I've seen lycoris spoilers anywhere
honestly a valid strat lol
<:HibikiFingerguns:688429715836502063>
Ditch work, watch Lycoreco
<:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
I mean, they basically do that here xD
I'm not familiar with the rules of soccer. Is karate chopping the ball into the ground a valid play?
The world's situation is improving after the events of sttike witches, maybe they can afford pants now. <:ChrisHehehe:688429717019426821>
I need to catch up on that one. I only watched like 3 eps but I enjoyed it so far.
I see a cute girl 👀
Fenny pls, how you gonna link something this good and it only has one chapter <:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>  Do you just wanna see me suffer
This sounds right up my alley, otome Isekai yuri? <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
<:KirikaShout:607741871703457812>
maybe ill catch up eventually
god damn
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
I decided to read the latest chapter anyway
👀  I forgot about that series
Well that was a fucked up Made in Abyss ep as usual
Yeah, that about sums it up then
Was ep 8 the last one?
<:KirikaPog:605209108827734017>
<a:ChisatoDrive:998524286149066792>
~~technically true~~
her eyes are really pretty 👀
Gotta admit though, ||Out of all the outcomes after the cliffhanger last ep, I really did not see that one coming.  I do wonder where we're headed now though. Majima kidnapping alan institute guy, why tho? To force chisato to do something? Also his briefcase at the end is hella sus, 👀 New heart 👀 I really have no clue where this story is gonna go at this point ||
Just finished the Lycoris ep ||AHHHH FUCKING WHY, THEY BETTER NOT KILL CHISATO. Please no, Don't hurt me like this.  ||
Elaina is very good <:CarolSmug:617040484111745027>
Yeah but like, again, v Me
I do feel like it's definitely gonna be a lot harder to visualize what's going on if I get past the content covered in the anime. I'll have to try and understand what's going on without having something to compare it to lol
I can't imagine anyone topping abs princess ~~Both literally and figuratively 👀~~
Ah, I assumed it covered 3
Oh? Did the anime end after vol 2?
I'll probably at least try to finish vol 1 this weekend
Let's be honest my brain is too smol to understand that anyway
It also does explain a lot of minor things that didn't really make sense in the anime. Like why Menou literally just stood there while the red knight guy was forming for example
<@297542051057238017> ~~I see now what you meant with the scene of stopping the train~~ 👀
Abs princess is very good
<:ShirabeDrool:688429716557791326>
👀
Even if it wasn't necessary I'd still say to watch it because it was a really good movie anyway <:HibikiFingerguns:688429715836502063>
Yeah, there's like two recap movies which aren't, but https://anilist.co/anime/100643/Made-in-Abyss-Dawn-of-the-Deep-Soul/ is necessary
Have you seen the movie?
The only anime i actually kept up with this season are Lycoris, Made in Abyss, and Extreme Hearts
<:HibikiFingerguns:688429715836502063>
Don't worry, I'm consuming cgdct in moderation. I'm only watching like one this season
Can't have a cute girl anime without it
that's a slippery slope of logic there 👀
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
Cypher, justifying sex magic with 1900's occult shit is just making you look even worse
Sorry Cypher, but no context is gonna justify sex magic
<:KirikaDisgust:688431636043268097>
Cypher, what kinda lewd stuff are you reading
||The real heart was the friends we made along the way *Chisato is magically okay now*||
idk anything about gundam <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
A set of ~12 episodes is a season. I reject this cour nonsense.
It's basically S2
Sakana!
👌
ye it came out like a week or two ago
It also feels weird having read the LN and its ahead of the manga
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
There's a new magirevo manga chapter
Oh boy <:MariaScared:672584661125431299>
Maybe by the time i get to vol 3 there'll have been a S2 <:WHEEZE:977844560510222376>
Who knows when I'll read vol 2, ~~Maybe in a few months~~ <:Ver:704169051391524875>
It's mostly just that I'm not thinking too hard when I read stuff lol. Like, thinking about all the stuff with  pure concepts, souls, scriptures, literally colors, etc. And trying to make sense of it all for me is a little much when I'm just casually reading.
I could probably sort it out if I really sat down and tried to figure it all out, but that's too much effort lol
But I also felt like had I not seen the anime first, I would be confused on a lot of things.
It was nice seeing a lot of details that the anime didn't have
<@297542051057238017>
I disagree <:HibikiFingerguns:688429715836502063>
i feel like stuff that runs continuously is a separate thing. But like this whole airing 12 eps one season and then airing another 12 eps a season or two later and still calling it Season 1 is just <:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
There's only a small few VAs I can recognize lol
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
I remember someone saying that, I don't really hear the similarities
It's wholesome
I'm down for it tho
I would've never expected this one to get an anime
https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2022-08-30/konyaku-haki-sareta-reijo-o-hirotta-ore-ga-ikenai-koto-o-oshiekomu-fantasy-slice-of-life-novels-get-/.189167
Sounds like otome Isekai
<:ChisatoHappy:992029824778518659>
Sauce?
👀
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
~~Clearly it's just a clone of Endro~~
oh hey its madoka
GunxSword... So basically just Chris x Tsubasa?
september already, man time flies
I remember general stuff about that anime, but not too much specifically
<:TsubasaNote:689554460044820608>
Lycoris ep 10 ||Damn, good stuff. Takina looking scary as fuck. So majima wants to reveal the lycoris to the population. I was kinda expecting that to happen by the end of the anime anyway tbh. Giving Chisato the dilemma of choosing between Alan institute guy and stopping Majima is an interesting decision. Looks like she didn't think too hard and went to Yoshi anyway, hopefully Takina holds down the fort at the tower well, I trust her. I'm still not entirely positive what kind of end we're building to, but my guess is that Kurumi is gonna coma back outta nowhere and help with stopping robot head hacker guy. Idk about Mizuki's role tbh, I feel like her character hasn't been explored at all so far. Maybe a getaway driver to take Chisato to the tower after she deals with Yoshi? There's gonna be some kinda final confrontation with Majima, Takina, the other Lycoris, and probably chisato and i have no clue how it'll end. I'm excited to see the last few eps.||
Lycoris ep out <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
👀
||Poor Chisato <:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970> ||
I'm just waiting for today's ep, I can't wait to see where this story is gonna go
You're lucky you're watching that ep now tho, imagine the suffering of us who had to see that massive cliffhanger of an ending and wait a week not knowing what was gonna happen
I remember seeing a few people make that comparison xD
time to see if this ep is gonna bring the suffering or not
👀
*Lycrois*
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
But like, Mordred
Question: So, if I wanted to watch Fate/Apocrypha, can I just get right into it without having seen any other Fate stuff? Or do I need to watch something else for context?
||Alan Institute guy new dad||
Mordred is still my favorite, followed by probably Frankenstein, then maybe Jack the Ripper.
Finished the first half of Fate/Apocrypha, interesting stuff so far. I'm still confused on a few here things here and there, but I can follow the story for the most part.
I'm nearly halfway through and I still believe that so far <:CarolSmug:617040484111745027>
I didn't see that one coming
<:KirikaShout:607741871703457812>
When i see some of these characters, the first thing i think of is "Oh hey, I've seen fanart of them" lol
I'm like 2 eps in, but damn she's so cool already
I love her already
<:ShirabeDrool:688429716557791326>
<:KirikaShout:607741871703457812>
I'm nearing the end of Apocrypha, Shakespeare is kinda terrifying lmao
I aspire to one day be as happy as this girl looks eating this sandwich
Finished Fate/Apocrypha. Overall feelings: Honestly kinda meh.
Mordred and her master were the only parts I really enjoyed tbh. Fire lancer guy was pretty cool too. But other than that, I didn't really like much else lol
I made it like halfway through Index S1 and was too bored to continue
<:HibikiFingerguns:688429715836502063>
Nice try Cypher, but you're not gonna get me to watch Index content even if you disguise it as Railgun content
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
Isn't he just an isekai protag at that point
"Man runs in with power nullifying hand and resolves conflict" just wasn't interesting at all to me. I couldn't bring myself to care about Touma at all.
Sword isekai is actually pretty decent <:CarolSmug:617040484111745027>

I've never rated any anime, I wouldn't know
Technically I've finished none of those
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
Imagine having a top 3 LN list. ~~I'd have to actually read 3 LNs first to get there~~
I'll have to watch it when I get home
<:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
Wow rude
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
Mia is like, the embodiment of this meme lol
Yo <@238855496797257729> you seen this?
<:KirikaPog:605209108827734017>
Oh shit
<:MariaScared:672584661125431299>
My man really does *this*
Still gonna watch it anyway tho <:Ver:704169051391524875>
This one is pretty bad even by my standards, and that's saying something <:WHEEZE:977844560510222376>
Oh hey more isekai
https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2022-09-06/am-i-actually-the-strongest-isekai-novels-get-2023-tv-anime/.189399
Especially after how bad s2 was
Wow, did not expect that one
<:ChisatoBloom:995530338723975238>
I can't watch this rn, some cgdct?
👀
I watched like 2 eps of that one and thought it was awful lol
~~Isnt that the goal in death note too?~~
Reminds me of 'My Lesbian Experience With Loneliness'
<:YuuHeart:737647995750973481>
<:doubt:978318046827524136>
who is this guy? lol
Def up there with my favorite made in abyss eps
Just watched the new made in abyss ep. Damn, what an episode
~~Isnt that some harem anime~~
I see, I'll have to check it out when I get home
Lotta suffering?
Doesn't J-Novel Club not do many physical releases?
I know S1 gets a lot of hate, but I thought it was alright. I won't deny s2 sucked tho. I can't imagine why there's a s3

Oh shit <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594> <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594> <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
Gimme an adaptation of some fucked up villainess stuff. I wanna see people expect standard otome isekai and get blindsided by the MC being a fucking psycho and murdering people
<:ElsaSparkles:995847867988181065>
I'm excited because there's a scene I'm looking forward to seeing animated.
I want

that cat feels familiar
<:HibikiFingerguns:688429715836502063>
If I wanted to watch failure, I'd just look in a mirror
I feel like i've seen a similar premise (isekai done, back to earth) a lot lol, is it just the fact that he's old that makes it different?
Is it?
I don't understand the appeal of that one
Hoodies are great
I would steal the hoodie tho
Maybe not that part
Damn I wanna be tied up like that
lmao true
I just watched ep 11 myself, ||Chisato's wife bursting through the wall and coming to the rescue <:ChisatoAh:996051061653639288> ||
oh right that is today
<:ChisatoWhatTheHeck:1001541331178508409>
There are only 2 more eps aren't there?
<:KanaShock:960972275501396038>
I was gonna ping you for that when I saw it yesterday lol
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
you're already on discord at work, it's not a far leap
Ditch work, watch lycoris instead
that's a lot to unpack
God damn, what an episode the new Lycoris ep was
I like Takina in the blue hoodie there
True
<:YuuHyped:762379673816530984>
<:YuTPose:754383071997984818>
~~How much of the live is Yuu tho~~
Unrelated, but new Kimi to Tsuzuru Utakata chapter. <:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
I have not
<:HibikiThink:688429715362414641>
Niji is the best love live tho
Same 😦
<:YuuHeart:737647995750973481>
It's only just some shorts, but I'll take what I can get.
||Yeah, I dunno what will happen, but I don't think itll be them fighting. Tho its not like they can just let him off after killing a ton of lycoris so who knows||
||Honestly I wouldn't be surprised if they don't even fight. Like, Majima just getting beat by Chisato and arrested/somehow killed seems kinda anticlimactic to me. ||
You waiting until its over?
<:ChisatoWhatTheHeck:1001541331178508409>
<:ChisatoBloom:995530338723975238>
reminds me of Mio in the K-On ED

<:ChrisDJ:690470897194369034>
she'd totally put out some bangers
I can't wait to see what OP transformation she pulls out next
hype
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594> <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594> <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
So I was looking at stuff airing next season, hold up what https://anilist.co/anime/139311/Kimi-wo-Aishita-Hitori-no-Boku-e/
One day I'll read that then i can go through all the comments in here that have been spoiler tagged
Damn, I just caught up on last weeks ep and now i really wanna see the end
Ah
Oh wait, was there no made in abyss ep today?
A fellow connoisseur I see
Iski no pls
God damnit
||Pls be okay Chisato <:ChisatoAh:996051061653639288> ||
<:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
Oh right, Lycoris last ep is Saturday
I've seen some good things coming from superstar this season. I need to catch up
For me, like the bare minimum is "Two girls with clearly expressed romantic interest towards one another" which 90% of what people call Yuri just doesn't achieve.
I've said it before, my standards arent even that high
My stance is basically: Would I call it Yuri? No. Is it pretty gay? Yeah.
It's been a good run
<:ChisatoBloom:995530338723975238>
Is the manga less confusing than the anime?
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
Sorry, but I'm not gonna read 7 volumes of adachi to actually get somewhere
Sakura Trick <:TsubasaBliss:672861879000891432>
||Pls be a happy ending, I'm legit gonna cry if they kill off Chisato||
Honestly I'd be kinda surprised if lycoris has a S2, like it really is a great show, but the story feels pretty complete and i fear that they'd just throw a new threat outta nowhere to be the main plot.
<:ChisatoBloom:995530338723975238>
I'm real tempted to watch that but im gonna hold out til tomorrow
<:WHEEZE:977844560510222376>
whats the title?
Lycoris overall tho, definitely my favorite anime I watched this season.
Good finale
torrents like never fuckin work for me lol
Wait no, 9anime pls
Just came up, im going in too
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
I'm still waiting for it <:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
the hell are those titles
<:ChrisPray:672578403156885504>
I believe
pls no
<:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
<:CarolSmug:617040484111745027>
||Now we wait for all the fanfics and fanart||
~~Lilybell Spinoff~~
I don't think there's gonna be anything next season to fill the void Lycoris left <:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
I've seen none of these and I've only even heard of like 3 of them
<:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
They really aren't
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
I'll totally read it eventually tho
i just know it exists
i havent
<:WHEEZE:977844560510222376>
Maybe they'll adapt some of the good ones https://www.webtoons.com/en/challenge/im-an-isekai-hoe/list?title_no=692047
partners indeed

Gimme chisato and takina plushie
<:ChisatoBloom:995530338723975238>
||Mika beating the fuck outta the girl who wrecked Chisato's heart was immensly cathartic <:CarolSmug:617040484111745027>  Best dad indeed.||
Yeah, that's good stuff <:CarolSmug:617040484111745027>
I had to think for a sec what you meant, been awhile since I watched A's.
||I mean, my man was legit like teleporting through the shadows when fighting Chisato. Seems feasible to me. ||
<:YumiPoint:688429724103344164>
I'd be hesitant about a S2 tbh
<:ChisatoBloom:995530338723975238>
Honestly valid
Wait is that the invisible girl?
<:MikuCry:688397678584791074>
Just finished the last made in abyss ep, god damn it this anime always makes me cry
I can't take any of it seriously because its an off brand kyubey and a talking chair
what the hell is this lmao
Yeah, I'd genuinely consider using crunchy I'd they had a better video player than pirate sites lmao
Can't imagine being upset at that lol
I mean sure it could've been actually yuri, but like even without that it was still a really good anime.
<:ChisatoBloom:995530338723975238>
<:HibikiGay:670494484701773845>
I love her so much
👀
<:ChisatoBloom:995530338723975238>
<:CarolSmug:617040484111745027>
Is that cute girls I see 👀
the future looking bright i see
Oh damn, I need to catch up on stuff that's starting this season. I've only started like 1 thing lol

Mel pls
<a:ShirabeBonk:801207951645605958>
I didn't expect the anime to actually be that quality, I'm used to the usual quality for isekai xD
i mean ive read it yeah
I was not expecting it to actually be good lmao
Aight just watched the eminence in shadow ep, yo what the fuck that was actually a banger
ayo I expected cute girls, what the hell is this beginning<:KirikaShout:607741871703457812>  https://anilist.co/anime/139369/Management-of-a-Novice-Alchemist/
<:CarolSmug:617040484111745027>
<:ShirabeDrool:688429716557791326>

I mean vol 7 does look like it has something going for it now that i look at it
<:ShirabeDrool:688429716557791326>
I could ask for the abs princess
~~you say that but it doesnt seem as lewd as the other ones...~~
~~Maybe I'll buy it~~
That's one anime I don't understand the appeal of
pretty much every season
Just finished the Bocchi the Rock episode, honestly i really enjoyed it. Definitely feels like it's gonna be one of my favorites this season.
Panzer Vor!
<:MariaScared:672584661125431299>
Cotton candy hair
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
Nowhere, that's where I expect it to go tbh
That's the real question
Yeah, I've seen that. But does it actually go anywhere tho
Idk about Gundam lol
I'll probably watch it tomorrow
<:TsubasaNote:689554460044820608>
I need to watch that one, haven't gotten around to it yet
I  definitely think it's well done so far, it's a bit above the quality of the usual cgdct imo.
<:YuuHeart:737647995750973481>
~~I still wanna believe in the dream of Yuu getting a song at some point~~
<:RinaPout:655230379648614411>
Also, Niji movie when
I haven't even finished S1 lol
<:ChrisEating:384879395829186560>
Also, <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594> I'm hyped
I mean, on one hand I could probably put out an essay, but in the other hand my writing skills do suck
<:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
Tempting, but doesn't J-novel club also like never do physical releases?
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
I've heard of that one but no nothing about it beyond the name
<a:KasuHehe:626072698501464084>
Fair, Love live does have 2 movies now that i think about it
Love Live? xD
I mean, makes sense
now put it in the anime and ill watch it
I really enjoyed bocchi, now I have high hopes for when I watch it lol
I really need to
I still haven't watched that one yet
Is that cute girls I see
👀
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
I mean, the cover is certainly interesting
<:ChrisPray:672578403156885504>
Rip to all those titles that won't get a physical release
Arisa is probably my favorite
Managed to finish all of Bandori S1 in the time I've been waiting for my flights at airports lol. Good stuff <:CarolSmug:617040484111745027>
I'm still not used to all the days stuff comes out this season yet
Oh was bocchi today? I gotta watch that at some point
It really do be like that
Ep 2 for Bocchi was really good. Bocchi is relatable af
Yeah, I feel like you could totally have "kid sees robot and falls in love with them" and see the same result
Clearly the only way anyone can have any new ideas in anime is if they come from another world. The natives of the anime world's aren't capable of innovation.
Pls no
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
My friend is making me watch guilty crown and I'm a little drunk, I'm so confused <:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
~~Level 100 Bocchi is hot~~
Most of the time I was watching bocchi, I was thinking "Yeah I've totally done/thought that" it truly is relatable af lol
<:WHEEZE:977844560510222376>
Watched the first ep of the ghost stories dub, what a banger lmao
Maybe I'll check out the LN for that at some point. Because I remember the WN translation I read being bad.
I think I only really remember reading the WN for it and some of the manga which wasn't too well translated. So I don't remember much
Was that one yuri?
Like what?
Asumi-chan anime would be amazing
As far as Yuri I'd want to see an anime of, yagakimi S2 is probably at the top of the list of things I'd want
In our dreams
<:HibikiGay:670494484701773845>
I bought some real gay
Yeah, I'd probably agree with ya there
Finished Guilty Crown, big Code Geass vibes lol
Yeah, that's pretty fair. The movie was really good imo. S2 had its moments, but overall was just okay
Finished watching the made in abyss movie with my friend, his response was just "That was fucked up" lmao
Then you can read an essay on my thoughts as I read xD
Like I've said, lemme know when it ends and I will
You're tempting me there
Lookin like a classified document in here
<:15min:406862587657977866>
Time to spam comment asking about it in twitch chat when they finish announcing stuff then <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
they havent said anything about xv right?
<:WHEEZE:977844560510222376>
i was watching a few eps with my friend when i visited him, top quality content
the dub is the only version that matters
The same thing happened with GX, I got that shipped like over a month early
Quality, that's what it is
Oh right, I did completely forget about the Wii, I played that one a ton
Physical video media holds no value to me other than being used as shelf decor
The only console I've ever really played is like the SNES lmao
Nope
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
Why would I take them out, I don't even have a Blu ray player
<:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
I need to finish the collection tho
XV when tho
Bocchi the super relatable protagonist
Out of the stuff I'm watching this season, I agree with that. Those OPs are bangers.
oh right, i still need to watch that
Also, props to whoever subbed this <:WHEEZE:977844560510222376>
Bocchi is definitely my favorite anime this season so far
<:WHEEZE:977844560510222376>
I totally get what you mean now
Just finished that ep,
Speaking of Bocchi, I just started the ep and was reminded again how good that OP is. Those vocals tho <:TsubasaBliss:672861879000891432>
pizza girl good
good stuff
<:KitaSmile:1019602007948005458>
<:BocchiBless:1030926913704820856>
<a:NijikaRave:1035177024102342756>
Bocchi emotes? <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
I see
<:TsubasaNote:689554460044820608>
So the normal mechs are "mobile suits" but Gundams are something more special? Is that about right?
On the topic of that meme, I thought all the mechs were gundams. Is that not how it works?
Maybe it'll actually explain things xD
I see, I'll probably watch that soon then
I didn't, was I supposed to? I noticed it in the sidebar after i was a few eps in but since i had already started just said screw it and didnt go back for it.
Finished up to ep 5. Gimme more gay, that's my verdict so far.
<:ChrisDJ:690470897194369034>
Also, damn the OP and ED are both bangers
It's hard to explain what I thought, but I guess I didn't expect Miorine to be so like *aggressive* and Suletta to be so *meek* if i had to put it into words.
Since all i've seen are screencaps and fanart, I feel like the voices and actions of Suletta and Miorine are completely different than how I imagined them lol.
same vibe
~~What a cool looking robot~~
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
Listen, not my fault the anime wasn't clear on it
<:WHEEZE:977844560510222376>
Exactly my thoughts, I know nothing about gundam, and don't really care much to either. This show exists in its own bubble for me
as long as they can be gay on top of the piles of dead bodies
fuck politics, gimme the gay
This is the best you're gonna get
gimme some more zenryoku zenkai
rip
oh wait, i thought that was a recent tweet lol
👀 👀 👀
honestly gimme more vivid strike instead
yeah hasn't that existed for awhile
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
Not something I could ever understand
<:TsubasaNote:689554460044820608>
I see, I see
Why bother with recaps when I can basically watch the whole season in that amount of time with how short those eps were xD
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
Maybe I'll watch it tonight in that case
Is yama still doing recap or are they on new stuff now
<:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
There's also a new manga chapter for eminence that dropped today 👀
Yo why was that ep so good lmao. that anime has been more quality than i'd have expected
<:ChisatoBloom:995530338723975238>
Kaos my beloved
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
That was announced quite awhile ago I think
Yeah i'm just going off of the anime
relatable
I mean thats just a random illustration from the novel, i have no clue where that pic is from
no idea
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
Huh, dope
Wait was it?
I wanna read the novel for violet evergarden at some point because apparently she's got a giant fuckin axe in that one
Also, I question calling otherside Yuri, but <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
The fact that aquatope is centered around two girls in an aquarium, but isn't gay is a tragedy
The dams <:WHEEZE:977844560510222376>
<:ChrisDJ:690470897194369034>
Some of the 3D was a little weird during it, but the song itself and the performance were really good
<:TsubasaBliss:672861879000891432>
Just finished the bocchi ep
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
Isn't that the powerpoint one?
24 eps but will there be gay. That's the real question
Oh is that one gonna be 2 cour?
I feel like the odds are super low for that, but I'd gladly welcome it
Bocchi getting a new photo to plaster her walls and ceiling with I see.
I'm already loving this anime so much and it isn't even halfway done yet
<:BocchiDyingInside:928085859180367872>
I could totally see her doing it too
so i can click all of these
Time to go watch the G-witch ep
Uma Musume went from "S1 was meh, why are they making a S2" to "Damn S2 was great, gimme a S3"
What great news to wake up to
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594> <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594> <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
||Make sure to like and subscribe!||
reminds me of that pic showing how to do the maria hair
Ah
2 weeks?
The songs really are bangers
<:KirikaShout:607741871703457812>
Just finished the G-Witch ep, that was sure fuckin something
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
I mean, it's a pretty small space in there
I really hope we get some more Suletta/Miorine interactions in the anime, idc about the gundams that's what I'm really here for
<:CarolSmug:617040484111745027>
I thought the prologue would give more background for what's going on in the anime, but I'm just left with more questions now
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
On the topic of G-Witch, I just watched the prologue and feel even more confused now
I've learned to not get my hopes up for anything to be yuri until it actually happens.
That's my expectation tbh
<:BocchiStare:1037552903344365598>
That face tho
<:WHEEZE:977844560510222376>

Oh god
<:ShirabeDrool:688429716557791326>
she's even got gardening tools!
||Yo she gets a spear? Dope||
I remember seeing that one in theaters
That's the first progressive movie right?
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
oh shit yuru camp movie
It's crazy how "Certified Scrum master" sounds super fake but is apparently a real thing lmao
Big sad, she's my favorite from G-Witch, though I guess it makes sense since she barely gets any screentime
<:KitaPray:1034992316378796062>
Bocchi too
I'm surprised Suletta and Miorine are so far apart
<:BocchiStare:1037552903344365598>
<:KanaOooo:960972275715276900>
I don't think I want details
<:KirikaShout:607741871703457812>
<:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
It feels like any Yuri that gets an anime never actually gets to the Yuri.
Rip
I feel like I gotta ask, how much Yuri actually is there?
manga art is so good
a tragedy
yeah im kinda sad they used the LN art style where all the characters look young af
I dunno how I feel about what I've seen from the Magirevo anime so far, but I'm definitely looking forward to it
I mean, unless I'm just blind, Menou didn't really seem romantically interested in Akari. The other way around sure.
You say that, but like my standards aren't high at all. Like,  "*Two girls with clearly expressed romantic interest in one another*" is a pretty low standard that most Yuri doesn't clear.
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
i watched it on 9anime
<:BocchiSparkle:1019865896266768385>
Today's bocchi ep was great as usual
I'm genuinely surprised how much I've been enjoying bocchi. At first it was just "Oh hey another cute girl thing is getting an anime" but now? The animation, the writing, the songs, the quality is impressive af.
I'll prob read it all when the anime is done
I remember reading a few of the manga chapters a long time ago, but dont really remember anything from them which makes watching the anime kinda nice not knowing whats next.
Girls gardening? Where can I read it? <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
So is this a like dystopian future where amazon is everywhere with all the delivery drones and smart home products?
<:yui_oop:814114831153496074>
MC gives off Yui vibes
<@278860841485598720> I started the DIY anime, this has such a weird vibe lol
On the topic of bocchi, can we talk about how good these two looked in today's ep
<a:BocchiSlime:1032058311610216469>
Iris and Kate tho
<:BocchiSparkle:1019865896266768385>
<:BocchiDyingInside:928085859180367872>
mood
i mean its not like its the men part she's opposed to is it? It's marrying someone against her will
So far its just gayness in name only. No actual actions have been taken
all the outfits are so good
Us poor souls who watched it when it was airing had to suffer for a week not knowing where the hell we were going after ep 8
~~Yet Aquatope somehow managed 2 seasons in an aquarium with no yuri~~
<:ChisatoBloom:995530338723975238>
<:NijikaWha:1031536034963533904>
I wonder when that'll be in US theaters
Kurumi steals the show in that second video
<:TakinaSakana1:1006490645294235708><:TakinaSakana2:1006490648557400124>
takina protecc
<:ChisatoBloom:995530338723975238>
I trust her
she'll definitely pay you back tho
<:RyoUwu:1030808154604310548>
Ryo is good indeed
<:KitaDeathstare:1036044274782969866>
<:CarolSmug:617040484111745027>
I ended up going to a mcdonalds for food instead because i can just order in the app and i don't have to interact with anyone.
Literally this past weekend i was gonna go to a restaurant but after walking by it, I realized it was a sit down place and couldn't bring myself to walk in because i'd feel too awkward being there by myself.
"How do people normally enter a restaurant" is a valid question I've thought before. Like, just walking in? How does that even work
||I mean, they've killed off one man already, the odds are looking good||
Grassley Defense Systems:
genuinely a helpful chart, ima save that and keep it in mind lol
<a:NijikaRave:1035177024102342756>
Yo this is kinda a banger
<:comf:815254068884799488>
Being comf and watching some yuru camp is always a good time. I usually do that sometime in the winter, get all nice and cozy with a blanket and have some tea while watching some wholesome cute girls camping.
<:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
im hoping the movie will be in theaters
had to open discord in a browser, pull the image with inspect element, then run it through google image search lmao
Just for the memes i put in way too much effort to track that down lol

<:CarolSmug:617040484111745027>
i dont remember much about that movie except for remembering that Inori Minase voiced a character

<:KirikaPog:605209108827734017>
Antarctica <:KirikaPog:605209108827734017>
what the fuck lmao thats great
That's a bit out there even by my standards lmao https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2022-11-19/j-novel-club-licenses-4-new-light-novels-3-new-manga/.192027
<:HibikiGay:670494484701773845>
That's a good one
Also, damn that was a wild journey on today's Bocchi ep lmao
I got the full set of gay now <:HibikiGay:670494484701773845>
I remember everyone being confused every week when it was airing
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
So I decided to watch ep 1 of Gekidol randomly. What the hell is going on lmao
Panzer Vor!
<:ShirabeDrool:688429716557791326>
Now the real question, where's all the fanart of her in that outfit at
Also, god damn miorine lookin good
That was an interesting G-Witch ep
<:HanaDisgust:698332112108912670>
Also why is there so much creepy shit going on so far
<:WHEEZE:977844560510222376>
at this point they could pull the "Seria was in a coma the whole time and none of whats happening is real" card and I would accept that as normal.
I have 0 idea where this is going
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
Finished ep 4 of Gekidol, what the fuck is this anime even lmao
This girl is a child,  i did not expect that
<:KirikaShout:607741871703457812>
<:HibikiThink:688429715362414641>
Wait, I thought this was idol <:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
I'm still trying to figure out what's even real at this point xD
They fit them so well lol
Miorine's got the spirit, Suletta needs to step up now
just gimme some gay already damn it
I don't think i know like literally anything about the authors of LNs/manga i read
That's entirely possible xD
<:HibikiThink:688429715362414641>
Wait really? I didn't know that
Also, I'm gonna take this chance while it's on topic to shill for the magirevo manga once again. Such good art <:TsubasaBliss:672861879000891432>
That reminds me, Magirevo vol 3 is out in december
From what I've heard about that one, it seems a bit complicated
Like I said, I do read a lotta Isekai but it's like 99% either guy with harem, or girls <:HibikiGay:670494484701773845>
xD
Hmmm, none immediately come to mind for me. But I also dunno if I'd really read that kinda Isekai if it's out there
We talking anime? Manga?
Rip, so no theater release then I imagine
Didn't it release on Crunchyroll or something
Oh yeah that's out now isn't it
The Haifuri movie wasnt the greatest, but it had it's moments imo
Seeing the MC look so young, I do wonder if that'll detract from some of the more serious moments at all
I really want the Magirevo adaptation to be good but I don't know how I feel about what I've seen so far
Gotta admit, that's a new idea
https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2022-11-25/tatsunoko-pro-reveals-original-pole-dancing-anime-pole-princess/.192277
I've heard the manga has some ***suffering***
Also, after today's ep. Bocchi x Nijika. I support it <:CarolSmug:617040484111745027>
<:KitaPray:1034992316378796062>
Gimme that S2
<:BocchiDistraught:931659783554089031>
Also, realizing we're at ep 8/12. Only 4 more eps of bocchi.
yo what a good fucking bocchi episode
i think ive only seen like 1 chinese anime
but there's a ton of them from what im seeing
apparently its an ONA so like 5-8 min episodes
<:HibikiThink:688429715362414641>
wait apparently its a lot more?
And it has 90 episodes apparently? wtf lol
Bocchi really is absolutely killing it this season
gimme a bocchi neso
xD
Now when can i buy it <:BocchiSparkle:1019865896266768385>
||Kita not Nijika <:KitaSmile:1019602007948005458> ||
||Honestly i interpreted it more as Kita being surprised/maybe kinda envious of Bocchi's skills. Like are we gonna see her be all sad and "Oh am I even needed here when they've got bocchi and her skills". ||
Kita sure stealing a lotta glances over at bocchi 👀
<:KitaPray:1034992316378796062>
gotta be comf to watch yuru camp
Is there gonna be any Yuri tho
I gotta order vol 3 of those soon that reminds me
Yes
Took me a sec to realize what you meant xD
I need to catch up on G-Witch, I'm an ep or two behind I think
Bocchi being at the top of the charts is well deserved. <:BocchiSparkle:1019865896266768385>
<:KitaSmile:1019602007948005458>
I remember reading the summary for that one, it sounds like the kinda thing that it takes forever to actually get to a relationship (if they even get there)
Poor Bocchi
Every time i see that one, I always think of this tweet
i wonder if we'll see a slow loop cameo in the bocchi anime
Theres a slow loop cameo in the bocchi manga too iirc
Fantastic bocchi ep as usual, ||Glad to see Kita and Ryo getting some spotlight this ep, because they're hilarious.||
I like how for some of these I can immediately recognize the art style <:HibikiGay:670494484701773845>
I do get the point of covering the chat in spoilers being not ideal though
I mean it would feel a little weird if we couldn't talk about currently airing anime in <#371105434771390465> since it'd all be spoilers that had to go in <#377148557796442134>
i think im 2 eps behind
I need to catch up on G-Witch
Honestly I don't even remember that much from it
I mean, I'd take a S2 of some actual Yuri any day, no matter how trash it may be xD
Art
true
<:WHEEZE:977844560510222376>
👀
<:KitaSparkles:1049039907659714570>
Also, as usual, they totally killed it with the performance in this ep.
Oh hey, we did end up getting the reference in the new bocchi ep
<:KirikaShout:607741871703457812>
I remember reading a description somewhere,
Panzer Vor!
<a:BocchiDetermined:1047412826567872563>
Can't wait to read it when I get home
On the topic of Yuri tho, Magirevo Vol 3 out today. <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594> <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594> <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
It's been awhile since I read vol 1 and 2, but I feel like I remember it being pretty exposition heavy. Maybe I'm just misremembering tho
I'd be surprised if they even get to the Yuri
Because I already love both the LN and Manga and would sad if the anime was rough
I really hope the anime delivers well
Yep, it dropped today
<:GenjuroThumbsUp:336657189475188740>
Anyways, Vol 3, great stuff. Highly recommend
||It doesn't happen in Vol 2 sadly||
<a:HibikiAniThreeSeconds:836580813474103326>
I'd definitely consider it one of my favorite series at this point.
Just finished Vol 3 for the Magirevo LN. God damn that was good
Ah
Oh shit, is that a new chapter?
Because it was a banger and apparently isn't gonna be available for awhile
well except for the song in the last episode sadly
<a:BocchiRocking:1036245244846538792>
I'm slightly tempted to buy ghost stories lol
which reminds me vol 1 came out recently as a physical release, just ordered that <:CarolSmug:617040484111745027>
<:HibikiGay:670494484701773845>
I want an asumi-chan adaptation
yeah it's definitely 100% all of those
<:ChisatoCopium:996413695246749726>
I choose to believe that there we'll get a S2 and there will be plenty more bocchi Saturdays
the anticipation is killing me
Damn the bocchi ending
<:YumiPoint:688429724103344164>
I mean there is 'Becoming Princess Knight and Working at Yuri Brothel ' which exists and fits the description xD
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
I feel like I'm slowly increasing the collection of lewd Yuri I own
All the scenes in bocchi with anything other than the traditional animation are always hilarious lol
Sadly not everything,I do read a fair bit there tho lol
<:HibikiThink:688429715362414641>
How Yuri is it though 👀 that's what I really wanna know. Are they actually in a relationship?
Don't think I've heard of this one
👀
<:HibikiGay:670494484701773845>
I finally have the full collection
Don't worry, I already know the spoilers since I'm caught up with the English TLed source material. I'm waiting until it actually is supposed to air to watch it tho
I was interested for the first cour, but the second was pretty meh to me
Rei having a good time there I see
true xD
just watched the bocchi ep, good stuff though I will say that ||I am kinda sad we didn't get to see bocchi just fuckin shred that guitar in front of everyone||
Now that the anime is over i read the bocchi manga, damn i want a S2
It's definitely up there
Damn looking at next season there's a lotta anime i'm excited for
lmao theres a whole website
It was off hiatus?
God damn that's surprising
<:KitaSmile:1019602007948005458>
Bocchi x Kita
Wow, big oof
I think I remember seeing that on anilist if it's what I'm thinking of
It's even got the lilies lol
Looking at anilist, I didn't watch too much this year. my favorites would probably have to be like bocchi, lycoris, or made in abyss
It is a fantastic story tho tbf
If someone adapted Two as one Princesses, then they'd have to adapt the starting few chapters <:MariaScared:672584661125431299>
I wonder how common english publishers picking up stuff that just had an anime is
does bocchi have any english physical releases?
damn thats a big brain strat lol
arent they gonna do a bunch of reprints?
I didn't realize that Eminence in Shadow is 20 eps for some weird reason and was excited to see the conclusion of the fight only realize that they'll get there next ep <:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
Also, speaking of the bocchi music, I just got some good stuff in the mail <a:BocchiDetermined:1047412826567872563>
The bocchi soundtrack really does go hard. The fact that the anime managed to maintain a good quality to the end and had several banger songs is impressive af.
Interesting choice
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
I see, don't think we've had cute girls doing that sport yet
I see cute girls, but what are they doing?
👀
👀
~~Gimme a new railgun anime pls~~
What psychopath gave bocchi a 1?
https://anilist.co/anime/107663/ASTRA-LOST-IN-SPACE/ I prefer this amongus anime tho
am i wrong tho
among us anime
Having not watched that much this year, I'd honestly probably put bocchi or Lycoris on top for me. Simply because they were the anime that ,every week, I was excited and looking forward to the next episode. Most other anime are just "Oh it's Saturday, guess I'll watch this one that released today"  But I also have some CGDCT bias anyway <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
<:KirikaPog:605209108827734017>
My favorite description to use for it lol
Yeah there's nothing super stand out about it, but I do think it tells a pretty good story
The manga and LN are both really good, so I'm praying the anime is good too
(I know ep 1 already had a pre-air but I'm waiting for the official start)
Magirevo airing in a few days, I'm hyped
<:wakarimasu:476452770682241062>
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
I remember watching 1 ep of that and was immensely confused
I just dont like em because they license a lot of series, but almost never do physical copies
eww J-Novel Club
sauce?
👀
<:HonkBread:715458424854282370>
https://tenor.com/view/bocchi-bocchi-the-rock-non-linear-gif-27023528
That's a fair review
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
oh man i havent thought about that show in forever
I can't wait to get home so I can watch Magirevo <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
Spongebob is my favorite anime https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBO9ANTBCjM
Magirevo airs tomorrow
<:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
Hmmmm, Just watched the Magirevo ep. Honestly I have mixed feelings I really do want to like it, but there's a lot I'm not sure about.
I really want the Magirevo anime to be good
Tilty has such a great design
I mean it certainly didn't seem like it would be remotely like harem stuff at all from what I watched at least.
Well, there's like 7 girls and the main character(?) is named Lily so who knows
Yo the first ep of Spy Classroom was unexpectedly good. I'm looking forward to this one more than I thought I'd be.
I got mine last week, bocchi good
<:KitaPray:1034992316378796062>
Maybe I should rewatch StrikerS one day, I feel like there's a lot i've forgotten
I was about to say I coulda sworn that was 2022
That anime was on my list of stuff I was interested in this season, but I wasn't sure if I was gonna watch it. Maybe I'll check it out now
"I'm cute?"
👀
one of these days ill dive into precure
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
cute girls i see
I'm waiting for more eps to see if my judgement still holds up
🤷‍♀️
I'm still hesitant on the magirevo anime
<:ChrisHehehe:688429717019426821>
Fantasy? Without isekai? Idk doesn't seem like it'd work to me
Ah ep 8, the *Befriending*
I'm pretty sure i'm gonna finish like half of what im watching, but the other half i may drop
I forgot there were still some more anime that haven't aired yet this season that i was gonna watch <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
Anilist
that reminds me i need to check out sugar apple fairy tale
~~Most of them are isekai xD~~
I wonder how many of these I'm gonna drop <:Ver:704169051391524875>
I'm down for this, villainess is cute af
Yo the music when Lieselotte appears is such a banger lol
ye
<:WHEEZE:977844560510222376>
Like every fantasy anime
Yo why is the animation for cute girl judo this good lol
If only <:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
Hmm, guess I've just seen the pic before and not the anime
i swear ive seen that before, sauce?
I remember seeing there was a gay couple in D4DJ, is that in the anime? Or was that just a mobile game thing.
I disagree
Is that D4DJ?
Thought it was a S2 lol
I was hyped for a split second when I saw that post....
<:ChisatoBloom:995530338723975238>
The list grows
<:CarolSmug:617040484111745027>
Also, I just noticed, Anis doesn't have the little crosses on her hair ribbons in the anime

Yeah Anis being gay as fuck is made very clear
https://anilist.co/anime/153629/The-Magical-Revolution-of-the-Reincarnated-Princess-and-the-Genius-Young-Lady/
also seeing "thaumaturgy" is weird
As a side note tho with today having Bofuri coming out, I've now started everything that I was planning on checking out this season. Spy Classroom and Endo and Kobayashi were better than I was expecting (since I didn't really have any expectations going in). Bofuri looks like it's gonna be fun like S1 was. Magirevo I'm still tentative on so I'll have to see how it goes. But other than that the normal fantasy/isekai stuff is about what i expected.
the smug face is pretty damn good i'll give it that
Also, the manga continues to be superior as the anime didn't have Anis's harem
I still have mixed feelings on the magirevo anime after ep 2,  the pacing feels a bit quick and i feel like some stuff if gonna end up skipped.
I'm a big fan of the story itself and the manga art is very well done imo
Yeah the LN and manga are both really good.
Oh hey, RightStuf finally decided to ship vol 9 of Elaina when i was supposed to get it at the start of october. better late than never i guess
As a scientist, I can say that a sample size of 2 isn't very meaningful  <:CarolSmug:617040484111745027>
I could jam to that\
<:ChrisDJ:690470897194369034>
maybe ill check it out
oh hey i saw that one when i was looking through manga the other day
~~Idk who that is, but he deserved better (probably)~~
Nooo! Not Papa-Meow!
<:KirikaPog:605209108827734017> <:KirikaPog:605209108827734017> <:KirikaPog:605209108827734017>

<:ChrisDJ:690470897194369034>
I'd totally be down for getting physical copies of Nanoha.
<:CarolSmug:617040484111745027>
I agree with Kobayashi regarding my thoughts on this anime so far...

<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
So, Ayakashi Triangle. Damn Suzu is thirsty
I remember seeing  a post with some details about the bullets from the book https://www.reddit.com/r/LycorisRecoil/comments/x9o85v/spoiler_a_bit_more_details_about_chisatos_bullets/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf
<:CarolSmug:617040484111745027>
There have been some gay stories
A fine addition to the collection <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
<:WHEEZE:977844560510222376>
So do I gotta go through like Buyee if I want the bocchi plushies?
<:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
So how would  one go about obtaining these Bocchis?
I want them!
<:BocchiSparkle:1019865896266768385>
I wonder if vol 4 of the manga will ever get released at some point.
I enjoyed it, I just never got around to watching the rest
Half of S1
I watched like half of it
I still need to finish Superstar
Both had really good eps
Bofuri S2 ep 2 ||Poor Sally, I feel bad for the girl lol. Also, Maple please, you're an angel sitting on a throne while riding a flying turtle <:WHEEZE:977844560510222376> ||
I really liked today's magirevo episode. Euphie and Ilia were portrayed really well imo
<:MariaScared:672584661125431299>
If by end up together you mean end up together romantically then yeah it is. The confession isn't really the important part.
So two girls confess their love to another girl? I mean, if it's not reciprocated then 🤷‍♀️ If they confess to each other then yeah
I've made my stance before: Yuri requires two girls with clearly expressed romantic interest towards one another. One sided loves do not count.
xD
Plus a one sided statement like that doesn't make it Yuri, it's gotta also be reciprocated.
<:CarolSmug:617040484111745027>
I see some cute girls
👀
^ What hit Honoka
https://tenor.com/view/love-live-umi-sonoda-umi-sonoda-love-gif-18751675
<:HibikiThink:688429715362414641>
Can any school idol really be better than Honoka
Isn't OniMai from the same studio that did Mushoku Tensei? xD
Yeah I totally want a full version of that because it was a banger
Rip
I did my part <:KirikaSalute:620069889838809089>
I do hope this popularity encourages a S2. I'd absolutely love to see more Bocchi.
Bocchi finally achieved her dreams of becoming popular enough to make money from her band
Oh damn I didn't realize that was in theaters. I'll have to go see that
Anemone you say? https://dynasty-scans.com/series/anemone_is_in_heat
As much as i would love that, sadly there's basically 0 chance of that
<:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
Rip, I was enjoying that one too
<:BocchiSparkle:1019865896266768385>
Maple's form that ep was hilarious
<:CarolSmug:617040484111745027>
Cute
no wonder the art seemed so familiar
i like the art, they look really cute <:CarolSmug:617040484111745027>
Rip no Nanoha S1, A's or StrikerS
cultured anime
and I'm 100% down for it
Absolutely

Lmao bofuri S2 ep 4 ||Poor Sally||
Magirevo had a pretty damn good ep this week
I remember that being my reaction as well lol
I'll have to read them later
👀
How gay is it tho
Made in abyss is one of my favorite anime series
<:wakarimasu:476452770682241062>
A fellow cultured individual I see. <:CarolSmug:617040484111745027>
It's nice to compare the anime and the movie. Like with the 1st movie/season, i kinda liked seeing all the side stuff in the anime which the movie didnt really have, but i also gotta say that the movie had some really good animation. That starlight breaker tho <:KirikaPog:605209108827734017>
i should watch the 2nd nanoha movie at some point. think thats the only one i havent seen in the nanoha franchise
I've got mixed feelings on anime Anis
I'm kinda sad about it
I feel like the magirevo anime is skipping a lot to cover more content, im pretty sure this recent episode was like half of LN vol 2
Ah I see, i haven't looked in here today xD

https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2023-02-11/lycoris-recoil-anime-gets-new-animation-project/.194781
How drivers where I live view all traffic lights.
Wonder if that means releases will get any faster
Alright, I managed to google translate my way through ordering it xD
time to google translate my way through the checkout process
I still have some hope for yuri with magirevo this season, with the pacing they're going at (too quick imo) we'll prob get LN vol 3 stuff which includes ||Anis getting topped by Euphie <:HibikiGay:670494484701773845> || (Magirevo LN3 spoils)
Rip
Is it actually yuri tho
I see girls
👀
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
I wasn't too into it, but maybe ill give the anime a few eps
I remember reading a bit of the manga for that one
I think Ilia and Tilty are probably my favorite from the magirevo anime. I'm honestly not liking Anis and Euphie that much in the adaptation.
god damn
Yo what the hell, that last Eminence in Shadow ep was such a banger
<:BocchiStare:1037552903344365598>
Well deserved because they're all bangers
<:ChisatoBloom:995530338723975238>
Both very good
yeah the big one is the LN and the smol one is the manga
Quality 👍
I'm a big fan of the Magirevo LN/Manga. Definitely up there on my favorite series
Vol 3 is probably my favorite so far
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
She's great
https://tenor.com/view/anis-magirevo-tenten-tensei-oujo-to-tensai-reijou-no-mahou-kakumei-mahou-kakumei-gif-27392376
My favorite volume so far ||Not just for the gay but also because I really liked seeing Anis's basically breakdown over her identity. It was well written imo.||
I feel like Magirevo could very loosely be considered villainess. It does hit on some of the tropes but also lacks a lot of them. Great Manga/LN tho 👌
I mean, I was moreso thinking of manga. I've heard mixed things about the IFTV manga.
I can't even think of much gay villainess stuff off the top of my head. The only one that comes to mind is https://mangadex.org/title/8b34f37a-0181-4f0b-8ce3-01217e9a602c/please-bully-me-miss-villainess
Eminence was surprisingly good compared to what you'd expect from the usual isekai adaptation
<:KirikaPog:605209108827734017>
Yeah don't remember that but I like it <:CarolSmug:617040484111745027>
I'm not a huge fan of the adaptation personally, but I know a lot of others like it
I feel like I don't remember that song and only vaguely remember that scene. I should rewatch YagaKimi at some point, it's been awhile since ive seen some quality yuri
https://tenor.com/view/im-doing-my-part-serious-stare-gif-11979677

~~Maybe if we play it enough we can get a S2~~
Huh, interesting
Is hectopascal an easy song? Maybe thats why
The second one sounds like it's an ED for some idol anime lol
the only music i remember from YagaKimi is the ED. Which is, to be fair, a banger
<:HibikiGay:670494484701773845>
Ooh, I didn't expect married my female friend to get a physical release
God damn, Algard and Anis's VA absolutely killed it in the new MagiRevo ep
Oh damn more horsies!
I wonder how many eps it'll be
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
Like I said earlier, both the girls are really cute
So that means all three of FUNA's works have gotten anime adaptations now lol
Oh damn https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2023-02-24/i-shall-survive-using-potions-novels-get-tv-anime-starring-rin-kusumi/.195248
Idk, I just wasn't into it 🤷‍♀️
Man I sure started a lot of anime I didn't finish lol
<a:AlySweats:770160546041167885>
Just read it, damn she hot
So I decided to check  out the airing Precure out of curiosity. My thoughts so far, Sora is cute <:CarolSmug:617040484111745027>
Those three are probably what I would have considered my top anime of the year from what I watched.
Nanoha blasting the hell out of stuff is always quality
Ah yes, mayonnaise. Can't have an isekai without that
<:BocchiSparkle:1019865896266768385>
Bocchi up top I see
prob closer to like 7 hours a week. I  i assume an ep is like 20 mins on average
mine looks like a lot but im prob not gonna finish most of em and only end up completing like 4 or 5 lol
<a:BocchiHide:1029896994631716905>
<:WHEEZE:977844560510222376>
Also I just realized, wouldn't this be considered isekai xD
This is the first precure i've seen so I wouldn't know xD
<:ChrisDJ:690470897194369034>
Also, this OP is a banger
Ah, rip https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Combustion_Man he shoots explosions form his third eye lol
Also, I can't help but think of this guy from Avatar whan i see the pig dude lmao
The song is a banger, but that animation is also really cool
I saw the name "Kasumi" and thought you were posting Love Live stuff for a sec lol
That is quite cute
Hibiki's very first transformation is still my favorite from the whole series. It's just so damn cool
Now I wanna rewatch S1
Yeah all of the instrumentals that play every so often are always nice to listen to
O shit that one's great
I don't even think of the gear OP's as openings. I always just think of them as inserts because I remember when they played in the episode.
That reminds me, I gotta get around to watching code geass eventually
<:ChrisDJ:690470897194369034>
Sorry Bill Wurtz, Ciel is the only princess I'm interested in
<:ChrisDJ:690470897194369034>
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
It feels really weird hearing it in German, but I did like it. Although we all know the best german symphogear song right Ikxi?
<:TonyEyeRoll:580561912513691679>
It's a banger tho 👌
Are you spreading more love live propaganda nova?
Sounds like something you'd do
I never would've guessed
That one's a banger 👍
I've never looked into the world of love live fanfics, how is that scene?
Ah is that its name?
I mean there is that one cat she seems pretty friendly with, so maybe?
Actually, better yet is it really Rina if she's not wearing a cardboard box? <:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
Is it really Rina if she doesn't have the board though?
I didn't even recognize Rina with that hairstyle lol
Whenever I see that thumbnail it reminds me of Sally from Bofuri for a sec
I like her but I can't say I'd be that fanatical
From what I've seen so far none of them really pique my interest, but I suppose I'll have to wait for the anime to see if my thoughts change.
Bill Wurtz <:KirikaPog:605209108827734017>
It's certainly a bop
Maybe It's just throwing me off because I got used to NIjigasaki where I could hear the individual girls sing a lot but in sunshine it's usually the group singing so I don't notice individual voices as much.
I feel like her voice isn't how I remember but then again it's been awhile since I've seen Sunshine
*Yousoro*!
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
That's a banger
<:ChrisDJ:690470897194369034>
I'm looking forward to Liella to see how I feel about em
That's certainly uhh *creative*
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
According to the wiki "Beat Cats!!" was also a potential option which would've been interesting lol
Were the group members for niji determined by voting like the other ones were?
Oh interesting, I kinda assumed they'd both be 3-person units
So are Ayumu, Setsuna, and Shizuku a group when it comes to song releases?
It's not really my kinda song, but I could jam to it
That's an interesting song Nova
I just saw that one, truly a musical masterpiece
At a glance the girl in the thumbnail reminds me a bit of Sally from Bofuri lol
I can't decide how I feel about this one
I mean, not knowing anything about German, I never would've guessed it wasn't his native language.
Since I don't listen to much music in German it feels strange
I have no idea what they're saying, but the artist sounds nice
Magia is a banger
I'm not a big fan of Sunshine but that's a cool video <:ChrisDJ:690470897194369034>
👀
I have no clue what they're saying, but it sounds cool
Idk when I'll get internet tho since I can't schedule the people to install it until I know my work schedule <:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
in the few eps i did watch tho they were really cute <:ChrisHappy:660870796696223744>
maybe once i get internet
I can jam to that
<a:YuCheer:754740038994231346>
Ayahi has a really nice voice <:ChrisPray:672578403156885504>
<:ChrisDJ:690470897194369034>
Love Live has so many bangers
That's something I wouldn't expect lol
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
<a:YuCheer:754740038994231346>
Damn that fucking slaps
I like his stuff, I need to check out the new special he released not that long ago
<:KirikaPog:605209108827734017>
https://youtu.be/7T_YtklLyyo the video was apparently posted 12 years ago. the nostalgia is real.
I just remember Waterflame as the artist responsible for the Age of War music.
<:ChrisDJ:690470897194369034>
fripSide
Ocarina of time is basically one of the only Zelda games I've played and it was a banger
<:ChrisDJ:690470897194369034>
She's not an idol, but c'mon they could totally give her at least one song
<a:YuCheer:754740038994231346>
So, after listening to that, some that stood out for me: Ai's song was a banger as expected <:ChrisDJ:690470897194369034> , Kanata's has some nice vibes <:CarolSmug:617040484111745027> , Setsuna's is very fitting with her character nice and upbeat, I don't think I've really heard Shioriko's songs before but I really liked this one. Mia still throwing me off with the English and early 2000's vibe lol. Good songs overall tho
Ah
Pdp?
<:YuuShocked:762379673572474960>
Where's a Yu song is the real question tho
👀
Yeah I can just auto the songs while I do something else <:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
<:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
I just barely have any fuckin time to do that kinda stuff these days
Maybe one day I'll continue the sifas story xD
<:MiaTPose:793598918411288587>
<:wheeze:837213179380891688>
I forget, was that the girl in sifas who like the first thing we see her say is just *Shit*
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
For some reason this being in English is super throwing me off
<:ChrisDJ:690470897194369034>
I really ought to try playing that one again some day
Oh man, now i'm reminded how there's just gonna be Halloween stuff everywhere now that its october
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
<:MakiBlep:774326100552712202>
I have that one on my playlist
<:ChrisDJ:690470897194369034>
<:RikoOfCulture:749327484411183205>
That was nice
<:ChrisDJ:690470897194369034>
👀
I feel like I barely even remember sunshine
I remember watching the epic rap battle videos whenever a new one came out. That's some good nostalgia right there.
I can't even remember what that song is off the top of my head. I'd click the video but I'm at work
I literally don't remember this song at all, I don't remember a lot from sunshine now that I think about it xD
<:ChrisHappy:660870796696223744>
wait I didn't even realize there was some English in that song lmao
The best christmas song
I feel like i've totally heard that song before but i have no clue where
<:ChrisDJ:690470897194369034>
Thinking about it more, I'm pretty sure I just know it from osu! lol
<:ChrisDJ:690470897194369034>
<:Yousoro:715479194888437811>
<:ChrisDJ:690470897194369034>
what kind of pizza
<:KirikaPog:605209108827734017>
Those look like people, not mountain goats. I'm disappointed.
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
Nijigasaki on the other hand
<:KasuShrug:626072720404250669>
Aqours is just μ's but worse
~~At least now I've learned that there is actually something decent from Sunshine~~
<:YohaBlep:715459361677508609>
Yo <@!199928870810419200> wtf this is actually a banger https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uz8PonBdbuY
Wii games hold a lot of nostalgia for me since it was one of the only consoles I owned
<:ChrisDJ:690470897194369034>
<:ChrisDJ:690470897194369034>
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
Fuck it, I'd go to one of their concerts. Why not
<:ChrisDJ:690470897194369034>
Seeing the name "Macintosh Plus" reminded me of this song that was on Windows XP for some reason lol.  https://youtu.be/xMeivIkwf_I
<:HibikiScreech:633468460030230548>
Apparently it was only in early releases of the operating system according to Wikipedia so maybe that's why
It's a shame we never got anything more out of A-Rise
<:ChrisDJ:690470897194369034>
The rival groups in Love Live always put out some bangers
I wanna go to Antarctica irl
Oh hey, it's more Nana standing on ridiculous things
<:KotoBomb:715458544006070322>
<:MariaScared:672584661125431299>
oh god a VR version
That reminds me, i remember hearing about a remaster of system shock a couple years ago but it looks like nothing has come of that still.
I can't handle spooky games
Yeah I think I was probably like 10 years old or something when I played it. Terrifying shit to a kid
That game terrified me
oh god system shock 2
I don't like the one with Shirogane's VA as much, but the one with Ishigami slaps <:ChrisDJ:690470897194369034>
<:KirikaPog:605209108827734017>
Any color? Even purple?
<a:YuCheer:754740038994231346>
niji you say?
banger
<:ChrisDJ:690470897194369034>
dude on the left is absolutely  killing it
A-Rise, Saint Snow, the rival groups in love live always put out some bangers
I 100% thought that was Tsubasa when I glanced at that thumbnail
The Second Dream was such a good quest <:TsubasaBliss:672861879000891432>
Whenever I see that thumbnail I always think she reminds me of Sally from Bofuri lol
oh hey its the peggle song
<:ChrisDJ:690470897194369034>
yo this is kinda a banger
It's November tho
<:BocchiSparkle:1019865896266768385>
I feel like if i wasnt paying attention, I wouldn't even realize it was english
<a:BocchiRocking:1036245244846538792><:RyoAnnoyed:1029226256669089853><a:NijikaDrumming:1036892611492974623><:KitaInhale:1029626858083459082>
its such a banger
Anyone got more christmas songs from gear VA's? lol
Out of curiosity, I searched around a bit, I found winter/christmas themed songs from a lot of the gear VAs 

Ayahi Takagaki (Chris) - All I want for Christmas is You
Nana Mizuki (Tsubasa) - Promise on Christmas
Yoshino Nanjou (Shirabe) - A Tiny Winter Story
Ai Kayano (Kirika) - Santa Claus is Comin' to Town
Aoi Yuuki (Hibiki) - ?
Youko Hikasa (Maria) - ?
Yuka Iguchi (Miku) - ?
Inori Minase (Carol) - Winter Wonder Wander / Tiny Christmas Party
its nearly that time of year again
<:ChrisPresents:672578363176517642>
https://streamable.com/08p63
Speaking of cool versions of *Chris*tmas songs...
when i saw this i assumed it had something to do with the trans-siberian railway and thought it was gonna be some kinda music with train noises xD
I don't remember that song at all lol
<:ChrisHappy:660870796696223744>
There we go
Someone post the Ayahi all I want for Christmas version
<:ChrisBang:702166093065748500>
it really is a banger
Not knowing anything about guitars, I'm kinda surprised that what bocchi did in ep 12 actually works that well irl https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wAQRxcLUeE That's pretty damn cool tbh
why is that actually good tho
It feels more like the VA singing than the VA singing as Bocchi if that makes sense. Maybe it's just like the disconnect between the awkward bocchi and the more upbeat tone of her voice in the song that's throwing me off.
Honestly it doesn't really sound like bocchi that much to me
That game genuinely terrified me as a kid
<:ChrisDJ:690470897194369034>
Took me a sec to figure out where i remember that name from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtveSk1N7Uo. I haven't heard this song in years
