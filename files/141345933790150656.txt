Btw, those alt text on the preview images are in Japanese, my Chrome auto-translated them
Yeah, looks like it
Hibiki being measured
It looks like at least 6 of each of the preview images for each episode have alt text
Hibiki being measured has "üçö & üçö & üçú =?  ?  ?"
The preview image with Ogawa and Tsubasa carrying Yatsuhiro has the alt text "It ‚Äôs too much wine. Father ..."
Don't know if anyone noticed, but if you right click and inspect the preview images on the Symphogear site on chrome, there's a pretty good chance you get funny text? For example, if you inspect the Maria image on episode 10's preview images, it will have the alt text "This wine is not delicious!  !"
