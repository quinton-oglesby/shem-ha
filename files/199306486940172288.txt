Photos taken seconds before disaster

I always laugh at how Tsubasa and Hibiki are all going full on 100% and Chris is just casually dying
That's why shows like DITF are doing so well atm, they take time to set things up
You need time to set up stroylines
Def. RWBY just seems to get better (In terms of production quality) every season
Slow storytelling is needed at times
I enjoyed Vol 4.
I gotta finish RWBY, stop partway through Vol. 5
Really good insurance policies
lol
Maybe we should move this to <#336310266654490624>
Funny we see Maria doing boxing/h2h but Bikki would honestly be a better pick
indeed
<:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
I don't think we can take that much power/kindness ratio
Hell,  if my predictions are true, then Miku might even become a gear user soon, then we have god killer and her GF existing
indeed
*Made a primal diety realzie the error of her ways*
*Punched a god to pieces*
*Literally stole the gear off someone just by holding thier sword*
*Stopped the fucking illuminati*
*Became a god and then became a god killer*

She has more than just a right to be smug
~~Need a compilation of Hibiki screams throughout the series~~
Hibiki: The only girl that perfectly mixes smug, cute, and badass in one
smug hibiki <:rioluHug:506575567689089024>
but I doubt not too many people play it over GFL
Unless you guys want me to post HI3 art

One becomes a reality shattering goddess, the other one can become an extremely powerful (and sadistic) lightning wielder
These two would like to challenge that
Sometimes simple is better

there's a dess pun here somewhere
Hell, a lot of people (my family included) don't even consider Catholisim part of Christianity
The issue as always can be traced back to the Catholics
Because there are a fair amount of stuff left out of the bible (Thanks catholics) that reveal SO much more
I've often said that the creation vs evolution is just a debate over the interpretations and telling of the same story
Christians don't really "follow" it per se, but Sunday has been it for chruch
And the day of rest is debated as well, Jewish folks have it a Saturday and literally do NOTHNG, as in, turning on a light is considered breaking sabath
but just used as a way to describe the creation
since it clearly states in the bible that time means literally nothing to god
<@!193408538909868033> that's all deabted

That's the whole moral, that if someone has wealth, they'll use it all to help those who don't
Which he didn't particularly enjoy
Since a rich dude asked Jesus how to get to heaven and He replied "Sell most of your shit and use it to help the poor"
It helps to the understand the context behind the quote too
It was only normally big enough for person to get through
A camel had to get on it's knees to get through it
And quick historical footnote
"needle's eye" used to refer to a small door in old isreali city's wall
Another violation
"It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of the needle than it is for a rich guy to get into heaven"

Pope is literally surrounded by fucking gold
Pretty much
Anglican is just Catholicism with some leniency
Even the concept of the pope is ridiculous
all about power
Yup
They knew the moment poeple actually read the thing they'd see the catholics were/are crooks
That's why the Catholics killed so many poeple who tried to translate the bible
Hence Luther
Selling tickets to heaven
"Through me you are saved" - Has to go thorugh priest for most things
"Don't worship any gods before me" - Worsips Maty
Catholic faith breaks so many biblical rules if you look into it
We mainly see it as a seperate religion

And I can see where you're coming from with that
I've always just seen it  in the context of crossdressing and I thought that most poeple knew using it for trans people was going too far
I think that's more of an issue of definition
What may seem reasonable to me might be very different for someone else, which is why internet discussion gets out of hand quickly
Mind you, I have no idea of anyone's situation, so it makes it hard to factor in context
The issue is that people on all sides of any political argument get so easily fucking offended whenever their view is challenged
But it's a touchy subject all around and outside this server I've met people with good arguments all around
And that's justifiable
I hope I'm coming across right
Banning words or terms outright just gives off the wrong message
My opinion can be boiled down to: "If you think it's bad and want to make a rule about it that's understandable, but at least be open to discussing the topic to others in the hopes they understand too"
And damn wall of text
<@!102691114762371072> first off, legit thanks for the input
I feel self-censorship is a bit childish because it feels (To me at least) feels like people are being childish, like when your parents tell you not to say a "bad word" and you try to dodge it by saying things close to it and such. But I can understand reasons for things like actual swearing. 

In your case, I'm a bit opposed to it since it feels like it feels like trying to silence on otherwise reasonable and good argument. I'm not going to go into a debate into the term itself since that's it's own horrible can of worms, but I can understand the your viewpoint and I can respect that it's a rule here, regardless of my personal opinion. It just seems like if you ban people in general from saying it you're not only gonna push people away since people will feel censored, but also potentially eliminating an excellent opportunity for a real thoughtful discussion about it.
Especially in Canada, I have friends and family members on ***FAR*** ends of either political spectrum and I've had to mute some of them because the stuff they post is exhaustingly horrible
I blame the US, politics have gotten worse internationally
Let's just bully the main characters
Citruis was honestly an ass show disregarding Yuri
to be extremely simplistic
I mean there reason for it being fetishised is easy
"Here thing I like,  now two thing I like doing thing i like togehter"
my bad
I was agreeing with you there
Oh wait
just drawing connections
No
proportionally at least
I mean, isn't gay porn almost as popular among women and lesbian porn is amongst men
Coming from a guy who's actively failing at losing weight for personal reasons
I mean, there have been great steps regarding women in ads, but fuck, male advertising can be just as diminshing and esteem destroying
no difference than attracttive men and women to sell products
Just like any sexuality in general
Then again, my ***very limited*** perception of japan is from anime/manga and a few family friends who had memebers teac hthere
I mean, count how much yuri bait is in any show
IIRC
I can never understand Japan in politics, they throw around gay characters and treat them almost as common place in manga/anime yet Singapore is the only place where gay marriage is legal in Asia
And I think ambiguity comes from trans folks who own the term, if everyone in that community was against it, I legit we'd be having a much different conversation
It's a cartoon, so its easy to say literally anything about a character you create
I think it also has to do with how ambiguous anime characters can be
Hell it even was a fairly religous town and poeple were still repsectful
And even from nearby schools that were MUCH larger it never was an issue
Bullying was never an issue since most people didn't give a shit about anyone as long as you weren't in thier way
and weed
The worst thing poeple ever dealt with was some drinkers
what do you think
The HS i went too belonged to one of the richest town's in Canada
Maybe that's just more of a privilege thing with me
And they never really faced pushback
And see, that's what makes it seem a bit off for me, I've known a few trans people and almost all of them have either owned it or didn't even know it was a thing
I'll be honest, I completely missed that whole thing during the show
so idk, maybe just being anectodal
but never spoke against friends or others who were also trans
Hell, I've met people who where trans, became religous, and changed back
biased, but right in a sense
And another thing they shared was "If their heart is 'in the right place' (meaning they actually want to be religous) they'll come to it of thier own"
They understand being hostile just drives people away
at leas the one's I've met
Yeah, sad really, most moderate christians share that sentiment
Hell, even growing up around Christians, I've never really met a Christian that was hostile, they always preached a message of "We may disagree with thier lifestyle, but they're still human, and being hostile won't be of any help"
forget the name
or something similar ofr girls
Girls/boys could were pants uniformed except on Wednesdays since it was chappel (Least judgmental religious school ever)  where guys had to where dress shirt/tie and girls it was either skirt of blouse IIRC
<@!99522502811717632> that was us,
since in Canada, non citizens half to pay tuition
I mean, I went to a "private" school, but it was cheaper for a lot of foreign people to go there vs public school
that's the best argument for it
Uniforms help to to even people of different economic backgrounds
honestly, as someone whose spent a long time both in a uniformed and non uniformed school it doesn't bother me either way
Britain: We want to leave but have no idea how
never watched blend s
not sure
Isn't hideri just a cross dresser tho
at least that's what i heard
since the server swiftly devolved after that episode
Well, they had to do some pretty serious moderating iirc
/r/anime and the discord server had to be locked because fuckers can't have a proper debate
Just let the idiots argue it out on there own
I think Saki even says something to that effect
So what? Lilly is still lilly, she doesn't chamge based on her path
And even then it doesn't affect the storyline so it seems irrelivant honestly
I was more fixated on the father/child relationship
I'm fucking furious

I guess choking out 40% of all students in the province of cash counts as an efficiency
He claimed that the cuts would be minimal and just focusing on finding efficiencies in the provincial government
Because I doubt he can find 25 mil just by shuffling some government workers around
Let's start fucking cutting everything
Also government:
We plan to run a $25 million surplus
Ever since the budget passed this has been coming 

Current government:
"This federal carbon tax passes way too much cost on to the consumer, there are better climate change strategies"
Also government:
"let's tax the carbon tax"
The max has gone from $10k which is just enough to cover tuition, residence, and fees to $5k which doesn't even cover fucking tuition
Provincial governemnt literally decided to half all of the funding to students
