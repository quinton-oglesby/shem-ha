1 giga melody, 2 to go
Thanks everyone!
she's still my best hard raid I think, other than maybe miracle after the adds are gone
get poisoned at the wrong time and it's gg
yeah, she's pretty rng heavy
so close
progress is progress I guess
I cleared a few
which we aren't, because I couldn't join your raids yesterday either
If we aren't both following each other, the raid won't show up unless we're in the same grouping
although on my end it says you aren't following me
I have you followed as well
weird
Experimenting with different team comps with this, but I guess I'll post it here if anyone wants to poke it
oh, Teemo came back and finished the raid off, 9point
yeah, Phara still has almost all her HP
I have also opened a carol, since it seems like fun
okay, I have a Fine up now, if anybody wants to poke it
carol up
so it's easier for me than red
yeah, but I have both poison clear shirabes at least MLB

Also, reminder I guess that I do have a Fine up that I'm actually trying on
I'll put up another
well, NerfMe killed my carol
they just wanted to watch us suffer
I've got one more
thanks NerfMe
and my Carol is dead again

huh
I couldn't see Haz's raids when I was following him until he followed me, for example
it's a bit more complex than that
alright, my last carol is up
yep
of which the only ones right now are the AoT units
costume characters in general
slow and steady

so some of the enemies are from events that happened before then
these raids were added a year in
events
melody crystals are for normal symphogears, and therefore will become significantly less useful eventually as basically everything after a certain point is either a costume symphogear or fancy stuff like x-drive/ignites
should have some follower slots now
done
I only average about 100k a run, so it takes a bit
took an ice cream break
still working on it
I just need the stupid unity shards
she's 3/4

that's easily fixed though
and now I don't have enough gold

too happy
don't care
yeah

Mostly because they taunt most of your single-target damage towards them
Easier and more likely to drop them
If you just need normal ones, just run normal raids
Finally get another one from a raid I just casually tagged that didn't even win.
Huh. What are the odds?
Holy crap
it's dead now, but I'll go ahead and clear some space
whoops
Got a carol up with mostly dead adds, if anyone wants to poke it
Can solo Rage and sometimes Power at 5CP, so is all good
I was worried, but then I remembered that Normal raids exist
I still needed like 8
I forgot to host raids for the weekly mission
Accusations of hate speech are easy enough to throw around they could still catch most of the target demographics they meant with "in the majority" with that anyway, and nobody would care.
I mean, they really could have just left it at "those who promote such attacks of hate."
Yeah, it's not a great look. Especially since it's not particularly well worded.
