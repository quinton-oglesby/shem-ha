idk why this shit happend to us as a beginner artist
https://twitter.com/HidenSazer/status/1412923437220200450?s=19
Right now im suffering from Anxiety, Nightmare and Unconfidentless, When ever i sleep There are some ugly nightmares comes in , thats why i am very scared to sleep at night....
and also i got alot of offense and Harrassment from everyone just because im a 17 yrs old teen........


anyways as i was saying that, i just wanted a way to become mature man and getting away from my past mistakes.
i am sorry
to you know what i mean
they are type of that being, who make and love Offensive things
???
you know trollers right
i know somebody will see the message and say 

"its cringe, ratio and Unbased" and
they dont give a crap about it. But anyways.
i beat myself or bassed my head at the wall, whenever i remember those past insults and mistakes, just because, i thought its the only way to become mature
i dont feel like i should live in this world 
when i remember my past incidents, insults and mistakes, Then there are some annoying indians, who call bad things about me whenever i listen to kpop and watch anime and toku or do some hobby. I just want to be mature and live a really good life.
Spoiler tweet from guilty crown
https://twitter.com/HidenSazer/status/1399605996557783041?s=1
86 also counts as mecha
yo try to understand the difference between the piloting mecha and non piloting mecha genre
wrong
hmm true
yeah , i guess
if you still disagree then just ignore
and in japan avengers is tokusatsu
true
in japan , mecha defines that
no im trying to say is 
Mecha means mechanical
weather its piloting robots or non piloting robots
any robots (weather its giant piloting robots or Human sized android) are apart of mecha and
its just common sense
why wont you agree
are u agree upon me
ok so Vivy is a mecha anime
because first of all
Mecha doesnt always means Giants Piloting Robots 
Mecha Actually means Mechanical in short, so You may need to fully understand about the meaning of mecha...
second Vivy is a Robot and taking place in robots and human world, And in common sence , Robots are mechanical beings , so it counts as mecha
i know its my unpopular opinions 
and 
second if you can disagree its ok
but still it counts
it was started as diaclone and its also counts as mecha genre
if we get into the development origins
also transformers is concidered as mecha
btw its my only unpopular opinion for vivy
another Question 
why anime industry do not hire best head writers, and best directors????
Ok i had this one Question
i know its could sounds cringe or weird but still 

Why do in every Standalone Anime Fails in Story and Charecter Development , but perfect at Visual and Animations????
imagine Human piloting Mechas vs Ai Transformer like being but created on earth
humans have their robot but fighting with other robots who were infected by a virus....
I mean Rouge AI vs Human themed Mecha Anime...
hello guys
can you tell me , is there is any mecha anime which has Machines vs Mann concept....
yep it has 97% in rotten tomatoes
also its artstyle reminds me of code geass
but is it worth for watching??
but according to gigguk , cross ange is bad???
same, i also love gurren laggan
if no then ignore
Do ya all watch mecha anime??
if yes , tell me whats your most Favorite mecha anime , (except Gundam , Getter Robo, Mazinger, Eva, and SSSS Duology)
true, tbh i enjoyed the show, and i can agree that its a mecha anime
<@213645184125239317> do you also think, Transformers is not considered as mecha genre???
mecha doesnt always means Piloting giant robots
see
you must be kinda dumb right
its also count as mecha, man
tbh i am gonna revive the mecha anime genre
how? 
||Well im working on a Indie tokusatsu/Mecha one shot Manga project named Karma Senshi Hiryu .....||
yep, also this mecha anime is the only hope it can revive the mecha genre
https://twitter.com/HidenXazer/status/1429014016337141760?t=QG8RtQ3fuKIjeUNeD-6siQ&s=19

dude are you kidding me ,or just serious????
https://myanimelist.net/anime/48466/Kyoukai_Senki

nope this anime
Kyoukai Senki
nope
umm wdym
Is anyone Ready to watch Kyoukai Senki at tomorrow??
can we discuss about sawano hiroyuki???
anyways
do you trust MAL ratings for real???
If the only reason ya, all watch anime because of the writing then why don‚Äôt you just go read books ? üòÖ
Ratings in MAL are a lie, never rooted in realism. There is no such a thing as Anime rated 10/10 being 10/10, it is only mainstream YouTubers covering something and people who know no better mindlessly glorify said show
There is no fair judgement, just biased people who reviewbomb shows, people who judge unfairly becouse of genre, gloryfing mainstream and bashing niche shows, people who bash show for being itself, or don't like that it isn't what they like, or what it didn't do what they like
People who know nothing about reviewing, and doesn't analyze the show, people who care about their opinion more than objective quality. 10/10 show is NEVER 10/10 show, 7/10 os realistic outcome for good show 10/10 is ALWAYS a lie and reviewed by people who know no better.
but still
i know every body would not agree
