'◊©◊ü◊ê
||Mikue will be the next vilain||
The CR subs are good and easy to understand
||Maria had the most dumb saying in symphogear as of right now||
||Genjuro i wore extra hot pants today||
||Is it just me or is the plot started logical?||
||Let's hope they didnt blow all the budget on the animation in ep1 like they did in s1||
Can we all agree that mentioning stuffs from previous seasons is a nice change for once
This is adorable
Chris has a scouter
Best thing they drew
Yeah this transformation was sick
Is my wall paper from now on I think
Basa water surfing
Lol
Will you be there for me bla bla bla
Symphogear is taking the fate route
Oof
Until the ass arrives
I find it amusing basa is flat
Blessed images
This is why she is best girl
Basa
oof
One might contain incest
All of them are echhi
4isekais
Symphogear needs to be #1
Compared to what's coming out this season
|| The unexpected is always expected ||
|| You cant sing under water but you can sing in space smdh||
|| There was no ver nani the fuck? ||
gonna be the same in XV
I think my way of explaning symphogear is the best way since its true
Repeat
Look ancient relic
and they are like woah :O
Oh now our relic is not strong enough it can be easily countred
Themn damn it... :(
Look we found a counter to their counter
them: YAY 
No they found a counter to our counter
them:OOF
Look we found a counter to counter their counter
them: Yay
Symphogear has the same formula each season
Yeah the fusion Giga drill was fire
its so smooth
jesus im rewatching the transformation
but it's easy to fall in love with her
Kirika is such a air head
and chris is T H I C C
Basa is a bad ass
Well yeah
it kinda did
i did this with fate and railgun
then AXZ then XV
then G then GX
symphogear
The name of the seasons is fucked up
i mean i wouldnt be suprise
unavoidable*
Getting old is anavoidealbe growin up is mandatory
And then the buzz dies
It gets even more hype
When a show is so hyped and then getting delayed
Think so
it's an  acquired taste
How's doctor stone btw?
its sad nana cant have a love life thanks to idol lifes eggs dee
i want her to be single
And can it please be maria?
Can they please kill a gear user?
No more monies for them
If nana is gone
YO
DESU
AI
Praise our goddess
Nana can have it all
Even SO!!!!!!!!!!!!
When i first watched it i replayed this scene to make sure i didnt miss anything...
Like ever
Maria just had the most stupid saying in anime
People die when they are killed
This is fate level of words
oof
Glad chatting with you guys!
i'll be back online in around an 1hour or so
well im off to college
Ignite songs made me head bang way more than any other recent metal bands
It's so much fun to listen to
OOF
So no more ignite
DROP F# or something really low
A friend of mine told me that he would not be suprised if maria songs went to an 8strings guitar
is that true?
Bikki was fire
Noooooo i want a basa one
More low tunings and heavy riffs
God give me ignite maria please
i would not be suprised honestly
Hikasa youko has an under ground hardcore band
oof
Her ignite sounds way better than the none ignite vocal wise
Hikasa Youko voice fits well to hardcore stuffs
in my book
She is already a god tier
Maria did rias gremory and mio from k-on
Maria is terrible all in all
chrisXstephan
Wait so an episode comes out on Saturday?
All we can do is wait
Oof
No audio yet doe oif
God this song doe
Oh shit oh shit
WiFi on trains working for once smdh
Lmao
Started from Steve moved to devil jin then jin
Devil jin
Nah
It had some s1 vibes
That's why xv started lit
Yeaas
Dbfz easy to get into hard to master
And you can't change my mind
Dbs was Garbage
As a DBz fan
Wait was bushimo the same guy who worked on s1?
Dio
Looking for mindless fun
Should I start?
Never watched jojo
Yep
Can't get more pog than this
Symphogear and demon Slayer at the same day
Oh boi
Rewatching the living shit out of it
Ikr?
The staff rn are amazing
And bikki with a scarf
I'm happy
We have s1 producers
Sorry
Sorry about that let's talk about it in dm we are getting off topic
Yeah
Then I'm down
But If it's like dbfz
Never heard of it
What's unist
Didn't enjoy street fighter or blaze blue or guilty gear
Tekken and dbfz were the only games I was able to enjoy
Jin is just so much fun
Now i kinda want to watch it
So our beloved kirika is going to voice the mom in the milf isekai
The next moment maria kicks tsubasa in the guts lol
Like one moment they sing
They had a drama queen fight behind the scenes
No one dares to hurt my DESS
Hikasa yuko and nana are amazing as a duo
i mean vocal wise
But honestly maria and tsubasa are the better duo imo\
I wouldnt mind a zwei wing prequel
i have a feeling its gonnabe madoka and hanamura like
But ive heard they plan another anime about kanade and tsubasa which can be really really nice
I think miku and biki will have a fight
Symphogear is going edge lord again
just finished reading the lyrics
||Miku turning evil||
No lyrics on the wiki
do i wanna know?
Just downloaded
The biki cd is fire
That's too simple?
Lol
Thing is bikki set up a high bar
Now this is epic
Woah
I'll jump so hard
If Chris will do a finger gun
<:TsubasaDisgust:349013662775902209>
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
Oof not again
I'm with Sword
Place your bets
Who will get a transformation next episode?
Besides symphogear this season is a dumpster fire
Symphogear is the highest rated anime so far in this season onegaLUL
Fmab is the manga ending
Fma is an original ending
He didn't even start and I won't stop until he does
I'll watch it if you'll stop telliy me to watch it
A friend of mine told me
Fmab is good
It's a fair trade
Smdh
How did I miss that?
Mhm
Like father son Kamehameha
Her hair is really majestic
Guess I need to rewatch again
Ah
If so I never stay after the ed
In the after credits?
Huh?
They only showed her on a single episode
F
Ah lol
Nahhh
Was that Chris?
Please make it happen
Omg yesssss
I riot
If kirika transformation won't have at least 5dess
I might
It won't happen but one can dream
I want a gun bullet xxx ignited
So Gilgamesh from fate
Xv is 15
Melua
Melia is correct doe
How can one understand
Xv
Like g gz axz zv
It's hella confuseing
I mean
Huh?
And kirika is going to be the voice of the mom from the milf isekai oof
What kind of stupid name is that?
lasting song
ah nvm
Does any one know the song name for XV ed?
Did some one say memes?
WTF
Why is the ed song for XV so damn catchy
But the ed grew on me and i think it's one of her best songs
What i wonder doe is the op clip will be if the ed clip will be edgy cause the ed sounds way too happy
The opening scene shows that the gear users are about to have hard time
Young tsubasa is a protecc
xv opening clip soon
Is the animation really that bad?
where can i watch the raw?
the raw
yeah
wait is the raw out yet?
The all the budget on the 1st episode
I knew it was goin g to happen
This is the last part i need in order to upload my guitar cover for this op smdh
oof i need the opening clip
with subs or without?
wait the episodes comes out in 3hours?
If xv opening clip is going to be lit
I wonder
DESS
i love kirika so much
Kirika i a dess
Was the animation good?
Look at your DM
The internet already ruined dess
We dont need lewd we have the internet for that
feels really really good
with almost no ecchi
Same an all girl show
unlike ahem fairy tail
Yeah it doesnt shove it into your face every 5minutes
it pisses me off same with ecchi
But when its a replacment for something decent
i mean i like blood and gore in anime
Pretty much
I really hope symphogear wont go like all gore and nothing else doe
This time we actually see people die
oof
:LUL:
Or charcters going ape shit
is the epidemic
Basa getting a ptsd
Symphogear is gonna go madoka?
GX and axz felt like a kids tv show
it feels good to see it going back to the more mature content
Honestly doe
#LETSHOLDHANDSANDWINTHISBREADGAMERBOIS
and why is it not maria OOF
XV is back being a savage
Yo
if some one died
dm me
Did some one die?

Time for her to take her medications again
Tsubasa is going insane
Way bigger

||Tsubasa with blood on her face||
i'm so happy
They are taking the madoka route
YEET
Sanity loss
They are going there
They are going there!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Just finished watching
The parts where the animation was soppuse to be good was amazing
it was pretty solid
The animation wasnt as bad as i thought
Ok
it's better than star dusto
is a banger song
That maria and basa duet
Ok can we talk about
5ds like yugioh?
She can teach tyson a thing or two
LET IT RIP DESS
way too hard
i laughed
yesssssss
every damn time
Biki needs to stop going to concerts doe
||When kirika split her scythe to two small ones|| i was like kirika you smart girl yay
Get ready for a lack of animation in ep3 lol
But yeah the details are fire
Basa is the sexiest in a concert
00 useless
When you're saying you're fine but you're not really fine
A small blush moment before disaster
Because DESS and yoyo girl are doing her homeworks
weird
that's
It actually makes sense
They mentioned stuffs from axz
im actually suprised honestly
Dont come to church tommorow you're cool
She'l come to fine like
Basa is going to shoot up an iluminatie church
◊í◊ù◊ê◊†◊ô ◊ë◊©◊ï◊ß
◊ó◊ó◊ó
They played it smart imo
Using a kid as a hostage
People actually dying
Facial expressions
way way darker
You can taste the s1 elements
Shirabe is going ham with the yo yo
with the essentials shots
lewded maria pretty hard
s2
ehh
The creators are doing this for us
I mean we dont need the internet to lewd kirika
Poor tsubasa
Let's go to the edgeness and sanity loss
Keep it madoka please
its a mega scorpion
what if
if that's not a scorpion i dont know what is

This looks like a scorpion
Lemme find it
uhmm
F in the chat for bikki after she uses that power
I think i know what's going to happen
solopy you didnt see it?
Did you guys notice that bikki uses that scorpion as her scarf in the opening?
I thought i was the only one who noticed
Camila means busness
They just know how to hit the weak points
The thing is they are weak
axz and gx felt like a kids show made by 4kids
Finally doe it doesnt feel like a kids show anymore which is good
Then oh boi i cant wait for people to reach s5
if you thought s1 ep1 was a mind fuck
lol
Maria realised she is useeless
Her screaming on this episode was pretty solid
Nana can scream doe
Basa doesnt count cause shes half way there
Ok so who will go insane first
God how i just love when anime going the sanity loss way
They might be trying to stop hibiki from becoming a god
Swan song wont happen
that's stupid since they all survived all of em
If they die to a swan song
Yeah but no one can take swan songs seriously
sanity loss
cause
But can be pretty dope
I mean i know it wont happen since we see her in the op
Basa kills her self thanks to the mind control and sanity loss?
Guys what ifffffffff
What ifffffffffff
against bikki
I think miku will have a big fight
The last thing i want to happen is for symphogear to go the lets save sasuke route from naruto
Bikki dies or becomes a god
I think it's a part of bikki gear
Yet goku cant channel ultra instinct LOL
It is
^
No
or a mutant scorpion
But it has its similarties
it's not
way too hard
This made me laugh way hard
Not another jojo refrance
lol
wasnt symphogear in 2015 or something?
still not legal
3months then
Symphogear always starts nice until the shock factor hits
didnt tsubasa and maria had a drama queen fight in the back stage?
^
what live
Well i guess im going to jail then
You forgot his a ninja
ogawa is fine
cd6 better be lit
Wait why do i hear the fbi knocking on my door hold on
OOF
Ah
Kirika is like 17 or 18 i think so it's ok from the creators to lewd her
I think shes not 16 now right?
kiri is growing <#
DESS
Kirika making a huge scythe into two smaller ones
IM SO FUNNY
AH HA HA
DESS IGALIMA BALLS
Absolutly
Yeah
after saying that her fun time is over
i really hope chris wont die doe

üò¶
No ver
I dont really like XV honestly
<@87512939107450880>  took him 5seasons but so far so good
I really hope it's not what i think it is
Yeah
üò¶
i feel bad for my waifu
every one were like wtf was that
its like evangelion
i think it's gonna be harsh on all of us
Tsubasa going on a rampage bikki style
Top tier
Great singer
Great voice acting
great looks
Great screaming
Nana is perfection
Didnt know nana can scream like that
Was good
Tsubasa screaming
Dope
Tsubasa is legal
Yeah the madoka route
This show is starting off great
or like 5episodes
And basa sacred for life
WE ARE GOING FULL SPEED BOIS BUCKLE UP
I love sanity loss anime
Just keep it going
Going back to the edgeness
I'm full of joy
<@124136423153467392>  better get a new set of underwears
We wont get a basa transformation for a long time
thank you Trump
Yeah
Mhm
You can see in the op she is fighting with maria
she will snap out of it
||U,S, FUCK THINGS UP||
and again
She better go and become a warewolf and change her class to paladin
Wait you guys are saying basa is going to be a vampire?
This is going to be rushed
oof
is it officaly 13?
26episodes will be the sweet spot
26ep
basa kills her grandpa thanks to mind control and him screaming at her none stop
What if
YOOOOOOOOO
yooooooo
i'll punch my monitor
IIf he'll say that
i really hope this season will be more than 13episodes
And they were like ohhhhhhhhhhh
And then the movie came
Stop it satelite
Dont lewd my DESS please too precious
which i really like
Got some very fast double bass action
it just hit me that every song so far besides biki
Im gonna make this song my new ring tone
waiting for the wiki to download basa and maria song
true
This badly drawn frame doe
before she went back in time again
In madoka they all killed each other
just a small reminder
i want a basa arc
I dont think they can upgrade their gear anymore
13 episodes feels rushed
i thought invasion in french is we surrender
is not enough since there's alot going on
i still think 13episodes
Not in a flash back doe
I really want them to show fine
Think so
LET
I bet he has a file where he lewds young girls and calling it Pedo Files
oof
The one who did kirika is a certified pedophile
well i guess you cant be consistant 24/7
they ssaid 2015 doe in s1
but shes not even 17 DESS
i would be fine with that
I mean if kirika was like 18 or 19
To get her into the zone
her voice actress was getting ready for the milf isekai so we need to lewd her
Damn kirika got some moves
I was like
No one can beat rin from fate tigh highs
You have a point
actually
They are taking their show seriously now
arghhhhhhhhhhhhhh
now we need to wait a whole week
oof
<@486087033652248576>  too soon
smdh
She can easily counter that vampire
Only if basa had a light element
Honestly doe
Tsubasa ‚ù§
i honestly plan on going back to FFXIV and start a smurai
it's the scorpion
it was a banger
what was the song name of maria and basa song doe in the concert
it's a blessing
if xv keeps going like this
There's some banana song in the xv ed
The us could care less doe
100 thousand
When You thought the answer in question number 3 was 4.85% but the class is fighting if its 5% or 4.5%
painful
Tsubasa will make it slow and apinful
After what they did to my precious basa
They deserve no redemption
Shes not a sayan
No lewds allowed
Props to them doe
16
true
I wanna punch the guy who is responsible for kirika
break down starts
CHZZ THE FUCK UP
and before the break down be like
I honestly wanna write a song
C H A Z Z I T UP
Next episode
RIP
IT
yeah
terrorist attack
Imagine nana mizuki doing a live show symphogear live
im afraid to diee
but
I wanna go to a symphogear live
didnt notice it
oh crap
Zwei wing
God what a stupid name
Yeah
But didnt feel like it
it looked
i wouldnt mind a movie of kanade and tsubasa history
Movie about what doe
there wont be
no s6
The jacket is too small
She needs to lose weight
what's a spin band?
DESSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
Guns=funs
Kirika is becoming less pure
Now i feel like protecc BASA
<@!441163888382443521>  the americans
?
phantom of the opera
waht the middle one
furry
i had the strangest boner in this kirika scene
what a mad lad
so much emotions
poor basa
This frame
We had alot of s1 vibes
Such a useless insect they can survive a nuclear bomb but not a shoe
There was a huge massive cockroach in my shower when i took a shower
no only the image is carved into my mind
lol
Dont
The amount of emotions a single drawing gave off
still carved into my mind smdh
Tsubasa face coverd with blood
<@239893407122718721>  im calling you answer please
well done
lol
The unexpected is always expected
maria was right
poor basa
F
ah wait nvm
omg
who is the unluckiest of em all
ok so its maria
That's enough
she was on her way therte
it happens
only when biki goes to a show
did you notice it
Low effort oc
The internet
i think are 40kg
weight&
Now i wonder how much does a gear cost
katanas*
Katana are fairly light weight
The only gear that is the least heavy imo is tsubasa
wearing a mecha suit is already heavy af
True
but its an anime so...
imo maria has the ideal body
she deserves it
Hope so
And then well...
in the op she looked skill
Yeah
cardio=getting fit
What maria does here is cardio training
boom
Buffed loli
What if
Which means maria is fit
abs=low fat %
you'll*
i mean if you hand wreslte bikki you most likely lose
I think bikki should have more muscle than what she has rn
which i dont like
they are following the stereotype
yeah but genjiro is a dude
Why cant i get phonic gain irl
Which is weird since biki can lift a whole fucking tank
they are fit and a single thicc
honestly none of the gear users are buffed
She's more fit than buff
Maria is buffed in the right places
--testing
how do i cross off something?
wasnt*
it was foreshadwoing what so ever
She probably plans on going to another school
Shes going to live
oof
Now im tempted to watch it
was plan on avoiding it
yeah
like same VA
Did you know that serena did whiz in konosuba?
Miku is filled with motherhood
too soon
oof
And kirika being smart for once dess
basa and chris actually think
done
biki is like punch
yeah
imo some one who smart is some one who can plan a great strategy and take advantage of their enemis weakness
oof my grammer is lacking today
are smart
every one of t hem is smart in their own way
The thing is
bikki is the dumbest
That's true
i thought shirabe and kirika did her home works
Is she?
While chris is mostly statinory and getting more thicc
Yet she is the flatest of em all
she need to have really strong tighs
Yeah lets talk about it
without thinking
sign me in
biki is like
genjiro went to biki in s1 you might die
<@106861977086779392>  yeah i mean saving the world is more important i guess
but does the pay worth the ptsd?
honestly laughed for solid 10minutes
Yeah chris made me laugh when she said that basa is probably spending most of her money on bikes to jump off for no reason
cheers
~~test~~
ah
A man can only wait so long
~~I kinda hope it wont happen~~
üò¶
Why didnt they release it yet
what's the song name doe
oof
Damn seiten galaxy is edgy
Follow that natural desire,
Be independent
Hope and despair together,
Embrace them
Keep on fighting, until your life meets its end
it's so good
Did they release the new maria and basa single from ep2?
Way more technical than previous songs
Still has the kirika vibes but it's different
it sounds way different
it feels so progy
The new kirika song is a banger wtf
^
And they want people to make content smdh...
seriously doe you can't do a thing on youtube without it being removed
ive posted a dispute
You cant upload a single cover without it being removed...
so youtube removed my metaonia cover
Tsubasa cd cover doe yooooooooooooo
it just feels way different
I think 5 is a different director
Who directed s2-4 doe
Which i fairly enjoy
He came back to direct s5
ah right right
Who's kaneko again?
Tsubasa getting isekaid
KonoTsuba
Basa and biki only survivers confirmed
I think i'm foreshadowing something
all the people in the flash backs are dead
Besides basa and biki
Yoooooooooooooo it just hit me
Who will join her parents?
What if the op gives us a hint about chris
The op implies that all fo them will be some level of import
This show will end in a 3rd impact disaster level
goes*
Basa wont transform in a while shile she go and get ptsd therapy
I wonder who will transform
The bloody moments
the show does have s1 vibes to it
DESS
And this director does a good job so far
That's dangerous
yes it is DESS
is the new episode out in nyaa?
ok
yet they lewd the 16 years old
mhm this episode is downloading fast
boom
add peanut butter
eating white greek yogurt alone is disgusting

||And finger bang||
||Boobs jiggle bullets||

Do we get any tsubasa in this episode or no?
i'll riot
If chris song wont make me head bang
<@!182890099183190018>  deep words cut deep
What's not to like
God kirika...
How's the music?
oof i didnt see the ep yet
dess
This part made me laugh more than it was meant to be


How can you be so DESS
didint finish watchiing the episode but
watching now without spanish subs
ok back to the episode
but it's expansive
Wanted to punch my monitor
God i felt bad for tsubasa
Hey she knows how to use her resources
i think season5 is going to be the best season
The animation was slick
The revovlvers were siick
Yoooooooooooo
oof
And to think she is the voice of the milf in the milf isekai
DESS!
Kirika is a smart DESS
||What are the odds of them raiding the hospital? fairly low||
Kirika with the bbq doe
Kirika and shirabe are the next bayblade
my precious kirika üò¶
so unfair
||DESS being upset in the end made me sad||
that's like half the budget
oof
||And basa grandfather wtf? top 10 anime plot twists||
This episode was fire
will the animation ever be crappy?
I mean
I still think that 13episodes is too low
oof
week
Now we need to wait another wee
damn it
Kaneko is doing good so far
<@185949743321579520>  the kirika part with the bbq made me spit out my drink
The segway had no RGB 0/10
Segway is dangerous doe
pisses me off
Yet they lewd her
Kirika is so pure
They were defeated easily since they were low on blood
Kiri is the only one who can be so damn stupid and smart at the same time
Yeah
<@279341087494242304>  ◊ê◊ó◊ô ◊†◊™◊†◊ï ◊ú◊î ◊©◊ù ◊©◊ú ◊™◊ô◊û◊†◊ô◊î
◊õ◊®◊û◊ú◊î
<@440138597539119114>  all of them are sort of protegonists doe
if none of her family members have
How does she have blue hair
Who's in tsubasa family has blue hair
Can we all talk about something
what a cunt
ikr?
Since his taking the enemy route
i still think basa will kill her grandfather
He wants it for himself
I call BS
Nehustan is also in the bible i think
Like wtf do you want him to get bullied?
What kind of parent names his son like that
hidden name of God in Kabbalah
it's from the jewish bible?
Oh shit
<@246195276765855745> This entire season has not been clear
Chris is a good looking waifu
Can't really blame ya
What about chris actually using her sniper more than once?
Just punches you in the face
This season is taking the madoka route
One of the gear users gonna die rip
Oh boi
She did?
I think this season deserves 24
Sory i just had to

Hold on
This is a meme worthy shot
Yooo
Fudou?
Nandeska?

Confirmed

YOOOOOO
HOLD UP
YO
that will heal the damage
So yeah let's put a band aid on her face
mhm
That's what im saying
dumbbell is good
and tsubasa screaming in ep2
The only time i felt chills down my spine in anime is when goku became ssj
The shock factor and nana screaming
nah dude ep2 was better imo
She didnt take any hits
But did maria got injured doe?
Maria is cute but basa is way cuter
True
Blood sugar levels raised
Melted
I think this season is the highest rated season so far
honestly doe this season is strong so far
an
He IS any enemy
He yelled at tsubasa
^
She gave all she had for chris
Tsubasa had some sort of boobs in s1
it just a low ass quality stun
<@486087033652248576>  well played
I do weddings as well
i'll go jump off a building thank you

God saturday is my fav day ‚ù§
oh sweet a new demon slayer episode as well
The iluminati never learns do they
smdh
She will turn it into ice
trading blood with elsa is stupid
all of them have body pillows
In the end
imo
Maria is the sweet spot breast wise
Swan song into area-51
Screw runing like naruto into area-51
pp hard
YO
DESU
AI
Perfection
Ver is perfections
No one hated Ver doe
Enough with that
Please no redemption moments
Symphogear is 50% memes 50% chris Thickness

God this show makes me wanna go to the gym again today
How can one be so dummy t h i cc
Symphogear is like cheetos

He told me this
Some one in my class also watches symphogear he reached until GX i asked him what he thinks

Biki screaming ahhhhhhhh
Great now i want to listen to maria song on repeat
Basa grand father is quite strong doe

What if
i think getting shot is a different story
Yeah but
We already know that genjuuro about to kick some ass
I mean why do we need to wait a whole episode
ikr?
10/10
The focus on maria breast doe
I think it's her best song
Rip budget i guess?
bikki and her reklesness
Does it mean they can get aids?
Wait a minute
No i am the biggest nana fan
is it any good?

Helping my teacher to each
OOF
I need it to blast on my way to class

Bikki becomes a god and all that
I still hope for a madoka ending
The new form is sick doe
Only biki
||How come all the gear users got one?||
There are only 3 robes
Thing is
C H A Z Z I T U P
He didnt
so fair
Well the amuont of effort i gave on this meme was 2/5

Wanna see a good meme?
Chills down my spine
With ||Golden armor||
DATE MO!!!!!!!!
Aoi screaming
The swords are just NYAGHHHHHHHHHH
But it was the most epic
Tsubasa transformation had the least animation
Nah im used to spoilers
omg
why did i read that
Didnt watcg yet
madoka route?
its up on NYAA
ayyyyy
Im teaching tommorow so i need that song in my life in order to survive
The full version
Cant wait to listen to her new song
Tsubasa is doing a gilgamesh
Jesus fuck
i wanna see the transformation
Cant find it on nyaa
When will the sub be released at nyaa?
we have a tsubasa transformation?
OMG
This basa frame is too big for my phone screen oof
This basa frame
This is my new wallpaper
people keeps dying infront of her OOF
Poor tsubasa
It can make the show take a dark turn
If miku or F9 dies
made me laugh
I love kiri so freaking much oof
i spat my drink
When kiri tries to be useful when they talk about complex stuffs
Got me there
oof
Her new song doe is fire
Tsubasa part wasnt comedic
What if miku watched a biki lewd?
^
You have people surviving with holes in their stomach
Amount of blood means nothing
Its anime
Since the song in ep1 kinda mentions it
or hurt her
Actually kill Miku
They have an amazing chance now
Poor tsubasa it was like watching an agro deck vs a control deck
5bucks that miku is alive and the goverment guy is dead
saw the episde
this can make a good plot progression
If they hurt miku
I dont like where this is going
Miku didnt answer the phone bikki was not there
I swore to "protect someone"...but
What if...my two hands
Aren't enough?
I kinda hope miku will get hurt
F
F for her sanity doe
Why shes alive
oof mobile phones are dumb
True
I feel so dumb oof
How can i download your pfp doe?
I wonder if it will fit my phone screen
ah
<@!246678192360783872>  what's pfp?
sleep well mate
pfp?
The photos from symphogear are always too big for my phone screen
is a phone lock screen worthy
This frame

Basa losing control doe
Symphogear needs to be a bit longer since there's alot going on and not alot of time to explain
üò¶
Now we wait for tsubasa new song
For the amount of shit that's going on
13 is not enough
wont happen but
Basa being controled to kill some one important to her
I have a theory
The jiii part doe
JIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII
Hol up
Yo
I wanted the dying kid on the white screen but i dont have it üò¶
too lazy and too tired to do something decent
Low effort

There
Leave the dying kid alone i have a better idea
I know how to do this meme
ok
Going back to the early 2000s
BLOOD without seeing who's getting cut
most basic anime shock factor
i promsied it will be funny
Just send me it
its gonna be sort of amusing
I have a meme to do
I need some one to send me the bleeding face of the girl who got killed in the concert
Tsubasa: I want to protect people
Tusbasa: Throws a mega fucking spear into a building
This episode went fomr a 0 to 1 00 real quick
Please
<@!441163888382443521>  can you send it to me on DM?

Ver comes near the end
Just blow it up
Like why didnt you destroy it completelty from thje start?
It nearly destroyted japan in S3
Like it's a construction area
Why are they rebuilding carols castle?
Can some one explain to me
Say no more you're in

So tell me a good thing about yourself
Can you just imagine his CV?
Kinda dissapointed ||They didnt hurt miku|| but still
his such a bad ass
Car clone jutsu i guess?
Ehhhhhh

That
is taking such a huge good turn
This show
Yeah since the rest are couch potatoes
Chris is the opposite of fit
Basa is not fit doe
idk if it's the new art style
shes more fit than before doe
So this is how it is huh?
Why?
Jesus
Yet again shes animated but still
bad
i feel
Maria is more fit than me
Just enjoy maria getting rekt with a cape
no need for logic
its symphogear
"Don't bring your logic into this"
as chris said
Like with the diapers
This needs a sponge bob refrence
ok
OOF

With cape
Maria being useless as always
In that scene i was like ohhhhhhhhh f9 ‚ù§ to ohhhhhhhh you bitch how daare you
The gift that keeps on giving Ver
Saves the day once again
It's not my final form
Dont let the meme die

from symphogear i have a great idea for a cross over
Of an exploding bike
A frame

It needs to be a template for all the memes
We need to make this meme not just symphogear related

Sorry not sorry

YESSSSSSSS
Did i do it right?

<@87512939107450880>  big true
How do you keep it transparent and in good quality?
Body shape ehh
in fitness maybe
nahhhhhhhhhh
T H I C C
i thought she was on the roof of his car
The small details are great
Which was great
i think it was just a tiny detil in the animation
i can delete it if its too much
the template
its an actual manga doe
<@239893407122718721>  thank you for editing this ‚ù§

He liked but he need to take the time thanks to ep1
A friend of mine tried to get into symphogear
the carol one is golden lol
And came back

oof
Can they actually make swan song dangerous for once?
Swan can kill the user LUL
Basa always having a breakdown doe
Her voice annoys me
Such an annoying twat
i hate Micha
and thanks to the war the plant went kaboom
What if there was a civil war same as chris or a nuke
I think we are over thinking it
Cant wait for the swan song
We only have 6episodes left
<@209896097026408449> yes
the fan art is what im hoping that will happen in XV
<@414366682966917120>  that's sick
Maybe im hoping for the madoka route too much
idk why i want her to lose her sanity
Injured enough to make basa go insane
it's a shield duty!
After ep7
The one people kept publishing 2days ago

Sooooooo now they have to fight miku?
They are taking the fate route

Tsubasa breast was never huge wtf?
In a good way
Not being able to save miku can make the plot go kaboom
She was always hot
hey look im fine üòÑ
Basa is like let me go insane for an episode
heard its good
didnt watch HF yet
then it came back to the fate route
it kinda went madoka at the concert
But one can hope

Will the gear users die with miku?
the real question is
i kinda want fudo to die
Cause plot armor
Mortals
Yeah this
Wait dont we have a chart for today's episode?
◊û◊ô◊ú◊î
◊ï◊ï◊ê◊ô
Her armor is gorgeous so she has that for her

Out of this world
I cant stand her singing but her screamings are just
Why is no one talking about biki screaming naer the end?
the XV live is gonna be pogs
if Maria>Serena print apple
unless Basa>Best girl

lol
Combine new songs from XDU and classics and boom you have a festival
You have XDU which keeps on releasing new songs
I mean the live is easy money grab
Yeah sure
i honestly think that the live should be yearly
do it
For us mate
^
yeah
WOKE
Then chorus
Yeah i'll sleep
The thing about final commander is like
omg
Carol song ‚ù§
<@239893407122718721>  new nana song omggggggggggg

like in bunny senpai?
<@506219877724454929>  it's a whole week
I just liisten to nana albums
Some people drink coffee in the morning
‚ù§
Nana keeping me awake and alive since 2012 <#
Nana's
i wanna go to sleep
Third impact
Evangelion all over again!
Every one are dying
But i was hoping for something bigger
The visuals are great and the animation in the end was also good
But it feels meh compared to other transformations
Great visuals
The lest impressesive transformation imo
oof
Ah
i downloaded the episode on NYAA in less than 10minutes
kissanime bans you for using adblock
REWATCH S5 ON THE PHONE
im saving it for a flight
Oh im not deleteing
Download it on NYAA
nandeska?
Good night!
got a class to teach!
well its time for me to go to bed
On pornhub or something idk
He should of publish it anyway
F
Thank you but i dont want the FBI knocking on my door
The first one will be on the blue ray i think
LMAO NO
Kirika animator
They were like dont lewd kirika please
Japan is planning on a symphogear theme strip club?
2 strippers
Miku and kirika
lolz
I want to sleep but Final commander just keeps me alive
^^
Miku plan on going to a strip club when xv is over
Without the alchemy part
Some one asked me this once...
Spit my water
Copy paste that's cutting-edge alchemy, huh?
Kirika quote made me laugh doe as a guy who worked for it
The copy paste part pissed me off
I mean if the gear users didnt have ignite
Carol can solo the whole Symphogear universe
Cant change my mind
Maria is georgous
Carol is just way too strong
its the face
I wont let this meme die
Fixing 2 computers where I study
I'm doing top tier alchemy

Is fireeee
Carol new song doe
Fan service
No explanation
Miku getting ready for bikki
Just fits so well for good news
God final commander
Ah
What's YTT
ah
what's hamon
Asian genetics i guess?
And i look older than her
im turning 24 soon
eternal youth
it's the gear
it's soooooooo unfair
And look like in her 20's
Nana be 39
How can
i'm so done
hikasa is 34 wtf?
all the songs from sympho?
what's sympho radio
Ah
How is it related to XV
Isn't pachinko a game?
And yoko hikasa is bae
But she did nothing
I adore maria
I mean i love maira honestly
Can they at least kill maria?
If they kill some one
and in ep13 a conclusion
Imo bikki and miku should be the main focus up until ep 12
Nothing is planned ahead
with all due respecrt
I mean its symphogear
End it in a tragic way
We have a build up for a tragic ending
Yeah but why doe
bittersweet
That's what makes a good ending
And then the first scene in season1 ep1 can make sense
Bikki saves miku but bikki dies
Miku vs biki until the end of the season
How i want XV to end
BEST ALL
BEST GIRL
BEST BOI
VERR
Props to nana on today's episode
Honestly doe
Symphogear xv ep9:Maria finally does something
might be Fine?
After the shoe frame
The curse is gone after a slap nice way to ruin a build up...
When maria slapped basa
Something that kinda pissed me off
keep em dead
lol true
too bad it lasted for like 3minutes
Tsubasa has been mentally tortured on the last episode
You know what im saying?
I mean every one is asking why you attack the moon but nobody is asking how does the moon feel
Do they hate the moon
why
his a robot doe
You liked nude adam?
I kinda wanna see maria getting beaten to a bloody pulp
Ok lets move on!
NOOOOOOOOO HE DIED DX
She forgets everything in a few minutes
Thing is
^
Like akame ga kill
i really hope it wont be like let's kill all of them for a shock factor and a rushed ending
||First her dad then her crush||
kinda hope so
Doe*
||Is maria really dead?||
Honestly die
But they will some how
They cant
Low tuned 7strings guitars
Songs
The only good thing about ignite
^
Holy shit
But the ||Maria Spoiler||
So i wont be suprised
I mean so far they brought back everything
it died with s3
<@148471428738449408>  there wont be any ignite
||She's dead||
Hey look maria is useful
and it can make the first episode in s1 to make some sense
<@232453121710751745>  if all the trio dies it can be a solid ending
||Use this format only please||
How would you like symphogear to end?
ok guys since we near the end
If this episde is going to be a training montage
oof
is ||Maria alive?||
With their new over powered mode
They dont need to train aanymore
oof
training montage close to the end
i'll jump off a cliff
damn i hope so
Think so
||Not a spoiler just wanted to tell you happy geah day <3||
ikr?
||NR ARE ALIVE AND KICKING THANKS TO MIKU|| click at your own risk
a friend of mine watched the raw
My waifu üò¶

i thought the whole point of this season is to torture basa
<@!225771411833225216>  yeah oof
That's ||Earth||
DESS
she says death doe
Yes you can
yes
Why was there ||Less than 10 DESS in this episode||
Why did they ||Wait for the rocket to be destroyed in order to transform||
How did ||Maria survive that they broke her throat||
about ep10
I have so many questions
DESS
VER
Some one say
Did
Same energy
When noble red attacked maria
You know when i saw this maria scene what poped into my head?
True
Basa had a tiny bit of good time
Venessa is a swiss army knife
Why was there ||A bayblade fight||
I think we are over thinking it
Panicing in DESS
And nana <33333333333
Hikasa yuko <3333333333
with top tier screams
Aoi yukki is still a top tier va
Miku and index are the same voice
but you can at least try a litlle bit harder
i know it's the same VA
You sound like index
I was like
When shem ha spoke
Especialy when they have no idea what to do next
True i always thought that 13episodes is not enough
all of them have plot armor
omegaLUL
death flags in symphogear?
But i love her ‚ù§
Basa keeps being a dissapointment to her family
"guys, this rocket is the symbol of what yatsuhiro left for us protect it at all cost!"
