This is what it looks like if yoi try to add a flair on the sub.
How about adding user flairs to the subreddit?
Good evening.
We'll only see when the BluRays are out.
Shirabe's was defo complete.
Am I the only one who feel like something was cut from her TF as well?
I wanted the Noble Red to win because of brains and not because they can overpower the gears with sheer strength.
dats lame af tho
I wanted to see OPAF geahs
I call nerf "because plot"
***JIIII***

DAfuq
Yeah, at the end of AXZ Dainsleif kinda melted during the Rebuild Transformation
Yeah, even though the original Rebuild Transformation was apparently equal in power to the X-Drive
Well, they defo seem stronger than the GX/AXZ gears, but not by much
I thought that the Rebuid Gear are meant to be more powerful than their old forms, yet this is the first time Chris needed to reload.
Speaking of Chris' weapons
That's kind of the part that seems missing, chris messing around with her weapons.
We'll see
They mentioned Kirika
I feel that something is still missing from Chris
Sirabe and Hibiki seem to be the only ones with full TFs so far.
I just wanna say that the twist at the end was really freaking predictable if your read the extra material.
Voyeur seems to be in need of some headpats
Mik needs to do something
^
Can I just say, he wants Tsubasa to be a Protector, but he wants her to not sind, when without singing the girl can't even use Ame-no-Habakiri
it do
He probably just wants to purge the weak and impure from Japan
That's a good fuckin' point.
I assume in the end the Noble Red will have their redemption and Tsub's Grandpa will turn into a monster for Hibiki to "FINAL COMMANDER" to death.

I prefer "Revolver Yukine"
I needed a break to lmao, I'm not on here often and that bot broke me.
This gets me every time.

I don't quite get that.
Millhi what exactly is so dangerous about this amount of animators thoigh?
