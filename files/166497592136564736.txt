Thank you
She's not my absolute favorite, but I'm gonna cosplay her soon so the avatar seemed appropriate
Thanks üòÅ
That's the best kind of Discord server
This place seems nice
That's right

Welcome to the club
Welcome back, Wobbles
Hello and welcome
Welcome, stick around, have a good time
Fran was the only one I really needed
<:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
My bride is here
Am I doing it right?

Her grin is AWESOME
I was sure you'd seen it already, glad to hear you like it

Must be famous or something
Not that I've ever tried making cosplay üòÖ
I want to make a cosplay like that

CAPE!
Does anyone have the original version(s) of this art? It's in the background of the subreddit
<:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
<https://twitter.com/MEIJI_PKMN/status/1026088698012622848>
Okay, acceptable
Do I have another Fran friend now?
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
Like, *why*
That was such a weird part of her backstory
What happened to her mom anyway?

I love that one
Heh
https://twitter.com/non_9/status/949299257256718336
And it's about twenty times longer than my patience for reading
It's mostly an action fantasy story with mythical heroes, modern mages and a lot of talk about heroism and ideals
One of the three routes had just one
Yeah, though it didn't have that many sex scenes
But it's kind of all over the place
Quite a bit, even
It's got story
fair enough
What the fuck is it not?
Thanks for sharing the art

Hibiki when her balls hadn't dropped yet
she's gonna "befriend" every cute antagonist
Nessherazade
Even though we don't know each other yet, I hope you'll be able to raise your spirits soon
Which I recently learned is a savage practice
I actually use scissors for my nails
Also, serious channel
I like making trolly replies and then deleting ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
I'm just poking fun at myself btw
tfw you're a programmer who likes thighhighs AND wants to be a girl but ISN'T trans
Jousai Senjo!
I don't mind talking about it, but really I have no issue with being a man
Eh
I'm quite happy indeed
\*shrug*
I struggled with my gender for some years, but eventually I just decided I was me
I've seen a few things through Alice
Alice Jr
Radical
The only Fergus I know is a Celtic hero
Sleep well
The rest is window dressing
Striving to be a better person is the only belief people need to have imo

Ouch
What's going on, Wolf?
Sounds cool
<@286185404758228992> too bad you're taken
...of Belgium
Most children would still parrot "for boys/girls", which could make things tough for your child
I'm calling the gender police
Society seems to love putting "for boys" or "for girls" on everything, and you'll have to explain that
Well done
Get well soon
Amazing
True
Ouch, I'm sorry to hear that
Or is this some sort of ritual?
Like, is it just because they want to talk abour the baby and don't have anything else to remark?
The "it's a girl! We've got x girls now!" stuff I've been seeing in my mom's side of the family really bothers me
If I ever have a kid, I might just not tell my family their sex
Damn right
How about taking the middle road? Going with the kid's sex as their gender, but not trying to "code" them as such?
It creeps me out
Ever noticed how when a child is born, the family instantly starts talking about gender with all of their might?
Also ring up the Vatican, your boss might be a saint
I wish you all the best, Kriisa
This all sounds like a severe case of "Not In My Back Yard"-ism
HOW DOES SHE KNOW WHAT'S THIS OR THAT
What on earth
Oof
I hope you can endure another month
I think I do
No, but those conflicts are over and done
wfc, you too take a deep breath
Oh, sorry
Hazel has already made it explicit she'll be dismissing solopy's comments
This isn't going anywhere
People, please
I get the impression neither solopy or Hazel will be considering each other's viewpoints
Which probably includes "don't dismiss someone's opinion for their background"
How about we follow the "Don't be a dick" rule from now on
Yorin, what did you mean by that?
Hazel was being terrible, but I don't like the way people responded either
And even then it was a huge leap
I had no way to to tell what you meant until you explained it
But apparently that's okay because she said wrong things
Hazel just left the server because she felt mocked for being a woman
What's your point?
Ouch
Non-apologies are the worst üòí
I'm sorry to hear that you couldn't handle our cutting-edge comedy
Why are you against a total ban?
Terribleness just perpetuates if nobody intervenes
that was a touching story
I can't comprehend that as a real thing
"I'll buy the razor blades" WHAT THE FUCK
Already got it
I'll watch it
No good judgement can result in a shooting
It's a fucking shooting
Too fast, it feels like
The internet did bring many good things too (this server right here) but it's altogether an upheaval for society
Echo chambers too
3000 BC?
What's too much?
I think it's good that you care
it'd be best if your caring paid off, though I'm not sure how you'd make that happen
Besides Symphogear and JoJo, I've finished three
~~CGI horses~~
It'll be worth the wait
I think it's still pretty great at times

Gotta wait for quantum computing
Don't risk it
IT HAS MEGA IN IT SO IT MUST BE A LOT
Anyone who could use some more drops? (F/GO)
I think this is what you need?
With genocide
Carol playthrough?
It was fun to watch happen
I agree
~~Sinterklaas event when~~
Hmm
Only character I could think of who'd play significantly different
And *g e n o c i d e*
