You have roughly 12 hours left of the show... easily do able in a day! <:Ver:336656981144109066>
<:HibikiHi:336657249827028993> Welcome!
When they showed up in was screeching like a school girl
I can't even right now
Right, but thats why only for a month
Well, it would get rid of gender, and race. Everyone would be the same
And rants are good, they need to be let out once and awhile
I wish, that for a month everyone could just be a grey blob
Yeah
Like, I agree with learning from the past. But we need to look at more recent history and go off that. What happened hundreds of years ago wont fly today
Sadly most of those "values" are created by by a system that is used to control the masses and to protect the higher ups
Why do people care what others do to their body
Bloody hell
Yeah...
17 and a half?! Damn...<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
We should question everything. 
Why is something the way it is. What makes it up.

Rational thought and learning is based off that.

Schools should teach that mentality of they dont
Questions are super important
As a uni drop out all I can say is: don't sleep in and do your homework.

But what Meta says is true break everything down into smaller segments and work on it from there
It's scary, but you have people you can fall back on.
Haha
Thats good to hear! 
I do the same when I find a new job... take a few weeks inbetween
not so bad then
ooooh
G'night
Didn't pornhub say you can upload there, and get followers and the like?
Yeah, that happened to me, and then uni happen XD.
Soon you will have freedom!
