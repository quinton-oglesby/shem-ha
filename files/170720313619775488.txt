I figure
I mean yeah
Maybe?
Also, this is a bit unrelated, but uhh, anyone know where that Shirabe I see everyone running with comes from? The one that can heal a ton?
I doubt I could poke anything even if I wanted to
But I'm also a pretty damned impulsive spender
but it's way more than I would've liked to spend
I mean I know this ain't "whales" level of spending
So yeah, a lot
More than 100$ (CAD)
I'm afraid to do the math
Sadly I'm probably gonna need a ton of those too since I have almost no RBreaking materials
I've got 2 going on, if someone has the damage and time to help with that I'd love it

There, ID's in the name now
Ah, got my ID
Once find it ðŸ˜›
Ok can do
Trully impressive numbers I'm sure
Well I did a normal and a Hard one that are open ATM, I managed to 6k to the hard one, and 9k to the normal one
Sounds good, thanks ðŸ™‚
So yeah, IDK how raids work in here, but if someone in here has some time to give some help, I'd appreciate it a lot ðŸ™‚
just wanted to give some context ðŸ˜›
Well, I came here cause I was about to ask for raid help ðŸ˜›
Since I only have 2 LB5 cards and none RB, I'm kinda struggling to do the normal and hard raids I need to RB those cards
Pleasure is mine
Got myself new cards from the Miku event (I may have spent a bit more money then I should've)
Pretty new to the game and all
Hi y'all
ðŸšŒ
Eh, that's fair
and even then I lost most of those
I know, but it took a lot of refreshes before I found someone I thought I could even compete with lol
Easier said than done lol
Oh and the time someone purposefully put a sole level 1 unit as their party
Except that one time I got lucky and found someone more unlucky than me
The little I tried I can't say I really managed to uhh, win any matches really
Way I see it you have to win in PVP to get any amount of stones, right?
I'm not ready for pvp
Oh dear
Events?
Save from like the couple you get from daylies and weeklies, what are the inputs of stones once you've completed the story?
As a slightly related question, how does one save up stones in this game
That's why I decided to fully commit with the money on this one, then (hopefully) not do that again
Oof
So for a bunch of banners you just half committed
Oh, I see
so much money invested
Ok but then why throwing the account away?
Why
Oof
I kinda do
And TBF I quite enjoy both the units I got
Then I figured I might as well commit all the way ðŸ˜›
I just started a bit dumb and put a couple rolls in the latest banner like "eh, why the hell not"
Yeah for the future that is definitely the plan
On the downside I also joined with like ... 5 or 6 days left to the banner, so I still had to buy stones since I didn't have the time to farm for them before the banner ran out
On the plus side side I just started the game I could still do the story missions to get a constant stream of stones, which means I didn't have to spend money for _all_ of those 14 rolls
Yeah I figure
I got to the 14th 11roll to get 6 copies of both of them
Yeah that's basically what I did with the "light that pierces the cloud" banner
You could've said "just pull the permanent gacha until you pull a 5*, _and_ hope you roll a copy of her. Then repeat that 5 more times"
Could be worse
Ok so basically I can hope that at some point the banner will be back and then I can spent entirely too much money on getting her?
The exact name is "Final [alpha] Style, Soaring Samsara"
Was wondering more if she came from a specific gacha
