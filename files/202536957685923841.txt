it was one of the keywords in G
i mean, it could just be vanessa fucking with maria
at least something has to be going on with maria/serena/apple

aren't they hinting pretty heavily at maria
so maybe miku's just going to appear real fast
they said last time that the reason bikki took so long to materialize was because she also had the gungnir's god-slaying power
lol
wonder if the americans are going to get involved again
it's behind her for some reason even though her bag dropped in front of her
just what happened with miku's phone
actually speaking of plot holes i wonder
they didn't actually get free movement until after AXZ i think?
i mean while G was going on, Noble Red were still just being test subjects by the illuminati right
i mean the fact that millaarc doesn't know what to do with miku before vanessa tells her also
he was heavily involved with the hibiki incident too
i mean fudou might know just because he has access, he can probably put 2 and 2 together
but even the symphogear users didn't know about it
since i don't think it was part of his plan to use miku with the gauntlet
i'm sure fudo knows but i don't know why he would tell them
i wonder how noble red found out about miku though
adam namedropped the annunuki
they're supposed to be prehistoric humanity before the curse of balal or something
it's kind of a lot of failed autoscorers if that's all they are lol
i mean for a series whose working scorers ended at the number 20
can't wait to see what else carol is in to if we get new autoscorers
going to dig up carol's dark history again
she's such an asshole to everyone
i still really like garie tbh

tbf it actually does look really cool
millaarc's 🚮
like how carol kills herself in gx
it's probably an alchemist thing
almost made me nostalgic for the really shitty s1 animations
the transformation aside the animation in the latter half seemed kind of awkward though
leiur vs chris was too amazing
at least leiur had the coolest fight
or at all
leiur's sister didn't talk that much i guess
yes
lol
it literally has like an umbilical cord leading down
gx
i forgot the 3rd season name
err not xv
close enough
he came back in like xv and axz
twice
ver already had his chance to come back
man i can't wait to see fudo's reaction
and there were like 20 of each of them
imagine if all of the autoscorers became activated like that lol
so yeah
they probably were activated by elfnein right
well i mean they're just backups
imagine finally being brought back after 2 season and 7 episode and then dying in 10 minutes
symphogear train never ends
and next episode is definitely going to be even more hype
r i p
and then jii died to noise
yeah
and that was after oblitearting jii and dm
well not ignite but the reinforced  gears
that was ignite basa and chris
when was that
she... didn't?
to record the melody
because she had to kill herself when they reach the moment of enough phonic gain or whatever
and i mean come on she literally just jumped between their incredibly obvious combo attack
before she decided to kill hreself
full power micha was beating up ignite jii/scythe
like they literally all threw
the auto-scorers held back literally the entire season of gx
it's hard to say because like
like apart from that
i mean fudo has his thing with tsubasa but he's also kind of being set up as a main antagonist too
how many episodes is it, 12 or 13
between miku, elfnein/carol, noble red, fudo, tsubasa, maria
lol
there's so  many plotlines that i don't know how they'll wrap everything up niceyl
well i mean that was pretty clear since the first episode lol
yeah
though the design is still pretty clearly based on her i think lol
at least not yet
at least we know that the divine power thing isn't /literally/ miku
where is fudo anyway
lol
maybe
i guess carol will mop up noble red then fudo will show up
yeah...
eeh
but not at the point where they fight the baby thing
transmission
or i guess they do after elfnein's transition
SONG still don't really know for sure that miku is the source of the divine power right
plus she's literally right outside the room where miku is
but it's not fully manifested yet and noble red clearly no match for her anyway
carol would just wipe everything up before the cm break
if she had that power level still then we wouldn't even need the rest of the season
but it would be hype
yeah i don't expect that again lol
anyway
i mean it's already pretty handwaved considering carol burned pretty much everything before
idk just killing her off again would be kinda lame
yeah probably
i can't believe they brought carol back and yet we'll still never get this scene
"i told them to turn the thing into a sword why is there this divine power baby shit above the chateau"
i wonder what was her rationale for turning her hand into a vibrator
three?
how many hands did she go through anyway
needs another one
because she acts like such a slob all the time lol
she "unexpectedly" has good grades
i mean vanessa's literal entire body is a weapon... i don't think she is going to lose in that department even to chris
LOL
vanessa would just draw out her other finger
i mean it's chris
don't try this at home
for lending her all those gunkata dvds
it's genjuuro's fault
i'm a bit sad that elfnein didn't get the bust size upgrade like carol did
especially bc that came out of literally nowhere
chris shooting tsubasa in the back was also up there
G had a lot of really rough moments lol
lol
the week after the g episode where the tower explodes with miku in it was pretty rough
you get used to it.... but yeah it's mean
aren't you used to it by now
it's symphogear literally every episode is a cliffhanger
i'll wait as well
why does the american president look like trump in axz lol
nuke japan again?
what are the americans gonna do
oh yeah i forgot about the americans too
that miku hibiki scene...
to be fair chris did just literally blow herself up
lol
rewatching a bit and man it feels like the part they paid the most attention to animating was vanessa getting the teleportation out of her chest
if you're not elfnein
maybe
well i mean it's possible to resist it, at least...
sadly micha can't do that
hmm
why did they even take elfnein
actually what i want to know
that would be amazing
LOL
my hope is that she wrecks noble red then jobs to fudo
the lion showing up was pretty cool at least
that just means that fudo is going to make his move sooner
for real
man the people who drive the helicopters in symphogear must be the bravest people
so i dunno
i mean it's called "Sword Breaker"
does that make more or less sense than it blowing up tsubasa because tsubasa thinks of herself as a sword
flawless
"if you swung it like a sword, that makes it a sword"
i wonder if the fact that shirabe's the receptor of fine will ever be relevant again
on the frontier
after she reached the moon
what if it's mam reborn
lol
ssj is purple because of miku <:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
the white/purple is just miku color, isn't it? at least that's my impression

it's not even the actual true power of it yet
but man the symphogears lost to literally just an emergency purge of the divine power
lol
that is true
i just noticed that the bottom of chris's guns iss literally a knife
maybe in zesshoushinai
i'm sad that it's probably too late to have vanessa getting her hands blown up be a running gag
just look at chris LOL
one of them always shakes if that's what you mean
like what is this lol
i'm sorry i just can't even with this next episode preview lol
you can check the previous ones
ic
hm
is it carol
ep 7
i think it's ayahi singing but idk
what song is this anyway
btw i just noticed the ED for ep7 is different than the others
and then that title card
but it's only episode 8
it feels like the penultimate episode
this episode is actually incredible
this is the true symmetrical docking
yeah
the gear is pretty blatantly ssj though
ponytail miku is back
she gets a ponytail
or maybe milaarc has more vampire powers than just having the stained glance <:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
maybe they just drank it this time cuz i don't think they had the time to just lie around and attach iv drops to each other
very much like garie
i like how garie's stream just fucks off and doesn't bother attacking anything
orz
Noble Red truly is the second coming of FIS they are all doing the maria pose OTL
schrodinger's miku
btw i really enjoy how faked out the show is with the divine power baby thing
~~so it's the same as when she does have it~~
"i accidentally dropped my luggage last time, this time i will protect it with my life"
*giant energy wave of death is exploding at noble red*
elsa: better get the luggage
when the beam grazes her ear thing
x-drive and it's only the 8th episode....
if we got amalgam forms with noble red as stands
oh right
actually i had a better theory but i forgot it
i bet the twist is that we are going to get last boss maria
shenshoujin has the symphogear power of plot
ponytail miku <:MikuBliss:336657233712513024>
take a week to breathe until next episode
rip
i really hope so
rip
i still wonder how fudou expects to control shemha tho
miku and hibiki are going to gattai inside the baby thing ~~in my dreams~~
i dunno i don't think those pants parts will fit on the screen in xdu lmao
amalgam can be "operation gold" or "operation yellow"
too bad no more ignite
i want an "operation black" for when they go berserk
it already return in xdu <:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
well at this point if you don't expect spoilers from there you have bigger problems
that is miku's line from the first season, isn't it? lol
give fujitaka a transformation sequence
fudou was fine even before ryoko was fine
FUDOU -> FINE
i will puke blood if the twist is that "fudou is without sin like miku and bikki"
or wherever
like what if shemha is like fuck this i want to go back to egypt
i still just don't get how fudou is going to control shemha though
so what was the point of mindraping tsubasa again
like they did with the lapis philosophorum
meh they will asspull something out i'm sure
maybe amalgam mode will pull through
and happened to talk to you know who
and we know one other person who was messing around in the memory device
cuz we know carol suvive cuz elf9 mess around with the memory device
what if dr ver takes over maria's body
i mean if dr ver wasn't literally dead then maybe
lol
in the OP it looks like hibiki is going to blow up the moon
is miku really going to blow up the moon
unless he gets to go out and punch fudou
lol
genjuurou really isn't going to get a chance to leave the command room this season is he
magical girls fighting for magic shit
yeah
you should
but who knows
well it's only episode 8 so probably not the last boss
lol
idk if it's just me but her amalgam-mode charge looked kind of like a 1p vitalization
name one time where miku did something that didn't turn out completely horribly
unlike axz where divine power just kinda turned them into monster shit
it's kind of neat that shemha is like, actually a conscious being though
miku slept on the bottom one actually
<:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
lol
miku is definitely a top
no way
in fact she already predicted the fisting in episode 1
it's ok miku already consented to the fisting
DUR DA BLA DATTO
zwei wing song would be neat
if they were like stands
that would be super hype i wouldn't even care
lol
and the americans doing shit
first season is the fine scarlet giant dragon thing
like if you look at it
lol
okay in all fairness to fudou, the main reason he is going this hard now is because he's tired of all the bullshit happening in japan the last 4 seasons
JAPAN
also he uses his fucking arm as a sword
idk i though the adam reveal was really good
just saying
hey if adam won none of this shit would have been happening
who deserves the power more, fudou or adam
i mean all the henshins involve them getting naked
fudou: just according to keikaku
y
next up is fudou henshin
fine did say that she incarnated a bunch and progressed history
i mean most of htat shit is probably either the custodians or fine lul
yeah but shit happens in history so
i think it's implied that the custodians/annunaki are a different race than humans
tbh
it would be pretty sick if the US launched nukes and then shem-ha was like lol what do you think you're doing and just erased them
and this time it's actually completely done (or near so)
i mean, last time the divine power manifested....
do you think america will nuke japan this season
fudou will just be like give me that shit to tsubasa and take her symphogear
lol
if we got 5 episodes of miku being a complete dominating god i would be ok with that too
it's possible
so i guess we know it can do that
and sing apple
well it did blow up that dude when he tried to wear the bracelet
i mean i wasn't expecting it to be like adam
the fetus opening up was pretty surprising tbh
if you tatlk about throwing, miku isn't going to lose in that department either
lol
please
in fact she's kind of already doing that right now
miku would definitely be the one to go homura in that case
lol
what are the odds that miku actually dies this season
idk i like METANOIA a lot

ikr
lol
i mean shem-ha kind of literally does already have the infinity gauntlet
i think
so there's that too lol
actually ver is also american
fudou does kind of have a good reason to be like "fuck this shit i'm tired of all this, time to get divine power so nobody fucks with japan again"
so like
fourth season is all the divine power bullshit and ON TOP OF THAT the americans try to nuke japan again
third season is literally carol and the autoscorers fucking up all of japan to use the leylines and then almost annihilating the world
second season is FIS (more americans) ruining shit, ver running around with solomon's cane spamming noise everywhere
the ending is also the title card XV into METANOIA
i'm sure miku will be fine
xv aside
i wonder what the final boss power rankings would be
tbh i'm glad carol just stomped noble red
no brakes on the symphogear hype train
everything else is godlike though
my only complaint is that the pants look kind of goofy on the end screen because they're like, literally as tall as her entire body
and combined it into one perfect scene
it's like they took maria's signature pose and shirabe/kirika's constant LINKER overdosing
i hope it's noble red in ORZ pose vomiting blood
and too stronly
i mean they put all those safeguard and shit around it and they /still/ had to flush the baby out cuz it manifested too early
yeah but you don't know what will happen so attaching the divine power more slowly is safer
take it slower instead
lol
given what happened to the last person who tried to put it on
probably safer to not put the bracelet on her
and that was just like a fragment of the bracelet's power
that baby thing was definitely way stronger than god-tiki
heck it's probably stronger than the divine power in axz lol
it's probably stronger than a completed relic too tbh
it's definitely stronger than ssj
we know maria is a receptor child (distantly descended from fine?) and her ancestors passed the song down
she then pulls out red hot blaze but then fudou escapes before it can fire
chris pulls her revolver to try and shoot fudou, but it jams
shirabe turns back into fine
perfect way to end the series is miku and hibiki on a date
it's only episode 8
are people going to survive another 5 episodes of this? lol
miku - ruining everything
just for the sheer amount of hate that would generate from the fandom
i feel bad for millaarc for saying this, but it would actaully be amazing if elsa and vanessa died and millaarc lived on
it's the same line as from GX
7 billion zesshou and all that lol
well yeah
tsubasa is certainly approaching edginess levels appropriate for that at least
it's ok they will just do ignite without dainslaif
watch out if IRL trump ever puts his hand on the button
ikr
what if america deserves it
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
sword uses a different kind of red
yeah there's definitely somthing going on with the kazanari bloodline lol
betrayal and economically friendly
he just gave them normal blood instead of xxoil blood i guess
well i mean, it is her body after all
not just have her disappear with nobody around except elf9
if they are going to kill miku off they are going to make a giant show of it
there is no way that they are going to off miku like this lol
the animation this episode was pretty ridiculous though
plot aside
rebellion was a cool movie
it's already bittersweet ~because we know that after this there's no more symphogear anime
fudo in shinai sounds like the most hilarious thing ever
and fudo
i can't wait to see noble red in shinais
hibiki isn't the type to despair
most series don't start with a girl crying over the main character's grave
to be fair symphogear 1 was a pretty suffering end at the very start lol
lol
yeah
oh
what do you mean by sympho trend
if the ending is "miku becomes god and shemha kills everyone" that would be something at least
are you sure shem-ha had a previous user
in a super coffin
but i mean, it was buried under antarctica
i guess
cuz it was wearing the bracelet
the mummy is presumably shemha
yeah
idk
LOL
at least
we know shem-ha doesn't appreciate being called miku
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
it's thanks to fudou that elfnein is alive
elfnein would be dead as fuck
man imagine if fudou didn't betray noble red
i think it was just happening over time tbh
eh
well hibiki did get super injured last time from the divine power
i mean it was just a timer right
idk to me it just seeemed like it just happened to happen
with miku-shemha pretending it's dbz
not next episode preview but ep pv
that was already godlike
i mean there's that next episode preview
i feel like the curse was already prepared but enki was the one who activated it
i wonder why enki was like, literally dying though
idr how the saying goes, but sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic
that's true
wonder if the japan/us moon expedition is going to be relevant
humans created the noise to kill each other
i mean the curse is the reason why the noise exist in the first place
it's "the bracelet of shem-ha" i think
isn't maria a custodian
but the noise attacked the concert
wasn't she
she was the wielder of solomon's cane
second place might be chris with the attack on the concert in s1 too which is kind of funny
noble red got higher body count in 1 episode than most villains got in the last 4 seasons combined
which seems unlikely
that would imply that shem-ha would have to retreat for some reason
inb4 this is actual canon
https://twitter.com/zoidzero1/status/1165454839305973760
shem-ha doesn't really seem like in the talkative mood though
isn't enki a custodian
shem-ha... doesn't really seem the same as enki though
are the "custodians" the same as the "gods" or "annunaki"?
maybe
i forgot
actually what happened with the frontier anyway
feels bad
and never do anything about it
they've had the wreckage of the kadingir for literally like since the end of s1
they're going to renovate the kadingir and use that to shoot down the moon
fudou is actually a thousand years old
ver is literally fine
ver invented it before any of you were even born
inb4 the xxoil blood is actually a primitive form of LiNKER
considering they're currently bleeding out and i'm pretty sure fudou has all the blood at this point
that would imply that noble red would be able to use daedalus end again, which seems difficult
at this point
well yeah the illuminati is mostly dissolved
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
i feel like they've gotten stronger
alcanoise didn't have segways before this season
i dunno man
two of them aren't even alchemists though
even noble red can use alcanoise lol
i mean with the way they spend them the recipe can't be that hard
alca-noise are just different than the noise tbh
solomon's cane or alcanoise
without the cane
did we ever see her summon noise
i'm sad we never got a keyword for "put your hands up"
yeah
i mean, we don't know what the coffin was going to do
honestly i'm fine with them not being in axz
so we knew it was going to happen
i mean fudou was literally shown in the end of axz
i mean how would you even show them they're just in the middle of nowhere being experimented on
inb4  kirika is a descendant of enki
i mean they've been hinting at maria's past being important for a while now
close enough
so who knows
symphogear introduced hibiki's dad with like 5 episodes left i think
the bracelet kept humming it after all
i wonder if we'll get miku singing apple
tsubasa is cursed enough that maybe she doesn't even need dainsleif to go into ignite mode rn lol
after all adam said he wanted to do everything before the annunaki returned
we don't konw
and they would come back to earth
or that the coffin would send a signal to the annunaki or whatever
i mean it's possible that it would have been able to revive the corpse or something had the symphogears not destroyed the coffin
wasn't it going to happen over time because of the ice shifting or whatever
wouldn't it
? it would have revived sooner or later anyway
maybe it would have revived the corpse after a while and that would be shem-ha
there was the noise i guess
if you didn't maybe it's not referred to you
it's not like sg just hands it out to everyone
plus cag and prelati are like hundreds of years old at this point
that too
also it might not even be possible given their body modifications
i mean it's not a plothole, it's because they're trash
idk to me this is like complaining the FIS never gets mentioned in symphogear first season
very blatantly
lol
i mean adam is screwing the three alchemists on purpose
it's kind of like maria's gungnir cape
does hibiki's scarf count as  a weapon
lol
kanade was a gungnir user
starting to run out of places where vanessa's body /isn't/ a weapon
is vanessa going to shoot a missile from her mouth
amalgam mode is kind of like a weapon
what if there's another fragment of dainsleif in the ruins of the underwater museum
lol
in fact why don't they just have maria use hibiki's gungnir when she's injured
will maria get gungnir back
they could turn it back on
what if it makes a fake dr. ver
the chateau did create a fake maam and maria as a defense system
the guy who writes symphogear
but i mean, he was there when they were finishing the linker
what if dr. ver is the linker
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
and we know carol revived herself from that memory device
i mean ver was in maria's subconscious when she was using the memory device to get the last part of linker
the autoscorers might count?
i think
after she died
in axz
well even before the force ghost she came back
saint germain came back
and the gungnir junk from hibiki's chest
they brought back carol
iirc
durandal and the nephustan armor destroyed each other
got destroyed at the end of s1 when fine got blown up
lmao
with maria's voice
can you imagine ver doing his LAST ACTION HERO poses shit in maria's body
the image of ver and maria in the same body is too good
my favourite is still "ver takes over maria's consciousness like carol did with elfnein"
originally millaarc only had orders to capture elfnein
only after the fact
and she's like "wtf why is nothing happening"
inb4 shemha tries to summon noise but can't because the treasury of babylon got incinerated
so he had to have had some plan for it
i mean he didn't originally plan on capturing miku
maybe his original plan was to try and fire up the chateau and use that to make the vambrace into something usable
maybe
i mean i think it's implied that he doesn't want her to use the symphogear anymore
that's how strong he is
he killed 3 of noble red and saved elfnine without even being near the chateau
but instead he's just like "nah let's just use miku cuz she's lying around here"
yeah but i thought he would use her with the vambrace somehow
i still wonder if there's a point in fudo doing all this shit to tsubasa or if he's just doing it cuz he's an asshole
we could get nephilim arm fuudo
what if dr ver had a secret stash of nephilim linker lying around
lol
uh, we know it is a relic
maybe one of those relics is what made that defense system
i mean she did say the chateau was made up of multiple relics
heck, shem-ha could probably turn it on
it's alchemical combustion i guess
i really hope we see either genjuuro vs shemha or genjuurou vs fudo
tbf after breaking out of the labyrinth she might have been vulnerable had fudo not been a backstabbing asshole
fudou absorbs the divine power would be the funniest twist
we don't know ssj is complete, do we
what could possibly go wrong this time
chris almost beat ssj last time Kappa
maybe the americans will do something
since it's hard to imagine them dealing with shem-ha that early.... but there has to be some payoff for the tsubasa shit
in terms of like, plot
tbh shem-ha happening this early throws a huge wrench into things, doesn't it? lol
i mean we don't know where the dark room he's in is
the real A plot was the whole hibiki/miku drama
look how far it's come
it's pretty funny how the original symphogear is just fine screwing around while waiting to build her kadingir
this shit literally murdered the guy who put it on
i mean most relics anyone can use them
it's probably stronger than a relic
look at how badly even just the random baby power wrecked them
i mean tbqh even without ssj i'm pretty sure shemha would still obliterate the symphogears
i honestly don't recall miku's dad ever appearing
it turns out hibiki's dad was american all along
america launches another nuke but this time hibiki absorbs it with amalgam and turns into nuclear powered amalgam
miku does have a tendency to lose control and do really dumb shit when hibiki is involved
i mean with the whole shadow shit and everything
the only one i can see going berserk this season is tsubasa
season 1 and 2
yeah
it's not happening
chris getting mad at bikki calling her chris-chan and then miku just calling her chris with no honorifics is too good
chris will never get any respect
tegami maybe?
<:MariaShock:423196877354303498> TL
OTL
it's not like she did it for fun
i mean it was literally her job
apparently shul-shugana and igalima are the blades of the goddess zababa or something
i think the peak of poor decisions is when maria ends up in her signature pose in the frontier and ver tells her to think about how to repopulate the earth
or mom
though if you talk about poor choices in G doesn't maria take the cake
probably the phase where she thinks she's fine
those autoscorers don't just feed themselves you know
we don't know that for carol either
tbf fine's deathcount would be a lot higher if the symphogears didn't stop her from dropping the moon on the earth
it probably depends on how you blame solomon's cane deaths
what do you mean by power
i guess since they turn into carbon as well
the old noise only killed like 20k or 30k people or something idr
i mean in that she's the only one that's actually talked to hibiki
lol
alcanoise are a lot better at killing humans than regular noise
tbh that part really struck for me was that
elsa is the mascot of the group, vanessa and mostly millaarc's jobs are to do horrible shit so elsa doesn't have to
i mean they covered it up with that explosives thing so that kind of presumes the government was in on it at least
70000 people dead but the thing that probably got people the most mad was millaarc killing that girl in front of tsubasa
yeah my assumption was that fudou told them to do it
"so i can talk to my long lost god lover"
i thought fine's thing was "i literally don't give a fuck about anything except blowing up the moon"
the alchemist trio in axz plus defense minister hiroki in s1
if we only count deaths of named characters the highest body count is probably the americans lol
and carol too
if the symphogear didn't stop them
fine and ver would have had no problems literally killing every other human on earth
but i mean a lot of these are just like whether the symphogears stopped them or no
but they got better so it doesn't really count
lol if you count carol's chateau of tiffauges then she would have the highest
i mean if you blame all the noise attacks on fine
oh man that title
next episode
fudo is really trying to challenge ver for "Best faces in symphogear" award
we could get more zesshoushinais
all of the branches lead to death
~~flash of murakumo~~
~~tfw the new XDU card is literally tsubasa using fudou's sword~~
this is quite the screen to use for sponsors lmao
not the thing on the moon
ah i meant the giant pillar of light
the explosion at the end is pretty obviously miku/shemha, right
to be fair they are only two letters apart it's easy to mix them up <:Ver:336656981144109066>
kendama
prelati probably had some really lame looking attacks in axz with her thing
the title and the wrong description are a pretty funny combination though
there are some really good segments and some segments that are... not so good
it's hit and miss
and it's nice to get a cliffhanger that is "wtf is this going to mean" rather than "hahahaha have fun waiting for the next episode"
holy fuck this episode surpassed my wildest expectations
so the one who made the shenshoujin faust robe is vanessa, i guess?
shirabe just tags along
i mean it's even kirika's idea to go to the hospital
even then kirika steals all the spotlight in those scenes
they're just there
shirabe and kirika aren't even a central part of that
well the first ep is the coffin that's whatever
so far shirabe did literally nothing this season
when will shirabe do something
so the real question is
ah no i mean when he tried to reactivate it
was it maria
isn't milaarc pretty dead? that's why the seal stopped working
she's probably all mechanical shit from the waist down
i mean she's a fucking robot
vanessa is the only one i doubt tbh
they probably have an album
i kind of enjoyed them
plus how are they supposed to know there is alcanoise at fuzanari residence lol
where the only way to stop them was to let them kll you
i mean it's not like the old noise
probably were going to try to reapply the control but didn't expect shemha to just murder them right after it got turned off
i mean, they were already dying from lack of blood
those aren't really characters
shirabe isn't even relevant enough for me to even consider it
yeah miku is the only one i can possibly see dying and i don't think it's going to happen
i mean we only had like what, 4 characters die this episode?
yasu needs to watch more action movies
but i mean, it's gen
just like how we have 2 noble reds right
just how SUFFERING would that be for basa
imagine if basa didn't stop it and she actually killed gen
probably both
now comes the shem-ha annihilates everything arc?!
doesn't want the shirt to get in the way
cuz he wants tsubasa to kill him
yeah but on the other hand fuck fudou

i guess it's like 呪 and 祝福
imagine if fine had actually blown up the right part of the moon with her kadingir
fudou's line at the end makes me wonder though
don't underestimate him
yatsuhiro is an impossibly strong pencil pusher
well maybe it's because they killed people and basa hasn't
so they'll probably be more lenient
that's more with SONG than the government
though i mean
oh
which betrayal
yeah just in time
imagine if tsubasa ended up in house arrest
also llol bikki really did end up in house arrest
like when they get replaced by the inspector and such
i really like how much focus the bridge bunnies get this season
first elfnein had her action support programming and now this
the chance of hibiki dying is less than zero
no way it happens
and fudou just fucking shot him with a gun
like even tsubasa's dad got more focus than that
yeah isn't that just too fast lol
now she is getting possessed and then while she is possessed she is also getting mind controlled
remember when miku was okay with only getting mind controlled
they will hold the other imperial regalia of japan hostage
maybe he'll escape cuz he's fucking fudou
i dunno
well i mean maybe they can get him the death penatly
fudou is probably going to jail
the true last boss
it would be amazing if the TLB show up and then shemha end up fighting alongside the symphogear
and a zesshoushinai for XV was confirmed iirc
hopefully xdu still keeps getting stories
i think
tbh my problem with axz is just that like the first like 6 episodes are all pretty weak
though i'm not sure between GX and S1 tbh
mine is the same as cypher lol
g probably still my favourite season out of the 4 tbh
i feel like S1 probably would have had them too had it not finished airing by the time i watched
G had a lot of good cliffhangers
i like the "tokyo tower explodes with miku in it" cliffhanger tbh
you could just cut that and the random shot of the dude perving out
oh well
imagine if they just cut that scene and use the remaining time to actually do more of tsubasa's henshin
then again maybe that's why they put it there
imagine if gear's cliffhanger bomb in episode 5 didn't have the hilariously gratuitiously overkill fountain of blood
to me it feel  kind of like a lite version of WIXOSS but yeah i guess this isn't the channel for it lol
girls have magic powers and fight each other in mechs
another anime airing this season
i'm... actually kind of behind on grambelm actually
to me not that many other show come close to how much symphogear make you want to watch the next episode lol
i'm glad we have a break
yeah thankfully after the last 2 eps
and hype
yeah but symphogear has a pretty high amount of cliffhanger compared to other show lol
i started  watching weekly in like, G i think
lol yeah that's the symphogear struggle
just has to flex his muscles
he's probably just like  machio from dumbbelll anime
not even ver or maam gave maria this kind of a beating
i mean what the fuck is this lol
man fudou really might have ver beat in terms of faces and such though
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
it's not shown if it's the same place or not
i dunno
so unless shemha blows it up
i mean, it can be activated remotely apparently
for now
bikki says it but miku lives it
miku is the actual one who is always cursed
binging anime is dangerous
nice
especially this season you can't really watch without seeing the previous ones lol
lol
season 1
i mean didn't it get licensed
gear is getting localized though! so that's a step
also expectedly considering who the voice actor of tsubasa is
sadly
and barely anything gets voiced
well of course
qooapp is the easiest place to find jp games imo
my hype level would actually be out of the world
imagine if we got amalgam form ssj with miku and shem-ha
yeah
so there's still a little more content left after XV
wasn't vitalization the s2 op
symphogazer/vitalization/glorious break/testament
since usually it's the same as the OP, right? except for GX
it also doesn't sound very final attack-like
wonder if we will get METANOIA as a final attack
you know the entire time i was watching gx i was wondering "are they really going to have exteminate as a final attack?" but it ended up being glorious break
the edgybikki story was great though
it's where sg and friends get the antikythera gear
3.5 is between GX and AXZ
the rest probably not
3.5 is canon i tink
tbh the only reason i start xdu is because rerolling on priconne was way too cumbersome
xdu is fun but i wouldn't say it's close to the best mobage i play tbh
man i remember when azur lane was just "chinese ripoff of kancolle"
well, even if xdu did get localized it would be like how many years behind?
but yeah
there are some translations floating around
LOL
tbh i was just wondering before but after this ep i'm pretty sure it will happen
i bet we get fudou in xdu before carol
lmao
meanwhile carol
~~is ogawa your waifu~~
rip
phara could have solved this entire season in 15 seconds if she was hiding there
for sword breaker
would the gauntlet count a sword there
i wonder
final commander is what we would get if the ultimate attack was being done by gen <:GenjuurouThumbsUp:336657189475188740>
hmm

i mean elza
didn't she just fall down
'tis just a flesh wound
not even god can escape miku's curse
miku is so cursed even shemha got cursed after taking over her body
and meanwhile all she wants to do is make up with hibiki and have her not fight anymore
tbh the only reason we know it's enki is cuz it said so in the credits
lol
that was like millenia ago
i mean he was the one who told them to get miku i think
...maybe
since they're literally dying
keep in mind they also like, don't have any time to take it slow
i mean maybe they didn't expect it to happen so fast
the mindfuck would actually just be off the charts
on the other hand if she killed gen
fudou just does shit okay
i mean like died from it at least
lol
vanessa /really/ doesn't sound like elsa and millaarc just got chopped in half in front of her
also idk if it's the voice acting or not but like
bc the top half of her body fell on the floor
it would be
well yeah
i mean her body is mechanical
i feel like vanessa wouldn't die from getting cut in half though
honestly it could just be symphogear fucking up the animation
people upload the story content to youtube anyway (in japanese of course)
as a fan
since otherwise there isn't that much info on them
it lets them flesh out more things
eh i like the focus on the existing characters
xdu is mostly for fun thugh
i liked the one story i bothered to read
well the madoka mobile game is getting its own anime isn't it
tbh i still don't think anything tops Fine as "all time low"
off a cliff
well more like he literally fell into the nephilim's lap
literally
lol
dr ver was the only one who got things done tbh
uh i'm pretty sure they were popular in G too lol
people like maria and friends
where the one time they actually had progress (feed hibiki's arm to nephilim) it almost got completely cancelled out by hibiki almost murdering it
pretty much the same as the FIS in G lol
relative to power level creep from G to XV they definitely are at least
they're probably weaker than the FIS tbh
maria didn't have many problems going along with "literally sics noise on small children" ver
i mean it's the same as the FIS in G
so it might also be like a "foreigners" thing as well
usually the shinto priests and such are pretty chill
plus i mean if you look at like shinto
especially since it usually gets related to the occult and such
i mean it's a pretty common trope
<:GenjuurouThumbsUp:336657189475188740>
nuns are usually pretty nice
usually only the male priests are assholes
it depends
i can imagine that would fuck her up
i mean they literally murdered her father for saving their village from a plague
it's a nice introduction to that
i do like how GX sets up alchemy for AXZ and XV at least though
she was mostly just doing her thing out of revenge for what happened to her father however many years ago
i mean carol wasn't really trying to convince anyone
but on the other hand it also had the autoscorers
and everyone wasn't just the concert but literally everyone in tokyo
like literally nothing would come close to that unless tsubasa's reaction to NR ruining her concert and killing everyone was "okay well i forgive you here let's hold hands"
and then hibiki forgives her again and she gets redemption in like 1 minute
"okay well fuck you i'm just going to drop the gigantic moon framgent on japan"
symphogears go xd and defeat her and hibiki spares her and raises out her hand
tsubasa sacrifices herself to blow up kadingir, "okay well i'll just beat around hibiki's dead body to blow off steam"
try to blow up the moon, chris sacrifices herself, "lol i can just shoot it again"
actually
i guess it depends on the kind of show as well
the annunaki are all sleeping on the moon or something
i wonder if it's going to be like
the climax is going to be shem-ha turning the moon into a giant construct
and the moon lol
including fine and the curse of balal too i guess
since it's the last season it'd be pretty weak if they didn't tie up all of the loose ends
stll don't know anything about enki or the annunaki or maria
there's a /lot/ of backstory that still needs to get resolved in 4 episodes
there's also just like
and like, miku already told hibiki to beat her up (kind of)
i mean i guess i could see like miku getting freed in ep 12 and then shemha making a construct in ep 13 since that kind of thing happens a lot in symphogear as well
i just feel like the way the narrative is set up freeing miku is going to be like the end goal of the series
it wouldn't surprise me especially considering some of the scenes we've had so far
i mean shemha could make a construct while still being in miku's body
i wouldn't be surprised if miku getting freed was the climax tbh
just like noble red
or maybe blowing up the moon starts an annunaki invasion or something
i guess the final boss is probably just going to be getting miku back from shemha
at this point it seems kind of unlikely that we're going to get final boss fudou
and edgier
madoka and such have been like, darker themed
was thinking more of like how recently shows like uh
sorry i misunderstood what you meant
"dark magical girls" was not as popular back when nanoha and symphogear's first seasons were airing
now i kind of want to rewatch nanoha
hayate and her guardians and the FIS
are pretty similar
and the parallels between fate and chris
well even just like the setup of nanoha/hibiki getting picked up by the whatever magic society/SONG
are kind of like symphogear and g
well at least the first season and a's
thinking about it nanoha does feel kind of similar to symphogear
make fine look like a responsible guardian
fate's mom was like, amazing-tier parenting
lol
and hibiki's name to "echo"
why don't they just translate tsubasa's name to "wing"
who even rates shows before they're over/you're finished watching
shemha's full name is https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shem_HaMephorash
and the coffin is presumably there so PEOPLE DON'T FUCKING RESURRECT HER (suck it, prehistoric civilization, modern era is too smart for you)
keyword confirms that the corpse in ep1 was indeed shem-ha
not that that's too surprising
the keyword confirms that vanessa did make the ssj faust robe
or tsubasa and chris not being dead in ep13 etc
probably the most blatant being hibiki not actually being dead in s1 lol
a _lot_ of copouts
can't believe you treat genjuurou like this
i mean the way they carry him in the preview makes it seem like he's not dead
i mean i don't even know who the person the measuring tape is around is
also it would be pretty funny if yatsuhiro wasn't actually dead
i don't understand what the shaking image in the preview is supposed to be at all
i mean it's a wiki, anyone can touch i
in axz
lol
this is like putting hibiki as "deceased" when she got taken over by the divine power
i mean... maybe he was rushed because of global warming lol
it means they're adding 2 characters to the show <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720> <:ShirabeStare:582381430915596289>
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
melting the polar ice
it's global warming
for shem-ha resurrection
you know who the real culprit is
they're the annunaki presumably
and they needed to use S3CA
or well i guess the time would be "one million nights" or so
that's not awful i guess
i mean they hid it properly for like a couple thousand years
or something
i mean it's possible that shem-ha would have just instantly revived once the moon blew up anyway
since we don't know enough about the "curse" of balal
lol
bad shit might have happened if fine actually did blow up the moon
we don't /know/ that yet
we already know that fine defeated sg and friends in the past
with her kadingir
well fine probably would have just blown up the moon
s1 would still have happened
zz
makes you think
man by episode 10 in axz adam hadn't even finished manifesting the divine power
hm
are you sure it wasn't later
by death do you mean "carol stabs him and shoves him down" or "he actually dies after talking to maria"
still 4 more to go
it's only episode what, 10?
~~not a coincidence that the FIS group is ver plus a bunch of girls~~
the end
"when i get back you better think about how to repopulate the earth"
realtalk i'll accept any ending as long as hibiki and miku end up together at the end
just pretend that like everyone in the shelter died or something
the end
just fine's plan is ruined, hibiki is a lifeless shell, maria and chris are dead
alternate end is 1st season except cut everything involving everyone singing to revive the gears and after
the clear end is 1st season of symphogear minus the scene where the gears come back from the meteoroid
does it just end in like
how would you even consider G an ending
but who knows with fudou
though to me it looks like a "well if i'm going down at least all of you are also fucked" kind of face

he /is/ sort of smiling in the preview
i think no more gears is a given tbh
i think "literally all the gear users except hibiki and miku die" is more plausible imo
the key visual is her holding hands with hibiki watching the stars fall
there's no way miku is going to be dead at the end of the series
basically saying that at this point she's completely gone along with (i guess) the promise she makes in the song with hibiki to always be together
miku's new keyword has a reference to her song with hibiki https://symphogear.fandom.com/wiki/Itsuka_no_Niji,_Hana_no_Omoide#English
which means she's probably not actually going to die yet
so in any case she didn't die instantly
says that the stained glance used on tsubasa became unstable because _millaarc was on the verge of death_
one of the keywords... kind of implies that millaarc isn't dead
madoka did have fakeouts
slap yamakan into the credits
do you think the golem in the preview is noble red? lol
probably a reference to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golem
that her name powers up a golem or something
well it's literally in the keyword
like making the phone appear and pranking kirika and shirabe
and then even when he's in his monster form (usually one of the most boring parts of symphogear, climax aside) he does cool shit
uses alchemy to make gold, incinerating everything in like 3 miles and also burning his clothes off
rips his arm off and beats you with it
he's dr ver
he's not meant to be the villain you sympathize with at all (that's sg)
i like adam just 'cause he does ridiculous shit
but the early part of AXZ just drags on so long
nah i ended up liking the adam parts
i feel like the main reason i didn't like axz much when it was airing was cuz the pacing was so slow
what you didn't see was genjuurou running out there and catching her <:GenjuurouThumbsUp:336657189475188740>
i mean last episode was the same way
that entire scene had some really awkward expressions
same as usual i guess
some parts were clearly bad but others were pretty slick
well maybe not the second episode but at least after ignite for sure
it makes it feel like gx could have just ended in like the second episode if one of the symphogear users had taken one of those teleportation vials
the funniest thing about episode 10 to me is that like
i mean just from a narrative point of view
elsa's head is kind of in the way for that
for a second i thought she was going to be on a bike
tbh when they showed tsubasa's thrusters cutting in after vanessa was holding the vial
she was kind of going berserk
i checked and didn't see any
this is the first amalgam attack card in the anime isn't it
what do you mean
i think this is the first amalgam attack card?
also it's pretty hilarious how their combo attack to hit elsa is like, literally a bear trap
i love how jii's shield thing turns into another jii
looks like pretty cure tbh
better than inserting DEATH everywhere in her lines
amalgam doesn't seem like something they can just turn on at will
i'm just saying
ver's hair is silver
inb4 ver is in the silver arm
~~just copypaste the same story as the last one~~
yeah ~~like how to write the plot of every season~~
i lol'd at the "this is a tenthousandth of a percent of my true power"
she's using it to put more of herself together
yeah
i hope
oh wait nobody does that
the best verbal tic is when the character just screams everything because then you can just put all of their lines in bold and all caps
that's different
but if it's just something the character /does/, i mean
i mean for a gag or something
i mean if the point of the scene is that they are blatantly inserting the verbal tic then just writing it down is okay ig uess
that's righe da ze
translated subtitles are presumably for people who don't know the language, not people who are deaf
you don't need to write it down
honestly you could also just ignore it because you can, you know, HEAR the verbal tic
but i prefer solutions that aren't incredibly stupid and/or painful to read
do whatever
i mean it's just a verbal tic
reminds me of chuu2koi and that people shoving the other chuuni character's lines full of DEATH puns
speaking of +18
it's shemha's version of the kadingir
🤔
and then the symphogears will go to earth from the moon, catch the moon, and throw it back up
actually shemha will probably make the moon fall to the earthj
they'll just ride the moon back to earth
he really does get zero respect
i still lol that they use the scene where yatsuhiro fucking dies as a sponsor screen last episode
gen will be like ACTUALLY YATSUHIRO LEFT US TWO ROCKETS
~~jii raised all the DESS flags~~
basa already raised all the death flags
basa didn't even go to the funeral
they really did yatsuhiro dirty LOL
__gets blown up in less than half an episode__
"guys, this rocket is the symbol of what yatsuhiro left for us"
kirika's is like if you took tsubasa's sword and had all the branches connect to each other
she could probably do pretty much anything
i dunno
i wonder if shemha could turn ver into a complete version of the nephilim
the americans were going to go on it
btw can i just point out that *he gears were never going to be on the rocket anyway*
actually nvm
like the coffin turning things into like negative billion degrees
the annunaki probably have cheat powers
she turned them into silver
so it's basically shirabe
i really like how vanessa's "completed form" includes measuring tape
tbh her design before was cooler when she only had 1 and she switched it around
milaarc looks so silly with the wings on all her limbs
yeah shem-ha is great
i'm sure she'll grow up to be amazing
miku is still young
lol
it's similar because they're both references to yggdrasil from norse myth
and then came back
when they flew off to destroy the moon fragment
well they already did in s1
i mean come on it's last boss miku
nah bikki will definitely resolve things
maria used severed arm as weapon before adam made it cool
and maria has just been swinging that around for the past 3 seasons
i will actually be amused if it ends up that airgetlahm is literally enki's severed arm
or something
but i mean i think one of the points is that if the curse of balal is destroyed they presumably won't be ostracized anymore
yes but at this point they're probably beyond being saved
tbh rn she sounds more interested in airgetlahm than anything
i mean just in terms of like power level
to shemha
tbh rn idk how much of a threat bikki really is
because they're on the fucking moon
if noble red destroys the moon base they're going to die
literally nobody is there
it's the moon
what dirty work
but that doesn't explain why shemha wants /noble red/ there
at least for now
idk isn't she probably watching over yggdrasil
in the firstplace
why did shemha give noble red a portal to the moon
tbh to me the real question is
though the way shemha treats it that doesn't seem likely
or shemha activated it and enki activated something else
well presumably enki activated it because of shemha
were they?
to kill each other
like the curse of balal was the reason why humanity developed the noise
what do you mean
humanity started killing each other after the curse of balal was activated
? what do you mean
it's the same character
it's not a twin of ver
but it's ver
but it doesn't matter because we're talking about the _character_
it was his ghost in maria's mind
just saying
dr. ver ended up saving the world, giving the final recipe for linker, and then unlocking the final part of the recipe for linker
my point is that symphogear doesn't have "irredeemable villains" that are just pure evil
considering he was warning about the annunaki
even adam at this point
so far
not that it is a surprise because so far symphogear has "redeemed" literally every villain in some way
and redeemed
btw NR is definitely going to get forgiven by the gears imo
like yeah you can but that's not the point
that's like saying 'cant you pretend to not be blind by wearing sunglasses so people can't see your eyes'?
that's not the same as /being/ human
um, they have rabbit ears and vampire wings and literal robot body
well maybe not vanessa s much but elsa and i believe millaarc did
they had fucked up lives even before becoming monsters
but on the plus side they aren't literally dying anymore
instead it restored them to being completed monsters
was because they were hoping it would restore them to being human
but ultimately i mean the entire reason they were seeking the divine power
the difference is that before they had hope and now they don't
besides it was impossible for them to return before anyway
if you want to be really pedantic
and sg's body count is higher anyway
this isn't a "i didn't stab hard enough to kill you"
not because they weren't trying hard enough
i want to point out how this is only "attempted" because the symphogears stopped them
or you could put the FIS in place of Ver because they were enabling all his shit anwyay
it's missing the point of symphogear so hard
you mean like how the show narratively absolved fine for trying to murder the entire planet? or ver for trying to murder the entire planet? or carol for trying to murder the entire planet?
redeemable also doesn't mean that the ygot redeemed... it just means that it's possible
if they do it hypothetically
or hating on the show for redeeming characters like hibiki's dad or (more recently) noble red
which is why it's wild to me when people talk about symphogear having so many irredeemable villains
yeah that's the point of symphogear
does fine become better because she talked nicely to bikki for 5 seconds right after taking hikiki's outstretched hand as an invitation to try and literally kill everyone in japan?
who cares
remorse is such a cheap card anyway
i'm saying that symphogear does its best to not make any villains irredeemable
i'm not saying he's not a villain
he's  also angry at the custodians for abandoning him
all the villains have reasonable motives that aren't just "i'm doing this because i'm evil"
maybe "redeemable" is the wrong word to use but like
it's not like he just does it because he's evil
he has a reason for doing what he does and it's understandable
yeah, he did
but nobody in symphogear is just pure evil
anyway i'm not saying that every villain turns out to be a good guy or something
i'm talking from a meta-narrative perspective
at that point just translate it to one millionth of a percent because it's funnier
lol

her DYNAMIC yell against amalgam hibiki was too good
yeah
dynamic
da ze
so she takes it upon herself to do the dirty work
and we already know that millaarc acts that way because she doesn't want the other members of NR to have to do things like that
Elsa is the strategist
well she can't afford to get caught
the same reason why vanessa shuts down the power to the entire hospital and the area around it
millaarc does it because she needs to traumatize tsubasa and she also needs to buy time to escape from the gears
to design the faust robes that you know, SG and friends were using
since they were being held by the bavarian illuminati
does it help that SG and friends were literally the ones making NR's life hell? lol
you don't know that
people only care because millaarc murdered that one girl in front of tsubasa
so is there a magic line between 73k and 70k+ or what
i mean if he knew about it he wouldn't have let the inspection shut them down
so i guess either the americans covered it up/didn't find out or yatsuhiro fucked up
but i mean if gen knew that noble red/fudou had stolen _data on the shenshoujin_ it is actually beyond comprehension that he let miku go unguarded no matter what
yeah
it's in the keywords i believe
when she was also taking the bracelet
vanessa stole it from the los alamos lab
we do know
yes but i mean the data would have been pretty fucking important to know about lol
that fine/ryoko compiled
on the shenshoujin
like information
lol
sorry by materials i mean data
either the americans screwed jp over or yatsuhiro fucked up
this is episode 3....
replace this text with "shenshoujin materials" lol
if i heard vanessa had stolen ALL THE DATA ON THE SHENSHOUJIN that might have been good to know lmao
cuz i dunno
btw i love how they gloss over what vanessa stole from los alamos in the show
which amuses me because if that's the case maria has been using a severed arm for 1.5 seasons before adam finally got around to it
probably yeah
adam was worried about "the annunaki" in general
and making the curse of balal on top of that
strong enough that even another custodian (enki is presumably a custodian?) had to resort to just sealing her in a coffin and burying her under the polar cap
so i wouldn't think of it as "what makes shem-ha powerful" in general (because she's probably just like that because she's a custodian/annunaki) but more like what makes her like an actual god
by the way in that "I" i believe she is referring to shem-ha specifically
maybe it's like how philosophical armaments work
she says "a fraction of a milli" i think
they stole ryoko's data on the ssj as well, just as a reminder
people would definitely be saying mikugear
i'm just saying
lol
if we knew that they had stolen ssj materials in episode 3
also can i just say that from a meta perspective
it's a possibility
all you know is they stole fragments as well as fine's data on it
besides how do they know they're going to make a faust robe out of it
yeah and those "fragments" of the ssj are the same ssj
but it's not nothing
maybe not a direct connection
yeah but it's a connection
that gungnir pendant is maria's
since bikki does use maria's symphogear
also the restriction should be by relic, not by symphogear
on top of that lol
also remember that that relic is the reason why miku and bikki can use the divine power
saying that it's not related to her at all is wrong
because she can use the symphogear version of it
i mean the relic has a tangential relation to miku
but it's the same thing
sorry
from the zesshoushinai with chris and tsubasa
we already know that not every gear user can use every relic
it is
and i just think it's funny how the show glances over it casually in ep 3
they definitely should know everything
come on it's like their top security research lab
lol
my point is that miku unguarded in general is one thing, miku unguarded when you know the enemy has data on the ssj, maybe even stolen fragments of the ssj as well, etc is a completely different one
presumably because the americans didn't tell yatsuhiro or because yatsuhiro missed it
i mean like i said my guess is that gen didn't know about the ssj data being stolen
gen negotiated already to let the gear users keep free movement etc
and "the enemy literally stole the data on the relic that she was a user of and USED to purge the curse of balal"
yes but there is a difference between "she's important in general because of this reason"
(yes it says swan song bc it's commie subs, whatever)

in xv they talk about how the twin blades of zababa deal spiritual damage
i mean she has a chuu2 section on how her zesshou reaps the soul of the victim and shit maybe
i guess
that's the power of igalima or something
what if one soul from kirika's scythe dies every time she says DESS
if only the moon fragment fine broke out was a few kilometers deeper maybe she would have hit the lunar ruins lol
okay then
huh
is that just from shirabe or is that from everyone
is it
lol
that someone will be whoever gets fine's soul
well someone will definitely figure it out someday
she can't actually create new ones
or make upgrades
even eflnein can barely manage to maintain the current ones
we already know that the knowledge on how to make new symphogears is lost
the sakurai theory is different than how to make symphogears
that never even crossed my mind
lol
bikki does kind of use all the gears in axz
in final fantasy land he has a bunch of swords i guess
presumably he used shit in it
he has a whole humoungous book about him
probably
they're on the website after all
or you could try to read them by yourself
they're not, i don't think
maybe
or at least the control room
i think
the frontier is also in space i guess
the funniest twist would be if they aren't actually on the moon
even if you think "superb song" sounds dumb
at least
but i think i would keep the S->S alliteration to make sense with things like S2CA Conversion
definitely not
S2CA is a cool name
i do like how superb song leads to things like S2CA
i just think climax has some uh.... connotations
kamikyoku
where kanade literally just sings it and then fucking dies
i think it's a great way to translate what happens in ep1 of s1
it's a really cool episode 1 of season 1 translation though
sadly
it's a cool term but it blatantly does not fit with how symphogear treats it past like, episode 3
it's easier to focus on ones that sing OP/ED themes that you like
so that might be one route
i mean we do know that maria's song, apple, can gather phonic gain from people at least
i mean if she didn't mean to she could have just killed them and not brought them back to life
probably yeah
actually tbh my favourite part of that scene is how shirabe puts her hand to her mouth so only kiri hears it
dorky shirabe is so good
i thought she just said that because her name has the kanji for moon in it tbh
they're more useful as monsters anyway
i mean what is shemha going to do with regular humans? lol
what was she going to do, say no and then die to lack of blood?
i mean, it's not like vanessa had a choice
i misread it the first time i watched the ep tbh
wouldn't that be ポリフィルム
the sign says ポリフィリム though
which doesn't match either
i was curious so i looked it up but the closest i got to it was porphyrin
the text doesn't say "polyfilm" though
what do you mean by can't
sort of
just in time for xv next ep
have fun
in most other seasons they just kinda shrug and go away after "winning"
i like how gx at least has reasons for the villains to not just crush the symphogears immediately
that's every season of symphogear
ofc i don't mean that's all that happenedi n the first half lol
well i mean they did it in the first half
the gears won in the end though
and they used it in axz
well we know how strong it is cuz they spend the first half of xv complaining it's gone
just like noble red
the goal of the autoscorers wasn't to kill the gears
because they're supposed to record the cursed melody
well they have to
well because that's what their job is
i think GX is actually pretty unique in that everything in GX happens for a reason
lol why
i thought GX was fine in that regard
yeah but symphogears can destroy noise
solomon's cane kind of throws everything out of the window in comparison cuz the only thing that can beat it is symphogear
lol
i mean noble red would probably just die to noise
yeah... G FIS was fine
pre-shemha buff? idk
noble red might actually just straight up be the weakest antagonist so far and shemha is pretty wildly the strongest
noble red is way weaker and shemha is insanely stronger
i dunno isn't xv kind of the worst so far? lol
or at least she doesn't have those stupid wing things attached to every limb of hers
millaarc is looking rather non-monstery in that last shot of the preview
uh
the shemha update is interesting though
most of the keywords are kinda boring (just explaining stuff the show already showed)
gotta check them out
i wonder if keywords are also out then
oh is preview already out
are we going to get a bikki/chris duet this season
it would be pretty funny if she was just stuck in that form for the rest of the show
cute
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
is a stupid moot point
just like how expecting chris to use anything that isn't her revolvers
yeah
well bikki is dumb so it probably wouldn't occur to her until she actually blew a hole in the wall and got sucked out of the vacuum
i miss the machine guns thoughj
i mean here it actually kinda makes sense though bc it'd probably be pretty bad if you blew a hole in the outer wall of the lunar ruins
she used red hot blaze once
or if they do it'll be all at once
at this point i guess it's pretty clear they aren't going to kill off noble red
mini-bat millaarc noises are too cute
~~and fudou~~
i mean, genjuurou and friends are on earth

lol
they all abandoned earth because of shem-ha
i mean they did abandon earth
fudou doesn't get affected by yggdrasil because he's already a monster
since ver died
it's also possible that the arm is you know, dead
since we already left the chateau
but again that part of the story is already passed
that part of nephilim was already completely annihilated
tldr shemha is basically space fine
tfw people talk about ver coming back
probably they're just like "yeah this shit is fucked i'm out of here, enki you do something about this"
which makes me wonder why enki stayed behind
actually it seems like most of the custodians were just like "fuck this i'm not dealing with this shit let's get away from earth"
lol
missed an episode or opened the wrong show or something
tbh when the episode opened i was kinda wondering if i like
she's just so stylish
maybe we'll get a keyword or something
i wonder if fine's tower of babel has anything to do with the yggdrasil towers
~~fine doing things with enki's arm~~
well, it's his arm but turned into a symphogear
want a scene where maria asks the AI if he needs a hand
yeah probably
it's kind of far away
um, fine can't actually go to the moon
so it doesn't necessarily have to be phonic gain
i mean they activated the shem-ha bracelet with alchemy in xv
"do that kind of thing at home!"
the keyword for the human terminal network whatever notes that shemha is proceeding with the yggdrasil system even though balal's curse hasn't been disabled
<:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
also bikki groping chris's chest lol
well i mean they're both red i guess..
the red things look kind of similar to the stuff around the yggdrasil pillar
this pic of shemha in the preview is uh.... kinda suggestive
carol got to yell at symphogears
god waiting for next week is going to be too painful
wonder if she will spend the rest of next episode like that too
i kind of love the implication that carol has spent this entire episode after fighting shemha just lying on the floor
tsubasa was too
and the symphogears crying about it
well there is also the incredibly sad music playing as she fades from existence
i consider redeemed as "the show forgives them for their actions"
andvanishes
listen to the song in your heart or some shit
nah there was that scene where fine is like
nothing will top hibiki sparing fine, holding her hand out to her, then fine taking that as an invitation to drop the fucking moon fragment on them, hibiki still forgiving her after that, and then Fine getting redeemed in like 1 minute from S1 tbh
which is why i think it's funny when people complain about "millaarc" getting redeemed or whatever
lol
my take on it is that the show treats that coupon for a half-off pizza as enough to redeem her for what she did on s1
she's just a plot device
like at that point in s2 fine isn't even a character
i just don't get how in s2 it can be an arc when it's literally just one scene and no buildup
yeah i think fine giving hibiki life advice, connecting with her, and then letting herself fade to dust in the s1 counted for that already tbh
she already "didn't want to reappear" in the first place
and in fact in the second one
fine doesn't actually change between the first and second seasons at all
like
because that's literally just fine showing up for two minutes and talking about how /she had changed from what happened in the first season/
i also don't get how the scene in G qualifies as that then
to me that's basically the same thing
if you think of that as two separate things then that's one thing
okay whether you say the show "forgives them for their actions" or "redeems them"
and again, not every villain gets this treatment immediately
because the mass murderer accepts it and gets forgiven
are you talking about whether you think she's redeemed or whether she's redeemed from the show's perspective
i honestly don't see the difference at all
the show treats it as one
and tells her to believe in the song of her heart
fine reaches out to hibiki's chest
yeah
???
and that's how fine gets redeemed imo
hibiki does connect at the end
it's  not a failure to connect
and doesn't do anything
she's the same character
and besides literally /nothing/ happens with fine between the end of symphogear and when she manifests in G
after they spared her life
past ones including when she literally tried to murder all of them 30 seconds ago
as enough of an action to "make up for her past ones"
yeah my take is that the show treats fine's change of mind in 30 seconds
you don't see all the symphogears standing around crying about the nephilim's death
if the show going this far to show her death as a tragic event
i mean i don't get what you mean by "redeemed"
she got more of a sendoff than yatsuhiro did

i mean i literally just look it up right now
*is in super ridiculous xdrive amalgam fusion form* this is a good time to pull out the revolvers -chris, probably
can't wait for episode 13 where she tries to use her revolvers on shemha
chris trying (and failing) to use her revolvers on mecha vanessa was also pretty high for me tbh

it would finally be kiri's time to shine
it'd be an omake so they'd be like "wait, we need to save this until we actually get back to japan"
while shemha waits for them
and they have to find a way to get to japan
from the moon
i want an omake where the symphogears accidentally land in brazil
or are they just going to leave it there and forget about it 🤔
maybe the true final boss will be shem-ha transforming the moon into a giant robot thing
lol
i wonder what is going to happen with the shem-ha on the moon
yeah
maybe we will get a new hibimiku duet for zesshoushinai
the new forms look amazing
ep 13 looks like it should be cool as fuck at least
i agree with that too tbh
and show them fading off while sending them off to earth
like have noble red stay on the moon with the labyrinth
like at least change the setup a little
for me that kind of lessen the impact of the scene quite a lot
i wish it wasn't like literally the same thing in axz though
chibi milaarc actually doing something is honestly the funniest thing
i know this is the last season... but it would be pretty cool if after the symphogears defeat and seal shem-ha if there was another arc where the rest of the annunaki come back to earth
even the "low quality writing ones" probably ok if  it end up like zesshoushinai format
XD story would probably make for a pretty cool anime too tbh
just like slice of life kind of episode
"shits and giggles" appeared to be pop team epic in a nutshell to me (i haven't seen it)
maybe
but keywords are tomorrow so i guess wait for those
i'm kind of hoping for more information on airgetlam but maybe "it's enki's severed arm" is all we're going to get
or putting the virus on enki on the moon lol
i guess looking at the show so far the most similar thing might be shemha inserting herself into the unified language
i mean we see the gauntlet... i don't recall seeing a scorpion but maybe it was there
scorpions and iraq?
i thought the speculation was that the scorpion was miku because her zodiac sign is scorpio or something
wouldn't be the first time things in symphogear op were just bait....
there's only one episode left and not really much narrative time for them to appear (outside of maybe an epilogue or something) so i wonder if it'll actually be relevant or if it's just bait
we got the kazanari and (sort of) serena content in xv but i wonder if nasstassja and chris's parents are going to be relevant to shirabe/kirika and chris, since they showed up in the OP
the xdu xv13 comic is amazing and needs to be canon
this is especially ironic because isn't the US a pretty religious country irl? loll
it's GUNGNIR, ALCHEMY, and 'MURICA
it would be pretty funny if the US launched another nuke
although this is probably referring to how the US stopped shemha's invasion of the communications network
"continuing the goal of ending the age of the gods, after gungnir and alchemy the united states of america follows as the third 'god killer'"
the alt text for the hands image is "hands being warmed by a far-infrared kotatsu"
that seemed like the implication when they forcefully activated xdrive to be honest
echelon
maybe it's fine praying in front of the tower of babel in a flashback
no, behind the hands
but i mean there's like a lump in the middle that could be something
the hands look kind of like someone praying
what's the dark shit in the middle then
i wonder wtf the red background is
actually rather than the hands
"make a future with the light that god does not know" or something
nice boat ending
i hope so
a few spare ☢
"got aid from technologically advanced nations like sweden, india, and estonia"
plus they have feedback from readers and such
probably because spinoffs by definition come after the original and thus the author and such are more experienced when they create them
||crying for a different reason||
||also the parallels to the bikki/miku fight in G are too good||
||tfw METANOIA is literally a hugging attack||
||i can't believe they brought ver back||
||i knew she would end up using the revolver... lol||
i kinda wish the new symphogears got more screentime to show off tbh
||chris's parents were even in the op...||
||can't believe we got ver but not chris's dead parents||

may as well do it at that point for me
i mean it is literally like 2 seconds away from just saying it outright
it is, but still...
the baiting at the very end is a bit disappointing though
sounds like a very ver thing for him to do
under the theme of "pleasant for you"
maybe we'll get keywords for the last episode
wild speculation for me would be if fine was a priestess of shemha and her tower of babel was a yggdrasil tree or something but i dunno
well it's probably because it happened just after she built her tower of babel thing i guess
should have made those the giant dual swords from mindbreak tsubasa
doesn't even veer around for 2nd attack like the other attacks in xv
like the FIS trio make this super cool GATTAI robot... and all it does is fly once like a projectile
wanted to see more cool symphogear stuff
i wish carol got a bit less screentime this episode tbh lol
that sounds like something kanade would do
she's channeling the spirit of kanade
one of the wildest things this ep lol
tsubas attacking with her hair was like
sad but at least the song is good
lol
miku's shenshoujin song in g was pretty much the gayest thing ever
well yeah
<:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
check bd releases
usually it's with the bds
so a couple months until zesshoushinai probably then
the noble red zesshoushinai is going to be too godlike
do we know when bds for xv are getting released
zesshoushinai come please
v3 iirc
but there was rumor that they might reboot the  franchise with someone else writing it
since the main writer of danganronpa said that he was done after whatever the 3rd game was called (i forgot)
it make me wonder since iirc there's a pretty similar situation with DANGANRONPA and the writer of that
i mean like similar setting and such
would you watch a symphogear reboot that didn't involve kaneko
it might be a reason they chose that name specifically.... but the fact that it is like that is just a coincidence lol
lol
it's not like the latin whatever decided "let's name this METANOIA because it's ai no tame backwards"
it is a coincidence that the word is like that
the timing of everything is just amazing
the way they set it up for the climax in episode 13 is also just godlike
the buildup in the start is amazing and the hype level at the end is way too high
METANOIA is such a good song tbh
all i know about it is that it has something to do with idols and mechas
wouldn't the one that did it first be macross? not that i've ever seen a second of it
i only started watching around when G started airing
when people wonder "why isn't symphogear more popular" tbh it is probably because the animation in s1 was a pretty big trainwreck
and also tsubasa spurting blood like a ketchup fountain
was the really crappy walking animation in S1 tv airing
tbh the first thing i saw from symphogear
who calls the sensei "onii-chan"
yandere aoi yuuki
sadly that game died
yeah
at least we're getting s4 of yama no susume
seems like it does have a manga though
in the end the 3 classmates never really got much of a time to shine
beef stroganoff song lol
i'm still waiting for a second season of inferno cop
fumoffu
can we get a 3rd season of akb0048
nanoha is great and you can get it done in like  7 hours if you just watch movie 1 and movie a's and pretend strikerS doesn't exist
ikr
i only watch the modern-day macross (akb0048)
well it looked kind of like the annunaki defenses on the lunar ruins/coffin more than anything to me
i would die if that happened
lmao
why would you go in here before watching the ep
chris doesn't even get a flashback character (no, fine doesn't count)
can't believe CHRIS'S PARENTS got their screentime stolen by fucking ver
fucking ver
why is the scorpion at the south pole when enki's arm is in iraq
lul
since they were falling apart pretty heavilyuntil the hands of shemha grabbed them
my guess is that the symphogears are gone
because she wrecks her opponent too fast
bc the villains are either super weak (noble red) or super op (shemha)
well those kind of mobage with only jp release that are niche, you can't expect wiki to be relevant at all
besides the point of the scene is that it's gathering all the dead characters and getting them in on the finale, right?
and chris's parents are the entire motivation behind why chris does what she does in s1
tsubasa's dad is a pretty big stretch bc he doesn't do anything technical
don't see what noble red has to do with it
what do you mean by technical relation
ofc they should have shown up
chris's parents have to do with chris
sadly xdu is some rpg thing instead
man, if there was a rhythm mobage for symphogear.... that would be too godlike tbh
love live was the first idol rhythm mobage to get global release too by quite a lot i think
probably because of SIF i think tbh
the foreign popularity of LL is pretty high after all, relatively
at least if they had live viewings worldwide that would be nice
in S1
since they are the entire motivation for chris to fight
and again they have to do with chris
that's like saying dr ver shouldn't be there because his hair is white
yeah but why does that even matter
and again, chris's parents are _in the OP_
and chris's parents dying are why fine is able to kidnap chris from SONG anyway
yeah but that didn't happen "during the actual events of the show"
by that logic serena and etc were already dead when the show started
and fucking dr. ver is there
especially when they are in the OP
so chris's parents not being there is pretty lame
when she was a student
k-on but it follows sawako's school adventures
i wouldn't mind if they made zesshoushinai into an actual show
it definitely has a pretty slow start but it also definitely goes places
jesus what a show
finally caught up on granbelm
genos calls it "not even a particularly strenouous workout regime" lol
because it is
i mean the first season literally has a scene where genos calls saitama's "training regimen" to attain his power a complete joke
opm being hard work 🤔
and there is no way that "his one year of training" is so much harder than everyone else's that it turns him into a literal god
he definitely doesn't work harder than speed o sound sonic or lightspeed flash
for real lol
if you are disappointed by murata's art.... you should quit reading manga
the manga is fucking godlike
how do you get disappointed by the manga
and nobody even come close to that level
meanwhile the ninja village does strenouous training on its students from basically their birth until adulthood to make them killing machines
he become literally the most insane being in the universe
and again saitama doesn't become "pretty strong"
lol
not just him specifically
i'm pretty sure he's talking about "in general"
and again the result isn't "saitama is pretty strong" or "saitama is s-class" even
it's just strength training for 1 year
genos literally calls his workout training out for not even being strenouous
people go through harder training and still don't even come close to his level
you can't get any satisfaction out of fights because you just one-shot everything and nothing can touch you
the gag is like if you play an rpg and cheatengine your stats to max before even doing a single fight
so it's like if a "normal" guy was just suddenly blessed with powers beyond even god mode
like, in terms of physical attributes and such
he is "normal" in that he just acts like a normal guy but he definitely isn't "normal" in that generic mob characters are like him
because he suddenly became insanely powerful
and can't find any challenges
it's literally "one-punch man" because he is too strong
the joke is that saitama is insanely powerful for no reason
look at it this way there is a literal ninja village dedicated to hardcore training killing machines from birth
well, no
and what he did is literal nothing
as training
i mean you look at the shit lightspeed flash and speed o sound sonic did in the webcomic
it's either luck or genetics
it's not that "he trained 5 billion times harder than everyone else"
so the reason the _very specific_ training regime worked is... luck
genos isn't impressed because it's not even a particularly rigorous workout regime to be literally 5 billion times stronger than everything else in the universe
yes but saitama is definitely not on the hard work of that equation lol
so he's either genetics or team luck
OPM is either about the great writing (if you read the webcomic) the god-tier art (if you read the manga) the insanely good animation (if you watch S1) or whining about how shit the second season is (if you watch S2)
most characters aren't like that
but again, saitama is so strong that literally every enemy dies in a punch
there is no way you deserve to be in hard work
if you are as overpowered as saitama is
i will say that
reasonable comparison between the two
or at least there is a like
some people did just that much harder
because some people's hard work is logically consistent
no
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
well they are in the same category
it is not "he is this strong because he just worked that hard"
so it is either genetics (he is special) or luck (his training regimen just happens to be the key to godhood)
i'm just saying there is no logical reason for saitama to be as strong as he is
in fact the reason OPM is a gag is because saitama is incomprehensibly strong for no good reason
honestly if you set saitama aside OPM is a pretty serious show
besides i don't get what calling it a gag has to do with anything tbh
wait which dragonball
are you calling dragonball a gag anime
and still end up much weaker
except he went harder than saitama
darkshine was the same way
well series whatever
it's not just a gag anime tbh
lol
rip onodera
like nisekoi
alternately: any harem series that ends in the winning girl being someone you dislike
like wtf is this shit
if that counts
overlord 3's insanely awful cg in the last episodes ruined the season for me
kobayashi was 2 years ago
same with honda-san
but it didn't like, blow me away or anything
it was consistently good
yeah
like "i've never seen uglier cg in my life"
looked like actual garbage at the end
actually the best thing i watched was probably the first two seasons of overlord
neither of which i would put in my top x shows or whatever
or mitsuboshi colors
i feel like the most entertaining thing i watched last year was like, skeleton bookseller honda-san
what shows
eh
tbf last year kinda sucked in terms of anime
too bad her waist is just like unreasonably thin for no reason
dang those abs
actually kuzu no honkai is kinda straight up hentai bc they actually show the characters having sex
(but those scenes were really good)
like kuzu no honkai (which i didn't actually watch outside of a few scenes)
when you have that kind of thing in drama shows it's suddenly mature and adult and shit
but you see these are only lowbrow because it's comedy
and one of the sister girls (the one with the hairpin)
i liked the teacher's imouto
kiss x sis....
if you talk about shows that are actually full on hentai
lol yeah
aki toyosaki panting noises and such
like in to love-ru darkness where momo and nana are "teasing" each other underneath a bridge or something and it is honestly like actually really erotic
tbh it kinda crosses it at points
i forgot why to love-ru ended though, i think it was bc the author was caught up in trouble (again) or something
sadly
like to love-ru
i feel like a lot of people complain about the ending bc of incest or whatever... while they're literally watching a show called "my imouto can't possibly be this cute"
oreimo to me is funny though because it's like...
it was like those mystery shows where they just off a character one by one
but the way it happened lol
yeah
the author systematically slaughtering everyone
it was just like
and even chitoge's bodyguard girl
and marika
haru got blown up too
it's been a while so i don't remember
i think
the ninja underclassman girl*
even the like offbeat ones like the ninja girl
i would take non-ending over nisekoi systematically breaking the heart of literally every candidate until only chitoge was left
yeah
rip that one person
mostly whenever satou was beating someone up
iirc it had some pretty cool scenes
oh right satou's friend was also a pretty decent person
at least satou was super pretty though
the boy and girl are like the only characters that are not either insane or shitheads (and they are kinda bordering the former)
has there ever been a good yandere anime
definitely recommend watching the first episode
but the first episode was super good
and then it kinda went downhill for me
happy sugar life had a super good first ep
maou-sama retry is the lowest quality show i've watched in a while but it's still kind of charming in its own way somehow
and also aku and luna are good
maou-sama retry was objectively low quality but i liked it anyway just because it's funny
kancolle anime already happened, maybe it'll end up similar to that
boku no hero academia season 4
~~just like how xv ended the series of symphogear pretty well~~
i'd take more but honestly the first season by itself already made its point pretty well i think
tbh i'm ok with the 1 season and movie we got
lol
i guess i should check it out
it sounds really boring but the characters in it look really cute
noukin
how is watashi nouryouku whatever
at least in like date a live or whatever the main character is normal
i mean when the setting is "the main character is a piece of trash but gets 9 girls just cuz", you know...
only watched ep 1 of mairimashita iruma-kun but that show was surprisingly good for me
val x love sounds too trashy even for me but i might look at it
book isekai looked boring to me
to me it strikes a nice balance between the main character being absurdly careful and also him being sort of right sometimes
1st episode was ok but i liked the 2nd ep a lot
so far only watched shinchou yuusha and choyuyu... but those have been fun so far
there's so many shows this season numerically
no but like
why is there so much isekai this season
but man
just enjoy it for what it is
i mean... don't take it seriously
nowadays just use the power of text hooker and dictionary <:KirikaShout:607741871703457812>
i mean, there are more official translations now
too bad sprite  literally died
(which was asuka route)
the one route i played of it
well
i liked aokana a lot
never actually finished any because they're like way too long
i would probably like KEY vns if they weren't so fucking long
yeah
that game is such a masterpiece
but in general for VNs i think my favourite one is symphonic rain
you can always just skip the hscenes
um, probably not
sono hanabira 3 mostly
well
i liked sono hanabira
just play sono hanabira ni kuchizuke wo
y
except not the like angsty kind of yuri
it's yuri
show about girls kissing a lot
sakura trick was good
i mean recently DEEN seemed mostly good to me
can be good
shit looks worse than claymation
i think it's a special accomplishment that i have literally never seen worse cg than overlord season 3's climax
oh boy
overlord season 3
what? opm got a second season? kappa
never watched it but people said shouwa genroku rakugo shinjuu was good iirc
deen has done a few good shows i guess
oh man, noukin is way too cute
condense it into a movie =w=
or both
are you going to watch tv series or movies
but at least that show is somewhat memorable for being super pretentious and also godlike animation by kyoani
musaigan no phantom world was also pretty much all filler
that's all
all i remember is ping pong, jenga, and fumino having a nice scene with the MC
yeah
lol
but like 75% of the show was just like random shit
and the plot and such
i remember actually really liking the actual like serious scenes with mc and fumino
and i think they also had like, jenga and shit
yeah
it's such a random show
i still don't understand what they were doing with that anime
my favourite 12 ep show that just randomly had tons of filler is mayoi neko overrun
which shows are those
or well the alternate world characters anyway
tbh in eien no aselia most of the interesting characters were the spirits anyway i think
my only complaint about eien no aselia  is actually kind of goes to most vns... it feels dumb having to play the same thing like 10 times to see all the content
lol
maybe someday i  will play seinarukana
i enjoyed eien no aselia
tbh i mostly only played either fantasy vns that had english translation or like mainstream stuff
never played it :x
that's their niche or whatever
i think eushully is pretty well known for making insanely long turn based strategy vns
i don't think i ever finished a route tbh... just too long for me lol
yeah she was boring
i had to use item that let you walk on electricity and whack at them with range attack where they couldn't reach me
and it just had stupidly insanely powerful enemies
some like lightning dungeon where you had to get to a gate or something
but one of the dungeons in that route was actually just obnoxiously hard as fuk
i liked the (i think she was red?) loli heroine
even if the balance was super wack at times
it was pretty fun though
and grindy
i enjoy eushully games but holy fuck they're so looong
alchemy meister?
^^
despite the first routes being honestly kind of boring
it was really worth finishing imo
lol
and a /lot/ of things get overturned
i enjoy how it start off with normal route and it seems like generic isekai but then by the end it's actually just pretty batshit insane
lol
that game in general was pretty fun
i think it was called duel savior
i enjoyed the gameplay of uh
and i can almost never finish them anyway
but tbh there's too many vns i want to play and never any time to do them
rip
where mc just walks in on her brutally killing someone
i do remember really liking the first red girl scene though
the fact i don't remember any names should tell you it was a long time ago though
iirc i played through blue, green, red, queen, sister, and other isekai character routes
and lots of 🐙 from what i saw
yeah
and also from that i'm pretty sure i didn't actually lose anything of value by not having h-scenes
lol
from what i saw of the scenes on a certain site i can imagine what it's about though
the version i played was all-ages and cut the conquest(?) ending though
yeah
but iirc like 80+ the red spirit girl actually gets decent tankiness and can do good work
tbh my main problem is that they're so bad defensively and don't really have any payoff...
iirc
i liked the red spirit girl and the queen
actually reds in general kinda sucked
feels bad
actually my other complaint is that the red spirit girl is completely useless until like late endgame
ic
i have no clue if it ever did
last i checked it wasn't tl'd
iirc refrain added a route for her twin that i'm pretty interested in though
well that goes for a lot of vns in general
iirc
lol
at some times it's just too ridiculously dark that it breaks immersion a bit
though it's like
o/
the purple hair sidetail girl who has a twin
i think her name was haruka?
and i also did uh
komari was my favourite character and i really enjoyed her route though
but  that was what i heard from a friend who did
i mean i never actually played through it
i heard kurugaya's route in litbus was terrible though
the anime was ok but i liked the VN more
bc that wasn't translated
lol
but i think i lost interest when refrain came out
they were both pretty good
actually i think i finished 2 routes in that game
never actually got particularly far in it though aside from doing my favourite character's route (which i liked a lot)
the common route was really funny in that game
little busters
baseball practice was pretty fun and the "fights" were just the right level of stupid to be entertaining
also in litbus i actually unironically enjoyed the game mechanics in it
and doing really stupid shit
the anime does a good job of capturing the actual like important stuff in CLANNAD but there's still something special about reading about sunohara being a complete dumbass
playing through the chill common route and enjoying the comedy
but well with KEY vns tbh part of the charm of them is just like
and also to get on kyou's route you basically just have to blatantly pick every decision "wrong" while dating ryou
feels bad
but her only "ending" is just the bad ending to kyou's route
i still feel betrayed by that game though bc my favourite character was ryou
the anime adaptation was quite good
yeah
i only remember that bc i got stuck in it so many fking times
the route where you don't actually enter a route ends in some stupid contest and something to do with rainbow bread
even when i do it's only mostly stupid stuff like in CLANNAD
yeah
never played it but i did watch the anime and hear about it but amane's route is also something
and then play michiru's route or makina's route and it's just like "what the fuck is this"
but the common route was great bc it's like character introduction and comedy and such
well, i didn't play through all the routes though
fruit of grisaia really gave me that feeling
the common route is really good and then the actual character routes are wack
do you ever get the feeling in a lot of like, character route style vns
yeah...
it sounds kind of generic so it doesn't seem easy to find
i'm kidding but the plot sounds pretty much the same
~~saya no uta~~
they're at like what, probably like 6 games of that series now? lol
i should probably actually play grisaia phantom trigger someday
lol
well actually it's not so slow nowadays i guess
though eroge in general is dying a slow death
but nowadays a lot of companies are translating VNs i think
more fan tls ago maybe yeah
you have to set your entire computer to japanese just to try to get it to run
you hope that the translation hasn't been dmca'd
and there's a lot more choice
lol yeah
lol yeah
well the first half of 4th scenario
actually i enjoyed umineko a lot aside from 4th scenario though
sometimes i wish umineko had terrible h-scenes just to round out the experience
rip terrible h-scenes
' -'
you can solve that problem, just quit
definitely recommend bc it's the golden combination of really good and also really short
despite well, everything about it
saya no uta was actually really good
the teacher is some rezero character so hf with that
i mean it's basically mostly the same as the shows it's referencing... the interesting part is how they interact with each other i guess
so that helped
i thought isekai quartet was pretty good but i also pretty much expected it to be what it ended up being
though i got the gist of some of it from isekai quartet
i haven't watched that tbh
plus it had this dude in it
isn't that like one of the first slice of life shows
azumanga daioh is a classic
that show is super old but i liked it
seitokai no ichizon is the one with about a billion references and it's about a guy trying to make a harem in the student council
though that show is good too
no, that's seitokai yakuindomo lol
lol
though talking about anime that are dated
seitokai no ichizon is still good... i think...
even though i thought it was okay
the first half of the first episode is pretty objectively trash, sadly
iirc the reception was pretty bad yeah
personally i thought the episodes after the first were good though
they changed directors after the 5th episode
also the first episode of lucky star is uh.... not for everyone
not that i recommend watching lucky star with english dub
part of the joke being that konata and haruhi have the same voice actor (in both JP and ENG dub, i believe)
definitely should at least watch haruhi before lucky star i think
and i think koizumi's was good as well
the voice actors for kyon and haruhi were great
i watched it dubbed too (at least the first season) but i thought it ended up being pretty good
like haruhi for example
plus sometimes characters are insufferable but they have enough charisma that you can overlook it sometimes
from what i heard that's mostly the plot of rezero though
yeah
not insufferable in general but just like around the mc
maybe i don't mind it as much because i find rista insufferable too
i mean, isn't that the point of the show? lol
the show is pretty cool
shinchou yuusha?
tbh i didn't watch those shows so i probably missed most of them lol
the tiny figurines
and things like painting the nendroids or whatever were cute
tbh i didn't really notice most of it
i guess it's just part of the like, reinforcing that mile really is originally from another world
but in general my favourite scenes were mostly about mile
i mean it was okay in some spots
lol
that show also just spent way too much time on the non-main character crimson vow members who imo are mostly boring
the average girl anime
choyuyu is just kind of dumb in general but literally the last minute introduces something that might make the politician dude an interesting character and then it ends
shinchou yuusha and heikin whatever anime both got super serious near the end despite being comedy before
for me it's my favourite show last season just bc it's the only one that didn't do dumb shit near the end
i dunno
moments before disaster
yeah
i'm still rooting for eiko though
i think she's just antisocial in general i dunno
so i guess we'll see
they haven't even started to do anything with the club yet
ameri's really fun
i'm sure they'll develop it into something interesting
it's barely started with him tbh
the club guy?
which episodes were those
LOL
tbh i felt that a lot this season except those episodes were episodes 11 and 12
which show is it
so she's the only one in the trio that doesn't really do anything
mondaiji especially sucks cuz it ends literally right before kasukabe gets her character arc
<:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
NGNL s2 never happening
i would like to get NGNL in there but lol
night
it just sounds so blatantly fake and acted
idk why but for me most english dubs the female voices are completely intolerable
instead we got stuff like the mai limbo scene LOL
but the anime never really touches on it
i heard that the LN goes down a pretty interesting path
kind of similar to musaigan no phantom world
kyoukai no kanata had amazing animation bc kyoani but the actual show was kinda whatever
still haven't watched the 4 movies for it
man i still need to rewatch tamayura...
unlike isekai cheat magician which just kind of existed
maou-sama retry was definitely really trashy on the technical side of things but it had a weird charm to it
some anime are meant to be deeply analyzed
i mean it depends on the anime
tbh
i feel like a lot of the "these are the shittiest anime of xxxx" are mostly people actively looking for shows they know they will dislike so that they can shit on them
so far it's pretty chill
wonder how gay it will get though
koisuru asteroid was pretty good
and etc
like yama no susume and symphogear
no wonder it happens in all the gay shows
feels like it happens a lot
someone should make a collage of young anime girls staring at the starry sky
it's just so dumb lol
i only watch 1 ep cuz one of the girls (the mc's love interest) is pretty much a kosaki expy but like
is kind of terrible
muranase seton gakuen
also man
the anime was really good too though tbh
(in terms of relationship advancing)
too many scenes where chiho does nothing except be jealous of emi
so i guess the author try to salvage maou/chiho but it's just so hamfisted
idk
and that goes on for like 12+ volumes
meanwhile since events in vol 3 emi is forced to hang out with maou
lol
all i remember with chiho and maou is either plot stuff or work
aside from like the start of the series
i don't even remember if they _ever_ go out on any date
but yeah to me the chiho maou relationship is just like
?????
he's just like
and i tilt on the later chapters but some of them still have really well thought out scenes so it's not like the author is bad
aside from a few parts
yes it's really good
so the relationship to me is just like
kills pretty much any possibility of chiho and maou actually getting any kind of development
isn't that way too early lol
just personally thinking but vol3 introducing alas ramus is just like
though tbh the plot really isn't fair to her lol
feels bad
chiho as a character seem dead to me
and then end of vol 20 is just like yeah i don't care anymore
the end of vol 16 tilt me so fucking much
and some summaries on 16+
i read through 1-14 so far
though i heard it's mostly just backstory
not yet
but i still appreciated chiho until she starts doing shit in ente isla
i mean i still liked emi more than her tbh just because the relationship makes more sense to me
yeah
like why
i liked chiho until she go from being earth schoolgirl to isekai god
the basis behind the LN is so good and I really like the early volumes where it's pretty much completely Earth-centric
still has some parts I really like but i really don't know wtf the author is doing unless he's just super pandering to chiho fans or something
the series is great but man the LN really trainwrecks later on... feels kind of bad
i marathoned hataraku maou-sama and read most of the LNs
so i guess it'll be a fun romp
seems like her companions are going to be pretty op as well though
the one where the girl puts all her points in defense
the show's too cute
where you just put all your hp in health so you can tank tons of low level enemies at once and spam the aoe attack to farm them
reminds me of playing FLYFF vit assist character
shield girl lol
which
ID INVADED was pretty cool though
feels bad
makes me feel like i am watching knockoff nisekoi except mc is actually ridiculously boring, kosaki is like 10% as charming and chitoge is literally an animal
you could just read that
the manga is good
and it's pretty much about as ear-catchy as the YMCA song was too
i tried to think of a less appropriate anime to hijack the YMCA song and came up blank
the ishuzoku reviewers OP is actually hilarious
instead of watching a movie you could marathon the entirety of teekyuu
i guess if it airs in theaters it's a movie
as someone who pretty much stopped watching the series after A's
the nanoha movies were good
yeah
you could marathon hellsing ultimate
you could probably just watch that
technically it's attached to the show but there's the dragonball super broly movie
like your name
weren't there a bunch of mainstream anime movies fairly recently
lmao
this show teaches me things about animals that i really don't want to know
guess i should give it three episodes
does it get better after the 1st ep
they're too cute
these eu previews are going to kill me though
i like haruna so i can probably get through this pretty easily
fun show though
how does someone even come up with the idea for this to exist
marathoned first season of kore wa zombie desu ka <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
yeah
so many animal themed shows this season
(isekai quartet)
wonder if that means that the side characters will get more screentime
kind of interesting that the shield hero characters are in class 1
who doesn't love oxygen system in swimming
game mechanics i guess
it seems likely
if kaede tried to swim, would she just sink like a rock? lol
i wonder
maybe
since kaede probably has like barely any mp I guess she has to rely on the shield to cast things like the hydra skill
i think that represents the mp it's storing? maybe
cuz they're scrubs
yes i'm mostly just saying that cuz he's blonde
so he's probably an all rounder
nah he seems like some kind of paladin type character
kind of curious about the payne or whatever dude who placed first
though in the event she ended up placing third
that would be pretty funny
lol
though considering what her shield does that's basically what she's doing
lol
imagine if maple started eating other players
hype for the next episode
bofuri sure is fun
that time i got reincarnated as pacman
wish they would hurry up and finish it cuz idk how much else they will be able to cover at this pace
ngl the battler arc in iruma-kun is /really/ dragging on
i enjoyed the megumi scenes
it's trash but it's fun trash
serial killer verified TM by youtube
ID INVADED is great
on the less dark side of magical girl things, heartcatch precure is a masterpiece
where you get to see her actually doing shit
definitely recommend reading the other LNs in the series
other than mc being akari or something
that anime was okay i guess but i don't remember anything from it
yeah
that's the entire point of MGRP lol
some tarot thing
there was some other anime i forgot
or i mean, the reasons why it happens are pretty blatant (but this is getting spoilery)
well i mean it doesn't really happen off screen
yeah
well that's where the LNs shine tbh
I watched the first season and though it was pretty good but never got around to watching anything else in the series
SELECTOR INFECTED WIXOSS is... a thing as well
and at least for the first few for the most part characters for previous series play mostly a minor role
they are mostly different casts
honestly the other LNs are... different
i mean it had some QUALITY issues with TV version or so i heard but i think the bd versions are okay
i thought the anime was okay and enjoyed the LNs a lot
magical girl raising project is fun too
yuuki yuuna is excellent
~~probably because maria stole tsubasa away from chris~~
i guess it's true that after G chris's interactions are pretty much all with jii and kiri
i wonder what nanoha would be like if they didn't massively jump the shark with StrikerS
symphogear and nanoha 1 even have similar gratuitious torture scenes by the supposed mother figure
i've always thought of them as pretty similar
and A's has the opposite team (grimoire knights or w/e) like how G has the FIS trio
nanoha 1 has nanofate like how symphogear has hibiki/chris
i mean
they're pretty similar
yeah actually i'm good
i saw a clip of one girl getting the shit punched out of her and was like
lol i never bothered with vivid strike
as in it takes place before strikers
i hope it's like detonation and reflection
still, i wonder what the next nanoha project will be like
:kyubeyface:
if you are a kyubey you can
magical girl raising project
i'm just saying that the fact that she's the "winner" despite doing nothing is the contrast to what she becomes later
that's why i recommend checking out the other LNs
that the rest of the LN volumes give
so you don't get the payoff from the first part
lol
i mean the anime covered one volume of an LN series
if there's a protagonist in the show, i think i would actually say it's swim swim
the show is not really /about/ her if you get my drift
i mean
the only thing that is off screened is her moping around by herself
i mean she basically does
someday
i have to watch it too
still need to watch that show about the two dorks dating each other
it's pretty blatant yuri teasing (and pretty obviously not going to go any further than that) but the characters are fun
koisuru asteroid is nice
since they get like super old but still look young so humans don't care
one of the funniest gags in the anime is that the human character is super into elves while every other species seems pretty turned off by them
i mean before it was mostly just ecchi now it's actually just hentai
it's only the 3rd ep and it's literally just straight up h
ishuzoku reviewers isn't even pretending now
project sekai looks hype
bandori mostly feels good
not a fan of the llsif setup and starlight stage flicks are really stupid
i like bandori the most out of the rhythm game so far
the rising burn out mv was too good
so hard
raise a suilen saving bandori s3
really hope they add raise a suilen to it when s3 ends
rip
there was also that miku game coming out
pretty hyped for d4dj
llsif -> starlight stage -> bandori gbp -> d4dj (maybe?)
mobage are too op
build fighters or whatever
i remember when the gunpla anime was pretty huge
don't even get into ll vs sunshine
akb0048 is objectively the best
lol
like the dragonar whatever academy anime
the best is terrible shows that have amazing OPs
though most anime i watch i mostly skip ops and eds after the first gothrough
no idea what it is but it sounds cool
yea
feels bad man
first 5 episodes are already out then have to wait a month for tv broadcast to catch up
though the airing for bandori is so wack lol
did k-on get a movie i forget
both seasons?
wew
mostly the nana mizuki ones
aren't some of the nanoha themes pretty popular though
i heard ||someone showed up with their neck intact|| though
maybe the third episode is better? since it's madoka
it's really fun though
bofuri's so silly
2 of which were pretty much just complete filler
iruma-kun 18 was great! it's too bad it took like 6 episode arc to get here though
or more like isnt' that just a sentai show
aren't they pretty similar
though the cyclone joker thing is pretty amusing
nyaruko mostly plays it for gags
ep 5 was really fun
or maybe it's better to say that they're a lot more eccentric
but i mean comparing it to like, hinako note, the characters there have a lot more individuality lol
it feels pretty similar to yuru camp i guess
not that it's a bad thing
the characters just feel really normal lol
i guess that's cgdct for you
there's really nothing special about koiasu but it still feels really fun to watch somehow
every episode of ishuzoku reviewers: can the next episode possibly get lewder than this
next episode: it turns out it can
i enjoyed it more than madoka too
gx is pretty cool
the first series of yugioh where it's barely actually a card game
it's been like 20 years and i still have zero idea how the digimon trading card game works
the melancholy of haruhi suzumiya aired almost 14 years ago <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
even gets that red moon in the background and shit
also man, sally letting loose in the vrmmo is pretty amazing
though i'm pretty sure that show spoil some pretty massive plot point anyway
the only thing  i know about rezero is from isekai quartet =x
like vanish/doom in ffvi
unless it's some like stupid cheese strat
yeah
but like every rpg it's like lol every boss is immune
though i don't play that many games
the only game i play in recent memory where status effect are actually a thing is labyrinth of touhou
yeah
next event: maple actually just destroys the world with her poison abilities
like come on in pretty much every single rpg status effects are trash
ikr
how hard is it to make bosses immune to poison lmao
bofuri is fun but man the devs in it are so stupid
but it's also just a really well made show
i mean yeah it's wildly ridiculous and super explicit and it's fucking hilarious funi dropped it after 3 episodes (and were making a dub in the first place)
tbf ishuzoku reviewers is amazing
it's a cool fighting game
you should start with fate unlimited code
because it's cool and good
i guess most people just watch fate/zero though
the only fate thing i might have any interest in is kaleid/liner
who needs fate stay night? just play fgo as your first fate game <:Ver:336656981144109066>
why buy fancy expensive console that you have to lug around when you can just play shit on your phone
but rather smartphone gaming
but tbh isn't the biggest reason it died not really nintendo
💰
i think
i heard the biggest problem with the vita was memory sticks being ludicrously expensive
probably did
iruma-kun can finally do other shit now
ding dong the kiriwo arc is dead
though it's hard to say whether that's better or worse than when it release on time but is clearly a trainwreck
sad
iirc girls and panzer had like a year long break before airing the last 2 episodes or something
sometimes they have like slight bonuses or whatever
ygo vrains had a recap every like 10 episodes or so for the same reason
yeah usually that's why
after dropping that bomb at the end of the episode too
rip koiasu, next week recap episode
i mean they are wearing things that are not pantsu even if they look like it
no
strike witches is fun if you can get around the whole always wearing not-pantsu thing
there's like what, 7 more episodes of this? jesus
and it's only episode 5
lol
i wonder if on the censored version the second half is literally all just black screen
without like mosaicing the entire screen
in fact considering japan's censorship laws i don't even know how this can air at all
impossible to get any screencap bc every part of it is just super explicit lol
the second half of this week's ishuzoku is actually just too much
i'm kidding but did they really have to make the disguise like that? lol
because ishzuoku hasn't gotten cancelled enough now they have the KKK in their anime
i really like a lot of the characters but i also hope that we get more ao and mira development in the second half
it's really interesting
started reading kamisama no memochou LN
ID INVADED is still pretty fun to watch even if this week's episode focus more on the overarching plot and less on the mystery this time
i've only been putting it off for like 10 years or so
actually i should probably watch gurren lagaan sometime
so i guess it's alright
but on the other hand that arc introduces sovereignity who is a walking pilllar of moe voiced by iguchi yuka
the 2nd arc in c3 is really out of place considering the rest of the show
but i don't really like mecha that much
maybe i should check out it later too
i never watched it
the OVA was fun to watch at least though
the slice of life parts are pretty terrible but the action and wacky gory edgy dark shit is kind of fun to watch
what a weird show
marathoned cube x cursed x curious
right <:CarolYandere:424047704826707980>
one of the things i enjoy most in yuyuyu over madoka is that in yuyuyu the characters actually have lives outside of the plot
this is way too cute
oh my god kaede
that's the downside of mixed media project
i thought the hero system was created to defend against the vertex
don't they change the hero system after?
iirc things do change after yuyuyu
the iruma-kun hype train is back on
but i guess granbelm felt kind of similar and was pretty dope
it depends on what you mean by "like yuyuyu"
yuyuyu isn't about the shinju vs the vertex, it's about yuuki yuuna and the hero club
i mean it's not "miraculously recover", it's just the shinju giving them their body functions back
it's too bad there's only a handful of episodes left
and next episode is (finally) the devi-idol character that i've been interested in since the first episode o/
the second half of this episode was too amazing
reaching heights i didn't even know were possible
this week's ishuzoku reviewers is so off the charts even the at-x version is censored
going to make the suffering of getting through the previous one worth it by a lot
this last arc of iruma is going to be amazing...
when it's literally like almost 5 times longer than every other arc in the show lol
the ending was really good so it wasn't a complete waste, but yeah....
if you took that out and treated the last episode like an ova or something it's pretty much a normal season
tfw realizing the kiriwo battler arc in iruma-kun was literally like 9 episodes
weird number
yeah first season only 23 episodes for some reason
the last episode also just ended on a massive teaser
i just hope the quality doesn't drop too much
so they have time i guess lol
i mean the next season is a year away
iruma-kun already has a second season announced? feels good
iruma-kun will hit yodh soon enough i'm sure <:CarolYandere:424047704826707980>
<:CarolYandere:424047704826707980>
i literally died lol
the scene with iruma, ameri, and ameri's dad
ikr
and 9 episodes of kiriwo
it's so criminal to have kuromu's arc literally at the very end
unless you start reading the manga orz
yeah it's so strong.... but you have to wait a year.... <:CarolTheFuck:617036187319795722>
that's exactly what i gave it on MAL lol
and of course the final battle scene was pretty cool where he gets to go all out
yeah
lol yeah
for an LN fantasy type anime
it's just okay
i wouldn't call it terrible or amazing
the tv version was pretty tame once you got past how skeevy it was sometimes
i never watched the bd versions so idk how far it goes
yeah....
there's a lot of uh..... fanservice scenes that are fanservicey but also kind of uncomfortable
like when he magical punches that dude out
glenn also just gets a lot of fun scenes
yeah
it's more about the execution than the overarching plot
i mean it's not a deep show or original or anything
mc was funny too
i mostly just remember it for the ridiculous outfits and for the blonde girl being super cute
it was okay
jashin-chan dropkick s2 though
me trying to rate ishuzoku reviewers
to love ru is a weird series because the first 2 seasons are honestly very mediocre and it doesn't get particularly interesting until darkness
first 5 episodes drop with cd releases... then nothing for 2 months... then 6 episodes over 3 weeks... and then have to wait another like 4 weeks for the finale
bandori s3 has the most wack release schedule i've ever seen
but a lot of the "interesting" shows are mostly sequels to things i haven't watched lol
i'll look at kakushigoto and priconne redive, and i'm mildly hyped for jashin dropkick s2 i guess
compared to last season there's a lot fewer shows i'm interested in tbh
the next season is starting pretty soon
well, there aren't really that many shows i regret watching tbh
but the problem is that the main characters were just way too stupid for me to bear
i still want to watch tantei opera milky holmes someday
sadly
onodera is just too perfect with raku that it was obvious it couldn't happen
but reading through the manga afterward got me burned
actually if it was just the anime it would be okay
don't bother watching harem anime if you can't stand the main heroine
nisekoi is the series that taught me
#teamonodera
and it was /really/ obvious that the manga was going to end
where the author basically just started sinking ships left and right
i'm more annoyed at nisekoi's ending
but oh well
i mean that's pretty much the one thing everyone was hoping for
just pretend it doesn't exist
well, it can't be helpd
also i heard the manga ending for tlr darkness was trash
though the anime never reached my favourite part of the manga
tlr darkness still has that but it has like actual development and such as well too
it's mostly just lighthearted comedy hijinks stuff
yeah
and the supporting cast in darkness is great too
she's really just way more fun as a protagonist than lala tbh
darkness is pretty much all about momo and yami
but darkness is honestly really great
i'm pretty sure that that's the reason why haruna (and lala, by extension) basically just become side characters in darkness lol
and it pretty much completely sunk to love ru for a while
the most interesting part of to love ru before darkness is how haruna was based on the mangaka's wife, and when they divorced she sued him because of that
nice o/
same
youjo senki
so many good sequels coming up
owo
realized i didn't actually know what monroe's name was and was just thinking of her as monroe
rewatched episode 2 of koisuru asteroid
nice
i haven't watched it yet but i admire kakushigoto for being a show about a ridiculously terrible pun
kyoutarou is still a guy though? lol
maybe when the finals are closer to ending it'll happen
ah well
didn't they announce another season of saki? and then it never really happened
shinohayu anime would be pretty great
does ritz not have enough projects
lol
wat
and yet the main series is still super hype
the pace of saki manga is so glacial
apparently they just aired like the entirety of jashin dropkick s2 already? i mean, okay i guess
also yuzu and friends deserved better
arc v was great at first but got kind of bogged down later on
bang dream is great
too bad covid is going to delay the show after the 3rd episode
insanely rich cop balance unlimited is pretty amusing
i should watch IS someday
did you at least watch clannad after story after
i hope d4dj anime comes out soon
that was a fun anime
and i guess the other one aired all of its episodes the first week of the season
to be fair the one non-cygames show i was watching this season got cancelled due to coronavirus...
alright
well, it seems like he's getting better as the show progresses at least...?
it's really cute but at the same time i wish he was slightly less retarded
all i remember is it having like 3 episodes of plot and 9 episodes of random wacky hijinks
tbf the mayoi neko overrun anime was uh, a thing
maybe i'm mixing it up with something else
no ik about that but i thought another project was announced
wasn't ngnl s2 announced a while back?
the light novel series was finished later as well though i think
ic
probably other things i'm forgetting too
you had like toradora, louise, shakugana no shana
that was like the period where kugirie tsundere was god tier
(the reason it got 5 seasons is kugirie tsundere)
and in that case the anime actually overtook the light novels i think and had its own ending
lol yeah
i mean, sometimes things just end abruptly too if they fail i guess
and no game no life although that is apparently getting a second season sometime after forever
still bitter about ryuugajou nanana no maizoukin/nanana's buried treasure
and if a show ends in a massive cliffhanger then it means "fuck you, read the light novels if you want to see it continue"
that was like the only part of the show i liked i think tbh
super cute
maybe longer tbh i don't remember exactly
i remember it having a like 6 month delay in the middle of its airing or something
KEY vn anime
i mean that's just a thing in every precure episode
idk i liked yes precure five a lot
from the series i've watched
if it was for like, someone interested in watching precure in the first place, i think i'd recommend yes precure 5
yeah (i haven't watched gopri yet)
like the mother's day episode
even just on an episodic basis i think it stands out just because there are memorable themes to the episodes rather than just feeling like monster of the week every time
and it has great characterization and plot
the animation is top notch and i also think that it's the strongest thematically as well
it's like, the kind of show i would recommend to someone who would like, probably not be interested in watching generic precure series in the first place
it's my favourite out of the ones i've watched and i think it's the highest quality as well but it's definitely not representative of the series as a whole
heartcatch is super good but i can see not recommending it just because it's a lot different than most of the other precure series
kind of like fine in symphogear
lol
||just skimming through and kawarino basically has most of the end arc and the flashy finish while desperiah just jobs in like half an episode||
||i guess he's technically not the last boss but he definitely feels more like the last boss than the actual one||
ah no wait that thing is kawarino
i thought kawarino did something but i guess i misremembered
i was thinking of kawarino
actually maybe it didn't
i think it did at least
at least yes precure 5 ||had the decency to make its final villain the flamboyant evil guy who stands out every episode||
also sucks because joker is just much better in general
i honestly don't remember anything about the end of smile precure
like bumbee in yes precure 5 gogo
but i enjoy villains more when they're not just like the blatant stereotype that they're cast as
and i enjoyed the like, scenes with the villains at their hideout where they're just being dopes
the witch was okay i think
i watched star twinkle but never finished it yet
i haven't watched most modern precure past like, happinesscharge so i dunno
like in smile precure where joker is cool as fuck but the actual big bad is just yawnworthy
well, that tends to be a main theme in precure in general tbh i think lol
mysterious unexplained octopus on his shoulder
and i mean, his fight scenes were pretty badass so he had that going for him
that was like the one weakness that stood out to me of the original series but it didn't matter much to me since all the other villains were _so_ good
lol
well i mean he's still a standout compared to the big bad in the actual show who literally just drops down in the last like 5 episodes out of nowhere and has no real character aside from being strong as fuck
she's definitely matured in the movie but i don't think it conflicts with how her character was before
i mean it's not like erika at the start of heartcatch is the same character as erika at the end of it
the main villain is okay but the focus of the show is obviously loup-garou
for that episode in particular
it's easy to say things like "oh they should have just talked it out and it would have been resolved" but i can empathize with not wanting to prod the hornet's nest because you're worried about what might happen
tbh the only precure i've watched so far that i thought was actively bad was happinesscharge precure, and even that had things i liked in it
i mean it's anime, if characters just talked things out there would never be any conflict =w=
obviously it's old so the animation and art is not great, but the characters were decent enough and it had pretty good villains
i think yes precure 5 was pretty good for what it was
also maybe i'm bias but i thought that the heartcatch precure movie was awesome
at least it forces them to put a standalone plot in each episode instead of just putting random shit on things like in other precures
for better or for worse the jankiness kind of stopped after x365 and it became a lot more polished in later seasons though
like yuno's fever dream
the first season of hidamari sketch also had some pretty wacky moments
they mostly have different motifs and themes so if there's something that interests you you can just start with that
tbh you can just scroll down the series and watch whatever catches your eye
should have seen the trainwreck coming when in like the second episode blue is like "yeah precures can't have boyfriends that's a rule somehow"
tbh one of the reason i dislike happinesscharge precure a lot is how they handle the het romances in it
precure never disappoints with its super attacks
really getting to see just how much kinji fucking hates his hysteria mode personality is something
I enjoyed HnA although the LNs were better
i'm pretty sure most people just like fate zero for the cool action scenes
i am not an expert but it's my impression that for japan fictional depictions of gay and actual humans being gay are treated differently
the bakemonogatari series probably is similar to that kind of thing
but yeah its main problem was not really the art/animation...
idk if they fixed them in the bds though
happinesscharge precure had some really terribly animated episodes
the original umineko art is irreplacable for me
