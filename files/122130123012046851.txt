I can't get past a certain point cause I just sort of got bored
but ghost
but people hype it up way too much
its a good season
also on the gaim and ghost thing. I think gaim is a bit over hyped
rip
damn that sucks
really?
at least as much as I've heard
which is a fair assessment considering it wasn't made to be one in the first place
eh it just doesn't feel like as kamen rider
only had a cursory look after Decade
never really got too far into it
ah yes the odd season out
and people be fans of both
Also evolite exists
Think it get passed over for spritzee
I don't think it gets used down there
