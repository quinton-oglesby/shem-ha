I bet he was furious when he finally lost track of me...although he may be the reason I lost my first Facebook account who knows. I remember at the time Zuckerberg wasn't too happy about role-playing on his platform so a lot of good people I knew on there were getting banned for "impersonation"
Thanks for the support guys
Yea I'm much better now this was years ago back when I was 14 or 15
Yea
Thanks Squarcles
So basically he cheats on me twice and I tell him to we're through for good. This just doesn't sit right for him so he he threatened to rape me before I blocked him, sends his friend to persuade me to date him again, and any other relationship I tried to have after he would spread misinformation like "I belonged to him" and when I had enough and switched media platforms to get away from him he followed me there too. Eventually he gave up I think I have no real way of knowing

I heard what possibly could've been a gunshot and definitely police sirens while out walking my dog
No you're not
Just be more careful in the future alright
