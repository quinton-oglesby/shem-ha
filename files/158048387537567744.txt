Absolute garbage
The one they are forcing everyone to use x_x
Yeah
That's the one I joined. Have you looked at the link for the new subreddit layout??
New subreddit layout with the discord invite on top. That leads to a dead invite
Still the main subreddit one should still be usable XD
I joined through the one off the old subreddit and that seems to still work
Ahhh. I understand.
And hello Serna!!
uPGcwbV invite is dead.
If any of the reddit mods are here, just want to say the discord redirect is broken on new reddit layout
Same same. Finally took the effort to join after lurking for a while.
Hello friends!!
No worries. Just thought I'd give you guys a heads up. I found my way here one way or another
Yeah. I see complaints everywhere about that
