it works better like that
idk about the concert itself but the fight is def intentional
the plan was to keep them hostage anyway
i mean it still went wrong?
lmao
the most tame one was gx cause they attacked backstage
how
a concert in this series?
like no1 thought it would go wrong?
even the girls were not in standby or anything they just wanted to go watch
why was this hall so unguarded lol
lmao
yea how did this go from tsubamaria moments to tragedy so fast
need that
i hope they lewd maria as much
lmao
gets better at poledancing
she basically
if u check all her transformations
lul
but she's always like that
lmao
not this intentionally at least
i dont think anyone will be as lewd as kirika
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
yes but not like this
im convinced this is a tsubasa cour now
this ep topped the og ep1 wew
maria>chris>kirika
like at this point isnt it like
lul
this is solid proof
every cour she is bustier
is she
probably
tsubasa transformation is gonna take a while
this means
tho
only at ep2 bois
suffering in progress

no1 will mind
can the hot succubus go kill grandpa as well
loli skewer in your face
then boom
lmao
i dont think anyone got away in this
bruhhh
psure first live wasnt 100k dead
this was way bigger tragedy than ep1 wasnt it
but they went all in
oh yea i could see the ptsd coming from a mile
hope they keep making them fight alchemists instead of noise in this
thats why g was so good as well
or unison moves
cause its either fighting big shit
tsubasa never rly gets chances to show off sword skills
well the fight was top notch
since sword combat was this good
since tsubasa vs maria
its been like what
at least the animation was top notch
oh well
oh boi
https://twitter.com/cawcher/status/1150112505106059265
lmao
that was nice too
oh and hit a tank with a tank
rest was ok
apart from tsubasa finally using that sword as intended
eh
but thats just maria bias probly
i liked axz ep2 better as well
rly?
do it with maria this time
ill take another riding duel like fuugetsu
aint nobody need that
fk arcv references
not arcv
no go back to 5ds
tho i hope 5ds references are still there
now we beyblade
axz was 5ds
fav opening tbh
rly doubtful
isnt it just a speceship container or some shit
ehhhh
wont be seeing tsubasa sequence for a while
damn i wonder how long will major ptsd last now
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
no this time she should have
lmao
i thought it was meant to be XV at first
yea
so
also probly chris fight coming?
nah it wont have concert
that back is always detailed

gotta give them props for how detailed she is in concert too
maria in anything*
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
quite a jump for the same ep


but yea made a lot of sense
well tbh i think tsubasa had perfect marks
isnt she the smartest of the bunch anyway
those tsubasa frames are some of the best combat in the series
idk who would think fight scene wasnt good tbh
loli face didnt help
this was way darker than ep1
granted this didnt cost us a kanade
im waiting
they cant possibly not lewd maria
like damn
with the hands
i think the lewdest part is the zettai ryouki frame
its not even the poledance
the shot at the end
like
or wut
was it completely naked
lmaooooo
imagine having the most op human as a son and calling him a failure
shitter blames everyone for everything anyway
u know its coming
lol
maybe shirabe before chris
if they going by cds
lol
she just jojos harder
she has 2 of  them
eh not rly
lmao
and not gonan actually use the scorpion for something
i hope its a metaphor/hint for the ep1 stuff they mentioned
i hope so
i mean for all they knew they actaully went for the kill
axz was fine
so i think she will just be busy getting tsubasa back and wont get hit as well
maria shots felt like she has come in terms with everything in the past
but maria is more on the happy side
tsubasa is screaming that its coming
in the op shots and stuff
not sure yet
maybe maria
pretty sure just her
also i dont think anyone else will get this hit
i dont think thats half
wdym first
believe in maria
thats a way to kill the series
killing tsubasa for finale
lol
how is that dope
i dont think next time we see miku gear will be possesion
tsubasa is fucked for minimum 4 episodes
with all the gears
pretty sure its a step over silver mode
the logo animation
i mean
lmao
and i really hope they dont do something with the specific random scorpion they found
same
is give her 2 arms
closest thing they can do to a stand
testament x2 coming
4 hands this time
i mean
dont mind
everyone apart from maria sent you to jail already on previous cours
not gonna see her for a while
now it finally makes sense tsubasa is fkin cd6
gonna carry this drama once again
when maria 'died'
last time nana scream hurt so much was
might be just shared vision
believe in maria
nah maria wont let her fall that hard
do it
as long as it kills grandpa
it can be 1 cour
need more ptsd
https://twitter.com/AlphaMike321/status/1150299683530706945
hmm
wont change much probly
shirabe was always 🚓
lmao
now that they go full into detail its just lewd for the whole length
u woul have to go frame by frame
previous ones the lewd frames were fast
i think its more like
naturally
yea
well
apart from g i think
poledancing was always there tho
i hooked people by showing them later cour fights as well
i get that
ok
like right off?
did they watch ep1 of xv?
very irrelevant point lul
pretty much
lol if a new person has lewd problems he will turn away immediately on s1
complains are just always louder
people are loving it
this is a huge success in their books lmao
what problems
<:TsubasaSmug:585839805737467920>
wonder if people gonna complain about chris being *suddenly* lewd as well
https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/000/734/222/a18.gif
lol really
i mean the other 3 arent getting og callbacks obviously
<:TsubasaSmug:585839805737467920>
ok not that kind
so i expect mariass then
lmao
i hope the one who does maria is as lewd as this guy
yea
id be kinda sad if only hibiki has the dynamic camera
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
kirika being kirika is just fanservice
bdsm and fine naked is her being strong
it was 2012
why would u see anyone talk about it?
huh?
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
oh yea that bdsm play was very away from the camera
transformation is like a minute
she was on screen for whole minutes
yea no shit
not focusing every sec
''background''
lmao
thats just bs
i always wondered why they made miyuki sound so bad actually
lmao
literally bdsm play and fine being naked 24/7 is fine i guess
sry this series is fanservice in all aspects
s1 is like the lewdest pmuch?
if u have lewd issues
but really even if u go in like that
is dog a doll too i wonder
ver is a hero
hey ver isnt nearly as bad as that guy <:Ver:336656981144109066>
altho if they doing maria flashbacks he will be there regardless
so he is eternal
u can use ver quotes for the people who will be complaining about lewds weekly
so 1 more reason to not give a shit about these 3
also vanessa is a doll too isnt she
for all they knew anyway
in axz they all just went for the kills
i mean hopefully
that will be sooooo bad
cause boi
dont make hibiki say some shit about understanding carmilla
pls
also
gonna be the most important aspect for it
believe in maria
could;ve gave basa sequence in this but the fact none of them was singing in that scene was very important for the atmosphere
but in the end we still getting cucked so
tru
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
only sad maria and tsubasa willl be dead last
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
shirabe transformation will be fun
for the og trio s1 stuff
gear name from axz alchemic bits from gx
of all transformations
yea cause they kept all gimmicks
dw
just having too much fun with this here
i mean i know i noticed
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
how did that pass
thats hella lewd
bruh
(and loving it)
my feed was full of people posting thighs idk
riding scythe
Death arcana
she still had cool shots tho?
lmao
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
i only said that cause of my younger self
i mean if someone actually gets into it they are glad there's that many in the end?
around 200 rn?
eh its not that much
lmao
is testament not
i didnt rly think scorers were jojo
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
now she has 4 hands
go full jojo do it
unless the custodians are vampires as well
but eh not a big jump from naruto/ogawa tbh
no idea where vampires come in this
she is frankenstein or something
also going by the shot and their shadows
her fkin hand opens and its a rocket launcher
hard to tell yet but i mean
ok?
i mean like if they wanted to go more into tarots as far as to make that it would be back then
could see that
maybe if xdu collabs with persona or sth
they would have back then
kinda too late if they wanted
mom death
well there you go
anime wont go full meaning lol
and unreadable font
and having screams on their skills
than devote their life to saying dess
what else must a chara do
pls
lmao
guusha no ishi
u think?
empress <:MariaSunglasses:336656798687690752>
we know 1 for sure
i mean
giant imouto was probly the only funnier part apart from anytime carol said a line
not that it matters cause it was comic relief
was coin's imouto based on anything
u mean carol?
well there was the hero at least
never noticed
there are more characters than garie in gx?
testament is more hype on chorus
nah this is more of a banger
<:MariaSunglasses:336656798687690752>
now i dont
i think it was a tough call of testament vs this for my fav
cant wait
past 3min mark u can really tell its the part that will finish the series
once again
im glad to be alive
did anyone hear full metanoia yet
well yea im saying how i think its unlikely if they didnt do it back then
🤔
nothing
lmao
probably
for sure they are not finishing the last cour without some gen action
im sure they will connect other stuff that happened till now back to him
he was always the villain
do it
so we can kill him no prob
he will probly absorb a relic and become sth ugly
im gonna be really disappointed if he survives this cour
also glad she finally got to fire the sniper lol
and the armor itself shooting at her was nice too
rly liked the armor purge in there
i thought chris one was like almost the best so far
rly?
cause maria and tsubasa
cause maria
ill raise it with op frame editing
https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/309512534866526210/599284872540061698/unknown.png?width=813&height=458
both of those translations are lul <:TsubasaSmug:585839805737467920>
just with her weird japanese like tamasaka
lmao
yea she just said im fine
pretty sure she didnt mention her age in that line lol
just turn into some ugly relic shitter so we can kill him
but eh as if he will fight normally
idk about jacked but he probly has sword skills
lmao
maria still solved it
so was dad
she was consistent enough with dad before
ill be disappointed if she doesnt get a shot at him
give him a serenady kthx
but i just want maria punch
i know people want basa or gen to fuck fudou up
probly next ep tbh
lul
cause only those 3 had hearts
bikki shirabe maria get the axz trio as stands
inb4
lmao
we got 5 more
1 gold gear rekt all 3 of them
gl
as long as they die soon they can sing for all i care
so probably
i hope not but its mao
gl defending these dumbfks lmao
kills 100k people just to ptsd
we need blood
basically
like us
we do pitiful evil deeds but hey we cute
thats all they are lol
they are pitiful
i rly cant find a trace of compassion for these3
lmao
im worried about hibiki actually wanting to befriend these 3

it was a palm strike even
well she kinda did
cant even begin to imagine wtf tsubasa and maria can do with faust robe shit lmao
this was ridiculously good
fkin hell
Do we even have enough episodes to show off these new gears
the oppressed race
i think they are gamers
so anything goes
their brains are carol tier
they've already established
i mean
pls dont fkin suggest befriending milaarc in front of tsubasa
only thing i minded was that she stopped the punch
like carving activation sequence on air
i liked the line visuals she did before caliber
she is almost 23 isnt she lol
*who the hell would mind maria fanservice*
gud shit
and she got a new devil breaker
that chainsword action is 🔥
its still already my fav
lul
they should be in BD
it cuts to her already doing dagger stuff
when her gauntlet loads up
go back and watch it again
yes
1 of the cuts is very awkwardly put there as well
im sad maria has some seconds cut from her animation
from the meaning alone
metanoia fits tsubasa as a move way more than hibiki
if only that happened
im all for tsubasa handling the finale fight
now i know why
i thought xv bikki song sounded a bit off
we'll take that
go ahead
do it
eh will probly just kill all 3 of them before she befriends
how to skip 10 days time
her tail thing seems so worthless
dog still seems the weakest of these
*or can he*
bikki was undergear too till hands happened
those violins are 🔥
that intro is def her best at least
pls excuse mass murder
weak and cute
they are so fkin weak
lmao
they are all weak
as long as they die soon after they can help us sure
well at least they wont bother editing the actual transformation even if they do
i wonder if they will heavenrend
xv icon pretty much tells u that
final will be silver form xdrive
nah just
lmaooo
lmao at maria animator saying he was worried cause he heard rythmic gymnastics was involved and he was bad at it
<:TsubasaSmug:585839805737467920>
maria sequence might have gave the spotilight to boobs but we still get the important stuff
https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EAiHc5LVAAAxQGK?format=jpg&name=medium
https://twitter.com/topturtling/status/1155224703939698688
if its still a function in the gears
cause i could see that happening to her at this point
is rage form even possible after last ignition
i wonder
sounds doable
with ptsd
and cut song right off
get transformation
maybe
i really love the go ahead go ahead part
its so good
https://youtu.be/QUQbGCbZZ_8
lul
but nah
i mean id figure all of them would get some shit done to them after ep2
why <:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
then there's tsubasa
everyone having fun
bikki s1 bath
dmjii comedy
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
no wonder tsubasa song  gets fkin 3 weeks after maria while the rest were 1 week each
yay more ptsd
yes
pls
lmao
hibiki gonna tell her to be friends
now next ep milaar gonna do the exact same shit again apparently
the fact no1 gives a shit about ep2 surprised me
but its not that it surprised me
<:TsubasaSmug:585839805737467920>
i mean i dont count gx
maria isnt close to tsubasa as u would expect either
rly feels like they just bully tsubasa for the sake of it lul
everyone doesnt even give a shit about the concert like ep3
there's a huge disconnect between tsubasa and the rest of the show lmao
in front of tsubasa
its already mindblowing hibiki went lets be friends
ill be hugely disappointed if so
make it soon pls
it should be alchemists dying
if they keep sth from axz
there u go
serena would be into algatram
<:TsubasaSmug:585839805737467920>
amalgam is happening cause of adam
and not animator choice
i guess it checks out if only 3 of them having hearts on sequence intro is actually relevant
killing them
apart from u know
cause appart from saint germain for hibiki the rest got no interactions
and combinations are super sleep imo
numbers dont check out
the rest no idea
i could see serena for maria
lul
is probly whats gonna end up being
basically u need someone to act as a stand
<:MariaSunglasses:336656798687690752>
more weapons for maria
and bikki had no time to give her a scene for it cause saint germain is right after
the rest actually go for the kill
there's no lack of reaction rly
they had no way of knowing they didnt kill them right there
bs lul
the rest kill their enemies ez np
as long as hibiki isnt part of the fight
also as axz tells us
its gonna be in broad statement to probly only vanessa
lmao
personally interact with milaarc
thats why i dont think they will ever make her
tsubasa cut them all
rip every transformation ever
oh well
make it happen
i wanna see her yeet this double wrath on fudo
thank you
whoever thought of fusing wrath and blue flame
this is the biggest yeet

lmao
confirming tsubasa will fuck him up
i appreciate the fact he had to point out he wants a sword
cause evidently they are dumbfks
but fail miserably
they will try
they probly wont even backstab him
lul
more than enough reason
i mean they were at the chateau
as long as its not carol
they just need elfnine to the chateu
fudou wont give a fk a random pervert died
and thats it
and get elfnein
its probly just tell miku to tell the gears
i dont think him dying would give them out right there and then
mb
nothing else would produce that
thats a cut head
yes
lmao
it was a fountain
thats not just taking a hit
ur still talking about a head flying
''protecting
lmao
over random retard
and even considering the chance its miku or elfnein
ur rly talking about a head being cut off here
not rly
u are
so fudou wants elfnine now
and failed when they tried
i mean yea thats why they succ
they probly just need an alchemist to do stuff for them cause those 3 suck
<:TsubasaSmug:585839805737467920>

oh god the 2nd one is also top tier
not that i didnt expect it but fkin hell best maria song
but maybe maria now
yea i was thinking hibiki will yeet that
palm strike that time
i mean she still jabbed vanessa
bless gym maria being in an actual episode
or maria punching thots
lmao
99% of hibiki's moves are genjuro memes and u think training isnt good
yea i guess
well fuck
so that glove in the op was indeed maria's
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
all vanessa weapons lose to 2 revolvers
jing probly got rekt from lazor
i didnt even think that miku would get a new gear but i guess it makes sense?
now for maria
oh good
would be great if 2nd time of each sequence were uncut
and thats it? lul
it was uncut this time?
full?
every single time
they dont need anything to beat them effortlessly
noble red sucks
its fine
im still sure noble red is dying and no1 from main cast
if it ends well and gay im fine with it
feels like maria vs tsubasa is happening
if she was sane
tho its probly happening
sigh i rly hope basa doesnt go on their side temporarily
im sure its coming but when
we just need some gen action in this cour
kty
i hope maria vs tsubasa later on is as gay as possible
best moment was basa slapping maria's hand and instantly regretting tbh
this is nothign compared to other shit they've done with her missles before
rip
back to impersonating kanade
calling everyone weak
but then that line
lmao
yea she seemed calm in the fight
how can she look so happy and the actual thing that happens is pretty disturbbing
i was prepared for the tsubasa bait but damn
noble red are so fkin bad they gonna make carol look good
its amazing
i knew blushing tsubasa was bait
at this point
lmao
im waiting on ver action
2soon
can safely assume dead inside at least
probably
so
i mean its true
did u watch gx
its just how chris sneezes
but we know what xv means
oh yes miku
inb4 she never even uses the yeet one on a real fight ever
fudou was the best this episode
no jiggle there <:TsubasaSmug:585839805737467920>
lmao
felt more like shitting on tsubasa counterpart
solid gx reference
yes
even 1st cour bikki riding chris
i meann the last 5mins had so many references
yes.
sir can we finish it with another transformation in there
solo vitalization? yes
rly wonder how the meeting for this ep went
noble red the absolute worst
they even making carol look like a good character in this
procceed to do absolutely the same shit
both
have u found a new way to fight or power
cant wait for bd to get rid of the epileptic filters on the lazors
thanks fudo
noble red is just so hillariously bad written carol looks amazing
but i did
i never thought id enjoy carol content
<:TsubasaSmug:585839805737467920>
5 amalgam left
5 ep left
talking about cups here
yes i know she is S tier
C?
i mean she should be around B+?
rest are tighter
pmuch only fabric
tho tbf first gear is like
i needed more nitoryu maria
thats shirabe
not tiny bit
tsubasa is very normal sized
she hot
if miku survives can she keep this look
basa was way too normal in this lol
lmao
so thats what next 5eps gonna be
and this ep completely threw basa issues out of the window
gay away
open ending live on the moon or w/e
become entities or w/e
feel like hibimiku is gonna get a cucked ending
dunno
as long as noble red also dies with him i will be glad no matter how they die
so its either that or actual basa fight
miku can probly just flick him and oneshot him
i mean
and that will suck
but noble red might not
i mean he is definitely dying
but i also hope that blood kills them
yes i want him to die
and she has to carry basa's ptsd when they remember it exists next eps too
she tired
maria cant carry every cour
💯
just straight up killed them
miku is officially the best character
cant stop wont stop
9eps in and they still bulli tsubasa 24/7
miku will probly just murder him in 1 sec
i mean
cause lmao if they pull vampire regen there
hopefully actually gone
like ever
they dont think
was this the first time we ever saw tsubasa's hair without the wing
being killed so unfulfuling and randomly fits them perfectly imo
and its all good
just die as random as noble red
oh yea im sure he wont be important
im 100% convinced he will die randomly from miku cause he will get greedy and try to grab the power again
doesnt mean he wont die
yea they didnt let basa kill him
cause he is not dead yet
then fudou interrupted what could be a beautiful scene with his bs punch
i thought it would wound her way harder but bless 2 daggers
that was some regend noble phantasm shit
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
which was 100% aimed to kill
also can we talk about the move maria blocked
also i do believe milaarc dying also had sth to do with it
it was the whole maria fight and speech not the slap
they are that bad
way more than just 2 if anything
well yea its just fragments
well probly different cause other one got blasted but still
we dont know if they used same ssj or different fragment do we
or whenever?
does it have to be after G?
it depends
sth bittersweet
im thinking sth along the lines of become entities or stay on the moon or w/e
not straight up happy end anyway
well i dont think miku and hibiki gonna get a happy end
i really want them dead lmao
just
i dont think its too much of an asspull for sg standards
gonna be top tier asspull if they can regenerate when cut to pieces and when close to dying cause fake blood
maria with more weapons <:TsubasaSmug:585839805737467920>
maria probly not yet
chris amalgam
probably
bulli tsubasa more
rly didnt have to kill topdad
feels like they just hate her at this point
but jesus
like i cant say i dont like the focus even if its so sad
tsubasa has been mentally tortured for 9 eps
what about mom on the moon
so
before dying
i mean it seemed like just press a button thing
yea i dont think he is important
the guy who says fine and dies right
no it got rekt
well the mummy should be yea
seemed like just a random fine follower
doubt that
lmao
kusanagi is not far off anyway
yes
i mean the only reason fudou used it was so he could get it for himself wasnt it lol
it wasnt?
id say he has a good chance
seeing as its only use was to bring out divine power
he doesnt but
doesnt adam have a good chance lol
doesnt make them best antagonists
just because they kill people
they were that pointless
yea its perfect for their characters
will probly be enough
>1 arm left already
regen
lul
but still
its not impossible just from being symphogear
how is that ok
to milaarc
she fkin drags it from her
lmao
i like how people saying elsa is ok
best scene across all cours tbh
nothing i was just saying that miku frame looking happy reminded me of this
then back to normal <:TsubasaSmug:585839805737467920>

this 1 frame

<:TsubasaSmug:585839805737467920>
and her face is just
when basa catches maria
its like that 1 frame on axz
that doesnt look like worred face at all to me lmao
why does miku look so happy on maria carrying her
here


oh yea
was that during basa or vs noise
probly just the lighthing
no wonder basa didnt rly get a sequence like hibiki
i mean
and made noble red who are all time low
but xv wants me to like carol
i mean before xv i considered carol the worst
they were main cast like right off basically
i mean ofc
well yea since they made them main cast
u dont see people liking the FIS NPCs with suits
outstanding moves
👏
awaken shemha again and get killed
awaken shemha
awaken carol
awaken amalgam
so far they've done
lul
fis shot fine
they didnt
fis landed some shots
lmao
every time they appear they fuck up super hard and make things worse for them
i do find them very funny tho
and thats it
i simply find them the worst
yea im not trying to make u think otherwise here
so they must not die
but its a dog
lmao
oh yea that 1.5 min backstory rly made me sympathize with them
lol
that was my point
lol
because they look cute
yes
basically
people would never care
make the exact same charas but make them look like ver
they were the worst charas in symphogear all charas included for me
witchhunt is the most common
i meant is mostly based on true shit
bad phrasing
well yea thats what i meant
most are fucked historically so
i mean its not rly a trope
especially the older its set at
but id say any religion is very easy to be evil/assholes
well most of the time its middle age so
burn the witch
lol
i dont think she did
<:CarolYandere:424047704826707980>
but her arguements were 1braincell instead
i know that
and not because they killed X amount of people
the concert is what makes nr the dumbest of all to me
and well i was right
i believed nr was made to make carol look good from the start
but on gx lul
i like what they trying to do with carol's character now
i mean i like elfnein obviously
nah still better than carol and nr
hmm i wonder
wasnt in my list ngl
fine exists
oh right
i think only basa and maria woould get stands if it happens
thast a good fit
now if she goes amalgam and kanade is the reason she starts healing
literally no point to happen here
from gen
amalgam out of rage and to kill fudou that was planned to be cancelled from the start
lol
this would be the worst fit
uh no
probly next time tbh
well u would have the same problem if u tried to think of an ok religion real life <:TsubasaSmug:585839805737467920>
bless people who stitch stuff
http://is2.4chan.org/a/1567324791753.jpg
miku best girl
nah he totally into wolfenstein
thats also possible
or u can just be an asshole from birth
<:TsubasaSmug:585839805737467920>
the gun he pulled out basically confirms he is
not much to figure out
fudou tells them to kill the stadium
im genuenly doubting
im not doubling down lol
concert is definitely fudou
pretty sure most of the shit was fudou
more like only example
is it just speculation
like at all
i never noticed a scene where they state elsa is behind every plan
lol
cause that makes no sense
was it ever stated the seal was elsa planning
kidnapping miku?
so the ones that went well were like
also failed
3rd went to fudou
2nd bloodpack failed
failed
first bloodpack retrieval
i mean
all those plans she failed damn
what did elsa do the whole cour apart from being a dog
maybe milaarc for shock value
nothing major about them
lmao
otherwise very straightforward
the only thing that makes this scene confusing is being symphogear
hopefully
barely touched it
it shattered it so easily
i think branch sword has sword breaker abilities
lmao
muh sword
yet
blind cult like obsession
evidently
not basa
i meant gen and topdad
how many kazanaris in the goverment even
these 2 anyway
i mean in the end wasnt he using the goverment and fuck over kazanaris lmao
did he even care about the kazanari's at all
lol
not randoms
literally the soil
fudou cares about the country
the stadium thing does not look like her work at all to me and thats about it
nothing i didnt even doubt she is the leader since i didnt know that from the keywords
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
leader of nr that gets bossed around by fudou and then they die
cause thats the only thing shown
lol
i never doubted that
the whole thing looked like fudou-milaarc only to me
to completely bash her about it
for basa to wake up
fudou like literally waiting on his office
and u want it to be elsa
it makes sense to me that its fudou
eh
but still when nothing is ever shown
both fudou and them ofc
thats still all speculation
yea saw it
would rly love to see a song session
i hope its not just pictures
dubbing can be done before the whole season even airs
but well rly doesnt mean anything
yea elsa or milaarc since i dont know them
lol
i think not
that's mao's twitter?
elsa?
by uh
basically saying voice acting has ended pls enjoy the rest
dubbing ends way before it airs
cant rly consider that anything
probably
the other 2 die so vanessa is left with no goal so she goes might as well help geahs
yea they just suck at it
seems perfect
nah mansion comes down so when shit is over they cant find them and miku wont go on guilt trip
lul
can probly heal getting sliced in half
cant heal and arm for days
fast and randomly
rly not much different than alchemists dying to unisons
yea as long as they dont pull last episode comeback and die again like axz
and there's no backstory to tell anyway
just even less relevant than SG in the end
idk is it the flames
sth about the angle and the animation rly clicks to me but cant remember
lmao
i dont think its that
it rly has me tripping
im still trying to remember what the hand thing fudou did with his sword reminds me of
and it surprised me
well we recorded that like months ago it aired
but i remember hearing random seiyuus being asked about roles of them and answering stuff like
id imagine geah is pretty yikes to manage so that would make sense
rly depends on the show
stop
maria
that
is
what
seems like the way to actually die
the epitome of not getting normal bodies
get fused
thats probly what it is tbh
lmao
its probly that mecha from first screenshot not milaarc
lmao
thats kinda worse
so she alive
kill maria too
only 1 thing left to bulli tsubasa
maybe they will actually do it
just carrying the body away rly
so
him being alive will make the song worthless
pretty sure those purple claws is what rips maria so probly not
that maria preview will be the mecha's entrance
lmao
yea again they all look like that in those frames on ignite
cause they all have those pmuch
claws?
which part of it
eh same thing
did they go abomination
probly soon
https://pbs.twimg.com/media/ED3YA9gUcAEDokN?format=jpg&name=4096x4096
disgusting
they better kill nr
its not possible
how do u even draw that
but damn zababa fusions never disapoint
yay more forced sob nr story
omegalul
oh right they did
they already gave it a name?
a bear trap with a top in it
lmao
what can u even call that thing they made
if they split in duos we getting unisons probly
lmaooo
amalgam still destroys them on full power up
well probly amalgam xdrive on teamfight and that one for finale
with all the colors and stuff
logo bikki looks more like xdrive of silver mode
trunks cant catch a break
lol
no time for that
no reason they wouldnt share the info lol
yea she was starting to doubt the curse and then they connect that to actually telling us what it is
that was the whole point of chris' thoughts there lol
before they were told
she literally almost figured it out on her own
i mean
damn this was the best throwback to G
maria always coolest moves
holy shit
that cross ougi
also
very important maria frames


airgetlam is so important at this point
but i rly want maria to get a shot
thats fine and all
super important to last fight
rly feels like airgetlam should be
i know hibiki gonna smash main boss again but damn
rly just bless this episode

just maria stuff
just make it a fkin dragon
how do u upgrade a chainsword/whip
i mean it makes sense
the dragon omegalul
like rly bless whoever designs maria moves

eh its about the same
hibiki chris song
they might
i mean who knows
i mean yea i said i wish she did
top tier meme kill
milaarc actually died from that
i wish
satelight does love its 5ds memes
but eh
well that one has arms and wings so not rly
5ds
lel

both
who knows
maybe but its def a dragon before it forms so
hell it looks like a beak

nah its mouth is more sharp not as wide
its a fkin dragon
also
cause ofc they would focus on maria animation this time
just too fast

or well it did
it just didnt open
maria changes the most in amalgam huh

it would just be super hillarious if she died from the fly thing
lmao
i already repeated i said i wish
when she remembers

its intro is starple
but good touch regardless
probl not
maybe best stand will have another moment
yes
and im glad they did sth useful and still died
new xdrive looks pog
<:TsubasaSmug:585839805737467920>
they wont die 4head
i love chris bow stuff so im glad
hope we see it again lmao
chris's bow just fires caldblogs permanently
also lmao at CR translating it bondage
purple tsubasa is rly strong
thats a dumb title
oh i see
wasnt last episode delayed
huh
just dont do action
they can still nail slice of life
sure
yea like pre 2012
lol
who the hell would pray anything moves to jc stuff
it needs like 10 seasons for that
lol
it wont
its hard to be excited about this when i know how atrocious the ending is
even if i know everything till last volume is great
haha
the more people that read the novel the faster the series is dying
this is happening cause they know if they wait more it would flop
it ended.
gotta cash in before more people read the novel
makes sense this happens now
lol
guess yorokobe villain will also change
but oh well
no miyuki is sadness
finally
horie <:SerenaMunch:661660046370799697>
blessed decision to make jeanne ending2
https://youtu.be/nTUJ5SYqsxQ
lets fkin go
Shaman King op2 Nana Mizuki
holy shit
bless
they finally revealed nana's opening
https://youtu.be/yNaOFjyT9cY?t=66
always a huge plus
adashima has kitou akari being SSS tier tbf
very similar writing
adachi shimamura is probly the next best thing?
then again not like anyone expected for it to both get an anime and look as good as it did
tho the manga ended quite a bit ago id think it would happen already
maybe
yaga kimi is god tier yuri
thats unfair
https://youtu.be/n3LACFlk200
<:TsubasaBliss:672861879000891432>
based
nana posted the new shaman king opening before the anime showed it
bless nana
https://youtu.be/4JhEIr_0bdo
damn they doing it
https://youtu.be/3FByOPkvoR8
damn didnt expect eguchi on mc
https://youtu.be/A67f1frjfik
people will be biased towards anything trigger makes
rly couldnt see it coming
shocking that the thing that needs doggystyle to activate mechs turned out shit
doesn't make it any less hot
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
yuri
counter point
the last one
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
the hentai ova probly made them more money than those 2 seasons
kaguya changed staff?
but nothing big to be called falling apart lol
i remember a few stiff parts here and there animation wise on the last couple eps yes
it did?
🤔
mahoutsukai
than cloverworks
should be more worried about wit
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
the anime original ruined them
lets forget about babylonia or bunny i guess
lol
concern?
actually great animation since they cared for that scene
like actually 1:1 adaptation of lines and panels
never seen that before
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
but the villain he is killing is completely different
so they animated them frame perfect
but then they still wanted to do some peak fights from the manga
the plot was so entirely different
its like
its probly happened somewhere else before
i dont think ive ever seen them handle manga content like that
such a fkin weird case
it was
what a waste
but they had to ruin the story as well
with onmyouji
id be ok if they did that
if its popular enough
to maybe get to the good one
sit through actual derp animation
yea pierrot is like
as in long running shounen
if
yes
at least its not pierrot
or ur fucked
u either get the golden ticket to bones
maybe but nobody wants to do shounen
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
this is shaman king brotherhood
i mean yea
its solid now that it got to the part og fucked up
idc if they rushed the first cour
oh im fkin thankful for that lol
yea i still loved it
animation was potato
tbf tokyo ravens had a million issues anyway
but still got to see most of the impotant ones
sad we dont get to see some top tier moments that got cut
it was still great adaptation if u ask me
there was no real better way for the anime to go than just adapt the important stuff and cya
well i mean generally
psure it was the right call lol
lotta people didnt like they chose that route but like
so horimiya
like most trigger stuff
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
to me it sucked from the start
i mean thats what they wanna say
sadly
lol
its still a massive success
but like
it now has this general picture of ending being shit
and more polished
the moment it got over that part there was some pretty good shots
hopefully the chill rush cour was enough stalling for them to animate the rest well <:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
https://youtu.be/4JhEIr_0bdo
thank
rip any benio content
rip the next 3 timeskips the manga does
into original ending
is a completely different character
but the plot around it and the person you are going ham on killing
hell yea

only way to get mahoyo voiced since they will never bother
would be amazing if true
i cant even tell when he is trolling anymore
gdi karoshi
https://twitter.com/KaroshiMyriad/status/1470638436226777088
wife being hayamin is so godsent
every other role but him <:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
also megumi voice acting <:ChrisPray:672578403156885504>
what a banger song too
jesus
https://youtu.be/e8nij7jRB6M
koyama you poor soul
https://twitter.com/k_hiroriro/status/1475122594798247939
cope
maybe this just looks like him cause its mostly an enhance still from the animated part which they will just use the default ufo fate art
and it shouldnt have
mahoyo never had takeuchi art
tm discrediting koyama as always
but jesus even the artstyle
yea thats why i wished it was cloverworks
can he not ruin one thing
ffs
why is it takeuchi art
blessed
https://twitter.com/grisaia_fw/status/1496862481838325764/photo/1
thought they would hold off for another ep or 2
ah so it begins

||it's a different reset||
it is
tho i doubt anyone not playing the game would like it
s1 was pretty good too

bless random restock of vol4 and 5

nao rly outdid herself with this song holy
