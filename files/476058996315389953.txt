He was the one who came up with RWBY.
RWBY isn't perfect, but nothing is. I really love the direction they're going with.
Oum wasn't the only one working on the story.
The team already had a plot outline, so the story is still going in the intended direction.
Yeah.
The one responsible to the choreography in the first few volumes is the creator,  Monty Oum.
Bisexual icon Blake Belladonna.

Unfortunately these are the people running the site.
I agree with you.
Yeah.
So, yeah, you can't even tag what you want.
They changed the tags on a image I uploaded and when I changed it back they threatened to ban me "for tagging violation".

Noise that look like the gears or gears with Noise powers?
Maria feeding herself to Chris.
Something more wholesome.

She turns into a monster.
They still drink about the same amount.
I think it's funnier if Maria can drink alcohol like water while Kanade gets smashed after three glasses.
But she's slavic.

Actually, since Symphogear is in the future they probably have the technology to create babies from two egg cells.

I think she's just embarrassed because it's a maid outfit.

Well, yeah.
I don't think the others would force her if she was really adamant against it.
Like, I get where you're coming from, but being easily flustered is part of Chris' character.
What makes you think wearing a butler uniform would make her more comfortable?

CAROL IS NOT FUCKING REAL.
You see, here's the difference -
REAL LIFE IS NOT A FUCKING ANIME
I FUCKING HATE THE INTERNET STOP STANNING MURDERES

Stan fucking Enoshima Junko for all I care, but when it comes to REAL PEOPLE that cause REAL SUFFERING, it's just disgusting.
Excuse me for getting angry at people stanning the person responsible for murdering my grandparent's families.
If you can't separate reality from fiction you're not old enough or mentally well enough to consume fiction.
I dunno, it seems like a pretty important point to me.
CAROL DIDN'T KILL REAL PEOPLE WITH REAL LIVES.
Can't believe Silence gave this  up.
Holy shit.

The movie cut an important plotline.
But don't skip the second season.
They're like canon divergence.
Extremely forgettable.
You can skip them, honestly.
The first and second are in-universe movies. The others are not.
Those are completely separate.
Considering the changes.
But it makes more sense if the recap movies are movies in-universe.
I guess?
It's the characters (post StrikerS) talking about the events of the movies.
Listen to the commentary track.
No, it's canon.
There are recap movies, that are in-universe movies based on the first and second seasons, and there are the AU movies.

I can't read Chinese so this is what I gathered from the artist's art of that AU.
Or more like, Kanade, Miku and Serena either defected to TWS or founded TWS to oppose SONG.
Like, something happened in that AU and now SONG and TWS are at odds.
I think it's divorce between the groups.

Yes, but the original.

The changes they made from the manga were great.
For real, I absolutely loved it.

Dath Vader.

Wer what?
It went about as well as you can imagine.
The Nazis tried to invent a time machine.
Shitheads couldn't even build a decent rocket.
There was a conspiracy theory that the Nazis had a secret base on the moon.
Yeah.
Moon Nazis is a common trope.
https://twitter.com/takatisakana/status/1627308481576587264
Wait, who's the moon Nazi?
Wasn't the idea that the Spear of Longinus was associated with Gungnir rather than being the same spear?
And Conceptual Weapons make everything possible.
TBH, this is Symphogear we're talking about, I won't be surprised if Kaneko is smahing different myths together.
OH!
Theory buried. üòî
Yeah, it really doesn't seem like Airgatlahm.
ü§î
And he had no left arm.
Ah, yes, Excalibur. The ancient Sumerian weapon.
And someone mentioned that Enki is wearing her gear in the opening scene.
So, huh, that thing on Maria's chest. It kinda look like the thing on the coffin.
That's what she said.
I'd do without Ver TBH.
I'd probably still love it.
^It'd be depressing as fuck.
So when you see them you don't think "lol, that one looks like a banana", you think "OH SHIT NOISE!"
They know the Noise look ridiculous so they had to establish them as a legit threat as soon as possible.
Ep 1 was wild.
That scene.
Jesus.
I wish there was more body horror.
That was dope.
Shirabe rollerskates according to AXZ's OP.
Miku remembers she's an Anunnaki and hates humanity. Goes Ryo on Hibiki's ass.
No, Kaneko too strong.
I want a more interesting motivation for Miku to Face Heel turn.
^That's just G all over again.
It's ironic, cause she's sunshine. <:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
Miku is Nanna,
AND ENDANGER HER WIFE????
Wife.
"Suppress your mental illness".
Maybe it's Japanese culture thing.
Adam was a way better executed "character you love to hate".
Ver callout hours.
He's not good.
And him feeling up KiriShira.
At least SOMEONE remembers that!
<:HibikiShock:336656371611074580>
Will we finally see Tsubasa saying fuck you to the old man?
I anything they should one with geared Miku.
I know it's unlikely.
I want her back in THE ANIME.
See?
<:HibikiTired:422925410490253313>
Yeah, but are there references to the events p XDU HAPPENING?
Where?
Considering there're zero references to it in the anime, I don't think it's really canon.
Is XDU even canon?
I just want Kanade .
I honestly don't care. They can make up whatever bullshit reason they want.
Bring her back.
End of season 1 already jumped the shark.
Bring back Rooster.
I want Kanade back.
Still losing it over how in love Hibiki and Miku are.
I didn't plan on reading the translation at first cause 
I didn't want to spoil myself but everyone on twitter losing their shit had me curios.
Though I loved it too. But for different reasons.
FMAB's ending feels generic in comparison.
I loved the FMA ending.
Man, Aoi Yuuki improved so much.
Y'all so dry.
<@237964037898502144> What's your PFP from?
Is there any other Bikki I should know about?
You're Bikki, he's Bikki, everyone is Bikki!
More Kanade scenes? OwO
NO
I'M NOT READY
DSDSDSDSDSDSDSDSDSDSDSD
I don't like arguing on the internet.
That's how I use it.
No, it's "you got a point".
Especially the rotating one.
I think it's hilarious.
Mood.
All the seiyuu needs some tea for their throats.
The CD versions always feel lacking without the screaming and grunting.
Baby sord.
The one Hibiki saved looked like a character from SoraYori.
The Gears'.
Of course, saving people is their job.
Elfnein suffered enough.
Poppipa is actually Arisa's harem.
Afterglow is rock.
I DIDN'T KNOW THAT!
Oh my god.
WAIT, TOMOE??
Kill her, Tsubasa.
Fuck Vampira.
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
I'm too gay for this.
But then the thigh thing happened.
At first I was <:MariaShock:423196877354303498>
But I am horny for Kirika.
I'm not okay.
I hate this.
https://twitter.com/359456/status/1150351408643936256
Bones too good.
I'm anime only.
It is shounen after all.
MHA is good, but the fandom consist of children, so
The only thing they have in common is the superheroes theme.
No.
Kanade is actually OP.
It's actually really impressive that Kanade was as strong or even stronger than Tsubasa.
I agree it's frustrating.
Even though both of them are much stronger than Tsubasa and Kanade were.
It's supposed to parallel season 1.
Yeah, it's a cheap writing technique, but I can't stand Vampira.
I kinda wish the Custodians would come half way through and kill the Illuminatis.
The button is right there.
Translate tweet.
Poland.
Then why the gas masks?
No, Ukraine.
Yes, but the Chernobyle disaster happened long before they were born.
What the fuck does Chernobyle has to do with anything?
If XV is set in 2045
BTW
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
Maria might be special.
Maris isn't using LiNKER anymore?
It seems like it's a genetic thing.
I don't know if you *can* outgrow LiNKER.
I don't think being a descendant of Fine is related to being a candiddate.
Ver's LiNKER is the upgraded version.
Kanade on dem drugs.

Like in Hibiki's transformation.
It'd be the Lapis stone and silhouette.
BDS?
You basically need to carry your own weight with your arms horizontally.
They gave up because it was too difficult, lol.
I have friends who learned pole dancing because it gives you killer abs.
Pole dancing is actually really hard.
Too dark. Too edgy. I cut myself in the dark.
Apple never existed.
Which is kind of wack. How many technological advances are thanks to the space race?
And apparently we never landed on the moon.
Because of the technology.
I suspected Symphogear is set in the future since season 1.
TSUBASA! and maria
I love it's all small letters.

STAHP! <:HibikiShock:336656371611074580>

Okuu smells like crispy chicken.

Adam cancelled.

Carolnein the ship or Carolnein the fusion?
Cypher, meet me in the pit.
CArol back
I kinda like that the Gears are rare and used only by few.
Maybe they can continue the franchise with a different system.
If XV is really gonna end with the Gears gone, I don't think we gonna get a next gen.
maybe a political threat?
She's like 30 she's not that old.
Make Nanoha the main character again.
Force got cancelled and nuked from canon.
*Looks at Nanoha*
I'd love more adult magical girls in anime.
Gay.
Serena's seiyuu too expensive.
Prelati's Gourmet Race.
A spin off of SG, Cagliostro and Prelati eating different foods.
I'm pretty short and had been mistaken for a highschooler.
It's okay to be uncomfortable with something, but don't bully people who like it.
The important thing is to remember fiction isn't reality.
Especially since Tsubasa was clearly having flashbacks.
People aren't robots.
It's just that some complaints are really stupid and sound like people are just looking for a reason as to why this praticular thing sucks.
Then why are you even watching?
Some of y'all seem to really dislike al ot of things about Symphogear.
This is Symphogear, fuck mortality.
Carol back.
Bring Kanade back! <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
<:KanadeSit:535301654464036884>

<:HibikiWhat:336656482907193344>
I'm not attacking you??
Case in point.
Masculinity is really fragile, huh?
SHe's just short.
It's not about men being "flawed" or whatever the fuck.
No, they're just trans.
Cagliostro and Prelati.
We do have trans rep.
Not a bad idea.
<@189146272865845248> Relatable.
I'm just worried for Chris. I don't want her to grow up alone. <Mama Mode

So when's Chris getting a girlfriend?
Wolfgirl.
I like "ze".
God, I love Okyou Shensoujing so much.
Yeeah
I mean
Maria in AXZ OP. üí¶
GIVE US THE MUSCLES SATELIGHT!
WHICH IS A TRAVESTY!
They showed her abs once.
Hibiki's muscles are modern art.
The real modern art is anime.
A new kind of Noise.
The fuck is that ugly thing?
unconsciously.
That's how Symphogear songs usually work anyway.
Shirabe looks like a twig though.
I could watch this GIF for hours.
Shirabe.
But the neckbeards don't like muscles on their waifus.
If they weren't cowards they would have made the gears buff.

Yours or Chirs'
Senki Zesshou Symphogear: Yukine Chris and the Student Debt.
*Goes to a couple*: so which one of you is the Hibiki and which is the Miku?
Miku's Rice.
Hibiki's brain is filled with gohan and gohan.
IQ is bullcrap.
We need to define what we consider "smart" on this list.
I think Krika is dumber than Hibiki.
Nah, I'm used to have to run to a shelter.
With Miku.
SHe's saving it to buy an apartment.
Zesshoushinai is always canon.
I wonder how much they get.
dess
Kiri-chan loves DESS
You don't?
Honey, that's not what "eating your wife" means. <:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
But it isn't because it wasn't dark.
Scum Dad was bad.
This is the anime with a girl punching a mountain shorter.
It dousn't need to be bleak, that's not the kind of anime it is.
Symphogear isn't a torture porn, it's about hope, inner strengh and friendship.
I dunno, the rap is kinda cool.
It doesn't have to be dark to be mature.
G only got greenlit because the CDs sold super well.
Season 1 sales were pretty low, actually.
THanks.
Just link it.
Anyone has the full version of Metatonia in mp3?
<:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
No, that's just us nerds.
If anything most shows that try to be "dark" end up being childish.
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Dess!
Dess strong. Dess Sexy. <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
It's from the AXZ Zesshoushinai.
My favorites are the subs inside Hibiki's mouth when she swallowed the cicada and the subs tilting  when Cag bit her tongue.
There is a very powerful energy emanating from this image.
EP 3 IN AN HOUR! <:MariaYell:336657352264646657>
Damn, Miku.
No, the best one is Miku hitting Hibiki.
THey're fun.
Why?
Yeah.
They're canon.
Highly recommended!
Nooooo <:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
She had?
Tsubasa is the opposite of dummy thicc.
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
It seems like an act.
I'm worried about Tsubasa. She bounced back too fast.
I loved that Chris' song had references to her other songs.
HOW IS XV SO GOOD
I hated Ver.
Fudou is like 120
Vampira doesn't deserve redemption.
Villains can care about their families and still be irredemable.
Fudou IS the villain.
*It's me for having my ass kicked by Tsubasa*
Tsubasa ma be flat, but she could still kick my ass, so who's the real winner?
In MY day, anime looked like shit to be fixed in the DVD.
Anime watchers too picky.
Maybe they'll need the extra time in coming episodes.
No, boobllets.
Boollets.
Too many people in chat
Both.
Uncle Sam?..

So cyborg.
What's gynoid?
Except PR and Zeria.
Anigtube is shit.
Oh, so I wasn't imagining it.
Do they even have anything to fix?
Fate is wack.
GranBlue also has a trans Cag, right?
Because that is bullshit.
Is that why King David isn't a redhead in Fate?
Faith! Sana.jpg
Well, rather than Jungian, it's more of a Shinto thing.
Like if people believe a rock is a god it becomes a god.
Touhou has a Jungian "if enough people believe that it becomes real".
I'm a Touhou fan, that kind of thing doesn't bother me.
Over a baby.
Tsubasa destroys a bike while Hibiki fixes it.
<:MariaConfident:336657338729627658> "Expect the unexpected."
The Hibiki Berserk.
I don't mean Ignite.
I love it when the protagonist goes feral.

^Nephilim.
Stay the fuck away from Miku! <:HibikiShock:336656371611074580>

No.

She didn't actually say that, that's just YT memeing.
Subs came out at almost 10 PM.
Stayed late because of XV 3
I'd tell you to sleep better, but I'd be a hypocrite.
Why are you like this?

Cool and impractical.
The Seven Branch Sword!

Swords and feathers.
Tsubasa kills Fudou and becomes the Kazanari head.
Fight to the dess!
There's only one way to solve it -
I WANNA SEE TSUBASA SWORD DUELING WITH FUDOU!
Like that guy from Bleach.
Maria slaps Fudou for treating her wife like shit.
<:TsubasaSmug:585839805737467920> <:MariaSunglasses:336656798687690752>
I wouldn't put it past Kaneko to do something like that.
Giving a villain depth isn't "redeeming".
Symphogeah saaa
Without jiggle.
We were robbed of Miku's transformation.
Man, that's some good animation.
If Kaneko ripped off Solo where's Sheshoujing?
That was dope.
I remember there something about Tsubasa being a descendant of Susanoo.
September.
2017.
Not everyone is speculating whore like me.
Known as the biggest Symphogear fan in the world.
I thought all the Symphogear fans followed Zoid. He translates interviews and keywords and such.
You mean the keywords?

Tsubasa's outfit is the best.
They're clearly shooting for TsubaMari.

He implied the ending will be bittersweet.
And effort.

<:ChrisOi:586551700987576330>
Big yikes.
Isn't that the pro-slavery anie?
But it really doesn't fare well on second viewing.
I loved G when I first watched it.
In the fourth episode.
You're right, that did feel like a season finale climax.
When you finally take your bra off.
<#371105434771390465>
Icckiness is blind to gender.
Women can also have terrible taste.
The what now?
I'd trust a woman to write women before I'd trust a man.
Remember when isekai stories where a shoujo thing?
The girl empowerment thing.
Also, Inuyasha was made by a woman, so.
Despite its flaws, Inuyasha was dope.
We moved from simply "being surrounded by hot girls without any effort" to "being the strongest, smartest, most awesome guy around, and also owning women".
Since Mahouka also applies here.
Or rather than isekai, it's more accurate to say "the new age male wish fullfilment fantasy",
TBW, as cringy as 2000s harems were, isekai tends to have much worse reactionary themes.
Choose your poison.
Maria's younger sister died to protect her. <:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
Yeah, Serena is the younger sister.
Let the girl grow up!

The episode.

Good question.

TBF, Tsubasa did the exact same thing as Yatsuhiro in G.
Still an asshole.
Not good but not horrible.

Him and Tsubasa are too alike.
I had enough of this guy.

So Fudou is definitely going to make Tsubasa use the bracelet.
That's nice, but I need to work tomorrow.
Good night, y'all.

Listen to Hibiki's songs for extra motivation.

I just noticed, lol.
Did what
Tsubasa's everything. üëÄ
The sounds and impacts are so satisfying.
Hibiki's transformation is my favorite.
A reminder that Carol and Elfnien are old ass todddlers.
Let Miku do something!
Miku important to the plot when<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
This manga gave me depression.
The real suffering starts after the anime ended.
Don't worry

You think this is suffering? Signed, Hoseki no Kuni fandom
Considering Symphogear takes place in the future they should the the technology to create embryos from two egg cells.
HibiMiku and TsubaMari kids!
Symphogear The Next Generation.
Which I can't play.
I'm not ready for Symphogear to end!<:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
If I had to choose I'd go for Hibiki any day.
Better than Fudou.
Horny baby.
<:MariaYell:336657352264646657>
I love Maria's songs.

"The HibiMiku bath scene was faked by Kubrick."
See also: flat earthers.
Or homophobic.
For real.
That was gay.
Remember Kirika staring at Hibiki's boobs and Shirabe being jealous?
Bet that if one of them was a boy no one would say they're just friends.
Some people really be in denial.
You'll never get into Touhou with that attitude.
I remember when I thought Happy Birthday no Uta was going to be a cute song.<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
You lose half of the characterization. üôÑ
Have you read the lyrics to her B songs?
You hate Kirika?!
||It's heavily implied her parents were deceased when she was very young which caused her to have  abandonment issues||
She actually has a psychological reason to act like an ass.
And this is why Ichigaya Arisa is best Tsundere.<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
If a character has no depth they're boring IMO.
You know what I mean.
That smile. <:MikuBliss:336657233712513024>
You can think someone is hot without objectifying them.<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Abs.
Hibiki *is* very attractive.
Nana wills it
Watch Flip Flappers, BTW.
Like FlipFlappers.
Go big or go home.
Cowards.
The Curse of Balal strikes again.
WHY FULL FUTURISM DIDN'T HAVE THE LEAD IN?!
Plus that lead in of the ED in AXZ was *cheff kiss*
That would be really jarring, though.
Because that's the kind of crazy bitch I am.
When I first got into Touhou I read the wiki. All of the wiki.
Point is, I'm a whore for lore and love hunting for it.
The story in the games themselves is like 30% of what Touhou is.
I gave it as an example of a franchise with lots of "out of narrative" story.
Yes.
Meaning 10 PM...
Ep 6 is delayed!?
No, it's cool!
Small world...
<:HibikiShock:336656371611074580>
Wait, you speak Hebrew, too?!
You can only find punctuation in children media.
They say Hebrew is hard, but at least it's written the same way it's pronounced.
You know what? I don't want to know.
Worse than French.
I fucking hate this language.
How the fuck do you pronounce "colonel"??
Wait, you don't read it like it's written?
Yosemite.
CREATED by women.
But kanji is taught in school??
Also: Miku becomes god.
That's why I love Japanese.
The English equivalent would be "god (you)" or something.
It's not even a real reading of the kanji.
Oh.
Het is just "romance".
Yeah, gay is always a genre.
Manga certainly has more in the gay department.
I want some WlW.
It's usually BL though.
I hope.
Without Korrasami receiving such positive reactions the Ruphire wedding in Steven Universe wouldn't exist.
But they did pave the way to other cartoons.
They didn't kiss.
INB4 sequel manga HibiMiku.
And while in the cartoon they only held hands, in the comic Korrasami actually kiss and refer to each other as their girlfriend.
Plot-wise it wasn't changed.
Yes.
That's why the show was cancelled from TV and was only available on the Nickelodeon site.
The creators weren't planning on Korrasami, but realized how good they matched together and decided to make them canon.

Well, beside another I know from twitter.
I never expected to meet another Israeli in the fandom.
Hibiki, you useless lesbian.
They make the duckies chuu.
With custom rubber duckies.
Pink otaku money.
THEY FUCKING LESBIANS!
HAROLD!
Also! Hibiki has been referencing Miku in her songs since her first song!
That line has two references to Hibiki! TWO!
Not about Hibiki, huh?
And Hibiki has a XDU song about wanting to spend an eternal summer with Miku.
You're lucky.
How the fuck do you read the lyrics of Eiai Promise and don't think it's about Hibiki?
Made me really emotional.
And in one of Shirabe's B she sings to Kirika she wants to grow old with her.
DMJii literally singing about kissing.
I read the manga and it's dope.
||Give Sayaka a girlfriend 2K19||
Why?

GOHAN & GOHAN!
OH YEAH, they're literally living together and not with their families!
So that's Hibiki is doing with her salary.
Because she'd get chewed up for saying that.
AOI YUUKI WILLS IT!
Please be alright...

You know what that means.

Working on a fanfic like that.
Tsubasa's heart has room for both Kanade and Maria.
Maria isn't a replacement of Kanade.
Tsubasa looking for guidance in Kanade doesn't mean she can't stand on her own. Even the toughest, most capable people needs something to lean on sometimes.
Exactly.
You really think Tsubasa just gonna forget Kanade just because she moved on?
Just because Tsubasa misses Kanade doesn't mean she's back to square one.
Let them fucking be happy after all the shit they've been through.
MUNE NO UTA SOKO NI ARU NO KA
The adapters liiiive, live their lives now, they can live freely.
No more gears.
Also Tsubasa and Maria finally start officially dating.
Hire me, Satelight. <:MariaSunglasses:336656798687690752>
Then  Hibiki proposes to Miku.
They either sacrifice the gears to defeat the Custodians or the gears become unusable after the Custodians are gone.
The climax is the gears + Kamiku versus the Custodians.
The custodians.
Or is it cone?

A bittersweet.
The entire theme of this season is aiming for "going back to normal life".
None of the gears needs to die.
You're awfully zealous about Tsubasa dying. <:ChrisOi:586551700987576330>
And it would just be a repeat of Kanade.
If you kill Tsubasa her entire character and arc goes to the trash.
Where's that tweet about characters with trauma overcoming their past and getting a happy ending being more satisfying than killing them off?
You can't kill Tsubasa.
Like, Fudou kills Yatsuhiro for snooping (to cement how evil he is) and Genjuuro dies either fighting Fudou or protecting someone,preferably Tsubasa.
Maybe both.
I do think either Yatsuhiro or Genjuuro would die.
Letüëè the girlsüëè beüëè happy!üëè
I'm still upset about Kanade's life being one big tragedy and then she fucking dies in the arms of her lover.
YES TIME!
HibiMiku wedding.
I said it once and I'll say it again -
I assume it's Hibiki fully fusing with Gungnir?

In one story Enki rapes his daughter, and then his grand-daughter, and you see where this is going.
The Mesopotamian mythology is full of rape and misogyny.  Makes the bible look woke.
Carol back! Carol back!~
More importantly -
Rice.
Regrowing her arm was important to establish how far her fusion with Gungnir went.
Not a red herring.

I FUCKING TOLD Y'ALL!
BIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIOTCH!
CAROLNEIN CANON!
It'll be "Amalgm Mode" or something.
In the Amalgm transformation.
Yugi, the Hulk, you all forgot the most obvious parallel - Boogiepop.
You're always negative.
Why are you always so negative?
Had we ever seen Kirika's ears before?
Micha good and valid.
Adorable genocide.
It's literally the same face.
OH GOD.
Let carol Live 2K19
But Elfnein worked so hard to meet her! <:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
CArol just came back they can't take her again
NO!
Elfnein has Carol under control, there's no need to get rid of her.
Carol forever!
Criticism is a good thing, but it sounds like you just hate the show.
I come her to fangirl over something I love and then you're always "this is stupid", "this is fan pandering", "this is just a cliche" and such.
It's kind of annoying, TBH.
Yeah that.
"Maria said it's my turn on the body."
Genocide?
"Try it, Carol, it's going to be fun!"
In the shinais.
They take turns controlling the body to sing.
Carol stays, and she and Elfnein are going to karaoke together.
Carol stays or riot.
Dude, wat?
Definitely had multiple bodies.
Because Scum Dad had to be there instead.
So even Carol isn't really Carol. <:CarolYandere:424047704826707980>
So in a way they're both half of the original Carol.
So we had the same idea.
And that's why Elfnein is a cinnamon and Carol is a fuck.
And probably stored all her good traits as well so she can focus on genocide.
I interpreted Elfnein as a clone Carol made to store her important memories if she burn all of them.
It's called selcest. <:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
Carolnein was a thing since GX.
It's already a ship.
Sorry.
Thanks. <:ElfneinWeld:586027421296492585>
CAn't have two Hikasa Youkos.
Absolutely not.
Let Carol stay.
NOO!
DO NOT HURT THE BABIES! <:ElfneinBullying:421432763078410241>
To Miku: "do I know you?"
She only has the memories Elfnein has.
Shut up.
You,
Hey, you.
Dude, I waited fucking years for Carol.
She won't.
Yes.
Can't believe Hibki and Miku became parents so fast.
Don't fall down, sweetie." <:MariaSunglasses:336656798687690752>
At some point you stop being surprise at the weird shit that happens.
"Kanade!" *slap* "What the fuck are you doing?"
Bring Kanade back to slap some sense into Tsubasa. Literally.
Love is stored in the Carol.
And even that is too much Ver.
He should have been only in G.
His AXZ was a waste.
I had enough of Ver.
The Chateu.
Shenshoujing was OP.
There's definitely something between Maria and Tsubasa.
If you mean "I love you" it's either daisuki or aishiteru.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcBfDQIJHiI Carol

They better milk it in the shinais.
SHE WON'T!
Bring me the fluff.
We really didn't get any good ones.
I need Carol and Elfnein interactions.

THe liquid jumps and hit her in the eye.
She didn't "steal"their gears, it's the power of holding hands. <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
<:ChrisHey:607742733817479168> Gearjacking?
The Custodians/Annunaki ARE aliens.
Yeah.
Apparently a lot was planned in the concept stage.
The Annunaki were a throw-away line in season 1.
If Hibki hadn't shown up as a gear fusion Fine's plan would have succeeded.
Hibiki fucked her plan up.
Miku the real OP.
Fine even fooled Fudou.
I'm sick of that guy.
EVer.
No Ver.
You mean Babylonians?
...Okay....
Yes.
It's not split personalty if they're different people.
Elfnein will probably be in control most of the time.
No, they share body.
She stays forever.
Carol stays.
No.
Can't she stay?
I've waited for Carol to return for four years.
Thanks guys.
And now I'm anxious Carol will be gone.
Ayahi is precious.
BOW DOWN TO GENOCIDE!
People shat on Carol, too.
Everyone shat on GX but now they realize Carol's true glory. <:CarolYandere:424047704826707980>
Everybody losing their shit over Carol warms my heart.
Lasting Song's lyrics are Big Fear.
Shiawase no Katachi references Miku and Hibiki?!
I thought he was boring.
Definitely.
She felt the one thing that gave her meaning was taken from her.
Hibiki felt that saving people was the only thing she was worth for.
Everyone took stupid pills in G.
G had more dumb moments than GX.
I didn't mind that much. Yeah it was a bit OOC, but it was an understandable reaction.
The first half was really good.
Elfnein said she's searching for Carol inside her memories.
That's practically her sister.
Elfnein, in her own words, spend every bit of free time she had to find Carol.
After spending almost half a year trying to find her in her memories?
So Elfnein is just gonna lose Carol as soon has she finally found her?
Elfnein did literally nothing wrong.
She only has the memories Elfnein has.
But Carol lost those memories.
Share control.
They can switch.
But Elfnein worked so hard to reunite with her!
Can Carol stay?
Whoa whoa I feel you in my sand~
It means black.
Perfect.
Kirika's next attack.
Lazaabiimu dess!
She gorgeous.
Wow.
A look at the Lasting Song CD.
BTW https://twitter.com/yurapeace/status/1164428376720850944
Why is Elfnein wanting to meet Carol again unhealthy?
She didn't bring her back because of an inferiority complex.
The point is that Elfnein cares about Carol.
Just fucking watch the Shinais.
No, she said Carol is important to her.
That's really cruel.
Have you watched them?
They do.
Hmm, yes they are.
The AXZ shinais.
Big Anxiety.
It feels like the final episode.
Lyrics from the OP in episode 8?!
Hmm, they did.,
CArol best.
If the secret is being free from the Curse of Balal then she should.
Armor is cooler than skinsuit.

It's called the New Testament.
Why the fuck would I reference GC over Uten.

Finally everyone will join the Carol cult! <:CarolYandere:424047704826707980>

Maria runs after Kanade with a brush and a bucket.
Like Tomosato did with Kanade in XDU? <:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
He's so ugly.
Het? I don't know her. <:MariaSunglasses:336656798687690752>

Maria.
Boyoying~
She sang about cutting her enemy's throat.
No, we're not.
-10000000 degrees take
Okay
Judaism isn't a race, so apparently the holocaust wasn't a genocide. <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
LIKE, THER'S NO ARGUMENT HERE
KIILING IS BAD
EXUSE ME THE FUCK
At least Akira TRIED to get better.
~~So do I~~
Elsa is like a teen.
Is she even a loli? I thought she was just short.
Play kedama.
But Tsubasa is HAVING PTSD!
The nazis thought Atlantis was real, so obviously they weren't that great at science.
It's a nationality.
üòí
Why are they so many trolls here?
They aren't in the same place.
Kanade good
10oK in the concert.
I sure don't remember that.
I say Fine.
Not to mention FIS.
JESUS
The anime obviously points to heroism being compassion, so why the fuck would someone killing their enemy without remorse would be considered a hero?
Even Scum Dad saw her on TV.
Symphonet is full of conspiracy theories that Tsubasa is connected to the Noise.
N O
Big brain SG
<:Germain:421434126856486912>
70k of the confirmed dead or missing.
What could they have possibly done?
Basically Carol's final attack from GX.
Damn, I expected Gen or Yatsu to die, but I still wasn't emotionally prepared.
God, poor Tsubasa.
FUN ISN'T WHAT I CALL IT, MEL
SO FUCKING MUCH
JESUS CHRIST
Oh.
Who
^
Ninjad.
INB4 Shem-Ha kills Fudou for trying to use them.
I actually fellt kinda sorry for them.
Just beam and gone.
God, Noble Red. That was fucking brutal.
It hurts.
Fuck, Tsubasa's crying.
Murder is bad.
I kinda figured it since ep 1.
"The curse is actually a blessing".
Also more foreshadowing.
To become an oni
Yeah, that was really fucking stupid of them.
Still devestated.
Also, still no mention of Kanade.
Enough Ver.
But the entire season been on hot wheels.
It did feel crammed.
It needed more punch.
Make it hurt.
And Vanessa screams as she sees her family being massacred before her eyes.
The one thing I'm missing from the scene is Elza's surprise and Milaarc's shocked and panicked expression at her friend being shot a second before both are killed.
Miku's sexy, sexy back.
The post-credit scene kinda counts?
Dropkick?
Kicking?
https://twitter.com/coaco_rh/status/1168045858455093250
"How dare you try to control me, you puny human?" *lazah*
I want Shem-Ha to Kill Fudou.
When you need to tie five seasons worth of build-up in 13 episodes. <:CarolYandere:424047704826707980>
Yes. End of discussion.
Exactly. <:MariaSunglasses:336656798687690752>
INCONCEIVABLE!
HOW?!
NO DMJII DUET?!
WHAT?!!
Waiting for that "aishiteru".
https://twitter.com/Carolnein/status/1169078542438715393
Speaking of
CR, please leave the discussion to the professionals.
He should have stopped appearing after G.
About right.
I hate her as a character but like her as a villain.
Can't foget the zes.
And the zes.
Hibiki is Kali now.
Vanaesa probably feels like shit right now.
People think that just because a villain isn't gloating they're not evil.
Lol.
"Toryaa oryaa no problem!"
Especially with Kirika's. <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
HibiMiku kiss and Kanade back.
When you watch a lot of things you recognize tropes and techniques better and gain better appreciation for things.
The swords are also shields.
Kakagae no nai mono hodo is just instumental Zesshou.
Too bad the wiki doesn't have a section for the BGM.
I think composing almost all the vocal songs is enough job for one man. <:HibikiWhoops:585839808115507222>
Anyone knows who's the composer?
Damn, those tracks slaps so hard.
Is it in the playlist? I can't find it.
Time to listen to the BGM OST, because I never did outside of the anime itself.
How did I miss it?
OMG, it IS First Love Song!
Sakamaku Keppuu has melodies from Zettou Ame no Habakiri.
I think a lot of S1's OST uses the vocal songs for motifs.
It's just a piano version. <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Watashi ni Datte Dakara is also using Gekisou Gungnir.
Me: OH!
My brain: zettai ni hanasanai kono tsunaide te wa
Me: hmm, that sounds really familiar...
I remember it being used a lot.
It has similar motifs.
Yes!
Wait, that's Gekisou Gungnir!
Is it part of a vocal song?
The intro of Yami no Oku, Apocalypse Now sounds really familiar.
During the episodes I'm too invested in what's going on, so only now I can fully appreciate how great the instruments in the OST are.
No, old gods.

What exactly does the Miku keyword say?
Yes.
Oh, untranslated.
Keywords are out?
We know. <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Those preview images sure are something.
What's the image from?
Kaijuria.
You're just not suppose to use it.
You can find the name in the bible.
Shem HaMeforash just means "the actual name" or "the full name".
It's not even the name of god.
It's not hidden.
Not everthing is comics.
We don't actually know Shem-Ha's gender.
Them.
Hibiki.
Images you can hear.
Black with red stinger.
Nep, you are testing my patient.
Aliens. It's almost spelled out.
That was talked about both in S1 and AXZ.
She wasn't going to lead people to "salvation".
Fine was fucking evil and batshit.
Just admit the gears did good.
And then the world would have been ruled by Fine.
Fine would have probably won without Hibiki.
The gears winning is good.
What does that even mean?
That's not a good thing.
Adam would take over the world.
Hibiki in a suit. <:MikuGay:336656810788388864>
But Miku is the one who turned evil. She should be Tommy.
GO GO SYMPHORANGERS!
Ver and right should never be in the same sentence.
I mean, it did happen kinda fast, I didn't notice at first either.
It's a slice of life anime about Kyouko eating different foods. <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
She's really good.
But wasn't that the entire point of the movie?
The manga is.. different.
At list she has a bottle opener.
Elsa: actually, titty is surprisingly hard and cold.
Elsa: world hard and cold, titty warm and soft.
Which Sakura?
OH BOY
Ye
I missed the preview pics.
I missed the scarf thing.
Hibiki was so cool.
Me: is that a Touhou reference?
I'm not eating that.
INB4 Maria actually is Enki's decendant.
And anyone who says otherwise is either blind or in denial.
It's already canon.
Aimi sings.
Double episode! Double episode!
They don't deserve a song IMO.
<:HibiMiku:432007202136391690>
two songs an episode? At the climax?
We don't have time for four songs!
HibiMiku duet is on my XV wishlist.
ü§î
Elsa goes to a shelter.
There's just lots of static electricity on the moon.
*Shaking in ecstasy*
Shemcest.
Songs are Wakyou Shenshoujing, Eiai Promise and Endless Summertime.


Hmm, I dunno maybe in this:
There will be.
LIKE THEY DID IN NIJIIRO NO FLUGEL.
IF THEY ADD KANADE I'MMA LOSE MY SHIT
OH FUCK, I'm emotional. <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
HEY, WHAT IF THE ENDING SONG WILL BE FIRST LOVE SONG?!
I'd fucking cry.
The end card is a callback to season 1 with the feather.
Can't forget *Silent Hill*.
Senki Zesshou Symphogear - the end.
"Yes, they are. The legend says that thousands of years ago, the six singing warriors, the Valkaryes sucrificed themselves to protect Earth... "
"Look, mom! These stars are beautiful! "
The post-credit scene is a child looking at the skies with their mom.
Shem-Ha destroys the ruins so the adaptors have to stay to keep the curse. <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
You don't.
What if the adaptors are going to stay on the moon forever?
What if it's not foreshadowing the Symphogear being gone
Remember in the ED there stars in colors of the gears?
That's her charm point.
I have to wait till monday when I get home to watch it.
I'm gonna miss the episode. <:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
I need to watch on my phone.
And low quality.
Does Anime Twist has the new episode as soo as it's posted?
Is it just me or does Hibiki kinda look like Kanade at the end there
FUCK
SHE SO
HIBIKI, THE RAW POWER
HOLY FUCKING SHIT
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
So I watched the episode.
Cabbago. <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
It's CR.
She was the strategist. She planned everything.
Elsa wasn't any better.
They all sucked, IMO.
That me
Calm down
I can't sleep. Too excited.
I hadn't had my fill of Symphogear.
Kimi Dake ni next ep?
Shem-Ha is gone but because her body was reconstructed Miku retains the Divine Power.
Always horny.
That girl is just
I can't get over Carol's bondage.
HibiMikuChris OT3.
So *that's* why she has a braid.
Yeah.
You do know what a power-up is, right?
She'd been a character for 5 seasons.
The fuck is that
To establish that she is, in fact, not straight.
Wasn't the confession about Miku feeling guilty about the concert thing?
üíç
Not until the ring. ; )
they don't need to say "we're girlfriends" for that to be obvious.
Everybody going "when are HibiMiku gonna confess?" as if they hadn't been dating since season 1.
Not an expert on Japanese culture, but I'm pretty sure the average Japanese person thinks anime and lolis are weird.
If you want realism you came to the wrong place.
It's a goddman story and it needs tension and catharsis!
BUT THIS ISN'T REAL LIFE!
You can't spend time on a character without it having any point.
As much as I hate Sasuke, that would be a waste of his entire character time.
THEN WHY MAKE THEM IN THE FIRST PLACE?!
Armados acts like it's his first anime.
If you want to be cynical and dissect everything like a child picking at their vegetables go ahead.
It's like story telling 101.
Everything is either a filler or a plot device if you look hard enough.
She won't.
I explained what happened.
I don't
She was experimenting.
If you dislike the show so much, don't fucking watch it.
Maybe the anime about lesbians fighting ancient alien with armor powered by singing isn't the most true-to-life series.
(No Serena emoticon?)
Like Apple? <:MariaSunglasses:336656798687690752>
I was like "who the fuck is Carol?" cause I forgot my nick.
I don't want Symphogear to end... <:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>

I DON'T WANT SYMPHOGEAR TO EEEEEEEEEEND! <:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
I'd watch 12 episodes of shinais.
I'm getting emotional again.
Whoa, that Reddit summery was really helpful in making things less confusing.
This is it. This is the last stretch.
The last Hibiki Radio.<:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
calm down
He's just trolling.
Don't bother.
Guys, I'm not ready.
Thank you AK, the Symphogear archivist. <:MikuPraise:585839808765493249>
I only found sped up and with some other music.
Anyone has Hibiki's henshins from all the seasons?
Feeling emotional to the notes of Hidamari Memoria.
Someone on Hibiki Radio wrote she managed to diet and lose weight thanks to Symphogear.
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Time to write a sequel fanfic.
WHY
DSHTKYTKLYULUYI CAROL
I hardly slept because I was too filled with emotions.
Harem.
Seems that a bunch of people gave XV low score on MAL to lower its ranking.
Maria isn't a "replacement".
Took you that long?
But yeah, that's different.
I like that kind of music.
So like chase from Jojo?
I love it.
Really?
I wanna buy a blue-ray.
Now we wait for YT subs.
Play SIF.
HibiMiku is fucking canon.
God, I'm still shook.
Watch it.
I'm emo.
Ah, maybe I should talk about it in fancontent.
<:GarieWink:336657101273169921>
On a silver platter (or is it a gold platter?)
I'm actually very thankful for the last episode. It gave me the perfect solution to as to how to bring about what I'm planning.
The actual story of the fic is.. something different. ( ;
It's to establish that HibiMiku are engaged.
No, that's just the first scene. Most of the fic takes place like a year later.
What an amazing prediction, Melua. No one saw that coming. <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
That's the really cheesy part.
It starts immediately where the series ends, with Hibiki and Miku proposing each other.
I'm working on a sequel fic and it's so cheesy, I feel embarrassed.
The movie with Nick cage?
Same.
I'd rather just read the stories translations.
ENG release when.
I want to understand what I'm playing.
I don't know what to do now.
A world without Symphogear...
I did have a charm to it.
I don't like how big the eyes were.
https://twitter.com/ISymphogear/status/1178018688827568128

I think Chris will be an engineer and DMJii will be dancers.
*shrugs*
Because Building Blocks.
TOO MANY IDEAS'
I have an idea for a sequel to the sequel fic, so..
Wait, Nana, nevermind. <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Idols in their 40s?!
Later, when they're adults, I mean.
Anyway, what sort of jobs do you think the gears would have?
<:ChrisSmile:336656717553074176>
~~But that's in the future~~
~~Chris is friends with benefits with TsubaMari and HibiMiku~~
Chris procreate by mitosis.
<:ShirabeEmbarassed:336657288477671436> <:KirikaShout:607741871703457812> <:MariaYell:336657352264646657>
TsubaMari.
First Tsubasa and Maria marry, then Hibiki and Miku Then the babies.
Save that for later.
Dude, they're just 18, they don't get married yet.
Who's gonna be my naked spouse?
Fucking goals.
Imagine being so gay even god gives up on her evil plan to let you be wives together.
God, is it normal to get embarrassed over your own writing ?
To my heart.
The hair thing.
It was a bit too silly to my taste.
I noticed the headwear thing, but I missed that the legs look like dress!
THAT EXPLAINS THE RIDICULOUS LEGS!
<#371105434771390465>
But let's move to anime-club.
Except Madoka wasn't really nihilistic.
But finish the anime.
Watch the recap movies if you're thirsty for more (like I was).
No, just watch the anime.
This.
Also people not understanding deconstruction for the sake of reconstruction.
People keep misunderstanding that what made Madoka good isn't that it was dark.
Caro refuses to die. She always comes back like a weed.
Sounded like Eiai Promise to me.
I'm reminded of how fucking gay Eiai Promise is.
Miku played matchmaker between Alt Hibiki and Alt Miku.
Hibiki really is hopeless without Miku, ah?
I've always seen Tsubasa and Kanade as girlfriends.
But it was activated with a chant.
I need it.
When do we get that song, then?
Oh yeah, I guess Sehnshouking is back.
HibiMiku.
"I'm not going to say HibiMiku get married/will get married. More like there's no need to say, that's amazing. Tonight."
https://twitter.com/gummy1024/status/1178238474870116352
I think that's what they say.
"HibiMiku seem to be going to marry but I wanted it to be more marriage like(?)"

JP reactions:
Now I wish I bought the CD.
It was. Wow.
The wiki.
I fucking can't
Listened to it now for the first time.
Anyone has Kimi Dake ni MP3?
There are several.
It was a different Shenshoujing relic.
Let's just agree to disagree, then.
Even without a converter unit it's still a Symphogear.
Anyway activation chant=Symphogear.
Like Amalgam.
Shenhoujing is a combination of a Faust Robe and a Symphogear.
Yeah.
No, Dur Da Bla was activate with playing the harp.
Ayahi making fun of Maria's lines.
https://twitter.com/momo_nosukeee/status/1178302421975519232
The one that doesn't count.
Jewish New Year.
No?
Today.
It is.
Good thing it's New Year's holiday. I don't think I could work today.
Cold and wet noodles.
Would Carol and Elfnein have a sweet tooth?
More like "I want to save Miku not because 'it's the right thing to do', but because I want to."
Classic lesbians.
Classic lesbians.
Kuma shock!
The show stopped before that to give them privacy.
New trend - yelling Metanoia! when you hug some one.
https://twitter.com/panbazana01/status/1178372269514477573
Is this British English?
It is as far as I know.
Yeah, I agree.
Oh.
After they get married, duh.
Tachibana Miku or Kohinata Hibiki?
Hey, we match!
<:ChrisOi:586551700987576330>
To be fair, who doesn't think Tsubasa is hot?
The inflation bots were removed, though.
That's why I'm suspicious.
It's a consistant rate.
It was 8.67 yesterday night.
It was 8.65 in the morning and it's 8.63 now.
I smell bots.
XV's score continues to plum in a suspicious rate.
Â∞èÊó•Ëä±.
They kissed off camera.
Why would Kanade give the children drugs?!
Found another one.
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Because that's what you do when you take a picture.
Finally some scans.
https://twitter.com/JikurindeEremia/status/1179071525472866304
We got to see Kanade again...
Holograms.
That denial comes from homophobia.
If someone says Hibiki and Miku aren't in love, at this point they deserve the homophobe medal.
It's not confirmed whenever she's his descendant or not.
I thought it was a joke because XV.
Wait, Xtreme Vibes is the name of an actual song?
BITCH, WHO?!
So the remains could still potentially be used?
So are the gears gone or not?
She is.
<@!99695384296701952> Nice PFP.
Axia no Kaze fucking slaps.
FUCKING AGEMATSU
Elfnein really needed some flashing out.
XV: all your ships are canon.
Carol commits tax crime.
I JUST WANT THEM TO BE HAPPY TOGETHER!
She already technically died. I don't think there's a jail for dead people.
Still pissed off about that.
She wanted to be with Carol.
What she wanted wasn't closure.
So nothing like Ver.
Buy me a plane ticket.
Maybe I just wasn't on Discord at night in recent days.
Really? I've been around.
Aaa, I really hope the gears aren't completely gone.
But at least it would be their actual souls.
Ghost are still dead.
The real them. Not hallucinations.
I thought Tsubasa finally got to see Kanade and her dad again. She looked so happy.
I am allowed to be angry.
I can't even articulate why this is such a bullshit move that destroys any closure the for the gears, especially Tsubasa.
Bullshit
Fucking
I feel cheated.
Wait, so those weren't ghosts?
I guess we just see it differently.
Really? I thought they have great chemistry.
I don't know if you can call it yuribait.
Oh.
I never viewed Chris and Tsubasa as romantically interested in each other, so for me it wasn't yuribaiting.
Their friendship in G was so good.
Which is a shame, because I love their interactions.
They pretty much dropped Chris and Tsubasa's relationship.
<:ChrisShock:620077681484103680>
Thanks.
Now the entire scene's emotional impact is fucking nothing.
Both Kanade and Tsubasa's dad deserve to see Tsubasa happy.
Just a short "hey, I'm doing fine. Thank you for everything."
And yes, I wanted an actual reunion.
The keyword implied those were just images from the gears head.
That's factually wrong.
How can more information can make something worse.
With the blue-rays.
<:HibikiHi:336657249827028993>
REALLY?!
And I'm sad.
The Radio show is over.
https://nyaa.si/view/1139283
Nyaa.
They're all making puns.
From the Symphogear Radio.
"DESS!" <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
"Try to imitate Kiri-chan."
I love Tsubasa and Chris in G.
TsubaMari, and whenever it's yuribait or not.
I'm gonna miss Ayahi's puns.
"Hibiki looked like a guy. So cool."
Listening to the last Symphogear Radio. <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
Who knows? maybe in the shinais.
"I sung about you many times, but it's the first time I actually wrote the music and lyrics."
I imagine Hibiki proposing to Miku by singing Kimi Dake ni and playing on her guitar.
I see 5.
Oh, yeah.
I remember 3.
Sequel bait?
We never heard of them.
Speaking of, who was the third custodian in the silhouettes?
That one just felt too personal.
I'd be fine with it if it wasn't for the girl.
I don't blame you. It was bad.
Agreed.
The concert massacre was really over-doing it on Kaneko's pat.

No way I'd subject myself to so much bleakness.
Wow, you're braver than the marines.
c'mon, man. Stop beating around the bush.
Nah, Kirika is Nora.
I don't even glance on these.
You're one of the most acclaimed writers on the AO3 Symphogear tag.
Just ignore it.
Don't let an idiot to stop you from writing.
People still use FF.net?

When you go into fandom to avoid arguing with people IRL only to argue with people on the internet. <:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
Shotguns are kinda lame, IMO.
It kinda sounds like a last season ED.
I forgot the name.
Oh, yeah!
Fucking amazing.
You know what's another great intro? G's ED.
Futurism best intro, BTW.
Especially when they're accompanied by the ED's intro.
It's probably gonna have the two mystery songs.

I hated Light and didn't want to follow his story.
Oh, you talking about Death Note? I hated it. Stopped watching after ep 26.
They have to keep up, even if it takes a long time.
That would be a victory for the arsonist.
I don't see a reason why, unless Satelight decide to show solidarity.
Not if you hide the canisters in a bag.
You're giving leeway to guys like that.
You can't just say "it's part of human nature and we can't stop it", it's not helping.
HEy, no?
Saying "we're not like that man" is not enough. We need to stop the violent that leads the fans threatening creators in the first place.
<@!246146781832806401> What the actual fuck.
Of course they didn't.
~Remainder that the US was huge into eugenics for decades~ <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Consider yourself lucky you didn't know about eugenics.
It's just that I heard that rhetoric from racists, so I assumed the worst.
Oh, okay. good worried there for a second.
You're getting close to very dangerous territory, I hope you don't mean what I think you mean.
Humanity has changed drastically from what it's been thousands of years ago, don't tell me human nature can't be changed.

The ruins were from like 7,000 years ago.
That reminds me of an article from some orthodox newspaper about how "ruins from before the creation of the world were discovered".
OH MY GOD
I would know.
Even in Israel 80% of people believe in evolution.
Just so you know, everyone is making fun of the US for having a majority that still believes in creationism.

Man, It's starting to hit how awful this is. I don't think I fully digested it yet.
They could actually afford to work.
So that's why they had so many female workers.
It isn't???
All of them.
Real as in real mythology or real as a real object that existed?

You can't revive human brains, but animal brains? Those are legal.
And since there are no rules against experimenting on dead animals there's nothing he can do.
Because the "life support for brains" machine is open source.
So now the scientist is worried someone with no ethical conscious will try to continue the experiment.
That poor pig was experiencing first hand "I Have No Mouth And I Must Scream".
Maybe even reliving the last stimuli it got - being slaughtered.
Because he realized that if the pig brain was actually conscious, it is stuck with no stimuli except itself.
Okay, so the scientist immediately canceled the entire experiment.
Except the brain showed signs of activity.
So all good, right? They succeed.
The brain cells were revived after being technically dead.
And whadda ya know, it worked.
Anyway, after lots of trial and error they ( the scientist and his team) manged to hook a complete pig brain to a "life support" machine of sorts.
And it's been done with brain cells cells before, but not a whole brain.
It's known that cells can return to faction if they get nutrients.
So the scientist had an idea to preserve brain by flooding them with hemoglobin.
The brain is kinda complicated and we don't know everything about it, partially because dead braincells kinda collapse.
Today I read an interview with a brain scientist.
Y'all wanna hear an interesting story?
People are fighting for their rights. "Yay, more yuri!" is not an appropriate reaction.
It was a way to express their feelings and experiences in a time were WlW relationships were considered either a joke or a danger to society.
Also, the yuri genre was created by women for women, not for men.
Gays aren't gonna make babies just because they can'y marry.
Of course they did.

The world s standing by and lets the Curds be slaughtered the same way it stood and let the holocaust happen.

A what?
And putting a childbirth scene in a magical girl anime aimed at 6 years olds.
Obviously the solution is making an Eva rip-off and blame it on the gays and enbies.
We don't need to legally limit childbirth, because in most countries the childbirth is already slowing down.
Maybe we could start with slower growth rates.
Nuclear waste is bad for the environment too.
Not gonna help.
^^Like the fucking planet?
Too bad most people first solution is war.
How many "woke" people believe the BDS' propaganda.
It's not like this problem doesn't exist on the left.
And there are probably many other website like it.
There was a website that was seized by the FBI like half a year ago.
Real pedos aren't interested in cartoons, they go to darkweb website to buy and sell recording of real children.
That's a very bad accusation.
Yeah.
How is that preventing someone from getting help?
Maybe the UN should help the children being abused that fucking cartoons.
Yeah, lolicon is kinda creepy thing, but as long as no real person is actually hurt who gives a fuck?
Saying that drawn lines are the same level of exploitation is abhorrent.
Recording of child sexual abuse isn't illegal because it's icky - it's illegal because A FUCKING CHILD IS BEING ABUSED.
That's disgusting.
The UN ban is basically saying that fictional characters porn is the same as real children being exploited.
Calling it "porn" is cheapening the abuse.
Please don't call it CP, it's not porn. The correct term is CSEM.
It's a bill made by old puritans who think anime is degenerate.
So, yeah, that means anime.
According to the bill depiction that can be perceived as children also counts.
That's why I'm so worried about that bill.
You think I'm exaggerating? They could totally do that.
The UN could decide that all anime is loli and ban it.
And remember most non-anime fans think all anime characters are children because of the big eyes and such.
SEE
I don't see how it's any different.
Children should not be exposed to any kind of pornography.
HOW
Instead of cartoons the authorities should focus on taking down those bastards.
Big yikes.
No male gaze.
That's the reason I only read written smut or doujins.

If it wasn't a big deal to them they wouldn't stop people from deleting their accounts.
I heard of his name, but who is he exactly?
My first language is gendered and he/him is the default. I still taught myself to default to they/them in English.
How the fuck is "they" dehumanizing?
The problem isn't the mistake. The problem is how strongly you seem to be against using "they/them".
So you didn't need to guess someone's gender because everyone was a guy.
I get a strong feeling that people who are against normalizing pronouns just wish to go back to the days everyone on the internet was a man.
It's a perfectly fine pronoun.
To be fair, that's because of the American health care, or lack there of.
I do not trust them to handle it well.

Rehabilitation is great for those who turned to crime because of their life circumstances, but some people are just evil.
I can't forget that one serial killer who was released because the judge thought he was too old to be able to murder again, and then he murdered again.
I think people who endanger the public should be kept away from the public.
The answer is capitalism, Solo.
^ For murderers and rapists?
The more I learn about how the US works the more I question how they survived as the world's most powerful country for so long.
And I really hope the answer isn't "execute them".
Also a lot of people call to abolish prisons, and like, what are they planning to do with he the criminals?
At least an official organization is supposed to obey standards and rules.
I'm really worried because I do not trust vigilant justice.
EXACTLY!
Believe me, I've people saying that it's better to just have a trained person in your neighborhood to call.
The painful truth is that no matter what we do they will be people who choose to do bad things, and the need to be stopped before they hurt anyone.
It's so naive to think all crime stem from oppression.
They think that if the police will the be gone crime would magically disappear.
It's good for things like mentally ill people (which the police shouldn't be involved with anyway), but people seem to ignore the fact that crimes would still exist?
I see a lot of people calling to abolish the entire system of the police but not a single one of them have a solution to stopping crimes.
And think that if you ship incest you condone it in reality.
Yeah, they also often call ships they don't like either pedophilic, incestuous, or both.
They're not. American culture (that is taking over the internet)  just glorifies violance and shuns sex.
Antis are okay with children being murdered in media, but somehow waring bikinis is different.
They're not real. They don't look like real people. It's not fucking pedophilia.
And in case you're wondering, no, unrealistic drawing of fictional characters are not illegal.
And they absolutely believe anime characters are the same as real children and if you're attracted to a cartoon 17 years old you're a pedophile.
These are called anti-shippers or antis for short, and they harass people who like things they see as "immoral" from age gaps ships to making NSFW art of "minor" characters.
I'm not harassing, I'm literally telling you to block them.
Three artist have been hospitalized because antis harassed them to the point of self harm, I have zero patience.
Look, maybe you don't think it's a major problem, but ask people in the Jojo fandom what antis have done.
You have no idea how many "pedo hunter" accounts (often run by minor) have been reported.
Because as I said, antis tend to harass people.
I didn't try to sick, I'm telling you to block them so you won't get harassed by them.
Save your mental health by blocking antis.
Doxxing is ilegall, in case someone forgot.
Don't interact with them or they WILL harass you.
Block Block Block. That's the best way to deal with antis.
They can block like a normal person, but instead they chose to make a call out and call people predators.
"Finding a little uncomfortable"? They're accusing people of being pedophiles. That some serious shit.
Fictional characters have no rights, they're puppet to be used in plays.
Fictional characters are not real people and should not be treated like real people.
I'm very clear on my stance.
I answered the question before you even asked if you just scrolled up to the beginning of the conversation.
I don't get why you think it's such a gotcha moment.
I was clear on that from the beginning?
No one is going to become a pedophile because they like oneeloli doujins.
They're not real, so it doesn't matter what their age is. You can sexualize them all you want.
What question?
No?
What question? You can do whatever you want with fictional characters. It literally harms no one.
They're fucking drawing. Not real.
THEY'RE NOT REAL CHILDREN FHTJTRTKJTY
They literally can't tell fiction and reality apart.
Why would anyone arrange it like that?
It's a month apart.
It's the 40s all over again.
And no one is doing shit.
Literal slavery and genocide.
At this point, if someone steps on a lego they blame it on Israel.
LMAO, yeah, poisoning our own beaches. Make sense.
The sea life, however is fucking not.
THANKFULLY, the water purifiers are fine, apparantly.
Prime minister of Israel, who should stand the fuck down already.
Oh, don't worry, I have no love for Bibi. I'm a leftist.
I'm Israeli, so excuse me if I'm paranoid.
Excuse me, could you elaborate you thought about Israel? üôÉ
He's a a self-centered megalomaniac who'd sale the entire country to keep his ass in the sit.
It will stop and next year it will happen again. That's how it works.
Last time the US "helped" in the Middle East they turned Iran into a monster.
And I'm the first person to shit on our right wing goverment, but it's impossible to just ignore this.
Can you imagine the US tolerating this shit? They would have leveled Gaza by now. 
Foreginers don't understand how diffuclt it is.
Oh god, please, people already hate us enough.
It's worse than it has ever been.
My town is close to Tel Aviv so we're in range.
YES.
YEAH, I just fell asleep and the siren woke at fucking 3.
Also riots on several mixed cities.
Thanks.
Time for my third sleepless night in a row.
We're currently staying at my aunt's place in the shelter.
Hammas launched more than 1000 missiles at Israel, several people dead and some injured.
Even if they intervene, I'm worried it'd be against us.
The police can't do anything.
Riots between radical Arabs and Radical right wing Jews.
As expected of a libertanian.
Typical.
Wasting all the money to their terror infrastracture.
And certainly not Hammas.
As if they care.
Man, Lod and Akko are in chaos.
As we say in Israel, alek pro-Israel. Turning Israel into a right wing fascist country, you mean.
Which gave me very bad flashbacks to 80 years ago.
They didn't do shit when Trump put Mexicans in camps either.
Israel helps Palastine more than the UN.
Nada.
It's not like the shoot at civilians, oh wait.
And *of course* the UN is more supportive of the poor, innocent Palestinians.
The illegal occuptions ruining things as usual.
You can't reason with a terrorist organization.
LMAO, as if it's gonna do anything.
There's speculation that Iran is behind Hammas' newly found prowess.
100%

Good night (hopefully).
I'm tired but can't sleep, so I think I'll read for now.
Both sides lost hope for peace.
It's been this way sinnce Rabin was murdered.
There are no longer talks of peace. Maintaining the status quo is the only goal left.
He made Bibi worse by giving him ideas.
Palastine beyond the green line.
There's no reason Palestine can't exist besides Israel instead of taking over it.
This is actually insulting.
No.
I don't see why the entire of Israel needs to relocate.
2000 years ago, by the Babylonian empire.
History??
Absolutely not. Israel is where the Jewish people came to be.
When you're hated based on your identity it's kinda hard to let it go.
Yes.
BDS are antisemites.
And WE used to be a minority in many countries and that really wasn't great.
No one wants to be a minority. Israeli Arabs aren't treated great either.
I don't trust the Israeli goverment.
You need to understand that both sides want to be an independant state.
They want their own country, not being part of ours.
What? No!
What's your solution, then?
Move the citizens back into the borders.
I don't know why you call it ethnic cleansing. It's taking down settelments that shouldn't be there.
??
New ones.
It's not ethnic cleansing.
We already did that a few years ago. It's worth it for peace.
Funny you speak of Israeli propoganda while spouting anti Israel propoganda.
If it Israel really doesn't about Palestinian live why haven't we just bombed them all already?
Looks like slander to me.
Maybe they weren't quick enough.
No idea where you got thst bullshit, but it's not true.
There's "knock on the roof", before the army bomb a building they send a warning to clear the building.
Yet Israel always tries not to hurt Palestinians civillians.
Yeah, I'm blocking Lankpants.
GAZA IS NOT PART OF ISRAEL THEY ARE A SEPARETE ENTITY.
No. You can't compare it.
Israel is not an apertheid.
They have a lot.
God, no.
It comes and goes in bursts.
I know some of these words.
Yes
For them dying for the cause is heroic. It makes them martyrs.
Again, jihad.
Hammas doesn't care if Palastinians die.
It's not because they're weak, it's part of their Jihad mindset.
Since it's expected to be empty.
And as I said, there's the warning before bombing, which means destroying building is purley an empty show of power by the IDF.
They hide the facilitties among civillains.
Just don't do anything? Letting the entirety of Israel suffer bombing in silence?
Also, I don't what the fuck are they supposed to do when Hammas official are sitting in the same buildings as civillains.
I know the IDF isn't "the most moral army in the world" because war is immoral, but they fucking try and that's more than any other country can claim.
No other country is in the situatin we're in.
You can't expect me not to be angry when people just eat up those lies.
Also fuck Musk.
Crypto currency was a bubble waiting to burst.
Because those who desire power are the ones who shouldn't have it.
Thank you.
And to think my biggest worry before was trying to get a job.
I just want a goddamn normal life.
People getting hurt for shitty reasons.
War is stupid.
Memorial Day is just a day before Independance Day, and that says everything you need to know.
You need to understand that in Israel there isn't a family who doesn't have a member that fought for this country to exist.
You guys can't understand what it feels like when people who don't know shit calls your country war ciminal state.
It's 2 and half and I'm tired so I'm just going to say I'm sick of having to justify why my country has the right to exist.
Supposedly supported by Iran.
War backsitting.
I haven't slept in like two days.
It's exhausting living like this.
Yeah.
Hammas doesn't care if their own civilians die, why would they care about Israeli Arabs?
It's like being kicked and beaten and then some passerby says "lol, it's your fault".
I'm not having a good time sitting here anxious and then seeing people blame my country that's under fire.
Hammas definitely have been planning this. They were just waiting for an excuse.
Our current government has a lot of right wing politicians, but the majority of citizens just wan to live a normal life.
Finally a good take.
You have no idea what it's like living here.
If you think Israel is to blame I'm just going to block you.
This is why.
You just made me imagine Musk making a movie starring his self insert and I hate it.
That's the biggest bullshit I ever heard.
No.
Look at his kid's name.
Money does weird shit to your head.
Thanks.
And just billionares in general.
Everyone forgets that Ethiopian Jews exist.
Thinking all Middle Eastern are brown is actually racist.
Real cringe.
People not knowing about the Babylonian Dispora and calling Jews white colonials is peak ignorance.
And obviously Ashkenazi Jews are Jews.
Barzilai is an Iraqi name.
It reminds me of a tweet I saw calling Neta Barzilai a white girl.
Do people know half of the Jewish Israeli population is from the Middle East and north Africa?
NOO
So many soldiers died last time.
God, no. Not again.
I call it burst because it's a number of missiles at once.
Had a burst a couple hours ago, but not as bad as yesterday.
The Palestinians can have their state, just leave us the fuck alone.
TBF, the Likud used to be not as far right as it is today decades ago.
Of the US? LMAO, checks out for a Likud supporter.
Coward.
She can just do national service like I did.
The thing is, even if (when) it ends in ceasefire, it's gonna happen again in like a year or two.
What is happening to this country?
An Israeli family accidentally entered an Arabic village on their way and got lynched.
You think I want people to die? What else is there to do?
Because you can't reason with a terrorist organization.
Than please tell me how would you stop Hammas from bombing the entire country?
If your country was in the same situation, what would it do?
It's the same thing.
When your family is in danger you will fight to protect them.
You don't understand.
You never experienced war in your lives, and it shows.
If they aren't stopped they  will continue to attack our civilians.
They hide among civilians and children. I just told you that. They do that on purpose.
It's not responding to warcrimes with warcrimes, it's trying to kill terrorist official.
How fucking dare you comparing the IDF to a fucking terrorist organization whose sole purpose is to murder Israelis?
I'm sure if we just ask Hammas nicely they'd stop shooting.
A brilliant plan!
So what? We just sit there and let them bomb the entire country?
The IDF isn't.
That's not what I said. Hammas is actively trying to kill civilians.
You can't because he's dead.
Tell that to the 5 years old boy who got impaled by a missile shrapnel.
How do you know that? are you a mind reader?
I didn't say it's not bad, but it's worded like they do this on purpose.
What are you even talking about?
The IDF isn't trying to kill children, Hammas operators are hiding among civilians and build weaponry construction sites in civilian buildings.
The IDF never intended to enter Gaza.
Also, turns out the the land force thing was trick.
Because nothing else would make them stop.
The IDF is trying to kill Hammas officials.
Yes.
If we could kill only Hammas officials without harming civilians we would. But it's not physically possible.
If someone is going to punch you you punch them first.
Oh my god, you really have no idea how war actually works!
It's not a revenge. It's killing Hammas officials and destroying their facilities
I don't want people to die. I don't want people to get hurt. But I'm realistic and I know that if we do nothing, our civilians will die.
Because I fucking hate hearing about Palastinians civilians dying.
Serious fucking question. If you have a solution without bloodshed I'd love to use it.
THEN. WHAT. ARE YOU. ADVISING. WE SHOULD. DO.
Was the US ever bombed by more than 1000 missiles in two days?
Because you're equating  a terrorist organization that is currently bombing us to our military.
I hate our current right wing government, but the IDF, while not  perfect as I said, it's still a military, has much better head in it.
Case in point.
You don't actually know what it's like to be inside this conflict and make assumptions.
You're basically saying that it's our fault.
I'm not saying that the IDF is some cinnamon roll, but acting as if we're intentionally trying to kill civilians or that we don't want to end this peacefully is pissing me off.
Hammas exist for one purpose only: to destroy Israel.
You can't make a peace offering with them.
We aren't fighting a militarily of a state, it's a terrorist organization.
OUR PEOPLE ARE DYING TOO.
And doing nothing would get more of our civilians killed.
Lol what? You think there's a magic solution?
You can't just converse war away.
I don't think you all understand how war actually works.
What do you expect me to do? Say it's horrible that the IDF is trying to stop the bombing?
Every. Fucking. Time.
Every time there's a "ceasefire" they just gather more money to make more weapons.
You can't fucking negotiate with them because they only want us dead.
All the Kattari money goes to bombs.
I can't hear Bibi's voice anymore. Just fucking go home already. You destroyed our country enough.
Messiahnic nutjobs.
Oh, the illegal settlements are ruining everything.
And they constantly talk about jihad and destroying Israel.
Hammas is the one controlling Palestine now.
I hope none of the couch professional will ever have to learn how complicated the reality of war truly is.
WHEN SOMEONE IS ATTACKING YOUR FAMILY, ARE YOU WORRIED ABOUT YOUR FAMILY OR THE ATTACKER?!
They actually did.
I want two states for two people, but it's not possible in the current reality.
I don't fucking want this.
Matt is basically saying "don't shoot at the guy trying to shoot you", forgetting that you'd probably get shot yourself that way.
So the fact that the IDF didn't do so before Israel was attacked means...
But to destroy these facilities means destroying the civilian buildings above them.
But then again, it's our fault even if we don't act first, apparently.
Because if we attack first then it would be our fault.
So good and peaceful night (hopefully).
Well, it's late and I should probably try to sleep after being awake for a couple days.
The entire world is radicalizing.
And the US elected Trump, and the UK elected Jones and the Palestinians elected Hammas.
Which we already kinda do with the towns around Gaza.
People already died even with the Iron Dome destroying 90% of the missiles, we cannot take the chance.
The problem is that we don't have a peaceful solution because we don't have a negotiation partner.
I will admit my knowledge of military vehicles is very limited, so I'll take your words on it.
Ah, so they fixed them probably.
I mean dangerous to pilot.
They aren't? It's just what I heard.
(All My Sons flashback)
They planes that are dangerous to use because they're shit.
Oh yeah, Israel bought ridiculously expansive planes from the US.
Hammas doesn't give warning when they bomb Israeli cities.
It just came into my knowledge that there was a Hammas bunker underneath the building.
This is also the seventh day Gaza have been bombing Israel.
Just saw on TV there's a huge protest in Britain against Israel.
I don't want to hear lectures about human rights from the TERF isles.
Priorities.
How about they sanction China who actually commits serious crimes against humanity?
Sanction a country for protecting itself. They really want us to just lie down and die.
That's why I quit twitter. So toxic.
At like 2AM, but still.
I actually managed to sleep yesterday.
There are no slurs or accusations of supporting genocide here, so it's already better than twitter.
And those living in Sderot have 13 seconds!
AN HOUR?! The sirens barely give us a minute to run to a shelter!
I never heard of an army doing anything similar.
Not saint, but not monsters who likes murdering children.
We don't get warning from Hammas.
Fucking painting Israel as the baddies when we send them a fucking warning before bombing an empty building while only have our own sirens to save us.
There's hardly any reception here.
Bombing in most of the country.
I'll try, if there's reception in the shelter.
Hammas planning to bomb Tel Aviv at midnight, gotta be careful since it's close to my town.
There are enough right wingers for it to be a problem for them.
They're afraid people in Israel won't use their service.
It's to save their ass from backlash.
The outcome is positive, but don't delude yourself in to thinking corporations care about people.
They just do this to look good. They don't actually care.
Because it's IGN.
This is peak virtue signaling.
I just flinched when I heard a car in the street because for a milisecond it sounded like the beginning of a siren. Yikes.
Kat ascended beyond humanity.
You might be right.
I'm sorry if I sound antagonistic, I'm very stressed.
I quit twitter for a reason.
I don't read news tweets because the comments are... well you can guess.
Excuse me for being paranoid.
Kind of makes it seem one sided.
Interesting you never post news on Israeli victims.
ü´Ç
My stomach hurt. I don't know if it's anxiety or a cold though.
Bibi was supposed to inform Biden about it, but he was being salty because Trump was replaced and didn't inform him.
Have you ever seen such ignorance of the situation?
https://twitter.com/im_snif/status/1394396449941696512
It's under the control of Hammas.
It's not Palestine, It's Hammas. The Palestinian PM is completely powerless.
I don't think it's comparable, but whatever.
Bombing Israeli civilians and hiding military facilities under civilian buildings apparently does not count as war crimes.
OH NO, It's directed at Bibi's tweet.
You ruined this country.
I'm sick of seeing his face. I'm sick of hearing his voice.
Shut the fuck up.
The US had one 9/11. Israel had many.
DO YOU ANY IDEA WHAT IT WAS LIKE IN THE 90s?!
You mean bombs in buses? You mean bombs in kindergartens? You mean sneaking across the border to stab people? Is that the peaceful coexistence you speak of?
WHAT PEACEFUL COEXISTENCE?!
This is a blunt lie, Hammas has been using money from Qatar and Iran and money intended for building the Palestinian infrastructure into these rockets.
While Israel has been treating the Palestinians badly, I don't think they're completely innocent in the conflict.
Investigate the IDF but not Hammas? Okay.
You only see one side of the conflict, you don't know what's it like on the Israeli side.
So that means we're supposed to just lie down and let ourselves be bombed?
Well now you know people in Israel too, and you know our situation is hardly better. And even that is only thanks to the Iron Dome.
If you think we're okay with Palestinians civilians dying, you're wrong. But we don't have a solution.
And Hammas bombing Israeli civilians with the explicit intent to kill is okay apparently.
Hammas doesn't have separate military facilities like a normal country. They hide their facilities under civilian buildings.
"It's okay if you're attacked, but don't you dare attack back".
"The underdog is always right" is a fiction trope, not reality. It's natural for a terrorist organization to be weaker then a state military.
(In hopes it actually goes to the right places)
Maybe donate to the Palestinian charity instead of arguing with people on the internet if you want to actually help.
Being ignorant isn't being objective.
We have the Iron Dome.
Comparing a military to a terrorist organization is comparing apples to rocks.
But comparing it to Hammas is bullshit.
This is honestly the worst government Israel had ever had.
Bibi is a snake that will sell his mother's soul to keep in his sit.
Where'd they get it?
Wait, I want that olive bomber jacket.
Sasuga TERF island.
Thank god.
How is this country fuctioning?
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
So she thinks I'm angry because I care about human rights and my strong sense of justice, which isn't wrong, but it's far more personal than that.
Worst is I can't even talk about this with my mom cause I'm not ready to come out.
I just saw the pride flags today in the city and thought "fuck yeah," and then I heard this shit on the news.
It literally only exists to dethrone Bibi.
And as far as I'm aware gay marriage from overseas count, so you can marry in Capris.
You can still register as life partners if you marry without the orthodoxy, which is what the majority of young couples do now days.
It's because when the state was just formed the orthodox Jews asked the first prime minister to be responsible for matrimony affair because they "were worried about I the Jewish state losing it's touch with religion" and the PM was basically went "what could go wrong? " and that's why a religous minority dictates for the secular majority.
Yeah it is.
TO BE FAIR, straight marriage without an orthodox rabbi also doesn't legally count.
But we still don't have same sex marriage.
Israel isn't Iran, being gay is perfectly legal and discrimination based on sexual oriantation or gender identity is very much a crime.
One of the members of one of the right wing parties is openly gay, yet the fact he can't legally marry his boyfriend because of the same people he works with seem to elude him.
"We accept and love the gays, but we won't bother helping you or anything. "
Most people have more higher pioroties than LGBT rights. Go figure.
Israel isn't a terrible place to be gay at, but you pretty much have very little presence.
For context, the more left-leaning parties were trying to pass pro-LGBT laws.
So no more rights this year, I guess.
Those values are homophobia, I guess.
He said they can join together with the Orthodox Jewish party because they "share similar values".
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
The head of the Arab party only agreed to join the coalition if the goverment doesn't pass any pro-LGBT regislations. On the month of June.
They changed it after the backlash.
Wait, I think it was channel 13, not 2. üòÖ
Asos and some others.
Channel 2.
So I don't have a source.
I just saw it on the the TV news.
And several of them?
Don't fucking kid me.
It wasn't a mistake.
Not added, replaced.
Just saw on the news that several international shopping site replaced Israel with Palestine.

Like, I hate Bibi as much as the next guy, but it feels like everyone is completely content sacrificing the gays for the coalition.
They won't, but it still stings.
An agreeable sacrifice.
My mom just read in the newspaper how "the new coalition is serious" and actually wants to do stuff and got happy, but I just feel bitter and expandable.
Remember I told how the new coalition basically sold the opportunity for more pro LGBT+ laws to get the fundamentalist Muslim Arab party in?
Let's be real, any and all organizations can be corrupt. This risk is a part of human society
Just saying.
Hmm, historically, it's not a good idea to give the military too much power.
Isn't that just local police?
Having an outside force doing the investigation is basic shit, what the hell.
This is a serious question, I want to know.
Than what do you suggest?
I disagree that the police doesn't exist to protect. By that same logic, governments existed to make money and and exploit citizens, but we don't let that fly anymore.
From the perspective of an outsider it looks less like a "police problem" and more of an institutional racism as a whole.
I'll just say that the police in the US is based on the values of the country at the time and do not necessarily reflect police in other countries.
Today I saw someone comment "if only they didn't have that pesky Iron Dome" and remembered why I quit twitter.
That kid need to be trained.
A lot of people treat animals like they're not actually thinking, feeling creatures.
Labels are a personal choice.
I get that for some people it's a good label, but it feels like I'm being forcefully shoved into it too.
I totally understand you, Lily. I'm also extremely uncomfortable with the word and don't want to identify under it, and it bothers me how it's slowly replacing the term LGBT+.
My brother is officially a homophobe.
We went to a con in Tel Aviv that just so happen to be at the same time as the pride event, because surprise, there's a huge overlap between the communities, and my brother just spilled the entire homophobic rhetoric on us.
"They're not normal, why do they need flags? it's indecent" all the shabang.
It's not personal, I've been in many fandoms and seen them devolve into cults of righteousness.
The point is, I longer feel comfortable in this server.
People who think fiction is the same as reality and if you like anything "problematic" in fiction you support in real life.
Seriously contemplating leaving this server. It's just full of antis.
Though I'm once again questioning the decision to make the antifa colors red and black.
That's a relief.
<#336297840529899522>
I read different numbers from different sources.
I think we should wait for the clean up to finish to get accurate numbers.

Hi, fellow sufferer.
u shittin me?

The other characters were 100% more interesting than Generic Dude and Wife Sister.
The characters barely moving didn't help.
OOF
<:CarolShock:430939013235474432>
It's from the LN.
YOU CAN'T MAKE THIS SHIT UP!
Mahouka straight up said that people fighting for equality are actually trying to destroy Japan for foreign forces.
So yeah, my problem with isekai is bigger than "it sucks".
So is this meme.
Couldn't get into it the way I did with Kemono Friends.
I didn't like Kemurikusa that much.
Lets hope they keep it.
Wow, Granblem was actually good for a change.
Understandable.
Urobuchi wasn't alone on Madoka, thouh.
They're tsundere for the sake of being tsundere instead of being a part of character development.
The problem is that tsunderes are usually used to pander as a character archetype instead of an actual character.'
10% of tsunderes are actually good.
And BHA, but I need to watch the third season.
The only things I' interested in are the Strike Witches movie and Black Fox.
Hopefully we get a second movie.
A movie with sequel bait.
It has similar atmosphere to Symphogear, so if you want something to feel that gap I'd recommend it.
It's good.
Watched Black Fox.
She is?!
A seiyuu.
Bad taste.
No Flip Flappers?
Yes.
Wait, which one is the subs? I'm confused.
Where can I get the commentary?
Not a good sign.
TBW I don't remember anything from Reflection.
Watch Black Fox.
You can connect the dots there.
I fucking hate Touma.
I love Misaka Mikoto.
Since you were talking about Railgun. Boy do I have feelings about it. Angry, angry feelings.
Touma is a generic Ln protagonist made to be projected to.
Normally she's a cool and kinda dorky, but when Touma is around suddenly she turns into a tusndere and becomes a useless little girl who needs the white knight to save her.
And get me started about the waifuing of Misaka.
These are the only characters I actually like.
Anyway, I want to yank the Railgun gang out of this franchise because they deserve better.
For me it's unforgivable.
He wasn't manipulated, wasn't forced, he enjoyed it.
He was fucking enjoying torturing and murdering.
That's the one character you can't fucking redeem.
Oh yeah, I also hate Accelerator for obvious reason.
Or is that not allowed.
Can I at least vent about the damsel in distress thing?
*She
And?
Because he embodies everything I hate about this kinda shitty tropes.
You want to know why I hate Touma?
Because HE appeared.
I know why.
Wait,
God, S was so good, why did it have to go to shit.
When she isn't getting shafted.
Anyway, Misaka is 1000% more interesting and rounded.
That's the kind of shit OPM is making fun of.
AND SHE DIDN'T ACT LIKE THAT!
BUT SHE ALREADY FOUGHT FOR HER LIFE IN THE SAME SEASON!
It felt insulting.
She can take one punch to the face.
Bullshit.
SHE FOUGHT PEOPLE WHO CAN SHOOT LASER AND SHE"S SCARED OF ONE PUNCH?!
The thing that broke the camel's back was when Touma is about to punch Misaka she cOWERS LIKE A LITTLE GIRL.
But then, Touma comes and none of her that matters. She tried and fought so hard and in the end it's all up to the big strong guy.
Like, if I like Misaka in Railgun 1 I fell in love with her in S.
It's so fucking good.
Like, the person who's used to excelling if she just try enough gets stuck in a situation she can't beat, feeling responsible because it's "all her fault", her in ability ask for help.
Okay. So in the Railgun adaption of the Sisters arc Misaka has an amazing character arc.
And unlike manga, LN translations are not very common unless it's something very popular.
Jokes on you, the only LNs in the comic stores in my country are SAO and Shield Hero. <:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
If I can find it.
I wanna read Kubikiri Circle.
Can we go back to the Boogie Pop days?
I don't like LN because most of them are.. like that.
Art is supposed to make you feel things.
I don't care. I'm done with this franchise.
Turning strong women into harmless waifus.
Why is Misaka turning into a babbling tsunedere when she sees Touma? Because that's the fantasy.
Let's be honest, it's a power fantasy. And Misaka, like all the characters in Touma's harem exist to be waifus.
Yes it was!
I.
Kawakami?
If you like Flying Witch and Hakumei to Mikochi you'd like Honzuki.

God, I want to read Honzuki. I love the anime.
Fushigi Yuugi wants to have a word with you.

Watch Honzuki, it good.
The only thing I'm watching is Honzuki.
Another Ikuhara anime. This time about gay kappa boys.

It's also good. I just jived with YKA more.
Promare in theaters in Israel never.
I'm jelly.

A very good boy indeed!
Which best boy?
Honzuki good.
It's a bit lacking in animation.
It's on J novel, I can just buy it.
But I'm gonna wait till I finish the second part.
I wanna read the LN.
Oh, that's much better.

Kokoro is weird, but not stupid.
HHW aren't *that* dumb.
I mean, I always assumed they were just pretending.
I first thought she just had lots of wigs, but from the back it seems it really is her hair.
Especially with those stripes.
How the fuck does she dye her hair so fast?
Yeah, about that.
I can't think of anyone else it could be.
Is that Pareo?
Bandori season 3 is off to a strong start.
Yeah, I get that pink is the protagonist color in magical girl anime, but they should have made her more unique from Madoka.
*pacapacapacapaca*

That's no illegal.

Looks pretty despairing to me.

YOU DOING THIS ON PURPOSE
FROM EP 1 JFDFGHuDGJHFGH
Watch season 3.
Then'
Otherwise you'd be wondering who's that annoying gremlin and her multi color haired maid.
Yeah, you need to watch season 2 first.
Just torrent like everyone does. <:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
Who told you to start from ep 5??
Watch from ep 1 season 1.
??? You shouldn't.
Bandori season 3 is really fun.
I can't help but be confused. Why is his power called HYsteria?
Hmm <:HibikiWhat:336656482907193344>
Wait, Hysteria?
The track record isn't good.
I doubt it.
Revue Starlight: Depression Edition.

so all the gay stuff.
Just fucking watch it. It's good.

Flip Flappers is the problematic fave.

Wow, the male ranking is bad.
Looks fake.
Me watching the Soul Society arc: these characters are so interesting! I can't wait for them to get more focus!
When he ran out of ideas and started throwing new characters.
The first two arcs were great, it only started sucking with the Hueco Mundo arc.
Burn the Witch sucked though.
üåª
How do you create a game this unbalanced?
The devs are a joke.
Sally needs more screen time. Preferably interacting with Maple.
Turns out the secret to good isekai/LN is a girl protagonist.
Dumb show and even dumber MC.
That Magia finale was rad.

As much as I love Misaka, Kanamori deserves that first place.

Don't worry, she knows how to swim.
Damn, Honzuki is getting dark.
Don't forget the true killer of tension - the cancel cheat code.
I describe Arai's performance of Kuroko as "loli grandma".
But I don't want to start an argument.
I'm turned off from index and anymore Railgun because of a different character.
I think she's a great character - when she isn't used for psycho lesbian jokes.
I unironically love Kuroko.
The worst part of PreCure being delayed is that it's exactly the kind of anime children need right now.
No! He's too cute!
He's also cute.
He did.

So BL is more popular in gay women circles.
The thing is most Sapphic women prefer BL over yuri, for some reason I honestly can't relate to.
As a yuri connoisseur, I follow yuri news and new titles.
Continuing the discussion, yes, there's a big resurgence of yuri made by women.
It made me interested in shipping het again.
Her torso is too short.

This is official subs.
It's true though.

And I already have a problem with starting too many books and taking years to finish them.
I'm not into Fate/ enough to dedicate so much time for it.
I'm going to watch it because I am not playing a VN longer than the bible.
It will make you cry.
Highway Blossoms is really fucking good.
Then don't play Love Ribbon either.
It may bother you.
Uh, yeah.
Eternal Senia. It's a free RPG Maker game.
There's a reason most of my games are VNs, I suck.

Wrong channel.
Ah, yes, the manga that gave me depression.
The hot butch sister.
||That one is canon.||
<@!195044406343106560> You fucking got it!!
Well, that and the gay bits in 3.0.
So yeah, I only really like 2.0.
It was the first time I watched Eva and though" I actually like these characters and want them to be happy".
3.0 was like a bad fanfic.
Rebuild 2.0 is the only Eva thing I actually love.
The entire fucking point of tsundere is someone who has hard time to open up to others and be vulnerable learning to trust others and not be afraid from positive emotions.
Chris and Arisa Bandori are the best tsunderes, don't @ me.
Add Akira to that.
Bad taste for not choosing them though.
Phos doesn't even know what gender or sex are.
Did I mention Myne is voiced by Iguchi?
Watch Honzuki.
Is it bad?
Seekly Shonen Jump.
Best ending.
Yeah, I don't know how to explain to people that hating men for being men is not woke.
Oh, I didn't know it was misandric. That's kinda dampen my enthusiasm.
I read the first chapter volume of Sexiled on Jnovel. I need to buy it.
And doesn't try to be any more than that.
It's cute and funny.
GGO, Honzuki, Bofuri, Hamefura.
All the good LN adaptions I've seen had a girl MC.
I'm talking about this one. https://myanimelist.net/anime/36475/Sword_Art_Online_Alternative__Gun_Gale_Online?q=gale
(Proving once again that having a girl MC is the first step in making a good LN).
SAO was worth it for GGO.
I watched Kampfer because I was a baby gay and was desperate.
What make Rental Girlfriend so bad? I can't help but be curios.
That's not funny.
No dead animals please.
WHAT??
I know.
~~This is why GGO is the best.~~
<:ShirabeWeep:701475635025019000>
Regarding Deca-Dence: ||it feels like two completely different incompatible anime got forcibly mashed together. Personally, I'd be perfectly content if the anime was only about Natsume and her story without all the AI game bullshit.||
Deca-Dence is the only seasonal anime I'm watching.
This season is very dry, for obvious reasons.
~~Please let it be explicitly gay this time~~
CBT.
As a big Misaka fan, I feel you, Lank.
Latest drama I had the misfortune to see is if you headcanon the characters as anything but lesbians (bi, for example) you're homophobic.
Not you. I'm talking about antis.
*sigh* I love Love Live. Too bad the fandom is terrible.
Welcome to antis.
"Blah blah blah lolis are pedophilic"
Or maybe my expectations were just too high.
It was disappointing, IMO, even disregarding the massive bait at the end.
Don't say I didn't warn you.
Watch Yuuki Yuuna Is a Hero.
Day Break Illusion was shit.
"Sya" is a different way to romanize "sha".
I immediately realized Cyaron is pronounced "sharon". ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
It's so good.
||She thought she already gave up on everyone but Madoka and killed her emotions, but her barrier manifesting from her subconscious desires proved her wrong.||
||But Homura doesn't care only about Madoka. The entire point of the first act of the movie is Homura realizing that she does love her friends and want them to be happy.||
I've seen a lot of bad takes.
Most people seem to think Madoka is a perfect uwu baby who can do no wrong and Homura is an evil obsessive yandere.
They're both dumb kids who hurt each other because they love each other.
Scalding hot take.
||What Homura did to Madoka in Rebellion is no different from what Madoka did to Homura in ep 12.||
I'm too tired to rant, but it's dumb.
I see shitty takes on Rebellion again. <:MariaNo:672658725986762764>
I want that mask.
I've been spoiled by greatness.
Machikado Mazoku is too good, no other 4koma can compare.
Play Arknights.
Err, Kobayashi-san's Dragon Maid?
Is this the guy from Mahouka?
||Momo's scarred abs.||
It's like the complete opposite of the kind of themes I like.
I fucking hate the themes.
I regret watching that anime with the frustration it brought me.
Don't get me started on Granblem.
Seem to be working now.
IT'S CONFIRMED! <:MikuHype:688429715676987428>
https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2020-08-27/the-demon-girl-next-door-anime-listed-with-2nd-season/.163341
And I'll never forgive what she did to BRS.
I can't stand Okada's writing.
https://twitter.com/minakatasunao/status/1300764423892557825
Should I watch the first anime or just wait for the remake
Same, I rather just manga than BDs.
Season 2 soon.
Hameru.
Can't be, she's homophobic.
She's doing one currently.
What a ride.
God, I remember when Madoka just came out and the speculation on AnimeSuki forums.
Symphogear 2012.
Madoka was 2011
And what made me fall in love with her.
That's Aoi Yuuki first major role.
Without knowing the lore of Madoka.
It's probably super confusing.
Watching MagiReco first is a bad choice.
Because it's good.
That's just my watch order.
Magia Record is a spin off.
The first two movies are recaps and the third movie is the sequel.
It's emotionally draining, but in a good way.
I always prefer watching things in the original language, since it's directed by the original director and is closer to what they wanted to convey.
Yeah, episode 10 had me shook.
Mok.
It means tackling dark subjects.
Dark doesn't mean depressing. <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Maybe it just wasn't dark for Solo's standards.
Have we watched the same Nanoha?!
So much of a success nobody remembers it was a spin off of an eroge.
I've seen Madoka clones. Symphogear ain't it.
Madoka wasn't the first dark magical girl show.
||It was stated it was the Magiawhatever's will to break the cycle and Shingetsu was "chosen" by magic to do so. Mangetsu was created to enable her to break the cycle.||
I disagree.
||Just sacrifice your entire existence because the Magiwhatever said so. I fucking hate it.||
||Because everyone did exactly what they were fated to do and fulfilling their roles like good little children. It's sickening.||
I hate the ending. I hate the themes. That anime feels like it was made to spite me.
Granblem is not good. Granblem is trash and I hate it.
> Obscure
> Umineko
||He's a chicken! A giant chicken!||
<:MariaYell:336657352264646657>
||She had self-loathing since before she even met Madoka. Remember she almost got eaten by a witch in the first timeline.||
||The Clara dolls throw tomatoes at her because she's full of self-loathing and thinks she's the worst human being ever born. ||
Homura basically scarified her own happiness (being reunited with Madoka forever) for everyone else's happiness.
I'm big hype.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r37i6fuajt4
I think I watched 1 episode years ago and was so bored I remember nothing from it.
<:MariaNo:672658725986762764>
I haven't written in Hebrew in so long I forgot how to spell some words, lol.
<:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970> Can we get something else beside SAO and isekai?
The difference is that OPM is a comedy.
MCs that are super strong and competent are boring. I want to see someone struggles from the bottom.
Big agree.
Please no, I'm hungry for yuri.
Mappa doesn't have one aesthetic?
Those comments sound homophobic.
I expected ToG to suck, but besides the first two episodes that were boring, it was great.
I dropped it, too much melodrama for me.
Read the first volume of Urasekai Picnic LN when it was free on J-Novel. Good stuff.
That looks like the most generic 2000 anime.
||Amanchu is even worse.||
The big yuribait.
So he Trojan Horse'd them.
Akamatsu wanted to make an action battle series, but the editors wanted him to make another harem like Love Hina.
I read it for the action, cool magic world and the shota MC.
The only harem I tolerate is Negima, and even then I hated the harem parts.
Make that edit.
I hate the premise. <:TsubasaDisgust:349013662775902209>
Wait, what goes to shit?
I need to watch the third season, but I'm afraid to dislike something I used to love. <:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
Same. It was mindblowing when I was a wee child, but in retrospect it has a lot of cliches I grew to hate.
Can you tell I was a 2000s kid?
I watched Shakugan no Shana the same way.
I still have a soft spot for it, even if it wasn't the greatest.
On youtube in 3 parts per episode, lol.
It was the first real yuri anime I've ever watched.
Fuck subtext. All my homies hate subtext.
What are the chances Assault Lily is gonna be more than yuribait?
Symphogear is much, much better.
The more I hear about the Index LNs the less I like it.
Only Six Faces syndrome has plagued many great artists.
That's just his artstyle. <:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
Fairy Tail ended, this is the newest manga by the author.
I really enjoyed the first episode of Majo no tabitabi.
All anime that isn't Symphogear.
Welp, looks like I'm pirating. <:KirikaCry:674720015047720961>
> Funi
Theresa??
What year is Njisaki taking place in? The school is totally from the future.
Don't kinkshame. <:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
You guys have no taste.
~~coughcoughHxH~~
~~CoughcoucghFMA~~
~~coughcoughJoJocoughcough~~
I just avoid these kind of anime because I can't stand them.
I think the things you seek in anime and I seek are completely different.
I've yet to see this kind of power for an MC used well.
That's not interesting.
It's too powerful.
Super boring for a MC.
It's like a cheat code.
Unless the character identifies as a girl it's not yuri.
Biggest /s
But if you don't say it's genderbend isekai people might think it's gay. <:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
<:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
Adachi to Shimamura is licensed by Funi so I can't support it legally.  <:KirikaCry:674720015047720961>
Smug.
Kasumi's faces are golden.
Oh, it's the girl who sang the OP for Happy Sugar Life. No wonder I like it.
I've only watched the first episode, so no ED.
Why did no one tell Sigurui's OP was such a banger?
Just read the manga.
Citrus is fucking great, but the anime was meh.
Unless fantasizing about kissing your friend is a common  thing for straight girls.
Adashima is 100% yuri tough.
I'm waiting on Lily to see if they gonna go through it or just bait.
Adashima is gay.
Very enjoyable.
It's less actioney than I expected, but the humor has a strong 2000 Shaft anime charm.
Bookworm.
Read the novel.
Me watching Adashima
<:YumiPanic:688429717174354012>
It counts as a magical girl in my book.
I had a huge crush on Kohaku as child, lol.
HYPE
Mecha? In MY CLAMP?
<:TsubasaPeek:623246193002151938>
Watching four episodes of Sigururi in a row was very emotionally taxing. I cried several times.
Make it canon ~~so Misaka can be with Kuroko~~.
<:TsubasaDisgust:349013662775902209>
Are you saying idols are lame?
And the characters are great.
It's a very fun series.
It is! <:KirikaPog:605209108827734017>
Which anime?
It's not SW without the nipples.
Real question though, does it has nipples?
I heard Trude has an 8 pack. That Trude is shredded.
I still need to watch the new SW.
Sigururi is a total dark horse.
I fucking love Sunshine, lol.
My favorite was the Rina episode.
It's not bad by any means, just not as good.
I find Nijigasaki pretty boring compared to the first two.
Really?
And the Mormonism.
||Isn't that the plot twist from Ender's Game?||
What the fuck is even is this?
MachiMazo best kirara manga, don't @ me.
Nijigasaki is gay. AyuYuu is gay.
It was so good and than they just made it stupid.
3.0 is trash.
I loved 2.0. It made me actually enjoy Eva.
||We need a "Does The Dog Dies" but for gay characters.||
You watched the first season and came for more?
I don't have anything smart to say, I just love her character.
Misaka hot.
üáΩ
I want to reiterate I only put so much thought into this because I really enjoyed this anime and think it's good. I wouldn't give a shit otherwise.
||I imagine Sonoko is only holding herself together by pretending to be fine, and as soon as crisis is truly over she's just going to collapse.||
||I really hate when anime does the "grieving character gets one pep talk and is immediately fine" bullshit. Sonoko lost two fucking sisters, and the blue haired girl lost her partner. Their feelings deserve some respect.||
||But seriously, I feel I need an emotional closure that I didn't get. I hoped we'd at least see the faces of the fallen Valkiryes, but nope, for all we know these planes were empty and flying by magic.||
||And I'm really worried about Sonoko, no one gets over loss so quickly. I fear she'd need some serious therapy after this. Well they all do.||
||I feel the ending really lacked closure, and the happy moments were too happy considering the devastating events.||
Finished Sigururi.
I love both.
Welcome to Hello Happy World, leave your sanity at the entrance.
Was this the one where Michlle is Iron Man?
D4DJ but they make anime mashups instead.
Kokoro isn't human.
SayoHina is bae, though.
Antis made me hate SayoTsugu.
Arisa (second) best tsundere.
Some kind of catharsis or emotional elation.
I think I understand what he means with Scenery Yuri. Seeing ruins or landscapes without human influence gives me the same feeeling as yuri.
Misaki stronk.
Moca is just high all the time.
All the speculation and theories on Animesuki forums...
I remember when it aired.
Relevancy is well, irrelevant.
I don't really care if something is "a classic for generations to come" or some shit, if the writing is good, then it's good.
There's plenty of grimdark magical girl anime, but Madoka is one of the few that actually good.
I disagree, I think it holds up great.
Rosalia made anime OPs and EDs.
üçé
So you've met best girl?
What episode are you on?
Only if you don't want to sleep.
I haven't forgiven her for BRS TV.
Everything written by Okada is a disaster.
No, there was no Sailor Moon or PreCure.
Up until then I thought all magical girl shows were lame, partially out of "Not Like Other Girls" bullshit and partially because the only good magical girl that the Israeli kids channel aired was CCS.
Honestly, Madoka was what got me into the magical girl genre.
Sooo glaad I was wrong.
Ironically I feared it was going to end up like Asuka .
The shock value was never the draw for me. Even when I watched it back in 2011 the novelty of "dark magical girl" was pretty lame for me.
She's a magical girl.
That's Homujra alright.
I just want to read some happy yuri, you know?
I just had it with tragedy up the wazoo.
I like my yuri without tragedy, thank you.
When you finish Rebellion we can discuss it! I love hearing other people interpretations.
I don't really blame him for being shitty, since the situation was shitty, but still.
Ozpin was being a dick though.
I actually really liked the latest season, even if I do have complains about some plot points.
They didn't scrap the plot and rewrote it or some shit.
They worked on the show together and had planned ahead.
I disagree about the characters being one-dimentional, at least the main four.
Also, not everything has to be a masterpiece. Sometimes it's okay for a show to just be entertaining.
Considering Rooster Teeth weren't a professional studio, RWBY is a pretty damn good creation.
It's detailed because it's just a texture.
I'm really not in the mood for sad endings.
Maybe I'll until it finishes before I watch it.
It's always good to have reassurance.
And at least I know the author of Urasekai Picnic isn't baiting.
Hey, it's not bad by any means, it's just not as good in anime as in text format.
It also feels like half of the story is lost without Sorao's inner rumblings.
Man, Urasekai feels much faster in anime form.
He kind of made fun of that in Sarazanmai with the Kawauso saying "I'm a metaphor".
Ikuhara's metaphors are really obvious and in your face. I think people just over-think them and assume they're supposed to be deeper than they actually are.
God, imagine if we got a movie adaption of the Nanoha CD drama instead of those forgettable ones. <:KirikaCry:674720015047720961>
I haven't read that far into the manga. Is it bad?
Do not remind me of that anime.
MAL scores are shit, don't listen to them.
The production isn't stellar, but it's good.
Watch Urasekai Picnic.
That's both hilarious and stupid.
I'm still on season 3, so I'm holding judgement.
FMA is.
I love BokuHero, but it's not the best shounen ever.
Male fantasy bias in general.
I give it a solid 7.
Like it had problems, but it was GOOD.
Sigururi only has 6.49, what bullshit.
It's scifi.
Again, romance is not the focus of the story.
AdaShima only has 7.26 so you can tell MAL users don't know a good show if it bit them.
If you read the novel, there is definitely something between Toriko and Sorao.
Urasekai IS yuri, it's just slowburn. and romance isn't the focus.
Deca Dence was good until it shat the bed on the last stretch.
With yuri on the side.
Because it's a fucking philosophical scifi story.
It's not gonna satisfy those who are into isekai, and the yuri is too slowburn for those who wanted girl-on-girl action.
I thin kUrasekai has a low score because it's not what people excepted it to be.
I hate the message.
Tough it was mostly tragedy. :/
Even farther with 70s stuff.
By women too.
Not true, yuri audience is about 50/50 men and women.
The boy is very cute.
Horimya looks like it'd be nice, I've been meaning to read the manga for a while now.
Finally.
It's less that the quality of yuri anime has gone up and more that we actually have a selection of yuri anime.
Very male gazey and I just can't relate.
Most romance anime are not for me.
I'm trying very hard not to make period jokes now.
Ina likes the manga.
Badly.
They really need women in their editorials.
Unfortunately current Shonen Jump is .. ah...
I love shounen.
Even if the ending of the remake and manga is more satisfying.
FMAB is a better show overall, but I loved the ending of the first.
I love both the first anime and the remake.
||Yes. So I really doubt they're gonna skip.||
||How the fuck are they gonna skip it? They show the sign in the OP.||
Why is the production on Urasekai so poor? It could have been amazing if it had an actual budget.
I'll give it a try.
Oh, it's the mangaka of Hanayamata!
Never heard of that before.
Ochikobore Fruit Tart?
That's why Machikado Mazoku is objectively the best Kirara manga ever. Period.
Yuri undertones is for cowards. Real men and women go the full gay route.
Good night.
Shit, I need to continue Gekkan Shoujo.
Hakumei and Mikochi are married. I will not hear otherwise.
Also me: *plays HI3*
Me: I really hate tragedies. I need something happy.
Yeah, I kinda need lift-me-ups right now.
I need to watch it, but it sounds emotionally taxing, so I'm saving it for later.
And do I smell a dash of "things for girls suck"?
Sounds like pointless rambling.
Don't bother, these people can't be reasoned with.
I heard a lot of bullshit about people who don't understand the "family" means fourth cousin.
*sigh* Is it about the "incest".
I loved Fruit Basket when I was younger. I don't know if it's because I'm older or because the pacing is very slow, but I find the remake pretty boring.
Damn Strawberry Panic, was not great.
Sometimes I'm like, why are men like this?
Man, those anime sure are not for me.
If it happens in the show it's not IRL.
THERE'S GONNA BE MEGALOBOX 2?!
<:TsubasaDisgust:349013662775902209>
Please let get an actual budget, unlike what they did for poor Urasekai.
YES!
Is it yuri?
So it's safe to watch.
Is Wonder Egg depressing?
It was linked just above it.
Need more muscle.
I delete episodes after I watch them.
I'd rather use MAL than download .
Read the novel.
I'm absolutely not surprised.
Eh? Why?
I was a fan since they made MLP videos. <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
In retrospect Digi's weird phase might have been them straggling with their identity..
I used to be a fan of Digi before the decent into madness.
~~Except Karen~~
She's best girls because she's 170cm and could bench press me, but she's also soft.
Is big.
Big Banana üçå
My favorites are Banana, Junna, and Mahiru.
But same.
I diagnose you with anxiety and/or depression.
Do it for her.

Hey, some of us like boys.
Karen worked so much better in the play than the anime.
I heard it's getting an anime too.
Kaos, but with height.
It's not necessarily a logical story.
It's more of a feel than think to me.
It's one of my fave anime of all time!
DID SOMEONE MENTION LAIN?! <:HibikiWow:738172615453048912>
Eva 4.0: Fury Road.
You mean the only good scene in the entire movie.
||Kaworu could have just NOT put the collar on.||
Don't remind. It was such bullshit forced drama.
Yeah.
When someone tells you not to push the big red button and you push the big red button, you're the one at fault.
||Unlike the end of 3.0, where he was fucking warned not to pull the spear and did it anyway. That's totally his fault.||
So it's kinda shitty blaming him.
But he had absolutely no way of knowing things would go that way.
I'm just pissed because the second movie was the first time I actually enjoyed Eva and liked the character and the third movie felt like bad fanfiction.
Fair enough.
WHY
Does anyone here actually like the third movie?
And he's a *fucking child*.
HYPE
Let 10 people watch it and they'll give 10 different interpretations.
Or m ore like, it has many components designed so anyone can interpret differently.
If there's no giant robot, it's not mecha.
??? No?
Very cultured.
And the "actor" is a women, she just like otokonoko, so her character is one.
Tamaki isn't part of Hololive, he's independent.
Isn't Franxx the baby propaganda anime?
Because you have a bad taste.
SECOND SEASON SOON
I feel like I'm in the minority, but I really liked season 2.
MachiMazo is the only demon anime I need.
Isn't there one coming soon?
||Isn't obvious just from their faces though?||
||Twincest is wincest after all.||
||I'm waiting for the twist that they are twins separated at birth.||
So you like dem steampunk lesbians?
Please let me replace my ugly face with an anime girl.
Vtubers. Vtubers everywhere.
ANYWAY
Hey, Carlos joked on it first.
Harassing people > not okay
Being uncomfortable > okay
It rhymes with hemophilia.
People already throw the P word around.
Too late.
It's funny they credited their twitter handles.
I know. I'm asking about WEP.
Then how did they end up helping?
Eh, really?
Something similar happened with RevStar. They asked for help with animation on Twitter.
Wanna see animated Haru.
If the rest of YagaKimi gets animated I hope they'd do an OVA of Sayaka's novels.
I'm sick of the industry beating around the bush
That's not what I meant.
Kinda sitting on TabiTabi because it's one oof after another.
I don't remember that. Maybe I haven't that far.
It's the same thing with Symphogear - we all know they're gay, but they'll never confirm it because *marketing*.
Tohru is the one one who is 100% confirmed attracted to women.
You fucking with me? You call that representation?
BITCH, WHERE?!
More than one.
Also, can we please, please have anime with confirmed LGBT+ characters' who's existence isn't suffering? Thanks
Looked in the tag and that looks like depression central, so definitely not the anime for me.
Why.
The entire payoff is different, and make much more sense with the theme.
They changed a lot from the play.
Madoka.
He seem to have very conservative views of women and LGBT and use them for shock value.
I according to what I heard the main writer has a very bad record of writing LGBT+.
Yeah, about that...
I'm so glad I hadn't watched WEP.
The failed Chosen One and the decent to darkness.
That's the best part.
The drama in the second half was right up my alley. I eat that shit up.
Not even love to hate her, I just plain love her.
I love her.
Croix best character.
Especially the latter half, which was amazing.
I think LWA TV is better than the OVAs.

Butches with red hair. <:MikuJoy:738234684655403110>
Which part - ||the bury your gay or the unfortunate antisemitic implications?||
And the more I learn about the new seasons the more I'm thankful for quieting when I did.
I quit AoT after the second season because I heard spoilers and I did not like them.
Attack on Titan Final Second Season.
Thank god.
Oh, they got it too.
The new season.
Pirating it is then.
Just discovered Funi has Zombieland.  <:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
The real horror was the production.
Use the translate button.
OH MY GOD.
As far I understand animators are usually "freeters" - meaning they don't belong to a company or organization.
Madoka's parents are legit the best parents I've ever seen in fiction.
Another hot, white haired Siegfried.
What's Vivy?

What's wrong with shounen?
Real mahou shoujo fans like all of them.
Power of Friendship.
Which is why I like both.
Magical girl and shouen have a lot of things in common.
One of the reasons I love Symphogear is that it's very shounen-like.
I love shounen manga.
It's not helping that most of them are dudebros.
Anitubers are 90% trash. Once in a blue moon you find a decent one.
What was the take?
Black Clover just feel so by the numbers and soulless to me.
KnY had to be rushed because of the author's family circemnts.
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
At least you can watch Funi anime legally.
But do buy things you like if you can.
Don't call my childhood trash.
And yet a certain mangaka who had done much worse had the anniversary of his manga celebrated.
Don't you ever compare Hibiki to that guy.
I like the designs.
I don't know if I should be hyped or scared.
Because of the hair?
Who the fuck is Deku supposed to be?
STOP WITH THE ISEKAI
Calliope Mori's channel.
Did he actually or is it a meme?
BNA felt like a less good version of Promare. Was pretty disappointed.
FranXX has a lot of traditionalist views. Gross.
I recognize the artist of the keychain!
People here probably never even heard of Promare.
I wish my country had anime in theaters.
I really like Makogori.
Oh. My ship sank.
Now that's a person of culture right there. <:CarolSmug:617040484111745027>
||Ironically I ship Ryuuko and Satsuki even though they are blood related because their relationship isn't sisterly.||
Personally, I don't ship Mako and Ryuuko because their relationship feels too sisterly to me.
It's mostly A1.
FranXX is barely a Trigger show.
Does that mean Abe commissioned Hugtto PreCure?
We've been waiting for this day...
Madoka AND YuYuYu?!
Now I imagine LL in Highschool Musical.
Oh, I hadn't thought of LL as a musical. Now the melodrama makes more sense.
They're made by the same person who made the OST for Houseki no Kuni.
The Love Live OSTs are amazing.
https://www.ebay.com/p/16030729064?iid=273779766204
And the little there is is undermined.
There's hardly gay in WEP.
But yeah, Negima is great.
I hate Rakan.
Maybe an Element Garden connection.
||Anyone who's caught up, does Kuromaru still want to be a girl to be with Touta or what?||
I think I'm going to watch the new PreCure.
Maybe Ed or Al from FMA?
Fave guy is hard.
...Is that Karl Marx?
You only have girls in your list?
KuroTomo is good.
Any character voiced by KuroTomo is good.
Not anime, but still.
Marisa.
Yes.
Same name as https://rei.animecharactersdatabase.com/uploads/chars/42711-1129984140.png
It's joke.
And voiced by Nana.
He already was hot.
<:CarolSmug:617040484111745027> <:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
Not bad, but I prefer between the girls.
I see two dudes, but I hope it's gay.
I love the character design.
It's real cringe.
In the JP, KR and CN fandoms SayoHina is the most popular ship but the Western fandom is full of morons who hate SayoHina.
Anime?
It's better wirtten.
If I want nipples I'd watch Strike Witches.
Is BRS magical girl? ü§î
Only thing I know about Madlax is the theme from Nico Nico Medley.
I think they're robots?
There are two maid sisters.
Well, one maid.
There are also purple haired maids in Nanoha and Shakugan no Shana.
Did someone say Lain? <:TsubasaNote:689554460044820608>
Why?
EH?!
Illya, Maria, Madoka, Yuuna, Momo, Sakura, Nodoka, Utena, Iroha and Snow White/Koyuki.
I know all of them.
Weak.
Oh no, it's Shem-ha.
A/Z is fucking trash.
At the first scene of the second season I laughed and just dropped it.
Aldnoa/Zero. Urobuchi wrote the first episode and the team he let handle the rest fucking blew it.
LL good.
Start with Futari wa PreCure.
THICC lines.
Oh, she's not the MC.
I'm talking about the PreCure season.
That's the one with the red head MC?
I think what happened in the first episode is more indicative of either Lain already having a detachment with reality or her having psychic powers. Or both.
But yeah, it's purposely vague.
I think roughly means the plot itself with the Knights conspiracy, which does make a lot more sense of the events of the anime.
There are some points I disagree about. I personally think Lain was originally a human.
ü¶â
Not for anime and books.
I think media in general should come with trigger warnings.
There should be.
Is there a Does The Dog Dies for anime and manga?
If you don't like the content, don't watch it. It's that simple.
Why do you say that? <:TsubasaNeutral:688429723205894149>
Because it's not real.
It's like saying you can't make stories with guns in them because it may trigger someone.
A lot of things can be triggering.
It doesn't hurt anyone.
It's anime characters, who cares.
When you're desperate for yuri anime, you'll settle for almost anything.
But lolis making out.
https://images.wagwalkingweb.com/media/articles/horse/ear-papillomas/ear-papillomas.jpg
Use references for your art, guys.
But people draw them too often like fox ears.
Horse ears have a different shape.
I heard it's sad though.
Maybe I should finish the anime, everyone is going mad over it.
I'm still surprised Jahy-sama got an anime.
TBF, while being absolute trash, Ermonga doesn't really have anything explicit.
Puritanism.
Censorship, the most noble of pursuits.
Prisma Illya isn't one of them.
But there's a fair share marketed to laymen.
Most of it, yeah.
TBF OVAs like these are marketed specifically to otaku.
I'd argue violence is more damaging to children than sexual content, but I wouldn't show a 12 years old sexual content anyway.
Then what the fuck?
Do they just give lower rating for cartoons in general?
That's not for 12 years old.
Lol, what?
Usually it's something movies and video games have.
And it's still a weird reading either way.
And the manga's title is not a name.
That's basic Japanese education.
No Japanese person would read it as Hanakoi.
Hanakoi is not a name. Karen is.
But it's pretty obvious it should be Karen and not Hanakoi.
Karen isn't exactly an obscure name.
When you add them together they have a different reading.
That's not how you translate kanji.
Jisho is great for learning kanji.
Also Kekkai Sensen.
Not really a shounen battle per se, but if you like battle shounen you'd most likely love it.
Watch Mob Psycho 100.
Oh no, this character is 17! Call the cartoon police!
I heard the characters become a parody of themselves and I rather keep my positive impression of the manga I love.
I don't like Cahinsaw Man. Too cynical and dark.
I need to read it.
Watch JoJo.
WE FORGOT JOJO
I loved Fairy Tail up to the point I stopped reading.
And I assume you already watched FMA and FMAB?
OBVIOUSLY, Hunter x Hunter.
EH? I love it.
Oh, that's because of all the GuP movies and OVAs.
I didn't know I even watched 19 sports anime.
Lol
OH
Yeah, I have no idea you get to that page.
How do you arrange them by genre?
I think my favorite arc is the Erza and the tower arc.
Man, I can't wait for Sakura to Gainax pose and shoot a huge laser.
It's because I'm desperate for yuri.
Pretty much.


<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
*pretends to be shocked*
Also there's hardly any yuri hentai.
I prefer hentai in manga. The moaning makes me uncomfortable.
I don't know which one to start with. I don't think I need to watch ALL of them.
I really need to watch Macross at some point.
I thought it was American production.
Was it anime though?
Some children anime from the 60s(?) a la Marco and Nils.
Butthurt losers.
I am not joking.
Don't read Houseki no Kuni, you *will* get depression.
I heard unflattering things about the writer's previous works that make me really not want to watch it.
Knowing how to regulate time is extremely important to any production.
Do you know why KyoAni anime look so good? Because the management is excellent.
Shitty management.
Damn, I really wanted to read that.
Read Boogiepop Phantom, the OG LN.
Plus, as a wlw, it's insulting.
I appreciate the positive portrayal of a trans character, but it's not enough to throw myself into that mess.
Everything I heard about WEP makes want to stay away from it.
From what I heard the writer has a bad track record with lesbian characters.
||Bernkastel is such a massive bitch she makes Lambda look like a decent person by comparison.||
||In Umineko.||
||I do support her.||
Sounds painful.
Hanyu exhibitionist confirmed.
Wear pants
No bully
I'm more concerned as to why she's commando.
YO!
> Even if It Was Just Once, I Regret It
I love her voice.
It was nice, but there weren't a lot of character interactions.
Watched the first Princess Principal movie.
Actual yuri magic babies.
I couldn't even finish the first episode.
Seriously, that face makes me want to punch the shit out of it.
It's like the make them more and more scummy .
The best anime.
It be like that.
The point is that Ragyou is an abusive bitch.
I just delete the files after I watch...
I love PriPri.
Because you don't want to get baited.
Skip Hibike to avoid the bait.
10/10 design.
The abs, the flaming hair, the crazy smile...
It sounds insane and right up my ally.
For research.
What's the manga called?
There's no "one true explanation" to Lain, you're supposed to make your own ideas on what happens and what it means.
I myself disagree with a number of points with the videos posted here.
Lain is best watched without any knowledge and you should make your interpretation rather than taking others' as gospel.
I mean I don't sit and try to figure out what each little thing mean.
See, that's one of the things that's so great about Lain, it's a different experience to different people.
I have my theory, of course, but to me whenever it's correct or not is less important than what I take from it.
And I didn't try to analyze everything, to me it's more about the themes and what the show is trying to say than really solving it.
I just couldn't stop.
I watched all of Lain in basically one sitting.
Trying to analyze every little thing like you're trying to solve a case is not helpful to your enjoyment and is not how art should be consumed.
The way I watch anime is feeling it first and thinking about it later.
Eizoken is a legendary anime. It really makes you feel like a kid again.
I'm hungry for PriPri content, there's no way I can wait.
WEP is straight up using LGBT+ characters for exploitation and has terrible gender politics.
I think they only kept it because they didn't want to cut out content.
Nah, it's fine.
More like trying to give it a an actual plot and themes.
I have a feeling the Kobayashi Dragon Maid anime took some liberties with the source material. Probably for the better.
2D animated mechas, they're really going all out.
The boys are really cute, too. Reminds me of 2000s anime.
Could it be that after a decade of mecha influencing magical girls, magical girls are influencing mecha?
I'm interested in the mascot companions.
Isn't Gate a JDF propaganda piece?
In case you were worried, Kobayashi's Maid Dragon season 2 is shaping to be as good as the first season.
<:KirikaShout:607741871703457812>
I want her to call me her little kitten.
Deep voice is automatically sexiest.
Strength is the only decent part, yeah.
She pretty much ruined everything I loved about it and massacred everyone's character.
I fell in love with the OVA and hate what Okada did to it with passion.
No, I have not forgiven Okada.
For a second I was excited, but then I saw "TV series".
Me: FUCK YOUUUUU
*licensed by Funimation*
Me: oh man, I can't wait to legally stream this new anime!
Shadow House is very good.
Boring.
GATE is just military propaganda.
That's why it's actually good.
I don't give a shit about SAO, I only like GGO Alt.
I have no interest in obvious wish fulfillment self-insert MCs.
I don't want to see Kirito suffer, I plain don't want to see him at all.
3. The characters are awesome.
2. It's got yuri
1. GGO Alt doesn't have Kirito
GGO Alt is the best thing to come out of SAO.
Can I watch the new Higurashi anime without watching the original? It's kind of hard to find.
They're so cute.
||Madoka straight up confessed that she doesn't want to leave her loved ones behind. Homura didn't "decide" for Madoka, Madoka really wasn't happy.||
||Madoka did the same thing against Homura's wishes too.||
||Neither of them is completely wrong or completely right, they both did something selfishly selfless out of love.||
||The thing is, that even though the ending of the TV anime is framed as positive and the ending of Rebellion is framed as negative MADOKA AND HOMURA DID THE EXACT SAME THING.||
||You're not wrong, but Homura isn't a bad person. Just very traumatized, self-hating and full of internal homophobia.||
||This is Homura's view, but it doesn't mean she's right.||
||Rebellion is told from Homura's point of view. *She's* the one who thinks her love is twisted and wrong, she's the one who thinks of herself as evil and selfish and undeserving of happiness.||
See, this is the thing, my interpretation of Rebellion is very different.
There are two types of people, those who hate Rebellion and those who love it. I'm in the latter.
You definitely shouldn't binge the TV anime and Rebellion together.
I agree with that.
I disagree. I see the movie as a direct sequel to the anime and I don't consider them conflicting.
||TLDR, my interpretation: two morons in love. They suck at communicating and have terrible self esteem. Shit happens as results.||
||I didn't say that.||
||They hurt each other because they love each other.||
||Because Madoka thought Homura would be happier in the world of the living. Because these girls are fucking stupid.||
||Who said Madoka doesn't want to be with her? ||
||Saying that Humra straight doesn't deserve to be happy is fucking wham.||
||Homura wants everyone else, especially Madoka to be happy, but doesn't think she deserves happiness herself.||
||And Homura doesn't think so. In fact, at the end of Rebellion Madoka is happy with her family and friends while Homura is alone.||
||I completely disagree. It's the same.||
||It's not a matter of owing. The point is that they did the same thing.||
||She just left Homura forever pining for a the person she loves that no one else remembers.||
||I mean at the end of the TV anime.||
||And I don't see how it's any different from Madoka deciding Homura would be happier without her and not taking her to the Law of Cycles with her.||
||There is absolutely no indication of that.||
||They both are being stupid because they want the other to be happy.||
I think the white lilies are supposed to contrast the red spider lilies, so it doesn't make sense that they symbolize the same thing.
White lilies symbolizes purity among other things.
For extra tears listen to the version sung by all the VAs.
The Tri version is tears worthy.
Amen to that.
Tamers' OP is my favorite.
Guys, I just finished Higurashi today, should I watch Kai already or wait?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Se-2l5A2wu4
Best Digimon was Tamers.
No goggles?
Then again, they could make another season after Sotsu if they really want to milk it.
Hopefully the sequel has a happy ending or I'm not interested.
Higurashi Kai was really good.
Blessed.
Why can't we have nice things?
https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/interest/2021-08-04/digimon-tamers-20th-anniversary-stage-show-features-cancel-culture-villain/.175872
No potato sprites. <:ElfneinPalm:672430572961923092>
I'm talking about now.
Who the fuck watches in 720?
Homura isn't a bad person, she's a human with human flaws, but not bad.
I'm reminded of all the morons who after Rebellion were like "Homura is evil now" because they lack basic comprehension and analysis skills.
It's still dangerous.
Don't talk about it or they gonna take it down.
At least CR is available.
Now you know my pain.
Does that mean I can stream Love Live?
Finally, Love Live is back.
It's about women being weird, alien, and emotional.
To me the ending ruins the entire show, since you realize what it's really about.
Just typical "women are shrews" bullshit.
More like disgust.
I don't think disappointment is the word I'd choose.
Higurashi Gou is super good and the people who asked why it exist are dumb.
Too bad the mangaka is a homophobe.
Man, so many many anime that became game changers.
Watch the blue ray instead of the TV broadcast.
Granblem is shit.
I just use it to keep track of everything I read and watch.
I prefer using MAL.
ENOUGH WITH THE ISEKAI!
I actually liked Canaan, even if it's not exactly a masterpiece.
Now that I think about it, the only mecha anime with a girl protagonist I can think of are Gunbuster/Diebuster and Lagrange.
But  least she wasn't portrayed as incompetent.
I  do wish  had more badass moments.
||Or to the physical world in general.||
TBF, ||she isn't used  to having a real flesh and blood body.||
Plenty of people think  fanservice=bad anime.
Good to know you're cultured.
Exiled from Paradise is great, don't let the boobs fool you.
Watched 2 episodes of spider isekai. It's nice, but I hope it doesn't get too serious and depressing later, because I'm watching it to relax.
Make a better player, damnit!
I wanted to stream legally, but at this point pirating is literally the better option.
Does the CR player takes a shitton to load to anyone else?
The anime ruined the pacing.
Satoko from Higurashi.
Character. <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I'm here to announce I have a new fav.
Sotsu is really fucking good.
Good choice.
Except Love Hina is shit and Negima isn't.
Just recently marathoned all of it.
Higurashi is really good.
Aren't you sick of watching shitty anime? Don't you just wanna watch something good?
Aren't people tired of that? The market is full of that stuff.
I, for one, prefer a good anime to be made.
Read Nettagyo. It's the most pure thing you could find.
No hand holding before marriage.
Only wholesome UWU lesbians.
I second that.
Eh, I'd take what I can get.
I won't spoil, but you won't be disappointed.
Read the School Idol Diary manga, it's really gay.
Imagine watching an idol anime for reasons other than gay.
||Or Bern and Lambda. Whatever goes.||
||It better end with Rika and Satoko becoming girlfriends and living happily ever after.||
Like, this is When They Cry, that's how it works, folks.
Everyone says the twist is a "cop out" and cliche, showing they paid 0 attention to the entire franchise.
Wow, MAL comments are shit.
I just watched ep 10 of Sotsu and all I have to say is AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
This was the best episode of Higurashi ever and I will not hear a second opinion.
And I believe Gou and Sotsu are better when binged as well.
I binged it all in a few days. It was that good.
It's not a reboot, it's a sequel.
Yes.
||Like, they're gonna stay apart for the rest of their lives?||
||I'm so upset Satoko and Rika didn't reunite at the end.||
Okay, can I talk about Sotsu spoilers?
||They just exist "outside" of normal reality.||
||They're real in Higurashi, so they're probably real in Umineko, too.||
||Fucking live together after highschool.||
||I need to know that they get together eventually so fucking bad. You have no idea how invested I am in this ship.||
I want SatoRika to kiss.
Kashimashi: Girl Meets Girl.
So if I got it right, in the ending of Sotsu ||the witches that will be known as Bernkastel and Lambdadelta leave to start their eternal game of ~~BDSM~~ tag and human Rika and Satoko take a time off each other so they can grow out of their co-dependence so they can repair their relationship||, right?
I think Gainax and Trigger do original anime almost exclusively?
Yeah.
I never watched any of the Negima anime, but the OP of the SHAFT one is a bop.
The SHAFT one?
That, and making 12/25 episodes is cheaper than a long running anime.
Because studios jumped on the wagon to adapt popular shounen manga while they're hot and fillers fell out of favor.
Maybe it's just nostalgia, though.
I love the aesthetic of the old FMA and other such 2000s anime.
A shitty ending can retroactively ruin a good story.
In a way, I even like the ending more, even if the new ending is happier.
I love the old FMA about as much as Brotherhood.
Seven!
It was great.
Watch LWA.
Which was amazing.
And then a sequel got funded and then they made a full TV anime.
It was a fan funded passion project.
It's original.
Because not everyone is a masochist.
And read the VN later when you have time.
Read the manga adaption in a pinch.
It's fucking long though.
The newest season that just ended.
You'd need to for Sotsu to make any sort of sense.
BTW, do you know anything about Umineko?
Put on your sit belt, the wild ride is ahead of you.
Did you start Kai yet?
The thing about Higurashi is that there's no point in keeping a grudge.
||It's basically what happens when you give kids powers over reality and they fuck each other up.||
Once you realize that ||you understand that both Rika and Satoko were in the wrong||.
I'm too tired off work to go into details to explain, but essentially ||Gou and Sotsu are just an exaggerated fight between children with superpowers mixed in.||
I disagree.
I'm gonna stop you right there. What she did was way worse.
No Okada! There is hope!
Fuck Funi and their region lock.
<:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
Not m fault that you can't appreciate excellence when you see it.
Satoko best character.
And Amphibia is also getting pretty serious, they gonna cancel it too?
It's really stupid.
And it's not like Gravity Falls wasn't also aimed at young teens.
It's both successful and critically acclaimed.
It's bullshit, because it's one of their most popular shows and it's amazing.
The Owl House.
Yeah, some executive canceled it because "it didn't fit the brand" because it's aimed to older kids.
Disney canned The Owl House, they ain't getting my money.
Is it the final season?
YEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!
Aoi "The Rock" Yuuki.
So if you enjoyed the anime I recommend watching the play.
Ironically, the original stage play fixed all of them.
RevStar is great, but I have a few gripes with it.
Maybe I will read the manga. üëÄ
Eh? I really enjoyed it in the manga.
<:MikuCry:688397678584791074>
They gotta animate it.
SBR is super popular though.
It's easier to get into.
The manga is separated into parts with different characters and plotlines, so it's not a long running series like One Piece.
BRB
Wait, Stone Ocean is out already?!
I didn't mind that the characters were different each season.
Tamers was my favorite season though.
Needs to be updated with Nichijou.
Make Akane and  Rikka kiss.
That's very nice, but I want yuri.
It's not yuri.
Have you read Nettagyo?
I think I don't trust any "yuri" involving aquariums or marine life.
Was it bait?
First time?
https://tenor.com/view/cat-dog-cartoon-facepalm-annoyed-oh-no-gif-17348341
Wow, just wow.
Really?! REALLY?!
Sadly not a sequel to the OVA, but at least it's not related to the Okada anime either.
And it's a classic.
I recommend KnM even though it's not the greatest writing wise, but at least it's an actual yuri anime and not subtext.
The new manga is really good though.
HOLY SHIT, just scrolled up and saw Nana FHFGKJHGUJLKUYIL
Real fangs are sexy.
I hate flesh fangs.
Wow, hand-drawn horses.
A girl with twintails and the nickname "Banana" shouldn't have such top energy.
Call out for Daiba Nana, she's too sexy.
Images you can hear.
I don't know if linking NSFW is okay.
I read a few good fics exploring the impact of dynamics on society and culture.
As someone who's fond of wlw ABO, there's a lot more than just smut out there.
"Wakarimasu" <- doesn't wakaru at all.
And fucking gay married NanoFate adopting a child.
I'm a slut for world building.
Writing wise, A's is better, but StrikerS has so many elements that I absolutely love and it expanded a lot of world building.
StrikerS is my favorite season, but I'm seem to be in the minority.
Can you spoiler please?
The MCU effect.
I think we have different criteria to measuring gay.
I like Revue, but it's got a way to go.
Gear has canon gay.
What?
Yeah, it feels like the only things going for her are her MC status and that she doesn't have a single mean cell in her body, but that's about it.
contrasting against the other girls.
I find her wishy washy. She was better in the play, where she was
Sorry to say, but I dislike Karen.
Banana best girl.
Wow, way to diss Kuro's best friend, Futaba.
So that's why I fucking hate Granblem.
Which is like, against everything I believe in.
||And it's treated like it's how things SHOULD BE and that was ultimately good and right.||
||I hate how in the end everyone just played their role like a puppet on a string while sacrificing everything and gaining nothing because it was the will of some great incomprehensible force who was just fucking with people's lives.||
I hate the ending and the message.
It's not even fun trash, it's frustrating trash.
Granblem is trash and I hate it.
??? Why?
What's she counting?
<:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616> I know, but still.
Funi is bad because they're not available in my region, forcing me to pirate and not giving animators money.
StrikerS is my favorite season.
OH MY GOD
IS THAT EDITED
REYUHRYTKIIUTY
I mean, it's a joke, but still.
How is the censoring making it worse?
I'm so hype!
YOOOOOOOOOOOO!
Well, yeah.
||Can't wait for one of them to die horribly because Gundam.||
Didn't expect to see Fudou in Gundam.
üëç
I don't know anything about The Tempest so I'm lost.
This is what my thirst for yuri is getting me into.
<:ElsaSmug:688429724443213903>
Watch Comic girls if you want to see a girl with zero self esteem and social anxiety going through breakdowns. Fun.
Poly yuri?! <:Germain:421434126856486912>
He's not making crazy long breaks to play around, he's sick BECAUSE HE WORKED TOO HARD ON HIS MANGA.
Togashi is in the hospital.
The page layouts can be ingenuous though.
I didn't really enjoy the manga, it's too cynical and nihilistic IMO.
Literally 4Kids treatment.
When are MioMio and Suletta gonna fall in love?
Does suletta think you can't go on dates with your spouse, lol.
https://tenor.com/view/the-rock-eyebrow-flipped-horizontally-gif-24025048
Where's Tsubasa's?
Yup.
Pretty sure she voiced the blonde sister of the cat guy.
Then again, I don't really watch dubs.
I don't get what's so bad about it.
G Witch GOAT.
Is that Restaurant for Awkward People?
Does it become gayer?
No Mio. <:HibikiSad:738234648509022368>
Season 2 teaser.
I thought it was Yoshiko, lol.
Not crackpot at all, that's the leading theory.
Assert your wife status, girl!
When is Mio gonna make her move?
||My thoughts is that Eri was dying from the effect of the GUND technology and digitizing her mind and putting it inside the gundam was the only way to save her, or a copy of her at least.||
She's so wholesome.
You can see that Mio has a hard time showing positive emotions and interacting with other people, but she's still trying to support Suletta as best as she can and make her feel better.
I love Mio. I love her so much.
BRUH
Volume=/=mass.
||I want to see Sulettta having to come to grips with her just being a clone and that her mother was using her the entire time. I love seeing characters having an existential crisis.||
No, because I heard it's horrendous.
I don't see why having a twist is making it trash.
Wouldn't that be fucked up or what?
||What if Eri and the gundam's AI switched places so Sulettta is actually Aerial?||
||I prefer the theory because it's more fucked up.||
<:CarolWhat:688191203040034831>
Speaking of which, it's about time we got some development between the wives-to-be.
Only G Witch has any actual gayness going on.
Bochi has subtext... and that's about it.
Because I don't see it.
I'd love to see all the GL you claim to be saturating this season.
That's what she said.
Mio's insistence about not wanting  to marry men seem like a pretty good proof to me.
Hopefully next episode.
And it's more about class and economics.
What, you think bigotry will ever disappear? That's cute.
^ It's definitely apparent with the  variety of skin color and body type in G Witch. Truly a breath of fresh air in anime.
Considering Gundam takes place hundreds or possibly even thousands of years in the future there's probably not a single human who isn't mixed race.
||Suletta finding out she's just a tool while her "tool" of a sister is the real person that she's just living in the shadow of as an imitation. Also there's a big implication that Prospera/Elnora sees Aerial as her real daughter and Suletta would also have to come to grips that her mom loves her MB more than her, which is pretty fucked up.||
And also about class, capitalism and corporate control.
AI was never a theme in the show, it's about breaking out of the path you've been molded into and becoming your own person.
The themes are literally spelled out in the OP lyrics and MV, but okay.
No offense.
I think you're just reading into it the story you want to see and not the story the creators are making.
The AI Guel's MB used is about the same level as a self-driving car.
I feel that you read something completely different than I do from the anime.
I have no idea where you got the idea that AI was a major theme.
It's both the explanation that makes the most sense and fits best with the themes of the show.
For some reason some of you really seem to hate that theory and I just don't get it.
You just made that up.
||She was probably blackmailed. I can't see her betraying her friends.||
Mio was the real MVP.
I'm just sad cause I miss my ship.
No Akane. <:HibikiSad:738234648509022368>
Sequel soon?!
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
Not as bad as Kiss-Shot Acerola-Orion Heart-Under-Blade.
And I still think it's by far the more interesting direction.
The Blessing's PV literally screams that.
I'm looking at you, GoT.
Unless you're a really shitty writer who thinks surprising your audience is more important than making a good story.
||There are too much delibirate hints at Suletta not being Eri. I have a hard time seeing the creators making them just for shit and giggles. ||
||I mean they put him into a body. ||
||Presumbly into an artifical body. ||
||You all seem to forget that Suletta can be a clone even if she's the same age as Eri. Elan4 looks the same age as OG Elan. ||
This is why you should watch Symphogear with Commie subs.
Girl is hungry for the gay.
I need more canon yuri badly.
Wait what
He also wrote novels for Utena, if that makes you feel better.

YES! Mio is climbing!
JP artists are SPEED
WAIT, Miyano Mamoru is Mario

Look at the Japanese cast of the Mario movie, lol.
Is it gonna be lesbait again?
Makes sense.
||And she glowed blue...||
||So Aerial was the one doing the fighting this entire time.||

"Friendship"
The dudebros would lose their shit about the trans guy, lol.
Maybe the character acting and voice acting will make it more bearable, IDK.
Saw a clip from the anime and it has some amazing sakuga. Maybe I'll watch it just to see the animation.
Read some of the manga, and as good as the page layouts are the story and the characters didn't grab me. It felt too cynical and mean-spirited to be enjoyable.
I noticed that every model kit is named "X's Y" but Aerial is just Gundam Aerial.
Man, people really hated Mio this episode.
Watch Bocchi.
Absolute masterpiece.
10/10
Peni, hello?
I sometimes visit the forums threads on G Witch for a good laugh.
MAL is shit, go their forums and see what kind of people are there.
FINALLY!
They better make a second season and resolve the sexual tension between them.
That's nice, when are they making them canon?
Not that it matters, I'm against buying anything from Amazon anyway.
Even after reading the article and the comments I have no idea for the reason why.
Damn, Nakatani's attention to detail.
I never noticed the side covers!

Great commentary about Class S and how wlw relationships are perceived in Japan.
I loved Yuri Kuma Arashi.
Lol, poor Saku being sucked into the madness.
The thumbnail alone makes me want to run screaming.
Let's hope WataOshi is better than the trailer, because that looked cheap as ass.
Yuri or bait?
Wow
That's just
BRUH
G Witch has yuri though so it automatically wins.
It's depression and grief distilled.
I read a lot of depressing manga, but HnK takes the cake over every single one.
LMAO, EoE has NOTHING on HnK.
I wish I could see Ghost in 3D at least.
Shit makes Oyasumi Punpun feel like a cute teen drama.
No joke.
I already dropped the manga though, because it negatively affected my mental health.
There's another hiatus now, so good luck, lol.
Not counting hiatuses.
It only feels fast because you read it one go had not waited a whole agonizing month between each chapter.
Did you even have a childhood?
YOU NEVER WATCHED SPONGEBOB?!
I'm sorry for disrespecting my elder.
Damn, how old are you?
Of course that's not excluding him being wise and a great king, just not a one that sticks to the rules.
He was also best buds with Asmodeus, the king of demons.
Solomon wasn't pious, he used magic, which is strictly forbidden by the bible.
Fate gave King David green hair, so clearly they don't care for accuracy.
StrikerS is my favorite season.
Expect TSAB propaganda.
The movies are in-universe movies based on the events of the Aces' lives.
