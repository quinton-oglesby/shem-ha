I have a Power Hard up if anyone wants to wack at it.
Yeah, give me a sec
I've got a Power raid up as well.
I'll be leaving for work by then lol
You only need to be a follower for it to show up.
3 slots cleared for now
Power raid up
It'll be cleared when you exit then. lol
Put up a Power raid.
No Gigas... Grrr.
I had to refresh to get it even though we're mutuals... lol
I have a Power raid up now
They don't punch *every* raid. Just whatever they can find. üòõ
Opened up a Power raid.
Hitting it now.
Oh, right, I can't find it because I can't follow you back lol
Ack, I just started a story quest. XD
Just doesn't want to drop the Giga Melody, huh? I'm probably going to have the same problem now that I've got all the Giga Powers I need for her...
Opened up a Power raid.
And done, but no luck getting the mats I needed the most from it. lol
Once this battle is over, sure.
I'd do Rage but Advent Battle takes way too long.<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
I put up a Power raid.
Dunno if someone killed this one yet, though.
I haven't hosted anything today lol
I just set it to Hard only. üòì
Funny how the only thing I need now for when Miku releases is just the base Miracle Crystals... lol
I have like 100 still lol
I'm 3 Giga Rage short so I won't pass up it up either.
I'm done for the night now. lol
lol
RIP
That's possible, too.
Miracle and Tech
I'll be poking it a little.
I have a Power raid up.
Technically 1 hour if you consider maitenance. <:YumiPoint:688429724103344164>
I'm pretty sure you do have to win the battle...
lmao
lol
Game, I don't need Giga Rainbows lol
Not me this time. lol
I'm not finding it for some reason...
Seriously...
Someone cleared it too fast.
...someone didn't pause the Tech. :V
lol
lol
#12, where are you?
Yes, it is.
Well, it's cleared now regardless. lol
Someone trolling to not have to face more 70 Ignite jiis, maybe...
If someone is trolling the count, please stop.
I've got a Tech raid up
lol
But if the game crashes while you're in a raid battle, it acts like you never fought at all instead lol
Dex Carol up. Have fun whacking at it while I'm at work. <:TsubasaDisgust:349013662775902209>
This rando is almost dead if anyone needs a Tech raid.
Put up a Dex Carol.
Need another drop like this lol
<:ShiraBean:661294258795446326>
Indeed...
I just do Easy to ensure I clear the weekly host quest lol
I've been doing normal Carols trying to get base Miracle Crystals, but it keeps dropping the Megas that I already have in excess.<:TsubasaDisgust:349013662775902209>
There's a random chance a unit will do an additional attack, which may or may not be exclusive to units at 6* rarity. (I *believe* it is, but I could be wrong.)
~60K would be enough for me to get Hunt usually.
I meant that I put one up myself but I'll take more lol
Put up a Tech raid <:TomosatoSalute:688199574749446203>
I still have 2 hosts left for P-Carol so grab the 5 slots I freed up before the randoms do. üòõ
Having LU Event unit problems... Can't keep my friends list free for a day. <:TsubasaDisgust:349013662775902209>
I didn't even realize that was my own raid for a second lol
Right. Sometimes you'll fail even if you try your best, but no one ever said they couldn't do something and then succeeded in doing it without first changing their mindset.
