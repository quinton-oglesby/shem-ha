The vocal performances are a huge improvement over past seasons, actually. It's one of the best dubs the show has had, imo.
Yeah.
Debatable. DM's opening is iconic, and GX, both of ZEXAL and ARC-V's are all catchy af.
Except VRAINS. No one likes the VRAINS dub opening.

Okay, but why is Kirika making the Megamind face.

Hello there.


I spy a fellow BlazBlue fan.
Yo, Lexi?
Best girl.
Elfnein tripped and fell, so I guess I have to do it.
Please say welcome my good friend Scar (geniusgamers#9485).

Oh hey
Ah, fellow ygo fan
Do you want an invite to my server? There's a lot of VS peeps in there.
I've done a lot of fights over time, but I have a couple of fights in particular that I'm proud of.
Hazama vs Cinder Fall
Velvet Crowe vs Joker (Persona 5)
Ryuunosuke Akutagawa vs Adam Taurus
Might Guy vs Esdeath
I also wrote Lelouch vs Edelgard, but I'm not so sure about the result anymore.
In general, RWBY characters tend to be stronger than JoJo, but they tend to be faster, and usually win if they have better hax.
Yeah, I do.
It's a good start.
Not bad.
I've considered writing that at one point, actually.
Sure.
What fights do you have?
Saves the time of uploading a ton of TNs.
Anyways, here's a bingo for matches that I want DB to do officially.
Ah.
Where do you put your stuff?
Mine was on Deviantart (before it got bad), and I'm uploading my final stuff to Wordpress.
Gay Gun Users. I like it.
Ragna's hax could put Chris down, but it all comes down to speed.
I recall Symphogear being FTL while BlazBlue is Rela.



Alien X fucks Geo over, and Feedback can sense him.
But Geo is faster than the failsafe, and Noise disrupts technology.
Plus, Geo's go-to is to hack, and the Omnitrix has (surprisingly) never showed resistance to technological attacks that aren't physical.
Okay, here's the thing I determined with that match.



Considering how Byleth's time abilities are basically *all* of the final boss time stands in one, yeah.



For these.
Cross-Z handily wins against Yang.
Gokai Red also easily wins against Luffy.
And I think Cloud's faster than Tsubasa. Not sure about strength though, since SG's in a weird place for that.



Dialga's a lot faster, yeah.
I got tons myself.
Sure.
One of those templates look familiar.
Do you know superkoolguy14, per chance?
Sure.


Here are three more I'm working on.
Why make an OC when you can just use the original Rider.
Interesting.
Sure.
Nope.
*Oh no.*
Oh no.
Oh yeah.

He's just looking at his hand wondering where the rest of his body is.
Yooo
This isn't just bias speaking, but when it comes to Toku matches against the girls, Kamen Rider tends to be the fairest, as well as more thematic.
At an absolute baseline, most Ultraman are Solar System busters.
That completely outclasses anything in Symphogear.
Why would you do that to the girls.
Streaming myself on Twitch ranking every Death Battle.
https://twitter.com/EpicLinkSam/status/1472682527072690180

Also, Lexi explained why above.

FINAL SYMPHO GEAR: HIBIKI!
https://twitter.com/yajin1021/status/1305878144050630657
Anyways, the short version: When will XDU give us a Kamen Rider Event.
We got Ultraman and Godzilla. Give us the other Toku series too.
I need Hibiki to interact with Fourze. I NEED IT.
And just imagine the Symphogear armor combined with the Rider Suits.
I did consider that.
But also, the detective duo of Double and Drive would be really cool.
Also, Shirabe and Shinnosuke = WHEELZ
And I... actually compare Kamen Rider to Symphogear a lot.
I even made this to which Heisei Rider I feel matches the Symphogear the most.
So for those wondering, I went with OOO because I recently started it (finished episode 24), and Ankh has shot up to one of my favorite characters in the series.
And I've also wanted to write a Kanade lives AU.
So then it snowballed.
I see my commission has found its way here.
It's brilliant.

I imagine the artist.
Which one.
KNEW IT
So would female Ver be voiced by Haruka Tomatsu.
Did I hear someone mention Star Force.

Though I will admit, it felt more like the actor himself than Kusaka.
I get that, but for some reason, I liked Kusaka being less of a dick.
Honestly, Kaixa's an interesting character.
But bad subs and every one of his appearances after Faiz (except Zi-O) are garbage.
Wrong KR, but yeah.
https://twitter.com/DootMoon/status/1304912372671352832

I'm half on the HibiHibi train and half off of it.
<#336310266654490624>
I mean... there's this Tsubasa card.
Chris is similar to most tertiary riders too, since most of them start on the enemy side.
Well uh, my expectation for the event is that it'll be a lot more... depressing.
Cause I've noticed that EdgeBikki's character archetype tends to be the sacrificial kind...
You know how to make this even more painful.
Imagine Miku's smiling because she finally told Hibiki that she loved her.
I guess they never miss- *'Shot.'*

Another idea.
Kirikadroid gets rebuilt, but can also become armor for AUKiri.
~~While you can always rebuild something, it doesn't mean you *have* to.~~
Robokiri's a robot.
They can always rebuild her.
I have a lot of ideas on how the event ends.
I'm pretty sure they'll do happy ending, but imagine if they go ballsy and choose the bittersweet ones where someone stays dead.

An example would be like Hibiki saying that Aoi Yuuki is her favorite Seiyuu.

So yeah.

Oh man, that Serena outfit one.
Shirabe's pose in the last one is a reference.
Tsubasa tries to take care of the girls, but the reality is that Miku's the one taking care of everyone.
Miku didn't get de-aged because without her, Tsubasa would probably burn the house down.
Honestly, the pic makes me want to write a fic where the other girls get de-aged and Tsubasa has to take care of them.

Problem is, she has no fucking clue how to.

Aibou

Shirabe as a Zi-O rider is Tsukuyomi-Drive Armor.

Yeah, we should move.
This is my ranking for the seasons I've finished.
Yeah. But he said he took on the role for Kuuga as a favor to the director.
And they fired said director during the Hibiki retool, so...
And Toei doing the retool really shot themselves in the foot, because it cost them the chances of Kuuga and Hibiki's actors ever reprising their roles.
What's hilarious is that a lot of people like it for being different.
And people disliked the second half because it tried to be more like a regular Rider Season.
I've heard issues about Hibiki, but I'm reserving my thoughts until I watched it.
Because I heard bad things about Ghost and good things about Gaim, and my feelings were the complete opposite when I watched the shows.
Kamen Rider *Hibiki*.
And Kamen Rider had a music based Season.
Hibiki's very similar to 3 of the most popular protags in Kamen Rider too.
Those being Yusuke Godai (Kuuga), Eiji Hino (OOO) and Gentarou Kisaragi (Fourze).

Now, part of this is because of the fact Ragna's my favorite character, and if someone loses an arm, I *will* make a Ragna comparison.
But I think it could be a cool idea.
I always imagined an idea of Hibiki's relic cancer being similar to Ragna's Azure Grimore.
After losing her arm, a new one forms that looks more... relic-y.
And this one is like a power booster she has to activate, at the risk of losing herself.

You know, I'm kinda surprised that Chris isn't in Dante's DMC3 outfit. Guess this artist wasn't horny.
Chris in Dante's DMC1 outfit and Tsubasa in Vergil's DMC4 outfit.
THIS was the one I was talking about earlier.

~~I haven't watched Kiramager.~~
What's the translation on this one?
You got a list of her prices?
Also, Kaiya does commissions?
Going back through fancontent:
Accel pitched the idea, saying she should be soft and fluffy.
You suggested the appearance, the "gao" and being a bit of a wild child like Mordred from Fate.
I suggested that she should be the quiet one to Asuka's snark and Hayate's ham and look up to Hibiki. ~~And just summarized her as a mix of Yusuke Godai and Emu Hojo.~~
And I don't know how much Nuker was involved, since it was probably behind the scenes, meaning Accel had more too.
~~Wasn't I involved too?~~
~~So does this mean her favorite Sentai is Gaoranger.~~
***ARE YOU READY?!***
**MAXIMUM DRIVE**
~~Though it's really Miku taking care of all of them and Tsubasa.~~
I've honestly wanted to write one where everyone gets deaged by a relic or something, and Tsubasa and Miku have to take care of them.

Oh and time for the VA trivia from me again.
Tsubasa in TMS is voiced by Inori Minase (Carol).
And Kiria is voiced by Yoshino Nanjo (Shirabe).
Sucks how the FE and SMT fans didn't like the game.
They're missing out on a great game.
Oribe from Tokyo Mirage Sessions.
Tsubasa
Oh yeah, we should move this there.
I imagine if they added more elements of Shin Megami Tensei (give me a mirage based on Demi-fiend), and didn't focus mostly on Shadow Dragon for the Fire Emblem side, people wouldn't have complained as much.
Yup.
https://twitter.com/sebban_e/status/731131432140210176
Also, never forget.
Like, if they advertised it as it was, it probably would've done better.
Like, I love how badass the design is, but what did they do to Chrom.
3_skip
And there's also the redesigns for some of the characters.
I think a major reason it failed was because it was advertised as a Shin Megami Tensei and Fire Emblem Crossover.

Akame ga Kill, more like Akame gets all her friends Killed.
Esdeath too, which I agree even though I don't like her.
She's one of the most generic villains possible, but that kinda works for her due to the nature of Akame ga Kill's world.
Or if you hate yourself.
As much as I love Chelsea, it's not even worth watching for her.
Akame ga Kill's only worth watching if you like the titular character.
I actually recommend against it since the anime kinda sucks, but both it and the manga are both different types of trashfires in the same tier.

Grace is great too (her default alt breaks the game).
I'm personally more of a fan of Aldred (since he's Ragna in Dragalia Lost), but Farren's a good boy.
The Syndicate side story is one of the best subplots Dragalia has.
I'm like 90% sure Tsubasa would crash this car just as much as her motorcycles.

Hell yeah.
Did the bot not work?
Yeah. Power to their mom if I did that, but that would make things an even bigger mess than it already is since I essentially doubled the main cast in the first season alone.
See, I specifically made it a twin AU, so not only would that kind of not work out due to the difference in body/age, that would mean their mom gave birth to 4 kids.
It started with the idea of Tsubasa having a rebellious and reckless sister.
Then I thought of Hibiki having an edgy sister.
And then Chris with a soft and cute sister.
And then it all snowballed together and took over my life for the past two years.

The guy knows exactly what to say to get under your skin.
But what makes Devil Hulk so dangerous is that he can easily break your will by *talking.*
Devil Hulk can easily smash his opponents to pieces.
What I meant is the demeanor.
So Devil Hulk Hibiki then.
Oh yeah, like how it was with Aruto.
They all thought he was being controlled by Ark.
No, he knew *exactly* what he was doing.
Oh gee, a version of Hibiki losing it because Miku "dies." I'm sure we never saw that before.

That's a different thing entirely.
That's because vore is physically impossible?

The Batman one is from last year, during the Black Lives Matter protests.
The guy didn't go there for support. He did it for clout.
Nothing yet.
Voice Actors are posting candles and hearts, and talking about losing someone close on Twitter.
Something happened.
I loved his performance as Ranpo in Bungou Stray Dogs.
God I fucking remember the whole KickVic vs IStandWithVic wars on Twitter.
It was an absolute mess.
It looks so photoshoped, but it's actually real.
She claimed it was a symbol of violence or some shit.
Lily was going places.
Oh my God, I remember that.

I think the 1 in 7.5 trillion part speaks for itself.
So it was;
Either say nothing and try to let it fade (even though it won't).
Or give a shitty apology six months after most people forgot the drama, and start it all up again.
I'd say bold of you to assume they get pussy, but I have seen couples of all kinds get together over their shared interest of Dream.
I think I saw a lesbian couple get married too.
How the fuck do you "accidently" leave in a mod that improves the rng of a *highly specific* part of the game.
Six months too late, you shitty paint.net jpeg.
He ended it with some shit like "uwu, don't send hate to anyone involved."
He deleted his pastebin with his apology too.
Six months of the mods of the speedrun community being sent death threats by the fucking stans.
The tldr is that he "accidently" left in a mod that improved his RNG chances. Giving him a result that's a 1 in 7.5 trillion chance.
"By accident" he says.
Yes.
Also, I think a red flag people need to talk about more is that Dream collabed with Butch Hartman.
There's that, but it's Minecraft *YouTube* for a reason so. 🤷
I'd say stay away from them, but it's insanely difficult to online because of how far the reach is.
They fucking got a *keysmash* to trend.
It drives me insane how MCYT is trending on Twitter every fucking day for the absolute dumbest shit.
I see someone already mentioned Tubbo, so we don't have to bring up how shit MCYT Stans (especially Dream's) are.
Are we talking about content creators that turned out to be pieces of shit.
I've seen it in fanfics, every now and then.
Whelp. The Cory in the Big House memes are gonna start.
I could have sworn people knew this already.
Cory doesn't want to be in the Big House.
What the fuck.
There's a documentary, IIRC.
It's what the RWBY fandom is called.
I stopped paying attention to RWBY critics when one of them said that the best way to do trans representation is to kill them off and deadname them.
See, the problem is that there are two sides to this, and the critic side is just as (and actually probably a lot more) guilty when it comes to stupid takes like this.
This is actually really stupid, ngl.
I fail to understand why this is in Serious Discussion.
The critics have died down considerably, yeah.
They were at an all time high last year, considering they doxxed someone who wanted out.

Morton's Fork is a term for there being multiple outcomes, but they're equally bad results.
I believe it's a Morton's Fork situation atm for Putin, which is why he's still pushing it.

That's at least what I heard. I could be wrong.
Growing apart is a natural thing that happens.
Bonds that last forever are very rare.
It might be a me thing, but if I'm still talking to them, that would be good enough for me.
bruh moment

Ezra Miler's gone fucking insane, holy shit.
In the same month.
We lose Billy Kametz and Technoblade to cancer in the same month.
This fucking sucks so much.
I reckon September'll be an interesting month.

~~Isn't everything driven by capitalism~~
If by chance RT loses the IP (which isn't out of the question at this point, tbh), I'm pretty sure CRWBY could float on their own.
Considering another RT IP, Death Battle is capable of staying afloat on its own without RT support (according to the showrunner), something far more popular like RWBY would definitely be able to continue.
Okay, yeah, that makes things clearer.
So you're saying that we shouldn't support CRWBY if they leave Rooster Teeth and continue the show separately?
If they all said they didn't want to continue RWBY, I'd be completely understanding and supportive of it.
It's more of supporting the people that worked on it.
The idea of RWBY continuing is just a side effect.

I think this is a comparison joke, but it doesn't work well when comparing multiple series.
Just because a table can't speak, doesn't mean it consents.
Poor table-kun.
It has to do with the ||masturbation|| tag, actually.
Watch Code MENT. It's faster.
Rewatching Code Geass takes a lot of time.
Bungou Stray Dogs is my reccomendation.
AgK readers be like
I preferred Mei, tbh.
But Yuzu was great.
You mean Kaguya-sama.
That was part of the reason too, actually.
Yeah. I've talked to Dee a couple of times. While he'll voice act in other series here and there, he's done abridging due to YouTube copyright bullshit.
Shame Dee won't be continuing it though.
>Since I need to finish the movie
Here's a tip.
Skip Dead Apple.
It's *awful.*
And one of the absolute best dub casts I've ever seen.
It has a dub.
>BNHA..fanbase
The prime reason I've been stopped from starting MHA.
>every fanbase is bad
It's really sad I can't think up a single one that I haven't found toxic to some extent.
While Dream's a fun YouTuber (and does some big brain stuff in Minecraft), his fandom treats him like a God.
Another prime example of a shitty fanbase is who my PFP is based off of.
I love Ishigami's response of "bruh."
The story is fucked.
Yeah.
||They got raped by shitloads of the "heroes" of the world, and then the protag gains the ability to travel back in time.||
||So he chooses to fight fire with fire. He basically rapes most of them back.||
When the main thing that drives the fucking story is ||revenge-rape|| yeah. *KINDA.*
I'm not looking forward to Twitter once this drops.

>I'm binging rent a girlfriend
I'll pray for you.
Especially them making Sasuke leagues better than he was previously.
The only reason you should be watching Boruto is for the Naruto characters.
Also, Takatora's my favorite character in Gaim, and I'm glad he got tons of stuff after Gaim finished.
You know, it reminds me that Gaim actually tried to have the two sides talk things out (Kouta and Takatora), but then they had to stick with the regular formula because "Rider fighting cool."
If you want a Rider season that did what Gaim tried to do (darker season that dropped two parters), but made it work. Build is the better one.
>They hired him because they wanted to change things up so they got a manga writer.
They already did that for Fourze by hiring the Gurren Lagann writer.
The whole point of Micchy is "everything hurts and everything I do just makes it hurt more."
Micchy's arguably the best written character in the show.
Problem is, he's not that likable for a plethora of reasons.
PreCure has that weird spot in the back of my childhood memories.
Since I watched the dub of the first one when I was a kid.
OHHH THIS ONE
...I'm very stupid and uneducated, so please tell me if I'm wrong.
Does this mean that...
...Symphogear could get dubbed?
So Funimation just acquired Crunchyroll.
https://twitter.com/FUNimation/status/1336820609305731072?s=20
~~But you need to see to read. So you're technically seeing the gay?~~
I'm just gonna log off of Twitter for the entirety of Redo of Healer's airtime.
*Leans back relaxing due to swearing off ever watching another Urobutcher work.*
Spider Isekai is what happens when Hibiki died at the concert.
Yeah. In an interview, he straight up admitted he was shitty at writing stories.
RWBY's original point wasn't a good story. It was supposed to be just for cool and flashy fights.
*Best* girl.
Quints also has a good Miku.
Also, Episode 7 gave me PTSD to Fine.
Started Nanoha. I'm enjoying it.
Finished the first Season of Nanoha.
I thought Symphogear prepared me, but there was SO MUCH GAY.
I just finished Nanoha A's.
Like take this one of mine for example.

Reaching for the furthest shelf is one of my personal favorite pastimes.
It'll be a while until I start it, since I do have a list of what I'll be watching.
I'm planning to start Revue Starlight at some point.
Wasn't Digi the one that had a meltdown over how "bad" the JoJo Part 5 anime looked to them, and then received tons of backlash, before trying to pass it off as a joke?
Is that Tommy Oliver or Burai?
Strider Hiryu in general.
I went with his MVC3 render.
Made a small update to mine.
I thought it was about cuckholding.
Are we including all of Season 4.
That and the ending is so fucking *bad.*
And now, let me find the big one. My biggest love-hate anime.
For me, Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V is the worst of the series, but it has some stuff I like here and there.

Now for another.
But I love it nonetheless because the MC is so much like my favorite character ever.
It's a basic-ass isekai with a pretty rushed adaptation.
Arifureta
Oh, have I got a few.
Wait, are we talking about bad anime that we like regardless?
And she was my FAVORITE FUCKING CHARACTER
She dies in the manga too.
Ever since I realized this, I haven't known peace.

https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EuCkSNjXcAEql8G?format=jpg&name=large
https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EuCkTOUXAAk2Kiw?format=jpg&name=large
Also, since this is a Symphogear server, I'm gonna bring up my favorite joke.
Yeah. It's odd.
Esdeath seems like the basic, bare bones antagonist, but she works surprisingly well.
There's so much I fucking hate about AgK, but a lot I love too, then hate because it's in *this* trainwreck.

Anyways, going back onto one of the topics; the anime I have the biggest love-hate relationship with.
"Hands up, or we'll shoot you with our invisible guns!"
If "improve" means "funny," yes.
Ayy
Sangou.
~~I swear to God they knew what they were doing with that name.~~
Also, she'd instantly be friends with Saber and Zenkaiser.
The MC gives me so many Hibiki vibes.
Tropical Rogue is my first real dive into the franchise (I vaguely remember the English dub of the first Season).
I'm enjoying it so far.
But I have found a few pages.
I've been trying to find it, but I can't find where.
Anyone here that follows Kaguya-sama is gonna lose their minds once they read chapter 220.
Yup
Code Geass is another recommendation of mine.
And while it's very long, I also suggest Gintama.
Can I suggest Bungou Stray Dogs.
Are we suggesting anime.
https://twitter.com/EpicLinkSam/status/1370795783281344524?s=20
Gintama
Citrus is one of the shows you watch to see how much of a trashfire it is.
Putting it on the list.
Okay then.
Is Flip Flappers a gay show?
Perhaps.
https://twitter.com/EpicLinkSam/status/1375984022040498182?s=20
And if I had a nickel for every Tendou that's considered to be good at everything in a show with boatloads of gay subtext, I'd have two nickels.
Which isn't a lot, but it's weird it's happened twice.
It's very gay.
https://twitter.com/EpicLinkSam/status/1376364295974436865?s=20
Hell yeah.
Gintama
What have you watched so far.
The amount of references the show has is incredible.
Sorry about that.
https://twitter.com/FUNimation/status/1378135256054820865?s=20
So we can now talk about Kamen Rider W here and it wouldn't be off-topic.
I keep forgetting that as many Kamen Rider references I might make in my fics, it'll never come close to Nyaruko-san.
Didn't the manga sales at one point surpass One Piece.
When Japan hired mostly newbie Seiyuus for RevStar, it worked out fine.
They tried it again with the English Dub and failed.
https://twitter.com/EpicLinkSam/status/1391984258718240768?s=20
And another one joins Code Geass.
I don't think that one was even behind the scenes issues.
The writers were just COWARDS.
When you think of Yusei and Aki: <:TsubasaJoy:688191716620238870> 
When you remember they didn't tie the knot: <:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
https://tenor.com/view/berserk-guts-walk-anime-gif-9724918
The fact that we can sit here and talk for hours about how much influence Berserk has speaks volumes.
Hellrising Hopper is an even more blatant example since it's function is the exact same.
Forces Aruto to go berserk, and it's so powerful that it breaks his bones, and forcefully rips them back into place.
You can't tell me that (forgive me for bringing the show up again) that stuff like FangJoker, Hazard Trigger and Primitive Dragon weren't inspired by the Berserker Armor.
The Berserker Armor is another good example of influential, for powerful and uncontrollable forms of the heroes.
Hell, I think you could argue for Symphogear in some ways too.



Black Clover's mangaka has said how much Berserk inspired it.
Mikasa from AOT was inspired by Casca.
And like Shemmy said, brooding man with big sword, with Cloud Strife and Ragna the Bloodedge being two of the big examples.
It's from the official account.
Kentaro Miura has passed away.

>You should hear the sound department.
***CLANG***
I'm like 80% sure the animators were fans of South Park.

There's a prime example I could bring up.
Might be just me then.
Considering how much I love BlazBlue and Gintama.
Seeing the Ver Emote.
Tomokazu Sugita.
He's got one of the most recognizable voices in the industry.
Are we talking about VAs.
Oh.
Bryce Papenbrook?
Like, there may be slight differences for his normal speaking voice.
But when he starts shouting or screaming, you go "yup. That's him."
I think the easiest English VA to recognize is Johnny Yong Bosch.
Because he uses the *exact same voice* for all of his characters.
Oh, if we're talking about English Dubs.
Gaon in Zenkaiger
Takumi from Fire Emblem
Koichi Hirose
Issei
Only exception I can think of is Seth from Under Night In-Birth, who has a slightly deeper voice.
It's pretty much the exact same voice for all his characters.
Oh, I got another one.
Yuki Kaji.
I really can't tell the difference between her performance as Maria and Rias.
Yoko Hikasa? I tend to recognize her pretty easily.
There's a talking giraffe.
So wait, now you're complaining about it not being realistic?
Shows with an actual experienced protag tend to be lesser in number than newbie protags.
We lampshaded that above, yes.
If you were gonna make a controversial comparison, you may as well have just said Revue Starlight is just Madoka, since Gaim and Madoka are identical.
Comparing Revue Starlight to Gaim is probably the biggest and stupidest reach I've seen.
And you're looking at someone that does some big and stupid reaches.
...and that's a rare plot?
That's a generic ass plot.
How tf do you see Kamen Rider Gaim.
I remember one time for a play rehearsal, two folks were doing a swordfight with cardboard swords.
One of them swung it so hard, the blade broke.
But all of us thought it was badass, so we stuck it into the performance.
Also, people talking about the VRAINS Dub.
Gotta bring up this legendary bit.
https://twitter.com/EpicLinkSam/status/1134090050264817664?s=20
This is a crossover I've been waiting to see.
Scooby-Doo and Courage the Cowardly Dog is a long overdue crossover.
Anyone say Domestic Girlfriend yet?
Oh, people were talking about anime with good openings but shit plots?
Apparently, this story *starts* with ||the MC's childhood friend getting raped by a parody of the Redo of Healer MC.||
Funny you mention that.
It *starts* with a parody character being the main source of conflict, and only *now* people get upset?
Wow, they cancel it for making fun of other Isekai instead of the actual content in it, lmaooo.
Started reading this new manga. It's pretty good so far.
https://mobile.twitter.com/shonenjump/status/1408168085966790657
I'm curious if this is why Saber X Ghost was a thing.
Toei's maybe experimenting, now that we're in the Reiwa era?
A lot more of an interesting spin on team-ups compared to Toei's live action works.
https://twitter.com/kentawong94/status/1414955664775032836?s=20
Oh is it Yu-Gi-Oh! opinion time?
5Ds > DM > VRAINS > GX > ZEXAL > ARC-V
It's insane when you compare the dub for ARC-V and VRAINS. There isn't even a contest. The VRAINS dub is surprisingly actually good.
Yeah, that's what pisses me off even more about the Synchro arc.
How much they were riding 5Ds' dick.
They did my man Aster so fucking dirty.
OH CAN WE TALK ABOUT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT PISS ME OFF SO MUCH IN ARC-V
THE LEGACY CHARACTERS
It's called wanting the MC's dick.
Fuck egao, I'll fucking oage.
ARC-V always just had the worst issues with pacing.
The first arc was slow as hell, the Synchro arc was too long, the XYZ arc was too short, the Fusion arc was bad, and the ending was fucking awful.
"I use catapult turtle to launch gaia the dragon champion into the flotation ring so the castle crashes down onto your monsters and I win!"
Shame ZEXAL sucks since it gave us good ass characters.
"Fuck fun, it should be balanced!"
If we're talking about music, I gotta bring up "The kickass theme song that they couldn't use as much anymore because they banned Firewall Dragon."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLQpAvXZfwU
Mentioned it before that several people that worked on Symphogear went on to work at Studio KAI.
I will say that I appreciate how it has siblings as main characters and they don't have incestual undertones unlike so many anime and manga today.
Like, I was super into it a while back, but after the hype factor died down, I realized.
"Wow, this is kinda basic."
Most anime streaming sites.
I have a feeling you might enjoy it, Deathclaw. Based on some of the stuff I remember you like.
Symphogear are the band kids and Revue Starlight are the drama kids.

Same creator as Aho Girl, so it's expected.
I can barely tell much of a difference, tbh.
Considering most typical weebs are all big virgin, the former.
~~Then again, most of us are big virgin.~~
I saw the trailers for Girlfriend Girlfriend and I was hopeful for maybe a romance anime that subverted norms and focused on polyamory.
My hopes were too high.
lmao
Probably the gravure spin-off
Official subs are generally more literal in translation, and they have less personality to them.
I introduced one of my friends to it, and it became one of his absolute favorites.
I watched it a while back and I was suprised at how good it is.
My favorite example to bring up on how badly to do character death.
Are we talking about anime that do deaths really badly.

The dub version *tries* to make it a sequel to the anime.
The latest film acts as a sequel to the manga.
Dark Side of Dimensions alone.
Kaiba launched a space station/space elevator, gave the finger to ancient magic with his own technology and ego, and somehow transcended the laws of *life and death* just to play a card game with Atem.

...oh no.

Why, what did CloverWorks-
Oh remember when Kakyoin's stand could possess people.
And then he never does it again after his first appearance.
Oh, and one time against the ape.
Star Finger actually gets used like... one more time? In his fight when Polnareff got possessed by Anubis.
Remember when Star Platinum inhaled the Justice Stand.
Can't believe Araki made zippers badass.
STICKY FINGAAAZ!!
Never forget. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W944vHnaQPw
Honestly, Part 5 remains my personal favorite, though Part 2 is very close behind.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMkY2mPkz9g
Loved the Cheese Boy.
Shame Fugo got benched.
My favorite Stand is Purple Haze.

Like, I love rewatching Part 3, but it has the most issues compared to the other Parts animated so far.
What kinda annoys me is how Araki just benches Kakyoin for a good chunk of the second half.
And Avdol barely does anything in the second half.
I prefer Part 1 Dio as a character, but Part 3 Dio is good too.
And Dio just messing with Polnareff instead of killing him is comedy gold.

I might go back and watch it when it's done airing though.
I personally fell off it myself due to how much of a change it was.
Since I really loved VRAINS.
ARC-V has a lot of issues, but it had a fantastic supporting cast.
Ironically enough, she's probably one of the best moms in the series.
~~Which makes the latter's life more depressing.~~
Jaden and Yusaku are the only ones we don't see have parents.
ARC-V
They showed Yusei and Yuma's moms too.
Can't believe Tsubachris inspired Devil May Cry

Should I watch YuYuYu's sub or dub.
Ehh, I guess. But they're still part of the BlazBlue franchise, so...
Listen, white haired edgy anti-hero with an artificial arm and dark devouring powers, and a several hundred year old blonde snarky vampire girl is a combo I've only seen twice.
I'm biased towards Arifureta because it's basically isekai Ragna and Rachel.

Konosuba's dub is worth watching, tbh. They have a really good cast going.
Here's one of the most iconic examples.
Several fans are thinking it might be AU content.
Others noted that it might actually be something bigger, since a lot of folks are following it, including YAGOO, the CEO of hololive.

Anyways, the last thing I'll say with VS debating is that, while the point may be to find out who wins, you'll enjoy it a lot more if you're just seeing two characters that have a similar theme clash in a really cool fight.
Just gonna post 4 of the big hitting episodes that Death Battle has done recently.
I get where you're coming from, but while character interaction is definitely the selling point for the crossover part, the VS debating part is seeing just how their differing powersets interact.
Oh, *that* bad, huh.
The people that care only about the power part and not literally anything else.
The YouTube comments.
By the robot, you mean the whole team for TTGL, yeah?
Oh the robot.
~~Oh no worries, Simon's most likely match is Kyle Rayner from DC Comics.~~
And since I'm in this server, I should probably mention that Hibiki vs Yuuki Yuuna's getting a bit popular in the VS community.
I honestly watch the Death Battles for the animation.
If the character I think should win gets the victory, that's a bonus.
The VS community is where I started my writing stuff, so I DB is a show I owe a lot to.
I'm friends with several of the research team members for the show too.
Is it funny that my favorite Red vs Blue media are the Death Battles.

Thankfully, you can import from MAL to AL.
Good site, yeah.

My personal favorite is Shippuden OP16.
The same reason Toei will never do a female Sentai Red lead or Main Rider.
You know, I think the only huge missed opportunity for Yu-Gi-Oh director taking charge for Symphogear is that none of the villains ever got to do the Yu-Gi-Oh! villain face.
We can never forget this, can we?
Vector's my favorite villain in the series. He's in my top 20 villains, period.
But they're also two of the best in all of VRAINS, if not the entire franchise.
Yeah.
Anyways, last one. Favorite Duels from VRAINS;
Knights of Hanoi: Playmaker vs Revolver (Second Master Duel)
Ignis Warfare: Playmaker vs Kusanagi
Ai's Rebellion: Toss-up between Soulburner vs Revolver and Playmaker vs Ai
Honorable mention does go to Yuya vs his Mom.
It misses out since it's only three turns long.
Reiji had a lot of fun duels, but none of them really stuck out for me, sadly.
Favorite Duels from ARC-V:
Celina vs Yugo
...
Yeah, that's kinda it, really.
Favorite Duels form ZEXAL;
I don't have enough for every arc, so here are just the ones that come to mind.
Yuma and Kite vs Trey and Quattro
Yuma vs Vector (Final)
Kite vs Mizar
Favorite Duels from 5Ds;
Fortune Cup: Yusei vs Akiza
Dark Signers: Yusei vs Kalin (Round 2)
Pre-WGRP/Crashtown: Yusei and Kalin vs Lawton
WRGP: Team 5Ds vs Team Taiyo
Ark Cradle: Jack, Leo and Luna vs Aporia
Favorite Duels from GX;
Shadow Riders: Jaden vs Chazz (Round 3)
Society of Light: Jaden vs Aster (Round 3)
Dimension World: Jaden vs Yubel (Final)
Darkness: Jaden vs Yugi
Favorite Duels from Duel Monsters;
Duelist Kingdom: Yugi vs Joey
Battle City (Finals): Yugi vs Kaiba
Virtual World: Kaiba vs Leichter
Waking the Dragons: Joey vs Valon
KC Grand Prix: Kaiba vs Zigfried
Millennium World: Yugi vs Atem
I'll make each response stick with the arcs from one season, to not clog things up.
I can just say my favorite duel from each arc.
The problem is that the tier list merged Xyz and Fusion together. Understandable, since the Xyz arc is short as hell.
If they were separate, Fusion would be in Bad, while Xyz stays in Meh.
https://twitter.com/EpicLinkSam/status/1496341269991370759
With the direction ARC-V would go, one of the protags would likely have to lose.
And while it may fly for Jaden and Yuma, it would *not* go so well if they had Yugi or Yusei lose.
With how they handled ARC-V, I doubt they'd be able to do so in a way that would work seamlessly into the plot.

"Who the hell are you and what's wrong with your hair?"
~~The only thing we need to hope is that the ending doesn't suffer like how ARC-V and VRAINS did.~~
I check every now and then, but it seems like they know what they're doing.
Compared to the previous ones treating a Children's Cards Game as serious business, this one just fucking *ran* with the idea in a different direction.
If I were to rank the protags (personally)
Yusei > Yugi > Yusaku > Jaden > Yuga > Yuma > Yuya
I'd say that the series that had the best OPs overall was 5Ds.
Openings 1 and 3 were pretty good.
Openings 2, 4 and 5 are God Tier.
And the Dub opening is incredible.
Vrains opening is just an instrumental, yeah. They went with that option due to the more serious nature of the series.
I really like ARC-V's dub opening, but it suffers from just not fitting after shit hits the fan.
There are so many good OPs
Fuck

Early RWBY was just Monty wanting to make cool fights.
She was Weiss in the RWBY dub already.

Ehh, I wouldn't say so.
When it comes to VA, performance quality > character quality.
And I say he did a fantastic job since he voiced both Yuya and Yuri.
Then the manga decides; hold my Pendulum.
I think the funniest thing is how people thought the ARC-V anime couldn't be topped with how shit it was.

An anime sequel to Kamen Rider W.
Fuuto PI.
It takes place a couple of years after Kamen Rider W.
It doesn't directly spoil anything from W (yet), and even has a few scenes to explain things (like adapting Double's origin story which was absent in the manga).
W isn't necessarily needed to watch Fuuto PI, but you should watch it beforehand to get the full experience.

And since they're directly working with DC on it, we'll likely get some past voice actors for the DC characters, like Kevin Conroy returning as Batman.
And I'm personally excited for the Justice League crossover film, since it's confirmed it's not based on the comics and more of a classic crossover.
Like, you can't really call it obscure/underrated if it's worked with Arc System Works, Atlus, DC Comics and Shaft.
It's definitely a juggernaut online, but offline, not as much.
It's actually really weird.
RWBY makes a ton of money, gets a ton of views, and has worked together with some *really* big names in the entertainment industry.
But at the same time, it's not really mainstream.

I'm just gonna finish my thoughts on the shower scene convo by posting my favorite one.
To me it's less "used to it" and more "I'm asexual and I don't care about boobies."
What do you mean "nude scenes by volume."
Isn't that a fairly common trope? A character that's either depressed or self-reflecting gets a shower scene, which is where a lot of thought usually happens.

My personal favorite is Photon Thrasher from YGO
Quite fittingly enough, they voice the more important characters, Karen, Nana and the Giraffe.
It's nuts, because you got some pretty big VA names like Brittney Karbowski, Luci Christian and Jay Hickman.
There *is* a noticeable improvement for direction compared to the anime (Claudine's VA did fantastic), but it's still very mixed.
Sentai Filmworks is a really mixed bag.
Sometimes you get some really good Dubs (Akame ga Kill, Food Wars and Highschool of the Dead).

The Batman is heavily underrated when it comes to Batman animated stuff.
Other Joker voices I think are pretty good are Alan Tudyk (Harley Quinn), John DiMaggio (Under the Red Hood) and Richard Epcar (Injustice).
It seemed ridiculous back then, but it's unthinkable now.

My thoughts atm (nearly done Episode 4).
https://twitter.com/EpicLinkSam/status/1616523390923194368?s=20
My honest opinion is that while I liked a lot of the characters, the plot wasn't all there and wasn't that investing.
This is also a really fucked Nanoha AU, ngl.
The episodes being borderline shitposts was genuinely one of the funniest parts of the show, considering the content in the actual episodes.
Yeah, that too.
Tusk gets a ton of points for pulling a "I fucked your waifu" to Embryo.
That's actually another thing I wanna mention.
I can understand why people would get mad at Tusk being involved in a show with tons of women, but I honestly think it was handled pretty well. (Really pisses me off when people get mad at bisexual characters not being gay/lesbian)
Besides, Rosalie and Chris are a thing too for a completely yuri pairing.
https://twitter.com/EpicLinkSam/status/1616666326382133248
Nana Mizuki just sings a more "Tsubasa" version of Cross Ange's opening and calls it a day.
New Symphogear album and half of the tracks are new original SRW songs for them, and the other half are the girls singing covers of the various other shows featured in the game.
The music licensing rights are already hell. I don't think Symphogear's inclusion would make things worse.
Look at Project X Zone 2 and try to make a cohesive story with the cover characters alone.
Bamco are the masters of crossover stories.
Just wanted to mention the sound thing because I found out about it and it's the funniest thing.
Picturing it with any of their roles in both of their resumes is comedy gold.
He fell into Ange's crotch a lot.
Which, according to the behind the scenes, the sounds were made from Mamoru Miyano slapping Nana Mizuki's stomach (the two had a good laugh every time it happened).
He's not even a harem MC considering he deadass competes with Hilda to win Ange's heart.
Ange ends up being the harem MC since she chooses both of them by the end.
Normally I would agree, but those types of things usually have the plot circle around the guy.
Tusk's overall role in the story is kept to a degree where he's not overbearing on it or anything like that. Ange is still the MC throughout.
Cross Ange has a really good voice cast in the JP version, but not even they could carry.
The problem is that, no matter how you look at it, DC's superpowered characters are just ridiculously overpowered.
I'm just going to stop you right there.
And he does a really god job voicing a non-meme Thawne in the episode.
https://twitter.com/ViewtifulVal/status/1272263086418939905
And to make it even funnier, do you know who they hired to voice Thawne.
It's one of the best ones of Season 8, and honestly one of the show's best showings ever.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSDTVSeMZnI
Yeah.
I love how that specific gif of Thawne has gotten popular enough to the point most people don't know where it's from.
Reverse-Flash list, because I had to bring it up.

Remembering how they retconned all of Wally's controversial actions in Heroes in Crisis with "Thawne gaslit Wally."
And we all went with it, even though the idea was dumb, was because Thawne is that one petty motherfucker that absolutely *would* do it.
Thawne might make things worse (for everyone in the comic), but to the readers he makes everything better.
This has been the mood of me (and several other folk)
RWBY Justice League is one of the few comic continuities in DC where the Flash's Mom is alive.
Oh, and you wanna know something really funny.
Oh wait, just looked it up.
Something something, DC Multiverse just made ripples that caused the DC Characters' existence in RWBY's world as if they were always there.
Ah.
...no she isn't?
Are you unfamiliar with how Wonder Woman's origin (in certain storylines) is?
The movie is inspired by the comic, but the difference is that;
-The comic treats the story as if the DC characters always existed in RWBY, and they're adapted to fit the world of Remnant
-The movie features the Justice League transported to Remnant from their main world, while their designs are reminiscent of the comic
Gonna be real here, the only reasons people got RT FIRST accounts were for either RWBY or Death Battle.
Now RWBY's on Crunchyroll, and Death Battle's YouTube member account is posting the episodes early now.
Yeah, his alien status would be kept.
At first, they think his powers are his semblance, before the wide variety makes them realize that no one has a semblance this wide and versatile.
It might be handled more interestingly too.
Since in the comics and several continuities, Superman rejected his Kryptionian heritage, and created mental locks on his powers, which he only slowly unlocked as he started accepting himself.
But this Superman lives in a place where superpowers and fighting are common.
Though maybe they could've kept the Bat-themed stuff, with Batman as the vigilante helping people, regardless of who they are.
And no one knows if he's human or faunus.
I guess they couldn't straight-up adapt the Batsuit and stuff since there's a chance that could have racist implications towards Faunus, but still.
Honestly, making Batman a Faunus was a really dumb idea.
Yeah, ha ha, "Bat", funny.
But Bruce's whole thing is that he's the rich guy that people respect because of his philanthropy, with a lot of people trying to get in his good graces for money.
Making him part of the oppressed group doesn't really work for him.
You know, I an idea I had that could be cool was that Kahndaq could be located in one of the various deserts, or even Menagerie, setting up stuff for Shazam and Black Adam.
Damn shame *the* iconic Batman voice is no longer with us now...
Like, George Newbern as Superman or Troy Baker as Batman.
I think a straight-on crossover, with some of the more well known VAs for the characters would've had better reception.
Honestly, the movie going the route of adapting elements of the comics feels off to me.
That was what the comic did, yeah.
What I didn't know was that the like-dislike ratio would get worse than both Goku vs Superman episodes, which is an achievement.
I went into that episode hoping Ben would pull off the win (Ben 10 is my childhood), but I knew Hal would take the dub.
DC characters kill beings stronger and more broken than Alien X like every other week.
We're not.
If anything, the episode overhyped Ben and nerfed Hal, and Hal *still* wins.
Yeah.
People always downplay Green Lantern, because of John's showing in the Justice League cartoon and Hal in the DC animated movies, but they are by far some of the most powerful and broken characters in comic book history.
And the Big Bang made the Universe, cool.
DC's Universe is several hundred thousand times bigger than the Ben 10 Universe, and lower tier Green Lanterns' have survived multiversal retcons.
The proper way to watch Family Guy is you randomly click one recommended clip on YouTube, and all you watch are clips and compilations that get recommended to you.
I'm the opposite since I'm Canadian; I never knew they edited this out in the states.

I gotta bring up *the* goat
Are we talking childhood cartoons.

They got Kuuga/Double's narrator. They knew what they were doing.
The Japanese fans aren't happy about the CSM adaptation, yeah
Bocchi sweep
You haven't checked out they SPY X FAMILY Dub?
tbf, they could've gone with any deep male voice actor.

Ayamu Murase already in two of Toei's shows.
Like Dan Green as Tetsuya.
I think what surprised me the most was they got a lot of 4K affiliated VAs for it.
I guess this goes in here more since I'm talking more about the anime involved.

I personally enjoyed the more human-like antagonists, since I feel Dynazenon was far more character-driven compared to Gridman.
~~Also, unpopular opinion but I didn't really care much for Akane, not gonna lie~~
https://twitter.com/EpicLinkSam/status/1624996842348986375
The way they animated the 3D models as if it's the guys in the suits instead is so great.
I think the reason Dynazenon (and Gridman) were great to me was because I didn't go in as if watching anime. I watched it as if I was watching toku, which the shows just really homage well.
Oh yeah, Knight was great. Actually the best part of Dynazenon (to me).
Honestly, I feel like the one people prefer between Gridman and Dynazenon depends on "Do you like Ultraman or Super Sentai."
Dan Green as Tetsuya is a fantastic casting choice though, holy shit.
And someone deadass uploaded the whole dub on YT, which is where I'm watching it.

I heard the sub voices in 30 and was gonna check out the sub, but all the "totally legal" sites have really crappy subs.

People already told me.
It's Gundam as a Super Robot show instead of Real Robot.
The only Gundam I've watched is the first cour of G-Witch.
I think that's gonna be the plan since G Gundam is likely winning the poll.
I'll probably binge watch second place then.
Poll:

It's my 3rd favorite anime.
Reminder that Daisuke Ishiwatari's new album comes with a free game.
I heard this on Twitter earlier.
This is now one of my favorite Toku insert themes.
It's *fantastic.*
Remember that all of Ishiwatari's albums come with free video games.
Full version is to release on September 29th.

They get posted usually during the next set of comms.
Since Brandon needs time to record them.
