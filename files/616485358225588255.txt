Neptune and Serena pudding eating contest
In conclusion, Serena is just Sympho-Nep-gear (not proven XD)
Mhm
So yeah.. These two *quite* have some similarities
Yup
||Reminds me of what Serena did in the middle of her event is just a reversal of what Nepgear did in Rb3 (aka the portal stuff)||

Ah yes. Slurp soba
Pretty much
yup
O H
I mean... I know about Nepgear's(Gya) but what about Serena's...?
Wait really?
Difference is... Serena likes pudding which is Nepgear's older sis' thing
"Pnom Penh taught me that"
||One got killed, while the other one kills||
***Yep.***
Yep
Yup
Japanese that is

Am almost complete. Now onlybthe head and back is to be changed
Finally
I know a mall that sell gunpla nearby. But thing is.. Theres too many peeps in said mall so i wont risk the chance going there even though i wanted an HG Barbatos soooo bad
Wish I can buy myself a kit again. But pandemic exists

Looks like something
That is barbatos when he went on a vacation
