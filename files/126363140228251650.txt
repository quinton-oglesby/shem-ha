who came out of a coma speaking fluent spanish
like there was one kid in hungary
i've heard of it in singlets too
oh golly
uwu
Isn't there some cases of plural systems having new headmates who speak totally other languages?
Y'all know best so I say you guide discussion
What do we want in an outline? If we may discuss the DPRK now
Anyway, serious chat lol
hot
Was sorta waiting until this dies down slightly to make the Definitive Plural Revelation Kommunication, or as I will hearby be calling it, the DPRK
Hi

Mhm!
What do you think would be good for it then?
And would one of y'all mind making Part 2? Just to make sure I don't make any slip ups
Is that draft okay for Part 1?
Courier New?
The Part 2 being an example conversation or something
We could maybe do a Part 1 and a Part 2, only posting the Part 2 if requested
And code Computer, you'll learn to love it
How do you mean?
Second part I was maybe going to write something like ```For example, let's say their was a system called the Sol System. This system may contain Katie (she/her), Ash (they/them) and Lucas (he/him). A conversation may look something like:
[INSERT CONVERSATION OR SOMETHING, IDK]```
That's the first part I was thinking
```--------DPRK DRAFT--------
The easiest, briefest way to describe plurality is, imagine a mecha robot with multiple pilots inside. A single pilot can control the mecha while the others hang out and relax or a few can co-pilot and see what's happening in real time. They can each swap out when they like, although each pilot may get more tired, and if multiple are co-piloting their energy would be collectively drained faster.

That's the jist of it. Obviously (sadly) we don't use terms such as "mecha" and "pilot", so generally, to refer to a single pilot we say "headmate" or just refer to them using their name and preferred pronouns, and to refer to either the body or all the headmates we say "system". Some systems may have a name, for example, the "Sol System".```
sadly? <:ShirabeSob:701475635025019000>
Just so people know how to use words
So, maybe start with the analogy, explain "Plural" and "System" and then give maybe an example of referring to a system or a member?
Thank you for the unprompted recommendation
