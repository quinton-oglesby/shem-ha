The idea is to be relevant to the subreddit while promoting it too.
On May 25th or Tsubasa's birthday we all post symohogear memes on r/animemes to expand our fanbase
A "Feel Better Gwen" card channel or something like that
Indeed
Actually I'm not in it lmao
We support responsibly sourced emotes
Wonderful.
You know how people like being pinged for art of their favorite characters? How about special roles for that?. For example Rady would have the roles "Ping for Kirika (SFW)" and "Ping for Shirabe (SFW)" and whenever art of a character is posted the roles can get pinged
<:CarolFisted:799441471870730252>
Names for this could be :OhThatHibiki: or :MikuDote:
Kanade skillfully dodging bonks
Any nsfw fics and stuff get waterboarded and drowned for 40 days and 40 nights.
It ended up wrongly going to Lily, which caused me to come up with the idea which we both liked.
The last time I submitted a prompt, I looked at the highest ranked online person in the server with the writing prompts role, because there was no role to indicate who was part of the team who managed it.
With all the prompts and stuff, it would be a good idea for people on the prompt team to actually have a role that distinguishes them as such
It says Padrou instead of Padoru
Nevermind, that won't work
But a revision
Well not so much new
Ok...I have a new idea
Suggestion: Make <:HibikiGay:670494484701773845> and <:MikuGay:336656810788388864> even more gay
Kirika looks like a lil dess of culture
He left

Thanks for doing it
I never even saw it
I can send it later
I'm working on a little pronoun page
Can we get an "ask for pronouns" role because adding neos for every person might be tedious, but leaving them without preferred neos also isn't the best idea.
<:GenjuroThumbsUp:336657189475188740>
Can we get it/its pronouns as well?
I see. I was hoping that it would serve as another way to communicate the same info in a manner more consistent with the other roles, if that makes sense.
If the pronoun roles are meant to be third person for others to use, instead of "They/Them" and "We/Us" having "They/Them (Singular)" and "They/Them (Plural)" would make much more sense.
Theyre handy until you hit the wrong one and dm them
The more we bully someone the more the bot will
The place was just too sus for them
So it doesnt have to be a katana then. Could be anything from a scimitar to a messer, correct?
Why a self defense blade like a Katana? Why not a battle oriented one like a tachi or even odachi.
But here is my question.
So to it, humans arent special compared to any other species (besides the fact they have the right anatomy to use a katana)
New reaction video acquired.
Interesting graphic

Time and effort. The higher level you're working at, the less the idea of "inherent talent" becomes relevant and the more relevant learned talent is.
The beginning sounds like it comes out of a T rated DOOM game if that were to ever exist

So shouldn't it be Cags then?

> Because ultimately it's part of a balancing act of being perceptive about the possible issues you might have with others while also not being too judgemental and dismissing people immediately if you find something you dislike
<@279385193045819402> 
How I do that is to show that you see and care but ultimately leave it as their choice to bring it up
It seems there isnt much more to do then wait and hope.
Some like SARS-CoV2 do aerial through the nose, others like Cholera take the fecal oral route and are why we wash our hands, and yet more could go through fluids like Malaria for blood or STIs for ***other liquids***
Different infections take different routes
> Is it worth seeing a doctor for a possible toe infection?
<@84811738653929472> 
Do it. Even if you don't need to they likely have good advice which they won't charge you for.
Ima give it regardless of deserving or not. It's my heart to heart conversation so I get to make sure you get the care you need
<:ChrisHibikiHug:630262562361049121>
I don't, so that's probably why then.
I didnt notice
And there should also be some kind of system for addicts to come clean on their own accord without enforcement.
You remain high for some hours
My bad
Enforcement options to me are like a necessary evil to try and dissuade people from starting, and would probably still have to exist in some form imo, but I do believe that the current enforcement is over blown and much more than we ever need in the US.
Also there is one specific drug law that I absolutely hate. In many states where weed is illegal the tolerance for that when driving is absolutely zero. That seems fine until you realize THC can stay in your body for a month in detectable amounts. You could smoke a joint in Colorado and get arrested for it 4 weeks later.
With most of the criminal system it should be more rehab based.
Or misinterpreted
My bad, I misread
The kind of drugs like weed for example that people are looking to legalize are actually the ones that I believe wouldn't gain from legalization. I believe things like Epi Pens and Inhalers should aim for a less restricted status as those are the medicines that get price jacked for those who need it in a monopolizing fashion, and those are the ones people may need in an emergency.
Like I know it sounds like an ego thing, but it's the kind of opinion a person would call woke if you know what I mean. Lemme just explain this in practice.
Drug decriminalization is one where I feel my opinions stand farther apart from most people's
The right kinds of restrictions can sate peoples needs in a safer way
In principle it was for the people's defense but that's a secondary reason why it also worked
If a mad dog came down the road there was no animal control to call. You had to do it yourself.
The second amendment was written for a time when police response was 30 minutes not 3 minutes. If someone was stealing your cows you were the response time.
The way people handle their guns when they own them is a major thing too. Some people keep their guns at the range and only shoot them for that (if I owned one that would be me). Some get it for home and self defense. Some get it for game hunting. Each reason has different risks for different people.
Alcohol is more of a coordination and judgement problem which still can get the same ends.
> most hallucinogens are also fairly harmless, it was a similar paranoia after weed that hit those
<@213645184125239317> 
They are usually harmless in themselves but if its combined with something like gun ownership or driving lets say, idk, it can get serious.
My best advice would be to try to go to demonstrations, shows, attractions and stuff near you to scout out something that can become a hobby.
<:ChrisHibikiHug:630262562361049121>
If the Libertarian or Green party wants to make something happen they need to get a big name on their side, likely pulling from either of the two big parties.

> Those are the bluest counties in the state, so who knows how they’ll tip the race.
<@445783190976856065> 
I know, they'll make it more blue...
Yep
Palpatine had a better democracy than this
And getting them on the debate stage or something similar is probably the only way that can happen or change.
Change has gotta happen from the bottom up
Illinois is like the only one out of those that still seems to be blue
But if you call all the races now prematurely Trump would win.
They have about the closest percentages as of now
Not much but alas
Wisconsin, NC, and Georgia seem to be at some risk of being flipped as of now.
So a well respected and influential senator with good connections can have more influence over a 40 year career than a president will over an 8 year one, especially if let's say the next president is devoted to undoing the work of the previous one.
Also no term limits on senate
I mean him withdrawing some from the Middle East got him some support (even I support that one) but I still believe his popularity with the military is an overall net loss
Smaller events on up to a statewide scale may happen but it likely doesn't have the federal fuel to cross state lines with ease.
The government itself won't split, and the riots are directed towards city and state governments.
Citizens have been getting rowdy but the government itself hasn't been nearly as volatile
I fucking doubt a civil war will happen
Predicting how this is gonna go is like predicting F1 tire strategies with only AWS insights
And Fenny seems to be saying the former
Cause to me it seems like the states with low percentages have wider Trump margins. This could mean we have a sleeping Biden population that hasn't shown up on our maps yet or that he has it locked out.
> He seems at one, but the situation is far less advantagous then it appears
<@186660127825330177> 
For who?
Just take a look and if something catches your fancy look further into it
Usually there are often loads of demonstrations, shows, museum exhibits etc. if you live near a moderate sized city that have a bunch of different interesting stuff.
not based
And you don't run out of arrows with an arming sword.
I mean if you want to go historical then arming swords out of 1045 steel take less expertise than bows, are somewhat reasonably priced, and has a much faster time between "take out weapon" and actually getting the first attack out.
Bow and arrow for self defense?
A PA flip, it's possible but I doubt it.
Biden is at 69 million, nice
We could see a swap with day of votes on the afternoon in Rocky time as people get off work
Either way Nevada is about as close and has much more undecided than Wisconsin or Michigan
> If it couldn't flip, they'd announce results
<@203444794737950720> 
They just like being sure for the calling.
How do they count their mail ins?
The flip we should be worried about if anything is Nevada
I've been getting into fanfic reading here and I'm following stuff like Symphomonsters, In A Flash the World Begins, and The New Age of Monsters
But VR Chat is better than normal vc because you can get a visual idea of hand and arm gestures which you dont with normal vc
It might not feel much better but looking at it from the outside it's definitely alot better.
Never over till its over.
Well at least try and convince then to try something they haven't
There is probably another game yall can play, like I know Uno is free on Xbox
Finally dead voters have a candidate that will truly represent them well
Yea. Just one more way people can rag on the mail ins.
And that Nevada double flip could be bad PR for Biden if it goes as I predict
Potentially back to 9/11 actually
Arguably since Obama came in our current political wedging apart has been getting stronger
I predict Nevada will flip red when polls close from the wave of red in person voters coming off work but flip back blue from the mail ins
> The only way Trump could hit 269 is to magic Nebraska second out of his ass, which can't really happen
<@278860841485598720> 
Did you mean 270 because if the races were frozen now with no flips he is at 269.
The mail in ballot flip seems to be in sight.
Earlier today Trump had mid 55% in votes, now down to 52.1%
In other news Biden is quite quickly making up ground in PA
> most people who voted for biden... didn't actually vote because they want biden
> they just dont want trump
Welcome to American politics
I doubt AZ is gonna flip at all
Even if by a stroke of luck he takes Michigan, PA has 4 more electorals and Georgia has the same amount so if Biden trades any if those he still wins
Which just shows exactly how much Trump has messed up for a race that seems to be leading to exactly that happening.
Its still possible that the disease can progress from "eh im bed stuck for now but I'm fine enough to send in a ballot" to "fuck I'm dead" in like 2 days
Trump has a slightly wider window to flip in Arizona than Biden in Pennsylvania, AZ has 2% less submitted votes and a 0.2% closer lead
In Nevada Trump doesn't seem to be closing the gap for a flip like he is hoping for.
So we could see a flip there and in PA
And it's down to nearly a 35k difference between Biden and Trump
I know, but the 217 is still more representative of the race than 214
Even if there are still a good 190k to go hes not gonna come back from a 30% vote deficit that easily
Its nearly 2:1 Trump v Biden he's not gonna come back from that
***PLEASE JUST CALL ALASKA ALREADY***
Ah fuck
Biden is also gaining in Georgia, that's gonna be insanely close
Checking again it seems Trump isn't gaining in Arizona much or at all, meanwhile Biden seems to still be gaining in Pennsylvania.
The google map has a really nice UI but I remember somebody saying it stopped getting updated
Who has the best election map to watch rn
Georgia should be GG so when you win it you can say "no re"
So even if AZ flips he also has to do Nevada to pull equal
AZ is 11 electorals and Nevada is 6, Georgia is 16 and Biden was already ahead 1.
TRUMPS CHANCES OF WINNING ARE GONE 🦀 🦀 🦀 🦀
Why say squiggly line when tilda does the trick
Delaying the inevitable probably isn't gonna help them out much
That is a great relief to hear
Well when the minimum to get on to the debate stage is 15% can't exactly fit a 3rd one in well
Someome has gotta go centrist now. The gap is widening so a niche has to be filled at some point.
I mean I don't think the smoking affects it directly, but it does damage your lungs heavily which makes it alot harder to exercise to lose weight.
No, I think each strain that's put in a vaccine only works for itself or other very similar strains
Yeah there are, all of which I'm not of the expertise to say
At this point otokonoko is already taking over as a more accurate term anyway so at that point the term trap is going out of style anyway.
He just didn't really commit until the road was paved ahead of him, which was a lost opportunity
Oh yeah, that man was a madlad too
Basically the malad was campaigning for president not out of the hope of winning so much as getting the 5% vote for that sweet distributed public funding. He did well at 2.74% but ultimately failed.
FUCK OFF WITH THIS *"the password is not complex enough"* BULLSHIT

I'm gonna take a look at Parler to see what's up
Libertarian, Green, and Constitutional parties also have their own poll watchers. And if they had a reason to sound horns against any of the big parties, they would.
Remember, Trump and Biden aren't the only ones running
Here is why I believe there is no fraud
So those would count as mainstream, right?
So the biggest channels in the US in no particular order are Fox, CNN, MSNBC, and CBS
Well speaking of mainstream, what does and doesn't constitute mainstream
Meanwhile Trump was able to pull troops out of the middle east, which is something...

Why would the higher ups ever voluntarily give up power?
Honestly I should take a look at JoJo, just for the sake of knowing every side.
You can count who did vote, not who didn't
And then you have libright just chilling waiting to get more than 5% of the vote
That one is a bit loaded Yami. But for that to be on a Wikipedia page  that front and center does raise oh so many questions.
True. Right now the only people who have been ordered to do anything are police with the BLM protests, and it doesn't seem like there is much dissent either. Its hard to tell how this could apply or reflect if any more drastic actions are taken, but it's still something.
Civil war happens when the military splits, and that hasn't seemed to happen yet.
That's how he won in 2016
Trump still managed to capture that extreme right demographic either way, and he didn't lose too many moderates in the process
*"external government aid"* isnt nearly as severe as full on attempts at occupation
HK wasnt a war declaration, and the HK governmen't weren't explicitly fighting back.
Same here
Libertarian party can't even get 5% for public funding let alone 15% for debate appearances
Anything to disturb the two party status quo
Bruh we need an American Sex Party

For the US, it was a physical one and the taxes England brought upon us. For Russia it was an out of touch and ignorant Tsar.
It starts as a growing divide between the government and the people they're supposed to serve
A full on revolution is only gonna happen if there are guns behind it.
And unless the military splits, we are stuck with a "soft revolution" which is undoubtedly a much better option than full revolution. Because a soft revolution doesn't mandate violence, or forceful removals from power, or many of the ugly bits of an actual revolution.
^ this
Yeah, but at that point you're completley killing an amendment for the US, so as long as we use this 2nd constitution its not gonna be easy to do that, forget Supreme Court stacking.
So we're kinda back to that handgun-rifle dilemma again but with blades instead it seems.
Because of their concealment. Swords are dangerous when you're in combat thanks to their range. Concealed knives are dangerous because of how you get to that point.
Arming swords are about 80cm long, good luck concealing that on your person.
Funny to think that in a world where that passed people could be carrying arming swords again.
No, but I think that it should be considered at some point in the future.
Well if guns aren't nearly the only form of arms outlawing only them would still leave many other forms of arms for people to bear.
Wait, since when are firearms the only kind of arms?
Total ban should be fine then right?
I must have missed it when my dad was talking to me.
> You know what else can be used for wild animals?
<@278860841485598720> 
But it's not as easy to carry on the hike for 3 hours before the chance encounter with the wild animal. I wouldn't have qualms with a total gun ban, but a handgun ban alone would be quite lopsided and one would probably be better off with a full ban.
Wild animal would be a better examplw
I remember seeing a demonstration where a knife assailant was able to close 21 feet before someone armed in concealed carry was able to fire. Thats 6.5 meters.
The kind of role an arming sword would have taken in a Renaissance
Ease of carry means that you would want to have it on a daily basis in case you encounter lets say a mugging.
If you want a full stop ban that's great, but as a targeted restriction it isn't a good idea.
Handguns are important and often sold because of their ease of carry, and they're important for that purpose. Banning handguns might as well be a full stop gun ban.
And hell, maybe a flintlock too
Its not about what you can get but who can get it, because in the vast majority of gun homicides any gun that isn't a flintlock will do the job
Its a catch all term that isnt technical, but works in most cases to get a point across
Especially when most homicides target 1 person alone, having a gun that can kill multiple people isnt exactly helpful in any capacity
Assault weapons are already rare by gun standards so removing that category altogether isn't going to reduce gun homicides like something like nationwide background checks
Its not about what guns people get there hands on then who gets their hands on them
Dont most of the shootings come from disgruntled students? I doubt it would be the kids going there who would be as politically inclined.
The colonial government was an easy place to turn to and say "lead us" and developing nations often dont have that.
Ah
> I feel like living in the US gives you a somewhat warped view of how violent other developed countries are
<@278860841485598720> 
The US was in a special scenario which allowed it to bypass many of the challenges. Many developing countries don't have that.
Imagine if England were to directly control American government with months of input lag. It wouldn't work.
Colonial revolutions have some of the disadvantages reduced because they often already have a semblance of self government which a revolution can already default to.
If Police had less to drive any kind of fear or paranoia, there could be less deaths.
The excuse is often about the victim "reaching for something" which could be a weapon.
In my opinion the police constantly having to be aware of a gun risk does drive alot of the irrational decisions you often see in the news.
Which means the less invested looking for affordable self defense with good stopping power move from the handgun to a blade.
^
So personal risk then.
Is this what you're thinking of?
We could divide that risk into a few categories
Social risk, relationships, reputation
Material risk, gambling, cash prize
Physical risk, harm, injury
And a middle ground between all other forms is Personal risk, self image, sense of accomplishment
I think danger isn't a very good word, risk would be a much better term.
Yeah. Especially with most perpetrators being disgruntled students in bad head spaces, its a single symptom of a greater mental health issue.
That's an interesting way to think
For Lectric it seems her views on the whole gun thing are personal
I think you are missing the important part for her here.
Its an emotional state thats just reflecting into a political view.
So thats why you dont value yourself.
Why don't you want to think that way?
Any altruism is simply impossible to derive happiness from after your death, so it really doesn't work out that way.
You might think that its a simple trade of your life vs revolution, but there are so many more factors known, unknown and unknowable that its not anywhere near simple.
Well you aren't wrong about that one lmao
Im not saying it isnt good, im saying that handguns only is a subpar intermediate, and it should go one way or the other.
If your school is an elementary, I dont know what to tell you except maybe you shouldnt be on discord.
Wasnt that an elementary school?
With my racing im lucky to have a dad that doesn't let the idea of living vicariously through me doesn't cloud his judgment.
There's somewhere to start
Take notice of things you see on the street. A cat. A car. A billboard. Take just 5 seconds to think about them. If you want to, take a little more.
Well its a good time to go to an expert to get an evaluation on that
Tis fucked
Ive heard about all the jokes about it being revenge for bad games or whatever, but seeing that now its just a swatting, that kind of relatively low effort crime is enough to have that kind of motive.
In the article apparently people are barricading the entry to the roof, which could mean that many found a temporary escape and are safe up there.

<:KirikaSalute:620069889838809089>🇺🇸
When your total student debt is larger than most countries national debt
Its a good example of the differences of the economies so thats why I brought it up. Slavery, the tariff issue and others are all symptoms of that greater economic divide.
When you have two economies under one set of laws conflicts are bound to emerge on which system gets prioritized.
Slavery wasn't the only issue the south worried about. Another good example of North vs South economies was import tariffs. The south sells cotton to England, and for the sake of argument lets say England makes hats with it. They ship those hats back to sell in the US. The north also makes their own hats. With a hat tariff the north would benefit as their hats are cheaper than English ones, but the south would hurt because English hats aren't profitable in the US.
It was about both those issues and many more, but slavery is an easy narrative to follow when history is written by the winner, and ignoring the fact that a primary reason the north didn't have it was because their economy wouldn't profit off of it like the south did. You have the north wrongly projecting their own economic policies on the south, the south hurting but irrationally using that as justification refusing to abandon the horrors of slavery, and the slaves getting caught up in the middle from the wrongs committed on both sides.
It's fucked.
Like we pretend slavery was the only thing the Civil War happened over and then just omit the fact many abolitionists wanted to ship black people back to Africa.
Slavery has been twisted so many ways in its use as ammunition, justification and blame politically and historically its sad.
On account of not being trump
Pence would be a more popular pick among the swings and moderates, but I doubt he could seemingly pull votes out his ass we could never predict like Trump did
Opinion: If there is a such a strict minimum age for president there should also be a maximum.

The Vice?
A few days before he will probably silently take a small and unrecognizable private jet to the Mar a Lago. That's my prediction.
I doubt
I think those votes that we didn't predict are the far right and fringe groups. His tactic had him attack alot of things without really seeming to support much outside of himself, which means that more likely than not something he threw against a wall would stick with a given group.
Oh those guys

On the other hand separating us from the animals makes it less likely to happen period
Yeah, farm animals are basically the #1 source of zoonosis
> yes they aren't doing that anymore but I always wonder how that's desirable from an animal rights perspective
Instead of cooking the entire equator in a carbon dioxide shaped stove we just send a few cows to the slaughterhouse
***meat berries***
> killing all the animals
And since all the cows are dead, they arent burping and farting out greenhouse gases anymore
If we can get those vegan replacements up to par taste and texture wise I wouldnt be oppposed.
Honestly considering how much carbon output it makes stopping meat doesnt sound like much of a bad thing
Im talking about intimidation here tho
Yeah, but it can also mean use force too
Using your greater military power as a way to better strong arm other countries in negotiations.
So while you are gonna need a big battery, you have a better way of carrying one too.
But what you gain is the ease of getting the energy from storage into the gun. With any military rifle you gotta take the magazine from the dedicated holder and insert it into the gun. With a laser gun, you can carry a big capacitor on your back and it goes in with no fuss through a wire.
> how much damage can that do compared to a bullet?
<@183785454447886346> 
Probably not much. Damage is probably gonna be collateral if anything.

Case and point: Nelson Piquet. He could hustle a car around a track sure, but calling Senna a Sao Paolo taxi driver isn't the classiest thing to do.
Each person has their own positive and negative aspects, but its still not a good idea to use someone's positive aspects to ignore their negatives.
The "what would someone do" thing I usually see when acting in someone's stead for example, like if youre working on something the other person wasn't able to complete lets say.
Thats why I have specific aspects of different people I look up to. Senna was an amazing driver and a great philanthropist, but he just doesn't seem like the guy I would enjoy talking to at all off track.
For me its a few people. For their on track performance and his philanthropy, Aryton Senna and Lewis Hamilton. For their off track demeanor, Lando Norris, Daniel Riccardo, and Sage Karam.
I have a question for you guys, who do you aspire to be like or look up to?
Because every mistake helps you learn to make a relationship more sustainable for you and your partner.
Its a trial and error process, one where doing it wrong is literally the most critical part of doing it right
I'm not gonna drag this on. But I am gonna say this. You shouldn't justify leaving yourself in a bad place mentally because "it's my punishment." If you arent harming someone else by getting yourself better by all means work to make it so.
If neither is an obvious option that's up to you who to decide to talk to about it.
What about family members?
Well I can't tell you much. I can say that you're gonna have to find someone yourself. Whether they're a romantic bf/gf, a trusted acquaintance, a cousin or whomever it may be, they're probably not gonna come falling from the sky.
Being in a relationship isn't the default in life and we should stop pretending like it is. It's not some requirement to live or be normal or whatever, and its not something you just fall into. It's a conscious effort and unconscious agreement to go out of your way for someone else and vice versa.
It's not just your brain that can be utilized as a way to not feel like shit. We're here to help too.
At that point, you could probably either push yourself into the friendgroup or you can walk out of it. But this halfway state of flux is likely not a good one.
Well you gotta change something. If you're looking for a clean break or a chance at some kind of opportunity, you dont want to stop moving. Always look for new opportunities to make new friends or strengthen bonds with existing ones. And don't just plan, execute. Eventually after you try anything alot results are likely to emerge. So while there isnt a single answer on what you should do, there is a good answer on what you shouldn't, and that's stagnating.
Yeah, that's gonna be a challenge. And it's also all the more reason to jump on that if anything arises that could give you a chance.
So show them the you internally that's much more than your appearance.
Realize that you arent the only one out there in that dilemma, and there are people currently going through and who have previously gone through similar experiences that can help.
The hard part about quarantine is that it makes it harder for you to find other people who are going through the same thing as you to connect with. Think about it like this. How many people around you know about this dilemma, and then how many people on the street or on the television do you see every day who could be going through a similar thing to you?
Quarantine won't last forever.
No, it just means you're set back from the start. Where you go from there is down to a multitude of factors.
They follow the same etymology. Even someone who hasn't heard the term before could probably get an idea of the meaning.
Tomgirl seems like a good idea for me. Plus it still preserves the meme potential in "need tomgirl bf" for example.
Literal, on the nose, but idk about connotation and it's a bit long to say.
Ima be honest idek know the answer to this one so that's why I'm asking for a second opinion here.
What if a crossdresser refers to themselves as a trap?
Now I present a much harder situation which I have encountered myself online.
Honestly depending on the region or whatever culture has the greater influence I think both could work
Otokonoko
Because asking someone to reconsider something can be seen as condescending depending on the context.
Id perhaps word it like this. "In our society heterosexuality is considered the norm, so I wouldn't be suprised if some of the straight people here might unknowingly be otherwise"
Might wanna watch out on the connotation there
For the full mannerisms tomgirl is still my choice, with otokonoko a close second.
b*oks 🤮
Maybe a better way to say it would be "more activities where all the people I need are usually right here" cause some people are more available than others

They're both classified under the neurodivergent umbrella and share some symptoms
Alot of the things you've said also apply with my experience on ADHD
Hmm, fair enough. I see what you mean, but I'm wondering where the difference really emerges between what you and I have.
I remember hearing somewhere that to save energy the human brain has loads of complex systems of assumptions, presumptions and automatic conclusions. Does it ever feel like sometimes some of those are missing, and that you have to think through things that other people seemingly don't have to?
That kind of reminds me of something. I'm no doctor or anything, but I want to hear what you think
If you're thirsty that is
If you're better at remembering to charge it than I am, try something else like getting a glass of water.
Maybe trying something like that can help you a bit.
I've been trying to overcome that slowly by in my case, no matter how tired I am I always make sure that my phone is charging before I go to bed. Something as insignificant as going downstairs to get it has built me up a small tolerance against that.
I feel you dude.
No, don't make this any more complicated than it needs to be.  I need to keep my sanity to spend another day.
No, don't you dare confuse my brain like that.
But is it a problem we can just cut our losses and deal with?
That's a problem.
Oh fuck
For the longest time I thought it was the music and salways confused me
Oh yeah, now I do
To be specific, the primordial ooze of internet culture known as 4 chan
Didn't expect that
Maybe that means it was derived from the term "tourist trap"
Crossdresser is dress alone, tomgirl reaches beyond that.
Usually the definition of tomboy isn't just dress but also overall mannerisms so it's probably the same for a tomgirl.
They can correlate, but they're two separate things.
Stand your ground outside of castle doctrine deals with when you aren't in a place that could be considered safety by default, ie an alleyway. Therefore retreat is almost guarenteed to bring you to a safer place.
Your own home or vehicle is a safety in it's own way, abandoning it would be trading one danger for another in many cases.
Panic isn't rationalized or calculated, its panic. Laws that address panic like its a math equation simply don't work which is why we have to agonize over this. It's an inherent flaw that can't be easily fixed, but one I believe we may have to live with for an effective castle doctrine.
Cause being forced out of your own home thanks to a duty to retreat law can cause many more problems than moving from a public space to anywhere else reasonable.
To me stand your ground is a tentative no, castle doctrine is a solid yes
That would count.
cause the term is "legally occupied place" and I doubt you have a suitcase big enough to comfortably stay in
I doubt most courts will buy that
Cause even with duty to retreat castle doctrine is still usually treated as an exception as the castle is safety in itself
being in your car would fall under castle doctrine right?
They can choose to buy or not buy it
Depends on whether juries buy that bullshit
KKK is still a thing but it seems they don't have the means to be as active anymore
ie salmon
Browns are the ones who have coastal resources
Same species, separate subspecies
Bears follow duty to retreat with caste doctrine from what I've heard. They run away unless it's their den and their cubs are vulnerable.
I'm curious now
Or black or brown bears too
arming swords can do that too, but if you want reach go longsword. Spears were made useful in the prescence of shields and horses often, spear alone isn't your best option.
Same logic behind pepper spray tbh
anything that causes enough pain to deter the animal attack
Those are called guard dogs
And at that point you're not far above arming sword length
By the time they get over 1.5m you're gonna be having pack animals carry those spears for you
Spears are good for throwing, but spears are also long and very harder to carry on ones person
They go for as cheap as $100
If you want something with that much reach and stopping power while being infinitely lighter pick up a well made 1045 steel replica arming sword.
Well bats are hard to store on one's person
You own a car but aren't allowed the keys so to speak
Yeah, urban environments are basically the #1 place you don't need one.
I believe gun carry's merits isn't so much in protection from other people as against wild animals. You can outrun someone charging at you. You can't outrun wild animals. And that is what I believe the conversation should be on with gun control. I'm not justifying gun ownership, but rather stating that most debates miss a large part of why one would want one for defense.
Yeah. It's a problem for us, not them.
Calling out a government destroys your relations with them, and blaming the people generates massive backlash and is just a dick move. Thanks to this, any attacks on a country has to be nebulous and half assed which allows people to draw their own conclusions, often hateful ones.
Yeah, there is the big problem
That's how you get humane disasters like the Vietnam War or Operation Condor
Yeah, some say we might have justification, but by no means do we have a right to act like "us" and "them" are the only ones in the equation that matter
Now we don't have nearly as strong as a them outside our borders we turn our eyes inward.
Or anyone south of the Rio Grande
Or italians
Or islam
Whether the "them" was native Americans, African Americans, or communists
Us vs Them was always ingrained in american culture
Yea lmao, arming swords lookin kinda fine tho out here at 1.1kg
my b
Wait no its 15
Or 7 lbs
Zweihanders are like 3kg I thought
Nobody wears armor like that today.
Morning star and mace were preferrable against armor (especially plate) thanks to their concussive force
Something actually made to defend yourself with would probably work better than something that sends balls really far away
Not many people have owned a bat to fight anything
Fenny brought up a thing about bats and I said arming swords would be way better than bats for convenience
When you can't blame those darn commies for all of your problems I guess you gotta find someone to point at
On hikes, yes. For every day stuff, lets just say the *arming* sword got it's name for a reason
fair point. Extra mechanics and cost, but if you could mechanize the process costs would go down alot
How the hell are you gonna carry around a spear that's taller than you?
The question here is
Isnt it called 8kun now?
This isn't one that popped up by chance, someone figured out this was an effective way go viral.
And assuming this account is fake, it proves just how powerful a well engineered meme can be.
I think people just want to believe its real for the meme value
First post on the account too
Yeah. How could it not be a troll.
Also how this account got so much traction on this tweet alone kinda baffles me unless you had other people intentionally spreading it to give it traction
This trolling seems to be just out of straight malice with not much greater intent
This is another example of what I'm talking about
This is the kind of trolling I'm talking about, and I would guess this is probably just people trolling for their own enjoyement
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_jQFi7TvaQ
Like that troll account on twitter, Journalist Katie? That kind of trolling.
Watching people in the comments rip their hair out in arguments
Just out of schaudenfreude tbh
I have no basis or evidence on this, but I have a gut feeling that there are probably entire small discords or other communities based around systematic trolling. Again, no evidence, gut feeling.
Similar economy and industry (the entire canadian auto industry is basically america #2), location, terrain, etc
Canada is honestly the best example.
You know how many fake SJW anti gamer troll accounts are out there on twitter? It's mind boggling, and people still act like it's real.
Which is an even bigger thing
When it comes to trolling some people are like:
A low possibility is better than no possibility
Yeah, but even having the capability to such in theory is useful, as it means a large public backlash could make something happen
But without FOI, there is no theory or practice on matters like this.
even if russia did have one I doubt it could get far in practice
and if citizens have no FOI capability they're not gonna have a reliable way to take legal action against their government
Lmao same with our prisons
Birth rates are just goin down and down as existing becomes more expensive it seems
Yeah. There's a reason nobody has invested in a large scale racing facility south of Bologna.
Well most
All the merchant cities were historically in the north, right?
Eventually someone might want their money back, and that could be a massive problem for everyone involved.
The thing about an NHS that would worry me is worsening the national debt.
No I'm just referencing how the US doesn't have any universal healthcare.
Wait, you guys have a NHS?
<:Rosberg:714097789105209455>
Their lawyers have almost as bad a record as George Russel's teammates.
Why haven't the other smaller parties also joined in on such a suit if there was fraud.
The US doesn't ***only*** have two parties. Sure only two actually have a chance at winning, but the others are still running and present with their poll watchers.
You know how I believe there isn't?
2-14 days
Ah yes, I love US overpriced medicine
Fuel crisis, 07, and Rona
Some people have gotten 3
I personally can't imagine ever having money
Dropped at the Housing Market Crash tho
We also had a smaller peak in the 90s when our economy was pretty good again.
Life was good, so we made more lives
For example: the entire baby boom
If there is one man who would pull this kind of shit it would be Elon Musk ngl
Oooooh
What metal obelisks...
Religion, mythology and how they were interpreted.
"And his feet like unto fine brass..." is mentioned in Revelations 1:15
But I do believe a verse does mention something along the lines of "having feet like copper"
Depends on who he is born to. If he is born to someone of roman descent (as they were the ones occupying the area at the time) there is a fair chance. But if he was born to two people who were native to that area the chance goes down to low but not impossible.
Yeah, they have many pretty strong oral traditions but writing systems either aren't as common as europe or aren't as well documented.
It's a saddening story but a good read.

Yeah. But either way you are here, you are around and I'm grateful for that.
That was an 8GB patch for a 4GB game
There are many kinds of dysphoria, but what trans people usually refer to is gender.
No, there are different risk factors that are more likely to lead to different kinds of dysphoria.
Dysphoria in itself is often more of a symptom if anything. Many underlying causes aren't disease at all but other things like grief, financial hardship, and other difficulties in life. Dysphoria is more of an effect than a cause in itself.
In fact the girl in that article herself is the one I've talked to about it before.
Yeah, I've heard all about the latter.
Nice
*"... said defendant did use and exhibit a deadly weapon, to wit: a Tweet and a Graphics Interchange Format (GIF) and an Electronic Device and Hands, during the commission of the assault."*
And wasn't it still glitchy as fuck after that
Exactly, what is there can lead down a slippery slope. It's not the danger itself, but it's a few steps away from it.
Lolicons aren't inherently dangerous, its what they can lead to and correlate with which is the problem.
Honestly Green party is kinda what we need rn
If mainstream democrats were gone then either the DSA or Green may take it's place.
Is...that normal for you...?
Yeah, that's what we're all going for here.
And then it starts again.
They blame x person or y person for keeping it going.
But do they end it? No.
Everyone: we should end this
Everyone: takes way to long to end it
Long has. This was just the nail in the coffin.
That at leasts takes out some of the roadblocks.
The first thing we can do is loosen the strangle hold corporations have on politics, price restrictions on medicine, anti trust and pro competition legislation etc.
In other news, water is wet.
It's the ideal, but not one that you can switch to right away
I thought as long as two people can trade stuff capitalism can exist
It's an emergent behavior that can come from anarchy.
Would tribalism count as a laid back form of anarchism
I believe they're viewed positively not out of reverence but pity. Seen like whining children who talk alot but can't get stuff done with a lack of maturity by those against them, and futile attempts at change by those who support them.
But if nobody is in them, then is it really viewing them favorably, or just politely dismissing them?
Anyone know a good way to find organizations i agree with
***and if you close your eyes, does it almost feel like nothing changed at all***
***Poland shudders fearfully***
Most are not brave enough for politics
Yet it still had its many problems and hiccups
The US had
It's own identity
It's own commanders (some F&I veterans)
And it's own government
It only had to separate what was already there. There wasn't much to build comparably
The fact that it's there is enough for at least a bit of stability.
The only reason colonial independence revolutions like the US are so romanticized is because they had a relatively orderly government right there to take up the reins.
If we had a good, centralized and effective NHS that could be a start in the first centralization of a given market.
Dude, I wouldn't be mad about that, we're here for you so that's nothing to worry about dude.

Being wiser doesn't make one any less of an asshole, it just gives more experience in being one

STV FTW
Really eye opening video on lifestyle and stuff. Give it a watch. https://youtu.be/LO1mTELoj6o
Is this like one of those DARE situations?
Id say its more a message that "the backing you have isn't unconditional"
The offenses exempted are just a low priority and not important relative to what's staying in place.
But when it comes to political dissent, whether we like it or not the show must go on
That's a fair assessment.
If someone is at the metaphorical round table and everybody ignores or speaks over them, they might as well not be there
Yep, and that's the issue.
Politics is not about making the most equal playing field, its about making it the least shit one...one where we take the compromises we can deal with and eliminate the problems we can't.
Here is a list of the current manufacturers who can do hypers for example
Intamin
B&M
Mack
Vekoma
RMC
S&S
The true competition is in ride manufacturers
And while park competition is there
Cause about that area I think
How far does the Gold Coast extend?
East-Southeast coast
Yeah, exactly. When theme parks get bunched in one hot spot area competition gets high
Big time tourist areas tend to have much tighter competition (i.e Orlando)
Fair enough
There are still loads of independent parks, and the ride manufacturers are even more diverse
Kinda the opposite of what you wanna do if you're gonna be the "budget chain"
But yeah, we have 3 big chains in the US of Six Flags, Cedar Fair and SW/BG
It's almost like buying 20 coasters a year for millions each is a bad financial decision
At least the amusement park industry isn't one in the US...yet
***Disney changing copyright laws for the millionth time intensifies***
Or...occasionally we make AI that makes AI. Machine learning has given us the benefit of having our job done for us in an infinitely more efficient way with the downside of now knowing how the fuck any of it works.
Japan really had alot of time to drift compared to places like Korea or China thanks to the centuries of isolation, so I don't think China and Korea would make a good comparison.
So you end up with the worst of both worlds
Yeah, but having it in a non contradictory way can be used to send a message of "somebody out there is gonna see money in it" They take the uncanny valley route of both not playing off it to make it work or not abstaining from it
Fair point. But if if they're gonna justify it cause Ann's a model, not giving others the same standard only makes it all the worse.
Objectification is fine if it's fairly distributed. Cause I don't really get why Ryuji isn't given his own dose seeing as he's a fit, lean and strong athlete.
Here's a thought. It's possible that they are oblivious to how much effort you are putting in to pass it because they think that its likely you will pass.
Exams for college?
What's happening?
That's fine
An early victory might set a precedent for the war.
me included
and even then that's westernized and often has Caribbean culture tossed in there too
But the main prescence food from africa has in the US is soul food
<a:KEKLOL:686644945490411549> pro gamer move
***~~not as good as soviet food~~***
And Polynesian culture too
Same with...like every nation in the continent of Africa excluding egypt
Literally every eurobeat album
Touge, highway racing, drifting, bosuzoku show cars, rally, you name it japan has it
car culture
Japan has also played off another culture it is absolutely teeming in
Fair enough
China and Russia, the boogeymen of the world
What if the difference in culture is what makes foreign cartoons seem better? Stuff that is stale to them seems new to us.
And Rick and Morty could arguably be one of those exceptions
Period.
If modern family guy were new it would not survive.
So it has always had this idea of being unique and unexplored to westerners
You could argue this dates back to the late 1800s and early 1900s, Japan was one of the last areas to be westernized
Anything that factored into modern korea or china's culture is pretty far removed in most cases for Japan
Not to say Nikita isn't fast, but he has a less than respectable track record and demeanor...
You see talents like Callum Illot and Robert Schwarzman get passed up for Nikita Mazepin thanks to his dad's backing, who has a $9B net worth btw.
By far the biggest color problem isn't black or white but green and gold
Oh tell me about it
And when one colored person does make it to the top of a white man's sport, it almost curses the others who follow to be compared to him. Lewis Hamilton, Willy T Ribbs, Mohammed Ali etc.
Always interesting to hear your views on things\
For example soccer and football is dominated by AAs compared to lets say motorsports
Sports in the western world is always an interesting thing for african americans
I'd rather not be seen as anything to them so i don't have to deal with the,
Yeah. That annoys people so it counts.
Being annoying isn't usually seen as a good thing, but dammit it ain't illegal either.
Albert Park has good racing most years
They ever been to the GP there?
I think if it's a plant it's probably a RWBY fan parody

Cause if you do slip the medical bills will put you in permanent debt
At least cigarette industry could make F1 car go brrr. But food? Not nearly as much.
Tobacco
Idk how innovative $30 for a cough drop is, but ok
It's also why the US spends 3.6 trillion a year on healthcare which is a way larger margin than anyone else without a true NHS
With those massive costs no wonder distrust of doctors is so high
While in the UK for example it usually doesn't exceed 600 GBP
Price regulation for anything medical is just so lax that CT scans can easily cost >$1000
Definitely
Like I think only 9 states and DC require one year of civic education in HS
Yeah, but jokes aside civics education in the US is pretty sorely lacking
And then they go further...and further...and further than that. Until by the end of a bachelors we can do calculus but can't do our taxes
The amount of people who bought that bullshit could range from 0 (not even trump) to like tens of millions and it scares me

At least it's not as confusing as the US M_ naming scheme
Yeah, I thought so but Mel worded it confusingly.
Is the Trident specific to nukes or conventional or can it launch both?
Fair enough then
How is a nuclear sub a boomer? Old design?
Part of why many African cultures and native american cultures are under represented is that European colonizers simply assumed an oral culture meant that they didn't have one at all, and so only recently techniques for preserving oral culture has truly been created.
They aren't a strong enough force to get one to happen probably
That's nice
Moors did their Zerg rush across the old world and Bob's your uncle
Yeah, that's actually allot of north africa currently.
I the reason why Egypt of all places is so over represented on the continent is because they had a written language and lots of crossover with both the Greeks and Romans.
Mishmash of European, various African cultures, some Carribean and some completely new emergent stuff
Corporations are people with all induvidual desires taken away. Everyone's sense of morality and integrity is different, and those differences are stripped away, like a tree is stripped of it's branches. In the end, only the trunk remains, the pillar of profit that siphons the lifeblood of the company up and up to the top.
What's moloch?
Eiai Promise was just about gals being pals

That's only cause the corporations who are living want them to for the sweet <a:frogeMoney:621285872083664936>
This tbh. They're dead, so what about those who aren't.
Really makes you realize how many or few companions you have
We don't know if the dog has a habit or if it's a one off thing
Yeah, I've always heard that for the UK as an example, NHS waits are just insane
Like lemme give a throwaway example. It's not being bad at math that would worry me, but rather having trouble with the homework.
Idk for me it isn't any quality that I lack confidence in but rather what could happen.
Yeah. That just sounds like them trying to be both supportive and funny at the same time, but just coming off as callous if anything.
Yeah. Its just a miscommunication
This tbh. I've had me and my sister mistaken for eachother and although I doubt it's been anything more than comedic for us, I can definitely see how it can hurt other people
We had an outage too this morning, I doubt it had anything to do with that tho
I feel u.
Oof, that's not good.
Good luck with it dude.
Oof.
A chance that it just slipped his mind
Well ask him about PB next time
Dysphoria can be anything from gender based to thinking your feet are too big. This probably counts.
Being healthy means a better sex drive too.
Yep, definitely get that checked out, and double check the chemical pathways and side effects of whatever you're taking with your doctor
Its no immediate change, but it's still going to slowly come back.
Here is another thing, alot of it is with the current state of things, its hard to truly feel at the top of your game. But things change and and as the vaccine is distributed and the pandemic lifts and morale improves and the world becomes safer and activities resume, that also means that the "current state of things" will be better than before. So to boil it down, every second longer you can go is a step forward in itself.
But the feminist movement of the time ended up getting the she and her pronouns into much greater use which is probably for the better

Have you seen Shadiversity's video on the whole Wonder Woman 1984 situation?
Oh god you're turning into the US now
Fair enough then
A youtuber who is 20 can still exploit an 18 year old in scummy ways. While age isn't what sticks out like a sore thumb in this situation, the youtuber part still can have many of the same implications an age gap can.
Anything particularly remarkable about today?

We dont want people to have these problems to be framed as obstacles everyone has to find it in them to overcome. They are problems and should be portrayed as such.

Yeah, the protien heads can still change every season every time the virus mutates
Or even anywhere with adequate safety
Anywhere with alot of unsafe animal and human interaction could have had something similar.
With the emergence of the new rodent version?
Yeah. The viruses emergence can't really be said to be someone's fault like...let's say a lackluster response. When it emerges you don't know its there so prevention can only go so far, so blame for that is usually pretty misguided.

Damn, this is just...insane. I can't even try and joke about it to just sidestep how surreal this all is, cause reality just keeps hitting like a train.

Senate is back in the chamber
These guys can't even agree who's protesting
Yeah, I can see that.
It says she was just behind, but still. If you break into the second most important building in the entire American political system and expect a warm welcome, sorry to tell you about reality.
So she was in the building, just outside the Senate chamber and possibly attempting to gain entry into the chamber.
Just to be clear about the situation with the girl, in the article it says the following
"The woman appeared to be standing behind a group of people who were attempting to gain entry into the chamber. Police had barricaded the doors and were attempting to keep the patriot protesters out — and then drew their weapons. They opened fired and shot her."
Ok so I checked Parler and...
So there is the square and the triangle...what about the rectangle and circle?
The platform Parler must be having an absolute shitfest right now
I JUST HAD A THOUGHT
The lowercase l is smaller than the lowercase d, while the uppercase I is the same height as the lowercase D
Yeah, they're talking like the bulk of the BLM protests haven't already gone by.
No as in not foreigners or no as in not the military's thing
The CSA

Often life just doesn't give you choices like that tho, we're here for you.
For example stuff like Charlottesville did have a notable police presence (although they were ineffictive)
Let's say hypothetically it is sabotage. That makes the most sense, as your everyday BLM protest would have no need for sabotage.
Suspicious but it's by no means evidence.
If we are gonna draw conclusions so quickly we might as well be just as misguided QAnon followers
I'm not gonna jump to any conclusions
That one was the 6th. To clarify, he wasn't the Antichrist yet, but just excommunicated for the first time (it happened again)
The one that was led by the Antichrist did. He was able to get Jerusalem through diplomacy.
Fair enough then.
Discussions happen, and people learn alot from them. As long as they don't get hostile (which they rarely do here) starting discourse is a good thing.
Finding good friends elsewhere...i.e. online
Maybe I don't. I don't know how she talks cause I haven't heard her. But in the end, it's more likely than not any refusal is gonna boil down to that.
Worst case scenario, she says she can't do it right now.
If she's down there maybe you can text her and ask her to bring something up cause your hunger is distracting.
And get something quick
Ask to excuse yourself like you're going to the bathroom
In person or virtual?
Well now would be a good time to get yourself something to eat then
Oh yeah, that's the first step. If you truly feel thirsty, drink water don't delay. Even I struggle with that occasionally. But taking a proactive attitude to something as small as that is just one way you can improve.
Fine, it dont have to be yelling. It can be however you want, but I still want to encourage you.
But which option have you been exploring unsuccessfully for a while and which option have you not explored? Fizzy, I know this might sound odd but if you need someone to personally yell at you to do something to get you to do it I would be right there man.
Rn it seems like not doing gives more.
I leave the idea of doing "something" vague not because I dont know what will work, but because there are so many things that can, some better than others.
Anything you choose to do yourself is something that you have a will to do, so not doing anything or capitalizing on any small or insignificant desires you may have won't help.
I've kinda learned that what you can do about it, is something. I know that sounds super vague, but hear me out here.
Depends if anything new or more damning comes out
Actually "made the cut" would be a bad way to word it...
You got better, and made the cut. That's what matters here.
Makes me think about those who didn't change in time, and were cut off...
This has turned...contradictory
You don't really have an obligation to be active anywhere you don't moderate. You still keep in contact with those close to you from here and that's just fine.

Yea, the Turkish phenomenon the term was birthed from itself is still a bunch of separate entities with goals that only sometimes align. But even in the Turkish example, many of the accounts come from much more reputable sources than anything you'll find talking about it in the US (namely two Turkish presidents)
If it's so large and powerful, there will be internal schisms and power grabs that fracture and divide, traitors that leak and expose, and it would simply collapse under it's own weight.
The idea that there is one unified deep state just doesn't sit at all with me.
For example in the US habeas corpus is suspended

The article states "There was no threat to the public, officials said." I'd guess that it means the fire wasn't from someone trying to light a bunch of em.
The article also mentions "Security is tight, with thousands of National Guard members deployed."

The kind of governments the US installed to stop communism were similarly horrible to the ones put on podiums as examples against the spread and viability of communism.

WSB - Wall Street Boosts
I feel like Discord is the one company that could theoretically be innocent in this.
I'd say it's probable that Discord were giving extra vigilance/attention to WSB so they could jump on something.
They have to give info on their policies for use/service, their policies on content moderation, their public statements related to that, their communications with mods/admins/owners of the server, enforcement against the server, communications inside and outside the company about the server, and any other servers they've taken action against (all since 1/1/2021)
Discord restricted access to the r/WallStreetBets discord.
Lemme summarize it. The trading companies have to give documents explaining restrictions on trading w/ reasons, give copies of public statements related to those restrictions, give copies of communications inside and with outsiders about the restrictions, and give documents explaining restrictions on trading securities again w/ reasons (all since 1/1/2021).

So it doesn't make sense at all for the author to write like that, unless the author was self-inserting as Naofumi.
Yeah, it's my belief that the author themselves got caught up in the idea of the winner always being good, and that influenced the work in many ways it shouldn't have. As far as I can tell, Naofumi isn't the narrator and a 3rd party is.
The more I think about it Shield Hero is starting to sound more and more like it's a recounting by Naofumi himself rather than some outside narrator, like history (or in this case just story) being determined by the winner. Naofumi in the end won in a way, so he gets put in a positive light in places and at times where he really shouldn't.
As opposed to the generic walgreens slave owner.
Let me put it like this.
You shouldn't be.
Discussions will be had, no reason to be sorry
I always thought Islam was strong since the Moors rose to power.
Not all fear has reason behind it. Why do humans fear harmless and non poisonous spiders way smaller than we are?
And that's a good idea, dealing with it alone can often be alot harder.
However, for me at least there are alot of things that I don't really get, but I just try and roll with and accept anyways. It might be different for you, but that's my experience at least.
Extremists aren't fun to meet at all, and I can get why you wouldn't want to meet one.
Is that accurate?
Yeah, I think I'm starting to get what you mean. It's not trans people itself, but rather they're a catalyst for something else.
Are you saying that the contact made you think about yourself and your sexuality in a different light?
In a way that it makes you question the long established ways you've seen that part of yourself?
How so?
Cause I wanna help you.
No I'm gonna bother myself with you anyway.
We can encourage and advise you on many of those matters.
You have us, you don't gotta handle it all alone.
And I'm good with that.
Well now we're telling you more than you can talk about it, but that you should. If we need to tell you that once, ten or 100 more times i guess ill be here for a while.
It's already in the pile, believe it or not. So better to try and take it out of there.
I fully believe that you do. However, I also believe the best way to show it is to act on it.
Use the full breadth of you house/apartment and more outside of it if possible
Staying in one spot for everything isnt a good idea
You already have. You've told us, and we're here to help you out with it.
When you get yourself in the right positions for them to happen, these miracles become alot more reachable.
You gotta give a little push to make it happen. You still gotta buy a ticket to win the lotto, or buy a chocolate bar to get a ticket.
There isn't one solution, but there are people whose jobs are to be solution finders, and present those solutions, and aid you in executing them. And those are the people we believe you will benefit from the most.
I can get the expense part. But the job thing is just pointing to that as some all powerful solution, which is irrational.
Yeah, I think this is a good idea.
Some of the greatest people humanity has ever had did the job of wondering how the world works. Even the people we put on the highest of pedestals for being knowledgeable still knew so little.
You made an interesting discussion happen at least for me with your questions, no need to apologize man.
Since the Umayyad Caliphate encountered the Byzantines iirc
As migration has become more common, it's easy to see 1 more Muslim face on the street each day and think there is more, when in actuality each new face here is a face that isnt elsewhere.
I think the illusion of them becoming stronger is only that they've become more relevant in the western world.
Learning is what helps condition, so a condition to learn is any condition you wish to be improved.
Please do.
Chances to learn should be take when they arise, so keep going bro.
No, I think it's a good thing you did
Through taxation or ccp partial ownership?
People like Genshin. But what did Genshin actually do, cause I didn't see much on it.
Anyone who talks for him could be thrown under the bus if they need to, but he can't do that to himself unless he has a puppet to pass the torch onto
He wasn't making suits to win in the first place. He was doing it for appearances.
He needs to work up enough of a team to make his followers think he isn't giving up
I'm no contamination expert but my point here is that time will continuously add more you on top of...well...you. So something like this which you see as a major blemish now will dilute and become less revelant over time.
Think of it like radiation. For any object that's been exposed to radiation, it's radioactivity decreases over time after exposure is ended. You can clean and sanitize it to further reduce the affect of the exposure, and after good sanitation and a few half lives it's more likely than not safe to handle.
There is still alot you can do to change that.
I didnt know that.
Pharios. It's late where you are. Please sleep. You're gonna need the rest dude.
It's certainly a step in the right direction.
in both, treating as early as possible is usually a good idea
To not pay more
Or if they have already paid
Unless you engage with them encouraging them to *not* pay and stay F2P
Shouldn't paying for microtransactions be the money maker here?
Also, how does *playing* Genshin give them money?
I feel like it's only a matter of time until XXd gets disappeared like so many others did.
He has to use his own car
Xu Xiaodong can't even take public transportation to his fights
Yeah, social credit is really effective in that.
Can we screw over the Chinese stock market like the US did to their own?
We still have listed out many ways that aren't effective, what about the ways that *are*?
Boycotting microtransactions is better bang for buck, because ***it saves you*** buck
It's simple, but not exactly effective if you're a F2P
To get the most effect.

So how about this

So...return to monke?
More than the first two?
Interesting
Didn't Pinochet have an economic policy similar to that?
You'd have to go back to single called organisms to get that far
Which takes away what makes monkes into monkes
Monke is only obsolete when people wanna be better monkes
But if and how could that change, and how close could it be to today?
Democracy has definitely failed in it's fair share of cases, but it's benefits are still relevant enough to to have it exist
This makes me wonder. Will democracy ever become truly obsolete, or perhaps *when*?
Probably already has
Shemmy and Certified, yes and yes.
The problem is it doesn't want to unless the party is at risk, and when it does...
From what I've seen China gets shit done way faster if it wants to.

And also uses up our finite resources
Conserving our resources pushes back the ceiling
Until the day when the ocean swells start wrecking billionare's yachts, I doubt we will see big companies caring
No...it definitely isn't.
The capitalism problem I'm worried about here is the ceiling, not climate change
Could be a post it on a wall, or a Blahaj on a shelf, as long as you can consistently spot it
Uh, put up something that's right in your FOV that will remind you of the circumstances that you put it there in
Write it down. Paper remembers way better than our brains do.
I think a good capitalist system can and will be really effective...until you hit the ceiling. That ceiling of the finite resources around us and the finite space we live in is a major issue, and unless we have something to pull us back from slamming into that ceiling full force, we're fucked.
But what kind of working conditions are created to uphold that economy?
She never said that it doesn't have it's own issues
Not when it's called lobbying
Fantasize over it.
Maybe we should have listed to Dr. Ver all along
Or you know what
In fact, 99.9999999999999999999958% of it is.
Alot of the system is empty
And how much of it is empty?
And the only place we could really see ourselves expanding permanent industry to is mars
And very empty
Solar system? Maybe. But we ain't gettin *any* farther than that.
We have never hit a ceiling before
We can't even see the thing and we expect to use it?
More of a bitch to get to and use
Maybe I'm just really bad at reading the logos then cause I can't make out a thing other than big red square
But where is the glass being promoted...? It looks like it'd sell me on tape measures if anything?
Oh...damn
But usually when you see one it's marked specifically  as a companies marketing
And while it's not nearly as strong as a whole pr campaign about it, it's also way lower effort and time compared to normal ads.
It normalizes and solidifies the idea that "milk gives you strong bones"
Yeah, but it's a reflection of an idea that is very much taken seriously. It's not about the conscious, but the subconscious effect.
Milk has a well advertised reputation of strengthening your bones that isn't nearly as scientifically solid as said.
It'd probably subvert loads of advertising laws, especially when it gets reposted by someone unrelated to the company.
I had an interesting thought. It's possible companies (in this case milk companies) make memes like this to promote their product and/or service and launch it into the meme ecosystem like any other.
Oh shit, I wish the best for anyone stuck there.
I don't think anybody out there hasn't doubted the validity of their actions. It's a natural thing to happen.
Don't feel. I think most of us think like that in one way or another. And I believe that as you go on in your life figuring out your actions and what they mean will become easier and more instinctual.

Different areas may have different industries or careers that are common of the people living there.
Always a trade
You open up the flexibility for local solutions, but also the opportunity for local problems
*with funding
The latter suffers from a severe lack of anything to stop skyrocketing prices
Military, and healthcare.
Cause if so, I know two big places the US can save money from
So does it all just boil down to needing more money?
And again more money
Schools also need more induvidual focus which means more teachers
Yeah, I've always seen algebra as the limit of universally useful math
So it's easier to get a political foothold
Central Africa is further away from SAs influence
Probably oil
I am not familar with what the US did in central africa
When you see what the US did to South America, it certainly is worrying
"This broken bone won't set right? Let's break it more!" -The US probably
The problem with the US is that it spends as much if not more than most without doing as much if not more
Wait, this is a much more expansive graph
But if you look at health care by percentage...
If you look at it by % the US isn't *that* high
Combine that with our obesity epidemic, and lots of money that could go to anything is being siphoned out through there
And with the US for example, a massive burden on our budgets is healthcare with it's uncontrolled prices...
Which means more funding
Like more money to pay teachers with...?
And more teachers means people need more incentive to teach
But the private ones have alot more leeway
The public schools are kept pretty close federally
US school is quite privatized.

If you can consistently get the right answers or make good work without cheating, then you win
And an "all's well that ends well" philosophy should be taken imo.
But for me its scary how many major points are shared with what happened in the US.
An election won by a lamdslide, an opposition claiming fraud, the election commission finding no evidence of fraud, and a session of the given congress being interrupted by violence from that opposition? Seems familiar.

It's still fun and healthy, so I don't see the issue with it
Humans like to run, and it's a good way to clear your mind
But now with many more tools and a much more expansive memescape to use in them
Kinda interesting to see the random = funny re-emerge with the "Gen Z Humor" memes
If it's self destructive, while it's sad to see, I'm also thankful that it's not harmful to others.
Ah
What do you mean by "getting involved themselves"?
There are so many more unique words...
Ooh, and the Animemes fiasco
They say it's a slur used to silence them...if it could silence them they'd hear it a lot more
It's also okay if a meme is an example or a demonstration of the topic, right?
What does it stand for?
Which ones are they considering? I know "otkonoko" is one
Internet historians aren't financially supported like traditional ones are
Fair enough
Is there anywhere i can read up on this, I'm a bit of an etymology nerd
Everything you'd want
And consistent with other language
Easy to remember
It's accurate
And runs with the same etymology as "tomboy"
I just use "femboy" cause it's way more accurate
Idk
And there was a big fiasco
That's Hideri
Animemes banned it a few months ago
Or Hideri Kanzaki
I just wanted to write
Or promoting that idea to pit the working class against eachother instead of co-operating
There's a toxic idea especially pervasive in work culture of someone else's success always being at your expense. People think "He stole my raise" instead of "The boss passed me up for a raise"
This boils down to "one person getting ahead doesn't automatically mean others fall behind"
And that's assuming the PR value of being a woman in motorsports doesn't get you pumped and dumped by sponsors or a team or anyone else looking to better their reputation by "supporting women's rights"
Auto racing is particularly vicious in this
When alot of your societal practices have been designed around a world with a long running discrimination in it, solutions that seem that obvious only combat the surface level of what's actually there. All those societal systems we take for granted are still there, and still working based around that discrimination.
If its a nervous topic you're gonna wanna get it off your chest one way or another
Don't worry bro
I have the same thing happen with the exact opposite attitudes towards stuff
So something interesting just came up with the impeachment. One of the stories in the opening statements is that early in the afternoon of the 6th, Trump attempted to call Sen. Tommy Tuberville to ask him to object to the verification. He accidentally called Sen. Mike Lee, and Lee gave the phone to Sen. Tuberville where they talked.

Mike Lee, right before the day was to wrap up, stated that he was misquoted and that the story was false, and that it should therefore be stricken from the record, and now things have got interesting.
And I'd guess that it would likely also work in your favor marketing wise too with a good PR person/team
Well cis is seen as the default so often it's seen as an asterik through connotation, not definition
The Plaid Model S is insanely good value in that regard
Tesla is absolutely killing it in the performance department
Yeah, that new Hummer EV is looking super hype
But the giants like GM, Ford, and VAG are quickly approaching
Tesla's victories are based on speed
And on that note, water is also wet
The higher up you get in any system the worse the inequality seems to get
Yeah
***she scored half a point***
And even the one who did
Only one of them scored points
But the fact that I have to name examples one by one and think ***this*** hard about it is already an issue
Tatiana Calderon was development for Lotus, but was just pushed up for pure PR bait
And Susie Wolff was a williams development driver
I think there was one in the 60s
Upper positions become more and more numbed to this
Lower positions are ten billion percent more sensetive to changes like this and the natural course of entropy
The game is way larger than just that single position and interview
That's only if that position exists in a vacuum from those higher up, which it doesn't

Fair enough, you could dump the waste nigh on anywhere anyways
(which is also how you would recharge a hydrogen car)
with a charging source you can literally reverse the process to reuse the same hydrogen
Once you have the hydrogen though...
I...honestly doubt that. Lithium is running out, so I'd see hydrogen as a more sustainable future compared to battery EVs.
EVs are working wonders for performance cars, and the lower noise is great for luxury, but for the simple economy car, they're gonna be a way harder sell.
And the Formula E cars still need specialized circuits with more opportunities for braking and regeneration than other similar cars
F1 still uses hybrid systems, if you want EV racing Formula E is the big player
But, luxury isn't so cut and dry as a spec sheet for acceleration is
You can also have spots that are unexpectedly way more slippery. Oil spills? Road patch isn't properly cured?  Rubber laid down? Bam, it's an ice rink

Hello, what's up?
At least until you're safe
As long as they understand a brief but accurate summary of what's going on, you don't need to give them the whole Ted Talk
Yeah, this.
I mean they may be willing to act without much of any hesitation if it comes to it.
It's entirely possible that if you present your case and a well laid out plan of what to do, they'd be willing to take action first and let the full analysis of all the evidence wait.
Ah
Or the dad?
The aunts?
Is this aunt the one with the dad you mentioned?
By the way
You can drop her the MEGA link
As long as you can contact them at all, you could have them drive over and pick you up if the time is right
Since they're only 15m away...
With that aunt
Actually
Yeah. Again, it's risky and many other options would be better.
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
Does she work?
Last ditch for a good reason
Yeah
Assuming a 15m bus ride means the distance is approximately 15km and a walking pace under reasonable conditions (no snow, moderate temperature) of 6kmh it would take 2.5 hours to cover that distance.
I just had a thought as a more last ditch effort if you can't get the bus
Not country
County
Oh wait
Is that across the border to NI...?
The first one has the motivation to get involved and the second probably has the time and the means. So slap the motivation of the first onto the means of the second and you have the best of both worlds.
Yeah
Talk to the first aunt first, and since she has the relatability she's probably gonna help you. Then you both approach the second one.
Strategy idea
Since they live right next to eachother. So if you're at one, you're 99% of the way to the other.
Don't worry.
It's already been big
I see you. But know that there are options and strategies that can help you, and those strats are ready and available to be played.
Yes.
If you wish to bide your time, keep in contact with your aunts by just talking about whatever else
So drawing attention to it would be a bad idea for her
I'm somewhat skeptical she'd do it, as apathy is likely what keeps others from interfering.
Funds for what?
Can you send letters and file requests and stuff for them to look at it somehow?
Their democracy index is probably boutta take a nose dive this next year for Poland
Is it possible to get broadcasts over browser internet from outside sources?

Generalizations are sometimes useful for making things happen in practice, not in the principles that drive it
When you say something about a group of people, you can say "the good ones" or "the bad ones" but when you let's say write a law, no such luck.
Make sure you know who and what you're attacking and not, otherwise you may end up catching others in the crossfire.
I think the moral of the story here is that you should rant responsibly.
Either way, it does work to compliment TERF rhetoric
My bad
Oh, I thought you were confused at my comment
So "being a dog" in this scenario is being in the group the "dogwhistle" signifies
The point of a dog whistle is that it can be heard by dogs and not by humans. Their noise is too high for humans to hear.
I to be fair to the imgur poster it's hard to tell if it's a dog whistle without "being a dog" so to speak
I just read through it all...and yeah, it's opened my eyes a little bit more.
I feel like I've started to hit a wall with what to do with my time in quarantine. Most of my time before was spent dealing with HW backlog but now its mostly gone
If they're getting their own internal stances wrong, that's their problem, not mine.
For me, if I encounter someone like that, I'm gonna take what they *say* they mean over trying to dissect what they actually think they mean. Say what you mean and mean what you say.
Richer people are often advertised and sold cars that are generally less fuel efficient, which means fuel taxes to create a greater numerical impact towards them than your average working class person
Point is
Well then, there's also stuff like the Merc GLS
They want power and quick throttle response, which naturally gravitates them towards cars with larger displacements or larger displacement engine options for the same cars
If you have the disposable income for a late model Chevy Suburban you can likely afford the tax
Which goes to richer people in general
And larger cars cost more
larger cars are less fuel efficient in most cases
Yes actually
It depends on which segments are getting taxed heaviest. ICEs aren't a one size fits all
News sugarcoats problems by painting those overcoming it as inspirational stories
This is also a problem with news itself

Either way, the name change they did to include socialist was to aid their popularity
Oh...my mistake then
Yep, that's what the Nazi party did. And it worked a treat to get them elected.
Hitler himself admitted the party had socialist in the name because it's what the people liked. It wasn't an accurate representation of his actual ideas.
What's wrong with that?

You can re'use the place where the dam was one to make another
I'm saying if one fails, the land resources that were used in it's construction can be recovered.
I'm not saying dams are used as protection against other dams
Fair enough then
Yeah, but it still does take quite alot for a dam to fail, and when you can, building another dam on the same river often isn't out of the question like with nuclear.
Uh, guy turned a tractor into a legit armored tank and went on a rampage in it around town.

Isekai audiences already know what the world will be like, why waste time
It affects what the audience thinks about it. Which is the whole point of having a book.
Stories aren't modular. Often you can't just drag and drop character changes like that without serious changes or serious inconsistencies.
And if we dont see what happened to make the amnesia thing work, how do we know he was that oh so relatable shut in?
And the stuff you need to do to make it relatable would ruin the appeal to Isekai consumers
It's technically SciFi
It's actually closer to Dr. Stone in that respect than any Isekai tbh...
She's also an outlier in how she goes about her journey
If you're reading an isekai, you're not taking a deep analysis of the story. You're looking for those superficial qualities you can find on the covers.
But would he have that superficial level of relatablility that NEETs and shut-ins have?
Indeed it should have. But it works and sells.
The "old" world is what makes relatable NEETs in the first place which increases relatability
With Sci-Fi you have to explain (hopefully) in detail of how the world got where it is and how it is now
It's still the simplest way to get a true dichotomy between the old world and the new one.
occam's razor (or pen), the best solution to something like writing a story is often the simplest
From what I've seen it seems to be a case of "the wrong vibes" rather than the wrong actions if you get me

Cities for centuries actually have had higher death than birth rates, and people born in the countryside moving into cities grew their population instead which is really interesting if you think about it.
If it did happen, we'd be thinking "what *will* we do" and not "what *would* we do"

You know the skin flap that some east asian, Aleutian, and Inuit have over there eye. That's called the epicanthic fold, and one theory on it is that the fold protects the eye from excess light that could cause snow blindness.

By keeping records I meant like writing down notes and transcribing conversations.
Oh yeah, and gather evidence and records of said bullshit because having something to back you up is never a bad thing.
F man. Make sure to stay communicative and co-operative with your other family about your Mom's bullshit.
Yeah, but as of now I really have no use. I have no income and am making very few if any personal purchases. It's usually my parents buying anything on their own decision with their own funds.

Run with the one party consent law, because that boils down to you feeling it's necessary, and I don't think parents can take away your personal needs.
If you wanna explain your records, appeal to your allies first and you get them in on it too.
I know it's federal in the US.
If you live in an area with one party consent, as long as any participant (i.e. you if it's directed at you) consents then recording is legal.
Yeah, I don't think that's a strong argument.
The laws around like images, videos and audio recordings are important to keep in mind.
I'm honestly not sure. The friends I made in my last school are the first I've kept good contact with outside school. But idk if discord is to thank for that or my attitude changed or the pandemic or what.
USA TODAY: Biden sanctions Russians over Navalny poisoning

https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2021/03/02/alexei-navalny-poisoning-leads-us-sanction-putin-allies-russia/6883733002/
Like assistant teachers who are also in the classroom?
How so? Financially? Health when uninfected?
I think that's the point as they're at less risk of death
Or just straight up stupid
Sanction in "approval" means like a sanctioning body for a sport that sets regulations. For example, "The Federation Internationale de l'Automobile sanctions the FIA World Endurance Championship"

I've already turned off the target advertising and tracking where I can for google

The -o ending is masculine
But with Spanish, everything gets stuck with a gender, so it's not really something non-speakers can have much influence over.
At least for English, we already have the non-gendered term Latin American.
Do Spanish speaking countries use their own solution instead?
E is already gender neutral in many romance languages so I dont see why that wouldn't work
I've seen the term "latine" used
What does that come out to in population percentage
That's still some kind of disapproval towards china
China gets alot of flak for it tho, because, y'know, ***China***

Why would they want to?
You know those boarding schools that the US Bureau of Indian Affairs set up? The people there would punish the kids for speaking their own native languages and force them to use English. Even today, languages that would have otherwise survived fairly well are on the verge of or have already died. Textbook example of outside factors killing language.
And people who do care don't get good opportunities to learn it
This. If a language dies because the speakers and experts agree it's a bad language for whatever reason, no harm. But that's not how languages usually die.
Yeah, but you will have less and less records of the past language.
Sites crash and are never brought up, servers go down or are changed in purpose, data corrupts
But there's alot that's missing in what happens before, after, and tangentially to what's written
It's not wrong
That's like taking a single screenshot and using it to summarize a video
Preserving as in keeping records
We know alot about what usually happens in language but that often doesn't translate into what actually happens
Until the people speaking the language are a large force in such a move, shit won't change.
So taking a solution meant for one and pushing it onto the other just isn't a good idea.
The whole x thing originates from the anglosphere, not the...Hispanic...sphere?
I mean you had Renault up until the 90s, with the German governments support VW designed the beetle, and it's influence and widespread nature needs no introductiom.

I've also heard that descriptor thrown about here and there recently.
I need to learn some more about Delaware.
Low rates still count as havens
You could take a running jump from France to Germany right over
But I think it also worked for Delaware because having so many companies funding such such small state somewhat makes up for low taxes on each one.
Yeah.
Delaware has already become the US tax haven, so competing with them is also a big ask

Yeah. Apparently if you wanna get water higher than ~10m, you gotta get the water to ***negative pressure*** as explained in this vid

https://youtu.be/BickMFHAZR0
Should have been concerned long ago tbf
Yeah, I think there's a video on it that I found about how trees can be killed by a single bubble due to that same issue
Both have a hammer, both have risk of spontaneous pressure jumps
For steam hammer...open a valve in a steam pipe without proper preparation.
For water hammer, close a valve in a water pipe too quickly.
And I wondered what would happen if an incident were intentional instead of accidental.
I watched videos on how water and steam hammers worked.
There are a fair amount more, even if they're less numerous than their liquid counterparts
I'm just giving one specific example of steam systems
Steam turbines are used in ~90% of all power generation. Killing a steam system kills everything down-wire of a plant
I could probably have phrased this much better.
Nah, I'm talking about big pressure changes here.
The phenomena of water hammer and steam hammer occur on pipes that are already on location.
No I am certainly not.
Fair enough. It's kinda hard to know what goes wrong with a thing that's never happened.
A question that's probably gonna put me on some kind of watch list:
Has a water or steam hammer ever been used in a terrorist attack? If so, when? If not, why?
Why aren't they maintaining social distancing, don't they know about CoViD-19? smh my head
I'm sure there's a way to regulate it to a reasonable level of safety...but would that be worth it?
Mmmmmmmmm these Dawn ads get on my nerves cause it tries to convince you they're doing shit for the environment when they barely are

These are like the worst reasons you could ban Harry Potter for.
Cross-checking for the same correct and incorrect areas between students...like any other piece of work. That's not even including stuff like document history or browser tracking.
Because it's presumably a solo assignment that's not supposed to be done in groups, which would likely either lose him partial or full credit.
I want some more input in processing shit like this, so thanks
Yeah
Surreal...that's the term I'm looking for.
It's just startlingly close to the whole reputation of fans of the show, which gives me some real neuron activation if you get me.
Yeah, I get it.
Still...this is scarily similar to the stereotype, and I'm really unsure what to think of it.
Likely so
Yes, apparently this area does have them
The server is now undergoing what professionals would call a shitfest.
(He's 18) This led to him dropping the info that he watched it with his 17 year old girlfriend. This led to him mentioning they participated in intercourse, and here is the issue. He didn't know the area he lives in has an age of consent of 18.
It started with him mentioning he liked the series. People called him out on it, and he started defending the series.
I just had an...unusual encounter with a Redo of a Healer fan...and it's left a bad taste in my mouth.

Look for yourself
https://youtu.be/sG9rX6Ifzhw
The way I see it, they're attacking Meghan because she's a perceived outsider. It's another subtle avenue of xenophobia rearing its ugly head.
I've seen alot of cursed shit and stomached alot of it. But it doesn't mean I want to or like to. Where would one find a reward worthy enough to stomach that part of the show?
Not really...
The server is known for it's toxicity.
The black marks are uniformly sized, which means the road is being maintained and those cracks are being patched over.
They're still by all means checkpoint, just not on the physical border.
So if you fly from well inside one country to well inside another, does that mean you don't pass through any border checkpoints at all?
I'd say a border checkpoint doesn't always line up with the physical border but actually is the point they check you at, hence the term checkpoint.
I believe ICE has offices everywhere

Because of how the data would be thrown out if you don't flag as breaking the curfew then neither client/cop side or server side stored any data.
The data of anyone who isn't already subject to and breaking the curfew is discarded, so the only potential victims are people who 1. Are subject to the curfew 2. Are out and about when the curfew is active, or 3. the plate matches that of a stolen vehicle
I should have specified that unless a match is found, the location, time, and plate data is thrown out because that would bog down any machine involved way too much for viability.
If any of the crimes on the criminal record match any crimes that would have you penalized you with the curfew.
This is how I would envision such a system working:

Liscence plates is scanned and the plate it sent to the servers with the records.

The servers match the plate with the driver. If a crime matches the criteria, it sends the data to the officer and a requests location where they were scanned, while logging the time.

The officer then pulls over the perpetrator.
I always thought a record was loaded as soon as the scanner fired off?
Front and back liscence plates can be picked up by scanners quickly and instantly bring up their record.
Because if someone's in a car, you have to be ahead of them looking backwards through two layers of potentially tinted glass.
But what if someone's in a car? Then, the criminal record option becomes more workable than the gender option.
When the UK has a comprehensive database of the criminal records, why not use that when you're trying to prevent crime?
The part that interests and confuses me is why not base it off something more relevant to crime...like criminal record
I saw they had a video in the article of the actual event so I went for that
https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-9350711/amp/Green-peer-calls-MEN-face-6pm-CURFEW-wake-Sarah-Everard-murder.html?__twitter_impression=true
https://www.cnn.com/2021/03/10/politics/mitch-mcconnell-capitol-security/index.html
I read the Los Angeles times article and it seems the largest concern is riders hitting stuff
Considering the times we're living in they're likely a better option than public transport
Elaborate
Why are they hated?
https://mindthezag.com/places/mayor-of-london-gives-the-green-light-to-e-scooter-trials/
If the federal government starts seeing legal fees from ICE's false arrests sapping their money, then they're gonna pressure ICE to be more efficient and potentially cut budget to force them.
But once their "mistakes" start costing them money, they have to ***be*** effective instead of just ***seeming*** effective.
And there's a major part of the issue. If you don't have the money for one yourself, you're at the mercy of ICE and the courts. If ICE doesn't get legal costs for detaining people wrongly, they can keep doing it w/o consequence.
Apparently immigrants in an immigration court don't have a right to counsel w/ a public defender.
And how do they deem someone as suspect?
Combing through as in stopping people or as in looking at records of people for "suspects"?
The harassment of motorists outside of the facilities simply pales in comparison to what happens if you're stuck inside one.
So, to answer your question. An issue I see is not so much with where ICE bases it's authorities out of. Where massive issues crop up is the abuse of what happens inside ICE facilities to those who are detained. Separation of families, wrongly arrested people being held for multiple years, sexual abuse, and violation of religious freedoms. The lack of recourse for those detained is just horrifying.
So people who forget their liscence and look foreign will have loads of time wasted by an officer vetting them. Now I get it.
That's fair
In the US that's also true iirc.
Just looked and you have to prove your lawful status to get one.
A US driver's liscence would count as proof, right? Because to get one, you've already gone through loads of vetting.
Yeah...I'm out of the loop on what a highway side building would even do.
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
Anyone have an explanation I'm feeling really stupid here.
I'm legit just confused
No
Well you just posted an image of the one on the border, so that's clearly already happening.
Let's say it's immediately behind the border. What does it really change?
Ok.
What would change if it where...idk...just south of Ajo?
I don't really get what it does if the checkpoint is further up or down the road?
I'm not sure what you mean.
Iskierka mentioned the state of the roads.
I mean the satellite shows a bunch of equally wide ribbons spider-webbing the road...that's a pretty clear sign of patches.
They patched over them when the satellite was taken tho.
And the surface of the road around it appears older, but well maintained.
I was just using that to tie into the whole profit point. And when the government profits, that can be re-invested into their people.
The biggest draw of the scooter isn't range. It's ease of travel. Bicycles are still gonna require your own physicality, and walking is self explanatory. Additionally, train stations may be far enough away themselves that they're inconvenient to walk on foot to.
If a well implemented scooter system increases productivity of businesses, that incentivizes such a government to aim for that, and profit off of taxes from that productivity.
And that's because existing public transport is more accessible than these scooters?
Someone in that LA times article suggested a speed limiter on the scooters and that'd be good for both rider and bystander safety
So in that scenario, the freelance vs permanent demographics remain nigh unchanged?
But, is it a bad thing for a freelancer to switch to permanent employment?
The whole point revolves around permanent employment becoming more viable than freelancers.
Found an article against the PROAct, discussing one clause giving freelancers full protection of the act. The main point is that the extra protections independents get means businesses shift to permanent employees & independents are a less lucrative option.

He'd look like Mattia Binotto if he ran a country instead of an F1 team.
But I do wonder what Mussolini would have done if he was alone...
Not *too* rational cause then that's boring

I don't want to know the answer
That would have prolonged the war giving more time for suffering to happen.
Hitler arguably could have been worse if the whole structure of Nazi Germany had more caution and rationale.
Or if his dad wasn't a dick in his own right with the abuse he gave Adolf. Evil spawns evil.
Like that time he decided to bomb British cities and not the air bases, giving the RAF a free chance to recover\
Hitler was cunning, but also emotionally unstable and was led astray by that
Unless you use tone indicators, which is definitely still in fashion /s
It doesn't even have to be war, but often only the hostilities that would lead up to one.
Yeah...TL:DR national rivalries and government funding make tech go super fast
And setting lap records that couldn't be beat on ***any track anywhere*** until the seventies
You had circuit cars exceeding 200mph
The kinda stuff that was going on in the auto industry pre ww2 was insane, all thanks to national rivalries
We don't have another superpower driving us to go big, so we aren't paying or doing that.
They're not reaching further than the Voyagers, or putting people in more extreme places than Apollo.
For NASA at this point, goals have shifted to refining what's there over going for new.

Whatever he's saying seems legit.
The Cold War created an Us vs Them mentality that was also easy to exploit internally, as nobody wanted to be part of Them
*Who says she isn't?*
And in the US at least, a radical left barely exists because of McCarthyism and the scars it left. Hell, the ,ore moderate left was hit hard as well. And since someone needs to be scapegoated as radical, the moderate right becomes radical left.
Why so oddly specific. You say that like it's happened before... <:thonk:656487777189363712>
Even if it isn't 100% set, that doesn't make it any less possible to fall outside of the definition
And it's a pretty successful strat.
To me, it seems like parties and organizations are using the word "socialist" because people like the word, rather than for it's meaning.
Ah
This is the UK right?
Here's another thing
How does Europe stack up against USA, CAN, AUS, South Africa, RUS, China, JAP etc.?
Here's a better comparison idea
So any blood clots would be caused by the prescience of SARSCoV2 in general rather than any specific vaccine?
Why did Germany suspend that brand of vaccine in the first place?
I think he means individual members in the EU rather than the organization itself.
You're talking about the blocked waiver, correct?
That's also a factor. If even supermarkets do the "if it's taken out of the section, it's no use" thing with their meats I wouldn't doubt the same or greater scrutiny applies to vaccines.
And I'm not the expert on that topic at all, so I won't say if they can or can't be stored that long.
Depends on whether they can be safely stored for long enough to be used after a re-evaluation
In fact, the only European countries to approve the IP waiver are Italy and San Marino.
Neither have most European counties at that.
And Canada, Japan, and Poland have not approved the patent waiver
The concern with the blockage is happening outside of Europe, like India and Brazil
Same thing that happened during HIV/AIDS spread, medicine tech was blocked.
The USA has been blocking the production of it's vaccines outside of it's borders for other countries, screwing over those like South Africa.
The other issue is that for someone to get a car they can modify to these levels, they'd need to get something that's unregistered and not register it. Nigh on every cheap used car on the market is registered, making the rich man's sport infinitely richer.
The exception to race cars is under the idea that they're an extremely small amount of the automotive pool, and are seldom driven as well compared to road cars.
Cleetus McFarland's 1500hp twin turbo tube framed drag monster (known as Leroy), which can pass a quarter mile in 7.82 seconds at 176mph (283 kmh) would be considered a street car.
This LoveFab NSX built for the Pikes Peak Hillclimb with massive aero, a full carbon body, a stripped out interior and third element dampers would be a street car.
Yeah, lemme give some examples of where this would apply.
The EPA is suing an aftermarket auto part manufacturer. Their parts are meant for competition only (racing, drifting etc.), but the EPA is mad about the parts being on "street cars"

But here's the kicker. The EPA says the Clean Air Act means a car registered as a street car is always a street car, and it can't be converted into a race vehicle. This would mean the car must comply with street car regulations even if it's never used on the street and only in races.
https://www.thetruthaboutcars.com/2021/03/sema-vs-the-epas-attempt-to-outlaw-race-cars/
Can I post a thing on a new topic?
That also works.
And that's assuming ***the whole population*** in the US gets the UBI. People in high income brackets would be excluded, people below a certain age wouldn't get it (some would go to their guardians) etc.
That's not to mention the healthcare system that's been hemorrhaging trillions.
Also power delivery.
Not just an issue of battery life.
In some areas they are, but those areas are the literal opposite of NASCAR. Formula Student has extremely short and tight tracks, using cars with high downforce small and ultra low weight. The tracks give loads of chances to regenerate battery. All of this is the opposite of NASCAR
If NASCAR went to something like TT V6s or whatever, those would improve the emissions.
That's...a tough ask...
Yeah...
Uh...NASCAR could have a hard time. High speeds, high revs, big inefficient engines, heavy cars, long races over large distances. And lots of races.
Drifting...runs are short and not many are taken so that's probably fine.
So rally could most definitely exist.
If the event has a maximum allocated fuel per car to reduce emissions, then fuel saving could become a strategy element.
Ooooh, I just had a thought. Maybe the slowness is an "oh yeah" rather than an "oh no"
Yeah.
I'm just pointing out they'd have the hardest time following it.
I'm not saying they shouldn't.
Depends on the series.
Hell, they're often also dailies.
Between stages, they drive on public roads. They're gonna rack up kilometers, so they're gonna be the most constrained by this.
I just had one more thought. Rally cars.
Mercedes F1 recently hit 50% thermal efficiency for the W12 engine which is insane. Most road cars go from 20-35%
Exactly.
It literally only ran one event in that year, so it's unlikely to exceed any yearly limits.
It was built as a Pikes Peak one-off
For something like that NSX
The laws for show car imports already put a mileage cap, why not do the same for race cars?
The NSX
Ok, lemme use one of the examples I posted above
That's an interesting idea. If it were based on how much a car emits in a year, different kinds of race cars running at their own frequencies could be factored in.
The biggest issues with carbon footprint are the transportation of equipment, cars and peripheral that are associated with a series running.
Spec Miata and E36 are cool for circuit racing. However, drag racing doesn't have a good time with stock cars, and drifting would be wildly unsafe with stock cars.
You can post them for demonstrative purposes

I'm talking about automotive ones here.
And some of the 2000s motors (V10 and V8) did exceed 20,000rpm
Current F1 motors go in the low teens
E motors tend to go in the high teens to 20,000
<:HibikiWhat:336656482907193344>
1/10th of what?
It still comes out to faster top speeds than what's hit at Monza
Mexico is at high altitude which considerably reduces the drag.
If you wanna talk about track properties
Lank, that's kinda backwards...
F1's fastest lap ever is just under 265kmh average speed at Monza. NASCAR's fastest was just under 350kmh at Talladega.
NASCAR is above F1 speeds at their faster tracks. ***Way above.***
No, 15k is the legal limit laid out in the regs, but most don't do above 12k.
Yes to that extreme...
It's not just RPM. You can gear up or down to get the RPMs you want.
But...NASCAR doesn't really do much of those pulls from 0.
They way they deliver power is also not suitable for NASCAR. They're amazing in torque at low speed. Gods of the launch from 0 in fact.
And try to co-operate with getting the money back when reasonable (ie helping contact Google Play support). If you can succeed with that, then that's one issue solved.

If they do ask, say that you don't want to talk about it.
I'm sure they'd still welcome a casual conversation.
Well, they're probably really good people to get used to phoning with.
In that, try and call and talk with your aunts and nan. It doesn't even have to be about her, it's just healthy to do.

Solutions should scale with the issue (let's say state), but an authority above (national) or authorities below together (multiple municipalities) need the ability to challenge it.
However, probably the biggest deregulation issue faced by people in the US (where I am)  is in medicine. Price setting in a county means the medicine company won't sell in that county, and price setting in a state will make them focus on greener pastures and exploiting the other 49 better.
Where did the municipal government improve over the national one?

And then there are some abstract art pieces that for one reason or another, can't be traded and used for laundering in the same way.

True, however that's a different front in the war against Amazon.
But here's the upside. They aren't giving in either. Every article that stays truthful is still a loss for Amazon and a stain on their reputation.
It's Amazon. They can get away with simple harassment of reporters. Nobody would want to fight them in court cause they're so big anyways.

It's tempting, but it just doesn't add up. If they want to be another anti-west propaganda machine, they're not doing a good job.
And then there's this whole section about the Arab spring, and how they were instrumental in spreading it's influence and ideas https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Jazeera_Media_Network#Al_Jazeera_and_the_2011_Arab_Spring
And then they create a division to tackle a market that wishes for greater transparency
> Al Jazeera Media network also operates...Al Jazeera Mubasher, a live politics and public interest channel (similar to C-SPAN, Houses of the Oireachtas Channel or BBC Parliament), which broadcasts conferences in real time without editing or commentary the first channel of its kind in the Middle East.
Reversing their original idea of "Challenging The West"
They're changing their image and appealing to English audiences
> In late 2002, director of marketing of Al Jazeera, Ali Mohamed Kama began to push a "repositioning" of Al Jazeera, "accompanied by the introduction of English subtitles and dubbing of broadcast into English.
That was back in the late 90s
Here's the thing
> The Emir of Qatar, Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa, provided a loan of QAR 500 million ($137 million) to sustain Al Jazeera through its first five years, as Hugh Miles detailed in his book Al Jazeera: The Inside Story of the Arab News Channel That Is Challenging the West.
Wait, is the funding just straight money, or like buying stake?
Does AJ+ report on mostly domestic or international issues? Or is it a mix?
Cause for every one of those, they've got less money and means to maneuver themselves out of it in court.

We all have our 30. But even then, one person's thirty is part of another person's 70 and the converse is also true.
I remember seeing something about with most people there's about 70% of them you will like and 30% you wont, and any relationship (platonic or otherwise) is about finding a 70 you love and a 30 you can deal with.
What's important is about comfort. Are you and the partner(s) comfortable with the pace that they're going?
Rushing and delaying implies that it's a deviation from whatever pace feels natural to you. Sometimes going faster is just how one is, sometimes slower.
I mean it's still possible. But when that's the case, it's less likely one will go out of their way to interact with them as a stranger.
It's a bit more nuanced than that from what I've seen and heard.
That's true. But there's also a point where the emotional side deepens to where physical attraction is a secondary factor. It might start with physical attraction as a major factor, but as it continues it usually becomes less relevant.
I've never had attraction like that with the exception of models who do that on camera...

But if you talk with someone who gives you a really good vibe once, people can often come out of that wanting to go further with them.
It is, but a correct call behind schedule.

Whether it's an intentional attempt to make LGBTQ history seem nonexistent or if it's just people who can't or don't believe a character to be LGBTQ, it's still been harmful.
It's not just about that, but it's also finally a thing where LGBTQ history is really coming around and being acknowledged. Stories like those about Asushunamir/Udushunamir, the relationship between Achilles and Patroclus, Sappho's poems. They were usually interpreted as just "guys or gals being pals" or just straight up ignored.
"mild or indirect word or expression substituted for one considered to be too harsh or blunt"
Is it not possible to state in a euphemistic way?
Does anyone know of any similar attitude changes in other sports around that time?
I noticed that in american motorsports between ~1985-2005, there was a large push towards street circuits made in city centers. But since location was prioritized over circuit quality, they often flopped within a few years.
I've got a topic idea
The more you talk about Caesar the cooler he seems
Like
Alex: What did you do at 16
Modern kid: I learned to drive a car.
Alex: A car?
Modern kid: A bit like a carriage, but it pulls itself instead of using a horse.
Alex: Ah I see. Back then, I ethnically cleansed an entire city.
Imagine that, like you have Alex and a modern teen talking about what they did at 16
The child of someone who Caesar fucked with literally ends up fucking him figuratively
Ironic
Also the thought of femboy Caesar makes me laugh
Oh, it was early in his career
It's also just not a very good look to be the emperor of the most powerful country on earth at the time and have a foreigner calling the shots (even if it's just in bed)

Were they cunts tho? Yea.
But on the other hand, Jinnah was educated and developed his political ideas in England, and his prime minster Liaquat was pro-British. And Mountbatten was against Jinnah partially because he wished to control Pakistan and Bangledash himself.
Muhammad Ali Jinnah, right?
He did say in an interview later on that he regretted rushing the whole thing and wished for India to be whole.
***If I can't play with my toys, you can't either!***

Ensuring Muslims in India could never win representation through the lack of majority states: ☑️

So here's a question
Recourse. Recourse. Recourse. That's the name of the game. When actions can be punished, they're treated with greater consideration.
The police likely won't change itself, outside constraints need to pressure the police.
As long as that lower class is easy to suppress, it's easy to continue that cycle.
The binary isn't innate. It's society deciding that there is one and assigning things to it.
People think of identity affecting and causing presentation and activity, not the other way around. Identity is very innate. Presentation and especially activity isn't innate however. You can change your activity or your presentation to fit a society. You do it all the time. You can't change your identity.
Non-Binary already breaks the rules, so expect more rules to be broken
And every person is different
There's alot of free roaming within it
They are in some ways, but not always.
They often correlate with gender and are useful for denoting such, but they aren't specifically gender in itself
Nope, pronouns aren't gender
I draw some from both sides of the binary, but I'm not part of the binary. I just steal a little self identity from the binary and run.
I call myself androgyne.

Lemme use a different kind of number analogy
How about this
We can tell, it's ok.
If you need to take a break that's fine
If one person is nonbinary, it's a rejection on their personal level, not on a societal level.
There cannot be a binary that ***applies to it***

So let's say a prosecutor shouldnt be held responsible for false information someone else prevents
The TL:DR of this page

"...prosecutors cannot be sued for injuries caused by their own misconduct—for example, coercing witnesses to lie, hiding evidence of innocence, or fabricating evidence of guilt—even when they’ve intentionally violated an individual’s constitutional rights or caused a wrongful conviction.

This absolute protection for prosecutors was made up wholesale by judges; it does not appear in the Constitution or in any law passed by Congress. In fact, Section 1983 (the Civil Rights Act) expressly says “every person” who violates the rights of another “shall be liable to the party injured.” 42 U.S.C.§ 1983. But courts have read in a special exception for prosecutors."

The platform seems like it could also be in a much more extreme nice than discord. On the "about" page it says the following won't get you banned.

Is it "right" to call Greece "Greece"? I mean, that name exists cause the Romans incorrectly thought the whole hellenic world was Graia. Do people from there care about the names, would they prefer people use "Hellas" or "the HR"?

Thing is, that's a bacteria that's already developed a solution that we're copy pasting. Finding new enzymes that no organism has used before for plastics no organism has broken down before is the challenge.

Rich people are treating a basic human need like they're corporate shares because of course they do, they're rich people for a reason.
And this. Since the situations where it's needed seemed unlikely, you'd never really see the need for it at least till something like this happens.
"Hawley's point was that Colonial Pipeline is entirely dependent on computerization to run its 5,500 miles of East Coast oil pipeline, and is underinvesting in security while paying out $600 million in shareholder dividends instead."

Here's another possible cause. If shareholders wanted to drive up profits and therefore stock in the short term, reducing or killing the training programs would save costs.
Did they...did they literally just cut out the training courses for new recruits or something?
Even if you can't actively transition, you can still try to buy stuff now and stash it away for the future
Here's the full quote from the original thing

In an attempt to establish that their interests will not be adequately protected, the Proposed Intervenors cite a variety of statements and actions taken by the current Administration regarding protecting LGBTQ+ individuals from discrimination in a variety of contexts and then leap to concluding that “the current defendants will not defend the Religious Exemptionas vigorously as Religious Schools,” Religious Schools’ Mot. to Intervene & Mem. in Support 24, ECF No. 8

When vigorous is used here, they're quoting the school's original motion, so it's the school's words, not their own.
Ok, now I think I get it. This is from the document:

"While there is no general privilege in the Executive to disregard laws that it deems inconsistent with the Constitution, in rare cases the Executive’s duty to the constitutional system may require action in defiance of a statute.  **In such a case, the Executive’s refusal to defend and enforce an unconstitutional statute is authorized and lawful.**"

Bc the DoJ has authority to defend here, the schools are scared they'll use that to just not defend. The schools want their own defense who they know will follow through. The DoJ hit back and told the schools they're adequate by themselves.
Here's what I'm looking at
https://www.justice.gov/olc/opinion/attorney-general%E2%80%99s-duty-defend-and-enforce-constitutionally-objectionable-legislation
I mean they shouldn't in a moral sense, but from what I can tell they have some sort of legal obligation to defend it anyways (I'm not very good at reading these kinds of documents)
There's an org called the Council of Christian Colleges and Universities said they didn't trust the JD to defend them properly as they may be against the schools. They had asked to be part of the case and defend the schools themselves. That motion was ruled against and the JD said that in the process.
The title is a little confusing, because this is actually against the wishes of the schools.

Same here.
Yeah, it is.
Same here, that's why I'm personally fine with it.
Probably because my own experiences with the word are alot more positive than yours. You said earlier you live in the south, no? I'm well removed from that here, so I found the word like any other.

I swear the only reason 9/11 was such a big deal was cause it hit our egos harder than the towers
2977 americans die in 9/11, and it incenses the War on Terror
2407 Americans die at Pearl Harbor, and we join WW2 over it
615 THOUSAND Americans die from CoViD-19, and THIS is how we respond?
With that kind of scenario it's almost a given that some nut would say man-made in China

I've just heard about the obsolete terms ||sexual inversion|| for various forms of queerness. Is the term ||invert|| still considered a slur, and if so has it been or is it being reclaimed?

The word "mate" may have been different back then, idk. I'm just trying to illustrate how much pronunciation has changed since singular they first became a thing

Since before the great vowel shift, in the days where "bite" sounded like "beet"
Usually they're not even meant to be "decisions" but just random day to day things that happen. One specific example: Blue Chapman.

My guess about what happened is that something went very wrong with the drivetrain, and it cut power to the motors. But instead of going into Neutral, it went into Park. 

First guess: Because the screen says "Car Off" perhaps it needs to be considered "on" to get out of Park and into Neutral, but it won't turn on due to the motor power cut.

Other guess: Teslas are brake by wire, electronically deciding braking behavior. If the motors aren't responding correctly or at all bc of a power cut, the BbW system may entirely disregard the driver's pedal input.  If that's the case, than the car, not knowing the driver is braking, won't switch to Neutral.
Half As Interesting quote that hits different:

Exactly. Because it's mostly exclusive to guerrilla forces, it's a guerrilla tactic.
If something is good enough to where bigger orgs take note, it isn't guerrilla anymore, it's just how you do it.
When the definition is changed by who uses it and who doesn't, calling them as a whole effective or ineffective, the tactics can really only be considered as effective as the forces behind them.
The word "guerrilla tactics" has a connotation of being with small, ill equipped or weaker fighting forces. If the US military were to start using a given guerrilla tactic, people would be much less likely to call it a guerrilla tactic because now the US is on it.

Now if let's say, Student Debt was eligible for Chapter 7 and 13 bankruptcy, that could eliminate a large portion of the debt through a well established and familiar route while also stopping the meteoric rise in it's tracks.
The total student debt is higher than the amount of USD already in circulation. A bit too much for that now.

They joined the IGLA in 1985 back when there were basically no restrictions on membership and flew under the radar until 1993, where the IGLA reached UN consultative status. But the radar of Republican Senator Jesse Helms picked them up, and they got the USGov to threaten massive budget cuts to UN funding if NAMBLA didn't fuck off. NAMBLA and a few other similar orgs got yeeted throughout '94, but even then the IGLA lost consultative status and didn't get it back till '06.
The NAMBLA was weird. They became a thing, fucked around, got rejected by the queer community, caused some moral panics, snuck into the UN, got the USgov on their ass, and then quietly died.
And because of that, since there's no threat of a loan being cleared if it's too big, there's no ceiling to the constant cycle of loans and prices rising.

Here's my idea. What if most of the money was taken from child support of high income people and used to help boost the child support of low income people?
That's true. So at that point Tom isn't gonna need any more money, and Katie isn't gonna need a year's worth of support every month, where should it go?
Like Tom Cruise supposedly pays $48,300 a month to Katie Holmes. I'd expect that for a year.
I'm curious, how do people secure child support payments that look like reasonable amounts for a year every month?
Unless it's something overtly problematic in itself, there's really no basis.

Perhaps in anticipation. It may be that you know something good is likely to come, but are worried that it might not be as good as you hoped.
Or are the standards indeed effective, and is the situation in the UAE a little less terrible than I imagine?
Do the ILO standards really work then? If the UAE can be in line with these standards but still be so shitty to it's workers, has the ILO failed?
There's much talk on the terrible things happening to migrant workers in the gulf states, & I read something interesting on Wikipedia. The UAE signed a law in 2017 that brings their worker rights in line w/ ILO standards. Yet people many are still paid sub-min. wage (which is already low), and you still hear of these abuses ongoing.

If the peer to peer tool starts working because of it's ability to avoid the centralization of the euro or USD or what have you, there's your issue. If it can be monopolized, it's gonna be centralized one way or another.
Soindividual? What you're saying is that while distance and currency divisons aren't the real barrier for the EU, it's the lack of ability to do anything for the induvidual?
I see, I kinda misinterpreted there
So breaking down those barriers helps those most who are the most ready to exploit it
Interesting
So even though those obstacles you've put forth earlier have been broken down, it hasn't really helped at all?
Hasn't the EU already achieved that in some capacity? Distance isn't a problem in Central Europe, the borders are mostly open, and they all use the Euro currently. Is there not already a proven strategy to break down those obstacles?
I see

And if let's say with a snap of the finger all of the land for grazing cattle in the US became mature forest (65 years), that'd be capturing about a billion tons of Co2 a year. That's equivalent to 1/5 of the entire US's emissions.

The trees of a theoretical project like that would be totalling hundreds of millions of metric tons of absorbtion
Yeah, but the potential is big regardless. 41% of the US's land is dedicated just to raising cows, whether it be grazing land or making feed for them or whatever. What if much of that land was reclaimed and replanted?

Im using "FICO" as a kleenex-esque catch all here, as saying "credit score" and "social credit score" can be easy to mix up
Why I bring up FICO as my target here is because:
1. It's actually extant on a wide scale
2. It's the one that does, has, and will affect us
FICO isn't nearly as bad as social credit is for personal freedoms, but they both apply similar principles and methods for comparable outcomes for whoever runs it.
I mean they're both rating. They both soley exist benefit the institutions that created them. They'll both ruin your life if you don't keep them up. Both demand large amounts of data on your every move in their relevant domains. And they both give the institutions they serve the means to worm their way into much more powerful and influential positions. The key difference between social credit and FICO is that social credit is just a broader application.
People hate social credit score for how oppressive it is as it favors doing exactly what benefits the CCP. Yet we forget how FICO scores serve the exact same purpose for Wall Street.

Who would buy one of those name a star things?
In other words, it makes it much harder for new people to get into NFTs
And since those lower value ones are the stepping stones for people getting info NFTs, it's gonna make the experience way worse for casuals in the market
While this likely won't effect the high value NFTs much, lower value ones that are often bought for sentimental purposes will be destroyed by it

I hope the best for you, and I hop that she boded well in the time up until she left. If you need someone to talk to, just shoot me a message.
The discrimination and such is present, but it takes a back seat in story compared to national identity, and this just kinda gives me a new way of thinking of this all.
It's not the authoritarianism in general, police oppression, militatism, or anything like that at the forefront. It's the Japanese being stripped of national identity.
In Code GEASS, the world under the Britannians is supposed to be dystopic for the Japanese...and what's the 1 thing that's supposed to sell it to the audience that it's dystopic, and is focused on as the greatest tragedy of the system?
This gave me a thought
Yeah, I think that might make a good topic for my final
Honestly I could probably do a whole history project on Nobusuks Kishi and Manchukuo...
That's like if one of Hitler's close mates became the HoS of West Germany or something
He literally became the Prime Minister of Japan from 57 to 60
And one of the Class A war criminals, Nobusuke Kishi didn't just get off scot free
Or just killing amounts of people in general up there with all the other big historical villains
Or their extremely shitty planned economy in Manchuria
But rather in that oft cited work culture and such
Yeah, the issues don't usually come up with tourists
Japan is also hostile to foreigners, nationally proud to a fault, has a social climate that obliterates any kind of non-conformity, etc. If there's anywhere with a cancel culture issue, it's Japan, as speaking out on issues like these can seriously get you fucked up.
It's an unapologetic pinnacle of many ultra weeby aspects
If the whole point of being a weeb is being into Japan, and Japan itself is quite a nationalist nation-state, I can see how that can arise.
I mean it's Senran Kagura, knowing the games I couldn't see why it wouldn't have that problem
You better be

Because in the end, at this point in time, current Germany is fundamentally separated from its WW2 counterpart in a way Japan isn't. Japan's current govt. has been chugging along since the Meiji Restoration.
Japan doesn't
And because their populations may have been pretty miffed if they didn't get involved
As long as the face of West Germany wasn't a Nazi, the ruse could go on
Because outside of Germany, that wasn't paid attention to
But the US didn't care about who might be in the justice ministry, or other lower offices
If a known Nazi were to become HoS, it would more or less destroy that mirage
The west had to give an image of the Nazi's being dead, and a new democratic Germany rising
Yeah, but it was far from the sheer blatancy of Japan
Which is fucking crazy for the time
In 1937 there was a Nazi rally in Madison Square Garden, 20,000 attended
And in the US, for a while the Nazis did have quite a base
It supposedly does, but it usually ends up covering "good" people more often than "bad" anyway, because that's what people often want to see
They implement jokes like these just for the sake of making it seem more lighthearted and distracting people from that reality
Believe that was real
Like they're a weird mix between late stage capitalism and planned economy that exchanges some run of the mill lobbying type corruption for a nice batch of nepotism.
And pretty capitalist
Maybe the real international disease was the capitalists we made rich along the way
But if it were to progress past that investment bubble phase as you say, the whole "copied NFT minting" thing would really put a damper on things.
Last night I started to develop a headache and some aches and pains, and I pretty much couldn't sleep this last night. I got up pretty fucking done, but here I am mid-morning later feeling almost no symptoms again.

I honestly don't know enough about blockchain to be able to say much of anything about it on other applications
Yeah, I wonder who gave it that reputation
https://twitter.com/nytimes/status/1480883446792794117
How I see it, regardless of how legitimate blockchain is they'd want to fund research it anyway
But when it comes to anyone being able to fuck around with their own blockchain, that could be interesting.
When it comes to existing larger scale systems adopting it I really don't see where the appeal is
If anyone can spin up their own blockchain, that sounds like a much more interesting proposition.
What does a "local development environment" mean here
Ima be honest here. I really can't see what's up here. It's shitty how blockchain is used as part of this crypto BS. But to me at least how it'd actually work in other applications seems so up-in-the-air that I can't know what to think yet.
If blockchain is a complete dead end for anything good for us, we need to figure that out fast. And if blockchain holds major potential for decentralization and liberation, we need to figure that out fast.
Not many things are ever as extreme or black and white as the hypotheticals I put forward, but my point here is that whether big tech funds it doesn't matter much, as we still need to figure out how or if we can apply it to get out from under big tech.
In a hypothetical scenario where it's a complete, 100%, total, unforgivable scam for those who aren't big tech companies, a scam is still super profitable for big tech, and they'd still want to get in on it.
And on the other hand
Let's take a hypothetical scenario where however it may be, it's a legitimate threat to big tech's current model, and that blockchain does offer seriously useful benefits while decentralizing things.

Big tech companies would find it in their interest to figure out where the potential and benefits are in blockchain. Regardless of whether they respond by fighting with or adopting blockchain they'd want that information.
So where does PoS fit into all of this?
When you could just sell those benefits on their own
Yeah, and now that that's recognized NFTs are starting to try and add more tangible benefits to them
But like, they probably have a patreon or something so if you wanna give them money just do that
I guess the royalty kickback to the actual voice actors is their "gotcha" so they can frame it as supporting the VAs...which I guess it kinda is

Imagine trying to quickly spin this yoke back and forth, while looking backwards and dealing with a jack-knifing tandem trailer

Even then in this application the effects are so negligible that it only would ever make a difference as a marketing ploy

I mean they don't connect directly to warehouses often in the US, but in many other regions (Swiss got it down pat) they do to great success
And no, the road noise is actually from tires, not air. It used to be especially bad on old tires, back when the tread blocks were arranged in such a way it created specific strongfrequencies
But inside, most modern cars stay under 70dB
You can when you're outside the big metal box
Without that kind of sound deadening, there's less motive for people to drive as it's less comfortable, makes drivers better aware of their speed, and motivates companies to use low noise tires.
I had an idea for a funny yet interesting and useful law, even if it isn't really viable.. What if there was a law that restricted sound deadening in cars?
Not completely, no. But these >14 lane megahighways aren't it chief
I...think you misinterpret what I mean by this. I should have specified that I didn't mean mufflers, resonators, or anything that reduced outside/ambient noise. Sorry if it came as a shock.
At some point if you wish to save money, you'll have to literally get rid of some lanes and routes
This.
Wrong message
Highways in their current state are at best, a consumable in a way
And then being a truck and literally paying an amount equivalent to selling a kidney to go on the highway
Imagine being a regular car and paying a buck and change to get on the highway
So raising/introducing tolls on highways?
In reality for road noise legislation to restrict tire noise is the boring and realistic solution here
Rather than a real possibility
I said it isn't really viable earlier, I just thought it an interesting *train* of thought
Literally making cars less likeable to drive, and forcing makers to take measures that reduce noise for *everyone* inside and outside the car instead
I wanted to limit the cabin deadening for the driver and passenger
Simply the fact that rails don't decide to destroy themselves under normal use saves alot of money over roads even when they aren't operating at near max capacity.
The UK also requires rubber track shoes, and has its weight and size restrictions too
Metal tracks are just harsh on asphalt in general. In Texas if you want to road a tank over 5 tons, it's gotta have rubber tracks to my knowledge.
*Albert Speer busts through the wall* "Interleaved road wheel time, ja?"
If you're a buisness who manages organs for hospitals, you'd get like 10-25 drives or something
If you're selling your kidney, you're only getting a single drive out of it.
Wait, I'm looking it up
Or yeah, a kidney would get you a few drives
Cause that'd mean if an average driver paid a dollar for a toll, a truck driver ***would literally have to sell a kidney*** to recoup that money
Because as long as trucks are on the road, the average driver is subsidizing their whole existence.
Very cold take: Despite all the hardship they endure, even the most coldhearted americans should appreciate the inner cities for how the tax revenue burden they hold somehow keeps the entire economy from disintegrating.
Vans are certainly better than trucks for what they drive on
And due to that, it ends up playing triple duty between gender modality, identity, and AGAB
If "trans" means gender different from AGAB, and "masc" and "fem" are for masculine and feminine, why do people say "transmasc" isn't for AMAB & "transfem" isn't for AFAB people? Where does this extra rule come from? It's just inconsistent if an AMAB demiboy is trans & masc but not transmasc. Additionally, if an AMAB demigirl is transfem but an AFAB one isn't, it's yet another way to divide by AGAB which is counterproductive. Of course, this is just my view, and any input is welcome. Thoughts?
I...that was quick
Any thoughts?

And with the "harmony" thing, that means the official US military version of Taps isn't music as it's only played with 1 trumpet or 1 bugle
Except ***even that*** doesn't really work for white supremacy when stuff like Gregorian chants get excluded
My point here is that these qualities aren't requirements for music, not if rap does or doesn't posess these qualities
In modern music absolutely, but usually the older it gets the less thoroughly structured the music gets, and the less regularity to rythm there tends to be, and I think this structure and regularity is what Ben Shapiro is on about here.
You know his whole "rap isn't music" thing? His argument boils down to music having 3 elements. Harmony, melody, and rythm, which is complete bullshit.
Not the first time he's been destroyed by long dead musicians
I presume if they want international clout for that aid, or want to defend Ukraine in their interest, those helmets are necessary in some capacity.

If they could somehow get those objectives without a NATO war they'd love it.
Russia has major interest in Ukraine, but they also have major interest in connecting the Kaliningrad Oblast with Russia or Belarus. I think they did some war games there a while back.
If it does escalate to war, the nations most at risk are Ukraine and Poland, with the Baltic nations in a not very good position if Russia or Belarus does make territorial gain.

In this case it just seems risky to me for the loaners though, especially when the people who are the most in need of the best deal are at the most risk of going bankrupt for it

Even if you happen to fight off the first wave by some miracle...well the second will come a-(no)knockin'

It's just Built Different™️ in that instead of using their banning as a figurehead for "peace" they used their legality as a figurehead for "freedom"
It doesn't have to just be "criminals and governments" or "everyone" here, it's not that binary
No...rather if you're to have guns less restricted for those parts of the populus, it still wouldn't apply to a large part of everyone
Yeah, it's still useful in the sticks for that, animal control, survival, etc. But the fact that those areas are rural in the first place means it doesn't apply to that many people anyway.
While the 2nd amendment makes a big show about freedom and all that, but part of the reason people back then needed guns is because if you weren't in a city and something happened on your property, there was no 911 to respond, you were the police response. That's not true nowadays.
I mean, if you're one of the select groups that's more likely to need one than have an accident with one, then yeah, it does make some sense to me.
I thought FICO and such was already halfway to an orwellian nightmare, and expanding how China did just sealed the deal

Supply runs to restock troops and bases each came with hefty extra payments, sometimes with resources skimmed off the top
Officers on the ground had to bribe officers for air forces if they wanted CAS or bombing runs for example, and many couldn't pay up and were left unsupported
And of the US, while they and by consequence the south were well funded, so much of that money was siphoned off through the massive amounts of corruption in the south Vietnamese system, especially later in the war, that the mind-boggling amount of corruption completely gummed up the war effort.
Even if they still exist they're jusf losing badly for a longer amount of time, especially as foreign aid can dry up if there aren't the desired results
That's probably why people think rebellions and revolts are as easy as they are, because we did it a few centuries ago
Keep in mind america was able to revolt because enough ***white british*** people got pissed about taxes, and even then a large part of the reason the British lost is just how long it took them to move things overseas
Meanwhile in the middle east many of those rebels were quite well supplied thanks to *somebody's* support in the fight against communism
But the reality of the situation is that *it does* 

In this case it's a multifaceted problem where there are multiple solutions that help on their own and work in tandem. Gun control and police accountability.
If this escalates I can see some kind of oil trade restriction on the horizon which definitely wouldn't be good for Russia

Of course we all know how that went down, with Japan becoming the imperialist power as a corruption of those pan-asian ideals

In that situation a fucking monkey could have "modernized the economy" by sitting back, letting US investment roll in, and having debt drive your growth. But it took a whole lot more finesse to set up a ***good*** one, which Pinochet didn't.
Cause all that growth was driven by debt which was great for US financial institutions who profited off of it, but not great for Chile's long term sustainability
Like he set up an airplane food, bread and butter, US backed and invested modern economy and it didn't even take a decade for it to bite him in the ass

It was able to dictate what pan-asianism meant in such a way that when it took Korea, and Taiwan, and Manchuria, they could say "this is what you wanted, right?"
It's something reading up about Japan and it's imperialist history has kinda opened my eyes to
The idea of Chinese reunification is much more likely to endanger people on Taiwan than liberate people on the mainland. By sheer political mass, any form of reunification, in peace or war would almost be certainly be under PRC terms primarily. Rather, the RoC is safest in trying to ***not*** be China, reducing the leverage the PRC has on the island.
Speaking of China, I have a take if you're willing to hear it out
Over the last few days, getting homework done has gotten more difficult and slower. I wouldn't give a shit about hw if I didn't have to, but teachers do. Spring break isn't near enough to help either. Hopefully this school's administration is more helpful than the last three.
They've run out of any good reasons long ago, if they had any
"Let's militarize so we can use military to combat militarization"
Russia is actually one of the larger silicon producers
I kinda expect Russia to sieze the tanks in storage from Ukraine, fix them up, and then sell it back to them while also offering training on them.
But if Ukraine doesn't have the resources to put them back into readiness, then they won't be a lucrative buy
Yeah, they can still use those as well, if nothing else than to sell them
Like T72s? If so, Russia can still find use in them with the resources to fix em up
Ukraine is also quite resource rich, and Russia doesn't want to lose out on that
By the way I'm talking as if Russia and Belarus are a single entity, because that's what they're trying to become.
I'm not sure if Putin is thinking *irrationally* here. With how Russia wants to expand into Europe, Ukraine joining the EU and NATO would pretty much completely curb that opportunity. If Ukraine successfully joined, Finland may also see it fit to follow in their footsteps, boxing Russia's expansion in. That would be great for world peace, but not great for Russia.
I wasn't confident the US would militarily intervene before, but I definitely think we won't now. I expect heavy sanctions.
https://twitter.com/Telegraph/status/1496802689669292039
Just a reminder for everyone
And China will need to collab with Russia even more so as the North Sea Route opens
Almost certainly, especially if Australian coal is a less reliable energy source for them
I think sanctions will hurt their internal stability more than anything. I'd imagine pressure from big businesses from Russia to walk back would come up.
I think that's what they're relying on. For now they just want to be able to "get buy" until the weather literally turns in their favor
Yeah, there are easier ways to get it
Isn't silicon literally the 2nd most common element in earth's crust?
That's how the Soviet's played. The economy was far from soaring, but it generally chugged along at...*a pace*
Soldiers doing recon and scout tasks had already agreed not to shoot eachother in encounters before
Yeah, probably the most iconic example of this was the Christmas Truce in WW1
How many other soldiers would a platoon like this be working with?
Where'd you hear it?
Also, from what I've heard, just having something in your hands with the capability to deal with aircraft is a big morale boost.

MANPAD's are here
Modern doctrine for Ukraine and Russia is more or less an evolution of the soviet days. As Blockio said artillery and air power are quite important. The strategy that Russia and Ukraine like is to use has soldiers on foot and vehicles to finding and hopefully trapping forces in a certain area, and then having artillery or air support or something else along those lines doing the killing.
I'd expect them to pass it off as really angry civilians doing it, which to be fair will probably happen on its own
I expect the Biden administration to say "we have no plans to cyberattack" publicly and then start privately cyberattacking
***I was just about to get to this part of my explanation dammit***
Everybody hates Russia right know, hackers who want attention will go after Russia. Hackers who want to make a difference will go after Russia. Ukrainian hackers fighting for their lives will go after Russia.
Honestly, I can imagine civilian cyberwarfare possibly playing a large role in this conflict
Yeah, better to pretend to be Ukrainian because it's not like that's gonna give Russia new countries to fight

It also contributes to global warming, which is directly in Russia's interest

The left wing movement in the US we've seen gaining traction alongside Bernie Sanders' rise in popularity has been pushing that cause on various issues

That will generally require the abandonment of the American obsession of personal responsibility

So that's what we gotta do. I see debt reform as a "must fix at all costs" issue alongside climate change
The more outstanding student loan debt there is, the harder interest works, the greater the risk and severity of any potential recessions

Somebody's gotta do Ukraine's bloodwork
Does the article even say if these are DoD biolabs or no?
Ok, I've had an interesting line of thought. Gender is an accumulation of social, cultural, and societal factors. And in many societies outside of modern western society, there have been various 3rd+ genders and gender roles, each of them distinct from the other.

This makes me wonder something else. Because the 3rd+ genders of different cultures are different, does that mean that the binary genders of different cultures can also be considered different? For example, would the Etruscan "girl" (more progressive gender roles) be different than the Abbasid "girl" (very strict gender roles)?
We've come full circle

According to the Bible, fuck Ronald Reagan

Proverbs 22 : 16, 22-23 (NASB)
16
One who oppresses the poor to make more for himself,
Or gives to the rich, will only come to poverty.
22
Do not rob the poor because he is poor,
Nor crush the needy at the gate;
23
For the Lord will plead their case
And take the life of those who rob them.

Not that I needed the approval of the Bible to say that.
Or Ukraine isn't really Rome because Ukraine's armies aren't getting smashed and reformed between each battle.
Yeah, Russia is Pyrrhus, Ukraine is Rome in this case.

West called their bluff, so if they moved back then they would lose alot of international notoriety. If they committed, they'd gain alot of notoriety and possibly gain a Ukraine, at the cost of many sanctions and some resources. They took the latter option.

Especially when the parties are promoting the narrative of identity politics being a thing, it makes a whole lot more sense now
If people hate identity politics so much, why don't they hate party politics more? Like isn't it worse to align yourself based on completely arbitrary criteria rather than substantial ones?
Yeah, there's been loads of reports of commanders telling their troops that they could just drive into Kiev and it would be captured.
If you're made to believe that a group of civilians are enemies, you're not even following orders at that point, you're following common sense based on what you know, but what you know is wrong.
It's almost certain that Russian commanders are misinforming soldiers to get them to follow orders. Of the civilian buildings Russian troops have destroyed, do you really think that none of them were told those buildings had hostiles?
Warzones are never clean, and neither are chains of command. Someone's gotta set a threshold for responsibility in a legal sense, and all the lawyers and judges and council members will have to navigate that.
4.2 million people gone from a land built to hold 44.13 million isn't gonna be healthy to any kind of rebuilding efforts Russia wants to try, they'll need Russians to move in for the territory to be of any use to them in the near future.

> It is a dangerous principle that to protect nationals and their property a large number of troops should occupy so many places, destroy so much property and kill so many innocent people. In every country there are residents of other countries. Is this principle going to be a new principle for the world?

Imo we should push certain companies to restart business in Russia. Particularly ones that aren't useful to their infrastructure. That way we could mess with their trade surplus if they imported more products again.

I actually do expect Russia to "deploy" the Armata in one way or another by keeping it 30km behind front lines, filming it a bunch for propaganda, and posing it in front of captured towns

Because the capital itself never really mattered, but rather your standing itself acted like capital does. Capital as the middleman for power was stricken, but the oligarchic and oppressive nature of it all was not.

Actually it looks like everyone down to about the United Kingdom is pulling their weight tbh
One of the most common things I hear from pro-Russia people is "you were okay with X war (often Iraq) when you were doing it!"  Generally aimed at the USA, but also other NATO countries totoo.

Did they just forget about the 300-400k people in New York City? The 150-200k in San Francisco? The 200k in Montreal, >750k in London, 300-1,500k in Barcelona, 660-2,000k in Madrid, 500k in Valencia, 200-250k in Seville, 100k in Gran Canary, Cadiz, and Oviedo each, 80-150k in Dublin, 100-200k in Paris, 650k in Rome, 400k in Milan, 300-500k in Berlin, 150k in Athens, and many more?
But the information about that has actually been much quieter than about it's initial adoption
If it's any reassurance, most of them in general seem to be getting shot down. The stuff that actually passes gets way more attention than stuff that doesn't. For example, I believe the whole CPS trans thing is actually currently blocked by a court injunction as unconstitutional

You know the Florida anti-trans policy? That policy also came with a "fact" sheet. I did a bit of digging on the studies they cited, and it's as bad as I expected. They cherry-picked info from those studies harder than the entire nation of Chile.

The literature Florida chose for their fact sheet support that puberty blockers lead to positive experiences, improve mood, reduce the risk of behavioiral problems and improve overall functioning in patients, as well as HRT reducing the risk of depression and ||suicidality||.

Even the material that's supposed to support their points fucking debunks it.

The thing I hear is that the lack of breakthroughs is because their supply lines are under pressure

Believe it or not, F1 innovations can be stuff as ubiquitous as the rolling road wind tunnel, as unexpected as the technology that went into 5G of all things, or or as absolutely out there as 6 wheeled cars.
In other words, they really don't have an argument against unleaded fuel
I'm saying because they *supposedly* do
Makes sense for many series even health aside. Like when you sell yourself on road relevance, using more road-car like fuel only makes sense.
I say that they don't matter because there's so few of them flying so little compared to the almost 200k regular piston engine aircraft, they are the one type of aircraft that could really use the benefits, and the FAA is still unsure how safe leadless avgas is actually is, so the highest compression applications are the most at risk
You know, I just had a thought. Remember when leaded gas was banned and ***everything*** got better? Can we do that again, but with piston planes too? (minus racing planes)
Wait I already posted this

True, and it looks like the Russian offensive over the last few days has actually been focusing on the area around Borova, so I'm not sure if Ukraine can really afford to push back against it.
Looking at the maps, it appears Russia's troops in Izium are really close to being cut off from their supply lines. If Ukraine takes the towns of Shevchenkove to the north and Borova to the northeast, not far from where they are, Russian troops only have a narrow corridor with but a few tiny back roads to move anything to the front.

Republicans have never been pro-free market when it doesn't align with their interests.
If you're that far gone to think of baby supply as a market, and America is such a free country with it's free markets, then isn't abortion freedom just a pro-free market policy?

So like the formal name is the Helleneic Republic, but I'm saying our common name should be Hellas, as it still is respectful to the full name
Oh no, I meant that our common names should be derived from the proper name
England is their city you could say?
I mean it's still part of the proper name no?
Should we make a more conscious effort to respect the endonyms and proper names of certain countries? I.e. Czechia, Hellas, Turkiye, etc.

Basically this
Buffed out corrupt in-your-face politician
it would show the world that they are weak, and need to fully mobilize against a country a fraction of their size
but once it massed, it could either withdraw in embarrassment and shame, or launch an invasion to hold to their word
Russia fully had the opportunity to just...not
it put itself into a corner as it massed on the border
neither of these would be true in the slightest
and that it will be an "easy" war
their public standing relies on the fact that the conflict is removed from the Russian civilian
the Russian elite has no stake in a destroyed economy with a massive labor shortage
and it would only make Russia's economics worse totoo
it'd completely shatter whatever shred of credibility the government has
because Russia likely won't fully mobilize but Ukraine will
manpower wise Ukraine might be heading towards an advantage
when it comes to equipment quality they're more or less on par
but those weren't really symmetric foes like Ukraine is so it's hard to tell how well that translated
and they'd been collecting experience from fighting in Syria as well
from Chechnya, Georgia, and to Crimea they'd actually been improving

The whole study is extremely problematic, largely because there's no control for cis women. Blanchard actually had no way to know that this "AGP" wasn't actually just something women cis and trans experience. He just assumed that with no information to back it up.

In the end, that's the responsibility the League claimed to take up, that's what China looked to the League for, and that's what the League failed at.
Then again the league stopping Japan on it's own is enough of a boon in my opinion
Yeah, that as well. But on the other hand, it also gives China the capacity to tackle debt bubbles like Evergrande
Oh absolutely better than the Soviets
Building infrastructure as part of a stimulus is all well and good, but you gotta ensure people actually use the damn thing
But then again that state control and manipulation of the economy has also led to this

Yeah, true

After all, you have to be parking something
Park and ride rail infrastructure could help, but only so much
The infrastructure around like NYC and San Fran and stuff is decent, but the rest is just shit
The cities kinda are doing that, but the miles and miles of shitty R1 suburbs around them are already built and done
Much of that place they should have never been granted in the first place
Electric and hydrogen cars don't fix all the problems of cars because they're still cars
Also true, which just leads to a greater reality of green transport
Electricity can be and is already partially produced through green means. The tech is there, it's viable, it's used. Hydrogen is almost exclusively produced through this fossil fuel process.
So it's still basically a fossil fuel
Fun fact: Hydrogen gas for hydrogen vehicles isn't actually produced by electrolysis or anything, but rather like this
Literally ohio
Opinion: Rental scooters aren't a good idea in cities, but personally owned scooters are a great micromobility solution.
Yeah, it will. But taking a cherry bomb to the bubble isn't the best approach
Worse than 2008 I'd daresay
Not to mention the current housing bubble popping, popping other domestic and international bubbles along the way (like our student debt crisis for one) would probably lead to one of the worst economic recessions in modern history
And since there isn't enough affordable housing to accomidate such an exodus, homelessness would likely rapidly multiply
Well more than they already are
That would also just make the current housing crisis even worse as now city house demand would spike and suburb house demand would be in the dumps cause they cost so fucking much
*You do realize the kind of consequences that a near immediate collapse of massive swaths of the US population's living space would have right*
People in suburbs aren't just "ruining their own health" but perpetuating a ponzi scheme we're all paying for
This is what happened to Minneapolis
But even that's the thing, suburbs are such a financial burden on their cities that either suburbs will double or triple their taxes to sustain themselves, or cities will have to be terribly underfunded
Massive swaths of people are still spread out in suburbs
Yeah, but that's the thing, it's happening in US cities, which are only a small fraction of the land where people live
Not impossible if eminent domain happens, but rich suburbanites will have the resources to fight it unlike poor people
Houses? With people in them? A little bit harder for obvious reasons
Rail infrastructure and roadways are really easy to tear up and undo, both have been done or are being done quite easily
You should probably go see someone for that specifically, that much mucus and/or inflammation in your throat isn't good
Oh that's not good

“Most of the track that it’s covering is either uninhabited land or water.”
China has alot of soldiers, but not nearly enough ships to actually ***get them to Taiwan*** which is pretty important if you're trying to invade taiwan
Seeing as the Bundeswehr got busted for some serious gun issues recently I wouldn't be surprised if they had their own
And even if that is the case, tumbling bullets would be the just about last thing you want for practice shooting
Plastic bullets for range shooting? Never heard of such a thing.

But even then there's only so much you can do
You can try and control the court of public opinion changing stigmas, offer tax benefits, etc.
Kinda like how France did with Mali
Maybe some power projection missions in the middle east or africa to get their military experience or something
I honestly think that while China postures about Taiwan, they're alot more likely to make a move in south-central asia
Make sure any country who pursues war has a damn hard time doing it
We can at least not excasterbate it when avoidable, and give a reason to reconsider when not
Japan likely wouldn't directly fight unless engaged, you know the whole special conditions they have and all that
“I have never advocated war except as means of peace, so seek peace, but prepare for war. Because war... War never changes. War is like winter and winter is coming.”
-Ulysses S Grant
Exactly. Contested landings are never the battle you want to fight.
The germans didn't have anti-ship or anti radiation missiles, nor satellites, nor most of the really important tools we now have to counter sea assaults before they reach shore
Oh no, way worse than D-Day
There are a couple of beaches, but those beaches are backed by fuckoff mountains
The Type 10 comes to mind as another tank to take advantage of that fact.
Considering they're in an environment where a smaller lighter tank is alot more of a boon than where the US has been fighting, it makes sense.
For example they still run M60 Pattons only recently looking to acquire M1A2T Abrams, but those Pattons are heavily modernized
Not necessarily impressive, but definitely enough to put up a fight if need be.
If China goes to war with Taiwan, unless China creates some never-before-seen strategy that completely upends amphibious warfare bringing back the viability of contested landings, I just don't see it.
Those roads likely being primed and ready for ambushes that would put this Ukranian conflict to shame
From there they have to fight up terrain that would prove absolutely brutal for any kind of attacking force (why the US opted not to fight the Japanese there in WW2), consisting of large mountains and dense forest with few expedient roads through

Solution: switch to something more efficient than cars
I thought that was kinda a given
Finally, someone making the right direct comparisons
They don't draw much power on a single charge
Yeah, it's pricy to buy but will cost a hell of alot more to maintain, that's the issue with it
They can definitely fit in a train car, that I kmow
I mean an escooter doesn't inherently rule out public transit, car usage either
...what the hell is your walking distance?
I mean when just having a car for a year costs more than buying two of the vast majority most escooters new...yeah
That's beyond the journey length of what you'd want to do in an escooter
Cars are just really fucking expensive to maintain, the average cost of owning a car yearly is over $9,000 in the US
The idea is that you can have both, only using the car when you need specifically what only a car can offer
Another 17.3% under 10 miles
Did you know that about 60% of vehicle trips in the USA are under 6 miles?
I mean yeah, a car will always be able to do more. But the whole idea is that the vast majority of the time you spend in a car you're doing small journies carrying very little
But for the price of a Craigslist junker you can get scooters approaching 50kmh in speed and 50km in range
For entry level scooters yeah that's true
Rental escooters are just bad. They cost alot to use consistently, incentivize use as a novelty (a bad idea for a motorized vehicle), are treated like consumables by rental companies creating e-waste, and worst of all, in London rental companies got privately owned escooters banned and created an artificial monopoly.
And they are if you have one with the range and speed to do so, which again rentals don't
I've read about alot of those instances which tells me that's generally a rental escooter problem. Riders who own their scooters usually don't put them into harm's way for obvious reasons.
But comparable
I wasn't saying they were equal either
I never said they were better
Are you listening to me
I've...heard many not good stories about doing so
Many can't go up curbs, but none have issues dropping from them
They're designed for urban use...I'm not sure what you'd expect
I mean yeah unless you get an offroad escooter big bumps aren't usually a good idea. 

But even 10in (found on a few escooters, most larger) is enough for a great majority of sidewalks, greater majority of paved roads, well kept packed dirt roads, and some grass.
Both can get pinch flats on tubed tires
Which I guess is an e-bike
Escooters don't usually snap or anything like that, the most common issue by far is usually rear flats which I guess is even more comparable to a bike
Yeah, that's fair. But for someone who does say, manual labor, a bike could be a non-option
I'm saying anything you do day to day that tires you bites into your range and speed on a bike
Not saying that
Of course that depends on what you're doing with the bike. If wherever you're going entails any kind of exertion, that can be an issue for obvious reasons
There's also the question of using a bike in conjunction with other modes of transportation
I've researched that model, there is no lower motor option
Yeah that ig
You really overestimate how large their batteries are
Come again?
Entry level escooters don't
If you want performance comparable to a bike you're gonna pay money comparable to a bike
If you want performance closer to a car you're gonna pay money closer to a car
No, that's just the higher end that costs that much
I don't think that a bike or an escooter is inherently better than the other
No, I meant that bikes were the more relevant comparison, not that they were better
That's not necessarily weight, just no condition can do that to some
And people are always looking for easier ways to do their daily chores
But for most getting around is primarily a chore which is why they became a thing in the first place
I mean yeah if pedaling and all that comes with it is what you want to get out of it, ain't no way around that
Some escooters have airless tires, some have tubed pneumatic and can get pinch flats like most bikes, some are tubeless and don't
Me personally, I don't like biking for exercise. I prefer sprinting (not a viable way to get around) and weightlifting.
Depends. Do you like to pedal? If so, probably not.

Are you looking to get some more exercise? If so, probably not.
Like, that's literally the biggest thing about an e-scooter
Why are we operating under the assumption that an escooter simply being able to propel itself isn't an inherent benefit?

In highways, yeah usually. But in more built up areas with intersections that's not so consistent.
I think the only people who don't deal with traffic jams don't ever step foot into a car.
And are we not already dealing with more than mild inconveniences? Traffic, road accidents, injuries, deaths, shitty air quality, noise, etc. It's not about inconveniences or costs, but rather our difficulty in looking past the status quo and the people who want to keep it that way.
Yeah, then again even just maintaining, let alone expanding the status quo of our infrastructure is already a huge investment
But the vast majority of trips people make, they don't carry much or go far, which are the niches where cars start to come into their own.

>  A casual discontinuance of the practice of despotism is not a discontinuance of its principles; the former depends on the virtue of the individual who is in the immediate possession of the power; the latter on the virtue and fortitude of the Nation.
It's like something Thomas Paine said
so while it may be hyperbolic, I think something along the lines of "despotic" carries that nuance
yeah. I'm trying to emphasize the fact that the system enables "bad apples" and however many "good cops" there may be out there don't invalidate that
Maybe saying that they're *despotic* on the local level would be better?
Well you never really can if you only have authority within a handful of square miles

I just found the wildest shit from Russian propaganda https://zvezdaweekly.ru/news/20229121654-2rrSj.html
They already have https://youtube.com/shorts/mVkcb8bBziA?feature=share
Gripen just can't compete, and even if it could Swede govt ain't happy with Saab
True, hard to beat the Rafale in the 4th gen market these days
I thought the US hoped to sell F-16s and shit when the HAL Tejas wasn't going to plan
And idrk why the hype died
I remember the Gripen got alot of hype and was purported as holding that honor for a while, but it seems to have fallen off
Yeah it is pretty good
All F-5 based
Or the Saeqeh mentioned there, and the Azarakhsh
Take the HESA Kowsar for example
And a bunch of totally not F-5s
This held true for both the tomcat and the Aardvark
Also worth noting that swing wings are pretty expensive and difficult to maintain
Yeah
I think it's capable of ***a little more*** than that
You'd want ***at the very least*** an F-15, and the real competitor for the Su-57 is the F-22, at least from what we can tell
Scene goes hard but wouldn't pan out that way irl, the F-14 just doesn't have the nose authority nor the right missiles (I don't think it can carry the AIM-9X) to get a missile solution on the Sukhoi, and getting a gun solution would be even harder.
here's the truth on that
https://apnews.com/article/fact-check-911-pentagon-attack-footage-415983695442
Which is just a massive cope
And they're saying that because the USGov lied about 9/11, Lockheed Martin can lie about the F-35
The artcle is copium about the supposed problems of the F-35
There's also alot of farming there
That's assuming Ukraine doesn't already get there first
Many Russians have had their native nationalities diluted by Russian migration, so I don't know if they'd do so

Are medium range missiles like the AMRAAM more reliable?
Yeah, I'm not saying it's good or anything. I'm just specifically confused as to how worse stealth could lead to more close range fights.
And also if it's stealth doesn't work as intended, wouldn't that just ***increase*** the range of detection and therefore the range of engagements?
Is the F-35 maneuverability even that low though? I thought that was a myth started by War is Boring misreading a test report from a while ago
Then again the consensus has never been that stealth can't be countered or defeated, but the fact it makes it harder still offers potential advantages
I think I remember people calling it a mini onboard AWACS or something
Based and MICpilled

Since only M1A1s were lost to my knowledge, that would mean it was one of those
Maybe one of the Abrams that the US had to leave behind and destroyed was restored
Since it was 1994, the "most modern armor" would be the M1A2 sans SEP
> The only truly impressive and surprising part of the tour was when we walked through a “secret” field museum that had tanks from all the armies in the world—including several from the United States. The Russians had somehow managed to obtain an M1 Abrams tank (probably from one of their allies in the Middle East), and we all believed the reason they allowed us into this facility was to show us they had our most modern armor.

https://www.thebulwark.com/i-commanded-u-s-army-europe-heres-what-i-saw-in-the-russian-and-ukrainian-armies/
Guy was a general in US Army Europe for a while
I thought Mark Hertling saw it for himself
Also wait, Russia already has an M1A2 or something on their hands iirc
Not to mention the shitloads of retired M60s in US storage
Taiwan is getting rid of a whole host of well modernized M60 tanks that would be much easier for Ukraine to maintain
Uncle Sam doesn't need to send Abrams to help them win
Petrol, avgas, auto and marine diesel, jet fuel, kerosene, methanol, ethanol, whatever
Yeah Abrams is pretty thirsty fuel wise, about 70% as efficient as a Leo 2 for range. But it's also a turbine engine that'll pretty much run on anything.
It's probably not the Abrams, but more likely something along the lines of the M60 or an older model of Leopard 2.

The gist I'm getting from it is that to say that a government is tolerant implies they have the right to revoke freedom of conscience, and that if they are intolerant that they have the right to grant it.
I'm reading some Thomas Paine and I've come upon a passage I don't exactly understand, can anyone help?

> The French Constitution hath abolished, or renounced Toleration, and Intoleration also: and hath established Universal Right of Conscience.

> Toleration is not the opposite of Intoleration, but the counterfeit of it. Both are despotisms. The one assumes to itself the right of withholding Liberty of Conscience, and the other of granting it. Be one is the Pope armed with fire and faggot, and the other is the Pope, selling or granting indulgencies. The former is church and state, and the latter is church and traffic.

I just think there's something to be said of the credibility of someone who's done both
But he hardly lived out the ideas he came up with, codified, and described
Yeah that too I guess
Even then the Paris commune isn't brought up that often
You'd really expect folks to look at actual historical examples besides just the Paris commune alot more than they actually do
Even then Marx did theory, but barely any practice. He only lived in an actual commune for a handful of months, from October 1843 to May 1844
Why do people always forget about communism before Marx? The Waldensians, the Dulcinians, the Diggers and Owenists, anyone else who took the Book of Acts seriously and the Church of Jerusalem described within it.
Even as a terrorist weapon they haven't got a good record of getting past interception or hitting their target

If 3s find 2 the best strategy, they will go for 2. And if they find 1 the best strategy, they will go for 1. All as means for the ends of 3. That can be used to our advantage.
Looking at you *Mars* with the TiO2
And a duty not to harm their customers
When 3 becomes the best strategy, people choose 3, like CEOs today. When 2 becomes the best strategy, people choose 2 in partisanship, tribalism and nepotism. If 1 were viable, what do you think people would want to do?
It's not just human selfishness, but how it's amplified and held up as the shining example of success

You bring USD anywhere in the world and there is a decent chance they'll accept it, some places like Bermuda even peg their money to USD 1:1
Exactly
The thing with fiat money is that every exchange we make with it is itself a validation of it's value. It's not just that we *believe* fiat money has value, it's that we literally put our money where our mouth is.
it's making it even harder for people to get into it?

Russia already uses Wagner
What would this escalate it *to*? Russia is already conducting total conventional war to put it generously, and the only step above that is one way above the pay grade of a MALE UCAV.

Well not basically, exactly
Basically NIMBYism but for homeless people

NATO was made to deal with the Soviet Union (and early on China ig) and it's only gotten larger since, compared to modern Russia with a decaying sphere of influence it's a severe overmatch.
The NATO doesn't want the trouble of dealing with Russia, but Russia doesn't want the smoke. This puts the NATO in a powerful position to get Russia to walk themselves back.
Big time fuck up for Russia (regardless of whether NATO article 5 is actually invoked)

The west is big, China is also somewhat formidable, and Russia's whole sphere and narrative is kinda just falling apart rn
Yeah, it seems to come down to resources & spheres of influence tbh
Different times require different methods, today's wouldn't be half as effective back then
But like, they invented the fucking word propaganda, and they've kept that shit humming for a litteral millennium and change
Not so much today
Also, I'd argue that perhaps the Catholic Church might one-up that
Well yesterday actually
Oh yeah that happened btw
Yeah how else would basically nobody know about the 48,000 large strike in california a couple days ago?
Using the geopolitical footholds China already has to expand into Central Asia, SEA, and Africa, which are the only areas they could reliably tempt

I saw a great BBC Africa video on some of that stuff

Say what you want about them, feeding 3000 kids a week is something else
I think of the Black Panthers tbh
Yeah Yugoslavia actually went kinda hard until it didn't
Or do you mean Yugoslavia?
Which SSRs again? Remind me.
Basically every minority and non-Russian ethnic group besides maybe the East Germans got fucked one way or another
I mean specifically the Russians, as if anyone was really a benefactor out of all of that bullshit it was them
Russia using denazification as an excuse to fuck with minorities in their sphere of influence is working against the Ukranians just as well as it did against Balkars, Crimean Tartars, Chechens, Ingush, Kalmyks, Karachay, and Volga Germans when they all got their asses deported to Central Asia.
The Russian people seem to be of a similar mindset as in the late soviet union
Russia was able to rebuild it's sphere of influence somewhat back to what it was (and now it's collapsing again)
I mean in some ways it has and hasn't ended

When was it not?
(I use reconquista because I think it a historically relevant and apt comparison)
Same with Rome tbh. When Rome fell in 476, people didn't know it fell, they didn't *think* it fell. They still thought of themselves as Roman, but under new management...until the 520s when the Byzantines needed a justification for their reconquista of Italy.
I'm of the opinion that a radical defect in our systems may require radical action to expose, fix, and create long-term change.

It does, but that thing it happened to get somewhat right.
It still strikes me as unusual at just how unprepared the Soviets were for the Germans. You know that one Enemy at the Gates scene? It's a large dramatization of the reality of the situation; Soviet logistics were simply not able to arm and supply their troops.

That does beg the question however, what did Hitler think about Indians, and what would have happened to them if Hitler took over the UK? With the ethnic conflict present a  thehtime in India there was an amount of support for Hitler there, and they're the actual Aryans that Nazi propaganda loved to go on about.

I like Christmas and all but today I just feel jaded. Lemme explain.

A few weeks ago Grandma wanted to buy me some new clothes with her money. I thanked her and send her three shirts that I'd like, none too expensive. One has a Coelacanth, the second Odyssey Eurobeat merch, and the third is this Sylveon shirt. Grandma's confused bc the Sylveon shirt is listed as womens, so she sends them all to Dad. Dad gives me a hard time for that and bc he thinks the coelacanth shirt is a women's shirt too bc of the model & v-neck cut. I tell him that yes, that's what I want, and no, the Coelocanth shirt is not a women's shirt.

Lo and behold on Christmas day Dad gives me two racing shirts (his most common gift for me), and the Odyssey shirt is on it's way. But on the Coelacanth and Sylveon shirts, no dice. This really confirms what I've thought for a while: my parents just don't get that I want to explore my style and gender expression. I've told them that I want to experiment, I've had friends give me their old fem clothes, I've taken Dad into my local Hot Topic to look around, I even bought myself a pair of heeled boots last year which they returned and got me boring uggs instead. 

And here's the difficult part. They say they're supportive and it certainly seems like they want to be. But whenever I give them a chance to support me, they shy away or just veto it if they have any say in the matter.

Nothing in US aviation would have been nearly as good as it is without NACA/NASA access for their projects
Or does rather
Gating resources behind one company or another is a bad idea that capitalism can encourage
But even then when it comes to parallel competition like these both still rely on similar resources and stuff to revise their designs
I was thinking along the lines of how Soviet design bureaus have been competing for contracts and innovating as such for years, most notably in the field of aviation

Didn't fix any of the Soviet's other problems but it is competition and innovation outside the bounds of free market capitalism
I mean what is there to innovate in toilet paper? It's pretty optimized already.

Go Getty their asses
But the Chally isn't *that* useless and tanks for Ukraine has been a symbolic line now crossed
True
It's not that they have no tanks however, they've been getting T-series and T-series derived tanks for a while combined with a decent amount of Russian captures to keep their stocks from getting too low
Wait...would it? I mean when some were considering sending A-10s and Ukraine didn't want them everyone was fine with that
Then again they can't just reject it because that would be political suicide
Economy of scale is not gonna be on their side here
Thing is it'll still be a while before Chally 3 comes into service so I don't know how many 2s the UK will want to let go of
There's a big leap in capability between say the 2A4 and the 2A7
Abrams true but Leo is quite variant dependent
It's still a good fucken gun, got the longest kill in Operation Granby/ODS at >5km
Thing is a bit of a headache to use with it's sheer weight, and it's drivetrain reliability isn't the best
Honestly Chally 2 was not the MBT I expected to come, I would have bet on the Abrams before the Chally

But if the Topaz system actually gets off the ground ATACMS might be less needed
They turned old Soviet recon drones into suicide drones that can go really far
I mean they already have systems that can go that far even if they aren't widely availible
Not least because that's simply not remotely within their capability no matter how many new shiny weapons we give them
As in whining like they've been doing for months
By that I mean weapon systems sent continue to get more complex but Russia doesn't wanna do anything abt it
Not likely if things go as they've been going
Cue Russia whining about *eScAlAtIoN* and shit in 3...2...

Idk, I'm not sure it's a good idea obligate anyone to spend time with you. But you're always within your rights make your case to them.
But the problems inherent in pitting people against one another still stand, it seems your ex just can't cope with the idea of you having other friends play a significant role in your life and end up trying to pull you away from them.
That's a very good point Melua
Then again, a friendship one *contends* for isn't a very healthy one by default, because it pits people against each other rather than bringing them together
Friendship as with any relationship is mutual, just because they're intent on it doesn't mean you're obligated to comply
No, because the important part is that ***you*** wanted to see them for a while too
How so?
Alot of this is spitballing and manufacturers and governments are *usually* very hesitant to release numbers like this
That's why I say "cited as" rather than "is"
For example the F/A-18 Super Hornet is usually cited as having a 1m RCS, and the Eurofighter Typhoon as having a 0.25-0.75m RCS
Nevermind, it literally just tells us the RCS is 0.1-1m² which is like...not far from the good end of 4/4.5 gen territory
https://twitter.com/Remarks/status/1617601777779544084
I'm not sure I can advise here as I definitely don't have the experience to, but if this is a pattern maybe something's going wrong during, immediately before or after that once in a lifetime. For example I had a similar problem of friendships never going anywhere while I was young, but as I switched schools and went different places I found better and better friends. I simply wasn't in the right kind of environment to make good friends.
It's entirely likely that because you haven't spent much time with them in the first place they're out touch with how you feel and what your needs are.

What do you mean by "traditional"
The way they influenced Sweden joining the EU, selling weapons to Ukraine, Azerbaijan, and stuff like the joint Kaplan/Harimau project does paint them as a rising power

Not to mention it serving as good PR for their more ambitious projects like the Kizilelma
And frankly they were really lucky to land all these international good-guy points with Ukraine and the whole Bayraktar TB2 thing
Turkey just sells to who they sell to as long as it doesn't directly oppose their interests
Yeah, but China also doesn't exaxtly play nice with Russia, nosing around in, copying, and frankly making better versions of their military equipment.
China and Russia don't particularly trust eachother, they're in more of a working relationship. Turkey is similar in that regard. India is...well idrk where they are but they're not divorced just yet.

Ah, I know where that is
Where are you from?
No, bicycle grants.
Is the whole Bihar biking thing still around?
As long as you were something vaguely socialist they were cool.
USSR wasn't particularly intent on spreading their brand of socialism outside their neighborhood.
"It just works."
Pakistan was another key player in those plans, so they are in serious danger of falling apart
China has been investing in them, but china's plans in the middle east overall have been seriously disrupted by events in Afghanistan
I'm betting on Pakistan going to the west if the IMF bailout goes through with any modicum of smoothness
Just like Israel and Palestine all the problems in our world can be boiled down to British people.
But also Pakistan warming up to the west for that sweet sweet IMF money
And Pakistan itself getting stuff from China
And India seems to be pushing towards the latter more than the former
I'm not sure how much this was a serious offer or whether it was to make a point but still
I think at one point they offered it to the US lmao
Idk the way India was promoting the Tejas to other nations did give me different ideas
Yeah, but that is something I expect to pick up in pace in the near future
I thought they started exporting stuff to Armenia I think?
I wonder if the transition into being an arms exporter will change that for the future
And it's not like a new kind of bullet is particularly hard to hide compared to other military bits and bobs
Particularly with the colonial legacy and massive diversity in languages and peoples

Whats ALB again?
Yeah. Well im saying if you ever rewatch, try dub
Luckily it was a good one
I watched it on Funi so I was kinda forced for dub
And what they did with Non...just look for yourself
For once the MCs personality feels like it kinda matches the voice
Keijo has a good dub
How bad is the Deen adaptation really?
Didn't the first route of Fate get a better anime adaptation than the studio dean one?
If anything isn't solar a power source that is still pretty inefficient?
I've only seen Delta but it's great
Watch, is good
Y'all seen Macross Delta
Fair
Which means less cruising hp
At 2300 drag coefficients and rolling resistances would be lower
Thats 2020 stats, not 2300 stats.
But let's say a roof, hood and boot lid is covered in the panels. Its still awfully convenient to be able to recoup some power and range over an afternoon of it being parked.
I doubt solar alone will be EV power
If there is room for improvement anywhere that 280 years will give us it's there
Damn you go through those novels faster than an RX-7 through apex seals
Can you give me just one for now?
That's a big list.
Fair enuff
It was actually my first anime I could truly call my favorite, before Symphogear ofc.
Well in the end they accomplish the same thing. I did enjoy Tensura alot.
<@161155855524298752> I did really like Otome Vilaness so what other shows along those lines would you recommend
That's why they made the GR
Toyota still runs their Yaris
Which I mean is still much more than the Netherlands had in F1 before max (Spyker isn't much)
At least with manufacturers
Japan has had a pretty good rally history for a while now
I think there was one.
Yes it did. Special Stage 15 in 2007 and Special Stage 19 in 2008 both used part of the Monaco GP course. Rally≠in the middle of nowhere
That happened a few years I think
Even if its in the middle of the Monaco city itself on part of the grand prix course its still appealing.
Rally Monte Carlo is a good example of tarmac rally
Rally is rally!
Also about well maintaned roads, why is having good roads an obstacle? If anything shouldn't it make access to the event easier and thereby the whole event more appealing?
Initial D is a product of its time, where it was much more widely accepted as a hobby to street race.
But what it doesn't have is that bad connotation street racing does have.
Even though it might be alot more appealing in the west, rally is about the right balance so that most regions have some familiarity with it.
Nowadays street and drift has a really bad rap in Japan, so bad in fact that street circuits are almost nonexistent in japan.
Still enough for that AJRC to be a thing.
Wait I mispelled the acronym
Why not? I know some areas are better than others but if the AJRC can thrive I don't see the problem.
What they want is one they can relate to?
Im not saying it has to be global, but it works as a good example of the kind of variety in settings you can get in such a show.
Also the speaking you hear in the car is the co driver calling out the corners ahead of time by reading his pace notes.
Tell me this driving style doesn't fit anime well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_f6wWHrs4Y&t=59s
But Goddamn was made in 1990 I think and i was thinking more modern than that
Goddamn
Meanwhile WRC goes everywhere from the forests of finland to the safari of kenya to the mountains of argentina to even the streets of fucking Monte Carlo at one point
Rally also has more varying conditions and settings, Initital D barely goes out of Gunma.
But for rally, the driving would suit anime even better than touge racing thanks to the jumps.
They have the movie, but it has its own soundtrack.
well for rally it does have a few things over street racing cinema wise.
You know what suprises me? A lack of modern rally racing anime.
Capeta is painfully accurate sometimes.
***me creating a wojak meme when somebody has a legitimate point against my argument***
His ass lookin like a TF2 character
You know the tiny little shit balls you make when you have diarrhea? Skelter heaven took the tiny shit balls of a few bad and completely different plots and clumped them together, basted it with gasoline, seasoned it with magnesium, dropped it into a bucket of thermite, filled the rest of it with diethyl ether, dumped that into a dumpster, repeated that a hundred times over and finally set it alight. That's how bad of a dumpster fire it is.
Sound design is terrible, pacing is jarring at best, and animation and CG arent any better.
Plot hasn't shown any major flaws yet, but also hasn't shown any major anythings yet
And here it begins
OP music isnt terrible, but the visuals are
First 1:09 doesn't need to exist.
But the radio broadcast thing is actually a good idea to get a quick way to tell us the state of things.
Something that terrible that only wastes 19 minutes of your life? What a deal!
Time to watch Skelter Heaven then
Anyone know a good standalone OVA to watch? Just 20 minute anime, in and out?
You got 1460kg of thicc awd on 245 fronts (the rims appear to be stock in the show) which probably also means stock suspension too.
If you scrub the fronts they heat up in no time
I think he has front tire overheating or brake fade or something
The R34 wasn't even out when it was made iirc
It was R32
4A-GEU came in 2nd iirc.
The R34 came in 4th stage
Combined with the seat replacement and steering wheel by the time he gets to the 4th stage he could be running 875kg assuming the stock weight of 900kg is accurate.
At the Silver Top he's making 240hp out of a racing engine which is likely lighter than stock.
His trueno was already heavily molded at the start of the show, from what I can tell and the wiki custom suspension, wheels and the 4A-GE was tuned up to 150hp on a close ratio gearbox.
At least in the first two seasons I've seen
No its pretty realistic in most cases.
I just finished Capeta Ep52. Overall, 8/10. The show's biggest weakness is a low budget. It impacts the visual quality of the show, but it does improve over time. Taira Kappeita is not that complicated of a character, but his simplicity works and he is complemented well by the other drivers. With the driving and action, the visuals do hold it back somewhat, but I was still invested. The driving techniques themselves are quite accurate, and overall the show is faithful to karting and Junior formula. The engine sounds for the KT100 seem to have been sampled from an actual Yamaha engine, and same with the Junior Formula cars. I highly recommend this to any car enthusiasts out there, and I think even those who aren't should still give it a shot.
Like an edgy One Punch Man
That sounds epic lmao
Ok Flip Flappers it is then
Which one should I start first?
Flip Flappers
Love Live
RWBY (I'll probably watch this second if not first)
Fair enough.
So they're indoor then?
Don't you go to firing ranges?
***it's balearic mercenary time***
Well not just David, but Diodus Sicilius, Vegitus and basically the entire peoples of the Balearic Islands.
Anime and fantasy in general completely under represents slings for how good of a weapon they are and it's pretty sad.
I heard neither was the Deen adaptation
And were any of em named Kevin?
What's Dinosaur King
I think that could be fair
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
Learn japanese
I mostly watch aired ones, people are gonna know if they finished beforehand to warn me
Where is ~~Myne~~ Bitch?
That last FF episode was probably the best of the season so far
I've only seen S1 tho
Fair point
*He says before not finishing it* <:kappa:690378746657767456>
***DJ Khalid: Suffering from Success***
And either SCnS, Bloody Stream, EoTW, or Traitors Requiem is my favorite OP
Part 4 has probably my favorite battle theme
Araki loves western music, the sheer number of references tells you enough
Who's on first, What's on second, I Don't Know's on third!
Yes.
That and the fact that they end up as 195cm hunks of muscle means that they're already gonna be bigger than most.
They are better fed and deal with less disease so richer people won't have their growth stunted as much.
Of course upper class people will be taller
Why?
Oh yeah, that would be around there
He was at college playing rugby.
Early 20s
Which Jojo?
Both the music and the sound design takes it to another level.
Jojo is a hell of a show to the ears
Yeah, but when there is so much show only the most surface level gets true meme prominence.
It kinda just flanderized itself into a scream
Supposed to be a hissing exhale
***I don't even wanna know about that***
I'm indecisive, what can I say
Yeah. The desert experience.
After the 2020 drought there will be a 2021 rebound.
<:KEK:678339173828001811>aku
Got a little confusing there
Oh, you just worded it like it was another language
Oh, if you have any good slime girl ones send em over
What language gets dubs often enough for that other than English or Japanese? Spanish? French? German? Portugese?
You can read me like a book. I'm sure there are loads more good ships out there.
Are Yang and Ruby actual sisters or just close comrades who call themselves sisters.
128
Wanna hunt for them?
Weiss is best girl until she's hungry, then she is probably is the Gordon Ramsay but on the other side of the restaurant
You're scared of what she's like when she's hungry but just as scared of what she thinks of what you give her
Just got to the food fight in RWBY and it was the best fight of the series so far no cap
Ok Macross Delta then
I'm at the scene where Blake fights Torchwick and it looks alot like something out of SSB ngl.
Cause eurobeat is <a:peepoJAMMER:603930814081794049>
I'm gonna stop here for now, after that I'm gonna read a LN and then watch Initial D Stage 3
Yea
Oh
Look out for it when you get there
Yeah. The movement was pretty two dimensional and all the abilities used did seem like something out of the game series.
End of V2
And then there are those people who just seem to be complete saints and you are forever glad that you know them.
And the OPs have always been something else
AoT has good soundtrack
Nanoha also set a shift in the genre that changed much of the focus to combat too which has been taken to a new level in Asuka
Conception <:PepeWhy:654601787835154442>
Otherwise it's used more like a setting rather than a genre if anything
You've got the girl part for a reason
"I am so absolutely and unhealthily obsessed with you that I will give you a fair opportunity to decide whether you want to return my feelings and enter a relationship with me."
I know that's GT5 but that song is amazing
*eyes close shut*
*i dissipate*
*into thin air*
*i leave no trace*
<:Kampfer:753448006715572284>
Agreed
||These last two seasons have had a habit of people bringing swords to gun fights||
||Maybe he's like a single "specialist" in his unit. I imagine adapting must be difficult, and if you're that good it might be worth it not to.||
AOT S4 E6 ||That was amazing, and Levi still uses the traditional sword ODM Gear, and not the gun version.||
The student council in every anime is literally just a junta change my mind
Some said that about Cyberpunk being delayed 7 million times but look how it turned out...
This. AoT is doing CGI right for the big bois, but IMO scouts don't have near the reason to go CG compared to titans
Does anyone know where to watch Manyuu Hiken-cho
I do wonder how ||Eren kept his leg from regenerating, was it the tied up pant stopping it or a voluntary thing?||
Everyone just feels like a so much more raw version of themselves
That scene with ||Armin and the Colossal Titan|| was so powerful
Indeed it fucking is

***shouldn't it tickle other parts?***
DxD action is nice. It's got some surprising strong points for such a committed harem.
Girls? <:KirikaDisgust:688431636043268097> Give me guys liking other guys <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
That's a classic harem, 1001 Nights style
FranXX <:Ver:704169051391524875>
Everybody wants everybody and they're trying to figure out how to match up, and it ends with defined ships and people being better partners than when they first met eachother.
Idea for a harem
Overuse makes people tired.
Same tbh
Up to the most recent one
Dr Stone S2 ||Senku is vroomer confirmed. But jokes aside, I was thinking that they were gonna use a stirling engine and used ice to cool it instead of a wobbler but i was wrong.||
Man is literally all gun
My War continues to consistently be a banger
it's called Symphogay or something idk
You should see this show
If you think that lore is odd
Uh...where to watch Burst?
They use plastic normally, right?
I forget
Or does it pop on the third click?
Isn't it a springloaded mechanism that can click back 3 times before popping?
Yeah...they literally Burst
Did you have the Burst ones?
Ok, Burst it is then
soo...burst then? Like, which one uses strategy better (better is probably relative)
I mean between Metal and Burst?
What about the combat systems? Which one is better and more fleshed out?
The various shows from the Burst era seems to be the lowest on MAL, but I'l take your word on it
What about Burst?
So metal saga is better than the OG...?
This meme convinced me that I kinda wanna watch Beyblade so anyone have advice or something?
Can I watch too?
Meanwhile in Symphogear XV:
||don't forget the time a lesbian saved the world by handholding an immortal moon god of evil||
The meme that started this convo...
Mechavaranus
Are beyblades just serving the same purpose there that relics do in symphogear?
yes
"Angirus, I'm trying to stomp around, but I'm dummy thicc and the bioacoustics of my asscheeks keeps waking King Ghidorah."
Godzillas getting thicker as they get taller actually follows the square cube law and I like it
Oh ***LAWD*** he thicc
I mean, from what I've seen both those cars and the FW15C are heavily centered around computers assisting the driver and manipulating the car
Like actual F1 but every car is the FW15C lmao
Cyber Formula seems interesting
Just watched WEP Ep4 and that was a goodie.
Couldn't even make it through the first episode
The music is even better if you play Mick Gordon over it lmao
YEs
For the new Slime Episode, play BFG Division from DOOM 2016 in the background, and start the song at 5:06. Trust me.
Lmao
TIL that apparently Initial Ds Blind Attack is actually realistic
Can y'all help me decide which one I should start? https://myanimelist.net/animelist/ZenbuZenvo?status=6
Like where can I get the software?
How do you do that actually?
Stuff gets censored for broadcast, and mistakes get ironed out before disc releases
Wait...Home Video would be best
Which one do I take
Broadcast and home video
There are two subbed versions
So for revue Starlight
Oh yeah, ||and there's also one very significant returning character who's an outsider||
Since when are jellicle cats trying to make it into a play?
You know what the Revue Starlight premise reminds me of? Cats. Both have their characters doing performances to qualify themselves for some kind of selection.
(Revue Starlight) ||GAY GAY HOMOSEXUAL GAY||
Give link
Oh yeah...now I remember
Apparently Lily from Zombie Land Saga ||is pretty trans-coded|| but I don't really remember S1 so can anyone fill me in?
My dudexes, Pacific Rim: The Black ***is the good shit.*** First episode is an absolute banger.
If a man acquired the power of the Female Titan, would he become the Femboy Titan?
The new Slime OP sounds somewhere between a Maria battle and concert song
https://twitter.com/WynnEnby/status/1463316637872963584?t=eOrpHvi1qJn-Unce3t0DUw&s=19
She sounds like the type of girl who'd defend the idea of the IJN 120mm SPG
Should I call it "wheelchair nationalism" as a reference to the idea of "armchair ___" instead?
I'll delete that one then
S1 at least
Yes it is
||K4r1n-ch4n fell from a high place||
Yuuki Yuuna E10
NOOOO E9 HITS EVEN HARDEE
NOOOOIIIII
The ambience at the beginning of E9 hits different
<:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
I just finished Yuuki Yuuna E8
The GATE experience is just "ok" "yeah" "fine" "sure"
I'd enjoy Gate more if the show was a different show
Kick based fighting > punch based fighting (except for Hibiki)
Change my mind
Ok. Midnight in MHA S5 is just annoying so far
Isekai Cheat Magician is so laughably shit I'm pained and enjoyed by it.
Is the Arifueta LN any good?
A pretty fun hatewatch
Isekai Cheat Magician
Whichll have a whole section dedicated to the nihonto circlejerking
I'll keep that in mind in my review
The "it just works" type approach
And Japan didn't know of spring hardening until the west introduced it
And the steel quality of the Japanese was more inconsistent at the time of the Katana
Charlotte (offering weapons): “That blade was forged in an eastern island nation….None of our nation’s smiths could figure out what materials were used or how it was forged. I’m told it was a high quality weapon, though.”

Muller: “That blade is quite thin.”

Charlotte: “Our soldiers also said that made it seem frail.”

Taichi: “I’m not surprised they’d say that when long swords are the mainstay here.”
Oh my God this show circlejerks katanas too
I'm fucking done
Ok so the SAME PEOPLE who made Symphogear S1 also made Isekai Cheat Magician
Maybe if I convince enough people to watch it here the MAL rating will drop to something more appropriate
*think again*
Okay the final battle of Isekai Cheat was literally shitty Dragon Ball
This <@!278860841485598720>
Not that phrasing
It actually fucking did
It did
After he disarmed his (already dis***armed***) opponent mind you
Ok but he can't because he inexplicably lost his sword between camera cuts
He's literally got two arms and a Katana what the fuck is he doing
OK THIS MF GETTING HIS ASS BEAT BY A GUY WITH 1 ARM AND A TINY KNIFE
It's just everything, a full package
And making CG, normally frowned upon so much, look impressively high quality and coherent to the artstyle
What's even crazier is how it's maintained that quality while evolving and changing completely in tone, being both a fast paced show and a slow burn at once, with impactful moments along the way.
This rbh
I will be that boomer who will tell every young kid that AoT was the peak of anime and that it only went downhill from there. Calling it now.
Is it just me or do better anime often take more time or less consistent amounts of time before the OP in episodes?
AnimiXPlay doesn't have the finale of BNHA S5, anyone know what place does?
Oh it's free now
Why does Bakugo call it AP shot when it's clearly HEAT? /J
Turcophobia
An 100,000 soldier large incident of friendly fire
Ok but like you're going in to see that shit if you're watching it
Like it's entire messaging is a bigger mess than the Battle of Karánsebes
And it circlejerks katanas
No its writing is fucked
You seen Isekai Cheat Magician yet?
I'm thinking of watching a new anime.  Ruroni Kenshin, Jujutsu Kaisen, or Samurai Scroll are all on the table. What do you think?

I get that K-Pop and J-Pop in many ways share alot of their origin and are now seeing some cross-pollination, I wonder if eurobeat could or has done the same.
<@87512939107450880> I just had a thought, is there a Korean or Chinese or Taiwanese eurobeat scene?
Ok, I'm discovering Rakim's stuff for myself and damn, no wonder people say he's the GOAT. Liminal in the best way possible, a transition between two different sounds with creative rhymes, smooth flows, and Eric B just going crazy on the mix.
