I
anyway yea hi. I'm Jane-Michelle Bonnlouise Aumansberg-Fogel
ye ye
and after a couple it stopped applying them and I was worried I'd managed to cause something to go horribly awry within my first like four minutes here :P
I couldn't quite make out the emotes so I was cycling through them to find the blue role
Hmm? No no. I meant the role-assigner
I was worried I broke the bot lol
OOH. Good it stuck
hello
I came I saw I conquered
Hana met me on the trans gaming server tho
<@284390402210136064> actually no, I own a personal server called The Magic Planet
crow friend

yeet
I can move the conversacion if y'all would like me to
Maria: Good
Hibiki might be my favorite just because I have a weakness for big happy gay dummies, because I am also that.
Well I was joking but I genuinely do like them all.
Hmm.
me?
I mean I was making a jokle too but I help mod a Studio TRIGGER server and hahahahaHAAAha lord does that get tedious
oh good
good.
all girls

<@!102691114762371072> also thank you for the compliment
(plus I have seasonals to keep up with)
<@297542051057238017> sadly no! I am kind of a slow watcher
and I really like it. It takes a lot of what I love about anime and makes it involve magical girls and lesbiabs, things I also love
and I finished *G* a few days ago
<:HibikiHi:336657249827028993>
hi I'm Jane. 

I was briefly in this server last year but left because I was not caught up and didn't want to be spoiled on anything.

I finished *AXZ* about ten minutes ago and my mind is on fire. But in a good way. 

I will be around from time to time. Pleased to meet you, friends. <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
