guy think's he's really smart for parroting dumb 4chan opinions
That's what it is
It's hard to win an argument against a smart person, but impossible against a dumb person


a friend of mine has these really awful takes about the current situation in the US.
I don't talk about politics alot, but there's something that I wanna get off my chest
<@!676272618839605249> My friend be like:
not that hatred and bigotry doesn't exist, mind you
Most of the people in my country are pretty accepting towards LGBT people.
Olly seems like a fun guy
Philosophytube is one of the few leftist youtubers I can tolerate
it's not to ''look special'' or ''be better'', it's just something to spread positivity and awareness that it's ok to be LGBT.
I think alot of people misunderstand the purpose of Pride Month

Thank you!
i'd like a heart, too <:ShirabeCry:671887081026617345>
If only I still had Discord nitro, i'd send you all a lovely bi-heart emoji
I thought you called this server appreciative?
although I kinda am shortfused.
I try to be a fun person, Meiyi.
Damn. there's that many?
British people going to hell for being british
Shit
Rhode island?
or bi exclusionists
If there's anything I can't respect, it's TERFs.
sometimes, people try to convince me that bisexuality ''doesn't really exist'' and that i'm just pan in denial.
I agree, Kat.
I know, probably shouldn't open it for now.
or even BE part of the LGBT are killed.
Sometimes, people who advocate for LGBT rights are systematically killed in places like in the middle east, but that's a different can of worms that I probably shouldn't open.
I agree.
just hate how /pol/ derails alot of threads on other boards with off topic shit
and they get shit from other boards, luckily.
The nazis are mostly just people from /pol/, Shemmy.
or 4chan in general, because alot of the time people post nothing but stale unfunny memes
I don't really browse /m/ anymore because it's slow as shit these days.
same shit happened with /v/. it's even more shittier today than it was in say, 2012.
those are probably just post 2016 /r/thedonald migrants
/pol/ is awful, but what's wrong with /m/?
at the same time
Alot of people forget that it's possible to like fanservice AND be left leaning.
I guarantee you not everyone who likes Neptunia thinks like this.
and people get mad over that statement
All IF did was say that racism is bad.
now everyone thinks we're just far right incels based on a small,  but loud amount of people on twitter.
These reactions make me ashamed to be a fan of the Neptunia franchise
https://twitter.com/IdeaFactoryIntl/status/1267533296566583302
Can I put something off my chest with you guys for a sec?
Then I would probably avoid them if I were you.
Convince them to change their ways
If someone is being an asshole to you, don't discriminate them based on what they are out of spite.
I don't understand why some people choose to deliberately misgender some trans people out of spite.
Bit of a sensitive topic to bring up, but
You know what I don't get?
It is.
but I should probably not start this discussion, it's kinda depressing
<@!87512939107450880> It's shameful what's happening in the middle east when it comes to trying to raise LGBT positivity
but also because the place would get shittier and shittier as time goes by
I just kinda quit browsing actively because I realize that having a good discussion doesn't really matter that much in the end. because they're all anonymous people you're talking to.
<@!99695384296701952> Honestly, you've got a point.
it's there, but you'll have to dig through.
trying to find good discussion on 4chan is like trying to find diamonds in a heap of pigshit, tbh
I just ignore the shitposters
I hate how people still treat 4chan as if it's some mysterious, evil cult or special club or some other bullshit.
stopped watching there
<@!676272618839605249> >there is a disturbing group n a popular website called ''4chan''
This warms my heart

I forgot who
hell, her death was inspired by the death of... I think the scriptwriter's mother?
I think Aerith is supposed to represent maternity, since she's essentially the caretaker of your party as she's the healer.
It's called ROBLOX
besides, we already have a different game fitting for that title :^)
I just cringe a little whenever I see some people call it ''ANTIFA: THE GAME.'' or some other dumb shit.
Of course
although tbf I see alot of people try to talk about FF7 even though they haven't played past disc 1
||Hell, at the end of disc 2 Barret even admits that his tactics used against shinra was ultimately for the worse, since it affected so many innocent lives.||
I feel like alot of people miss the point of FF7 when it comes to its narrative, it's more than just a environmental story.
Also, (FF7 spoilers)
Oh, but CoD is, or atleast, the campaigns from what i've played are political, though.
Obviously, people are free to criticize poorly executed political narratives in fiction, but let's not pretend that games have never been political.
I often see people making the argument that western games have messages equivalent to ''DRUMPF BAD'' among other things, but I've never actually have even heard of a single game that is like this.
I was just kidding
is Pong political?
How about Pong,
I wish I was kidding.
I am having a long discussion with a friend of mine about how there are no real life politics in japanese video games
I miss 2008 Roblox
I used to play it alot when I was 12-13
where you build stuff sorta like lego. it's like, proto minecraft
Roblox is a game
Nier's narrative was inspired by the 9/11 terrorist attacks
There is this one scene in LoGH that is considered debatable in terms of ethics, but it involves spoilers.
I mean, LoGH is pretty political. but it has alot of shades of grey in it. you'll have different characters with different ideals in ways that come off as nuanced and not as overly preachy, IMO.
With anime like Gundam and LoGH existing since the 80s, how could anime NOT have been political back then?
the same could be said about anime.
But anyway, I'm not even that politically active and even I can see that alot of games are political.
Aerith is just so perfect in terms of personality
I mean, uhm. Oh.
YOUVE NEVER HEARD OF ROBLOX?
what, about roblox?
I made a buzzword salad, Pepsi
Can't possibly like anime tiddies unless you're a far right neo nazi incel pedo virgin, am I right?
I'm just so fucking sick of it, honestly.
People on twitter will just throw the word ''pedo'' randomly around when people draw art of anime characters and it gets so fucking tiring.
I keep telling myself to quit but
sometimes twitter takes so much energy from me that I just can't do anything anymore
you're obviously free to criticize art you dislike, but don't tell people to die or throw names around.
I don't get why it's so difficult for people to just be calm and reasonably criticize things while also not be toxic about it at the same time.
No. harassment and telling people not to draw things you don't like is not reasonable criticism.
ITs JusT CrItIcIsM BrO
bonus points whenever artists get harassed people will say
and while I am not an ancom, it is rather interesting to read.
I have that in my shelf, actually.
I'm more of a classic fiction guy
I don't read that much theory, honestly. only philosophical stuff I've read was Chomsky.
||Although seeing the situation in america has made me push even further to the left than it has ever done before||

The all lives matter phrase is dumb, yeah. no one is actually saying that some lives matter less.
The US is easily a shittier place to be LGBT or black than say, The netherlands.
Obviously, but some places are more shitty than the others.
You know, I find it strange that someone who spoke up against injustices and unequality in islamic countries also somehow would turn a blind eye to what is going on in the US. https://twitter.com/Ayaan/status/1270559508931084288
This guy has such a fucking victim complex and it makes me cringe

but why is that so important for some people?
Obviously I look at the world in a different way than I did as a kid
I realize that, Kaiyo
What I don't get however is that people have to take Zwarte Piet so serious. like, as if changing it is a threat to dutch culture or some dumb shit.
I know this isn't a really substantial argument, but It's just something I've thought.
like a ''helper'' a ''buddy.''
I don't mind the changes to Zwarte Piet, honestly. although in fairness, as a kid I never really perceived him as a racist caricature. just a helping friend to Sint.
Yes
we kindof have a dark history of colonialism and a holiday that the rest of the world looks down upon because it's kinda racist
sure, it's not perfect or anything like that
but I'm still overall happy living in the netherlands.
You're right.
Don't you realize that helping people is the same as babying them??

We need to fight censorship... with censorship!
I don't think so, I just think that they only care about free speech when it is in their favor.
you know, someone who has shown disdain for free speech?
why are so many anti-censorship/pro free speech people in favor of voting for Trump?
Graham Linehan can go fuck himself
fucking rednecks
Inbreeding makes people dumb, huh
Also, weird how these people are allowed to carry weapons and the police doesn't seem to care, but meanwhile, when people peacefully protest against police brutality, cops will instigate violence against unarmed citizens.
Why are people like this

Hell, why shouldn't I take action against my former high school bullies?
taking action against people does, getting people banned from places. I'm also a strong advocate for acts of physical violence towards hate groups
But that doesn't make bad people go away!
I see it everywhere, outside, on the internet, in workplaces, schools
These days, it takes a very harsh hand in order for people to be taught in order how to be part of society
Free speech is a sickness
So, what do you suggest I do, then? sit idly by and watch people be awful human beings?
I think people should be held responsible for their actions, if someone makes racist remarks to a minority, they should face the consequences
But the moment I want to take action against certain bad people I'm seen as the bad guy, why?
People on the internet can be terrible, abuse eachother, lie and they have the freedom to get away with it
I've been bullied, physically abused, discriminated and the people who did it didn't get any consequences for it because of their freedoms
I fail to see why so many people value certain freedoms so much?
It's something I've thought about for a while
Oh
Who's going to get rid of the bad people if there were no rulers?
I simply want to create a perfect society where all the bad people are kept in line
I can't be the ruler I often dream of being, but a man can dream
no experience
I have no charisma, no skills, no inside power
...but that is all just a fantasy. I am not fit for ruling a society
only wrongdoers need to worry, including nazis, racists, bullies, etc.
It's not a dystopia for you
My empire
I want a strong authoritarian society where bad people are punished
all at the expense of freedoms
I simply wish for a society where everyone is nice to eachother, no more racism, no bigotry, no ableism, no homophobia, etc.
Another counter argument I hear is that killing racists, nazis, etc. might only help them to drive even further to be racist
I suppose that is a good argument against excessive force, now that you mention it
What do you mean?
Usually it just means that you are giving them the terms by giving them room
and they did, but debates, platforming, etc. doesn't always work
If I recall correctly, there was a african american man who sat down with over 200 KKK members and then persuaded all of them to drop their racist ways
Murdering nazis isn't wrong
These people need to be physically removed and be made examples of in order to teach people the fears of consequences
^
I'm merely sharing my experiences
Yeah, who is?
I've been slandered
You don't know what it's like to deal with the same shit every single day in your high school life, being unable to escape and no one to help you
I can't shoot up a school because firstly, we don't have rights to firearms where I live and secondly I'm too cowardly to do it
I can't
Bullies won't stop until they're good as dead
I often see these sayings about revenge and regret being said by people who don't have experience in it
Has there ever been notable cases of people who took revenge and showing regret afterwards?
I never did anything wrong to anyone during my high school years, but I've been an outcast, I've been abused, humiliated. and often outside of high school and on the internet I am discriminated for being who I am
Why?
The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good people to do nothing
Well, sitting by and doing nothing does no good either
Why is it that often when I think of solving certain problems, violence is something that comes to mind?
If only there was some way I could make the former high school bullies who wronged me be held responsible without resorting to deadly violence
it would either be toppled by a violent uprising or a neighbouring country would step in by orders of the UN
I don't think my leadership would last all that long, if I think about it
My only wish is for every single person in the world to just be nice to eachother
Would my tactics not work?
it's the fear of consequences that prevents people from being bad
Now imagine if the school actually PUNISHED those bullies, then bullying would've dramatically decreased
My high school just let students do shit without taking action, they should've actually gotten off their lazy asses and done something about the bullies who kept torturing me. but all I got is ''just ignore them, lol!''
Oh, but I think you do
Like, how does protecting the freedoms of certain bad people benefit us?
But you're a good person, though. if we lived in a society where all bullies, nazis, racists or whatever were persecuted how would that be bad for people like us?
Impossible, there's too many bad people in our societies to make that happen
Oh, oops
I don't want my parents dead, though
But my mind keeps telling me that I should do what I should've done 10 years ago
It was all years ago
How is it silly?
I treasure them more than anyone else in this world
My parents are by no means awful, I just didn't want them to worry
Eventually they did find out
the sadness, the disappointment
I did not want them to bear the shame
and worse, I was too afraid to tell my parents
I could not do anything
But trads are a bunch of LARPers anyway so who cares what they have to say
Trads are so silly to me
Why is there so much suffering in the world?
Should internet trolls go to jail?
But I guess what I really want to ask is, What are some other good counter arguments against legislating the internet?
like YouTube for instance
Unfortunately there's too many platforms where racism is ignored
Actually, you know what? I've thought about whether legislating the internet would fix bigotry and harassment online, but I think deplatforming works best rather than letting the law handle it
I want to ask a question
It's not murder
I mean, why should people who actively destroy other people's lives be kept alive?
But, if I were ruler I'd physically remove bullies tbh.
Expulsion
Oh, but you can.
It's too bad teachers haven't figured this out yet
This is how it should work, a group of people want to commit awful actions, and these actions lead to consequences that make them hold accountable. and it is because of those very consequences that creates a ''fear of consequences'' within people, and those fear of consequences are the very thing that prevents them from committing more bad actions. and when people don't commit bad actions because of the fear of consequences, you got societal order. and when you got societal order, you got no conflict! presto! I just figured out how to run a perfect utopia!
A logical counter argument to ''don't feed the trolls'' or ''just ignore them bro'' is that you are rewarding them by not making them hold accountable and not giving them consequences for their actions
Why are we often told to ''ignore'' trolls, bullies, etc? when a logical counterargument to this would be to take action against them?
I got a question
but this is not the world we live in, there's way too many bad people
In a perfect, ideal world, we wouldn't need laws, we wouldn't need authority
and sometimes, too many people just... don't care.
I agree that the law's purpose should be to keep humans in order, but too many people inside and outside have abused this system
and yet, human nature is constantly out of order, even within those ''in charge''
He is too dangerous for society
I don't understand why they just... you know. keep him locked away forever
Varg burned a church, right?
something like that
I've heard of norwegian ''vacation prisons''
if I don't hold them accountable in some way, who will?
But not taking action just rewards them for their wrongdoings
and worse, the people who wronged me never were held accountable for it
I can't even sleep without thinking about certain events that happened sometimes
Years of emotional and physical torment, for one
The problem is, is that too many people have made it clear that society needs to be ruled with a harsh hand in order to teach people how to be part of society. there's too many people who actively destroy other's lives without any real repercussions
Do you not want a society devoid of hate?
no conflict, no hate, no bigotry, no racism, no discrimination
and when no one can be mean, you'd have peace
everyone
I simply want a society where everyone is nice to eachother, that's all
I've seen the errors of my ways
If only there was some more decent way I could hold the people who wronged me accountable, though
I don't want to live a life of hatred, revenge or rage
I want to appologize.
I appologize for the late response, I've been somewhere
What's that?
I don't live in the US, so I'm not exactly one to say
Well, I think it should
The truth is that these days, people need a harsh hand in order to be taught how to be part of society
I agree, which is why I am against free speech. free speech just means that intolerant people can get away with saying awful things without consequences
What do people see in free speech? why do people value it so much?
I think people should be held responsible for what they say and what they do. like, if someone yells out racial slurs in front of a black person, then why shouldn't they be held accountable for it? if some jackass decides to yell spoilers in a movie theater, why shouldn't his life be more difficult?
I don't think Free Speech is good
I wanna leave a hot take
What do you mean? ''at the top''?
Nazism for example is banned in my country and for good reason
Well... why shouldn't some ideas be repressed?
What do you want me to say?
I'm not sure what you mean by that
I beg for forgiveness
I didn't see the name
There will be consequences
Be nice. or else
and there'll be no problems
Just be nice to eachother?
The only real advice I can give to people is uhh...
Fuck him
For a moment I thought it was Kevin Spacey in the thumbnail, but it was Alex Jones
I think the most common counter argument to separating art from the artist that I've come across is that by doing so, you reward the artist
Is separating art from the artist actually bad when it comes to enjoying media made by problematic people?
There is something I actually want to discuss because I am curious about what others think
I understand
it should be them whose lives should be unbearably difficult
All I want to know is, why is society rewarding these people?
And yet one person decided to spread fake rumors about me, so that the entire school could use me as a punching bag
I didn't do anything to ANYONE
I'm a mental cripple
All because of those dipshit teachers and bullies
I've never been able to finish high school
My life is already ruined
It means that your enemy is winning
But atleast I know some people who actually DO know what should be done to chickenshit ableists who mistreat people for being different
You know, I've tried everything. tried thinking positive, meditate, go jogging
For 2 years during 2014-16
It simply means you're giving them the terms
Not wanting to take action against the people who wronged you makes you weak. timid. lazy
I've been told to get help, but the truth is that getting professional help doesn't really change anything for me
Almost every night, every day it's the same thoughts in my head
Why do I live like this
It's a good thing that Bryan Singer is pretty much no longer allowed to step a foot near filmmaking, atleast
Yeah, like Roman Polanski or Bryan Singer
That being said, I don't think anyone who enjoys watching a movie made by someone problematic is a bad person by default
For example, Kevin Spacey movies just aren't really the same, ESPECIALLY American Beauty and Usual Suspects
I also understand that association can change your perception on a certain work of art
I understand that
What's tulpa?
I think foreign policy is an interesting topic I'd like to learn about, it is what makes the world what it is today, after all
It's a video essay mostly centered around US foreign policy, it's really interesting and goes into extensive detail about the history of the US military while also criticizing it
did any of you see this?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SmpkdPm9eeQ
a simple ''I'm sorry'' probably wouldn't suffice after what I said to him
I guess all of this happened because I am annoyed that he can't be convinced even when he's clearly wrong. or the fact that he's been ignoring me for a few days. but what I am wondering is, how do I apologize for my behavior towards him?
I've been feeling bad lately. a few days ago I lost my composure at someone who I've known for years and basically ended their relationship. to be fair, I feel bad because I did end the friendship in a rather emotionally explosive manner.
I'm already sick of seeing NFTs everywhere

I didn't learn much french, actually. but I did watch alot of german movies for german class
It's one of the best movies I've ever seen
Yeah, I should rewatch it
that movie has probably the most accurate depiction of Paris in film
Speaking of societal racism, have you guys ever seen La Haine?
That being said, I didn't feel like I was being targeted or looked down on when I was in Tokyo
That's awful
lots of poverty and crime in Paris
and I'm not just talking about Japan, Paris and Los Angeles aren't as glamorous and lovely as in the movies
It's kinda strange how media has warped some people's perception on certain places in the world, now that I think about it
it destroys people's lives

Yeah
I've had bad experience with some neptunia posters on twitter and... well, other sites.

I remember this time when some guy yelled at me for being a ''censorship apologist'' simply because I didn't mind Tifa wearing a sports bra in the FF7 remake
People like OAG or BlacksageD who dedicate their entire personality towards irrelevant culture war bullshit are some of the strangest people on the planet
atleast, that's what I'm assuming
Well, that might be because you're not on twitter

I'm worried about what's gonna happen to Ukraine and possibly, the rest of europe

The world has never really rewarded you for being good
The unfortunate reality is that also sometimes, people get rich by unethical means
Do people really wake up and think to themselves: ''Oh! I'm gonna go and work for a company responsible for many deaths from terrible diseases!''
You know what boggles my mind? how people continue to work in places like the Tobacco industry
So I dunno what to do
Years go by, experiences are gained while experiences are lost, regrets mount up and options become fewer, I forget the things I want to remember and remember the things I want to forget
People also constantly look down on me
Well, one of my best friends left me, I can't enjoy anime as much as I used to and got barely the energy to finish a series and I'm not sure what I'm doing with my life
Life isn't going all that well for me and I want to talk to someone
But I also think it's hard to stay mad when there's alot of nice things in the world
I guess I could be pissed off and depressed over the things that happened to me and what is going on in the world
You know, like neo nazis
What good is democracy and free speech when it benefits those who actively seek to get rid of those things?
Iraq was once a peaceful country before Saddam's reign and before the US army invaded
Why was America able to help countries like Germany and Japan get back on their feet after WW2, but not other countries they fought in years later like in Afghanistan and Iraq?
I got a question
Do the ends justify the means?
What is this?
I have to mask constantly, life is substantially more difficult for me
So I dunno, how do I cope with all this?
Well, to be fair, I don't really feel like I'm being accepted by society as a person with autism, hell. scientists haven't fully figured out what autism is, so living the life in the mind of something you don't understand terrifies me
I need help
nice mustache
I like Asuna, but I'm not exactly a fan of SAO
also Girls und Panzer & Sora no woto
K-on, Lucky Star, Aria, Kiniro Mosaic, Nichijou & Azumanga are better CGDCT anime
Eromanga Sensei is the anime that I have the least amount of tolerance for
I really cannot stand that, either
Oh, Eromanga Sensei
No, I hate it because it's an awfully written pile of shit
inb4 ''HAHA U JUS HAET IT BECUZ UR FAVORITE GIRL LOST''
I really cannot stand Oreimo
her
A character I like from an anime I hate?
They really want me to watch Yuyushiki.

it's pretty fun

but I am currently watching Kiniro Mosaic
might give it a chance.
gemini seems to get alot of hate
Is Darker than Black worth watching?
SUPER MARIO IN ANIME


I kinda wish the rest of the show was like episode 1, but it's still comfy
Glad you like it!
<:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>


the first episode in particular is pretty well directed, engrish aside.
It's about a japanese girl who used to live in England with her english friend who are now living life in japanese high school.
Kiniro Mosaic
it's actually a pretty good CGDCT series

I spy Yuri undertones

shid




did someone say maoyu?
Fuck yeah
Lesbian pirates in space

I hear it's similar to Madoka
should I watch Yuki Yuna?
I hear Rayearth's a classic
üí•üî´
IT WAS A JOKE
WAIT
sounds stupid
What's a symphogear?
oh and I also like Flip Flappers and Cutie Honey. probably should mention that
Anyone got suggestions for some good Magical Girl series? I like Madoka, Precure, Princess Tutu and Cardcaptor Sakura
I think I know what you want to say
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1M-UyPbL6s
also do I see Gundam talk üëÄ
and also if you like Fate?
Is Illya prisma worth watching if you're looking for a magical girl series?

I'm calling the police
I don't really like it, though.
I've watched that years ago but don't remember much of it
There he is, officier! that's the guy who pretends to like Symphogear to get the Chris cosplayer to like him.
but instead of developing video games, it's writing manga.
It's kinda similar to New Game

I am currently watching Comic Girls
Thank you!
too busy consuming other media
I'm not really an avid VN reader, but I am interested.
but machine translated, right?
Is it?
I can get some of the word puns in Monogatari
other LNs that i'd like to read that are currently untranslated are Horizon in the middle of nowhere and probably Rakudai
the only LN I've really read is Index. and even then I still need to finish it
trying to learn Kanji looks nightmarish
I am really interested in White Album 2 VN as well as Closing Chapter
Should I really learn japanese just to experience untranslated VNs?
I am aware
I still have to find a better romance anime than Banner of the stars II and White Album 2, though
I'm not THAT invested into Yuri, but I am interested
as well as Maria watches over us
I hear Bloom into You is a good Yuri
>Light Novel adaptation
but
I like the chara designs
is Ore Twintail any good?
I don't really recall it's been a long time since I last watched it
I think so, Kaguya
This but unironically
this is a VERY important detail worth paying attention to, btw
The hips don't even shake in sync with the BPM in the OP
they're not really known for having a high production value
It's Deen
I mean,
I don't really mind the excessive fanservice, personally.
It's okay, I like the relationship between the two characters. but other than that, it's really nothing special
Has anyone here watched Sakura Trick?
<@!278860841485598720> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzfhU8t5i8
Kaos a cute

I finished watching Comic Girls the other day
when did the movie come out?
When I was in Japan they were selling a shitload of toys of them
Yeah, it's a pretty cool concept.
Train mecha
but I have not watched it
I've heard of it

alot of it is classic mecha anime
175 tv anime series, to be exact
Started watching a classic, by the way
I got a big PTW list, too
I am close to 80
let people enjoy things
I don't get why so many people look down on people who like Ecchi anime
Shirabe's a qt
Clannad is good too, but I really wanna read the VN of that
Yuru Camp, K-on & Hidamari Sketch are good, though.
I didn't really like Wotakoi personally

It still feels unreal that Mazinger Z got subbed
I've watched OG Mazinger Z in blu ray quality with actual subs

I'd rather not be watching something with crabsticks
also isn't Might Gaine not fully subbed?
<@!279341087494242304> But I was thinking of watching Knights of Sidonia after this
I just think the show is shit
I don't get why people take shipping THIS seriously.

Shut up shut up shut up Kirino I hate you
I really can't stand Oreimo

oh, shit
does it already have a BD release?
if there's anything you recommend/don't recommend, feel free to point it out
https://mydramalist.com/dramalist/Silkdegrees/plan_to_watch
I also made a toku list, to add to the heap, Milh
https://myanimelist.net/animelist/SilkDegrees?status=6&tag=
just look at how big my PTW is
Just..

<@!238855496797257729> Actually, that was released earlier
The 2nd season of Banner of the stars really hit hard

Lafiel is my waifu
<@!139432096023183360> Me watching Crest of the stars
Anyone ever watched Rose of Versailles?

c'mon, son.
How can you look at this shit and think ''THEYRE JUST FRIENDS''
re:cutie honey is good
<@!160142617940590594> It's nothing but Yuri!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBIdcUxdgo0
KALIMA
Suuure.

It's not as good as Heartcatch IMO but it's decent fun
I am watching Suite Precure
It doesn't help that I also cannot fucking stand Oreimo
both are hot garbage
oh I forgot to mention ''Umaru'' and ''Eromanga Sensei'' when I named the ''animemes-core''
the character designs in Yorimori don't appeal to me as much as some of the other SOL anime i've seen, for some reason.
especially since Aoba is in it
How could it not?
I hear that's good, but what's so interesting about watching a series about a group of girls going to antarctica?
You mean a place further than the universe?
Yorimori?
New Game is funny, yeah
especially the movie.
I did not expect to really like that, but it's alot of fun
I also really like GuP
Cute girls doing cute things
but Sora no Woto comes close
or Nichijou
or K-on or Lucky Star
or Yuru Camp
or Aria
Sora no Woto is still the most based CGDCT show
It's either Kobayashi, Jojo, Gabriel Dropout, MHA, Love is War, Senko san, Konosuba or some other FOTM show
Don't fuck with us animemes posters, we've only watched 10 anime.
as is most of /r/animemes
<@!278860841485598720> Yeah, I find the memes to be painfully unfunny.
AKA hot garbage
I kinda avoided it because I always assumed it was just /r/animemes-core
is gabriel dropout worth watching or is it just meme bullshit
nothing special, but it's fun
Yuru Yuri is decent

Shut up kirino I hate you so goddamn much
although not as dangerous as Brazil
but I hear it's dangerous
I wanna travel to Argentina some time
Buenos Aires?
Where exactly in Argentina, if I may ask?
time for the big hierba
Big Big Chinga
I am not good at spanish
yo soy el grando pendejo
Puta madre!
Now you got me curious
I'll watch to episode 6 then
if I wanted SoL, I'd just rewatch K-on or Aria
not to mention, It's too much SOL and less Mahou Shoujo
the music is extremely good, and the fight scenes are interesting, it's just the world building that kinda feels... off.
does it get any better later on? i'm only at episode 4 and i'm already struggling with it
and I have very mixed feelings for it.
So I'm watching Yuki Yuuna
You ever visited the Iguazu falls?
any other weapon than gun?
sword!
lance!
gun!
knife!
Stick!
uhh...
staff!
bow!
<@!95698695701397504> Oh, I can think of a couple of reasons why people watched Maouyuu yuusha
I might as well just read the novels
season 3 never
I found Spice & Wolf to be fun
<:KirikaPog:605209108827734017>
<:ChrisPray:672578403156885504>
'course not.
I wish that daki was me
God
we stan Maou in this house


I really cannot get over how cute she is

MAOU SAMA
Shamiko or Satania?

I'll consider it
not as good as Machikado Mazoku, though.
eugh

got a good few chuckles, nothing really special. but it's not bad
Watching Gabriel Dropout, and I expected to really dislike it, but so far it's actually decent
Look at this smug little devil
KORE DE KATTA TO OMOU NA YOOO
as someone who really likes LoGH, Berserk and Tatami Galaxy, I really cannot stand their fanbases.

I don't know if I posted this before, but here goes.
<@262326868366065664> Hestia a bestia
I mean, I only mentioned Heartcatch because Suite is the season that follows after it
Not as good as Heartcatch, but it's fun
Suite is pretty good so far
Dab on em Precure haters
Oh. right
BGS?
hope you'll enjoy it!
Promare is fantastic

the golden age arc movies are fine, too.
Just stick to the manga.
I avoided Berserk 2016 like the plague
I don't really mind the art style change, it's closer to the LN
Sorry, had to post it
Berserk Sakuga https://media1.tenor.com/images/723ec5d9a472c9bd63669f3625ffbd7d/tenor.gif?itemid=9724918
Season 3 was kinda meh IMO. but I think the first two seasons are some of the finest ecchi anime i've seen.
I like DxD, up until season 3
The LoGH fanbase on MAL is really elitist and annoying.
and not based manga reader
Only if they're animeonly
I sleep
>Circlejerk subreddits
speaking of precure
and again, I don't think I should say it.
No, no. worse.
It's because I hear a different word when they do, but I don't think I should say what.
I'm just like: ''STOP SAYING THAT.'' whenever I hear it.
You get what I mean?
or maybe that's a personal problem
Let's just say that the way how the Negatones yell their cries is a bit of a... Freudian Slip, of some sorts and I cringe a little inside.
How do I explain this
One thing I want to mention about Suite precure is that I find the monsters off putting for an odd reason.
Isn't Doki Doki considered to be one of the lesser good seasons?
^
What would you say is a good watch if I'm looking for a good story with a few twists here and there?
That is too bad.
Well, what are your favorite seasons?
I'm curious myself
I hear Smile is better
üí•üî´

any last words?
You've got 5 seconds to live.
gun!
Not because of the spoiler, but because of that pun.
Hate you. so much right now.
I just...
So I have no reason to give up watching now
I am not clicking that
That can't be the biggest spoiler though
You fool!
I already saw that
It's too late
Not a fan of Hibiki & Kanade constantly arguing with eachother.

Jetman
His name is God Noodle


He's the greatest MoTW, ever. period
Isn't he perfect?
I don't think so.
This guy as a MoTW?
Does Precure have...
which I probably should
The one that I still haven't finished, yet
the villain in the first season
Who names their villains pissard?
do they spoil anything related to the TV series?
Do I need to watch all of the shows first before watching the all star films?
I got a question for the Precure fans in here.

DxD is fun
or Heartcatch Precure
actually, my favorite mahou shoujo, right next to Princess Tutu
Madoka is one of my favorite anime
(Kaiji spoilers) ||AAAANDOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOU||
Aaa-
A-

been watching Oresuki
Have any of you watched Minky Momo or Creamy Mami?
I'm going to watch Fate Kaleid Liner Prisma Illya
Welp

I prefer Birdy's 90s design, honestly.
is the TV series any good?
the 90s one
Oh, I only watched the OVA
with extra dip
I'll have two number 9s
They're wrapped burgers
Big Smoke's order but in anime

basketball
And I also happen to be a fan of...
heard it's really good
I am watching Kuroko right now
Base...ketball?
Good taste
Sherlock, Utaha AND Big Tiddy elf in the same harem? <@!453836798796234762>

I've been thinking of learning moonrunes at some point
N-No more Symphogear?
<:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
Oof
in the middle of watching XV right now, actually
Also, no spoilers please.
Was it ever said that XV would be the final season?
Have some Satania
I've only watched the first two seasons and read a little of the manga
Ye

how is it?
I still need to watch the new Railgun
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ut5sk0RUlS4
It's ENDLESS TRASH
Yeah, me too
Actually, Needless was the first manga I read to completion

The anime ends with an anime original ending
üöî
https://myanimelist.net/animelist/SilkDegrees?status=6&tag=
I have like, alot of shit on my PTW and am not THAT interested in it, but people keep insisting me to watch it
Should I watch Darker than Black?
pretty generic and forgettable, although the chara designs were cute
I did not like Denpa onna

Magical Girl Squad
https://myfigurecollection.net/picture/1295703&context%5B%5D=itemId%3A72377
Heartcatch has some of the best transformation sequences i've ever seen
oh yeah, absolutely.
Atleast One Piece has appealing sakuga... at times.
the animation is fucking awful at times.
but...
It's fun to watch, but
I am still currently watching the first season of Precure
pricur

I hear there's a remake coming
Is Tokyo Mew Mew worth watching/reading?
oh and Konosuba
Danmachi too
and more
||Infinite Stratos||, Highschool DxD, Monogatari Series and Index
I want to read
I've been thinking of getting into LNs
I wasn't particularly keen on the anime adaptation, but I heard the LN is much better
https://myanimelist.net/manga/51227/Taimadou_Gakuen_35_Shiken_Shoutai?q=taimadou
also, anyone know this is worth reading?
Cross Ange looks fun
stuff like Kamen Rider, Super Sentai
something similar to tokusatsu, <@!676272618839605249>
What are some good Toku-like anime?
I can't really take MAL's scores at face value
I haven't seen the show yet, but I am interested in it
I don't get why people hate Happiness Charge Precure's artstyle
not haram
It's harem
since I havent watched that many
I mean, SOME ecchi anime.
I like ecchi anime
Space elves

I hear that one is good

I am currently reading Yona of the dawn and it's pretty good.

qt
is Strike Witches good?
Zawa zawa
Zawa...

<@!202444817043685386>
Hmhm

Manga Time Kirara's manga are so fun and cute
The thing is, the anime adaptation is only a small portion of the manga, which is currently over 40 volumes long
I hear alot of good things about it
Should I read Skip Beat?

<@!676272618839605249> If it's an older anime series, then it's probably Layzner
Was it a mecha series?
it's sortof a parody on battle shonen series
Needless is not really for everyone, but if you like stuff like TTGL then I highly recommend it.
don't worry about the spoiler, I did not click it
which is an anime & manga that I really like
apparently it's sortof like Needless?
I've not watched Scryed yet, but I wanted to know if it was worth watching
Any of you watched Scryed?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dc9RKRoMO4
<@!202444817043685386> Yes except New Game is actually funny and good

excuse me?
Yuru Camp

Let's talk about the best anime of 2018:
i'm considering ordering volumes
how is the physical release for Yuru Camp & Kiniro Mosaic?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MaLQrpZeNU
Lupin's a nice man.
pretty badass
I started watching Scryed today
I am rewatching Gundam SEED
and Jesus wept.

the absolute state of anime during the Reiwa period.
fucking Mitsuboshi colors has a moment where it's a fucking slideshow of still images for 20 entire seconds.
Atleast it has some appealing animation instead of the usual still frames and flapping mouths that 90% of modern anime has
which is another Doga Kobo series I liked
It's made by the same author of Mikakunin, too.
match made in heaven
It's Doga Kobo AND Manga Time Kirara
should I watch it?
Sansha Sanyou looks cute
Have you prayed to your lord and savior, today?
also Astolfo has a flesh fang and that's a 10/10 design
<@!115744398997716995> There are like, tons of different and better alternatives with big boobs.
but I think Uzaki Chan is ugly.
Unpopular opinion
It looks interesting.

has anyone here seen Betterman?
How nice of you.
Why, thank you!
<@!453836798796234762> I think Uzaki Chan is ugly
I take everything I said about Uzaki Chan back

It is no Zaku, boy.
I want it so badly, bros...
I saw a MG Gouf the other day, but it was 50 bucks <:ShirabeCry:671887081026617345>

Oh yeah, I found this at the local hobby store.
period.
Manga Time Kirara is the best at CGDCT.
also it's Manga Time Kirara, so it's a given that it's gonna be good.
I can recommend it for all fans of moe, really.
I'm kidding, obviously. but Gochuumon is a pretty chill and lighthearted show that has a nice european style setting.
.....FOR NOW.
No knockin on the door is necesarry. üôÇ
and it's a funny anime.
I just think the anime OP is catchy, lol.
It's not what you think it is.
Uhh.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7bIBZ6M0-tU
the twitter timeline for me has been nothing but people harassing people for liking Uzaki Chan
I didn't know people were so heated about Uzaki Chan.

Is Toku allowed here?
is Rinne no Lagrange good?
also
I might give Strike Witches another chance
Charlotte is best girl
so if there's anyone with shit taste, it's me
I enjoyed Infinite Stratos
I mean
so why does this got a low rating, again?
Ok, so I'm watching Rinne no Lagrange and I really like the visuals alot, so far.
Starting this thing
Origination is my favorite season
I hope you'll like all of it
Good, good!
<@!278860841485598720>

It's a pity that you discover a cute looking magical girl anime from the early 90s, but as it turns out, only 9 episodes were subbed
I take it you guys catched the stream?

I really like the character designs
I'll check it out, then
Also super hyped about the new Getter Robo thing
Is Assault Lily Bouquet worth watching?
And it's actually pretty good
I started watching Assault Lily Bouquet
Soylent Green

Started watching this for my first time
but not enough
Some, yes
I kinda wish there was more yuri in it, though
I know this show
currently watching the OVA
It's done by some of the people who worked on Princess Tutu and I really like the character designs
Mahoutsukai Tai, AKA Magic User's Club

''FIRE!'' or ''HES GOT A GUN!'' aren't the worst things you can yell in a crowded manga store
I'm mixing anime with real movie spoilers from other movies that you may already know
I'm doing fake spoilers
Gurren Lagann is not real!
Tohru is Kobayashi's father
And...
Hibiki was a ghost the whole time
Like in Madoka Magica, where it turns out that Homura is actually Keyser Soze
Ever since the Covid outbreak started, I've made a solemn vow, never to reveal any details of a climactic anime ending
You're not making a Disney movie over here
||Something sad happens? poof, we brought the character back, lol! just kidding! shes back!||
||the reset||
same as Clannad, but I've seen it and liked the 2nd season alot, although I kinda have mixed feelings over the ending because of
I know enough people who hate it
Even if they aren't dramatically damaging my enjoyment, I'd still try to avoid spoilers because if you do give out spoilers, you ARE still altering my perception and expectations and that's kindof a dickish thing
While I don't necesarilly think spoilers are as damaging as most people make them out to be, I do prefer the option to go in media as blind as possible
but then again, I watched Clannad knowing what was gonna happen, and still felt heartstrung when it did happen
Now, I already know one certain plot detail (then again, who doesn't at this point), but I'm still slightly interested in watching it
People tell me Your Lie In April is either the most overrated romance anime ever made, or one of the best ones
Who am I even supposed to listen to

And the holy spirit
The son
The father
He can't do that, he is jesus

I like Yuna's character design

Look what I just started watching
This show has alot of screencap potential
You called?
Look at this bear
Do any of you guys know any other cute isekai anime akin to Bofuri or Kuma Kuma Kuma Bear?
Like I said before, this show has alot of screencap potential

I want to rewatch GuP eventually
It's nothing special, but I like it, it's a fun lighthearted anime short with some good chemistry between the characters
I've been watching Tawawa on Monday
after all these years
I have yet to experience another anime with more down to earth romance than White Album 2
This looks like a fun anime
I like the character designs
average, but not too bad
I am watching it right now, it's harmless
is this anime any good?

I've been rewatching Kill Me Baby

I was rewatching Kill Me Baby

is Magical Circle Guruguru worth watching?

I am watching Aharen San
It's nothing really special, but I enjoy it
^
it's got character designs done by the artist who did Yuru Yuri
Fantasy anime that's sortof a parody on Dragon Quest with 4 girls who go on quests and study at adventure school
it's fun
I've been watching Endro

I still regularly listen to music from the Wild Arms games

Do you guys like Huey Lewis?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujJFfAUY3D4
if an album got Robert Fripp involved, it's a given I will like it
Though I may be biased, since Heroes involves Fripp & Eno
My favorites are easily Low & Heroes
I like that album, it's not one of my favorites of Bowie, but I'd still say it's a very good album

Any Jazz Fusion enthusiasts in here?
Hard to believe this was made in 1994

best radio stations
Vice City had the best use of licensed songs in any game
I really like Discipline, though
I've not listened to all of King Crimson, atleast not yet
You mean where they did Discipline?
I think Fear of Music is better than Remain in Light, btw
Holy shit, you read my mind
Do you like Talking Heads?
I think I slightly prefer Heroes, too

It's not Fast and Bulbous enough
for me that would probably be Safe As Milk
but I wouldn't say it's his best album
I unironically enjoy Trout Mask Replica
You like Captain Beefheart?
though I'd be surprised if you didn't know
The story behind this band is interesting
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxPsXPCR5MU
I found it, btw
I mean, I like Hot Rats
what was it called
Apparently he liked that one norwegian band that was locked in a basement
Frank Zappa is an... eccentric person
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-hKBmTAADo
I also like the work he did outside of Toto
Jeff Porcaro IS an amazing drummer, though
goddammit!
I read Toto instead of Tool
I Can't Stop Partying is the worst song ever created by a human
