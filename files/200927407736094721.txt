Wish I could do drawings half this good
Nice!
Protect the broken Sakimori
And Basa seems like she still have ptsd about it
If this goes on I'd better see if Urobuchib features anywhere. Just in case.
Ogawa can beat 10 guys while speaking on the phone. He's fine
I had to watch it twice. Not bad.
Yes
Again
Bring him back, I want to see Maria&Co exasperated
The clone theory is good to me
Split gears in chapters!
Mummy confirmed to be the God Emperor
Please no
I want Carol back
I just hope it doesn't end with this
This season is going to be good
I just started to like her, I'd rather not see this playing
I agree
Yeah
I also hope it doesn't turn in stalemate like WH40K
I like the series
I hope it doesn't end
LOL true
She's older than anyone if I remember correctly
"I don't flirt, I just have panic attacks"
Elf9 being shy as she is and Carol, inside her, exasperated screaming "Get a move on, dammit!"
Yes please
Argh
I should continue mine too
More suffering on the horizon, I suppose
It's called DESTINY
The only way to bribe the mods is raiding ice cream stores and blaming the Autoscorers
Yeah, it got me too
Really?!
"Turn back, you have more lesbians to conquer"
LOL
I imagined a near-death experience like Sora no Otoshimoto for Bikki
I hope she only look badass in this one
Also she's pretty much dying in every season she appeared
Not Kiri-chan, please
I expect Bikki to go full Zerk
"What are you doing?! Fist first, befriend later!"
Who said they wanted a commander Bikki?

'Hibiki Song'
LOL
I'm going to loop it **on and on**
F
YT suggestions compels me

dess
Milaarc is cute
Chris is going to look like Drake
The only things that bothers me is that everyone except Hibiki disappears
"like, how the rest of her team disappeared when the fight started and such"
Yeah, it bothered me too
Hibiki is the Nero of DMC
Miku got angry and killed her off
The blood funtain it's probably Milaarc's
Someone asked for headpats?

<:CarolYandere:424047704826707980>
Carol with a "Big Dick is back to town" shirt
Also CarolNein would kick asses
This would expain why we don't have Carol in XDU
THAT
dess_timely
Ah
Bread?
I'm a good listener
I'm always in need of friends
Sorrymasen
<:ShirabeEmbarassed:336657288477671436>
Lol
I find this both cute and creepy
Kay
Now I'm hunting for cuddles
That too, forgot
I too wonder why I still keep living.
I have the same reasoning of you.
But fuck that. 
The story is mine, things happens and I want to see where the world is going.
Even if the end is boring, and If I have to live for 40 years alone, I don't care.
The world sucks, and I'm not punishing myself for it.
And you shouldn't too.
I want friens and cold
God bless
I realized I know about USA states pretty much how much I know about Italian regions
Well, crap
Just be careful
Just settle for a moment and search again after some time
Maybe you'll find it in time
Isn't Craiglist dangerous?
Are you planning to rent, not buy, correct?
Do you have a place to stay?
Ah, fuck
Close your eyes, and imagine 4 years worth of that people
That's ONE PART of the story
I'd probably use paper
I mean, come on, a PDF
That hurts deeper than anything they have done or said
The group started to ostracize me and I think it was because they through I could do like him
Now, I'm an ass and I don't take hints, but from him it sounded funny
Then proceeded to accuse me of being an ass and not taking hints about the girl that I liked
And told the same girl that she was his, and when she got out of the depression he told her that he didn't like how she changed and was better when sad
A damn PDF, guys
It's not made up, i swear
One of the entry was "you didn't agree with me that time"
One of them wrote a damn PDF listing all the things that he didn't like about the girl he liked.
The story is long, I had my faults, but some things they did ... Were random
They were shitty and too young
Not with them
While I'm friendly, they put a nail in my will to talk to people. Now I want to restart again
This happened two years ago and I'm still angry
Is it bad to demand apology after they disappeared for 6 months? Or am I mad?
Tsun is cute
I want some good friends
I had it tough for too much time
We go out but that's that
Yeah, mine too
Both?
Sorry Saki
I'm just bitter about the state of my friendships.
I've been angry for two years and I'm not stopping anytime soon
Hope you didn't take it personally
You're right
My bad
Ok, sorry
How nice
Once?
Everything is better with friends
Try Nuuk then
Ah, that happens to me too
I normally have the urge to run away when I work. Is it something alike?
Also, I'd like to know where things are going
But on the upside note, I can piss on my shitty ex friends graves. 
I'm actually out of the world anyway right now
Waking up 300 years from now feels like a good idea
I would go with cryo
Cryostasis?
What are you expecting?
Thanks guys
Thanks
Ok, i ate some words, as usual
Thanks for your concern
I'm not in a self-destructive path anyway
I'm trying
I'm not good at doing it
Minor, but still a problem
But the liver is still a problem
I fixed all that
I ate them everyday, until one day my started spinning.
After some checks they diagnosticated an high bloody pressure
Yeah
I abused sandwiches. I feel like a moron
Plot twist, i never got drunk. I hardly drink
It happens when you abuse alcohol and fried stuff
My maimed liver
You know what upset me to no end?
She's making an egg herself
I would kill for a painkiller right now (lol)
Why the estrogen?
I hope the latter
Was a file format or a scientist?
The doc
Time to use some light medicine and go on the land of dreams
I fell better already
I ate my pizza
I just have trust issues
You're right
?
Thanks
Ok
You sure?
It's like having a noose around my neck that I can't get off. It makes me angry and bitter
Hope saki in not angry
It is
Same guy, wanted to reconcile with the group, bought tickets for everyone. They forgot him at the entrance, buying new tickets
Best of luck
Yeah, figures it need to be that way
Aaah
If I remember correctly
Basically the discs in your spine gets squashed
Yeah, work is draining
It also depends on how much problems I had
But it starts in Monday and it never ends
Yeah, me too
Carol too
Should find one near me then
(the last is something I don't want to do)
Confront him, let it pass or dump him?
What should I do?
What to do?
I'm wondering if a hit in the head isn't too much for him
So the friend I have left usually doesn't call me to go out at night or when he has better things to do
Even if I don't know how to make it show
I have the same mindset
What?
He once dropped in tears when I said I could go to another school
I think he cares
Yeah, I'm familiar with it
Yeah, seems good  <@142192289760935936>
I have time between a swear and another
The problem here is the friend
I'm at work, duh
The story is pretty long but fun
Stuff happened and I left the other group
I'd like to expand a bit
It's the only one I kept up with
Possibly
And new friends
To go out
(even if I bet his GF provides enough)
His head seems good enough
I want to hit things
Good luck
Crap
Which I could comprend
Who knows
Yeah
That and people focused on work probably helped
Yeah
I find that part strange
The gasoline, tho, it's noticeable
I'd add that entering a place not actively guarded is pretty easy, and an animation studio probably doesn't need any guard, if they have, they'll be bored as hell
Agreed
It's a dumb motive to kill people
I hope it's not the latter
True
I'd prefer an 'I don't care' compared to an 'oh no, I won't get my anime'
It's missing the point
Pretty much
For, who knows?
It's like, I'm working in my office, and someone decide to burn the place to the ground, and lots of good people die like that
I'm not a fan of the studio itself, but the whole affair pisses me off
That's even worse
So it's being burned
Hanging is a pretty horryfying death
30 people are enough for death to me
Well, fine by me
Wat
There is death penalty in Japan?
lol

<@87512939107450880> Oh, a fellow Italian!

I think I missed those

I don't like to use Welfare servants. I like to use Caster!Liz but nothing else for now.

I'm running an Art team
How's Rashomon going for you guys?
I'd like to do a session, but I don't have a group.
And work takes too much of my time...
Balanced, at least
I find it pretty good
In the fate system you do roll 6d6 with plus and minus, you add +1/-1 to your score and see if succeed or not. If not you can spend a fate point to re roll
Let's play a gangster plot. I'm Italian I have racial advantages for that
YEAAAH
there's the exactly same article on the Italian wiki
WAIT
My Italian wikipedia has barred revisions, I think the English one just deleted them
Some minor vandalism is still present, but some revisions seems missing
Too bad
Can't find that revision anywhere
Lol
Fricking ticket.

Is someone interested in playing Misuterii High on weekends?
With Makoto and the doctor
She's one of my candites, actually
After trying P4 it felt less good
Yeah
What?
It doubles as poison tho
Fuuka cook too
He's good
I'd like a bro SL with Shinji
P3 was good but the social links felt hollow. The plot is good tho
Ryuji is best girl
Good taste for now
Haven't played the female arc tho
Me!
Trying to
I hated so much the protagonists that I haven't lost the chance to fuck them up
In P4G there is a special ending where you side with the murdered

He is paid DLC
"Oh my God, Adachi is in P4AU, fuck yeah"

Persona is a cool series, but the bloody dancing games...
Ah OK

I really can't remember
Remind me who's the 4th palace
it's adorbs
She's all pumped up
YES
Cccute
I'm levelling TamaLancer first but I smell NTR
Even if I like Mary more
I found NP3 Anne Bonny and I'm liking it
And 'd like to know how her cat ears like  hair are done
Maria is cuter
Taunting her feels so good
LOL
(bet everyone says that)
It just isn't my thing
I do have one of Tamamo no Mae. It was a gift
Holy...
sigh
Like CCC
Maybe you should check iwakura productions or what-is-its-name
Oh, sorry
Don't wanna...
Ugh, should be working right now
Also I like how the awakenings are played in P5. In other Persona was downplayed a lot
What's your favorite awekening in P5? Mine are Makoto and Blondie
I have part 2 patched in english
Wasn't translated by some people online?
So slow
Yeah
I tried both but they're so... I don't know
Ah
Why is Jii saying stuff?
Mmm
I like tomboys and girl looks like they that have all together (but actually don't)
I'd like to play FES but God, it's hard to find
Also that Kirichan emote
It's too hot for Shirabe
Decided to try this one and I'm dominating
Never liked LOL

Always forget which is whichs
I sleep
I know
I don't play, I paint for hobby
Cool!
Vanilla Warhammer is not depressed enough for me
I, of course, play 40k
I really should paint my units...
Lol

Also spacedropping people
Everyone remembers that
But sooo fun
Yes!
I want a 3rd game
God, how cool was Prototype
I like you already
Heard pretty much the same thing, I'd like to try anyway
Also the feels are strong
He's cool
Bloody bones

Is this a motherfucking Brutal Legend reference?!
I was hardcore at the time
Ah, no, 1200 hours
I played Unite for 800 hours or so
Which is making me worried
Gen was pretty boring
Also, how much did you play?
Because they were high, probably
Let's play together sometime
I know, you're right
I call it the western name
(God, it's a long name)
Is someone getting Monster Hunter Generation Ultimate?
I'll go with some greatsword
Patpat
Ps4
I want something different
Tried before
Pick a build
I just bought Dark Soul Remastered
Nobody has resistance to that
Bloodtinge is better
The screamer always got me
I started a quality build, but changed my mind
I like my chances
Chikage hits like a truck
Just not enough
And health
I leveled bloodtinge
Nope
Just like that?
Of course not
He's a fucking pain
I can't beat the last dlc boss
Dessonance sound better
SDR?
Yeah, p4 is still everywhere
Roughly at the same time too
Yes...
One has still Mass Effect 3 inside
Ok, point, i have 2 PS3. Both died for yellow led
If it still worked I'd play Armored Core, duh
I just like DS1 and my PS3 died
