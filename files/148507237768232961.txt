HSH 4 is up, Fluffeh Aria
We just finished HSH 4 and have submitted (sorry for the delay!). Hopefully they'll be up within 12 hours. We're working on last month's shows as well as The Evil Within 31 (since that is FAR from finished and there's only one more video in the series to go). Will keep you updated
Oh, and EP2
We're still missing HSH #4 and #5, but the rest are done
Yeah
For her latest video, we finished the subtitles last week but they are so disorganized they only JUST published them
Damn Kizuna AI's team... They delayed our captions by 1.5 hours >.>
Yeah... We're still growing, I guess
In accordance with the rules, I'll post the video I worked on all day here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2pcSuAnZK8
