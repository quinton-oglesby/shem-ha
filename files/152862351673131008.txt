I was in the live today and it was great!
Hi! I'm symphogear fan from Finland!
It was very funny when cagliostro's voice actor yelled something in his male-voice XD it was the best thing
I guess the next live will be in 2020
Rainbow flower
Miku and hibiki sung G songs
Beach Maria song, Maid Shirabe song, event miku song and Sakura Blizzard Chris :)
They sung XD songs
XD I can't say I don't speak Japanese and didn't understand their puns
I don't wear jacket here in Japan but everyone else do
In Finland it is -20 celsius XD
Hmm, weather in tokyo is warm
From lice? I don't Japanese XD Only new thing I know (it was revealed yesterday) that symphogear gets 5th season (it was confirmed a year ago because GX sold stuff well) but new thing was that it starts in April
