I'd say my favorite song so far is Kirika and Shirabe's duet from G, it blew my mind when I realized it was actually a remix of both of their songs.
I heard about the show a few months ago, tried my first episode about a month ago, I tried to pace myself, this train has no brakes. I just finished GX.

I ate too much and lost my antiacids in the middle of the night
I had a rough night the other day
Just to keep it complete serious, you k <@!203444794737950720>?
:P
Took the midnight train~
AGH
...Its bad now that I'm dangerously craving pizza after all this pizza talk
Was bad @_@
Couldn't find anything to calm my stomach and was woken by my stomach all night
But its certainly an edge
Its not something to rely on
When he cleared up and the cold didn't progress past the simple stages we determined he was clean
Since I was with him all day in the same vehicle on that drive, I isolated myself too
Honestly after my dad picked me up and brought me home from college and was displaying cold symptoms I was terrified
<:TsubasaFish:689163064830066696>
Groceries are temporary 
Doom is eternal
The apocalypse is fun
<:TomosatoStare:688429724233629772>
He's most dangerous to have leave
Most likely to handle all the things
Nor is he a clean person in the first place
My brother isn't an option because he doesn't show concern and is constantly asking to go out
He doesn't get it
<:ShirabePout:336656831978012712>
Basically if anyone has to go out its me
And we've got a few P100 respirators from my brother being a welder and I get the tightest seal...
We have enough house to quarantine 
My father was having cold symptoms and we isolated him but he got better... so that scare passed
Yes. That's what we mean
Most healthy in terms of probably strongest immune system
Despite asthma I'm most healthy and least likely to take risks
Well I just got voted to be the one to leave the house and go shopping if our supplies dwindle
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waffle_House_Index
<:TsubasaUpset:672861878703357968>
Pissing me off just as much as our cheeto in chief right now
Because he ignores everything we say and then gets angry that we are telling him again
I'd say more of the former
He's just... a combination of stupid and legitimate special ed.
We have
If he's got it my idiot brother probably spread it to us all
Thermometer read 99.4
Which is within margin of error if not for our thermometer being a degree cold
We had to take grandma in to the clinic for some other shit and my brother was in the car for that
And spent most of the day complaining about us complaining about him practicing the WORST hygiene especially with him trying to cough in every square inch of the house
Oh and he had the NERVE to say Corona is just the flu in front of the family
He's a walking boy who cried wolf
We all doubt him because he's always overblowing everything
Now he pukes
I'm pissed in my brother's general direction 
Zero regards for others 
Spent the entire day running around the house coughing up a storm and chugging cough syrup (he basically drunk a bottle in a day)
Me? Fiiine
Mom caught it
Brother caught it
Dad had a common cold
Well as if to prove my earlier statement of being the best person in the family to go out for supplies
Idk the stress is just getting to me
Doesn't help that my own asthma has a persistent cough that has me questioning my own health every time it happens
Parents are out working retail delivery to keep us afloat 
And I'm here caring for my sick brother and my grandmother that is incapable of helping herself
Gave us a big ol pamphlet of "what to do when family member has covid"
They basically said "test is negative but he's got corona" 
Apparently the only disease they can diagnose right now
We had to take him into the clinic
Yeah it isn't
He's thrown up twice today
I pray it isn't corona
Whatever illness my brother got has progressed
So we've come to this
Wearing masks in our own home
Senate? House? Who fuckin cares
But the public only gives a shit about the president
Technically you vote for everything
I'm jaded 
Fuck the system 
The system brought about this hell
In this current system you aren't voting for who you want in, you are voting for who you don't want in.
Just watch any political commercial 
It's all about why the other guy is bad
There could be 4, 5, 100, I don't care
3rd party is to represent any party beyond the 2 major ones
Unless a single 3rd party can muster more votes than one of the two parties 
You could remove the votes from the equation and the results would not change in the slightest
System is flawed
<:ShirabeFear:696380146248319066>
It's just the inherent flaw in the system used
As their vote provides no input to the selection between the top 2
A single vote winner take all effectively wastes any votes that aren't for the first or second most popular
Or if you had to rank all the candidates in the order in which you prefer them
Vs say... if you had to give each candidate a rating 0-5 ⭐ which would allow you to support a 3rd party without giving an advantage to a party that acts counter to your interests
The thing is when in a system where you can only cast one vote for one person, you naturally enforce a 2 party system as it's the most viable strategy
The system is fucked
Because split votes become wasted votes.
Which is why the system basically enforces 2 major groups
If A and B combine into one, they can beat C
If 30% say A is good C is bad, 30% say B is good C is bad,
40% say C is good 
C wins
The election system being based on who has the most votes boils down to two groups naturally
I blame the system of election for why it boiled down to bipartisanship 
But damn do I hate both sides right now.
Please just erase us from the map if he remains in office. He's a hazard to world safety
Our president doesn't know the difference.
Yes.
If we manage to reelect this man
Please remove us from the rest of the world
https://twitter.com/joshtpm/status/1248699275355328512
<:TsubasaShock:689705053401251867>
Take 50% of that 70 and isolate em to their own districts 
And then separate out the 30% so it wins against the 20%
If voting by districts, if you set them up properly you can get a 30% to beat the 70%
It's like my favorite practice 
gerrymandering
The more fractured your opposition is, the less votes you need to win
Bam vote fractured
I'm saying something along the lines of they put forth some other guy as their candidate 
And then say Drmpf runs as a 3rd party
Putting a new candidate forth would be suicide
Unless they step down
Which is why the Republican party can't do anything other than put our current president forth for reelection
That party loses.
Say if one party put forth two candidates
If you fracture your oppositions vote they lose
Both suck
I wouldn't even attribute it to one party
<:yougetusedtoit:530197297976573957>
I used to say otherwise
In the US 3rd parties are wasted votes despite how much as people say otherwise
PLEASE KINDLY FUCK OFF
I DO NOT WANT TO RELIVE THAT 2020
I absolutely lost my shit and was unable to sleep for the rest of the night
I woke up in the middle of the night at one point during that to find a big fat one gorged in my own blood sitting on my face
I'm still not over the horror of the year we had that infestation and we threw literally everything in a giant homemade oven to cook everything to the point nothing would survive
Found a bedbug when I woke up
FOR FUCKS SAKE 2020 LEAVE ME THE FUCK ALONE
Too much for one day
I think it's time to retire back to bed
He says its not my fault but I knew the risks and didn't take enough precautions so I feel guilty regardless
Make it 5, the data recovery center just got back and they couldn't get the files back from my dad's hard drive that got corrupted when I helped him dual boot win 7 and 10
And covid kinda... well some shit happened
The place I was trying to rent has a clause where you get rejected if you have unpaid rent at another place
Stressing over family affairs being fucked, I promised to rent a place with a friend and I need to back out and I'm afraid of the consequences...
<:Germain:421434126856486912>
On my 4th mental breakdown of the day, I think it's a new high score
All of this while I'm getting ready to go into work to help my parents close the family business
<:ShirabeJoy:672105345316814878><a:KirikaSob:725756440463147048>
What do you mean 6 more months of 2020
<:KirikaCry:674720015047720961>
I HAVE HAD IT
... OKAY 2020 JUST STOP
I just overheard my brother calling his HR about the confirmed covid case at his workplace
And she brought it to us
We had my grandmother stay over at one point and it wasn't until later we learned her nursing home had an infestation
See we didn't have these
Bedbugs are fucking satanspawn
Honestly a sane decision all things considered
And we even had these other traps we made that produced CO2 to attract the bugs
We set up these traps at the legs of the beds to catch things
Diatomaceous earth was sprayed everywhere
We also set up MANY traps
We eradicated them, as far as we can tell
This was years ago
And all the furniture
And we cooked all the beds
We made beeg oven big enough to take an entire bed frame
If it can handle being cooked in the oven, cook it to a good ol 80-100°C
You jest but that's basically what we had to do last time
AAAAAAAAAAAA
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
I just see the parallels
Ever since my brother started work as a welder he's... changed
The thought of my brother and I drifting apart like my parents did from their siblings just... mortifies me
I mean the most painful part in all of this is I can see a reflection of the relation between my aunts and uncles
Godblessamerica
So the dinner discussion circled to Covid as it do these days
And I started on how stupid it is that people refuse to mask up these days
And my brother got pissed at me saying to not get political at the table
My utterly favorite part of all this
The pandemic is apparently fucking political
But here we are in 2020
I sicken myself with me being *excited* about what should be terrible news
<:blobpopcorn:446368342723264532>

Reminder: The words we stand back and stand by not stand down and stand by
I just... can't stand being in a position where I don't have a shred of respect for our elected leader
...At least Reagan has a positive name in relation to the current POTUS
<:Dabtenshi:520209045978873857>
At least it wouldn't be an international disgrace

https://twitter.com/JohnCarmack/status/1312212004824776705
Feeling a connection to someone in the stuff you only hear on the news or other indirect sources consisting of people you've never met in person
Nepotism? Nah it just was... just feeling a connection on some level
Made it feel grounded and real if you know what I mean
...I miss having Reid in office 
If only because I was close friends with his grandkids 
Felt like I at least had a connection to the government
Just... really?
But its just so...
I'm not surprised 
I expect nothing less than this bullshit
<:ShirabeStare:582381430915596289>
All I see is hypocrisy of the highest order
When 4 years ago they stalled out Obama trying to fill a seat for almost a full year because "the people deserve a choice in the next justice"
Bahahahaha
"We want to delay the voting for the supreme justice because a bunch of Republicans tested positive for Corona" after they DASHED to fill that hole
The news today has been filled with stuff about the president's hospitalization 
I mean it could be faked 
But I don't think one fakes being on oxygen
The orange man is apparently hospitalized and it sounds bad
More than positive
For my humorous take,
Its the same sort of feeling like presenting a mountain of evidence that the other guy is the imposter and they just say "red sus"
"Red was not the imposter; One imposter remains"
"You lied" "No I didn't" "You just lied again" "Nope I did not" "We have recorded proof you lied" "I never said that you are fake news"
Idk how describe it 
But it just... enrages me that someone can be hit with hard facts and can just refute them via sheer force of will
At least a wolf in sheep's clothing needs to pretend to be a sheep a little
Well the current wolf is too fucking bold
Its a matter of principle I guess
If you are going to be a criminal at least be a smooth one
But a shred of basic human decency and perhaps a facade of care is just...
https://youtu.be/l8ukak8P2vY?t=7s
Its just a sucky position
Aka pay a few thousand dollars in tuition just to vote
Which means going back to out-of-state tuition
If I try to vote in the state I'm in right now... well that requires changing my state of residency
I'm in a position I can't even request an absentee ballot
I'm just annoyed over my inability to vote
I can't register in my state without admitting I'm not living in the state at the moment since I no longer have a physical address in-state to claim
College supersenior
23
I also feel incredible guilt cuz a week or so ago my brother got fired from his job and was really depressed 
And I know he likes being 'treated like an adult' or whatever 
So while he was moping I pulled out my personal bottle of whiskey and poured us both a shot and was all 'heres to you' sorta deal
But for me its more a social thing and I only went that far to learn what too far is like
I mean I know all about alcohol shit myself, I'm in a college frat and have drunk myself to the point of puking... twice?
So we uh... at least know where dad is
Brother left for a job interview and he found the RV in the wal-mart parking lot
I need virtual hug
Parents got in a fight last night 
Dad left
My brother threatened suicide 
He supposedly had 4 shots of whiskey and 4 beers 
But my brother constantly lies so I can't even hold that as truth
Also he's 20
I spent part of the night forcing my brother to drink water 
And then as I'm getting a glass of ice water I turn back around to find him face first against the floor and his body up the stairs, I didn't hear a fall but he claims he fell down the stairs 
The whole while he's laughing like a maniac 
I dumped the ice water on his face.
My question is why do we use electoral college 
Why not skip the middleman and go off the popular vote 
We have the technology
In an ideal world no, but if Trump takes anything before the supreme court I feel they are gonna side with him
And guess who just packed the supreme court
This man basically fighting for his life lmao
Welcome to Nevada

I find all this talk of refusing to count ballots disgusting
I don't fucking care who the vote is for, count it. Refusing to count a ballot is silencing someone's voice.
Because I don't think we'll ever hear the end of 270 exactly
Personally I want Biden to get a good margin over 270
Can't wait to hear him scream about this when I wake up in the morning
Jeez
Less than 1k gap
<a:BlobSweatAnimated:580749902817001472>
Its hilarious tbh
Ok Nevada is postponing results for weeks
May you fear georgia and pennsylvania don't un-flip with the recounts
Ok handing votes to lord trumperton
https://tenor.com/view/gawr-gura-gif-18439707
Gotta go full 'murca sorry
Because all Nevadans say Ne-vad-uh
Ne-vah-duh exposes you for using the spanish pronunciation which while correct for the spanish name of the state is also wrong
Ne-VAD-uh
Congrats you just delayed the results by two full days
Hello Nevadan here
We are holding the results until the entire world learns to pronounce Nevada properly
I want it on video
Trump says he'll have to be dragged out of the WH kicking and screaming
And Trump will never concede because ego
And the dust hasn't settled
Its only over once the dust has settled or one party concedes

This morning has been a nonstop barrage of fake news
Its hilarious
He's so... childish
See he said so
https://mobile.twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1325099845045071873
Sorry libs Trump has won
I mean a war and then claiming executive order or w/e
I'm afraid of what shit orange man is gonna pull to try and sink the ship (further) before he passes the helm so he can then be all "look at how bad Biden is the ship is sinking"
What damage will the baby-in-chief do before he's dragged out of the house next year
Now time to wonder
A leader should unite not divide
Its terrible 
This Biden speech seems more presidential than all of Trump's combined

What I get for leaving my bed
Time to recovery mode shit while my own body is in recovery mode
Seems the high winds that caused brownouts fucked my computer
Fuck me
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
I've got big midterm tomorrow and all I can do is lie here in bed in pain
I'm just falling apart physically and mentally
I've officially hit my breaking point 
Family stress, school stress, a mental breakdown leading to me falling behind and my rush to catch up just trashed me
There's my flashback session
<:ShirabeFear:696380146248319066>
She sent me a text 2-3 years ago and we conversed a little but I accidentally struck a sore spot and she lashed out
I worry for her, but at the same time, stay far away from ex of a breakup that... explosive
...Also sad cuz her adoptive father died, and she hated her adoptive mother so much she completely severed ties with her
I didn't get the full picture at the time but turns out the adoptive mother ditched many years back and around the time we started dating she was trying to force her way back into her daughter's life, I was so confused why someone could be so disrespectful to their mother, but I kinda let it pass
Honestly... in retrospect I got myself sucked into a massive mess
~~*dabs on self burn*~~
~~Also you can tell the breakup was bad because she's gay now~~
It was a lot of work... I still feel a hint of guilt because I feel she probably returned to it after our catastrophic breakup 5 years ago
Just popped back in here, jeez. 
I'm flashing back to my ex who cut herself on the regular and I didn't find out till a few months in. (She cut her thigh rather than wrist so it wasn't very visible) Tried so hard to get her off it... even tried it myself once to feel what she was doing to herself.
He just doesn't seem to understand how to not work
But damn I just want him to stop and relax for once
I guess you gotta keep moving
I mean after a decade of basically nonstop work
In particular my dad just doesn't stop... doing
My parents also sold their store and retired, and I feel like they just can't escape the business mindset
Past 3 years I'd spent away from home living in an apartment, but had to return to family due to pandemic
And it's just asking for more
I feel like I've already had to give up most of what I'd usually do to keep myself sane
I just hate this situation as a whole
(Tbf, am 23 but still)
And my parents just won't let up and keep bringing up kicking me out for being useless freeloader
Out of my 4 classes, I barely passed 2 and failed one (well technically an incomplete I need to make up but basically fail)
Parents have been hounding me harder and harder on me spending time 'gaming' which to them is literally anything involving my computer
I'm just frustrated with my situation because I dropped most of my anime watching (used to line up at least one show for every day of the week) and dropped all my personal projects over the last semester and no longer had to spend time cooking for myself ot commuting 
And my parents say my grades were due to not dedicating enough time to school and that I should be getting better grades in an online class than in person because I've got lecture recordings and stuff
Orange man bad
Orange man bad
At least Australia isn't on fire

"Oh no we got caught, time to act innocent"
Honestly this is a massive shitshow and I'm mad at all the people suddenly condemning it when before they were fully supporting it
Perhaps blue lives matter is not in fact pro-police but is really anti-black <:Thonk:520209399801839648>
More police died in this one MAGA event than the entire BLM protests
Really makes you question why they were flying blue lives matter flags dunnit?

He was in a calm state of mind and was now mad at me for not responding
Nope. This was *After* things had bean dealt with
While I was simultaneously taking my own shower
In another shower in the house
I have no idea why I didn't hear a big glass pane shatter and my brother screaming 
But I was taking a shower and I was behind multiple walls
All I heard was running water
Fuck off dad
I don't know how but I didn't hear brother screaming from behind two walls with a shower running
Brother shattered the shower door we had just installed a few days ago somehow, blood is everywhere 
Dad busts in during my shower and says "Your brother is dead" and walks out
Brother is fine albeit feet shredded by glass
Dad says the neighbors came over because brother was screaming so loud 
Brother was like "They did?"
Dad: "No, they didn't"
Spent all day on one and its not even working yet
40% of this assignment is basically 5 weeks worth of work
And each is worth 8 points
We have to implement 5 completely different algorithms
I need to vent because I'm just losing my grip at this point
WHAT THE FUCK PROFESSOR 
So homework 2 for this FUCKING MACHINE LEARNING CLASS
100 point assignment
And 8 points on it are dedicated to "Implement an entire algorithm", which for most other classes would be an entire week's homework
But no
This class isn't like that
And 2 days left
To discover I've got just about 5 weeks worth of coding hiding beneath 5 8 point questions
Which was followed by last week where I chipped away at this assignment bit by bit, finishing the short answer section by Sunday night
After which I was on shutdown for half a week, and then spent the next half week catching up post a week of cram + half a week shutdown
Also 
2 weeks ago was homework 1
That one also resulted in a physical and mental breakdown after working for a week straight devoting just about all of my time not consumed by attending classes or meals/sleep
Not "Do this, figure out how"
And in those classes they would even give step-by-step instructions on how to follow the algorithm
And each one any of my other classes would have made a week's assignment out of it on its own
And then there are 5 more things, each worth 8 points, each being "Program this entire algorithm"
And thats worth 60/100 on the assignment
Like the short answer questions on the assignment, I would see a normal class having as a week's worth of assignment
Because fuck you 
-My ML prof
The thing is, its basically 5-6 weeks of work in 1 week
I've been working on it for long time
Panicking because due tonight
I'm already losing my mind over aforementioned assignment
Ok but who the fuck drops "Your brother is dead" with no explanation and walks out
Thanks for following protocol to improve officer safety. As a reward we will attempt to kill you now
And the same police station put out a tweet or something showing a cop car that got rear ended, and was asking people to pull over at a safe place so accidents won't happen
Cop has none of that shit, pulls a (poorly executed) PIT maneuver, causing a rollover on the vehicle 
Fun fact: woman was also pregnant
Or there's that other story I was reading a while ago, officer flags lady down for speeding, freeway is unsafe to pull over on so lady turns on hazard lights and pulls to rightmost lane, following the exact protocol one does if there isn't safe place to pull over
Cop rams and flips car. Daughter is ejected from vehicle, man tries to get to his daughter, man is beaten to ground at gunpoint.
Man freaks out, drives off in panic thinking the cop was out to kill them
Story basically went, cop pulls over black family for speeding, cop aggressively asks if they have drugs or guns, cop goes back to his car, cop unloads a can of mace into a car of a man, his wife, and his two daughters
I'd just read *another* story of a cop causing a car to roll over killing occupants for... honestly all I can label it is bloodthirst
I want to meet a cop. 
The level of shit I hear every day about law enforcement makes me not trust them in the slightest, even if I'm a caucasian male. 
I wish I could reclaim some of that innocence that trusted them.
<:yougetusedtoit:530197297976573957>
Which spells extra bad if anyone decides to launch the first nuke.

<a:MisakaBlush:560276332060344322>
I enjoyed it, but the last quarter-third ish just... ugh
Yes but it was really grating to spend an excessive amount of time in that state
And by the end I was all "thank god they turned the color back on"
The desaturation of everything for the last 4 or something episodes really started to annoy me
But it left a bad taste in my mouth
It was nowhere near as painful as Index III
Tbh I was rather disappointed by the Accelerator anime 
I was expecting a rather grounded science side and got that... and then it went heavy magic towards the end 
Maybe I just hate the nonstop monologues magic brings
Now he needs the power of 10,000 Misakas to not be useless
Pls nerf
Oof
I mean I'm pretty sure magicians and espers are the same in the end
Because most magic v magic fights in index boil down to each combatant pulling out a bigger spell until one of them goes "oh no you can't do that"
And what is their limit?
What capabilities do each magic user have
The magic side? Who fucking knows what they'll pull out of their ass. They use a very soft magic system
The espers are bound by rules and logic and you can get a good sense of what each person can or cannot do
*moving here because I like ranting on this topic*
The crux of my argument of railgun vs index is soft vs hard magic
What I have learned from Touma:
If you punch the bad guy in their face they'll give up and be your friend 
Or wait is that Hibiki?
Index: the series that keeps producing spinoffs better than itself
Misaka 20002
~~not canon~~

Misaka clearly best girl in the raildex universe 
Why else would they make 20,000 of her 
And a loli version 
And an adult 
And apparently a neko
I thought they were mostly freed post sisters arc
And under the care of the frog faced bastard 
And a bunch seem to just be out and about doing things
So has anyone questioned why they run into a Misaka around every corner?
Like they aren't locked up in some vault
Also can I just say
How does nobody notice 10,000 Misakas roaming around 
I don't think the existence of all those clones is public knowledge but they seem to have some capacity to just... roam
Hail biribiri
How many times has Touma been hospitalized btw?
Touma punch in face
Fight over
It was physically painful to watch
S3 was shit
"This isn't the right anime"
If I were to review this show so far...
I am really just in a state of confusion
They spend 5 episodes blazing through content so incredibly fast skipping over everything 
And then decide to throw in filler? 
Pacing is so incredibly off I can't tell if they feel like they don't have enough time, or they have too much time
Or maybe they needed filler because they couldn't keep up at that blazing pace
Maybe just trying to cut costs?
Its just bewildering.
YUMI WHAT ARE YOU DOING
So in watching today's Assassin's Pride episode ~~why am I even~~
I noticed a background character that seemed familiar
***BAKURETSU BAKURETSU LA LA LA***
Was a blast
Pun intended
I caught it in theaters
E X P L O S I O N
Just a whole town of people as crazy over the top as our explosionloli
And you get a whole ton of chuunibyou crimson demons
Aqua and Darkness sit on the sidelines mostly because this is a Kazu-Megu-Yunyun story
Sounds about right
But taking a step back...
I don't think it's as transphobic as I had initially feared
In the moment I did recoil cause I saw backlash
F
Hmm...
Rewatch SNAFU and then watch season 2 in preparation for 3
Watch Monogatari because my friend has been asking me to (and I should probably listen because I've been asking him to watch Symphogear)
Or take the random solution and watch that lovecraftian anime that I heard about
EKUSPLOSION!!!
GOD DAMN IT BARB
<:Thonk:520209399801839648>
I still hear Shirabe
https://youtu.be/eVudpKEJcYo
I'm ready for more meguca
Ohno
I'm ready for A Certain Scientific Shirabe ~~still can't unhear send help~~
<:yougetusedtoit:530197297976573957>
Also RIP Goblin Slayer
Sounds like he hit episode 5
...
Whatever that means in Mirai Nikki terms
That's how the reaction went down



We've been saying he likes yanderes to keep it simple
Honestly I'm not quite sure on his taste
Or I guess Toga kills everything including you 
...
Rather than "I love you so much I'll kill to be with you"
He seems to like the "I love you so much I'll kill you" types
Maybe yandere isn't the perfect word to describe it, his favorite is Himiko Toga
And his reactions to what he's seeing are... priceless
I haven't seen it myself, but I know Yuno is the infamous yandere
So my friend likes yanderes. 
Other friend got him to watch Mirai Nikki.
His poor soul wasn't ready.
Ohno
I reached *the* toothbrush scene
https://youtu.be/0Mz0trc-ZpY
Why am I 
Friend kept talking about Eromanga Sensei 
Its adorable 
I also have put myself on a few watchlists
Dr Stone best Isekai <:Kappa:537913171374112779>
I mean one of my friends got me to watch Monogatari, the other Eromanga Sensei 
I think this is fair for me dragging them into Symphogear
I can specifically pinpoint my favorite moment of the OP
I loved the karen bee OP, all the colorful explosions and BEEEEEES
Just a ton of energy
"Wow that was fast"
But you go staple stable, staple stable, kaerimichi
It returns
Very different than the rate of OP changes I'm used to
The first OP for bakemonogatari lasts like 2 episodes
Sounds about right
...There is also a new OP for each arc so there are a lot of them lol
I know Renai Circulation is one of the famous ones, but which one is the other?
Karen would be my favorite of the bunch
But toothbrush has marred everything
And then there is Kanbaru who is even more of a pervert who would be totally pleased with Ararararagi sexually assaulting her, but he only likes them if they don't consent I guess
My overall experience so far has been me screaming "Arararagi no!" as he continues to sexually assault an elementary school girl, both of his little sisters, and to a lesser extent his vampire loli.
So I finished nisemonogatari after shelving it for a hot second with the infamous toothbrush scene
Looks like Uiharu learned from Misaka
Wait, thats illegal
Spoopy guy with the cello music that wants your money
*ominous cello intensifies*
Hey nise has Kaiki 
Kaiki: "I am once again asking for your financial support"
And good dental hygiene
All about the birds and the bees
Nise is the season of the fire sisters
10/10 would join her club
I didn't like Kongo at first, seemed like... well a stuck-up bitch
But despite talking big she's really a good person who really cares about people
Railgun T proving the Kongo Club is the best
All I've got is <a:MisakaBlush:560276332060344322>
I need to hunt down some biribiri emotes tbh
"That happened, didn't it?"
I had to look it up and then I was all "Oh right"
I forgot about silent party lol
||Looking at Misaka's eyes hard enough, they are drawn in the solid cel-shaded style that the sisters have had this season rather than the smoother style the original's eyes are drawn in||
Single most perplexing frame for me out of the Railgun OP 
Mysterious purple hair of I have no idea who you are
What looks like a slightly younger Misaka 
Misaki ghosting over the two, also looking a bit younger then modern day as well
<a:MisakaBlush:560276332060344322>
Honestly Misaki is what I expected of Kongou
...Again I love how Kongo went from a character I expected myself to hate to being one of my favorites
I determined that it was actually a strong alarm, but I woke up every morning just about having a heart attack
I forgot I did that to myself in sleep-drunk state and was JOLTED awake by that sound
I decided to set the "Call of the Witch" (The creepy song that plays when Subaru ||respawns|| and other such events) as my wakeup alarm
Was incredibly out of it and made really un-smart decisions
But the kicker of the story is one night it was like... 3AM and I was what I can only refer to as sleep-drunk
11/10
So first off, that emotional whiplash was intense
So about 3 years ago I guess I had a friend convince me to watch both Re:Zero and Konosuba
And I watched them simultaneously 
I interleaved the episodes, watch one suba, watch one zero (for the most part, occasionally broke the pattern)
Also forgot that Betelgeuse basically has the same verbal tic as Kiri
Just turned absolutely creepy rather than cute
Isekai Quartet revealed I had forgotten Betelgeuse, and now my brain trembles
... I think I need to start watching the directors cut of Re:Zero soon
Reincanated as a small, helpless orphan girl in a warzone
Basically Being X put Tanya in absolute hell to make them believe in god
See, Tanya *will* punch god 
With *force* and *anger*
Now reincarnated as a lil girl in magical WWI Germany
Used to be a cutthroat japanese salaryman
Tanya got isekai'd by god
Err, they refuse to belive that god is a god so they refer to them as Being X
That and I wasn't really invested in the whole conflict
I was mildly disappointed with accelerator because I was expecting... more?
It got stuck in that arc and I was expecting two I guess
More about espers which is why I love it
Basically, I like the series more the less of the magic side is involved because the magic side tends to just be poorly written
I had to repeatedly tell myself "You've watched 2 seasons of this plus 2 seasons of spinoff, tough it out"
I wanted to drop it so many times
:(
Still upset with Index III
Its less impresive when you point out its due to Railgun I being in December 2009 and III starting in January 2020
~~A season per decade~~
Fun fact: A Certain Scientific Railgun has aired in 3 separate decades
Isn't it getting another?
Basically I've run into random tidbits here and there and I've occasionally browsed wiki pages but generally with my brain 'turned off' so I don't really retain knowledge on what I read
My general understanding of what is going on in Re:Zero from outside of anime spoilers is ||the witch has some sort of plan for Subaru which is both why he is in the world and why he doesn't remain dead||
Gonna take a lot of mental permutations on this idea to get something good
... honestly could be interesting 
Would take a lot of work to separate the gimmick from the source and to make it work well
Or just do it like that until the last remaining member of the party is RIP
*Scribbles in notebook*
...
Holy shit I want to use that as a D&D campaign gimmick if I ever DM a campaign 
Pick one of the party members at random and make them the chosen one
Kill party members off, have them swap to new characters, kill the chosen one 
"Okay everyone pull out your old character sheets"
When the world just doesn't let you die 
Congrats you get to respawn at the checkpoint and try again
But the singing bit is just soooooo
Honestly after the opening bit with the singing, its a pretty good song as a whole
Or put you to sleep forever with a heart attack
Will either wake you up immediately
Call of the Witch is 11/10 alarm
But now whenever I hear that song it creeps me out even further because its now associated with the greatest terror of all: Waking up for school
There spoiler bars over the premise of the series lol
A full rewatch with a few extras
I'm getting ready to watch the director's cut here at some point
Konosuba ends on everyone laughing 
Re:Zero ends with
And everything goes wrong
Both suba and zero have protagonist who is really weak in terms of the world they are thrown into
The difference between comedy and tragedy is how everyone feels after all the bad things happen
Well is suffering
But one takes the comedy spin while the other...
Both subverting the isekai tropes in a similar manner
Its funny how similar but different Konosuba and Re:Zero are
His sacrifice was in vain
But it wasn't truck-kun
Well, yes
He was trying to save them from truck-kun
Its like 2 minutes at the beginning of the first episode and ceases to matter aside from Tanya hating Being X
Lets just say the pre-isekai stuff doesn't really matter at all
Naofumi: I opened a book
Subaru: I shopped at 7-11
Kazuma: I died of fright attempting to save someone from truck-kun 
Tanya: I ruined some guy's life and then he shoved me in front of a train
No god here.
Err sorry Being X
Yeah the premise is isekai, really only exists to set up the rivalry of Tanya and god.
Of the isekai'd people in quartet, she's the youngest physically but the oldest mentally
Yes.
If you want to watch a cutie be very not cutie
I mean one of Tanya's early acts of bloodlust and insanity was ||wow I have an idea on how to get off the front lines, lets overload my magical gril crystal so make it EXPLODE, killing the enemy and leaving me injured to get out of this conflict with a purple heart||
Don't headpat this loli or she'll kill you
She's the loli the FBI needs to protect you from
They fear the devil
They like her as a military asset
Tanya flying along 
>Balwisyall nescell Gungnir tron
She's a little...
So Tanya keeps getting sent to the front lines
But Tanya has a bad habit of being too good, either that or its the meddling of Being X
Like not high enough to get a target on their head by being a supreme ruler or something
Their goal is to rise through the military ranks so they can live a posh life in the backlines away from the fighting
Tanya gives god the finger by turning their hellscape into their own weapon
Only Tanya is isekai'd
Should I be concerned that there is no 0 and instead it has 10, 11, and 12?
*Looks at Misaki's remote*
In conclusion:

oooof
Top 10 photos taken a frame before disaster
Hahaha Kuroko confirmed Misakasexual but not gay
But nope to being the center lol
Well half of that is happening
Nope.
Twas expecting another blank selfsert protag to be the front and center with all the girls fawning over them
But was surprised to see that Kotoko remained front and center
That probably makes sense 
I was expecting Kuro to take over like some harem protag
... sounds about right
Was about to say short one legged badass but I know at least one fullmetal one legged badass
Maybe I've just never seen a one-legged badass fearlessly tackle a monster
I usually can put a finger on the attributes I'm enjoying 
Perhaps she's just radically different from the characters I'm used to?
Idk what it is, but I really love Kotoko's character
Looks like I'm just about caught up with in/spectre now lol
Step 2: Wait why ||is her fake eye bloodshot too?||
Step 1: Laugh ass off at the whole sequence leading up to this point
https://tenor.com/view/screams-externally-gif-5389958
*Screams in Index III*
smh
Kazuma its your job to steal
*Checks back up on Biribiri*
Well shit
Episode 8 didn't air yesterday 
It's delayed till the 20th
Haha nice
Alderamin on the Sky all done
Did the binge thing
I'm open to any war/tactics recommendations because apparently I'm back on that train again
Gotta love when your memory is half right
Was great I was all "wait I thought Subaru died here" 
And then he didn't 
And then he did
And then he didn't
Emilia: 1
Felt & Rom: 2 
Subaru: 3~~.5~~
I was having fun keeping death count tabs
Going in on my rewatch of Re:Zero (watching the director's cut)
It feels great finally having biribiri back
Sparkle eye acknowledged in-universe
https://downloadmorerem.com/
Oh no it happened again
I ayyy'd when the world's favorite ~~catgirl~~ catboy hit the screen
It was fun watching them show off every character that is going to be involved in the next arc in that scene
Just had to throw that in with everything else
Happy scene happy scene... wait WRONG SMILE WRONG SMILE MY BRAIN TREMBLES
It's all a matter of perspective I guess
I'm impressed at how quickly I went from hating her guts to liking her
I've had a good laugh out of Misaki failing at simple physical tasks because she is used to getting out of doing anything with her powers
Let's make that a spinoff now because Index doesn't have enough spinoffs
Lmfao on the railgun post credits preview
"Next week on A Certain Scientific Mental Out" -Misaki
<:yougetusedtoit:530197297976573957>
SNAFU 3 delay
https://twitter.com/anime_oregairu/status/1247464334776647681
Saten with a baseball bat
But we are missing the most powerful fighting force in the entire index series
So railgun is getting extreme, we got like the biggest gathering of huge players I've seen
Glad its back in my life
I forgot how much I missed Love is War
"WTF stop molesting-" *drops railgun episode 2*
Kuroko singlehandedly chased me out of the series when I was a fresh weeb
Kuroko:
Wow she's a hardcore perv
...
I'm still right
Okay who is next for me to judge by their cover and be completely wrong
<:naythee:626379408667836426>
Kongo:
Ah she's that popular rich bitch great I'm gonna hate her
...
Nevermind she's amazing 
Misaki:
Ah she's what I thought Kongo was but far worse with literal brainwashing
...
again, very impressed with how quickly they managed to reverse my overall opinions
THE POWER OF EMPATHY
Before: She's terrible and a monster
Now: She's terrible and I feel bad for her
But I can tell that it certainly left scars
Dunno the full extent
I mean ||dolly|| certainly had some impact on the relation
It just how it be
...Still disapprove of her certainly brainwashed clique
I didn't commit die
Miraculously
I survived S3
But that one seemed very... natural?
Of course
I only watch one not-airing anime at a time, but I try to load myself with currently airing shows
If you can read everyone's minds and reprogram them if you don't like it, what's more terrifying than an independent variable
It makes sense
The only wildcard to her
Also love how Misaki has a hard time trusting Misaka because shes just about the only person she can't control or manipulate
||It was great for her character. She's human. She has a heart. She has good intentions. She has flaws.||
Still, ||Misaki isn't in the clear, she still abuses her powers and manipulates everyone around her. But humanizing it by revealing she does care for people and her whole secrecy was due in part by her own insecurities, coupled with a bit of humor poking at how she lacks in the athletic department due to getting out of doing anything...||
Props to them for ||making me loathe Misaki and then managing to turn it all around so I'm actually rooting for her||
My weekly biribiri was keeping me going
How dare you make me have feelings just in time for suffering
<:yougetusedtoit:530197297976573957>
I mean the episode ended with this glorious||ly terrible|| shot
It seems to be peaking hard enough to conclude next episode or if they were particularly drawn out 2 more
At least I assume 13 was the last of the arc
RIGHT BEFORE THE ARC CONCLUDED
AND WHY RIGHT ON THE STUPID CLIFFHANGER
HOW MANY TIMES CAN YOU DO THIS TO ME
THE PAIN
But just
I understand putting on hold
Don't kill yourselves over this
Its the virus
THERE WAS LIKE ONLY ONE EPISODE LEFT TO THE ARC
...
I mean I understand why you'd need to delay
BUT STILL AAAAAAAAAAA
*Watches more Railgun T*
*Learns episode 13 is now delayed due to virus*
https://tenor.com/view/angry-anime-damn-mother-fucker-mad-gif-5929021
Just to have her do... basically nothing
It just annoyed me how hard they teased Misaka in Index III
They teased biribiri so much and gave me nothing 
It was the *worst*
Well 
Misaka Worst was the best
It just hurt
Index III made me wanna die
I can't comment on source as I hasn't read
But just in anime
My conclusion is espers make more sense in the anime than magic, where everything seems to end because deus vult... or a fuck ton of deus ex machina
Anime only wise, magic makes zero sense so the tension is just... gone
Well conservation of ninjutsu says single fighter wins
Like you pit Misaka vs Accelerator, you know Accelerator would have an edge due to his ability to redirect just about anything 
But you pit Itsuwa with all the backup vs Acqua and I'm just sitting there like "The fuck if I know how the hell this is gonna turn out"
Generally more grounded in real world physics, or at least follow some sort of logical continuity
Vs the science side espers that do one thing and that one thing only, limited by how they can exploit that one feature
It seems more like a series of asspulls until one side gives up
But the overall unpredictability tends to destroy any sense of tension for me
I'll give it the benefit of the doubt and say the source probably explains things better
Whenever the magic side gets involved in the anime... I feel like all sense of predictability goes out the window because the magic system is so... arbitrary
But man did that first bit scare me off lmao
A combination of being accustomed to the general fanservicey shenanigans of anime and being introduced to Kuroko in a less pervy way in Index... I was able to return
And then I went back to Railgun
A long while later I watched Index
I tried starting on railgun early on
They had a pause, resumed, paused for two weeks, resumed, and now paused indefinitely
But I'm not here for the destination
I'm here for the ride
Got a loose idea of the result
... I already spoiled myself on this arc a few years ago when I read the wiki assuming series ded and not getting more adaptations
And then Index III, Accelerator, and Railgun T happened
STILL RAGE
WHY DID THEY HAVE TO PAUSE RAILGUN RIGHT DAMN NOW AT THE PEAK OF THE ARC
That was cruel
The OP teased that so hard
Didn't she arrive during the Acqua shit just to... well leave
<@155150213445582850> Aoharu x Machinegun
Power of binge I have finished
f
But this is a valid reason not to shoot.
My big complaint: Its airsoft 
Shoot first monologue later 
Its not like you are killing them, they can hear you gloat after you shoot them
Takes me back to the years I used to airsoft
Still got my rifle in my closet with the drabs I wore that undoubtedly don't fit me anymore
Was disappointed because with that line I was expecting some full auto unloaded
https://youtu.be/mE0RQ7YeACg?t=11


Because anything is jojos if you try hard enough
I don't know how I got here but I'm tearing through Aoharu x Machinegun
Why am I here watching an airsoft anime
Kuroko certified badass tho
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
We back at it again?
I honestly have no idea with Railgun anymore
~~And has the best bi-harem~~
Bakarina is most dense protag I've ever seen
... so here I am watching OPs and EDs to burn some time and I end up on the Villainess ED
I'm like "That voice sounds familiar"
*Shouta Aoi*
Oh... wait he got me again
That's Cagliostro.
Railgun T:
||My brain: "You can't restrain Kuroko she's a teleporter"
The anime 2 seconds later: https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/482946932168327178/710970337432567808/unknown.png ||
I think this is the entire anime in a nutshell
I HATE YOU TOO BRAIN FUCK OFF
*curls into ball of pain*
I didn't sign up for a self imposed lecture
Fuckin hell oregairu doesn't need to hurt me like this
Stop reminding me of my own self destructive behaviours in middle and high school
<a:MisakaBlush:560276332060344322>
Biribiri
At least the arc is finished cleanly
Railgun is paused yet again
F
Either this shit was darker than I remembered or season 2 turned it up
Could be a case of rose tinted glasses due to watching it with over a dozen friends together over lunch every week
Hachiman shooting himself with a loaded gun repeatedly
...shit son I forgot thats what this show was about
Might be other memories intruding idk
My clouded memory says Yukino was linked to that event somehow
... something something Yui's dog
... something something was it Yukino's car?
I can't remember the exact details of that first day of Hachisuffer
Well that particular Hachisuffer
Its been a solid few years and I didn't feel like a full rewatch of s1 so I'm just running off what little I remember and letting the gaps in my memory be filled as I go along
Hachiman is a tsundere... with society
Hachiman is a mood
Error 404
Brain had a memory access error and I was like "wait was this a boy or a girl"
Just watched SNAFU too ep1 and
https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/000/988/687/207.gif
I watched SNAFU in high school with the anime club 
I need to watch SNAFU too
Went through the rest of oregairu II
And there binge complete
<:yougetusedtoit:530197297976573957>
Yuki Yuna... I'm leaving off for the night right before where I assume the suffering starts
||They all pulled off the functional equivalent of zesshou so its probably gonna start the bad times||
<:MariaDefeated:688429716780089397>
Yeah.
So I started Yuki Yuna
Yuki is too pure I can't handle it
Too young to be broken. 
But I guess that applies to most characters in raildex
And she's what? Early teens?
She's mentally... broken
Among other things, it just struck me as tragic and sad
I feel terrible realizing how in being able to read everyone's minds as she does, she can never truly trust someone
My empathy overloaded for Misaki
Can probably bump the number up to 3 if Accelerator can vectorize it
There are like... two people of note in her life but not under her control
Because she needs a hug
Because she needs it
Honestly she needs really any human interaction that isn't brainwashing but yknow
Went from wanting to smack the shit outa her to wanting to give her a hug
I went from having to be held back with my arms swinging at her in the windmill formation to having to be held back to not bear hug her to death.
Its smug aura mocks me.
I do not like this painting, Charlie.
Nana wills it
Too many vertex.
Dam machine broke.
Exactly
VRV we are downloading the episodes for offline viewing.
Yknow what fuck my data plan I haven't been using it all quarantine
<:yougetusedtoit:530197297976573957>
Suffering is paused
I used my phone to finish off episode 10
Fuk
My internet died
I'm having to skip the ED, the emotional whiplash is just harsh
This is fine
All I am thinking about is the Mami tetris meme
FINE
IS
EVERYTHING

<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
Yep we in sufferville
Oh interesting. 
I mean I should have got the clue a lot earlier but I just noticed the OP changes the little flower graphics to match their current power level
Full swing suffering
<:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
I'm hitting the part of Yuki Yuna now
<:yougetusedtoit:530197297976573957>
Sisters is like... the best arc
<:yougetusedtoit:530197297976573957>
||Did you see my awesome fight?||
...||karinstoppls||
Seems legit
||And the spirits will prevent suicide but not prevent indirect suicide by breaking the fucking dam against the vertex||
Seems legit.
So ||Yuki is too emotionally unstable for them to let transform, but they let Togo do all that.||
Everything is fine.
Bai ikxi
||Rip Motoyasu's kids||
Filo best at her performance of the nutcracker
And I'm just sitting here dumbfounded with SAO's latest

Its not a punch... it just slowly smothers you
It hits hard in the indirect way
<:WhenLifeGetsAtYou:581851494064586782>
SNAFU really just knows how to pile on that emotional weight
Checks out having had 3 full seasonals
"How many seasonal anime have I watched since X"
I hate that thats my judge for time right now

Success!
Time to go to bed while like this and see the result
I've successfully horrified myself to the point I'm jumping at unexpected door creaking from my brother


Fear = (Fear) Concern;
Concern = Concern!;
Concern = Concern^2;
Can I get any Elfen Lied?
I don't recall the others exactly but I do remember my first anime flagged by this
Concern*=2;
Concern++;
But concern.
I won't cry
"In retrospect, those noisy cicadas at that moment were probably trying to warn me of all the events to come."
<:Concern:746418708737556621>
My concern is rising
<:yougetusedtoit:530197297976573957>
I'm not even sure why I wrote it down but I have just started When They Cry
Helps her child plan a murder
Most supporting parent in anime confirmed
Did his mom just give him murder advice
New conclusion: MC is the serial killer
My dood wtf
The hecc
Twice
She yeeted my boi
Headpats forbidden
DESS!?!
So the real story for arc 1 is local man goes crazy, strikes out with two best friends 🙃
I'm just gonna write that off as there was no such thing and he hallucinated it because the girls were hurt so much by his words
Needle in the food was probably the biggest evidence against this theory...
So with a big leap in judgement, the conclusion is crazy eyes = Keiichi is out of his mind
Everything non-crazy eyes lines up with the innocent narrative
Its just when I made the assumption that she was actually genuine I noticed everything that didn't line up with that story were the moments with the crazy eyes
"Time to cry"
"I wanted to give my best friend some food because he's been acting weird and his parents left town and he smashed the door on my fingers"
Vs
"Oh no the person I wanted to kill smashed my fingers in the door"
"Time to cry"
I mean the crux of my argument is it doesn't make sense for a psycho murderer to be crying like that after trying to get into their victim's place
Arc 3: Aw shit, here we go again
But I guess not
Arc 2: I have no clue what just happened people die when they are killed
So bets: Arc 1: MC is fucking insane
I have no idea what is going on
I mean I have an idea
Just way more questions than answers
But I'm pretty sure every time one of the girls had them crazy eyes in the first arc, Keiichi was hallucinating 
Mainly because of that door scene with Rena, the crying was too sincere and just felt out of place with all she had supposedly done up to that point
<:ShirabeConcern:586404485598019604>
She had bruises all over...
There is no life in those eyes
<:yougetusedtoit:530197297976573957>

I saw the premise and totally WTF'd when looking at MAL at the beginning of the season

Adorable

WTH is this show
My perception of this world is once again rocked
What the fuuuuuuuuuu-
ADHD brain gave up
Idk it just stopped gripping me and episodes felt... empty?
Admittedly fruits basket lost me... 11 episodes in
Arc 1 can be explained cleanly
The rest so far I'm lost
I think the on;y conclusion I have and am happy with is arc 1
I feel like I should have a better understanding 13 episodes in but nah
Too many contradictions
Only rational explanation I have for that arc is he was crazy
And then nope
You think you've got it all figured out
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/676996208698327049/750170920634679336/unknown.png
And then
I was like "Hell yeah I guessed who kills him this arc"
"Its not what it looks like"
Well here's Johnny

Index 3 was suffering
I doubt many are as true as Index
<:ShirabeFear:696380146248319066>
Anime Touma trash
Blame me being anime only still
The anime just doesn't do any of that justice
Onii-sama
Ah yes <:tatsuya:491649025536294912>
For the 9000th time lmao
Why is Touma skilled
I mean he basically be like "I'm a level 0 who can't do shit but I have a weird hand"
I guess that's another thing
Just take me back to academy city where at least things make some sense
9/10 things are resolved by Touma punch go brrrrrrrr
The 1/10 feel like insincere deus ex machinas
Thanks for stopping me by punching me in the face
I'll stop trying to kill you and talk to you like a regular human being
It either boils down to trump card you couldn't see coming or Touma punches the villain in the face and suddenly they friends or something
Idk I just feel no satisfaction from anything they do on the magic side in the anime
And every magic encounter is either resolved via deus ex machina or Touma hand go brrrrrrr
The good guys and bad guys are as powerful as plot demands
I hate how the anime handles the magic side in general 
The properties of magic are so unpredictable in general that I can't even assign proper stakes to any encounter
And I was so pissed by the OP teasing biribiri and us getting like... 2 Misaka scenes
It was just that much of a dumpster fire for me
I see people say the novels handled it better but it was just so painful to watch I can't even imagine how it could be good
Arc so good they had to cover it twice
Sisters is like best arc
I mean it basically introduced both biribiri and accelerator 
How is that not best arc
F in chat for Touma's ||grades||
They weren't written to be main characters originally
But you know what I mean
Ok
They march to their own beat I guess
Honestly part of what I think makes the spinoffs better
The main characters of the spinoffs are ascended side characters, who by virtue of side characters experience a different kind of characterization than main characters that are often self-interest types
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/676996208698327049/749418062066876496/57029003_2608504839221851_5681094297735135232_o.png
Also Railgun III has been pain knowing the fate of Fre nda
*insert best psychotic mugino face here*
Ha-ma-zu-ra?
<:nonails:750410963236290711>
So its like "yes that is their signature move, but they can do anything else with magic right?"
Is more there never was a hard boundary on what they could do
Something something Misaka having bust envy
*wheeze*
>Mikoto is the most flat character
She can do quite a bit with her moveset
Zap, hack, railgun, stick to metal surfaces, make fuckin weapons out of iron sand
Lots of things
But what can she do with that zap
Lots of zap
Zap
Zap
She has uhh
Well take a look at biribiri
I think its all in that ability to at least guess what will happen
For the most part
Especially when Espers are involved. They have clear cut rules on what they can and can't do so in most situations you can think about the situation and come up with ideas as to how it will unfold
At least it makes more sense ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
https://myanimelist.net/anime/41006/Higurashi_no_Naku_Koro_ni_2020
I mean they have reboot in october
||so the disease makes people go murder||
||Apparently there's some parasite-virus shit going on that makes people go crazy||
Well okay then pieces are clicking together at a rapid pace

True homies
wtf
But wtf
They are all psychotic murderers in different timelines
I mean I know what is wrong with them
What is wrong with these people ;_;
What the fuuuuuck
They know how to make a scene transition
The timing on the dialogue my lord
I found the joestar
So you were doubly summoned
Also nep was mentioned
C U L T U R E
:P
I like how my opinion on the two original psychos has gone from "AAAA CRAZY MURDERERS" to "Yknow they really are the most innocent of the bunch"
Episode 21 is still first season
Nope
Its listed as one long season
I guess?
Yeah so much makes sense after this new PoV
Here we go
The face of B R U H
Sanity not included
Arc 2 makes 40% more sense
Yknow the Mion ladder shaking makes sense now
Some sorta aerosol
... I assume its pepper spray cuz IDK what else it be
No we don't have the loli tryna stab someone with a needle after pepperspraying them
Nothing wrong happens
Happy show

I mean you aren't completely correct
Just look at the OP and ED
I mean Madoka Magica is happy show

He gave up episode 2 saying "I don't want to have nightmares" as I laughed like a fucking idiot
Bullying your brother 101

Echi-dna doing great
He was talking about how they were the same or something being a little creepy, and then when he finds out Misaka is a girl he's all "wait nvm ur a girl"

>>> Seike is a boy that is very convincing in appearing as a girl. It is not until his confrontation with Misaka Mikoto that he confirms that he is a boy after assuming Mikoto was a boy as well due to her disguise.

I look at it and like every level of concern in my body goes off at once
Either that or its part of me being afraid that I'd probably enjoy it
https://thumbs.gfycat.com/UnfitUnfinishedKitfox.gif

My feeling is its ok if they resolved the holes in the plot leading up to the season, but the holes are so gaping it seems to imply they intend to cover it
Exactly
I vaguely remember something about Kogami getting freedom 
But seeing him back in S3 just made me double take hard
Kei in particular 
He really needed some scans throughout the season/movie. Based on his general course of action I'd classify him on the level of Kogami
They talk about clouding hues but not once do they point the gun at someone and go "oh crap you at 99.9"
They trounced the psycho pass system
That's my main complaint outside the confusion with the OGs situations
Like they kinda seemed to ignore it
Although I did feel it really weird how much they talk about stress affecting hue in the previous seasons and then in this season a lot of shit happens and... nothing happens to hue
Like if we already had a season 2.5 that set up season 3, I don't think it'd get any real hate
I feel like if we had something to bridge the gap it wouldn't be so... confusing
I mean Ginoza and Kogami are just ||casually international police or some shit||
I was happy with S3 + First Inspector aside from the glaring hole of wait how the hell did the OGs get to where they are now
Up next: Dominator hand grenade 
"To whom it may concern"
"Enforce everyone in this general direction"
Hey the movie had a shotgun dominator
If it happens
And perhaps that's the plan for psychopass 4
It seems like we need a season 2.5
Aka by the books an enforcer but has the freedom of an inspector
They let the prisoner out as a "Statutory Enforcer"
I just watched first inspector
I mean season 3 kicks off with saying yeah ||Akane|| is in prison. Don't ask why they just are.
As far as I'm aware I've missed nothing
That's why I'm confused
I watched the movie
Tbh I felt it was pretty solid in it's own right
I was just at a loss as to why the OGs were where they were, like I felt I missed a season or movie
||What the fuck?||
I have one question
So I finally got around to watching psychopass 3
Keiichi

Completely subverted every expectation I had
"Kuro isn't the main character"
*click*
"Wait why is it focusing on Kotoko so much, why is the MC just... a background character now"
"Oh look the MC's MC powers are revealed. Yep this is that kinda show"
"Yes physically weak heroine needs protag to stand up for her and then she crushes all over him yep its this"
Because I got bamboozled
But it didn't
Like once Kotoko's prosthetics were revealed n stuff and she was obviously crushing on Kuro, I was like "Ah I see exactly where this trash is gonna go"
I was expecting uhh... brain... whatshisface to be the protagonist 
Was really surprised when Kotoko was behind the wheel

Watch Symphogear
Hahaha I'm having fun with ~~Talentless Nana~~ Among Us Hero Academia
So I didn't properly keep up with my usual viewing schedule
This season I've just been in a shitshow of school related stuff
Yay for catching up on two ongoing shows in one night
And now am caught up on Akudama
Cuz I was thinking it would be spoilers for the reboot 
But yeah it so off the rails and I think it will be more beneficial to have a more full understanding rather than my current half-baked understanding being screwed further
I think it time to give up on my original plan of "Not watch the Higurashi answer arcs till after 2020 version"

Here I am watching Kotura-san and we hit the summer vacation episode and suddenly cicadas are crying
"Accelerator stop"
"Accelerator how"
Accelerator but he says the vector of soul go back into ded body to animate it
"Vector" is just so open-ended that its just stupidly OP
Accelerator but he's now a teleporter obsessed with biribiri
Most not all
I think thats honestly one of the things with accelerator 
I think you can feasibly replicate most esper powers via application of vector manipulation
Accelerator but he's biribiri 2.0
Accelerator just become electromaster by messing with electron vectors 
Do it you won't
But... yeah I always took it that the phenomena caused by electromasters use of electricity were bound by physics as we know it, just that the way the electricity itself was conducting itself was altered
Your imagine breaker breaks all my logical consistency
Touma stop Toumaing
Damn it touma stop toumaing
And that something else is probably biribiri herself
I just think that the electromagnetic forces to propel coin need to be imparting an equal and opposite force against something else
But like my general understanding is biribiri be generating the electricity via this suppression of physics, and everything from there carries on as per the laws we are familiar with
I forget all the science bs they talk about ugh
I mean I guess you can handwave it away as the whole whatchamacallit science thing they talk about with the espers suppress the laws of physics because
I still can't determine where it go
Recoil
Circle back to biribiri railgun
*scratches that one off the list*
I think I will write necromancy down on the list of things Accelerator can't feasibly pull off

||Who is fucking with Rika this time, and HOW? pls just let her be she is a good gril||
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
Most serious of which be ||is there another looper and who are they, cuz I don't thhink Hanyuu was asking Rika to just suicide||
Cuz rn in Gou there are a lot of floating questions
Gou right?
I mean the latest stuff has just compounded the confusion all over again
Hm?
But how will it make sense?
But knowing the series, it will make sense
Nothing makes sense

*nothing*
So what do they do?
Which also means they bough VRV
Now they bought fucking Crunchyroll
I cri
Then they left
I was happy back when they were part of VRV and I got everything there
Am annoy with Funimation
So now I guess it is 50% "Haha I accidentally made a time machine lets fuck with it" and 50% "Oh fuck we made a time machine and fucked with it"
But with Higurashi and ReZero rn I've had so many looper conventions popping up in my feeds and I'm like "Ok I guess its time"
It has been on my todo for long time
I see how this is now
GG Kurisu being able to spot the time traveling mad scientist
My watch stopped working
You know how I said I would jinx it?
sure, keep saying that kurisutina
This is gonna be terrible timing because I know I'm jinxing it 
But I'm all "This is pretty tame, only minor things have gone weird and nothing incredibly bad has happened, why do the memes picture Okabe alongside Homura, Subaru, and others"
Also the whole thing of me going "Yea the part timer chick is p cute" and then we got the whole shirtless bit and its just "HAWT DAMN"
Kurisutina: No! You can't just make a time machine and not know how it works!
Okabe: Haha microwave go brrrrrrr
My take on Steins;Gate so far
https://imgur.com/oVQ6X8F
And thus in my brain I recall a certain gif floating about imgur

Gonna need to drag Xenonni with me through Steins 0 'cuz apparently he hasn't seen either 
Is gonna be a time when that happens
I'm still blown away by that one scene near the end of Steins;Gate where Okabe ||finally grasps the weight of returning to the beta timeline, how it will lead to Kurisu dying||
That just had so much... power

Does Elma get title of "most forgotten"
Lucoa in general is just defined by...
Huge knockers
Ara ara the poor shouta
Pls stop sexually harassing the minor
Lucoa already bothered me for basically being "Look! Huge tits!"
So Ilulu probably won't start off on the right foot for me
As I say 
Anime design looks physically older
Shares sense of dress with Elfnein I guess
The anime seems to have made her look physically older
I mean she acts childlike
And was drawn roughly the size of Kanna
Why do I do this to myself
<:VanessaCracked:639136452600397829>
Spent an hour just stunned
I'm honestly completely blown away and just at a loss

Is this Danganronpa?
And it was right on time
Hahaha I called it 
Watching Higurashi Rika said some BS so I immediately was all "Uso da!"

Dun worry about it
Of course for us westerners, ||cousins doesn't make it any better||
IIRC that was ||the story they told the world to make them back off, in reality biological siblings, although the house head says since they were both excessively genetically engineered they are no genetically similar than cousins so its fine||

Never not amused by this edit

<:salt:232670041001164800>
And I'm not subscribing to funi on principle because I am salty
I liked having affordable non-piracy method of watching
In any case still annoyed that my 'netflix of anime' got broken apart 
Just as Netflix kinda got broken apart as everyone realized there was more money in making a fuvking billion streaming subscriptions
I assumed it was under not in parallel
I guess I had my hierarchy off
Mmm
I'm kinda upset overall
Put away my pirate hat once I found VRV
Then Funimation broke off
And now Funimation owns Crunchyroll (and therefore VRV)
And they are still 100% separate subscriptions 
And most of my shows are now streaming through Funi
I mean I guess it connected dots that I already had connected myself
Hm that Higurashi episode didn't really wrap much up
Holy shit is this heavily abridged 
I feel like I'm already 8 hours into the playthrough despite being halfway through the first episode
So I decided to scratch the itch by watching the umineko anime for the first chapter
I wanted to start next chapter tonight 
But I kinda was dragging Xenonni along for the ride and figured it would be best to wait on starting a chapter
I've got Umineko reading to do in the meantime
Well you just need to solve this the ||satoko|| way, 
||kill yourself to loop back and repeat until you have made them make the anime now||
Now it is all "People are dying, I think it's my friends' fault, ohmygod they are going to kill me next"
Yknow I miss the days in Higurashi where it was all "People are dying, I think it's my friends' fault, ohmygod they are going to kill me next"
Hello yes we have Umineko but we removed all the Umineko to take the fast track to people die
By the time I finished episode 1 I was basically thinking "How the hell did you just attempt to cram something like 8 hours of reading into a single episode"
O yea I decided to watch a tiny bit of the Umineko anime to see how bad it got after finishing the VN
That was... terrible pacing out of the gate
Hello yes we have a cast of 18 main characters
Please memorize their names less than 15 minutes into episode 1 hold on to your hats
And then by the end of ep2 ||well we don't need to really introduce these characters anyway so lets just skip to the part where we kill a literal third of them||
Close nuff
'06 ||Oh no some foreman got murdered and now the guy who told me is dead, I think my friends Mion and Rena did it, I'm next||
Gou ||Oh no I'm being repeatedly killed by all my friends, I think its Satoko's fault, oh god she has a gun||
But then I realized... in a certain view we came full circle
And I was like "I miss the original plot structure, Gou is madness"
I had the '06 anime's first OP play
They didn't seem to cut anything of major substance (for once)
And the bridge to the next arc
Tbf it only contained the very end and the epilogue
And honestly episode 5 was the least offensive
And why not catch up to where I read by watching episode 5
dear lord
...I think they left out Battler saying "Yo make the next killing impossible for a human to pull off"
Episode 4 of sea cats lets go
Fuck it lets cause myself one bit more of suffering
And I just watched the 3rd
First sitting I watched the first two and was horrified at the pacing
Each episode we stray further from gods light
I just... had to witness this with my own pair of eyes
That it is
https://tenor.com/view/horny-jail-bonk-dog-hit-head-stop-being-horny-gif-17298755
Because the only thing they managed to not cut was the horny
Umineko anime is just... far too... horny
This is... honestly terrible. In so many ways.
Well. I will have to mark this as the worst preview dialogue and timing I've ever seen in anime. 
Sure lets have that dialogue over a son ||crying into his mother's lifeless body||

Finally foreground Jessica has returned
She vibe
Background Jessica is... something else
I find it utterly hilarious how hard they had to cut everything and how much they had to jam things together
Watching Umineko for the parts I've already done in the VN
https://tenor.com/view/boss-day-gif-18834440
Boku no-
^

Something about them, like moth to flame, there is something about that flaming garbage that's hard to look away from
<:yougetusedtoit:530197297976573957>
Dumpster fires are fun while they damage you on a spiritual level
Different types. I want to put them on the same scale but can't
That was... I'm not sure how I can rank that against the levels of cringe that Domestic Girlfriend caused
Yeah I have no idea what to call that concoction of emotions that brewed. Something else.
Binge over.
There we go done.
Its not the forefront of my mind 
But its certainly lurking in the depths
I mean I probably talked it up too much here
And then Mami out here just... <:yougetusedtoit:530197297976573957>
"That was me"
When Ruka was demanding 2 phone calls a day n shit I was just like "Shit I was there"
Reminding me of all the things that led to that relationship failing catastrophically
Pain.
I see the manipulation of Mami and the clinginess of Ruka
<:LumineDerp:782633575425769493>
Sides of laughter.
Eyes from tears.
Soul from cringe.
And all while twisting the knife in my heart by all the toxic parts reminding me of my ex
Yes.
This hurts 
In so many ways
So... I started binging where I left off... after episode 3
But today I had random tune in my head and I couldn't place it... then I realized it was the OP for it
So I had dropped watching rent-a-girlfriend cuz my little bro got dumped and it... well it didn't set right
I did not read "Vanguard overDess" while scrolling quickly
~~I'm now on team everyone is terrible~~
That last episode? What last episode.
No mistakes happened
Rui did nothing wrong 
Erasing everything after... before mistakes
<:LumineDerp:782633575425769493>
I remember being like "Go team Rui"
"She's the only one acting sane!"

"It can't possibly get worse"
And it only spirals out of control from there
He done dirty
And exactly that.
My anime only cut is shallow... but damn does it do him dirty in relation to the sauce
The memory loss added even more fuel to the fire
Take blank slate and wipe it even cleaner.
Lost memories
Same difference to me
Right I forgot about that
And we've still got unexplained amnesia on the anime side
S1: The fuck was that
S3: **The fuck was that**
Lots of arm choppy incidents
And the other arm choppy incident
I mean 
There was the arm choppy incident
It feels like Eren's basement levels of "its gonna happen... eventually. Until then get teased."
I know there is more under the surface
Is just so... empty
Coupled with his lack of overall character is his power being powern't
Feeling like one of those blank slate projection types
In general as anime only... Touma is largely devoid of character
"We suddenly chill now that you've punched my face, I'll stop trying to kill you now let's escape together"
Fiamma of the Right suddenly dropping everything and idk if I missed something but it just felt out of nowhere
I was most annoyed after the climax of S3
My brain is not recalling information right
Off top of my head like all the uhh whatchamacallums of the directions
The way antimagic arm also works out... I just don't vibe with it
It annoys me how the solution to every problem is punch the bad guy in the face. And then generally that bad guy suddenly is like "ok we cool now"
...
Still don't like Touma.
Can't read Biribiri brain therefore biribiri bad can't trust.
Case and point: the only person she can't mind read.
Honestly III made it dawn upon me how... tragic Misaki is
Mental Out just... ruins her ability to trust
||"You don't have boobs so you are more aerodynamic"
Biribiri trigger: activate||
||Misaka realizes Misaki uses Mental Out to get out of doing PE in school, and then they get into a hilarious catfight||
Best scene in III between Misaki and Biribiri had to be ||the one where they were both running, Misaki falls behind, Misaka is all like "hecc she betrayed me" and then Misaki rolls up while Misaka is getting all angry "slow down! I can't keep up with you"||
And then III comes along and I'm like "hecc I'm now Misaki gang too"
And swapped to Shoukuhou Misaki bad
And then I joined the Kongou Krew
"Pompous rich chick. Dont like. Clique bad."
Because I had a different but parallel sorta feelings for Kongou Mitsuko around her introduction
It was actually kinda funny
Of course Railgun III turned all that on its head
"So manipulative, I don't believe any of her friends are even real friends"
Up until Railgun III 
"She a bitch, dun like her"
High quality content
1/5
20%!
So I shall give them credit on that episode
It covered the epilogue of the first arc, and it seemed to give it the proper amount of time and didn't feel excessively rushed like the plot of the first 4 episodes
I will say episode 5, which was the last one I watched, was a rather good adaptation
Introduce the large cast in about 2 minutes total
Hi yes let's cut out all the exposition
<:LumineDerp:782633575425769493>
It was amusing watching them butcher it like Beatrice butchered the entire family
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
So I instead watched the episodes of the anime for the first arc
I kinda dragged Xenonni along for the ride 
And I was having fun reading with friend 
But he been rather busy 
As have I 
So reading has been on hold for 2 weeks
1/8 done
Arc? Whatever call it
Or what are they called
I finished the first chapter of it
So in terms of 'reading' I've got that for a few hundred hours
I've already fucked up by starting Umineko
Exactly why I've avoided <:yougetusedtoit:530197297976573957>
Honestly probably should read eventually 
But I haven't touched a LN in half a decade
Heckin vectors m8
... Vectors is the most BS thing ever lmao
While Espers seem to follow some basic logical continuity even if it's not 1-to-1 with real physics
My anime only perspective 
The magic side is very... unintuitive and under explained as to the point any 'magician' gets involved in a conflict everything feels like a deus ex machina asspull
Watching week by week the tree was hella oppressive
The tree drained the color from the episodes for like an entire month
Right that was the other pain
Necromancy can't revive that dream
F
But that ded
Lowkey hoped she'd pop in as some sorta sidekick for the rest of Accelerator
I liked her
F
I did like the introduction of necromancer my brain fog is clouding her name
Ye
... Accelerator anime kinda... grated me the wrong way 
I think its because I expected another arc 
And the one they covered overstayed its welcome for me
Yea see it both from Index and Railgun
Slap the near godhood out of em
Level 6 is where we need Touma
Yes level 6
<:VanessaCracked:639136452600397829>
Level 6
The whole... arc
But Misaka was quite separated and spent a lot of time with Misaki
||When Misaki made all Misaka's friends forget she exists to protect them?|| My recollection of the exact events is fogged, probably due to me being near pass out hour
Unless you mean another time
Oh that happened in III
Best frienemies
It's just they bicker the whole way
Of course they do
But they are angry that both their names start with "Misak"
This city's too small for two level 5 "Misak"
They had the jet scene
Why
And didn't deliver at all
They like spent so much time building hype
Such insignificant shit in the end
And it was like... nothing
The OP hyped up Misaka jet shit for months
... index III op lied to us
And here my anime only shows once again for moving from Touma being flat character to a bug zapper with personality
~~Flatisjustice~~
https://tenor.com/view/fun-pointing-not-scientifically-possible-gif-14882344
<:blobrollsafe:805133519675850753>
||~~Also Misaka scientifically proven to be best girl, why else did they make thousands upon thousands of clones of her~~||
Last Order cute
Ye
:p
Ok but what about MisakaMisaka
Oof
Best Misaka is worst Misaka
Given the nature of how she activates it
Sill tho where that recoil at 
I assume she's accelerating coin against electromagnetic field in her body
Overall logically consistent
And you can draw connections between em
Like Misaka does a lot of very different things 
But they are all united under that common thing
Electromagnetism 
She can spiderman on yo metal surfaces
She control iron sand to make thing
Railgun (Where is the equal and opposite reaction btw)
*hacking noises*
Electricity
Like ya look at Misaka since she seems to have a very basic skill that is used in a variety of applications all the time
For all jojo archvillain have time powers
No he's jojo archvillain

On verge of turning off given its 3 AM
My brain is mashed potato at moment
Index III was soul gouging. 
I wanted to drop it so many times but I forced myself to stay due to 4 seasons of sunk cost fallacy between Index and Railgun
Like the entirety of the season
It was heavy letdown
For something that took up part of the OP and spent as much time as they did laying down the "Hey Misaka is gonna get involved eventually" with all those random scenes
It was just so... minor and unimportant
She be spittin fire tho
3:52 of Zura
4:20 of Dess

Context not required.
LMFAO 
Are ya winning son?
Ok but same difference 
They seem to be agitated by one another's existence
Although the title is misleading 
Misaka is irritated by Misaki's existence, so they need to include every Misaki scene
Gotta love these two catfighting

Corporate needs you to find the differences between these pictures
So I'm looking forward to reading that
I decided to get the 86 LN given I've got a long ass drive with the move on Wednesday
And maybe that's why I'm not one to mind being spoiled usually 
Because even if I know the outcome, I'm still scouring for those small hints that are dropped leading up to such events
I like foreshadowing 
It gets the gears in the brain going trying to process what you actually just read
But if they'd just left it there that would've been pretty cool too
... oh my page cut off and the next sentence outright stated it
Ooo. Yeah I definitely like all the foreshadowing in the novel
||"Why are you so interested in us?"
Suddenly an image of flames appeared in Shin's mind ... He'd never attended a bonfire or burning at the stake, so it was likely one of the Handler's memories.||
But I was like "yeah he's crazy but that alone isn't enough"
... true
I do think the 86 anime delivered well
When they were talking about Undertaker driving his commanding officers mad and then swiftly showed him pulling some real aggressive BS I'm like "yeah that would probably make a handler upset but... not crazy"
Far less moving parts, far less points of critical failure
In general tho, especially in current times, tracks superior
Tracks are more efficient, but legs can generally boast better mobility in really uneven terrain
Far more practical design than the usual humanoid mecha you see
I also really appreciate the insectoid mech designs
So its certainly a little different on the order of delivery
I mean it also mentioned bits of the crash out of the gate, and that didn't get covered till the latest episode
Which is why I really raised my eyebrow when they were all like "don't transmit data the enemy can intercept it" and I was just thinking "and they can't intercept your talking?"
I didn't gather that the para-RAID device linked the users minds and something something scifi bs means no radio waves or anything to transmit data
Huh I think I missed that detail in the anime
If I finish all 7 on the trip consider it a miracle
Now have volumes 1-7
Fuck it I don't know how long an 86 novel is and I decided to load it on my old kindle and I wouldn't be able to load more on the road
I say as a binge to disqualify all the random pokemon and dragon ball and what have you I'd seen at random
First anime I watched as a binge... Outlaw Star
This is fine
Which is worse, the suspense or the suprise
<:LumineDerp:782633575425769493>
Pain peko 
I just kinda realized that now in 86 ||I know exactly who will die and when, so I'll be just sitting in anticipation the whole time||
And I'm just dying of laughter reading it because I didn't expect this at all
And then I continue reading the afterword and it basically feels like a long fetish rant on garter belts
I immediately recall one scene that had a lot more detail than usual
Help I'm dying 
I just finished volume 1 of 86
And in the afterword, the first sentence 
"Aren't garter belts just the best?"
I'm once again amused by the author's culture
Which also confuses my smooth brain
And I blame Honkai/Genshin because I also have hard time picturing "Raiden" as a guy at this point
Heckin 86
Keeps saying "Kiri" and you know exactly where my mind goes
Not for the legion tho
500 - 1000 seems more on order with the reported destruction
Hell even 5000 probably too big
I remember one thing stating something like 50,000 people killed in one coordinated bombardment 
I just internally divided by 10 because that number was too big
A single death is a tragedy, a million deaths are a statistic
Like 10-100x more than they should be
I always feel like death counts are over-inflated
Every scene where the infantry was mentioned it was like "Yeah hundreds of thousands of them died" and I'm like "HOW IS THIS A VALID STRATEGY"
||The KDR of the infantry seems worse than that of the aluminum coffins with bad pilots||
I really want to see the ||Republic, especially their armor. I want to see why the hell they can even consider sending humans out against the Legion due to what sound like really inferior armored exoskeletons||
Although I do forgive the author 
As without sequels in mind, ending that book on that scene was really cool
Plot armor via continuity
Especially since they tried so hard to make you think the characters had died, but you are just like "I know they are alive and well after this point, so they fine"
Which IMO books 2 and 3 would have been better off without knowing of the plot armor
And it meant you knew exactly who had plot armor for the next two full books
It skipped two whole books
Because due to the amount of time it skipped to show that scene...
But personally I hope they leave out that ending from the first book
At best we end at the end of the first book
Probably how it will end.
<:VanessaCracked:639136452600397829>
And by fun I mean pain.
The final roster of the 86 of spearhead will be ||Undertaker, Webrwolf, Laughing Fox, Snow Witch, and Gunslinger||
So taking the group photo and drawing an X over ||basically everyone's|| faces was... fun
Just to twist that knife a little more
The part of the OP with the field of flowers shows everyone who has died out of spearhead, and it seems to update with every episode
Also the opening will keep a tally of the dead for us :)
I used the photo from the latest episode with everyone at the party 
I think Laughing Fox and Undertaker weren't in the photo, but everyone else was
Aand back to watching 86
I went and started lining up pictures against the names I knew just to solidify the connections between the characters and the names I'm reading in the books
Book 3 of the 86 LN
||They really tried to make it seem like spearhead was getting killed or something by seemingly blowing up spearhead squad's mechs and having them DC from the PARA-RAID, but that was a bad suspense given the first book ended with Spearhead reuniting with Lena||
Best boi
A roller coaster the whole way
That episode was a ton of fun lmao
I love this idiot.

Also Rose is precious.
At. All. <https://youtu.be/yQOqj4wXxKA?t=35>
And it does not acknowledge konosuba at all
But its like... proto-konosuba
At times
So I'd say its a little... rough around the edges
Same author as Konosuba, was actually a work written prior to Konosuba but didn't get serialized until Konosuba's success
Think a scumbag in a vein similar to Kazuma working for a scifi evil organization that wants to conquer worlds 
And he's on a fantasy type world doing shenanigans
Just random observation from Combatants Will Be Dispatched OP 
Good trigger discipline Alice.
I had just made a cup of hot tea. 
I was taking a sip and saw this. 
It burns.
I just spit out my tea seeing this

They get introduced to Symphogear trying to figure it out
Its (relatively) easy for anyone who knows Symphogear 
Or at least browses the wiki for a bit
Two people already solved the password
420 IQ strat to recruit into the cult
Its time for big brain camera angles
||"Wait we're back at the beginning arc?"
"Wait of course we are back its answer arc time"||
My reaction was slow and funny
kekw
🤔
https://i.redd.it/uz9g37x3tn871.jpg
It's funny because the friend that loves Monogatari hates all of those things like that friend of yours
How do I rewind time again?
Yknow what I wish I could go back to before knowing about the band aid
For every episode
Yes 
But its more in his reaction on the level of "Wait I forgot this episode was like this"
I also must laugh 
My friend is very anti-ecchi 
Yet vehemently supports Monogatari 
And then we all sit down and watch Monogatari 
And everyone is like "This is like wayyyyy too horny my guy"
<:concern:747570729792569415>
NO BULLI
Also true
In conclusion: ||I guess Featherine mugged Hanyu for her lunch money or something. How can anyone bulli Hanyu||
I was going frame by frame trying to see if I could make out anything from the fragments
<:ShirabeConcern:586404485598019604>
...Dear lord what did they do to Hanyuu
Well. One funny thing I noticed was Satoko's reflection changing to her younger self during the run sequence
*Insert me pouring over the Higurashi Sotsu OP*
...
Speaking of seacats
<a:vibe_cat:747653055645876235> 
https://youtu.be/rraD3nkE--Q

And of course magical gohda chef
Need more witches and tiny bombs
I mean, more than the current amount
How long till Umineko breaks in
Kk yep
Time to pull up Gou
IDK the furniture that well
I'm trying to dredge more theories out of the higurashi sotsu OP
... is this shot... ||Keiichi's house?||
||But of course, injection go BRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR||
||Mion going L5 seems to violate one of the prior 'rules' of the looping in that she never goes L5||
And the pattern ||in these sections seems to have the victim shown first and the killer second, and seemingly Mion was the killer in the second arc of Gou which seemed out of place and we wondered if the swap had happened again.||
||Given Keiichi's issues with Rena started with him not noticing Rena's victim in the junkyard and ended with them fighting in his house, and how Rika and Satoko started their fight in Hinamizawa and ended it via chandelier in St Lucia, I'm curious what that might extrapolate for the sonozaki twins.||
So this hinges on the three pairings shown in the OP
Keiichi then Rena at the junkyard then at Keiichi's house
Shion then Mion at the Sonozaki house then at st lucia academy 
And finally Rika and Satoko at the school in Hinamizawa concluding at st lucia
My general take is... well the gore aspect... its like... a spice?
It can really invoke some powerful emotions in the reader/watcher.
But there comes a point that a line seems to be crossed where its just... gore for gore sake 
And I feel like that line is being crossed with how excessive its getting, and the circumstances don't seem to warrant the levels they've gone to
I do think the high pressure blood in the new Higurashi is just... too exaggerated 
In Gou I kinda gave the benefit of the doubt ||and blamed it on the syndrome||
But my benefit of the doubt has certainly expired
<:yougetusedtoit:530197297976573957>
And then with the end of today's Sotsu...
It was just FAR too much for me
<:TsubasaDisgust:349013662775902209>

Hecc why emoji break
||Hi yes I killed your brother and squeezed every last drop of blood out of him, resurrecting him and doing it all over again just to make you wine from his final drops of blood.

Me: :TsubasaZesshou: :TsubasaDisgust:
<:nonails:750410963236290711>
I wanted to puke after reading Rosa's tea party with Beatrice
I went from "This is just far too much" to "I'm used to this now" until I wrapped back around to "This is too much"
<:VanessaCracked:639136452600397829>
I can only handle so much when they cry
I'm gonna need comfy
Wait we have a 6th main character? Naaah.
And Shion too
She stopped existing for the latter half of Gou
Poor Satoshi just deleted from the timeline
https://mobile.twitter.com/Katrinci_Art/status/1411725747593547776
I'm playing Umineko and got introduced to ||Lambdadelta and her laugh is just 110% Satoko's and I'm just like "How did Ryukishi even claim that this character wasn't Satoko||
Did you know in the higurashi universe one child has 2 elephants worth of blood in their veins?
Nipah~

Are ya winning son?
The cuts back and forth had me laughing because it was so wrong
Just night and day
The irony was terrible

Higurashi
Fight on nanodesu

Nipah~
Oh right its Thursday
Took me a good while to find it
Put the memes in the bag

*Hears harpsichord*
Reading more umineko 
Beatrice breaking character is adorable 
"Mooooommmmm, Battler is beating me at chessssss" -Childish Beatrice probably
Shame it didn't take too long for
Aww this section of Umineko was so kyuuute
That will probably get to me at some point during the rest of my Umineko reading
<:LumineDerp:782633575425769493>
... so I'm playing my good ol shared VA games again and going through and getting bamboozled 
So now I realize not only that Hanuu and Maria share VAs between Higurashi and Umineko... but I thought this VA was familiar and then noticed a certain Serena Cadenzavna Eve on the list of roles
Thats certainly how to make chapter 3 of umineko... interesting
But it is stated <#337805317276565525> is VN zone
Its a gray area in the end
But one states VNs explicitly


And honestly reading umineko feels more like watching an anime given... well choices = 0
It true
But I'd do that in the correct channel lol
I can offer up my proper reaction later
... and the end of chapter 3 was like 20 plot twists deep and the chess board got flipped so many times I forgot which side I was playing on
Whatever close nuff
Crap
Wait no gaming is VNs
Iirc
Anime club is for VNs too
In chapter 3 Rudolph and Kyrie were absolutely badass
Bonus round!
Umineko has 8 main chapters
And then Saku said here have 9th
But I learned Saku existed because Higurashi Sotsu's Analogy sounds *very* similar to Saku's own opening
Yeah and I have no idea how I'll obtain Umineko Saku in the first place
Remote access to my desktop
Steamlink
I've spent more time reading umineko than I've spent playing a good number of games in my steam library
And based on the time measured by the game
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
But wait there's more I learned there is a 9th chapter so... 
1/3 through all this
So that's 3/8 done
Finished chapter 3 last night
And now I can just plop in the couch, pick up game controller, and say "Time to read seacats"
Replaced with more elegant Raspberry Pi
This was the janky laptop hack
Now that I have my ideal setup for reading Umineko it's much easier to read

So then... why was this in chapter 2 of the VN
||So she shoots 4 times and takes out 4 goats in the animation. This lines up with how bullets were declared anti-magic in chapter 3||
Okay skipped a bit because I couldn't take it, straight to the end of chapter 2 because I wanted to see badass ||Rosa||
I can't keep up with the rate at which things happen
Even knowing everything that is going on
Yeah this anime is not good

Yknow what this is legit anime now 
So I decided to pull up the Umineko anime to see how they ~~mis~~handled the chapters I've read so far
And now IDK if I'm reading too far into things with my current knowledge... but in the first witches tea party... 
||Bernkastel is offering her help to seemingly the viewer/player, but if I use my newfound knowledge of Ange-Beatrice getting involved... could it perhaps not have been directed towards Battler as one would assume in that original context, could she instead be talking to another character? Or is she truly breaking the 4th wall?||
This is why I like this series 
I'm in for a ride even re-watching

Topics spawn where they spawn
Because l o r e
The whole reason I'm reading Umineko is because of Higurashi Gou/Sotsu

Watching Sotsu while reading through Umineko is certainly brain melty
Lambdadelta confirmed?
Higurashi Sotsu at this point
Amazing callbacks
I was so hyped at this moment in Higurashi today
I mean the Umineko anime compresses stuff so hard it feels butchered
10/10 would watch at 1 AM again
Especially the first arc
Oh yeah Higurashi is peak horror
Umineko: Island mansion of rich family. Murders happen.
Higurashi: Small japanese town. Murders happen.
Same goes for Umineko 
And I can't speak for Ciconia as I have not played it
And its all about piecing it together
Each loop is different
A heavy mystery that you need to see looped many times to understand
I'll put it at that.
Timeloops. Everyone tends to die.
The premise of Higurashi?
Let me tally up my playtime... I think I'm roughly 100 hours into reading Umineko and I'm partway through book 5 of ~~8~~ 9
Aka Umineko When They Cry (Don't watch the anime for that its bad) and Ciconia When They Cry
Because Gou/Sotsu have a little bit of fun referencing the other works of the author
And if you want the full full experience go deep into the fate style black hole
Higurashi but its just silly SoL
Really just watch Kira and end there <:kappa:584121510877462541> 
https://youtu.be/l7k91ktMdWY

Thats everything up until the new seasons
And then watch Higurashi Kai before Gou
So in reality you need to go back and watch the 2006 Higurashi anime first
But Gou is a fake reboot and is actually a sequel itself
But its a sequel to Gou
Sotsu is the latest season
So
If not cicadas crying... seagulls!?!?!?

<:sus:830919200272285706>
Thats how anime law works right?
~~Rena is cute therefore she is innocent of all crimes~~
https://c.tenor.com/tPNTAcKdCqIAAAAC/rena-ryuugu.gif

Yeah lol
O rite
<:LumineDerp:782633575425769493>
I wanted to do in one tag but it didn't allow multiline
||Bernkestel adds super detective mary sue to the game||
||Battler and detective solve the epitaph before the first murders, finding the gold||
||Battler is now unoficially the family head, Krauss and Natsuhi refuse to acknowledge it until they hear from Kinzo... who they know is dead because they've been hiding the fact for over a year||
||Mary sue summons a paladin from heaven to slay witches, namely Beatrice||
||The teams are autobalanced, Battler jumps out a window and saves Beatrice||
My uhh 
Extremely abbreviated description of book 5 so far
And I quote from my last barrage of screenshots 
"there is so much to unpack here that I literally cannot keep up"
On the other hand I have been forcibly dragging Xenonni through Umineko via my hastily transcribed mixture of sparknotes and screenshots in a discord thread
<:yougetusedtoit:530197297976573957>
I couldn't drag my friends in, they turned away as soon as the horror tag appeared
I sit waiting with baited breath 
It's not every day you get reactions out of someone experiencing the masterful horror of Higurashi for the first time
Feels got isekai'd
A full on semi truck to the feels
This line hit like a truck in Umineko
And that double focus is how I approach every scene now
I viewed all of Ange's plotline ||through a double focus, looking at it as if there were no magic and explaining everything via rational means, and then simultaneously viewing the magic side. ||||If I am to take the non-magic as the truth... when Ange killed everyone using the stakes of purgatory, Amakusa had figured out something was wrong and walked up and RATTATATTAT and shot all the people.||
PLAY BALL
I've gathered that ||what is shown isn't necessarily true|| my prime example being ||Natsuhi having tea with Kinzo being overwritten when Bernkastel denied it in red||
And uhh... chin up... fight on... niipah~!
Godspeed
||Battler isn't trying to disprove the existence of witches, he's disproving the use of magic in the massacre. Therefore witches can exist in Higurashi without changing the outcome of Umineko||
So just as ||Battler seems to be siding with Beatrice a little... I'm starting to side with her too||
In all honesty, if I follow Battler's line of reasoning to the conclusion... ||I honestly want him to be wrong. Stripping all the witches and magic from this tale makes for a dark depressing story of how a whole family slaughtered one another leaving only Eva alive in the end.||
I'll ship it.
My big joke was ||"The teams have been auto balanced" as Battler broke Beatrice out of the locked room before Dlanor could <DIE THE DEATH> her||
<:yougetusedtoit:530197297976573957>
I know
Tea party featuring Dlanor
First twilight chapter 5
<:sus:830919200272285706>
Sorry you get this degeneracy instead.
Like they bounce off one another so well
Really good
Also the characters are good
I like that description
Termination.
Anime violates the rules.
Knox's 8th: 
It is forbidden for the case to be resolved with clues that are not presented.
I was lost having read the novel lmao
Like if you watch Umineko anime, you will be lost
And much was lost
What was like... 10 hours of reading got crammed into 2 episodes
He's in a biiiit of trouble
Rena was there and dad saw her, ||but Keeichi never saw her... and he was on the phone with the police||

He has air conditioning
Welcome to Higurashi proper lmao
<:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
*but its great*
Because sometimes you go too far digging for clues and go down a wrong trail lmao
Dud falling for red herrings
https://tenor.com/view/gundam-oh-no-im-a-genius-gif-20412333
I felt like a genius any time my theories were proven correct in Higurashi. Honestly best part of the When They Cry series, the properly placed foreshadowing and hints that are difficult to piece together but when you do it feels incredibly rewarding
Iirc my biggest question out of the first arc of Higurashi was "Why was Rena apologizing?"
Like the crying seemed out of place to me
<:yougetusedtoit:530197297976573957>
Buckle up for 13 more episodes of confusion lol
KENTA KUN

Get in the van.
Mmmmmmaebara-san
I have air conditioning
Because they are coming after Keiichi after they get Satoshi 👀
Why is Satoshi?
What is Satoshi?
Who is a Satoshi?
That and Satoshi just getting wiped off the map
Adios
Bai
Lmao Shion going poof
Timeline is fucked yo
Uhh don't think about it
<:Thonk:520209399801839648> 
So Higurashi is 1983
Umineko is 1986
Gou-Sotsu ||Rika enters St Lucia  1988||
Umineko ||Ange attends St Lucia in up to 12 years prior to 1998 since its elementary-college level school||
This means there is a fragment of a possibility of the two meeting.
So fun fact.... it is an airsoft gun. It never gets used. Never acknowledged either. Its just there.
Also she doesn't know.
Love Lena's new design
F
Okay more "Disproportionately detailed"
*insert 02 "You're a pervert" here*
"Ah thats why that one scene was a little... too detailed"
I was just so thrown off by the chad just opening with that
Its not wrong
Can never look at them the same way again
||Aren't garter belts just the best?|| -Asato Asato

Like playing Genshin Impact... just see Sucrose and Asato Asato's words ring through my mind
Also I'll just never get over that author's note
More Lena during that time is appreciated
Yeah 
Given the first novel got us pretty invested in Lena just... erasing her existence for an extended period of time wouldn't be good
It led to me spending the two books just getting a little impatient "let's get back to where we left off ok?"
Buuut... well just revealing the 'twist ending' of the 3rd book at the end of the 1st...
It was an ending choice
Basically they dropped that too soon, and given it was the first novel of the series and was probably intended to be standalone
Honestly the most painful part about it was how they ended the first novel ||just revealing Lena meeting the squad, so you spent the whole next two books like "come on reunite already"||
Yeah that period without Lena felt a little... rough
https://tenor.com/view/world-series-my-body-is-ready-gif-10084647
But 86 is light novel
So I gobbled that up
I usually am not one to have read the sauce because I don't like reading manga
And now they've scattered to the wind.
All my shows used to be in like 1-2 places
Fuck it back to full piracy
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
I was like "Cool what streaming service"
"Hidive"
"Oh cool I haven't used them much but they were always a thing on my VRV subscription since I lost Funi-"
And luckily that was the correct decision because Gou was ***not*** a reboot
I ended up caving in and going through Kai
But uhh
I almost started Gou without seeing Kai so I could double down on the extra question arc confusion
Cute lil gremlin of a ||princess||

So done with all this bullshit of everything being on like 20 separate subscription platforms
I think its about time I completely stopped streaming services and instead just spent that on a proper VPN @_@
By not understanding the "finite" ||they are setting themselves up for complete and total annihilation of themselves when they are overrun||
<:CarolYandere:424047704826707980>
So on "infinite" ||they know they are finite. Their goal is genocide. They believe the enemy is programmed to die after a set time. They want to exterminate the 86 by the end of the war. That end isn't coming.||
And everyone in the country is like "Lena wtf they are just 86"
||She doesn't know the 5 are alive||
Was kinda... disappointed in Sotsu's handling overall. They didn't distance ||answer arc from question arc enough, so it was like watching a very long recap episode except that recap episode lasted an entire season.||
That's about what I gathered
https://tenor.com/view/rika-furude-higurashi-nipah-shion-gif-20273950

Didn't realize it until I watched Ep1 of YuYuYuS3
Set the bar a little low

~~Please let me live these happy times in WaSuYu in peace pls~~
So we know where it ends up <:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
2 years in the future from WaSuYu
||Hey we have a new girl that fills the same personality traits||
Season 2 is a prequel to season 1
In season 1 ||one of them is so crippled they can't leave their hospital bed, one has lost their memory and forgotten the others and their previous life, and the third... well||
Rules are for people who can't afford fines <:blobrollsafe:805133519675850753>
And if there is one thing I learned about the YuYuYu cast, its they all have an unnaturally high obsession with udon.
Ohno 
As punishment for brainwashing your underclassmen...
The ultimate punishment has been administered 
***No udon for a week***
Adorable ||I hope nothing meguca happens to them because being meguca is suffering|| ||Oh wait||
So now I am here.
||Of course there never was time to mourn||

Holy crap
Picked up next episode of WaSuYu
||This is the hardest I've cried in recent memory||

The answer arc
Welcome to the lore
<:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
With younger characters
I'm just referring to the increase of overall fan service in the 2nd season
Basically compare the first 5 vs the last 3
https://youtu.be/H1JeqfV3kj4
I guess better reference
*But children*
They are tame
https://youtu.be/iyg6ZIi8m48
<:GanyUh:875231356718841917>
More so than normal
Its more uhh just the incredibly young nature of the characters
https://tenor.com/view/chrishansen-gif-8205102
Hello yes 
Can we have less emphasis on the chests and butts of **elementary schoolers**

Which is saying something because I was pretty impressed with how little they went for those camera angles in YuYuYu (with one clear exception), but I was like "well clearly is because these are middle school children"
The whole X stars Y flowers line of tracks from the OST are pretty good
One of my favourites
I forget what they titled it... it was one of the 10 or 11 stars 5 flowers tracks
Just beautiful
Same style and that funky alien language they use
Yep
I do love YuYuYu's OST
So I guess this season, definitely getting the YuYuYuS3
Gonna join for space vampire... 
86 back...
What else do I need to pile on
NGL ||I expected one more episode before this arrived. I knew it was coming. But not now.||
I mean I cried a ton already
<:yougetusedtoit:530197297976573957>
<:HibikiHi:336657249827028993>
And here we have it
<:yougetusedtoit:530197297976573957>
<:slain:629400121523830784>
Its cool AF
Like the whole mid combat transformation
And Yuna's first transformation
FIST
And Yuki Yuna has that big <:HibikiScreech:633468460030230548> energy in her fighting
<:KirikaMunch:672599382670966785>
But hey if you like Madoka, why not pile more of it on
The magical girl side is really just Madoka Magica all over again tho
Its just so... cute.
Just doing anything they can to help people in mundane ways
Plus the whole hero club aspect... its admirable
Yeah they are a tighter knit group in my eyes
~~Mainly once things get really being meguca is suffering~~
But it does hit different in certain aspects
YuYuYu is pretty much a Madoka clone 
I won't deny it
Everything is Umineko lmao
...I've been reading too much Umineko
Witch of Miracles intensifies


Yeah Elaina already seems to be the comfy I needed
I figured it was magical hammerspace or something 
But uh
Yeah that angle was not helpful
My eyes caught it and I had to go frame by frame to make sure I wasn't completely crazy
*what did you do with the broom Elaina*


Explain.
Elaina.
And now I am presented with immediate questions
Why not
And given WaSuYu hit a little hard
So that reminded me I had added that to my list of "To warm heart" or something
Fortunately I am pro at being spoiled
Actually the reason I fogor I didn't watch S2 was because someone may have looked about wikis and gotten short summaries on stuff prior
And by speedrun I mean squeeze an episode into random half hour gaps in my schedule
Which is why I am now speedrun S2
I mean I watched ep1 of S3 because I no-brained and forgot I didn't watch S2 yet
Crying is disabled. Tearducts defunct.
🙃
The answer is 0
*How much more can there possibly be*
How much crying can there possibly be
I catch glimpses of their own paranoia 
Is this how they are feeling?
I wonder if this is how my D&D players feel 
I have explicitly been trying to make things have a more... easygoing happy vibe to contrast the months of brutality that was a normally brutal DM running Curse of Strahd
Kinda sad how far my paranoia is up because I'm constantly expecting the worst 
And everything just resolves so... comfy
My uhh... unplanned addition of YuYuYu didn't help that
I had decided to use it as a bit of healing because the volume of When They Cry content I'd been consuming started getting a little... mentally heavy after being down that hole for months
https://na.cx/i/6W1Yd7G.gif
Elaina has been fun so far
Can't make fine wine without time
I don't think Kai would pack the same punch without the volume of questions that was constructed over the duration of the first season
I think this is known as your reaction to having your questions finally answered
Lol
||No escape, even if your heart stopped beating. Can't commit suicide. No escape at all. You are trapped in the remnants of your body.||
Honestly the thing in my eyes on the magical end of Madoka vs YuYuYu... 
||In a way I find YuYuYu's negatives more horrific than Madoka's, the witch thing was set up in a way it almost seemed like your personality died and you were no longer you, which is as good as already being dead. On the other hand in YuYuYu, they slowly lost body function until they were trapped in what is left of their body... with no escape||
No
And it's not over till you solve the mystery
And then we do it all again 
Because this is When They Cry
*insert Beatrice's over the top laughing here*
When the seagulls cried ||none were left alive.||
Enter the Golden Witch Beatrice.
A storm hits and they are all trapped
They want to divide the money
A rich family convenes on a private Island because grandpa is about to kick the bucket
Its just a novel with extra pictures and music
Same for Higurashi, there is no branching
No options. Is a straight line.
Its a "kinetic" VN
In Umineko's case there are no routes
The anime for Umineko just cut out lots of everything important and then speedran what was left
We have good VN adaptations
Higurashi is VN adaptation
I mean
<:yougetusedtoit:530197297976573957>
And I'd already read the novel
I got lost watching the anime
You can't understand shit from the anime
No.
But for the full comprehension of Sotsu... a full comprehension of Umineko is beneficial
You get a (brief) introduction to Bernkastel in Kai anyway
Honestly if you get a quick primer on Witches you are probably solid enough for Sotsu
Apologize!
amiright
Fucking witches



But my brain run by seagulls
I'm vibin over in Wandering Witch The Journey of Elaina 
~~Because I heard about it on a whim that has nothing to do with a civilization owl that fogor~~
But uhh... unplanned YuYuYu pit stop means... need more mental recovery lol
I had been planning on break
lmao
I meant they just shared tea :)
As tea party is a really significant things
Yeah lol bad wording on my part
Nonono I didn't mean the tea party tea party
Battler broke ||Beatrice out of the locked room saving her from Dlanor's inquisition, Dlanor comes and says hi afterwards and says nothing personal its just business||
That's around where I left off
So uhh... tea party 
Vergilia and Dlanor vibin
Haven't read since I last posted about it
https://na.cx/i/6W1Yd7G.gif
Need to recharge off wholesome content
The nonstop umineko vibes are getting powerful
I'm taking a little break
But nothing a bit of lack of morals cant solve
Yeah, anti-piracy measures
Given I'm only partially into book 5 myself
I'd say first chapter or two are enough for getting into Higurashi Sotsu
Uhh... but to get into the Zip they need a password that they make you get from the PC version and the manual of the play station version... but this is the internet so if you don't want that pain the password *can be found*
Difinitive
Yes
That's the one thing that they didn't cut
Battler being a pervert
Hey it keeps the most important character building
Do not collect $200
Do not pass go
Straight to jail
Go straight to jail
Delet.
Can't have a proper mystery if the evidence is not provided before the reveal
Yes it violates all of Knox's laws
Umineko has 4 question arcs 4 answer arcs and apparently a bonus arc that aaaaaaaaa
It runs better than a emulator imo
That link is a site where they ported it all to PC
*laughs in being me*
Because you don't have a play station
https://umineko-project.org/en/
But has English text
Japanese voices
Or get mods to make the PS voices happen on PC
Gotta either play the play station version
But also yes
Bottom text
Pachinko Kyrie

Ps3 with that mod also has the mouth animations
Yeah lol
<:incompotent:885921141221363752>
*There is no escaping R07 art*
This is a mod for the PC game to add voice acting and the ps3 sprites
https://07th-mod.com/home/
Has voice acting and more modern sprites
You want the playstation remaster
lol
How dare you bash R07's art
||WHY DID THEY DO THAT, THEY WASTED ENTIRE SEASON IN MY EYES||
Sotsu not gou
My brain reversed the titles for a moment
Backwards
I mean sorry
Why did gou ||just... repeat everything. Made me feel like most of the season was wasted||
But the experience may be better
It can probably be enjoyed without Umineko
You are by no means required
*If you want to dive that deep*
So not having a basic Umineko foundation will have all those things fly over your head
I think the best way of putting it is Umineko characters are referenced in Higurashi
And a soft reference or two to Ciconia
New Higu makes references to Umineko
None. At. All.
And there are no familiar faces across any of the games
There is another
I'm not touching Ciconia till I have kill Umineko
Hence 07
Ryukishi07 is the author
07th expansion is uhh yeah the company
I got that vibe
(Beatrice has the best laughs)
The laughs won't end
https://twitter.com/animegirlnoises/status/1221189238944714753
Hehehehe
Refuses to elaborate.
Small bombs.
~~Sotsu felt like endless 8~~
But endless 9 in Umineko is good
But I can see why it may be off putting
I loved it
<:nonails:750410963236290711>
A more in depth explanation that I will provide with minimal actual spoilers... 
||Sotsu was answer arcs to Gou, but the answers were stretched out too long and left everyone dissatisfied with it feeling like a whole season of recap||
No, as Gou/Sotsu are anime original
Thats the cleanest cut way to put it
Lets just say... Sotsu left some people upset.
Hanyuu best
And then we have HANYUU (auauau)
Or yknow Mion go BRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR

lmfao
Oh I saw that
I uh discovered this exists in the Higurashi mobage just now
But the wiki lists the sprites off as "Original" "Console" and "Pachinko"
They were first made for the pachinko games if I recall my lore correctly
IDR
I believe Steam = Pachinko
Pachinko sprites go BRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR
She's ur ~~step~~ mom
PS3 Kyrie
They don't address if the orphanage got shut down
Its unclear if the orphanage still exists
They both need to have plenty of orphans and keep them from telling the outside how fucked up the place is
Hence why they are so strict on runaways
As the government pays the orphanage based on how many children they house
And of course none of the kids leave
The abuse is not known outside of the orphanage
The orphanage is out deep in the wilderness
<:yougetusedtoit:530197297976573957>
Who's gonna protect them? Their parents?
||no friends for 34||
||they ded||
If you don't like 34, Vier Dreissig says hi
Welcome to 34's backstory
Hanyuuuuuuu
I mean Sotsu has the legendary ||Teppei|| redemption arc 
So anything is possible
Don't worry about it
The funny thing is she's ||more redeemable than other villains in WTC *cough cough sotsu*||
<:LumineDerp:782633575425769493>
Just uhh *shoves pile of bodies under rug* ignore that will ya?
In a twisted mind... her actions can be justified... everyone is a hero in their own story
She loves grandpa a lot
Society doesn't love grandpa 
Therefore fuck society 
Let's make grandpa's name go down in history because he was correct and they laughed at him
It was a major setup to explain why she's messed up and her motivations behind what she do
Because no person is... inherently evil
To humanize her a little
In reality it's just a big side story to explain why Takano is that fucked up
Wiki says unknown
So we don't know if the place still is in operation and if they are still abusive
Honestly thought how Elaina started every episode praising herself from a sort of third person perspective was hilarious
Nope, don't care, bye
Like a buncha flower zombies
"How can you just walk away from that???"
It was aggravating at first
After sleeping on it.
Definitely favorite part of Wandering Witch was how Elaina... is honestly flawed as a person. 
Way too much conceit and a little tiny bit absolutely full of herself 
How many times did she just walk away from a bad situation?
And honestly the "not my problem bye" attitude was... refreshing?
||https://youtu.be/jBDcA1-KYVg||
More like ||one fucking the other via uncensored handholding||
Fucking λδ
Plus, yeah having them essentially binge watch ||Higurashi for a few hundred years first and come to the conclusion of "That's a lot of damage, let's add some more" is just fucked up beyond human levels.||
||I find the cumulative guilt of our antagonist built up across those fragments to be greater than that of the crimes of Takano across any singular fragment.||
||Each separate fragment version of a character can't be held accountable for what they did in other fragments, but a being hopping between fragments holds the cumulative guilt of their crimes in those fragments.||
It's a case of... ||Takano did one bad in one fragment at a time, where Sotsu antagonist repeated their crimes for years across multiple fragments.||

rofl
Time travel is a bitch
Okay slightly less great time <:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089> 
But still great time 
Just a kinda heavy episode thats all
Yeah this is just a great time <:BernadettaComfy:684598340398219308>

I'm going crazy 
For some reason YuYuYu makes me think of Jojo

Awwwwwwww
That was a finale for season 2 of YuYuYu for sure
I guess Yuki can join Hibiki in the ||fisting god|| club

I'M PISSING ON THE MOON HOW DO YOU LIKE THAT OBAMA?!
Yes
...rite
I seem to remember something said along the lines of ||What will we do in a world without the Taisha? at the end of Yusha Chapter||
*Or fucking jump between being a prequel, sequel, and in parallel*
I think timelines only get cursed when arcs are inserted or run in parallel
||Didn't the Taisha appear before Tougou who was not wheelchair bound, thus proving the scene was definitely not before the completion of YuYuYu, meaning its not part of the current KuMeYu timeline, but since... well the Taisha exists... didn't they get turned into Eva brand tang in their ritual in Yusha chapter?||
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
||As it seems post Sonoko reintroduction, but I can't figure out if its post the end of the Yusha Chapter||
And I'm also sus of if the events we saw of the main cast in the first episode were mid Yusha Chapter
But thats read/watch order not chronological
*I guess I followed the arrow of shame*
I guess this is KuMeYu rn?
WaSuYu -> YuYuYu -> S3? -> Yusha Chapter -> S3????
So I was all "S4 WTF!?"
As I think of the current one as S3
I was thrown off
||Given Sonoko is back I couldn't quite place my finger on where "Airsoft war" falls on the timeline||
And S3E1 I was stuck trying to determine where in relation to S3b
Given they are both half-length and occupy one season
Ok technically what you call S2 and S3 are like S2a and S2b
Anything to further stroke her enormous ego
Elaina would totally have a collection of dolls of herself
Frederica is best part of 86
That was not in the novel IIRC
Yeet the child

Frederica ***YEET***
Fell behind by a week ~~too much FFXIV and other life duties~~
And I find YuYuYu has more... depth than Meduka had for me
YuYuYu is honestly really meduka meguca clone, but is really good regardless
YuYuYu is *chef's kiss*
I got lost in season 2 of FF
I had to toss in my "Not isekai isekai" as meme
Dr Stone

And I didn't even account for Stone Ocean
-1 episode that I managed to watch due to timing
Thats 5 shows over 5 weeks
So I have a backlog of 24 episodes to catch up on
Well I just realized that I haven't touched my anime in a month

My friend loves finding panels in random manga that say "one piece" and editing them to seem like they are talking about One Piece
I just end up internally dividing by 10 on every loss statistic lmao
The term "Decimate" originally meant a loss of 1/10th of the group
As the amount lost should likely lead to the legion steamrolling humanity
I just find the amount of lost resources to be unbelievable
It do be wack
Assuming they can recycle hard enough perhaps they could keep it up, but it's still a massive feat
The numbers thrown around at times are often too big
This is later where they... uhh...
||built a damn staircase out of suicidal units sacrificing thousands, and later talking about how they couldn't salvage from them because the legion had overrun that land||
That and where they can manage to replace all their mecha as readily and rapidly as they do, but are at such a lack of humans 
The supply chain of "how can a place supposedly running out of farmland to produce food continue to replace full war machines"
You can only say "half of the entire military was wiped out" so many times before I'm left questioning how this is even possible
If you halve the forces in one side of a battle of attrition, they are rendered almost a quarter as effective
My one problem I've got with the 86 novels... 
I feel like the losses suffered by humanity are too great
Just something about the delivery each time... its so... amusing
Every one of these I have to stifle my laughter at what is essentially another fetish rant by the author
Asato Asato once again being *cultured* in the author's notes at the end 
"Pilot suits are righteous!"
Just finished reading the 5th novel of 86
||Assaulting a geothermal plant with an annoying rogue Phönix on the loose||
How many times can you take "unrecoverable" levels of losses and then shrug it off like it never happened

Sometimes can fall from fucking orbit and survive 

And then you trip on a branch and die
Human durability is weird
> 13,500-foot, 20-second plunge
```A Virginia woman miraculously survived a skydiving accident after her parachute got tangled on her leg and she slammed into the ground at 125 mph.```
Just searched for parachute failure survivors
Humans are also... simultaneously fragile and near indestructible
And ||Mr Refuses To Die seemed to have inordinate amounts of luck, like some supernatural levels because of all the shit he survived. I remember the theory on the Alan Institute recognizing his uncanny luck/survivability as his gift... but ...yknow||
Yoink
||Chisato wanted to protect the others from the sadness of her own passing, believing her heart to still be failing. She also wanted to live her last bit of time having fun the Chisato way... and then the expiration date didn't arrive... but Takina arrived.||
So it's not like I got this from the LN or something
And... its anime original
That's what they tried to frame it as
||She just pulled a total Chisato.||
I'll respond to the last one.
||Chisato believed she was still going to die soon, so like a dying cat she retreated from others to save them from her passing... and then she didn't die... hey fun vacation time||
Plenty of loaded opinions woven into your "facts" there
