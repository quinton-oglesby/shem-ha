I'll give it a couple slaps , but I'm not to great against smoll Carol 
Maybe I can weaken her enough so other people join in though
I'll lend a hand <:KirikaSparkle:698939825876631714>
No problem! I hope it works out <:TsubasaJoy:688191716620238870> 
When you open a raid give me a ping maybe I can help out
Her, Shirabe , and the welfare Miku at a decent level should deffinitly be able to deal some damage I think
Oh yeah even at level 56 Shirabe could be really useful. What level is your ignite Kirika? 
You should deffinitly get that Miku , she is not a bad welfare at all
What level is Shirabe? She can deffinitly do the healer job.
Have you farmed up the welfare Miku from the event they have going right now? Beacuse she can do some work on that raid at level 60/70
What kind of hearts you have and what kind of healers? Beacuse with just a few I'm sure you can slap it enough to get people to join in I think
Who do you have?
