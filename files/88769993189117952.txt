<a:amiyaWave:638293995663130624>

Covid kinda broke my drawing will but now it's back so I touched up some stuff and actually want to finish these two peices now
So upon my recent break up I cracked open my sketchbook again and worked on some stuff I haven't felt motivated for in like a year-
Nice
Ooo
I got the Lego bonsai tree
*and do a couple more photos before they go in the bin*
Good thing I'm moving and need to protect them all anyways
*oh I haven't shared some of my customs in here, have i-*
I got the justice knight instead of Aegis
Still need to get a Valkylander and a Wodom
And 1 brown for some detail in the trunk of it
100 of those are in this set
<@!84811738653929472> yep
This thing is so cool
Lord the dragster is oversized

*I have had a very busy last two weeks but my yearly Lego car buying has started.*
like straight up this pair is just Female Kabuto and Gattack and its hilarious to me

the newest girl Titan is just girl Gattack
she does
yes
Such a weird and fascinating one compared to other Mecha kits and even girl kits
Latest kit build
ATK Girl Heracross
Nice!
Oooo!
Forgot how much fun the Sniper-II was
Last one for now





I got it and my new boy in, but u finished building the other lad first since the F90 will be painted partially
Also maaaaan that thing is pretty
iirc peeb limits 3 per, doesn't it?


*time for funny picture time with the DP cast*

these things are super cool but the **excessive** amount of Undergates makes me actually want to fuckin *scream.*
Finished my last ATK Girl

I love this kit a lot
Frame Arms Vulture:RE! (With a basic RE:White frame because the pre built ones suck.)
Nop
What 4 hours of sleep does to a mfer. Re:Rise based, og divers bad.
<:marioFacepalm:698668667407171605>
I forgot og divers wasnt called re:rise too
Wait. I'm a clown

Re:Rise s1 never felt like it had actually character development apart from Ayame (who was then sidelined after her arc)
Eeeeh
But the 00 Sky is still such a good design
Man. Re:Rise may have been awful

Now to just build the fourth one that came out for re:rise...
This feels really nice as a display
Finally got a normal 00 Sky after having both the other variants for... Way too long now
Finished up the last one- 00 Sky Moebius
I need a Saturnix and a Mercone and that's it
I'm almost done getting all the cores
Such a GOOD lad
EARTHREEEEEE
In the middle of packing stuff I remembered I hadn't ever shared this-  painted up Megami Device x AGA Aika! The gold I painted to be proper gold and I Redid her hair color- still proud of it
If it's a handle that broke or a peg a small drill to insert a new one and cement both halves together would work
Plastic cement is a much much better option
Not really, it's just a Mecha girl kit. I like them more for the girl + kick ass armor thing rather than some people and thinking with their other head <:kekW:782334443288657981>
I forgot how much fun the asra's were
Megami device Shadow Asra Ninja- my first kit since moving.

I absolutely adore this kit as much as I expected to


HG Battlogue Helios Gundam!
Ayameee
Such a GOOD lad
HG Gundam 00 Command Qan[T]

just things you learn over time and getting experience
even with proper building the wait of the Helios i just build is loose and needs floor polish to tighten it
at first i was awful at these things too
they are *model* kits, not action figures
just take your time with model kits


Gundam Base Core Set complete~
MG's usually don't do that
damn thats beautiful tho
Clear plastic model kits are usually fine
They've done An idw prime, Megs, roddy
Fairly clearly
IDW based

Honestly a really fun lad
Flame Toys Roddy


My command felt great to
Huh. All my battlogue kits were fine
I absolutely LOVE this kit so much

Dynazenon... Battle go!

Finally got my massive HLJ box which meant Spinatia Fenceer


Forgot how much I liked these kits
HGIBO Gremory


Boy am I happy with these

I've been messing about with customizing my Spinatios
Getting back into photography again is fun
I am very very very happy with how these photos came out- new Marvel Legends Retro Shocker~

Pretty damn happy with how it turned out
Painted up my first custom gunpla in a whiiiile
How's that ikaruga?
Ooo
> start spray painting my next paint project.
> add on set primed and ready for color
> The parts instantly just take the paint in one coat
 Bliss
Melty good
It is~
Yeah, never spray on the runners
Spray paint, I wish I had an airbrush set up
Very very happy with her


Just finished painting this up
The torso range is so good
Such a fun model kit


I was watching The Sea Beast on a whim, ye
Flame Toys Furai Model Windblade

Finished a new kit! And I'm super impressed!
I picked up some stuff at the con I went to this weekend, finally assembled them!
Ohh I didn't know it came wirh the cast off parts
Now that goldburn is painted, the shelf is done (for now)
<a:Watatatata:766451252900266024>
Finished painting Goldoburn

Painting the gold makes it utterly beautiful
TaJaDor is a very fun kit

Finished a new kit tonight! First in a while. The Humikane works Arsia from Koto. A very *very* fun kit to mess around with and pose.
Very happy with the haul I got from the Con

Clear Llfrith! From Gundam Base Texas
Feels real nice
Finally got a proper way to display my rider belts
Clunky? I don't remember mine feeling clunky
Now all I'm missing is Saturnix and I have all of Hiroto's suits
Core Gundam, Mercury Armor
Absolutely love these kits

Dubbed symphogear sounds eternally cursed
breh
i wish that TPN Season 2 wasnt god awful
Overall still like 'em
I watch HF1-2 and then 3 that weekend back in November? That it was in NA
Nyaruko is an amazing show

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gY4td8ikFaQ
Damn good show
Just finished Sk8
I snagged S2 and 3 on sale during Black Friday, but haven't gotten around to grabbing S1
Prillya looks dum fun
I need to watch PrIllya and Carnival Phantasm
Dynazenon episode 2 slapped
Very skeptical on how that's gonna go
Skeptical
forgot they announced that
the 00 Sequel
thats the next show
00-2
WAIT
OH
we know hathaways is movies, did they-
iirc the next *show* we're due.. i dont even know
well Build is on the back burner now because of Real sadly
<:RozaDeadInside:591098591863373835>
It's literally just that again
The original gundam trilogy movies were better than the show too
It's him redoing it pretty much
The show had problems being made
I mean
He said he thought it was way better than the show
Friend of mine saw the first and nt at... Anime NYC '19? I think?
Been hard to watch them due to Covid n such
The two out so far
Only heard good things about them
The g-reco movies have done a lot better iirc <@!99695384296701952>
33 times since between the various versions I have
It is
9 times total in theaters
I saw it uh
It's not
Where as most of trigger is amazing
BNA just felt aggressively okay
Girdman is a toku love letter
Burning Hearts was a lot of popular promare artists
Cute art book n little goodies well worth it <:UselessLewd:786353929176088586>
I went all in on the burning hearts zine
The only real merch I've gotten was supporting a Fanzine and the two blurays
I want to get more promare merch
<:KEKW:810333048016207922>
Is upside down
That strip
Legit

Idk why
It was assembled that way

<:UselessLewd:786353929176088586>
Steelbook, digital, and collectors edition
FranXX is just bad
simply because i simp Nana
im currently dragged two of my best friends through cross ange
didnt really click with me
i dint much care for that show tbh
and i love Rose

i love this show
two episodes in
okay
*reasons.*
Uh
For
I need to start that show
I need to watch s1 still
**I knew there was a reason I liked her**
Kaslana I mean-
Kallen is voiced by Nana?
Waif
better get more rinface content in solomon somehow
*I wouldve spoiler tagged that Dyna stuff too about ||Knight Kun and the second.||*
And oh- I was not aware of that with Sentouin and Konosuba
Not prequel at all I don't think. It's in the same universe, acts as a semi-sequel @ dyna
and iirc the author started this light novel after konosuba, didnt they?
shes more of a mixture of both Aqua and darkness
Didn't the game come out ages ago and it was shit?
I love it
I started Carnival Phantasm
Iirc he literally said he's never going back to Akane or that crew because their story is done
And because gridman
I watched because trigger
Dyna was a much more toned back show about 5 broken people and I kinda loved that
But I meant like, *broad strokes* with the pacing and tone
It is at it's core
Dyna was 100% a story about 5 broken people and their struggles- where as gridman was, well. Gridman and Toku shit. Both utterly beautiful and different, but man I love them both
Gridman and Dyna are both fantastic but for vastly different reasons
Imo
<a:AbbyHyperJump:742741205552463931> <a:AbbyHyperJump:742741205552463931> but YES MORE TANYA
I still need to watch the movie
YES
WHAT
Date a Live is popcorn fun imo
Yeee!!!
Is a genuine surprise
The fact Disney actually let these studios just go *off* and have fun
Even if the episodes are 10-15 minute shorts
It looks like so much fun
It looks so pretty

The only thing I don't like is that the dub cast is straight up "generic celebrity animated cast"
I'm super exicted for Visions
Almost baffling
The fact that the anime aired so early into the manga's run but is almost the exact same is
Yeah
Fun, short, nothing too deep. Felt like it was scared to take risks tho
Years of it just being half done in my watch list
So I finally finished Akuma no Riddle after like
<a:illyaPanic:393811760273948673>

Star wars Visions is ouuuut
Still one of the only shows and movies that make me tearup
Man
Who's bright idea was it to make demon Slayer S2 do Mugen Train again
Also

One of them made this
Showing them it for the first time
So I'm rewatching Fate Zero with some friends

Love her
https://tenor.com/view/sakurasou-mashiro-shiina-confused-gif-12693981
So I've recently started Sakura-Sou with a friend and I'm loving it so far
Demon Slayer goooood
Finally watched Mugen Train
Ernie is a very good boy
Ernie is good
Don't forget Blue Lock
very happy its as good as i expected
so i started Vivy with some friends
Sounded like it
I thought it was Isekai reincarnation
I'm loving every episode so far and it makes me excited for Friday's
The Legend of Vox Machina is amazing
its so goooood
and theyre *damn* good these days
they're fewer and far between- but we still get them
Vivy, Sk8 the infinity
we do get some nice anime original's still @ earlier
the Progressive LN is really nice
which really sucks
at all
didnt adapt it well
ive heard they
My favorite part of SAO overall is still GGO though ~~but im biased because i like Kino's journey and its that creator who did it~~
I agree, Rosario was good too
~~all i hear is Lord Briarwood now~~
started the second half of it now and i forgot Matt Mercer was in this dub too
Alicization is a pretty fun season so far and dare i say competently written
bad as SAO is
for as like
also ima be real
So it a 10
Subjectively? Idgaf because the show is still a very Important part of my life
Soul Eater's ending makes me wanna die cause the anime fucked it up
Like objectively?
Enjoy that shit and rate it whatever you value it as
If you enjoy it? Fuck the haters
One man's 5 could be another's 7, or 10
Soul eater is always a 10 to me despite it falling apart because it was my first anime
The other arcs? He's still a horrible character
This arc? This arc good.
I still think he's awful in anything outside of this arc
Hopefully Reki remembers that for the next arc of the LN
Was a fun watch
Alicization really did make him a genuine character
For as much as I hate SAO's first 2 seasons and it's handling of Kirito
So I finished watching SAO Alicization War of Underworld
Boy did that hit different
That hit different
So I just finished Mushoku Tensei
sure wish it was good
Pacifc Rim The Black certainly did have a second season
welp
I love Blue Lock so far
Man I love this manga
Finished chapter 150 of blue lock
The Wild Card thing so far is super interesting too, I really hope it gets more focus
*fuck* I'm excited for the anime adaptation
I am now entirely caught up on Blue Lock
I'm loving every bit of it
Fuuto PI is so good
But I am so happy
Did not expect them to get Unison Square Garden for the opening
https://youtu.be/g8iNMKef5MQ
LETS GOOO

It's so CUTE
I STARTED CATCHING UP ON THAT
OH MY GOD FINALY
Shit was so gooood
The new trigger show
Cyberpunk
Edgerunners made me cry
Yep
How in the world do those dots connect
I love Promare
How
That's
Not like the arcs were much longer than a movie in the first place
It makes sense
With Dreaming Girl they showcased how good the novels translate to a movie
It makes sense for rascal
I mean
I'm so excited for more rascal
<a:AmiyaRaveR:683338359300685885>

I almost cried in happiness because they started the night with their Flamenco opening. A song I never thought I'd hear them perform live
Tonight at Frontier we had the flow concert
Man
NOOOOO
VERY well imo
And it was done
Today was **the** Dabi episode
god *damn* today's MHA episode
I wish I had a partner like her
Golden time my beloved...
Season 2 of part timer was such a dissapointment
Finished rewatching entertainment district tonight. Feel very mixed on the ending upon that second rewatch
Very dumb fun fantasy show like Slime
