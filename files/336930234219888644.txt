does someone have the /a/ reaction chart for episode 5?
god i fucking love this show
not to mention the "put yo hands up da!"
as was the 119% thing
that car clone ninja technique was so hilariously Symphogear
hype hype hype hype hype hype hype hype
Where's the /a/ reaction chart?
That was Carol's voice at the end, right?
...so far
It might be hyperbole with how XV has been going, but I think this episode was genuinely the best episode of Symphogear ever
HYYYYYYYYYYYYYPE
HOLY SHIT MY DUDES
AAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHH
still havent seen ignite modules
lit

i wouldnt be to sure about that
this is why i need to learn japanese
i mean Gigguk mentioning Symphogear for 30 seconds as a joke was the most exposure we've ever gotten
we need Gigguk or some big youtuber to give Symphogear a full length feature video
yeah true nothing wrong but at the same time we are all suffering bc there's no one we can talk to about Symphogear outside the internet
i mean r/Symphogear just hit 2k subs
we are the definition of a rabid, niche fandom
lol we should feel bad for all non-JP Symphogear fans in general
FAULT_DATTO lmfao
thanks
where's the reaction chart for ep 8?
they had 0 lines in AXZ
the return of the Beef Stroganoff trio
you know what we really need in XV?
i guess i was too caught up in the hype to notice
dang i liked the ignite designs
oh right
when did that happen
