Through the application of the dark art known as "Computer Science", I have tapped into the Yggdrasil System and hacked it to provide us with some service. You can find out what it does (which isn't much) by typing ``3_help``. You are welcome to suggest new features in <#336299268107403274>! <:ElfneinPresents:691733046633955439>
And to commemorate the occasion, I have prepared a bunch of Shirabe pics for the birthday girl that everyone gets to enjoy. <:ChrisPresents:672578363176517642>
<:ChrisPresents:672578363176517642>
It's been more than half a year since my last update, but now I've uploaded more fanart to my image stash pinned in <#336297674707828747> . It's another 4000 files, putting the total at 56579, which represents 10 years worth of Symphogear fanart and shitposts. Enjoy!
<:ElfneinPresents:691733046633955439>
With the help of <@!263534352422404096> , I have added a new feature to <@!735757788331900931> . Now it can embed images from multi-image tweets. No longer will you have to rely on 2️⃣ -4️⃣ reactions to inform people on mobile of what's in a dense tweet.
(We also have stickers now in case you missed that.)

<@!139432096023183360> has been kind enough to continue work on the subs for Symphogear Live 2016 last touched by <@!253048261156405248> . Now the translations for the songs have been improved and all of the banter between the VAs has been translated as well. 

You can find this improved version here: <https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Q1Kh6SmyMSHWsayq8NsMgHfgQDH606ib/view?usp=sharing>

If you're interested in the subs of the 2013 & 2018 concerts by the translation group Undercover as well, Relative Dimension has collected all of those files and the new version of the 2016 subs here for easy access: <https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1AFEmxtnf9DuDbUu7t1ajHES2wk_VR_dH?usp=sharing>

This means that all of the commercially released concerts have recieved translations!
I got a good deal on storage, so my art stash will stay available for the next year until further notice. Expect monthly updates just like before. I'm up to over 30Gb of data and more than 50000 files, so go check out the pinned message in <#336297674707828747> for some Symphogear goodness! <:ElfneinAAA:672437636362665984>
After an incredibly successful initial release (barring the issue of sourcing gigantic images and .jpeg/.webp files), I have finally upgraded the Yggdrasil System. The new addition is a personality core based on Maria. This Maria-flavoured function channels the power of our resident Top Mom ( <:MariaSunglasses:336656798687690752>  ) in order to offer you uplifting and somewhat sappy life advice taken straight from the dark depths of Pinterest. I also added a help command for keeping track of the custom commands Elfnein has. No longer will you have to forget what the timeline command is. As before, you can use ``3_help`` to check out the patch notes. Enjoy! <:ElfneinPresents:691733046633955439>
It finally happened. I've used up all my free online storage for storing Symphogear fanart (and reaction images). All 30 GB of it. <:ElfneinTrip:688025973932687377> 

As such, this will be my last update to my stash until I can pay for more. Still, **48788** pics isn't half bad, right? <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720> 

You have about 52 days (heh) to download before my storage bonus runs out, at which point half of it will go away and I'll probably put stuff on rotation according to requests. I'll put out a reminder later in case you don't download it immediately. But you should really do that! 

I've put my heart and soul into this collection (not to mention my awesome sorting strategies), so don't let this opportunity pass you by. You deserve this package of Symphogear goodness! <:ElfneinAAA:672437636362665984>  

I don't know what else I can say to give you FOMO, so here's the link: <https://mega.nz/#F!TYMhCQSI!r2kxLEdSAZheFJ1O6XZr5w>

Enjoy! <:ChrisPresents:672578363176517642>
It is finally the most wonderful time of the year, where we eat anpan and spaghetti to honor the birth of Symphogear's gift to mankind. May your faces be messy and may the bakas of the world stay their hands, if only for a moment. Amen. <:ChrisPray:672578403156885504> 

 **MERRY CHRISMAS, EVERYONE!** <:ChrisPresents:672578363176517642>

Does she do anything now, besides greetings?
Ahh.
Oh yeah, do you take suggestions for Ryoko commands? I want something silly, like /genocide or /jii.
Yeah, no need to gamify conversation.
Aren't upvotes on the Reddit enough?
Saki was thinking about a cool-down command, but I think Alice wants art sourced.
Kiri-chan should play non-stop Christmas songs during the holiday. Her song especially. You'd like that, right? <@431656503490117632>
Well, RIP this channel until New Year's Eve.
See? <:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
They obviously want more <:HibikiPadoru:516438720082346004>  in the server.
Maybe the sub doesn't support New!Reddit?
You can't expect things to work out without putting in the effort, Alice.
Good point. But you could apply restrictions.
The spring weather has made people horny on main. Perhaps that could be channeled into some writing prompts?
It is also the only one. <:HibikiWhoops:585839808115507222>
Best VN I've played outside of Ace Attorney. <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>

This is great, Lily! <:BikkiOhNo:586337444597596202>
Fuck yeah. <:ElfneinWeld:586027421296492585>
I think someone has a cutout of that.
Shock? Realization?
Crop it. <:ChrisOi:586551700987576330>
Wait for BDs. <:HibikiBlep:605209109284782090>
calm down
That's a command.
That sounds neat.
If anyone wants to spend more than 25 seconds on <:KirikaPanic:644220753457184789> , here's the source:
Good job then, I just got a bit confused.
Oh, ok. <:HibikiWhoops:585839808115507222>
Don't we need artist permissions, or are padorus free game?
Not having a hobby or a sleep schedule. <:ShiraBean:661294258795446326>
Oh hey, Miku found the banhammer. <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Looks like official art.
Better you make it yourself than to steal. <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I wanna check the scene I have in mind first.
<:ShirabeConcern:586404485598019604>
Also, some more Quality emotes would be fun.
Like, from your pfp.
Hey, wouldn't Elsa growling work as an emote? <@237964037898502144>
XV villains too.
We're pretty good on DMJii currently. I was thinking more Tsubasa or AXZ villains.
Any specific characters I should look for "raw material" for?
This might be workable.
Fujitaka could do with some representation.
This might be croppable:
Or did we even have it here to begin with? <:HibikiWhoops:585839808115507222>
Is it worth it to re-add this?
Neat, more slots. I should do some digging for some more.
<:ShirabeToast:672245704118501376>
That'll be a nice surprise in the morning, Lily. We can work on the less represented characters tomorrow.
Whatever gives us more emotional coverage. <:ShiraBean:661294258795446326>
I was gonna post more, but it's late, so I'll save the other ones I thought of. <:HibikiWhoops:585839808115507222>
I have these crops already:

...shit, I should look through the XDU art as well. <:KirikaPanic:644235681677180958>

These are croppable:
Might be too lewd, but still funny:
Any of these strike your fancy? <@!106866895076003840>













All right, time to deposit some potential emotes. <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
But process first, decisions can come later.
I'm for yoinking the :MillaarcHeart: Ikxi posted, if that's ok.
Care to help with some cropping experiments? <@!237964037898502144>
Oh wait, maybe this Kanade:
Seen anything you like? I think I'm done unless someone has anything special in mind. <@!106866895076003840>


And then maybe one of these:



Wait, might be too wide. <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
My vote goes to this:












Ok, last up, Tsubasa:
I'd rather have the Millaarc one though.


I wonder if any of these could work:
Second one especially.
...those are good too.


That was the NR stuff, might as well post the Fudou stuff too.
<:ShirabeWink:672661604319363103>
...open the episode and take a full screen screenshot?
Look at this, it's huuuuge. <:ShiraBean:661294258795446326>
Wait, that's some shoddy resolution, I might as well update that one since I have the episode open.

Millaarc being a punk:
Similar to <:VanessaCracked:639136452600397829> , but maybe:
You could crop the top of this:
This was the growl face I was thinking about earlier:
All right, finally time for some NR and Tsubasa suggestions. <:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
<:ShirabeToast:672245704118501376>
Pretty good spread.

<:MariaNo:672658725986762764>
Try it. I'm out of suggestions for now. <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>






Ok, I found some AXZ ones:
Ye.
<:ChrisBored:672575526346424351>
Ehh, barely readable.
Inline then? <:ElsaGrowl:672840641214021644>
Yeah, not a top choice, though it kinda works.
Who in their right mind would remove Hibikis?
Still, once these are done, I'm kinda out of ideas. Maybe some more AXZ stuff?
Melua just added them since there was space. Otherwise, we'd keep like 2 out of season.
<:CarolYandere:424047704826707980>
We can always axe the Padorus.
<:MikuPraise:585839808765493249>
Woo!
<:MillaarcV:672845837520338944>
The top left pixel bothers me here:
Woo. <:MikuPraise:585839808765493249>
<:ElfneinAAA:672437636362665984>
You can't use her to solve puzzles, only for somen cooking.

<:KirikaChant:663568587310628892> <:MikuDelete:661660028410920990>

Lily is cleaning up a few, so you can rest a bit.

But Melua just added these: <:HibikiAwe:688397678572339230> <:MikuCry:688397678584791074> <:HibikiPing:688397678421344268>

~~You have no idea how many files I have to name in a month.~~
<:FujitakaScared:672430483702939659>
Ohhh.
I don't know which one you're referring to. <:KirikaShout:607741871703457812>
Ohhhh.
What was it?
<:HibikiAwe:688397678572339230>
What does our resident Elsa fanboy say? <@!237964037898502144>
I think. <:HibikiThink:688429715362414641>
<:HibikiAwe:688397678572339230>
That's almost a size increase of 10%!
That would make it a few percent bigger, right?
No, I meant the few pixels of body.
<:ElsaChef:689030206144381009>
Hmm, would it look better with just the head?
We could do with one more Elsa. <:TsubasaUpset:672861878703357968>
~~I swear it's not just because I do cooking in <#407060923078017026> .~~
I looked over my avalanche of emote ideas and I wanna push this some more:
I wanna see both of those without the body. And the SG one without the side hair. More in the <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720> direction.
Do it while we still have the slots. <:Cag:423197445644615711>
Best rewatch all of AXZ then. <:ElfneinWeld:586027421296492585>
For <:Germain:421434126856486912> , that is. I need rep for my rank.
Oh hey Mizu. Got any other suggestions?

Not sure if she has any other good faces. <:ChrisBored:672575526346424351>
While we're at it, I want another SG. I think the head here could work: https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/336299268107403274/688296454053429278/saint_germain_chibi_bikini.png
"Oi mate, Imma shank you this instant if you don't stop."

<:ElsaChef:689035502673985622>
Yes, but:
More Elsas. <:ElsaSmug:688429724443213903>
I'm sensing a pattern here.
There's gonna be so much pruning later.
<:TsubasaFish:689163064830066696>
Yes, like the most important of all emotions: Fish
<:CarolYandere:424047704826707980>
*For now.*
But more Elsa. <:ElsaChef:689035502673985622>
Nay, I think. The hand looks off when cropped.
How about this? <:ElfneinPresents:688429721998065680>
The chin pixels bother me, but otherwise it looks good. <:GenjuurouThumbsUp:336657189475188740>

That's fine. <:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
Imma look over the OVA...
Good luck. <:KirikaSalute:620069889838809089>
I think that works.
Can we salvage this face?
I think he's out.
(Pleasy excuse my hasty erasing.)

Hmm...
Cut off just the body then.
To be deleted. <:MikuDelete:661660028410920990>
Focus on the ones you're confident in first, Lily.
Sounds like it's already time to <:MikuDelete:661660028410920990>
Got that one ~~stolen~~ cropped already.
DMJii alter being gay for DMJii normal.
<:Germain:421434126856486912>
Scour all the 4komas for new emotes!
Rady pls
It's a bit weaker than <:ShirabeCry:671887081026617345> and not as good as <:ElfneinPalm:672430572961923092>

Who could that be?
<:Germain:421434126856486912>
I like the Kanades and the Hibiki and Miku if they can be cropped properly. That Elsa is a bit too similar to:
<:CarolSmug:617040484111745027>
Smug anime girls make the internet go around.
Seems fine to me, I don't see the problem. <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
<:MariaWink:688836868736811148>
Why wouldn't I know when you talked about it in here? <@203444794737950720>
I don't art, but it caught my eye just now. <:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
It looks like it has a broken brush stroke, yes.
Less sass, more useful opinions. <:MariaNo:672658725986762764>
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
Does the mouth here look off to anyone else?
<:KirikaShout:607741871703457812>

Nevermind then. <:HibikiWhoops:585839808115507222>

Hey Rady, mind doing the math on our DMJii percentage now?
Don't put me on the spot like that, Matt. <:KirikaShout:607741871703457812>
Yes, we know Zababa is your god, Melua. <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
<:TsubasaShock:689705053401251867>
I think you got one of those from somewhere else.
Guess I'm sold on swapping them. <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
<:ShemHaSmile:688429721758990545>
And the other one:
Hmm, looks better on phone.
Oh well, I've gotten to keep other emotes that only I use. <:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
I still miss it. Just a bit. <:FujitakaSalute:688199574917087256>
Explore that idea in <#357682999300718592> , Allison. <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
~~Also, people ship everyone with Ver for a laugh and cause chaos.~~
Yeah, and I'd like it to stay that way.
We try to stop shipping wars, so I don't think it's a good idea.
*You say hi to people in <#368973801561653253> and remain active, that's good enough.*
~~But if you can clean up some of the newer emotes, that'd be great.~~
~~We have most bases covered, don't feel bad.~~
These belong more in <#407060923078017026>
Doesn't look emotive enough, even at that size.
No idea. Need to do some more research. <:CagliostroSmile:672861875385401344>
The rest is a suprise. Hopefully a good one.
For now, Elfnein does the basics.
*our bots?
Thanks, Aria.
Sadly, we're not there. <:MillaarcDone:689395768980668416>
In an ideal world, I'm allowed to give you a warning for that. <:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
Vetoed. <:CagliostroSmile:672861875385401344>
That sounds like work. <:MariaWhat:672245553920344080>
<:HibikiSmug:672655850518609940>
Careful Rady, you got her to reject a DMJii-centric suggestion.
No, cut the left one!
At any rate:
<:HibikiScreech:633468460030230548>
YUS!
Give it some more time.
Rady, you're illiterate. <:YumiPoint:688429724103344164>
Pretty sure I did.
Done. <:CagliostroSmile:672861875385401344>
Noted.
No. No to that.
<:MariaScared:672584661125431299>
It's on a VPS. We'll probably migrate Elfnein there too.
That's just silly.
But now everyone knows and we can't do that. <:ShirabeConcern:586404485598019604>
<:YumiPanic:688429717174354012>
Elfnein should be able to do it, but she's offline.
If it could, I'd be concerned, seeing as I didn't code that function.
<:ShirabePout:336656831978012712>
I don't think I'm gonna like this.
<:KirikaMegane:585848185847676939>
But it's so good.
<:MariaChuckle:672465496515411984>
I'm not gonna help you cover your failures.
<:KirikaScared:672584678993297431>
I feel like I'm fighting against entropy here, but it's DMJii emotes.
Here:
<:HibikiFingerguns:688429715836502063>
I noticed.
But yeah, that's nifty. <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I'm here too. <:MariaDefeated:688429716780089397>
<:ShirabeStare:582381430915596289>
I can discuss with the other mods and make a deletion hierarchy should it be necessary. <:TsubasaNote:689554460044820608>
Our emotes are so good they give you choice paralysis. <:KirikaCheer:689614085402525830>
It used to be more popular, but then the server ascended.
It's official, Symphogear is just too good for Discord to handle. <:CagliostroSmile:672861875385401344>
<:MariaScared:672584661125431299>

Rady pls, we already have like 60 DMJii emotes. <:KirikaShout:607741871703457812>
Official material for one. Stuff that's unique and looks good in-line.
*Lexi, emotes are so hard to pick. Those were the best we found.*
What about some helpful suggestions? <:CagliostroSmile:672861875385401344>
Quite.
I might have something else fun in the works though. <:MariaWink:688836868736811148>
I'm not dabbling in a sound interface on my free time! <:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
Nope. I think Elfnein has the functionality, but it'd sound like crap on my current hosting plan.
That doesn't sound interesting in the slightest. <:TsubasaNeutral:688429723205894149>
Well, fun has been implicitly banned up to this point. <:MariaSpy:688429716104806412>
Got some ideas that may come to fruition.
Didn't. Past tense. <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I'll have you know I'm highly educated! <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
No? <:HibikiWhat:336656482907193344>
~~A shame a have a coding test to do.~~
Suggestion ignored. <:CagliostroSmile:672861875385401344>
<:ChrisWave:738169593574719568>
Yeah, so suggest all the animated emotes you want.
<:ElfneinWeld:586027421296492585>
<:GarieOhYeah:688429715769262187>
You just want better quotes to save to pull out when you're bored at work.
We already have <:TsubasaBliss:672861879000891432>
<:HibikiThink:688429715362414641>
Huh. Maybe it got swept away in the tidal wave of function disabling Lily did.
Do you remember? <@!106866895076003840>
Correction: I *am* that petty, but this is a public server full of Americans and it'd be very rude to do so.
There are ones talking about the sunglasses and swimsuit.
That'd work. ~~Ignoring the fact that there are messages referencing the normal picture.~~
Needs to be official or have the artist's permission. <:KirikaActually:688433197402554423>
Hit me with them then.
Elfnein has metric conversion somewhere. And I'm not petty enough to make it "correct" people using imperial.
I went through a lot of effort to make the Maria function full of diverse messages, but if anyone wants to add more to it for v0.3, you can make suggestions here. <:MariaSunglasses:336656798687690752>
I like the Carol.
Looks good. <:ShirabeToast:672245704118501376>
I think it looks fine. <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
I mean the one in the speech bubble. You only need to rotate it.
Also, damn it all, the dizzy Kirika from the comic is also good, but we already have <:SerenaDizzy:736605371912945736> : https://wiki.poweris.moe/images/d/d9/Special43_comic.png
Gah, I can't let any of those go. <:ChrisShock:620077681484103680>
Discord, give us more slots. <:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
That doesn't look official. Is it?
I'm in...err...on bed right now. <:TsubasaUpset:672861878703357968>
Ayanein! <:MichaPoint:738234743115743292>
So just follow the link and pray. <:ChrisPray:672578403156885504>
But it's somewhat unreliable, hence "no direct source found".
That's what the backup search is for, yeah.
<:KirikaApproval:586957465552158720>
Works in-server on desktop for free.
~~Could always add it as a hug command for Elfnein.~~
<:YumiPanic:688429717174354012>
**percieve symphogear**
Good luck shrinking this then.
I mean, the patch notes never coincide with new features.
Yesterday?
Thank you, Discord, for letting cheapasses have some fun.

(Channel bloat is our greatest enemy on the mod team.)
Then you could just wait a bit, right? People go on graphics card tangents from time to time, but it's not exactly a common occurrence.
I'd suggest doing a lot of stuff in DMs that isn't suited for the server.
(As I said before, take your time to relax.)
<:KirikaPog:605209108827734017>
And you can read!
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
We could give people channels for everything under the sun, but then it's not much of an anime server, is it?
~~Also, channel bloat, dear god the channel bloat.~~
I think it was more that we don't want to encourage venting.
Haven't you made this suggestion before?
But I'll take it up with the others.
I get your perspective, but we have to put our foot down somehwere. This is allegedly supposed to be an anime server.
Sounds plausible. I seem to recall Pixiv being uncooperative when it comes to direct links to images though.
How would you imagine this working?
Care to elaborate? <@331908049822547978>
~~And don't be a moron online.~~
Live and learn. <:YumiPoint:688429724103344164>
<:ElsaSmug:688429724443213903>
Yeah, like a free lunch.
Nitro scam spam in most channels. A user got hacked.
<:CagliostroSmile:672861875385401344>
Did she?
<:KanadeBlush:672455329451343882>
Leave that to Shem-ha.

<:MikuDelete:661660028410920990>
ANY MORE!?
If I missed deleting some spam, let me know.
Done.
You know what, fair.
<:MikuDelete:661660028410920990>
All right, time to raise the hammer.
<:TsubasaNeutral:688429723205894149>
Is this a scam?
<:HibikiWhoops:585839808115507222>
Shame. Also, we've misused this channel for long enough. Back to <#336297387863703552>
<:HibikiDab:688190074395164696>
Please, English is terrible on both sides of the pond.
Is it really that much of a problem? <:ShirabeConcern:586404485598019604>
<:ChrisBored:672575526346424351>
I'm running in NodeJS, so that's not helping, but there are other libraries. It seems they changed the API in an annoying way this February though.
<:HibikiThink:688429715362414641>
I'm not sure about that. Direct links to Pixiv images don't work, so I'd need to process them after doing a page scrape. Which seems very resource intensive and difficult.
They're like 30 minutes per season.
Wanna do one episode a week from then?
January **6th**
<:YumiPoint:688429724103344164>
We do have the 10-year anniversary coming up.
Headpat
Wait, we weren't gonna do that? <:ChrisShock:620077681484103680>
<:TsubasaAngry:692141154531016765>
And yes, Pixiv requires an account to view full images or NSFW galleries, plus a visit token to view direct links. Hence why you need API access.
*sorting
May I suggest downloading and sortimg images you like? <:YumiPoint:688429724103344164>
This is not the channel for shenanigans, ok?
It's called being "Morally Gray".
Hot war criminals have that effect on people.
<:TsubasaNeutral:688429723205894149>
I'll probably find something in a week. You should follow my example.

Here's a suggestion for <#384870333620027403> : Post something funny from time to time. <:KirikaActually:688433197402554423>
Give it a day. Fads die quick death's most of the time.
Haven't we reached some form of saturation? I don't wanna deal with a verification layer.
What is this "New Reddit" you speak of? <:KanadeSmile:672455286392356884>
I think the sidebar link is gone by now, but we should probably do that.
Yeah, we kinda separated from the subreddit.
...is that not what has been discussed, Kanade?
I gave up on participating in long Geah discussions years ago. <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Ban and delete, until it is done. <:MikuDelete:661660028410920990>
Same link?
My evil clone is the evil clone for a reason. <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
So, did anyone want to put themself forward for modship?
The evidence is there. <:OgawaRead:688429716507721770>
Then that's a no from me. <:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
No idea who you are, but we can start a discussion. <:OgawaRead:688429716507721770>
Thanks, I'll forward that to the others.
<:CagliostroSmile:672861875385401344>
Gonna extrapolate on your credentials and willingness to do difficult work?
<:GermainAngry:689199996653928451>
Animals should know their place!
Sounds like someone needs to eat their greens. <:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
<:CagliostroSmile:672861875385401344>
My spite against shitassery on Twitter knows few bounds. The next step is to get these people to eat grass.
I think they're pretty harmless ( <@99695384296701952> might think otherwise) and I'm glad to have someone be a magnet for this stuff so I know what to block.

THAT'S 3 CHRISES, 3 KIRIKAS, ONE SHIRABE AND ONE HIBIKI MORE TO ADD
OK
<:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
*Why is there another Hibiki roleplayer? And why does it link to multiple Chris roleplayers?*

I think so.

Elfnein does her best.
I don't know how complex that'd be. Haven't looked at role manipulation.
No. That's just boring. Doing boring things isn't against the rules.
Maybe this is an opportunity to formulate another discussion thread. <@99695384296701952>
She did? <:HibikiWhoops:585839808115507222>

But I'll stick around, gotta go now though.
Not sure I have the stomach.
I feel like I should've joined here earlier.
Aww.
Do you have a **GENOCIDE** command?

I have a bunch of screengrabs if you need them.
I'm doing EVERYTHING.
I'm like halfway through all the Symphogear art on Pixiv. It's gonna take a bit.

It's the big bad of AXZ. Saki wanted her to see all characters before joining.

Hi Elise!
<:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>

I'm curious about the result. Do keep us posted.

It's fine.
<:HibikiShock:336656371611074580>

I see no Geah colour on you.

Oh, I know about this weeb. The Symphocast was fun!
(And it's actually fair, but there's no actual use for the cards. A fair trade.)
Maybe try out our bot gacha.
Pick a Geah colour.
Be nice.

Don't try to speak their language, you'll only encourage their debauchery.

More people for the choir.
You're just in time. The preview of season 5 is out! <:Germain:421434126856486912>
Huh, that was quick.
<:MariaConfident:336657338729627658>
Inviting people to the cause is fine too.
This whole rewatch thing was a good idea. <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Not a day goes by where we don't get new people, it seems.

Why not celebrate by picking a colour?

Ehh...
<:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
There. Anyone else?
















Hmm...
That's all I have. Anyone else?













Can do!
Ok, someone choose a Symphogear character/duo/trio and I'll post a bunch of art later.
Tsubasa's could be「The Sentinel」, from the Judas Priest song.
Hibiki's could be 「Beat Boy」or 「Resounding Beat」.
I invite everyone to offer Stand names.




















































































Let's just see how many you can take.
Of just Chris and Tsubasa?
Everything? <@!284390402210136064>

Loads!
Sorta.
I was sorta banking on something sorta possible.
I surrender...
That against da rules?
A decent chunk of mine is. Sadly not Twitter stuff.
Give me like another year.
Once I'm done mining my sources, I'll compile it.
Don't think I can be arsed to post all of it.
Let's see...
Not that much, she ain't Chris popular.

Fine.
But she had a bad day...
I do that for the most part, but sometimes the art outweighs the lewd.
Well, I'm up to about 7500 of just Symphogear stuff. <:MariaSunglasses:336656798687690752>
That still garners 3000 images?
<@!284390402210136064> Your phone is already dead.



























Nerds, the whole lot of you.
Can't you sing Testament instead?
Is Chris also a Tomato?



You're not on the mod list, are you?
I'll zip when it's good and ready, dammit.
Remember kids, never forget your...
Ok, that was the quick tour.

Not some highlights?
All right, HibiMiku...
Very samey.
Man, sorting Kirika art is impossible.
Ok, I found some lewd...noises. Where does that go?
Maybe. I can't pick.

She might be in trouble.
Remember to feed your ZENBU loads of spaghetti.

Have ZENBU.
Thanks anyway.
Ehh, I think I'll have to decline. Saturday be busy.

Fun?
Gonna take a while.

Gotta mine Pixiv, steal from like 18 Twitter accounts...
But I wanna cover my bases beforehand.
Well, that was a goal in joining the Reddit.
Get. On. My. Level.
Behold!
Always a pain.
Yare yare daze.
Because other people don't use my awesome sorting system.
Screw it, back to Pixiv!
Just gotta sort a good 500 images still.
This is so much fun.
Bless their heart.
I only posted the one Zwei Wing cat image.
(someonepleasehelpme)
Get on my level.
Those were 474 + 39.
Y'all better show some appreciation by sharing more of your stuff as well.
https://drive.google.com/open?id=1cVoQNoBm2Xw4LmzSy53psBpnpfb9FDlB

Seems like I need an account. Can we do G Drive?

What makes you say that?


Hello, new mortal foe.

I try to downplay the accent as much as possible.
Swede.













Context is king, people.
Stay strong.
Doesn't help that they collect stuff in bunches as well.
Fun fact: Once I got to GX, the amount of good stuff per page went up.
I have like 180 pages of Pixiv left.
Gotta compare and sort later.
That one stood out.
No there were a few.
This one was new.
Madness.
>not pure basa pics
We shall see.
Yoink!
There are probably a few. Need to sort in smaller categories.
🤔
On the one hand, I lose my stuff. On the other, anime would partially be real.
What repeats, btw? <@279341087494242304>
Most images have similar traits!
Sorting Bikki in the Gear is my worst nightmare.
<@279341087494242304> I'm glad you liked it. Sadly, the sorting isn't final yet.
Aww.

F-forbidden?
It has ZENBU. <:ChrisSmile:336656717553074176>
**CONTINUE**
The show in a nuthsell.
Got music, combinations and all.
There's a even an episode you could misstake for Symphogear!
<:MikuBliss:336657233712513024>
The problem is that most of the images are just normal and I need more folders.
I go Bikki->Gear and then whatever folders I have there, like white backgrounds, X-Drive or Edge!Bikki.

And even that doesn't split them up much.





All I've come up with is how much of her body is visible.





Someone tell me how the hell I can sort these.




Ye.
Fangs are also pretty lethal.

Verily.
Ye.
Miku is more of a cat girl than a dog girl.
But since I'm here.
Must be Twitter.
Crud, I don't have a source either.
Shopping purple underwear?
Good boy. <:KirikaGay:336657049540755457>
It's so nice to be up to date on an image gallery. I only need to peruse like two pages a week.





Nope! Not posting that one. <:MariaShock:423196877354303498>
People, be careful what you wish for.
Hey, new Cags.



I'll repost the good ones.

The Gears don't deserve such treatment.

I was so glad when I figured out the Pixiv filter.







Hehe...

What did cancer ever do to anyone?
Can't forget all the lovely insults people sling.
GOOD
Really?!
Gotta suffer for the art of shitposting, I suppose.
They also called Maria "Slavic titty monster".
Hopefully, we may never know.
They want her impregnated. By someone, anyone.
I may or may not lurk on 4chan, dodging the horrible things they say about Aoi Yuki, just in the name of shitpost material.

Freaky.

Maybe Idolmaster.
Would make good anime.
Did Love Live ever explore the dirty underbelly of the idol industry?
But yeah, it's a freaky system.

I don't have a problem. You have a problem. And that problem is a lack of Symphogear on your harddrive.
Up to 7796 now. <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
It's a curse. But a good one.

Fuck me, I've been at this for hours and I still have 492 images to sort. And I'm only on page 122 on Pixiv.

That's my biggest commodity!
I assumed it would be much wackier.
Got videogames to play.
Keeping up with anime is beyond me.
2016?
Chronological. I meant that i didn't understand the love of the show, aside from how unique it is.
I didn't understand Haruhi. It was way more subdued than I thought.
Waiting for XV?
It's pronounced **SUFFERING**, thank you very much.
Ai desu yo?
I guess I gotta contribute too.
Pics in general?
Don't tempt me!
What a world we live in.
Oh yeah, Tail Blue is flatter than Tsubasa!
<:MikuGay:336656810788388864>

Don't you dare ping me. *wink wink*
All right, time to be productive!
Zany official art is dope.

I also make some crops.
Gayness for days.
Most of it.
I just want it, ok?
Twitter? Probably not. But the image galleries aren't that bad.
Am I an idiot?
And even then, I use a bit of the time when downloading to do prelimenary sorting.
And something tells me that the way Pixiv posts are constructed doesn't gel with how you'd write a bot.
But internet coding is awful.

Pic count updated, currently at page **142** on Pixiv, **1106** images left to sort.







Maria would do well acting more like an adult.


Gimme dis spinoff.

And it's paired with the G dress. It's like they're  trying to be lost in a sea of other pictures.

Another day, another image of Chris in a bunny suit.

(Bikki is such a dork.)

Pardon mah lingo, sistah.
For the "pwnd" thing?
But Pixiv is a resource hog.
Hence why it's nicer on that front.
Now we need KanaCloud.
Tomatoes?! <:MariaConfident:336657338729627658>

Those are good.
I only do by request.
Oh yeah, pinging brings the merchandise.

Appreciated Ibu. But for all that is good and proper, move to using folders.
``Final sorting has been delayed until further points of comparison for Symphogear items have been claimed``
``Assorted items have a focus on Yuru Camp, K-on and Konosuba``
``Progress is steady and the items denoted Symphogear are getting contained``

Yay, I found the Miku Gungnir pic I was looking for. <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>

(Use some folders, you dense bastard.)
Eh, keeps it interesting.
``1465 pieces of Ibu's power remains to be collected``
Curses, it's probably not sorted yet. <:ChrisAngry:336656958272700417>

No. I like your art.

How about Pig Iron?
This is a nice sword.

Add Chris to the "alternative" GX title card.
Together, we make good civilazation.
But you can just ask in case you need a fix.
Eyy.
Oh yeah, in case it wasn't clear, we of the green names deal in images.
Aww, only had one more.
Don't break my combos! <:MariaYell:336657352264646657>

Hey, it's late over there!
Still, we need a proper Valkyria Gear.
<:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
***BIG FIST**
Swansong of the Valkyries: Symphogear
I always forget about the full title.
Symphogay is always relevant.
^case in point

**SUNSHINE**
Start of AXZ and GX could also work.
My idea is that we evangelize about the show's strengths: SUNSHINE, SUFFERING, Explosions, Madness, Music and so on.
**NANA VULT**
NANA VULT
GOOD
Warmed my heart.
I was inspired by Ibu's post on r/wholesomeyuri
We're still planning, but X-posting to subreddits and having a rewatch before XV seems like the plan.
Also, here:

SG would make for a good banner.

Obviously the Custodians will hate the Geahs due to their affiliation with Finé.


Nah, SUNSHINE is only 135 of those.

ガングニールを纏った場合どうなるかを、オリジナル要素をなんとなく組み込んで描いてみた。
見たかったものと違ったらすまない。

I have many cards without the borders though, as they've been randomly posted on 4chan.
Doesn't seem to be any XDU assets though...
They start each thread with some links.
Mega. It's a hosting site.

Watched a bit of NCS yesterday, and he is sooooo upbeat.
Same, but they're so genuine.
Oh, and the RunawayGuys.
Still, it's fun that there's one decent big LP group out there.
...maybe I've watched too much.
Is it? I'm not even deep into the lore, since I don't listen to the podcast.
There's the Punisher wannabe, the whitest black man ever born and the soon to be immortal toilet.
They're all shit in their own awesome ways.

Heh.

Or just carry her in general because it looks funny.
It's cloudy, but still waaaaaaaaaarm.
Yes, but if you wanna bridge the context gap, post it in the same channel.
The context is barely there, hence my confusion.
...you mean in another channel using the example for a genre I didn't mention.
<:HibikiWhat:336656482907193344>
Much like this what?
Danbooru.
But yes, getting more art of yours on a booru would be good. It's like free advertising. <:Kiricoin:495336831978569759>
Pixiv is good too, if only for the names certain tags have.
Yes, which goes back to my earlier comment on Twitter being trash for art posts.
Look at all the tagging they did for you. <@106866895076003840>
It's really cute. <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Behold, the one piece of Lily's art deemed worthy to be put on a booru site. <:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
And you post on Twitter, so they use your Twitter tag thingie.
That means your art is good enough for the Internet™.
<:HibikiOhNo:586337444597596202>
There people tag for you. <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Well, you've appeared on boorus, if that's any consolation. <:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>

<:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
~~Now if everyone on Twitter could just shut up and the artists moved to Pixiv, that'd be great.~~
Good. For as bad as Twitter is an an art platform, it is even worse for communication. <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>

Having two Maria-holics is pretty entertaining.
Also, how have you two not collaborated on a fanfic yet? <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
The site is https://ascii2d.net so people know. Works pretty well.

Oh right, this was yours: https://twitter.com/Ranea_42/status/1155399265533026304
Oh yeah, can you post some of your art, Raneaa? I think I've only seen the buff Maria you drew over.
You're gonna do that to Maria, Raneaa?
I bet it's the hair that draws in artists for the challenge.
*There are a lot of good Kanades*

As for the drawing part, you only need to practice for like 9 years. <:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
Sorry, fictional tummy. Provide your own.
Hit that gym and floof that hair! <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Nice to see the fandom still post good Kanades after 7 years.
Ye gods. <:CarolShock:430939013235474432>

No really, you can't stop her.
Fanon Kanade is a woman who knows she cannot be stopped.

Either you need more frills, or less frills. Do the math.

Yes.
20 pages of dupes in my unsorted folder. <:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>

I assume you're going through the Hibiki tag.
I only follow the full, so I miss the ones only posted under the partial one.

How new is that? <:TsubasaYareYare:407397617451139073>
It's a tool, so of course.
I imagine there is some clique bollocks behind the scenes, like on wikipedia.
Boorus are nice.
It has the Amou Kanade tag.
You gotta add a "Multiple Costumes" folder later. <:GarieWink:336657101273169921>
Yes.
Shirabe can't deal with new pieces.
Quite fresh, yes.

Hey. <@!247701824335904770>


I'm the one you ask for art. <:HibikiWhoops:585839808115507222>
I have braids. I have sailor fukus. But not both at the same time.

I'm not done fixing up my Marias, this might take a bit. <:ElfneinBullying:421432763078410241>

Was it this?
Just gimme a minute...
Wrong one, but HAT! <:MariaYell:336657352264646657>

*A lot of very similar looking Bikkis, yes.*
Then we can wait until Sunday. Just ping me whenever you want me to start. I'll continue with the Bikkis until then.
All in due time, Raneaa. But I'd rather serve WFC above all, since he showed me Visipics. <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
You want **more** Marias? <:MariaShock:423196877354303498>
Huh?
Still need you to make more of those.
I could put off the Bikkis and go for Kanades instead.
Yeah, totally. <:KirikaSpook:605209108827734017>
Well, when are your active hours, WFC?
Not yet I don't.
If I *somehow* clean up the Bikkis, then it's either Kanade, Maria, Tsubasa or Serena time. <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>

I have now sorted and uploaded my collection of Symphogear fanart (which includes NSFW material) and I invite you all to download it here: 
EDIT: Due to a Google ToS change that would potentially terminate my account for lewd material, I've deleted everything in my GDrive and I intend to upload everything to MEGA folder later instead.

The rest were in <#336297808221044736> because <:Cag:423197445644615711>
I posted **one** Cag in here recently. <:Cag:423197445644615711>
Wait, didn't I post those today in <#336297808221044736> <:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>

But yeah, more Basa to come. <:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
And that my sorting system is without peer. <:KirikaSmug:607742561414676517>
I hope there were more than you expected. <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>

Can we go and talk about this somewhere? I feel like I wanna have a little discussion where I lay down my perspective on things.
Yeah, but we only get 200 requests, and a lot of what I have doesn't have sources Shirabe can trace.
It's a problem, I know. <:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
These are the art channels, and people do actually use <#407060923078017026> for stuff.

Then you ping me for requests. <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I swear it's random.
Huh. For me it mostly works on Android and on PC you just press Shift + PageUp.
As an aside, you can actually skip to the top with a single click.
Well, I feel better having discussed this now. <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
Hmm, maybe I'll reserve dumps for DMs per request.
Yeah. But I have to stress that picking favorites can be really tough sometimes. <:ElfneinDrowning:336656417035517952>
Or even lower.
Yeah. I have an idea for another compromise. How about I just do 10-15 per day and just skip the rest?
Yes. <:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
But it feels disruptive there too.
So I thought moving to <#407060923078017026> would be best, especially after the complaints WFC has brought up.
With me so far?
I don't have enough space to update the pinned stash either, so it's either post it here, or let it lie until people make requests.
But I also want to get rid of it, which leads to my volume levels.
Now, I want to share it, since there's a lot of good stuff.
I didn't repost it here either.
So, this is stuff from my end: I've amassed a stupid amount of art since I didn't have time to sort it for months.
Ok then. <:ChrisSmile:336656717553074176>
Yes, I know, your perspective is in important in this, WFC.
<:ChrisSmile:336656717553074176>
*Just know that there is a lot of Chris stuff to share.*
Can *you* sign up yourself for Chris? I need an outlet, dangit. <:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970> <@436201995100094476>

Did you check your permissions yet? <@!247701824335904770>
Oh yeah, in case your DM permissions are restricted,  can I send you Chris? <@209896097026408449>
Assuming I am allowed to DM you some, naturally. <:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
<@!246678192360783872> , you're Basas, <@!247701824335904770> , you're Marias.
If it's any consolation, I did make a spreadsheet for my exercise data. <:MariaConfident:336657338729627658>

I'll make a text document instead.
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
*Shit, I barely know how to format spreadsheets.*
You might as well go to the pinned post at that point.
...anything?

<:Cag:423197445644615711>
All right, everyone present, tell me your art dump preferences if you have any.
Yeah, I know.
*Do I need a spreadsheet of preferences now?* <:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
Well, that's all for today, I guess. I'll make sure to save the best for here and send the rest to <@106866895076003840> <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>

All right, in light of what people want, would all of you be ok with group DMs for Hibimiku stuff, single and together?

No, I need a job and artists with time on their hands.

Sorry Saki, Mikus like that are in short supply.
Might as well post more DJ Dessmeister.
The only Pixiv trick I know is how to exclude tags for the heathens who only use the shortened Symphogear tag.

Yeah, that's a reaction better saved for assholes who sell prints of stolen art. Not those who use it as a profile picture.
I assume this is linked with doujins and stuff.
Would you happen to know anything about art culture in Japan, WFC?
I think I've seen Square Enix imply something along those lines when KH3 was leaked.

<:ChrisBored:672575526346424351>
And there's Aria, jumping at any chance to be a tosspot.
<:MariaShock:423196877354303498>
What?
Yeah, yeah. Have your fun.

Wait a second...




Well, off it goes.

Tsubasa with her hair down, you said?
<:HibikiWhoops:585839808115507222>
Oh, right, I was gonna help you.
And email for the next 20 years. <:MikuPraise:585839808765493249>
Hehe, my GDrive is ever so slowly draining in size. They're still not done deleting everything. <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I have a physical backup. This is a precaution, since I very much like the services tied to my email account.
<:ChrisPresents:672578363176517642>
You think that's impressive, wait until you see how tidy everything is.
<:CagliostroSmile:672861875385401344>
So make that an extra **12000** later.
<:CarolSmug:617040484111745027>
<:CarolYandere:424047704826707980>
Now to delete.
Enjoy! <:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
Yer welcome. Though you might as well wait on the updated version.
<:GenjuurouThumbsUp:336657189475188740>
Not sure what the size difference will be.
<:HibikiSmug:672655850518609940>
I hope you're ready for an extra 10000 pics.
Anyways, my physical backup is almost complete, so I'll delete the GDrive, edit the pinned message and then put it all on  MEGA later.
Pretty sure people use different services for code.
<:HibikiWhat:336656482907193344>
What company? It's a few school projects I use for my CV.
<:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
Yeah, hence the expulsion of the art. The code isn't lewd.
All right, my folder is now gone. Went fron 14.2 GB of usage to 2.6 GB. <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
But if it has a Pixiv ID or Danbooru tags, you can just look it up manually.
That too. Use SauceNAO and ascii.net on your own.
I think she's set up to only do that function in these two channels.
No idea.
I skipped those full size ones and went for the preview.
I just said that I can minimize spam thanks to the boost, Aria.
~~Now that I think about it, I have seen fan book covers in the 50MB range.~~
<:MichaWhat:336657148627124225>
...that's 47MB?
ZIP files are much easier for upload systems to process.
...to make it into a single file.
<:CarolSmug:617040484111745027>

Nope, got a bear suit Carol and a dragon Carol. No fox.
Any specific type?
So, anyone else in need of 50MB of art? <:ShiraBean:661294258795446326>
<:HibikiSmug:672655850518609940>
I see the Tsubasas from earlier summoned Maya.
It's 8 for non-Nitro peeps, like me. I think it's 25 for Nitro users.
<:HibikiBlep:605209109284782090>
MegaBytes. It's a unit of data.
<:ElfneinWeld:586027421296492585>
So yeah, now I can provide people with art in 50MB chunks, thus limiting the amount of spam.
'Tis good stuff. <:TsubasaBliss:672861879000891432>
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
We have a 50 MB upload limit now.
Tada! <@!431214733463519232>
Ok, I think that's enough Basas.


But first:
Hmm, lemme try something.
Of course I do.
At least as far as Basa-only pics. There's probably more in the pairings...
I think that's it.

<:ShiraBean:661294258795446326>
I can send so much mail now.
Oh wow, I was wrong. It wasn't done deleting before. My storage went from 14.2 GB to 0.7 GB.

Dearest members of the server, it is my great honor to present to you the culmination of months of grueling work. Simply put, I have amassed the greatest private collection of Symphogear art (mostly SFW, some NSFW), GIFs and screenshots in the known universe and sorted it all for easy access using methods developed after much trial and error. And now, it can all be yours. <:ChrisPresents:672578363176517642> 

You only need to follow this link and download at your leisure: <https://mega.nz/#F!TYMhCQSI!r2kxLEdSAZheFJ1O6XZr5w>

Just remember to download every part of the folder you're interested in and unpack the pieces together. It should be enough to unpack the first part and it'll do the rest for you.

Yeah, but I think the sets they posted all shared source. I think they posted it in batches. Not sure how they managed to do that without triggering Shirabe multiple times or getting an error.
Shirabe can only handle so many requests at once, so you probably need to slow down and use ``jii_skip`` more. <@!468591607332208641>

And for good measure:

Please pace your image posting and use ``3_skip`` to not waste queries on images from the same source. Also remember to use ``3_skip`` when posting reaction images or official art that can't be sourced.
Not unless you're posting official art or stuff from the same source after posting one image from the source already.
See?

<@!457268466429329429>
It defaults to sourcing when you just upload an image.

The *thingie* I'm using I'm using to power Yggdrasil might be on the fritz, ok? <@!481518367845646346>
See, this time it worked as intended. <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
But undefined should mean no response from the API.
The error messages aren't mine, they're from the SauceNAO library I'm using.
If the issue persists, I'll see if I can do something. But it's probably out of my hands.
I meant the API.
Good thing I put in the backup. <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>

Right, might as well tag <@!481518367845646346>
<@456226577798135808> <@!84811738653929472> It didn't break. It performed correctly (put the images through SauceNAO, found nothing, went to Ascii2d and then posted the results for each image). The only issue is that they were posted too fast for the slower Ascii2d search.

Ok, testing it quickly on a small folder, it'll work as long as all parts are in the same folder. If you miss one it'll complain about missing data.
I haven't actually tested unpacking in a while. <:YumiPanic:688429717174354012>
Just download every part, put  them in the same folder and unpack everything together.
I don't know how the archiving is done. Maybe they all include the upper folders, but then split the actual images between them.
<:FineShocked:672430513025187840>

And before you ask, Carol/Elfnein is under Group/Random Pairs/Side Characters
Download every part and unpack.
No, they're each a piece of the whole thing.
Makes it easier to upload/dowload.
Oh that, it's a .zip archive.
<:ElfneinPresents:691733046633955439>

So if you see me get pissy about people not skipping in the future, now you know why. <:CagliostroSmile:672861875385401344>
They complement eachother! <:ShiraBean:736607747834904667>
Ascii2d is usually more effective at catching what SauceNAO misses, but it also has a lot of false positives, hence the indirect link.
And it's not technically limited, since I use ascii2d as a backup service. It'll just be much slower if we go over the limit of the day.
...because I don't wanna pay the $6/month when I have to pay for hosting.

No. Sympathy. <:MikuDelete:661660028410920990>

I have no sympathy for people who collect art on their phones. You dug your own graves. <:CagliostroSmile:672861875385401344>

Let's just use torrents for anime! <:YumiPoint:688429724103344164>
Yes, but it'd limit how often I could update. Not to mention me needing to keep duplicated data on my end.
Solopy, we just went through that. I know you have a thing for torrents, but c'mon. <:ShirabeConcern:586404485598019604>
I switched from Gdrive to escape eventual deletion due to the content not being encrypted fully.

~~If nothing else, it's proof of my determination.~~
Genius! <:TikiPraise:672430544381935625>
Also, I update the structure to improve the sorting from time to time, which I doubt would gel well with a torrent. They're more for unchanging piles of big files.
Let me just land that job I'm interviewing for on Monday then. <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
We'll see. Haven't actually looked at storage pricing. But thanks anyway.
Oh yeah, I thought about that. Since my collection is ever changing, torrents aren't very useful. Maybe if I made new torrents every six months or so.

I ain't doing that unless I have to. That's one hell of a point of failure.

The what's and the whoosits?
JavaScript. <:ShemHaTilt:729980149529051156>
I think I made it like that because a) It's a rare problem and b) and the libraries I use are strict about filetypes.

The pair of pics are of Andou.

Next time, prioritize what you post. You need to give each piece room to breathe. If you really need to share a lot of art quickly, you can compile it into a 50MB archive and share that instead.
And just because you think there won't be a Pixiv page doesn't mean you should use the skip command. You should only use it if you're posting from the same source. Chances are the backup search will find a Twitter link.
Yeah, you totally blew past the daily query limit. <:ShirabeFear:696380146248319066> <@!379337518371307522>

You shouldn't try to source anime screenshots. As I said before, if you want to post them and talk about them, use the skip command or post in <#407060923078017026> . Is that clear, or were you confused about something?
The service is just not responding properly.

Could you stop posting screenshots and shitposts here, especially without the skip command? <#407060923078017026> exists for a reason. <@!236944855828398080>
<:CagliostroSmile:672861875385401344>
Some people have different standards and *some* people should learn what constitutes as horny art.

Did you try asking me? <:OgawaRead:688429716507721770> <@!722121666641133608>
<:HibikiBlep:605209109284782090>
No. Also, you asked for it.
<:CagliostroSmile:672861875385401344>
Still, you'd do well to compress anyway.
Usually it's when it goes to Ascii2d that it complains.
It'll apparently work if it's logged on SaceNAO. <:HibikiThink:688429715362414641>
(I was mostly thinking of the second image in the tweet, for reference.)

Oh yeah, since it's my inofficial responsibility, is everyone happy with how the art channels work now, or is there some work left to be done? I'd like some community feedback.
~~So if anyone has any doubts about if something should go in <#336297808221044736> , put it there to be safe.~~
I just want you to understand what the art channels are for and how to use them.

<:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
If it did that, people would have less control over deleting stuff they posted and the uglier embed I made would supercede the normal one for single image tweets, so I decided against making it automatic.
<:CagliostroSmile:672861875385401344>
If people remember to use the command.
<:ChrisHappy:660870796696223744>

If someone looks at this on mobile, the second image won't show: https://twitter.com/kw8ui3yimxylcg6/status/1458766927254278152?s=20
It maintains the source. It's just for mobile users.
Huh?
Why did you use the skip command when posting art from different artists? If you don't understand how to use the art channels, feel free to ask. But I swear I've tried to teach you half a dozen times already.
<:CagliostroSmile:672861875385401344>

If you're scrolling danbooru, you can just share the link in the post: https://twitter.com/xiwashiwa/status/1464636170541801478
Did you direct link that?

I applaud you for remembering the skip command once, but please use it on screenshots as well. How many times do I have to remind you? It's getting to the point where I want to reprimand you for not learning how to post in here. <:KanadeBleh:672455306059579392>

They posted a direct image link, which you can only see with the tweet in front of you, unless it came from another server or something.
I replied to the post by ZGundam just below, so it's not about you.

There are no hard rules besides overloading Yggdrasil, but you need to give people time to actually look at stuff. If you really want to show someone, DMs are always an option.
~~See, this is why I set up specialized DM groups as outlets.~~
Spread it out a bit. Make it last.
Fair, but you know there's not room for hundreds of images here per day.
I'm a mod and the fanart specialist. So no.

Live and learn.
Yes you can, it's not a big deal. Take some good breaths and relax. <:MikuSigh:688429722799308883>
That was my solution. Whenever I go through new stuff, I also skip Twitter art, since it most likely came from here and won't be autosourced.
I do too. But it's a shared space and navigating through dozens of pictures gets old. Have you considered just DM:ing people? Or being more selective?
This has been happening a lot lately though. <:HibikiSad:738234648509022368>
And I have no idea when the reset is, so you shouldn't assume it matches your timezone.

It's always a 80/20 chance. Some artists draw them very similarly.

It is, but with my Ascii2d integration being broken last I checked, the successrate would be quite low.
The hope is it'll lead to some accidental laughs down the line, though I'll need to update the list.
This was the best one, and I don't want to encourage spam.
No.

<:MariaDefeated:688429716780089397>
They should have introduced Elfnein in G and strained everyone's screentime even more?
And hey, this doesn't seem to be on on Pixiv, so Ascii2d found it on Twitter with a manual search:

https://twitter.com/FujikawaDaichi/status/1512394280916041728
I did that to reduce false positives, which hasn't been an issue in my experience.
I think the threshold for a valid match is 85%.

No idea, this was the first time I checked my stats.
<:OgawaRead:688429716507721770>
And for those curious, there are about 13 queries left for the next 24 hours.
And it worked 9 hours ago. Maybe it's just a server-side hiccup.
<:HibikiThink:688429715362414641>
It's making queries and deducting from the daily limit at least.


The straw is a nice touch.

No, that seems to be random. Das was curious about the daily limit of 100 searches.

Not exactly, but I'll take it. We separate the channels and ask people to spoiler extreme stuff for a reason.
You're the one at fault here. Own up to it and learn.
And yeah, if it's R18-G on *Pixiv*, then it doesn't belong in <#336297674707828747>
Sure.
<:MikuSigh:688429722799308883>

Nah, couldn't be bothered. They know what they did. Unless they are willingly blind, which I assume is true for some people around here.
Oh, you didn't post the link that got deleted? Guess it was ZGundam again and he didn't react.

Question is, was it an Izuna Drop in the fight with Genjuro and Fudou?
It's fiiiiiine.
Isn't that just a suplex? I thought the Izuna Drop had the spinning component to it.

Nobody owes you a ping. It's common courtesy, yes, but one that is easily forgotten.
None of that or you get muted.

~~I also have a metric ton of cute sketches that need to be posted more often.~~

*It's pretty good.*
I put the source right there in the comments. Post that instead, it'll even embed better.
Not unless I prune away people who may or may not still be active.

~~This needs an update, as some people in there haven't responded in years.

You always put a negative spin on the request, as if you are already owed it.
It's toxic and self-centered behaviour that easily spirals out of control and gets people uncomfortable.
They only do official art, so I'm giving it a pass.

So manual input it is.
I used to have it search there too, but my library broke.
It effectively means it's not on Pixiv and maybe on Twitter, which Ascii2d can find.

Cyborg, vampire and accesorizing catgirl.
Eyy.
Could be, Kinekuri.
No, I meant the returning villain role.
<:ShirabePout:336656831978012712>
...I suppose that works.
She'll carry on the doctor's legacy. <:Ver:336656981144109066>
She's totally coming back for an episode.
And she *still* hasn't been put in XDU.
It is *heavily* implied in the AXZ OVA.
This is gonna be cramped.
And deal with Fudou.
Shit, I forgot that they're gonna revive Carol too. <:CarolYandere:424047704826707980>
Skates! <:KirikaMegane:585848185847676939>
It was implied I was promised a season of punching god!
<:MariaYell:336657352264646657>
They could follow the same structure as AXZ and use the remnant trio until the last few episodes. That'd suck.
It's just what we hope.
*She better not use the Papika voice*
<:TsubasaSmug:585839805737467920>

Welp, they never said this would be easy.
...I foresee an avalanche of FlipFlap jokes incoming.
Have one of them defect.
I hope. <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
So, they have to use these guys in a different way from the SG crew, right? There has to be some twist on another trio of alchemists.

It's the perfect plan.
What, purity = gains?
<:TsubasaDisgust:349013662775902209>
Or like this:
God will look like this, by the way.
<:TsubasaSmug:585839805737467920>
Hopefully by getting sawed in half by God.
Either that, or Maria has to achieve Excalibur.
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
Well then, the Geahs will obviously lose, leading to IGNITE Mark II.
The preview is an early episode, right?
We do have an action quota.
They are not wasting all those new powers without a fight.
Maybe after at least one fight.
Eevees or bust.
That's stuff for a 52-episode show.
Faaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaarfetched.
What kind of show do you think this is?
<:CarolShock:430939013235474432>

I doubt it. It's probably just a spin attack thingie.
<:MariaYell:336657352264646657>

Whenever you make something, there are always ideas to cut.

I thought this was relevant:

Bullshit and genocide. <:Germain:421434126856486912>
Like, to steal relics or something.
Would be nice if they were singularly focused on the Geahs.
And Maria/Chris will block with their shield...
XV just cold starts with Maria eating shit. <:HibikiShock:336656371611074580>
Mind flaying will probably be like the IGNITE dream sequences.
<:MariaConfident:336657338729627658>
Maria jobbing it again? I know that's in character, but she was so good in AXZ.
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I know who can't be.
It's gonna be a ride.

sleep.
You.
So, who's ready for more Quality™ in XV?
Dadbasa.
Theory: Tsubasa's voice keeps getting deeper due to an unconscious desire to ape after Kanade.
The stroganettes did in AXZ.
OVAs are for main characters. But they might get one scene.
Not ever happening at all, ever.

I know the feeling.
Seems accurate.

<:HibikiShock:336656371611074580>
Someone stop her, before she gets too handsome!
Ah, ok.
You can find AXZ episodes everywhere, but for the OVAs, you're better off digging through <#336300750248476693>
Never brought me any trouble, save for popups. <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>

What else...oh yeah, the illuminati gals are a thing.

Our heroes. <:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
"Who the hell has heard of a vampire in Antarctica? This is ridiculous."
Money well spent. <:MikuPraise:585839808765493249>
Objectivety is a lie. <:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
In other news, I finished up my impressions. <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720> 

```Ok, so the episode starts with someone namedropping Fine and shooting the moon with the Frontier laser thing. It seems like he's an actual Custodian and that the curse they enacted wasn't exactly what they intended. It's so exciting to finally get to know what their deal is!

The actual plot starts with the Geah team hunting an ancient coffin in the Antarctic. That's something to do.

But nevermind that, HIBIKI'S NEW TRANSFORMATION IS SO FUCKING RAD.

And Kirika and Shirabe attack by doing figure skating! What even?!

And then Maria and Hibiki do a handholding fusion drill attack. That's the good stuff.

Even so, this opening scene wasn't as hype as the ones in GX and AXZ. But on the other hand, it's not a filler thing either, since this evil coffin thing is seemingly important to the plot.

Then we cut back to Hibiki singing the Lydian school song while Miku plays the piano. That was pretty great. I'm less a fan of the hamfisted foreshadowing Miku does. It's like she knows that Fudou will kidnap her and make her fight the others.

Then we see anime Trump working together with Japan for a moon rocket project. How the hell he managed that after NUKING JAPAN LAST SEASON is beyond me.

So, they used Tiki's corpse to track down the coffin and we finally see the three new villains properly. A vampire, a wolf girl and a cyborg. Props for the Hammer theming, I guess.

Holy shit, we get a sextet song in the first episode! What the hell are they gonna do for the last episode then!?

Hibiki gets pulled into a lake and engages her frikkin' drill punch for propulsion. That's some good ingenuity.

And then the fight ends with a Gaynado bullet shot by Chris, fueled by everyone's power. Hell yeah!

I'm down with what the season has put up. There's a lot of callbacks and promise of the overarching story ending, which is what I want. And a lot of gay fluff, of course.```
Well, doesn't that suck. <:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
Reminder that he NUKED JAPAN in AXZ.

They spent a lot of <:Kiricoin:495336831978569759> on it.
Maybe you need to rewatch the episode. <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Climate change revealed the coffin.
It was the other way around, dunkek.
One assumes.



Yoooooo. <:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
Nothing more anime than being lazy about mythology.
As long as I get a gold and silver punching session, I'm content. <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
The Golden Gauntlet looks a bit similar.
Well, he didn't use a Gear, now did he?
🤔
Airgetlam did weird things in just about every season, so they might give it further significance in XV.
She's obvoisly using Excalibur, one of the main Custodian Relics. <:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
Same thing happened in GX, I think.
Were we not clear enough with all the handholding jokes? <:HibikiWhat:336656482907193344>
...it's kinda the whole idea behind her as a character.
The best format. <:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
Well, you could just use a video downloader. Then again, the quality would be pretty crappy on a TV.
I guess you can do that. I'd just hook up a laptop with HDMI though.
What, you need MP4s?
Convert what?
If you haven't, then *yes you really do.*
Sometimes I wonder if you people are possessed by Topdad.

King Crimson basically embrace it.
I think the Prince Estate got close, hence all the safeguarding.

It'll be a rap song about how much she hates Fudou.
More Basa focus is exciting. I guess XV will be about her, Miku and Hibiki and maybe a bit of Maria.
"Fuck you dad, I'm moving in with Maria!"
Good for you Maya, we're sorta getting both as fan projects.
With mechanics, and structure and fun.
No, remake it into an actual video game. <:MariaConfident:336657338729627658>

Symphogear Twitter? Do we have our own social network? <:HibikiWhat:336656482907193344>

Starting as the underdog, ending as the champ. It's what the series deserves.
Good riddance. <:MariaConfident:336657338729627658>
Not just Japanese twitter?
Then we can talk movies.
XV first.
Golden Bikki & Miku. <:KirikaMegane:585848185847676939>
Basa's voice will just continue getting deeper. You can't stop it.
I think it was a question about how those comedy bits in One Piece can happen when people should not even notice a hit from a normal human, BDH.
Or Bikki doesn't have it in her to block. <:HibikiWhoops:585839808115507222>
It's like how in One Piece ( I think that was the one) where the normal women can hurt the super powered men since they aim for the soul or something.
Aaaaand saved.
So, how many plotlines do we have rolling now? Custodians, Fudou, illuminati, Tsubasa's mind break, Elfnein's Carol thing, Hibimiku drama...
Back to what's important. I got Beyblade representation this episode! <:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>

<:HibiMikuCry:586026583870013455>
It's gonna be one hell of a moment, I bet.
You mean after she channels <:CarolYandere:424047704826707980> ?
Then don't say "wore off".
You said it wore off, so I assumed it had appeal at the start.
Then say so.
Well, yes. But save your complaining for then. <:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
It's been two episodes. She gets to flaunt her gimmick for that long.
Is she? Maybe I need to watch more anime. <:CarolShock:430939013235474432>
Good on the writers for getting the fanbase all riled up against Milla.
Buttplugs, psychic powers and robot arms. How could our heroes possibly beat that? <:HibikiShock:336656371611074580>
Also, as she said, they're trash, so they play dirty.
If anything, she's a giant heel. Killing 100000 people to build heat.
Simple, <:Cag:423197445644615711> tutored her.

Also, Metanoia is a huge shoutout to the sixth Yu-Gi-Oh ARC-V opening.

They're not axing both.
Who? <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Maybe they are incorporating the Airgetlam's weird theme of not having a theme into the story.
Well, Maria teased her and Serena's backstory in episode 2.
It's in the OP, right?
She punched <:Cag:423197445644615711> a lot.
I think the wrap is a Gundam thing.
She's the small knife to Tsubasa's big sword. <:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
It's a knoife.
The transformation will just be her crying for 40 seconds thinking about Serena.
But <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720> handled the thigh quota.

Maria can steal any move from the others. <:MariaSunglasses:336656798687690752>

Yeah, I read that. Which is why I confused Ono and Agematsu.
So many Japanese names and titles. <:ElfneinBullying:421432763078410241>

Then in GX, there's a fight between <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158> and <:ShirabePout:336656831978012712> for some reason.
Then, after that, they <:DMJii:549819519082692608>
Then the Finé reveal happens and <:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367> mentally shits herself for being an idiot.
They fight, with <:ShirabeStare:582381430915596289> wanting to save everyone and <:KirikaApproval:586957465552158720> wanting to save Shirabe first and foremost.
<:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
<:ShirabeStare:582381430915596289> wises up to the faults of the G plan, but <:KirikaChant:587018932985004034> is dead set on giving <:ShirabeStare:582381430915596289> a future.
Ok, so the plot of G trucks along until the Finé shield happens. At this point Kirika undergoes her first piece of change. Thinking that she'll fade away and never see <:ShirabeStare:582381430915596289> again, she doubles down on the plan so that <:ShirabeStare:582381430915596289> gets someplace to live after the moon falls.
At this point, Kirika is determined to save the world in some fashion. Enter: Terrorism™
They hit it off and <:DMJii:549819519082692608> , until they get recruited properly by FIS.
But then, she meets <:ShirabeStare:582381430915596289>
Not much to start on. <:TsubasaYareYare:407397617451139073>
So, going by what we know, she's an orphan who values the birthdays of others.
Hey, let's take this oppurtunity to examine <:KirikaChant:587018932985004034> as a character.
Also: <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
But Kirika isn't the most sound of mind.
That's the meta reason, yes.
Man, child soldiers are a bad idea, aren't they? If only we could get adults in our magical girl shows instead. I'm sure that'd sell just as well. <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I caught up. <:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
calm down
I think Aoi said it somewhere.
Reminder that episode 4 is the heavy Hibimiku episode. <:HibiMikuCry:586026583870013455>
<:MariaShock:423196877354303498>

I can't wait for the Fudou/Tsubasa plot to literally become this:
GO. WATCH. <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
Grenadier?
Also: https://i.imgur.com/CdHMQba.gif
(More in the album.)
Anyone want some GIFs? https://imgur.com/a/Ml6Fad7

If anyone wants to know how much better YT is. <:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
<:Germain:421434126856486912>
I can see it.
If Carol takes over Elfnein for one fight and sings, I'll be hella satisfied. <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
Less Ver and more Carol in my XV discussion, please. Elfnein has the memory helmet in the OP, we're totally getting a Carol cameo later. <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I don't know, Fudou is getting under my skin. <:ChrisAngry:336656958272700417>
"Those bastards saw our cosplay before the convention!"
calm down
The arsenal keeps growing. <:ChrisSmile:336656717553074176>
Genocide?
Watching any Geah stream would be great. Tsubasa has a Famicom, maybe she's good at Ninja Gaiden or something.
But hey, at least you're honest.
Now that's a bad mindset. <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Hey, it might be good after a few decades of patches. <:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
She'd totally do that.
SG and Prelati aren't intimate characters, so they can only show so much emotion.
You're right.
I have a good chunk of it too. <:KanadeSit:535301654464036884>
Lost, like tears in the rain. <:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
Yes, that's just a dumb joke.
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
SHE JUST KEEPS GOING
We're approaching horny on main. <:ShirabeStare:582381430915596289>
She had to die for the rest of the series to not end in a harem. <:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>

SHE CANNOT BE STOPPED
Well, Maria has hinted at Ukraine backstory stuff.
She's a wolf girl, dangit! <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
Punch god, fist Miku. There's your episode 13. <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
<:HibiMikuCry:586026583870013455>
65 episodes is pretty good though. Most shows only get 26. <:MariaSunglasses:336656798687690752>
That's a given, but think of all the other things that will be in the OVAs. <:KirikaMegane:585848185847676939>
"Married With DMJii Crashing Your Place"
Cheap to make, too. <:Kiricoin:495336831978569759>
What, she's almost a christmas cake. <:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
<:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
Man, the fanbase is gonna riot if Milla gets redeemed. <:CarolYandere:424047704826707980>
There is something relevant to your request there. <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
...maybe you should check <#336297808221044736>
Dominatrix bananahead! <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Bondage, banana Noise.
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>

One for your artistic vision, one for your marketing team. <:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
<:HibiMikuCry:586026583870013455>
That is the talk of the town, yes.

Hey, wait a minute...THEY'RE EATING DANGO! <:Germain:421434126856486912>

It's not my job to name it. <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
We're getting an exceed mode or something later, going by the OP and the "System Normal" thing.

https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/431914167826382860/603875235221209097/1564023138760.png
Yeah, we've left the pic I posted, unless someone wants to talk about the Crimson Nobles.
No idea, Wild Arms was his big break. <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
That's what the "Kadingnir game walkthrough" joke from S1 is about.
The games Kaneko wrote before Symphogear.
Also, Wild Arms, Cypher.
Yes.
I loved 3. <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
Played 3 already. <:KirikaApproval:586957465552158720>
<:MariaConfident:336657338729627658>
Joke's on you, I'll play them all.
Also, the main character in 3 is very much like Hibiki. <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
The villain in 3 has the Gungnir spear. <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I need to play more Wild Arms. <:ElfneinBullying:421432763078410241>
I can see that happening.
That was the writer, not Ver. <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
Probably.

<:HibikiWhoops:585839808115507222>
Anyways, Cold Steel talk goes in <#337805317276565525>
...but Laura is the best. <:HibikiWhat:336656482907193344>
"Oh yeah, this is the one anime where they don't do that." <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
It's one of many ways the show avoids lot of tired anime jokes.
Also, Tsubasa doesn't care about her chest.
<#357682999300718592> is over there. <:GarieWink:336657101273169921>
~~Who is about as terrible at talking to people.~~
Ah yes, the series with Bustier Tsubasa. <:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
Miku just casually flashing her wife from the sidelines to motivate her to fight. <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Blood deficiancy?
IT ALL MAKES SENSE
AXZ was the tomato season. 🍅
🍋
Yeah, XV is the lemonade season.
<:CarolYandere:424047704826707980>
"Some"?
``All hail the mighty gaijin chart.``
Also, Tsubasa can totally do this if she needs to:
Airs in an hour, methinks.
It's pretty good. https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/407060923078017026/604687679115886593/75494170_p16.png
I'm kinda missing Kirika with an open jacket.
<:HibiMikuCry:586026583870013455>
Like we are any different.
This will be the theme of today's episode: https://twitter.com/urakata_/status/1147498592883494912
A lot of effort this year. <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>

<:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
Anything's better than Jojo, right? <:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
This guy. But I know it's not from there. <:HibikiWhoops:585839808115507222>
We Digimon now! <:ElfneinWeld:586027421296492585>
Let's go with that.
Well, this whole thing came about from SG's gun.
Hey, doesn't this episode mean that SG is stuck alongside Hibiki? <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
<:CarolYandere:424047704826707980>
So, what are the chances this guy was a tokusatsu fan?
2/5 <:KirikaApproval:586957465552158720>
Also, ``hail the chart.``
Only cowards refuse to post without context. <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Kaneko is a fucking nerd. <:MariaSunglasses:336656798687690752>
The only thing I know about Mazinger Z is that it was popular in South America and that God Hand stole the theme song for its credits song. <:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
Keep on flaunting that ancient mecha knowledge, Melua. It'll always go over my head. <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Are you in any way surprised?
*Or they're gonna use it to make  a bridge to the moon.*
Methinks it's just a reference.
Huh, guess I can buy that.
I need something clarified. Why did Noble Red summon Noise after the gauntlet was activated?
Hibiki is Madoka, Yuuna, Seiya and Jojo. <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
May Fudou haunt your dreams. <:GarieWink:336657101273169921>
Reason #89 why Twitter sucks. <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
Ouch.
Ohh.
Which twist are you talking about, WFC?
Here, to balance things out:
Yes, another one was made, I don't have it at hand.
But he hates songs, so it won't happen. <:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
<:Ver:336656981144109066>


Also, I think I can properly translate what Aoi said about episode 4 now. *ahem*
"Episode 4 is the raddest shit we've done in a while and I'm so glad we got it greenlit! <:Germain:421434126856486912> "
C'mon Lily, we didn't even get the alluded Hibimiku stuff this episode. <:MichaWhat:336657148627124225>
Everyone knows the moon is the best final dungeon. <:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
Gotta think as crazy as Kaneko and going full JRPG is the only way.
Solopy, none of your suffering shenanigans. <:ChrisAngry:336656958272700417>
Or *reborn*. <:Cag:423197445644615711>
Also, fun fact, Fudou was basically born during WW2.
For the glory of Nippon! <:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
I think the Ichaival thing was written before he was turned into antagonist.
He knows.
Guys, he talked about SSJ at the end of AXZ.
That's quite clearly the case.
Quite the twig.
No, this is her official look:
Ok, let me post something actually worth a <:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
<@279341087494242304>
Spoilers for the METANOIA attack card:
She'll be fine.
*Can we please get a "Fuck you dad!" from Tsubasa, Genjuro and Yatsuhiro at the same time?*
At this point, Fudou can't be subtle anymore.
Milla's heretical nature?
"Da fuck you say about muh kazuko?"
Elsa is a cute. <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
Vanessa is such an one-san that she can weaponize gayness literally.
"B-but Miku said other women's breasts are poison to the touch!"
The conviction being: Fuck my stupid temps! <:Germain:421434126856486912>
*vrooooooom*
<:ElfneinBullying:421432763078410241>
*Our hamster might be too powerful.*
💯
https://streamable.com/1qcck
With a song in her heart and Saint Germain's legacy in her fist, Hamster Jesus stands invincible.
Aww, she loves people to death.

Miku even comments on it in S1, I think.
Bikki is ripped and the anime can't convince me otherwise.
*ahem*
No, fuck that, make her do a Judgement Cut End! <:Germain:421434126856486912>
Maybe some kick-ass Kendo? <:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
The bondage is there to symbolize that she's Tsubasa's sub. <:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
Oh yeah, i'm sure people want this. Maria's Marias can't be contained. <:MariaConfident:336657338729627658>
How long until someone else gets the ghost of an alchemist to help?  <:CarolYandere:424047704826707980>
I think they get $96 per episode, so they have to be fast to make a livable wage.
They are assembly line subs, so that's not strange.
Someone on r/anime does a comparison every week.
Oh yeah, here is the episode 3 sub comparison:
Guerilla Tactics™
Our MC is so handsome now.
Hehe.
...you should not be here yet, Aussie.
And she didn't trip during her transformation! <:MariaConfident:336657338729627658>
But hey, if she has to flaunt her bra size, who are we to stop her? <:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
Or tact. <:MariaShock:423196877354303498>
<:MariaSunglasses:336656798687690752>
Maria's Marias know no restraint.
<:MariaConfident:336657338729627658>
I assume you want this handy:
You expect me to be that much of a weeb?
Mages?
Welp, time to miss food. <:ShirabePout:336656831978012712>
The wait is killing me! <:Germain:421434126856486912>
Well, Bikki was the only one who had it in the OP.
But since they did the Bikki focus now, maybe the others will get more later. <:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
I think they were all: <:MikuBliss:336657233712513024>
Oh yeah? <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
They are foolish.
Look, some people want 1980s OVA animation in their TV shows.
Why is that emote not named :twoseconds: ?
Animator horny. <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
In conclusion:
One hopes there is a proper education directive in the anime industry.
Neat.

~~I've heard Miku is a Scorpio.~~
Please do something crazy. <:HibikiEager:407398049531559937>
Then again, it's also the finale and they could do something crazy. We'll see.
We could get some edits, but Metanoia is here to stay.
Animation, or animation plus song?

I like Adam's character concept, but they didn't play it out correctly.
So, are we clear on SG and Serena being ghosts, while Kanade is just in Tsubasa's mind?
One does not deny Hibiki her handholding, even in death.
I'll respect Kaneko a lot if they burn some waifu bridges and make some couples super canon.
<:HibiMikuCry:586026583870013455>
~~And then they kiss.~~
~~And then we can get a season of OVAs.~~
Wait, forget what I said before. Gimme HIBIMIKU GUNGNIR DUAL TRANSFORMATION! <:Germain:421434126856486912> <:Germain:421434126856486912> <:Germain:421434126856486912>
Miku Gungnir pls! <:Germain:421434126856486912>
~~I can't believe they've taken plot points from FMA since GX.~~
Alcemy and reclaiming your human body, huh?
*tfw you'll never have Saint Germain's ghost help you with homework.*

He needed to be more pathetic in some fashion.
It's more that the swap from perfect and smug to faulty and empty didn't hit hard enough.
Huh.
Hell, aren't Ayahi and Yoko doing weekly radio shows?
Bithc, all Aois are cute.
"King's Record-san, I have an idea!"
I know what happened.
Watch the concert. I think Aoi is just really wholesome.
Guess everyone agreed on it being awesome.
Aoi was sad they didn't get a duet, so she made it happen at the concert.
Look, everyone loved the duet, so they made it canon.
But this was an excuse for the hype duet from the concert.
I'm curious to see what follows.
Ye.

https://twitter.com/golden_nabe/status/1156182684357390337
<:Ver:336656981144109066>

4chan posits that the hairclips restrain her lesbianism.
Something something tomatoes and hardship.
Is Hibiki taking revenge for the bath scene in season 1?

That'd be nice. But screentime is precious. I wanna see the full S1 date, for example.
And the episode limit is criminal.
The characters are a major selling point, yes.
I wish we got a bit more stuff about Shirabe's inability to connect with people.
"Kiri-chan can do it with anyone." <:ShirabeEmbarassed:336657288477671436>
Hell, there is a lot of OVA material.
Edge!Bikki would be good OVA material.
~~Maria/Tsubasa fight in episode 6?~~
Reminder that Tsubasa used this line on someone she barely knew:
Will her gay be strong enough?
But can she save Tsubasa from herself? <:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
Not even Maria can fail for 10 more seasons. They'd actually have to make her competent. <:MariaShock:423196877354303498>
...macross?

In fact, it's ridiculous.
65 episodes from an original show is pretty great in this day and age.
What are you people on about?
~~24-episode remakes of seasons when?~~
I rememebr. It was this exact moment:
Anyways, thanks, outside.
With Hibiki as the instigator!
<:KirikaMegane:585848185847676939>

Someone help me edit in Saturday! <:ElfneinBullying:421432763078410241>
...I actually have it already.
Well, she can kill skeletons already.

"I was too late. Everything is ruined."
Gentle PSA to Chris fans: Watch Nobunagun.

Thanks. <:ChrisSmile:336656717553074176>
Ok, I've been told that Ayahi does her Elfnein impression in the episode somewhere. Can anyone pinpont it?
Saki did this already: https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/597211087183675404/607286570210426888/ChrisOhGod.png
Keyframe™
I doubt that would work as a small emote.
The hairclips seal away her rampant lesbianism. <:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>

Let's make her soggier!  <:CarolYandere:424047704826707980>

Hey Nep, if you want someone to gush over Maria's Marias, talk with Raneaa.
Hehe.
First pic gets my vote for effort.
Perhaps this was our last slow episode.
I'm still waiting for the season to "pop off". <:HibiMikuCry:586026583870013455>
Any thoughts? <@193408538909868033>
Is it not enough like a part 1, part 2 kinda deal?
How so?
This is less impressive since these two seasons were planned together.
Gotta reuse that concept art somehow.
Symphogear's thing for weird sex stuff rearing its engorged head. <:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
The blood geyser is ridiculous no matter what happened.
Look, evacuation protocols in Geah world are very sophisticated.
No worries, I hear Kaneko loves Maria. <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
~~As soon as she accidentally kills Maria, she'll stop thinking about silly things like songs and protect Japan properly.~~
Fudou wants her as a tool after he kills the rest.
It was to control Tsubasa.
<:HibikiOhNo:586337444597596202>
It's basically his job to watch Symphogear.
<:GenjuurouThumbsUp:336657189475188740>


It's good that he thought of an ending, but didn't act on it.
Not really, you have to compromise.
```"About XV's meaning, Kaneko said currently he can only told us 'V' stands for "S5", 'X' stands for "the end", just like GX. It also has lots of meaning like AXZ too. Also during S1 production Kaneko already had the idea about how to end Symphogear and he only told Agematsu. But because they didn't expect to make sequel so Kaneko didn't have purpose to describe the details of the Curse of Balal and Custodian but a story about the main trio. It's G that he began to insert his ideas of how to end Symphogear into the shows."```
So much for the spinoff season. <:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>

That's next episode, silly. All of our ticking time bombs have to go off at once.
Basa gonna stab somebody. Hopefully Fudou.
Autocorrect. Not even once. <:TonyEyeRoll:580561912513691679>
Bring back the unified language, abolish English! <:MariaYell:336657352264646657>

You didn't spell that right, but it's correct to me. Terrible word to spell.

To get some strength for the coming week?
BBQ party! <:KirikaMegane:585848185847676939>
Not even that censored for airing. <:KirikaSpook:605209108827734017>
An impressive amount of gore this season. <:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
Not even <:GenjuurouThumbsUp:336657189475188740> is full of that much jam.

Yet. <:CarolShock:430939013235474432>
The show ain't that mean. <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
Now that would lead to some unpleasant drama, Raneaa. <:MariaShock:423196877354303498>
Surprise, Milla slashed herself! <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Man, she poured all her 🍖 into her thighs.
Why is animation so hard?
That reminds me, Vanessa looked so off model when talking to Fudou. And Milla totally smashed that camera with the wrong hand.
"I fucking hate pancakes."
Balance is restored.

It's now or never.
You go write your prequel fic.
Same.
I assume there is intense discussion about this over at /a/.
<:GenjuurouThumbsUp:336657189475188740>
Oh, guess there was more at the end of the CR one.
Welp, same extra scene. <:HibikiWhoops:585839808115507222>

I think I saw it somewhere...
Nope, nevermind. They only fixed the transformation ones. <:HibikiWhoops:585839808115507222>

Is it legendary like the screaming sessions in DBZ?
Do tell, AKeupho.

Imagine how terible anime would be if everyone was ripping off Geah. <:KirikaSkeptical:586406806482583556>
The weeb industry is incredibly adept at consuming itself over and over.
Praise be to Nana for providing us with anime without source material.
Now, *Isekai* light novels are a genre that you can hate on all you like. <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Light novels aren't a genre.  <:TonyEyeRoll:580561912513691679>
Which is legit.
Mecha as a genre is just an excuse for animators to live out the play sessions they had watching mecha as kids.
Season 1?
Says the mecha fan. <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
<:ElfneinWeld:586027421296492585>
Oh yeah, the whole process was: Bake the subs, cry at the increase in file size, make into MP4, make happy screams about it only being 13GB instead of 33, cut 30 minutes, render, upload, repeat.
Got it into digestible 600MB pieces for his internet. <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Hah! I melted into 540p with MP4 encoding and cut it into 30 minute chunks for a friend.

VIVID STRIKE SEASON WITH NOTHING BUT PUNCHGIRLS! <:Germain:421434126856486912>
Remember how lucky we actually are. **65 EPISODES**
And if you think this is bad, wait until we get the actual <:HibiMikuCry:586026583870013455> cliffhanger.
Well, 8 weeks of cryo sleep is always an option.

Is such a thing possible, Lily? <:KirikaSpook:605209108827734017>

Ok, to make up for that, lemme post some fun DMjii.

Consider the following suffering:

"So Millaarc shout "dynamic" here is also a reference of WA1's villian Boomerang's move "Boomerang Dynamic"."
While I'm at it, integrated dual DMJii transformation pls.
No, I mean Gungir enveloping them both at the same time.
~~With another special transformation to boot.~~
I want <:HibiMiku:432007202136391690> to use it at the same time somehow.
But forget having Miku don the Gungnir.
Could just go regular.
I wish.
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720> <:ShirabeStare:582381430915596289> <:MariaConfident:336657338729627658>
And Senritsou Sorority.
Hospital, remember?
How do you even...
The god named Jean?
"Jean and Ver"?
I knew she was a trash panda. <:Cag:423197445644615711>
So, any chance that upcoming baseball anime will be hella gay? I know not everything can be Sakura Trick, but c'mon! <:Germain:421434126856486912>
All I know is that we live in a society. <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Many things in this world can be blamed on the frail nature of the male ego. <:ElfneinDrowning:336656417035517952>
I wonder if there are a lot of male fans who feel they "own" the show. And if the girls were explicitly gay, then they can't "own" them anymore.
Or paying for Hetero doujins. <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I hope the shows that carry the Geah torch will be allowed to have properly gay characters. Might take a while though.
*Allegedly*
I hope they burn the otaku bridge and make them kiss last episode.
```>This also potentially establishes a short term "leverage" that Noble had. If they were purchasing the blood through the funds that Fudo laundered to their group, he might not have known how to leash them without them simply fleeing. Now that they've had to beg, he's got them in his pocket, not favor for favor, but servant to master.

>It's elegant: Mila still gets to scream about how she's just doing it for her family; Fudo is directly established as funding the more aggressive portions of Noble Red's endeavors, We establish animosity between Fudo and Red, we get to establish Fudo as playing the greater game (Queue the reason Fudo has Mila take out the guards isn't because they're incompetent, but because he ordered them to get seen and needs them quiet so Noble Red still believes he's just rolling with things going wrong. 

>We even get to characterize Mila far stronger than currently: Vanessa may have negotiated it in this hypothetical, but when Fudo says "Give me an atrocity for your family's lives", she still agrees to it without question: A foil to Saint Germain and Hibiki on "What's worth spending the price of a life?". "Nothing", "Everything", and "what's mine" respectively.```
```Crossposting from the /a/ thread a critique of Noble Red.

>The mistake was that the hospital raid should have been a failure (and first, before the concert): They should have shown up to retrieve the injured Mila and Vanessa should have said "Don't worry about it, I found a solution."

>Queue Fudo: He's pissed that his deniables are no longer deniable, but will directly supply them to if they help him accelerate his plan. He demands Mila's power and a noise attack to push Tsubasa into the position he wants. 

>Now she's put into the position of "kill 70k people if you want your family to survive." We now have the progression to put Noble Red up as desperate. Mila plays her role; Fudo provides the blood (Which he has sole access to because the 2nd is protecting all the supply in Japan)```
This, times 5000.
<:MikuSad:336657015961026560>



That's a script thing. Very common in all of fiction.
The material exists to be consumed, but you're right to criticize it for not being in the show. But it's a compromise made for a show without infinite episodes.
One of her most interesting traits is valuing people with real birthdays over herself, since she associates birthdays with happiness.
Kirika probably harbors some depressing thoughts.
Hibiki sorta does that.
Scaling that behavious back a few notches can make for a good character.
Imagine someone like <:HibikiWhoops:585839808115507222> sitting down to talk politics or deciding on a house loan. The character just fails if you put them into those scenarios.
It's this paradoxial ideal of interesting traits you tell yourself are great, but don't make a person.
You'd be dead!
Just think about how any seasonal waifu acts and imagine spending a week with them. <:TsubasaDisgust:349013662775902209>
I'm talking character actions, not anime attacks. <:ChrisAngry:336656958272700417>
It'd be fookin' weird.
Like, just take <:ChrisSmile:336656717553074176> . Have you ever seen someone act as blushy and wholesome?
Think about a few character archetypes and imagine just how weird it would be to see someone act like that.
People, on the other hand have shitty days, get depressed, act dumb and aren't as "special".
It's easy to see a character as the sum of their actions. So if you find a character who is all sunshine and rainbows, you can imagine that they're always like that.
The 2D VS 3D "argument" is sorta like that, yeah.
I guess the advice is: "Don't be a creep and enjoy all the good punches." <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
On a big enough scale, it is.
Quite.
I like the little mental block I have towards the Gears. Makes them easier to enjoy as characters over pieces of meat.
Everyone knows only Nana can do that. <:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
Gimme that yuri hentai ending of XV. <:MariaYell:336657352264646657>
And this is why context is important. <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
That too.
If we see the show as a musical, then it falls into place.
Nier is bananas and needs a competent editor. Preferably someone human.
<:ShirabeStare:582381430915596289>
Sorry, only 13 episodes, Mr. JRPG Writer-san.
Going by their hugging sprees, both are pretty genki. <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720> <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
TV shows are kinda screwed when it comes to their restricted runtime. Books, games and movies can usually squeeze in enough material to be complete.
No Maria without crying. <:MariaConfident:336657338729627658>
Aoi is disappointed in all of you.
"Short delay for next episode, it seems."
Short delay for next episode, it seems.

There has to be an original somewhere.
Good enough for my phone, but I don't know if there's bigger.
Better?

Sakura Trick was ridiculous. <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
If it's just the outfit, it wouldn't be too bad.
Well, I guess someone has to provide artists with money for food.
All commissioned by one guy, methinks.
This comic exists, yes.

Yes, "sleep". <:MikuGay:336656810788388864>

Oh yeah, Nana is in Death Stranding.
I knew that.
What, did she play Meryl or something?
The fact that she did Love Deterrence threw me for a lop.
I eagerly await more Nana in Kojima work.
Miku already killed people in G, right. Where's that guilt at? <:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
<:Germain:421434126856486912>
...but we did Rules of Nature already.
Not until her heroic sacrifice, of course. <:Cag:423197445644615711>
Well, there was episode 2.
Fool, <:CarolYandere:424047704826707980> will protect Elfnein just fine.
One would assume there would be one likeable scene per episode.
Sounds like someone needs a Happy Smile Vacation. <:ShirabeStare:582381430915596289>
Are <:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592> and <:MariaSunglasses:336656798687690752> the only ones with backing vocals?
Weeb. <:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
"Can I Ara Ara her? I think I can Ara Ara her."
I'm sure he'll have a lot to add.
Sorta relevant, though it should be Chris and Miku methinks.

I have a list though! <:MariaConfident:336657338729627658>
Over 100 on my list. <:HibikiWhoops:585839808115507222>

Wolverine has regrown from a single cell, so that'd work.
One hopes. <:ElfneinDrowning:336656417035517952>
I can see it.
The Tsubasa drama is gonna be some serious shit once it really starts.
There is a keyword about Ogawa's ninja family.
Other way around. He taught Tsubasa.
Not my problem. <:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
<#357682999300718592> is that way. <:GarieWink:336657101273169921>

I know it will, but not how.
No clue how that will pay off.
Seriously, what haven't they mentioned at this point in XV?
Also our contractual Kanade mention. <:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
It's a moment of weakness. <:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
🤘 regression
Tsubasa looks to Kanade for answers a lot.
In this setting, they sure are the only ones.
The target must not be under the influence of rice. <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
One of the three Custodians teased in AXZ?
Solopy and Nasu-verse? Perish the thought. <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>

Excalibur Maria versus mindcrazed Tsubasa, coming soon. <:MariaSunglasses:336656798687690752> <:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
Maria needs to learn from Hibiki if she wants to connect to Tsubasa.
Imagine if they used that as the fist of a giant robot. <:ElfneinWeld:586027421296492585>
It doesn't matter. <:ElfneinDrowning:336656417035517952>

We don't have 3 out of 26 episodes to spend on arm trauma.
That is not happening. It'd be retread of an event they somewhat subverted and there's no time.
The almighty scream that followed was awesome. <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
I 'member.
Mikugear.
I think death stole his compassion away when he was a baby, personally.
Yes, but please refrain from spamming a whole comic when the link is good enough.
Multi-posting in Discord shuffles the order. <:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
Stop using tiny versions of comics, Solopy. <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158> https://twitter.com/jyudo_fu/status/929009635704520707
That too.
Poorly communicated animation direction. <:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
Muscle Time?

Less so in the parents department. <:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
Many fictional people are in the looks department. <:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>

Thet's her subconscious gayness shining through.
Chris gets naked on camera so the others can gay in peace. What a hero. <:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
*Maybe.*
Silly billy, <:ChrisSmile:336656717553074176> is the only one that might be straight.
Oh yeah. Gaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay. <:MariaYell:336657352264646657>
Nothing gay to see here.
AXZ was hella gay.
We're getting a good hug, at the very least.
<:KirikaSpook:605209108827734017>
I'm still holding out for episode 13 being nothing but yuri fluff.
So, any bets on kisses? <:MariaConfident:336657338729627658>
Please, can we not talk about SAO? <:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
Did I listen to that already? <:HibikiWhat:336656482907193344>
So yeah, I could do without the creepy sex shit. <:GenjuurouThumbsUp:336657189475188740>
If we give Kaneko some credit, I think the deal with Carol is that she is sexually repressed so she can focus on revenge better. <:CarolStare:336656462287994882>
Right, Tiki and Adam too.
And then mister inspector in XV.
*Prelati* in AXZ, though that is just implied. <:TsubasaDisgust:349013662775902209>
Carol's loins in GX.
Ver and Chris' Armor Purge in G.
All of Finé in S1.
It's Symphogear, there's always creepy sex stuff. <:MariaShock:423196877354303498>
Maybe it was the S1 director?
More like that the person responsible got axed.
I've heard strange things about why they added the electro torture.
"whipeed "? Now there's a word.
As far as terrorism goes, *it's a lot of dead people.*
Kinda weird how Tsubasa is the only one still reeling from this massacre.
You don't have to spoiler it in here. <:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
And did you mean dwarves?
Write it up and post it in <#357682999300718592>
I'm only in a speculative mood after a new episode.
Moon. Heroes win.
"original god, do not steal"
Why would you even make that comparison?
Not even slightly.
~~It helps that it only takes some TsubaMaria instead of ending world hunger or something actually difficult.~~
<:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>

Someone rewrote episode 6.



Going under Solopy's wing is dark path. Be sure before you go.
Aha! Therin lies the rub.
Ok, you want the show to be about the Hibimiku wife team.
Wanting her to be useful, the EDM?
What is the Mikugear fixation about?
The gaybies are there for their mom when sword dad is being mean. <@!247701824335904770>
Why would a Geah game get localized?
Like we'd get that lucky.
I'm sorry Mr. solopy, but the Japanese console market is still shrinking and not even the high-grade musous rake in as good profit margins as XDU summer events. <:ElfneinDrowning:336656417035517952>
Where are my numbers and the guide on how much I can skip to catch up quickly?
But that's haaaaaaaaaaaaaaard.
True, but Nanoha does have more episodes to slot characters into.
A lot of characters are like that. Not everything is Jojo.
Something like that, yeah.
I guess? But the way the mcguffins are treated isn't really the same.
But beyond that, it's not a comparison worth making, especially as they serve their stories so differently.
They both choose who gets their power.
Not really, but thinking about it I see one small similarity.
<:CarolShock:430939013235474432>
<:ShirabeStare:582381430915596289>
I sense some bias in your statement.
Look, she's subtly acting like Carol. It's almost time. <:CarolYandere:424047704826707980>
Good format though. <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>

Also, Miku is a scorpio. <:HibiMikuCry:586026583870013455>
All came from the middle east?
It's here being put in the cocoon, so yes.
But usually they make mountains out of molehills describing the drama.
Ok, so that's cute and relevant.
Ohh, that.
A bit. What are you referring to specifically?
Anyone notice how all the cryptic bollocks Kaneko puts in the previews doesn't matter in the slightest? <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>

I was assuming as much anyway. Was just giving you a slight chance.

Raneaa, you are this close to jumping off the deep end into scary fanfiction.
Mind control isn't wholesome. <:KirikaSkeptical:586406806482583556>
<:ShirabeStare:582381430915596289>
Raneaa, Maria wouldn't use it to make Tsubasa kiss her thighs.
Fluff is good, but it's no foundation.
And I meant that as more of a dig at taking the easy way out in a story.
*Shhhh*
I appreciate everyone's enthusiasm, but having your characters undress to solve their problems just isn't sustainable in the long run.
Previews always lie to us. If they show drama, it's fake and if it shows happiness, it won't last. <:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
The blush is promising though.
Chris college season when? <:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>

It's logic is **FIST**. <:Germain:421434126856486912>
But teasing you with inspiration is a guiltless crime. <:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
It's fine, she always has 8038 or so ideas for art.
Reminder that Hibiki rejects being Edge!Bikki in her XV transformation. <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
Bikki should be 17 and Chris is 18.

Here's a comic about when Carol made Garie: https://www.pixiv.net/member_illust.php?mode=medium&illust_id=76318625

Using jojo terms. <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I've seen people being unable to accept the singing too.
What the Symphogear fanbase lacks in numbers, it makes up for with hype. <:MariaConfident:336657338729627658>
She's somehow even deeper than Tsubasa when singing. <:KirikaMegane:585848185847676939>

What a childish mindset. <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
That, and wanting to remain as she was when the world betrayed her.
My theory of her being sexually repressed remains.
We'll see if she ages up during the epilogue or something.

You mean Ver?
With only 6 episodes left, who has time for Ver? <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I can see them doing it, but I'd much rather they focus on Carol and set off the Basa Bomb. <:MichaWhat:336657148627124225>
Wasn't the Nephilim arm mention enough? <:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>

Elfnein didn't sleep for all of AXZ.
"Very cute, but a hopeless coffee addict."
We believe in Elfnein!
It's more than I expected for Elfnein.
Even if Carolnein jobs really fast, there isn't room for much more Elfnein focus.
What I wrote.
``Never trust a machine to do a human's job.``
<:CarolStare:336656462287994882>
That you can't spell my name correctly?
Wait... <:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
There's barely enough screentime left for her to be useless in.
But now no one can call her useless. <:KirikaMegane:585848185847676939>
Well duh. Episode 7 was only part of it.
Yes, she'll die in one or two episodes. The plot is stuffed as is.
Going over a lot of "reference material" are we? <:TonyEyeRoll:580561912513691679>
Or the ears of your neighbours.
Maybe every episode in the second half will make us crap our proverbial pants. <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Well, **the return of Carol** is probably a sign of things to come.
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
Great...
Promise me to never write anime. <:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
I can see that.
Yes.
You'll get your MariaBasa stuff Raneaa, no need to worry. <:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
Having Elfnein land the final blow would be rad.
Not really. I expected a quick jump to Carol.

>Badbasa fights Maria
>Maria just throws down her weapon and ungears allowing Tsubasa to stab her in the shoulder or some non vital area
>This emotional shock somehow counters the old one and her geass shatters and as her consciousness regains Tsubasa's eyes fill with tears as she openly cries how sorry she is and Maria just smiles (While slightly jammed) that it's fine and pats Tsubasa's check and gently wipes the tears from her eyes. She tells Tsubasa that she's sorry too. And that she's not alone. And gives her a warm hug.
>From behind them, however comes a cold cruel voice. "Worthless Sakimori. If you will not be my blade then you have no worth at all." Fudo viciously states. Tsubasa is taken slightly aback but looks into Maria's eyes. Maria who still smiles. Maria who believes in her. Maria who loves her.

I wonder how silly Noble Red will be in the XV OVAs.
I've forgotten the context for this, but it's still hilarious:
I meant Raneaa, but fun to see you both excited.
You just leech on videos about Japanese actresses goofing off, don't you? <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Oh yeah.
Well, going by the concerts it means something to everyone in the main cast.
My bet is that she's incredibly busy, always jumping on projects.
The whole "Nana Wills It" thing rings a bit hollow otherwise.
I'd hope so.
You'd think she'd talk about it somewhere.
Huh, now there's something to think about.
```
>third song on the lasting song CD is called "IF THE WORLD HAD A SONG", which will be a cover of the emiko shiratori song, which is based of bach.

>lyrics are about how songs can make the world a more peaceful place
>interviewer points out how this fits really well with chris

```
There was an anon talking about that song.
<:HibikiOhNo:586337444597596202>
Ayahi confirmed to actually be Hibiki.
```
Ayahi tried writing her own lyrics all the way back in 2010 already, for the bonus song to her first single

>hasn't done it since and was sure she wasn't cut out for it
>9 years later she's writing the ED lyrics for the final symphogear season
>has to convince her producer that she should read the plot in advance like nana, he thinks it isn't a good idea because she's too invested in chris after 7 years and the ED could end up being to focused on her or another character, does it anyway

Quite.

I will have non of this tragedy nonsense. Gimme fluff.
Things can go in so many ways at this point.
But seeing as they are more victims of the illuminati and not proper members like I thought, I guess it's not surprising.
Man, Noble Red are so bad at doing things.
This amuses me. <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>

Sometime after XV, Miku is just gonna lock the door to their bedroom and tell her. <:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>

She has talked about it multiple times, even. <:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>

It wasn't a miracle of any kind. It was just the natural course of action for knights to rush to their lord when they were needed.
 
Their hearts were beyond human.
 
Even if their power could not reach the same levels as in the past, they had no hesitation or dissatisfaction when fulfilling their master's orders.

Episode 12?
Rewatch the part when Adam talks about it at the end.
The outline suggested three.
Not Digimon, the ones teased in AXZ. <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
The Custodian trio still isn't here, ya know.
And with Kaneko being who he is, I can't say I'm surprised.
It's like a surprise extra final dungeon.
I love having a secret season within the last season! <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
So, since episode 8, is "XV", then 9 should be the "normal ending". Then for 10 we're going to the moon to suplex Custodians! <:HibikiEager:407398049531559937>

The Daedalus End maze is as long as the distance to the moon.

We got no MILFnein, but I think this was done by Carol to be more respectful of Elfnein.
"All right, who has been squatting in my place for the last few days and is ready to get genocided?"
I have for Friday and Sunday too, if you want.

Standard, for reference:
Already here:
Seems about right. The show is gonna shift after Miku Gear is dealt with at the very least.
...they built up Miku as the host. She's gonna be the host for a while.
I like the hydra fight in AXZ myself. So many keyframes. <:MikuBliss:336657233712513024>

*We're removing brakes we didn't even know existed.*
It's like it's an "echo" of the rest of the show. <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
But a big part of XV's impact is in its callbacks.
Can't argue with that.
"Hey it's me, Shem-Ha! Man, being back in the world sure is great! At least I thought so, but suddenly I'm surrounded by weirdos and in big trouble! Next on Symphogear XV: Instead of Heiki Hecchara it's ***CHA-LA! Don't miss it!"

Maria's dress is haunted too.
That edit is great.
I liked her in AXZ though. <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>

Please redeem her, XV. <:HibikiEager:407398049531559937>

You really have to heat the knife before you twist it, don't you?
Maybe it's Nijiiro no Flügel hiding somewhere.
I've heard this too.
Yeah, that's weird.
They've been using her well so far.
You  just can't expect that, WFC.
Broadcast dimming! <:ChrisAngry:336656958272700417>
That reminds me, I have the Symphonia anime to watch. <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
The Castle defense system fight was just a JRPG thing, ok? <:ElfneinDrowning:336656417035517952>
Also, reminder to everyone: If Kanade returns, do not ping WFC! <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
Symphogear would be a lot more fun if everyone was allowed to live and be happy, but that robs it of some of its best moments.
XV is gonna be the end of me. <:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
I assumed it was either troubled somehow, or they're pumping even more resources into it.
No, the one in June.
<:HibikiEager:407398049531559937>
They seem to be on schedule now and I really hope they can stick the landing on this space ship.
Ok, so ignoring the preview pics, have we seen any traces of production issues relevant to the delay?
I'm so glad these are a thing.
So, 50/50 on Fudou taking off his shirt and being as ripped as Kenshiro?
It's Symphogear, why would you ever expect otherwise?
Ver was mentioned already. Well, his arm was. <:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>

Ok, that's the final form of the show figured out. That was easy. <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>

Eh, comics are allowed to be of lower quality than full pieces.
You should doodle a comic of that, Raneaa. <:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
I'm sure Tsubasa will have to tell her things in bed.
Basa better get to do some really good stuff after all this.
She still has to deal with her betrayal towards the others, so that's half of next episode. <:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>

I assume they'll  have Shem-ha blow up the estate and leave, then we deal with Tsubasa, have a montage and then set up the next cliffhanger.
It won't.
Come on now, it'll only be half the episode.
You just want her to step on you. <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>

If we just imagine her being on the team, how close to DMJii would the Hibimiku interactions be?
Having the wife team kick ass all day would be fun, but how much substance would be lost?
Then the character bloat would be even worse to boot.
I always hear that sentiment, but the show wouldn't be the same if she had been easily converted into a normal user without any complications in GX.
Kaneko is a nerd, more news at 11.

I finally caught up. <:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>

Has some different fight scenes and stuff.
Yep. Parallel thing to season 1 to boot.
And thank god for that. <:KirikaSmug:607742561414676517>
<:MariaSunglasses:336656798687690752>
"Tsubasa."
"Your queen orders you to assume position."
Look at this bastard. She's ready to fight god.
*Just imagine how smug she looks while doing this*
I mean, look what smug Maria can do with just a finger! <:HibikiShock:336656371611074580>
Smug Maria is very powerful, which is why she must be contained through constant bullying. <:ElfneinWeld:586027421296492585>
<:ShirabeStare:582381430915596289>
🚰
In Symphogear, it's more that Hibiki doesn't even try to talk to the male villains.

The heck are you up to? <:HibikiWhat:336656482907193344>
The fuck are you on, Solopy? <:TsubasaPeek:623246193002151938>
<:ShirabeStare:582381430915596289>
Leave that for the shitty spin-off.
You're living in Switzerland, you could probably get a custom Maria-themed one. <:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
<:KirikaSmug:607742561414676517>
**YES**

Maybe you shouldn't read them then. <:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
Could you take brexit talk to <#336297840529899522> ?
Oh no, we could get Symphogear imitators. <:ChrisShock:620077681484103680>
It'll get us a small fizzle in the zeitgeist, at least.
5 years for me, I think. <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
That's not happening. There are 40 minutes of Geah left. No more, no less.
The cliffhanger will be awesome, not devastating. <:ShirabeStare:582381430915596289>
<:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
I foresee Chris/Bikki duet -> NR making a bridge to Earth -> Shem-ha battle on top of Yggdrasil.
Anyways, back to the episode.
<:TsubasaSmug:585839805737467920>
Well, it was the summer slam episode. <:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>

Ridiculous. My Japanese is impeccable. <:KirikaSmug:607742561414676517>
"We will make god see the gay light and she can't stop us."
Alternatively, "Big Song of the Warrior Women of Yore". <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
That's just "Zesshou".
Yes, "leaked".

This is a Christian server. <:TonyEyeRoll:580561912513691679>
No crimes! <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
We need to hit that Big Bang Bonus. <:MariaConfident:336657338729627658>
They need to top S1, or this will have been all for naught. <:KirikaMegane:585848185847676939>
But I'll accept the most arduous 7 day wait ever. <:KirikaShout:607741871703457812>
Melua, I don't like your tone. <:KirikaSkeptical:586406806482583556>
I need it. I really do. C'mon XV, be awesome enough to bring me to tears. <:HibikiEager:407398049531559937>
I REQUIRE XV episode 12 to have a better ending than this: https://youtu.be/tth8RBM0Ol8
We'll get an ending, you naysayers! <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
I get the explanation, it just seemed random.

<#357682999300718592> is that way. <:HibikiOhNo:586337444597596202>
I'm gonna need you to list out all her mecha references later, Melua.
Just maybe. <:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
They had vague plans for an ending all along.
The hell are you on about? <:KirikaSkeptical:586406806482583556>

<:HibikiEager:407398049531559937>
```
"It will mark the arrival of an era where the Lulu Amelu can speak the true language and build the future with their own hands. Transcending the past."

Now that the Curse has been lifted, the gears are capable of even more than before. Shem-Ha isn't the only one to benefit.
```
```
"If a person became capable of using the Superb Song without any repercussions, and could freely wield the power hidden within sacrists…

…it would be proof that they have been released from the curse that the custodians put upon us in the distant past."
```
```
However... way back in s1 ep7, Fine had a line that really didn't mean very much to anyone back then, but now it means a lot! It's essentially a prophecy about how XV would turn out, looking back on it. This was after Hibiki grabbed Durandal and it became clear she was special.
```
https://twitter.com/zoidzero1/status/1175594002546118657
I think they said all they wanted to say about Maria's past.
It's very much an <:HibikiAAA:620079684109205534> episode.
Oh no, she's hot.
Either let it end, or it'll become as drawn out as One Piece. <:TonyEyeRoll:580561912513691679>
How nice of Symphogear to give Voyuer someone to thirst over at the end. <:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
Ehh...topic. <:ShirabeWhisper:620073899001905153>
Raneaa, stop hanging around vanilla normies. <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Aww. <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
Be the change you wish to see in the world, Raneaa. <:GarieWink:336657101273169921>
I think it's funny. https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/601872369660854272/625078736487710731/xv_12_carolnein.jpg
I meant really thirsty fanfics, yeah. <:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
I feel like everyone here has horny energy that needs to be disspelled in <#357682999300718592> <:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>

NO ORCA, NO WAFFLES <:MariaYell:336657352264646657>
<:MariaYell:336657352264646657>
NO
~~I was just trying to get use out of that for once.~~
Now, can we stop? <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>

Lewd warning:
They really want us to forget the mass murder, dont they? <:ShirabeStare:582381430915596289>
Man, what a freak. <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
This will be Shem-ha at the end of XV:
Topic, please. <:ShirabeWhisper:620073899001905153>
~~Man, I wish each season had 18 episodes.~~
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Exactly!
Either do that, or have everyone actually acknowledge what a horrific tragedy it was.
Make everyone's actions easier to swallow.
Still, the show could have cranked down the kill count and have it affect Maria too.
*Allegedly.*
What, a secret season 0? <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
C'mon, use the full thing.
Well, she probably blew up that copy.
She'll turn into a Wild Arms boss at the very least.
Don't we have 4 songs left? Or is that just a broad guess?
I'm nothing but a fake fan, it seems. <:ChrisShock:620077681484103680>
Alan?
I think I'll blame METANOIA for not getting me hyped enough.
Uh yeah, bookending is a thing.
At this point,  all we can hope for is 13 being full of their prettiest explosions. <:HibikiEager:407398049531559937>
SING <:HibikiEager:407398049531559937>
You wish.
Anime™
Giant Geah robot! <:Germain:421434126856486912>
<:KirikaShout:607741871703457812>
Both of them could work in a new story if you give them some new personal goals, separate from eachother.
Other way around, yo.
I could deal with a DMJii spinoff if they give them new material.
Just
We barely have enough material for arcs this season.
Whatever happens later won't be a season 6. <:ElfneinDrowning:336656417035517952>
Kinda? The show is a bit special.
We shouldn't be surprised. Geah villain against Geah villain is just asking for horny interactions. <:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
Sure.
Ogawa sounded so cute when he thanked his brothers.
So, how long will XDU be left on life support?
But please don't kill Elfnein too. <:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
Carol will give them a decent opening at least.
The music is good, dawg. <:KirikaSkeptical:586406806482583556>
"Welcome to the team, rookie."
~~She'll be a christmas cake in the spinoff season.~~
Our little muffin won't be a muffin anymore. <:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
Going by that logic, Elfnein will become as smug as <:CarolSmug:617040484111745027> when she gets older.
If you punch in a ~~straight~~ gay line, you win. <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
⛄
Wouldn't you put in 110% if you had Elfnein as a coworker?
She's good for morale, dammit. <:ElfneinDrowning:336656417035517952>
*There she goes with the coffee grinder and key to the pantry again.*
~~Ok, maybe she developed a cute relationship with Tomosato and Fujitaka as well.~~
Elfnein's existance at SONG has been nothing but research, coffee and One Piece. I wont accept anything else. <:ElfneinWeld:586027421296492585>
<:ElfneinBullying:421432763078410241> <:CarolSmug:617040484111745027>
This is dumb, but I love the fanon that Carol burned away Elfnein's memories of One Piece filler during XV.
No, Shem-ha will be exposed to the rampant gayness between Hibiki and Miku and just surrender. <:KirikaSmug:607742561414676517>
GX miniarcs? Sure. <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Imagine. <:MikuBliss:336657233712513024>

Fun detail from the subreddit:

<:KirikaShout:607741871703457812>
Edge finds a way.
Are you just a Lovecraft protagonist? Cursed by curiosity?
I'm getting Big Order flashbacks from this. <:CarolBlush:617039657896509460>
If you really wanna reach, there's also Iguchi during the Live concert. <:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
Which is fun, but wrong.
That's just our fanon.
I'm not! <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>

Not that fetish again. <:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
The way I see it, Miku is gonna escape and help Hibiki win after the other Gears soften up Shem-ha a bit.
Rad. Also dumb. Thanks, capitalism. <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
This place gets hornier by the day. <:KirikaSkeptical:586406806482583556>

Oh god, they have a system. <:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
Please reword that statement.
Everyone already picked their favorites among the many frames of XV?
You'll get like at least a minute of Carol.
Of course you are.

*Official art!* <:Germain:421434126856486912>

Ah yes, the fanart that's explicitly not a keyframe cut from XV.
You'll get them joking about how gay Hibiki and Miku are and you'll like it.

Heck yeah! <:Germain:421434126856486912>

But the second half is so energetic!
Are those even official?
She is very much the team pet.
Would be nice if they could get her an identity and a place to live outside the sub though.
Well, the work load is bound to be lighter.
<:ElfneinBullying:421432763078410241>
Aside from her crippling addiction to coffee and One Piece.
John Wayne is one reference and Vercingetorix is another.

I think it's gonna be at least 3 skits.
But I don't wanna forget it. <:ChrisEnraged:423196924368388105>
Except that they love big headpieces.
Just for the scene itself, it represented the threat of the Custodians.
Methinks that was vague on purpose.
<:TsubasaDisgust:349013662775902209>

Topic, please.


I prefer Kirby. <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>

Yeah, you'd need to be "overbrave" to do it. <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Undergears would be a brave cosplay.

There is Super Heroine Chronicle, XDU and two fangames.

We all know Kaneko only wrote more Geah to make dumb wordplay.
Ah, thanks.

And I thought it meant Miku.

Yeah, Symphogear is extremely Japan-centric, end of XV nonwithstanding.

Didn't Kaneko say that it was so that the animators didn't get overworked?
<:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
Animation production is a mess.

You sure? She is the edgy goofball. <:KirikaSmug:607742561414676517>

Stuff from the radio:

>they're recording the shinais already, ayahi expected a episode to be "troublesome" for a seiyuu because its "troublesome" for the character
>Ayahi finally realized Iguchi is the straight man to her own madness after the last livestream
>Both of them really want to put Ayahi's old man voice impression into XDU somehow, watch out for any old men appearing in the story because they might actually be mad enough to let Ayahi do a few lines
>A twenty year old viewer nicknamed "yuuki yuuna" wrote in about how he totally didn't just join the JDF because he wanted to be a cool sakimori like tsubasa

A few more hours Dino, you can do it. <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Probably. Would be weird otherwise.
And so it was, that the scrappy underdog Symphogear ended its fifth season to a mostly pleased audience. <:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
Wasn't amazing either, but 22 minutes isn't a lot.
I'm so glad the ending wasn't a trashfire. <:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>

They pushed their luck far enough by announcing two seasons at once.
<:KirikaShout:607741871703457812>
Brain, hurry up and forget details about the seasons so I can be excited about rewatching.
Try some other anime and get back to Geah later.
If you overindulge in it, it'll become boring. <:KirikaSmug:607742561414676517>

Good going, me! <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I still remember when I was at church as a child and just wasn't sold on the whole thing, even rejecting a children's bible.
You should print out a bible and take a piss on it 3 times a month instead. <:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
Well, A LOT better.
Hopefully, Japan treats you a bit better.
You have my sympathy.
Madness. Just, madness.
Cuz Jesus is cool, and the rest is just annoyingly written.
Tell me, how poorly did they "read" the bible at Jesus camp?
~~~Ignoring the fact that he flipped the tables of merchants~~
Just like Jesus would've done. <:MariaConfident:336657338729627658>
Tru dat WFC, I still don't get...basically everything to do with taxes and housing.
THE WAR ECONOMY SHALL RISE AGAIN
And expensive to the point of ridicule. <:GarieWink:336657101273169921>
It's what I'm betting on! <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Oh, that short. <:MichaWhat:336657148627124225>
That was...simple. Sitcoms lied to me! <:MariaYell:336657352264646657>
Do you just go to LA normally?
Wait, what's the excuse for the road trip then?
I do not. <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
I can be handsome if I try. <:Cag:423197445644615711>
The heresy came afterwards. <:GarieWink:336657101273169921>
<@!225771411833225216> I meant that young men wasted so much time on it that it became a logistical concern.
Religion being the easiest way to keep young men from masturbating *all the time* and help out in the fields. <:GarieWink:336657101273169921>
We all know religion and war stem from dudes being in love with their dicks. <:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
Yay? <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Also, wrong channel for this. <:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
Y'all gonna make her blush into overdrive.

The quest for infinite access to tiddy continues. <:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
Such a...good loop.
Kinda...hypnotic.
But you gotta be careful, I her swinging tears at the tissue.
Close enough. <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I think I've seen someone that feels like you.

That sounds like a better deal.
That sounds like a bad deal.
Hrrrrrrrrrrrrrtt <:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>

Kids are shit anyway.
Huh. The earth thanks you, Kriisa.
Slowly. <:GarieWink:336657101273169921>
Just a point of severe annoyance in case things go awry. <:Cag:423197445644615711>
I may be isolated, but damn if I missed magical girls.

**RIGHT?**
Everyone here has watched Twintail, right? <:HibikiWhat:336656482907193344>

That sucks, but it'll recover fast. <:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
<:MariaSunglasses:336656798687690752>
It's supposed to convey awesomeness over you not breaking anything.

Oh wow, good luck Vi. <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
The majority of communication is non-verbal. <:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
Gay is mostly a descriptive term.
Insults are generic, slurs are not. <:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
Kewl. But I knew that much. <:GarieWink:336657101273169921>
So calling Ibu a limey is ok. <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Gorgonzola? <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I have negative connotations with tranny. Also, I just saw trap being used on Reddit. <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
I'll let my motto do the talking. "Context is king." <:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
Do I have to get into this slap fight? <:HibikiWhat:336656482907193344>
What's a Gyo? <:HibikiWhat:336656482907193344>
Y'll better read his manga about the thing that washed ashore. <:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
Junji Ito style? <:MariaShock:423196877354303498>
This could really work as an SCP, R.
Uncontained and with a sense of humor.
SCP, calling it now.
I got this one! <@!102691114762371072>
Good thing I just lurk and steal Symphogear memes. <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Yeah, but the unwritten motto is "Be  as bad as you can to try and scare away people". <:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
Has there been research done on the place?
Just...the gall of the place is fascinating.
4chan is a real lose-lose scenario, I apologize.
Criticism taken, latooni.
But what kind of friend would I be then?
I could quote it and ruin your day.<:GarieWink:336657101273169921>
Natural 20 in fuckassery, one might say. <:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
Well yeah, but it was rather hardhitting. It's a cumulative thing.
<:TsubasaDisgust:349013662775902209>
No, that's all I can take, the rest of the year will be above my limit.
There's my yearly dose of transphobia from 4chan. <:ShirabePout:336656831978012712>
I've heard the fluff is supposed to give you room to have a bit fun and round out your education.
So, point fluff?
What's electives?
<:ElfneinBullying:421432763078410241>
And the US is even worse!
Madness.
Have all the proper adults in the world actually survived this?
The system is *technically* fair.
Just one left...
I've never had that, but I've failed some I've barely worked back.

The program was so much nicer. <:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
Chosing your own classes sucks when you have to fight with everyone else.
I just got answers from college. If I just fix a coding project, I'll have access to enough classes this fall.
BE HONEST!

Why don't you donate some of them then?
Well, I'm not a native English speaker. As such, I can parse pieces of words easier.
Genderfluid *still* sounds icky. Is there no alternative phrase?
Find a pond. 🐸
Wow, doing that is bad enough, but to do it unprovoked at a stranger is extra dumb.
Saki, Ibu and Ravenclaw.
Ok, 3 then. <:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>

Cert program? Is that school?
So now I know two people who need money to escape their mom. ☹
(Even though there was no exclamation point, you hack.)
Boldness of exclamation noted.
Is it extra super pricey?
She's not even living in Japan. <:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
I think she's jealous. <:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
You know, I always joke to <@166040595465240576> about how he has to die to appease corporate America, but damn.
Ok, my dad hates fun as well, but I doubt he'd go that far.
Wait, what?!?

*Oh noes*
Well, you do live in America. <:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
Seriously, jobs are hard nowadays. People her age are still employed!
Uggggggggggggggh
I haven't seen you kick puppies.

Is it the gacha? I bet it's the gacha.
The *wrong crowd*.
We are a *bad influence*.
Oh yeah.

My dad does that too, especially at night or during dinner time.

Well aren't you lame then, Saki. <:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>

Turning it into an investment is just mean.

The US/Russia situation.

Ya got any tiddies yet? <:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
Maybe cliché is the better term.
The trans dream. Wooooo...
I think I understand better now, at least.
Snipping all connections?
Got any more light to shed on your situation, Saki? I don't think I understand what you're planning.
Oh wait, fingernail cleaner.
Acetone, really?
I just think it's silly to move out before you have steady employment and a decent hoard of dosh.
Give me like 4 years.
...did you find new parents each time? How does this work?
You sure you can endure escaping?
That did happen, but Saki's great escape is a greater concern of mine.
Good luck! <@102691114762371072>

Ok, that thread was a trashfire. I forgot just how awul the internet is.
And the Finé person has a god complex!
OH GOD, THEY PICKED ON CHRIS-CHAN!
Why must you do this to me, 4chan? They linked to a thread where someone tried to emotionally exploit someone for money while roleplaying as Finé.
See, I try. <:GarieWink:336657101273169921>
Hence the change. <:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
Best of luck at any rate.

Ye. Was fun.
I think you told me about it once, Saki.
I just love my beard. <:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
Got games to play.
I've barely given it thought. <:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>

Aww. Hit me up when you do!
That can get complicated.
Hmm...
Well...what are you making?
<:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
User Interface. Many programs have them.
Hell, fiddle with UI if that's needed.
Start smol.
Well yeah, but think what you need for a minimum viable product.
Then open up an editor and put something into the main function.
I try to fix a feature per session and not leave things more broken than when I started.
Take it a bit at a time. That's how I roll.
It just means you might have some extra tools to deal with it.

Note: Not actually me.

I just have one big spoon. And school is the only thing that consumes it. <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>

Don't do it.
Very likely.

I could drink to that. <:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
Cuz of your family, or what?
Roll of the dice, pal. <:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
Well, depends on how they act, I suppose.
Furries are ok.
I haven't ever interacted with one, but I don't think i would be able to accept them.
Wait, are you trans of some description, Latooni?
Lol no, capitalist slop to the core.
That's a decent template.
You reminded me of Chex Quest.
I feel like that deserves a photoshop of some description.

I could've done anything I have access too, like basic economics, but I picked more CS.
So now for year 3, we get 5 courses to choose ourselves.
Getting there.
Lotta logic, a bit of math...
Hard CS with C, softer stuff with Java.
We've had a really diverse set of courses.
I picked the Computer Science program and I've been stuck to it for 2 years.
If we're moving school talk here, I might as well give deets on my Uni experience.
Nice.
I'm pretty happy all around, and I'm not letting that go.
No one who cares about you would want you to feel bad.
I guess. But don't guilt your way into unhappiness if you can avoid it.
Seems like it is.
Isn't that a bad thing to have?
Man, that's like easy mode. <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>

Ehh...gimme a bit.
A friend treating him like a human kept him from the edge.
I posted a TED talk here earlier on this subject. It was about a would-be shooter.
Sorry. I'm just convinced the shooters have incredibly poor judgement.
Oh yeah, that's also a thing. Shooters becoming famous.
My money's on something absurdly dumb that should've been resolved with water balloons.
Is this when we make bets on the motive?
Well, duh. Evolution is slow and our lizard brains remain strong.
Just screaming " the nazis did it!" Isn't my style. <:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
I don't know if it's respect per say, but whenever big stuff flares up and I get confused about who's right, I always want to take it down to a person by person basis.
Respect is nice.
Hell, I'd barely endure it even if they doubled the word limit once more.
Pretty sure the shittyness of Twitter's design is to blame for many things.
Oh yeah, that has twisted people.

My grad job application needs a CV and a personal letter. It's like they actually expect me to be an adult.
I do feel a strange aura around queer folk. Very defensive and proud. Maybe I'm not used to people actually showcasing emotion.
I try, but I also like keeping my tongue sharp, friendliness be damned.
I don't really understand the sentence.
Also, what did you mean by "Kerrik always means right, just sometimes you can end up being too cautious that you make mistakes"? <@284390402210136064>
Oh yeah, the bi nymphomania stereotype.
I hear the bi people have it rough.

*Only sign the documents if you mean it!* <:MariaYell:336657352264646657>
This soap opera is ridiculous. <:ElfneinBullying:421432763078410241>
Gee, standard socializing sounds terrible.
This story lost me. Good job nonetheless. <:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
This sounds like an exhausting adventure.
Then you're in a lazy mindset! <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Are you overworked perhaps?
Deets! <:MariaYell:336657352264646657>
<:CarolShock:430939013235474432>
Yikes.
The drama keep piling on.
Ohh.
*streetwalkin'*
...no matter how many adventures you get up to.
Saki, your life isn't a 90s TV show. <:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
Ohh, left as in abandoned.
<:HibikiWhat:336656482907193344>
Could you please rephrase the question?
<:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
Didn't think you'd ask for life advice here during work hours.
🍿
Go ahead.
I lack info and perspective over here.
And this friend is key? Or could you try someone else?
What do you want, exactly?
...violence isn't a good start. Or end, for that matter.
Now, what is this hit in the head thing?
😅
I thought you meant your last friend.
I might go vegeterian. Anyone got any decent recipes?
Heh. 😅
Oatmeal, anyone?
One would probably need to take over the planet. <:ShirabePout:336656831978012712>
Hell, luxury products probably need to go down the drain.
No meat, no planes, no gas...
And as a society, we need to change just about everything.
India, China and the US are the largest influencers.
It's possible, but many industries need to die yesterday.

I think we need to cut emissions in half by 2030 and eliminate them by 2050.
Easy peasy.
Gotta start somewhere. All I have to do is change the minds of every man, woman and child in Sweden.
<:ShirabePout:336656831978012712>
The UN climate report has spoken to me. I am tempted cast my apathy aside and dedicate the next decade to becoming a local enviromentalist of sorts. There's a lot of changes to be made.
I'm still fine, but it's only a matter of time. At least it's a good education.
And I'm not even trying to get a medical degree!
Still boggles the mind how many have endured this.
I keep myself warm with the idea of things slowing down, but I am so out of there next semester.
<:ElfneinDrowning:336656417035517952>
Hey, my turn. Methinks school has put me into extended crunch mode.
Also, topic.
Twice.
Wait...Stroheim!
...Pillar men being gross? Satanic imagery?
Can you get work done in tiny chunks, Rakhi? I always make sure to sit until progress is made, however tiny.
It sure sucks in university as well. <:ElfneinBullying:421432763078410241>
You can work to change that.
Or at least a girl who'll love and respect you.
We should WELCOME people who don't procreate.
Please show your parents data on overpopulation.

Sorry, Jesus before your children. It's in the book.
Crazy talk.
Yeah, those 13 hours? I'm supposed to spend 20 a WEEK.
I had fun today, but my other course ate up too much time. They're balanced poorly time-wise.
Yeah, go me...
...too bad we also need a server. <:ShirabePout:336656831978012712>
But hey, I basically wrote a chat client in a day. <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
It's just my everything that's tired.
Fine, since I haven't used my laptop on the bus in ages.
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
Kids, don't code for 12-13 hours in a day.
Geez, Saki. <:ShirabeEmbarassed:336657288477671436>
Because laws, hopefully.
That grading sounds ridiculous. You're supposed to teach a thing and pass those that learn enough of that thing. None of that other crap.
It's a delicate game to play. To exploit your hateful parents until you can survive without them.
<@!102691114762371072> Can probably offer some pointers.
Yeah, therein lies the rub.
Just listen to Jesus and disregard the posers. <:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>

You'd hope giant acts of arson would wake you up.
Nowadays, you really can't have any other excuse, since it's so easy to learn.
It's a bizarre thing. Maybe people just turn a blind eye out of fear of reality.
I feel ya, I'm on the 3rd year in college and it's grinding me down. <:ElfneinDrowning:336656417035517952>
I haven't kept up, but the internet is only angry for so long.
That's one plus.
Getting your stuff? What's the situation?
Huh? <:HibikiWhat:336656482907193344>
Something tells me your uncle won't take kindly to the act.
Everything well?
Well, stay safe. You're on a dangerous path.
Get all your money, important documents and stuff?
That's something. But I don't know what you should do to prepare.
Speak to them. Try to arrange something.
Do you have any other family to rely on?
I'm not sure of what else to say.
Monstrous.
Of course there was reason. He's awful.
Happiness isn't bound to a girl.
Well, he's wrong for starters.
Ah.
What is up, save for the internet thing?
Not good.
How bad are things?
Really? Please explain further.
And ask for advice from others here with more experience than me on these matters.
Prisoners usually get to live. I'd advice that you cool off and plan things out for at least a day.
<@188714906143424513> Are you really gonna do fine running away right now?

Attaboy. Be honest on interviews. And hope you don't get interviewed by HR.
How is that turning out?
Oh yeah, the lab assistant thing.
You can't just abbreviate an abbreviation. <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
Also, what field?
gz? <:HibikiWhat:336656482907193344>
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
It's basically a 2-month long interview for a job there. Or at the very least a guaranteed letter of recommendation for somewhere else.
<:KirikaGay:336657049540755457>
I got a graduation-job spot at a tech company!
No?
Yeah, decent time to sleep if you're rambling.
Going by my clock math, you should probably have some sleep.
Well, what do you know. What's Boss' trans girl army count at now? 8?
I hope you feel welcome, Aila. <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>

And you should know more about English than I do. <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
Not at all, ya silly goose.
...or are you only suppose to use that phrase in regards to men? English can't be that restrictive. <:HibikiWhat:336656482907193344>
I still don't get it. The content of the heart isn't gender-specific and you're a girl last time I checked.

Well no, absolute good and bad is not a thing.
What are you trying to say? That the option of change is bad?
Thank you for not using "noone". <:ElfneinDrowning:336656417035517952>

Yeah, why can't y'all be pro-archery instead?
...It's the aiming that's the sport. <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
You could get away with just using BB guns for target shooting.
Good on ya for being resonable, Saki.
Yeah, but for those countries in particular.
I wonder if you can trace back many of the things that define the US and Japan today to World War 2.
Again, it's a culture thing. Very difficult to change.
Right, the trans erasure thing. That has to sting.
This is getting above my head. There has to be something about the culture I don't get as an outsider.
I haven't really had unfair teachers even.
I realise more and more how lucky I am with the people I get to interact with.
Nihilism hour, is it? <:ElfneinDrowning:336656417035517952>
I don't follow, Sketch.
Yeah. And it has a Resident Evil 2 crossover on mobile. <:CarolShock:430939013235474432>
And this is when we could learn something. <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
No way. <:ElfneinDrowning:336656417035517952>

Uggh. That'll derail anyone.
Sounds like a complex situation.
Any catalyst for thinking her UK friends don't care about her?
Sounds messy.
Are you just mad at the injustice of tax evasion, Yorin, or do you not like paying for a mutual service?
If it gets better, I'll retract my statement.
Obviously.
No one deserves American health care. <:ElfneinDrowning:336656417035517952>
Not sure what counts as a social place in Japan though.
Or go to someplace social and ask people after hanging out a little while.
I'd say get to know someone first, but straight up asking can work.
Racism is rare at our table.  <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Note: I am not lgbtq+. I just meant how they raised me in general.
One hopes lgbtq+ fear will become less common.
Man, I should offer thanks to my parents for being mostly decent.

I can admit to that.
Self-important, you mean?
Don't see any limeys watching our police drama and camping movies.
Which is why we import so much. <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
Honestly, culture from across the various ponds is so much more fun.
I hear people go clubbing and some other stuff?
<:ElfneinDrowning:336656417035517952>

No, English has too many. <:ElfneinBullying:421432763078410241>
*Ignorant Swede defence*
Sorry, kinda the same word to me.
There are probably books on this.
Which is strange, but also interesting from an identity point of view.
Always seemed like a wish-fulfillment thing in the guise of animal appreciation.
I hear that furries with fox fursonas see themselves as sly. I wonder how correct that is and how many are just in love with the idea.

Not sure about cows though. Tiddies? <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>

Same. Slept all the way to 07:00 today.

At least call them people.
Not liking that language.
Always aim to be better.
This is sounding more and more like you're gonna do something terrible.
Or written a navigation AI?
Or learned Bluetooth on your own in like half a week?

You do not plan at that timescale.
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
Of course, our prototype getting like a week of production didn't help.
I'd rather just do something instead of making formal plans.
What am trying to say is that I'm a bad scientist.
<:Kiricoin:495336831978569759>
Meanwhile, I just roasted people for their bad English like an asshole.
We had a peer review and we got scorched (which we deserved) for missing citations and things.

THE SPITE SUSTAINS ME AND GIVES ME MOTIVATION!
So now I'm gonna criticize those reports with no mention of how bad the language is.
Even though this is an advanced course and both reports were very difficult to read. <:ChrisAngry:336656958272700417>
<:ElfneinDrowning:336656417035517952>
And I found out that I was too negative and focused on grammar during yesterday's peer review of reports. So I have to be nicer and provide more constructive criticism by the end of today.
<:ElfneinBullying:421432763078410241>
This is also the first time my group dynamic has collapsed. I wrote like 80% of the code for one assignment.
It's extra bad, since the courses never conform to the supposed 20 hour per week limit.
But I can't do that now.
Usually when it comes to bigger assignments, I have to sacrifice time in the other course to make do.
Speaking of burnout, I'm spread very thin right now. Two courses with group assignments do not play well together.
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
This doesn't entirely apply to me, but still...
Turns out that Buzzfeed publishes stuff of value.

No, but you need to balance curiosity with what you want to do after studying.
Counterpoint: You are likely to be eaten alive by people more ravenous for power than yourself.
There are probably some more local positions that would fit into that. No need to aim for the big league.
Well, make sure that politics is your thing.
Well, there's a paradigm shift.
What's the plan now?
If you're still on that path.
Sorry for making CS sound horrible, Rakhi.

I take it the American political climate is to blame for you being so reserved about this.
<#336297840529899522> , people.
I'm more interested in the reasoning.
Say, Ho Ho, what are the popular brexit stances?
It's fiiiiine.
Repeat yourself one more time dunkek, and you'll sound like a politician. <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Huh?
Researching votes is important, but somewhat rare.
All right, we might be moving the conversation towards eugenics at this rate.
Are we done in <#336297840529899522> ? <:HibikiWhat:336656482907193344>
There's also tomato soup. Otherwise, I have to cook lunch in advance. <:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
Sadly, only veggie pizza is easily available. <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
I'm kinda aiming to eat more vegetarian.
Try a sallad?
I corrected it!
...veggies?
-30 celsius over here. And I have to walk home for 10 minutes. <:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
Lord Buckethead might have a Deathstar.
I know people who just like the taste.
So is the concept of willingly ingesting poison.
But the taste is a really big barrier.
I might try getting drunk just the once, for funsies.
I just don't like the gains versus risk calculation.
Just playing it safe, as it were. My mother went skydiving though.
...I just play video games and study. Interesting enough, I find.
The idea of a glorious death is pretty silly at this point in time.
Your heart only goes so far.
💔
Take care of yourself.
Guess that's the new thing I learned today.
Should be apps for it.
Not helpful. Maybe set an alarm for that.
Well, I'm no doctor. But having someone ready to take you in would be good.
If you have it in your genetic history, then you really need to be careful.
...then you should set up a checkup before long.
Bad genetical history for heart diseases?
Good. That rules that out.
No weird mixing?
Pretty sure you've talked about stuff like that before.
I meant that, plus medicin and/or drugs.
Would the chemical cocktail you're on be to blame?
The pieces of the graduation paper I intend to write are falling into place. Just gotta survive until April. <:MariaConfident:336657338729627658>
<:MariaConfident:336657338729627658>
The US may collapse, but the dark continent shall not come to be.
Brighter timeline, here we come.
Sure. <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Good training wheels.
I try having vegetarian lunches, unless we have leftovers that must be eaten.
Have special cheating days like twice a month.
You could be a selective vegetarian.
Ordering out isn't my thing, but for quick lunches, my options are limited.
It's very rare.
What I really wanna learn is vegetarian food that tastes good to me.
I wanna say a few of them serve the same purpose.
They take up space and are so rarely used.
I wanna escape the 8 bottles of different sauces that live in my family's fridge for what feels like at least a year.
But if you plan your meals, you could potentially avoid random crap in your fridge.
Yeah, random leftovers is the hardest step.
Might get the time once I escape Uni.
Cooking is good. I should learn it properly.
Is that one of those famed American piss beers?
Scotch?
I wonder how much more orange juice you can get for the price of a decent champagne bottle.

Also, it's pricy as hell over here.
I got a novelty tiny champagne bottle for my highschool graduation. One sip and 🤢
Some people just won't improve.
Quite.
Not for me. <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
...starting to appreciate my extended family more and more.
Genius.
Oh, that.
<:HibikiWhat:336656482907193344>
Friends are nice.
Wow, there are a lot of people shaming others for not moving out as soon as possible.
Should I've been bootstrapping harder?
Just seems like the efficient thing to do.
23, student, living at home and I'll probably stay around until I've managed to work and some housing opens up.
I'm reading through a thread from 2011 about when you should move from home and it really reminds me of how distant I am from society at large.
But I hear it pays well. <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
There's linked lists, layout coding, threading, math, logic...
Oh yeah, just you wait.
Just do your homework. <:ElfneinDrowning:336656417035517952>
But good luck and prepare for pain.
It's all knowledge represantation and decision making.
AI isn't cute though.
Ah, a fellow CS person.
What are you studying?
I can respect that.
So, financially independant with fancy kitchenware?
I want my own place and a rice cooker.
Anyone got some dreams to work towards?
Staycations. <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
*Is commuting*
Good thing I hate traveling. <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Gonna have to be frugal.
Eh, I doubt it'll be that good.
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
Knowing this economy, I'll have to save extra for my pension.
💸
Surely you can save money by not being a massive tool, no?
Gonna see how that goes.
I'm aiming to be efficient with money once I graduate.
Speakers are an *investment*.
I hope you can recover, but I'm not sure how you could force their hand.
...for months?
I see. What do the doctors say?
Fair. Care to share what is bringing you down?
You could also talk about it here.
...talk to your girlfriend and stay away from anything dangerous.
<:TsubasaDisgust:349013662775902209>
Just coffee shop coffee is pricey.
Yeah, many can't even sacrifice certain things to save money.
But I understand the appeal of moving out if you hate jour parents, want to date constantly and want to decide what to eat.
Thanks. <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
It's also a bit of an effciancy thing. Staying home is much less of a risk if you can get away with it.
Shouldn't take that long, since I'm not aiming for a car for a while.
I want to get my education done and then save up for a while.
But the people who moved at 18 seemed like half-crazy people who hated their parents.
The thread was about people 25+ living at home. I ain't there yet! <:MariaConfident:336657338729627658>
I'm not one to judge.
It's stupidly hard. And boring. But at least I gave a somewhat educated vote last election.
But I have taken some steps in trying to educate myself in political matters.
I just live here. <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I went through a thread in a Swedish forum recently talking about when you should move away from home and all the people there seemed so alien.
I feel ya.
<:MariaConfident:336657338729627658>
I went to a recruitment interview. Maybe I'll actually get a job this year. Just gotta graduate.
We might just be done here.
Put those in <#336297387863703552> whenever you feel like it! <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
~~Would give us another source of weird Japan stories other than WFC~~
Stick with that.
Nah, I bet the service industry is a bit stuffed.
You can do many things. And I assure that Japan will be more interesting.
Probably. You do you.
You'd be surprised just how well, too.
But we speak English. <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Japan seems cool, but with loads of baggage.
Got loads of snow here.
"Be free!"
Another thing people in that thread spouted about. 
"You gotta see the world!"
I'm just staying local, I hate travel.
I think I figured that out. Anything especially Japanese?
Bad market, or are you anxious about work?
Are we talking NEET horrible, or baby eater horrible?
Heh.
What are your improvement goals? I wanna learn to be less blunt and rude. <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Live and Learn, as Crush 40 sang. <:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
Always room to get better.
Sounds survivable.
Yet.
Meanwhile, I don't have any loans hanging over my head. 🙂
It was an interesting read though, that thread. So many people screaming about leeches who don't move as soon as they can get away with.
Context is king.
It's supposed to be, yeah. But in the context of paying your folks, I'd just say rent for everything (food, power, heat, space, internet).
Don't some places combine rent, heat and such?
~~Not to mention how much they've invested in you.~~
Heat and power, yo.
I intend to, it's only fair.
I might write more about this later if I figure something else out.
<:ElfneinDrowning:336656417035517952>
I think this explains why I seem so dry when compared to many people. It's like we engage the human experience at completely different planes
I multitask, dislike eating longer than needed, don't wanna drive short distances, don't stay angry if I can avoid it, shut off lights and listen to music constantly to stave off boredom.
I've come to the realization that my life's creed is "efficiency". All I do comes back to that.
Could there be a local support group?
Do you have anyone else nearby to depend on? GF's family?
Spill da beans. <:MariaYell:336657352264646657>
Ok. Best of luck.
<@302063351767498752> Care to tell us what  rules your parents decided on?
See: Me, in Uni. <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
<:MikuBliss:336657233712513024>
As an aside, "just go outside" is bullshit. I need something to do outside. <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
Yeah, 4 hours could work. I'd hate it, but still.
Basically torture. <:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
Context, please. <@302063351767498752>
Paranoid shit.
"Finding out how to use the API calls was difficult." " Same goes for threading the read/write logic."
Why wouldn't you just take notes in a report?
...what.
It sounds very vaguely defined.
Would you describe the assignment as "meandery"?
As it does.
You lack fundamentals, last I heard.
Rakhi, you jumped into the ocean with that assignment.
Can confirm. I die inside a bit every week. <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
And here I thought me doing a bit of higher level math in 2nd grade was impressive.
<:MariaShock:423196877354303498>
Forget all that, Yumi. I don't have enough hours just to pass, nevermind do something fun at school.
Barely scraping by, myself.
Jerks, the whole lot of them.
<:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
Trans Exclusionary Radical Feminists.
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
But yes, school is a nightmare at times. I'm not sure I can graduate this semester.
<:GarieWink:336657101273169921>
You could go back and add comments for the functions, ya know. Python even has a snazzy standard.
Saki, comment your code. <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
...one hopes that's mandatory
Ok, rings a vague bell.
Ok, just to confirm, is this a Val from the Valkyrie server?
Also: What?
...of course he misspelled it.
I don't think I even know who this is.
Wha?
<@284390402210136064> Wait, what do you mean by that tagging?
Well, that's that cleared up. Thanks, Saki.
All we share is pics. <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
No.
But I think I can safely conclude now that this is little concern of mine, but keep us updated.
Ok, it's just that Saki invited me to a server run by someone named that. Which made this extra confusing.
Valastiri? Or is that someone else?
<:TsubasaDisgust:349013662775902209>
The ministry thing? I don't know the process.
So much for sharing Symphogear artwork.
<:HibikiTired:422925410490253313>
Huh, would you look at that. Best of luck to ya.
I never went that far.
It sucks, since the UK is so good for importing stuff.
I got Fatal Frame 2 from there. Should arrive soon. <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
I think the representative vote passed. So now the ministry vote remains.
Not to mention the restriction on links.
Strict upload filters, presumably.
Because the risk of the consequences rises.
It's something. 😑
^
Don't forget Josou, Latooni. I like that term.
Canada?
Yeah, just being able to listen is good too.
<:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
So is having someone in the relevant party as a friend.
Knowledge is an important first step.
There's a limit to how much you can care, with people having individual limits.
Going back to what I posted before, many things can be blamed on empathy and the lackthereof.
Not every translator wants to be nuanced. <:TsubasaYareYare:407397617451139073>
Thank you. That's it.
I want a more specific word. It almost sounds like jealousy.
There has to be a term for this garbage.
Is it like: "If *I* have to deal with not being exactly as I want to be, *everyone else has to as well.*"
Say, what is the deal with people getting rabid over others wanting to change what the genetic lottery gave them?
🙂
There were a few rays of hope in that thread though.
Ugh, there are people equating gender reassignment surgery to plastic surgery on the Swedish subreddit. We really aren't as good as I hoped about lbtq things.
The Netherlands, then?
Of course it is.
<:HibikiShock:336656371611074580>
I'd say give him some more time for introspection.
<:HibikiTired:422925410490253313>
Just a few more and I'm free. I'm just gonna sleep forever once I graduate.
It's amazing just how fast my mood shifts to prepare for the worst whenever one of my assignments get corrected. I think I passed this latest one by a hair.
I understand the skepticism, but I don't think there's much to question here.
Yes, but it's not a lot and I've provided a source.
It's sucky, that's for certain.
I'd assume so, but I'm not up to date on foreign politics, so you'd have to ask someone else to be sure.
https://www.glaad.org/healthcare
"Most health insurance policies and programs, including New York State Medicaid, specifically exclude transgender people from accessing care. This doesn't have to be the case for trans and gender non-conforming New Yorkers, especially those who are low-income and qualify for Medicaid."
"A regulation being prepared by the administration would weaken protections against anti-trans discrimination in health care."
Underfunded.
Sounds like a Sci-Fi thing to me.
What do they say?
Say Nep, do you just want lewds all over the place? Or is it something else? Give us some nuance.
Some works could do with more lewd, and some could do with less.
Sex positivity is nice, but there come a point where it's too much. Depends on the person, of course.
As you say, both cultures need to rethink things.
It's a tough line to draw. It's mostly cheesecake garbage though.
Can't be arsed to care about news more than that.
Yes. It's usually on during dinner and concises how the planet is on fire in 10 minutes.
Do the news count?
Also, accept that ecchi won't ever be real.
Respect the opposite sex and screw appropriately. <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
<:ElfneinDrowning:336656417035517952>
Funny that two parts of the world are on different axes of the same problem.
Yeah, some movement in that direction. Maybe.
Some new feminist movement, perhaps?
I wonder where this road will take Japan. There has to be a boiling point somewhere.
Really really bad if you take a step back.
Yep.
I would too. Partially.
Miyazaki? <:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
Question is, are they a bunch of westerners going crazy under western views of sex.
Yeah, that's a few steps too far and potentially dishonest, as you say.
Ah, people who wank on their figures. Gotcha.
I need a clearer picture.
There are many groups like that, no?
And what's a jaded view of the east/west dichotomy?
What group, Alice?
Enjoy your stay.
Welcome to marketing.
Punny ads > representation, of course.
What?
Well, you forgot the parantheses.
Why do they even try?
That would be a spectacular shitstorm.
So it's not "Unisex clothing is better than having university sex" then? Cuz that's what I got out of that sentence.
I don't think I can parse this correctly, care to explain?
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
University think-tanks.
It's varied, but the lyrics aren't distracting, so you can just let it carry you and keep your brain from revving down.
<:HibikiEager:407398049531559937>
**Eurobeat**
But, I also have a little helpful secret. <:GarieWink:336657101273169921>
<:Germain:421434126856486912>
So, I love doing something cool with scientific worth, and  hate what the school system has put me through. So I wanna succeed and rub it in their face.
Internal motivation is important. I've recently gotten into a grove in my research by thinking in terms of love and hatred.
Yeah, pennies are out to get us. <:Ver:336656981144109066>
Fear? Isn't it just a tool?
Unless it's a lengthy holiday, then it's programming time. <:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
Home time is for video games. <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
School time is for lectures and assignments.
Saving the textbook for going to and from school works for me.
Feel shame for failing, but do not let it consume you.
As I said, you gotta have balanced motivation.
That too.
Can't really afford to.
I've rarely just thrown a day away to relax.
Huh, I just try to do something of worth each day.
Oh hey, it's the next member of the CS Degree Survival club. <:HibikiHi:336657249827028993>
Boredom?
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Weird flex, but ok.
Embracing school might serve as a decent escape.
Family drama, or worrying about the future?
It seems that you're more interested in practical stuff. So maybe Interactive Design is your calling.
Maybe you should bail out before it's too late.
...did you just like it because it was easy?
The whole class was just "design shit good".
Useless extra words.
So many words.
That was our worst class. <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
Outside of logic classes, you should be able to escape math before long and get coding.
Ah yes, mixing math with programming.
I don't think we had very harsh requirements for this.
Wikipedia is a good start, but it all depends on what they ask of you.
There it is.
The gist of it is a problem that you can crunch the numbers to solve.
Ok, guess I'll think back to my first year when we went through this.
Or are we talking NP problems?
So, if problems are Turing-complete?
What's the subject?
Good luck. <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
It's a playlist that has kept me coding well beyond what is healthy.
I'll post a giant playlist in <#447132690349555712>
Sarah comics are the best.
But mah Smash tier-lists! <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
Remind me to never achieve a seat of power above you, Hana.
Except when it comes to crazy riots.
That reminds me of the wondrous thing they do in France: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bossnapping
Saki, explain the idea behind that joke.
I'll make a note this time.
Aren't most other currencies backed by USD?
Keep thinking like that Nara, and you'll end up at gay space cowboy communism before long.
Always the go-to word.
Yeah, hate is a strong word. Sorry.
Some people change, and some accidentally reveal their true colours.
Having to hate people you previously liked is annoying. You expect better.
What a shitbag.
You might be different.
Well, I'm neutrual towards him, so whatever.
Is that worth caring about?
<:TsubasaYareYare:407397617451139073>
Not sending you that should be pretty easy to get across to respectable people.
Then perhaps you need to reconsider some of your company.
We're all just monkeys in denial. <:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
Also, we need to teach people how to communicate and just break up instead of cheating, but I hope that's obvious.
At this point, we need classes on how to behave on social media. <:TsubasaYareYare:407397617451139073>
Yaaaay.
Aww.
Well, **THE ALGORITHM** is built around creating "interest".
Why would you actually use Twitter? That's what other people are for. <:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
Yay?
Never touch the stuff.
Setting up a fallback plan before talking to them would be good.
Is that your hindsight speaking?
<:MariaShock:423196877354303498>
Ugh, if they cover kids games, then there might be a correlation.
Some of them have to be bad apples.
Is there a correlation, or are there just many youtube people out there?
Might be prudent to breach the subject some more, if you think it'll work out.
GOOD
So, she has your back?
Sounds almost like a test.
This video is a good overview of trans representation.
https://youtu.be/2sIwTcb6yG8
Well, had I payed attention, I would have seen the signs.

That sounds like a challenge.
I think I understand what you mean, so thanks. <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Thanks. Science is fun, but maaaan is it dicey.
Then, XV awaits! <:MariaConfident:336657338729627658>
<:HibikiTired:422925410490253313>
Just gotta focus on my research and escape this nightmare.
Hopefully, I wrote the report to my teacher's liking.
It works as intended, but the wait is awful.
I just got a bit anxious and re-ran some tests for an assignment that won't be corrected for a whole month.
Also reminded me of how adaptive hateful people are.
Look at that. <:CarolShock:430939013235474432>
We all need help. But women usually need more of it. That's all there is to it.
Now he only has his rotten mountain of candy.
Is there any governmental system over there that operates correctly?
The more I learn about the US, the more upset I get.
https://youtu.be/hnoMsftQPY8
All I got. What's up?
Of course they'd take it.
Seems like a spiffy deal to transphobes.
Malk...finds a way. <:ChrisSmile:336656717553074176>
Ah yes, the Old Man Collective.
Yes.
I think we have a history of caking politicians.
No, you cannot. But you can breath**e**. <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I take it the UK is infamous for wasting tax money.
30% is ok by me.
"But if we tax the rich, it will suck once I become rich, which is gonna happen any day now."
Yeah, always fun to think about how much the world improves for each one that kicks the bucket.
Got their parents' account.
Damn legacy players.
With how the class divide escalates, we are heading to an interesting future on way or another.
Guillotine time?
😦
Which is how the rich keep them in place.
Then again, isn't the middle class fueled by the fear of becoming lower class?
I bet rich people fear loss something fierce. That's what drives them.
That too.
Money is just debuff protection.
Safety nets keep you from becoming unhappy.
Money does buy you safety nets though.
"If only I wasn't a lousy millionaire. I bet billionaires are actually happy with their existance."
About 8.5 bullshit.
Why would he throw food away?
Ok, women in positions of power fetish then. A bit rare, but whatever.
Wrinkle fetish?
Woo, I can perceive things.
Also, something about May bothers me. It's like she doesn't do research and just keeps talking until you go away.
Keep your guillotines and milkshakes close at hand.
<:TsubasaDisgust:349013662775902209>
The heck does that mean?
But maybe you could rearrange money *just a bit*.
Well, I don't economics, so I couldn't tell you.
I don't entirely get the magic money tree.
I guess the job isn't worth pursuing anymore.
A lack of medical personel is a problem everywhere.
As the conservatives say: "If it ain't broke, I can't be arsed to fix it."
I've heard mad tales of healthcare and the lackthereof in the UK.
<:MariaShock:423196877354303498>
I hear Brazil has been figuratively on fire for years now.
<:Germain:421434126856486912>
VOTING ACCOMPLISHED
Subscribe to a cute animal subreddit or something.
I've left it to others to use it for me, which works pretty well.
Twitter is built to encourage "activity", usually by shoving stupid stuff in your face.
Give this a read, Nara: https://www.shamusyoung.com/twentysidedtale/?p=46541
Go, democracy! <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I'm curious to see how things turn out here. Our local flavour of the Alt Right have been on the rise.
Mobile Twitter is somehow worse than regular Twitter.

But there's a reason the Americans in Symphogear are portrayed the way they are.
<:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
Excluding the yanks here, of course. Y'all alright.
``They are not the best``
Hell, a good chunk of the American public think they are the best.
*Maybe the French had the right idea.*
😑
Can we push the reset button on the US?
Also, yes, poor the Onion.
I'd assume not.
It's the Guardian.
You read that correctly.
Hey America, did anyone ever tell you about Poe's Law?
https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/may/29/energy-department-molecules-freedom-fossil-fuel-rebranding
That reminds me, I have to play SOMA. There's some good existential horror.
If it implicates you, you mean?
Here's some XKCD.
Well, if you get to 4chan-levels of memetic shitbaggery, then I get ya.
Gotta be something transformative.
Yeah, "Make it good" is usually enough.
I assume you've been burned by boring trite for a while.
I don't like it when we get to FunnyJunk levels of dank, but there's fun to be had.
Really, responding to anything dumb in a smart and funny way is the way to go.
Takes effort.
Yeah, something in that direction. But you gotta layer in the parody of the person you're making fun of well.
Also, I'm starting to sense some salt from solopy. Maybe it's just my imagination.
See, this whole meme business exists on multiple levels. If you actually want to make something memorable, you *really* need to know your shit.
Send them guillotine memes. See if they get the picture.
Otherwise, ``how can they consume product and get excited for new product?``
Gotta be hip with the kids.
Obviously.
And what's scary is that most brands do this, and Walmart actually put a smidge of effort in.
They tried. May their executives get eaten.
Aaaaaaaaand it's gone.
It's more that the novelty has yet to wear off.
Yes, the thing you need to assimilate into the culture.
Gotta save dem dollars somehow...
Youtube is a messy entity with many drivers.
Huh?
<:TsubasaYareYare:407397617451139073>
You know what? I need another one.
<:TsubasaYareYare:407397617451139073>
Think of the engineers. <:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
"This is my toe, this is my arm."
You really have to find the balance between exposing yourself to too much internet and staying inside a bubble.
Good on ya. Let's you avoid the majority of the internet's worst aspects.
Ugh.
Do you use Twitter?
I get the feeling that you run into this sort of stuff more often than I do, solopy.
That's dumb.
How did that even happen?
What, from you?
😑
Were they at least caught?
Sounds like gang violence.
But how you managed to mix in CS when you have political aspirations are beyond me.
Well, I can answer CS questions. The rest is on you.
Are the tests done?
Is that the end of it, no redo of any kind?
How crazy are these tests supposed to be?
You're allowed to worry about school, Rakhi.
<:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
And that's LinkedIn stuff done. Gib employment, plz.
"Break a leg" is a common English phrase.
<:Kiricoin:495336831978569759>
I just sent in my first job application.
<:Germain:421434126856486912>
I'm basically a scientist now!
Thanks for the concern, at any rate.
Well, breakfast is the best. <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
I don't think I can. Imma play God of War 2 until I pass out or need breakfast.
``It is currently 5 in the morning.``
<:HibikiTired:422925410490253313>
I would just like to gloat that I have completed my research paper.
😅
It's pretty easy for tech stuff.
I know it's a process and a half.
One thing at a time.
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
First episode was fine.
I should watch Ranma.
Gender bender mangas are weird.
Language! <:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
Oh.
Verbal form?
Follow your boner and don't be mean. Should take you far.
I'm just getting more and more confused.
Would make for a good thing to write about though.
Can't say I know much about it aside from some weird comments I've seen about them. But it seems like its own weird area of fiction that's silly, insane and maybe a bit wholesome. Maybe. But it's probably mostly for fapping.
As I said, gender bender manga is weird.
Then please take this as an oppurtunity to learn, Reaper.
It's only a preliminary interview, but hey. <:HibikiWhoops:585839808115507222>
I got an interview for that job I applied to!
It's ambiguous. <:GarieWink:336657101273169921>
Which is smelling correctly. <:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
What, should I say "I gotta stink correctly"?
No?
But shit, I could get money to trade for goods and services!
*Gotta prepare projects to show, gotta smell correctly, gotta stay calm...*
Also, me right now:
It is a good picture.
Since he's at the threat of gun violence, this situation is extremely delicate.
Understandable.
Can you talk to social services?
...that sounds like something that calls for an intervention.
This is the place.
So, are you saying that the studio that owns EVA wanted the gay erasure?
Yes, but they agreed to it.
<:MariaShock:423196877354303498>
JESUS CHRIST, the rest of that thread!
Maybe CR translators aren't that bad.
<:CarolShock:430939013235474432>
**You made it!**
*But it's your thing, Anno.*
<:MichaWhat:336657148627124225>
Next episode? I don't think they'll waste much screentime on it if earlier seasons are any indication.
And if the animators of Symphogear have a hateboner for US politics, let them express themselves. <:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
Usually, people want to put a piece of themselves into the media they create.
Disappointed, really? Art imitates life, you know.
If you want a show that goes into this a bit, watch Welcome To The NHK.
It's all a balancing act.
Taking that mindset too far is not healthy.
If you get really frustrated with things that remind you of reality, you might be relying on media to forget about it.
Ruminate on it.
Then you might have some problem with escapism, Wolfsbane.
Always something, I guess.
Sounds like the equivalent of eating buckets of sad ice cream.
Weeb shit is primed to be escapism, but it'll only be that if you let it.
Does sound profitable though.
I'm ready.
No way, I have Paint.NET for that.
*Do I have to scrub that whiteboard in order to make a point without nitpicks.?* <:MariaYell:336657352264646657>
Saki, I wasn't gonna point that out. <:ShirabeStare:582381430915596289>
Listen to Nanoha.
Look at the super villain over here.
Not everyone is a brick, Yorin. Such is the way of things.
I'd rather the next president be Canadian. <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I hear there was some **FACTS AND LOGIC** happening here.
That too.
...some StrikerS or Vivid character?
BE. NICE. <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
If anyone needs inspiration in that regard, we do have that exercise anime this season. <:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
Should probably exercise though. <:ChrisCharge:586320496346529792>
I eat good enough to merely be on a slow decline. <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
I can't wait for yankee-land to stop shoving bad ideas down kids' throats like that. <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
Dehydration is evil, so no need for that.
What Yorin said.
...that's not what I meant.
Lock 'em up and forget about 'em.
Rich kids are scary. <:MariaShock:423196877354303498>
That reminds me, I need a show about how terrible rich kids are towards staff at country clubs.
Now that's dumb.
I hope bug burgers can be made tasty.
Japan being what it is, I assume this will be glacial.
I guess.
That's cool and all, but that's not legislation or even a promise of support.
So, what are they doing exactly?
It's the biggest tragedy in a long while, so of course everyone wants it remedied in some fashion.
<:ElfneinDrowning:336656417035517952>
At least you got confirmation. I find the uncertain wait worse.
Germany did it.
...I think that was the case for a long while here too.
"Stop fiddling your wiener, or Sky Daddy will burn you. He made the universe, you know?"
I still hold the belief that Christianity was conceptualized so that the sons of farmers would stop wanking all day and actually tend the field.
Siding with Sky Daddy is a pretty strong defence.
...I should know this.
Muslims and christians are a decent chunk of the populace. Pretty sure the chinese dislike them too.
As far as the world goes, homosexuals are pretty prominent on the shitlist.
Hating homosexuals isn't exclusive to christians.
<:ElfneinDrowning:336656417035517952>
And now I'm reminded of that " Blue Blood" bullshit.
Rich people in all times do dumb shit.
I'm with Melua. Less doom-saying.
*Nana sings Love Deterrence in the background*
But polyamory is rare, so you shouldn't bet on it working.
Talking a lot?
That stuff takes work.
Leave it to this server to go from talk of nuclear annihilation to gay. <:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>

Ok, "kerfuffle" then.
What is this fight even about?
Yankee Land can be crazy.

I believe they did a gun-based dating show.
That reminds me, NRA-funded TV is scary.
Yeah, but knives are still one hell of an advantage. Running away is better.
I know some parts of the US are dangerous enough to warrant firearms, but it sill irks me.
People know.

Being a salty child, perhaps?
Could be a slacktivist racist.
<:KirikaSpook:605209108827734017>
And I thought people using <#495354212150935572> for commands was bad enough.
But I'm sure it's semi-common everywhere.
Shame on both the UK and US for their lackluster efforts.
That too.
I realized that getting extra taxes as you increase your income is kinda like diminishing returns saying that you should do something other than earn money at a certain point. <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I'm of a spartan mindset, so I say make them pay more. They don't need it.
Help, my brother defended rich people's right to pay the same level of taxes as poor people.
You need to learn that anyway. Just try to keep your family at bay. <:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
Ohh, are you moving away from the family there?
Soft stuff nonentheless. <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
How are your politics studies going, Rakhi?
Prison with no homework. <:KirikaApproval:586957465552158720>
Well, different prison, at least.
Freedom!
Then?
Now it's just one teensy coding assignment and correcting my research paper left.
I was more thinking rich enough to pay for pension and a Switch. <:HibikiWhoops:585839808115507222>
Coding remains fun though. <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
After three years of studies, you wanna see some dosh.
Thanks. But I wanna say I'm 50% motivated by the sunk cost fallacy at this point.
<:MariaConfident:336657338729627658>
It's exciting and scary. But I must persevere and aquire Stable Income™
I got a call from the governental body that helps with job applications and I can just feel adult responsibilities creeping up on me. <:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
Attempts were made.
<@506219877724454929> This does not belong here. Put it in <#336297387863703552>
Always more to be done. <:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
Research more options if possible.
With the UK being what it is now, I don't know where you should aim your career.
Fair. Add being trans on top of that and you have a sizeable amount of opponents just by existing.
Is that gonna make a political career impossible?
So technically, I've spent 5 years in higher education. <:KirikaSmug:607742561414676517>
No, you misunderstand, I took phone dev courses for two years before I went to CS. <:HibikiWhoops:585839808115507222>
It'd be awful if I didn't meet my current classmates.
I took 2 years to figure some stuff myself. Put me in a decent timeline.
ABG - Always Be Ganbaruing <:MariaConfident:336657338729627658>

Raze the ground and snort the ashes?
What is the master plan here?
But if you can't write at a desk for 10 minutes, then that sounds worth investigating.
Sounds like what I get. Though that's mostly from writing on a laptop under less than optimal conditions.
I spent like a week hammering away at my driving exams!
<:MariaShock:423196877354303498>
But then you get to enjoy months of internet specualation as to what that means politically and who set you up, Nara.
A normal guy who doesn't have media training.
So he just lets it simmer.
The way I see it, Felix just can't deal with a problematic fanbase well.
This reminds me of when I rejected going to pick up a children's bible during some chruch activities I was part of as a kid. I'm such a rebel. <:TsubasaSmug:585839805737467920>
It's an effective brainwashing tool.
I like it here, but things could be better.
I'm not an expert, but it just seems like a dishonest invasion for resources.
This would be the place to do it.
He's not fascist, but they sure do love him.
Media training is important. <:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
*Oh yeah, the nazi cosplay.*
Yeah, being white and famous, I'm sure he's a magnet for people who want him as a symbol.
I don't think Felix is active in hate groups. I do recall him saying dumb shit on stream though.
No, that happens when you're an idiot trying to keep clicks rolling, Rakhi.
Seeing as you can't spell my name, that much is evident. <:ShirabePout:336656831978012712>
...which you can edit.
Ohh.
Wait, do they recognize it as a singular pronoun now?
Thanks, anime.
...that was a plot point in Yakuza 6.
Some people just stop trying to learn things after high school.
Sounds like a very sheltered and intellectually lazy person.
But perspective is haaaaaaaard.
"Old man yells at cloud."
Try thousands.
Money is one thing, but the upheaval of my glorious routine is frightening. <:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
My family knows I'm a weeb of some description, so they have jokingly prodded me to go to Japan. But I don't think I'm up for it.
Good point, well made. <:MichaWhat:336657148627124225>
Pluralize correctly. <:ShirabeStare:582381430915596289>
Yeah, seems very fishy to me, Yorin. <:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
It's mainly the food, right? <:HibikiOhNo:586337444597596202>
I've always found their fascination with the past interesting. Over here, the past is dead, so enjoy the pop music.
I have some lyrics for this:
```
Heaven can wait, 'til another day.
Cause there ain't no reason to leave.
The world is a stage where we all can play.
```
<:KanadeSinging:421432676789256202>

GIFT is a thing too, yes.
Still not an excuse to forsake manners.
Be a Hibiki, not a Topdad.
Try knitting. <:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
Enough with the melodrama.
Sounds like a healthy decision.
I've done it like thrice during my university days and it's not recommended.
High-intensity rushing should be avoided when possible. It's not a good habit.
That's a dangerous mindset.
It's a research thesis.
To finish up my degree.
A bachelor degree in computer science?
<:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
Usually, school stuff doesn't get me this much, but it's the last grade I need to graduate.
<:ElfneinDrowning:336656417035517952>
I really don't want to edit it again and wait for another month.
It's been over a month since I turned it in for the second time and the anxiety just seems to be building.
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
All right, now I've lost sleep over worrying about the correction of my thesis.
Or care.
Japan being Japan.
<:TsubasaYareYare:407397617451139073>
...included the one with the racist child.
But now they axed the terrible one and reimplemented the missing ones.
I *think* the wholesome quest was cut from the original western version alongside a bunch of other stuff.
They also added in this: https://i.redd.it/47p596aizyq31.png

Yeah, enrollment periods are usually written in stone.
The lesson here is that if a company is garbage, there are alternative more often than not.
Huh. I heard it was a good alternative to D3.
Joke? Is Torchlight bad or something? <:HibikiWhat:336656482907193344>
Hey, there's always Torchlight.
Well, it's also bad.
Now that's good.
Lucky you.
In particular, it's popular within the Trump demographic. <:ElfneinDrowning:336656417035517952>
I don't even feel that much since it took so long for the thesis to be corrected.
<:MikuPraise:585839808765493249>
In happier news, I got my thesis approved, so I just sent in the application for my bachelor degree in CS.
I think that works best for prettyboys, but language is a fluid mess.
I'm not an expert, and I said it was to be fancy. <:HibikiWhoops:585839808115507222>
Wait, are you designing homework?
Ask away.
I'm done with it now. <:KirikaSmug:607742561414676517>
I don't have the kanji readily available, sorry.
As an another aside, Japanese is bullshit. <:ElfneinDrowning:336656417035517952>
```
The word "otokonoko" normally means "boy" (literally "male child"), but swapping the "ko" meaning "child" for a different "ko" meaning "girl" gives a compound that Japanese sites like to translate as "male maiden".
```
And if you're feeling fancy, Otokonoko works too.
As an aside, the term Josou is much better. It means "Woman's Clothing".
<:TsubasaSmug:585839805737467920>
I am now legally the smartest person in my family, probably in the extended family too.
I would like to take a moment so say that **I GOT MY BACHELOR'S DEGREE IN COMPUTER SCIENCE!!!!!**

Thanks.
I would guess no more than 15 for the 3 spots, since my city isn't huge.

OK, I GOT A PRELIMINARY INTERVIEW.
If I apply and get it, I could like get payed in a month or two. <:KirikaShout:607741871703457812>
I just got matched to a fitting potential job and it made my brain go all <:HibikiShock:336656371611074580>
What exactly are you going through, Aria?
What was the plan for that? Living off the internet is difficult.
If you even can, since Japanese flats are mostly tiny.
That too.
I'd assume the heating would be crap.
Good.
You best find someone to talk to in private then.
Fucking hell. How is that country still kicking?
Yes, but it's still standing after burning for so long. That takes resilience.
I'm in awe that the British government hasn't gone up in flames on accident yet.
On the one hand, the farce continues. But maybe now there's time to write some trade deals.
<:CarolSmug:617040484111745027>
Right, be ready to parry on wake-ups, of course.
<:ElfneinDrowning:336656417035517952>
My mother basically told me to lie a bit and suck up to capitalism in any way possible, and I'm not too confident in such advice.
All right, I have my first job interview of importance in less than 18 hours and I'd appreciate whatever advice you can throw my way.
And those guys aren't as clear on open positions, so they remain backup.
...it is a decent jacket.
Could I actually get a job soon? <:HibikiEager:407398049531559937>
I also wormed my way back to the place I did my research at and got a reference person and the company jacket they promised me.
All right, I think my interview went well. It was only a preliminary one, but I should get a response later this week.
I just hope you get the trade agreements on medicine sorted out.

Life isn't a story. <:ElfneinDrowning:336656417035517952>
Blizzard is really obvious about that. It's kinda hilarious.
Wait, what?
Yeah, then don't say: "In my opinion, I think people are using PC culture as an excuse to tell bad stories.".
Isn't what you want to say simply: "I don't like the writing of the batwoman show, they should hire someone better."?
...then complain about the writing and not what the character is meant to be.
I think Blizzard saved their first black OW character for Blizzcon too.
If you understand that, then there's no discussion to be had, Dino.
Ok, so is Kate bad because of what she is, or because the writing is bad?
Going back to Blizzard as a proper example of weaponizing represantation, they totally dole out who is gay as a way to build good will easily.
Then you just don't like it. It happens. Constantly.
Dont put too much faith in the scores. Use your own opinions, Dino.
Yeah, that's why I'm not inclined to agree with Dino's point.
Then it's a boring show with lesbians. That's ok, though not optimal.
In order to support you're claim, I want to see them actively deflect criticisms using their representation somewhere.
Going back to your initial point, are they using their representation in order to excuse a supposedly bad show, or is it just a bad show with representation?
I'm not sure I can accept the wig in any context. But I am waaaaaaay behind on batwoman incarnations.
For context, what's bad about the show beyond the wig?
Yeah, there is a difference between wanting to make a cool show with representation and failing and doing a regular show and sprinkling it with shallow represantatiion for easy market appeal.
As long as you can remember them correctly. I always forget if I'm late millenial or early Gen Z.
Yeah, the generation terms are all fine.
John Oliver is great at explaining just how much of a living nightmare the US...everything is.
They all seem like cartoon characters.
As an outsider, I'm astounded that your government has survived until now, Rakhi.
I just have a giant list of media to consume. It's pretty alright.
I was lucky, I hated violent games when I was a kid, so I never became like that. <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
And then the kid throws a tantrum at the poor cashier.
The stories about that on NotAlwaysRight are hilarious, especially when the kid tries to trick their parent.
<:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
In a more cartoonish scenario, imagine the rich being well-fed and fat, so if everyone is starving, you eat them first.
As in, take their stuff and give it to others.
It's an expression. "Eat the rich."
And dehumanizing them makes them easier to one day eat. <:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
You can shit on the rich all you want, for example. <:ChrisOi:586551700987576330>
Non-committal and bad?
*And yet people want to cut taxes.*
But putting aside the trans clinic, our hospitals are understaffed as is.
The report also says that there has been an explosive increase in trans cases, so visibility is becoming less of an issue.
``Trans people were legally forced to sterilization until 2013.`` <:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
The report I'm reading talks a lot about people suffering in the queues.
Yes, that's the issue.
And hormones are offered at age 16 at the earliest.
Oh hey, at least they offer hormone blockers.
<:ShirabePout:336656831978012712>
Turns out that the waiting time for getting hormone therapy as a trans person up in Sweden where I live is a year. I had hoped we would be better, but there are barely 3 people working fulltime in the Gender Identity Reception Office.

I dunno about those places, but this place is lovely. <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
I'm starting to think that many people aren't cut out for the frontier of internet communication.
And yes, Rakhi old. <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
I do recall you and Pat saying hello. You were like the two most active members. <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
You *need* more sleep. Can you cut a few hours from work or your catetaking duties?
Wait, are you the only one who can take care of them? That can't be sustainable.

I spend the absolute minimum time in a clothing store. But I always get dragged to a few more "just in case".
I don't get the shoppaholics from the video. They sound cult-ish.
My last two lasted one each. If that. <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
My jeans haven't been durable. <:ChrisOi:586551700987576330>
I survived on 1-2 jeans for the longest time. But now have forsaken them for cheaper pants will hopefully last longer.
But hey, at least I don't go shopping for clothes on my own.
<:KirikaShout:607741871703457812>
*I actually need to pick out 5 shirts to throw away.*
<:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
Yay, validation for my habit of never throwing away clothes until my mother forces my hand.
https://twitter.com/Nicchiban_/status/1200523749218508800?s=09
Gonna assume that's good.
Oh hey, same. <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
How so?
Ohh.
What's wrong with them then? Pricing?
Steam has opt-in (for the devs) offline DRM.
*There is part of the service problem.*
Yes. But very few Japanese companies rely on international money for the most part.
Let me buy the thing, Japan. <:ElfneinDrowning:336656417035517952>
I learn more and more that my family is pretty good for not having any shitbags in it. I never considered it before.
Ohhh, yeah, while this is drastic, you might need to learn more responsibility.
That sounds grueling.
Oh right.
What do you do all day?
Ok, then I get the annoyance, but you still need them.
How long did the old ones last?
Yes, but moreso.
Before we get catgirls, we're gonna get designer babies.
As a programmer, I say: Good fucking luck debugging AI using modern methods.
The adaptabilty required to drive is a real problem for AI, yeah. We discussed that "Save the driver or save the pedsetrians" problem a lot in AI class.
Maybe start tabletop gaming or something. Or maybe yoga.
Sounds like you need to meet new people.
Capitalism. <:ElfneinDrowning:336656417035517952>
Merry Christmas to you too, Rakhi. <:PadoruHibiki:516438720082346004>
<:KirikaSkeptical:586406806482583556>
It's fine, it's sort of in jest.
The challenge is to act like an adult no matter the circumstance. <:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
I've talked with people who shit on Symphogear as a vector to shit on me, so it goes both ways. <:ShirabePout:336656831978012712>
It's an extension of the genetic competition?
Fan culture, amirite? <:ShirabeConcern:586404485598019604>
Fights cause stress, yes.
It's worth taking a step back from time to time.
Some people tie a lot of their perceived worth to their media taste.
Isn't this better for <#371105434771390465> ?
From what I understand, people like that fear societal change the same way cockroaches fear light.
I wanted to come back to a nice nature/nurture discussion. <:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
Rady, why must you undo my work like this? <:KirikaSkeptical:586406806482583556>
Bad shoes, like 1 mile and no, walking is boring.
Sure can. I have walking in the snow *uphill* to do. <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
>going from shit anime takes to nature VS nurture

My work is done. <:KirikaSmug:607742561414676517>
Just blame the parents. It's always the parents. <:ElfneinDrowning:336656417035517952>
Winning is nice. Too bad so many don't get to do it, so they resort to making arguments into competitions. <:ShirabeCheer:661042424570708037>
It's childish. <:KirikaSkeptical:586406806482583556>
But it shows that people can use a small understanding of something to shut down discussion of it.
It'll probably be a while before parents can actually teach people how to behave online.
It sucks you have to go through this just because Discord exists when you're young, Lectric.
<:TsubasaDisgust:349013662775902209>
I have two entire roles now. <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Huzzah.
<#336297387863703552> <:ShirabeWhisper:620073899001905153>
So yeah, invest in condoms. <:KirikaApproval:586957465552158720>
It's almost like many people shouldn't be parents.
I got by thinking about how much I needed my degree.
But to widen the point, I find it best to judge people on a case-by-case basis. As such, some moms are terrible and some dads are great. It depends.
*I was kinda trying to intice others to jump into the discussion.*
I wonder how much longer the idea of men not being good around children will last.
All right, 2 more talks like this and you have some decent control over your life.
This again.
Not even Jeb loves Jeb that much.
Iowa's digital voting screwed up in some way, right?
I'm a bit out of the loop, so can someone please correct me on this?
Don't you have that dumb rule of only people born in the US get to have positions of power?
Thanks. I'll give it a look later.
It's important to consider all major possibilities when deploying new technology.
Yes, but if the damage is slow to surface, we're all in danger down the line. I just don't know if this is the last straw, or even if there is one.
Basically, "it causes headaches and cancer, we need to make it illegal".
Does anyone here have some thoughts?
On one hand, I wanna call them paranoid nutjobs, but on the other hand, I am really not up-to-date on the science.
My grandmother got a warning brochure about 5G in the mail today and it hit me that I have no idea what the consensus on the technology is.
We're on the edge of a lot of societal changes that'll will be interesting to see develop.
But I'm curious about lighter stuff as well, like how will old people who grew up on the internet behave when compared to old people now.
Or how the far the wealth gap will go and if it'll create some next-level dystopia.
But then you have the incoming collapse of the pension system that might make retirement a thing of the past.
Yeah, that's one concern.
I'm really curious about how current young generations will be as old people from a few perspectives.
Oh yeah, that's a thing as well.
So to stay on top of things as you get older, you have to never become comfortable with what you know, which I believe to be more demanding than many can handle.
So, I was born in the 90s, but I didn't really take the step to learn about LBTQ+ issues until a few years ago, at which point I still had a chance to absorb new information. I think I read once that it's normal to become more conservative and less prone to change as you age.
That's also a complicating factor.
But what you have to remember is that people are very much defined by their upbringing. I don't know how old Kaneko and Agematsu are, but I bet they're old enough not to question certain things, which is probably how we end up with these terrible things in Geah.
So, one thing that's frustrating with societal progress is how slow it is. But it's extra terrible in the information age, because information travels and ages faster than it does for people, so if you're up-to-date one an issue, everyone who isn't seems like a caveman.
Ok, I wanna sidetrack things a little bit.
I'm not up-to-date on child discipline, but I can't imagine Japan being good about it overall.
Are these things that are just rooted in Japanese culture?
Hey, live and learn.
Respect, everybody. You should try it.
<:TsubasaDisgust:349013662775902209>
"Finally, someone who shows those women what's what."
Thinking about it, the kind of people who would be attracted to that archetype disgusts me.
I intend to make the most of things on my end. We'll see how that turns out.
Are we really going to collapse thanks to the "everyone is an embarrassed millionaire" mindset?
Things are very stable where I live, so I can very easily forget how unstable things are elsewhere. I just have to make sure to not lose my perspective.
Noble of you, Saki.
Yeah, not only the US. We're either headed to a dystopia or guillotines. One has to come sooner or later.
Credit scores baffle me as a concept, but that's another discussion.
Hell, our attention is a commodity.
It's an abuse of trust, resources, privacy and peace of mind. It's the worst!
Seems like we're better at sentencing these bastards than the US. One got 20 years.
Calling armed police on streamers.
It has come to my attention that Swatting has migrated to Sweden. Fucking hell.
The US is a mess, Anand.
Yeah, more of the former than the latter, Anand.
Both.
It's a lot to digest as an outsider peeking in, but it's bad, Anand.
Punishment is many things, I'm mostly thinking of fines and incarceration without access to everything under the sun. Anything beyond that is kinda useless and cruel.
Give her time.
Good luck. <:KirikaSalute:620069889838809089>
Yes, but baby steps.
<:ShirabeToast:672245704118501376>
A toast to my town for not giving tax breaks to crypto miners.
They are usually corrupt, power-hungry and abusive. At least in the US.
Sounds like you need to find yourself a new test.
That's just terrible.
<:KirikaSkeptical:586406806482583556>
What an asshole.
As being lazy and content with it, unless I misunderstood.
Say, you mentioned your uncles as examples of this. What are they like?
They love ~~your money~~ you.
Guillotine left?
But something tells me the personality test will be incredibly confusing and obtuse.
<:MariaScared:672584661125431299>
...INTJ sounds pretty acurate.
Two hours until I go on a follow-up job interview. I would be more excited, but I know from a friend that they'll want me to to a series of "personality tests" as well before they make their call. Tech companies up here are a cowardly lot, I tell you. Nothing scares them more than employing someone that's slightly different from their expectations.
<:ShirabeDone:688198954810474559>
I have a friend who wants to work there too, but the video games business isn't kind to newcomers not willing to give their all to the work.
Hey, at least our food isn't British. <:TsubasaUpset:672861878703357968>
What does your friend say, Kaliks?
I love it here, Lectric.
<:ShirabeWhisper:620073899001905153>
You're supposed to use cocoa.
There's also $2 knicknack, which you can skip to donate to charity. <:ElfneinPresents:688429721998065680>
<:ElsaChef:689035502673985622>
Bus wifi to the rescue! This is what we get for donating blood in Sweden.

I can't upload pics on my phone data, so I'm just gonna <:KirikaMunch:672599382670966785>
I live. Time for my snack reward. <:ShiraBean:661294258795446326>
My perspective is that I'm barely using this wondrous youth, so I might as well.
So I'm at least gonna tell everyone here who's ablebodied to sign up for blood donation. It's very important and only costs you time, slight pain and maybe a day's worth of unproductivity.
I'm here at the blod center now and confirmed that they're in dire need of blood. I wanna recruit some donors, but I don't know many viable people who could.
<:MariaNo:672658725986762764>
...could you not put it like that?
Yes, but now it's in even higher demand.
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
I just got a text saying that my (very common) blood type is in high demand, presumably due to the pandemic. I assumed as much, but I didn't think it'd be this bad. I wasn't gonna skip my donation today, but now I REALLY can't skip it.
No, I'm talking about the website. And the call centers.
<:TsubasaAngry:688429717011038210>
Interview done, but now I can't report it because our governmental job center is overloaded due to the pandemic.
This video is easily digestible, so spread it around to those that need it.
https://youtu.be/BtN-goy9VOY
I wouldn't bet on that.
But I think it's like, using animal iconography to express yourself and stuff.
I'm not really an expert. <:HibikiWhoops:585839808115507222>
But it's also refusal to accept the furry way of life, which isn't all kinks.
Well, yeah.
They've also been the internet's punching bag for the longest time.
It's common, yet weird enough to attract a lot of flak.
What Cypher said.
School is out, many workplaces are closed.
Less than optimal, not terrible.
Are you done being serious here?
Isn't that just criminals staying home?
I guess I should prepare for my parents going nuts deeper into lockdown.
Excuses for what?
Can you explain with more detail?
You could ask them. If they're good friends, they'll tell you.
But the friends you do have, are they good ones? If so, focus on that.
You won't know that until you're old and grey.
Like here, for example.
<:ChrisBored:672575526346424351>
Does the rest of the world get to vote on this yet?
So, a it's a monstrous child versus a demented grandpa this time?
<:ShirabeDone:688198954810474559>
Then read stuff. Multiple stuffs, even.
As an outsider, the USA continues to terrrify me.
I got a bit of that myself. Not fun.
I'd say so, yeah.
At this point, all one can hope for is that the pandemic brings about some positive change. Somehow.
...isn't the US a world leader in overpriced medicine?
157 here.
As I said earlier, about 31% here.
I'm not sure on that actually, though I think a lot of countries have issues with national debt.
...you pay more taxes.
People not having to pay hundreds of dollars for insulin is one small but important difference.
Listen to people living under socialism right now and ask them questions. We'll answer.
It seems like you're arguing past everyone by spewing propaganda you've been exposed to.
Even under socialism, companies still compete against eachother for profit.
Socialism is pretty nice, yes.
If you don't have to fear debt, 31% taxation isn't that bad. <:ElfneinDrowning:336656417035517952>
Housing fucking sucks, but that's true everywhere.
It's high, but free education and drastically lowered cost for healthcare makes it worth it.
Hell, radio waves are radiation!
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
I thought radio had standards.
Something about the radiation weakening your immune system.
<:KanadeBleh:672455306059579392>
I just heard a radio program that discussed how 5G helps spread COVID-19.
<:TsubasaNote:689554460044820608>
Please share.
*Invite them here and get them to watch Symphogear.*
<:ElfneinWeld:586027421296492585>
If we boost enough, they're have to invent a new tier at some point.
Until then, best buy that Nitro. <:Kiricoin:495336831978569759>
If that happens and Discord's new masters are trash, we're screwed.
One concern I saw raised is the prospect of the company getting sold if it fails to meet profit goals.
Let me get a job and a PS5 first, ok? <:TsubasaUpset:672861878703357968>
Madness. <:ShirabeFear:696380146248319066>

For all the use I get out of it, I should pay *something* down the line.
<:MillaarcV:673239269036392526>
Thanks for paying for my Discord experience, Anand.
Adventure capital, Nitro-addicted users and low profit margins, I presume.
Right now?
Good thing they can be disabled. <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
*Oh god, Nitro emotes in a school server.*
Great stonks. Let's hope it lasts.
Mission successful. <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
Balance is key. <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I can't even parse the image.
<:ShirabeFear:696380146248319066>
...could you please start conversations with something less...revolting?
You got through a JRPG in spite of your supposed bad attention span.
Are you taking these things up with your therapist?
Probabably, but I bet you can contain them a bit somehow.
You just have these fixations that keep you from just relaxing and enjoying things.
You like Chrono Trigger, so that isn't true, is it?
That's a tad drastic.
<:TsubasaYareYare:407397617451139073>
Well said, Solopy. <:KirikaSalute:620069889838809089>
Keep at it.
But it's a step forward.
...I feel like I skipped it to some manner of adulthood. Or maybe I've just forgotten everything.
<:ShirabeConcern:586404485598019604>
Anything, really.
Or talk about pets.
You could watch Kamen Rider with someone, Lectric.
So fast! <:KirikaPog:605209108827734017>
Make playdates in <#337805317276565525> please.
Got 2 more in University.
Same here.
<:GenjuroThumbsUp:336657189475188740>
It's also been normalized by the anime community, giving it an annoying amount of sticking power.
It's a very negative word to use non-chalantly against people.
Sounds like my dad trying to get me to do work I don't like. <:KirikaDisgust:688431636043268097>
So it's a paranoid delusion then.
Context is useful. <:TsubasaNote:689554460044820608>
Yeah, what was the point here beyond pointing out it existing?
<:HibikiWhat:336656482907193344>
I can't even parse that but I think I should be mad at *someone*.
Religion means a very particular thing in the west, Anand.
You can pretend that society isn't changing and shout down anyone who seems to be driving such change. <:TsubasaNeutral:688429723205894149>
It sounds like troll mentality.
And what does that get you at the end of the day?
Love, peace and learning, people. Try it.
<:ElfneinDrowning:336656417035517952>
Ya got me there.
I think for them it's less for satisfaction and more to maintain the shambling wreck they call a personality.
Life is not worth living by putting others down for your own satisfaction.
Good. Remember that.
So you say, in spite of claiming that it made you happy for once.
I don't think it's a good idea for someone so keen on submitting to others' will.
Hanging out on 4chan or questionable subreddits, trolling political opponents, that sort of stuff.
Getting dragged down into the cesspools of the internet.
Lectric, I think you're dancing around a lot of cliffs without realizing the danger.
That sounds exactly like trolling.
It's a spectrum. Depends on your standards for evil.
Got a specific context in mind?
It's not, but in some circumstances it effectively is malicious.
I can see that happening.
Ok, that's where you're coming from.
I'm sure there are malicious people everywhere who just pretend to be ignorant.
Ignorance is such a weak defense anyway, since it can be nullified with a sentence or two.
Hmm, maybe I don't care about defining things this finely. I'd rather judge things on a case-by-case basis.
Great video, by the way. <:TsubasaNote:689554460044820608>
Since by not researching the effects of the additives, they could continue using them in ignorance.
Or rather, it was ignorance fueled by greed.
Ignorance of the effect of chemicals caused mass poisoning.
In this case: https://youtu.be/qhN-o2ame-4
Again, depends.
Welp.
Get swole, Rady. 💪
At this point, I'd say that you're depressed and that it's eating away at your ability to enjoy yourself.
Find enough good places on the internet to eat up your time, Lectric.
It was a good game, that's how. <:YumiPoint:688429724103344164>
Is it a rash?
Possibly. Ask your therapist.
So yeah, Summer is gonna be murder on me. <:ChrisBored:672575526346424351>
Somewhere around there. We even got some snow when I came back.
*I still got sweaty.* <:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
I'm hotblooded, so it's a struggle. My mom and her friend were astonished that I was out biking in just a tshirt in like 7 C.
*It's so boring and wet.*
I am so done with the upkeep a human body requires. Washing yourself is just part of it.
*Oh don't talk to me about how much of a pain it is to just clean your arm pits.* <:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
Don't shower more than once a day and don't go around being smelly. <:YumiPoint:688429724103344164>
I go for showers every other day, since I hate showers and burning through clothes too quickly, but sometimes you gotta bite the bullet and shower once per day for a few days.
Play guitar?
But she seemed intent on antagonizing the Twitch userbase needlessly, which I don't think a mod should do.
Yeah, her being trans makes her more of a target.
Otherkin, grass eating and prancing included, if I understand it correctly.
She's antagonistic and a deer person.
When is it wrong to take breaks? Are you getting guilt tripped again?
I engage with my IRL life every few months. Works out pretty well. <:CagliostroSmile:672861875385401344>
The important thing is to find your balance and stay away from the toxic crap holes.
Discord servers are more difficult, but you can usually tap out of conversations.
Do what I do then? Keep a curated list of sites and subreddits to check out and only engage with them when you have the energy and something to say.
Internet drama is draining, yes.
Maybe you should give She-Ra a watch. Seems like your sort of thing.
Alt Right ideas only have value if you're twisted enough, Lectric.
Look at puppies or something instead.
Then don't go on /pol/.
The internet is a big place. Can't you find 5 nice places to hang out in?
*Try to find some decent hobbies that you feel are worth a lot of your time.
*Stay the hell away from the cesspools of the internet.

*Be more honest with your therapist about your problems or find one you can be honest with.

*Re-evaluate your relationships and make sure they're not toxic.
Yeah, definitively.
Aren't they sworn to secrecy?
Who told you to be anxious about June specifically?
Leave it as an open request and I'm sure someone can help you out during the day.
I'm no expert, but there are a bunch of people here that can ask you the correct questions.
Sounds like a question worth exploring.
Toxic masculinity is butts. It's impossible to bottle everything in.
Ugh. <:ShirabeFear:696380146248319066>
Problems are problems and should be adressed.
And don't feel ashamed about talking about your problems here.
I ponder such things too. Romantic relationships seem so distant, meant for other people.
I grow more and more appreciative of my parents as the years go on.
<:KirikaDisgust:688431636043268097>
Yeah, age only represents potential. There be smart kids out there.
At this point, I can only hope something decent comes out of this bloodshed. <:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
Efficiency problems are my jam.
I did my research paper on this subject. <:KirikaHappy:688432863796133888>
Even if I didn't want to hang out with many of them, they were at least very approachable for school stuff.
I took computer science, so I was kinda spoiled for like-minded people.
Going by my experience, college-level people are less shit and easier to talk to.
What is?
<:TsubasaNeutral:688429723205894149>
Our major cities feel like a different country at times.
Of fucking course. <:MillaarcDone:689395768980668416>
This ordeal has also shown that I am in no way able to have a well-formed opinion on societal ills. All I can think is: "Just behave like civilized people, is it really that hard?"
The BLM protests finally reached my remote corner of the world this weekend. I was glad to read that the only thing that happened was that the police arrested two apparent racists trying to disrupt the protest. The rest of Sweden has been faced with bigger messes though and I can't be arsed to keep up with it all. I hope we get some societal progress out of all this down the line.
<:TsubasaNeutral:688429723205894149>
I dreamt about Lego games last night myself. The human brain is a puzzle wrapped in an enigma.
I was just disgusted when my parents pushed some beer on me.
https://youtu.be/zaD84DTGULo
Just gonna drop these here then: https://youtu.be/Wf4cea5oObY
Always relevant.
https://xkcd.com/1357/
Many "shortened" words are slurs.
Yes.
Ok, that's just wrong and you sound addicted to social interactions here.
Yeah, taking a break from the server to reevaluate things would probably be for the best.
That's one hell of a problem that needs to be adressed.
I bet.
When it comes to big projects, it's important to get something done every day but still make room for rest.
Discuss it with your teacher and try to work out a plan.
Safe or not, it ain't the whole world you live in and you need to internalize that.
Oh yeah, you talked about them ignoring your art earlier.
If that's the case, I totally get why you got hooked on this server.
I take it school hasn't been good to you all year.
...assuming they don't break the rules here, of course.
I kinda just roll with the flow and let people be who they are,
~~Yes, plurality has caught me offguard, Emily.~~
So you're plural too. Good thing I caught on to that now at least.
Easy to forget that it's an election year, *the fun has yet to begin*.
Don't have to, there's more and more pushback against our friendly immigration policy, Emily.
You can try, Emily. <:HibikiHi:336657249827028993>
We have a lovely little housing crisis, for example.
I've heard that sentiment from so many, Aria.
<:TsubasaUpset:672861878703357968>
Also, do better sex education.

This whole thing tells me there are people out there in dire need of professionally made adult animation.

How hard is it to not be a creep?

Yes, and he should consult his therapist.
I'm sure walking to and from the bus over the years has done wonders for my health.
<:YumiPoint:688429724103344164>
But cutting soda for good ol' water helps too.
The big thing about exercise is to normalize the routine.
I think the fighting game community outed some groomers and pedophiles.
<:TsubasaNeutral:688429723205894149>
My past is fine. I'm kinda bad at remembering a lot of it though, since I don't think about it much.
That face says it all.
Hehe. <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
5 years.
That's what I get for not fighting tooth and nail to get a shoddy car or a shoddy job like you're supposed to.
No, but he doesn't respect me very much.
I think I'd just get ridiculed/ignored. Doesn't feel worth fighting over. The family dynamic is shouty enough.
<:TsubasaNeutral:688429723205894149>
Ever get the feeling that your brother is a racist not due to malice, but due to sheer intellectual laziness and unwillingness to understand other people?
<:ShirabeFear:696380146248319066>
If it comes up again. This is usually pretty rare, though I really don't like the jovial tone he takes when talking about minorities.
Could be his imagination, a weird diet, or smelly habits. <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
He bitched about "dark-skinned people" smelling extra bad at the gym.
My dad got on his case for me a bit. <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
It's a neutral existance, which isn't the worst.
Pretty much. But we've come to this unspoken understanding that means we interact as little as possible.
Already there. I think. <:TsubasaNeutral:688429723205894149>
I'm just tired at my family's disapproval of my life choices (getting educated, wanting a good job close to friends and family).
Rent's too high. Also, too much sunlight.
<:ShirabeDone:688198954810474559>
Why must it be so difficult to justify wanting to get a job in your chosen field close to home instead of fighting over easy-entry jobs in the pandemic-infested capital?
I think you're meant to go clubbing or play novice sports or somesuch.
Given how selfish I am with time and how much of it school ate up, it's no wonder things went the way they did for me. <:HibikiWhoops:585839808115507222>
More than me. <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
~~Maybe wait a year or two to be safe though.~~
Work from that angle.
You need to figure out where the womenfolk of Poland hang out.
So that's what "the good ol' times" were.
~~Also, I might get work starting in September.~~
I don't know about soon, but I do know I have a pair of JRPGs that need playing in October! <:ElsaCharge:690470897559011328>
<:MariaConfident:336657338729627658>
Probably time for physical thererapy, but I can do that in the name of playing video games again!
All right, nurse told me to go on a few more days on Ibuprofen and then call the hospital for a further diagnosis.
A cold followed by a backwards headache and everpresent minor hip/leg pain.
I don't appreciate the sass.
Now to figure out what's actually going on with me. <:MariaConfident:336657338729627658>
It was negative, by the way. <:ShiraBean:736607747834904667>
It says a lot about me that the arrival of a result of a Covid-19 test didn't make me as anxious/tense as the result of exams or job applications.
Indian marriages?
They mean movie Asians/Europeans.
This is why proper schooling would be so nice.
Normalization will do that to ya.
It's nothing freaky, just a few extra degrees.
*You'd think they'd tell us this in PE.* <:KirikaShout:607741871703457812>
Good, then you can't accidentally bend them backwards as easily. <:CagliostroSmile:672861875385401344>
<:Germain:421434126856486912>
YES, VIDEO GAMES! I HAVE TURN-BASED RPGS AND HORROR GAMES TO PLAY THIS FALL!
Yeah, I can bend my fingers too far backwards.
Turns out joints should not go beyond 90 degrees in most circumstances. <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
~~Was also told not overbend my fingers. Stupid genes giving me the ability to bend joints further than they should.~~
<:HibikiScreech:633468460030230548>
So yeah, just gotta get swole and wait a bit more!
I got some thermal compression gloves and got told to lift weights to strengthen myself.
I'm back from my physiotherapy appointment. I got weirdly complimented on having rested my hands for a month, exercising more and swapping to a more ergonomic desk. Felt nice.

People should aim that energy towards jogging or mastering Tekken.
I find that being mean takes energy I don't wanna waste. <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
Good time to learn then. <:YumiPoint:688429724103344164>
That's my goal as well. Do enough to not suffer.
I found that out this year. Peak age my ass.
No idea. I hope this is something they cover in medical school.
Is it the lockdown?
They talked about paygrades after working for 5 years, and if I'm lucky, I could reach a similar pay in 2. Just gotta get a job first. <:ShiraBean:736607747834904667>
They're twins, Rady. <:CagliostroSmile:672861875385401344>
One hopes. <:MikuWorry:672908523495227432>
They turn 20 soon and they still only have eyes for cars, money and haphazardly moving out as soon as possible. It's like we live on different wave lengths.
<:MillaarcDone:689395768980668416>
Bleh, I can barely have a conversation with my brothers without them laughing at the very idea of my hobbies (anime/video games/ this server) and life choices (getting higher education and avoiding low-tier jobs like the plague).
~~Not that I'm particularly picky at this stage.~~
Before I get to do networking, I have to do some networking. <:YumiPoint:688429724103344164>
<:SerenaSmile:672908572774105109>
I managed to do a little bit of networking. It's so nice to talk to a human you sorta know when job hunting.
No, it's the genetic material that degrades as cells divide.
Even before that. I am a man of habit and nothing is more habitual than where you were born.
Anyways, on the topic of moving to a different country, I find the idea lowkey horrifying.
Thanks. But that really shouldn't be the case. <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
~~If anything, I feel like I speak English better than UK and US people.~~
Swede here, been thinking in English for years. It's necessary to learn the local language, but you could get by on English for most conversations.
I believe it.
American politics make me tired as an onlooker. <:KirikaTired:688429723726250054>
*Silently puts back party poppers* <:HibikiSad:738234648509022368>

Stupid two-party system.
Isn't it always?

Seriously, how are food places meant to survive without infecting people without shifting to takeout?
B-But takeout is the optimal solution...

The UK really is gunning for the position of most transphobic nation. <:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
Matt, it's <#336297840529899522>

Chikage, this is <#336297840529899522> . It's for serious discussions, not jokes.
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
Could always go the death of the author route and just read into the material and stop trying to mind read the writers.
I'm making some wild assumptions, frankly.
Yeah, I can only assume a lot of staff had shitty parents.
The way I see it, they tried to do something progressive with the show, but got chained down by both the anime business and their own biases brought about thanks to being raised in Japan.
~~She's the one with western blood, so it's ok.~~
Western shows have different goals and don't air at 2 in the morning for weirdos.
Japan decided to cheap out and hunt otaku whales instead.
Of course, cartoons are marketed to kids for franchising, since animation is expensive.
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
That too. At least we got She-ra.
Fucking reality, getting in the way of good anime.
You want it to be mysterius *and* rad, preferrably with no faults.
More than that, anime is *weird*. Brave, even. Which makes its stumbles all the more disappointing.
The mystery does feed into the allure of Japanese products. Probably why anime took off in the west like it did.
Not helped by how insular Japanese creators can be.
A couple of oceans and a language barrier will do that.
Fill the Nanoha void?
Make good anime?
Maybe this is our cue to read up on some history. I know Yakuza got me to read into the history between Japan, China and Korea. <:CagliostroSmile:672861875385401344>
With only that tweet to go by it looks like a particarly annoying troll.

Is it not the national sport?
With the way the world is, kids have to grow up faster and faster. <:OgawaRead:688429716507721770>
They think it's icky to be different. That's it.
Yeah, they're having a field day proposing bills.
Parental humor is a questionable thing at the best of times.
So like, losing hair would give you dysphoria.
Isn't it just "unease through being"?
Dysphoria be like that.
You know how parents are.
He really thinks you should. Please understand.
No, you need to think like him. Always.
All that told me is that other servers can be weird.
Thanks.
<:OgawaRead:688429716507721770>
All right, I think that's enough venting for about half a year. Thanks, Nara. Better get back to my applications tomorrow.
Actual work with a product owner you can have a dialogue with? Easy peasy.
And then, when I did my internship earlier this year, I delivered everything on time *because homework is a nightmare of prioritiy queueing.*
I think only had to retake 2 classes total.
You'd think they'd want someone who prioritizes his work after his weaknesses and delivers most things within the alloted period.
When a) The "easy jobs" market is murder. 
 
And b) *Computer Science degrees have gotten a lot harder in the past 2 decades, so I had to redo homework.*
They were essentially perplexed that I hadn't done any summer work between terms during university.
That reminds me of a really "critical levels of boomer" energy I got from one interview.
Ads like that dull the pain a little, but not enough.
Or those going "Fuck! Shit! Damn! We need a replacement coder who knows these 4 specific things and can start in 2 hours because our central pillar left us for another company."
Or another where they basically said "You miss it out in the bonies, right? Has the pretty local river that you love! You aren't really happy with that job you took in Stockholm which made you abandon your family, right?"
Like one company reposting for six months straight looking for a specific senior.
I've seen some hilarious ads.
For me, the job market has been rough. Only a handful of coding positions even approaching junior level.  <@182890099183190018>

Given how much trouble I've had hunting for a job the last 1 & 1/2 year, I can attest to that.
UK?
Probably.
I've also heard that migrating to Scandinavia sucks without the help of an employer.
Frankly, I just stay home most of the time. Not much worth travelling to, especially with the pandemic.
Not much reason to go on dirt roads unless you have family there, but they're not bad.
Fine?
And yes, we speak better English than Brits and Yanks. Though you'd still need to learn the local language.
Swede here. I managed to communicate with Norwegians using Swedish once.
Aww. <:HibikiSad:738234648509022368>
<:CagliostroSmile:672861875385401344>
Learning to be more understanding of your bad behaviour and changing to better yourself is one of the best things you can do in a public space like this.
Add scripts to lock you out of those web sites and pick up a pleasant book whenever you feel anxious.
Nice.
Implying the Danes haven't tried for centuries.
I guess I'm just waiting for Biden to sneak in some executive order that'll make me sad. I know it's gonna happen some day.
Yes, but I assume we don't want the pipeline, right?
Is that good? <:HibikiWhat:336656482907193344>
All right, that's one step. Now for the 30 other ones.
That just comes off as mean and should inform your opinion of this person.
Pleaaaaaase keep spoilers to a minimum.
Not caring about people in other nations, or wanting repentant villain characters in media killed, for example.
People are known to have violent ideas when they can't empathize with the situation, be it real or fiction.
Do you mean how people hate annoying people in media but love actual criminals in media?
I'm not clicking those spoilers, so you'll have to explain your question better.
Yes. Video games are not real. Driving over a fence in reality would cause my heart to sink, but in a game it's fine.
I take it he'll spend the next two months spamming undo. <:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
I'd guess it's because trans people have already breached societal boundries and are more open with themselves.
"why trans people so gay?"
Wouldn't that require the customer base to have higher standards?
Shame is a powerful motivator! <:ElsaCharge:690470897559011328>
Don't be sorry, be glad you're smart enough to question your biases! <:MariaConfident:336657338729627658>
"The way you're supposed to be" is tainted by tradition and bullshit.
Speaking of propaganda.
Don't be ashamed, this is a perfect time to learn something. <:CagliostroSmile:672861875385401344>
Pharios, it sounds like you're choking on propaganda.
Well, I'm pretty sure that's a bad example and we fear spiders due to our genes.
And what reason do you have to fear trans people? They're an opressed minority.
Just to get the cliché out of the way, are you maybe gay? Or bi?
Being trans is not a choice. Being true to yourself and challenging society on that is a choice.
I think there was also some shortselling involved, like with GME now.
What are the lives of a few billionaires worth when compared to the Economy™️?
So let them burn. We gotta save the economy over people's lives, right? <:CarolYandere:424047704826707980>
This is what caused the 2008 crash, methinks.
Not even their banks could pay that off.
Last I heard, the debt for the hedge funds went over like 100 billion.
It's more that they bought a bigger spoon and kicked it into their brains. <:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
I think that's it. <:HibikiThink:688429715362414641>
But the cumulative fuckery of the stock market means that's not the game anymore. Instead, you have this fake gambling economy where everyone trades and bets on perceived value.
The idea is that holders get payouts (biannually? quarterly?) based on the stocks they own. So you buy a share of the company, inject some money into it and get part of the profits as a reward.
I can smell the insecurities from here.
Time is a lie. What was, is, only slightly different.
That's how chronology works.
Lesson of the day, don't mindlessly regurgitate Wikipedia articles quoting Twitter. <:YumiPoint:688429724103344164>

I don't think I believe that. Isn't Scott Adams a bit of an asshat?

Escape her abusive household and get a job?
Oh yeah, that's a thing too. For some reason.
Everyone only has so much empathy per day and you shouldn't expect people to spend it on you.
Ok, so to try and get somewhere with this: It's very important to respect boundries when it comes to sharing personal details, especially depressive ones.
I thought it was about people being dismissive about relationships with parents.
Next time you post poorly worded tweets, please explain so we can have a conversation.
I barely understand what this is about, but I'm gonna ask you to not be so snippy, Circles.

Why do I know so many people with mothers that are too focused on keeping things clean?
I meant if it's caked in dust.
Pleasant to move around in without triggering allergies.
Ok, is the house at least clean?
Stella, you're gonna have to accept that your mother is an idiot and adapt however you can.
Good plan.
...what kind of nightmare household is this? 🤨
Stella, eat your veggies. <:YumiPoint:688429724103344164>
Yeah, she's like 44Kg at 180cm. Definitively malnourished. And what kind of breakfast is tins of tuna?!
She sounds like an evil cartoon character, yes.
That and manipulating your feelings for them.
And that's a trick abusers...abuse.
Not the weight, that what your mom does dances the border between abuse and insanity.
I'm frankly impressed it took you so long in this day and age. But know it's done at least.
Reading back all this, *you need so much help*.
Good luck, Stella! <:KirikaCheer:689614085402525830>

Smart. Very smart.
Maybe you could lie about going stircrazy and needing to take walks. If nothing else, the exercise would do you good.
Are you allowed to go outside at all?
You need to prepare yourself physically and mentally for that.
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
*Of course you didn't know your weight and height until recently.*
<:HibikiShock:726645026725167114>
What's your BMI?
Look, the underweight thing is the most pressing and obvious problem. Mentioning the veggies is just a convincing bonus.
And how did they react to that?
What did you type up last time you chatted?
**YES.**
*Tell them you haven't had veggies in 9 years.*
Tell them about food, tell them about how underwight you are, tell them about how much shit is broken at home.
If you have the proof for later, that's good enough.
How was school? Any resources there that can't be traced by your mom?
You'll get one shot with them, so you need to make it count!
*Your emaciated frame should be proof enough.*
That's her trying to guilt trip you. And at this point, I hope she's right.
Keep the reality check questions coming, you need to realize how fucked up your life has become.
*Are you noticing a pattern here, Stella?*
<:MariaDefeated:688429716780089397>
Forget that, tell them how you haven't had vegetables in 9 years!
Well, she's 16 soon.
I haven't payed attention to call costs in like 12 years, so I wouldn't know what a fair rate is.
...Is that bad?
Maybe there's a web option? At any rate, you have more time to chat and give details.
At least to ask for tips for formulating a plan.
Are you still down for calling Irish CPS in her stead? <@155340660738621440>
Whenever that is. After your birthday in April?
ASAP, yes.
What do we have now? Paranoid delusions, abusive behaviour, creepy singing, improper animal care...
And if she tries to shoot you down due to the pandemic, tell her walks are allowed. Maybe look up a valid source in Irish news.
Not to mention time away from home.
But some form of eating disorder wouln't surprise me givem what you said about water.

15 years ago, is that you?
Pika, she hasn't had veggies in 9 years.

The human body is full of stupid stuff that can go sideways.

Wow, that sounds like actually competent schooling. What the hell?
I remember condoms on a wooden penis and a diagram of a womb. That's about it. <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Though to be fair, I don't remember jack squat about sex ed, so I can't claim ours is better.
~~I might be tossing shade on American schooling and what it does to people.~~
Howsabout we teach people not to be creepy freaks about sex in school? <:YumiPoint:688429724103344164>
Sexual liberation needs to hurry up. Dangly parts aren't worth all the fearmongering. Hell, they're not even that important when compared the nature of intimacy and the importance of trust, respect and boundries in a relationship.
Homophobes are similarly obsessed with anal sex, are they not?
At the very least, transphobes are bound to have a bunch of unresolved issues with sex and gender that they're unwilling to tackle and explore.

I've never been able to relate to having the stereotypical gay friend.
I've run into a single trans person and seen one other, presumably gay person, wearing the rainbow.
Of course, rehabilitation is not a verb in the American prison system.
Arguing about bathrooms is so silly when the issue is that you have an unreasonable amount of sexual predators using said bathrooms.

Life is a sum of days.
Maybe you're expecting too much of importance to happen each day?
Or you're convinced life only truly exists on the cover of a travel guide.
Either you underestimate how much you like being outside and how much you dislike the internet.
I've watched you trying to puzzle out your life for so long, but I don't know what more there's to say.

Right, so that's why some people wanted a neutral term. <:HibikiThink:688429715362414641>

Isn't the Nobel Peace Prize a shoddy additional prize that never gets awarded to the right person?
I don't think I could handle living under American exceptionalism. It's such a gigantic lie.
Well, they do hate science in the US. It is known.
I respect it. Dude got rich helping warmongers when he wanted dynamite to help miners die less. So he turned his fortune into a means to incentivize scientific progress. <:ShirabeToast:672245704118501376>

Isn't it more that being conservative makes it more likely that you make it to old age?

The more immediate issue is already here, which is people relying on the AI we already have out of either misguided belief in its prowess or as a way to save money, damned be the consequences.
Speaking as a CS student, AI is a tool. For now.

What do you mean?
Watch the video and come back to talk about it then.
I never would have figured that confirmation bias may exist as a way to cut down on the collective effort required to solve a problem. If you and your opponent research things properly, then you'll do "eachother's" work, whereas if you both focus on a single thing, you can then just argue and reach a conclusion quicker.
It even goes into the value of having random people in small groups discuss various issues, which I thought would be relevant here.
Vsauce put up a really good video about how our brains aren't really equipped to handle the massive and quickly changing interconnected world we live in: https://youtu.be/_ArVh3Cj9rw
I hope so.
Nothing wrong with that, but you have to understand the needs and wants of those who aren't. People be horny and affectionate.
Oh, you're an aromantic asexual. That explains some things.
Right, that. Could you please start on some soul searching so you can undo some of those misguided feelings you've inherited from your culture?
Yeah, I remember some of it. All I remember is it being dumb.
People shoving pairings you don't like in your face are assholes who disrespect you and your feelings.
How in the hell did you get into that situation and why didn't you leave or block people?
Have you considered staying away from Twitter and seeing if that helps?
It sounds like social media has gotten the better of you without you realizing it.
Be real with me here. *Should you listen to those kinds of people in the first place?*

I'm not sure how valid him leaving is. We can only wait and watch.
That's because they wanted a resurgence of PC-centric developers and CDPR was seen as the herald of that.
Ohhh. And they made Celeste.

For the record, it usually isn't productive to just share something terrible here for its own sake unless you can spark a conversation around it. <@331908049822547978>

I guess your town is just full of uninteresting douchebags.
Then I understand your dourness.
Working on yourself is always good, but it's not necessary to build an emotional wall.
Not really. It just means you've had shoddy luck.
What, is it cursed?
Communication is a great asset when forging friendships.
That doesn't sound like a group of people worth the trouble for the most part.
Are you boring and terrible enough to justify that, or are you just projecting self-doubt?
I suppose "personal engagement" is a bit of a mouthful.
You're interested in self-actualization, right? You need to figure out how to exist as yourself among others.
Then I don't know what to say, except start ignoring other people a bit more. I know you're of the age where it makes sense to care about validation, but I'm concerned about you not being able to let that go once you become an adult.
Isn't your idea of what's normal or proper pretty warped by that validation addiction?
Do we know?
I enjoyed the state paying for my shitty microwave food. <:KanadeSmile:672455286392356884>
It goes so far as making university free and then paying people $300~ a month to study or giving them an incredibly kind loan that pays out $900~ a month.
I guess my inital assessment of it being very individual was correct.
Thanks for your input.
Hey, could someone explain to me the venn diagram of being trans and/or nonbinary? I'm having trouble understanding the details. Like, can you be nonbinary without being trans, for example?
Oh yeah. <:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
Hopefully. <:ElsaSick:689395768754569359>
Ok, that went from 1 to murder right quick.
Trolls are easy. You just don't engage and then ban them. Bullying is a lot more nuanced and difficult, since you can't just remove someone from a situation like that.
You sound like a supervillain.
Probably not a different time on the same day though.
Given enough headsup, they should comply.
Can't wait for the Polish government to try and escape into space before agreeing to pay that.
Sounds good to me. <:VanessaSmug:689395769199165447>
Isn't it just that your standards for playful ribbings are different compared to a lot of people here, Matt? So what you consider normal, others don't.
Words hard.
If not leaking, just painting people's impression of you.
There's some prima snark.
Sorry, by the way. <@!99695384296701952>
Thus throwing all it stands for under the bus in a vain attempt to get under Melua's skin.
I was distilling all of the mecha genre into a dumb GIF without any robots in it as a joke.
Masterfully shot down by Melua, to boot.
Just so we have a measuring stick, this is clear snark in my opinion: https://discord.com/channels/336297387863703552/336297387863703552/904757385900486758
To separate professional takes from personal ones.
I guess "in my opinion" works best in a professional setting?
Misused, as are many words and sayings, nothing new.
Yeah, but it's used for the most banal of things.
It's just a way to colour what you're gonna say.
Similarily, the saying "not gonna lie" always get paired with "for once in my life because I'm a giant liar" in my head.

"Money making niche"? It's a scam the whole way down.
I believe Melua has asked everyone to avoid agreeing like that in <#336297840529899522> to mitigate dogpiling.
It's called Freedom of Speech, not Freedom from Consequence.
Geography, my old adversary. <:TomosatoStare:688429724233629772>

But I think discussing greater consequences for harmful speech is interesting.
Because you can't just remove freedom of speech as far as I'm concerned.
Are you tired of anonymous people being shitheads on the internet?

Anyway, Hectan, can you be more detailed about what you're trying to say?
This sounds like a threat.
<:ShirabeStare:582381430915596289> is not a replacement for a proper judgy stare.
Might be that without seeing real people their brains can't force them to behave. Body language means a lot.

Speaking frankly, you're putting way too much stock in server events. Those can be fun, but they are rare occurences. Just being here day-to-day and taking part in the community we have all fostered, *that's* the value of the server.
Seeing as you recognize it as an issue, we on the mod team will be interested in your ability to adress it. You need to get over this and I think you should reframe it as "What can I do to stay in the server and forge new memories?" instead of "Who can I bitch at to change the past?".

It's very easy to be financially responsible when your brain goes "Hey fucko, you can buy a shiny new indie game if you don't get fast food twice."
I actually measure costs in candy or video games, but crepés is not a bad idea either. <:ChrisMunch:688191202973319198>
But just thinking "Hey, I got 40 crepe's worth of money for the thing I did" feels nice.
Now, in the long run, that gets self-destructive.
If you're set up to work next year, then you could probably extract some self-appreciation once your employer puts a number on your efforts.
Have you managed to do any soul searching on that front? You're not as stupid as you keep claiming.
Huh. I was expecting something more.

Play it cool and stay out of jail. Fake being nice if you can stomach it. Feign forgiveness.
You've never had a good home. It's nice.
Probably. But I think an actual home and access to some girly clothing could tide you over.

Be happy about that and enjoy your current shenanigans.
You broke server rules! And got back anyway!
If that's depressing, you're in a good place.
I'll be frank. You're deluding yourself a bit. We didn't organize a party in Spain that you missed out on. It was just fanfic promps and birthday events. Aside from XV airing, the rewatch we're doing now is the most exciting thing that has happened here.

Asking questions is fine, but you need the right time and place.
For <#336297840529899522> , I rarely have a damn clue about the big stuff being discussed. Instead of being opinionated and taking up space, I lurk while trying to learn things and keep things tidy as a mod.
Better yet, don't engage if you think things will turn sour. Be smart, see the patterns.
You have a problem with always needing to butt in, reframe the discussion, and getting pissy at people to correct slights against you. Just leaving is often a good move.
Expand that mindset to all potential interactions. Learn to let go of dumb internet talk.
Really, learn to filter. Both your language and where you use it
I think you should stay out of <#336297840529899522> unless you can handle heavy and complex discussions.
It's easy.
So learn to shut up at least.
I'm surprised there was more to this iceberg.
And you shouldn't be so overtly dramatic about it like you are now either. It reeks of the egotism that ails you.
So be better. We're getting tired of you, Das. The rope is running out.
Yes. As a reminder, this is an anime server.
Non-fiction audio books are probably a thing.
Making the effort to ensmarten yourself on your own is a good start, Das. Read some books, study a bit.
Wow, that sucks.
You need something to feel proud over, man. Getting a job and buying your own PC would probably be a start.

The OP is death metal. <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
It has similar energy to Symphogear. Very silly and lovely.
Everyone add Nobunagun (dubbed with the fun accents) to your watch lists. <:Germain:421434126856486912>
<@456226577798135808> It is cool.

It was just...no stakes, no good characters, no meaning to anything. It was a waste of animation hours in all regards.
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>

Already on the list.
Not everything can be Symphogear. <:HibikiScreech:633468460030230548>
I think the main issue is just that I don't know anime well enough to pick out the good shit.
No, that's cray-cray.
For real, I get anxious after like 2 episodes of anime.
<:TsubasaBliss:672861879000891432>
Anime is so hard to watch. 50+-hour JRPGs are so much more digestible.
<:TsubasaNeutral:688429723205894149>
Once a week, tops?
(Or at least tries to.)
That's different from being a modern weeb anime consumer who burns through multiple shows per year.
And that should tell you what you think of them.
At least.
🧠
Only so many shows are allowed to be remembered according to my brain.
I...remember very little of it. <:HibikiWhoops:585839808115507222>

All right, you have my attention.
And this was like 8 years ago.
I watch like a show per month! <:GermainAngry:689199996653928451>

Comf Camp is good, mehears.

I'm just waiting until you have this take about Symphogear. <:MariaChuckle:672465496515411984>
<:MariaWhat:672245553920344080>
Was that intended, or did the uploader increase the framerate?
Plus a few more episodes of Rockman.EXE and Outlaw Star.
Dragonar, Restuarant from another world, 5 centimeter per second, Kekkai Sensen..

The XV Chris animator did their job and got me to watch Grenadier. It's pretty average for the most part (plus somewhat goofy in its gleeful horniness), but the last two episodes were pretty rad. I was kinda taken aback how relevant it is to Symphogear, XV in particular. No wonder it earned itself a reference.
Good. Now I wanna start watching my next show. <:OgawaRead:688429716507721770>
...did you not know that? <:ShirabeConcern:586404485598019604>

Sakura Trick good <:ShirabeToast:672245704118501376>
Cecil, no one forced you to watch Yaoi, that was the Tumblr algorithm getting the better of you.
Anyways, try Sakura Trick. It makes up for some lacking plotting by being gay as hell every episode. <:CagliostroSmile:672861875385401344>

Next up is...season three of Date A Live.

4 & 5 are pretty interlinked and 6 builds on the overall plot.
If you can get 5, get at least 4 as well.
<@174440042289168384> I've played loads of Yakuza. Ask away.
Yeah, you're probably right.
I use this one.
That wallpaper looks familiar.

I try to avoid the randomly grindy games.
Good games?
Aww, mine hasn't been updated for a while. Oops.
I can't imagine an orderly PSN profile.
But JRPGs are so good and eat up so much time!
I only really opt out of multiplayer stuff, RTS and strategy games.
I wanna say I'm pretty decent at playing different genres.
True to character, even back then.
Talking about Summon Night here.

Is it that much stronger than symphogear?
Why does Idolmaster get all the love?

GOTD <:MikuBliss:336657233712513024>
Now a Symphogear Dancing All Night. <:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
Ehh, I get enough of the music ingame.
Still waiting on the SMT If translation.
Only have that and Eternal Punishment left there, plus some ancient SMT.
Not like I have 95 other games to play, no siree. <:GarieSmug:336657120433012736>
<:ElfneinDrowning:336656417035517952>
Is it here yet?
Yay, P5 and Horizon have shipped. Now I wait...
But if it's the doom tank I'm thinking about, I think you need to destroy the vents evenly to spend as few turns as possible under fire.
Grinding helps
Kazuma Kiryu was robbed.
I'm curious.
Felt like everyone dismissed it on the premise and for the character design.
Valkyria Revolution.
Hopefully it'll have something of worth.
I mean people hated 2 and I liked that so...
I like reviewing games, so a weird spinoff could be fun.
I'm curious.
Valkyria Chronicles spinoff that everyone hates.
lol
It pays to be patient.
Best of last year, mayhaps.
Videogames. I got 'em.
https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/OkAytCHFTMeIq4oCXeD5

Otherwise, it's a nice touch.
Finding the yellow rope on large buildings is annoying though.
HZD's auto climbing is at least better than Uncharted and Enslaved, since you don't have to mash jump all the time.
Also, finding vantage points is way harder for me than I think it should be.
I may or may not have missed an idol and jumped up a mountain behind it instead.
Also the climbing is kinda ass.
But I've only had to go hunting for specific parts twice so far.
Oh yeah, the random drops.
I'm thinking that the game's greatest achievemnt is how fun all the busywork is.
Got to the Carja fortress.
Level 25.
Horizon Zero Dawn floored me with how good it is. I don't think I've had this much fun in a sandbox game before.
My review is linked just up there. @TechnoWhistler#8806
"Why can't all game reviews be communicated via Shinai screencaps?"
GREAT
GOOD
MEH
TRASH
I'll give you my scale.
Also, I only use Shinai for Meh and Good.
Gee, that was fast. <:KanadeSmile:341463635492601856>
Except that swapping classes screws your stats!
I already expressed my opinions on it and I'm feeling lazy.
My review of the game.
https://www.destructoid.com/--473276.phtml#post
Here we go.
Wait a bit...
That might have been my issue, i usually don't grind at all.
How much grinding are we talking here?
Strider is the shit.
What!?
I think the earlygame just turned me off. The bow is soooooooooo much better and fun.
Hell, just stunning humans was hard.
Whenever I tried Warrior, the defence of enemies outpaced my attack super hard and I couldn't do anything.
I only found the archer classes acceptable.
We usually call them "Areas". Levels if you're a freak.
...I've played to much of the Souls-games. <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
HZD goes for girth, while BB is about encounter design and perception.
It's all in what aspects they focus on.
I consider HZD a sandbox game, and BB is an action RPG.
Genres are tricky.
But it's a Souls-game, and those are usually focused dungeoncrawlers.
I mean, there are choices to be made.
BB is quite linear.
Ehhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh...
I'll never understand the hype behind it, except that people might just love the Pawn quotes.
Frankly, HZD just made me think of Dragon's Dogma and how lacking it is, in basically every regard.
Hells yeah they did.
But there isn't a ridiculous amount of things to do, so you can clear a region after a decent amount of time.
It was pretty dope.
But it gave me the perfect place to test my new bow, which managed to stun them and even trigger some harmless explosions that sent me flying back.
For example, I was hunting for some crystals on a mountain and got ambushed by a whole pack of robots.
So if you decide to go do one thing, you run into a few other things on the way.
The checklist of tasks is varied and intertwined.
Good lord, Horizon Zero Dawn has consumed me. Probably my favorite sandbox game now.
The dudes who made the video you can't load, I tagged you after I wrote that <@174440042289168384>
I found the real fanatics.
OH NO
It's up there.
Well, if you imagine a character from one thing is a character in another thing...
I like fisticuffs characters.
https://www.technobuffalo.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Tokyo-Xanadu-21.jpg
Sora in Tokyo Xanadu may not be like Bikki, but she does throw a mean punch.
God bless ya, you fanatical bastard.
https://www.backloggery.com/Kerrik
Still, I hear mine is pretty miniscule.
And that thing has to die.
Online play is time I could spend on my backlog.
I could possibly coop in bloodborne.
I do, but I am not engaged in that whole scene.

https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/legendofheroes/images/3/3d/Laura_s_arseid_sen2_stance.png/revision/latest?cb=20151124062226
I know there was someone else who played Cold Steel and pretended that Laura was Tsubasa.
Anyone here a Falcom fan?
And Ys Origin is coming to ``THE ONE``
Still, Binary Domain got a good port.
Or it's mostly a Japan game and Japanese players have Playstations.
Might be a bitch on other consoles.
At least we sorry sods in Europe get Atlus games now.
All Yakuza and all Persona would be dope on PC.
Sega has a lot of stuff they should port.
They're good civilasation.
I like the toasters of P3.
And no Metis for P3 Dancing.  <:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
P4 let's you control party members tho.
I did.
Anyone here survive the Answer?
Aww, but having your party randomly use worthless skills is fun! <:Ver:336656981144109066>
I just bought the damn thing.
Nonono
We need the P3 remake first.
BAD KALIKS
I even got the limited edition for basically nothing.
Valkyria Revolution.
P5, HZD, VR, Nier and Doom.
I bought all the PS4 games I missed last year recently.
If not, this industry is even worse than I thought.
There will be a sequel. That game printed all the money.
That's what I did, probably my favorite sandbox game yet.
The bows you can get are awesome!
Currently knicking all I can.
Snuck in there.
Otherwise, Falcom games are always a treat. I may or may not be biased.
Play Horizon, if you can. Das a good game.
Context is king, brah.
Ok, anyone wise enough to tell me why tagging sometimes fails?
Now if only they could port 1 & 2 to PC and current consoles...<:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
It's on Switch? Cool.
You speak moonspeak?
I just went with snipers and scouts in 1 & 2. It's all you need.
The one who gets debuffed by men, I reckon.
Idol then.
Also, the Dot Hack Link translation is almost done!
Been a while since 1 and I didn't try much of the DLC in 2.
Was she the idol?
Small stuff, methinks.
I did manage to get the VC2 DLC to work on the emulator at least.
I think it's without DLC stuff.
Patched ROM.
My backlog is...complicated.
Since like 2 years back...
Already have it. <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
I'm curious about which game has the most obscene bosses. They always cheat super hard.
I still have 3 to play as well.
We shall see.
Now my copy of Star Ocean 5 on the other hand...
I bet it's fine.
I also got the UAC version of Doom, which had a poster and some textile patches.
A 12 song soundtrack.
Are you gonna cheat on Axel?
I too am a KH nerd.
UGGGGGGGGGGGH
Oh god, KH3 is gonna get a final mix, isn't it?
Man, there really are more importers than I thought.
No spoilers, plz.
Also, that Half-Life thing was weird.
All who haven't, put some money into some Falcom games!
FUCK YEAH THE DO!
I sorta like FF, but what other series does with its foundation is often more interesting.
Complete game with super sexy expansions.
Can't they all just do the From Soft thing?
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
Oh wait, isn't FFXV like Borderlands 2 where the GOTY edition isn't complete?
Read that in the Sterling voice.
I mean, I bet it lost them money.
But it's a singleplayer game, how is it dying? <:HibikiWhat:336656482907193344>
FF14?
I wanna give a shoutout to all the fun extras XSEED add to their PC ports.
Haven't looked at it.
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Was there some performance stuff i missed?
They did have the demo, but my PC version didn't have problems.
Their management must be split somewhere.
And yet, they do have some nice PC ports, like Type-0.
Good thing I don't buy Senran Kagura, or cosmetic DLC.
"We only need like 15 million copies to break even, it's fine"
"Hey, let's make a game for 8 years and then support it for 2 more."
SE also can't budget for shit.
Falcom and XSEED are still pure, dammit!
It's fun to have interest in different genres. I love both JRPGs and Immmersive Sims(System Shock, Deus Ex), for example.
Sony, Sega and Capcom can do good, but also be utter crap.
I'm less a fanboy (except for Falcom), I mostly just accept companies.
Heh.
<:ElfneinBullying:421432763078410241>
Are they scary?
I've yet to meet a proper Nintendo fanboy in reality.
Now there's a surprise. <:GarieWink:336657101273169921>
How dare they have differing tastes to me.
Fucking Japan. No honour.
Curse you, pink marshmallow!
Well, the popularity of 1 on PC surprised them.
I STILL want a PC version of God Hand.
Man, Sega and Capcom could do so much cool stuff with certain ports.
I doubt they would do that, but Ys Seven looks pretty nice after its upscaling.
Sorry, 2 & 3.
Awesome games hiding like ninja.
That's Falcom for you.
NA version took a while.
2014?
Love you, Brittany!
And from what I know, there's so much text that the XSEED translators will actually die this time.
3 isn't out in English, hence the naming.
Sen no Kiseki in Japanese.
Trails of Cold Steel.
Sen games are so long.
Whyyyyyyyyy?
Is it even good?
But it also sorts your games in alphabetical order, which is nice when you need to sort your physical ones.
It payed to have started early!
Many of which I'll probably give up on.
https://www.backloggery.com/Kerrik
78% done, 100 games left!
Ha! I'm done with my PS3 games!
I have like a dozen JRPGs to try.
Dig into your backlog, brah.
Anti-yay?
Was like the one Wii U game I wanted.
I'm so glad Bayo 2 got ported. Gonna get a Switch in a few years.
*wink wink*
I think Ruben and Bosch did some unannounced voice work together.
I've been denied Bayonetta 2 due to finances, so I'm clamouring for some proper character action.
V shall come to.
DMC5!
Shit, there is something else I want on...
Ehh, Gods Eater wasn't for me.
Yakuza Kiwami 2...
There has to be some more.

Ys 8 PC...
Shadows Die Twice...
KH3...
Wait, what games am I even excited about now?
Well, they're hiring.  <:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
Lingering Will is cool. Terra, less so.
**3 DIFFERERENT INSTAKILLS**
**5 FORMS**
**16 HEALTHBARS**
That fight is gonna be dope.
I suppose they wanna do KH3 "correctly".
Am I gonna have to do Disney homework watching before KH3?
No one knows it's Marvel?
~~Mansex~~ Xemnas already did the lightsaber stuff.
Lord Vader secret boss please.
Also, probably cheaper.
Durante did some magic.
ALL of the options.
Cold Steel PC is sexy.
No, do PC!
Fie is cool.
Slim pickings otherwise.
Except she's smarter and has bigger boobs.
Laura IS Tsubasa.
You don't understand.
Do you like Tsubasa, Techno?

She can also kick robots to death, so that's fun.
I guess?
But MAN, does she have some juicy lines.
Well, she's pretty controlled.
Gropes people just a bit much.
Uncomfortably so, even.

No, what you mean with your sentence.

Wouldn't you know it, I have a blog for this as well.
That was the porn tycoon game, right?
For the genre, at least.
Also, isn't it pretty vanilla?
I've heard that it's actually one of the best match 3 games out there.
Nekopara, or 18 games at once?
Gotta stay varied.
I'm playing Horizon, Thief 3 and Tokyo Xanadu myself.
Such as?
I recommend starting with FC.
So, you can explore and read stuff everywhere.
But Trails is extremely suited for that, since every NPC has some story that updates with the main story.
I just like cutting down on needless backtracking and trial & error.
Right, what I assumed.
Your expressions confuse me slightly.
You mean that you like doing that?
Especially in Trails, with its missable books that you trade for ultimate weapons.
Saves you time and replays.
I recommend using guides.
Isn't it? Free time is for losers.
<:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
You might as well add all the Falcom games on PC from my blog.
<@200030864497704960> Never. Our dreams are dead.
The experiment has proved succesful.
It's my bedroom tv.
28 inches or so?
I propped up my tv on a chair next to my bed. Dis gonna be comfy.
Can you? Well and truly? Is it within your power?
I hate when it's easier to find secret collectibles than to find the way forward.

Fucking ninnies, the whole lot.
I sure am looking forward to God of War (2018).
Gotta love modern naming conventions!
He's in PoP (2008).
I always make it a game to suss him out while playing games.
And everyone in Fallout New Vegas.

I was joking. He's talking about the Hero Academia game.
Rampage Hero of My Justice: Exvius?
Meanwhile, Falcom has farted out like 6 full length JRPGs in like 5 years.
What, you expect them to have PLANNED it out?
(Use of GIF of a NIS character was completely accidental. <:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227> )
**GOOD**
Oh hey, the Ys 8 Steam page is on fire.
Good plan. Too bad you bought one in the first place.
11 years old this year. Fancy that.
Dude, Ys 8 brings modern beast cards to their knees.
And no, Nier hasn't been touched since release.
It is, but it's quite shaky, even modded.
Also, a physical copy serves me better.
Space.
Sorta.
And the PC port is close to playable.
Nier is available.

Ys 8 on PC seems like trash and it's sold out in Sweden on PS4...
Ugggggggh.
I am a bastion of BB info.
Anything you need to ask about?
Ok, found the mad lad.
CD Rom is tough, yo.
Loran Darkbeast is *the* worst.
Your ass is not prepared.
Child.
<:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
That means the Loran chalice.
Oh boy!
What do you need? I can look.
Also, boss name spoilers.
There's the chart. Has locations of items for CDs.
https://www.bloodborne-wiki.com/2015/04/chalice-dungeon-flow-chart.html
The dungeons, cannot.
The Crow can be cheesed.
Depends.
I recommend the progression chart.
Wow, strong.
Are you sick of dungeons yet?
Not as bad as the dungeons, but still.
It will devour you.
Pro-tip: Don't do it in NG+.
Axe is OP and very fun.
I sure hope you were a good boy and got the DLC.
Most are found to the side in the dream.
Yeah, BB tutorials are pretty bad.
Not worth it to me.
Good on ya for mastering DS3 parries.
No range or poise break.
Eww, daggers in DS3.
https://youtu.be/p8BIDP6WRTI
That reminds me.
But interesting.
Weird.
But once you do, other games lose their shine.
It's tough to love.
Ohhhhhh, opinions. <:CarolYandere:424047704826707980>
DLC spoilers.
Only read the CD part tho.
See my blog thingie for more reasons why the stat system is bonkers! <:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
I recommend a physical run and an ARC run.
When you get it, enemies start getting BLT resistance by the boatloads.
Evelyn isn't much worth it.
At least the DLC has some decent BLT weapons.
Ahh, I know those temptations.
>20 BLT
Gotta hit softcaps for your quality weapon.
25/25 first, yo.
*I can feel the salt begin to emerge*
Man, the stat system makes me mad.
HP rune plus Vial runes is also nice.
BB stamina is basically free.
Now END, that's the noob trap.
Or at the very least resistant to 8 string combos.
Makes you invincible.
VIT gouging in BB is stupid strong.
I sure hope you didn't level damage like an idiot and instead got 50 VIT.
Have fun in the well. <:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
Weeeeeeeeeeeeb.

https://www.destructoid.com/blogs/Kerrik52/let-s-bitch-about-bloodborne-3-3-chalice-dungeon-special--437779.phtml#post
Here, let me share my tales from the dungeons.
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
King's Field too.
I am also an expert on the rest of the series.
So as long as you don't forget to cancel it EVERY time, you're fine.
The one in BB gives you very few frames, but you can chain into a dash quickly.
What I mean is that the knockdown in earlier games gave you lengthy I-frames.
That's a stun/grab tho.
So spam that circle button! <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Fun fact: BB's knockdown state isn't as forgiving as in DS1/DS2 and it expects you to cancel it as soon as possible.
(I love From Soft. I really do.)
Good thing they put in so much money into it and didn't just rely on inflated numbers! <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
It has the content of 3 dungeons, you do like 10.
Quite.
Got very salty.
Alternatively, you can read my thesis on the awfulness of the Chalice Dungeons.
But I have beat Laurence with Beast Claws. <:MariaSunglasses:336656798687690752>
Good job. OOK always takes me a while.
Play Valkyrie Profile 2. That game scales up into like NG+98.
NG+ scaling is indeed messy.
Thanks for checking it out! <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Or at least a responce to my Chalice Dungeon rant perhaps?
<@231025503643893770> Any fun BB adventures to report?
<:ChrisEnraged:423196924368388105>
But sometimes you misstime it and...
Smart.
I despise it.
That's why.
Say, have you found yourself rolling after eating a hit much more often in DS3?
But the gravest sin is the input buffer.
*It's even buggier than DS1*
You can parry something, yet still get a partial.
I fucking hate them.
Oh yeah, DS3 partials.
Honestly, I think DS2 parries are the closest to preoprly balanced, but they're not quite there.
Yeah, but the Caestus makes you eat shit if you miss.
So the one you can actually parry is difficult to notice.
I find the animations of attacks to be too erratic.

*looks at Saki's new avatar*
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
Been stuck in the 78-82% range for a while.
Still at like 78% completion though!

I haven't snowboarded in years.
The style of it is literally Guitar Hero though.
My Monster Tricks break the space time continuum! <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Boo!
Not sure. Isn't Steep a tad...realistic?
thought it was worse.
Weird. But fun.
Ye.
Is this when I break up the conversation to talk about SSX On Tour? <:GarieWink:336657101273169921>
Weird show.
You're not my dad!
Respect for the game +1
https://youtu.be/rjCBV6o_DSE
Dude, Stand Up And Shout is in the SSX On Tour soundtrack!
Sorry, SSX guy over here.
<@!102691114762371072> Most of the Atlus games are easy to emulate. I'm helping a friend with P4.
<:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
Hyper Light Drifter is fun
I never really tried to master them, merely surving was good enough.
I think I've had enough SSX On Tour. It's gotten pretty hard and there are other games to play. Good game though.
Ha! I've been at SSX On Tour and cleared two whole medals!
<:MariaYell:336657352264646657>
I love it!
The Zestiria opening is so lame.
https://youtu.be/SfQkGqno85Q
I just hate that JRPGs go out of print or up in price so fast.
Ouch.
This might sound strange, but I like playing games.
There are a quite a few on PS3/PS4.
Not an option past Gamecube/PS2 era, Sparkle.
<:ElfneinBullying:421432763078410241>
Which would entail buying the semi-modern ones before they go out of print...
Crudsicles. I've been playing Tales of Zestiria and I'm tempted to get into the series proper.
Never stop Japan, never stop.

Gotta be paranoid about JRPG saves.
Yeah rip.
I would tell you to emulate it, but you'd need special equipment to transfer your saves.
I actually have to try!
Quite. Def Edition especially.
<:TsubasaDisgust:349013662775902209>
Look up the succubus boss fight.
Story is diarrhea of the mouth.
Good gameplay, fun exploring.
I'm actually having fun playing DMC: Devil May Cry. Should I feel ashamed?
😎
Indeed.
https://twitter.com/Polygon/status/994217704440651776
Unless they speed up the critical animation, I'm out.
I remain unimpressed.
<:GarieWink:336657101273169921>

Free stuff!
And there is Last Guardian VR!
<:HibikiWhat:336656482907193344>
...why the hell does Zestiria have EVA costumes?
I feel like buying Tales of Symphonia on the Humble Store sale, but playing it on an emulator. I hear the PC port is still hot garbage.
https://store.steampowered.com/app/15700/Oddworld_Abes_Oddysee/
Free Oddworld!
You should see all the complex tips the game wants me to take note of.
It's developed, I tell you what.
Attacks are tied to directions used and the three types exist in a rock-paper-scissor triangle.
And I haven't even gotten to the combat yet!
Then there's the lord of the land system, which is tied to exploration and buffs.
Not to mention strategy and skills you don't want the AI to use.
Support talents for out of battle stuff.
Then there's fusion, skill stacking and title mastery.
Which has its own Mystic Art.
Not to mention Mystic Artes and the Armatized form.
Characters have Martial Artes, Hidden Artes and Seraphic Artes.
The game has like 15 subsystems to master.
It's pretty fun!
I'm starting to learn how to customize the characters and play them.
I think Tales of Zestiria has finally clicked for me.
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
https://i1.wp.com/gocurrycracker.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/torpedo.jpg?ssl=1
Hehe, I pickep up noise cancelling headphones in Tales of Zestiria.


Nope, Geah lewds ain't my thing. I only have crops for jokes.

Fun documentary.
https://youtu.be/_j6ZHkg5BtE

So is her presence at the concerts.
Still, her singing is baller.
...of course she has.
Please tell me she is just focusing on her singing.
<:ChrisSmile:336656717553074176>
Woo.
Does Ayahi have any other good roles?
<:HibikiShock:336656371611074580>
...is this just the secondary gacha channel?
Stheno? Man, that boss was an asshole in Tales of Zestiria.
Wait, Nana might be ok at English.
I meant the singer being competent.
Oh yeah, she's the one Geah that knows English.
Haven't listened to her regular stuff much, save for "Happiness".
Especially when she flips into "Chris mode".
I've seen it in loads of edited shitposts.
I still need a Switch for 2&3.
<:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
Thankfully, I have a charging station.
It easily overloads if I plug in ONE controller.
I have, I think it's the console.
I've come to the conclusion that PS3 controllers are a pain. Or that my PS3 just doesn't want to charge things anymore.
It is the same attack, it's just that delimbed foes do more grabs.
https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/boards/703246-ninja-gaiden-3-razors-edge/65909594
Oh hey:
DMC is SO EASY in comparison.
I feel like I should return to this when the temperature is lower.
Time for bed.
And the...
And the turrets.
And the grunts.
And the lasers.
Chopper dead, patience thin.
You instakill enemies who've lost a limb.
Cool. I've just gotten the hang of the limb-less counter thing.
There was a tutorial thing about evading those and countering.
Also, dibs on Basa, since I'm playing Ninja Gaiden.
The QTEs, or the suicide prevention attacks?
Welp.
You, <@193408538909868033> ?
Any advice for 3?
Anyway, back up to normal mode!
3 is just...
Sigma 1 was a journey, while 2 was pretty normal.
I had to bump it down to easy.
HELL YEAH, I DID THE IZUNA DROP!
Feels pretty ridiculous.
Is it harder?
Razor's Edge.
I WILL WIN
Ninja Gaiden 3 is an asshole. My ninja skills are rusty.
It's getting bigger! <:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
Figures. Just like Rachel in Sigma 1.
Was Ayane added for RE?
I need to go back to the other two and just try to master them more.
Same as in Sigma 2.
Yes.
<:MariaShock:423196877354303498>
...and the boobs still react to controller movement.
Oh hey, Ayane for next session.
And promising yourself not to play games on your phone. Try Pokemon instead.
<:ElfneinBullying:421432763078410241>
Gonna be fun.
I'll keep you posted on NG3.
I could bitch about Souls-games for longer, but there is sleep to be had.
Having 3 27% gems is a bit different from the 15% you get from treasure.
But BB split power between gems and upgrade levels.
I mostly meant upgrades.
But that's awful.
Still possible in BB.
Easily.
...you can at least reach maximum power in those games before NG+ begins.
Welp, then you're just mad bananas good/crazy.
<:CarolShock:430939013235474432>
...did you actually grind gems?
<:TsubasaYareYare:407397617451139073>
BB NG+ scaling is pain.
Ouch. Why?
I did beat Laurence with Beast Claws once. That, was a journey.
It's OP as hell.
If you wanna have some fun in BB, level health.
Frankly, this felt more in the Laurence direction.
Ok, Ludwig phase 2 is a bastard.
Ha! Those fights are cake!
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
...after dying like 30 times.
I killed that dinosaur so hard!
Day 3 of Ninja Gaiden 3 defeated.
That's my experience. Good for coding too.
16 GB bahbee!
And I maxed out my slots last year.
But this one still does all I want.
It's ok, math is hard.
Yay?
This one is like 5 years old.
No clue.
Here be my phone:
It's even so graphically lame that I can't be tempted into phone games!
Does all I need.
It's a Nexus 5.
Also, my phone is old.
I use that battery for reading and chatting.
Yes, mobile games are not for me.
Gacha is sin. <:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
Oh yeah, Ys: MoC comes out on PC. <:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
I need to play all the 26 JRPGs I need to play, P5 included.
PC/PS4/Switch is the way.
I am getting the hang of things, the claws are fun.
Maybe?
IT'S FUCKING MURDER
Newer one.
And holy crap, she has so much HP!
Ninja Gaiden 3 status: I am too tired for the water tank lady.
Sure, you skip the P5 lewds and go to GoW instead.
<:ShirabeStare:336659688236122113>
Something tells me there'll be DLC or an abundance of cheap copies later.
I'll get it later.
Ys 8. Yakuza.
Well, that's a shame.
Buuuut that was probably because I turned on aim support.
It did for me.
I completed Thief 3 recently.
Immersive sims?
Shooters are fair game for controllers.
But I only play Immersive Sims with M+K.
Yes, PS4.
<:HibikiTired:422925410490253313>
Time for sleep and school...
A good end to the weekend, I say.
<:KirikaGay:336657049540755457>
And now, I have level 3 weapons.
Never had to trigger a boss' autoblock to cancel counters before.
Interesting fight though.
<:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
Fish lady aint no match for my stick.
Ninja Gaiden 3 update, <@193408538909868033>
Yes.
I should play them myself some day...
<:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
Dat game is spooky.
<:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>

<@292451539136806913> Keep us updated on your JRPG journey when you start it. This channel deserves more than gacha.
<:GarieWink:336657101273169921>
Yes, it's like a dungeon. A tower dungeon.
I know 3 had the Gungnir spear, more or less.
<:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
Hear that, <@292451539136806913> ?;
Only played 3, which was lovely.
That's where the Kadingnir joke about game guides came from!
But for a Geah fan, Wild Arms is always a good option.
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
If you have any questions or want games to emulate as well, just ask!
<@292451539136806913> Trails in the Sky 1-3, Trails of Cold Steel 1-2, Tokyo Xanadu eX+, FF Type-0, Valkyria Chronicles, Zwei 1-2, Ys 1-7 (not all games are on PC and the port of 8 is still bad from what I hear), Recettear, Gurumin, LiEat, Fortune Summoners and Grandia 2.
I play Dark Souls to relax. <:Ver:336656981144109066>
Seems like better timewaster than the gacha of the month. <:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
I believe that.
<@106866895076003840> What do you look for in a JRPG and are you scared of loads upon loads of worldbuilding?
No?
Virginia tries befriending and there is literally a Gungnir spear.
The Symphogear is strong with it.
3 is the one I've played.
*4 & 5 didn't get released in Europe* <:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
DO IT
Like Wild Arms.
There are dozens of JRPGs to play.
That's *one*.
More player focus than characters.
In the western school of thought, Outside.
Made in Japan.
Dark Souls games are just western RPGs, except good.
Then play some good ones, you weeb!
Play it.
Lily, TitS is amazeballs.

Still, there's a whole world of games out there, not dictated by the will of the missadjusted die.
I guess Diablo counts.
🔥

...but 80% done. <:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
Mine is at like 110.
I was not prepared.
There's SUFFERING too!
Frankly, almost all of the Trails characters are great, Lily. So much to learn about them.
She's a tomboy who loves collecting bugs.
With a stick!
Good, because Estelle is the bestest!
<:GarieWink:336657101273169921>
Trails of Cold Steel for you then, Boots. Just know that she's only a party member in parts of the game.
<:HibikiWhat:336656482907193344>
But that'd be TiTS.
<:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
The second series has a shameless lesbian in a biker suit who punches stuff.
Has worldbuilding and hugs.
Is good game, Boots. Buy it.
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
TitS.
Trails in the Sky.

Like ninja!
More like learning how to stab the game in the face when it least expects it.
Kinda hitting a groove after getting some HP.
I'm thinking that NG+ will be a blast.
<:Germain:421434126856486912>
I like them against alchemists.
I'll look forward to it, Saki.
Also, dual katanas are pretty ok. The chain, less so.
I almost beat a challenge skull!
The Hayabusa village chapter was a real breather.
<@!193408538909868033> Ninja Gaiden 3 update.
The only rhythm/combat game I've played is Patapon.

Nevermind, fuck hard mode.
Yeah, gotta try the others later. Currently playing around a bit in hard mode.
Also, parries are good for building ninpo, it seems.

<@!102691114762371072> As compared to Big Boss? Or Alice?
Yakuza Kiwami started.
*still has to try them*
They're the greatest secret in the industry.
In fact, y'all need more Falcom in your lives.
Ys 8, Bayonetta and a whole lot of indies come to mind.
There's probably some fun stuff there.
Like, we've had no equivalent to the Dead Space games.
Yeah, but we're missing the juicy multiplats.
They have really slowed down.
Still, I have like no games when compared to my PS3.
A PS4, of course. <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I'm happy with my box of joy at least.
I never said it was soon. <:GarieWink:336657101273169921>

I recommend Origin.
Check some gameplay.
**ON SPEED**
It's like a regular action RPG.
Ys Seven has a boss with like 25 unique attacks. It's nuts!
And the gameplay matches!
All their music is so hype!

I just wanna sell you all on Falcom. Listen to this:
<:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
<@!102691114762371072> Good thing you have me then.
MAJIMA POLE DANCE
CROSSDRESSING MAJIMA IS THE BESTEST THING
Ok, one of the hostesses seems to be REALLY into women. That's different.
I'll just do the substories.
...
<:MariaShock:423196877354303498>
All right, got to the bikini beetle babe minigame in Yakuza Kiwami.
I'll post those soon.
<:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
Try a controller then.
It's weird to go back to.
>implying the two games have even lose to comparable upgrade systems
He gives you SO much.
And I expected the exp curve to work.
Not me.
Why else would I even go near a catcher machine?
Yakuza Kiwami.
Sorry, turned in the quest!
Now, for Mesuking.
...but you'd need a video.
calm down
I got 3 UFO catcher prizes in a row!
<:GarieWink:336657101273169921>
There are 80.
<:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
Half the quests in Yakuza Kiwami done!
Still, quiet streaming is rather boring.
Gonna get in a call soon.
Nah, it's fine.
Aww, no talking.
Yes.
...the boobie movies?
Frankly, only DDD is crazy.
I'll just stick to my Kingdom Hearts, thank you very much.

It's the most convoluted timetravel multi dimension garbage imaginable.
The plot OFFENDS me.
I tried BB once.
Good podcast.
Oh hey, I think that's the Symphocast guys.
<:TsubasaDisgust:349013662775902209>
38 quests left in Kiwami.
Good thing 5 is getting a physical release finally.
Still gotta get 6.
2 is so much better.
Also, the lock-on is complete garbage.
You start with a shitty combo and no heat moves.
<:MariaYell:336657352264646657>
I beat the bowling quest and cleared out all the Majima stuff!
Hell yeah!
<:KirikaGay:336657049540755457>
A gentle soul, who would never kill a man.
Rest was legit.
Kiryu's suit was super tacky, or something.
Oh yeah.
I did like the hostesses in Zero. I wonder how much they're based on the real people.
Progress?
<:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
She only took the job to be around cute girls at work.
<:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
Ok, one of the hostesses in Yakuza Kiwami is 100% lesbo.
https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/42772bfad64a64e9290bfe0d79d1a79ae743714360332423d10fbad30e765e44.jpg?w=800&h

<:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>

Ye.
Rina, a hostess in Yakuza Kiwami.
calm down
AND SHE FOLLOWS LADY IDOLS.
<:KanadeSinging:421432676789256202>
OH MY GOD, SHE SINGS ANIME SONGS FOR KARAOKE.
...in which game does he shoot people? Only cutscenes count!
Ahh yes, the hidden climb level.
Not worth the effort.
Nope, only the OG games.
Well, I have gotten through 5 Souls-games and 3 Ninja Gaiden ones, so I'll hopefully be good.
No thanks.
<:ElfneinBullying:421432763078410241>
Now, Hunter's crystals...
Not that I found it that hard. <:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
Hopefully.
I swear to god if they joke about the trolley for the Spyro 2 trailer.
Though come <:ChrisSmile:336656717553074176>-mas, KH3 and Spyro shall be mine.
Next on the list is buying Prey and Ys:MoC.
Seems like SE wants to sell the poor thing though.
I've been eyeing Mankind Divided, but I don't really need it.

<:HibikiShock:336656371611074580>
<@193408538909868033> Before the mods see us in the wrong channel.
I guess this sidestory was a success!
Huh, Kiryu probably boning her didn't seem as bad as I thought.
<:HibikiWhat:336656482907193344>
...why is a softcore video of the actress playing?
<:ChrisSmile:336656717553074176>
And now Kiryu went on a nice speech on gender stuff.
Bless you, lesbo hostess in Yakuza Kiwami.

Prepare To Die Agan, the Scorched Contract and Scholar of the Second Sin.
I've been thinking about trying some of the world remix mods for DS1 & DS2.
Ok.
Yay? I thought we were gonna get some Geah references posted.
Would make for a good adventure, eh? <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Good mod.
And the Capra Demon died for no reason. For us both.
We both modded it.
It does not like co-op.
So, I tried the Prepare To Die Again mod for Dark Souls...
Nothing, except for Unravel 2 and sad German game.
They barely had gameplay!

It has Kirika and Tsubasa's VAs.
Now there's a poor idea. I'd save for Shining Resonance Refrain instead.
The mechanics were the bare minimum, but it has soul.
I like it.
Welp, El Shaddai was a trip and a half. <:MariaShock:423196877354303498>

Level nothing but health and you'll become a god.
Frankly, most of BB is if you don't submit to Health, the one true god.
Well, Ludwig is a bastard.
Did you grind gems then? Or are you just persistant?
I disagree. The scaling goes off the wall.
I've beaten it many times, just not in NG+.
Story is sengoku jidai crap, but it's fun.
It is.
That game is a bit mean.
Also, I've gotten to the second region of Nioh.
I haven't done it myself, due to the skyhigh health of bosses in NG+.
Isn't she harder to stunlock due to more health?
Really?

On a Windows 7 computer. <:TsubasaYareYare:407397617451139073>
It crashed a ridiculous amount of times before I set it to Win 7 compatability mode.

The thing that recommends you games on Steam.
Well, the discovery queue is ass. <:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>

No clue.
Worth some tinkering and perhaps a refund during the sale they're having.
It hasn't crashed since! <:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>

No, just a better use of time. <:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
Might as well grind to level 9999 in Disgaea. <:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>

~~Just stop staining your soul with gacha. Jesus watches.~~
I DO, I DO!
Nevermind! <:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
They'll remain as such until you start playing something really numbercrunchy. With spreadsheets!

To hell with that, we've got Not!Symphogear the game coming out soon.
<:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
I heard you people liked magical girls.

Especially when you get used to it, but then something even weirder gets the treatment.
The way anime...animes things is always weird.
<:CarolShock:430939013235474432>
"Is anime normalizing gun culture in Japan???"
Colour me surprised.
>Bamco rushing devs <:Cag:423197445644615711>
Why bother? That doesn't even sound "funny bad".

Really shit type. <:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
Technically framerate. <:GarieWink:336657101273169921>
*current year argument about framerates*

The models don't have the dick, is that it?
Y'all deserve a Gundam game as good as ZoE: Second Runner
But not a raging trashfire?
Do tell.
The last one comes to PC in less than a month. <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
GOOD
But maaaaaaaaaaaaaaaan.
It had potential, moreso than the other two.
<:ChrisAngry:336656958272700417>
*and 3
The game better live up to the hype and break through my emotionless core! <:HibikiEager:407398049531559937>
I'll be with you as soon as I start it. <:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
Old anime translating songs is...a thing. <:HibikiShock:336656371611074580>
No, the perfection is that they didn't translate any songs. <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Dual language option too.
And this fancy version comes with non-canon dates with Nana's character. <:GarieWink:336657101273169921>
<:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
Nana, Ai and Elements Garden, yo.
Might get that for christmas if my family is willing.
Right, Spyro.
It's so nice to not be into most AAA stuff. <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
Then I'm pretty set until KH3 and DMC5.
But Ys and Death's Gambit are coming soon though. Can't forget Shining Resonance either.
Here's my haul for the sale. Not much interesting left to buy.

<@!127644949884698624> This is a game about a transgirl in a !NotSailor Moon fandom discovering herself on the early internet.

Just posting DMC memes.
Huh? No.
https://twitter.com/PG_kamiya/status/1014204589891940352
But if they can keep the charm and music intact...
Mechanically, they're extremely simple. It's barely a platformer sometimes.
Isn't it nice that the nostalgia wave has finally caught up to us? <@!193408538909868033> <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
And? Won't get us the game faster.
I imagine he's like angry Kratos.
If the character acts like I hope he does, then it's fine.
*One giant step for mankind*
*Determined*
Unless you love the Sengoku Jidai. <:GarieWink:336657101273169921>
Majestic as can be, not to mention the only interesting character. <:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
I'm almost done with it, finally.
For real though, BB Maria and Nioh Maria make an eerie pair.
Sounds like you need to play some Nioh DLC. <:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227> <@193408538909868033>

Good palette cleanser after Star Ocean 3.

That dungeon suuuuuucked!<:HibikiTired:422925410490253313>
Star Ocean 3 is mean. <:ElfneinBullying:421432763078410241>
Wrench for life. It took me through the first two floors.
Made all the hoarding worth it!
The auto rifle you get late game is so fun.
Man, fuck that family of words.
Strength?
Strenght and guns are so good.
I never leveled health. <:GarieWink:336657101273169921>
I made it through with TK and selective leveling as I needed it.
Like pulling 12 pieces of loot to you over the whole game. <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
It's fine otherwise!
Man, psi sucks donkey balls.
I played it once! <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Ever played System Shock 2?
Ghosting is fun yes.
Now to shelf these games for a few months. Back to the JRPGs!
All right, Thi4f, Dishonored and Prey seem to behave on ***MAX*** settings. No refund for me. <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Really, you should only buy upgrades.
I never buy them. Saving is often good enough.
I'd kinda suggest starting over and collecting more blue orbs as well as grinding using Phantom when he chases you.
Or load old save.
Back to main menu. <:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
My Steam downloads are stable for the moment.
Same for the camera, you can adapt, for the most part.
Well, it pounded me down on easy at first. It takes time.
<@!98541382393688064> So, how's DMC1 treating you?
>121 games in the backlog
Now to see if my computer likes Thi4f, Dishonored and Prey. <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Well, his AI is dumb, so if you go more more gaurdbreaks than attacks in your combo, he doesn't counter attack fast enough.
<:Germain:421434126856486912>
FUCKER CAN'T TAKE GAURDBREAKS FOR SHIT!
<:MariaYell:336657352264646657>
WOO, I BEAT THE BONUS BOSS IN NIOH!
Play more and you might get a Bravo. <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Cool.
Protip: The DLC in NG+ has loads of good drops, one mission in particular.
Better bring your A-game, bastard's tough.
<@!193408538909868033> I'm grinding to beat the bonus boss in Nioh so I can finally remove this behemoth from my SSD. I hope you got the DLC (Or PC version), as I think you'd like the fight.

<:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
Wait for the glue to dry, then we reassemble.
Ok, controller gluing done.
<:ElfneinDrowning:336656417035517952>
Sadly, I'm in a Dark Souls session, so it'll have to wait.
But this is a button, not a cable, so I can probably fix it.
My *new* controller is also faulty. <:ChrisAngry:336656958272700417>
I've heard that they are rather obscure with the humor, so it might work.
Seems like fabricated waifuism.
Neps never appealed to me.
Nethack? <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Otherwise...
Not super exciting, but the random levels work out well. There's no progression between runs though.
https://store.steampowered.com/app/358830/Good_Robot/
Ehh...Good Robot?
Ok, buttons from the other controller seem promising.
Maybe if I cannibalize the other one...
Fuuuuuuuuck, button broke. Going back in...
Ok, DS4 configured everywhere. Good lord.
The dumb thing is that I have another controller with proper switches.
Only cost me $30. <:ElfneinDrowning:336656417035517952>
<@!231025503643893770> I surrender. This bumper switch is faulty and I can't saulder. DS4Windows it is...
Eyy.
Sure feels like it.
That's my post-apovalyptic franchise of choice.
Where  does that leave Metro?
Lies.
What? What about Maria then?
Well, Angel Attack is ok. <:GarieWink:336657101273169921>
Same for the minigames. <:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
Bayo QTEs suck canoly. <:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
I mean, Musou is in the character action *direction...* <:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
*Now if only we could get action games with more waifus and save our poor friends*
Thank you for being a character action person in a sea of gacha.<:DMJii:458047433067200512> <@193408538909868033>
Man, God Hand makes me work up a sweat. I've still got the skills though. Sadly, they barely help.
<:HibikiTired:422925410490253313>
Ok, now I sleep.
Burn in hell gachaaaaaaaaa!
https://media.giphy.com/media/11FiDF2fuOujPG/giphy.gif
And people bitch about swimming in DMC1.
QTEs need to be easy and clever. <:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
<:HibikiEager:407398049531559937>
Now God Hand on the other hand.
And worse, they give you the button before you're allowed to press it.
The game is also funny, which is rare. <:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
And the second time features a loud noise. <:GarieWink:336657101273169921>
The IGN review complained about enemies spawning from nowhere, which happens in the game TWICE.
Problems arrive if you forget how many enemies you're up against and turn around wildly.
You have a radar and walls go poof if you put the camera through them.
It's a singleplayer fighting game.
But trust me, it works.
I getcha.
What's your impressions from streams?
Nor how ball-bustingly hard it is.
But I cannot understate its quality.
Might as well, it's kinda pricey now.
Otherwise, you could probably emulate it, but I haven't had any luck.
It's available on PSN if you have a PS3. *wink wink*
They had complete freedom, since no one at Capcom cared.
Yes, before they died.
And thanks to the variable difficulty, it never becomes boring!
They threw graphics to the wind and just focused on the visceral feel of the punching.
It's just...so correct as a product.
The Super Best Friends started an LP of it recently, which revived my interest.
Ok, so God Hand is the greatest game ever made.
WITH FÖD <:Germain:421434126856486912>
Tag me when you return!
Aww. It deserves ownership.
<:HibikiEager:407398049531559937>
Anyway, can we talk about God Hand when you come back? I played some yesterday and it remains excellent.
I swear you can.
Ok, see ya!
How you can block their explosion once their stuck on you, I'll never know.
Fuckassery, that's what.
With goddamn exploding kunai! <:ChrisAngry:336656958272700417>
So. Many. NINJAS.
1 was basically the survival horror game DMC1 looked to be.
2 was easy, right?
All I rember is fear. And pain.
I should go back to 1 & 2.
She was in Sigma 2. Same for halberd lady.
Oh, Ayane. Oops.
I think Black added Rachel, while  Sigma 2 added Agane.
NG is like the only series that changes so much between versions.
Kinda funny that they just snipped away a whole area.
<@!193408538909868033> But Sigma 2 removed the crap worm boss, right?
But is it as edgy as P3?
JC is boring, P5 shall be played.
Ok, CotN doesn't seem like my thing, same for almost all Roguelikes.
On my birthday wish list. <:Cag:423197445644615711>
Anyway, namedrop some more games and I'll share my feelings.
Got JRPGs to play.
...later.
Gonna give Fallout one a spin.
Nope, ES ain't my thing.
I played it on PS3. <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Doesn't help that the American setting isn't for me.
I respect NV, but damn, that engine is liquid ass.
*I knew the Germans were my brethren*
<:MikuBliss:336657233712513024>
Mostly for the combat.
Ok, I dislike Dragon's Dogma and Fallout.
We have to differ on *something*.
Does your good taste ever end? <@!193408538909868033>
Russian hat! <:MariaYell:336657352264646657>
Do we have dual langage?
<@!102691114762371072>

In the **near future**, mankind stands divided.
Meaningful **choices** and **consequences**.
Oh come on, DE: Mankind Divided!
I don't thinj I'll ever play Witcher, since I'd want to play the whole series.
Welp, now I gotta go do stuff. <:ShirabePout:336656831978012712>
But I had enough fun.
I grew bored of BB due to the craptacular build variety.
Frankly, all the NG games make me feel like Itagaki is judging me silently. <:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
Eh, BB get's kinda samey. It has other strengths than combat though.
*flashbacks to Razor's Edge* <:HibikiShock:336656371611074580>
Besides God Hand, I'm in the DMC camp.
What's your specific flavour of action game, outside?
The game has *fractal* grinding!
What latooni said.
Plot is cool though.
Not my thing.
Here's one I tried: Disgaea
The joke game? Not checked it out.
The PS2 still surprises me.
I haven't done much PS1 digging.
Ohh.
Is this a daily mission?
Wait, what?
<:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
Saki with the timely interjections.
Nah, that was something else.
Maybe a demo, rings a tankshaped bell.
Never played it.
What?
C'mon, hit me with some weird ones you like.
Are we done namedropping games then?
calm down
SOUNDS LIKE SOME PEOPLE NEED TO PLAY GOD HAND OVER THERE
Isn't the thing that games aren't art over there?
Well, that's where Danishes come from.
listen here u lil shit
It's even a Swedish game! <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
That's a shame for you, it's a nice game. Look up an LP.
Laaaaaaaaaaame!
<:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
Might appeal to your German fascination with leather and black metal.
And no outside, the Darkness is PS3/360.
I saw a copy of ED once! <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
The comic came first. <:GarieWink:336657101273169921>

https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51nI4cDIdoL.jpg
That's Eternal Darkness! <:ChrisAngry:336656958272700417>
Ok then outside, what about the Darkness?
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
Suckmanuts is a great game.
I bet it's not as magical as Tales of Eternia. <:ChrisSmile:336656717553074176>
Y'all:
They are the gayer couple. <:GarieWink:336657101273169921>
I got one! <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
As long as you archive the stream and get the leather hat. <:GarieWink:336657101273169921>
Ain't I a stinker?
All right, NOW I've ruined Saki's day. <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
WHERE MY KIRIKA COSPLAY DARK SOULS STREAM AT?!?

*flashbacks to Youtube in 2008*
...I should have picked a better video.
Not sure  if it's a gem, but LOOK AT IT!

Have you heard of Samurai Western?
Like damn.
*high five*
No gacha in sight. <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
Look at all this ``variety``.
The...monster wrestling one?
Shadow Hearts is so goooooood.
https://youtu.be/7DvpaKKLJjw
Ok, here's a game and a song that came to mind:
Fun.
Feels like overloaded Crash music.
That Tiny Tank music is legit, <@!193408538909868033>
Still amazed that Europe only got Xenosaga 2. <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Oh, duh.
Wait, which one is Verse?
I neeeeed to experience it.
Alongside Grandia, Trails, Tales of, Xenosaga, Granblue, Lunar...
I *will* play that.
<:MikuBliss:336657233712513024>
<:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
5th of August.
Or you could all wait until I *hopefully* get the game on my birthday! <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>

<:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
Y'all better not post a bunch of spoilers.
Oh yeah, Shining Dessonance comes out today. <:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
The RE2 demo isn't public. <:ChrisEnraged:423196924368388105>
Literally the best AI system ever.
Play FFXII. <:GarieWink:336657101273169921>
Yeah, Tales of can be a bit busy.
Oh, so that's the issue.
...and yet you played Razor's Edge, the busiest game ever. <:HibikiWhat:336656482907193344>
Would've thought we were the same person from different timelines otherwise. <:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
Good thing we have found a game to differ on. <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Even when you had to fight like 8 enemies at once?
The thing that grinded my gears was that they made one enemy for exp and one for gold, with the others being there to slow you down.
Thank.
Say that again.
The random thing was because the game rerolls turnorders.
No, i meant the combat always felt grindy, since it took so long and enemies payed out fuck-all in gold and exp.
Plot was nice, but the gameplay was the grindiest randomized garbage I've played.
It's pretty bad. <:GarieWink:336657101273169921>
8 burned me something fierce.
Nope! <:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
Shining Resonance will be JRPG #51 in my backlog. <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Hey, Star Ocean 3 finally gave me some good combat skills. <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
Thankfully, none of that crap matters, Just attack and heal.<:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
Here's hoping it's baked in on the PS4 version. <:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
The first disc of Star Ocean 3 is nearing its end.
<:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616> That Star Ocean 3 boss had a party wipe attack!
Leave it to Star Ocean 3 to start a new party member at level 1 for plot reasons! <:ChrisAngry:336656958272700417>
Reminds me of the bikini that was the reward of the extra dungeon in Rogue Galaxy.
<:KirikaGay:336657049540755457>
If only 4K assets did the same. <:ChrisAngry:336656958272700417>

*prepares to mute channel due to spoilers*
I got the triple exp bonus on a boss and the  group healing spell. <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>

<:Ver:336656981144109066>

Give it a go if you have PS+, or if it goes on sale on PC.

Have you tried Absolver? <@!193408538909868033>
It's also the closest we have to a spiritual successor to God Hand.
Very interesting if you're like me and can't deal with regular fighting games.
Absolver is on PS+ this month. <:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
Gonna be fun to compare.


I REQUIRE AN EXPLANATION, THIS SHOULD NOT BE!
A few parts of the rap got sampled in Persona 3 in this song: https://youtu.be/ZMBkLshY4pk
AND THAT'S NOT THE END OF IT!
*from Space Jam!*
It has the "Work that body, work that body" from Space Jam!
There's this song in Star Ocean 3: https://youtu.be/4CugyaQzmx8
Listen to me.
Ok.
WHAT THE FLYING FUCK ARE YOU DOING, STAR OCEAN 3!?!
Today is the day I beat you, Star Ocean 3! <:Germain:421434126856486912>
Yes, it's the worst. <:Cag:423197445644615711>
Yeah, the spiritual successors we'll get in 5 years will be the good stuff.
And then we can have burgers (something actually decent)! <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Because it makes Big Money™, and we can't let them have that.
Too bad you have two other JRPGs to play. <:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
Chrono Trigger is so fun. <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
4 had a decent combat system, less stiff than this one.
Same, but they have to have worked out some kinks in the combat system.
Which extends to the whole series, but this was the most frustrating. I'm curious about 5.

Gonna play Chrono Trigger now. <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
Fucker kept spamming attacks that made him unhittable. <:ChrisAngry:336656958272700417>
*A JRPG shouldn't push me this far on normal*
FUCK YOU GAME, I WIN!
I deal a bit more and my party members sorta help, still...
<:MariaShock:423196877354303498>
The final boss of Star Ocean 3 has 400000 health and I deal 6000 with one attack...
IT WAS SO PURE.
Ok, meme ruined.
And less creepiness.
How about waifus with more character than stats? <:GarieWink:336657101273169921>

I am suddenly reminded of the video of Pat from Super Best Friends rationalizing buying Warframe currency when it was on sale. <:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
Reason #12 why I stick to singleplayer games. <:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
Ouch.
Impressive. What stuff?
*fucking sun*
Ahh, understandable.
Too much fun streaming? <@!193408538909868033>
It's nice.
I think I'm halfway through Chrono Trigger. Man, this game just rolls by. <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
Those are the userfriendly ones. <:GarieWink:336657101273169921>
Learn to title, ya a-holes! <:MariaYell:336657352264646657>
Or rather: Dick Move Capcom: Devil May Cry <:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
I thought you meant DmC.
Ohhh, you meant the series.
And get the Definitive Edition.
It's an interesting experience, but you gotta steel yourself.
He went straight to Exceed stuff.
But his blind DMC4 run is cool.
Well, streams are long.
Stuff like this.
https://youtu.be/cJjnvX8noRU
No...that was someone else.
Probably has torch only in BB somewhere.
Does challenge runs in Souls games.
He went through DMC.
Crap, I have some LobosJr streams to watch.
Impressive.
I haven't ever given them a shot, got too many channels to watch anyway.
They're streaming for charity today. <:GarieWink:336657101273169921>
Good luck. <:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
I'm glad HellfireComms are still going strong.
The video quality wasn't there, but the heart sure was.
It really was a different time.
Are you familiar with many of *the old ones*?
He's basically unchanged. Still crude, happy and known to sing.
It was the start of a randomized OOT run.
And I'm 12 hours into Chrono Trigger and only a few dungeons away from the final boss. <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Fair point, but the doll is very underexplained.
Nevermind, sex isn't a thing in Souls-games. <:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
"Beat" <:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
Like Maria could stay in character. <:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>

Gotta get to lady Maria. <:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
Which reminds me, outside. You gotta play more nioh.
The HZD DLC is like a Souls-game DLC. You can sneak in early for good loot. <:GarieWink:336657101273169921>
Cleaned out the map and did the DLC.
I beat all I wanted in HZd.
That's cuz there are so few weapons and online mechanics that they couldn't make anything grindable. <:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
I could get it if I collect all weapons, but I see nothing of value in that effort. <:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
Are plats ever worthile?
isn't P5 streambanned still?
<:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
You suuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuure?
I don't think I'll tune in for ME, it's not for me.
To reiterate: DMC 1-3 HD, DMC4SE and DmCDE are the ones you want.
You don't *need* the extra editions, but they're nice.
Same goes for DMC4 SE, but that's only digital in the west.
And PC.
You need the HD collection.
And the original PC port of DMC3 is ass.
Well, DmC DE never came out on PC.
DmC PS4 is the special edition.
Are any of those the special editions?
A crying shame that you haven't played them yet.
Tales from the Woes of a Gacha Prisoner™ <:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
<:MariaSunglasses:336656798687690752>
Work reasons?
Like weekends? <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Depends on a multitude of factors.
I need to play that quadrilogy.
Might go for Soul Blazer next.
I've beaten Chrono Trigger. <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
Do you want me to watch or not?
Jackbox and dinner with a friend.
Oh right.
Him I can deal with. Not the sand boss as the Claw.
Who dat?
It has like 25 attacks. <:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
This boss impressed me in Seven and is hype as hell.
https://youtu.be/JUd8pOMUtbc
<@290431224596660224> So, are you interested?
*flashbacks to Dark Fact*
Not like there's any plot concerns anyway.
Ehh, 1 & 2 are demanding.
Also, shame on you Scrmz.
Felghana should be cheap.
Hype as hell and very easy to get into.
Ys is the greatest secret in gaming.
Fire?
Hmmm...
Let's hope the demo has good stuff in it.
Yay. <:HibikiEager:407398049531559937>
Then get to the demo soon-ish.
<@290431224596660224> Are you done being productive yet?
MGS5 is 3 years old. <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Crysis is 10 years old. <:GarieWink:336657101273169921>
Devil May Cry is 17 years old. <:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
"Back in my day..."
13-year-olds would argue otherwise.
Man, I feel like I have done this channel so much good today. <:ChrisSmile:336656717553074176>
She even does the befriend thing. <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
~~Seeing as Kaneko wrote it~~
And the leading lady is a bit like Hibiki! <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
There's also loads of incredible puzzles.
Very cool. Also has a system to eliminate random battles.
And as you level, your base FP increases, meaning you can cast spells instantly once you hit level 25.
But to use specials, you need to burn FP.
If you fight, you build up FP, which unlocks unlimited casts of spells.
And I really like how the skills work.
Every boss is a bit of a puzzle.
Hell, the game is a boss rush if you play it correctly.
The combat is ace!
How...silly.
It's just for looks.
Yes? So?
https://youtu.be/SHlqledKmls
But if we wanna go for hidden gems, anyone here played Koudelka?
Got 2 as a gift like 2 years ago. <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
I should play Grandia as well.
WA3 was excellent.
Right, the Kaneko coaster.
Now Tales of Eternia, that's the shit. <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
~~Those aren't special, but at least they aren't broken and janky~~
Then it's Star Ocean 5 time. <:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
I've finished Soul Blazer though and am making my way through ICO. <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
<:ChrisEnraged:423196924368388105>
>Sen 3
Then I can play 8 afterwards.
Man, Celceta comes out soon. <:HibikiEager:407398049531559937>
Just the music is hype!
<:HibikiEager:407398049531559937>
https://youtu.be/JaeHnLwr6VE
Not sure what the demo covers though.
Ok, but do give us your impressions later. <:GarieWink:336657101273169921>
https://store.steampowered.com/app/207350/Ys_Origin/
It's the most "pure" game in the series.
<:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
<@290431224596660224> Ys Origin has a free demo.
*so little damage*
All good stuff. <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Ys is light on plot, Zwei has an even mix and Trails is *heavy* on story.
Falcom has loads of games on the gameplay to story scale. <:GarieWink:336657101273169921>
Ys first.
In wordbuilding that takes two games to pay off? <:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
TitS is...meaty.
Let's ease him in, Pat.
Ohh, pride. <:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
You can bump it up when you play as the two others.
There's always easy mode. <:GarieWink:336657101273169921>
~~He's midgame, you'll be fine.~~
<@!209896097026408449> I think we have him hooked. <:MariaConfident:336657338729627658>
And look what a bit of **HIGH OCTANE JRPG ACTION** can do for ya.
Cool. Which one?
Well?
Felghana is probably cheaper though.
Origin might be a good starting point, as it has the best value to it, as you play 3 characters.
I take it you're sold. <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I don't really have a favorite, but Felghana has a rather hype final boss.
Party as in party of characters.
Lastly, the party games: Seven, Memories of Celceta and 8.
They are all pretty similar.
Origin, Felghana and Napishtim.
Then there's the 3d games.
Very old, and somewhat annoying to play.
Ys 1&2 Chronicles, on Steam.
There's 1&2, which have bump combat.
You did fine.
The most recent game is 8, but the PC port is trash. The series basically has a few subseries to it.
Ahh, lava guy. He's fun.
Ya know, ICO is handholding: The Game. <:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
Do you...play video games?
>boss getting harder as you go on
Caterpillar?
Bosses be hard.
Oh, fair enough.
Yeesh, how long is that demo?
<:Germain:421434126856486912>
**AND COPELAND MADE A NEW TRACK!**

In the meantime...
Well then, keep going and amass some impressions.
"From the statue, go south once screen. Back in this large moving platform area,
go left and notice the torch that doesn't have a flame on it. Using your Fire
magic, go ahead and light it up to have a pillar to the east rise! Go back to
the right and jump onto the moving platform, go right one, then use your Wind
magic and jump south to the new platform. From there, do the same thing except
Wind-jumping to the right to get to the side we couldn't reach before.

Now, where to go? Drop down to the ground first, fighting the enemies if you
wish, then move all the way north to find a chest containing another [_TOPAZ_]
to give your Thunder magic a boost. From there, hop on the moving platform to
the southeast, then jump on the stationary platform surrounding your current
one. There's another torch to be lit to your north, so make your way left, left,
up, and right, then light it with your Fire magic to activate one of two
platforms to the southeast."
I checked a guide, the fire magic should do it.
Huh.
No one knows who actually owns it due to rights shifting and companies being bought.
There was an HD version made, but it can't be sold.
Same for No One Lives Forever. <:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
It's a lost art, for sure.

Usually, the story of an Ys game is: Adol wakes up shipwrecked, go find a cute girl to help and slay a revived demon.
Actually, Ys Origin is one of the games with a decent amount of plot.
Trails is more: Welcome to Bose, get to know the mayor and get some fun scenes with her in the next game where the shit hits the fan.

*Oh joy*
Lemme guess: Low droprate from rare elite enemies.

Hey wait, that was a squeky hammer!
*Maybe if I prep some Shirabe art*
Well, I'm around for another hour.

I've started Star Ocean 5 and I feel like sharing Fiore's design.
A drink to death of your gaming freedom, <@292451539136806913>

*Fortnite has claimed another.*
<:MikuSad:336657015961026560>

Lol.
They're good.
I've played my share of Tri-Ace! <:ElfneinBullying:421432763078410241>
Until then, I have my new ~~MMO~~ JRPG, Star Ocean 5 to play.
Woot.
Yes, but *temptations*.
...maybe I shouldn't play it.
See ya, you shitty multiplayer game.
^Me.

<@292451539136806913> Are you still stuck in online hell?
Gimme while and I'll write reviews. <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
But hey, anime Star Trek.
Probably not a franchise for someone so not used to JRPGs.
3 + 4 are very janky.
1 +2 are fun, but lack interesting systems.
Took them a few games. <:GarieWink:336657101273169921>
I can confirm that Star Ocean 5 is actually fun. <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
...what is your sleep schedule?
Romantic in the classic sense. <:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
Suffering for friendship, how romantic. <:MikuBliss:336657233712513024>
My condolences.
...and the F-game. <:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
Imma play more Star Ocean 5. 😐
But yeah, hit me up whenever you start some Ys.
...which is like 110.
8 is like 40 though. <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
Many only like 7.
Most games are like 12 hours tops.
As far as series goes, it's not hard.
~~Not counting all the original versions that have now been remade.~~
I wants it.

Speaking of butts, have a look at Fiore from the game I'm playing.
Ass-related options? <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>

All right, today is the day I beat the bonus bosses in Star Ocean 5.
Now I've beaten the whole series. <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
Star Ocean 5.
Do we have to? <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>

BUT I BEAT THE SECOND TO LAST FIGHT! <:Germain:421434126856486912>
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Through the power of shortcake, I'm now level 206.
Time to grind! <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Welp, that ended poorly.
But hey, the game actually expects me to use the crafting systems now. <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
~~Since the fucker has an AoE that nukes most of the party.~~
Fun fact: It was made by the Deadly Premonition devs. <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Also axing the final boss. <:GarieWink:336657101273169921>
Frankly, a small rewrite and not-shit framerate would do wonders for that game.
Like he cares. <:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
Quite.
I hope.
I think it's a program.

<:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
Though I feel like I could break my PS3 controller if I sneezed at it.
At least you're not like <@292451539136806913> , who broke a controller over Dark Souls.

I got a Saki Mitama. <@!102691114762371072> <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>

Of course, if you really want to...<:Ver:336656981144109066>
It's the most horrible thing. <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Saki, you don't wanna see that ending.
To get the worst ending, of course. <:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
Which you only get if you kick the dog in the face like 12 times. <:GarieWink:336657101273169921>
Good times. Comes recommended. <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
They go: Aww, hell yeah!, crap, **AHHHHHHHH JESUS FUCK WHYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY**
*trust me*
Also, **do not kick the dog**
My blog on the game even hit the front page! <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
https://www.destructoid.com/traveller-in-playtime-haunting-ground-468599.phtml
Heh.
Also, really rapey villains. <:ElfneinBullying:421432763078410241>
It has the best doggo. <:HibikiEager:407398049531559937>

*Eyes Ken and Yosuke*
*Max rank playthrough*
Saki's unending hatred for anything hetero never stops being amusing. <:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
YE
Or at least P3P, since you can play as a lady in that one. <:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
Note to self: Get Saki into Persona when she has money for Sony consoles.
I'm between palace 1 & 2. <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
<@!102691114762371072>
Hehe, Saki would *love* Morgana.
Right, but first saving some more hearts in Kingdom Hearts. <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
PS4 successfully restolen. <@!193408538909868033>
...I need to watch more P3 movies.
Souji in P4 is kinda...
The dude is kinda nice as well.
I like her perky fanon personality.
~~Also, isn't it fun that the FeMC in P3P can basically become a pedophile?~~
*Water of Rebirth, my ass...*
<:TsubasaDisgust:349013662775902209>
<@!193408538909868033> WHY DOES THE SP DRINK HAVE PLACENTA IN IT?!?
YOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!
https://youtu.be/CJBPVwymJiA
*Daisoujou MP drain intensifies*
Well, if you manage to fuse them, then you can start cheating back. <:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
~~But he and the rest of the fiends were added in Maniacs, so they break the difficulty curve.~~
~~~Honestly, he's not that bad if you've made a decent party.~~

...friend, I'm not throwing you to the jaws of Nocturne.
Go for Digital Devil Saga 1 & 2. They're very kind, but a tad deeper than Persona sometimes.
You should play more SMT then. <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
That sounds promising.
*Shadow Kanji says hi*
Yeah, but the game is an asshole somethimes. But now I have decent wiggle room.
Acceptable trouble. Almost exactly what I wanted.
And I didn't cheat by looking up boss strategies this time! <:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
<@!193408538909868033> Second palace crushed! <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Lemme guess, he stalks mementos.
Well, I'm at palace 3.
I think I'm gonna grind and get Ann Diarama. <:Germain:421434126856486912>
Do you need to accrue a party?
How far into NG+ is it?
*hiss*
Wow, what is this casul garbage? <:MichaWhat:336657148627124225>
...and then they instakill you? <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
That sounds like having to deal with shifting immunities. <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
<:Cag:423197445644615711>
>Implying I'll even touch NG+
*It's almost like fusion is still a pain, even with all the baby features they put in.*
Got that in a tab at all times.
Got that. <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
*Oh boy, time to consider immunities*
Sure.
It's almost like I'm playing Nocturne. <:MikuBliss:336657233712513024>
And I've gotten a multihit debuff!
It's the one where you actually get money, personas and SP. <:HibikiEager:407398049531559937>
<@!193408538909868033> The third palace is so nice. I can just play the game normally!
Palace 3 beat, bacon get. <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I got double lockpicks. <:MariaConfident:336657338729627658>
I usually go for collectibles and bonus bosses if they're not stupid.
I got the one in the Sly Collection, and that was because they were nice and excluded 100% stuff from every game. <:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
Platinums are often a waste of time to me. <:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
*Looks at 40+ other JRPGs in backlog*
Just gonna stay with the guide. Ain't got time for NG+. <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
*Why did you replay it, you madman?*
And he only blocks curse. <:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
His stats are meh and getting him good skills is a pain. <:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
<:TsubasaYareYare:407397617451139073>
But he's soooooo low level.
No wait, you can't stunlock with crits in this game.
Odin time? <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
P3 and P4 really left me content, P3 moreso.
Yeah, but it does make the P3 ending pretty sweet, when they do go into friendship stuff.
Teacher boning is weird, outside.
The team in P3 is sorta professional first, friends second.
Aeon is good!
Sun. Hermit...
Let's see, I like...
He cooks!
His social link is adorable.
Especially since only FeMC can have them with party members.
Yeah, the P3 Social Links are weird.
No surprise there.
<@200927407736094721> Thoughts on P3?
Moving on!
...
I like Ann, but the spark isn't there. <:GarieWink:336657101273169921>
Hot takes first, bitching about FeMC being a pedohile later. <:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
Well, I just declined Ann. <:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
Any P3 hot takes? <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
But Options™
Easy on the spoilers though.
Oh yeah.
Why the hug?
Just to restate my position. <:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
Especially when it has more DLC than base content? <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Are the bestest? <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
You'd think they'd go the PS4/PC route.
At a glacial pace, but still.
Well, Sega have been pumping out PC stuff.
It's the Futaba chapter. After the banker. <:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
Not there yet.
Shh.
Wait for the rerelease after they've splooged enough PQ and Dancing games. <:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
...because the Vita is too new, silly.
(Except Golden.)
(You can emulate like all of them.)
You should play more SMT.
The true ending of P4 was a bit bollocks to get, but the foreshadowing was awesome.
The last month is gonna be nuts.
I played P4, I know how this goes.
Pre palace 4, by the way.
And he looks like Light. <:GarieWink:336657101273169921>
Mr Ace Detective gives me L vibes.
<@!193408538909868033> Ok, P5 is inching ever closer to Death Note. <:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
My Personas are growing stronger.
YOU CAN WATCH THE YAKUZA MOVIE WITH MAKOTO!

<:ShirabeEmbarassed:336657288477671436>
>I've gotten a lot easier?

Still waiting on SMT If. <:HibikiEager:407398049531559937>
Takes time, yo. <:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
I did. Last update was a year ago, but it's not cancelled.
Welp, seems like I should wait for the fantranslation of P2 EP. <:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
Is the English version of part 2 ass?
I patched part 1, but later got the PSP version.
*Too bad the fuckers didn't localize the other one*
It was fine.
I just played the PSP version.
Are you talking about innocent Sin?
...not this crap again. Tales of Phantasia was annoying enough.
I've yet to play P2 2.
Oh.
I don't get it.
I like Genko.
P2 the first had some good characters. <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
Cool, but with shit combat?
The series didn't start with 3.
So, any love for P1 or P2?
Gets you savestates. <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
You know, Doxe. You can just emulate it.
I'm leaning towards Makoto. <:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
And P3P. <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I got FES. <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
<@!193408538909868033>
Palace 4 down! <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>


Are these guys Gold & Silver from God Hand?
Wait...
...they did the gays on the beach schtick in P5 as well.
~~Also because they didn't want to give you the option for multiple reasons.~~
Because bisexual protags are hard to code, silly. <:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
The east will probably catch up.
Well, the west is making dad games.
This is an otaku game for babies. <:GarieWink:336657101273169921>
Then those folks get to play Eternal Punishment. <:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
*When
...fucking hell, Japan.
Heard that earlier.
Also, methinks this Shogi player escaped from the Yu-Gi-Oh universe. <@!193408538909868033>
Geah total conversion mod when? <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Daisojou?
I'm more for the bare-chested punchdowns. <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Fair warning, Yakuza really boosts your testosterone levels. <:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
Stay tuned, as Saki endures gentleminded hyper machismo awesomeness for the sake of her beloved Mahjong. <:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
*Oh no*
Das a good deal for a lot of Yakuzies. <:ShirabeEmbarassed:336657288477671436>
https://store.steampowered.com/app/638970/Yakuza_0/
Anyways.
What casul garbage. <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
So? They weren't even multi-hit. <:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
Where my instakills at?
I even used Tetraja, just in case.
None.
Dammit, WFC.
<@!193408538909868033>
I've finally met a hard boss in Persona 5. It was the Mementos boss that spams brainwash. <@!193408538909868033>
Palace 5 go! <:Germain:421434126856486912>
<@193408538909868033>
*Will this be the game that frees your multiplayer-ridden soul?*
Oh, cool.
In other news, I got the Ys game I was lacking yesterday. <:KirikaGay:336657049540755457>
Not comparable.

*No Kazuma Kiryu in Tekken*
Also, hi.
Doubtful.
All right, what timeline is this?!<:MariaYell:336657352264646657>
https://youtu.be/Sy3BHkOA6eM
The appeal of them?
Which is what brought me here. <:HibikiEager:407398049531559937>
I love shouty emotional scenes.
Potential cinnamon roll, needs more big shouty scenes and/or social link.
Anyway, Palace 5 boss time! <:Germain:421434126856486912>
Huh.
<@!193408538909868033> I feel bad over using Kawakami for coffee and curry.
https://youtu.be/iT1l8Dcjb1Y
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
You evil, awesome game.
Ahh, Nocturne.
Gonna go for the first games one of these days.
I'm kinda lacking in the SMT department, but so many games are on 3DS.
And all the side games, but i don't care about those.
Last third of P5 and EP left for me.
Can't blame ya. Use the Wikidot guide to lessen the pain.
*remake the games with better combat, you cowards*
Tetsuya is nice, but Maya is ace.
The popular ones.
Post P2 games.
P1 dude is just a paper figure.
I like all three in the "reboot" games.
*fite me*
Nah, Minako is.
*Stop making me reconsider my love of P3 dammit*
Sure.
Oh, her.
Is Natsuki Moon or the chairman?
Fair point, but rather...surface-level complaint.
Oh.
Wait, really?
Could you elaborate on the Makoto & Mitsuru comparison?
They nixed EP.
No, IS did.
Still waiting for the fantranslation of P2 EP PSP.
Cool.
It has funky music. <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
PSP.
Still got EP to play.
Yes.
5th. <:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
I like her. <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Ok?
??
?
Heart attacks. <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I say this again, Persona 5 is just Death Note. <:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
Star Wars dungeon. <:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
Palace 5 beaten! <:Germain:421434126856486912>
<:ElfneinBullying:421432763078410241>
No, I mean normal ones that level on every visit.
Sun and Moon seem to be free.
~~Or just axed the time management alltogether.~~
...would be nice if the fuckers said which arcana are automatic.
#Priorities
<:GarieWink:336657101273169921>

I'm at the 15th of December.
Oh, eh I can't be arsed to reload.
...but I couldn't beat the batting cage for the last book. <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
All P5 retro games beaten.
He escaped my wrath in P4! <:Germain:421434126856486912>
Gonna stomp the Reaper though. <:GarieWink:336657101273169921>
Obviously. <:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
Looking over the trophy list, I think I'll leave it there.
<:Germain:421434126856486912> <:HibikiEager:407398049531559937> <:MariaYell:336657352264646657>
<@!193408538909868033> All optional Confidants maxed!
I'll just tell you how it works. You have your standard ending choices. But if you clear ALL of the bonus dungeon, you can overwrite them with the True Demon path.
And the meanest dungeon ever made by Atlus. <:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
That path has like 8 extra bosses.
Also also also, go for the true demon ending. Don't be a wimp and pick another one.
There is a teacher though, outside. <:GarieWink:336657101273169921>
Male protag, no romance, hard as balls, no auto save...
Yeah, not a Saki game.
Also also, rotate saves like a madman.
Also, beware of horses.
That, and Magatama (and by extension what build you want) is the advice I really wanna leave you with.
If you keep it or it's "descendants" (evolutions/fusion result) without ever using it as a sacrifice, you get a cool reward lategame.
You get a Pixie as your first demon.
It's not vital, and takes *forever* to pay off.
Hmm. There is one other piece of advice I wanna give.
Oh cool. Keep me updated on progress and stuff.

They're the one thing you can really screw up.
If I can just suggest one thing, it's to look up how Magatama operate.
There isn't much different from P5, but some things are vital.
I can teach you the things particular to that battle system, if you want.
Yes, "fun".
Stream? <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
You gonna do it soon?
Emulate it or get it on PS3. <:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>

It'd be like Nocturne! <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I mean, I'm glad it's not a puzzle at this size.
Third one.
Yes.
A puzzle would need more failure states.
You can either proceed or not.
But it's not a puzzle.
The enemies are cake.
Why would NG+ make it better?
Especially since so many floors are nearly identical.
<@!193408538909868033> This boat is big.
Welp, might as well try Memories of Celceta.
The PS4 got stolen back.
But Nocturne metagaming gives me life. <:Germain:421434126856486912>
No worries.
Ya got me all excited. <:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
Is the damn thing downloaded yet? <:MariaYell:336657352264646657>
Getting early buffs is so good. <:HibikiEager:407398049531559937>
I went buffs and transitioned into strength. Went awesomely. <:Ver:336656981144109066>
Say, what build do you fancy? Strength, magic, buffs?
You'll see.
Takes some grinding though. <:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
Gets you cheap demons to summon at the start. <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
But doing true demon for a 100% compendium into NG+ is nice. <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
It's a point scale thing.
Ehh, I think getting endings depends on choices made at key points.
Reminder that I have yet to play it. <:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
Learn to love fusing Persona.
Be strong.
Put on a podcast. <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
And it's always an upgrade.
Just a few.
Kewl.
Also, they must be stacked 4 times for the full effect.
They last forever, until countered.
It gets better once buffing comes into play.
Still takes forever.
That's how I did it.

I'm almost done with P5. <:MariaConfident:336657338729627658>
Eyy, almost done on my end.
<:ElfneinBullying:421432763078410241>
Ok, better make some coding progress in the meantime.
<@!193408538909868033> Is a Nocturne stream in the works?
Ys Memories of Celceta is like Ys Seven but more!
https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/bjbped/nintendos-offensive-tragic-and-totally-legal-erasure-of-rom-sites?utm_source=reddit.com
K.
We shall see.
Might be dinner time then though.
Same time zone. <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
ETA on the stream? <@!193408538909868033>
Seems stable!

I should actually watch this show.

Forget that. It's:

I should get a 3DS for that and Soul Hackers.
Kewl
Like a spear?
A 2-hand build maybe?
Criticals only work on so many enemies.
Archery sorta sucks.
Miracles are mostly lame.
Magic is either OP or a slog.
Not many builds on offer.
Well, then you're kinda outta luck, since it's DS1.
It's fun, I swear.

In other news, Death's Gambit is out. <:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
<@188714906143424513> She's an ok lass! <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Except the last half of the game. <:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
Quality is a good choice in BB.
Fitting punishment for a weeb in a victorian setting. <:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
...and drains your health.
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
>BLT
I bet you leveled stamina like a moron. <:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
Which makes a big difference. <:GarieWink:336657101273169921>
More like: Have a better chance of surviving a boss combo. <:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
Health is the shit in BB.
Noob mistake. <:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
Did you get 50 VIT?
Read as much as you care to and tell me what you think.

Have a gander.
Now then, outside.
She misspelled it.
Say....you like BB.
*Bitch, I'm basically a salt elemental when the time is right.*

Never met one.
They're these weird "Nintendo people".
I hear people do.
<:HibikiEager:407398049531559937>
Playing final mixes after all this time was so nice.
So the PS3 versions are better to keep.
The PS4 ones have 60 FPS and a few extra goodies, but you need the patch for it to work.
I have the PS3 versions.
But I have 2.5, so the PSP version is useless to me now.
Kewl.
Pretty sure the PSP emulator is literal magic. <:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
And failing that? <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Your call.
It's nice, but not THAT nice.
Those exist. <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Heh.
I love how FeMC is interpreted in fanon.
Das a lot of Macca.
Also, ouch.
Got 6 of the fuckers to play now.
I managed to snag some Tales of compilation discs for surprisingly cheap. <:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
Is P4 still EVERYWHERE?
Anyway, I heard it got pricey.
Limey store, I take it.
Amazon?
Buy where?
Then we can all just consider the Vita useless. <:GarieWink:336657101273169921>
Hell, give me a P4G PS4 version as well. <:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
No The Answer though. <:ShirabePout:336656831978012712>
*Seducing Shinji*
P4 gameplay, new music, social links with party members....
It's good! <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>

Cuz I want that.
You mean a combination of P3P and FES?
Where mah Shadow Hearts remasters at? <:Germain:421434126856486912>
Game archival is shit. <:ShirabePout:336656831978012712>
Now a proper PS4 version...<:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
I think.
Well, it got a bit upscaled for the PSN version. <:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
And I can't get it working well with an emulator. <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
It's the greatest game of all time, you know? <:GarieWink:336657101273169921>
Ye.
*the horror*
*oh noes*
GOD HAND MUST ENDURE! <:Germain:421434126856486912>
I do have 2 backup PS2s though. <:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
*I should get a slim as backup*
...but man, DS3 controllers feel so brittle after using a DS4.
Mine is going strong, save for the inability to charge controllers. <:MariaConfident:336657338729627658>
RIP DeS.
Aww.
I mean, if he played the PS3 version, it's mostly an upgrade. <:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
GaintDad memes give me life.
Basscannon?  <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Why is that an oof?
<:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
I meant like the MGS2 rerelease, or the DMC3 one.
BACK IN MY DAY, DLC CAME ON DISC IN THE RERELEASE!
BECOME A HOMEOWN...wait no, that's stupidly hard in this economy.
BUY A CANE
EMBRACE IT
GOOD
Hey, that's like 15 DLC packs! <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Kewl.
*in
Isn't she on HZD?
Sounds like a self-righteous writer. <:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
Who is he again?
Maybe it'll become official? <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
<:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
Neverending Nightmares is kinda based around the author's anxiety problems. Or maybe it was OCD. <@256945399338631168>
Yay? <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
