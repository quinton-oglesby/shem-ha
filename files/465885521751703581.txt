hello
Ultimately if people just learned to shrug slurs off, they lose power and become meaningless
Muh intonation
It comes off as snippy
You know sarcasm doesn't translate well in text
I think it's pretty dumb to be offended by a word, but this is all  just opinions anyway
That's a stretch, and really only if you're looking to be offended
Not really
Did anyone even tell them not to be offended?
So whatever I guess
Well apparently I'm being insincere, despite expressing my honest opinion
All of it is just absurd
Insults are slurs according to this though
ðŸ¤”
K
So insults are slurs
Someone explain how trap is a slur
Yeah
That's incredibly restrictive to speech
It's absurd to call something a slur because it's used negatively against groups
That's a slur right
I was called a geek in very derogatory ways in high school
What about the G word
That's insane
How is trap a slur what
How is tranny a slur
Can't you just say these things in text
What's the T slur
Don't let words have power over you <:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
