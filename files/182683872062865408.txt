what if it's ibu
why tho lol
wot
just for the sake of being able to tell who's in the game more easily
is there anyway to separate spectators from the ppl playing in the side bar?
aye
üá´
so we're doing the whole game in discord chat right?
yo
welp
rakhi, whoops
ibu
yea
i'm ready
resist the temptation saki
how many ppl are playing total this time? 
i can't count
mod abuse <:MariaYell:336657352264646657>
rude
dicaido
dicaido
yea
shall we vote then?
sounds like something the mafia would say
would *you*?
ü§î
saying "not me" seems a bit suspicious no?
nay
sagouzo is also pointing fingers fairly quickly
rakhi was also the one jumping the gun on lynching last round so that might play a role?
i dont think shirabe has an anti matter rifle
does the weapon of choice give us a clue abt who the killer was
unfortunate
oof
**SAKI NO**
SAKI NO
fair enough
what are the odds of me being mafia again
sagouzo
yeah
is there a doctor role now?
yo
sweet jesus
no lynch
yea
no lynch then?
for now
i have no reason to think scrmz is lying
no one else is coming up saying they're also doctor so
revenge?
unless ppl are allowed to state what role they got
no lynch
who's the most suspicious person
agreed
also seems like there's no cops this round unless someone hasn't said anything
lily hasn't said much the past round
has everyone said anything
but for now you can't die
would scrmz be basically invincible since he can always patch himself up
that is true
so uh any clues?
feelsbad
what are the votes so far then
homura
yea i guess
nay

satania/angelking
o right i choose someone to kill or no?
hello again, not R
uh shirabe i guess?
hmmmmmmmmmmmmm
it's whoever w/ the townie role?
alright i got it
i've played town of salem before like once, but a quick rundown would be nice
oh god
but it's also understandable if ppl don't wanna download them
base, vanilla discord doesn't have any of the good stuff, so plug-ins are rlly the best way to know that kind of info imo
there are plug-ins you can download that do that
I agree w ten, the majority of fancontent is wirtten stuff and fanart can just easily be put into sfw
`i knew you had a secret agenda`
lmao
also i prefer we not change the icon too much cause i get confused very easily
what happened to axz
and she did follow rules of wanting to bring it up w/ a different mod but you decided that you had the ultimate authority and kicked her
and a reason why you're not
you expect her to just pull her bots from the server after working on them for hours as a gift to the server and then basically brush off all that effort because you decided to unreasonably kick her which resulted in her removing her bots
ok but having the incomplete code and the idea just sitting there doesn't do anything compared to kriisa actually putting in her own time and effort to implement all those features into her own bots
and kriisa is the only reason those features were ever added to the server bc she's the one who did the actual work to code it all
so she technically isn't the two bots mushed together bc she never rlly had any of those features implemented
i don't remember ryoko bot ever sourcing images ü§î
but will ryoko have kiri's best feature, trivia
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158> ~~remove this one Kappa~~
ty
thanks
ah, ty latooni
after
i'll poke around the channels
okie
aww
anything i miss?
hello i have returned
That's weird cause I rejoined using the subreddit link
<#336310266654490624>
at least put it in the right channel you dingus
oh, we already know each other, scrmz
yes, considering youve said no to joining like the dozen times ive asked you to before lmao
you fucking madman you actually did it
hey there <:HibikiHi:336657249827028993>
<:Ver:336656981144109066> is obviously the most superior one

nice work!
oh hey i saw you post that on tumblr earlier

nvm found it
anyone have art of maria wearing that suit in the official birthday art stuff?
gotta agree w/ latooni on this one
every single variation of airgetlam has been p ugly (aside from a few xdu ones)
p sure it's a slur
uh might not wanna use the word "lesbo"
üëç
https://www.pixiv.net/member_illust.php?mode=medium&illust_id=39646878
oh right, sorry
from wikipedia
```
The labrys lesbian pride flag, created in 1999,[21] involves a labrys superimposed on an inverted black triangle, set against a violet hue background. The labrys was used as an ancient religious symbol[22] and for other various purposes.[23] It was adopted as a symbol of empowerment by the lesbian feminist community in the 1970s.[24][25][26]

Women considered asocial by the Third Reich because they did not conform to the Nazi ideal of a woman, which included homosexual females, were condemned to concentration camps and wore the black badge to identify them.[27][28] Some lesbians reclaimed this symbol as gay men reclaimed the pink triangle, and many lesbians also reclaimed the pink triangle although lesbians were not included in Paragraph 175 of the German criminal code```
lmao
at least this lesbian flag is cool

the trans and bi flag are personally my favorites
me neither tbh
nice to meet you also lesbian
well this is embarassing lol
i can't fucking read
wait
~~my gaydar is broken~~
wait i'm a fucking idiot this whole time i thought you were a guy, outside
surprise!
im a huge fucking lesbian yes
at least to me
but it's honestly awkward hearing it from someone who isn't a lesbian
"lesbean" is safe
unless you *really* know the gay person well and they're ok w/ it, just don't
lesbians is the correct term, it's not that hard to just use that word
you just said lesbos when we stated that it was a slur
~~isn't it basically an unspoken rule that straight ppl can't make jokes abt gay ppl cause it always comes off as homophobic~~
got called that quite a bit back in middle school lol
yeah it's coming back to me, it is
thanks
now i can't tell if he's trolling
i'll admit i get a bit too defensive when it comes to those kinds of topics
more like saki telling you what's appropriate to say given your sexual orientation otherwise you come off as homophobic
^^^
this got very sidetracked


tf is that file name

kirika's is the weirdest one cause she's also got that poofy sleeve that stops halfway down her arms
tsubasa's and chris' are rlly nice
i wouldn't mind wearing them irl
ty
and it's not even an off-model pic either wtf

i fucked up, there's slightly higher res ones gimme a sec
not a big fan of this one, but i love the background
sorry for the spam, but here's individual splash art for each one
that one's also my fave
outside w/ the excellent taste
^^^
my gay ass can only handle so much
league needs to stop making such nice ass skins


all good
honestly not one of the 1st things i wanna be reading when i log into discord
can ya'll take this to <#336297808221044736>
that sure is..... something
i can never figure it out
what even is that au?
finally someone has the right idea
she's too powerful
you can't stop the chicken
yeah that was worded poorly mb
was legit just curious abt statistics, but obviously i wouldn't ask anyone cause of privacy and all that
sorry
that was not my intention
shit did i say something bad
~~now i'm curious abt the ratio of trans/nb/non-cis/etc to cis women on here~~
concept art looks way better than the actual xdu art

It's a hella cute pic
http://visqi.tumblr.com/post/180803016999
shirabebot adding the source is just an extra bonus
nah you can post whatever art you want to share w/ everyone
the front facing one looks disproportional in a lot of places
agree w/ the christmas one

do they at least taste good

jesus christ lmao
slightly disappointed the screen doesn't say dess
LMAO
R getting rdy to murder one of saki's bot children
put her down before it's too late
i even disappeared for about 2 months w/out saying anything and no one bothered to even send me a simple "how are you" so ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
yeah i've been fed up w/ their shit and have slowly started cutting off contact from them the past few months
no one even bothers taking my side because im the only person of color in the group and they're all white and just back each other up
i've repeatedly told them that their jokes are offensive and they always pull that reverse racism BS on me
^^
gotta love it when your own friends are intentionally racist towards you, but when i call them out on it they call me racist instead
yeah, i've told them several times in the past to stop w/ the racist jokes but no one bothers listening to me
of them to joke abt it i mean
that's so fucking dumb.....
i wanted to have faith that they'd stop being such dicks cause i've known a lot of them for several yrs but i've been barely talking/interacting w/ them this past yr so that just made it easier for me to leave
kind of both; im close w/ a few ppl but most of them i don't talk to too much
it's happened before and it happened just now
that was the last fucking straw for me
not friends anymore; i just left the server and im cutting off all contact w/ most of them now
they're all racist assholes who like to instigate shit for no other reason except to just bully me
i legit can't even say one fucking thing in my friend group's discord w/out someone asking me how to cook a dog (for context i'm chinese and everyone knows)
i just finished unfriending and leaving every single mutual server i'm in w/ them
that's such a huge weight off my shoulders now
isn't that basically just victim blaming
i'd suggest just disabling anon entirely for a while but ik there are actually nice ppl who are shy and use it
also sorry you have to deal w/ these assholes DL
i thought blocking ppl on tumblr also blocked the ip address
even though she's already in a *very serious, long term relationship*
it gets even worse cause the idiot doesn't even understand and respect my best friends' boundaries and will try to constantly flirt with her
LOL
it rlly is and im so glad i barely talk to him anymore
but he acts like a goddamn entitled child almost all the time
he's like 23-24
it is
tfw one of my friends basically hates me now bc he's jealous of my relationship w/ my best friend, who he has a crush on
And only abt 5 of us exist
Too bad the symphogear one is practically nonexistent cause we're all so scattered
Seems shallow
I'd rather not use my art as like the sole reason ppl would even bother talking to me
And the fact that my personality is more boring than a piece of white bread
A little hard to do when my social anxiety prevents me from even opening my mouth
I wish I knew how to talk to ppl
In the 4 god damn years I've been at college I hadn't made a single fucking friend (except this one creepy guy who kinda stalked me but that's another story)
You ever just realize how sad pathetic and lonely your life is
thanks, but i should be fine and i don't wanna bother you
hair is so hard to draw
oh god why would you do that to yourself
idk maybe i should go back to the basics and focus on working on a specific thing i want to improve
i also kinda have to force myself to get at least something down otherwise i get super rusty and my art style almost completely changes
what's killing me is that i have so many ideas and stuff i wanna draw but everytime i open my program i just end up staring at a blank canvas for 15 mins before i just end up closing it
been feeling like shit the past couple of weeks and idk why
can't tell if i'm depressed, unmotivated, or too lazy to do any art
everything just feels like a mess now and idk what the fuck to do anymore
but idk what the hell happened and why
and i *was* getting better
i actually have been for the past few months after i moved back in w/ my parents
i think in the back of my mind i know im gonna end up killing myself sooner or later so why bother
well i should prob get a job but im too much of a depressed piece of shit to even look for one
how the hell do ppl occupy themselves when you have no friends
you're not missing much the skirts are usually ugly af lmao
~~this is like watching some kind of anti-vaxxer agrument~~
Can we not
Just take it to dms if it's that pressing of a matter
<@!99158582326497280>  LOL
1. octavia is bae
2. totally thought you were one of my friends who always trolls me so i'll spare you insides
