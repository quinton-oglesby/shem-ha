i like the placement for that controller <:KanadeLewd:690470896174891008>
ima try
(thankgod)
nsfw allowed
3_skip yeah i dont think i can get aoi with words xD ima need to use a refrence image
kanades mum
its great at anime
im using a model called "anything diffusion"
https://tinybots.net/artbot
3_skip im massively failing at getting aoi tomosato <:GenjuroLaugh:689563633516150872>
im using a site where you can do this for free
3_skip kirika attempts with ai
and well combine em
then make a seperate generation that has no character
probably easier if you dont include background details in the prompt first
uh there is a site to get characters from the foreground https://www.remove.bg/upload
3_skip  closest "miku" i got <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
3_skip
704x704 with 30 steps is the max for me
ah
i dont know why thats a thing but it is
like 640 704 etc
oh yeah also resolution has to be at 64 intervals
i dont have much experience on trying that stuff
you can "upscale" the images tho
yeah its limited on that site xD
similar ones
it makes multiple characters
there is this fun thing that happens at wide aspect ratios
all it does is make you wait longer
it doesnt add anything or stops improving quickly
oh you dont need higher step counts really
not always
yeah some spaces sometimes are a little wonky
also that sampler lets you generate things "faster" at lower step counts
it does really well at those kinds of resolutions
3_skip
ok ill just give you one of my examples  xD
well that depends on what you want to do with it
oh lmao forgot about my nickname
whats 2d marriage
or at most some swimsuit drawing or a screenshot from the show
or the exact kind i want
theres so many characters from shows that get like nothing
thats one of my first thoughts about ai art too 4 months ago :kek:
but if i put those 2 features and hatsune miku into negative promp (wich basicly removes stuff) i get this chick 3_skip
im gettign green hair and twin tails too with miku <:HibikiScreech:633468460030230548>
it feels wrong and immoral to not use them
im just permantely crippled with the inability to remove cat ears 😔

*Almost* never? 👀 pog
ive gotten used to far worse imperfections with ai art over the months <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
i dont think i can relate cuz i think they look mostly fine but 👍
probably the catgirl part doing that with her eyes
symphogear and ai 🤷‍♂️
3_skip custom symphogrils uwu
3_skip
with enought steps all samplers mostly end up converging on the same ish image but some are just faster and more efficient
you trying different samplers?
i wonder if i can somehow pull off maria with that hair
i have no idea
🤷‍♂️ check the image resolution of the output
atleast thats what i did
usually the best way to understand things is copying something exactly and changing things a little
write anything till it hits 150
https://beta.openai.com/tokenizer this can give you some idea
token isnt exactly a word or a letter im not sure how to explain it
anything diffusion 150
most  other models 75 "tokens"
3_skip
dont add anything else
just write "girl"
to get no background
"girl city background"
ok lets pretend the prompt is like this
youll get used to it
comes with the thing 🤷‍♂️
ok doesnt work 100% of the time but nothing works 100% of the time with these image ais
ez
simply dont add background details
3_skip

The word anime shares 2 of the same letters as "ai" its always been amogus
mass manufactured waifu
they dont look all exactly the same so i went with sisters xD
3_skip. My beautiful.. uh angelic cyborg... catgirl sisters called "Ui". yes thats what i will call these girls
ima try figure out a oc later
3_skip
i have to specify the colors and clothing etc to get a resemblance. so not a perfect model and none of them are. its all just a early demo proof of concept still but improving over time
3_skip this what i get when i just specify the show title and kirikas name <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
yeah been playing around with it every day since stablediffusion released in august
3_skip

ah yeah that demon one
xD
same with the halo and cat ears
cuz i think it looks cuter that way 👉 👈
more like a somewhat close resemblance its not quite that good at making the exact one yet
well yeah like an alt version of it
i just put symphogear, kirika and just describing her look and clothes
used ai for it

Salutations
the gungnir clap 👏
I dont understand a word youre saying!
i wish there was a  John Wayne Vercingetorix symphogear transformation
lol

holdup theres an intro?
Blame the moon
Climate change is a Custodian conspiracy
honestly gave me a great first impressions of the show (the first 6 minutes of Gx episode 1) too
worth it
it took me 8 episodes till i noticed
is there anyone else who accidently started watching symphogear from the 3rd season without realising it
wtf is changing
oh my
and Hibikis gungnir
hibikis left arm
Does this count as a dr ver reference
hmm any John Wayne Vercingetorix references this season possibly?
your name sounds like a symphogear villain <:Ver:336656981144109066>
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
Sao was always better than symphogear
Its because im not holding any weapons, that i can high five like this!
oh nvm a better one
SYMPHIGH FIVE
Then i will come back alive, even if it kills me!
Shirabe 500000000x cooter

Purge me of my sin
Its my fault

Mikus shiet badass too
Oh

That reminds me after the chateu got destroyed the buildings came back but not the people

It'll collapse by episode 14 at the earliest.

FORESHADOWING
*prays for like 5 golden weeks*
yeah the series wont last till halloween
spooky gear
😮 Serena skeleton
a bit tricky to do a fusion dance with a dead corpse
is  hibiki legal in XV 🤔
flashback?
looks like an emote ^
i cant tell
probably a kiri and shirabe duel? or an enemy 🤔
damnit
same color 🤔
new gear user? a skirt? or just a ribbon? 🤔 🤔 🤔 🤔 🤔 🤔 🤔 🤔 🤔 🤔
but look awesome doing it
probably gonna git rekt
the look on her face
o
that picture also shaky
the one where hibiki and maria are doing that double drill
huh the first episode gallery
thats neat
it shakes
Lol if you g to that T.co link and hover over Kirikas picture
but just a jpeg
too bad it wasnt a gif
to fit in more dr ver fanservice duh
why not
*sits down but with screen shake*
so they could slice of life intensly
i want all of the calm music to be ignited arrangement
what a B track
🍖  🍲
WHERE
he wont tell me
<:GenjuurouThumbsUp:336657189475188740> how extra manly will Genjuurou become if he used Carols gear 🤔
i use it whenever i ask a silly question
so shirabe
i see some purple in that profile pic
Shirabe! outside
🤔 why tho
wich symphogear user is your favorite outside?
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
so it makes sense
first episodes are as epic as season finales in other anime
you are suppose to start from the last episode
no i mean why would you watch the first episode of xv at all
wtf why would you watch that
and just cry as you eat it infront of them
trip and fall with pasta coming out of your pocket

is the episode out?
wut happenin
tbh the end bit of the opening with the scorpion was for some reason my favorite part of it
i thought you guys were Exaggerating
oh wow yeah that tranformation
If there wasnt a jam more peoplr could have made it there to get turned into jam
Good job vampire girl
Daaaaaaaamn that was a massacre
<:TsubasaYareYare:407397617451139073>
Toof
The version with the fbi for that transformation
Noice
Scam
Teens who want to die : win win
So because the concert got interupted will there be another one tommorrow? Cmon i paid for this ticket 😒 😒 😒 😒
Tbh i liked seeing those people cut up and not just turned to dust
Yes
A 3rd exit
Vampire girl is a hero. She lowered the whole thing for people to get out faster
Y not
I aint no architect i dont know
Wuts wrong with it?
Spoilers
Let the bodies hit the floor
😂 👌
Tsubasas concer was very *noisy*
who else would be this close to tsubasa other than the SONG members
in the opening it is suggested those 3 are watching the geah users very closely
or it looks like it
he transforms into a magical vampire girl
what if
he was animated quite a bit for a background character 🤔
i bet this guy has something to do with the whole massacre
episode 9 by then
maybe she will fist the vampire girl the same way 🤔
nah she gonna fight like hibiki now
hopefully she gonna start killing people too
o
wait what did that eye thing do
<:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
?
i hate the vampire girl
kinda tried
Level 43??!
just gotta storm it
i bet you can find a good fanfic in Area 51
YAY
Yo is that a secret geah user
when will we get a untransformation
there should be a dramatic transformation sequence for <:GenjuurouThumbsUp:336657189475188740>
she gon be a heckin gear user
long distance hd shiradess



she thiccer than her head
just very short and random scene for no reason
him just putting sandals on
Hibiki cant break bedrock
I hope steve from minecraft is the main villlain
ill just go find some shiny rock and stab it into myself
i wish
makes as much sense as murder being acceptable cuz you can do that in gta
btw what is mana
nothing wrong with it
kirika transformation is too pure
i would beat that little shit for frowning too
i wouldnt blame fudo
Inside
maybe episode 9
according to the release of tsubasas thing
<:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227> what is this emote lol
drop the bass
Dess
lets make som moar heat! Symphogear sucks! *dabby dab*
<:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
<:TsubasaYareYare:407397617451139073>
yeah but the difference is that i dont remember it
is Genjuurou actually Shirabe but in a costume? i dont remember them in the same room
is there any proof in symphogear that the moon  is flat
i bet she staged the whole thing
why was tsubasa staring at those red circlies for that long at the start
but *can* he
? since when do moral stuff need greenlighting in anime
whats this "greenlight" stuff about
<:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
not yet
bikki probably loaded
as he should
a great boxing match
The worst vs THE worst 🤔
oh
topdad? wut that mean
Akira Tachibana vs Fudo Kazanari final battle 👏
a wholesome concert i mean instead of maria
Fudo kazanari and tsubasa concert? 🤔
2 best songs ever on it imo
i thought the sad happened in G
liek wut
people dislike Gx?
i still want a Genjuurou putting on sandals transformation with epic music in the background but its not actually anything dramatic
<:MariaSunglasses:336656798687690752>
efficient way to get rid of the most degenerate type of group in symphogear (tsubasa fans)
what a nice thank you
oh millarc
who that
none of you cared from the first season? <:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
wdym suddenly
nobody talks about the amount of noise that died in the concert
why are those 2 trash characters in "heaven" ew
10 episodes to go still
they can barbeque
hey villains have lives too
her dess pointed at the moon near the end 🤔
Kirichan was heccin smart
its called being an anime protagonist <@216181207874928640>

they care about their families
they not villains
<:TsubasaDisgust:349013662775902209>

what shirabe did to those banane noise
thomas the tank engine geah transformation confirmed
would there be 2
what if you cut it in half
^^^^^^^^^^
well
damn
and what do you do for japan HUH?!
yeah!
he would never
he is kind

how dare you assume anything is fudos fault
i cant sing 😦
meanwhile i pull a few hairs just taking my headphones off
the hair doesnt get awkwardly stuck in places
the technology so good
oh wait no i think i hear some
the big bells
i wonder if carols song would be better with some bells 🤔
<:CarolYandere:424047704826707980> 🔪 💔
yeah dunno
senkin durdabal ignited arrangement would destroy the world
i wish there was the version carols song from the episode
wellduh
sure :p
sure
oof
-people not getting jokes on the internet imagine that
what about OVAS
ITS OUT... is it?
i am about 12% of the total deathtoll in tsubasas concert old
12 minutes? episodes? years?
12 what?
owo
nvm its in the chat
OH I SEE KANADE
<:TsubasaSmug:585839805737467920>
you cant just tell people on the internet not to do something
if we do waht u gon do abot it
*4*
maybe not that much of an upgrade
it was the maximum attack form i think
that duo song
DEM BOOB MISSILES ARE TRUE
badass granpa go!
i knew fudo is freaking ripped under those robes
the battle in the op is just ep 4
they aint an octopus
geez
oh that ghost only has so many hands they can hold ok?
naked adam getting a piggy back ride with one of the gear users and hear him sing
they were important enought to appear right before hibiki went gold at the end of AXZ
hail fudou

her body says yes
she wants to see
yeah today
when it exists outside of the studio
ye
people saying fire force has best action today K
late meme :V
a anituber touched symphogear with a 10 foot pole? WHAT?
if only carol did more than say it <:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
even his clothes are too ripped to burn
also fudou is fire proof
full immersion
just get a friend irl who shoots you exactly where chris shoots you
i cant wait for a full body vr game where we can be shot, punched and stabbed by the main 3
and when tsubasa did
when hibiki first transformed
oh there was an outside view in season 1 episode 1
i wonder what other uses could this magical ground that appears in transformation have
hmm
what did she even stab
she stabbed the ground with her scythe
when kirika was transforming in mid air
i got a question
wich resulted them sleeping in some car
and it was their home
they made the noise carbonize humans only because Genjuurou would make the symphogears irrelevant
what the hell did i just see
i wonder what all the characters who got killed in episode 1 concert would have looked like right now
just like chuck norris
no his hair is too manly to be affected
o
the secret
those action movies
what was the name of the one singing with hibiki
that stuff took way longer to do
there were lots of people who expected it from what i saw xD
yeah but noone could animate it like its in muratas manga
ofc its not gonna look like the manga
what one punch man fans dont think about ^
will the armory channel be relevant again
since there might be lots of basa this season
all the cursed memes will never dissapear
will this channel get yeeted after episode 13
hibiki dropped her on the ground one time so there is motive
possible secret final villain in this season?
how heavy is that oneesan with all those rockets
nobody gets anime
if noone is allowed to get any experience in animating over time then what happens if all the god tiers die of old age
im sure that nagai guy gets better over time and many others who arent up there with who everyone expects to animate all the anime
so simple but so metal
the last 8 seconds with the scorpion is my favorite for some reason
ye
animation atleast
the first one is done at this point right? <:HibikiWhat:336656482907193344>
what are the chances of a 2nd opening for this season
....
Would that mean basa is a custard too
10th titan
<:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
is vanessa in a gear?
hibiki gonna be busy listening to some sicc beats
and it looks like theres more <:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
is that vanessa getting the big shock
🤔
i think thats all he did in that episode
i bet he hired the guy who shrugged at tsubasa in the 2nd episode
wait is there a episode without tsubasa
especially ones with any tsubasa in them
he scribbles on tsubasas desk in school
cuz hes not a pussy whos scared of zombies and creepers
he doesnt sleep in a bed in a minecraft server along with everyone else
he purposefully didnt pay for the last months lease for the segway so it gets taken away
with tsubasas face on it
and leaves burning poop infront of the door
he rings tsubasas door bell and runs
same with cheese
he leaves bread out until it gets too dry for others to eat
Fudos 24 hour daily life
but thats illegal
or a streamer
i wonder if he plays pokemon go
just to break the quiet
has awkward small talk with one of the noble red in the kitchen
YE
a 24 hour episode of fudo
all of it
i wanna see what fudos daily life is
i want boom booms
just a prank bro?
oh
Fudou gear
Vanessas robot body tho <:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
whoever puts those is a good troll
yea it was

naw i meant this one
apparently that "blood splatter" near basas face in the preview pictures was just a destroyed alca noise
angery basa
daym that big sword
noone will know who did it
what if an old lady gets mugged near that place
thats crossing the damn line
i was so confused
i thought it said Mana not Maria
o
easier
dunno
noone will expect it
somehow
i predict those missiles are going to to save the day at the end of XV
they could be going around to this day
darn
i hope they landed on people eventually <:Ver:336656981144109066>
after they boarded the spaceship
what happened to the missiles at the beginning of GX episode 1
random question
NICE
during that i thought milaarc would make a civilian bystander look like her and that preview screenshot is tsubasa realising she stabbe someone herself
what would be the names of the other ones based on that
daym
<:MichaWhat:336657148627124225>
2nd seems kinda boring
first pic imo
lol
wew
i wonder if tsubasa has one of these
what is the one on the right?
also different design
new mouthflap poggers
lol
its called the brave perspective
milaarc also got some wild arms
when will they unlock the genjuurou transformation
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
except radiant force
lol

D E J A V U
anything could happen
siccccccccc
o a longer version of metanoia came out 2 days ago
even the full bodied android was confused that something like that was possible
damn i didnt expect him to pull that kind of move with the car
lol "show me the end of the world"
i just got a fire meme idea
and how many clones he can make
i wonder if there is a limit to what he can clone
shoulda snapped that thots limbs atleast
ya
this is the xv channel lol
Dessssssss
isnt that the same bridge with the previous scooter bois
but the whole stage is a clone
milaarc could be thinking she is slaughterinig 70000 people
you could try to sit on a chair but its actually a clone
shinji would be a great prankster
i forgot what the name of the ninja guy is
what if the ninja guy had gear 🤔
thinking with portals

😮
that bitch should keep her dirt covered cheeks that were on the ground off that vampires hands
my first one was that

sympho 👏 gear 👏
and the exact opposite of the above
and move the layer behind it
you just put any image
png

Dess flag for milaarc
show me the warudo
then dont <:Ver:336656981144109066>
hnnnngghhh
it must mean something
did ogawa run  someone over
there was a spot where the briefcase jumped while inside the car
how do you do a edgy meme by accident?
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
ever
i never really notice those rings and symbols
😮

it just works
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
Dam
mr krabs could be his disciple
*Ninja technique: Coin clone*
ogawa putting a coin into a vending machine
with the ninja guy he can triple the handholding
or when kanade died
why didnt basa awaken the mangekyou sharingan when that girl was killed infront of her
is enought of a "Hint"
the giant yellow light
i think
i
and on the wrong battlefield
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089> is a tool!
he is using a sword the way its suppose to you non kazanri blooded potato
he aint brainwashing his daughter
i wish fudou was my dad
maybe something with the clone and missiles in the background of those car windows? 🤔
the master is concentrating on it as we speak probably
What if ogawa tripled the time we had to wait for tge next episode <:CarolYandere:424047704826707980>
<:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
Would the clones have sin
If ogawa cloned miku
O didnt notice that
Also her phonic gain dropped to motorcycle mechanic levels
This why fudou needs to be strict
Unhand holding is unacceptable
what is that milaarc did to moustache guy
Milaarc has a kill count of 5 right?
does vanessa have one under her wig
i just thought that maybe fudou is like a genjuurou/ogawa combined by chance
o
same how tsubasa stabs a opponents shadow to stop them from moving
the other thing he can do is shadow weaving
hmmm did ogawa learn his techniques from the kazanari family
who?
wut that say
if ogawa was in that van it wouldnt have blown up
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
the illusions are clones
does he increas his chances of surviving the snap
if ogawa does the clone technique
2510 seasons <:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>

what meanings do g gx axz xv   have

<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>

i guess you could just have a layer of that png above the steamed hams the entire time
<@!256802531584376833>
im not going to jail
tsubasa not sad nani
vanessa didnt put her hands up

what if everyone in the stadium at episode 1 got a gungnir fragment
<a:HibikiOraOra:582365734097780746>
fucking weebs
yall get your weeb shit out of weeb shit
ewwwwwwwwwwww
English dub <:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
we got a job to do
there are still 7 billion people who havent seen the show
emote when
this wasnt even episode 9
5 whole more episodes of who knows what
hec
SECRET SEASON 6? NOICE
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
those scorers better have a grave scene at the end
h o t
wtf
when will we get a real beef stroganoff cameo this season
but for real
Can hibiki kill this cat
Fecocootus
And hair dye and implants
Im betting kanade is fudou but shaved
Yes
Anything can be a pebble in a certain point of view
Tru
Odds of fudou being hibikis dad in disquise? Never seen them in the same room
Scorpion part best 🦂
How does fudou even plan on controlling essentially a God
Btw did fudou give them normal blood instead
That cocoon sure has alot of laser based attacks
h o v e r l e g s
whats ssj
Time to make a new silly beef stroganoff meme
insta clapped
damn noble red just went poof
*when your kid just wont fucking listen*
still waiting for that actual beef stroganoff cameo
ill fix it
did i make a mistake?

i think i improved the image a bit more
ok
tsubasa broke the beef stroganoff 😦

some good beef gravy
symphogi nice pfp
there could be some translation stuff in this too
2 737 years
Semha said its been a million nights
**Why is hibiki being intensly measured**


<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720> very red dess at the end
hibiki gotta look clean when miku back to her senses
the measuring tape makes sense then
ah training
the rest idk wher that going
only the first part a bit
important information tho
just noticed that face
this was just far distance shot
heh
i forget its in mikus body even
good voice too
what was that thing she referenced about marias left arm
perfect shape imo

can you guys guess where i put the stroganoff this time
noic mem
kerrik teach me memery
can we just accelerate the studio near the speed of light and we can have episodes faster than we can watch them
just switch wednesday or thursday with saturday
or sneak into satelight to see it even earlier
is vanessa a rule 63 go go gadget?
oh nvm its something completely different
oh daym the new preview shots have a grave
☠ <:MikuSad:336657015961026560> oooh what are these emotes
like why not
im sure of it
shes gonna be okay
they will find a way to rescue miku
a new one lel
a video of cutting edge just dropped too
vanessa? 🤔
and this main one
<:MikuBliss:336657233712513024>
kinda late for a training arc? xD
this move looks familiar
wait does that mean that bikkis arm was inside ver
lol
A r m s
lol
that guy is a genious
im still not sorry
so gud
👌
anyone got sympho memes to steal?
damn custardians
can they turn into custard
only fudous cheekbones can open that sword
the red planet thing with the trees reminded me of this from god eater
image taken 1 second before alot of fisting
o
who that
and 21:13 shirabe and kirikia running gif too yey
6:56 and 19:48  chris,hibiki and tsubasa/maria running gifs pog

4th hole? <:CarolYandere:424047704826707980>
<a:HibikiOraOra:582365734097780746>
he stronk
he can make craters with anyone
well i mean why cant he do that
reentry to earth melted it? <a:ThonkSpin:438827233587494932>
<:HibikiHi:336657249827028993> give the animators mo money
that was earth
what if
<:fast:594322279459192854> what will they do if semha has a pickaxe
what u talking about its been more than "awesome"
<:ChrisShock:620077681484103680>  CHRIS ALMAGASOMETHING?
too op
what if hibiki was on that table instead
well not really limited to the face
the mistake of having a face for hibiki to punch
But even so the symphogears feelings are stronger than the words of the creator
wait whats kanekos full name
Hibiki punches kaneko
Hibiki punches Hibiki
God? Where? <a:HibikiOraOra:582365734097780746>
wait would the noise dissapear after the whole semha thing gets sorted
Hibiki punches ver back to life
hibiki and semha eating beef stroganoff together
there wont be a 13th?
next? 12?
has a old grass ever died to a lawnmower
i never thought about it
i have
it just hit me that Carols name is a type of song
thereso nly a manga of season 1 right?
<:Ver:336656981144109066> finally no more miku
i wish i had the middle all the way to the right view <:TsubasaSmug:585839805737467920>
tiny boob missiles?
wheres season 10
whats the title name
and symphogears cant be the ones fighting her
oh actually makes sense since she is on earth
oh those strings?
carol vs semha really?
wait wut
she has like 3 different hair styles at once
sad awoo
interasting
still awhile
well yeah not at the end
i wonder what vanessa is doing
and the symphogears arent transformed
and according to the previews vanessa isnt fighting until the end of next episode
vanessa met with them near the end of last episodes
Space cant suffocate us all
i heard Episode 14 is in area 51
it signals a very InDess moment
thats wtih every episode preview
unlike the ultimate perfect lifeform kars i think she can fly
i will say the Semha word
o
thats not shirabe?
oh actually 3 with that title art
2 hibikis
actually there might be a 6th season for that
hibiki will have to punch hibiki
what most anime do
ah so thats what the shooting stars referenced
mere minutes before we get another one of anons images
Holy shit?
i wonder what memories elfnein has lost <:ElfneinBullying:421432763078410241>
ogawas siblings yey
is there a vaccine for semha
like just a single arm or something
i wonder if symphogears are able to transform only partly
rip
never dissapoints
A FEW MORE MINUTES PROBABLY <@87512939107450880>
lol carol


Beef stroganoff would have been handy here IMO

bewb lasors

imagine the symphogear universe having CRISPR and semha wouldnt be able to do anything
Elfnein probably explained the bondage plan to <:GenjuurouThumbsUp:336657189475188740> with a straight face
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
Chris Schwerer Gustav when
i want to see semha eating spaghet
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
lol
imean what
well humanity sure is quick with the rule34 art
she gets to play every game on the planet
im actually jealous of semha
<a:HibikiOraOra:582365734097780746>
<:HibikiShock:336656371611074580>
and im fucking sure they will somehow
cuz i dont want anyone in my family to bother me in that 20 minutes
i might have to wait 2 days before i can watch the final episode after its release
will the server be deleted
no tsubilaarc 😦
and that bat thing too i guess
Rip only genetically engineered Awoo girl
ye
so
well we literally spoiled like every detail of episode 12 barely an hour after its release
lol
xv
in
are you trying to spoil tag AXZ
<:ChrisEating:384879395829186560> i hope they return
kami damn
Nr was Fine all along?!
who will be the last message
fudou, semha, nb redemtion arc when
Milaarc should have lived to shake hands with the 30k people she spared
i keep playing the part where vanessa hits the wall over and over again
and scare anything nearby
i bet they liked to gas people
imagine missing an episode
pritty sure elfnein burned those memories
bikki should have a beard in xv drive
im gonna skip the last episode
oh right thats a spoiler nickname
dont you hurt my tree
How dare you <@145705908716961792>
its alot of **tree** layin around
whats gonna happen with all of that **tree** after semha is gone
im jelly
she gets to see the stroganoff for the first time again
tru
is it rude to ask semhas age
i wonder if the stroganoff song awakened something far worse than semha
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158> i regret joining this garbage fire discord
xv
it took me till episode 4 of symphogear
semha is such a tool
we did surgery on a grape?!
topdads power lever would suprass genjuurous if he never ran away from the start
it ran away <:Ver:336656981144109066>
also is his emote gone
bikkis dad will be in the ending and theres nothing you can do about it <:Ver:336656981144109066>

Tsubasa concert survivor server
<:sadness:619521887445188608> when nothing happens
<:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970> nothing like a hectic idol show
Genjuurou with a gungnir 🤔
symphogear aint gay <:Ver:336656981144109066>
ur fake fantasies will stay memes<:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>

ye
pritty sure i was disracted by the actual transformation xD
i had to listen very carefully
say it*
oh yeah she does hear it
like the others
not even written anywhere on the transformation itself
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
<:HibiMiku:432007202136391690> will forever stay a meme
<:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616> there better be beef stroganoff
<:TsubasaYareYare:407397617451139073> i hope i can watch the episode without my family bothering me in that 20 minutes

its worth it
fudou would stillbe yelling at tsubasa
do video games cause violence in symphogear
d o p e
damn all 9 of them standing there
<:ElfneinBullying:421432763078410241> i want to see more bullying
justice is dead

i want to smack <:CarolShock:430939013235474432> for hurting that man
i wish i had dr ver color
they better be prayin at dr vers grave at the end of the episode

Dinoboy is badmouthing true heroes <:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
😦
but
when will we get Senki Zesshou Symphogear Movie: Ressurrection Ver
i wonder if the opening will be skipped
time will stop forever
Their lives will forever be a stand still because they wont get animated anymore
xv or unlimited
wait wich op
Fine is dead and in the op
can ogawa clone a new universe where season 6 exists
i almost forgot about the ogawa cloning meme
cute 2d girls would be a bonus being isekaid
does it make xv an isekai cuz they were at the moon
kinda hard to do that when i dont know he letters
<:GenjuurouThumbsUp:336657189475188740>
but what does it mean in weeb language
what is this in non weeb language
<:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367> but it was one of the most fun ones
<:KanadeSinging:421432676789256202> o wew a kanade dying emote
by the time the minecon ends Symphogear episode 13 arrives

yo <@506219877724454929>
lul
Worst show ever. I hate symphogear now 😡 No beef stroganoff reference
tbh the yggdrasil being able to move the entire planet like that was badass
D:
i know the perfect place to put the beef stroganoff
Ooooh
emotes when
she figured out milaarcs location
she smart k
dat Symphogear killer vs God killer thing
i wonder what mr anon do for this finale
the dead cant talk
why not both
ugh hated her
the worst part of the episode was that they showed carol in that light thingy
lol wasnt expecting that one
;_;
Yeeted
whos Cypher
oof
is there still noise?
daym
in a movie i mean
now i want hibiki to actually kill miku
basa pls
LOL
so they can

i doubt they geh
carol pls
yeah its the greatest let down trueblade
ima make a bunch of beef stroganoff memes from this episode tomorrow
lol
why didnt the 70000 people show up in that scene next to milaarc
tru
would this work
i have an important carol troll physics question
Guys. Guys guys
god entrusted the future to them
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089> its taking you awhile?
wtf thats impressive actually
too bad theres less of it later in alicization <:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
<:GenjuurouThumbsUp:336657189475188740> those things are always fun to watch
k <:TsubasaYareYare:407397617451139073>
not sure what to do about the months
hm
AS (after symphogear)
... guys we should start a new calendar
<:ChrisEating:384879395829186560> sao in less than 2 weeks
<:TonyEyeRoll:580561912513691679>
^
<:MichaWhat:336657148627124225> and not symphogear?
still guud idk
Keijo!!!!
oof
its like everything is preventing it from spreading at all <:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
any extra people investing in the show is worth it imo
Officejobgear a decade later
already got hibiki as the lion
Symphogear circus spinoff
not sure still
tried finding something
is the name John wayne vercingetorix a reference to anything btw
<:ElfneinBullying:421432763078410241> elfnein didnt end up forgetting what bullying is like
screw narrative bs <:TsubasaYareYare:407397617451139073>  just do it <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
imo it adds spice to everything
i love those scenes
cuz i started on the 3rd season without realising it
thats the first 6 minutes of symphogear ive ever seen
They definetly should have had a massarcre in the hospital too imo
🦀 🦀 🦀 🦀 Symphogear Gone 🦀 🦀 🦀 🦀
mikiki
i think tsubasa hated her "dad"
yiss new music videos from nana mizuki
what year was it in symphogear

but with long hair
was watching Mahoutsukai reimikei || hundreds of years old blonde loli and can replenish power with a kiss || reminds me of carol a bit
