Thanks! <:TikiPraise:672430544381935625>
Holy shit Finally I got my giga hearts. Four days well spent I guess
Theres a green carol with autoscorers down at 1.1m. Alphanova
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
I just wanna LU my basa
I've got 79 rainbow and 50 dex. 13 heart. This is the only hard raid I've farmed
Does anyone ever do heart raids? I've never seen one below like 1.4m and Carol just will not give me any
<:MikuCute:672908542763859968>
Thanks for the assists. Got giga reds and giga melody
Seems cool and a change of pace from CR
My job is pretty boring I'll take whatever I can get lol
Is band of thieves episode 1 the place to start?
Thanks for the hit, I'd follow back if I could
Looks interesting, I'll check it out tomorrow at work <@165030821353226240>
Will look it up
Never even heard of it
Thanks. Yeah hopefully. I'm up a few more hours for critical role anyway so I'll be able to hit a few more times as well
Cleared some slots
Gimme three min to finish this raid run and I will
Ive got a other one up if you're feeling helpful
<:MikuSad:336657015961026560>

Oof that was actually really close. I'd say my max under half is about 400k
Yeah np. Hope I get my last 1 too

Nice
I'm.not sure how I do below half, I usually hit twice and wait for other people to get it to red
Just takes like 10 min
I can do ~600 in 5 cp so I can hit it twice if needed

<@!263392442345193472> did my best, hopefully others will pile on it now
<@!263392442345193472>
Both scorers down, have at it
hit your bikki tyr
but it's only been a problem for a month or two?
Absolutely. The best thing you can do for her is to convince her to see a pro about it, even once
Has she not sought any sort of professional help for it at this point?
The important thing to remember is that you can't even think about helping them if you aren;t able to take care of yourself first.
I 100% get the bargaining to take care of themself. It's hard when all you want is to help
This outranks your, and definitely our, paygrade. Someone local who can offer real help is the best bet
I definitely get <@!165030821353226240> perspective too. But i also get how hard it is to give up on someone you're this close to. I don't wanna pull the old man card, I barely outage you (25) . But they do have a point in that you're young. There's only so much you can be expected to deal with. This needs a much more serious touch in the end
Your best bet is appealing to her mother. She sounds like she needs real help, a real anything to be her wakeup call. If you and/or her mom are able to convince her of that and try to get here - again - to get professional help for it, would be the best option
"Too old" in her words or they actually don't care?

It is a crazy difficult situation. The friend I mentioned before, we went from every day talking for three+ years to once a month maybe, largely due to this issue. It's a big burden to bear. And I completely understand wanting to bear with her and support. No one will fault you for that. But it is important to know that you can only do so much, and it's *her* battle in the end. And the responsibility doesn't rests on your shoulders whatever happens. Your mental wellbeing is still priority.
I've got miracles too gdi just gimme color crsystals
Khajit has melody if you have power
Same
