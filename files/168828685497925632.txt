Oh right sorry
I’d like to!
More people to talk geahs with is nice
Can share my art here too
Also damn... I barely remember paintchat
You’re right, that was *ages* ago
Listen, I hacked my 3ds so I could gay marry fe girls and soleil is my conquest wife
Why not make her my icon lol
And what do you mean how long it’s been?
Ahah yeah that’s me!
it can't be helped
she doesn't like me
Anyway, I’m DL and symphogear is my absolute favorite anime
I was feeling pretty lonesome until I got several of my friends into it by not shutting up about it ever. I draw it a lot too
Thought I’d check out this discord and maybe talk with some new people
Hah
Oh ryoko didn’t say hi
you're the one who translated the mikugear event?
Oh geez
Parm is my friend ^^
look away
oh dear my art is so old
I can understand that
Sherab works hard ^^
And that’s a shame
Hm yeah fanart probably wouldn’t fly unless you got permission
Better to err on the side of caution
!!! Very good joe!
I wanna see kirika spooning shirabe in their sleep 😢
Miku taking the initiative 👌
God that’s so good
👀💦
Thirsty miku pov
I can’t believe the only definition we got from her was that half second flash in G
Miku complimented her abs... please... give her muscles... my crops are dying
Buffbiki is so good
Tangentially related but have some sunny dorks arm wrestling and their gfs eating it up

Backs are sexy 🤤
wow I'm glad asuka and homura are married
I’m glad you like it
Ahh yeah that’s one of my faves I’ve done but that’s not exactly spooning 😅
You’ll have to be more specific
Thank you for the TL dragon
Shirabe taking the initiative 👌
Listen, when the English speaking geah fandom is as small as it is, I won’t complain ~~too much~~ about fic quality when it contains things I like 😭
Practice makes better! I’ve been doing it for years
👌
aw, that's dorbles
😭
Kirishira make me happy

Same
👀👀👀👀👀❤️
but germain's charm points are her eyebrows
turns out she's amazing
it's funny because when my friends and I first saw her design revealed and read her character description we hoped she wouldn't come off as tasteless
she's wonderful
Truly unfortunate
If you have big thighs, they should touch
I’m at an impasse with Maria bc thanks to that op she’s fit but I also imagine her to be squish bc the animators try to give her big thighs but at the same time give her a thigh gap which makes it look awkward
When you put it that way, it’s funny
Unfortunately no
Mm, my sentiments exactly
Thank you kindly. It’s nice to hear
I was wondering what you were talking about and... huh. Figures. I’m not gonna look at the thread but I woke up to another rude anon and I guess I know how that came to be 😓
Who posted my art there anyway
Cagliostro seems like a very DTF character, so yeah, saying it as a verb isn’t out of the question
Zio beat me to it lol
Haha well ping me once she finds it
<@!102691114762371072> that art is illegally perfect, where’s the source? 👀
Why want bigger boobs when you have a perfectly suitable girlfriend who has them for you, and you have special girlfriend privileges
That’s a better interpretation lol
Breast envy is a bad trope and needs to burn 
Especially when people force it on characters who canonically don’t care about it in canon
I can’t wait for kanade to rescue her wife atop a flaming horse
it's okay
oh, I've never thought about drawing ballet
I will forever be sad that they never got to hold hands ;_;
aw shucks


I *loved* the scene where they're recuperating and germain takes the time to tuck prelati in and place the towel on her forehead
little actions but it speak volumes of her character and how she treasures her comrades
I drew this immediately after lati got her ass kicked by dmjii
more sleeps because they're all tired and need to rest
<@456226577798135808>
couple cosplay ideas
first is genshiken, second is yozakura quartet

don't forget these
sad thing is, I think one of them was a long-time follower who also commissioned me
then that got reblogged by others
no, but someone reblogged one of my recent posts, and attached screenshots and stuff
although I don't understand why they had to go and "call me out" instead of just unfollowing me entirely
welp, responded
doubt I'll say anything more; will probably just block
my friends and I talk a lot about the nuances and shifts that occur within the character dynamics
yeah, exactly
<@!99158582326497280> 
"that's better because at least it's not het"
boybiki has a better chance of feeling a little odd if he's still sharing a bed with miku, for starters
boybiki and kiri-kun are still fundamentally hibiki and kirika
the only differences are what would be expected for a boy instead of a girl
right
tbhhhhh
I mean, it'd be one thing if I paired them with a faceless anon self-insert, but I'm not
honestly, I don't think what I'm doing is even that bad
aw, thank you
"I understand you don’t view the F/F ships as inferior and you’re mostly genderbending them because you find the potential change in dynamics interesting, but it honestly comes across as creepy that you constantly draw lesbian ships as straight"
>constantly
99.9% of my content is gay
speaking of drama, i'm getting discourse right now for drawing genderbent het gears
aside from the transphobia, I'm baffled this anon thinks saint-germain is or was ever male to begin with

it's fine; you guys are more civil than others who had stuff to say about my art
that's a little what I'm aiming for anyway lol
I personally think it's unfair that when a character is genderswapped, their builds are significantly altered to be more traditionally masculine/feminine. For example a buff dude will suddenly become dainty and thin when a girl, instead of just being... a buff girl. 
and idk, I just think that's further enforcing cis ways of thinking about bodies
that's fine, I don't expect everyone to like what I do. I just don't get why someone would tell me my stuff sucks or demand I change my style because they don't like it, instead of ignoring me and going about their day
I have my guesses it's actually someone who has seen the show; they probably just target me specifically because they don't like how I draw the girls
the wording feels similar
yeah, I've had experience with trolls before, unfortunately
thank you though
I dunno, heavily considering just disabling it entirely
I want to be accommodating to shy users and those with no account but I'm starting to get worn down by this nonsense
I get nice anons more often than the one I just got
this just seems to happen every time I post new art
I'm considering it, in all honesty
oh, that'd be nice saki
I can dm you
I took your advice to heart and installed it a couple days ago
nothing's really showing up at the moment though
I thought so too, but they just keep coming
and thanks lucifer
the last one I remember called me the f-slur
so that was nice
today's message
https://gyazo.com/658f7cfd35e0d89af6562b50851306da
probably, all of them kind of blur together after a while
this anon legitimately confounds me. I think they stalk my blog just to send hate every time I draw something. I've tried blocking them but the messages keep coming =/
this has been going on for weeks now
