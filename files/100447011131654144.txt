Tsukihime came first so no
It's a reference to Red Arcueid from Melty Blood/Tsukihime
what would be revoked would be the marriage license, right? and that's a one time thing
post de facto laws are not legal constitutionally in the US iirc, but that is a federal law and not really state, but they could very easily lose that case if it were brought up in court
actually, weirdly enough, would this have relation to alcohol prohibition and alcohol consumption pre-prohibition in terms of precedent with illegality?
it's a weird issue that's very complicated in terms of the law
very weird
so it may be a per state thing then
I suggest going and voting if at all possible, but you don't have to vote for every specific election. I mostly suggest it so you can vote for more local positions which can more directly affect you. But if you don't feel comfortable with it then you have the right to that.
Don't know Gwen really but I'm wishing them and their family and their friends the best

yeah it doesn't affect the results, it's just the statement could be wrong and spread misinformation
which iirc Fox is also using
This is Google's map, but it uses AP's data
as it currently stands, AP's "predictions" are closer to calls on how the electorate ends up voting per state, which could lead to false claims to be made about the full election winning when it quite literally isn't true, it's a statement much closer to "This is what the electorate is saying" than "This is what we think the electorate is saying"
This is kind of insane

official HP commercial
ah, that's still pretty scummy
wait are they charging like, actual money for pronoun roles? because I'm 99% sure that's against Terms of Service

Animal Farm does not require discussion
```because schools and libraries should not “put books in a child’s hand that require discussion”```
Call of Duty is not nearly that nuanced sadly
