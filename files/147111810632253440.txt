<@!124052248144642050> You wouldn't happen to have any more follower space, would you?

Okay so here's what I've found: it takes around 2.5 hours at minimum before you can find a raid that isn't a friend.
Holy the level of whales is insane...
Same, just added you.
In my experience, anyway.
Anyone that isn't his friend won't be able to find it.
Since Haz's raid has 24 minutes
My hunch is that the filter doesn't actually specifically search for your criteria, it literally refreshes the main list and filters it.
*Unless* there are VERY few TOTAL raiders.
Raids with less than 1 hour also can't be found.
You already have her at MLB - might as well go all in <:ShirabeWink:672661604319363103>
Thought she was pretty bad until LU
But she's Lv63
I am
Wait that can't be true <@!204501539308568577>  I have some of those.
Do a raid and try again.
Hm, then I'm not sure. I've found that it fixes for me sometimes when I raid agian.
I think Kanade is a welfare.
XD Kanade is technique holy
I'll trade you some for Miracle mats.

Now I have no idea why this is.
Yep, only friends can see <60 and >4 hours as far as I can tell.
But I guess 90K probably dead.
Or it dropped below the 60 minute remaining mark.
But I need enhancers like today to stay alive in Arena.
Whew 2/2 welfares are INT.
Oh nvm
AoT is still around for a few days.
But it's so... Far... Away...
So we're supposed to get 6?
I can now see public raids with 5 hours on the clock.
There was a while where it was impossible to see public raids with 5 hours left, only friend raids.
Did they do something with raid finding? I can finally find raids with 5 hours left again.
Why unpause? What does that do exactly?
Got it, so basically trading Challenge for Hunt?
Why highest dmg too?
What the heck ahaha
Does it grant hunt?
I'm missing something here.
I'm jk
~~I died~~
I didn't do any of those sanic raids so I'm not too familiar.
Oh I see.
How does this work.
Do I pause or just kill?
I'm in.
I also got some giga rainbows.
Mega miracle I think, not giga.
Got some miracles.
Thanks for the raid!
I was asleep too - though I'm always down for Green Carols.
~~wrong channel~~
With an Asian family.
Professional care, if you can make her, is probably the best course.
And yeah oooh boy. Her family probably doesn't give her much support in this?
Am asian. Makes sense.

I take back what I said about Discord advice being dubious. This is pretty quality advice and suggestion.
That is tough.
You can also chat with them here: https://www.nationaleatingdisorders.org/help-support/contact-helpline
(800) 931-2237 from 11 am to 9 pm Eastern. Just write it down and call them. To call anonymously, call *678009312237 from your phone.
We have to hold out hope that this is the time to be the last.
This will be your way of supporting her - even though it's chronic, even though it's happened over and over again.
11 am to 9 pm ET. Just call them and ask for a nearby professional for her.
What timezone are you?
<@!192304778938679296> Can I have you call the National Eating Disorder helpline tomorrow morning when they open? They can be reached at (800) 931-2237
Yeah I know right - that's crazy.
Are you in America?
It's especially scary to not understand and not feel needed.
I know - it's scary.
So you'll have to help her with it - even though it definitely hurts.
Just lets the problem go on.
You're absolutely right, being alone doesn't fix anything.
And good on your for doing so and supporting her.
That probably hurts.
Thanks for saying that.
<@!192304778938679296> This might be a little strange and possibly even a little crass, but what do *you* want to hear from us right now? Do you want advice (and in which direction - break up or work through it)? Are you looking just to talk about it? Something else?
I'm sorry man - that is a difficult situation.
Seems right, I'm at 900 Melody, 30 Giga Melody.
You must have thousands of lower tier melody.
Holy 82 Giga Melody.
tl;dr: I know it's painful. And it will probably be for a while. But call (800) 931-2237 reeeeeee
