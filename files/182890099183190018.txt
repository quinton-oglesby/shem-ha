Hello my name is Nara and I love Symphogear to death

i should probably just look for a bunch of artists and follow them
hard to find a starting point
~~i gotta figure out howto find em then~~
does twitter have an active symphogear community?
my life has been a lie
i thought she was just an awkward person
wait kirichan is a bot?
hola
haha
hellooooo ~

Good day
Hello
heyhey
hoi
UwU
heyhey
hewwo
I thought someone joined but I think it was nothing
Hi
10/10
Indeed I did
do you like anime? uwu
Makes sense
This is genius
You caught me off guard
Yet üëÄ
I havent
Thats fanfic material
And exciting
Also they dont need seperate beds. They fight for dominance
<@102691114762371072> no u
jiiiii
<:TsubasaSmug:585839805737467920>
Heh
Why does the dog have a wing
anything that could be said has already been said
Im trying to come up with a clever response, but I cant
I needed this
but holy shit I love this episode so much
"She cant sing underwater"
but they can sing in space
can I be nitpicky for a second?
so like maybe the water itself wasnt really a big deal and it was just for cool showoff shit
because hibiki said afterwards: ||but I still got a song in my heart||
they just said that "she cant sing under water" thing impulsively
ok let me just stretch faaaar
I think
||thats some 4kids level subbing lol||
I need to buy one rightnow tbh
I love scarfs
and I love hibikis scarf so much
hardcore chills
i had
the transformation sequence was the best in the series imo
Im wearing  rose tinted glasses
but I have a very strong pro symphogear bias
I love the episode tbh
I never watched it for crazy consistent deep writing
as if symphogears writing was ever good to begin with lol
I like english
they were very english
I can not speak japanese but I liked the subs
or maybe japanese is just too different
maybe its just me
I cant tell for japanese, but I was always annoyed when english teachers turned on subtitles for english movies in class
makes sense
just out of curiousity, why are you even using subs if you understand japanese?
yep
is art
that transformation
that
***burst mode***
I guess english subs took "creative liberties" or some shit
so I just asked a friend who watched the ep with german subtitles, and they got the "freeze to death" part right
but honestly if genjuro can lift building, the geahs can sing in space
they sang in space a bunch of times
without x drive?
didnt they sing in space in GX?
I dont mind it I was just meming
tbh
singing in space is ok because I say so
lol
someone legit just told me that singing in space makes total sense because they are just high in the sky, not in the vacuum of space
Hibimiku
Chrisbasa
DMJii

Chrisbasa
And then the CR announcement happened so I wanted to watch their version
I was slow
I know
I forgot almost everything from axz
<a:SakiShock:454116812276105227>
Peeps always have to explain stuff to me
Btw how did they do that? Is that an ichaival airgetlam combination?
Can I just say I love the armorless gears?
Yes
I want elfnein to cover carols song
^
Lol
No wonder it gets me hyped every time
The love they pour into this show
God
Thats wholesome
Why wait for more transformations when the best one already happened
Eva
Ah
Wait for real?
Vampires sleep in coffins
Cause they called it holy corpse
Is the custodian dead?
So like
119 good girl
Lol
That was after g
I started getting into symphogear in 2014
Budget isnt everything
üòé
At leaat on the northern hemisphere
But its still winter technically
good and bad arent objective terms
also yes
yes
nah I change a lot, but one thing that doesnt change is me completely losing my *** over the smallest stupidest things in an anime
<:BikkiO:597086106948861952>
I dont
yall grow and change
no wait
we grow and change
the first episode was fire
this season has fire force and dr stone, people were highly anticipating these so im not gonna judge yet
But i dont get dbfz at all
Maybe im just weird
I found it easier to get into tekken 7 than into dbfz
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
It makes you smart viliml
Lol
Most jojo references are in western youtube videos
I think ive created a healthy bubble for myself
But I guess thats a thing with every fambase
Peeps who watch it purely for memes can get really damn annoying
Jojo can be that
Uh
Its okay
yeah same
my ex' boobs were just as smol as shirabes and she was like 20 at the time lol
shes just skinny
idk what gives me these vibes
i know they are not
idk in my head kiri and shirabe are like 10 for some reason
wsince when is kiri so tall
wait
Im stoopid then
Im unsure rn
Wait did all the final ep attacks get cards?
Iirc
I think testament was the only one she ever got
Yeh
Poor basa
A season for bikkis origin story bjt its just episode 1 season 1 stretched to 13 episodes
was about to say
nice
oh so I wasnt the only one who got an "& knuckles" vibe from the concert?

Corrupted chat
Thats not really hard to dig
9 episodes for part 1
Its called christianity I think
Theres an entire religion based around a jojo character
Its crazy
<:strongThink:439537658314883082>
Solopy567 is a jojo reference
Also Symphogears are a jojo reference
Yeah but like vampires are a jojo reference and also alchemy is a jojo reference
U rite
:0
I didnt even notice tarot motifs
Adam smells like nuclear fusion
Adams voice isnt even that sexy
He has his youth behind him
He is already grown up
He doesnt exist to grow. He exists to let others grow
I wanna compare Genjuro to All Might.
flat character arcs arent a bad thing
Genjuro was a leading factor to the character arcs of bikki, tsubasa AND chris
Source: season 1
Genjuro isnt supposed to be a developed character. He has a flat character arc. He develops the characters around him
bikki probably wipes the floor with genjuro at this point
^
and Genjuro is certainly not stronger than x drive
Genjuro instantly dies when noise touch him
I wish SAO was about people being stuck in an MMO that kills them if they die
^
tbf I think a lot of these definitions differ from source to source
I love this comic lmao
Dess
üò¨
Took me a while but I love it now
<:TsubasaSmug:585839805737467920>
I dont think they will get Kiss to perform a symphogear song
Yeh
Adults have no friends
lol
and its the best thing I have ever seen in my life
yes
„Ç®„É´„Çµ <@263983345669505025> there you go
I assume that it doesnt really matter
~~thats good btw~~
sounds like your average kirika song
Bless you chris
<:TsubasaSmug:585839805737467920>
I love the wiki

~~thats why symphogear fansubs are better~~
Crunchy translations are yikes when its comes to accuracy
Ofc
Let it gooooo
Youre right
It actually says sa
Oh
Doesnt it say Eruza?
<:TsubasaSmug:585839805737467920>
I like Symphogear
Yeh
<:TsubasaSmug:585839805737467920>
Duolingo taught me more than school
Same
Dont think its that far fetched
Episode 3 is the aftermath of a terror attack
So XV isnt delayed or anything right?
why would you want that to be longer
symphogear already stretches the middle plot a lot of times
the thing is
its like saying "lol stands in jojo came out of nowhere for no reason"
and yeah, not every brick has to be introduced from the start, especially when most seasons work without a sequel
tbf I was also a bit put off by alchemy at first, but those were like... teenager "I want my noise back and wanna see enemy gears" thoughts
out of character or uninterestingly
or characters act a bit well
sometimes its a bit messy
I dunno I think the plot of symphogear connects well
not really about changing him
its more about understanding his approach
and also kinda indirectly act like the taste of people who disagree is somehow worse than yours (maybe thats not your intention, but thats how it comes off sometimes)
theres a clear tendency of you to talk down on it
but like
negatively
I also criticize the series
im not even saying negative criticism isnt valid
and avoid talking about things I dont love
I constantly talk about how much I love the things I love
lol
everything I hear from you is negative
but like
this isnt supposed to sound as passive aggressive as it does
honestly I dont understand why you are so obsessed with calling symphogear trash on a symphogear server
lol
why the hell are you assuming future plot
that you personally dont like something and that its entirely subjective
so what you are trying to say is
<@239893407122718721>
are you trying to say that fine being related to most of the future plot lines is bad writing?
im not sure I understand
wait
so after watching it a bunch of times you noticed that some of the stuff was written with a certain intention
I appreciate it kerrik
she is a child and was never allowed to be one
and for kirika it wasnt even out of nowhere
you can absolutely develop it out of nowhere
CW suicide: ||but people saying "thats not how suicidal people act" is exactly what made a lot of suicidal people act||
i honestly should put a spoiler tag around this stuff even if i onlyscratch the surface
and the way you argue is also a bit eeeh
not everyone has a psychological degree
and there is something called suspension of disbelief
humans act differently
even if it doesnt
a lot of people think like this
i understand why you think this way
and invalidating this isnt really helping anyone
because there are people who act on it
but please dont invalidate the depressive thoughts of people
i will try to not make it too dark
ok so like
dont wanna make it darker than it needs to be
ok im not gonna comment on that
also keep this explanation going kerrik, I love the way you do that
i really dont see how that doesnt make sense
and then you think "fuck im such an asshole I dont deserve to live"
and then you try to be a good human and learn that your entire reason for acting shitty was actually just wrong
sometimes a change of mind happens fast, especially when youre an anxious teen who suffered abuse and manipulation your whole life
but it makes sense to be sudden
because it is sudden
I mean I get how someone would think its sudden
how is that not in character
so I rewatched the scene and like
im gonna rewatch that scene real quick
was that actually what happened tho
thigh highs automatically make her an amazing character
she has striped socks
ok
like... actions that actually have a purpose
I personally love finding reasons like this
understanding why something was written the way it was doesnt really make it bad imo
and yeah, a meta reason is a good thing in my opinion
she thought she is doing the right  thing
wants to protect everyone and stuff
was used the entire time
she is pretty young and impressionable
I think it totally fits tho
Fine?
What are you refering to here
its not like its pulled out the ass
group songs happened all the time, as wfc said, the training was about anyone doing it with everyone any time
*miracle*

a hyperbole
so basically
it sounds an awful lot like that
this sounds like "deku 1million% makes no sense"
during the fight she mentioned that she just wants to protect her
like
but she always would have traded her life away to save shirabe
ofc it also was about that
it wasnt about her being desperate to live
she didnt want to become fine because that would mean should wouldnt be able to be with her friend and protect her
thats not even speculation
to protect shirabe
that she is doing everything she does
all the time
and like
during the fight
she talked about it
but like
ok
you are not trying to imply that kirika using her swan song against shirabe was not logical are you?
and?
and hide their feelings
people put up barriers
its not like kirika has always been on a happy smile vacation
and for kirika it was definitely built up gradually through her surroundings
but depressive people dont always show it publicly
Sometimes I just want a cute emote under my post
I dont really see the problem with reacting to your own message
in 3 hours for mortals such as myself
<:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
oh god
is that an impression or the original voice
wait
crazy how this season keeps delivering
chris is 18 in XV
I dont think lewdness is the issue
nah
||I just believed america was evil because its symphogear||
the most naive person I know
but Im like
I didnt see it coming tbh
my ranking is 2>3>1
~~3 episodes~~
this entire season so far has been absolutely amazing
||that twist in the end HOLY CRAP||
||the booby bullets||
chris transformation made me laugh really hard
SO GLAD
Im so glad this dialogue exists
GET FUCKED
Also: Thank you for learning from GX
kiru
but I kinda wish it was restricted to actual duets
I love seeing combo stuff
if they ever dub it, theyd probably leave the songs untranslated anyway
yeah
they also have to be able to voice act
picking up people who can sing isnt the problem
madoka even has an official german dub
8 years is a lot
madoka wouldnt work if it didnt start slow
cant upset paying customers
yeah its obvious its supposed to appeal to as many people as possible
i know
like... hibimiku would work sooo well
id still like to see some lesbian relationship in geah
leaving relationships unconfirmed gives room for headcanons
yeh
I like her so far
Vore has everything to do with everything
Carol did nothing wrong
Symphogear likes giving villains a redemption
in a hate like way
>Eins Wing
I will never escape this meme will i
IMGUEIBVUWIB
finally someone who is equally losing her shit
**who did this**
who did this
"For Symphogear XV ·µÉ‚Åø·µà ·µê·µÉ ≥·∂¶·µÉ"
how could you
melua
lmao
the channel description
symphogear is what keeps me going
symphogear is the opposite of suffering
people just wanna stick to their opinion at all cost
thats not even just a lesbian thing
people like to ignore obvious stuff that isnt directly held into the camera
if they were sisters people would call the show out for incest
Miku and Hibiki are so clearly lesbian
lesbian power move, holding hands
symphogear episode 13 will be like korra where bikki and miku hold hands
watching last weeks episode like "AND NOW THEY KISS...  SHIT"
^^^^^^^^^^
my prediction: episode 13 after credits scene
:c
that pun was glorious
oh ffs
yes
i will eat symphogear if they do
yeah I was suprised by how easily they got ripped apart
carol fused with elfnein
carol reincarnation somewhat made sense tho.
ver doesnt really have any special super powers, hes just dead.
fines soul got completely annihilated
<:Ver:336656981144109066> ai desu yo
wasnt that the formula for linker or something?
`Restart Ame no Habakiri 10 to do a software update`
yeah you can block channels
big brain take
~~fuck protoss~~
carol has always been a hero because there is no pain when everyone is dead :^)
was never really a fan of the the autoscorrers, but seeing them care so much for elfnein made my heart go woob woob
honestly this episode alone has made me appreciate the GX villains by at least 10 units of like
hate this website
the episode hasnt even been out for a day, lets just ruin it for everyone by spoiling shit
gj crunchyroll
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpE8VqcQ2uc
tho thats just speculation
in the transformation elfnein had smol tits, maybe theyve grown a little since gx
did it for some less pleasant ones
Plot twist, carol is gonna lead noble red now :^)
children
^
nerf heart
heart broken
qwq
why they gotta do that
holy fuck
the credits
she reminded me a lot of freiza
it was great
is the reason a miracle happened
i love the fact that the murderer of miracles
miku is god now
if i die i will meet god
if i die i will meet miku
symphogear killed me
im dead
did we really see what amalgam is capable of?
but still hype as hell
kinda gave it away
i wish people didnt point out the episode title
rip
the real fudo is the friends we made along the way
their first mistake was trusting fudou
<:ShirabeConcern:586404485598019604>
"A bit blurry at times"
Do you know how animation works?
Carol is ridiculously strong afaik
I hate CR
Carol still lost
E
<:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
wouldnt it be cool if episode 9 was the final episode for ever?
Goku
In my head its super saiyan oof
Oh ssj is shenshoujing
What if Miku defeats God with the phylosophical concept of lesbianism because god doesnt believe in gay üò≥
Yeh
Ssj wasnt complete
Was about to say that
Yeh
What happened to ssj in g? It was completely destroged right?
Rip
Mikuuuu
Dang VAs draining all the money
Symphogear overhyped overrated üòî ü§ô
Or am i stupid
Wasnt it like ep 6 in season 1?
Hm?
Did you pay the shipping fee or do you have prime?
<:TsubasaSmug:585839805737467920>
Its just an idea
Maybe
Pals... I think Bikki and Miku might be lesbians for each other :0
<:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
üò≥
<:TsubasaSmug:585839805737467920>
Or we just wait a week at a time
SymphoGOAT
Im expecting some interference because of amalgam
Shit Genjuro vs fudo would be cool as fuck
I bet genjuro could 1v1 shem ha
I agree
I guess it matters for fanfics or potential spin offs
Does it matter? Its the last season anyway
Miku looks so cool
lmao
A girl back in elementary school was named shema and i think about her  every time i read shem ha
learned something today
that means zesshous never really "lost" that much impact, they just never had it to begin with as the only zesshou death was caused by "not enough linker"
i never thought about the linker thing
gen is the best dad
the only good example i can think of is carols dad
im honestly scared because i hate the way symphogear portrays parenthood
its made up
this one was written by a writer
it never happened
its fiction
no
i mean elfnein is technically just somewhat of a copy of carol
its probably more like a 2nd personality of elfnein
frick?
the 1 good father had a daughter who wanted to yeet the world.
symphogear teaches us: "be a terrible dad, cause thats how you make your children great"
yeh
that was my main problem with how GX did it
Im fine with him redeeming himself as long as its actually redeeming him and not just "just forgive him lol"
mom said its my turn on the custodian
i mean same
if they just expand on that im gucci
xv already had that phone call
get you a moon that looks at a girl like yourself looks at shemha
hot
k
where they force a weird character development transformation onto everyone
i dont want another GX disaster
honestly the moment they said "sry you arent allowed to use the amalgam" it was pretty obvious that we wouldnt see much of it until the last episodes
<:ShirabeConcern:586404485598019604>
Whats the point of a reference of you reveal it immediately
Everything
Suffering from the aftermath of a war isnt exactly fun for anyone
My grandfather was around during the 2nd world war and trust me he is nothing like Fudou
Eh
its not needed
but
lol
all he needed was the seal
i dont see why fudou would order nb to kill a ton of innocent **japanese** citizens
connect the dots
and there are the keywords
A happy ending is happy
*always*?
if you take away all of the letters in hibiki and add a bunch of randomly selected letters it says "it just works"
Symphogear is Symphogear
<:TsubasaSmug:585839805737467920>
Jojo fans have poop brains
You forgot an important point
its the same in every fandom
people will always HC cute villains as uwu babies
thats their purpose in the story
villains
they are
yes
define redeeming quality
it doesnt really flesh anything out
always feels like "btw did you know this character is evil?"
the rape line was really unnecessary
i dislike ver's fanbase, but I think ver is fine
yeah its super stupid
I dont mind him in GX, but at the same time I hate that people claim "he redeemed himself" when all he did was helping the main cast for selfish reasons
Ver's existence is justified, simply by the fact that a lot of people like him as a villain
exactly
<:MikuPraise:585839808765493249>
*they*
shem-ha is not an object
Lol
I hope theyll keep the franchise alive
Its time
Ep 10 looks kinda eh
Oh so I wasnt seeing things?
Im scared of the next episodes
:c
Scared that they arent gonna be as good as I want them to be
same thing really
fuck the moon
no
but in the image theres 2 bikki
there is only 1 bikki
this isnt correct
excuse me
completely forgot about the after credits scene in the final ep where they explain why hibiki (and miku) can serve as a vessel
i should have rewatched axz before xv
Wasnt it dragged closer in season 1?
<:TsubasaSmug:585839805737467920>
Fucking minion movie reference
mikus wedding dress
because they are friends
they are hugging
might just be stockholm syndrome or something like that
Kanade üíÄ <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
MAGIC
KRIISA
HHHREHJBZE
Her hair green like in s1
Miku is gonna dye
thats weird
but isnt the reset what makes gods invincible?
SSJ kill gear
gungnir kill god
but with SSJ they both have a type advantage against each other
cause gungnir would otherwise just win by default
thinking about it, SSJ is probably the only way to make the battle against shem ha kinda interesting
as she did in i think G
when she summons giant swords
tsubasa has a defensive move
when she absorbed all the other gears power
yeah that was the thing at the end of axz
is what im referring to
armor purge
oh
hm?
it can naked
i never really thought about it but does kirikas zesshou make igalima a philosophical weapon?
Mikugear spin off!
Turn the faust robe of SSJ into a symphogear!
Hmmm
does elfnein have the knowledge to create new symphogears in theory?
It makes me happy that we thought the same thing
thats not what i mean
huh
I mean perfect as in "i love her as a character"
I dont mean perfect as in "can do everything"
but I get what you mean
illegal question
excuse me take that back
and therefore perfect
Shes my daughter
nothing is perfect except for Hibiki Tachibana from Symphogear
something something apple
but it could also suck major ass
it could be awesome as hell
im interested in airgetlams amalgam
i think i know what you mean now
ah
lmao
and i dont remember
i watched that episode yesterday
i dont quite remember what you mean
uh give me another hint
~~weak reference, try again~~
~~and both snake and hand wear pretty weak without the regeneration~~
not sure if there was any more than that
then again, I only remember the snake and the hand
idk I was pretty sure it could just yeet gods as Im pretty sure every time bikki punched a godly entity it was just yeeted
maybe its connected to hibiki being free of the original sin then
or something like that
i thought gungnir was specifically researched in germany as a god killer weapon
i dont really get hangovers, I just feel weak for the rest of the day
wait how did we go from symphogear to this
but I dont miss the hangovers
I kinda miss drinking
never tried fritz cola
but Id never do it because I want to actually drink it
like I might drink a can and say "haha lol look I drank pepsi haha what a fucking meme"
I can not possibly comprehend how anyone can unironically drink pepsi
i feel this on an emotional level
that pepsi image
But I doubt thats ever gonna happen
Id enjoy a new series with new characters
mark my words
i am going to swallow your soul kerrik
because of how people use cancer as "this bad"
wasnt sure if that was intentional
"stupid cancer orb" is very fitting cause sunrays cause skin cancer lol
its probably just gibberish
Ah
And isnt it late for you?
Isnt tea like brunch?
My brain is in dumb bitch mode
Wait does that make sense
I assume?
British?
~~by that I mean symphogear saturday~~
tomorrow is international day of the moon
its so good
<:CarolTheFuck:617036187319795722>
somehow that makes vanessa even more attractive
certainly a hot take
~~hope im not mixing stuff up~~
would also explain fine
maybe its like in egypt where gods get reborn into mortal bodies
gungnir isnt old enough right?
I think gods in most cultures arent really omnipotent
dess
Yeah they usually start the climax in 12 and resolve everything 13
Next week is already climax time right?
Wait
Lmao
wait isnt that the plot of madoka?
Cant believe they are mining bitcoins on human DNA
I would never forgive them
I refuse
No
I need to rewatch the season
O
I kinda forgot about them
Where is carolnein rn?
Tho Id like to see carol do some stuff
Maybe carol is just trying to get the submarine out of the danger zone
thats what i was referring to
well yeah ok
or am i remembering that wrong
didnt she have a short fight?
pick axe
pickaxe is usefull in many situations
like when you walk into a drug store and you dont know what deodorant to get
zenbu zenbu zenbu
i feel stupid for not realizing the connection between apple and the symphogear plot
episode 13 is just a bunch of concerts
:D
hello
barty
nah
hello new person i have totally never seen before
the symbolism in G
holy shit
an apple a day keeps the doctor away
apple stops the doctor
plot hole
hibiki is a goddess
she might have murdered a lot of people but how can you not forgive those eyes
I love her
Disneys Hercules Hades-Hibiki
<:TsubasaPeek:623246193002151938>
sorry not my fault people forgot the meaning of thicc
they are both skin and bones
neither of them are thicc
where people forget how fucked up a character is just because "uwu cute"
elsa is a victim of what I call "the doppio phenomenon"
i doubt that
:c
never undermine kanade on my watch
cause that was big kanade sacrifice
i dont like how you said the rock thing
yeah
but thats a different discussion üëÄ
aaah brings me back to naruto completely driving its theme of "overcoming destiny" into a wreckage
^
^
id much rather have a logical explanation like "fusion between human and relic" or "free from the curse" than "shes a demi god"
i dont see how that would have been cool
shes just been free of the curse
ima steal this meme kerrik
that felt like an artistic choice lol
I think fanservice doesnt really fit because the chant has the same effect as a leitmotif
sorry?
fanservice is an ugly word for a really good and impactful stylistic choice
Because
1. The audience associates the chant with battle miku
There is an easy explanation why she would transform with a chant
the second one in particular
that was what i was looking for
thank you
why are you even on this server if you only talk shit
wow thanks for always giving the best output armados
wasnt the robe
that the gear in the end
hes trying to tell me
he knows that
can someone help me out? someone is trying to tell me that the SSJ gear in G survived and was used in VX ep 13 and I need a source that disproves it
and carol probably had all the other information about gears from elfneins memories
carol is pretty genius id say
elfnein also said something about "we made it in time"
was a trick to produce gears
maybe that thing carol whispered into elfneins ear as she passed
so after discussing a bit with my friend
I am very good at writing look at all these words I am writing right fucking now kerrik
symphogear but its the end of digimon 02 where everyone suddenly has gear and people celebrate the first gear on the moon
oh god
god why is symphogear lore so complicated
I was just posting a theory
I do not disagree with that
it was wasted potential
probably because: we wont know what will happen until it happens
the last 3 times you said the exact opposite of this
sad
I love this
thats my daughter
I feel like GX would really benefit from being a movie
well maybe a recap movie
I wouldnt expect a movie tbh
was no mikugear in axz
there
but oh boy the last few episodes were way better than I expected
I took a break in the middle of AXZ first airing because it wasnt really that interesting and I wanted to binge it once it finished
you should try finding a new hyperfixation
Cant wait for hibimikus marriage in the shinai

Ah
I thought kaneko had the story planned out since G
<:TsubasaSmug:585839805737467920>
Yeh
Your punishment is your fault
its really hard for me to watch something if there aint any cliff hangers
and XV too
So yeah G is really high for me
like I really love cliff hangers
Im a bitch for cliff hangers
but i dont wnat it to get in the way of happiness because thats not the purpose of entertainment
of course reading criticism is fine
talking about geah
I just wanna have fun with my friends
tbf i generally try to avoid bringing up stuff that could result in unnecessary fights
yeah I try to avoid the warzones in fandoms
so it was directed at people on this server
also it was directed at anyone who gets upset about your comments
o
it doesnt really belong here, I apologize to the people who actually wanna use this channel for useful conversation
I should probably stop before it derails
nothing wrong with negative criticism but if its the only thing you can do I really dont see the point
all you do is get people annoyed.
maybe you should try talking in a fandom about a series you actually care about.
it weirds me out why someone would join a server about a series only to talk shit about it
sorry if Im being overly mean but oh boy
I know Im going off at a small thing rn but it bottled up over time
in fact you make me use this channel a lot less so theres that
I have the urge to reply to 90% of the things you say with "Ok Kaiba avi"
it sounds weird but cliff hangers make any story better for me
"wow that was a great episode" *stops watching for a month*
but what about x drive amalgam hibiki vs that farmer dude from episode 1 of dragon ball z?
Its generation next because FIS is the next generation ü§î

When's XV episode 14 coming?
I checked the pin and found nothing and was too lazy to scroll up *dab*
yes
happy birthday basa
half a sword
nice
Sry for the late reply, lost connection in the subway
But it completely fails conveying that message
I think what shield hero is trying to do is showing how perspective matters a lot
No interest in it
Feels like the episodes are either good or terrible and its doesnt know what messages it wants to send
I really dont know what to think of shield hero
I always knew that I hate having a male body
The human mind is just weird
Earlier this morning or yesterday
And I think I had a wake up moment
Because I never knew if Im just fluid or confused
Im so unsure
Nah I just
Feels weird
I think I just came out as a transgirl in front of friends for the first time
The Nagisa and Honoka thing was on german television back in the days
It has multiple series right?
It ran on tv
When I was like 8 or smth precure made me tell my mom that I wanna be a girl lmao
Yeah pretty much that
I wanna say something about the impact precure had on me but its gonna sound weird
I loved it soooo much
Only the one thing that got a german dub when I was a child
Unless its wholesome
I cant enjoy most things nowadays
It really did
<@99695384296701952> youre so right
good luck
o
^
but maybe they really just did it for the pun to tell people to come to their hotel for naughty fun
i guess so
which is weird because our reigning party literally has "christian" in their name
yeh I think our "system" is really accepting in that regard
i recently noticed that
our state IDs dont even have gender options
LMAO
it was really just a pun to tell people "come do naughty things in our hotel"?
now I get it
wow
oooooh
oh
apparently it was an ad campaign for a hotel
im confused
all i know is that they seperated men and women for that
hard to tell from the wording my friend used
different i think
or if they really just wanted to promote a "political" agenda
if it was just a bad attempt at making a pun
i just wonder if there was some context
basically
and unisex
university sex
"besser uni-sex als unisex"
~~the same thing but in german~~
or was it really just for the pun
i really have no clue why tf they would pull this bag thing. like did they wanna send a message?
like when ferero released kinder eggs for girls, the public outrage was huge
usually that stuff gets shitstorms over here
^
oof
why
???
they gave away bags at my friends university.
men and women got different bags and they had the words "uni-sex is better than unisex" or something along those lines written on them
wtf did I just read
I dont even know what their stance on that stuff is
Yeh I think Im gonna spend the next few years figuring out how to tell my christian parents that Im not a guy
üíú
I might wanna check it out
cya
they dont deserve you if they want to be like that
:(
because Ive been doing research occasionally for years (when my dysphoria gets too bad) and I never really found drawbacks on the sites I visited. I only know they are there, but I dont know what they are
I really wonder about the drawbacks
i tried to give him a lot of chances to better himself, at this point most of his friends just left him
or if they havent transitioned yet
who would intentionally misgender people if he doesnt like them
one of my former friends was a guy like that
i only come out to people i know i can trust
i mean, thats what im doing rightnow basically
:(
haha funny
or making jokes about my nails
huh
as if pink shirts where an indication of gender or anything
my family started making jokes when i bought pink shirts
the emotional step alone is really hard sometimes, especially when you have to interact with certain people
^yes
but even if, its still a big step
i can imagine that a lot of people dont, if health insurance doesnt cover it
stay safe <3
me3
oh
is it really too much work for some people to pull a plastic back over a dick?
oof
i cant imagine what would happen if stuff happened to me
i completely freak out when my friends are sick
yesss
the main problem of religion is people using it to gain power
tho i dont know how good deterministic really fits
I think agnostic and deterministic describe my views well
agnostic gang
but i dont know how accurate that is
and is just a collection of texts the vatican chose
we learned in school that for example the bible was written by completely uninvolved people about 100 years later
yeh
i feel like most people only follow the rules they want to anyway
i mean, manipulation happened throughout history. can religion really be sure that their holy texts are even accurate?
but i dont know if thats too... radical?
I low key want to tell these people that god didnt write the bible
your family should accept you for who you are
no you arent
people are complex creatures
:/
I cant really blame them if they dont accept me because its just the conditions they grew up with
My grandparents are very supportive and support me a lot with money and stuff but they are also christian and i dont know how they would take it and I dont want to hurt them
hioehngv
but my father and brothers also exist so
but I dont know why I didnt pull through, probably because I was shy and scared
because my mother actually explained me how transitioning works when I was a kid and told her I want to be a girl
I kind of have hopes
Never thought about that
Oh the second point is good
people just really enjoy abusing power
~~for money~~
~~i mean they basically used to sell paper that magically frees you of your sin~~
the vatican is known for manipulating people throughout history
that library probably dates back to a time when crusades were a thing
i mean
I mean in the end noone knows
Maybe
I guess
Noone really knows
Only the pope has access
Yeah there are also a lot of texts kept secret by the vatican
no problem
time to hide from all the problems in this world and listen to savage garden
aaah my headphones are here
I hope its really just the area i live in
~~I wore make up in public once and was immediately called out for it by random teenagers~~
I feel you
quality server
**good**
terfs suck
:/
O
Lmao
Im sfw
Pls dont censor me
F
They probably do
üëÄ
Because honestly US-conservatives sound more like NPCs
Sadly
I drank iced coffee once but that was ages ago
It has a temperature that makes it barely drinkable
Oh thats cool
Confession:
Before I go to bed I make coffee and drink it when I wake up
If censorship is so bad why do they sell so well?
Subway time. Rip internet connection
Probably
When a conversation in a dating app starts like this? Its a bit uhm... idk Id be scared
Yeah its kind of a red light
Weird
Is it so hard to understand?
Your experiences arent universal
Gamer oppression :(
Everyone I knew bought PS3 for blu rays...
^
Basically
The ps3 was a multimedia station
I knew a ton of people who bought the ps3 specifically for blu rays
Lol
But its ezier to just blame the people you disagree with ü§ô
Honestly this is the first time I hear someone talk about how "the ps3 failed"
üôè
you cant fail, you can only succeed at learning
:'D
nah I mean literally 0s and 1s
lmao
oh

maybe just not my kind of humor?
rn im just trying to figure out whats funny about hiding a question behind a code
Learning on a train or something
Like combining tasks
The best way for me is to be efficient, i think
Its just an endless cycle
When I set "punishment exercises" i just end up skipping them too and then i get even more frustrated
Probably some psychological bullshit
It shouldnt be that
Idk, the topics are interesting
That I struggle to get over
Like... Im smart enough to learn shit fast, but I just have a huge barrier in my brain
The hardest thing is getting started for me
Its more like all the other stuff is invading my school experience
*everything*
I just have other things in mind that keep me from engaging withouz forcing myself
Nah, Im not bad at the other stuff
<:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
And because I genuinely enjoyed it
Yes??
Amazing
Ikr?
<:MariaSunglasses:336656798687690752>
Fun words
But
I miss the design class from the first semester. Was some welcome change of pace in between all the math stuff üí§
We also started talking about while-, loop- and goto-programms, thats when my brain woke up a bit
NP problems
I just looked at the script
Yay
More work at home
And my brain went afk
Uh it was just very basic
Calculatability
We were talking about turing machines today, but I couldnt get my brain to focus
Yeah I feel that
Brain refusing to study?
Like how can someone be homophobic and also genuinely think of themselves as a good person
Also:
Nah I really dont get the appeal of homophobia
I only really started being active 2 days ago
Ive been here for a while but I havent really used it much
:/
I will never understand this
:(
lmao
I sometimes forget that image preview exists

I wanna read that but my brain says **pain**
~~apparently he also went to prison for tax fraud~~
he behaved pretty much exactly as one would think. racist, homophobic, transphobic, lazy, and overall acting like a dick towards everyone
~~the family of my ex-boss was rich as fuck and had their money for such a long time, they didnt even know where their wealth originated from~~
good luck
im with you i think
money is basically just an extrastep for trade culture from way back in the days
it really is
meme is short for:
me  - cool
me - person
*hands saki a coin*
you have to throw in a coin first
what the hell does that even mean lmao
*here have some 1s and 0s from my bank account, send me manga!*
we can just call anything money and as long as everyone believes that its worth something, it is
money is an illusion anyway
But i kinda doubt that
Apparently my voice is feminine enough for people to tell me that its hard to make out my sex in vc
Haha
Or "no bullying"
Because children didnt like the rule of "no memespam outside of the meme channel"
The place is completely different now
Half the people just got banned or left
An actual revolution
There was like
On another server Im on
Know that feel
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Also if anything I say makes anyone uncomfy please call me out
Dont talk about things that make you uncomfortableüôè
Screw your uncle I guess...
Not everyone is blessed with a healthy amount of empathy i guess
:(
Its beyond me
I dont know how reasonable that is but
Imagine going to a psychologist and they tell you "no you dont exist"
God thats something Im not looking forward to
So much history :0
Hihi
Ngl
I already feel a lot more comfortable now that Im on this server with so many great peeps
üê£
I really am
qwq
No yall
Lmao
I legit got catcalled back in puberty
I mean it did drop, but i really didnt notice
Is that weird?
I didnt even notice my voice drop
The kid that was too afraid of actually sticking with their plan
Preferably my pre puberty self
Yeah same
üíú
So dont let it get to you if they are mean
11-13 means theyre probably just repeating what their parents tell them
:)
H√§lp
And I was like
Like ive tried to poke out once and people thought it was a joke
I cant believe how long it took me to break out of my shell
<:MikuGay:336656810788388864>
I have ever read
Is the most relatable thing
The little happy buzz
I dunno if that even works
In advance
Maybe searching for a psychologist with a good rep helps?
Oh
Hjjdbkmu
:0
Maybe Ill post cos pics soon
Im not comfy with sharing images im sorry
I probably emmit heavy bottom energy
üíú
Im sorry I didnt mean it that way
Yesss
:D
I joined for symphogear but what I got was  cool transpeople
D√∂rty
Im in this image
Yess

Im shaving daily because I cant look in the mirror
Wait does it actually regrow hair?

I got a lot of hair, but I need it

I have pretty mediocre skill in every stat
I just had bad experiences with wordings like that
Me too
No problem
0 social skills? I feel you

Weird to point that out
I dont think acting like a dick is in any way connected to that
Yes

I thought it obly prevents it from falling out
Activity <:HibikiShock:336656371611074580>
Im really disappointed
Aye
I mean there isnt much actual proof outside of the snapchat stuff, but it really doesnt look good for him
Aye
But apparently he cheated on his wife, abused her and did questionable stuff on snapchat.
I liked his content
If you like projared, its worth caring about
Kinda
Oof
I got 2 more hours of sleep somehow and woke up to big yt drama
Its gonna be uncomfortably loud for the next 1-2 hours
But i conveniently just woke up at the time my family will head out
I wish
Oof
I dont have classes today.
Why did my body force me to wake up after 5 hours of sleep...
Classic... :/
Sleep well
:(
üíú
Nah, charisma sounds too nice lmao
But apparently my "people like me for no reason stat" is maxed out
Theres lots of personal shit going on that doesnt get public attention
Behind the scenes it gets worse
Crazy how fast things can take a turn
Back then
Jontron lost a ton of subs too I think
Thats crazy
Hes about to drip below 1 million
Wow
Good
"I give this game a broken marriage out of 10"
His old tweets and jokes really didnt age well
Lmao
In a weird way
They were pretty funny
Ive seen some people post out of context clips
Oh wow
Yes
I mean
I just dont like it that a lot of people seem to care more about the really old drama
Some people are pointing out the hypocrisy of normal boots (which is alright i guess) but others are straight up spamming "jon tron did nothing wrong"
Aye
*way to shift attention away from the actual problem*
And now my timeline is full of people defending jontron instead of talking about the recent thing
Sad
Nah it wasnt their fault in that particular case
somebody already sent me more jared skin than I ever wanted to see
im just trying to dodge the nudes rn
Yes
Hoomans are weird
Aye
And the fact that the girl he chested with replied
Aye
Hmh
^^^
And just before his wife tweeted out the stuff, he made a very unpersonal defensive tweet
Even those uninvolved
Also he blocked all of his wifes friends
Nsfw snapchat pics
Someone send me a tweet with uhm
People really out here defending him, when all the evidence points against him
I enjoyed his content... but now? Yikes
Aye...
^^^^^^
Oh thats cool
I love proZD
Or what was that headline again? <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
"Vocal anime youtuber somehow the least toxic anime fan"
LMAO
Nah im a twitter addict
Ive only seen underpants posing
Oof
Ive been on twitter all day, no clue how I still havent seen one
Hes taking it better than expected
Alright
"Im partying hard"
I am confused
He replied with cute
Welp I dropped the bomb in whats app
But the chances are good
Hes doing cancer treatment rn
I dunno some beta ray shit
Should I just tell him via whatsapp?
I didnt even know that was a thing
Weird
Which is why I cant visit him
I wanted to visit a friend because I wanted to come out in a safe zone but I cant because he had to take radio active meds and therefor radiates shit to people around him
Wow
Online drama <:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
Well Im not really engaging with that anymore, but when I was more engaged with them theres been some stuff going on
I know a few people in the german poketubing scene. Feels like drama every week
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Id like to cut all toxicity out of my life
It is
I guess if its uncertain
No idea
I hope it sounds worse than it is...
Oof
So after the advisor stuff you get this document and then the judges either say yay or nay.
And if nay, you will have to wait 3 years
I found it now
I hope the law isnt as bad as it looks
As far as i know
Because health insurance covers the transitioning costs
I think thats not really that negative of a change compared to before. I think before that psychiatrists had to make that decision anyway
Apparently
Anyway, you wont have to consult a psychiatrist initially anymore
But I dont know if a judge could say "fuck that document"
They talk to you for 4 hours and then hand you a document that says that youre indeed trans
But apparently there are now special advisors for this stuff
Or how much power the judges really have
So i couldnt find the 3 year thing yet
Gimme a while
Oh I havent read rhe document yet
Wtf did I just read...
Preach
Universal base income is my jam
Capitalism ew
My fallback plan for now is fleeing to my friends flst
And wait till im healthy again
Maybe I just need to calm dowm
But Im really scared
Maybe you are right
You think that would make it worse?
I already know that my mom would have supported me before puberty
And if all goes to shit Im sure my friend will take care of me
Because im a scared shy baby
I might just go to a friends house and send her a text message about that
I think my mom will support me no matter what
End boss parents. No idea when Ill manage to gather the courage
Yayy
All of my friends know about it now.
So far noone has abandoned me
I dont read much at home, but on trains im a lot more focussed for some reason
Idk why
I just really like to read on trains
I hate being touched <:ElfneinBullying:421432763078410241>
Thats the only thing i hate about public transit
People like to get touchy
Im using public transit a lot
Oh
Specify dirty people
Maybe its a factor idk
Well its been half a years since the last time, im honestly surprised it took so long this time
Im getting sick every few months
Good night
Mood
Me too
They really are
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
Also: remember how I went grocery shopping saki? It started raining and Ive caught a cold
Yes
Aye me too
The 3 year thing
Its somewhere in the red text
We dont harm anyone
Yay
I just skimmed over it cause I woke up with a headache
It stresses me out more than it should
Oof
Imagine breaking out of your shell and 2 days later germany said "ayyyyyy lmao"
The 3 year waiting shit is bullcrap either way
Its really vague from what I can tell
But like... does the document make it certain?
~~i dont like it when people attack his looks honestly~~
yeh
thats what im thinking
at least ive heard child predator controversy a lot recently
i feel like it most often happens with gaming youtubers especially in the nintendo/pokemon community
i dont know
crazy how many youtubers turn out to be child predators
jail time ü¶Ä
but nice that hell face consquences
not nice
i mean
nice
fr?
OI
oi
*yote
did he get yeeted somewhere?
what do you mean by "going away"
You better get well soon or I will have to give you a hug <@127644949884698624> <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
Yeah same
Yep

The cartoon
And Im not joking when I say he reviews arthur games
Nintendo and Arthur games mostly
Games
For anyone who was disappointed with PBGs reaction
This is probably worth seeing

I wish you all the best
Sounds recent
Yeah thats what Im afraid off
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720> noms
Noms money owners
Consume the upper class
üí∏ üî´
Id assume
Money changed him
Oof
Has that been public knowledge since then?
When I saw his posts recently it really freaked me out
And not the good kind
Character development
Woah
Wait
Oh
What did they do? :0
I forgot that Miku made minecraft
Youre right
Is it bad that I feel uncomfortable playing minecraft after the stuff notch tweeted a while ago?
oh jeez
he might not have said "against his will" but I mean... thats granted when a guy says he wants to have sex with a straight man I guess
at least thats wgat my low effort research could find out
he promoted a rival company of one of his friends and said "id like to fuck a straight dude against his will" or something like that
I think it was about james charles
oof


everybody is different ^^
thats the beauty of humanity
subverting expectations
yeah thats the goal the joke was aiming for
he hit it from top to bottom
no
Yeh I dont like that mentality
sadly i didnt come up with that joke
but i aint doing research for a mediocre joke lol
probably
and now hes at 900k
he recently passed 1 million subs
on the same channel
the only ever youtuber to hit 1 million twice
Fuck that was hard
I LOVE HER SO MUCH IM CRYING
I LOVE YOU MOM
"You can talk to me about anything!"
Shes being supportive
I think
For context
Im 21 btw
The fuck kinda question is that
What
Lol
"Thats a bit late isnt it?"
Kc√∂uxul
She doesnt answer
Im scared
Fuck
This moment
Just told my mom
I
üíú
Giving birth to one of the people that helped me publicly out myself
Your mom did at least 1 good thing
Also your mom is a poopoo human :((
Im so happy
People are finally able to figure me out
Its incredible how everything comes together
This made me laugh way too hard
Friend: wait I thought you dont care about how you look
Me: yeah, its almost like I dont want to wear fancy men clothing
Friend: OH MY GOD IT ALL MAKES SENSE NOW
Perfect
Accept hug
End me rn
End me
The lecture wasnt even relevant for the exam
Because Ive been sick over the weekend
I think hes calculating an excercise I didnt do yet
Sneaking in then
More like
Lol
The class is algorithms
Trying to figured the topic out rn
I have no clue since he just jumped in at a random point without a word
Oof
And he still makes me fall asleep with the way he teaches
Im drugged to my toes on coffee
Can my prof be any more boring?
Chi-Ring
Good luck!
Because they look cool
Cool group shots happen all the time in movies
Also pretty sure there were at least a few
Lol
I mean in the MCU in general
How many panshots of the male avengers did we get? 200?
People got super pissed online about 1 panshot of the female avengers in endgame
Its funny how they act like the minorities are always "triggered" when they act like absolute poopoo heads about any slight inconvenience
But its really good
I watched half of the video because I dont have time
:/
im getting kinda sick. i regularly have to hear shit about america fucking my friends over
its insane
oh yeah ive seen that today
tldr eat the rich
because as you can tell by looking at france for example, as soon as you drain money from rich people, they will just leave
but its most likely pretty low
theres probably a tax on it
even tho its not even directed at them
problem is, every time the heirloom tax is mentioned, poor people will feel like its just there to steal money from their children
id be fine if there was at least a high tax on it
i blocked him everywhere, but screenshots of his posts sometimes plop up on my timeline
oh well
oh did I mention he inherited a fortune?
and that only the best people manage to be on top of the capitalistic food chain
he is also a strong believer that capitalism regulates itself
I mean
Do you ever just regret having helped your friends?
nowadays he thanks me by spreading transphobic bullshit on social media
when his life slowly fell apart
I used to help this dude with his depression a lot
aaah
why do i let people get under my skin
im getting baited by a former friend again
Everyones been supportive
Almost my entire fam knows now
Thank yall
^^^^this!
I was an egg
Because
Gkkuedcj
Im almost 22 but Im finally a living human being
Im alive
<:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
Omg
I literally couldnt survive wothout their shelter
Im so lucky rn omg


to keep you watching
or generally stuff that supports your believes
your recommended section will be filled with only right wing stuff
for example when you like watching right wing youtube
i like to call it "the algorithm bubble"
my theory is they saw a few vids about matt mcgorry or some shit
crazy how hateful some people are
LMAO
1 of the staff members is gender fluid
he just fucked himself
"its worse when some dudes are self proclaimed gender fluids"
some dude just said
for some reason he called me queen
queen as in me
oh not the queen
not like 95% of the active members are men and im friends with most of them ü§î

let me dig up another great quote
^
im getting tired of algorithm politics bubbles
youre so right
oh i didnt even think of that
they absolutely do
top 10 reasons why im feeling a lot more comfortable on this server atm
meanwhile on the jojo side of discord
Existing is political
If they cared about childen they would stop selling unhealthy garbage
The fuck
What
we really do
does america acknowledge enby?
not really well informed about your system
in america only rich people can really get into politics right?
for no reason
instead they are constantly fucking them over
parents should want the best for their children
^
oof
by that logic nothing should ever positively change
"it would be unfair to remove student loan, because those who already paid are at a disadvantage"
oh jeez have you heard of that student loan argument some people make
a video got leaked (i think yesterday)
they elected a pretty far right leader a while ago, and turns out he talked to some russian donor about shutting down the press and getting illegal bribes and shit
austria is having a huge controversy rn
^
they dont really get a voice, but they are still there
and the overall participation during the elections is rather low
there are some very questionable people in the parliament because they dont need that many votes
im not exaggerating tho
there are actual neo nazis and monarchy supporters in the EU parliament
lol

This story upsets me
https://twitter.com/JefferyWard5/status/1129091416867647488?s=19
its weird
its a ban with extra steps
usually these people leave after their opinions get shut down like that a few time
the mods told them to STFU and now its over
i dont
unless they really wont ever stfu
idk the mods dont really ban people
at this point its just funny LMAO
rip
tfw the mods just want my coochie
the responses are great
the mods came in to back me up
sadly those who are responsible for the crashes arent aware
fleeing from a war zone or stuff like that is different from fleeing a bad economy
its crazy how even brexit supporters slowly start to realize they messed up with their vote
after that the laws got a bit more strict i think
just to raise awareness
they literally sold money
a small german party actually did a huge troll campaign to make lobbying less easy
^
yeh
then obviously they are gonna represent the upperclass more than anything
if rich people ARE the politicians
thats what i was on about
aye
why help the bottom class. can they donate millions of dollars to you?
but they refuse to because money
governments can do lots of smaller things to keep the upperclass in check
capitalism would be as bad if socialism balanced it out more
europe is also experiencing a growth in right wing bullshit
i feel like a lot of people idolize the rich too much
sad thing is a far right party got 15% of the votes last time :^)
our 2 strongest parties are both getting weaker and weaker with each election
Ive heard you have to fund all your campaigns yourself or something
REKT
execpt for his name in the credits
lmao apparently every trace of notch was removed from minecraft
Oh yeah people arguing like "its bad cause its illegal" exist sadly
Why did someone send this to me
Oh thats from 2018
It seriously pisses me off
There no logic behind it, only harm
The only thing this law does is fuck children and those who want to raise them
Its so fucking stupid
Is the trump government trying to go down with a bang?
Wtf is happening in the US

i just hope its temporary
uhm what
"but you mostly had black clothes as a kid, how can you be transgender"
or ask really awkward questions
they basically treat me as if i have a mental illness at the moment
but im not
i should be used to it by now
they dont really pay attention to how i take stuff they say or do
they are just sloppy as hell
"at least we finally know whats wrong with you" why would they say that eiohgnoie
i appreciate that my parents didnt execute me but holy shit are their comments rude
aye
i mean we could but we chose not to
but we can learn and grow from mistakes
i wish people would work on perfecting the system instead of inherently antagonizing it tho
~~and the obvious other stuff like getting shot crossing the border etc~~
you had to wait ages for cars and shit
dont know much about what happened in russia but i do know that communism didnt really work out in germany because the system was pretty flawed

I just wanna take titty meds in peace

Ilu all
And its freaking me out
Its not about me Ive just been overhearing things
Anything really
üíú
I just need some positivity
Give me good emotions please
because existing is very sexual
they dont want sexual content on childrens TV
Jeez
ich kann nicht atem
i cant breath
held hostage by milk shakes
the queues are all like a fucking year or something
its impossible to find a psychiatrist in germany
jesus fucking christ
nihilism intensifies
lol
*bam*
abortion is a favor because the fetus instantly goes to heaven because fetuses cant be bad people
thats ||fucking|| amazing
excuse the strong language
i gotta remember that
thats  a good quote
and execute potentially innocent people on poor evidence
"but it has a heartbeat" - yes, just like the meat you eat
"what if baby cures cancer?" - what if baby grows up into a criminal that kills the person who would cure cancer. what if mommy would have cured cancer.
most "pro life" arguments make no sense anyway
it really grinds my gears
why do people feel satisfaction from screwing others over
^
I cant take shit like this
fuck that was painful to read
it is the truth you have just spoken
thank you
or that
angry christian soccer moms fits better
i dont even wanna call these people pro life
ooooof
and its only becoming bigger
the gap between rich and poor has become ridiculously huge
^
towards everyone
if the system was actually fair
but you dont need a debuff protection
it is
"look im rich"
other than
there is no reason
why does a single person need 5 yachts and 3 private jets?
"look im better than you because my bank account has a higher number"
not because it has actual benefit
they want more to get a higher rank
the biggest joke is that a lot of rich people see money the same way gamers see elo and MMR
to fuel their own riches
they just want them to live and function
the rich dont want the poor to be mentally healthy
And Im not sure if they are delusional or really just wanna push people down as much as possible
Im sick of rich people telling poor people that their life is actually good

The ticket dude stared at my phone
Oof
Impolite shithead
And some train control guy just read that message
I used non binary as an excuse for a year not to out myself because Im stupid
I just needed people to encourage me
I have realized it alone
Some people dont change. Some do
And I believe I have changed
Ive done very stupid shit not even that long ago
People can change when done right
But at the same time I excuse their behaviour in my head
I dont wanna interact with bad people and am sad and angry because of them
Like... I excuse way too much behaviour of other people
Im way too deterministic honestly
We have nothing in germany
Democrazyyyy
Yay
to only see posts that make me happy
im always considering building myself a bubble
and yeah twitter is horrible
yikes
can we like... not take yandere as role models?
i always end up in really stupid arguments
twitter stresses me out so much
god
üëè üëè üëè

I doubt it tho, there are way too many old people in this country

"Cabaret artist Nico Semsrott will probably move into the European Parliament. His party TheParty (die partei) calls: driving license deprivation for climate change deniers and a maximum subsistence level of one million euros."
the base concept is there, but the execution is yikes
it is
like... what
like people who never voted in the EU complain
people dont give a shit about the EU, they just want something to blame
so
well germans argue with "weed is illegal because its illegal"
because of their constant bullshit
they actually got completely rekt by the green party in this years EU elections
but they dont get nothing going and they dont really have much of an excuse
our big socialist party is just blaming everything on the big conservative party
its pretty similar to a local situation here
yeh
thats only a 2% increase compared to last elections. Im actually surprised
our "i hate the EU" party got 10%
and there are many people who have build their life on EU trades
ireland exists
the problem is
^
but i feel uncomfortable
sorry its stupid since i started it
abuse ruined my friends life
because it triggers me
i dont wanna have this discussion again
i have 2 brothers
because they look up to their parents
kids tend to adapt it
when you use physical violence
the thing is
I was raised with patience
yes
thankfully so
my mom took them
~~and I wish parents would take them seriously~~
yeah same
"my child misbehaved so im getting the belt"
beating your children
???
Who disagree
By offended parents
And he gets replies like
And he brings up studies
My friend studies psychology
Legit
the amount of people supporting child abuse is getting me so mad rn
"oh look this 1 kid is a bit out of control in this video and the parent is acting maturely, this is why you should abuse children when they misbehave"
people on there really be like
im logging off twitter
god
thats the downside one has to accept
your information is gonna be public
if you have a public life
america has been suppressing atoms for too long
free the atoms
every nation has black sheeps
its easier to control the public if the public thinks you are the best
basically
its all about "we are the best"
its because the american government doesnt care about historical accuracy
its like something american dad would do
freedom molecules are the reason american stereotypes exist
depending on where they live and what they rely on
hermits are probably even more doomed
its like humanity has been doomed from the start
Ill never understand why people wanna see the world burn so badly
LMAO
that image
is that satire?
~~a good friend of mine also does aircraft maintenance I think~~

oh nvm then
I just assume everyone here is older than me honestly
I have no clue how old anyone here is
<3
take that as a compliment
I

and way more extreme than just "you cant play playstation for a day"
but that was in my teens

jesus christ why are people like this
and now hes playing the victim card and backpedals
then people got upset about it
one of my friends posted some disgusting shit about the LGBT
jeez
^
the kind of support that makes you earn money
"we support the LGBT by making our logo rainbowish but we wont actually do anything LOL"
and its usually either during pride month or black history month that they do show it
and as I said, I like it when I can sort people out for their shitty behavior
I honestly just enjoy all the memes on june 1st
yeah the monetization is ass
makes it easier for me to cut people out of my circle of friends
people publicly tweet out how its ok to be transphobic because its just an opinion
people show their true colors
you know the best thing about pride month?
greato daze
Yay
amen
if someone wants to scream some disgusting shit in public, everyone has the right to tell them to fuck off
otherwise freedom of speech wouldnt be freedom of speech
every opinion is subject to criticism
should stop using it
I know its a psychological term
yeah sorry I slipped
its really easy to upset people who throw around the word snowflake
^
there are just so many logical flaws within that statement alone
i love it when people publicly tweet out "every opinion is valid and you shouldnt criticize it" stuff and then get mad when you criticize them
lol
the dude that publicly tweeted out bullshit is now mad at me because I didnt DM him instead of replying on his public post
It all comes down to capitalistic bullshit
I mean
it just sounds like something a company would do
tho I dont know if thats a fact
Ive heard new android versions will slow down older phones to make you think they arent good enough
I feel like since its not really required to upgrade your phone anymore, they just try to artificially make you buy more
:(
rip
now i gotta pay another 10 euros to get a stupid sd slot
been running it on the bare limit for ages
just bought a micro SD only to find out that I cant use it
cant be bothered with implementing mandatory stuff
32 GB full? great! now buy a new phone
were they too greedy to give you the option to increase the space?
why the hell does the S6 not have an SD slot
Chhhh
Saw that comment today, thought it was funny
It would shit on homophobia and ruin corporate pride :^)
Twitter should make a rainbow filter for next pridemonth to make every pfp gay
since the meme is quite popular
I hope they get a shit storm for that
twitter likes to go out of their way to defend racist and transphobic people
I dont think they will get in any trouble
twitter is pulling this shit regularly
why am i using this website again

freedom of speech also means that people dont have to give you a platform
yep
what melua said
im trash
for some reason loss memes still get me lol
but most memes are just the image youve seen a million times with a different caption
or that genuinelyhave a good punchline
I like memes that actually criticize real issues or are self aware enough to make fun of meme culture
yeh
low key missing the trebuchet memes now lol
Merkel? 
-boring
-shitty decisions
-doesnt actually do much

Trebuchet:

*changing the way they handle politics? nah*
*becoming funny memer? hell yeah*
our reigning party is very very unpopular with the young generations because their politics sucks ass.
how do they react?
"our social media game isnt strong enough. we need to be cooler for the young voters"
dont be ridiculous
doing something worth while?
I can imagine that some of them actually seek out well known memers to run their social media pages
amen

oh

it only exists because people didnt really have any other easy option

"yes"
"because it sounds like someone made that name up"
"all names are made up"

GOOD
Oof
what i mean is that radical means "far away from the middle"
<@284390402210136064> i worded that badly
the middleground decides what is radical and what isnt
theres a difference between radical feminists and feminists tho
couple of my friends are feminists
uh
terfs hate men, terfs hate transfolks, terfs hate straight women, terfs hate anyone who doesnt agree with them
actually terfs should hate terfs
honestly anyone who isnt a terf should hate terfs
how the fuck is being trans "escaping oppression"
wtf
like
they think they try to "escape from oppression"
i learned something
thats what ive been doing my whole life üòé
yep
i dont like it when people call femboys egg
I recently got gendered correctly by a total idiot
hooray for gender neutral pronouns
I usually just go by they until i know better
I just take that as validation
my grandma always thinks i am my mother
i mean
felix is trans
all I know is that people should stop calling me that
dont know about its origin
might be
and a lot of people feel very uncomfy when hearing that word
a lot of people still use it as a slur
the thing is
especially after one of my "friends" told me something along the lines of "our friendship is different now, because you might be a cute **** one day"
oh I started to fucking hate that word

i didnt know that
we dont do these jokes here
can we rebrand transphobia and homophobia to gaycism?
*dab*
and also said "uh trans people are so sensitive, if they have a dick they are a man"
Im so sensitive, I modded his chat for a year and didnt say a word
and he kept making jokes like this every day
for some reason I was friends with a transphobic streamer for years
oh talking about helicopters
because I was a very confused egg
I identified as genderfluid for about a year
oh how the tables have turned
there was a point in my life where I wasnt either
some dude in my old school told our teacher that "he doesnt wanna share a room with the gay kid because he is scared of getting ****"
if someone asks me I will answer "why is that important"
I dont even pretend to be a boy anymore usually
Im wearing my backpack like a purse
I want a cute purse
**o_o**
im trying to leave the house, but serious disc is so active rn
you catch my drift?
because people gave them one
but that doesnt mean they have no meaning
words have no meaning until they are given a meaning
but now that you mention it, youre right
i thought they were both universal
yo I was very horny for ranma as a kid lmao
ranma
you mean like the guy from magical girl raising project?
o
I guess they meant "tomboy" (is that word ok?)
I assume it wasnt meant that way
so thats a pretty fair reason
I mean, there are a lot of people who want to have children
yeh, a friend of mine told me a while ago
since I always assumed that genitalia is the main factor of attraction
a while ago
I was surprised about that too
tbf
well I shouldnt talk since Im technically bi/pan
it still varies from person to person
but I hate my own
I like dicks
Es
Y
Only miku is allowed to
No lewding bikki either
Lol

Anyone who says otherwise is an idiot
Your existence isnt political
They dont deserve sexual pleasure
Dont fuck terfs
Lesbians and females?
Feelings are a fact
Its easy to change behaviour
Its hard to change feelings
Sigh
Thank you
And not do it
You can respect that
Yes but if you know someone gets hurt
Words can harm
I shouldnt have rejoined
Im lazy
Uh
Thw difference is
Lol
my driving teacher got fired because he scammed students
Im glad all the assholes in my life are finally getting punished
so yeah, I knew this guy was doing illegal shit
but he also sold hacked amazon fire sticks
fixing phones officially
I hope this \***** stays in prison for a long ass time
while also doing a shit ton of illegal shit
constantly made fun of homosexual and transgender individuals
this dude legit ranted about immigrants stealing jobs and all that shit
but holy crap
ok I think Im safe
fuck
after 1 year in college
~~i am slightly worried about my graduation certificate getting yeeted now~~
because he was banned from opening business in 1990
turns out his shop got closed
I think Ive talked about my horrible ex boss a few times
what the fuck
especially because we dont have much information regarding the topic
Im kinda pissed off by the pokemon outrage. Its such an overreation and there are many good reasons not to freak out
which could also mean "we dont wanna crunch"
the pokemon change is because they dont want to delay the release date
the thing is
thats crazy
the fuck
If thats true, that line in the article is kinda misleading
Thats what I heard at least
Wasnt the "controversial tweet" just a joke of an intern?
its not really that hard to accept that some people are different than you
its not a mindset
wtf
by stating that you dont think highly of them
at the moment
right now
you are
non binary
not many
thats 1
they are ***A*** human being
LMAO melua
because thats been a thing since for ever
you also dont have a clue about grammar
and if you dont wanna call 1 person they
you obviously have no understanding of biology and psychology
this ignorance is insane
Im gonna leave
the fuck???
**naturally**
**not with hormone therapy**
there are people who are born with a dick and develop tits in their teens
wtf
no thats not how it works
and your biological body works on a scale
the point is that you are stating wrong facts as an opinion
you completely missed the point didnt you?
21
well I believe that 1+2 is 10
your middle school level biology classes?
what qualifies you to say this stuff?
ü§î
yet you somehow disagree with them
I have friends who studied biology and friends who studied psychology
jesus fucking christ
its literally used for people
they isnt used for objects
**not even biology is binary**
which you are basically undermining
but we have our own society
we are not
that way
its really easy to visualize
intersex is literally just a middle in the scale
sensitive-> ||its like parents who repeatedly beat their children while also saying "i dont want to hurt you"||
they definitely deserved it
despite all this being clarified
over and over again
if they keep saying it
in addition to that it is also scientifically untrue
who are hurt by these words
that there are people here who dont feel comfortable with that
we explained it multiple times
dunning kruger
i like that
spectrum is easy to visualize
exactly
"I have sources but im not gonna show them"
"one of those people"
obviously
doesnt mean it doesnt hurt them
just because its not directed at them
its like calling some stranger fat while your obese friend sits next to you
its hard to fight against information bias
aye
or the definition of "opinion"
people really need to read up on what free speech actually is
people really think saying "its just my opinion I dont want to be mean" gives them the right to say things that will offend people or are scientifically wrong, without anyone giving them shit for it
also this is not a good way to start a conversation
you are doing that rn
yes please
That wasnt a vaguepost
lol
said 2 different sentences
you
chaos chaos
it has a very negative connotation
"one of those people" is definitely not neutral
"in my opinion" is not a magical spell that turns everything you say into an opinion
in my opinion 10+10 is 30 
is not an opinion
Nice
Maybe the example was too much
Hm
I really dont see the harm here
But isnt that pretty much that?
Thats why its called boner. Because of the dick and vagina bones
LMAO

Oh god twitter was wildin again
Yikes
Yep
I just hope they dont mess up
Well I dont really care about the game anyway
Im curious too
Oof
Its pretty much the equivalent of sexists complaining about the addition of females in pokemon

its more opinion war, than anything else
you will often find situations where a group of people will gang up on singular users
and avoid other opinions
its very easy to find likeminded people
at least thats what I used to do, in hindsight
I feel like a lot of people use that centrist mindset to escape actual engagement
but its hard for them to suppress their feelings
its easy for me to stop using it
when a word makes someone uncomfortable
that its hard for people to turn off their feelings
some day I just came to the realization
üôè
me too when I was a teen who watched too many youtube commentary channels
so thats something
also one of them will misgender me until my transition is complete because "gender doesnt exist"
because "no opinion is wrong"
they would always present themselves on this moral highground while basically supporting racism etc indirectly
with 2 people actually
I just had bad experiences with someone who said this
yeh
I used to have that "i am centrist i am so smart" mindset, but its just stupid
looking at germany, a lot of parties dont actually make politics that reflects the name of said parties
just because you are in a left party doesnt mean you can not use ideas from other parties
^
I wanna slap that smile out of his face
He actively refuses to give any credit
He clowns on people who ask him to credit the artist of the image he posted
Elon is such a dumbass

rats are nasty
took me literally 1 minute to find the original artist
üëè üëè üëè üëè üëè üëè üëè
elon musk posting uncredited art on his twitter account and getting sucked off by his fans
o
thats what ive heard
didnt brexit go through because people thought it wasnt worth to vote?
the only reason I try to stay somewhat up to date with german politics, is so that I can avoid wasting a vote
tho Im not really deep into US politics and Im trying to avoid it as much as possible because it drains my mental health
but was met with legal restrictions
and from what ive heard, trump has been trying to rush that process a few times in the past
but it was a long and steady process
people like to believe that nazis came out of nowhere
thats crazy
I think my family just doesnt understand it and im too shy to tell them
I like how my father keeps calling our male dog "she" but cant fucking bother to call me that
I agree with solo
Random people on the internet acknowledging that the evidence is against them doesnt throw them in jail
Freedom of speech has nothing to do with them being guilty
eh
cant add much more
^
8 accusers dont just come out of nowhere usually
getting upset because they exist
or better yet
imagine disliking actual grammar rules
the dislike ratio upsets me
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46ehrFk-gLk&feature=youtu.be
Our rules for them are way to strict for them to screw innocent people over (unless some higher up makes a really shitty decision)
Never really had problems with the german police
Im still really looking forward to it
<a:MariaShake:493803268850319360>
I just dont know what exactly to expect
yeh I knew the sex drive thing and altered emotions
im unsure about the crying part because i already cry a lot over nothing
Im absolutely fine with having less sex drive tbh
do I need to be scared of HRT? ü§î
shen bapiro being an idiot? ü§î

this entire fucking thing is so dangerous
its also fucking horrible
than
and if its serious
because they idolize him
children around the world will imitate it
if this is a prank
I dont even know anymore
fuck
more information
do we got
wait
Im glad it worked out
This is real, that etika situation is crazy
I love how whenever you bring up ben shapiro as being radical right people go like "no he cant be because he is jewish"
some even chose smaller parties to completely dodge all the bullshit
we have some politicians here that said no to corruption for their entire career
I wouldnt say so
theres a reason why hibiki resonates so much with me
but I just try to expect the best from humans just to be disappointed again and again
you are probably right
cops should act like protectors, not like a threat
that shouldnt be the case
doesnt matter if you have superiors, you can just be an asshole or murderer towards randoms on the street without consequences
just become a cop
its probably the easiest way to achieve superiority
its horrible
yeh
which is mostly true
no shit, people are really fucking smug towards cops because they think cops cant do anything to them
thats why we restrict them with a huge amount of guidelines
im certainly not in a position to do that
to solve the long term issue
im just trying to speculate possible causes and solutions
im really not defending that asshole of a cop
i feel like it creates a psychological paranoia
i mean still, the training and all
oh
in america youre probably trained to expect anyone to just point a gun at you any moment
i mean
it was crazy
god i remember last year when I was active in a discord with an african american majority, there were like monthly posts about people getting beaten up by the police at their schools
in america
self defense is basically an excuse to shoot before asking questions
i dont know, maybe as a german Im still scarred by the DDR and the RAF
violence only leads to more violence
how is that any better
youre encouraging systematic violence against cops
I mean
the people are just victims of the shitty system
the system is causing people to become bad
the cops
not the guns
when german cops lift their gun when they arent supposed to they are getting fired
because americas laws are shit
just because there are tons of shithead cops doesnt mean they are all bad
yes they do
what the hell kinda logic are you on
then of course all cops become bad
if good people stop becoming cops
and living up to the negative stereotypes isnt either
because violence is not a solution
yes
the question is should be: why is humanity driven by hatred and greed
We were all unknowing at some point <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
Some things seem obvious, but you never know who might fall for it

fuck...
(And also transphobic)
Keemstar is a drama and attention greedy idiot
the great filter is upon us
yeppp
who will dig out any "oh a left wing person did something slightly not okayish, thats why we need trump" or some shit
I know a certain person in the jojo youtube community who is like this
yeh if you just attack random cops people will be like "see, trans people deserve this" or "see, the left deserves this"
1. dysphoria
2. im gonna be fucking homeless fuck
3. the world is a shithole filled with hatred
thats one of my top 3 biggest "I hate life" reasons
and how the system works
with how people are
but its just impossible
because I want these issues to be solved peacefully
I often cry myself to sleep in desperation
I mean
when they made the gay relationship "vague" I was like, hm... benefit of the doubt, but this is fucking stupid
this is ridiculous
maybe netflix should pay some attention to who they chose as translators

Or 'being an ass'
For some people religion means ignoring facts
I dont think thats how not being a bigot works
Uhm
Well maybe it wasnt uncommon back then idk
But they have voted for the same party for the past 60 years (which is uncommon with how the german system works)
My grandparents are the nicest people ever
Pretty much how being old works
Yep
i should go to sleep
im getting too emotional over this topic again
do they realize that the whole world laughs at them?
are these people real
how
jesus fucking christ
what
shit
holy
lol
I dont, because I think ive blocked 90% of conservative twitter
inb4 "CENSORSHIP!!!!!!!!!!"
lmao
what
sensationalism is the biggest problem of modern media imo
promoting this kind of content
youtube is such a garbage platform
https://twitter.com/MetiNTBG/status/1143796061917655041
thats fucking disgusting
ive seen that
oh yeah
yeh its hard to understand things that dont really affect yourself
its such a complex topic
Im curious how people who arent ok with that word would think about them
I have a friend who specifically wants to be referred to as queergender
I just have to hardlearn most of the stuff that might be insulting in english
its even hard for me to understand it because we have completely different words in our language
makes sense
probably also a personal thing
i know it used to be a slur, but at this point its basically just part of the LGBT as in LGBTQIA
I also saw someone who had "no Q slur" in their bio
yeh
same
why is that?
ive heard yesterday that some people feel uncomfortable with "enby"
oof
like is there some kind of logic behind it that isnt on the same level as terfs?
why are enby erasure and bi erasure a thing?
Race should be brought up when its relevant
the fuck
what
https://www.al.com/news/birmingham/2019/06/woman-indicted-in-shooting-death-of-her-unborn-child-charges-against-shooter-dismissed.html
more people than just trump
or like
tho thats more the guards fault maybe
and also denying donations from helpful americans
**concentration camps**
hey uhm like russia is nice and all but he keeps people in concentration camps
workers get exploited, products are designed mostly around monetization, not around satisfying the consumer
and not the only bad thing about it
monopolies are a byproduct of capitalism
**social market economy** > capitalism
if its not then... meh
but sounds like it could be one
not sure if thats also a yearly thing
https://twitter.com/TravisAllen02/status/1146431810580209664
yeh true
beep boop
"lets waste some government money for purposes it is not intended for"
beep boop
"i am rich I have so much money"
beep boop

so "feelings" dont really mean anything
pretty sure that post is about global temperature average
"how is global warming a thing if its snowing outside"
climate is about long term conditions
climate is not about 1 hot month
its not a climate change thing
data is more accurate than feelings
but my memory is bad so i might be wrong
it was the hottest june I have ever experienced in germany
I can say so much:
the comments are filled with climate change deniers lol
yeh
is that real?
https://twitter.com/BreakingNLive/status/1146122359151239169
imagine if the hulk was german
true
I cant say fuck or bitch in german because those words sound a lot stronger

understandable
the second world war was direct aftermath of the great war before
pretty much yeah

But people dont like that
Its little effort
Yes but thats unpaid work
same
good luck
nothing except for "nah we dont want them to be treated like humans"
what reason did they have to turn them down?
the guards turned them down
and when peeps came to donate stuff
the conditions in there are almost unlivable
:o
Theyre going for an entirely different movie
They arent just making a worse version of the already good original
I actually think cutting mushu and the songs is a good sign

Im proud of you
Gratz wolf
But Im not interested either way
I kinda feel like little mermaid and mulan could be good tho
Yeh
Like snow white
Its not like it was an integral part of her character
Why does race matter here
Or get a good actress instead
These tweets are way too true
Some peeps are mad cuz they got a black actress to play her
~~the usual~~

The best thing about capitalism is trans-action

I can use a transflag in my browser and now I want everything
I want pride flag emojis
they always have to scream at something
from my experience
i dont know much about gundam but I can say that a lot of people who love funny valentine from jojos are pretty nationalistic
~~well they are pretty far on the left at least~~
basically a joke party *in the literal sense*

<:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
Proud of you
Im not really invested in it, but I feel like people are overreacting
Also if it had a different name and overlining plot elements people would call it rip off
And honestly, I dont see the problem with that here.
Im more worried about the quality of the product
They call it remake to make money
its just an excuse for shitty behaviour
the whole "only the strong are allowed to survive" mindset
some people just lack empathy
lol
but jojo made me appreciate the real world more
its gonna sound stupid
dont judge me
but greys abs made me appreciate men more
pretty much
like when someone broke up with me and i watched 200 episodes of fairy tail
it can be
but im not sure
~~i think the father of one of my friends believes this stuff~~
its weird
they make fake IDs and everything
and these people believe they are still people of the "German Reich"
but basically the government is supposed to be "germany Ltd." and owned by america
so im not too deep into it
not sure how big this is nowadays, but it used to be a growing problem a few years ago
we have some germans that passionately believe that germany is a company owned by america
there are lots of weird conspiracy theories out there
idk
maybe it was russia
i cant really point my finger at it
i think ive heard about something like that once but
~~i only have a very small fading memory in the back of my brain~~
is that... referring to that...?
wasnt there this stupid conspiracy about alaska being owned by china?
no context needed for now

I have a question
:)))))))))))

i live in an area with a big muslim population, so our teacher immediately counted out the US so that we wont run into problems

exactly
*because people are different and experiences arent universal*
yeah im just a kid
4 u maybe
lemme just ignore that
yeah like when my brother constantly plugs the router in and out
yes but not everyone can do that
~~not physically of course~~
when they get on my nerves i gotta let it out sometimes
cuz i cant walk away from them
do you have siblings?
yes
with the wording
i disagree
U r
Oooof
Arent even most republicans fed up with his shit?
wow thats totally a necessary comment for this type of situation
I hate "I dont care" because obviously they care enough to say how much they dont care
honestly anything that isnt empathy for the victims pisses me off
over here in germany I mean
not sure if its still the case, or if it ever has been, but an urban legend says that piracy gets punished harder than (problematic topic ahead) ||child abuse||
balancing levels of punishment is low priority in a lot of countries
pretty much yeah
cause often they leave prison with no other choice than to commit crimes, because they dont really have any other option outside of begging
depending on how bad the crime is, its usually better to reintegrate people into society
from what ive read countries with soft punishments have pretty low crime rates
harsh punishments dont reduce crime and there are studies that prove that
what yorin said ^
oh wait, actually its never worked
~~because fear has always been proven to be a solid solution to crime~~
surprised me too
apparently not
nope
~~what a surprise~~
I think 2024 or something
isnt mickeys copyright gonna expire in a few years ?
we are kinda just jumping between topics naturally
but if you want money, you gotta appeal to people with money
votes come in either way
I mean
pretty easy to make that connection
maybe Im theorizing too much here
~~probably totally not connected to companies being very desperate about protecting their money~~
for real?
wait
I assumed so
real as in mythology
cause I only know about a few and couldnt find more information on others
how many of the symphogear relics are based on something real?
Ive always been curious
lol
i find it really interesting to read about
im actually pretty interested in all that stuff
woah
he seemed more like a representation of free speech
satan in the bible never seemed that evil to me
yeah thats the thing
female priests, priests are allowed to marry etc
but from my experience protestants are a lot more open
I dont know if there are more or less catholics here
yeah its the biggest or second biggest religion where I live I think
I had specifically catholic lessons in school
i dont know enough about that
"buy yourself free from your sins"
#crusades
yeah the vatican is notorious for hiding information or trying to push agendas
my main take about this is: "god didnt personally write the new testaments, and probably didnt write the old one either"
<:strongShrug:488272679498153995>
god doesnt want me to live either way
I mean
yep definitely
if said god followed the religious texts?
also they had to be translated a lot
~~i mean book burnings have always been a thing, and back in the day that was the ultimate destruction of knowledge~~
not impossible regarding historic texts
but because I think the texts teach some dangerous or outdated values and were probably manipulated by some powerful idiots back in the day
not because I dislike people who follow these religions
im not a big fan of most of the abrahamic religious texts I know (which boils down to Ive read the bible once)
so basically
but some of the allegations were most likely real, and I think thats enough confirmation for me, especially with the way vic generally acts
there was some shady shit on both sides
i usually do that when a topic gets too big
i muted all related tags during that time
so I think Id roll with yes
but I think it got worse after the controversy
hearing vics voice in anime was painful even before the controversy because I really dont like his voice
but that doesnt make it any less cool
pop culture likes to make stuff up
^aye
or it was never specifically mentioned at least
and odin never had a bow
my friend who studies scandinavian recently wrote a treatise about exactly this topic
for anyone who is still interested in the ichaival origin
so
so basically fire emblem just translated around a bit and created their own bow based on the home of this god
Ichaival and Yewfelle are derived from √ùdalir (literally "yew-dale"), the home of the god Ullr. "Ichi" is the Japanese word for yew (Taxus baccata), a coniferous tree used to make longbows, while -val and -felle could be derived from dale or valley - FE wiki
so I asked a dude from norway (who apparently studies skandinavian) so Ill just wait for a reply and hope
I just saw the god was listed in the fire emblem wiki
my bad then
ah ok
well I mean, hard to give a good answer if were cant really pinpoint it ourselves
üôè
gj symphogear wiki
Ullr is a fire emblem god i think
lol

"fan"
some uh
"Wikipedia Requiem"
cleaning up
lmao
thats actually hilarious, and at the same time shows that sometimes more than 1 source should be considered
and symphogear and smite thought "nice"
some jackass on wikipedia wrote it onto the norse god section
fire emblem made up a bow
so basically
and smite should be based on real religions
cause i found the bow in smite
I was about to comment
thats pretty funny ngl
LMAO
which is why a lot of them dont speak up
and actual victims struggle with the same problem
youre still just harming yourself for no good reason
it doesnt matter what is worse
why the hell would a women put herself in the crossfire of death threats just to ruin someones life
missing the point
shes getting death threats
you do realize as soon as a woman says something like that
uhm
ikr
usually my pfps bore me after like 1 week, but this one still makes me happy
I love that bikki face
thats the only reason I even  know about that law lol
when erdogan decided to start a lawsuit against a german talkshow host
I mean, of course I dont have to worry about that law, but that law caused a huge international controversy a few years ago
but I still avoid it
also yeah, whenever I do illegal stuff I use a VPN lol
yeah Ive talked shit about foreign leaders, thats technically illegal according to a medieval law
I just have an unreasonably high fear of getting caught
not because I wanna support the artist
I avoid piracy as much as I can
im a baby
im hoarding weeb stuff
Im perfect
so yeah, japan definitely has VA controversies
I remember giornos video game VA was in a relationship with a 15 year old
and how he talks about young girls
if it came off that way, I apologize
im not trying to attack you personally
you mentioned you dont like discussions like this
*theres video proof*
and I also said I didnt like him before the scandal either
I only said I dont like him
and I barely touched it
i brought up the vic stuff as an example for the question that was asked
i mean yeah, we were touching the water, but you divebombed in
didnt you?
*you started this discussion tho*
when talking about rape
there usually arent witnesses
guilty until proven innocent doesnt work
who tf would be this cruel
how big can an ego even get
dude legit ripped a blue eyes
kinda paradox if you consider that public names are also under public fire if something goes wrong
of course not all the time, but I feel like a big name is a lot more confident in doing something controversial
a lot of times
big names probably also have big egos
the thing is
no matter if innocent or not
and that should be taken seriously
and you can tell me what ever, but teenagers that were genuinely scared of him had tickets
people already said his career was over months ago, then he got announced for kamehacon last minute
Dunkek I dont think that this was meant to upset you, I hope youre alright cuz that sure was heavy
Dark
Lets say big country completely wins against small country.
Completely dominated.


There is revenge.
There are people who dont want you to abuse power.
Jealousy.
Even a win is a loss
Short term success can mean a long term loss
Cause neither side benefits
At some point the other side has to respond.
But as a whole they can and should be avoided
1 side pushing for war is enough
Id say sometimes they are hard to avoid
I wouldnt call it needed
In a war everyone loses. This is even more true nowadays
im not well informed in this topic
but maybe im misinformed
nah I think it was a 3way contract
afaik
i mean technically they dont have to follow it anymore after the US broke it, but I was glad they still did
are they breaking the contract they have with the EU now?
wait

Dont break the law unless you have to
Good
Well technically I didnt break a law cause it wasnt my own weed.
Over here only the ownership is illegal
Ive done weed before even tho its illegal, but outside of helping with my chronical pain, the high didnt really feel like something Id wanna experience regularly
Yeh
Oh I didnt know lsd can actually cause damage
Tho there are some people who have a higher tollerance for mental addiction
Anything that feels good is addictive
Like thc
But the effect it has
Also lsd is addictive, just not the chemical itself
When what they really need is rehab
Just in case
Nasty as fuck
Weed smells
Can we stop using the word drug carelessly
Caffeine is a drug
Aspirin is a drug
I hate people who start smoking around me
Cigs murder you slowly

but I know that its harmful for the animals, for the planet, and spending money on a really shady industry
I regularly feast on meat
wtf
Im not shaming people for eating meat
**and I have a really big phobia**
most insects ive eaten taste really good
they are
as if meat wasnt fabricated to not look like the animal
it reminds me when some news site posted that switching from meat based diets to insect based diets could solve a lot of environmental issues and people completely freaked out like "uuuuuuh dont force this disgusting shit down my throat"
im not even vegan, but people who proud themselves with their meat consumption disgust me
fucking hell

I remember I learned stuff about a government system designed by plato in school, but I cant find anything about that on the internet
sokrates believed that only the educated should be able to vote (obviously that creates just as many flaws, but he had a point)
democracies are only as effective as the education system
its the reason why sokrates didnt like democracy
yeh
that shit was the video games of 100s of years ago
remember don quixote?

its just more noticable in america
its happening all around the world
toooo be fair
and i still meet people who say racism doesnt exist in 1st world countries
the teacher was turkish too btw
I think the teacher went on a US trip with his class before and had to spend a long time at the gate because of how many muslim looking students were in his class UwU
when we planned our class trip, our teacher said we cant go to the US because of 3 reasons:
1. we had a good chunk of turkish citizens in our class
2. terrorism warning
3. price

doesnt make what he said any less disgusting
not can
he said "are"
no
i thought the problem with the statement was the "poor kids vs white kids" comparison
he said they are just as talented
"implied white kids are brighter and more talented than non white kids"
what the dude said is still terrible, but didnt he say the opposite?
uh
people are pretty dumb tbh
imagine starting a sentence with "not to be sexist" and then you say something absolutely sexist
someone posted "Not to be sexist tho but all the women Ive seen on twitter have absolute doshit opinions on anime. then again all women who like anime are e thots"

Ive never interacted with that person before but he had me blocked and Im very thankful for that

there are certain capitalistic as- i mean individuals that shame other people who are disabled for draining tax money

yikes
the result of the current situation is that people make stupid votes because they are manipulated by powerful people, so maybe certain individuals are still too powerful, and we instead need more power to the people
lemme throw in an idea, i dont know if its good or bad
we have people in east germany that miss the GDR despite all the fucked up dangerous shit that was going on back then
nostalgia is a dangerous drug
yeh, and older people tend to become more conservative in their mental state
nah but for real, the vote of a 14 yo might be worth more than the vote of an 80yo, unless they are manipulated by their parents (which is likely)
0-18 cant vote so maybe people shouldnt vote in their last 18 years either
i mean
sometimes i get the feeling that some people arent smart enough to vote, but thats a horrible thought i shouldnt be having
bunch of bitch babies
dont read the comments btw
a former friend of mine called himself centrist and he was both economically and socially fairly far right, he just used centrist to elevate himself above " filthy normies"
right is basically anti progress in the truest sense of the word
at least thats the origin of it
yeah left and right is just "i want change" and "i want the old stuff"
im a poop brain
no wait i mixed up vertical and horizontal
there is an economic vertical axis, a social vertical axis and a horizontal axis
like not at all
isnt how a political compass works
"left and right bullshit"
or they just dont wanna engage with politics
or because they dont look into political views enough
mostly because barely anyone understands the political scale
most centrists arent centrists tbh

can someone pull some brakes pls?
yeh
Thats crazy
Wait is it really about private import?
im honestly not sure who i should trust on this
You were right, but
<@99695384296701952> https://twitter.com/NASA/status/1164302110244126720?s=19
so idk how much i remember correctly
at least thats what i learned in school like 10 years ago
what i do know is that nomads in rainforests often burn down trees to let new ones grow and then wander into a new area
Especially when many people already share shitty beliefs
Killing the person in charge doesnt always have the desired effect I believe
Im slowly losing hope tbh
We are about to reach a point of no return
but nothing that cant be changed
the EU is amazing but sadly the system is undemocratic
Stay safe fig
Basically youtube values watch time and engagement most.
Comments likes and dislikes all boost the video in the algorithm
Even dislikes boost videos and it completely ruins the point of that button
True, didnt think about that
The good thing about yt is that you can just adblock people who do shitty things
^i agree
he literally said "there was a power imbalance because im a youtuber" and thats something im personally not ok with
i watched the video
it does not matter if they are adults
it does not matter if they consent
i am not ok with people abusing a power dynamic like this to get and send nudes
he still prayed on fans
"oh if im an ass i can pressure money out of other countries"
if brazil is getting the money then thats just even more motivation for him to pull shit

im dead


Also I was just joking, im sorry

Several thousand doesnt sound like enough.
The first cultures started forming 10000 years ago, im sure humans were here a lot earlier than that üò≥
"I cant believe the world is 2019 years old
i still think its stupid not to participate
freedom means i have the right not to participate
the next step to "forcing people to vote" is "forcing people to vote for me" so im a bit eeeh on that
51 only represents the people who voted
im using an exaggerated example
is that a fair ratio then?
these ratios dont tell much.
49% saying "fuck no this is gonna kill me
51% "nah its fine i dont really care"
its already in progress afaik
better change the system in the long run
mainly because it literally destroys livelihoods?
oof
what does this mean
wai
like dang, didnt expect this shit in a video game chat
i forgot how old the wow community is. people in general chat promoting nazi parties and denying climate change
the United Kountry
yeah china is scary to think about
tell me if you find out, i have the same issue every year
but i dont know much about our green party, i only know that many peeps hate them
our  greens are the 2nd biggest force according to the last EU election. 
lets see if they can keep it going until the next in country election
most big politicians dont give a shit about my rights here
because they dont care
especially when people are uninformed
but forced participation doesnt help
so i might have spend way more time than average
my teacher got fired for scamming
and your goal in acquiring the ability to drive is never to commit murder
you dont get a car unless you spend hours and hours learning how to opperate it
People like to bring up switzerland in the debate

In switzerland you arent allowed to own ammo
Millitary service is mandatory therefore everyone receives special training
You could start by making it harder to get guns or ban ammo and stuff like that
People like to talk about numbers, but dont even think about why the numbers are the way they are
Sure the child cant hurt anyone, but its still caught in the crossfire
Its like throwing a child without gun into a pool of armed adults
^
ü§î
Guns are a great defense.
Just block the bullets with your own bullets
The problem is that gun free zones arent enough when there are still guns all around you
Which is backed up by numbers afaik
Nah itll be people saying that its because people cant defend themselves in gun free zones
i think gay
~~id prefer we dont challenge nature~~
Climate change got balanced out by nuclear winter in the futurama universe
Not if futurama comes true
all with an instructor constantly looking over my shoulder
and then even more hours to pass my practical exam
i had to spend hours of learning just to pass my theory exam
ok i didnt know it was so different in the US
~~and like 3000‚Ç¨ i think~~
i spent over a year
over here it takes at least a few months
wait what
Lol
People are stupid sadly
Thats some dictator ass shit
This dude
Fuck
The
What
I hate this website
But if you say stfu terf you get a perma ban
CW animal abuse: ||Some dude who openly r*pes his dog got away with a 1 week ban||
from what ive heard goku and vegetas VAs were always known for being kinda shitty people
"he wouldnt just donate to organisations without looking into them"
according to an article im reading the ADL was one of the organizations that tried to shut his channel down, so Im sure he knows what hes doing lol
yikes
pewdiepie has the special ability to make the entire political spectrum hate him
lol
mass shootings can happen regardless of social standing
Id say guncrime in general is more of a social standing thing
but if its like 70 vs 60 it isnt really that good of a proof
i mean, theres a clear image when its like 4 vs 500
coincidence
could just be anecdotal evidence
its not really a race about who has the most shootings tbh
no dangerous animals, no natural disasters etc
I love the place I live, but thats mostly just the location, not the country itself
crying and hiding
its juist the only thing I know how to do
im not saying my way is the best way
delete my channel and cry
no wait I do
honestly, I dont know how I would handle it
but it never forgets
the internet has a short attention span
Thats not an easy task
That suddenly became famous
A normal guy
Hes like
Agreed
I feel this
I said specifically like 300 times yesterday
Sadly
But I cant deny that a lot of his fans are idiots
I dont even blame felix, he has spoken up against bigotry at many opportunities
Thats just how it is when this many people follow you
Yeah when you have 100million, a good chunk of them is gonna be bigots
~~or bots~~
a very significant part of his fans
or you know
so either its an incredibly vocal minority
despite the fact that tons of comments already got deleted
or like straight up anti semitism
90% of them are "ADL is blackmailing him" or shit like that
just look under the comments of the 100 million video
honestly
that sounds unpleasant
ouch
like this whole "got fired because didnt look like a woman" thing
the general misogyny in that statement is a problem, even without the person being trans
cause body types that arent common exist either way
its one of those things that would be a problem without trans people existing, but trans people are a catalyst to shine general light on this
uh
Just had to give them money
Catholic church a few hundred years ago could buy people free from hell
Not a credible source
Which is
I think the most common interpretation of hell is Dante's Inferno
Jesus said architecture is a sin
Selective faith
Yet people only listen to "gay bad"
The bible contains tons of bullshit
yeah probably
in fact he spoke up against bigotry a bunch of times
pewds wasnt really acting right wing
im sorry but like ive seen the anti semetic comments, listening to these fuckers is not really a good sign
is he pulling back or not
but wait
it might be a coincidence
does not look like a maltese cross
that
its not valid sorry
it sure as hell looks like one
thats a huge red flag
where is that image from
jesus
yikes
We have the responsibility to adjust
You are pointing a sword forward
Someone is running directly towards the sword

So youd just not point the sword somewhere else because "the person was never supposed to run inyo it"?
?
whats easier
1 million parents act properly vs 1 youtuber
and act accordingly
at some point people gotta accept they are a role model
its super irresponsible
it absolutely isnt
his fanbase is horrible
well obviously not
doesnt make the joke less tasteless tho
quite the opposite
the point was never "jews bad"
the point was "people do really bad shit if money is on the line"
soooo
the joke was tasteless, but the actual point was "capitalism bad"
being somewhat big is alright if you stay away from social media and dont ever get political in any way
With mayo
I take some titsn ass
not a fan
i know plenty of straight cis guys who play female characters lol
And hitler drew and painted
Nazis hated art from artists that didnt agree with them
And Wagner was an anti semite
Hitler was a big fan of Wagner
No
maybe because ive blocked 100+ boomers on twitter lol
but most comments ive read were supportive
only some mad boomers
maybe even more
and somehow that increased their votes by like 10 percentage points
but they shifted their main focus to being literal neo nazis
well they still exist and still wanna leave the EU
or rather "gerexit"? idk
we used to have a "brexit party" in germany
thats democracy for ya
"no country" is a matter of who people vote for
i elected people into the EU that do want to reform it
the EU is kinda shitty, but reforming it into something good is better than just trying to drop out
yeah pretty much exactly my thoughts
imagine trying to get a majority of your nation to fucking hate you
my ex also wanted everyone to be gay
i think thats called a fetish
dont like headcanoning real people as something they arent
dark
they also have high suicide rates afaik
yikes
"maybe its overwork and high focus and careers an-"
"NO ITS ANIME"
oh
why are they so worried about offspring
dont they have problems with overpopulation?
i dont really understand japans problem tbh
"but most of the babies are in other countries" yeah no problem with integrating them into different countries if they so chose to migrate
we really dont
"gays cant have babies"
yeah, thats great, the world is overpopulated and we have too many orphans
then thats called "bisexual"
if someone thinks being gay is a choice
or something along those lines
and Id like to quote a tweet Ive seen recently:
"If I, who learned english by reading one direction fanfictions, understands how they works, then a boomer who learned english 50 years ago has no excuses"
it has 0 influence in their life
we live in a society
even when there was barely any progress
can be traced back 100s of years ago
old folks complaining about change
its always been like this
hate that language is developing
yeah I think we should go back to how language was 2000 years ago
+1
im surprised youd call yourself that
messed up is a really really strong word imo
Nice
i was invited to a climate ralley but 1. i have other plans 2. i hate outside and i hate crowds
<:MikuPraise:585839808765493249>
mine is "yeet"
I dont think ill ever understand my sexuality
Im only attracted to some anime men its awkward
Especially not in the main stream
Yeah I gave up on finding non transphobic nsfw stuff
:)
yeah and Im going to college
my parents constantly mention "we had a job when we were 16"
"just get a well paid job" is a prime spoiled boomer statement
boomers were really really spoiled from what I can tell
yep
which I feel like is a result of being spoiled by democracy
my parents dont see the value in demonstrations
my family is constantly complaining about the demonstrations because "they produce garbage and skip school"
yeah
I knew as much
but i dont really know enough to really criticize it
sounds like stuff from the distant past
im really not a fan of what ive heard of the US prisons tbh
"A single death is a tragedy; a million deaths is a¬†statistic"
People just look away
Thats the world we live in
Criminals in the US cant vote but criminals in the US can be elected president ü§î
What the fuck
I hate people
Thats absolutely disgusting
Putting the game at 41% off in reaction to this 
 should get the game taken off steam
Taking hard drugs is also a hobby
but I agree with you that the big issue here is racism
and with the way america works it is legal to shoot down someone whos tryin to rob you
I believe that a tired person can accidentally walk into someone elses house
when the US has some of the hardest punishments in the west afaik
theres reasons why the crime rate is so high, and its definitely not because the punishments are "too soft"
I cant bring myself to see a punishment as too soft when the entire prison system in the US is hell
the whole US judge/prison system is the issue
what pisses me off is the fact that black dudes get way harder punishments for way less
so its basically manslaughter and not a planned murder
the cop walked into the flat by accident and thought the dude was trying to rob her
even the victims brother forgave the cop from what ive heard
punishment should fulfill the purpose of either
1. keeping the public safe
2. rehabilitating the culprit
i dont believe in punishment as a form of revenge
so theres that
for life means 14 years in germany
*edited cause my brain is poop
I wouldnt call it too little jailtime if it wasnt for the context of a racist system
Germany back at it again, selling guns to the arabic emirates üò¥
If its the same tweet I saw
It wasnt
<:TsubasaSmug:585839805737467920>
Yes
~~which it obviously isnt~~
Id assume they see it the same way as portraying a german as a beer drinker in letherpants
They probably just dont know better
Wtf
https://twitter.com/Complex/status/1180624280435994625?s=19
Im speechless
we have enough of these
no pls dont let them reproduce
the irony
the people here who praise hitler publicly also complain that free speech is allegedly not a thing
people indeed are
Trump can do anything and people will still defend him
As my former economics teacher once said:
"Most corporations start as a passion project, but then the management shifts towards economic professionals"
Its really sad but corporate bullshit gets everything at some point
Yeah
But activision blizzard is a shithole
I love blizzard games
Blizzard is a trash company and I hate it
Ouch
4 7 8 is great
I hope it works out
Good luck
I make kriisa angry
Wow
They wanna look like a traditional sports team
I really wanna get wc3r but oof
Not just as in fetish
I know lily but i thought it was also used similar to getting cheated on
I mean sexual still
No
Cuck isnt just a fetish term is it?
i didnt know tf2 had an economy
blizzard is basically just milking them for skins and thats the only reason the game has servers at all
I still know a few people that keep heroes of the storm alive too
kept alive by a few passionate individuals
i havent heard of overwatch in ages until today
until blizzard said "fuck them" and left a ton of people unemployed out of nowhere
it was very alive and sustained a fair amount of pro players for 2 years
but dont quote me on that Ive abandoned the game long ago
i think china also has the only relevant heroes of the storm league that still exists
its also the biggest income of riot games
china in general is a huge gaming market
cowards
jesus
And I think some sellers buy boxes in masses to artificially limit supply of certain cards
Boxes are mostly just milking children and casual players
Yeah
But the packs are a requirement for the game to exist
I never buy yugioh packs I just buy singles
Honestly I dont want this gamgling stuff to exist but for certain genres its the only sustainable way
My brothers have dumped so much money into fifa
Yeh
But spreading awareness could help
Same goes for tcg tbh

I dont really want it to get banned or age restricted
Still there should be a warning of some sort imo
But its mostly on the parents
Getting them addicted to gambling at an early age isnt exactly learning their lesson
Cosmetic lootboxes are problematic for children imo
i have never played tf2
i think the only real draft format we have in yugioh is battle pack and nobody really plays that
thats true
Lasagna is ok I guess
cant wait for all my friends "coming out as straight" parties
I wouldnt risk it
Yeah
^^^
ü§î
actually it became a globally known issue
no wait
yeah sure cause that exactly what happened
Or blizzard if you dont walk the extra mile
Its not like his statement directly interfered with anything.
If anything its china who interfered
We can talk about time and place once we have peace on this god awful planet
^
It was literally 5 seconds long
You can hear a political (life or death) stance and still enjoy hearthstone
"Wrong time wrong place. Doesnt belong into sports"
Yeah sure he shouldve said it where nobody can hear it
we also have that kind of advertisement ban on movies
but i think nowadays games are finally considered art
so you could consider this a "ban on games"
also germany had a ban on swastikas on everything that isnt art
but i think thats just to not get on that list
oh yeah censored games are a thing
but outside probably knows more
you can basically still go into a store and ask for said game, but they arent allowed to put it on a shelf
like one of these games that basically drain your parents credit cards
i think ive read they are trying to get a gambling mobile game on that list atm
and I think they still do it, but not as much
it was just a ban on advertisement
afaik
they never did
o
whats up?
dont stretch me on the torture as we germans like to say
yeah
thats why populism is so effective
the average voter can digest "this minority steals our jobs" a lot better than the numbers behind "why its actually not like this"
I think generally:
playing as the bad guy is not a problem, because people can distinguish between reality and fiction

but:
you know a game where you play as a nazi is gonna attract neo nazi gamers
random lol
gamersTM suck
even tho that had nothing to do with the video
an esports channel recently made a video about terrorists in csgo, where they talked about how changing that name would solve the games problem with sponsors.

the comments are tons of angry gamers who whine about SJWs
oh yeah and extra credits got tons of hate for it
people can distinguish reality from fiction, but these kinds of games will still attract a neo nazi playerbase
i honestly dont like it when devs give people the ability to play as nazis, unless its done in a way that makes the player feel like a disgusting piece of shit
but probably unintentional
it really is worse
i just remember someone telling me that they changed up "jew" with "traitor" in the german release
i think wolfenstein was censored
like how until recently "mein kampf" was "banned" 
until the copyright ran out and the people who refused to print it didnt have that power anymore
in germany we like to ban things without actually banning them
famous example: rambo
like "dont walk into a strangers house"
or just teach them common sense in rare cases
fairy tails were practically propaganda to control children
yeah
moral of the story: if you dont like your food you will die

fairy tails are great
~~but also fairy tails are kinda yikes thematically~~
its pretty wholesome
yeah lmao that exists
the only twitch streamer my grandma would watch is "marmeladenoma" an old lady reading fairy tails
an overused twitch emote generally meaning "woah thats pretty good"
thats a "PogChamp" as my grandma would call it
ooof
the convo went all over the place
maybe fix that? no? we gonna make sweaters instead? great job prime minister
yikes
oof
its usually the poor families that have tons of children from my experience
yeah
a lot harder than just using executive force of law
hard to pull off
but uh
education is an approach that works
thatj ust resulted in abortions and murder
cause they "forced" it with terrible laws
china is a bad example
uh you jumped the gun
we could just petrify humanity instead
nuke is a terrible example
uh
eastern germany has a problem with infrastructure that went completely ignored after communist germany and the west reunited, and now the far right is abusing that, dragging most of them on their side with false information and false promises
makes sense
but the grimm versions are probably made to have a "moral" then right?
oh ok
thats not what i learned tbh
or stuff like that
Its a complex topic
Then you decrease freedom
100% freedom is anarchy, but ironically, anarchy gives you less freedom
Or 100,% safety
But you can achieve happiness without 100% freedom
^
Its a paradox
No actually hes got a point
people are disgusting
CW bullying an autistic kid: ||"haha the autistic dude will come to school with his wooden katana and kill people"|| bullying is not funny, how about we dont make jokes like this?
oh yeah we also had people like that
Wait do they really have a deal for brexit now?
Doubt he can do much
maybe thats one of the reason why im enjoying dr stone so much
i wish the world wasnt a chaotic mess
Yeah shes the head of our conservative party so i guess as much
Yes please i dont wanna pay ridiculous taxes on uk imports
So apparently our constitution isnt worth much
Which was basically unconstitutional
But we turned down snowden
Idk exactly
Uh
I know that at least in germany everyone has a right for asylum afaik
Wait im stupid i think refugees generally have a right to be here
Cant find it
Doesit say that they are legal imigrants?
"Just in case"
The same reason they still have candidates in parliament
ü§î
The fact that conservatives said "fuck human lifes" is fucking disgusting
The fact that it was decided by what are practically 2 nazi votes is fucking dogshit
https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/eu-parliament-refugees-migrants-deaths-search-rescue-vote-mediterranean-a9171401.html%3famp
I didnt look deeper into it yet my bad
It was probably about funds or something
No i misphrased i think
This is just murder
Im disgusted
EU passed a law against sea rescues

"Centrist" and right wing politicians celebrating like friends over their 2 vote majority
Scandinavia is:
Norway, iceland, finland, sweden, denmark
Lol
Norway is scandinavia
Lol
Not easy
Uh
On god
From what ive heard
And scandinavia
I like switzerland in that regard
And I highly value democracy. Too much power to too little people never ended well
I dont care if some people are rich as long as evwryone has enough
Im honestly a fan of a balance between social backup and support for everyone and capitalism to make a competitive market
Its just unrealistic
And they usually agreed that actual communism is good in theory
At least thats what I heard from various history teachers
Afaik
"Communism" as it was originally intended has never been used anywhere
Like she suddenly started pushing slowly against nuclear energy after fukushima
Shes left when ever it gives her votes
Because people felt ignored
Her quiet nature is giving power to unpleasent parties
Well ..
Then again our social democrats also have no spine so parties dont tell you much
You cant just get asylum in all of scandinavia lol
Scandinavia is not a unified nation lol
~~or criminals~~
humans are lazy and just take the most convenient least effort way when ever possible
or children who vote for the same party as their parents because"i dont know wht else to do"
just because "ive always done it"
you dont even realize how many people vote for the same party their entire life
because people are stupid
no to both
no
i dont even fucking know
because
they just get reelected anyway
and in a lot of cases
that money is worth a lot already
dont care if they dont get reelected again
in fact a lot
some politicians
you see
CEOs having a nice friendly dinner with the president
thats modern politics
the government is sold to the highest bidder
give a shit as in "change their whole lifestyle" i mean
uh
yeah like in that one clip where greta said "governments need to give a shit, not the people"
when thats not the fucking issue and most climate activists dont even say that
and if you mention it to the mortal public they are acting like climate activists are forcing them to stop eating meat and using plastic bags or drive a car
noone even makes an effort
the thing is
governments dont give a shit
but
if we start soon
they are called "not investing all our shit in fossil fuels etc"
theres technological breathroughs that can already
probably also a chunk of the remaining 30%
does it include students?
did they change USA to russia??
wait what
sadly people are pretty poopy in their heads
but more of the other bullshit people said was either straight up sexism or top tier hypocrisy
i accept the argument that EA clearly just wanted to show off how progressive they were
yeah that was so fucking stupid
even if its factually correct, if it disagrees with me, it doesnt belong in my media
its only politics if it disagrees with me
so no reason for gamers to complain about historic accuracy
hey but at least its not as bad as putting a woman on a battlefield cover
Im tempted to only research who says trans rights and who doesnt
Im so fed up with politics honestly oof
Current system is ass
I hope we can reform the EU
Its what german news got stuck up on
Which most countries outright refuse to do
The EU is undemocratic and forces their member states to do ugly things like "grant refuge"
Whichd make me part of the problem i guess, but at least my mental health can catch a break
Why is our world so fucked
"I cant celebrate a nation performing ethnic cleansing. Nato is supporting genocide"
The comments

not every christian sub religion celebrates christmas as much as we do
its an irish holiday
i mean its not a universally christian holiday
halloween is not a christian holiday
lol
itll probably change in a few decades
"stupid american holiday doesnt belong here" or shitty arguments like that
a lot of parents just dont allow their children to go trick or treating
nah im just not american lol
we only had 2 children ring our bell
The post specifically states "sry i only wanna give candy to rich children"
someone remind rich christians that greed is a deadly sin
Im speechless
I

depending on where you live
and burning the 500‚Ç¨+ on my blizzard account
spending 0‚Ç¨ on a demonstration
spending 0‚Ç¨ on a vote
between not spending 10‚Ç¨ on a nestle product
there is a huge different
i still think its stupid to have me throw away the money my parents worked for just to boost a number by 1
which was a good thing
a single player number wont change the rounded sum
the difference being that a single vote can decide an election
isnt really that much of a difference
100 000
99 999
no need to throw away what you already payed for
as long as you dont spend money
just playing the games is fine
like
i dont get the point behind deleting an account
honestly
all it does is getting people pissed at a good cause
i dont see how bothering random people there is supposed to help
people paid to go there and they deserve to get their moneys worth
not people trying to have a good time
they are supposed to bother blizzard
I hope they wont
the true champions
https://twitter.com/LawofTD/status/1190288226080083968
good to know
ah the kings holiday thing is called epiphany in english
and i think somewhere (but not sure where) they celebrate new years eve like we do christmas
i think in east europe/russia they celebrate the 3 kings of the east thing
anonymity is quite important
curious cat got completely unusable
everything there from transphobic slurs to just guilt tripping
that was unpleasent
trying to generally avoid collabs with people i dont know well ever since I got in a big fight with some dude i collabed with
POGGERS
trans rep on youtube
viva reverie?
she doesnt really decrease my enjoyment of part 3
anne? yeh i dont really get the point behind her but shes not that big of a deal to me
watch dudebros go apeshit when i tweet: Part 6 > 7
often valid criticism
just as much sexist bullshit
yeah ive read a lot of sexist bullshit about it
i really like it but its an unpopular opinion
hehe
tbf kriisa its the part where 90% of the cast are girls
yeah that would be cooler if that was actually the intention rakhi
which double sucks cause that wouldve been a lesbian relationship in a shounen manga without the sex change
semi off topic: a character in jojo had a sex change in the middle of the story and yesterday for the first time(i think) we got an official reason: "needed a guy cause guys sell better"
hearing the argument "it sells better to have the guys do everything" gets really tiring and just shows how fucking sexist the consumers are
i wouldnt mind sexualization if women in japanese media wouldnt be treated like objects most of the time
outch
in a big way
it probably impacts your own life
but if you are willing to demonstrate despite that
yes
like its much more logical and its obvious that it works that way but my brain just went the wrong route
because for some reason i didnt visualize the concept of "expansion of space"
basically my brain thought about it as growing
i recently had a switch in my head click that made me understand how the universe expands and i felt stupid for thinking it behaves i used to think about it
yes for my statement it does
i thought we switched to agnostic theism
yeah but are we arguing about the christian god rn?
so is it really wrong to call the fabric of the universe god?
the greeks called earth and sky god
because the term god is pretty loose
or what ever caused the big bang
you could argue space time is essentially god
god be like "prostate and also gay is bad"
http://puu.sh/EzFhV/b8e47464fa.png
what a nice guy

fuck the pope in deed
so im not surprised
the vaticaan is absolute dog shit and has always been
greatest of all time but with an ed in the end
agnosticism kinda goated tbh
also atheism cant be proven either
religion isnt inherently bad
thats why im glad so many cis peeps i follow have it in theirs
cause people just assume everyone is a dude
because female avis arent nearly enough for anyone to get gendered correctly
and also women on the internet, even cis, profit from having pronouns in bio
exactly kriisa
big punishment
not wearing it would mean punishment
on public display
basically putting them all out there for everyone to harass or worse
^
ever
like
dont people ever fucking learn from history
and
ive seen way too many "yellow star"/"pink triangle"-ish comments about trans people on the internet
there are concepts of the universe where theres no edge
nvm im stupid
or rather expanding
its just moving faster than light
i mean, there is an edge
it doesnt matter is the best answer tbh
maybe
i knew galaxies were "moving around" i just didnt make the connection
and then i was like "wait a minute... oooooh"
was broke the illusion was the fact that i thought about the fact that universes are drifting apart from each other and expansion of space in quick succession
i just woke up one day and was like "woah what the fuck was i thinking"
it clicked automatically
i didnt even have anyone explain it to me
if that makes sense
just generating more space
not directly making new stuff
i cant even describe the way i used to think because it just didnt make any sense
thats how language works
then everybody does
if nobody uses it correctly
well maybe im just spoiled by german because we can turn any noun into an adjective and verb
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
be more precise with scientific words god dammit
ok english is officially a shitty language then no cap
isnt fluid just another word for liquid
what
genderfluid folks are often like "ah what ever"
yeah same
but i can still feel empathy for animals that have a tail
i cant possibly understand what having pain on my tail feels like because i dont have a tail
i mean yeah, anything we arent is confusing
but genderfluid still often identify as either of the binary gender identities
o
^
or maybe im missing context
i think the word you were looking for is agender
basically
one day youll feel like a girl, one day like a dude, one day like neither
genderfluid means having your gender change
the word you were looking for is "sex"
i got rekt
also "biological gender" isnt a real word
genderfluid doesnt mean what you just said it does
And implications
It gets even more complicated when you include gestures etc
Law, science, friends, your boss

Those are all entirely different
Before communicating you need to agree on a specified language
Scientific papers and casual speech are practically different languages
The thing is
language naturally evolves over time
its the sole reason language rightnow sounds the way it does
it is not
they are wrong
smartasses will tell you otherwise
TLDR:
Fuck the moon
Fine did nothing wrong
Im never gonna get over this asshole
"Im not gonna diagnose you or offer therapy but I can give you anti-depressants"
Aka the reason Im suffering way more than I should
Transmedicalism
Ah yes
Ok
"Understand what they are"
And i went through hell during puberty
I wanted to do hrt in elementary school as a kid and i couldnt
Scientists:
Youre transgender since birth

Not scientists;
B-b-but CHILDREN
Me: history
Story: hi whats up
I guess everyone is the protagonist from their point of view
There is no such thing as a protagonist irl
That makes no sense
Theres a theory that only I exist and everyone else is just automated or not real or what ever
Its a philosophical concept but i forgot the name
In the anime he felt like a character at least
Kazuma being a self insert in the novel is why i didnt enjoy the novel
14 16 is the most normal thing ever
Mini spoilers for s4 i guess: || a disgusting villain misgenders a transcharacter and her friend gets super defensive about that||
I think Hero Academia is a good example of unproblematic transphobia
?
Should it be shown in uncritical context
But
You can have that stuff in that world
not with something this important
I dont trust machines

i was talking about radyjko's suggestion
i wasnt talking to you
i feel like "ok boomer" stuff will just make my life harder
i dont start shit with my family i just try to whitenoise them when they say stupid shit
jeez
my favorite line is "this is a form of elder harassment!!!"
is so hecking funny
the entire thread
https://twitter.com/JournalistEW/status/1192674677736517632
its so irrelevant
i dont even know what we are arguing about here
humanity is dying just creates mass hysteria or makes people ignore it entirely
"i dont see any danger to humanity"
"im alive and everyone i know is alive"
saying the planet dies is not 100% accurate, yes, but its accurate enough
a lot of them dont even understand how the greenhouse effect works
especially with the younger generation thats actively protesting
but people can easily digest "planet dying, we die, we need to do something"
people dont give a shit if you go super into detail about the greenhouse effect and shit
studies have been conducted on it
because understanding the actual rules of the universe is way more complicated than saying "earth flat, everything goes down"
why do you think flat earthers exist
because people dont listen to facts people listen to things that are easy to understand
whats an earth without observers
its just becoming anything between inhabitable and mass extinction
of course nobody is firing a laser of destruction at the planet
thats a new level of nitpicky
Dick comparissons will keep happening because humanity isnt smart enough to stop that shit either
Small scale wars are sadly all over the place and will prolly always be
But they stayed calm despite the potential strike and said "nah that cant be it"
Lemme point at the cold war where a false alarm almost started shit
Manking isnt stupid enough to start a large scale war again
you see what i dont like about this
but I can agree with humanity, equality and socialism
i often answered with the middle when i didnt know what to answer
at least roughly
i think im ok with what i got
i think
very similar to fizzy

i think it got banned because of negative impacts on votes or something
because it actually had questions specifically designed for what parties wanna do
the only political test that wasnt confusing was the "wahl o mat" a tool that used to ask questions and weigh them against the values of german parties
its the same thing with all political tests
im doing it anyway
im very uncomfortable
i shouldnt be able to interpret a question
im not sure either because most questions in these quizzes are fucking weird
if someone thinks anyone can just chose to be gay, then that means that they also can chose to be gay, which implies that the person is probably attracted to all genders and is in denial
or lacks any kind of empathy
anyone who thinks this is probably just pan
time for a hot take

like "we need to violently overthrow the government to change society" is fucking bonkers in germany but probably true for dictatorships
because a lot of the answers highly depend on the situation
i dont like a lot of the questions
i dont fucking get it
why are basic human rights politicla
next question: should your neighbor karl be allowed to live if you dont like him
hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
http://puu.sh/EDNvg/e29a82c22c.png
and im harming literally noone
my existence is not fucking politics
I exist
Im just really tired of being pushed into a political spectrum
sorry if I confused you
suggesting that they only refers to non binary
im trying to make a pun
but what if he or she wants to
or he be he?
but can she be she?
hhhhhhhhhhhhhh

you dont know how quickly i think it will go
rip
id like to do the test but i dont wanna answer 117 questions
Im glad politicians announce their plans instead of just saying: "im 89% socialist, elect me"
üëÅ
I thought a bit more and I am even more convinced that political scale measurements are mostly bullshit
because democracy exists
i dont like this
i mean weighing authority vs anarchy
i dont mean the way you answered
is anarchy vs authority
If not then not
Its kid friendly
If your content is aimed at kids
Youre missing the point
Hhhhh
Anything else isnt
Kid friendly is a toy reciew
When I opened studio beta yt asked me to please mark my content
You can mark your videos yourself tho
Huh
The companies just pressure youtube
The companies just chose whether they wanna show ads anyway
Youtube marks videos as "not suitable for all ads"
Youtube does do the punishing tho afaik
So marking videos as adult content is more profitable now from what ive heard from a friend
Because yt wants to punish predetory environments (not sure why they punish random creators tho)
But nowadays kidfriendly content gets less ads
I cant track what exactly the debate is about
You mean b**mers
Its visual entertainment
I dont get why yt is so strict while tv can do so much shit
I think yall are overreacting
Thats bullshit
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
People said things and they all agreed and came to a mutual conclusion
Jesus
How is this legal

if the UK becomes a better place for transpals I might consider coming over eventually
she seemed quite reasonable in a lot of her videos
ok what in the fuck has gotten into her mind
thats at least 3 yikes on the yike scale
yeah contrapoints is eh
I honestly dont see it as fearmongering
forgot that the US is kind of like the EU in some regards
oh yeah right some us states are pretty neat
ive read "i have an unbearable pain but im broke" a bit too often
us medical system is enough reason for me to never come over
highly doubt that
switzerland sounds cool but also horrible at the same time
i wanna leave the country either way but rn there are barely any good options for me
if the us gets their shit fixed i really wanna come over tbh
fun fact, pence can go *** himself
hope youre safe oclisto
because contrary to popular believe horses arent immune to fire or the poisonous gasses
racism and discrimination
silencing the opposition
obedient media

hello fascism
i think thats fascism but people would call me a lib*** if i said that
rn i havent seen any of that sadly
when shapiro made jokes about "we need to just blow shit up and do wars to assert dominance" his own fanbase hated the shit out of him

so Im actually kinda hoping the same is happening now and his followers just shit on trump for this
I think thats war
im no expert but
https://twitter.com/MSNBC/status/1213156506272710657
its the civilians in the middle east who have to fear for their lives
america prolly wont be negatively affected by a war
^yeah this
im a pacifist
id bet not everyone agrees on the war is bad take
notice the spikes during war
there you go

gimme a sec
hate this new tablet sometimes
a take like this is very much in character for me
well im not the most stable person mentally so
if that makes sense
its optimistic nihilism id say
matter of perspective
wiping all life means nobody has to suffer ever again
i respect the no
nah
can i go full nihilism for a second?
id make a pizza
HOW
well eu is a modern invention so
no clue how big elections get away with being this terrible at democracy
I wanna trashtalk the presidential election system but EU is just as bad and undemocratic
Finding reliable info is impossible
Reminder that russia was sane enough to not launch a strike when their shit went off
The cold war happened and we survived that so
Hopefully not
Also if theres really a large scale war i doubt america would be alone
But ive only read the headline so
Ive read that almost every relevant nation has turned their back on the us
Theres a lot of tension
Yeh
Leaders are hopefully sane enough
I still hope a ww is unlikely
WW1 was started by a single assassination that started a chain reaction and the US isnt exactly on good terms with a lot of nations after this action
Its 1: a possible scenario
2: people need to wake the fuck up about trump
they literally advertise to teenagers at gamescom here
why do they keep looking for more recruits then?
i talk about the draft because i am genuinely very afraid for my own self centered reasons
the reason i dont want war is because i dont want anyone to die
iirc
and currently theres discussions about having a european military
her last position was head of the military in germany
considering who became the leading figure
god im actually scared about the eu
dont see a point for a draft if thats the case
doesnt the us already have one of the largest military forces?
i just had a bimbo moment
that wasnt even language barrier cause the german word for that excercise is also sit ups lmao
thank you
whats the thin g you do with your legs
no wait im dumb
nah but fr let me do sit up instead, i could use some more ass
kinda homophobic if you ask me
"do push ups 100!!!!"
"no sorry, aint no push ups broadening these girl shoulders, bitch"
one of my friends in highschool applied there
Id probably land in the IT department
but id still get drafted because my chronic pain couldnt be diagnosed as anything POGGERS
like me
i think sgt is the correct term here?
i honestly cant wait to get my official gender changed because i can still be drafted any time
well military is still mandatory in a lot of nations
Well that makes sense
Ive watched the interview
Cancelling all of them is really unfair
Theres so many non problematic people working on the property
Also even if she got money
1 va being problematic does not devalue the whole product
What does that have to do with symphogear
Pretty ewww
Yeah its pretty much common knowledge
shit goes south and then hed get blamed for trumps dumbassery
lets say bernie has to take over an america during times of war
i wonder what would happen if trump didnt get reelected
Cause I gotta leave for work and cant eat until like 5 hours later
I cant eat after waking up but have to
Id personally vote bernie but Im only following through twitter cause Im not american
joe rogan saying hes gonna vote bernie is the weirdest thing Ive heard this decade
https://twitter.com/BernieSanders/status/1220445820505546755
if you dont see whats wrong with killing off large amounts of the population then I honestly dont see a point in arguing further
dunno why you even have to debate over this
either way infecting 60% of the population is murder
and the mortality rate over all is still around 1-2% last time i checked
In fact older people are a lot more common than younger people
But not everyone is healthy
Someone in the comments says it would ad up to about 400k deaths with a 1% death 60% infection rate
What in the fucking hell is wrong with the uk
https://twitter.com/SkyNewsBreak/status/1238366264747270144?s=19
I have a question
ü§î ü§î ü§î ü§î
https://twitter.com/People4Bernie/status/1238224689475903488?s=19
Nationalists are on the rise all around here
I mean we have some basic essentials but thats it
Trust me its not any better in europe
Especially in 2020 where everyone and their mother has access to nukes
Im very contra war
Uh
I hate nationalism
I hope this isnt true cause thats some messed up shit
https://twitter.com/businessinsider/status/1239196106787033088?s=19

use it as a bio weapon on him
even for his standards
either im missing some context or thats a really fucked up response
did he really react to the lack of uk counter measures with "expect to lose loved ones"??
also what the fuck was up with boris johnson yesterday
just curious
is he on crack?
like in germany we have a bunch of people who literally just watch other peoples content for a living and live on a tax exile island üôÉ
and lets be honest reaction videos are 99% not fair use
ye
im just that bisexual who smiles and nods when ever discussions about this stuff start
I think sapphic just means wlw but idk shit about this stuff tbh
lets just ignore that female lesbians have historically been using he/him on occasion
like that shits just disgusting
im mostly angry about hiding pronouns behind a paywall
GOOD LUCK HABIBI
like some stuff gets easier or more comfy but theres just such a ridiculous amount of shit you need to know
computer science in general is getting more and more complicated
yeh
go with the times old man
im surprised by how many companies still use SVN
good like finding that
sure buddy
"looking for senior fullstack dev ops project manager who also does UX design"
this shit is ridiculous
watched a video about job ads today
really sucks that most are just looking for seniors
Hes gonna contradict it next week for sure
As if
Wtf am I reading
oooooof
https://twitter.com/LackingSaint/status/1347218197926338567
Im just praying so hard everything gets well soon
Why does it work the way it does
Like fuck fascism its so bullshit
It was kinda to be expected but its still frustrating
I like that 1 episode of hannibal has made it into the top 10
crazy
o yeah ive seen this today
That novel sounds like a fever dream
*insert giorno in disney world meme*
I mean yeah
The thing with GER is that the actual fight happens before GER
^good read
dang my friends would go on a full ass rant if they saw your GER slander
but its been  a while
ive played the 5Ds tagforce games but I dont remember something like that
