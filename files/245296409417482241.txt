Right, was just trying to get a quick pic now
Gotcha, I need to try and find a Kabuto one as well, the store near me only has Luna Trigger and Cyclone Joker now
The loose chest of the metal side will make that hard, and I do want to do posing better
Curious, how so?
It is
Sadly the upper torso part of the Metal side is too loose and falls off easily not sure how to fix that
I actually have a hard time knowing if others are serious or joking most the time
Oh, sorry I’m not he best at knowing when others are joking sometimes even happens in person
Not sure why
all the Double ones was $41.99
$49(including tax) I also got a clipper to get the parts off the plastic as well, $37.99 USD for the Zi-O alone
Thanks, the store I got it from had the first three forms of W as well so may pick one of those up after my next paycheck
Eye stickers was a little weird to do
Finally finished, really enjoyed doing it
I really like putting all the parts together as well
Really enjoy them though
I only got my first model kit yesterday as well
Thanks
I apologize for the terrible posing I did for this one as well
No new Kamen Rider ones there yet, already bought the four they had
Last time I tried to get her they sold it a little bit before I got there, and they got her in today
Another model kit
They do look kinda similar
Still pending right now
Oh wow
I’m not sure if it was not a kit, this was years ago like early 2000’s
It was small like chibi
Never knew what it was back then
Interesting, i did remember recently when I was way younger like elementary school i had a mini gundam figure toy, the one with the shield with a yellow star with only four points on it and the purple sword. I wish I could find that specific figure again
Still kinda new sorry
I’m not sure there was some weapon ones, I may have to look on their site more
If I were to look for the one I got
The add on ones I saw had the main mech types on the boxes so that confuses me some
I’m kinda confused why you said frixk, but I really like it so far, how customizable they are with the other weapon kits and stuff I saw at the store
Texas, they employee told me it was a Facebook group thing
And I can get a 10% for joining my states gunpla club at the store I buy the kits at
Thanks, I did notice the symbols next to the names so didn’t know if that meant anything
So the box shows other accessory kits can work with it, how do I know the ones that can and can’t
I have no idea what she is from, I just thought the box art was cute

Is there any good sword poses I could do with the double bladed option or any
So since I only have one I am unable to do much I assume
I kind have no idea how to use those extra parts
Right, trying to figure out a pose for when holding the swords when double bladed
I picked this one up
Hey Quartz1739 may I DM you kinda have awoke questions about some weapon kits
Could I ask for a pic of the box or something so I know which to look for, sorry
I will, just gotta wait till next pay day, and recommendations for core gundams for it?
I know I don’t have the right one for it but still why not try
Finished yay
Sadly can’t hold the shield and lance thing in both hands cause crab arm
I saw this one in Seltsam’s instructions so i got it since no crab
Next time they have it in stock I will get it, but I got this instead
Sad news, they had sold the arm
Crab arm it is
But on another hand I can spend the same $12 and get a weapon kit that isn’t an arm
Just $12 with the 10% off for being in my states gunpla club so maybe
Kinda tempted to get the Blue “Seltsam arm” kit, and just have it with two weird arms, but not sure if that would be worth it or not
Says “Gundam Seltsam Masked Man’s Mobile Suit” on the box and I haven’t watched it yet but will so not sure if it is that person or not
Tired and don’t feel like putting effort into posing at the moment
The rifle is way bigger than I thought it would be
Thanks, I saw the one holding the rifle on the back of the box in the b&w product images so got the rifle since I had that one
Hmm?

I got the No-Name Rifle today, the pics on the box made it look smaller
Took a little over 3 hours to finish
I like the colors of it
Got this one today
And I only finished 1 of 4
Took me three hours
Just got it today
No English in the instructions for this one, but managed

I have the Impulse Gundam Lancier, andjust need to figure out what configuration I want both Impulse Gundams to be ins
I started these three back to back at 5:30 Pm and just finished at 1:30 am
That’s my third similar one I got the first version of the one from 00/OO  and the version from build fighters I think it was
How it fits on the arm
The shield part on it is a little weird to me so not putting the parts that make the shield in shield mode

And it currently is where the left wing should be
The 02 sticking should be on the right wing facing the front
I just noticed I’m an idiot, I put the wings on the blue and white one when I put them back on after the whole robo dragon thing
Currently trying to distract myself from upcoming fun-eral stuff
I don’t have one of the stands with me currently so can’t take a pic of it in flight mode
I liked how the second one went together with the upper body
Got these yesterday

I got this one maybe early last month so yeah been avoiding finishing those
Currently working on the stickers I’ve been putting off for a while
I may end up getting the gundam markers to make the claws yellow
Am curious how these two are related since they share the Barbatos name
Just finished the Barbatos Lupus Rex
Thanks, any special kind of tape?
I have a question, when using the Gundam markers what should I do to make sure I don’t get the marker stuff on an area it shouldn’t be when it is all one part but have to put the color a specific part?
Not a fan of the (too much) gold and green version so getting each part individually
Do also have 1 of the 4 that make the RE:RISING GUNDAM so far
Not sure why but I thought it was going to be extremely similar to the AgeII Magnum SV ver. But glad it wasn’t
Decided to get the one on the left yesterday
Feel like it’d be better to have that version though, cause the two small parts on the head like to come off and not really secure
I don’t think it is that one, this one is MS-06S ZAKU II [Red Comet Ver.]
Done suffering! Yay... tiny stickers... put those off for a few months
I‘ve done about 24-25 other gunpla and 4 Kamen rider ones and 2 chibi Fate ones
Those look very cool
I really likes how different the knee engineering is on this one compared to previous ones I did
Finally finished... after things kept going down hill all afternoon and evening
Does sound like fun to me, but like I won’t stop for anything once I start even food
Like maybe2-3 am
Going to get the RG one on Saturday last time I had more than one at a single time I was hyper focused for hours and didn’t sleep until way after midnight
I will, I’ve done a bunch Just bad with multiple choices
I usually just follow the instructions for now
I’ll probably do that one then, if I want I can visit the store Saturday and get the RG one
Like one at $30 and the other at $35 and then a 40% off that price
Thanks, didn’t see the no glue symbol I saw on others, but now not sure whether to go with that one or AMS-123X-X Moon Gundam
Question about a certain Gundam does the RG Wing Gundam Zero EW 1/144 require glue?
Finally finished the stickers
<:2D_O2Wow:759144114285182986>
Admiral can I dm you? Or not that’s alright
I do have 1 of the 4 that make the Re rising Gundam, not exactly a fan of the golden color version set for two reasons too much gold, and cause of that too much gold it would be a night mare to find the right gold piece on all the gold things when putting it together
I got Jalter and Mashu, put Nero on a secret Santa list so hope that was one of the things that arrived, can’t open until Christmas
I sadly don’t have a stand on hand so can’t pose it at the moment
That one looks pretty cool
I chose this one instead, not knowing much about the Skygrasper
Makes me wish I bought the RG Skygrasper today
I Don’t think hobby lobby is served by bluefin but I found the piece luckily so don’t need to now
The stickers for the sandals and back didn’t stick and need to get a black marker for the sword
Not gunpla but finished my third mini FGO kit
Found it luckily, it was outside the room
I’ll keep looking incase it is here then
Lupus Rex
This part of the hand
Is there anyway to get replacement pieces for gunpla without buying the whole kit again? While I wasn’t home the last week a family member let the kitten into my hobby room and a few gundams were knocked over and one is missing a piece for the hand
I’ll be sure to keep an eye out for the RG strike
Is there any kits the go along side that one?
I definitely enjoyed it, the horse was definitely different than I was used to

Never would have guessed that an actual horse piloted it
I’ll have to check that out
First time I saw one with a horse/mount type thing
This one looked interesting
I’ll get some when I get it then, thanks
Is there any type of glue you recommend?
That one require glue? Been tempted to get it
I am trying to finish my Fake v(?) unit, just need the weapon kit for that one
Thanks, I want to make sure I get the right one
Odd question but which Gundam kit does the MERCUONE UNIT kit go with specifically
Once I get those kits going to put them together, they do have the special bundle version with all four in that gold plastic but too much gold for me
They have the regular Valkylander at the shop but need the EX one specifically
The top of my list is Uraven Gundam, Wodom Pod, and EX Valkylander
Since my hobby store doesn’t have any of the kits I’m looking for atm I decided to give these two a try
And why these two have different designs but a set
Kinda confused what the HG X S.H.Figuarts is
Just noticed the b mode pic is blurry but oh well already sent
A and B mode

And both combine into a bike with two different modes
The stickers it comes with is for the both kits that this one is a part of
Partially finished this one, need to finish the weapons and then the stickers
Question what’s the visual difference between acrylic and enamel paint markers
Thanks, going to try and get them, they look cool
As well as the first Dino looking one posted earlier
What kits are those, might have to find some myself
May order from BBTS
~~kinda want to get the windblade one at one point~~
Finished my first Transformers Model kit, was the cheapest one with the sale so that’s why I picked up this one
Have they made any of the other Fake versions? I heard that there was I think 2 others in the show
Finally finished the Fake ν unit and weapon set, had been looking for the weapons for months
How do those even get painted? Like the seem so small and hard
Oooo those look epic

Not sure why I never got this one until now
Does it include an alternate head for the “Violent emotion” version?

Ore Sanjou!
Right, so is it packaged a specific way so nothing gets mixed up? Like where this bag has the things needed for this one and this other bag has for this other one?
Also it looks harder to put together with how there is so much gold on all 4
For me it is just too much gold and not much variety in the colors, I think I put my thoughts into the right words just now but not sure
Is it alright to say I’m not a fan of how the kit for the gold and green rerising gundam looks? Like I really prefer the normal colors even though the gold and green is easier to find
2 out of 4 just have to find the Uraven Gundam and the Wodom Pod
I have to agree, so I just store the remaining parts in their boxes? And I think I can use the dragon one with the red weapon kit that is sold separately
Finally... keeping the shoulder pads parts are a pain in the ass to keep them from falling off and secure
An hour and 30 minutes later finished with the body and stuff.. will do weapons tomorrow... then probably put off the stickers for a few months then finish them... last time I had one with so many tiny stickers I didn’t start that part for months
Started again at 11 pm now 1 am got a second leg and waist down since earlier, and I put the core fighter in the chest frame to see how secure it would be when finished
Mhm!
The little core fighter is in the last pic
RG crossbone
Oh and I did start the Crossbone Gundam X1 yesterday, only have the core fighter and the left leg done so far
3 out of 4 complete just have to wait a few weeks for the Uraven to ship
Tried my best to recreate the rider kick in the little booklet
Nice
Interesting, I’m curious how it will look when finished
Yup
Not sure if it counts but did have to put parts together
Got this kit while waiting for a Decade Kit
I need to as well I only have up to 6 of the manga purchased currently, I want to have all volumes physical
It wasn’t as good as I remember from the first watch, the manga is the better version in my opinion
I even have my old iPhone four still with the background image of Ene for the cosplay
Ene is always a good choice
Nice, I actually have a shintaro cosplay
Rany is that Ene from the manga Kagerou Daze/anime Mekakucity actors as you profile pic?
Oh
Guessing this means I need to get rid of them not sure
Vstarz Enterprise
The company in the back is from Malaysia
Not sure if that means I should get rid of all of them then

I even have the Neptunia in the same way but it is only the Japanese dub
This is just normal dvd
Right
Now I’m worried, how do i know for sure
It has a flip open cover in the sleeve
Wait what
I think I may have found a good deal on this $8 for the full thing
The store is willing to give a refund but not sure if I should or not
It is only the very center and top part, the silver side is fine
The Neptunia one is fine subs are normal, but Disc 1 of Date A Live has a small crack in it around the center but works, just afraid to play it for a long period of time
Shiny
I guess I like the reflective text for the title part
I already know it will be disappointing from what was said
I’m just completely mixed now I was so excited when I got these now I just feel I don’t know
Thank you very much
Oh it saved as an mp4 somehow, it was a gif when they posted it
Any chance anyone can help find the anime source for a gif?
They are all sealed
Well the Maria x tsubasa one didn’t
I am going to try and get as many as I can, I didn’t know they came with cards from the Weis Schrawz game
Finally got some Symphogear CDs, got AXZ 03 Tsubasa and AXZ 04 Chris and G Maria X Tsubasa
Thanks a bunch
Sure if it’s not too much to ask
Thanks a bunch, I do have to ask where do you usually get the artwork? So I don’t ask too much each time I get new CDs
Thank you, currently opening discord in my browser so will save them in a second
Not sure where to ask but anyone got any high quality Symphogear cd artwork saved? I just imported the CDs to my laptop and didn’t include the artwork, the specific ones is AXZ Tsubasa, AXZ Chris, and G Maria & Tsubasa
Finally arrived
Just got the AXZ Hibiki cd and I didn’t notice the case is cracked a little bit until after I opened it
