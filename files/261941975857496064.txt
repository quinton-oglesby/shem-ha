don't mind me, been here before ðŸ‘‹
I know it's hot shots golf in USA
everybody's golf is the european name I think
european?
right now it's gravity rush, and sphinx and the cursed mummy
already have planned what I wanna play next
probably not gonna happen anytime soon on my end, sorry
same story with the other 700-ish games I have in there
I hear it's pretty good but I got it when I didn't have a pc so I never really bothered
I have that on steam but haven't played it
next target, gravity rush plat
and trophy hunting. help.
me? almost everything, but I'm biased towards difficult/retro games
you forgot 'show off' ðŸ˜ƒ
and occasionally write in roleplay forums
I'm more of a gaming person for sure
to be fair I rarely watch anime
oh, and sailor moon of course
symphogear, yuru yuri, and mai hime in my case
let's take a moment to relax and embrace our yuri lords
guess I'm still used to the old ones then
ah, I see
