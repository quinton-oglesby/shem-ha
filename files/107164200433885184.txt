workin on my bad luck

yeah i followed you Karu
i added a few of you who had space open
anyone got space?
i need to follow more people who do hard raids
i got 135k tonight
that boost to power and int chars is nuts
credd your x-driv bikki is no slouch either
i reconfigured my team for protos and am doing WAY better now
yeah affinity + a good healer seems to be the key to a long raid run
im 1 dupe away from MLB Fierce Maiden
Shocker mine looks about the same.
im kinda desperate for power giga crystals my luck has been garbage for them
Aly im hoppin on your power raid
putting up another power raid
i just added you
im putting up some hard power raids if anyone wants to help me out
ive got a couple hard raids up if people wanna tap em
im so close 1 power giga, 1 rainbow giga and 2 giga melody's to LU MDP Chris
hopping on it
yep got ya
space opened
sure
i'll look for yours aly
i just put one up too
Zerokuno i found and tapped your raid
Thank you guys so much for helping with the raids i put up today, finally got me the rest i needed for this
