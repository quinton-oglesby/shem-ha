There's better sub sandwich brands nowadays.
Now when it comes to subs, I stan Firehouse Subs üöí
Probably one of the only decent items from their menu IMO
Normally, I used to go there for their meatball subs.

Well...I guess I'm glad that I never ate their tuna sandwiches lol

It's kind of trivializing it.

No probs. It's always nice to see someone who is informed on this kind of stuff. üëç
Which is of course just another way to obfuscate responsibility any time conservative politicians are confronted with this topic
The typical conservative response and narrative I have seen is that the Dems were originally the KKK.
Basically.
It's always got to be the Southern states, does it?

I've watched through a lot of debate vids. Most of the ones I've watched are good and productive and others are basically internet bloodsports.

If we go by the definition of a breadtuber, those are people who make leftist video essays. I guess Contra fits that description? Although I feel that it's less of a community now and more like a select group of people IMO.
If there's one other "Breadtuber" I would also recommend AGAINST, that would be TheSerfs...
A bit of general chat is fine here <:GarieWink:336657101273169921>
I suppose my issue with those two debates I mentioned is that it basically revealed a fundamental flaw with Vaush where it boils down to this: It doesn't matter if a lefty content creator is lying or not. As long as they contribute to leftism, they are OK. If someone else wants to correct me on that, please do, but that's the impression I was left with and that ain't going to fly with me.
Same thing with Vaush, where after his most recent debates with Destiny, I had to take a hard look at myself and stop gravitating myself to these figures hardcore.
I see...

Understandable, yeah
Pretty much its main value especially on Twitch.
There's my two cents <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
I'm of the opinion that debates are important for discussing ideas. But it's extremely rare to find good-faith ones on the Internet.

What are the justifications for NFTs that you guys have seen?
So then what's the pro-NFT argument then (or why are people advocating it)?
Lol
So rather than buying the product, you're just buying its receipt...
Hmm
I don't think I've had that properly explained to me so far.
So then, what would be the argument as to why it's a scam?

lmao
%
Discord wont allow the use of the actual percentage sign...
Lol
At the end of the day, while I understand the problem with the dislike bar, I don't even know if getting rid of it is the best way of going about it.
Particularly any news vid related with COVID, politics, etc.
Comment sections in those vids are almost 90% of the time just.... <:SerenaDizzy:736605371912945736>
I can see that being applied to vids from mainstream news YT channels
Now to your credit
I would argue that for dislike bars, they would at least allow the public to see which vids are negatively perceived overall and see if it's worth watching.
I just don't think that this is the right move.
I mean is there any problem with showing the dislike bar?
It's to show feedback
Why...?
Uh oh

For me, it was around the time when I first heard of the US immigrant cages. That's when I had to say: "Okay, stop. You KNOW in your heart this is humanely wrong. Stop trying to play passive defense for the orangutan, you moron."
I guess the next question would be this: What was the turning point for your transition from the anti-SJW phase to the other side?
Or the constant sneering/mocking/memeing towards any form of progressivism in this country without any substantive engagement
Now all I see in that community is nothing more than just: "GET WOKE GO BROKE" nonsense
Had I not gone out of it sooner...I would honestly be veering on right-wing skepticism today IMO. It's actually insane how that pipeline works.
My anti-SJW phase lasted from around 2015-early half of 2018

Let's just say I have seen some online figures take this belief to its maximum...and well.
I don't disagree with the damage the US has done, but then saying things like what the US has done is worse than Russia or China, or any country makes me raise my eyebrows.
Sorry, but I just can't buy this whole "US is the ultimate evil" position.
Even after hearing Trump praise Putin's move, I still don't understand the main reasons for Republicans supporting Putin.
Sounds more like saying "We don't like pointless conflict." as a blanket statement.
Doesn't sound like a condemnation of Russia itself to me.

Perhaps the most toxic community I was in (for less than a month)
I see
Ahh
LDS?
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
Yeah you do need times of isolation
That's what I was saying, is to not be a lone wolf. Sorry if I miscommunicated that.
^
Hm
All I was trying to say was that being alone from general social communication is usually not the best thing.
That's true
Perhaps I didn't express this properly. I mean don't try to be alone all the time.
?
One thing I've always stood by: **Don't try to always isolate yourself.**
We have all been at our lowest points before.
Yeah.
^
?
I'm sorry, but Idk what else to say...
Right now, you are not in a healthy mindset.
What else am I supposed to say?
**LOG. OFF.**

But oof
There's certainly things to criticize about RWBY.
üëç
I see.
Bruh
When did that happen?

Glad to see you recovered from that.
I wouldn't bother reasoning with them
Pretty tight with their rules from what I've seen...
In there (100k+ subs)
As there are actual Yugitubers
To be clear, the other MD server I'm in (Master Duel Meta) seems to be a lot healthier to some degree
Ahh
You mean the game or...?
Let's just say in that particular server, I heard some...particular remarks about some race. I ain't delving anymore.
Whew...
<:HibikiDespair:688429715450757206>

‚ÄúFree speech is the bedrock of a functioning democracy, and Twitter is the digital town square where matters vital to the future of humanity are debated,‚Äù Musk said in a statement included in the press release announcing the $44 billion deal. ‚ÄúI also want to make Twitter better than ever by enhancing the product with new features, making the algorithms open source to increase trust, defeating the spam bots, and authenticating all humans.

I've been hearing some grumblings that apparently conservatives are going to have the advantage this year?
Don't forget we have the midterms coming up
Wait, did this fool have any opponents running against him?
That's literally the only response I can think of that's being vomitted by the ppl who voted for him.
"Hurr durr he was wrongly accused, bro! Take that, libcuck!"
And yet somehow idiots in that county voted for him?
Somehow, Indiana's laws don't *immediately* kick you off the ballot if you're in prison

Ik this is pretty late for me posting this, but just thought some awareness would be nice <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
Hence the trending hashtag
Basically the gist of this mess
Really the important things are that he's a false copyright striker and YouTube does nothing about him and his ban evasion
<:GenjuroThumbsUp:336657189475188740>
**CW: Alex Jones-tier transphobia**
<:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>

Act Man's most recent Quantum TV vid got removed.
Btw
Great.
But yeah, false copyright striker and a bigot
<:KirikaDisgust:688431636043268097>
Basically Alex Jones lite when it came to gay people.
At least one of his rambles was
And also apparently he's one of those crazy fundamental right wingers too?
Oh yeah, that was a thing
Basically YouTube either being incompetent or corrupt af
So...yeah.
Then every channel covering the quantum tv situation gets demonetized or affected in some way
But now it turns out YouTube says there is nothing wrong with Quantum TV and does nothing about his ban evasion
Then it turns out quantum tv has previously made some insane homophobic remarks in the past and is known for ban evasion for hate speech
Then quantum TV decides to call Act Man's mother in order to end it all while still issuing false copyright strikes (might as well be doxxing at that point)
Act man steps in and criticizes him too
Then he gets criticized
Basically quantum tv makes a bad elden ring review. Small youtuber criticizes him. False copyright strike

Here's a what I found about the whole thing
If you want the TLDR of the whole thing
Creators including asmongold also got affected by this too...
I'm curious to hear what your guys' thoughts are on the whole #JusticeForActMan situation...

Ask the anti-SJW crowd lol

Apparently it's about defeating "woke culture"
Not just owning the "libs"
<:GarieLaugh:740956278163243050>
This mindset actually pisses me off ngl
This is what happens when you go *full libertarian*
Look I ain't a big fan of the government, but can we at least agree that some government oversight is **actually good**?
Libertarian brain rot
Every single response usually goes along the line of "The government shouldn't be responsible for what people do!"
Prepare for every single conservative/libertarian centrist talking point imaginable
95% of them are playing the enlightened centrist smfh
Very few people are willing to even address his points lol

Libertarians, man
Eh, prob the more grifty or hardcore ones IMO
Which senator is that? <:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
<:MikuWorry:672908523495227432>
*Sigh*
But honestly?
I still don't believe in not voting, but said votes can be put towards somewhere else IMO
Which I approve
You can make a message basically stating "Fk the duopoly"
You want to go and vote third party? Go right ahead.
But smfh
Maybe I've had too much hopium for the current politicians besides AOC and others
I'm done trying to give a sliver of hope to libs <@504069701911969803>
Yeah fk it
Wtf they have done
I'm waiting for any libs to even try to tell me
Wtf have democrats have done to stop the conservatives
Now I have to ask myself
I apologize if I sounded like I'm defending Democrats, but my main personal gripe is that it implies that both are equally destructive. But no, fk it.
Idk
Isn't the SCOTUS majority full of conservative judges?
Thinking about it rn actually
...Was that necessary?
Nope, I ain't voting 3rd party (or at least I haven't considered it yet).
There's no denying that
Are the democrats doing a garbage job? Yes.
That's how I see it
Ngl, I ain't a big fan of this attitude. I understand the sentiment, but I'd still argue conservatives are still objectively worse than liberals no matter how you put it IMO.
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>

So to summarize, Indonesian politics rn is a shtshow.
What a mess.
Welp
Damn
If the republicans needed an extra boost for the midterm elections, smfh this was that. **A biiig one**
Oof, what's going on over there?
At the very least, we have a few politicians like AOC to look up to, but...ouch.
**Anyways**
I can't
Yeah
Otherwise
I don't think I need to think too hard about that decision
And um
As much as I hate the dems rn, I've seen what conservatives can do compared to liberals
Honestly tho? It's all about picking your poison in this electoral system
Same here tbh
I don't want to be fed the same old "Let's have a civil conversation" response *every time something like this happens*
I'd really like some smartass twitter liberal try to explain to me why tf this is fine.
Again if it looked like I was defending democrats, let me make it clear that I've got no love for them either and after this?
No...
Omg please stop...

So I think reading this UN article is actually kind of important
This article basically explains the harsh reality in a way
Yeah
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
The truth hurts
Well
As fked up as it is
If you actually think about it
Despite that title...
I can tell you it doesn't advocate for hunger
Actually yes
And...*unfortunately there are parts in here that are NOT wrong.*
So I'm actually reading this article
<:ElfneinPalm:672430572961923092>
<:HibikiDespair:688429715450757206>
Uhhhhh
<:HibikiThink:688429715362414641>
<:ChrisAngry:336656958272700417>
I've seen the different argumentations of libs/neolibs and....
I want to clear: Do I advocate for **anything** said in this article? NO. I'd be an actual sociopath for doing that.
Unfortunately, yes
Also, fk anyone that says "We actively need hunger!" or anything of the sort that implies it from a moral stance.
This
No ofc not
Yep
Boy, do we have a variety of answers for them
This article asks a whole bunch of questions as well
If we're talking about the results for hungry ppl working in fields, etc. (Produce, goods) and keeping enough, then that's technically positive...but in the worst way imaginable (this might as well be negative i suppose). But as a whole, anyone who actually thinks hunger is a social positive value and is something we *should* keep around is either an insensitive pos or an out of touch ass.
> Positive value
Put it simply, address the points.
I lay it out so that we can all counter it
Me laying out the argument doesn't mean that I actually want to make said argument.
Exploitation
<:HibikiSad:738234648509022368>
Again, I see it as an explicit description of the why hard labor persists today...and it doesn't have to be this way, but here we are.
Fair enough
I never saw the article as actually advocating for hunger
Yeah
But if you think about it, hunger is kept around to continue labor
Because the way I see it, it's more like the disgusting truth
Is it false though?
<:ShirabeStare:582381430915596289>
Doesn't sound like all of us bothered to
I hope we're all reading past the title

<:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
Hope Abe recovers. That is all.
Smfh
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
And yet he's commenting on Japanese politics as an outsider with no knowledge (I assume)
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
Apparently that also includes butting in to every single topic, including foreign matters
<:ElfneinPalm:672430572961923092>
Why tf is this idiot putting his 2 cents into the Abe situation?

How would you summarize all of that simply?
<:ChrisRead:688429724334161987>

Oh yeah we can definitely condemn what the British empire has done
That the average normie is unaware of unfortunately
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
Well alright then
They all go something like this: "With the recent passing of Queen Elizabeth II we understand that many of you have strong feelings about this, however we ask that all discussion around the passing of the queen be kept civil and respectful. Failure to do so will result in a timeout."
I believe the measure is to mainly stay neutral about the whole thing. At least that's what I assume
True
I've already two servers with a warning on this
Atm
Supposedly it's a topic ppl feel strongly about
I'd personally like to not meme about the whole thing honestly
Already some servers are cracking down hard on this
Do we go ahead and ban ppl for making memes on the subject of Elizabeth?

I'm just talking about in the context of the conflict with Russia atm
Yeah lol
At the same time, we get a bunch of other ppl calling him an outright traitor as a result of this. An unfortunate outcome, but it's what it is
Either way I'm expecting the right to weaponize this as pro-Russian sentiment <:HibikiTired:422925410490253313>
I can imagine that, yeah
Tbf I don't fully know of his living situation, so that might as well be the case
But he's going to take the invading side...
I can probably understand the anti-American sentiment he may be harboring
But then I read this
Look, maybe I can somewhat respect what Snowden is known for

<:MikuWorry:672908523495227432>
Maybe I'm jumping the gun here a bit, but please do clarify...
I guess we should just erase all RWBY art then if you're going to go down this logic of supporting RWBY in any way is creating "future harm"?
So should all RWBY fan art and fan projects be abandoned as a result then? Would the ideal solution then is to just drop **everything** RWBY related (costumes, etc.)?
If you're a hardcore RT ~~simp~~ fan I guess lol
<:nko_derp_drool_dumb:987147024656900106>

<:MikuWorry:672908523495227432>
Just checked the comments of the video Kdin's referring to and it seems that she actually tried to push all of this under the rug ASAP...?
Apologizing for this twice...
"Ive apologized publicly before, & Id like to apologize again as I shouldve known better then & do know better now."
<:HibikiTired:422925410490253313>
...Damn it, Florida.
Just found that out
This was actually previewed over a year ago
But as a sold product for retail? **Big NO.**
Yeah I would say if this was restricted to usage in museums for example as you said (educational purposes), I guess I could possibly tolerate it...?
Not to mention the fact that the developers who made this are *French*, not American...
Is it outlandish for me to say that this comes off as tone-deaf and/or profit-driven?
Any other thoughts here?
I'm very skeptical about doing that via VR, especially via *Meta's Oculus*
But
Having ppl who weren't around or aware of 9/11 understand the severity of the event at the time is not a bad intent.
Well then.
Previously posted Hale's statement, but here's a vid as well
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9VmfFcyhbs
Gotcha
Yeah I understand
Alrighty then
So then what phrase would you replace this with, if you can think of one?
How so? Just a quick explanation as to why, that's all
How do you feel about the phrases "Innocent until proven guilty" and "Guilty until proven innocent"?
Like I said, she might be bound by some weird contract in that case, but Idk for sure, so we'll have to see.
If she doesn't, well that could mean a number of things, but the most charitable interpretation would be that she might have a problem finding other employment or anything else about her living condition, etc. or some weird contract
Ah ok
Not aware of that but alright
If it is true that she was actually offered *more than $4,000*, well then that's a shame.
Yeah there's a decent amount of skepticism against Helena atm
I've seen this take also pop in other conversations like the ongoing Amouranth situation and wondering if you guys have any qualms about this take. Sounds reasonable enough I suppose
"I don't believe Helena yet until I hear from the other side and see what they have to say. Wait for both sides of the story."
Here's another take I've been hearing and I'll paraphrase it as best as I can and you guys can give me your thoughts about this one:
Yang's VA dropped out from what I heard
(Though that's being way too hopeful)
(And/or complete overhaul of the damn company)
*Cancellation of RWBY's 9th season*
You want to hear what I hope for?
But ultimately, let's not have this distract from the actual main convo we should be having.
It's good that she did address it again when brought up publicly for the second time
Yeah, I don't know what else Kdin needs to do asides from looking for new employment.  I'll echo a bit of Mel's point here in that there's really no other forms of accountability left for her besides maybe abhorrence since she already addressed this years back from what I've heard.
Watch as they all parrot "MSM lies"

On a separate note
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
That's my take if you're interested regarding that scenario
I would say that's a crime for sure, but depending on the person, if it's a middle class Karen (or Kevin), lol. If it's some homeless person, then I might want to start paying more attention to the inequality around the area if they're potentially struggling to feed themselves.
Only thing I'll say to that is this and I'll be done with the topic:

At least they seem to understand that trying to fence sit on the Russian invasion of Ukraine doesn't do anything productive.
I suppose not <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>

The term "pull yourself up by the boostraps" couldn't fit a more proper crowd like the Elon Musk cult
"Look at me, guys! All I have to do is work hard so that I can be just like him!"
To the point where it's actually disgusting
And conservative circles and anti-SJW talking heads salivate at the idea of total ~~preferential~~ free speech
Or the pro "free speech" crowd
From what I can tell, almost everything that he preaches caters towards the libertarian type folks
<:ChrisOi:586551700987576330>
It's also telling that some of the Musk fanboys in the replies outright say that being consistent with their own principles regarding free speech is a "losing fight"

Bozo 1: "If he is a fraud, then how did he manage to lead companies that created the best rockets and self driving cars that humanity has ever seen so far?

If spaceship flies, which it likely will, it will be revolutionary for humanity. Do his degrees and illegality still matter then?"
 Bozo 2: "Cool. Where is the one on Biden, someone infinitely more vital to have all the correct facts about since he's, you know, running our country? I'll be waiting for the link."

Many other excuses, but you get the point
I'll give you a few quotes:
Or just say Idgaf

In more neutral terms, here's what it says
<:mokokoDerp:865059158189539379>
https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/cancel%20culture
Unless if it's said in good faith or with genuine attitude, then it's another buzzword
But just like with free speech
I would argue that real "cancel culture" exists to some degree
Don't forget the term "cancel culture" too
<a:_sip_:1039305742894759977>
Then it's basically what Rakhi just described
You see libertarian ppl or right-leaning folks try to invoke that
But
Free speech itself is good.

There's another term to look out for in this context: wood-chippers.

Hm?
Which studies?
The burden of proof is on you, not us.

A specific event in which "primitive communism" was successful ffs
Do you really want us to go back to the ages of tribes and hunters and gatherers in the caveman days?
???
We're asking for a specific event
Not a phenomenon
An event
"All of humanity" is NOT an answer
Enough of the generalizations
Specifics?
Any event? Major event?
???
If we're about to sit here and start defending what Stalin and Mao did...**NO.**
Oh boy
Jeez....
**Forget any possibility of a revolution happening, please. And stop trying to talk down on ppl who are trying to make a change.**
Like Lank and Fuwa are promoting
I agree Cypher
But not for the most hyper radical ideas
Yeah I'm all for change
I don't bother about trying to end all exploitation, since that's effectively impossible. We can certainly mitigate it and reduce it as much as possible
Yup
You should have no problem providing proof to us
If you're that confident
Then give me **one of those papers** from said field.
Point to like an actual study? Link? Any named event? Something, man
That' ain't specific enough
All you are providing are vague and general examples. We asked for specifics
<:HibikiTired:422925410490253313>
I could go on, but the last thing I'll end on is that I possess a reformist mindset. While I see some utility in bringing radical change, there has to be some ways without utterly resorting to violent means. That is all. Done with this convo. Finished.
Back to the books, Broomy
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
Yeah <:nko_sweat:985375278270414849>
You advocate for social change alongside with the other changes
Relying solely on social change is not the way to go. Ofc.
But it's still worth trying to do ON top of the other meaningful changes to make
Obviously relying on solely social change is not a great option
Meaningful social change is meaningful change at the end of the day
Just minutes ago, you said fighting for greater equality within capitalism is immensely useful. Which is it?
Now I ain't going to sit here and be a capitalist simp, let's get that straight. I could rip into capitalism if I wanted to rn
If you want my stance, we can still make meaningful change within the system. It's fine to go above and beyond, but we shouldn't try to say fk trying to do this and such because you're still under capitalism.
This
But a tool regardless
I still need to read that paper
Are we not allowed to at least vote for who we want? Push for legislation?
That's literally the conclusion that it ultimately leads to.
That's what I'm hearing rn
So what then? Should we just stop trying to fight for equal rights in the US rn?

You might find one smooth convo here and there, but expect a bunch of shitposting, etc.
Tho let's be real, is Twitter really the place for any intellectual discussion?
<:mokokoDerp:865059158189539379>
Well Star, if you're talking about Twitter or other social media, of course that's always going to be the case that you'll be confronted on your political takes.
Ah
As in, people getting blasted for saying anything that's *slightly* to the right?
<:nko_cash_money:987139361378271263>
That too as well...
<:nko_think_confused:985649489941504000>
<:nko_sip_milk:985374672956850246>
Or...King?
I haven't heard of Candy Crush in a long time lol
It's probably the fact that CoD gets more mainstream attention than the other two games you listed
Bye bye Bobby
I mean, if the acquisition results in that, well good I suppose
The way I see it is that hatred of Blizzard runs so damn deep that it clouds the YT gaming audience's judgment to the point where they will grasp on to anything to spite the company, regardless of the authenticity of their intentions.
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
General takeaway is, yes Blizzard is nasty, but Microsoft is a corporation at the end of the day, and I'm a bit pessimistic on betting on Microsoft to make a lot of substantial changes, should the deal go through somehow.
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
Almost everyone (related with gaming) on YT wants Microsoft to acquirer AB
And uh, all the comments I posted reflect the general YouTube consensus on this matter. Just fyi
Look, nobody questions how god-awful Blizzard is. But do we really need to go out of our way to simp for one company over the other...?
Tbh, this amount of hopium is kind of disturbing
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
> I actually want Microsoft to acquire Activision Blizzard so they can (hopefully) get on their ass for a better working environment because I refuse to buy any games from Activision until they are some changes made
This is where I found that comment section in case you're wondering
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHRSl9VNc6c&t=37s
<:nko_hmm_wat_what_sus:985396960225820683>
How would you describe these ppl then?
I'm bringing this up because I've mostly seen positive support of the acquisition online
It sounds like they assume that whatever Microsoft is going to do will somehow change Blizzard because...Blizzard giga bad, change ASAP or w/e?
<:MikuWorry:672908523495227432>
What are our thoughts on ppl *in support of Microsoft's acquisition*?

In that they *really did not take this news kindly*
From a YT commenter, but reflects the general consensus of the gaming audience surrounding this news
Then on the other side, I get this reaction (In the comment section of Asmongold's reaction to this):
> Sony and Microsoft buy tons of companies, MS even boasting about it at E3
> Feds: zzzzzzz
> Disney and WB basically have a duopoly on the movie industry
> Feds: zzzzzzz
> Microsoft wants to buy ABK
> Feds: PROTECT BOBBY!!!
<:ChrisRead:688429724334161987>
I've seen this one pop up a few weeks ago
Or another way of asking, why would Microsoft's acquisition of Activision-Blizzard be a bad thing?
May I ask why this is a good thing?
Yup
<:nko_derp_drool_dumb:987147024656900106>
At least that's my impression of it
Can literally put on some cheap shovelware app and it will stay on there for quite some time
Just seems like anything goes for these app stores
And the process of "vetting" mobile games on their storefront
Or chalk that up to the management of the Google Play Store

Let's go down this line
Okay then. Which event in Poland then?
Anything?
Examples?
Give me some events?
Specifically in what way is Democracy shit?
**I have yet to see that from you, Broom.**
If you're this confident in that stance, you should be able to break it down to macro-level examples
I'll ask you this directly then: Why was it hard for you to bring up specifics then (or any specific examples)?
Feel free to correct me
So, tell me if I get the definition of decentralisation right: **It's when you delegate authority to the lowest levels of management.**
Hm
Just link me one üôÇ
Any prominent examples?
I'm not too caught up on "decentralization" movements
Any examples of this? üëÄ
Alright, see you then. Nothing personal against you btw
Eh fair enough lol

<:nko_rage_angry_mad:985396320116281384>
I absolutely despise dealing and arguing with generalities for hours on end.
I mean, it shouldn't be hard for them to get specific examples if they are that confident in that stance, but oh well
The onus is on you now
You can't just expect ppl to just look it up for you.
Go ahead. Anything that depicts what you are trying to argue here
Articles?
Source?
Any law names? Events? Articles?
Give me specific legislation or something
Come on
Specify that

I've got nothing concrete here on that aspect
So we can't make any strong judgments on whether this was a hate crime or not
Possibly, but we don't know for sure at this point in time
Staff should come instead
Fair enough
Then again, it's Twitter
I'll be blunt here: making this as racially motivated is baffling
Looks like Amtrak is well within their rights to kick them off <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>

Don't answer with another question.
<@171395487247630336> Can you at least answer Matt's question?
Definitely something to consider
Fair enough then
But why here?
Well if the person objectively becomes violent or poses a threat while refusing the leave the train, then you call the cops
Again, where tf are the staff...
I'll withhold judgment at this point, but for crying out loud...
Circumstances are just...why?
I still stand by the fact that we need to wait for the full facts to come out, but smh
Tho one could argue about the health and safety aspect but again
At best, whoever made the police call is a cranky karen
Now I can't say 100% that's racially motivated again...*but* I wouldn't be totally surprised if it was
Yeah that is a VERY disproportionate response
<:MikuWorry:672908523495227432>
*The staff wasn't called to resolve the issue. The police were.*
I think it's just my logic brain that's going through this, but watching this multiple times now
I'm inspecting the video rn
And I'll look at it
Any source or anything that strongly highlights this
I'm just asking for evidence
Source that.
Are you able to read their minds? No.
Once again, assumptions
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
Evidence?
Wait for the facts to come out.
Don't assume things right off the bat like this.
You don't know for sure if the call was racially motivated. AT ALL.
<:HibikiTired:422925410490253313>
But honestly wouldn't be too surprised if updates start confirming this
I'll repeat that I don't fully see this as a racially motivated situation.......yet.
I'd at least like to know what happened prior to this
If anyone else here gets updates, post them here
But post any updates to the story here
Situation is kinda fked at the end of the day
Look, without going deep into too many legal and moral complexities here
Then you get into moral weeds and um yeah
But not ESA

But what happened to GF Reviews was still wrong (and strange that this article didn't even show the logs themselves so that we could all see it)
It's most definitely pro-Rowling ammo unfortunately
How fucking hard is it to say, "Don't go after other streamers for playing the game?"
Reading this right now
<:TsubasaNeutral:688429723205894149>
"Nuanced piece"
<:cat_sweat:991559971076591676>
Yeah that response was disappointing, but not unexpected
Obviously more of that within the first hour of the stream, but
Like I said, it's a guess
That's my guess
Perhaps
So looks like they are playing the full game to fully (or properly) review it
As far as I know, they are a review channel
And around that timestamp is where you're going to hear their responses
<a:nko_bongo:985418797798289428>
https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1730177330
It's a long arse game
Nope, they continue to play it
1:01:00, you're welcome
So from what I can tell, their reactions seem to be from their observations of twitch chat throughout the first hour and they eventually address it 1 minute after
So right around the first hour of the stream
1:01:00 is where it starts
I think I found it
Wait
<:HibikiTired:422925410490253313>
Does Twitch even show you the timestamp of clips?
Yeah I'm trying to find the timestamp too lol
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
7+ hours long <:nko_lost:985372012581101729>
Still trying to find the exact timestamp of that clip to get more context
Or at least it starts there I think?
Well if you really want to know, it's within the first hour of GF Review's stream of Hogwarts Legacy
Criticism is fine, actual harassment ain't.
<:nko_hmm_wat_what_sus:985396960225820683>
I should have specified that as "harassed"
And that's the part where she cries off stream (not audible)
I think you might be able to know
It fucking doesn't balance that out at all, fr
So these responses are not surprising
Exactly
But
I don't think they are malicious
My view on GF Reviews is a bit damaged ngl
So um
<:HibikiTired:422925410490253313>

Yeah I would bet the most of the actual harassment comes from Twitter, not Twitch. Idk
Politics bad <:nko_derp_drool_dumb:987147024656900106>
Didn't see a lot of the comments that were qualified as actual harassment tbh...but the gaming community says "politics bad" so <:nko_derp_drool_dumb:987147024656900106>
Maybe "wholesome" in the sense if you aren't politically informed
The Trevor Project
"Woke mob" is the new "SJW" term
<:nko_derp_drool_dumb:987147024656900106>
Meh, you do you then
Look, I'm not as hopeful about any major changes that said action will do. I wouldn't even be surprised if we saw the game at the game awards.
I mean if you want to do that, then go right ahead
Not particularly you?
Was agreeing with solopy
Yeah, trying to convince ppl to not play the game is a waste of time at this point, especially with its current perception being overwhelmingly positive thanks to streamers such as Asmongold, etc.
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
You can't really control how they spend their money
Honestly, I wouldn't bother trying to say "Don't buy this game". Just not worth the effort
At the end of the day, if that's their choice and they are that set on buying it, Idk what else you can do to change their minds.

<@331908049822547978> Just curious, did you post that without reading the full thread?
(Also smfh, the libertarian party replies <:nko_lost:985372012581101729> )
Kinda cringe, but an understandable sentiment from a Ukrainian soldier's POV <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
> This is Pavlo's story
That's coming from a soldier on the front lines, not NATO themselves
Yeah soldiers can be cringe
Given the situation he's in
Can you really blame that soldier?
Like I said
Same lol
I would need to see the full quote
But **NOT** in this instance
If you want me to talk about bad things about the US as well...would take me a good 1 hour or so to list everything. I can trash the US if you want lol
Rakhi is here, Hi
Nah, blame that on Lank
Can clearly tell lol. Oh well
Lank, you realize when the average Joe hears this, that builds up anti-Ukraine sentiment...during a time where Ukraine needs the support (rightfully so) in its efforts against Russia's invasion? Not everyone can read between the lines
Yup
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>

At first I did get some anxiety attacks time to time, but now?
I see WWIII trending on Twitter time to time
<:MikuWorry:672908523495227432>
That's about it
If you want my take, I'd say that it doesn't matter if NATO or the US is supporting Ukraine out of the goodness of their hearts. Believing such is as naive as believing companies care about consumers with good intentions. I'd rather focus my efforts on fighting back against Russia's invasion as the top priority and not constantly gatekeeping the support Ukraine gets.
I'm not opposed to nuance btw lol
Tbf, I can't always be a fence sitter <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
~~Hush~~
<:cat_sweat:991559971076591676>
But just so we are clear, that's all
Mostly everyone here didn't really buy into that tbf
Not explicitly
But blaming America for **everything** bad in society and in the world is just pure brain rot and destroys all meaningful conversations.
Is it the best country ever? No. (Unless you talk to diehard conservatives)
But just saying that it's not a knock against his character or efforts
https://www.reddit.com/r/KamenRider/comments/ou2m0t/kamen_rider_w_fuuto_tantei_will_be_animated_by/
On a separate note, Idk if it's just me, but I haven't been getting myself invested into any anime series right now...
Lol
Agreed, but didn't the producers (or writers, idk) also make some pretty spicy statements?
Okay
And with the ratings it's getting (reasonable or not), it's probably not going to go far.
üëÄ
Just one line though. I'm sure there's worse...
I think the point is more like how there's still background noise in that recording there and how they let that through.
I'm not expecting the best from this show...but come on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-2Ikj9TGnQ Then there's memes like...this.
On top of the inflated controversy surrounding it
Just something about it feels off to me.
BUT THE VOICE ACTING.
Animation is fine...
It's looking pretty bad.
Have not seen it yet but from the clips I have seen....
<:TsubasaDisgust:349013662775902209>
Alright. Anyone who's seen *High Guardian Spice* (or even just a bit of it): impressions and thoughts?
||Poor Yuuna <:HibikiHug:620080558462205956> ||
||New mode, but more heavy feels <:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616> ||
Just took a look at the most recent episode of Yuuki Yuuna Dai Mankai Shou.
<:KirikaCheer:689614085402525830>
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
Better question: Is this the right channel to discuss cartoons in general (anime and/or other pieces of animation)?
lol
Nothing is standing out to me asides from SAO: Progressive, but even that's just....eh.
If so, then it's expected
Is that side story content as well?
Has anyone here checked out Young Justice: Outsiders?
Lol
üëÄ
Most recent episode in particular..... <:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
So far I'm liking the third season
I think Yuuki Yuuna is underrated, Fire Force has great action, but that's about it lol
Just thoughts in general
Ik they arent isekai
Thoughts on the following: Fire Force, Yuuki Yuuna?
Never caught on to Dr Stone. Wish I had
Bookworm looks interesting enough
Not sure what you're trying to get at here...
Any *good* isekai series worth checking out?
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
I do
HGS is visually...okay. But I HATE the dialogue.
I'm not able to get through an episode without cringing. Sorry.
<:KirikaDisgust:688431636043268097>
I can't do it.
I tried watching a bit more of High Guardian Spice.
Okay.
SRW W
SRW DD
SRW T
lmao
üëÄ
üëç
If so, any series or show that sort of matches this sentiment?
Is this ever a valid critique?
Tell me if you guys have heard of this before: *"...this kind of comes off as if it was made by people who think they understand anime but don't, and then half-assed it*
Bad anime is still anime.
^
Agreed
(Also, this series is kinda terrible and meh at best lol.)
I was kind of surprised it was classified as an "anime".

One series I might extend this criticism to for example: Transformers War For Cybertron Trilogy on Netflix
For a couple of series, that criticism might be valid, but I try not to subscribe to this because while I do think the basic standards for making anime need to be adhered to, I also believe in creativity and variety of different anime styles.
Then there's people saying that it's made by people who think the producers (or writers) understand anime, but don't.
Same vibes I'm getting as well
But ofc you aren't allowed to like it *in any capacity* because...."wokeness". Okay. <:GarieLaugh:740956278163243050>
As for HGS, it's not something I'll likely dive into any further, but at least the animation is decent overall. Definitely looks a lot better than what I expected.
(Good, middle of the road, bad)
So Idk what's the general opinion around it atm
Can't say much about RWBY besides the fact I stopped watching after season 5
Although I have to ask, is RWBY's current reputation really bad atm or...?
Overall, I actually thought the video was fine overall.
Lol
That being said, I'm glad that others find things to like about it <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
Considering this is the same guy that (I assume) goes **super** hard on RWBY, this was somewhat a bit of a surprise coming from him.
Oof
Are we also including animation as well, not just the scripts and VAs?
But I would need some sources or articles
I guess there's credence to that claim...?
Not sure if that's even the case. Like, was that reasoning ever confirmed...?
At least that's the vibes I get every time I look up search results for HGS
Not explicitly, but definitely heavily implied
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phaDpLHG6n4
||That one hit HARD. <:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616> ||
Part 5 had the best dub out of all the parts IMO
Which part had the best dubs?
Probably the first non-dbz dubs I have seriously sat down and listened to
üëÄ
How do we feel about jjba dubs?
Shame we don't get Nanoha content anymore. Otherwise, great shows.
And yet I don't hate him...
Yuya is the worst YGO protag. <:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
<:HibikiWow:738172615453048912>
How is it compared to the anime?
üëÄ
So. Terrible manga and anime.

A Discovery+ merger

Some merge decision or something
Warner Bros. Discovery
Poor JG Quintel, man
*Close Enough*
*OK KO*
Not like that was the best show or anything, but him as well?
<:KirikaWhat:671948299179130885>
Uncle Grandpa too??
<:GarieLaugh:740956278163243050>
Merging deal
Apparently it's a "temporary" removal...
https://twitter.com/KingslandColin/status/1560609814044082176
Unless if the film can do some innovative things to the whole forbidden love trope/plot
Too predictable and/or generic IMO
<:HibikiThink:688429715362414641>
And they picked fire and water of all things
Most likely yeah
*Forbidden love*
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
Fire and water + forbidden love
Apparently this is stirring a bit of discourse as well...
Don't know where else to put this but here
What are our thoughts on this? https://twitter.com/PopCrave/status/1568388810957799424
<:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
Haven't watched the show in full either, but seeing it get another season is still great news to me
https://twitter.com/DanaTerrace/status/1570086401588473856
Well then.
<a:ChrisAniPeek:736921566570479616>
Any fans of Owl House here?
<@331908049822547978>
As a heads up, just don't spread any garbage this cartoon brew dude spreads. Please.

I like the OP music. Void Chords music with other singers slaps
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
<:ChrisHappy:660870796696223744>
Still reliant on a very generic plot that was pitched to us, but if they can expand on that and be creative and innovative with this movie, then it might be pretty decent.
Okay, not too bad

Whew
Ah I see
THAT show?
<:KirikaDisgust:688431636043268097>
<:MariaSunglasses:336656798687690752>
It produced Razor, who was a badass
The GL show was alright tho
There's several of them
WHICH Spider man show???
Which Spider Man show tho
<:CarolTheFuck:617036187319795722>
<:SerenaDizzy:736605371912945736>
Anything noteworthy about them?
I don't know any of those guys
AND in the comics
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
Uh who?
What a glorious fk up
You have so much material, even the comic books
<a:HibikiAniDisgust:777603915716755457>
(Scorpion's Revenge, etc.)
You're talking about the one made by the same ppl who made the recent MK animated films, right?
Nowadays, meme material
I watched it when I was a smol bean
Do I even need to show you a picture of that show?
<:MariaScared:672584661125431299>
Then sure
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
Maybe this is teenager Clark
Idk about that cartoon
Jon Kent is what pops in my head
The issue is that I do not see Clark Kent when I look at that picture
If you told me those were Jon Kent and Damian Wayne or Dick Grayson
There's a difference between stylistic differences and accuracy
<:ShirabeConcern:586404485598019604>
How tf are those supposed to be Clark Kent and Bruce Wayne?
If that's genuine
I'm looking at that picture
<:OgawaRead:688429716507721770>
I need to check out Ice Queendom sometime this month
As a comic event
There was weirdly enough, a crossover between Injustice...and He-Man
<:ShirabeChibi:698939825155473499>
Thought the TMNT/Batman collab looked fun
Probably might due to morbid curiosity
Not sure if I want to give it a watch (As in just watching clips online lol)
Keeping that in mind, possibly
Then again like I said before, these are different versions of Clark and Bruce from a different Earth
It's just weird
Oh I'm not saying it's necessarily bad
<:ShirabeChibi:698939825155473499>
I don't hate the RWBY design
You might at least understand why some ppl may think of Clark Kent and Damian Wayne when they first see that picture without digging too deep
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
So
Tbf, I don't know exactly WHICH universe these guys came from
As in, some magic turned them back into their youthful selves?
<:nko_derp_drool_dumb:987147024656900106>

A shame we don't get any more Nanoha content
<:MariaScared:672584661125431299>
That's all I can say on that matter.
Don't give Galvatron's Revenge any attention.
At this time, you're better off with looking at stop motion series.
That are decent collectibles
Admittedly some pretty good ones
Anytime there's a TF show, there's always toys and figures to be made
Here's your answer
üëÄ
Oh a Star Trek char voiced a TF char?
<:MichaLaugh:816901827349184513>
Mostly watched Prime via YT clips
Can say No üôÇ
(Fan series, stop motion, etc.)
And for those ppl, do you keep up with any TF Prime fan projects?
<:nko_blanket:985396177451220992>
(From Hub)
Who here remembers Transformers Prime?
So.
Hate-watchers, mate
<:nko_derp_drool_dumb:987147024656900106>
But if most of them are trash like this...
I'm sure that some of the upcoming W/B animated shows might be good
<:TsubasaNeutral:688429723205894149>
W/B killed off other shows like Infinity Train and such...and this is what we are supposed to enjoy
<a:HibikiAniDisgust:777603915716755457>
Oh boy...
Any proof of that? <:nko_hmm_wat_what_sus:985396960225820683>

Some enjoyable ones I found were Spongebob and MLAATR
~~JJBA ripoff~~
Eugh
That edgy 4kids show?
You mean that 4Kids show?
<:HUH:1012917714706235472>
<:CarolTheFuck:617036187319795722>
Back in the day
Adventure time and Regular show were my jam
One of the few good 4Kids shows...
Same animation quality as the TMNT show back then, which isn't so bad I guess
Legends of Awesomeness I think
There was also that one Kung Fu Panda show
Who remembers that?
TUFF Puppy
There was
<:nko_no:994614780834885713>
**Not including Power Rangers Megaforce and Ninja Steel**
But there were a few stinkers at Nick that I watched too...
https://tenor.com/view/jenny-jenny-wakeman-xj9-mlaatr-my-life-as-a-teenage-robot-gif-26251131

Yeah not the best, but part of me kind of wants to see more of it <:nko_cry_tears:987146099305373746>
A shame we never saw more of this side of the Nanoha series
Ah, StrikerS
