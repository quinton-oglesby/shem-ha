Hello.
But when it comes to when I can find a right icon pack, I'll use a black and red icon pack.
I guess it's back to using my white icons.

This was my theme before.
Ignite Chris.
It matches Chris Yukine's colors.
Why do you ask?
But here's my Chris theme.
Well I got a half-assed icon theme that looks sort of tacky.
Yeah.
Because it's got three apps it doesn't support, my Xperia phone app, Amino Apps, and Discord.
Man, I can't even find a fucking good red icon pack.
I recolored Undyne's spears.
Try and guess how I got her arrows on there.

How does it look?
I tried to make my own.

<@263983345669505025> Garie in Wonderland?
Is this supposed to be Trump?

I know, but before that power outage, it looked like they had a chance to go and grab bat lady.
In episode 3.
Why?
Oh my God, Kirika and Shirabe. You two just stood there and let the enemy retreat.
<:TsuCurious:460618321491132427>
So why don't Hibiki and Miku just kiss already?
Right now it feels like the Symphogear users are up against the government.
A fair fight and wants to try befriending the enemy.
Man. Hibiki and Goku are a lot alike in the personality department.
So far, we have modular girl, bat lady, and beast girl.

Happy birthday, me.
HAPPY BIRTHDAY, HIBIKI!
Like, come on. Who is sourcing these things out to people?
Man. The Noise are just getting annoying at this point.
I have been behind.
Yeah.
Garie Tuman us back.
Garie and them are back.
HOLY SHIT
Or at least physically published?
If so, then why isn't it translated yet?
Is there a Symphogear manga?
<:GarieWink:336657101273169921>
Hibiki's ass is a snacc.
Her butt is sexy.
<a:AngieOwO:620691863954784267>
<:RightSwing:571896543544606751>
I wonder how much phonic gain you need to destroy Hibiki's ass.
"Hang on. Lemme transform in mid-attack."
Man. I just love how bat girl is able to just patiently and nicely stop her attack just so Maria and Tsubasa could transform.
She does have a nice ass. I'll admit.
I know it is her charm point.
The anime really loves to focus on Hibiki's ass doesn't it?
<:MikuGasm:407334036105592837>
It's at least three anime shows I'm following.
It's good to me.
Fairy Tail, Do You Love Your Mom And Her Two-Hit Multi-Target Attacks?, And Symphogear XV.
So this week is the end of three good anime shows.
I love how Hibiki screamed her transformation chant.
And the Wikia.
Someone was telling me that it was Milaarc and that the CR Sub was wrong.
Or Milaarc?
Is it Millaarc?
<:AngieHmm:367770799131590666>
Was there a Symphogear OVA?
Welp. Now there's nothing more to Symphogear. Now is there?
The end of an amazing series.
That was great.
<:TsuCry:466385341222354954>
<:AngieOmg:367770799270264843>
Did Bikki finally propose?
Bride Mikugear?
<:KirikaSmug:607742561414676517>
Did they confess their love?
Or vice versa.
What do you guys think Miku told Bikki?
Does anyone here have a job that'd be willing to give me an opinion?

Oh.
Metalocalypse?
What show?
Imagine if Dethklok existed in the Symphogear universe.

Chris.mp3
I'd imagine Chris.mp3 being any Guns N' Roses song, or maybe Dethklok's Laser Cannon Deth.

I love this remix.
Did somebody say Foreigner?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wln6NX0V4AQ
Or something like it.
Imagine if the Pick of Destiny made it in as a plot device for Symphogear.

Dio was cool. Sad that he's gone.
Now go, my son, and, ROOOOOOOCK!
Lol. Okay.
Anyone thinking my songs fit?

The Nep games.
Welp, it is now or never, before Steam removes these.
No. I didn't. I didn't know about the sale.
Guess the game, guys.
Yuffie, you are really a great ninja.

Not with the game I am playing.

Oh god what happened to you Sora?

I'm being a Vinesauce. Lol.


That is a pretty good drawing, Namine.
Because Vinesauce has never done it.
I am corrupting Kingdom Hearts. Lol
WAT?




I lost my save data already. Lol.


I am corrupting KH COM, on the GBA.

Lol.
The fuck?

You managed to cloak yourswlf.
XD
While corrupting Kingdom Hearts. Lol.

How is it still playable?
What would be a good FPS to buy that's on steam?
Or nah?
Should I still buy it?
Does anyone know if the Overwatch craze is dead?
