We have decided to discontinue our crypto endeavors due to colossal server failures involving a rat and ungodly amount of garlic bread. Instead, we give you these prompts:

```Three's a Crowd: This one is more a limitation but I know you brilliant writers will create something amazing with this. You may only have at max two named characters in your story. 

Prank: PSYCHE! Nothing like a good ol' prank to liven up the party. Write the characters pranking each other in the spirit of this month!

Disguise: AMONGUS. Yall feel me when I say that when someone turns out to be an impostor is kinda cringe right? Like when that cool girl in pink glasses turned out to be an angry teenage girl throwing sharp yo-yos? And who knows what other wacky hi-jinks that have happened related to any form of disguises for our crew. Write some stories involving disguises.

Genre Shift: Symphogear is now a different genre! Whether it's a dark and mysterious murder thriller, a heart pounding Shoujo, or a fantastic space opera, write a story where Symphogear has changed its outfit!```

To submit a prompt, simply DM a document to either <@284390402210136064>  <@!186660127825330177> , <@!279341087494242304>  and/or <@!445783190976856065>. Prompts should be 2-6 page (~3,000 words) PDFs and we will start daily posting them in <#357682999300718592> in a week's time. You may also still write for the April Fool's prompt if you wish.
The deadline for this month's submissions is April 30th. Any other questions should also be directed to us. Good luck and, for those with allergies, stay healthy!
<@&458048859910832149> 
Hi everyone! As I've said, we have super exciting news to share with you all!
We at the writing prompt team are proud to announce a brand new partnership with HibikiCoin ‚Ñ¢Ô∏è and debuting our writing prompts on the blockchain!

That's right! This is a new and exciting way for you to contribute and invest in your favorite prompts! You can now mint your prompts on the blockchain as exciting NFTs and earn big!

What's more, we're also debuting a brand new NFT game featuring your prompts! Once you mint them, you can use them to battle against other prompt holders and win big prizes! 

This is an incredible step for us on the team, and we'd like to share the joy and success with you all! We want you to share in our feeling of pride and accomplishment! 

What's more, owning a prompt will allow you to participate in our upcoming **Promptverse**, where you'll be able to own a part of the space and have a say in all future prompt proceedings!

In order to support this tremendous step of ours, we need your help! I'm sure the characters of Symphogear would be as excited as we are for this, so we need you to write about how psyched they are about cryptocurrency, the blockchain, and NFTs! Your submissions will go a long way in providing you with amazing benefits! 

This is a huge creative endeavor on all sides, so don't be a stranger and get on board this new adventure with us!
We all have a story to tell.
You can hate.

What'll it be?
Remember, you are allowed to combine prompts if you wish, so don't limit yourselves to just one! 
We look forward to your submissions, and go wild!
<@&458048859910832149> 
You've waited for them, and here they are. After our 2 month break, the writing prompts return with a vengeance! This month is gonna be crazy, I'm telling you!
And without further ado, the prompts!
```
1. Valentine: With Valentine's Day behind us and White Day coming up, it's that time for the season of romance! Write about the characters doing something disgustingly sweet and romantic, and let that mystique of intimacy shine through! But remember, nothing too spicy! We're PG after all!

2. Reshooting: CUT CUT CUT! And Action! You're now the director of Symphogear, and you've been given the reins to alter it as you wish. Take a moment from the show (or the game, if you wish) and alter it so it fits your preferences! Get those damn plot holes out of the way and fix that wonky characterization!

3. Renewal: Redo. Reset. Renew. Rebirth. Something that had once ended starts anew. What once was, and was believed to be no longer, has returned. Write a story in which this theme of something being redone, something being renewed. Redo. Reset. Renew. Rebirth.

4. Blast from the Past - Crossover: The fan favorite prompt has returned! You know how it goes - Symphogear and another franchise come together! Whether it's characters meeting, or one canon superimposing the other, the possibilities are endless! Go wild as you have Symphogear shine alongside your favorite series!
```

The rules are the same as always: 2-6 pages, submitted as a pdf to any of the prompt masters. You have until the end of the month to do so, so take your time!

Now, for all participants in the collaboration, these rules apply to you as well! It might be a tad more challenging in this format, but I trust you all to put your best foot forward and write something bombastic and fun! I believe the current roster is more than adequate to get your creative juices rolling!

Of course, you can still submit prompts solo, so if you have more ideas, you can do as many as you like!
<@&458048859910832149> 
Hello there, fellow writing prompt enthusiasts!
You might be wondering why we are posting an announcement now of all times, still a week away from the start of March.
With our temporary hiatus soon coming to an end, we decided to refresh the formula a bit, and return to you with an idea that was done once before, and which we decided to do so again now, with all the new members that've joined us.
That idea being... ü•Å ü•Å 

Collaboration!

Now what does that mean, you might ask? Simple! Your next submission will be a team effort!
How will it work?
First, this is not mandatory. If you don't want to participate in this, you don't have to, and you can still submit a prompt of your own. 
However, if you want to participate, do send <@!284390402210136064> a message indicating you want to do so. We will then compile a list of all participants, randomize them, and then pair you up with another person who'll be your partner for the submission! 
Each pair will be individually informed, and it will be up to you to keep in contact and work on it as you wish. We leave the delegating of work up to you!
Thus, what we're doing is giving you a heads up. In a week we will post the prompts themselves, so you have this time to submit your names to the list. We will then inform you of the pairs on the day of, so do be available. 
The usual rules of the prompts will apply, so be creative, brainstorm, and deliver the best you can when the time comes! You can write one, or two, or how many submissions you want as a team. 
On that note, if you have a problem with the person chosen as your partner, do contact us and we'll see what we can do. 
So that's that! We hope to see as many of you participating as possible! If you have any questions, don't be afraid to ask us at <@!279341087494242304> <@!186660127825330177> <@!284390402210136064> and <@!445783190976856065> 
See ya next week!
To submit a prompt, simply DM a document to either <@!284390402210136064> <@!279341087494242304>, <@!186660127825330177>, and <@!445783190976856065> 
Prompts should be 2-6 page PDFs  
We will start daily posting them in <#357682999300718592> in a week's time. 
The deadline for this month's submissions is November 30th. 
Any other questions should also be directed to us. 
Start bundling up, because winter is coming!
Have a Happy Halloween? Dreading the impending Christmasgeddon drowning out Thanksgiving (if you're American)? Perhaps some more <@&458048859910832149>  will help take your mind off the times, whether reading or writing them. 
For this month we have:
```
1. Fairy Tales: Whether it be the sanitized Disney versions or the usually darker and more "adult" originals, fairy tales have been an indelible mark on human society. Write some of our favorite 'Gears reacting to or perhaps being a part of a fairy tale.
2. Injury: Being a government-employed magical girl is probably dangerous work, with plenty of potential for harm and enforced bedrest. Write a story where someone's hurt and they're on bedrest, no ifs or buts about it.
3. Eureka: "Maybe if we put this in there and that thing over here we could-OYOYOYOYO!" That spark of brilliance, that moment of realization, that instant of discovery... we all love the way it can overcome the frustration prior. Write about one or more of the characters having a eureka idea/moment.
4. Blast From The Past - Creative Usages: God the things I would do with Airgetlahm. I would win a lot of arm wrestling tournaments and maybe even do some extreme kickflips on a skateboard. What do you mean they were built for combat?! Write a story where the infinite possibilities of the Symphogear unlock new horizons, useful or not. Or perhaps you find a use already in the show for something brand new?
```
Rules are as follows as always: 
Page limit is 2-6 pages.
Submit as a pdf or word file to either <@!284390402210136064>, <@!445783190976856065> , <@!186660127825330177> , or <@!279341087494242304> 
The deadline is the last day of the month.
Submissions will begin being posted one week from the publication of this post. You can still submit them at any time after that though, so don't let that stop you.
The format of the story also doesn't have to be just a narrative! If you feel the need or the desire, it can be anything else as well! A song, a poem, a drawn image, we accept it all!
And remember, you can also combine prompts if you wish and feel it'll make it more interesting. Show us your creative minds!
If you have any questions, don't be afraid to ask!
That's all from us for this time. Happy October and Happy Halloween!
<@&458048859910832149> Aaaaaaaaaaand we return with a blast! I hope you all had plenty of time to rest in September, because here and now, our glorious writing prompts return for October!
And you know what this means, don't you?
üëª üíÄ ü¶á 
```
1. Halloween - It's the season of costumes and scares! Write about the Symphogear characters celebrating this holiday however you wish! Keep to the spirit of the season!
2. Horror - On the other side of celebration, there is terror. Write a story that will send chills down the spines of the readers. Spook the hell out of everyone with a terrifying tale! Aim for a more serious tone for this prompt!
3. "Shirabe Shirabe! I can't believe we're getting the chance to present the third prompt, dess!"
"Kiri-chan, just read the memo. They wrote it down for you for a reason."
"I know I know dess! Ahem ahem! Hello everyone of the discord server! The theme for the prompt this time is the fourth wall! ...Um, Shirabe, I don't know what that is."
"Jiii... Let me tell them. So this time, you have to write about breaking or bending the fourth wall. Show what we do when we're aware of the fact we're being written about."
"Whoaaaa, that is so cool, dess! Maybe they'll let us join the server too dess!"
"Kiri-chan, that's still not exactly--"
"Gaaahh! It's so confusing! Anyway everyone, have fun! But if you write something about me and Shirabe, make sure to close the blinds!"
"Kiri-chan..."
4. Blast from the Past: Visions - Someone is seeing and/or hearing hallucinations. Perhaps they're from stress, or other mental causes, or perhaps they're externally influenced.
```
<@&458048859910832149> Aight, so!
The people have spoken. After a pretty unbalanced poll results (lol), we the prompt team have decided that September will be a break month!
What does that mean, you may ask?
Basically, no new prompts will be presented. If you're in the middle of writing a submission for August's prompts, you can still submit it. In fact, if you *still* want to write something for August, you may do so as well. 
(Ya'll bloody waited for the literal last minute to submit your entries you nerds lol)
Take this month as an opportunity to recharge your writing batteries and shake off that burn out. With next month being October, you know what sort of prompts are coming üëª 
Thank you all for participating in our monthly writing prompts, and we will see you in October!
<@&458048859910832149> 
We enter the hottest month of the year! August rolls in, and with it, some blazing hot prompts straight from the oven!
```
1. Culture Exchange: The Gears visit a foreign country and experience its unique culture! Whether it's the local dishes, customs, and interesting sightseeing/tourist attractions, write the characters meeting people similar or very different from themselves! Take this opportunity to present your culture and local interests!
2. Power: the power to protect, hurt, create, and destroy. The sense of overwhelming strength (or lack thereof) is a common theme in many works, one of which is Symphogear. Write the characters having an introspective on power in either a positive or negative perspective, or in which 'power' is a central theme.
3. Heat: IT'S TOO BLOODY HOT! As part of the summer months (or other sources of extreme heat), we all have our ways to articulate our woes. Write the characters dealing with this problem too!
4. Blast from the Past - Black: It's a term that is both infinitely malleable as well as impossible to pin down. Write a story in which the concept of 'black' is at its center (It can legit be anything that you can come up with. Dresses, environment, space, or anything else that you associate with 'black'!)```

Rules for the veterans and newcomers alike:
Limit is 2-6 pages, submitted in either a pdf document or word file to <@!186660127825330177> , <@!445783190976856065> , <@!284390402210136064> , or <@!279341087494242304> . We will begin posting submissions one week from the publication of this post. The deadline for submission is August 31st!
That's all from us this time! Have fun, and good luck surviving the blazing heat!
<@&458048859910832149> 
Hey-yo! It's July and summer is in full swing, along with a new set of writing prompts!

```Sports: Desperately trying to take that shot, hoping, just hoping you'll score the winning goal. Write about our girls getting involved in a sporting event or otherwise competitive activity in any manner and for any reason.
Isekai: One would think Symphogear wielders would be safe from Truck-kun. But no one is safe from Truck-kun. Write a story about one or more of our favorite Symphogear girls getting punted over to a world in which they may be totally OP, may or may not follow video game-esque logic, but which most definitely is pretty fantastical somehow.
A Year After: This month marks the two year anniversary since XV aired. Because us folks on the prompt team are not mathematicians, we can try and pretend it's just been one year and claim to be mistaken when called out on it. Write a story showcasing how the girls are living their lives, two years after defeating God.
Blast From the Past - Crossovers: There's nothing quite like mixing and matching several of our favourite series together into one big package, seeing the various characters interact and marvel at each others' strengths! Whether it is characters meeting, or a total recast of Symphogear's cast into another setting, the possibilities are endless! Popular or obscure, all are welcome! ```

To submit a prompt, simply DM a document/pdf to either <@!284390402210136064>  <@!279341087494242304>, <@!186660127825330177>, and <@!445783190976856065> 
Prompts should be 2-6 page PDFs and we will start daily posting them in <#357682999300718592> in a week's time. The deadline for this month's submissions are July 31st. Any other questions please post them to us too. Enjoy the summer!
<@&458048859910832149> 
And so went enter May! And with it, we have a new batch of prompts!
```1. Divine Inspiration: We‚Äôve seen Enki and Shem-Ha, but what about the other Custodians? What sort of Gods walked on the Earth in ancient times? Might they return? And might, perhaps, some new ones ascend to that level? Write a story involving those Custodians, whether in the past, present, or future of Symphogear!
2. Mothers: May features Mother's Day, so it only seems appropriate we shine a light on the criminally unexplored figures that are the Wielders' mothers. Dedicate a story that tells their tale, or perhaps write about the mother of some of the other characters (Fudou had to have had a wife once, after all). Alternatively, if you want to use this as an excuse to make the Wielders moms again, feel free.
3. Different Format: Classic story structure is so pass√©, so let‚Äôs spice things up! Whether poetry, anachronic chronology, or even Ulysses-esque near-impenetrability, tell a story using anything but the usual narrative structure.
4. Blast to the Past - Employment: "Magical girl" is not something that looks good on your CV. Perhaps its time for a career change? With or without their trademark weapons, write our characters in a job of some kind!
```

Rules are the same as always! 2-6 pages, submitted in a pdf file to either <@!279341087494242304> <@!186660127825330177> <@!284390402210136064> or <@!445783190976856065> 
Prompts will begin publishing a week after this post. 
Deadline is June 1st. Remember, you can submit a story at any point during the month, and we will post it as soon as possible, perhaps even the very same day!
If you have any questions, don't be afraid to ask any of us!

Have fun, and we look forward to your submission! <:Cag:423197445644615711>
<@&458048859910832149> 
Alas! The mods have turned on us and bonked us for pitting you against each other for the title! <a:ShirabeBonk:801207951645605958> 
Party is over people! Sorry about that. <:Bikkiwhoops:641784248092590100> 
The suffering competition is hereby cancelled. There won't be a contest or public shaming or point gains! Gomenasai! üôá‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è 
Instead, have this batch of writing prompts!
```
1. Prank: PSYCHE! Nothing like a good ol' prank to liven up the party. Write the characters pranking each other in the spirit of this month!
2. Whose Line Is It Anyway? (Credit to Nevis): Every character in the series has their own personality that makes them stand out, so write a short piece about a character or characters without ever mentioning their name! Nicknames are allowed so long as they do not include any part of the character's name (i.e The Idiot is allowed, Kiri-chan is not)
3. Plot Twist: SHOCKING REVELATION! Write a story that ends with a shocking swerve that nets the biggest AAAAAAAAA this side of the Symphoverse! Blow people's minds!
4. Blast from the past - Genre Shift: Symphogear is now a different genre! Whether it's a dark and mysterious murder thriller, a heart pounding *Shoujo*, or a fantastic space opera, write a story where Symphogear has changed its outfit!
```
**IMPORTANT NOTE: If you have submitted for the April Fool's prompt, your entry will be published as usual with no alterations. If you intended to write for it or are currently writing for it, *you still can*, but your entry will be subject to the same rules of the usual writing prompts. If you wrote over the limit... Sorry, tough luck! <:Cag:423197445644615711> Change it!**

Limit is 2-6 pages. Submit a *pdf* file to either Shemmy, Nuker, Rakhi, or solopy567.
Prompts will begin publishing on April 8th.
Protip! You can submit an entry that is a combination of any of the above! 
If you have questions, ask away!

That's all for this time! Have fun, and we look forward to your entries!
<@&458048859910832149> It's a new month, everybody, and that means new writing prompts! This month's are as follows:

```Suffering```

That's it! That's all you're allowed this month! 
But wait! There's more!
With permission from the wonderful mod team, we've decided to turn this month's prompts into a special contest! 
That's right, your submissions will be reviewed by our panel of judges consisting of myself, <@!186660127825330177> , <@!445783190976856065> , and <@!284390402210136064> !
For each submission, we'll be assigning points depending on how much suffering is included in your entry! The more pain and hardship, the more points you earn!
What is the special prize, you may ask?! The grand winner of this contest will be crowned the King or Queen of Suffering for a whole month, marked by a super special role the mods have graciously decided to provide for us!

Remember, only suffering is allowed! There is no happiness or pleasure allowed in your entries! Any submitter found to have added even a tiny modicum of it into their entry will have their names revealed and be subject to public shaming for not being able to follow the rules! Watch out fellas!

The word and page limit is as your heart desires! Go wild as you unleash hell for all those involved! Gather those painful tears and praise be to Satan!

Have fun! And remember, life in pain, nothing matters, and the J in Symphogear stands for Joy!

Toodle-oo!
<@&458048859910832149> Another month, another set of writing prompts! But by god, it's already March?! Where did the rest of the year go?!
In any case, the prompts for this month!

```1. Missing: Something or someone has been lost! It is up to the rest of the characters to find them! Write about the characters going through the motions of finding their target!
2. Responsibilities: Ah yes, that dreaded thing we all fear as adults. Having responsibilities is a big step towards maturing as a person, and the characters of Symphogear are no different. Write about them finding themselves having newfound responsibilities, bills or otherwise, and how they deal with them.
3. Background - Day in the Life: The cast of Symphogear is vast and colorful, but they're not the only people involved. Oftentimes, it's the little people, whose work goes uncredited, that help that well oiled machine run as it should. Write a story from the perspective of a minor or background character in the world!
4. Blast from the Past - Childhood: That once in a lifetime experience that shapes who you are is something of a mystery in the world of Symphogear. Write about the childhood experiences of the characters, or perhaps, write about the childhood of a prospective child of theirs!```

Rules are the same as always! 2-6 pages. Submit either a word or pdf file. Deadline is the end of the month. Send your submissions to either:
<@!284390402210136064> 
<@!445783190976856065> 
<@!279341087494242304> 
<@!186660127825330177> 
Submissions will start being published 1 week after the writing of this post.
If you have any questions, don't be afraid to ask!
That's all for now! Have a happy March, and we look forward to your submissions!
<@&458048859910832149> 
Happy February everybody! We're already two months into 2021 and it already feels like a whole lot happened <:KirikaPanic:644235681677180958> 
In any case, February means one thing!
That's right! Valentine's Day! And so, we've picked prompts fitting for the occasion!
```
1. Date: A Ferris Wheel? Tokyo Tower? The Sea Side? A Shrine? Or perhaps something more exotic? Write about some of the Symphogear characters going on a date, romantic or otherwise.
2. Gifts: The joy of receiving a pair of gloves. A nice dress. Stuffed animal toys. Not just because of the items themselves, but because of the meaning and very act of gift giving from those who care about you. Write a story about the some of the Symphogear characters giving or receiving some sort of gift.
3. Alternate Beginnings: Things have changed and changed wildly. The world that is now is not the same as the world that was. But how did that happen? One has to go back to find out. Write the beginning of a story that is a significant divergence from canon... or perhaps the beginning of one of the canon AU's from XDU!
4. Blast from the past - Crackships: Pretty self explanatory, ain't it? Write the wildest pairing imaginable! Let your imagination fly as you describe the perfect date between Fudou and Shirabe, or perhaps the passionate romance between Carol and Hibiki's mom! The possibilities are endless!
```
*Many thanks to ObsessedNuker for his help at writing the first three prompts for this month!
The rules are as usual: 2-6 pages. Since February is a short month, deadline will be the 2nd of March. 
If you wish to submit, send either a word or pdf file to either <@!284390402210136064> , <@!186660127825330177> , <@!279341087494242304> , or the new member of the prompt team, <@!445783190976856065> ! If you have any questions, don't be afraid to ask!
Happy February and Valentine's Day everybody! We're looking forward to your wild submissions!
<@&458048859910832149> 
Merry Christma--Oh wait, it's not yet? But all of November was Christmas! 
Anyway, here we have the final prompts for the year!
```1. Snowed in: Nothing worse than being trapped at home because it snowed too heavily last night. Or perhaps, in a cabin in the middle of nowhere. Write about what the characters are up to now that they're stuck.
2. Songs: For this prompt, pick a song of your choosing, and base the narrative of your entry around that song's lyrics. What kind of wild adventures are the Gears up to with this? This is your chance to be creative and really think outside the box.
3. Remembrance: Memory is powerful. It can make us soar through the skies, or lament bygone days. It can make us smile, and it can make us grieve over people lost. Write about the characters reflecting on the past.
4. Blast to the past - Secret Santa: You know the drill! It's secret santa time! What kind of whacky shenanigans will the characters be up to this time?```

And for this round, we also have a special challenge! This challenge is entirely OPTIONAL, and is only here to spice your prompts up if you wish. 
```Poetry: Whichever prompt you pick to write for, write it in a poetic format! Let your inner Emily Dickinson or Edgar Allen Poe shine as you tackle the prompt from a new direction! If you choose to do this challenge, a single page entry will also be accepted.```
 
Deadline is December 31th (Do note, we will not be releasing a prompt on the 25th and the 31st. We have lives too you know.)
Page limit, as always, 2-6 pages. If you want to give yourself more space by playing with the layout and fonts, contact us first so we can decide if it's ok.

You may submit it to Rakhi, Shemmy, or myself at any time. Remember that released prompts are anonymous and it will be entirely up to the author to reveal themselves, so don't get stuck on trying to figure out who wrote it!

That's all for this time! Merry Christmas and Happy New Year everyone! Good luck!

I'm starting to think that maybe we should have a dedicated place for Shirabe pinging. While it's fun, it can clog up channels with nothing but that. Maybe have her draw from all the channels at once rather than just the one she's in. 
It's amusing, don't get me wrong, but it can get kinda spammy.
But I can understand
like it's almost a basic thing
hmmm, I guess it felt like it became a given in servers
Suggestion: Ryoko should point out when someone leaves
~~make everything into miku emotes~~
it's even worse than the time the shirabe bot suddenly put random lines at random times
It's very annoying seeing those meaningless "Dess" all over the place
Suggestion: create a bot channel where only there people can spam the bot commands
:mariahappy:
abort abort
ah gosh dang nabbit
:mikuhorror:
:hibimikucry:
:kiricry:
~~but we never ask satelight if we can use the anime for emotes~~
:genthink: emote
it speaks for itself
what is this emote supposed to represent, btw?
ü§î I'm not sure this is possible, but I'll try
Say you're posting an image to one of the channel where Shirabe finds the source. If I recall correctly, Shirabe can only do that a certain amount of times per day. However, say I'm posting a short comic, maybe 3-4 pages tops, and Shirabe sources them all, thus somewhat breaking the sequence between them and making it look a lot messier.
I was wondering if it's possible for there to add a command to Shirabe, something along the lines of "dess_nosauce" or something or another, that prevents Shirabe from sourcing that particular image? That way, when you're posting a few images at once (and not in the art dump manner), it doesn't use up those numbers for the day, and also keeps it cleaner.
Of course, the command will need to be typed for every image you want to post unsourced, but considering the art channels are for posting only a few images at once, I don't think that is too much of a problem.
New role colors onegaishiplease!
Noble Red (doesn't have to be each one separately), Shemha, Fine, and so on

looks a little bit strange
wait, now I have to ask
Oh well
Ah rip
such as, of course, submitting writing prompts
thus get more people to collect it through other means
this way I think there'll be incentive for kiricoin other than for purely RV
and of course, it'll have other restrictions such as no slurs/other offensive material, no spoilers, and no mod roles
naturally it'll be completely meaningless other than for aesthetic
I cash those in and can give myself a custom role
for example, let's say I have 5k kiricoins
would it be possible to implement a system that allows people to sort of 'purchase' roles with kiricoins?

So if you want everyone to still enjoy it, it's probably for the best to pull back
To the point it even reached consideration for removal
Considering it's used every time someone joins and has been spammed in the past in general
Pushing it even further is not going to earn anyone any favors
The fish has become the sort of joke that's been pushed continuously and only continued being pushed
More is just going to rub off the wrong way with people
I think we've had our fill of fish
back when the dinosaurs still walked the earth long ago
good opportunity to give it a new purpose
üëç
Likewise x2
It'll require almost constant moderation and I dont think that's  something you can reasonably expect
That getting deeper and deeper into fetishs will eventually reach an uncomfortable point, even to the inhabitants of the channel
I think was a topic that was discussed about the NSFW channel too
There's also the point where it becomes difficult to decide what is the limit allowed for discussion
and that makes them pretty much required to go to NSFW
and well, NSFW fics lead to NSFW discussions
as was said, NSFW fics don't get posted enough to warrant it
Personally I don't think there's a need for such a channel
moved my vote to skeptical
but perhaps a poll could be made to gauge interest
the eventual conclusion was that there just weren't enough artists interested in it to make it sustainable
we had that sort of discussion in the past iirc
Rejected
but not in day to day discussions
sure, if he's in the middle of a live blogging then yeah, you can accommodate him
the channel is a free range zone and if he gets spoiled by a discussion in there, it's on him, not everyone else
it's on the individual to avoid spoilers, not everyone else to not spoil them
I agree
i suppose we can try it and see how well it works
put that in its own separate chat and you're taking away a part of the life support
prompts at least lead to some talks happening
and can go silent for days on end
fancontent as a channel can sometimes struggle to keep up discussion
I saw the suggestion of using threads for writing prompts, and frankly I don't support it
^ I agree
I suppose a thread can be made for it?
I think going public would deprive the server of a lot of things
Dont forget to bring this up with the prompt masters <:YumiPoint:688429724103344164>
During character birthdays I assume people dont expect to get a laundry list of reactions anyway, so I dont think this point is that relevant anyway. 
I suppose we couldve delayed the posting of this one to give people that space, but we posted it still, and I think that even if it's a character birthday, the grace period still has to be respected
All past, present, and future Matts
Yes
I wouldnt be a mod even if you paid me
Pffptftftftftft
But the question is who is trustworthy enough
Lily also hasnt been around for a while so I agree that more mods are needed
I mean, if theres a general public consensus that we need more mods then it's obviously worth considering
welcome friend

Supreme taste indeed
Bold and Ikaros fan

Shinku gets my drift.
<@&454478881349435392> 
Alright, seeing as this is the place for non-Symphogear fanfiction, I need to do so here
So! Ahem ahem...
Dear readers, I come to you with a brand new tale! Primarily based on Type Moon, this is a MEGA CROSSOVER between many of the various Type Moon works, all of which finds themselves in an environment most of you are probably unfamiliar with!
And that's fine, because I have decided to introduce a section post-chapter that sheds some light on many of the unfamiliar terms, and I also made sure that in the writing itself much is explained.
What is it about? Well, read to find out!
So everyone, I am proud to present my new long fanfiction in the making:
*Type Moon Warriors!*
https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12993683/1/Type-Moon-Warriors
https://archiveofourown.org/works/15200549/chapters/35254214
and shirabe is a one way ticket to jail
that bikki figure looks dumb
>141 chapters
now fix all the other worst parts too!
uhhhhhhhhhh
üëå supreme taste
<@&454478881349435392> And back with a blast!
For those of you who remembered, I started writing an Xover between Type Moon and Warriors Orochi.
The second chapter has now been posted! Catch it live now!
https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12993683/2/Type-Moon-Warriors
https://archiveofourown.org/works/15200549/chapters/38693630
<@&454478881349435392> and the next chapter is up! It took a while, but here it is fresh from the oven! Enjoy!
https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12993683/5/Type-Moon-Warriors
https://archiveofourown.org/works/15200549/chapters/41940662
then maybe you should stick to the original rather than try and make edits that obviously wouldn't work out
<@&454478881349435392> and we're back with another chapter of Type Moon Warriors! I hope you all eagerly awaited it...maybe. For those of you who still read it, this is fresh from the oven! Have at thee!
https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12993683/4/Type-Moon-Warriors
https://archiveofourown.org/works/15200549/chapters/40418129
<@&454478881349435392> And so, chapter three of Type Moon Warriors is out!
For all those who care, check it out now!
https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12993683/3/Type-Moon-Warriors
https://archiveofourown.org/works/15200549/chapters/39041188
you can try writing plot points down and see what you come up with
so it does indeed depend on execution
there are hardly any original ideas left in the world as it is
Can't recommend it enough
This is the story that made me check out the original game, which was super good
truly a masterpiece
<@&454478881349435392> and we return with another chapter! This time, Mordred leads her forces to save some of their brainwashed allies. There, they meet a very famous monkey that makes their lives a little bit harder.

vanishes as fast as it appears
A ghost that appears once in a blue moon
That Yami is but a specter
Do not worry
It's his pet monster from the show
How did you forget
It's fine only if you have the Nephilim as one of his lovers
Or eerily similar
Therefore, her counterpart will either be her exact opposite in personality
Since she's a childhood friend too, she probably feels free to criticize and speak her mind to her master
Since she's both a maid and a childhood friend, loyalty seems like something she has in spades
Out of all of them, Yui is the only one I can imagine anything about
As for the characters themselves
<@!191005638212452352>
Funnily enough, the newest entry in the When They Cry franchise is going to be like this
where they plan against each other
All in all, the way I see this story going is basically faction wars
Same thing with the White Roses
meanwhile, spy on her and send information about her to the relevant associates
Infiltrate Arisa's midst by pretending to be that maid
Kidnap/kill the real maid
That sounds like a possible plot to throw off Arisa
Considering the maid has a counterpart from another universe
like, twins?
Do the counterparts look similar by any chance
considering there are factions + alternate universe counterparts
this sounds like a story that'll be a sort of... battle royale?
Both of you told him everything I would've
Well, I don't think there's anything for me to say on the matter anyway
I see
what're we talking about?
oh shit that's super cool

<@337316978098176011>  WHO TOLD YOU TO STOP
We are pretty much here for that
This is a symphogear server
dammit now im jittery
hmm, so miku is an apple
i'm dying here
NOT FAR ENOUGH
DIG DEEPER
What sort of treasure chest did you dig up for all this fanart
hahahahahahahahahaha
fucking hell
no furries please
ughh
i think my eyes are burning from staring at the fat gears for too long

I will never in my life understand this trend
see this? this is where shit starts going crazy
i mean you can just go through the tag to find everything but good luck not drinking bleach over the weird ones

the artist is amazing

it's stuff like this
like when i say hidden gems
or muscles
Or giants
it's nasty in every sense of the word
I will never ever understand the fascination with fattening characters to holy hell
But a lot of weird shit as well
Also some nice cosplay
I'm not joking
There are some hidden gems on DA
There are some stuff that are super good
After surviving through the fatgears, OCs, Unbirths and other myriad fetishes people have
weirding out
are
my eyes
whoa
where?
kasumi thank you for your tribute for the glory of hibimiku
holy shit please
also damn what's with the Basa one with the hands
The best kind of sandwich
Yep, but as I said it's a spoiler so I won't talk about it for anyone who hasn't played the VN because it's from Heaven's Feel
Yeah it is. It's a crossover with FSN for anyone who doesn't know, although the exact scene is a spoiler.
If Kanade ever lived alone she would definitely be as messy as Tsubasa AND have beer cans spread out all over the place.

don't go there for art of symphogear
whatever you do
don't look at deviantart
the one with the gun wins
fake Yan
that's like
that was cos Ver fucked her up
Miku is not nearly that Yandere though




















crap not sure what is what hold on
HibiMiku dump?
Alrighty then
Now you got me started

read it
Oh damn this comic
https://www.pixiv.net/member_illust.php?mode=manga&illust_id=50769852




















only Hibiki can defeat Jiren?
I don't think this is the penetration she had in mine
¬ÆType-Moon
There's no resistance.
I end Maria's life with one blow.
"--------"
There were memories.
There was the warmth of life.
Her warmth was always by my side.
I kill her along with those memories.
I search through my mind and throw them away to where I can't find them again.














on the opposite end of the spectrum kek


















Have you ever imagined you'd see this sentence in your life?
"Deadpool saves Miku and gives her a Tauros."
same guy that drew the ultra weird crossover



Yeah, but I was so bummed out by the weak delivery that I had to give it my own twist
But instead we got some Ultraman inspired godzilla that didn't do anything
Seriously, you see that cocoon and you'd think this is the anime secondcoming of Kerrigan
And then ep 12 didn't deliver and all we got was godzilla Bikki that got beaten in 10 minutes
Are we Starcraft now
did he prophesize did
We were like
On the other discord, we went ballistic when someone shared this right after ep 11 aired
I dunno, I think the artist was some staff member
Another fun fact: that art was drawn before AXZ
Fun fact: My whole fic was inspired by the Episode EX art
It's Chris who is Piggy though














*runs*
Berserkbikki x Nephilim




and it seems i still have a bit more
It's called prowling through pixiv
That's it from me for now

But XDU kept throwing that at me so much I caved in
I always felt like thighhighs and Bikki don't go that well together
blasphemous
goddamit Maribasa you had one job
but I still would like to get everything you have
yeah i figured lol
Alternatively, plz zip it up and send me
It might be gigantic, but hit me up with all the hibimiku you got
Kerrick
yo adult elfnein holy shit
stolen from sgg


isn't it like 90% autotune?
YOU GODDAMN ZIP
if the bosslady tells you to zip
WE AIN'T A GODDAMN DEMOCRACY HERE
with absolutely everything you have
still want that zip though
glorious
random hamtaro lol
everything about this ship is glorious
oh highlights is fine go ahead
you will explode the channel!
no don't post it all it will take forever
wait what
nsfw
we must kidnap- I mean, politely ask her to come here and draw all the cute Symphogear she can
we need them gathered to create a hivemin- I mean a bustling community
don't keep people with talent away
have her grace us with goody goodiness
bring her here
who is this friend
and that's it

shul shagana miku hmmm

Oh my chainsaw is calling me how interesting
<:MikuYandere:336656947958775823> <:MikuYandere:336656947958775823> <:MikuYandere:336656947958775823> <:MikuYandere:336656947958775823> <:MikuYandere:336656947958775823>
My chainsaw awaits
what is that hand and who does it belong to





That moment you'll never have someone look at you like Miku looks at Hibiki
a new offering to the yuri gods
not even artificial dolls can escape the yurigods
Leiur's little sister > all
that hit the spot
good shit
went over everything
we got a supplier on our hands here
yo this one is rad af
<@!127644949884698624> 
bosslady, the goods are here
that works
why can't I access it
hmmm

I only frequented the Miku tag and it felt endless
but there's so much I don't have enough space for everything
pixiv pretty much gives them out for free
gotta count the bags of crack cocaine
this is precious
or no repeats? maybe my viewer was just being funny
fucking this
there are some repeats but minor detail
it's cool
I don't need this kind of negativity in my life
putting the censor back on
so much shitty porn
penises
disgusting
nasty
too much
>remove censor on pixiv
>sees what's going on in the symphogear tag there
mommy i dont wanna be in pixiv anymore
https://twitter.com/syokora_pad/status/975316046264524801


They should have kept Symphogear as a pseudo horror

take it to pm please
Please, she was weak in the knees every time Kanade even looked at her
But you're not allowed to ungay the Gears
You can massacre whole civilizations
the het fans celebrate their victory as we lick our wounds
Symphogear ends with a het ending
but it's too late
he may be gone
leaving him the winner with the last laugh
then throws himself off
and laughs
he turns around
the mob reaches his location
he smiles
Kaneko stands on the roof, overlooking the city
the series ends with a giant riot outside of satelight's office
THE GEARS ARE MARRIED TO DUDES
suddenly
then comes the epilogue
The gay is pretty much confirmed
Everything is set is stone
XV ends
But it's easy to see they went with the closet yandere archetype with Miku while Hibiki is the clueless dense protag
considering the environment Hibiki is in it's definitely not wrong to assume that she is. She's not doing anything to prove otherwise after all.
they're full on
everyone else, not so much
to be fair I think it was the producers' intention to leave her at least ambiguous
that's why I keep the filter on in pixiv
they're for headpats and cuddling
waifus are not for dicking
they're too busy playing with dolls
that's kind of extreme
seriously?
I feel like Aoi Yuuki is never going to get married
I mean, I just lurk too. I only go to fgo reddit to look up guides or the symphogear one
am I the only one not seeing the toxicity of reddit?
To enter its depths
You must first gather the pieces of the key
The cave of wonders

hahaha animated memorias

Pedover?
Nana had big problems with one of her first managers
yeah I heard something about that
In an article for The Japan Times, titled: "AKB48 member‚Äôs ‚Äòpenance‚Äô shows flaws in idol culture", Ian Martin noted: "What is happening here is that the protection of fans‚Äô fragile fantasies automatically trumps the basic human right to a life outside that fantasy framework. Though as lawyer Hifumi Okunuki pointed out in a Japan Times article on Jan. 22, such an arrangement is probably illegal under Japanese labor laws."
like I'm reading the article about her in wikipedia
isn't that illegal?
WHAT
what
the fuck
what
gotta stay pure for the fatass otakus
nope
jesus fuck japan what the shit
what the fucking fuck
(and yes i know it's actually super but eh)
the dbz crossover we didn't knew we wanted
well, it finally happened
so...
and Fudou
And so does Yatsuhiro
Genjuro has genes and jeans
Well...
Saint-Germain pretending to be Saint Nicholas
a person like Kirika can't handle the blade
I actually had a nasty story idea for Ver remaking humanity
this is the original image from the VN

did you know your daily pic is a reference to FSN?
<@!284390402210136064> btw

yep that's great
hit me up with that saint germain art
kerrik

And I will conquer the holy land to protect it
HibiMiku is the most precious thing ever
I will say this time and time again
Dashing Rogue Bikki capturing the heart of a simple maid of a wealthy household
I fucking love this
d-demo alice-chan, topdad-kun is kakoi
but every time you get more you need to change it
Cos I recall he did a similar art for Bikki
Ver. Monster Hunter?
that is a cool maria
yes
tiny hibimiku
give us
i know
she voices too many things to remember off the top of my head
Sounds like a regular tuesday
She also a he
now you don't have to guess what is what
huh, so pixiv added a thing that shows you the tags in romaji
wut
?!?!?!?
what am i looking at
franxx?
wtf is that bottom one










That's all I can say on the matter
We came across a fanfic that ended up being...divisive
Joe, i don't suppose you saw that...clusterfuck that happened yesterday lol
i fell asleep before healing my eyes so i need more
<@!263983345669505025> more
Son, im disappoint
You have to go gayer
Not gay enough
<@284390402210136064> hit me with the gayest and most wholesome symphogear fanart you got
<@!263983345669505025> hit me up with all the symphosuffering you got
let's all swim in the landfill together
and so are we
you are trash
*yet*
it's not
*ahem* exceptselfinsertinsymphogear *ahem*
Beauty is in the eye of the beholder, I guess?
When it gets lewd is when it becomes weird
I mean, this particular one is cute so I guess it's fine?
so many tabs
What about this pocket Miku?
some healing

















on that note
and I will say nothing more on the matter since everything that needed to be said was already well...said
you'll see when you get to it
to yesterday night
go to fancontent and scroll up
can you believe that
Ash got a fucking Ultra Beast
it felt like the weakest gen so far
He lost to a noob with a Riolu and not even a full party
how it all comes around
and got beat down by a self insert lol
Ash was at his highest in Kalos
holy crap
the episodes with litten
but it has some good moments
the animation for sun moon put me off
and then the league happened
Kalos was shaping up to be good
I unironically liked battle frontier
and it was good
and it worked
it's like how they crossed over nobunaga's ambition with pokemon
And it's super good too
I still can't believe it's a thing
disney crossed over with anime
in a nutshell
I think?
but yuri marriage isn't illegal
kek
AOT YURI
we interrupt this broadcast to give you:
got anymore of that?
vampire gears is good
bite sized
they're pretty much additional pocket gay
chibi symphogear? you mean zesshoushinai?
<:ElfneinBullying:421432763078410241>
oh these are images not gifs welp
and nothing more
and then they say the symphogirls are just good friends
goddamit bikki
whichever
or both
or girl
You need to grow up to be a smart boy
Cypher go back to reading
you have no say in the matter
assuming everything goes as planned then yes he will
didn't *you* sub them?
but
all the episodes in one nice package
Joe, you should make a mega zesshoushinai bundle
go watch them
Das cute

Not the kind of girl you pass by the street and your head turns around automatically to get a better look
She's suppose to be a little sister you want to bulli
Kirika has no business being this pretty
this maria doll will choke you in the middle of the night
totally
https://twitter.com/cat_love0408/status/980367782788284418
lots os strange fanart there
all the threads that there were
oh yeah kerrik, you also need to scour sgg
it's not nearly as organized as pixiv
wow good luck
also <@106866895076003840> I like how your twitter is essentially a giant HibiMiku collection
think the xdu kanamiku memoria
It's that act when one person (usually taller than the other) puts their arm on the wall above the shorter one
there was
Basa to Miku
Hibiki to Kirika
Kanade to Miku-Bikki-Basa
from what I remember off the top of my head
there was something close?
Hare hare yukai was the biggest thing
Cos it was cool in 2007
What year did you watch it
I give you a different type of drug
the only person among us with a modicum of talent
and Lily is the dealer cos she actually has some of her own
basa has bigger boobs than that
wait a minute
oh those are some nice wielder-
relevant
not for pretty
that's why kiri-chan is for headpats and bulli
<@!263983345669505025> hit me up with long hair bikki
Miku your eye is kinda drooping over there
Hibiki as Sayori
Tsubasa as Yuri
Chris as Natsuki
and Fine as Monika
Don't you want Symphodoki?
only if it's doki doki themed
if anyone has it, it's one of them
that Dragon Miku one? found it there
and they usually find a bunch of images out of nowhere
but I post updates on my story there too
i don't either
obviously
those guys there have everything
went to ask in sgg
yeah they have no idea
I swear I remember it but I can't find it again anywhere even with google
in the artwork channel
a while ago in the other discord
another one
no not this one
I've been looking for it forever
Where Hibiki is basically the Super Tengen Toppa
I once saw this one art of Gurren Lagann
<@!263983345669505025> okay maybe you can help me
like so
https://www.pixiv.net/member_illust.php?mode=manga&illust_id=66950907

great artist
the hibimiku one
new stc stuff?!?!?!
https://twitter.com/penguin_1209?lang=en
anyway, isn't it this artist:
no clue
*TRIGGERED*
ah, it's the artist
who
This is a Kiri I'd roll for


there's also this, which is hilarious
different gang


ok just found the weirdest thing
cos pixiv has a built in filter
depends
jpg lol
And of course, ep 11 uses Unlimited Beat as an insert because why not
Meanwhile, Maria and Basa gay it out in London while checking up on the Illuminati
That went berserk because reasons
Bikki befriends the departed spirit of Tutankhamun
pretty much yeah
"OH YEAH, HOW COULD THEY KNOW ABOUT IT?!"
"OH HEY, REMEMBER THAT THING WE DID THAT NO ONE KNOWS ABOUT OTHER THAN THE PEOPLE THAT PLAYED THE GAME?"
episode 11 of AXZ was pretty much that
from personal experience
don't fall into the hell of gacha

And when she was the governor of California?
Remember that one time she killed the Predator? Good times.
"I'll be back"
and says
She raises her hand and does a thumbs up
As she turns to dust
Kanarnold Amouzenegger
I mean, I'm all for the husband/wife dynamic the wielders got going on, but that's just ridiculous
it's really egregious on Hibiki, Kanade, Kirika, and Maria
He tends to draw them kind of manly
DLanon's art is a bit strange though
maria and basa
https://twitter.com/draw_cat_/status/984019155383980033

that was the joke
yes
<:MikuGay:336656810788388864>
oh it's from the same guy/gal that made the Kiricry gif

I expect them to be incredibly overdesigned and horrendously underpowered
I think there was some art of the Extra team together
maybe each of the Extra team events will introduce their Ignite versions
Basically, Edgebikki is a tsundere while EdgeMiku is a shrinking violet


and so far art of the two presents them as being adorably awkward around each other
the very final scene is of them reuniting
they did
exists your Kanade
beyond the horizon
one day man
when he's drunk he's not this articulate
https://twitter.com/golden_nabe/status/985105269284683776
BlueBikki is kinda nice I gotta admit
Everyone exchanged hair colors
you guys ready for mindfuck? here you go
well what will they do, execute her?
which one?
and has this love hate relationship with Chris
and everything is awkward
And she started hanging around SONG more
Imagine if she survived s1
Why can't she just be a mama
I feel like it could really work
I really dig the Momma Fine idea

Dial Fine



i have these?
don't go to sleep
R
R go to sleep
Miku is too much for Edgebikki
so the gay got kind of supressed
she didn't have a charm point to admire for a while
I'd imagine it's kind of a slow process
I can just imagine the awkward romantic moments they have
Edgebikki needs more love
faces are a bit strange
remember that time he saved Miku and gave her a Tauros? Good times
fucking deadpool
TIL
*give her a bottle of vodka as well*
he meant the russian squat
Until Kanade comes along
Serena is usually nice girl
Serena wtf
found the perfect reaction to anything
She seems a bit out of line here
You look kind of pale
are you okay?
Hibiki
uh

GODDAMMMIITTTT
RUKIA NO
lol sorry
you may draw one of those if they are attached to either herself or Bikki
OR DILDOS
NO PENISES
but
you could
Illi.exe has encountered a problem and needs to close. Sorry for the incovencience.

~~in that one fanfic where she gets a boyfriend despite being a loli~~
<:MikuBliss:336657233712513024>
the amount of yay cannot possibly be comprehended
but has no comment about the bdsm panties she's wearing?

sunspawn tries to gather clues from the former living gears
and pretty hardass probably too
nah she's the head of the Kazanari now
apple doesn't fall far from the tree eh bikki?
ironic
how...

Oh, so dadbikki is a total ghost then

and what is that hibimiku folder file
what is all this art i dont know
whoa whoa whoa
good shit though regardless
shame
need more pretty Fine art
OH SHIT
That
And she tried to reach for it?
Remember how in the final ep sg's gun remained
I thought more like
Hmmm
I'd imagined it's just Chris' mascot in this case
<:MikuGay:336656810788388864>
And call me for Mikus
Do that more
What did I do to earn all this precious Miku?
<:MikuBliss:336657233712513024>
it's either super good or horrific
it's never average

lolll

dreams are a nice thing
But in XDU, she defaults to normal Bikki songs
I'd assume she doesn't sing at all
she's just being tsun
it's edgebikki too
hibimiku gives me strength
Lol wtf

there's something quite adorable about teeny weeny berserk Maria/Hibiki
in some weird sort of family
mama fine papa gen and child chris
i can see it




how ironic
male bikki looks like her dad
that is a very specific answer lol
it got fixed pretty damn quickly though

We get a crappy human one
But nooooooo
Hibiki should have gotten a cool robot arm instead
key word *yet*
more is always welcome
it's been improving lately but
symphogear is in desperate need of good fanfiction
fanfics
did someone say
stc delivers once again
https://twitter.com/jaga_mohu/status/997537631998169088
she has no designated waifu
Poor Chris
https://twitter.com/EncRiot/status/993125335368544264
example
they draw Symphogear stuff with a very interesting technique
https://twitter.com/EncRiot/media?lang=en
check out this artist
that's what she said
fine, okay
...no one?
eh

sasuga
let's see...
is it symphogear only?
it looks like she can't do it to whole dumps though
You drew that?
Dont tell me
Waitt
Cos this is some celebrity reception going on here
Im still confused but by the reactions imma assume I did play or see something by him
WAIT I DO?
Oh yeah I do
I do?
What is going on
Who are you and why are you familiar
Hold on
What did I miss?
Wait what
*they're already here*
Unless
All we need now is to get nana or aoi in this discord
Needed some context
Oh ok
that would proceed to cause total havoc at its total bullshitness lol
that would be an amazing twist
But that would be meh cos they already did that
I actually could

oh my, STC colored this
i think the artist too was confused by where her hand was
to be fair

but maybe something like this?
ok so im no drawer or something
cos the angle won't make sense
that means that what you shaded right between them is wrong
i see the elbow behind hibiki's neck
Lily deliverinf the goodsüëå
and don't get me started on the mess around her legs
too many spikes all over the place
too much going on
looks cool, but feels horribly overdesigned
what's with the nehusthtan mikus all of a sudden
He fucking better
What is this magnificent thing
W-what?
<@!193408538909868033>
probably Miku doing or saying something particularly gay
https://twitter.com/vanillealtzy/status/1000388822578819072
the symphogear tag is as interesting as always
https://twitter.com/Cadence_33/status/1002929292475445249
O_O
STC continues to deliver

they keep trying to shoot them with puny guns
the reason humanity keeps losing to the noise is because they don't have enough grenades
who needs singing and friendship when you can just lob one of those fuckers and watch the bad guys explode
ah, hand grenades. The greatest Symphogear.

it's obviously a leaked scene from XV
look
have you not seen sunshine spawn?

maid miku and rogue bikki
if possible, hit us up with everything you have with this specific ship
kerrik
this is too pure
the wholesomeness of maid Miku is just unfair

pictured: a husband and wife in their daily lives
Deflate them a bit, fanartists
Hmmm, bikki with mega boobs not that great civilization

there was a piece you drew
didn't you draw that one DL?
<@&425667771699822614> post Kanades for our friend here

It's the story of a fateful meeting between a gentleman thief and a simple maid of a rich household.
The Dashing Rogue strikes again!
https://twitter.com/alguemexplique/status/1010174095898660868
even if you're a complete idiot, at least Miku will still love you
oh hibiki
https://twitter.com/wassie_sizune/status/1010907592875339776
Miku is the violently protective/jealous type
If it didn't, we'd have to start getting worried
Oh, Ciel. Nice to see some Tsukihime art.
Oh yeah, I remember that Hibiki-sprouting-out-of-Miku's-back one. I even asked the artist what was his inspiration for it, and he said he saw it in a dream
https://twitter.com/zassyu2_ero/status/1013067401103962112

There is no better devil to be tempted by
Oh my for both images

what's 3hz?
lol
I just got it
WAIT
wait
why live
>tfw no one will look at you like how hibiki and miku look at each other
the accentuation of the eyelashes gets me every time
It gives a very different feel
but it's very nice
this artist's style is strange
Oh yeah, there's Senki Zesshou Symphogear and just Symphogear

how can it be so wholesome
that Hibimiku is far too pure for this world
on the demonic side
but the faces are a bit...
very cool
<@!263983345669505025> hit us up with Kanade stuff for her bday!
I thought they just suddenly appear out of thin air
wait, there are people behind image dumps?
It's hot for you too, Kanade? I get you.
oh my~
üëÄ i spy a moka

That one is just ridiculous

well, do you have the hair for it?
so is she gonna crash the bear too

but get this
what if Miku's horn is a reference to lord of the flies and Symphogear is basically an animalistic free for all in a desert island?  ü§î

oh, was confused for a sec why she had a neko face
Miku and Dess talked like, once
Awwww thats adorable!
that new sona skin looks gorgeous
more like improving an outdated product
funny considering Serena is a clingy little sis
i saw 1117
when I checked in
i can't even look through it all
so much bikki
fucking perfect
Lock screen
Since I dont have the courage to be more weeb, this is what I have
just like how Maria is yugoslavian
it was confirmed by kaneko in a book exclusive interview whose source is unknown
nah, it's canon
we all know the reason Kanade died is because if she was still alive, Symphogear would be a harem show
did you see the Yukimura Kanade art that was posted too?
lol was just about to give a normal link but yeah

>Serena and Kanade as ghosts for Halloween
they had leftover frames so to save budget they reused them in a different anime <:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
which aired just a little bit after Symphogear G
unless that screencap is from white album's second season
although a quick google shows that White Album came first, so...
down to the shape of the hair
they look exactly the same
explain now
WHAT
what
DOOMSETTE?!?!?!

omg serena is so adorable in that comic

understandable
the symphogear manga was wild
https://twitter.com/hokan185/status/949303974506582016
kanade would never blush like that
now that i look at it again, it makes sense
so they switched hairstyles, not colors!
ohhhhhhh
they switched eye color too
oh yeah
blue haired bikki
still bizarre to look at
just switched hair colors
who remembers this
fake thicc is bad civilization
something about Maria's proportions doesn't look right

like a maria-colored hibiki and all that
there's a whole gallery of the various wielders with similar changes no?
I really dig that tsubasa-colored maria
that's amazing and frightening all at once
people can make porn off of just concept art these days
i mean I know but goddamn

wakarimasu
Finally some Kiara appreciation
now that was a bloody story arc
not to mention the whole thing with the Shimabara rebellion
he was a fun guy who more or less murdered pregnant christian women and removed infants' scalps.
a rare case of a fanatical buddhist
there was one Tokugawa general named Kato Kiyomasa
so it's likely most of those she converted died
too bad Christians were discriminated against in edo era Japan
and Shirabe who is drawn as Oichi was his little sister
artist kinda shipping Fine x Chris here
Chris is drawn as Nohime, who was Nobunaga's wife
Other fun facts from the images:
I didn't actually
nobody could come up with such a wild sequence of events like the sengoku period
history is stranger than any piece of fiction
By Ieyasu
Mitsunari lost the crucial battle and was executed
For those who know the history,
Hibiki is Ieyasu, and Miku is Mitsunari
that's extra cruel
Oh yeah
out of all the people drawn, only two, being Tsubasa as Masamune and Hibiki as Ieyasu, actually live past the sengoku period
yep
yeah
Only stopping when he got too tired to continue
Charging alone towards the enemy main camp and hacking his way through troops
It's fitting, considering Yukimura was a total badass named Japan's greatest samurai who died a hero
unfortunately, the person Maria is drawn as is more or less a footnote in history
yeah
in fact, she's one of the last ones to die
funnily enough, Kanade doesn't actually die first among everyone here
ah, Shirabe is Ii Naotora
can't really tell from this angle
or it's Fine
Maria - Oda Nobunaga
Miku - Ishida Mitsunari
Kanade - Sanada Yukimura
Not sure who Serena is, but the others are easy
https://twitter.com/rt_imomochi/status/1047837115688472581
there's more
So let's see who's who:
Tsubasa - Date Masamune
Hibiki - Tokugawa Ieyasu
Chris - Nohime
Shirabe - Oichi
Maria - Maria Kyogoku
Kirika - Mori Motonari
finally a compiled list!
In fact, she's one of the most appreciated ones
But she isn't underappreciated
Kanade to Chris: "*Soon.*"
I think
so it can get twitter too
iirc it puts it though SauceNAO
and Shirabe will look for it
post the pic here

chris is gonna die
we sinned too much
we dont deserve wholesome hibimiku
we're going to need all the hibimiku we can get if that XV commercial is anything to go by
only kamen rider would make such weird hand gestures
can't believe I recognized it
is this a kamen rider reference?
and the hibimiku was going so well too
<:TsubasaDisgust:349013662775902209>

shirabe you disappoint me

oh, unyon
"ANO ONNA"
oh jeez
***YANDERE ALERT***
i've heard things, but never watched it
or write a beautiful story that makes one cry?
as in be complete and utter assholes to other for no reason?
Genjuro is Fine while Ryoko is normal
serena is alive instead of maria
tsubasa is the one that dies
miku is the one that goes to the concert
easy fanfic material
all it'd have taken is miku going to the concert instead, which could've happened
this easily could've been symphogear honestly
with the best color scheme ever and the coolest theme
Cross-z Magma
yeah
from the Cooler's Revenge film, I think
wow, a dbz reference
like holy shit
just seeing a few clips of it on youtube really demonstrates how not innocent this show was
for uh...reasons
I liked her
what's the ginger's name? Sam?
Oh god
water color?
whoa
~~XV ending spoiler~~
wat
jyudo fu always delivers
probably calling chris their daughter or something
What the fuck
they took to draw it exactly like a comic book
the gallery itself is even cooler
That is some high octane sunshine
You know you have more
gotta monetize that from now on
let me set up Content ID first and then we're all set
it only counts when it's out of the designated orifices
then there'll be balance in the force
now bikki, miku, and shirabe need to jam
doesn't count
she hasn't jammed once
oh lol that's right
only when you open up a pixiv account and a twitter account and use both every day

It was Maria all along!

dammit, he deleted it
avengers, justice league, pokemon, madoka, nanoha, code geass, symphogear, aaand...something else I'm probably forgetting
there was, if I remember correctly
with so many franchises it was weird as hell
i can't find it now, but he also made one hell of a bizarre megacrossover
so he makes super weird crossovers
he likes western media a lot as you can see

im not sure I dont remember the ovas
or is it an edit?
nice edit

suddenly, shirou emiya
tomosato was best girl all along
i feel like the answer is really obvious but at the same time i'm guaranteed to get it wrong
any hints? or is it a surprise?
hoh
but yeah, I'll always welcome more art from you
I guess it's just my bias speaking really, since I'm kinda burnt out with nsfw stuff
It's more refined, more detailed, and generally better looking
in pretty much every respect
I feel that your sfw art is much, *much* better than your nsfw art
can I be somewhat blunt, lily?
with an especially cute miku
that is also an especially cute bikki
well, I won't say no to sfw lily art
are bikki's boobs really big enough to do that?

dont fail me shirabe
thanks
awwww, you didn't have to Kerrik
Reminds me of the people who unironically think Carnival Phantasm is better than any mainline Fate anime
that's a weird source

There was some official art of "travel style" and thats what she got
She didnt, but it's close enough
cursed image
that is so unfitting it's wraps back around to being perfectly fitting

oh speaking of art
i have a soft spot for crossover art
I didn't notice
oh, that's DMC!?

but Shirabe disappoint
to try and find source
that's why I put it here


like so
they do good shit
ohhhh I know this artist
So Kanade with AnH, Tsubasa with Gungnir, Loli Fine with Ichaival? Bikki with Nehushtan, and Miku is the villain
I'm trying to make sense of the plot for that image
So it's Tsubasa with Hibiki's hair
Hibiki with Tsubasa's hair
Kanade with Chris' hair
Chris with Kanade's hair
they changed hairstyles, not hair colors
there's more good stuff there

I just love how Kerrik is Rany's caretaker
or whatever the term is
uncanoned
or at least
all of which got basically scrapped no?
it's all just the same sort of self insert universe he made up
hell, he doesn't even draw edgebikki
and barely even draws anything related to canon either
the other weird thing about unyon is that he also almost never draws any other character from the series
but alas
his bikki art is very cute
such a shame
now draws self insert
used to draw hibimiku/just general hibiki art
why did you betray us
oh why unyon
*sigh*

Which path shall you pick?
Hibiki, the athletic and enthusiastic childhood friend
Chris, the somewhat dramatic loner
Tsubasa, the student council president
Kirika/o, the rowdy and optimistic kouhai
Shirabe, the smart and silent
Maria/o, the handsome model
if Gear was a shoujo anime

One of the funniest ones I heard was telling them to go get green water when they have nightvision goggles on
"The electricity is leaking here so go grab a bucket real quick we'll fix it with some powder."
mostly cos I heard of these beforehand and so I was ready
never
or telling them they need to sign a contract for Schnitzel
new army recruits who're scared of their own shadows
tell them to go get Electricity Powder
reminds me of some jokes we pulled on new recruits back home
You leave her alone for one second and the entire house is now upside down
Serenade-chan is fanart Kanade and fanart Serena mixed into one
the funny thing is that Ogawa is the manager

Oh my
<@209126772069892096> funny thing is, this image exists

Not that that's a bad thing

https://twitter.com/oonamuamidabutu/status/1184476236971565058
a level below beyblade and those
it was like
old af video game series that eventually got an anime that was pretty popular in japan and overseas
but it's pretty cute
I have no idea why this artist suddenly decided to give them medabots
https://twitter.com/oonamuamidabutu/status/1185564250963472384
Shirabe, Serena, Maria, and Miku offscreen: "Are we a joke to you?"

Then Hibiki offers, but Miku tells her there's nothing left
Then Maria offers
Tsubasa offers to take a load off
Pretty simple
that gaze alone is nsfw

Mordred doesnt like being treated like a girl after all
```It is simple how to deal with Mordred. Do not bad-mouth King Arthur. Do not praise King Arthur. Do not treat him like a woman. Also, do not bluntly treat him like a man. Do not behave in a stiff manner. Do not be infatuated with other Servants. Properly hear his opinions. Simple, right?```
But yeah, I see what you mean

pretty much exactly like kamen rider
so if you want to start, you just pick a season and have at it
aside from the first two
each season is completely independent of the others
you dont need to start from the beginning
the silver lining is
which I think has become a household name in japan
magical girl franchise

cacodemon-chan!
because they made copies without her permission
"Quite an interesting specimen."
they basically super enhanced the image so you can more clearly see the girls in the background and their QUALITY
she looks confused as to why she suddenly has long hair
well it helps he's basically a god
I can't believe nabe's art is getting TLed
that's some sexy sakuga
which precure is it btw lol
nobody would know this is actually precure
that artist's crossovers never make sense
batmaria

what's kirara yuri?
Hmm, I should commission Lily for stuff sometime too
or you can try writing him in jp
nabe definitely knows some english
they're both pretty bad at ara ara
neither actually
some do, like this one
then take another one and call it tsubasa
take one as a pet and call it maria
amoebia gears when
slugs
very cute of her to think that her fellow japanese haven't done that way before him
kinda lost her head there
totally
you can also try diving in rivers and see what treasures you find
unless you like rocks, in which case best diving ever
now make them breed
took me a moment to realize this is leiur and the little sister

top tier waifu
musashi is a goldmine
yeah they're not that crazy hahahaha
essentially, they removed her from the ingame pokedex
nah
of course she'll get one
it's just a temporary thing for the story
but you still can see it if you have your own musashi
you can't view her profile from the servant list
she'll have a banner again eventually
and she still works the same way everywhere else
naturally they wouldn't remove all the musashis players have
only for story purposes, her data was "deleted"
they didn't
lel
also has a choco version
and as fate does, turn him into a waifu
based on the historical musashi miyamoto

Looking slick
Damn Quincy Ichigo
||~~I see you speak my language~~||
miku isn't very subtle
yes, even more than she already was
long hair Miku is 9000% that stereotypical apocalyptic love interest in fantasy stories
aoi yuuki is a very special gremlin
but the omega ultra boobs are a major turnoff
Normally I would like this artist's longhairbikki
yeah the artist just used the background
that's actually kinda cool
but aren't her proportions a little weird?
it's nice
I mean
they gave them the same clothes
in game, she's basically robokiri but with long hair
but even then, I'm pretty convinced robokiri will come back
they did kill off robokiri in her own event, so...
I'll have to give them credit if they do it
but they're definitely trying to make us believe she will
i doubt miku will stay dead

you know the hibiki image is suspicious because she's wearing heels
> A part of me is kind of mad that they killed edgebikki's miku; like, aside from the whole trope thing; I really feel like Edgebikki deserved a happy ending. Like, they didn't have to bring her back like this. They didn't do this to alt Kanade when they went back to her world. No one died (or at least none of her friends and loved ones) in her sequel event. So why did they fridge Edgebikki's Miku?
<@379337518371307522> because they saw XV tsubasa and said "wow we want one of those too!"
if Hibiki doesn't like heels cos they get in the way, Edgebikki uses them so well she can disembowel you with a single roundhouse kick
and they can click together to make one *mega* heel
her shoes in the elekleid are like a weird ice skating thing which is one giant heel while her actual foot also has a heel on it
she wears *double* the heels
you can tell edgebikki is different from normal hibiki by the fact that now only she wears heels
kinda like how in stealth games nobody can catch you if you kill all the guards
I mean if you kill everyone else then you're basically social distancing correctly
but at least edgebikki has social awareness and wears a mask
which will make us scream "oh god it's like xv!" except a little bit more edgy
without the binoculars
we can predict what'll happen from 50 miles away
I mean this is Symphogear and it's Miku we're talking about
oh and there's a dead girlfriend in there too but you know, details
edgebikki wants to be nightwing
and if Hibiki is batman
because batman doesn't kill
and that is why edgebikki said fuck it and picked up the totally not a ninja power armor and went about to kill things
I'm you
then who're you
no you are me
but I'm me
no you are me
wait, I'm you?
hello me, I'm you
me!
or when referred to *by* Hibiki, she gets called...
in dialogue, she gets called Hibiki
> actually does edgebikki get called hibiki (another)?

~~basically copy pasting from that one scene in HF but change the name~~
``There's no resistance.
I end Maria's life with one blow.
"--------"
There were memories.
There was the warmth of life.
Her warmth was always by my side.
I kill her along with those memories.
I search through my mind and throw them away to where I can't find them again.``
the first time I found that image like 2 years ago, I wrote this little snippet:
about that

oh if we're on the train of tsubamari angst...

For those wondering
https://twitter.com/staff_aoi/status/1351075583749484547?s=19
if it's big enough, she'll be in it
Aoi Yuuki is a norm, not a privilege
she has like 5 roles in FGO alone for instance but that's nothing special
so there's no point in pointing out any specific role
Aoi Yuuki is literally everywhere
fantastic!

the artist has around 30 pages of it drawn
it's actually a crossover with Demon Slayer

this is a crime

parents are just grown up versions of said characters
that's how anime is isn't it

yuri harem
``Himoto Sora is a transfer student with a sense of justice and dreams of becoming a knight. Upon arriving at Utopia Gakuen, she learns of a virtual reality-like game played by the male students in which they use girls as weapons in battles for status and treat them as commodities. Seeing one of these girls being abused she steps in and through some sort of error unwittingly becomes the first female participant of the game.``

both fairies and humans stabbed her in the back thousands of times until she couldn't take it anymore
but they also kept on betraying her
part of the people she wanted to save originally were humans too
and that didn't work either
so she changed her strategy and decided to be a tyrant instead
naturally, after thousands of failures, she became bitter and cynical
she did that cycle thousands of times over but the result never changed
tldr, she went full Homura, trying again and again to save Britain from destruction, but every time she got one step away from doing so, she kept on being betrayed by the people and fairies she saved
and then we found out her backstory
that's what we all initially thought too
and the saddest thing is that the story isn't kind to either of them
and is a better overall parent in comparison to Arturia too
Still, she's a better mother to Bao than her original was to Mordred
yep
basically, an alternate universe Morgan who managed to take over Britain and turn it into a kingdom ruled by fairies with humans as slaves/servants
it gets a bit more complicated when you realize that the Morgan you see here is not the same Morgan that raised Mordred
hilariously enough, she is
in the game, Morgan sort of adopts her as her daughter
the new game chapter has a big focus on fairies, which Baobhan counts as one as per folklore
mythologically? none that I'm aware of
/scottish
Baobhan Sith is some sort of british vampire
Ah
it's a bit complicated to explain in full
from a new story chapter that came out
This is from Fate Grand Order
Ah
Fairy Knight Tristan aka Baobhan Sith
they deserved better

of course Ver is going to be a major factor in the plot again because why not
they die in ep one and are immediately replaced
so the girls are going to become hipsters in xv?
so if anyone needed a heavy implication for her, here's one
of Carmilla
is an anagram
Millaarc
fun fact
Eeveeiki
that's without mentioning a Fine-centric series based on her exploits in the past
from various relics and gears to more shadowy organizations
there's a lot they can explore in this world
a spinoff that has scattered cameos from the og cast would be lit
and we can assume spinoffs will follow
xdu is still gonna continue
nah
tsubasa looks like she's wearing a school swimsuit
wish she had the other gauntlets
theyre kinda ugly
the pv
i'm down for that
miku in xv
have classical music play in the background
just do mind flaying like evangelion did it
i wonder what mind flaying will encompass
we've waited 2 years for this day
less than a month fellas
lol what
i mean xdu already did that
of course
who knows, we might just somehow get a 9 wielder song
big finale season
that'd be pretty hype ngl
quick joe! use the power of magic and make it a high quality flac!
i do prefer the other ops better though
the song itself in nice
it's not that terrible
I wonder, would everybody be clapping for Hibiki in the end or would they be too busy holding hands? ü§î
everyone turns to phonic gain
I'll fucking take it!
and have a psychological deconstruction of the character
being unconventional
now that's what i'd call stirring the pot
cos he already has one <:Ver:336656981144109066>
yeah, topdad doesn't need a gear
you get a gear, you get a gear, everybody gets a gear!
what is this, hugtto precure?
that'd be both hilarious and a cause to burn down satelight's office and hunt down kaneko
last ep is the 9 wielders singing synchrogazer
so why not
gotta expect not so great quality
it's still a radio rip after all
<#377148557796442134>
clearly demonstrates Chris' wide array of abilities
my favorite Ichaival  technique
ah, OW
fucking lol
and the text at the end
Hibiki's soft voice
the montage they chose
The slow music
this is the scary one
https://twitter.com/YameteTomete/status/1128670692118028290?s=09
this one
the short preview we got was already scary enough
gives edgebikki vibes
with no pop ups and no ads, there's no danger of accidentally clicking on one and getting viruses
because you're blocking both the ads and the script that forces them through the adblock
I use it all the time and there are 0 problems
<@115223143102152705> you can use tampermonkey to disable kissanime's anti-adblock script to make a very safe site for watching anime
pfft you already forgot
◊¢◊ï◊ì ◊ê◊ó◊ì?!
!!!!!
Miku Ignite doesn't exist but there's not shortage of fanart of it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SsYi575wgE
without them, it's a plain old site
The only bad part of kissanime were the ads
dont worry
lol ok
test it out on random episodes of anime and see if anything weird happens
they shouldn't pop up at all, in fact. But if they do, it should block it
they shouldn't
not only will the site works faster now, it'll also be cleaner to use
at times it's possible the site will *try* to get a pop up, but your various blockers should stop them
the human test still exists, but it's harmless so there's no need to circumvent it
great!
alright, then time to test it out
it should show a list of scripts you got installed
then click on dashboard
click on the tampermonkey extension
ah
test it out, I suppose
Massive exodus to firefox
I think we all will
we can figure it out when the kill switch happens
but at least for now, this'll work
I've heard about it too
https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/4900-kissanime-anti-adblock-blocker
and after it's installed, get this script:
https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo?hl=en
if you don't have tampermonkey yet, get it here
you use chrome right? and you already have adblockers
all of it is wishful thinking
each and every one
i feel like the second song on everybody's track list is going to make us cry
I mean they already have a few
how dare they lewd nana!
so not sleeping is like glitching the system that causes the time to not change
okay but why 25.00
like, what time does that translate to
what does 25.00 even mean
maybe if I project hard enough, it'll actually happen?
*[rave intensifies]*
And the number of memes directly correlates to a show objective quality
Everyone knows memes are more important than anything
Who cares about niche shows when you can **MEME LOL ROFLMAO LMAO üëè üëè üëè **
Not the storyline we need, but the one we deserve
not with cockroaches!
wtf
only moonrune speak in that channel
go full raw
yeah
not cool yo
yo what
where?
they already showed ep 1?
oh wait what
not surprising
maybe
I think
our friends at horriblesubs will be kind enough to rip it for us
who cares about premium or whatnot

"WOW! It's like the thing that happened in that one game that was just released! I sure do wonder what that thing was! Too bad it's on that game that was just released. i bet if I played that game ~~and paied money~~ I would know what the thing was!"
And an equally shoehorned unlimited beats
Remember how axz shoehorned a reference to 3.5?
Gut feeling
I feel like Gear is going to get a movie
*ahem*xdu*ahem*
>Antarctica
>finding something ancient
Maybe it was an evangelion reference this entire time
Also centuries =/= a century
I think surface here just refers to appearing? I highly doubt it's going for the literal meaning here
So sunday
When can we realistically expect the subs?
So
I only like my shows medium well
And then everyone in the world was a precure too
If symphogear had the runtime of a shonen anime, we would undoubtedly have gotten an Ogawa arc
Did Unlimited Beats playing in the background not convince you enough ro roll the gacha?
when the symphoguns don't cut it anymore so you need some good ol' people poofer
that unsubtle foreshadowing
Mommy I'm scared
so can we talk about the ep?
you can stop spoiler tagging
This is giving mad HF flashbacks
Someone said it before and I'll say it again
Like, it's basically setting her up to be an antagonist, if not *the* antagonist
who said anything about SSJ
the miku foreshadowing was so unsubtle it's making me nervous
the ep is already out for everyone
why spoiler tag
scary as hell
the miku foreshadowing was
im gonna be spending an unhealthy amount of time wracking my brain how that miku foreshadowing is gonna go down
every episode is gonna murder us
and that edgebikki reference
that callback to s1
I am not ready for this season
yeah, the others are going to be amazing too
THIS EPISODE
JOE HELP
JOE
it's a little too lacking in subtlety to be a callback
and then miku hits with that other line
did you play HF yet?
cypher
that sort of freezing cold literally makes your atoms stop moving
shouldn't they be dead
I am literally going to die
if that does happen
I made an edit of something from HF that represents my prediction and hope as to how it'll go

Miku's line
at least mine doesn't have drugs!
the dresses obviously
unless the drug is a wedding dress
GEAR BLASTO!
JOE HOLD ME I CAN'T CONTAIN MY HYPE
honestly, XV's opener was one of the best
Just a neat reference
~~it's going heaven's feel instead~~
i've seen him in a mahjong manga
to say that I dislike Jojo and its fanbase would be an understatement to how much I dont like them
cos that's kaneko's other IP
doesn't it take from Wild Arms the most?
just that part of Hibiki raising Adam with ORAs had at least 3 references
there are about as much references to jojo as there are to everything else
aka fist of the north star
yeah, the original reference is ATATATATATATATATATATATATATATA
we can continue in <#377148557796442134> if you want
all of what you said, and more
it was telepathic singing
all fansubs groups are destined to v2 all of their releases
enkidu was created by enki iirc
just because it's in fate doesn't mean other franchises can't use it though
i find it hard to believe kaneko thought that far ahead
i'll pm you
should I point out grammatical errors too?
Ver would've been less meme and more outright disturbing
the girl in ep 1 screaming she doesn't want to die as she's being disintegrated will always have a special place in my heart
don't you love it when you're enemies-turned-friends die to power up your form-fitting super armor?
Im honestly looking forward to seeing everybody else's too
it's shocking how much better it is in comparison to AXZ's
and for symphogear fans, the sheer amount of callbacks and references to other things from gear made it even better
I think cos it speaks to both magical girl fans and mecha fans
the whole mechanical aspect to it makes it even better
It helps it isn't purely a magical girl show with sparkly lights
the japanese probably have their own equivalent
i think purely western
who think popularity correlates to quality
but sites like mal are just glorified popularity contests
like, it's awesome gear is on the top of any list, yeah?
that was your first mistake
>mal
~~at least chris doesn't cause people to spam the comment section of the the artists' youtube vids~~
they haven't gotten sued yet, sooo
chris has a multitude of band references in her attacks
I imagine Shirabe will dance and skate in her own sequence
shirabe should be the one good at that
and then he sues me in return for using his IP and not paying for it lol
let's see if XV will give me any interesting ideas
lel
except this time she's doing it of her own will
end episode
we see Miku's phone ring
cut to lydian
the leader of the new trio making a call
I'm half-expecting something like
peace is an illusion
that is if she stays wife and doesn't turn into the big bad all of a sudden
yeah I was kinda having trouble seeing if you're being sarcastic or not lol
when was the last time trauma was depicted well in anime
that's more an anime thing imo saki
not enough people remember that
fucking freezing the quarks inside the atoms
that amount of cold should've killed them and pretty much turned the air into a solid no?
they referenced trump and climate change lol
imagine the live for it
this song sounds like it'll be fire
oh shit
powerlevels of temperature indeed
at least that could be understood
they should've just googled absolute zero and ended it with that
what scale could it possibly be though
yeah but in every scale it makes no sense
not even outer space is that cold
such is the way of big numbers
yeah, such extreme temperatures are impossible to comprehend with our current knowledge of how they work
his most famous role is Future Trunks
TAKESHI KUSAO!
I WAS RIGHT!
YES!

who's his voice actor?
wait!
oh
wait why did we decide he's Enki again?
so many
the callbacks fellas
honestly, I'd say that's the best reward they could get after everything they've done
without the burden of saving the world
it'd let the girls finally have the chance to live a normal life
i'd actually be fine with it if that happened
that'd be a nice way to end it
except I never expected canon symphogear to do so
you're damn right
i am not prepared
null
zilch
zero
nope
yes
"Bad things are not going to happen!" Kaneko says, as various bad things are starting to happen
i expected a more solemn sounding track tbh, but this works well too
muh heart can't handle it
why u do dis
that B-side lyrics
yeah lol wtf is that number
tsubasa's b-side will probably be really nice
i dont remember her crying at the time
whoa
JOOEEEE
No more kthx
We've had enough forced memes in Gear
<:TsubasaDisgust:349013662775902209>
>meme potential
IM STILL CRYING JOEEEEE
4kids plot right there
IM STILL CRYING JOEEEEE
JOEEEE
im not sure what it's supposed to be
Context kerrik
Lol what
Just look at their cast members
IS PRETTY NEAT SO FAR
SO XV PEOPLE
and see her just bounce over the ground
tell her to tuck in and push
i'd roll serena down a hill in that
so serena's soul returns from the afterlife and fuses with maria's, giving her a namekian power boost and unlocking maria's new shonen powerup
it's probably easy to tell that SONG is gonna get invaded by that trio and the Gear rush to defend
well, from the screens
ribbons lol
it usually 'signifies' an important event in the episode
ok, vampire chick can fly
it hasn't even aired yet
dropping spoilers here for next ep like crazy
One of ya gotta compromise
That cant work yo
Tfw you two have nearly the same exact pfp
a shaking jpeg
I can see where kananon is coming from tbh

They really made her Obviously Vampire
If carmilla and liz fused
that was an omega oof
oh yeah melua I remember that part
hibiki did set off too many flags
chris isn't wrong
They dont mean anything and dont make sense, but words they indeed are
Those are certainly words
Watashi mou shindeiru
I am the dead
It's over for me
I can't guys
I cant
I AM NOT ABLE TO CAN
IM NOT READY
I CAN'T
WHAAAAAAAATT
WHAAAAAAATTTT
WHATTTTTTT
WHAT
WHAT
EPISODE
THIS
WAS
WHAT
holy shit
all of them dead
100k people
I CAN'T
GUYS
maybe a metaphor for the ancient civilization?
I wonder what its symbolism means
the scorpion at the end though is interesting however
am I missing some symbolism here?
it doesn't look like a scorpion though
huh
fucking Carmilla not playing around
this episode
god
Made her a mole!
She may have just brainwashed Basa!
that vampires have the powers to enchant people!
remember
guys!
HOLY SHIT
every single episode of this season is gonna kill us
perhaps possession?
and something will happen
and then force it on her
SHe'll then discover she's pure
After obtaining the bracelet
Vanessa is 100% going to kidnap Miku
Ok, so predictions for how the season will go
she can channel that again?! holy shit
she looks like she has thigh highs in the shot
isn't that a completely new form?
wait a second
yeah it doesn't look like one
we have much better stuff
as if this season needs something so shitty
dont ruin with jojo
<:TsubasaDisgust:349013662775902209>
and when it gets to later, it's gonna destroy us
they're gonna raise the shock every episode
I was not ready for this episode
all of the callbacks
They're going for power with the callbacks to season 1
Tsubasa is gonna be broken af for a while
and Kirika getting her scythe stuck
Like the beasty girl luring them inside the ship, where they can't maneuver all that well
it approached things in a smart manner!
and it actually felt smart!
He made both G and GX bad by default
Ver will only reduce what we have so far
even the yuri tease
they upped everything
but damn did he leave an impression this time
it's a little too early to tell
**I LOVE IT**
it's going to get worse
for basa and for everyone
fucking hell
and s1 was just unsure of when it was
it probably is
She has to deal with Granda/daddy too
This season is gonna be harsh on her
She was losing her shit
Tsubasa's expression were fucking gold
God
*can they top it*
<@87512939107450880> I still have a higher body count though
THE SYMPHOGEAR I'VE ALWAYS WANTED IS HERE!
FINALLY
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
holy shit
nobody survived
no mercy
dead
100,000 people
fucking
god damn
THE BRAKES WEREN'T INSTALLED
THERE'S NO STOPPING THE CRAZY TRAIN
She's going to get kidnapped
she has special appearances both in the op and ed
of course she will Tails
yeah, this sort of unexplained thing will hit us hard when we least expect it
it also might've like locked into a traumatic state
Seal Invasion it was called
so it's quite possible she just brainwashed basa while her mental state was fragile
vampires are associated with hypnotism
this carmilla is a vampire
we'll literally die
yo if carmilla turned her into a mole
non-responsive
she's going to be catatonic
she's gonna stop singing and fighting for a while
Chris probably won't get a big meaningful arc since she already had a bunch
<@87512939107450880> yorokobe shounen
so it can have many meanings
cos she said it in japanese
i wonder if there's another translation for that ability
you're gonna see her every ep now
considering in the OP, Vanessa's section focuses on hibiki, chris, *and* miku
probably
it'll be forced on her
sorry fool is probably gonna be miku
she had a beyblade!
ty
I missed it completely the first time you posted it
millhi, got that tweet again?
they probably weren't sure when to place it
I thought it was pretty good, but yeah it was on the...seductive? side
they may have gotten the length of the thigh highs wrong then
it's an international incident
g-beat probably reams
Tsubasa is going to massacre her
carmilla is gonna fucking die
no bullshit
they meant business this time too
each episode wait is gonna be excrutiating
god
BIT BEAST ZABABA
what forms did they take
also, their shadows in the OP
might be a bit too early to tell
but at least SG was somewhat noble
at least, in the end
galaxy cross got fucked too
all of them did
actually
pretty much
a bit too serious
yeah, Carmilla was going straight for her
maybe the keywords will have something to tell us about Carmilla's ability
so she's a robot
oh yeah, Vanessa has a rocket punch in the op
frankenstein's monster
it's gonna destroy me
I can't wait to see what they'll do with Miku
god
which is good
so far we're getting major callback scenes
and before they even have the time to realize what's happening they turn to dust
first the noise cuts them in half
that's extra cruel isn't it sketch
and that was what would've set off basa
we would've gotten a very solemn death scene if he had died
so...
the two seasons he was prominently featured in are more or less considered the weaker seasons
Well, let's look at it this way...
you think he could make any move in bed
the guy could barely walk straight
daughter he had with who exactly
>daughter
They definitely arent
I expected them to be half silly
"Just let me kill them all will you"
and how she was like to Tsubasa
Carmilla meant business right off the *bat*
I want him to do better
I mean, I'd actually be glad if he did better than me
i think everybody died there btw
looks like he's going all out too, the maniac
SOL is not gonna be a factor this time imo
after last time, you gotta realize you need more escape routes
also, why did they build a stage like this again
very pointy
it's like
although Basa's nose lol
goddamn
they should've had all of the Gears there
hell, it's possible she always did and it was just never addressed
basa has major ptsd now yeah
they probably didn't think they needed them
even his ninja skills can't help against the noise
is it possible tsubasa and maria got revealed as gear wielders now
LET THE EDGE FLOW THROUGH YOU!
YES KERRIK!
I LOVE IT
THANK YOU KERRIK, I BLAME ME TOO
and making wild predictions
trying to unravel the mystery
it's actually fun when episodes create a surge of headcanon
gimme YT version first millhi
I finally calmed down
ok
we'll need to wait for TL anyway
is it a keyword?
except not even CJ experienced such harsh PTSD
NOT EVEN THE MEMES ARE SAFE
wdym?
something like that
"If I was the one causing trouble for others, what would you do?"
being so hype and having so much to speculate
it's amazing
i know right?!
i really do
i hope it keeps up the tone and quality
seriously
i expected them to kiss
that dmjii falling scene was like
also, they seriously increased the yuri tease
the op and ed basically confirmed it
we are going to cry
bad stuff will happen to miku
for us to get destroyed
are you ready
lily
just good?
or outright turn her into a mole/spy/manchurian agent
our current theories are either locking Basa into this traumatic state
we don't know
that shit is gonna make us cry even harder
that eye power
and then there's whatever Carmilla did to her
"Oh no she's gonna use her as a hostage! But it's fine, she's gonna survi‚ÄîOH MY GOD WHAT THE FUCK HOLY SHITTTTTT!!!"
establishing character moment: impale a little girl on your hand in front of the target
Cags wasn't really evil
not Ver evil
but good pure evil
sometimes pure evil villains is refreshing
have fun
https://dynasty-scans.com/chapters/marking
https://dynasty-scans.com/chapters/hrs
https://dynasty-scans.com/chapters/wish_on_a_star
and everything becomes sad
and then it's just Hibiki reenacting Carmilla's act on Miku
you go into that doujin expecting lewds
but what if Miku is the god
maybe
...
I will believe everyone will live
Well, Symphogear tends to have hopeful ending
~~lily, tell me after what you liked more, mine or XV~~
good
lots of suffering incoming
imagine lydian getting blow to smithereens again
Imagine if the new villain trio go for the innocents like the stroganettes
At this point, I'm really expecting a Thanos snap out of nowhere to delete half the cast
Endgame spoilers: 
||https://twitter.com/rx_HTS/status/1150102169007218688||
XV ending confirmed
not as brutal? people were getting bisected
It's an American conspiracy!
I know!
no
!
it's always Larry's fault
"Nah, the Noise are gone. They won't appear again," one engineer said, laughing off his friend's concerns.
why do they keep building these stages with like 2 exits and hovering 200 meters off ground level is another question
as much as making basa into winter soldier would be fun
latter could be crazy but I don't see that happening either
Milaarc's namesake used to bathe in the blood of virgins
Well
Yooo
People Stroganoff?
i also didn't expect it which makes it even better
that sustains me
I'm loving this suffering
just scour what they have there Maya
being symoger is suffering
don't they look like they don't line up?
I can't help but notice Basa's teeth in this shot
especially a villain that's actually evil and not just anti-hero
YOU WERE NOT PREPARED
they were never installed
There are no brakes on this train
so he's still around
he was alive when little girl-chan got donuted
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5JICa_ZxBk
tsubasa's mind right now
warning: earrape, possibly distressing

Clorox?
what other cleaning detergent would you prefer Kerrik?
inb4 Tsubasa returns from training in Soul Society and hits Carmilla with that UBW
yes
it would
lol cypher
if you're weaker than the enemy, just make them lose their cool
truly following through with Sun Tzu's strategies
and Basa, who's now non-functional
how they'll be dealing with this disaster
ep 3 will probably be a major aftermath episode
the op and ed did the waving for her
that's true
4 is death
otherwise this meguca would go very loca
We're very lucky Coobie isn't involved
by probably forcing her to relieve her trauma again and again
I both know and don't know how mind flay works
she probably isn't gonna calm down for a while
carmilla gotta get turned into ice cubes
no more of that friendship shit
because she's evil like that
With more suffering!
We'll stop this suffering with the only way we know how
oh meta just saw the ep?
I already did my share
Don't look at me
It's sad cos all the kamen rider x gear fanfics are really bad
there're seven lights

Miku in the previous season stinger: "I AM GONNA BE IMPORTANT!"
MIku in XV ep1: "I AM GOING TO BE IMPORTANT!"
OP and Ed: "MIKU IS GONNA BE IMPORTANT!"
Fans: "I wonder if Miku will be important?"
>Maria has a silver arm
>Maria has crosses in her attack cards
>Vampires are weak to silver and jesus
Maria will kill Carmilla confirmed
Hibiki's was fire
First half: Full of dess!
Second half: Full of **DEATH!**
some reddit comment was gold
Cos this Kiri one kinda tested the line
I hope he calms down for the others
<:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
Symphogear explodes into the scene with a killer opening act and a Crunchyroll support
·µÉ‚Åø·µà ·µê·µÉ ≥·∂¶·µÉ
**T S U B A S A**
XV will dictate that
heh
Imma enjoy it for as long as it lasts
of course

<:HibiMiku:432007202136391690>
https://twitter.com/zoid9000/status/1150515556690386951
except there's probably a secret step nobody knows that is vitally important for the conversion to succeed
well, after XV we'll finally the complete package
i think the problem is that it was only used within this one season and then never seen again
or whatever?
or animation director?
iirc every transformation has a different animator?
it reminded me of panty and stocking
the thigh part was honestly the worst of it
suddenly here they catapulted it to lewd af levels
in GX there wasn't any and in AXZ it was tame and fine
even this toned down version was a little too much
tbf he did go overboard
Miku in the previous season stinger: "I AM GONNA BE IMPORTANT!"
MIku in XV ep1: "I AM GOING TO BE IMPORTANT!"
OP and Ed: "MIKU IS GONNA BE IMPORTANT!"
Fans: "I wonder if Miku will be important?"
Aoi did say something about ep 4
ah, then Miku being kidnapped is an easy one
I actually think it'd be a waste to do the mind flay thing again
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjMjGkZ_RM4
you want stuff like this?
Hibiki's rocked because it was cool and had a bunch of callbacks
IT SHOWS HOW MUCH KANEKO DID HIS RESEARCH
I LIKE HOW THE POSES OF THE AUTOSCORERS ARE BASED ON DIFFERENT DANCE STYLES AMIRITE
>christianity
~~ah, so that's why jojo is like a disease and spreads all over the world, right?~~
>not that many
>200
all of you
heathens
‚úù
<:ElfneinBullying:421432763078410241>

>tfw the first thing people say about the the dance moves of the autoscorers in GX is that they're jojo
>tfw the first association people have with vampires now is jojo
there is no longer justice in this world
I was gonna say Hibiki was the hero but Ver was unironically more useful than her in GX
We are promised something major in ep 4 and I honestly cant wait
Rising action at its finest
These two first episodes were fantastic
I goddamn hope it doesnt
It was smart and *felt* smart
It gave each of them their own moment in the spotlight and even showed their adaptable and clever fighting style
Honestly I really liked what ep 2 did with dmjii
A minute later says shes not a sword and then wins
Gets beaten up for being a sword
It was still hilarious how it was done
They do need to explain what Airgetlam not actually being Airgetlam means
Serena even has that teddy bear in her hand
Was Kanade in the opening? i forgot
Suddenly, on horror movies, it makes you shit your pants
Usually a cute kids song
Like twinkle twinkle little star
I can see Apple getting an actual darker twist in a flashback and presented as a creepy children's song while people die enmass

Except Symphogear isnt a mystery and therefore they dont feel as important
You'd need to have an uncannily keen eye to notice those hints and put them together
Like one of the more subtle hints is that Shirabe's hair, while down, resembled Fine's
It's been a while since Ive seen G, but I believe that there were signs pointing to Shirabe
Not...necessarily
Because it increases the excitement
In a way, being this blunt is fun
Miku with the giant neon sign in ep 1
It's not even that mistaken, to be perfectly honest
You see it a lot both in and outside of anime
Yeah, in Japan that sort of concept is common
It's such a boring and generic option
If it's excalibur Ill be mad
All the torments she'll go through be internal
Maybe Fudou's appearance will be inside Basa's head all along
But seeing as she specifically has the head device on in the op makes me believe that'll be the direction
Maybe, maybe not
Elfnein will probably be critical in fixing Basa
You know, seeing the op again
Whether or not you think it's enough is something else, but they are there
Enough to throw doubt on the Kirika is Fine idea
But they did
The thing is, if we weren't given hints before hand, *then* it'd be lies/misdirection
She was already worried from before the concert
They let their guard down
They also couldnt expect the attack to occur in such a blatant manner
They're hardly ever proactive
The Gears are always reactionary after all
As said, some people are bothered by different things
It's mostly nitpicks at times
It'd be worse if nobody criticized it in any way
You can still like something despite its flaws
When she had multiple concerts beforehand
Yeah but they only do it *now*
It's kinda interesting how *now* they touch upon a possible PTSD for Tsubasa
**suffering must be increased**
**EDGEBONER ACTIVATED**
Tbh, if this was madoka, we'd have six witches almost immediately
If she was meguca, she'd have gone loca
As said
Inb4 the mummy was Fine's original corpse
In a way, Basa's gut feeling was a warning
But Maria and Ogawa told her to focus
Remember how she said that she feels like she should be helping protect the corpse?
I can never remember how to spell her name so I just call her Carmilla
but none of us expected a crushing scene like the one we got
we can speculate based on what we know
it's too early to assume anything about the season
the contrast between the two I feel served its purpose well
while still looking cute
ruthless, evil, and psychotic
she was a very good villain despite looking like she pukes rainbows
Nui from Kill la Kill
Nui!
what was her face again...
and have no self awareness
glad you missed the point
stop pretending it's an obligation
It's just looks like you're deliberately watching the show just to spit on it right in front of everyone
nah, I'm going to say it as it is, cos it's been going on for a while
fat load of good that's doing
then why are you watching it
glad we came to that agreement
wonderful
so are you finally going to stop bragging about how much you dislike symphogear?
JUST FANFIC IT
Do you have a secret desire to be an anime MC with a harem of girls?
Does the show have too much of those unchristian rainbow chasers? just fanfic it!
Does the show chicken out of the OTP you've had forever? Just fanfic it

but we *can* fanfic it
ü§î
tsubasa ain't getting her own Bikki to life-lesson to is she
instead of just giving new costumes to the same 9 characters all the time
completely new cast and original ideas
honestly, XDU should have been to Symphogear what Magia Record is to Madoka
XDU doesn't make use of its main premise at all
symphopoi, you're making this personal again when it shouldn't be. I ask you not to do so, because it adds nothing to the conversation. I merely said I don't agree with that mindset. A lot of people are okay with it, but I'm not. Not once did I ever try to belittle anyone else's experiences. All I did was point out my own, and that my way of enjoying and consuming media involves being highly critical of it. That's how I do it and that's how I enjoy it.
you're jumping to conclusion about my perspective again
I'm personally a very critical person, and I cannot in good conscience just do this "turning your brain off". Hell, I don't even understand what that actually means. What the process behind that phrase even says to do.
And that way is the "only" way
While I agree with those last points, the impression the overall message gives me is that there is a "correct way" to enjoy something
Nothing good ever came out of purposefully shutting your eyes to the flaws
I personally don't agree with this mindset
that's all there is to it
so just stop doing it
nothing good or interesting comes out of that kind of talk
hell, I still do it at times
I know exactly how that goes, because I did that exact same thing with jojo
there's giving criticism, and then there's just calling it bad, refusing to elaborate on why you think it's bad, and then parading that opinion for all to see
you're acting like you're doing us a favor that you're watching it
just stop, and come back to it when your passion for it reignites
forcing yourself to see it when you're not enjoying it will only mar the experience and give you the worst impression possible
exactly
no one is forcing you
you don't like it? then stop
stop acting like you're doing it out of obligation
I can also go to a jojo server, put a giant neon "FUCK JOJO" in my username, and then hide behind the "you're just mad I have a differen opinion" arguement
you say that after having had a giant neon sign in your username stating "I DONT LIKE SYMPHOGEAR"
so why are you still doing it
you've made that clear plenty of times
but clearly you are not
funnily enough, i get to the same conclusion. As strange as it sounds, part of the fun for me is to loudly proclaim my confusion at some bizarre decision the work's creator took with its direction, and how sometimes I think even some of my favorite creators are total hacks
I don't intend to delegitimise other people's ways of enjoying stuff. Just stating my own and why i don't agree with that mindset.
to get back to the original discussion, I personally cannot find it in myself to do this "turning your brain off". When that phrase usually comes, it's when the work at hand requires a heavy amount of suspension of disbelief, which I find difficult to give so freely. That's part of the reason I simply cannot like jojo, because the bar it sets for that disbelief is too high for me to readily accept. I simply cannot *not* nitpick when I can. While that has ruined a lot of shows for me in the past, it also made the shows that did grab me a thousand times more enjoyable and made me a thousand times more passionate about them.
it's fine. I'm already satisfied with an apology. I don't do hugs, sorry <:HibikiWhoops:585839808115507222>
I can understand it. When you're so used to terrible people, you start assuming everyone is terrible even when the new environment is nowhere near as terrible as what you're used to
Not every exchange of opinions has to come from a place of trying to prove who's more right. There are cases where that's true, but we're all sensible people here. The not sensible ones are a lot more blatant. We've seen plenty of those over time.
I can sympathize with that, honestly. I've also had my fair share of bad experiences around assholes, and it does color your perception of people's intentions. But as Melua said, assume good faith. Give the speaker on the other end the benefit of the doubt, and try to approach discussions with a positive attitude.
there was potential to do it well and then they just...didn't
it's a shame really
hahahaha topdad
remember Krika, everything can be solved with fanfics
it could be fun, but in the end it's a minute detail that doesn't really affect the overall narrative in any meaningful manner
probably magick'ed her dna
symphogear is subtle like that
it was basically another major flag that shit will go down
Miku is the track and field one
Wheres that image of showing buff bikki with Miku drooling in the background
And got a dragon drunk
Turned a woman into a comb
Susanoo was the asshole who threw a flayed horse into his sister's house
Tsubasa Super Heavenrend 3?!?!
Super ascended?!?
Maybe
XV will let her shine
Realitically, Tsubasa's back would be ripped af due to how kuch she swings
A girl could literally be a loli and lift up a mountain if it fits their purposes
I mean it's anime
Or at least, used to be
Not dash
You add two of ~ before and after the text
If she actually lives long enough to go to college
She has so many different types of projectiles and has to calculate the ballistics of each type
Since her strategy more or less involves just punching the problems away
Arguably, I think Hibiki is the least strategically minded of them all
In a way, every one of them can do that
For academics, we cant include Maria
She was able to manever a helicopter in the middle of a missile barrage
She knows how to operate several vehicles well
Maria has a lot of technical knowledge
Hmmmm
I was glad to see the scene in ep 1 where she gets the chance to be a sniper
You have to be good at math and ballistics to aim as accurately as she can
She get high grades in every subject
But she's probably a math whiz
Hence why she's bad at fitness
Probably nothing, considering it's a magical body suit made from singing
Doesnt make them any less scary
Or are messed up ebough in the head to have it earlier
Which is something you either learn through tough military training
Before dying like all of the regular fodder
In reality none of us would want to be in anime world
I doubt they'll be in it forever
Truly the husband and wife
She wastes it all on food
And increase it by a certain amount
Probably take the average pay a JSDF member gets
Must be one hell of a paycheck
~~
Dont forget flyinf migrating panties
Pfffft
Miku is a given
Ep 3 will probably be a major aftermath ep
Yes
Actually good combos
"Yes! I've always wanted one of those! Now all I need to do is die--"
*little girl dies*
"Damn it!"
I can see that happening in a hypothetical abridged series
Tfw Tsubasa is just mad she didnt get to have her own Bikki
series takes place like 20-30 years in the future
it might be futuristic gas masks
why would that be a problem?
...but symphogear already had a concert massacre shown back in s1?
Let's not pretend it's sunshine and rainbows: the anime
In any case, Gear having heavier moments isn't something out of the ordinary considering it already had them in the first place
Even if in the west gear isnt all that talked about, Japan loves it
It took a calculated risk and it worked
And people lap it up
Halfway decent will be enough
It doesnt even have to be good
The thing is that in a sea of samey looking trash, you gotta fill the gap with something interesting and unique
Even the first season, which had a lower budget
And it worked
It's a magical girl type show with a focus on singing, and has quite an all star cast to its name. It then added heavier, more gruesome scenes to spice it up
Symphogear actually took plenty of risk
Both of which are atrocious
If you dont, you get smartphone and arifureta
That means taking risks
Pretty much
But now, unless you actually do something different, nobody will give shit
It worked with SAO at the time
And it almost always tanks
It's the safest bet they have at the moment
Just look at the isekai trend
Funnily enough, it's when they *do* take risks is when they actually succeed
a show that did grimdark badly was special ops asuka
a show imo that did grimdark well is fate zero
grimdark on its own is fine as well, but it needs to have a purpose
just because there's a message of hope, doesn't mean the road to get there has to be sunshine and rainbows
but there's plenty of death and destruction and despair and blood
sure, it isn't grim dark suffering edgemaster9000
symphogear isn't as light hearted as people make it out to be
it never gave the impression it was trying to be light hearted though
many studios come up with various ideas for the things they want to do, but not everything passes either due to irrelevance, technical difficulties, or moral/ethical reasons
an idea being allowed through the committee, or something like that
???
unleashing them by accident on pedestrians in the street
some dumb teenagers getting their hands on alca-noise capsules through the black market
dumb politicians claiming the noise "aren't so bad"
noise simulators uploaded as games to symphosteam and getting a huge controversy
and then you have the cults worshipping the noise as messengers from heathen coming down to purge the unworthy
shaky vidcams on symphofacebook of noise attacks
symphoworld 4channers loling at people dying
bunch of tinfoil hatters calling the noise a government conspiracy
I can just imagine the cultural, social, and political effects the noise would have on the world
kinda like making a hitler plushie or something
ü§î do you think the people in symphoworld are morbid enough to make noise plushies?
it was a killer performance, yeah
or "This is the best concert ever! Nothing can ruin it!"
for an extra dose of subtlety, have someone comment on how "the noise haven't shown up in a while"
well, symphogear was never exactly subtle, so it fits perfectly
and her dad says with a smile, "after the concert, okay honey?"
how she wishes she could talk to her even once
saying how much she admires her and how she bought all her cds
imagine if just before the concert, we'd have seen a scene of the girl fangirling over basa
https://twitter.com/M_hisashi/status/1151511441796526081/photo/1

If you cry you lose
So I dont even know what to expect
Dmjii in ep 2 seriously made me think they were gonna kiss
XV's finale will probably be mega gay
Yeah, something like that
It also works as an anagram apparently
Metanoia - ai no tame
To change one's way of life through spiritual conversion
Apparently
Dem fighting words

yay!
¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
which made me think this particular event was going to be brought up again next ep
i thought you were sharing something from next ep's preview
despite popular belief, i don't actually think that thing was a literal hole in her head
i dont like what im seeing
why is the xv logo on this
nanikore
where unstoppable killing machines appear out of nowhere at random intervals and turn people to dust with their touch?
can you imagine living in a world like this
moms telling their kids that if they're naughty, noise will come to get them
them evil vidyagames that teach kids how to kill and shiz
not the noise themselves
not the people who acquired the capsules through shady dealings
but of course, symphotrump would blame video games on massacres caused by people unleashing noise
Now she went from a nostalgic memory to outright PTSD
his appearance in AXZ was just headdesk worthy
he's crazy from the outset with no explanation and that just didn't really help
a backstory for him would've been helpful
but all he did was succeed in bringing it down further
he might've been more tolerable had symphogear as a whole was written better
Personally I'm not that fond of the meme character archetype
no accounting for taste I suppose
which in the end happened
Ver got memed into other seasons which only made me dislike him more
a kind of unconvincing masterplan, but one nonetheless I suppose
Because the whole of G basically revolved around making him succeed by making everyone else insanely stupid
I only dislike Ver out of all the villains
well made villains are fascinating to watch
Cos you aren't lol
you were wrong from the moment you said "am i the only one"
because people like him actually exist
I think the reason he's hated so much is also because he's also fairly realistic
even greater than Ver because he was actually important
topdad was another victim of the show's poor writing
and her own perception of him
with the direction it's going, I feel that Basa's main conflict with him will actually be inside her own head
gib tls kthx

me and the gang coming to fuck you up
preview images are up!
http://symphogear-xv.com/next/XVnext03.php
Tomorrow puts Carol's daddycon tendencies in full swing
Nvm then
Blergh
What if she used to be an FIS child like them?
Speaking of Elsa and her similarity to Maria and her designated conflict with Dmjii...
Gear make one feel old
there's no indication it is, so I think it's all fine
I think we'd have known by now if it was delayed
```There's no resistance.
I end Maria's life with one blow.
"--------"
There were memories.
There was the warmth of life.
Her warmth was always by my side.
I kill her along with those memories.
I search through my mind and throw them away to where I can't find them again.```
end result of that image:
All this speculation
Maria thighs >>>>>>>> Kiri thighs
she gon' die
literally gets worse every second
well, not like they've ever been subtle
they're not even subtle with the references
carmilla bathing in the blood of young virgins

Everyone to Hibiki at the end:
"Congratulations!"
Komm s√ºsser Tod
**GIVE ME MORE**
*I love it*
and I remember the funky one with the horn from GX's opening swiping across the screen
at least, the left one
they have the glowing appendages
wait no
HUH?!?!
HUH
huh
!
~~why did you react to yourself~~
unreleased voice clip from xdu
original voice

*looks right*
*looks left*
inb4 the revolver is broken like 2 seconds later
https://twitter.com/urakata_/status/1152588964483620864
not after what she did!
also, millaarc doesn't get to be cute!
YOU BASTARD
FUDOUUUUUUUUUU
FUDOUUUUUUIUUUUUUUUUUUUUUI
FUDOUUUUUUUUUU
next ep is gonna be a killer
goddamn
MILLENNIAL NOISE
NOISE ON SEGWAY
I can't believe she called the attack on the hospital
she doesn't get to cry
carmilla doesn't deserve empathy
purposefully called the attack on the concert in order to make tsubasa a blade
the bloody bastard sacrificed more than 70k people to yell at tsubasa
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shem_HaMephorash
also, shem-ha
and it'll be forced on her
more like Miku will get kidnapped
IT IS
YES
maybe with a sword
and where his plan lead
we need to see his complete involvement
too early to say
and humble
I'm just patting myself on the back for being such a genius
can it be next week already kthx
someone has to be his mitsuhide to his nobunaga
then someone has to betray him when he's halfway through his conquest
if tenka fubu
is that even a thing
RH something
dmjii have been on fire these two episodes
thank god carmilla's seal didn't work on bikki
detailed wrinkles
I can't
NO IT JUST MEANS HER BIRTHDAY IS ON THE 13TH
symphogear isn't subtle
Although it was painfully obvious he was going to be an antagonist
I will never not go berserk about Fudou
KISAMAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
FUDOUUUUUUUUUU
lol, it helps Saya is voiced by Nana
first impressions are the most important after all
they first had her massacre nearly 100k people and fuck with tsubasa for shits and giggles
but they didn't
had carmilla been first presented as all about that family business, then maybe she'd be a little easier to swallow
Miku invited her to the concert therefore she feels guilty Hibiki's life was "ruined" even though it gave her purpose and a shitload of money
there is literally 0 way it's love related
it's going to be the whole "I'm sorry your life was ruined because of me" thing
someone take them to a marriage councillor
their martial problems will end up destroying the world
it's like dying after being run over by a golf cart
how embarrassing is it to get killed by mooks using segways?
segway noise tho
nope
it got so bad, even the noise are in on it
of course Fudou would complain about milennials
Sufficiently advanced science is indistinguishable from magic
More like
they do everything a married couple do *except* anything explicit and intimate on screen
it's honestly brilliant how they did that
at most, I see them doing the nanoha thing
but they also need to draw in the waifuers
they'll make it as heavy as they can get away with
I highly *highly* doubt they'll ever go beyond teasing
the whole "I'm sorry I invited you to the concert and ruined your normal life" and shit
Well, we already know what it's all about
what do you mean
lol what
that's...how emptying the contents of your skull works
cos you'd be dead
no
it's like they knew you were going to model it
his legend got distorted by people's beliefs
the entire reason he has it is because people believed him to be Dracula
How Vlad has Legend of Dracula as an NP and didn't want to use it?
yeah but remember in Apo?
Also you have Servants like Vlad, who are so bound but the belief of the people that it alters them physically
the Servants get stronger the more people know of them
Fate runs on this thing
all of them, REAMS
except they try to explain it
same shit happens in Fate too
~~i also made a full fic out of it but ignore me~~
I was insanely disappointed
and then it didn't pan out
the cocoon in AXZ had me up in arms for the full week
although it's a total cop out most of the time
mikugear probably also drove people nuts
that's how they keep you hooked and crazy
just flay is used for the more grotesque skin one
both meaning to scrape away something
yeah I mean, flay and abrade are fairly synonymous
but never elaborated on what that means
the keywords state carmilla's ability is along the lines of mind flay
aoi yuuki's own words
it's plenty obvious how things will go down from here
just his call shut off the lights
Tsubasa would fucking kill him harder for this
imagine if he more or less orchestrated Kanade's death
yoooo
next ep is the biggest oof ep we're going to get it seems
grandpa is mean now
Thatd actually ironically be fitting
Like how basa has permafear of concerts now?
there is never deep enough with these theories
inb4 Miku had actually been working with Fudou since the Zwei Wing concert
not a single one of the wielders has normal family circumstances
she's not a batgirl, but a mothgirl I see
pfffttt
but they're also super ninja
not only are they on a segway
Cos araara
paywalls?
what
Kanade is so alpha holy hell
*Can you keep up with me?*
inb4 she's the missing unknown sister
get me a non-lewd xd miku figure and i'm buying
where're the heroes that pay and spread?
tch
~~finally a good reference for once~~
she's not even a christmas cake
event though she's like what, 22? 23?
that Maria considers herself a grandma apparently
and we get nice boat next ep instead
inb4 aoi hyped us all up for nothing
who nails the suffering?!
Kaneko
VS
solopy
Next episode
is it saturday yet?
now model Chris doing her boob thing
i didnt make that if that's what you asked
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DpNaZD0dTEc
I mean Shirabe alone would probably destroy the ring
I have a feeling these two would be taking home wins constantly
if symphogear was a dancing anime

*[Kirito intensifies]*
and Tsubasa's hairclip is a reference to Susano'o
it's also super fitting cos Susano'o at one point had both this and Ame-no-Habakiri
```Kusanagi-no-Tsurugi (ËçâËñô„ÅÆÂâ£) is a legendary Japanese sword and one of three Imperial Regalia of Japan. It was originally called Ame-no-Murakumo-no-Tsurugi (Â§©Âè¢Èõ≤Ââ£, "Heavenly Sword of Gathering Clouds"), but its name was later changed to the more popular Kusanagi-no-Tsurugi ("Grass-Cutting Sword"). In folklore, the sword represents the virtue of valor.

```
it's the same one
OC donutsteel enough?
```Heavenly Sword of Gathering Clouds```
okay but what about
Ame-no-Murakumo-no-Tsurugi
then call it by its cooler name
and then wields it like a pro
I like they have an image of the Kazanari crest now
and then he loses and gets to commit seppuku like the old ways
inb4 fudou is jacked af underneath that kimono and he can kick ass even through symphogears
Fudou is a Basa problem only imo
she probably won't
i did not expect that
ow my ears
even with Miku being as unsubtle as she is, they won't
it'll *never* happen
~~kaneko reads and takes ideas from fanfictiona fter all~~
lol, I guess that's as close as I could get
yeah, that I did have
as well as theorizing about what Adam's line about being "cursed" means
Only about what being free of sin means
I did write a fanfiction, but it never included anything about Fudou being a possible god
interesting and thoughtprovoking, but it does sound like a stretch
wow zoid's theory is really wild

aoi yuuki herself said so
~~just wait for miku god song~~
twintail armor
mp3 for now
https://nyaa.si/view/1161454
>Miku free of curse
>Therefore, make curse free babies
>Have an army of divine powered children
>Take over world
>???
>JAPAN!
Who said anything about marriage
With Fudou <:Ver:336656981144109066>
generic name 9000
exceed mode lol
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newfoundland_Tricolour
has gear ever repeated transformations?
we never once had that tired boobs comparison scene
thank god
https://twitter.com/symphogear_XD/status/1154662639546638343
Oh wait its bikki nvm
Oh boy here we go!
Miku floating in nothingness
***making a fruit salad!***
Symphogear was actually about
this *ENTIRE* time
so this entire time
you know, how they use the kanji to write 'future' to mean Miku and whatnot
was one of those words written uncannily similar to someone's name
help us out here
ok joe
wow, that is some cryptic preview
the former
the alignment of tyrants and whatnot
Lawful Evil probably fits him the best
it's kinda like how gilgamesh is chaotic good somehow
nvm
oh wait, it says it's without being a zealot
I'd actually put him as Lawful Neutral
inb4
I hope Aoi didn't jebait us with the hype
so I was thinking there was some wordplay going on
I fucking lol how every episode is just two of the characters sitting in front of the TV and shaking
one of the gaijins got noise'd!
the second one kills me
BOOB MISSILES!
HOLY SHIT THAT DUETTTT
SAINT GERMAIN RETURNSSSS
The guy wasn't able to use it cos he still had the sin
If the Gears become fugitives, nobody will be there to defend her!
Oh shit!
what are they planning?!
And Miku still hasn't gotten involved
we're only on fucking ep 4!
But shit is gonna go down
I don't think Symphogear Civil War will happen here
They could surprise us, but it doesn't seem too far fetched
It seems pretty obvious right now considering what she's going through
and the others will become fugitives
I get the feeling Basa will side with Fudou
Isn't that the size of the Earth?!?
that is GIGANTIC
380k KM
the duet was so fucking good
Fucking Fudou taking over!
~~not even close~~
ewwwww
ew
they were too busy listening
The duet was too lit
I mean they love doing that anyway
seems legit
why didn't everyone else do something
although she's the only one who did any fighting
Sant seiya bikki
cos we got a cool new saint seiya form along with hanasaku yuuki duet
It was a pretty standard shonen powerup, but it was still super awesome
for such a menacing thing, Daedalus End was kinda puny
THAT'S STILL REALLY BIG
amongst other many many characters
an interesting theme to give her henshin I must say
a studio version of the duet will be too good
the other two alchemists don't seem important enough tbh
||https://twitter.com/golden_nabe/status/1137235322973040640||
Xv final battle spoiler:
yeah, they're making every ep a cliffhanger
god, more excruciating wait
how will they get out of this
seriously
what the heck is song gonna do now
What do you call those jumps that Maria did in her henshin?
could be a one scene wonder
I dunno how permanent it'll be
tfw even ora ora came from HnK first
Basa will probably then betray Fudou before the climax or during the climax
So many callbacks
And then turns on them
"My apologies Tachibana, but our karaoke night is no longer possible."
Basa will be like
bottomless pit of a stomach
this labyrinth alone would be like 50 episodes alone in a bigger battle shonen
and such a big one too
yeah, why make a labyrinth when you just use it to explode
starts singing then BOOM
i loled at how Hibiki's song got interrupted
and some hokuto no ken
she's been watching saint seiya
nah, she hasn't
the duet will definitely be released with the rest of the season's songs
more of the same
I dunno, dropped it after one ep cos it looked very boring
pffftt
God, I remember there being an anime I saw once with a character having another character's spirit as a guide
BUT WHAT DOES IT MEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAN
fucking batarang
nah, Miku ain't thicc
of course
of all things lol
not even a good meme
ew
very hype
it was quite nicely done
even Rambo wouldn't risk his own allies though
maybe
they're probably gonna become fugitives
he was calm, but I think the guns were turned on him too
or maybe they changed their minecraft cubes in the middle
and it's just an illusion of pespective
and the pyramid isn't smooth on the sides like we thought
Maybe they're just rectangles
Birdy the Mighty let's go!
must go as obscure as possible
Guyver!
!
***Space Pirate Captain Harlock!***
I've always wanted to play but it wasn't meant to be
I've seen it before when I looked through some mecha attacks
yeah, I saw that at some point
Inzauma Kick kthx
we need ***more***
just drop in a gunbuster one
what else should he put
I wouldn't put it past Kaneko to put some more obscure references
Cutie Honey
now that's a name I haven't heard in a while
flabby boob missiles <:Cag:423197445644615711>
lol wtf
both now and in AXZ
I mean, they made it look like he answers to him
and there's records of Miku in the database
Since Gen answers to him
he probably knows Miku
take over SONG first
he doesn't deserve to be held at gunpoint
the guy is so normal
poor Fujitaka
although they did a whole lot of nothing with them in this fight
toku armor
https://twitter.com/DootMoon/status/1155291389338509312
as much as it was nice, Berserk mode was kinda...plain? for a lack of a better word
But this was a great alternative
I just expected a suffering episode instead
Oh, no at all
It wasnt the hype I was expecting, but hype nonetheless
They'd be wasting time like in AXZ
That'd be a bad move
It just wouldnt make sense for the others
I dont really want Cags and Prelati to show up
Ep 5 spoilers
https://i.4cdn.org/a/1564302474552.jpg
I give them 1 or 2 episode for the Miku plot point to start
Some nerd thought it was real and edited it in to wikipedia
It was made by Fire Emblem
It literally doesnt exist
Ichaival isnt even a real relic
Ullr if we go by Fire Emblem lore
Give me Susano'o <:TsubasaSmug:585839805737467920>
Yes
https://twitter.com/dododorigesu/status/1131891503318556673
Xv ending leaked
Considering an obvious main antagonist is still missing, it could be anyone at this point
Our savior Noise-kun
Hibiki's fist has a heart in the middle lol
https://symphogear-fanon.fandom.com/wiki/Symphogear_Fanon_Wiki
proceed at your own risk
the answer may surprise you
now what is Tsubasa doing in a winnie the pooh wiki you may ask
with *all* of the fanon weirdness you could ask for
symphogear also has a fanon wiki, btw
at the bottom in trivia
and kept the dumb edit
however before that, some...really...weird...winnie the pooh wiki copied the whole article
which was later removed
Someone made a mind-numbingly dumb edit on the symphogear wiki
*Basically*
Celestial Mudguards!
oh!
the what term?!
Only Susano'o, since he was the one who used Ame-no-Habakiri
Zoid's blog did some nice research into it
Since Indian mythology is crazy like that
Just take something from India and instill on one of the girls with the powers of DBZ
Either sons of a god or a pair of blades
One of two things, depending on which source you read it from
Ichaival isn't even a norse name
Neither Odin nor Ullr ever had a named bow
And thats what Kaneko saw and took
actually, that's the first time I see anyone making the Yuyuyu comparison
I don't know what this Izayoi is, but it sounds like a Goten
never trust fanon wikis
**When you stare into the abyss, the abyss stares back at you.**
and then somehow they one up themselves
You keep on thinking you've seen everything
and by sometimes I mean all the time
you come across cursed things
just sometimes...
sometimes...
when you're in the fanfiction scene like I am
tfw I had a dream last night about Miku literally turning into Fine
and always go for the friendship route with them
I think it's a shame they just can't go with an actual antagonistic female
for something so menacing
their attack was kinda...puny
I was sure they were gonna have to fight the minotaur or something
I recall the weapons there showing up in astral form at times
First thing that came to mind to me was actually Soul Eater
<:TsubasaDisgust:349013662775902209>
the live is pretty much why they had that duet at all lol
but it seems to be what they're going for
I don't want them to rehash G's plot
*you know you love it*
**Her friendship with Hibiki are planted memories after the concert!**
**Miku has been in leagues with him from the very beginning!**
he probably needed to know why ultramanbikki happened too
nothing a good dose of threatening everyone they love can't solve
Uses its power to turn them into humans
inb4 Hibiki uses the bracelet exactly for that
anime proportions
her legs are probably made of steel
she did track and field
GX ep uhhh...5? or 6?
perfect
<@!263983345669505025> there's another good one from STC if you can find it
or at least just the wielders
that seems pretty significant
the guy she killed burned up in green fire
Hibiki just needs to learn Hokuto Shinken and she'll be fine
Making Hibiki go ~~super saiyan~~ Amalgam 2
Fudou with the brace will crush her head
!
Im actually liking Vanessa a lot
get us the whole thing!
YOU WA SHOCK!
Take back the love!
anime companies cater to the masses, not the fringe
you show them with a six pack and people would go <:HibikiShock:336656371611074580>
anime proportions
yeah but you know
TOO BIG
so all Gungnir fragments now have Kanade inside them
Inb4 we learn her spirit somehow fused with Gungnir's existence

>pick side with Fudou option
>get eaten by gremlins on day 15
so we'll get a somber version and a triumphant version
San German is Hibiki's Zanpakuto now
and yet it still wasn't as lewd as Kirika's
from rhythmic gymnastics to bondage wew
have absolutely everything *except* the explicit parts
they could just go the nanoha way
there's a yugioh one too
kerrik
at least so far, their cleverness isn't just due to SONG being insanely dumb like in G
and the best thing about it?
amazing what an increase in budget can do <:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
I fucking died
they need to start that arc soon
yeah, Miku is yet to be involved
Prelati was one of the people who *helped* Gilles de Rais
I dig it so hard
the duet blew me up
we definitely had weaker
of the whole show? that's an exaggeration, imo
That is one way to refer to him hahahahaha
Ppfffftttttt
This was light in comparison
Fairly standard shonen asspull honestly
And bringing her back as a power boost was just a nod to the live anyway
So they have to choose what falls flat
Chris doesnt require anymore development
They still have the Miku thing to deal with dont forget
Now she has 4 hands to hold hands with
you have been doing so well until now
don't do this xv
plz no axz formula
plz no
Adam's hat was destroyed iirc
didn't do anything until the very end
he was too useless most of the time
I mean, I guess there are worse motivations in life
SG is awesome
although it looks like hibiki's b-side *might* finally give us something
both waikyou and eiai promise feature it heavily
alas, we already know it won't happen
and the girls can then have a normal life
I'll definitely be okay with an ending in which all of the Symphogears are destroyed
The only thing I see happening is her using the bracelet
SSJ is not coming back, that we already know very well
with people who are weapons and people who use those weapons
and then we can finally be like Soul Eater
becomes a sword instead
Tsubasa tries to bring back Kanade
gold transmutation is easier to remember
on the other, the comment section becomes a shithole
on one hand, more people that might check it out
they deliberately upload the clips with these sort of titles to drag the various fandoms in
crunchy was a mistake
yeah that
oh that
work till you die
yep, japanese work environment
Ayahi and Iguchi I believe
made next to no comments and just smiled weakly
in one of FGO's streams she was half dead
she has a shitload of work all the time probably
seriously?
wait what
you just finished watching?
the fool's stone is literally a scab that fell from her
did any keyword state it?
i dont think so?
through tricking Eve into eating the apple
gave humanity knowledge and critical thinking
in a way, you could say that
Well, the snake also technically helped Eve
PERHAPS VER WAS A REPRESENTATION OF THE SNAKE
WOW THE ADAM AND EVE CONNECTION IS ACTUALLY REALLY COOL
I'd skip the CR subs, but I can't wait even a day
Petition for ymtm to get the license for XV
Crunchy was a mistake
The best part is at the start
Like, seriously
They djdnt even put the whole thing
They have 0 chemistry with them
Not only will it be a rehash of axz again
Thatd be really stupid
Please dont have the other alchemists too

Tomorrow we say tomorrow!
just telling off Fudou towards the end
i dont think she did
I think ignite just artificially caused it
It's a built in function Symphogears have
how does that even work?!?!
moustache checks out
new commander guy probably gonna be an ass
yeah but Carol was just generally a villain, and didn't incite a personal grudge from one of the characters
I think they forgot she was supposed to be angry
Tsubasa should've gone ballistic upon seeing Carmilla
it'd be boring if it just rehashed what axz did
the small cour size doesn't allow for much unfortunately
Fudou is so evil, he gives one star reviews to all of Tsubasa's albums!
!
Fudou is so evil, he leaves one star reviews on restaurants he hasn't even been to
Fudou is so evil, he asks for the manager in every store
Christmas Fudou
Oh god
Fudou is so evil, he says "gg ez" after every online match
Fudou is so evil, he doesn't salt the pasta
Fudou is so evil, he takes up two parking spaces
Fudou is so evil, he jaywalks across every street he sees
he just takes the doorbell
he doesn't even run
Fudou is so evil, he never puts a new roll of toilet paper
Fudou is so evil, he never tips the pizza guy
Fudou is so evil, when he donates to streams he makes the announcement really noisy and loud to bother everyone
Fudou is so evil, he places drawers in corners so his subordinates stub their toes on the edge
Fudou is so evil, he spoils the ending of movies to his subordinates
nah, he probably thinks Pokemon is some american conspiracy to stupidify japan's people or something
Gets up, brushes his teeth, heads outside, and kicks a puppy
Kazanari Fudou starts his morning like every regular man
Remember when Basa was happy?
Yeah, me neither
He's got all the makings of one
The scary thing is, he'd probably be an insanely capable leader in the sengoku period
I mean, he basically did it just to yell at Basa
I can totally see him saying that afterwards
oh
Fudou is so evil, he hired the Illuminati to kill 70k peop‚Äî
>people telling bikki "cool story bro"
even though we know Touma will pick her in the end cos harem protagonists always pick worst girl
yeah but Index didn't do that out of love for the MC
i prefer Miku over Index ngl
Kaban no Kakushigoto
is this gonna be the ultimate buttclench episode?
wew
and with that episode name
the crazy thing is that he's over a hundred years old apparently
feudal era values
ah, lack of communication. classic symphogear
Akira is just a weak man with a weak spirit
between Fudou and Akira, it's Fudou who's the real asshole
that counts for something?
well, he dusted it at least
He gave her some encouraging words in GX as well
He kept her room clean the entire time she wasn't at home, and he deliberately chased her away from the house to keep her from getting tangled up in the family matters. He wanted her to chase her own dream without any worries.
He's a bit distant, but he still cares for Tsubasa in his own way
leagues above Fudou and Akira anyway
he's alright
just not be here for 2 hours is easy
but that's alright
me too
2 hours!
Straight how
that'd be $1.99
thank you
Just according to SAKIMORI. (TL Note: SAKIMORI means plan)
probably when a bunch of kami were rolling around
Imma assume he's talking about some mythological era
he's all about restoring japan's imperial/divine glory
it's obvious Miku isn't dead
it felt like the tone was jumping all over the place
I have mixed feelings on this episode
hmmmm
I get the feeling we won't actually see her donning the bracelet, but rather she'll pop out with it already on just like in G
that was so weird lol
Also, it seems we now sorta know what the stained glass thing does
well now is your proof
If you didn't think Tsubasa was Japanese enough
I sincerely hope they get started on the Miku arc next ep cos time is running short
yeah, that's not staying for long
a bit of a breather ep
I was like "wtf Carol?!"
seriously
she looks like Carol in these shots
HENSHIN RANKING TIME!
so fellas!
that sure was a huge fountain too
*I am the bone of my sword*
not necessarily. I was reminded of him too, but a storm of blades isn't something Bleach invented
her henshin was fucking awesome
he should be a rotting corpse right about now
She was stressed the entire time after all
Fudou was too nice this episode
what's with Carolnein and referencing old songs
do they really think they could arrest them that easily
the wielders are basically impervious to bullets and tank shells and conventional weaponry
i do wonder
the scarf of course
I can see that
It'd possible it's like this because of what happened with kyoani
I honestly agree
hmmm...
shock factor this time was pretty weak
kind of sad song got control back so easily
why so vanilla now
she could've at least accidentally killed one civilian
I think that's just an expression
Is this episode the first time Fudou's name was said out loud?
give it a bit
yeah, nobody does
Miku
how the heck are they going to involve her in the plot there
if they can just get that right I'll be satisfied
like those guards he had Carmilla kill
he definitely looks like the sort of person who'd toss away pawns the moment their usefulness was up
I did like the suffering, but the lack of human collateral kinda deflated it
Used to keep elf9 in line
Miku will be held hostage again
Oh, I see now
I'm just praying to all that is holy that Miku's relevance will be even halfway decently done
cos she told him off towards the end of AXZ
it's a little weird tho tbh
Kyogre Noise
oh yeah
are the water guns Miku has the exact same ones Chris has in her swimsuit form in xdu?
it sorta came out of nowhere
it doesn't really leave you guessing so much as pretty much tells you
it's weak because it's obvious the victim isn't Miku
kaneko is at fault for everything

Fudou asshole counter: +1
imagine numbering your children instead of giving them actual names
who's the guy
no I mean
anyone here?
he was getting off on the prospect of miku dying lol
ala the Truman Show
With Hibiki serving as the unwitting protagonist
Symphogear was a series directed by Genjuro this entire time
her bust gets smaller the more her voice deepens
"smaller than yours"
it's size is
well her chest is also relative
in the same way Gamagoori's height is "taller than you"
"sexier than you"
The exact value is
it is relative
Tsubasa's sexiness is not an exact number
saturday when
Hbki: "lass go pahrti!"
subada: "laifu iz pein."
fascinating...
His time as The Razor...
at least they didn't make a pointless reference in the title
Im a bit confused now as to how they'd go about this
https://twitter.com/M_hisashi/status/1158007047666802688
anime tends to do that often
SONGS FOR THE SONG GOD
WITH GUTS AND GLORY
~~like 86.~~
go read 86. it's actually good and not wish fulfilment ~~and a personal friend translated it~~
it does feel like they're a genre
but looking at the direction light novels are going now
see kerrik, I'd usually agree
~~every mecha is just a mazinger reference~~
surely recording technology was very good
it's 2045
i'm shocked no one has yet
oh geez
10 gb
gib
you do?!?
lol, Aoi always cries in lives
apparently Aoi Shouta played Princess Kaguya in a musical
that was the first time I ever came across it
i've never heard a man voiced a woman before
normally you don't see that sort of thing
"how"
only when I looked it up I was like "what"
the first time, I literally couldn't tell
thighs too thicc
tsubasa and maria are the only ones with boots
Until at least that also burned down but hey, semantics!
The other half was perfectly livable!
To be fair, it was only half
Did someone say burning down cities?
~~or it's just my edgeboner speaking~~
I can see it

<@87512939107450880> now that you've reached that part, here's a bad edit. ~~XV future spoilers~~
XV ending spoiler
give me a good non-garage kit miku x drive and im buying right away
Vanessa is reduced to just a head, gives Bikki a short pep talk, Fudou crushes the head, Bikki goes super ~~saiyan~~ amalgam 2
I couldn't help imagine a dbz like scene
there are wild arm references in a work made by the guy who made wild arms!
i'm shook
wow! how surprising!
but that's *boooooring*
they tried to combine SSJ design with Gungnir and what came out was...really weird
that is such a weird design
crunchy finally got Hibiki's name right!
that's all they need
just enough
there is *just* enough room available for people to ignore the yuri tease
they explicitly made enough room for doubt, as minuscule as it is
a NanoFate type of ending for them is the most we can hope for
in a series like Symphogear that has a main cast of fairly archetypical anime girls, having them be explicitly attracted to each other would hurt business
because Kaneko and co need to make money off of waifuers
even the flaws can feel artificial at times
I'd never date a person who acts like an anime character in real life
that's all that really matters
it makes money
they made guns, ships, soda cans, and food into waifus
pretty much
I recall the incident where this one seiyuu or idol shaved her head and apologized profusely for betraying her fans after sleeping with someone
<@!263983345669505025> of course there are fans like that. they don't even have to be male. this is more of a phenomenon in the jp fandoms however. they have this weird obsession with purity that shows itself even in other things like idols and seiyuus
This is what I expected Kirika's voice to sound like in a few years
the new kiri song
See? Told you Tsubasa went training in Soul Society
https://twitter.com/golden_nabe/status/1158296632787492870
you could make a new bachelor degree simply out of nasuverse lore
as a fan of the Fate franchise, I can understand how frustrating it is to chase after lore
tbf, symphogear has a heavy focus on the songs, so it's a given a lot is given through them
because she was like half the height of everyone else
in the fgo stream she sat on a high chair
Aoi the midget
and el melloi case files
she's in many other things in this anime season
although because Kirika's voice is all cutesy like, this gives a weird disconnect lol
yeah, it's really good!
when does the ep usually air again?
someone translate 26:38 to actual time for me kthx

remember the eternal:
i-is that bad? <:ShirabeConcern:586404485598019604>
yeah i do
Fine did nothing wrong
because you start getting the pronounciation on your own
by the time you're an adult, you actually forget how to use this system lol
because it depends on both context and meaning
in fact, hebrew has an entire system that you learn from early on to teach you how to pronounce words correctly
can confirm it's not really pronounced the same way it's written
Hebrew speaker here

this teaser
from the moment we got the teaser for xv
ah yes, it has been discussed
best case scenario we get a nanoha ending
gib
do we still have a bingo sheet for xv?
the funniest one i've seen is for the word cojer
down to the meaning of whole words
the biggest differences in spanish I've seen is between latin american spanish and spain spanish
I mean, yay!
~~oh god damn it~~
I used to be the only one here for like, a year more or less
what can you even say to that
I mean, you can't really argue when even the VAs ship them
the song
It's 2000% up your alley
to put it this way Lily, without spoiling it
who got kicked like a minute later
oh man, this reminds me of that guy that came here a while ago
because it doesn't say her name directly I suppose? I dunno, they grasp at straws I can't even comprehend
like there are people who honestly believe that Eiai Promise is *not* about Hibiki
because they have the waifu/otaku market in mind
and Symphogear gives *just* enough, however minuscule
As long as there is room for doubt, people will doubt
That's why Symphogear is like this
Unfortunately, gay isn't as profitable
they are
her own personal force ghost
"Hey uh so I noticed you have like, no apps in here..."
suddenly, SG
they're getting hot and bothered and about to get to business
very awkward sexy time for Hibimiku
I wonder if anyone else can see SG ü§î
she can sleep while SG memorizes everything for her
she literally doesn't have to study
SG can just help her with the answers
does this mean Hibiki can ace tests easily now?
I am not ready for this
it can't *actually* be Miku who got killed right
no way
wait

like an ironman suit
tomorrow we say tomorrow!
yes
ow my ears
that is one magnificent beard
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenoglossy
xenoglassia?
she's just going to spend the rest of the season half dead in the med bay
rather than her being on the enemy side or something
now I'm beginning to think tho we *might* get a cop out with the whole Miku thing
especially how everyone save for Ver got the idiot ball so everything fell into place for him extremely conveniently
I also have massive problems with how G was conveyed
lol yeah
Kirika: "I want to leave something behind to remember me by!"
>forgetting that dropping the moon on the world will literally kill everyone and there won't be anyone left to remember her
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zQ74o3iBKk
so it seems they really will break away from each other
what sort of foreshadowing
"How Japanese is she?"
"Yes"
YAAAAHAYAAAAAA
and somehow had doubts as to how japanese tsubasa is
for anyone who missed
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jTYTErQFcNA
about time
>Fujitaka
some screens showed 2012 and all that
well, it's cos in past seasons it wasn't consistent
oh so symphogear officially takes place in 2045?
that's one hell of a theory
the shinji pic is the shaky one
wonder what's in the suitcase ü§î

3 hours
not yet kerrik
he's getting a visit from basa soon probably
and we don't know the size of the thing
now it's not 2 episodes from the end
well, the major differences this time is that
not sure what to feel
I'm kinda
considering what happened last time
yeah but what will the end result be
He's more or less pushing her to that conclusion
ALL OVER
MECHA REFERENCES
GUNBUSTER REFERENCES
it looks like shit is gonna go down
let's get through this season first
that was creepy as hell
she started getting mind controlled or whatever
until you know
I just really hope it's not godzilla like the old one
maybe it's human sized
aren't lulu amel just humans?
it's weird
we could be looking at a possession
if it'll be Miku at all
god, that'll be crazy if it does
Fudou, SONG, and God Miku?
so we'll have three factions now?
~~seigi no mikata where~~
~~and then we discover it's cursed and burns a chunk of the city down~~
Noble Red might cut their losses and team up with SONG
Like if we just go by what happened this ep
I guess we kinda can?
how the fuck did he do that lol
ninja's the car
But then he just
"Hey Ogawa, just ditch the car and run with the thing!"
I thought like
but not why
everyone can see something's up with basa
there's a keyword for it but untranslated <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
god, please do
will they give us an Inazuma Kick at some point?
channel that Noriko
and if she shouted it louder
The collider one would've been cooler if it was bigger and actually did some damage to something
With 2000 mecha references?
So Melua, is this the best XV episode now?
while for everyone else it's just weird noise
it's possible that Maria is the only one hearing something significant
fucking finally
they should've just made the light coming off the cocoon look like a cross to cement an evangelion reference too while they're at it
mecha references: the episode
fucking gunbuster
<:HibikiBlep:605209109284782090>
It of course has to start with her stabbing one of the wielders in the back literally
Tsubasa needs to wreck everyone at the same time for some extra spice on top
But I'd say the latter
hmmm...both are quite tasty indeed
the "coincidence" took me by surprise
found it completely by accident
literally pulled this out of my ass right now
never
>7 gear wielders
we cracked the code
>ed has 7 lights
>Sebitti = seven war gods
>embodiment of the *scorpio* constellation
Ishara
in any case
kaneko *can* do his homework
so yeah, they really used it correctly even without saying what it does
ancient greek uh...computer? used to analyze astronomical positions
for once he didn't invent a function for a relic
```Her astrological embodiment is the constellation Scorpio and she is called the mother of the Sebitti (the Seven Stars) (Seux, 343). Ishara was well known in Syria from the third millennium B.C. She became a great goddess of the Hurrian population. She was worshipped with Teshub and Simegi at Alakh, and also at Ugarit, Emar and Chagar Bazar. While she was considered to belong to the entourage of Ishtar, she was invoked to heal the sick (Lebrun).[7]```
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ishara
ü§î
and returned when AXZ was kinda like, half aired at the time
then well, put it down
hmmmm...I think I started when GX was nearing completion?
yep
<@!99695384296701952> https://twitter.com/golden_nabe/status/1160457831465623552
thank you for your contribution
ah yes
All I did was just write them
I doubt I'm the only person to come to these conclusions
<@506219877724454929> KANEKO READS FANFICTION
But in all seriousness though, it's just a coincidence. Considering how they're built up XV so far, and the hints they dropped at the end of AXZ, you could more or less tell how things will go. Maybe not in the exact manner, but it's fairly predictable if you just think about it
although her eyes seem to be augmented
we say powerlevels are bullshit, but nothing is as bullshit as the stuff that happens in comics
i'm kinda iffy on the details
if that's how deadpool works
i can see him just cutting off his own head before that happens, tossing it aside, and then regrowing his body slowly
would deadpool die if he touches a Noise? ü§î
Tsubasa's visit to Fudou in the coming eps might be what seals the deal
It's a fairly predictable outcome, considering what's happening right now
they just give it a different name and another set of rules
but of course, magic is a very broad term for supernatural abilities
the alchemy we see here might as well be magic
It's about as real as everything else in Symphogear, I assume
I'm glad you like it! Well, we'll need to see where XV takes us first. I don't promise anything though, as longfics are a challenge to write
but considering what we saw in Ep 1, it might be Enki
yeah, there's a lot we don't know yet about Fine's circumstances
well, the entire reason the curse of balal exists in the first place is because the gods/custodians/whatever perceived the building of the tower of babel as rebellion
you don't have to tag me in every post btw
huh, that's neat!
what's Vk?

miku will now be possessed by godserena
serena is the custodian miku saw
hottake
I mean, you have brinsingamen and aegis in XDU, but that's a spinoff game and can't be taken as canon
I mean, they could be. Enki was the guy in the first episode, and he was pretty human looking...although that doesn't automatically mean he's a custodian
like tsubasa got
probably mental shock
it's not the light
nah nah nah maxwell, it formed along with it
we got our sunshine spawn
well fellas
I'm starting to think this isn't a cocoon at all, and it's actually connected to Miku atm
this thing has a thin line at the bottom of it
I just noticed something though
but it could also be Fudou
it could be Miku
honestly, it's hard to tell, as we don't have even a clue as to who could be the main antagonist
we don't know who the vambrace belongs to or what it actually does
also doesn't seem to be what they're going for
I doubt it
Anything could appear really, but it doesn't really look like the direction they're taking it
<@506219877724454929> nah, I don't think he will be. I don't think that's what they're setting up for
I have surmised this through the power of supreme bullshit
IT ALL MAKES SENSE NOW
embodiment of scorpio constellation = miku's astrological sign is scorpio
sebitti the seven stars = 7 stars in the ed and cover art =  7 minor war gods = 7 gear wielders
word for treaty, binding promise = eiai promise
bless the couple on the honeymoon = marriage
it's all connected man!
HIBIMIKU MARRIAGE ENDING CONFIRMED
``` Her main epithet was belet rame, lady of love, which was also applied to Ishtar. In the Epic of Gilgamesh (Tablet II, col. v.28) it says: 'For Ishara the bed is made' and in Atra-hasis (I 301-304) she is called upon to bless the couple on the honeymoon."```
```Ishara is the Hittite word for "treaty, binding promise", also personified as a goddess of the oath.```
```Her astrological embodiment is the constellation Scorpio and she is called the mother of the Sebitti (the Seven Stars) (Seux, 343). Ishara was well known in Syria from the third millennium B.C. She became a great goddess of the Hurrian population.```
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ishara
look at this look
Oh right cypher, you didnt see my crazy conspiracy theory
doubt it
so...
well, the final result kinda looks like a baby
umbilical cord much? ü§î
image as it's forming
what would it be without them?
thing is that Symphogear is basically kept afloat by its cast
nobody can take Kanade's place in Tsubasa's heart
I didn't even notice
You did?
<:HibikiWhat:336656482907193344>
even the spirit saint germain looks to be a one off thing
I think like every country has their own version of those
https://twitter.com/dododorigesu/status/1131891503318556673
You must break a sword before it can be reforged
Thats all
Just another little enthusiastic Tsubasa fan
Just one would be enough
Couldve killed at least one person though
but I see it playing as an ending theme for that very episode instead
I want to believe it'll be during a very heartfelt battle that'll leave us crying
there is literally 0 reason why anyone else would sing it
it's hibiki dedicating a song to miku
yeah, that's kimi dake ni
why would anyone other than her sing it?
what? kimi dake ni?
Symphogear 400
Symphogear 410
Symphogear 2510
Symphogear 15
Thatd be op
Considering she was using them to..."contain" it or something
Maybe the pieces she was putting around the vambrace were fragments of ssj
I dont think SSJ as a gear will return, but it's definitely somewhat relevant again
*[LAUGHS IN SAKIMORI]*
This is the meme police üöì 
Hand over all your memes for preliminary inspection!
It can lead to interesting discoveries
It's fun
I dont think there's anything I *haven't* speculated about lol
nah, it's fanart
why is this not canon

Too abstract for our peasant minds
why are you asking me? I don't read japanese
so that's another one to the collection, let's see where i'll put it

we see their grandchildren
it'll be a 100 year montage

<@!99695384296701952> what thinks you of this?
Loki wtf
```Second, the gods were to make Skadi laugh. After many feats were tried, none succeeded in bringing a smile to the grim face of the giantess. At last, Loki tied one end of a rope to a goat and the other end around his testicles and began a game of tug of war with the goat. Each screeched and howled in turn, until at last Loki fell over into Skadi‚Äôs lap. The giantess couldn‚Äôt help but chuckle.```
and in the Norse corner, you got Loki being turned into a mare and giving birth to an eight legged horse
because Greek Mythology is so much better lol
4 arms is probably way older than that
So which would you say are the dar reaching ones?
Oh lol
Most of the Kirika ones I'd say + the eva one is very far reaching

Sure, Toei believes that for some reason KR has no fanbase in the west, but maybe in Japan they were well regarded
weren't the Kamen Rider Musou games like fairly well recieved
but knowing satelight, it might end up being just a compilation movie
I can see a movie happening after the series though
The closest I've ever come to Symphogear Musou was to make Symphogear characters in Samurai Warriors Empires. That was fun, but not the real experience.
I want to rack up Noise kills with Basa
preferably Musou

btw, we have this now. Ripped from XDU, but it's spoiler enough to come in here I think
the first two seem somewhat recappy
they're telling us nothing
these are so vague
WHAT THIS

topdad being more topdaddy than usual and eyeing tomosato lel
https://twitter.com/symphogear_XD/status/1162272787135733761
eh, they'd have figured it out eventually

guess what
hey fellas

inb4 secret album
Hanasaku Yuuki amalgam was a surprise, but that's a rerecord
Cos we know about the character songs + B sides
I wonder what they mean by songs that haven't appeared yet
<@139432096023183360> explain
share in <#357682999300718592>
Something as generic as gods with a lot of power is commonplace
I think you're drawing too many parallels to other things
manga was top notch
good memories
oh wow, rosario vampire

no
at least she can help said idiot in tests and all
If you were stuck in the mind of an idiot for the rest of your existence, you'd want something to do
Look, SG has no body. She has to entertain herself somehow.
Hibiki has minecraft installed too
"Hey so uh, you got like no apps in here."
and SG is like
Hibiki and Miku are in the middle of stuff
fits more with Hibiki and SG now
although then we got rebellion and then they screamed
I mean madoka's ending didn't stop the madohomu fans
a madoka ending will also be disappointing
tsubamari is kind of a stretch even for symphogear
tsubasa and maria didn't really have any chemistry until now so... ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
wouldn't that be a doozy
sing me the fuck up!
symphogear song in a wedding?!
I guess that technicality still counts?
I mean
I don't remember a damn thing from Terraformars
wow
the attack
apparently it was in AXZ
now we must find out which attack Hibiki did that came from there
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mazinger_Edition_Z:_The_Impact!
this mazinger specifically
so that one
yeah kenji was the mc there
probably mazinger?
kenji is a mood
he was even in sao
he was in some mazinger show, and bakugan, and even magi
Kenji isn't that much of a newbie though
seriously?!
eh
Tomosato is a very fine woman
to be fair
Or you help your uncle jack off a horse
You either help your Uncle Jack off a horse
so is capitalization!
also evangelion reference
inb4 gear is really bamboozling us
https://twitter.com/Rice_KOBAYASHI/status/1162712054865641472
maybe
here is not the place to discuss it
before you continue Dino, I recommend you take your personal ideas to <#357682999300718592>
HOLY CRAPPPPPP
CAROL!!!!1
DJKFKASJDFKLJAS
DFGASDFADSFASDFASDF
FDHSAKDFHAKSFJASF
Also, we now know that Carmilla's ability is straight up mind control
I didn't even notice that
oh shit, you're right
what a glorious episode
wait what
Yes
what a crazy comeback
I literally can't
Also, I fucking knew that thing looked like a baby!
I literally can't
HOLY POTATOES ON A FUCK
HOLY FUCK
HOLY CRAPPPPP
lol, this episode really was
guess it's still around
I was sure the harp was destroyed in GX
I can't even with all these cliffhangers
they went down heroes
At least they tried
https://twitter.com/golden_nabe/status/1162762419501850625
Tsubasa and Fudou is two in one, so at least there's that
They did confirm a bunch of things we already assumed, so at least we have that going for us
the callback to her line in ep 1 is way too obvious
Miku *is* going to be an antagonist in some form, I assume
Adding in Carol is great, but they didn't address any of the open plotlines
I have no idea where they'll go with this now
Oh, she's still Elfnein height too lol
https://twitter.com/golden_nabe/status/1162756487346679815
Nabe is exploding btw
just taking over for a second
Nah, I bet she's like Yami Yugi
no?
Time for Carol to deck these scrubs!
"And this is why you backup your data"
tfw Carmilla's ability literally deletes character development
This was hands down one of the better episodes
Yeah, some help would be handy
please Chris you're supposed to be the smart one
just draw another gun and hit her
why did she fire anyway lol
she's not showing a lot of versatility
yeah, she should maybe start using her other weapons too
lol
everyone here saw the ep
you don't need to spoilertag
it's so mean
I'll wait till the end to decide
He is losing his shit lol
and Atem shows himself and pissed off more than ever
You mess with Yugi
yeah lol
but that was in the middle of a fight
Hibiki did
Mental regression, mind control, mind destruction
What can't it do to someone's mind
Carmilla's ability is scary as hell though
they said it this episode
to use the Chateau's energy
iirc the burning memories part was Carol's choice and not a prerequisite of using the harp
the more ridiculously powerful you are
The smaller you are
As it goes in anime
TINY
We got a quite exquisite Hibimiku moment here
https://twitter.com/golden_nabe/status/1162653036482715648
same energy

and that can be a lot of things
Maybe the definition wasn't "sword" but just "weapon"
I KNOW RIGHT
I can't believe Frieza was Ver all along
1. Frieza
2. Sunshine spawn
3. Ver reborn
it's one of three things:
I can't believe Symphogear was just Frieza's origin story all along
I swear you can make a compilation of their mistakes and get something hilarious


also, today on "Crunchy makes us lol"
It'd be easier
Chris should just learn how to do that

combine them and you get
in fact, it's even more fun thinking hard about it!
nobody is going to stop me from thinking hard
at this point, it feels like Maria is the god descendent here
but they're not divine themselves
they can take in divine power
they're not so much divine as just free from the curse of balal
I have no idea where they'll take this
at this point, we can't predict anything
hey, at least it's going in some direction
Her character development is being deleted
garie is actually pretty cute
huh
the miracle killer is now the miracle
How ironic
it's pinned üìå
it's not even a question now
Miku is going to be an antagonist
CYPHER
TINY

Symphogear was just Frieza's origin story all along

https://puu.sh/E6nqQ.jpg
FRIEZAAAA
that's even worse
she's mentally regressing
she didn't get over it
well, they were weaker than usual
it might be as old as anime itself
usually given for moe points
it's ridiculously common in anime
it's a verbal tic
it's just dess

fear it
once again, genocide in small package
considering it was on screen when Vanessa was looking at it
those *might* be ssj shards
it might be linked to the rocks put around the vambrace
today, bikki was the jobber
you ready harem? this is how carol comes to xdu
SYMPHOGEAR YUGIOH CROSSOVER WITH ELFNEIN AS THE PROTAG LET'S GO
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-I77so2-pto
same energy
<@!102691114762371072> DBZ villain with the same color scheme as this god fetus thing we got this ep
we haven't even gotten to the real deal
the frieza fetus thing is literally just excess energy
do it
that works too
what? YGO Carolnein?
if she had a **MECHANICAL ARM LIKE SHE SHOULD'VE** then it'd have worked
Serena has folklore creatures
Miku has chinese/lyrics from her songs
Kanade has astronomy/astrology
Maria just has crosses in every attack
Hibiki has nothing unless you count XDU in which case it's just "Hibiki Style:" everything
Tsubasa is just aggressively japanese
Chris has rock/metal bands
Kirika has fairy tales
gamma and lambda and all
i dont recall everything she has
She has things like Omega and Delta and whatnot
Arithmetic, I think?
isn't irony fun
oh carol
and then she became the miracle
the season will gain nothing by bringing him back
he's just meme man now
he had his cameo appearances already
dont make ver return
Vanessa is a giant pile of mecha references herself
well
fucking lol
frieza fetus
it's a weird fetus
it's not even a spider
but Akira didn't do anything
I'm down to that
We can be Soul Eater if we want
She's Yami Yugi now
no, Carol is Elfnein's other half
inazuma as in gunbuster
we got the glorious inazuma kick this ep
it's a close enough reason
The exact reason why Symphogear isn't full on yuri is because they want to cater to the otaku fanbase
but that doesn't make money unfortunately
What a wonderful world it would be if that was a universal thought
VN writers in the mid 2000s added porn to their games just for the sake of drawing in people on the promise of porn
because it attracts audience
but they will
Of course they don't have to
if we can even call it a gear
s-shirabe?!
it'll lead us exactly nowhere
let's not get into this discussion now please
oh, Leiur is breakdancing
I know Phara is salsa
I forgot what dances they embody
her style is uhhh...freestyle?
oh, you mean Micha
Elsa
wow, it's like tarot isn't a popular concept to use in anime!
congratulations
what tarot card was elf9 referencing again?
but that'd be boring
Just grab her and leave, probably
I don't see any reason for her to do so
nah, I don't think she'll try and kill her
they just haven't done anything witth her
that's why noble red took her in the first place
100%
she was
not supposedly
This ep not only gave a callback to that scene, it also foreshadowed even harder
*[Heaven's Feel intensifies]*
according to some source I don't recall so don't take my word for it, but love and hate originate from the same part of the brain
what more could we ask for
<@106866895076003840> Carol and more Hibimiku fuel
sharing them, as you will
maybe she just siphoned some memories from elf9
dino, please chill with the jojo
Tsubasa is mentally regressing
fucking on point lol
TINY

back to XV
but I digress
when has copyright law ever really worked on the internet
it really can't. You can just find some other site to upload stuff too
what do I care about some idiotic copyright law
lol no of course not
so a combination of them
Carol uses ore
elf9 uses boku
yeah
please honor it
Thank you, but please, slow down with it. that's my personal request
Please, I don't mind talking about it, but do so in fancontent
But you're going overboard with it
I know you like it and I highly appreciate it
Please, *please*, don't bring up my fic so much in unrelated conversation
Can I make a personal request, from me to you?
Dino

**what about this eye color**
it's not so cute anymore now that the context is known
Why are you asking me? You were already advised to wait
hibiki isn't a god though
SMOL GENOCIDE
oh this time it's amazing
Muvluv flashbacks <:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
okay?
that's not fair kerrik, you can't make me feel for Garie like this <:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
et tu, cypher?
makes more sense
Elfnein is Yugi and Carol is Atem
Not alarming at all
Wonderful smile with that line
~~so hibiki can't oneshot gilgamesh now lel~~
at least it's fairly unique in that sense and not copypasted shonen tropes
shonen jump series are guaranteed to be more successful than anything else
yeah but Elf9 is different enough from Carol to be her own person
not necessarily
so this is why they postponed basa's album
https://twitter.com/jyudo_fu/status/1163004663047708672?s=19
gaijin reaction this time is on point lol
that little lick of hair falls on her face
Is when Garie shuts down
A little tiny detail I really liked
you gotta scroll up tho
it is
I fucking love this guy's reactions lol
are those on youtube?
his reaction to carol lol
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twWVGGiNM8o
better than nothing I'd say
I mean, I have to give kudos for making a comparison to something so old
pfffffttt
<:TsubasaYareYare:407397617451139073>
F for the autoscorers
have you all heard of the pokemon shipping list

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zQ74o3iBKk
ow my neck
a certain idiot rubbed off on her, perhaps
probably for convenience's sake
the ones with the mechanical voice
lol those
I turned off auto suggestions so youtube doesn't really bring those up
not that we know how strong they were originally, considering their jobs were to, well, job
but they were way weaker than usual
their personalities seemed to be intact
ppfft, Fudou wishes he was half as cool as Nobunaga
yeah, that's practically the idea here
tfw it was in the process of forming a tiny saint-germain
this needs to be used
the power of nana
did it *ever* happen to an anime original?
the part where the lick of hair falls on her face is just wonderful detail
this image will be so fitting once Carol drops in xdu
>GX
that's be generically boring
plz no
Carol is the papa here
nope
https://twitter.com/nilllirr/status/1013497966609367040
naturally, their Gear art is superior
they mostly draw Gear and Osomatsu-san, of all things
this artist is quite...whimsical, for lack of a better word
not that I've seen
https://twitter.com/nilllirr/status/691970456295854080
she knows how to downsize after all
So whatre your thoughts on Carol's return wfc?
Noodles are high in carbs
But she likes nagashi somen
DUE
IS
RENT
is it saturday yet?
there are very specific things it's useful for
you should use it less
the wiki is not a reliable source of information
and then just having a wardrobe filled with the same thing
Ver served his purpose in G and shouldn't have returned more
Akira imo was just a poorly used character overall, and his involvement in the plot of GX was implemented in a very bad manner.
he's more like a non-character now
god, where was that art
he's a lot of things, but killer isn't one of them
he himself hasn't killed a single person as far as we know
but fudou isn't a cold blooded killer
~~dammit how did you know~~
how vanilla!
```There you see her
Sitting there across the way
She don't got a lot to say
But there's something about her
And you don't know why
But you're dying to try
You wanna yeet the child```
it was replaced by "go on and yeet the child"
but at the part it says "go on and kiss the girl"
for some reason, the song "Kiss the Girl" is in my mind
and now he's literally a sword god
instead, he watched a lot of period dramas and samurai movies
i'm tempted to dig up the orca image
one of the underlying rules is that there's always something more fucked up than what you just saw
I mean it's the internet

You're welcome
kuudere
torrent/mega
only one I have

iirc she did a cover of "The sound of music"
english dub, but it's the jp va's dubbing
that'd be hilarious
oh lol
https://4kids-entertainment-fanon.fandom.com/wiki/Warriors_of_Symphogear
4kids has you covered
>english dub
just ask the Aztec‚Äîoh wait
the British and Spanish already did that
brilliant!
so SG can stand on it!
C-cos Hibiki is inside the box
I get it!
it was a cardboard box filled with tangerines
it wasn't just a normal cardboard box
And Vanessa has a usb charger
Carmilla sleeping upside down on some beam on the ceiling
Elsa sleeping in a box
"A sailor has a mistress at each port."



tomorrow we say tomorrow we say tomorrow we say tomorrow
He's just your average mad scientist
Ver is a boring villain, sorry
#notmybass
Lasting Sand lol
depending on when she was born
Genki era magical girl
more like
pffftt
Showa era magical girl
lol what
Oh no
Anakin.jpg
he needs a vacation
like he can't keep up with what's happening
You know, every ep, Gen looks more and more stressed
the shaky image is the chateau one too
y u do dis to me XV
another vague hibimiku pic
this can't be a coincidence
>xdu is rerunning mikugear event at the same time

of course

Separation of canon and headcanon is important
Neither is mine for that matter
Ok but your universe isnt canon
She'll be gone before the end of 8
Carol is a one episode wonder
Thats random af
It's all connected guys
Heavens Feel part 2 recently released as well
Coincidence? I think not!
>mikugear event is rerun in xdu
>solopy rereleases hibimiku story
>new ep has references to hibimiku ova duet
for her, they're just the top bun and the bottom bun of a burger
hibiki doesn't even know what top and bottom mean
except we got the second to last episode *now*
what did I do?
you're being a nuisance
chill
okay dino, you're really pushing it now
he got manhandled by a girl half his size
except the hero would also lick his lips at Maria
ü§¶
also, yeah, don't go on youtube during that period either
I'm an impatient bastard that can't even wait two seconds so I watch the subs as soon as they drop
oh, you don't even look at the preview images?
crunchy loves to spoil instantly
I cant
it's too much
guys icant
I cant
omg
i literally cant brathe right now
I cant
I LITERALLY CANT
I CANT
I CANT
AHHHH
FUCK
THE
WHAT
AAAAAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHH
AAAAAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHH
AAAAAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHH
AAAAHH
AND THE GURREN LAGANN REFERENCE
I CANT
ALL THE HIBIMIKU THINGS THAT SHOWED UP
THEY CONNECTED
ALL THE DOTS
AAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHH
IT'S DOING IT ON ITS OWN
I DONT NEED TO MAKE ANYTHING
ARE YOU KIDDING
is racing so fast
omg my heart
i am dead
i'm flatlining
THE SAME ENDING
*LITERALLY*
AND IT WAS LITERALLY
WATCHED HF TOO
*JUST*
AND I JUST
SSJ SHEMHA FUSION
AND IT WAS SSJ TOO
<:HibiMikuCry:586026583870013455>
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shem_HaMephorash
IS ADONAI
THE BIG BAD
NOUGAT
thanks
ok dude can you stop pinging me please?
i cant
IT HAPPENED
How did I get two endings that were exactly the same
and I just watched HF too
this is symphogear, not madoka
you know that
nobody is going to die
we also got an INSANE gurren lagann reference
he gave them the wrong blood
Fudo tricked them
a chart? you mean gaijin reaction?
they went the possession route after all
and that's clear the path for bikki
she did what she had to do
not really jobbing this time I'd say
```Solopy567.exe has stopped responding and needs to be closed. We're sorry for the inconvenience.```
and the ending was basically the same
I really think the ep hit me that much harder because I saw HF2 right beforehand
time to wait for shemha miku
well, looks like I'm not rolling in XDU anymore
it was ssj aufwachen
the aufwachen?
it incorporates a lot of designs from XDU as well
I WAS EXPECTING IT BUT IT STILL SURPRISED ME
here we discuss the fact THAT HOLY FUCK MIKUGEAR
yeah
THESE HANDS OF OURS ARE BURNING RED
the mikugear event was *probably* dropped due to this ep
she won't die
yeah him
who reacts to gear
the youtuber
nah nah
He's probably go nuts with this ep too
the one who lost his shit with Carol
I'm waiting for that one guy's reaction now
It wasn't just Maria
yeah I mean
if you say you want something to be a meme, it won't be one
no forcing memes

but we did get a gurren lagann reference
they even admit so
yeah noble red are weaksauce as hell
I can't go to sleep
wild guess, but shemha might be decide to be backseat big bad while noble red and fudo are dealt with
like, 99% match
i got exactly what I wished for
both pre- and post-transformation are gorgeous
https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/4900-kissanime-anti-adblock-blocker
and then get this script
it's an extension that lets you run scripts on your browser
<@239893407122718721> anyway, get tampermonkey
thank though, I appreciate it
that's alright, it's on youtube anyway
what am I, a pleb?
>no sound
well, that's why you use the anti-antiadblock script
You can adblock everything in there
you can even download it as an mp4 from kiss directly if you wish
and is available maybe half an hour after it's uploaded
it's uploaded to there like right away
well, it's up on kiss anyway now
not like it takes up space
also you can just delete what you download right away
it's up on kissanime though?
are you like, watching it on youtube?
HUH?
a shortened version?
lol what
all the shemha godmiku fanart
now I'm just waiting for the fanart
I'm not sure where Vanessa farted those fragments from, but that's what it was
there were fragments of it around the vambrace iirc
I watched HF2 just before the episode
HF2 ENDING ALL OVER AGAIN
IT'S LIKE
DUDE
DUDE
HERE WE GO CYPHER
maybe dark Nia would fit more
lol code geass
since in the transformation scene the silver arm was included
although it seems related to shemha
that's the maria thing
Maria, Fudo, Basa, Noble Red
she's gonna punch god a lot more soon
not yet at least
a song will finish me off
this ep already did that
a new miku song will kill me
just stripping
both pre and post transformation
every single second of it
i love it
if we wanna keep the gurren lagann reference
I think the last one fits more with AntiSpiral Nia
since she's/he's/it's currently the strongest being around
shemha might not though
||https://twitter.com/golden_nabe/status/1097110352666324992||
to clarify what I mean
got the perfect fanart for you
also Cypher
kerrik beat me to it
but after the season
oh they definitely are
just look at her form
it is

cos it takes a lot of designs from SSJ + the aufwachen in the back
It's a Shem-ha fused with SSJ imo
"If I become a bad person, will you stop me?"
maybe fudo is like adam after all
dont pull G shit
if shemha stays for one ep only i'll rage
the top bun and bottom bun of a burger
bikki doesn't even know what top and bottom are
miku is top
<:HibiMikuCry:586026583870013455>
conversely, Shem-Ha proves to be so overpowering that everyone has to team up to fight it
kind of
in the end it was both a fetus and a cocoon
alien invasion would ruin it like it ruined franxx
no it wouldn't
also can we talk about how the ending this time was a montage of miku from s1 to axz?
it could be final boss, it could also not be
yeah, we don't know anything about shemha
maybe he isn't
everything about it is just perfect
i'm watching miku's transformation for the 50th time by now
could've just compelled her to put on the bracelet and work it from there
it's weird they had it disintegrate Miku and then teleport her inside the fetus
if it has SSJ's relic erasing properties, it'd be an incredibly tough opponent to topple
https://twitter.com/japan_yen/status/1165425444872581120
FANART!
YES!
he's laughing from purgatory at how the gears brought this upon themselves
yo imma head to sleep, but if anyone finds more shemha miku fanart, ping me so I can see it in the morning
THANK YOU KIRAKI
AHHHHH
https://twitter.com/kiraki217_jpn/status/1165325289498365953
it's too good
https://twitter.com/SpWhiteBs/status/1165382966618382336
all the XV craziness
yep
Shmeha Miku is simply too gorgeous
I don't remember either lol
heck, from the ending of axz even
although we expected this since ep 1
not every day that headcanon becomes canon
"This is just reverse My Sunshine"
I laughed when I saw people say
I have to admit
lol, yeah
I never buy BDs
honestly, not really
i dont think Kaneko knew either
's vessel
who'd have thunk this little ball of sunshine would become a god
||moon is evil in TTGL. Moon is evil in Gear. Gear is TTGL prequel confirmed||
the fact that this whole scene was a giant gurren lagann reference sold it to me even more
https://twitter.com/japan_yen/status/1165425444872581120
https://twitter.com/SpWhiteBs/status/1165382966618382336
https://twitter.com/kiraki217_jpn/status/1165325289498365953
imma post the three pieces of fanart I found so far
yeah, that's how you don't do overreactions
probably a little bit of both
and now this
last ep with carol
he just has wonderful reactions
https://youtu.be/06yccPICXBA
~~it helps that I'm jewish so it doesn't even count as idolatry~~
~~i'm already worshipping it~~
I can see Noble Red kneeling before it and begging for human bodies
All it did was say it was upset and introduced itself
We don't know its agenda yet
unless they precure it and have them run all at once
too long
no way
heaven's feel double feature
i scrolled up a lot and saw you mention something about Miku's body being a fake?
btw millhi
day 2: replayed miku's transformation for the 200th time. I still haven't gotten tired of it.
I have 4 so far
https://twitter.com/akisan_0403/status/1165560176763490304
ahhh yeee, more art
it seems like the Custodians/Annunaki weren't really so much gods, but a highly advanced ancient civilization that were wiped out
even better image
very different
what enki had
what?
So im glad she doesnt have it here
I hate the visor tho
It took a while for ssj to grow on me
Im just waiting for the moment Basa backstabs them due to mind control
Whether he succeeds or not is too unknown atm
Meanwhile Fudo will pull strings to ensure Shemha obeys him
And help them undo everything
Perhaps Noble Red will cut their losses and join SONG
I want shemha to be the endgame boss, but i dunno what to expect
Hard to say
How it'll turn out...hmmm
Solo yes
SSR ShemHa Miku pseudo Servant
Cypher
an unfinished sentence
It's like
cos Shem-Ha just means "Name of"

what are all these acronyms

if it doesn't inspire, then there's no point in writing just for the sake of it
I need to see how XV ends first
if the answer you're looking for is "I will write a fanfic", then the answer right now is gonna be no
maybe you're projecting your interests on symphogear too much
I can't imagine a fight if I have no idea what he does
i have no idea who this is
then no
the actual one or some obscure reference one
although depends on which you're referring to
yeah
it was obvious when Shemha fetus looked like Frieza
always knew Symphogear was just a prequel to DB
it was called the illuminati
there was
https://twitter.com/zoidzero1/status/1165454839305973760
gaijin BSOD
maybe shem-ha can open the gate on its own
technically it is?
Finish HF and Ill tell you
XV is just a reference to Heaven's Feel
Damn it millhi beat me to it
<:HibiMikuCry:586026583870013455>

The God(you) thing
Well, we have an answer to the teaser now
Jesus was a self insert this whole time
The new testament is just a fanfic of the old
https://twitter.com/kiraki217_jpn/status/1165325289498365953
We want her to sing, period
Gurren lagann reference
Theyre yugi and atem now
Godmiku is in the house
Lel
Summons on a throne and sits on it with legs crossed
Solopy requests to be tagged in any Kamiku fanart you find üëå
But it'll be in her adult cool voice
Only Hibiki had a spirit guide
No aliens
Fudo is just Shemha's Woz
Miku can see Thestrals now <:Cag:423197445644615711>
Is sexy af
Cos it kinda happened?
Should punch god in the face be marked too?
[GRAND BATTLE 1/1]
Arguably, she made kt worse
She has saved anything this time though
https://twitter.com/kiraki217_jpn/status/1165325289498365953
For prosterity, here's kiraki's art again
Cos Noise
That was lit
the kaiju bikki thing was a waste of time
that was so disappointing
while Miku was fantastic, the best Gear transformation for is between Bikki and Basa
imagine that
Gear by Ufotable
You know, I've been wondering
her little relaxation hobby saved her ass
or Hibiki's appearance caused it to speed the process up
and unfortunately, she was too late
they failed to stop it
the ritual is already done at this point
oh then if it's the Majin Buu sort, it's not that bad
Elfnein's words don't make an awful lot of sense. She says that the divine power is not using Miku as a vessel, but rather is absorbing her.
Now, correct me if I'm wrong, but absorbing something means said thing loses its form forever and becomes a part of the bigger whole, like nutrients in the body.
This, at least in this context, could mean that Miku is *actually* dead... unless we're going for the Majin Buu sort of absorption, in which case it's not irreversible.
you just watched the ep?
hey friend
but I doubt it'd be that easy
I *can* see Kirika's soul cutting ability to come up again as a solution to Shem-Ha
hmm
like
shem ha in shinai can be hilarious
it has no substance aside from that
asuka is just suffer porn
lol, special ops asuka isn't even close to gear
earn your happy ending... ending, would be lit
cos everyone is still alive but separated forever can count as happy
define happy
Do we have anybody here that played Wild Arms and can tell us what to expect?
an ending he use *twice*
a madoka ending would suck ass. thankfully, urobuchi doesn't write symphogear, so we won't get a god ascendant ending
yeah, maybe shemha really is just a sentient relic
"Miku!"
"Bitch, who dat."
its personality is unknown
we don't know anything about shem ha really
since it did nothing until then
I can see it that Hibiki approaching made Shemha accelerate the process
being all jii
and then you have a stoic miku walking around
is to just remove Miku's hair ribbon
the secret to awakening shemha
but maybe Fine was in love with Shem-Ha
That's why Enki might've felt forced to activate the curse
Shem-Ha might've been too dangerous
except you know, for a different reason other than for shits and giggles
which fits here
like, just how bad is Shemha if Enki had to curse all of humanity just to make sure it doesn't show up again
Enki is hardcore
dooming all of humanity just so this one piece of jewelry doesn't fuck everyone over
fucking hell
undo the curse and make all of humanity able to host divine power and thus resurrect its extinct race?
Shemha is just a misunderstood little custodian amirite
shem-ha is just ultron
give us a nice chunk of backstory
Shem-Ha may decide to be kind and introduce itself fully next episode
we don't know anything really
Shem-Ha is completely different from Enki
wasn't it being dismantled?
they'll need to get started then
*hundred
...shit, that actually sounds plausible lol
he's been doing things differently this season
that's true
things never panning out as they should
one of symphogear's biggest problems has been a lack of consequence
the reveal about maria ending up being boring
tsubasa's mind control thing never becoming actually important and just vanishing
shem-ha defeated within the first 10 minutes of the next episode and such
the plot points end up being a copout or forgotten
especially where it is now
it'd be very easy for them to ruin it
Kimi Dake Ni will be the catalyst
god can't know the light if it comes from the audience <:GarieWink:336657101273169921>
~~wave your miracle lights! <@297542051057238017> ~~
the ending was so mean
Days since Mikusmile: 1
We're not gonna see it for a while aren't we
look at that pure smile
https://twitter.com/ChuuniOniika/status/1165746654244429824
I laughed
S Y M M E T R I C A L D O C K I N G
I don't remember this
there must be something written on them!
QUICK! CHECK THE BUNS!
what were their expressions
who was the last VA to leave the building
as to what we can expect
now to dig for clues
!
oh, you just watched 6?
it seems like it
although the big question is how exactly will he get the divine power into Basa when he knows only those free of the curse can use it
it be could be
I still think it's taking the "sword" thing too literally
it really depends
if Shem ha can't get there alone
a method to get to the moon, perhaps
possibly
it could just humor them cos it's a god and it can do what it wants
I can also see them teaming up with SONG to spite Fudo
I can see Noble Red switching allegiances to Shem-Ha if she becomes a new faction
shenshoujing
named out of convenience yeah
inb4 a part of Fine's soul still exists in Arigetlam
and Sugita
and Miyuki Sawashiro
and then it's leaked that Yui Horie did too
inb4 we hear Minami was one of the VAs to walk out of the building on the last day of recording
it was agitated at being called the wrong name and then presented itself quite grandiosly
all we really know of shemha atm is that it seems to be somewhat prideful
so thus far, everything has been going according to his plan nearly perfectly
so Miku was always a part of his plan, i think
it seems he was banking on having a counter to the god slayer
ep 11 maximum tbh
that somehow ended up in anarctica
the scorpion apparently was an ancient subspecies of one
and Miku is a scorpio
all of the receptor children are Fine descendents
well, she *is* related to Fine
it hasn't been touched upon enough since then that's why
whose name isn't Nuada
cos apparently some other god had a silver arm
did they even talk once
Ver for Tsubasa = ?!?
Listen for hints
slice of life fancomics aren't probable scenarios in this situation
but then that is also kinda repetitive too
I wanted to say "imagine Gear with Kajiura soundtrack"
doko made mo is a remix of gyakko oh wow I didn't notice
the tears clean me
oh look, I don't need to shower anymore
and not exclusive to jojo either
when it's brought up in every conversation without any relevance, then yes, it's a bad thing
it didn't work until now, so it won't work again
Trying to make everyone equally important won't work for Symphogear
multiple times
she had one
something something army iirc
or at least improve humanity to the point it could face Shemha or something
so you could argue them not being mentioned is actually the point
undesirables
well, I suppose they're fodder even within the Illuminati
daddy issues: the animation
and since the Chateau fell into the hands of Fudou, why would he do anything to it
at this point, I don't think a nuke will be very helpful in anything
it's a clever little thing, but has no basis
only if it has a 76 attached <:Ver:336656981144109066>
(not mine obviously I didn't draw that)
someone said hibiki dual wield
he's a rotting corpse is what he is
we'll have to see how much of SSJ is in shemha
force ghost
as a force ghost
the harp?
you know
carol's relic
was it ever even destroyed?
and that he needed something to use against her
since he knows Hibiki has god killing powers
Miku seems to have been a part of his plan though
got hit with a blast of fire in the face and not even his clothes were singed
strong enough to overpower Millaarc with one hand apparently
that obeys his every command of course
the perfect sentinel
he wants to shape her to be a mindless protector
well they have to get it somehow
just cut it off his rotting corpse then
That's how it's usually pulled off at least
Although it stands to reason that atm, it's more like Shemha just took over her body and she's just dormant inside
I *can* see Miku having been deleted, but in that scenario, she'd be revived/recreated by divine power
And thereby lies the crux
If anything, the show did that *beautifully*
And then when it finally comes, and it hits you with all its force
So your anticipation builds up. You want the train to arrive already, to do its thing. You're expecting it, but at the same time nervous
You don't know how fast it's going. You only know it's coming
You can feel them vibrating. You can see the smoke from the train rising up on the horizon, yet you don't know how close it is. You can even hear the train approaching, and it might even enter your sight
It's like you're standing on the tracks
To take the train metaphor
Yes
Even if you see something coming, you dont always know how hard it will hit you
It's when you have solid hints but no solid evidence that anticipation builds
With Miku, it's been the very last scene of AXZ that built it up, followed by 2 years of nothing but theorycrafting. Then XV came, and the hints were consistently dropped slowly.
Not even a breadcrumb trail to lead us anywhere
All we had going for us were theories that she might still exist but no confirmations
Well, she wasn't really in any way hinted
The hype being kept high with each cliffhanger
And waiting for it to be dropped
I guess it's because of the anticipation
But even so, it was still shocking
It was hinted so heavily it was obvious it was going to happen
Exactly the feeling here
how useful it would be if the Gears had that, huh?
you mean "tactically retreated"
fast combustion I suppose
Building it up for so long only for it to fuck off after a single ep will be a major disappointment
Honestly, anything less than 2 episodes of it will be a cop out
Another one we can expect to come but dont know when or how hard it will hit
The train metaphor
This is exactly what theyre going for though
Ep 9 will reveal a lot
Not necessarily
I can see Hibiki just somehow getting godlike powers at the end and just fixing everything and everyone
They're memeing
But thats if I really push my imagination
If I squint hard enough, I can see a madokiash ending
It's just the "earn it" kind
Considering a happy ending is on the horizon
It's probably right
Of course, they had to be extra mean with that ending sequence
Im sorry what
And we know japan and their idols
It's basically idols for them
Easy af
With a cast like this plus lovable characters? Oh boi
Japan loves symphogear
Twitter artists went wild from what I saw
this nerd with the glasses and the ipad is the popular soccer boy?! wew
from these screenshots, GX takes the cake
the series would crash and burn because stand jokes are already stale by this point
Which characters would get snapped out of existence?
autoscorers died for our sins
wouldn't that be bloody amazing if it could happen
I mean isn't it basically the same plot thread atm too?
but first, hibiki has to go under house arrest for using amalgam
and then she love love tenkyoken with miku
I want love love tenkyoken as the final attack
suspicious similarity



<:CarolShock:430939013235474432>
i misunderstood
yeah, just ep 12 then
ahhh okay
how long is the vacation
yeah, possibly ep 12 as well
you're gonna miss the finale
when next month
So easily
Carol wiped the floor with NR
Vain hope you have there
brilliant
Kanade!
who would be in place of the king of hearts I wonder ü§î
Yes
It hits hard, but not even god knows how it got there
And a train literally drops on top of you from the sky
It'd be like walking down the street
To use the train metaphor
it's a very common thing to do
leitmotifs
definitely a Chris song more than anyone else
no lyrics
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DTMJ_CCn2o
here's an instrumental version
it reminds me of scar's song from the lion king
which is basically what it is
although it gives off an evil mastermind vibe
Oh, definitely
Hibiki's songs are a lot more... lawful good? for a lack of a better word
yeah, they'll never give her a theme like that
yeah it's available
everything will be scary
üò±
tomorrow we say tomorrow for preview pics
and the grass is green
like it's deleting them
have each clip of Miku get thanos'd
You know what they should've done in the ending of ep 8, just to punch us harder?
damn
a secret melody in the song?

nani nani
well there we go
I seem to recall battle angel alita having something similar
it's using them well that's the challenge
as funny as it sounds, it's not that difficult to come up with unique powers
as a powerup to ssj
too bad aegis got used
maybe he's like adam
just shemha in general
not miku shemha, at least
to be fair, the circumstances are different now
Well, it's not like mythology is all that scientific anyway
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zecharia_Sitchin
you know that annunaki = aliens thing is pseudoscience, right?
especially after that gut-punching ed change
it probably still exists as a thing, but they can't really use it
yeah, they're fun
it's be difficult to find something that doesn't have at least a little bit of a nod towards some mythology
i remember 00 names their gundams after angels
somewhat?
you just need to incorporate it in some way
that you don't need to make up
because it's basically a free idea
but mythologies are easy to work with
there probably are
japan loves playing around with mythologies
just open the gate and let them loose
I mean it's not like Shemha has to direct the noise or anything
But nobody got time fo dat!
The type that clogs the drain
Cos then she'll unlock maximum oversaiyan form
12
Theres the STTGL fanart by nabe somewhere
but we didn't know when or how
nobody doubted that
of course we knew it was gonna happen
it's the circumstances behind it
it's not the fact that it happened
it's still a spoiler even if it was heavily foreshadowed
crunchy has no chill
(this amv was made in 2017 after axz ended)
(warning: might want tissues)

we'll see what they do with her this episode
shemha fucks off to the moon and won't be seen for a while hahahahahaha
yep, they're benching Shemha fucking lol
so they did bench shemha for a bit
TOP DAD
gib link
I wish someone looked at me like Shemha looks at the moon
"Oh yeah I kinda bewitched Tsubasa. Sorry my bad lol"
inb4 millaarc just tells SONG about it
just one episode of a bit of a lull won't be that bad
maybe he fights Shemha? cos the sky is dark in his background
I feel like this was inevitable
what mood whiplash
from god episode to meme episode
cos Fudou is all the way at the bottom
that's why I'm thinking it's Gen vs Shemha
so we can sorta understand the construction of this episode
yeah they do
iirc
well, the preview images do follow the episode runtime
that's their "oh shit" face
I do want to know what has Sakuya and Aoi so shocked
add deep fried red eyes and you're done
it's already shaking for us too
the fudou pic can make for a nice meme
it's the father episode in general
yeah it seems a little... out there
well, specifically in this case, it's because it's XV
DEVIL KEYWORDS
UPRIGHT: Shadow self, attachment, addiction, restriction, sexuality

REVERSED: Releasing limiting beliefs, exploring dark thoughts, detachment
Devil card is fifteenth Tarot card
Season is XV
ü§î
we always need a cliffhanger
episode will end with Shemha doing something on the moon probably
sorosoro something something something taindaze?
Fuudo: MOM SAID IT'S MY TURN ON YOUR WIFE

Hibiki: WTF?
he's saying such obvious things
succeed, you mean
>will try
<@398201668338057216> https://www.biddytarot.com/tarot-card-meanings/major-arcana/devil/
they gave shemha a personality she'll not actually have lol
the fanartists ruined us
get yourself a girl that looks at you like Shemha looks at the moon
even though it's a god
devilish looking
I like how shiny Shemha is here
meaning it's probably Gen vs Shemha
and fudou is all the way in the end
thus far, they've been placed in order of events in the episode
mostly due to how the preview images are placed
Although I don't think it'll be Gen vs Fudou
and then sends his soul to heaven
"I HAVE NOT A SINGLE REGRET IN THIS LIFE!"
Gen will be like
>Fist of the North Star
Shemha is the [GRAND BATTLE 1/1]
now we know
well Cypher
he does look like a sunrise villain

AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
>Ayahi talking about how she wrote Lasting Song also with the ep8 ED sequence in mind
and then went up close to the camera with her face lol
she came in with a green towel on her or something and was "invisible"
in the xdu anniversary stream
hikasa is great
Hikasa is a treasure
hahahahahahahahahaha
that whole scene was a gurren lagann reference too
let's let doomguy do it for us
*G-BEAT IGNITE STARTS*
Kanade is so alpha, she can even conquer the support staff
inb4 they get a scene together in the ep
didn't we get it into the episode proper?

jello
XV managed to have some great sakuga moments
the delay was for the best
the whole "take over your HQ" plan iirc was nothing more than a way to bait Elfnein out of the ship
and mikugear
and godzilla bikki
like hibiki's arm
past seasons were bad with it
things tend to last longer than one episode
so far, XV has been fine with consequence imo
~~I did?~~
official documents detailing her disappear
her existence is erased off of photos
DUM DUM DUUUUUUUUUUM
"...Who's Miku?"
and then they hit her with the bombshell
"Everyone, something's wrong! Dad doesn't remember Miku!"
Hibiki runs back to base
"Sorry honey, I've never heard of this Miku."
"What do you mean? You know Miku!"
and Hibiki is all shocked
inb4 it actually happens
"Hey dad, so Miku kinda became god and is on the moon now. What do?"
"...don't *not* run away?"
I wonder how much she'll tell him of the situation
oh she did? I totally missed that
maybe he'll prove useful in the episode
but who knows
neither did I
+ divine power for everyone
Xdrive Amalgam Ignite
that'd be really really annoying
oh god please don't tell me they'll cycle through everyone getting the offensive form
she's going to break that house arrest isn't she
Noble Red managed to get away with a lot because Fudou was pulling their strings
even in her song she calls them fodder
and then lost again
came back all confident
ran away
it was hilarious how they lost the first time
she wiped the floor with them
>when symphogear fans finally like a season
maximum oversaiyan
she'd want to cube Millaarc like she cubed Fine in the manga
how the hell will Tsubasa handle that I have no idea
I mean ep 8 had a gurren lagann reference towards the end there
https://twitter.com/golden_nabe/status/944200301539508224
<@143515786743382016> so this?
the funny part is who she used to be before meeting SG
jokes are supposed to be funny though
seriously
I honestly don't remember it
wait what? Fine was Caesar?
secret videos circulating in sympholand dark web
there'll always be those leaking that info
as if!
an entire school signing a non-disclosure?!?!
like hell that worked!
I feel like the public already knows Tsubasa is a Gear but choose not to say anything
4chan in sympholand must be a party
that's what Gen calls him
it's spelled *Aniki*
He means Yatsuhiro
Fudou has the country in his palm, pretty much
He's actually a goddamn genius
honestly, I think the opposite
we saw them
yes
where did they come from?!
Superman?!
Batman?!
it means the pictured moment is in some way the crux of the episode
it happened in every episode
yes the shaking pic thing is known
a little late for a time heist
I would be very angry at a timeline reset ending
and even smaller chance Hibiki will do it
that there is no way Miku will die
it's already been discussed many times here
probably not
well shemha is getting benched so Fudou isn't the final boss it seems
The Gears chase Shemha to the moon
Considering the american-japan project that is a rocket is involved
I suppose the final battle will take place on the moon though
without any main characters dying
a good ending can also be happy though?
One image of him sends waves all over
I know right

[GRAND LAST BATTLE 1/1]
By Inorin
But he did get beaten
awwww, why don't the red eyes move too
THAT WAS SO FUCKING HYPE I DUNNO WHAT TO DO ABOUT IT
THIS EPISODE
HOLY SHIT
CYPHER
DUDDEEEEE
SHOWWWW
THIS
IS
WHAT
AAAAAAAAAAA
WHAAAAAAAAT
HOLY FUCK
CYPHER
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
basa pulled the bishamonten sword there with amalgam
this was too good
AND THEN CUT THEM BOTH
IT FRIEZA'D ELSA FIRST
IT CUT ALL OF THREE IN HALF
SHEMHA KILLED NOBLE RED HOLY SHIT
MY HEART CAN'T HANDLE ALL OF IT
SYMPHOGEAR PLEASE
how can we not??!
i have no idea where they'll take this from here
i can't handle all this hype
how do we survive till the next episode
so Enki and Shemha may have been enemies
Yatsuhiro is probably not dead
so it seems that system is an innate part of SSJ? if it had it both times
nah, it isn't
how did they add that in
that's what I'm wondering
but how does it still have the feedback system
faust robe of shenshoujing
<:HibiMikuCry:586026583870013455>
Akira was useful in the episode
and to the shock of everyone involved
4 episodes from the end
XV is where it ends
nope
fucking beast
vanessa perspective
https://twitter.com/golden_nabe/status/944200301539508224
Fudou is a goddamn beast

dress came back yeah
or something
or shemha will revive them as slaves
pretty standard bachelor apartment
although it talked about them like they're cockroaches
>shemha likes humans
lol
oh
Noble Red Steaks
I don't think we completely know what she actually feels
well, Hibiki is always one to hide her feelings
get outta here and go watch it
yep
fucking lol
they got frieza'd
i wonder how the hell does the feedback system even work on a god like shemha
well, Shemha is out now
poor girl had enough of that already
thank god Fudou failed in mind controlling miku
and Noble Red put it there while she was in the chateau
I'm thinking that it's not connected to the gear, but rather to miku's body directly
like, how would Fudou get to put it there if even he didn't see godmiku coming
It didn't quite make sense for the ssj to have the feedback system again
I just thought of something
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuji-in
taoist mantra
it seems possible for either to be true lol
or that's the legit Ame-no-Murakumo
either he named his sword Murakumo
||~~it can finally put a lid on the stand jokes~~||
not only cos it wouldn't have made sense considering she has no chemistry with any of the axz ones
i'm glad basa's amalgam didn't have an alchemist joining her

her hair was kinda floating and that was pretty
I liked that view of Miku right as Vanessa got cut
no mercy
probably not dead
which is a very blatant foreshadowing
so he tried to lift her spirits by telling her how "curse" and "blessing" are very similar in kanji
because Hibiki has her catchphrase of "I might be cursed"
that's part of the purpose of the scene
seems like Shemha activated them with that red pillar
yeah
in Symphogear though, there seems to be a whole lot more behind that
so god punished humanity
and tried to reach heaven
yes
the biblical explanation as to why humanity has different languages
then those people don't want to understand the purpose
second, to not very subtley foreshadow that the curse of balal may not actually be a curse
first, to show how similar they are
what's FG again?
so maybe Noble Red do know how to make them
and the AXZ alchemists had them
it's not a Symphogear
Faust Robes are alchemical creations, no?
because Fudou did want to use Miku as a vessel from the beginning
bridge bunnies doing their own badassery
yeah, most of us did
Miku probably won't die either
Miku can't catch a break with that
maybe this specific SSJ is just yata no kagami
the dude is a monster
yeah like how the fuck will they keep him jailed
she was never on his side
He failed to control her
TLB?
it convinced no one
yeah that was a weak cliffhanger
at least, not on the level of the other episodes
we actually didn't get much of a cliffhanger this time
newer events has the Gears with the rebuild version
but it is a bit weird cos ever since AXZ appeared in the game
xdu has it's own canon that diverges after 3.5
no
that just feels icky
I like Hibiki and Miku but I wouldn't go as far to say they're my waifus
Susano'o in the house

Manga Tsubasa:
Anime Tsubasa: "I shall not kill!"
if we add the manga in, Fine got cubed by Tsubasa only to regenerate from it right away
they wouldn't kill them so unceremoniously like that
yeah, currently it's doubtful they're dead
that would've been a nice dose of karma
Shemha should've killed Milaarc by piercing her through the chest
they're all over the place after all
they might need a hand after all of this
Frieza'd
that's harsh
like she's trash
the way shemha looks at her
she hasn't said a single word past that
that was Kirika's contribution to the episode lol
it's only 15 chapters
symphogear manga

it feels a bit too sudden to be permanent
we'll have to say how permanent it is though
and then cut in half
first she got frieza'd
shemha was brutal
no reason it'd just cut off her arm
nope
now it's symmetrical
first it was asymmetrical
if she doesn't end up believing she's a duck after all this mental fuckery, it'll make no sense
now she's both possessed *and* nearly got mind controlled
first she was mind controlled in G
miku can't catch a break
that was Enki at the beginning of ep 1
and now throwing doubts on whether or not the curse of balal is actually a curse at all
but it mostly likely has something to do with the lunar ruins that got activated at the end
people? no
but it still worked for his purposes
it may not have been how he intended it
Shemha was a happy accident for him
and had them installed the direct feedback system directly on Miku
he probably supplied Noble Red with the SSJ fragments
He most likely knows what went down during Frontier
He had always intended to incorporate her in his plans
Well, he knew Miku was a potential vessel for the divine power
first time I hear of Ame no Habakiri breaking in the legend
which got unceremoniously broken which really shocked me considering how famous it is
well, I suppose that dying part has been finalized
they're desperate after all
for her not to kill them instantly, I suppose
basa seriously can't catch a break
and now they killed him
just before she had her big breakthrough
<@377429672264335363> well, Nana's father also passed away so...
well, Basa now became a little more like Nana now
and of course she immediately started crying once her gear dispelled
and she screamed the final lyrics rather than sing them
she had a crazed look in her eyes as she swung the sword down
Tsubasa was in such a fragile state of mind, killing Fudou would've honestly broken her completely
Honestly, it might've been for the best
unbearably so
he stopped Tsubasa precisely because he doesn't want her to kill anyone
he doesn't want to kill
force him to watch western movies
there's something quite derpy about his face here
his anatomy is fucked lol
what is that pose lol
He was a big mastermind the whole time
despite being a warrior, Tsubasa deals with death very very poorly
but honestly, it felt like Tsubasa was really on the brink there
I'm usually not a fan of the whole "if you kill him you'll be just like him mindset"
it's very anime of them to do that, but I can sorta understand it this time
more like slap out of it
daaaaamn
also shit, what is that scar
nice nipples
in G she was sorta half mind controlled
she's literally not in control of her body
honestly, now it's not even her fault
kinda blew up ships there
well, I think she did also in G
if she's dead at all
iirc, no, topdad did not hit his family
in fact, he was used very well
meanwhile, to everyone's shock and surprise, Topdad wasn't terrible
Also after it blinks up again, it's not on the brace anymore but on its side
Oh shit now I cant unsee it
The thing on her back is the feedback system
The whole thing is ssj as a faust robe
As a faust robe no less
Just an arm movement
Shemha literally gave no fucks
I'd say Genjuro is basically Kenshiro but he loses too much and doesnt lose his shirt enough
You know what? No
Hibiki is actually a hokuto no ken parody
>Hibiki a jojo parody
>>
<<
<:CarolStare:336656462287994882>
Amalgam only works because of the alchemists though
Who has yet to make an appearance
If anyone, Tsubasa should get Kanade
His ultimate plan ultimately failed
He finally got some comeuppance
Edgebikki
I dare say the last good event was the Mikugear one
But then they kinda forgot about Gjarallhorn lol
It used to be
Even if you take it as a visual novel, it's still very poor
With the exact same plot developments
Many of them are just copy paste of each other
As for other events
They were literally on drugs
And they suffered severe withdrawl when it was off
Gave them a high while wearing them
Which acted like opiods
In a nutshell, several of the girls end up with wedding style Gears
Because it was so terrible
An event story pulled off hours before release
It was the lowest XDU went
Have you heard of the wedding event?
But it's just that bad
There have been attempts to translate xdu's story
But they just recycle the same 9 characters in different costumes
New wielders with new gear couldve been rad
Had xdu gone the fgo/magiarecord way, it couldve been leagues better
Magia record has its own story that is good
Xdu has garbage writing
inb4 Shemha was the Sealed Evil in a Can trope
as a means to not give Shemha anymore hosts
in that case, it would stand to reason why Enki turned on the curse
she had it installed in her this entire time
like
this is giving me the impression the feedback system was never removed from Miku lol
they're weak af
they're desperate after all
but the sheer suddenness of it all is what throws doubt
yeah, had they made an extended scene out of it, it'd be more believable that they're dead
hahahahahahaha
frieza'd
it was more like
it wasn't even pew
I'm not sure how the head thing ties into it, but from this we can infer that this thing on the back is the actual system

she had a similar thing in G too
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-UyJfrDSV4U
well it was, but not as heavy
for once it wasnt a cliffhanger
yeah lol

today was our G callback episode
the moon is gigantic holy hell
too happy
This was reality
In some world
What couldve been
if she remembers anything that happened
shemha revives her as a gundam
Vanessa's next reference I see
what about *ALL* the swords?
references are far easier to notice
inspiration and references are different things though
like all of her attacks, or at least most of them, are a reference to a mecha show one way or the other
Vanessa was turned into a mecha reference
aren't rider kicks
vanessa's kicks...
i dunno how to tell you this meta, but...
go full diebuster
Basa cant catch a break
Oh geez
Can someone upload again? Im on mobile
Cumtart lol
i honestly doubt we'll get a dmjii duet
In fact, he actively added to it
To everyones surprise
But topdad didnt crash the season
AXZ was kinda ehhh as a whole
while with Fudou, it was sheer rage
Although I suppose you could also argue that when it was Prelati, it was out of duty
lol, if they hadn't fucked up that part of AXZ like that, then not killing Fudou would've been a lot more impactful
rocks fall on top of him as he laughs
classic villain death
maybe Tsubasa's crying that episode was Nana's own
I'd like to put Chossei on trial for pun crimes
in Symphogear? No, not at any point
she's not a bad god though
bad gods are so prevalent across all media it's honestly hard to pinpoint a good example because it's literally everywhere
it said like what, 3 lines before being knocked out?
too bad we only got a glimpse of shem ha's personality
ah yes, the PTSD version of Lasting Song
thus ends XV
~~and we get a 9 Gear song~~
~~temporarily bringing back Serena and Kanade as force ghosts to help out~~
~~It becomes the Antispiral and summons a giant mecha while the Gears summon their own giant mecha~~
it won't come to them easily
well, it'll obviously go the route of "Earn your happy ending"
you havent heard it yet?
she needed a moment to calm herself after recording
I can just imagine if after the episode
God
like, you made the comparison, and it instantly reminded me of the army of "that" guys that can't shut up and are generally obnoxious in just how much they try to force you to do a thing
personally, I'd say that's not the way to do it
yeah...
don't be "that" guy with them
if they don't want to and/or don't like it, don't force them
but remember
I feel you Avatar
amalgam version isn't out yet
he deserves it
that's okay, that belongs to Fudou
Don't you think she had enough?
Every time someone says Heavenrend instead of Ame-no-Habakiri, Tsubasa suffers more
YAAAAAAAHAAAAYAAAAA
So her B-side is dedicated to daddy?
all that's missing is to actually listen to the song
you've probably even read the lyrics at some point
and what it is about and what message it delivers
I mean you've probably heard of its contents plenty of times already
maybe it's cos of the god slaying power
i forgot the reason the fool's stone worked at all
sorry but the "Watch Symphogear" meme that's been going around is the opposite of helpful
you gotta present it humbly but positively
you mean a weird looking live action?
not to forget the magical girl elements and mecha
Super Sentai and Toku in general
and somehow, they manage to be insufferable
the part I stopped reading
``I've also seen it described as a magical girl show made in the image of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure, which is pretty accurate.``
yeah
nana mizuki
lol yes
``Rin Pyou Tou Sha Kai Chin Retsu Zai Zen``
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuji-in
it's a taoist mantra
a live action adaptation of sailor moon
pretty guardian sailor moon
They got their wish, but they don't have the mental capacities to enjoy it
decides to humor their desire to be human again and does so but instead they're mindless minions
their deaths were too sudden to feel permanent
because we don't know what Shemha can do, it's entirely possible it can resurrect the dead
that's if they're dead at all
honestly, I like the b sides more this season
it'd take too long to list the amount of mecha and wild arms reference in Gear
symphogear taking inspiration from something that took inspiration from something else that took inspiration from comics
they'd be indirect at most
probably not
I knew someone would make that guardians of the galaxy joke
got sidelined in ep 9 almost immediately
well, we still don't know any of shemha's powers after all
carol and shemha were classic cliffhangers
at least it's not the blood fountain cliffhanger
that's at least Cell/Majin Buu bullshit level she needs here
~~what if shemha has mystic eyes of death perception~~
Shemha really treats humans like insects lol
for all we know it's just a rogue AI from inside the bracelet
we don't know enough about Shemha to make an accurate assumption
well, considering divine power gets wrecked by human beliefs, it's not that unthinkable
controlling Miku, who's currently the passenger, wouldn't have changed a thing
currently Shemha is the one steering the wheel
Like
that's weird though
theoretically, like it did in G
but she just shut off the thing that made it possible
Vanessa said they needed to take control of the divine power
that's what really surprised me lol
poor team extra
maaaybe they should've kept it on and just tinkered with it a bit
another one wouldn't be so farfetched
we already had two mind control plot lines in this season
and cos she could be a vessel
the entire reason Fudou aimed for Miku was because he needed insurance against Hibiki
tfw even xdu bullies basa
shut up, I'm not crying, YOU'RE crying!
https://twitter.com/DevilMeo0301/status/1169283729459539968
so spoiling oneself on the others' is fine
only Hibiki's b-sides are ever played in the show itself
the b-sides this time are heavy hitters
||>My tears from twilight when you became the wind are not yet dry,
>And it brings back a flurry of memories whenever I close my eyes.

>Your strictly scolding voice was strong, honest, and frightening.
>It was what taught me how to live steadfastly, wasn't it.

>The day when you shouted "Don't be afraid to continue dreaming",
>I finally realized your true kindness.
>I'm sorry for being so immature...

>"It's not that people are to be protected because they're weak,
>We're able to protect them thanks to precious strength"
>With your final voice, you gave me wings.

>so that I never become unable to flap my wings.

>Lalalala I'll fly away, lalalala to the land of dreams.

>Even though we look nothing alike, I resemble your in my awkwardness.
>At some point, I became proud of my solitude.

>Ever since I proclaimed that I loved singing, your words became harsher.
>I'm sure you wanted to teach me the hardship of chasing your dreams.

>When the day comes for me to become the wind too and meet you again,
>this time, to properly say "thank you",
>I'll sing as hard as my breath allows, as hard as my life allows.

>I'm sure it will make you smile too...

>Lalalala Being loved, lalalala I loved.
>Lalalala I'll sing, lalalala with a smile.||
there is a 4chan tl for her b side
it'd be a sad world if the only thing people watched was what MAL said was good
tomorrow we say tomorrow for preview images
reminds me of this stupid reddit post lol
at this point, I kinda want a kiss just to get the waifuers angry
he'd have gotten bisected, and each half would have been cauterized immediately
and then you can die/get treeated
first you gotta give your final words
and well, anime
Shinji ran over right away though
but the daddy <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
one's her father, and one's her daddy
wielders of the glorious nippon steel don't need something as puny as a shield!
1. grabbing the songs
the wiki is good for exactly two things
ah wait it wasn't that one
ah yes, the scary teaser ost
saturday always
She's be the key to undoing whatever Shemha tries
If Airgetlam is whatever Enki had, then it'd be the opposite
and Apple's significance has yet to be revealed
we still have no idea what it is
nobody said it was Enki's arm though
mission impossible but on the moon
pfft, no
Might as well go all in
No point in baiting anymore
Well, final season
A joyful scream so loud it breaks spacetime
Are you kidding? The fireworks fron Lily's house would be visible from the other half of the world
Im so sorry you had to say that, even as a joke
The part Noise part Fine part Nephilim dashing MC
Clearly, the best partner for Hibiki is Jin Soryu Kusanagi Kazama Hellwalker
I was sure you like it perfectly hetero!
Wow Lily! I would never have guessed!
Clearly, that is an opportunity for self insert #357646 to come in and add them both to his harem
But those people have shit taste
Well, okay, I know who doesnt
Who doesnt like Hibimiku
i fucking knew that's what they'd put
and it seems that Shemha's resurrection was meant to be stopped at any cost
and the corpse in the coffin was Shemha
for one, it was Vanessa who made the SSJ faust robe
keywords confirm a bunch of interesting things
>Shemha keyword
Fudou smiling nervously is weeeeeeeird
wtf is this episode gonna be
classic symphogear
the keywords are scary and the preview images are unsettling
great
DMjii are gonna get amalgam this episode aren't they
it is literally a god yeah
so he did what he could to control Miku instead
Fudou knew controlling a god is impossible
they didn't count on Shemha at all
that's the thing
I mean...if you think about it...
lol what if that creature is actually Maria
ohhh right I keep forgetting the updated keywords apply to their episode number
I wonder why Shemha is still just standing inside there
oh well, that theory to the trash
i see
mhm
what if it was already done?
but *did* they interrupt it?
doesn't the direct feedback system keyword state that the control process is still ongoing?
unless google translate is being weird again
although
whereupon writing the first gives a golem life, and deleting the first letter kills it
oh so we're gonna go with that 'Emeth' 'Meth' thing I guess
but the shemha keyword mentions a golem
okay maybe it's google translate being weird
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shem_HaMephorash
we already knew what its full name was though
Kirika's smile is lying to us
I don't trust the silliness of the second half
yep, they *really* want to make us believe she's gone forever
```„ÇÇ„ÅØ„ÇÑ„Åô„Åπ„Å¶„ÅØ„ÄÅ
„ÅÑ„Å§„Åã„ÅÆËôπ„ÄÅËä±„ÅÆÊÉ≥„ÅÑÂá∫„Å®ÈÅé„ÅéÂéª„Å£„Å¶„Åó„Åæ„ÅÜ„ÅÆ„Åß„ÅÇ„Å£„Åü„ÄÇ```
```Everything was
gone with the memories of some rainbows and flowers.```
not everything is comics
soul is gone
literally completely deleted
not even ghost miku
yeah that
they're really pushing making us believe she's been deleted
for more excitement, just look at the miku keyword again
and the keywords are always scary
the preview images always lie
don't trust them
they're a lie like always
it has those little horns like she has with Airgetlam
doesn't this kinda make you think it might be Maria lol
in any case
yeah, that's what it means literally, but the term itself refers to a hidden name of god
tfw Adam was right
sealed evil in a can indeed
that'd be some mega bullshit
>show yatsuhiro getting shot
>basa thinks he's dead
>make a whole song about how dead he is
>have him actually survive
it'd be a copout of the century
her B-side loses its meaning
if he's not dead
the same wiki that somehow managed to translate ame-no-habakiri as fucking "celestial mudguards"
you're taking the wiki's word as gospel
that somebody is a hasty ass
we grab songs if we want, but other than that, nothing
we don't touch the wiki with a 10 foot pole
fourth of all, hell no
third of all, no
second of all, no
first of all, no

it has a red tip
I mean we do have a pretty big kaiju monster in the preview if that's what it mean
Enki must be rolling in his grave

Shemha was meant to be kept sealed
but yeah, the keyword seems to be implying that now
if she hadn't beaten Fine, this whole mess wouldn't have happened
this is all Hibiki's fault
Fine being around would've actually stopped everyone else from acting
Carol would probably destroy everything
s1 and G wouldn't have happened without Hibiki though so...
for all we know, this measuring tape has some nefarious evil plot behind it
remember to never trust the preview images
it could've been very fitting right now
too bad the relic cancer is gone
of course
OH GOD
oh god
>~~vietnam~~ xdu event flashbacks
>wedding dress
clearly, someone is saying hibiki is too fat
I can't believe XV was Heaven's Feel this whole time
I can't believe Symphogear was just a power rangers reference this whole time
except they're not all teenagers but SEMANTICS
teenagers with attitudes!
we already have the power rangers!
how accurate
fucking lol
and if she's not alive, she'll be resurrected
but we know symphogear by now, so obviously she's alive
and so does the show
the keywords really want us to believe that
~~did it already~~
<:TsubasaYareYare:407397617451139073>
Keywords: terror
Preview pics: a lie
Remember
And then punch you in the face with the actual content
Preparing you for a certain outcome you concluded yourself
They make you think one thing
To never ever trust the preview pics
It has been said
that fucking petition lol
It's going fucking ham on that line of thought
The show really wants us to believe she's gone
I think I have PTSD from Lasting Song now lol
How old
Wow, slenderman
I can see it
the song goes on about how dead he is
also, it'd remove all meaning from her b-side if he survives
the scene also shows how Hibiki is like him in a way
a coward who runs away when things are difficult
he's more than aware of what kind of person he is
yep, he did
kazanari gene is strong
it'd only work well if it keeps the same tone as the rest of the scenes
A training montage would be such a mood whiplash, ngl
but now we're on the MOON
maybe she'll show up for the finale
yes you can
mixing mythologies like crazy
really?
belldandy? of all people?
there's our shemha

MARIA IS ENKI'S DESCENDENT?!
and are strong af
noble red not noble dead
shemha has a personality and she's cocky as hell
a fuckton
TRUE FORM SHEMHA UNVEILED
WE ON THE MOON
OHHHH DAAAAAMN
so we have chris and maria left to amalgam
they just slammed into her from all sides
I don't think they broke it at all
then she'll turn them on again
Airgetlam confirmed to be whatever Enki's thing was
So I suppose Maria will be the one to shut off the ruins again
Yubel?
what's her face
how are they breathing on the moon though
at least Ver can't interfere now <:Ver:336656981144109066>
shemha is confirmed frieza
also basa raised a death flag on herself
the bikki basa moment was nice
that's all the fun
of course we're overthinking
no shit nougat
didn't the tree also look a lot like a demon pillar too?
Cypher
btw
Gear has only top tier VAs
they don't give characters enough time to process
I think that Symphogear is kinda low on the dramatic reaction front
we didn't *see* it, but he died
yatsuhiro actually died, which is good
in fact, it's more difficult to find a series that doesn't have them
you say that like other things don't have mythological references
something's weird with Shirabe's knee lol
i don't quite understand what Kirika's was
Amalgam can beat Super NR
at least the Gears can still beat Noble Red in some way
basa was determined to die to save Miku
[GRAND LAST BATTLE 1/1]
Beast class shemha confirmed
what did she do to the trees?
so what were Shemha's powers really
even gave millaarc one didn't he?
kaneko checking off all the mecha series he's watched
what reference is that
V-Combine
btw Melua
and I say this as a Miku fan
she's prettier than Miku
and quite frankly

we have a shape for our antagonist now
not even kamiku anymore
or destroy the world completely
it could either bring world peace
well, you can't really know that
as was said, SONG realized what their plan would be
then she might as well destroy it while it's on the ground?
nope, not majin
literally the same thing


also
and real Shemha is the final boss
more like penultimate boss Miku
well, first they need their Gears to get off the moon
inb4 a bigger, more massive threat appears, forcing Bikki and Shemha to cooperate
she has yet to acknowledge that Bikki is a massive danger to her
and this is all an elaborate plan on her part
or who knows? Maybe Shemha *wanted* the gears on the moon
well, now we know for sure Shemha doesn't have her fanart personality lol
well, Shemha is only on her 1/10000th of her power
keywords stated that Shemha was meant to be kept sealed
i'm an asshole
hello, my name is dr. ver
and then die
fuck up some crucial part of her plan
I can see NR turning on Shemha at some point
rip, tweet gone
we have no reason to doubt her atm
it also depends on the motivations of the characters in question
it's not that many? 1-2 at most
Ver and Adam didn't really show any remorse
usually the girls are more redeemable than the men
basa's b-side went very deep as to how dead her dad was
Vanessa is finally tired of being a walking mecha reference
A redemption arc depends on a character realizing their wrongs and doing their best to make amends
at this point, the actual number doesn't actually matter
what a laundry list of inventions <:CarolShock:430939013235474432>
```He also pioneered the ecchi genre with Harenchi Gakuen, and the netorare genre with Hanappe Bazooka He is credited with creating the Super Robot genre and for designing the first mecha robots piloted by a user from within a cockpit with Mazinger Z```
which mecha show is that again?
she committed to memory every person she killed
she remembers that exact number
it almost makes me believe that Shemha herself is more like... an AI? of sorts
It's also interesting that Shemha is able to use the feedback system to her own advantage
a faust robe is made in a completely different manner from a symphogear
the entire inspection was just a way to get the guards away fromt he important personnel
SONG were set up
resisting the inspection would've fucked SONG over completely
give Fine a song!
i mean we need to get this eventually
everybody gives Bikki their Gears
``the AXZ conversation implied that Hibiki and Miku might be able to wear any symphogear``
well, we now know how XV is gonna end
unfortunately, sarcasm doesn't transfer well over text
we were kidding
harem
~~pretty standard shonen ngl~~
at least, not named ones
Yeah, I don't think he does
hm? what's up?
hibiki longlegs + her right buttcheek isn't colored in

let's laugh at some quality screens, ye?
Rie Kugimiya?
I dunno
like uh...
inb4 it's someone shockingly surprising
Imma assume true Shem-ha's voice isn't yuka
Shem-Ha is one pretty lady though

she morphs Miku's body to match her original
let's up the ante
or you know what?
will either ditch it or get ejected
the circus
yeah
this seems like an appropriate reaction
and look what happened to them
they've been so desperate the entire season
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
ppfffffttt
some Kiara action
boom
Rie Tanaka
Ayako Kawasumi
I completely forgot VA names lol
wait for the x-drive amalgam
I DID IT FIRST!
>chris amalgam is BFG 9000
come with the appropriate expectations
lol millhi
it's not even subtle
100%


yep
She'll just blast you in the face and ask you how dare you try to confuse her with your puny human-tool numbers
already?!
"HEY GUYS, MIKU GOT POSSESSED BY A GOD! WHAT THE FUCK AMIRITE?!"
is that not once did they bring up the elephant in the room of
you know, something that bothers me a lot
"When life gives you lemon, MAKE BEEF STROGANOFF!" ‚Äî Also Cave Johnson probably
preferably housewife
now I'm waiting impatiently for True Shemha art
i feel like the shinais are gonna have some very weird Shemha/Noble Red shenanigans
alternatively, just go to nyaa and grab them from there
yeah they are
a direct response to Eiai Promise
it *is* for miku
not even 'basically'
kimi dake ni yeah
she cute
but I don't wanna punch her in the face
real shem ha
ep 13 will be the final boss
i can see it playing in ep 12
this whole episode is just people proving Shemha's point lol
you happy?
You're on the moon now Shirabe
yeah lol
I wouldn't mind an hour long finale though
I doubt it
are we looking at the one and only female character in Symphogear that won't have any yuri tease?
she does make quite a convincing argument
revert the world to its state 5k years ago =/= going back in time 5k years
they probably can
Goddammit Maria
at this point, "gods" in anime just refer to characters with powers that toy with the lines of what the show normally allows
damn it, communication! our one weakness!
female villain, gotta make her somewhat nice
something I can see happening is Miku's body being destroyed for one reason or another, then through the power of friendship and understanding, Hibiki gets Shemha to stand down and reconstruct Miku's body with the last remains of her power or some shit like that
nah, shemha is too final boss at the moment for that
we can compare, but the comparison would prove pointless in the end
she felt as *if* that happened
you took it too literally
ah, that
where did you read that fact?
w-what?
at this point they also destroy dimensions with just punches
^
because it's an absolute defense
Avalon is just special in that regard
his arrogance is always his downfall in every scenario
he isn't
you must learn to sail the seven seas!
is this a rich people joke i'm too much of a pirate to understand?
>spotify

which begs the question of why a relic related to Shemha play a song related to Enki
but she wouldn't have brought it up if it wasn't so...
the Enki part is just an assumption from what Shemha said, so it's not necessarily true
Well, Maria now is apparently a descendent of both Enki *and* Fine
you can see it in her eyes
She's so getting friendshipped
SHE CUTE
I'd wait a little bit for her to cool down first
Vanessa's Secret, the new hot clothing chain near you
lol
it's not mythology related at all actually
b-but her pair is Shirabe?
Basa is hellbent on making amends
>doctor strange turned into nanoha
you want to give him america's twintails too?
he already has america's ass
real shem ha is prettier
as much as i like miku
ngl
here is my counter argument
I don't think I'm mentally prepared to have Shem-Miku memes
Or they'll just use their maximum overx-drive forms and just fly back
Well, time to farm this jrpg dungeon
"The brickwork on this place is a shitshow."
She kicked her straight to the noise
No it wasnt
Next is a punch
Then a slap
Starts with a flick to the forehead
And then a miku gacha dropped before ep 10
And a basa event dropped just before ep 9
Well, the mikugear event got a rerun one day before episode 8
``never trust anyone, not even yourself``
Now just waiting for the [GRAND LAST BATTLE 1/1] in ep 13
<@87512939107450880> SSR Caster Pseudoservant Shemha
It's that pic of a guy in mcdonalds ordering food and he's like 2 times the height of the cashier
No wait
Is it the hamster with banana pic?
Maria is the tallest of the girls and even she's considered average for european countries
Asians in general are shorter on average
Yeah, they are
It was shot (ow) and then the fragment got dragged in
Isnt it a little too close for comfort?
I can never unsee just how gigantic the moon is in symphoverse
Tfw you'll never be a natural satellite getting headpats from a goddess
Didnt say happy for who
Kaneko said happy ending
Checks out
Imagine if it doesnt have the restriction anymore
Oh god, what if Millaarc's eye powers also got buffed
In anime where you get mind control/possession/turning evil plots, somehow after the fact it's almost never brought up again
That always makes me laugh
I've also just realized that the reason Miku's hair looks a bit strange is because the collar is so high, it's pushing her hair up
What is the Gear form even for lol
Yeah, Shem-Miku is queen
/demon pillar
The tree
Showing up again? Hahahahaha
Surviving? Maybe
I'd kill for a 10 years later epilogue
kinda weak
ehhhh
XV ends with Hibiki without a Gear fistfighting with real form Shemha ala Lagann-hen movie
that's just mean lol
what
is this your blog or something lol
they just reiterated what happened in the episode and made a bunch of references to other things
they didn't even say anything of note lol
what's that about her own anime?
wait what
old but gold
https://twitter.com/karoshimyriad/status/1067400301278187524
what's the source of this rumor?
looking at you FIS
it got so bad even their affiliates were affected
i know right
In hindsight, Vanessa shouldn't have banked on the century old ultra nationalist
the movie just came out no?
anime fandoms are a mistake
even if it's not strictly a fairy tale
it fits for Kirika's usual fairy tale theme
the shemha thing always felt a little too big to be resolved quickly
or this
does this count?
so I suppose the definition fits?
Well I *do* like girls
~~I mean that's what the 6 Gear songs are though~~

Shemha's angry is a very unexpressive üòê
"copyright infringment"
Miku isn't gonna die
we've talked about this
```It is simple how to deal with Mordred. Do not bad-mouth King Arthur. Do not praise King Arthur. Do not treat him like a woman. Also, do not bluntly treat him like a man. Do not behave in a stiff manner. Do not be infatuated with other Servants. Properly hear his opinions. Simple, right?```
Don't treat her like a girl, but don't treat her like a man
Mordred is easy to handle
to be fair though, Fate doesn't try to be historically accurate
King "I was actually a girl this whole time" Arthur
where Kaneko found it
and somehow made its way to wikipedia
and was put into Fire Emblem
there is no mythological relic that goes by that name
Ichaival doesn't exist
"where's bruce lee"
"seen better"
"4/10 not that exciting"
inb4 she watches the whole thing and says "meh"
Ichaival is fake
Gungnir is Norse
Antikythera Mechanism is Greek
Durandal is French
Red Dragon of Revelation is Christian
Nehushtan is Jewish
Shenshoujing is Chinese/Taoist
Shul Shagana and Ig Alima are Mesopotamian
Airgetlam is Celtic
Ame-no-Habakiri is Shinto
nothing there now
if you noticed, when Shemha revived NR, the bandage on Millaarc's arm fell off
speaking of Zababa
something only Fine knew how to do
there must be some magic component to it that nobody has replicated
nobody managed to do it
but just like linker
technically the entire world has that knowledge
She could go white like this
the gears must venture to the depths of the underworld to find miku's soul and return it
that actually sounds like a funky plot for a season 6
Cos you know, Enki's arm and all
I get the feeling that after Shemha turns off the ruins or something, Maria will use her Amalgam to turn them on again
but then Hibiki's brain would explode
probably
no hold barreled beat down
Bikki vs real form Shemha
yeah
but Bikki don't need no Gear to bust some heads
yeah
cos Shemha didn't watch action movies
and of course, win
and that is why hibiki will fist fight her
kill steal
that'd be a KS
Bikki fist fights with Shemha without her Gear
like lagann-hen movie
it'll be
nah nah nah
when it's closed it's fine
I dislike the visor too
because it's pretty ugly, yeah
and while she did go X-drive in the event, she didn't get a redesign
well, we know that Gears change after getting X-drive
and it stayed on her person since then
so she was given SSJ
since that bikki's negative emotions flowed into the mainverse bikki's, Miku decided to go to the alternate world to help her
that world's miku moved away before the concert and so Bikki had to deal with the fallout all on her own and became a loner
there was an event in xdu where she goes to save an alternate Bikki
long story short
she's officially a user there
your wish was granted in xdu though
well, the show is ending now so it's a little late to add her to the team
is if they become one conciousness
the only way for people to understand each other
after all
giant naked bikki
while church music plays in the background
the entire world starts turning into orange juice
let me write season 6 <:TsubasaSmug:585839805737467920>
when was the last time that was actually played straight though
still in the hospital after the concert
Hibiki wakes up
last 30 seconds of the season
lol
I will instabuy
give me a nonlewd xdrive miku figure üëè
Lel
more can't hurt
I mean we already had a gurren lagann reference in EP 8
yeets her from existence
and bikki is like "bitch i watch action movies"
Shemha of course is like "MASAKA!"
using the power of friendship and big gay
Bikki fist fights Shemha and wins
yes
https://twitter.com/golden_nabe/status/944200301539508224
this is the ending
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAf-mp4yYNU
end it like this
You're not missing anything
Good
That tastes like processed weeds
Fritz cola is the german cola
At least pepsi is a good pretender! <:ChrisAngry:336656958272700417>
Better tham fritz cola at least
This was the last time we saw our actual Miku smile <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
Oh suddenly she's okay with pepsi?!
If you know you do it then why do you keep doing it
She'd literally have the power of god and anime on her side
Imagine if Itaba was the one to get possessed
*ni*
*dake*
*Kimi*
don't speak for me
really appreciate it
thank you dino
not in this house
nope
you ruined it
/thread
Hibiki fist fights Shemha
Super Senki Zesshou Symphogear
but he's pretty predictable most of the time
he did bamboozle us sometimes
I'll be shocked if he does
nobody believes it
the keyword is about as convincing as ep 5's cliffhanger
you've reached your quota for being allowed to use this meme this week
aka, another attempt at trying to convince us miku is dead/deleted
it's the ending for the shinais
that's the miku keyword isn't it?
shemha becomes hibimiku's maid
can be a very useful mop
well shemha's hair is quite long
It's a direct response to eiai promise
Well, Kimi dake ni is pretty telling
In which case wow thatd be a bold move
Unless it does
The yuri will never be finalized
We're destined to be yuri tease forever
Chris is a strong independent woman who don't need no memes
<:ChrisShock:620077681484103680>
[ADVENT BEAST 1/1]
~~i dont listen to dmjii songs a lot~~
But honestly, Miku is the only one you cant ignore due to how blatant it is
You can try as hard as you can to ignore the yuri tease
It's like
Lets not forget her having hibiki in a swimsuit as her phone wallpaper
Her entire existence is defined by gay
Just her song?
Stuck in an endless loop? Seeing some perfect world?
I do wonder what Miku is doing while all this is happening
Eiai promise wont appear cos it's xdu context dependent
Fudou becomes Lordgenome
His plans went to shit
~~louis bias~~
It's supreme gay
Careful cypher
kyoani had
like uh...
I assume some of the bigger, more famous studios do
that's honestly surprising
they don't have their own building even?
oh wow
Well, Hibiki *is* pretty short <:MikuPraise:585839808765493249>
Too bad it isnt massive enough to become a black hole
*SUSPICIOUS*
>Berserk Bikki and Maria event started on XDU
when everyone is broken, no one is
in a world like that, Vandal Savage at least fits
DC has purposefully broken characters like Superman
The thing is
DC comic villain
sounds like a gary stu not gonna lie
we haven't seen enough of her to make a proper evaluation
I think it's also too early to tell what Shemha will be scared of
what's the point in that
he literally can't lose to anything
he's unbeatable
but that's not interesting
i'm confused
now I'll be disappointed if Hibiki doesn't fist fight real form Shemha to the death
it only did wonderful things
are you kidding
I've been listening to Sorairo Days and goddamn
I can't stop imagining a Lagann-hen style final battle for XV
and this is relevant to XV how?
<:HibikiWow:614268629952757760>
```„Éó„É≠„Ç∞„É©„É† „Ç∑„Çß„É†„Éª„Éè```
but the shemha keyword refers to her as a "program"
maybe it's just google translate being odd
fascinating
i know right
THIS ISN'T DREAMLAND<:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
I though Miku was just in dreamland <:ElfneinBullying:421432763078410241>
you'll get it from torrent even earlier
>wikia
death
<:CarolShock:430939013235474432>

holy shit
IT'S UP

flashback time
your present is your girlfriend being fucking deleted
happy birthday bikki
it's just that they don't really have a way to access it
it was always possible
<@!246146781832806401>
https://symphogear-xv.com/next/XVnext11.php
i'd say it's pretty sinister already
shemha probably gonna taunt the hell out of hibiki
Like a mummy
And we see Miku being wrapped up
Was the custodian corpse they found also wrapped up like a mummy?
Remind me again
Hmmmm
a shemha song will literally destroy me
it wasn't even needed in the end lol
shemha becomes hibimiku's maid after the final battle
a-at least give her a brush!
<:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
why do dis <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
that's Miku's face
but wfc
you're making a lot of assumptions about her goals and motivations without even knowing the full picture
we don't have any way to know that
<:GenjuurouThumbsUp:336657189475188740>
spoiler pfps aren't allowed
you should change your pfp
giving them all the power it provides without the loss of control
because ignite was made from dainsleif, a sword of bloodlust, it was able to artificially induce the state
the berserk state was always a function of the symphogears, but in hibiki's case her unique circumstances caused it to manifest a lot more times
it's cos hibiki was fused with gungnir
yeah
for extra disrespect
all that's missing is for nana's samurai drawing to pop out of nowhere and slap basa in the face
Adam in a nutshell
THEY'RE LEWDING THE LOLI AGAIN!
MOM
does that make kirika winter soldier?
captain rabe
exactly like power rangers
but how can you not like gold trimmed power rangers?!
*her
while the vambrace contained her consciousness
it's entirely possible she was simply trapped in that coffin and the body decomposed over time
and was meant to be kept that way
from what the keywords tell us, Shemha was sealed
if she died at all
full stop
okay dino
<:ShirabeConcern:586404485598019604>
~~lowkey expect and want that~~
that'd be so goddamn amazing
hahahahahahahahahaha
pfffffffft
miku has a big ribbon
it turned it from a rather cookie cutter franchise into something quite inspirational
honestly, I think it improved the series a lot by doing so
mid twenty first century
gits is section 9
gear is section 2
tfw Gear and GitS could exist in the same world
Ghost in the Shell
at least sakura wasn't getting deleted
are you kidding? this is worse than the sakura treatment
not the dreamland I thought she'd be in
I wonder how much more heaven's feel we'll get
anyway
neat
https://dragonball.fandom.com/wiki/Spirit_Bomb
yes you do
maybe she should go meet king kai and learn kaioken and spirit bomb
miku gets revived by the dragon balls
so basically
is reconstructed
and through the power of friendship, god, and anime
I expect her to get deleted
At *most*
and Shemha is just taunting her about how she's being deleted
Bikki asks what she did with Miku
Shemha and Bikki are talking
It's just like
nah
Imma assume it's Shemha taunting Bikki
from the way these two screens are placed next to each other in the preview
I thought she'd be in dreamland <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
I die too
aaaahhh
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
wholesome?
this is
*wholesome*
wholesome
nope

she used it to restart the ruins
but mom was up in that piece
it got catapulted into the vault and exploded
it was destroyed in the end of G
also how would the nephilim get up there
that's a stretch right there
so shemha decided to use it for herself
he failed
fudou tried to use it
we already saw that
clearly, they're the 5 day old kind
>fresh
>memes
choose one
do we really want it to be more famous
it might sound hipstery, but I wish they hadn't grabbed Gear
crunchy was a mistake
i can't get over the miku memorial we had there
also that fucking ending holy shit
i have ptsd from lasting song now
I was losing my mind at how both the movie and the ep ended up pretty much exactly the same
just before ep 8 I saw the HF movie
that was crazy
thought it'd be Miku going sorta evil
although I didn't expect it to be straight up possession
almost completely as I expected
they haven't broken this pattern yet
So we could kinda tell what we'll get
yep
before ep 10, a miku gacha
before ep 9, a basa event that had murakumo in it
one day before the episode aired, they reran the mikugear event
they did this before ep 8 too
an event with berserk bikki and maria did start yesterday in xdu
well
Can we get a Bikki rage face please
bikki definitely
at least 5 seconds
just from this episode alone
so Shemha was probably one of those he wanted to defeat
Adam seemed to be fearful of Custodians
there's white hair on the horizon
we got the black ribbons
<@87512939107450880>
!
https://twitter.com/golden_nabe/status/1097110352666324992
never forget
the ones up until now haven't really implied anything
in any case, I don't think the tagline should be taken too deeply
hence, making history
that is definitely going to be remembered
the whole events surrounding Brexit
to take a real world example right now
implies doing something so significant it's remembered for a long time
to create history, or the more common phrase 'make history'
Not necessarily
create a *history*
it'd completely ruin symphogear
that'd suck
why would they world reset
what
maybe amalgam lol
if it's still around
but I *can* see Carol doing something with it on the ground
but we don't know what else it does
we know it can operate Frontier and the Chateau
which was the entire reason he was jailed under the ocean
since it was considered a relic
it's entirely possible it was retrieved and stored somewhere
but we don't know if the arm died with him
well, Ver might have died
if it remained at all
out of all the things, that's the only way it might make a comeback
the only piece of it that remained was on ver's arm
the rest of frontier fused with the nephilim and then exploded
Not like there's anything other than preview pics
You can still talk with us until it airs
I mean the episode isn't out yet
Still house arrest for using it?
I wonder what'd happen if they still had the restrictions when they're on the moon
She played SONG like a fiddle
I dare say that Carol's plan was pretty genius from beginning to end
I wonder if Noise can destroy each other
well, Noble Red have their own Noise
the curse of balal was making everyone dumber of course
Fudou himself was kinda like Adam, only not as egregious
The power gap this time was filled by Noble Red having both the support of Fudou and being somewhat pragmatic in their actions
I dare say right now it's doing fairly alright in that regard
I tend to not like dmjii songs so color me surprised that I liked it
Didnt expect that
Shirabe's b-side is pretty good
Wow okay
Now that's even more ominous
Oh geez
and well, the preview pics
The Shemha one is pretty ominous once again
https://symphogear-xv.com/next/XVnext11.php
both are out yeah
Shemha you kinky fuck

the beginning of the end right now
fucking hell
lol
two episodes left
yeah, Apple's significance is still unknown
WHAT AN EPISODE
HOLY POTATOES
what refererences did we get this time?
melua
BITCH GET YOUR HANDS OFF IMMA SHANK YOU
literally hacked herself into mankind's dna
tfw she can hijack anyone she wants so long as they're free of the curse
connecting this whole thing to Fine
finding out apple's significance
we're left with vanessa, a hibichris unison
millaarc is... tiny
she's out of the game
elza can't fight anymore
this is some weird instrumentality going on right about now

tfw Shemha was the doctor
but I like it
I don't even know what we are right now

what can hibiki possibly do
i'm dying to know how miku will be saved now
it's just some alien energy
so divine power isn't actually divine
therefore they may come back
that means that they're possibly still alive
i can't believe the custodians were aliens all along
and saving miku
I don't think Miku signed up for this
so many demon pillars
sealed in the coffin
oh right
tfw Fine would have doomed humanity had she succeeded
where does she fit into this equation
But I'm annoyed her relevance still hasn't been explained
Fine definitely copied the idea from her
ah that lol
I don't remember Chris doing that
wait what
love love tenkyoken onegaishimasu
OHHHHH SHIT
OH SHIT SHE DID
explain
nani
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noriko_Hidaka
Noriko Hidaka
aka future Trunks
Takeshi Kusao
Maria is literally the most important person right now
tfw the Gears pretty much got full control of the ruins right now
ohh right she slipped
basa successfully blocked the suffering
yet in this episode
spoopy
inb4 jesus was an alien
if they're divine at all
this is somewhat romantic
he has the hair
enki is such a mecha protagonist
as logical as alien science can be
"logical"
symphogear is truly a melting pot of VAs
takeshi kusao
you already forgot cypher?
i felt like it was a fight scene from the later 90s
these two veteran VAs combined took me back
god that scene of Enki vs Shemha
in fact, I may very well be Shemha right now
it's been talking since episode 8
of course my shemha fetish is talking
I swear Yuka's shemha voice gets deeper every episode
ptsd version yeah
I'm expecting to be punched in the face
every time lasting song comes up in a new ep
I still see it in my dreams
but she did in her appearance
she didn't in this ep
but looks like she was mistaken
shemha *thought* maria was a descendent of enki
her gear connected to the ai in the ruins
nah, it makes sense now
hey there chossei
better pairs + not too episodic
the whole unison thing
at least this time they're doing it better than AXZ did it
but next ep is hibichris unison
truly the greatest mom
wait naoto what are we looking at
in fact, it was very much good
it wasn't evil in the original
poor Yggdrasill

Maria is a slav with a relic from Ireland that is actually the arm of a sumerian god with an amalgam in the form of a chinese dragon
1 frame
yeah it's like
it's the same
because she isn't smart enough to understand it
the most egregious scene though was Shirabe practically telling her to shut up and let the adults talk
I feel like they're making her dumb on purpose
I'm kinda mad they make kirika just comedy
honestly
does it count as a unison if she's not singing and her partner is just a red version of herself lol
momria with the airgetwrap and airgetswat
causing all the air to leave the building and kill them all
inb4 bikki punched a hole in the wall of the ruins
chris hasn't had her amalgam yet after all
a bikkichris duet would be fire
I didn't like that tbh
now we're back to s1 callbacks
shemha plans done for good
boom
imagine if the vambrace was destroyed in ep 2
just jump ship whenever she wants
then what's stopping her from possessing bikki right now
how do you seal that in a brace under the ice
after dying she turned herself into words and implanted herself in the genes of humanity
It's a bit strange
what's the point of the vambrace
If shemha is sealed in the genes of humanity by the curse
There's something that went over my head for no reason and I think I need an explanation
THIS IS WHY COMMUNICATION IS IMPORTANT
just fucking talk to bikki
for the love of fucking god
Miku
"I mean he says if I become just like her, we'll be able to talk right? What could possibly go wrong?"
"I mean she says if I let her in, she'll help me talk with with Hibiki right? What could possibly go wrong?"
miku once again tad bit too naive and lets another person take control of her body
Battle shonen, but follows a mythologically accurate god that battles other mythologically accurate gods
Shemha was a big problem that needed to be solved, and that was the only solution he had
Yeah, but to be fair, he didn't have much of a choice
which is kind of ironic when you think about it
but yeah, it seems like that the events of Symphogear happened because of Fine misunderstanding what the curse is
although we still don't know for sure where Fine fits into everything
currently that seems to be the case yeah
not much of a fight
while Shem-Ha was basically the doctor
Enki looks like the type of guy who has a lot of fighting experience
which didn't help her much in the end
she just had a bunch of nifty tricks
it was obvious he was stronger than her
he kinda wiped the floor with her though
after all, both Trunks and Yukimura are very shonen protags
voice checks out
they should've ended the ep with a cliffhanger of the submarine exploding
and mad props to yuka for her deep voice
and Noriko just has that... i dunno what to call it, but sorta nostalgic voice and inflection that sits just right
what with having two veterans battling it out
the entire opening sequence kinda felt like a late 90s action anime
veteran VA as old as Kanade's VA
Noriko Hidaka
both in her original form and in miku
I do have to especially emphasize her voice
everything about her
Shemha is rapidly becoming my favorite symphogear villain
i have to admit
i doubt they'll be able to answer all of our questions
tfw Nuada just replaced his missing arm with this one
naturally, blowing up the moon would get rid of the ruins
she wanted to eliminate the curse
I think that was the goal from the get go
COULD SURE USE SOME OF THAT IN THE SHOW EH?
COMMUNICATION
WOULD YOU LOOK AT THAT
```In feng shui practice, pairing the symbols of the dragon and the phoenix together is a common means of keeping (and attracting) the energy of harmonious communication. ```
from another page:
Maria this entire season has been taking the memes about her and punching them in the face
Maria and Basa vs Millaarc
Hibiki and Chris vs robots
Enki vs Shemha
I predict
give them a bit
https://i.4cdn.org/a/1568494595352.webm
THIS IS WHY YOU READ THE USER AGREEMENT MIKU!
Obvious
Yep
you'd be hard pressed to guess it's the same VA
in the scene where shemha and miku talk
worst case scenario we don't even get an epilogue
original content just for it
Fate UBW also did great with an epilogue
having the final episode be both the last part of the final battle + epilogue
kinda sad that anime usually does it like that
I'd be very surprised if the Chris episode doesn't feature Fine in some way
and they still need to tell us how Fine is relevant
the significance of Apple still hasn't been explained
<:MariaConfident:336657338729627658>
Ep 11 will forever be remembered as the ep Maria kicked the memers to the curb
Maria's forehead flicks can defeat Jiren
2 episodes
but i can't stand the protagonist
God, I heard Ryuki was a good season
I KNOW RIGHT
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRmMb84bGvg
the problem in that theory is then why would Enki apologize to her
same way Fine implanted her genes into her descendants, I suppose
wanted power and authority sure, but why
oh and we forgot we also need an explanation as to why Shemha rebelled in the first place
I mean Shemha was literally the doctor of the group according to Enki's words
Enki wiped the floor with her
I think Shemha isn't that great of a fighter anyway
it's not going to be coming back imo
I think we can say goodbye to the dress now
no idea what to expect
donut explosion

normally I'd agree with you, buuuuuut
Gear will have a happy end
Keywords are ominous on purpose
Preview images lie
So repeat after me
don't be cryptic
???
what do you mean/
see? What did I tell you?
Oh, so you saw the ep dino
didn't know what Nuba was though
yeah I know of him
ah lol
Nuba?
they fucking deserve a nobel prize
WHO MADE IT
who made this list
MILLAARC ELEFANTE I FUCKING DIED
Miku Hypothetical
"El Sombrero"
fucking lol
tfw the only part of the x drive that's different is the part no one can see
how could he close his hand if it was turning into silver
when it fell to the ground, it was slightly closed
when enki's hand was being silvered, it was open
omega nitpick moment:
nvm
my bad
oh wait
define everyone
if she's a trojan horse
you just need a good antivirus
she*
she clearly hasn't met hibiki yet
earth was like a test playground for them
if we build upon what enki said
they aren't necessarily good
a hat is a pretty unique fighting style
that voice is like a queen!
Noriko Shemha is fire!
whaaaaaat
Shemha *is* pretty sexy
can pass on the epilogue though
i just want a lagann-hen style final battle
i mean we could still get hibiki b-side there
next ep is a hibiki chris unison probably
Images you can hear
the rany sort of water bottle
although it's more like tinier version of themselves
you asked and you shall recieve
immortality isn't what it's all made out to be
You also wanna get turned into a mineral statue and float through the coldness of space for the rest of eternity?
Look what happened to him
So could Kars
and if not that, Miku will shank you
You get anywhere near their home and Bikki will punch you to the stratosphere
i don't think they'll need help
you dare try and invade the hibimiku home?
you can buy yourself a garden gnome in home depot
if it's gonna be any garden, it's gonna be hibimiku's
tfw Shemha will reincarnate as sunshine spawn

Not all of it, but quite a bit
More likely Chris will be the focus
And her entire desire to erase the curse was a misunderstanding on her part as to what it actually does
Enki was the god Fine loved
From what I gathered
Fine parallels all over the place
I know, I never heard of that either before today
orcadian mythology
the actual sort of peace or the "I just took over the galactic republic" peace?
is being thirsty for a wholesome and comf family life the same?
I cant believe I didnt notice this Shining Finger reference
Too bad Basa didnt mention a bed
Got connections with literally everybody
SONG joins Raynor's Raiders of course
Either very well or very badly
I wonder how Gears would fare in that universe
~~Now I wanna see Queen of Blades Miku/Hibiki~~
And didnt make a hyper parasitic race that obtained an ultra powerful leader
At least this time the rebel didnt kill all of them
WAGA NA WA SHEM-HA
And well, human consciousness isnt a telepathic ability
AMON
So Gear is just alternate universe WA
amen to that
hahahahahaha
aaah okay
wait what
10th song is for XDU, not Xv
it's not mutually exclusive
love interest can still fight though
Akifumi Kaneko
Prime Hibiki
Shemha just licked
She bit the ear
Fine was kinkier though
<:GarieWink:336657101273169921>
Clearly thats a hint
Maria and Basa screamed Ignition
except she's eleven billion times smarter than he is
I'd have surrendered immediately
and I saw chris coming at me screaming PUT YO HANDS UP
if I was shemha
it was yeah
no one else
the stone was connected to the alchemists
it wouldn't
but for the others it'd have been stupid
it made sense for hibiki
it was cool af to have the duet, but it was obvious it wouldn't be returning
and that one time it happened was just as fanservice
i mean you can't really refer to it as plural because it's only happened once and never again
Maou Nobu is my only goddess
~~except actually good~~
it'd be like AKB48
a song with every female character that there's ever been in the show
actually
they can too
SG did it
have kanade and serena appear as ghosts
easy
9 gear group song plz
and Hibiki will be like "okay sure"
Shemha is like "TEACH ME HOW TO HUMAN"
Show Shemha around
To get her back, Hibiki has to do the most difficult thing she has ever done in her life:
shinai where somehow part of Shemha's consciousness remained in Miku and awakens one day
when you can just grab the bluray edition just as easily
why watch the broadcast version
basically
yeah, let's move over
at least give him the new version!
if we're lucky, we get something like nanoha
but will never be explicit
it can skirt the line as close as possible
the yuri is not going to get confirmed no matter what we want
literal*
<#336298054724485131>
that is, of course, if the moon actually survives that long
that is so disgustingly fitting
i'm sorry what
we still have no idea how it relates to Shemha
yeah
look at him show off that protagonist charm

if I was Fine
I'd still hit it
he's hot
Look at Enki
Fine has good taste
I mean, let's be real fellas
he's just an ultra nationalist and traditionalist
that's be too fucked up
nah
Shemha used it to rebuild herself
she has potential to be one, but isn't just yet
too bad she was a yandere
Fine got exquisite taste
nobody, that's exactly the thing
So guesses are Hibichris, NR, Shemha/Miku, Group ending
we can infer one of the new songs is a hibichris duet
Chris gets an amalgam 100%
it's still 6 songs that we need to hear
if we take the group ending song out of the equation
Who the hell knows what they're planning
*and* aufwachen metanoia
and this is *without* taking kimi dake ni into consideration
another is possibly a hibichris duet
one is most likely group ending song
so this is gonna be a doozy
it's possible there are 4 new songs that have yet to be revealed
just so you know
well we already know they're going to use Daedalus End to teleport the gears to earth
tomorrow we say tomorrow for preview images
is because that huge collar is pushing it up
no you see, the reason her hair is like that
and everyone else
and me
that actually you
not glutton kuudere
rip fanart personality
We are all Shemha
It's okay folks
therefore, it's the only possible ship
since everyone is Shemha
ShemhaXShemha
There's actually only one ship in existence
inb4 we get "End of Symphogear" movie
but you can guess it based on interactions
you never see anything explicit happen on screen
it's the nanoha deal all over again
Tumbling down tumbling down tumbling dooooown...
It's a reference to something you dont know Armados
<@297542051057238017>
Hibiki sacrifices herself by staying on the moon and singing forever to keep the curse in place
~~did it already~~
Tsubasa goes ham and slices and dices her to pieces
especially the fight with Fine
the manga is actually pretty lit
No plz
But other than that, nothing
Realistically, I can see his arm come up and be used
Theres simply no time
A single line mentioning him is the most he can get
Not even as a flashback
There's no place for him anymore
But for every person, some are more equal than others
The girls are equal
"Hello ladies. Look at your man, now back to me, now back at your man, now back to me. Sadly, he isn't me."
i feel like that flick hand is exploitable as hell. exchange basa being hit with something else
when she's not being clumsy
that queen diva energy is too strong
but that's what imo is the general division
yeah I mean there's often an overlap between them
tsubasa, maria, and kanade have the beautiful factor
hibiki, chris, serena, shirabe, miku, and kirika have the cute factor
she's so gorgeous she'd make people swoon just by walking down the street
Maria is the best looking of the wielders
but honestly
rare higurashi meme
instrumentality shit right here
kimi dake ni is a blessed song
If popularity in any way correlated to quality
That is some power that Dragon Ball has that no other anime has
A crowd nearly the size of a city gathered together to watch it
And yet
Everything that is wrong with shonen
Jiren was just a ridiculously bad idea lol
Power levels are worthless after all
Dragon Ball's fights havent changed a bit since the 90s
Illegal streaming approved by the government that was shown to thousands of people
Never forget all of latin america coming together to watch the climax
~~and thanks to XDU we kinda already have a bunch of universes lel~~
Im sure she can beat Jiren that way
Why just have Ultimate Battle play in the background when you can have Hibiki sing it
The monster was the friends we made along the way
SUPER SENKI ZESSHOU SYMPHOGEAR
and *then* we get our lagann-hen ending
Concept art of Kyogre Noise
https://twitter.com/SYMPHOGEAR/status/1174625574658035713?s=09
you stole my thunder!
oi!
do you like to read?
well if you want some bikki drama...
Even something like wanting to remake the universe in their own image is just a fancy way to take over the world
Anything less doesnt sound as menacing or dangerous
I mean most villain motivations in anime are just take over the world under a different name
Aaand Adam
And Carol
And Ver
Like Fine did
In the movie of course
HaShem
Like an entire annunaki fleet that would glass the planet like they're the protoss
Shemha isnt very different
All the villains wanted to and had the capacity to destroy the world
Symphogear's escalation remained somewhat...even? I'd say over the seasons
It's called giving examples
We're talking about escalation as a concept, not about specific spoilers for series
After that, it lost itself completely
Sadly enough, Dragon Ball used to have somewhat good escalation up until Frieza
It became so ungrounded it completely stopped having ground at all
Gurren Lagann embraced it to the max
How is wanting to increase the stakes and the danger over time a bad thing
Which is like uhhhhh
It can get so bad that people praise to the heavens series that claim to not have any escalation
A sort of pet peeve of mine recently is how people sorta see the concept of escalation as inherently bad
But in any case
Maybe that'd have made it better
Sengoku Basara should've stuck a little more closely to history
And even then, XDrive on its own isnt all that impressive anymore
Symphogear also has those arbitrary number of locks required for XDrive
Because it's cost effective and easier to make after all
Of course, those numbers need to mean something
You can actually wrap your head around it
So when you give it something concrete like numbers
Well, strength on its own is hard to visualize
Symphogear would need to stop being Symphogear to even try to reach the top charts
DB would undoubtedly be considered the godking of anime
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/431914167826382860/618031755550654505/tsubasa_suffering_collection.jpg
So maybe Marvel
Isnt that a spider on her forehead
Oh wait
Looks like either Kamen Rider or wrestling
Mostly cos Adam turned out to be a prick
cantonese actually
because of the one (absolutely hilarious) time it was brought up and it was getting destroyed by everyone
I've actually been banned from doing so
||also the people he resurrects become ultra horny for him the moment they wake up. I swear, this fact is not made up. this is real||
you'll find something
or wattpad
just scour ffnet deep enough
~~that actually already exists I swear I didn't make it up~~
secret unknown ***MALE*** childhood friend she made a marriage promise with as a child called Jin Ryuu Kazama Kazanari Bloodedge Zero who's part Noise part Custodian part Autoscorer part alchemist who actually lived for over 3000 years and he wields the Omega Destiny symphogear that allows him to resurrect the dead and oneshot everything
more like

PREVIEWS
ü§î
Serena event started in XDU
do you like to read
not knowing her lover died too
she was left behind without knowing it was for the good of humanity
i honestly feel bad for Fine now
thus separating him from his bae
but had to put the curse in place to stop shemha
in a nutshell, he gave humanity knowledge and stuff
rip
```The earth without Symphogear was restructured.```
google translate claims:
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
```„Ç∑„É≥„Éï„Ç©„ÇÆ„Ç¢Ë£ÖËÄÖ‰∏çÂú®„ÅÆÂú∞ÁêÉ„ÅØ„ÄÅ„Åù„ÅÆÂú®„ÇäÊñπ„ÇíÈÄ†„ÇäÊîπ„ÇÅ„Çâ„Çå„Å¶„ÅÑ„Åè„ÅÆ„Åß„ÅÇ„Å£„Åü„ÄÇ```
And that the curse of balal deprived them of the ability to communicate
Enki keyword confirms he was Fine's love interest
they have these little tidbits
if you inspect element on the images
vanessa
bikki boob grab
elsa
bikki mom and grandma
On yggdrasill image:
maybe Gear will be nice and have them be together somehow as AIs on the moon
and you take responsibility
you stay here
nah nah nah nah
how's it feel to be bondaged, shemha
we're owed that by now
i will die if we get a hibimiku unison
lagann-hen ending kthx
Just reiterating what the wiki says

Fine = Fiona
damn it
Not if I get it first Maya!
found Miku's 4kids name
moly's lol
new feature
preview images can't be trusted
well, remember folks
hover over the ep name
You never answered my question if you like to read
Btw joppy
I think the last time I was so invested in something was muvluv
Come join ah my goddess in the dead fanbase corner
MEME MAN FUNNY
Yeah the old one was destroyed when kadingir rose
Lagann-hen final battle style?
At least we got takeshi kusao and noriko
Just had like 2 lines
Make them active helpers
Basically, dont make the others spectators
Last ep the millaarc pic shook
It supposedly represents the crux of the ep
Every episode has it
Yeah
Superb Song of the Valkyries
Tomorrow gon' be lit
Imma wait for XV to end and then decide
Ep 13 is actually a 3 hour endgame movie
Shemha thanos snaps the gears out of existence
Inb4 miku's body really is destroyed but luckily her soul is still in the vambrace which does survive so she's given an autoscorer body
And unlike him, she wont mineralize herself for eternity
Fine: DOKI DOKI
Enki: DOKI DOKI
Shemha: da fak
you watch the episodes with no audio?
wait what
this exact thing
we have that already tho lol
HOLY SHIT
HOLY FUCCCCK
HOLY FUCCCCK
HOLY FUCCCCK


APPLE FUCKED EVERYONE OVER
next ep is gonna be so fucking loaded holy hell
kirika has a scythe in her hair lol
we knew she wouldn't win though
serena doomed us all
how was ver the catalyst?
not necessarily in that order
they have 24 minutes to at the very least do the hibimiku thing, beat shemha, and epilogue
no idea how they'll finish off the season
im disappointed no hibichris duet
she wants to kill the other custodians doesn't she
at least we got bikki rage face
~~miku star missing~~
i'm digging the shiny hair so hard

You wanted a Kiseki?!?! (TL note: Kiseki means Miracle)
it goes like this:
nah nah melua
not happening unfortunately
>deletes herself to unsee it
>shemha finds porn of her on the internet
less an actual person and more a malignant program
the villain was also kinda like shemha
and then was deleted when they passed a magnet over it
a villain got defeated by being placed in a floppy disk
in oh my goddess
I've seen that somewhere before ü§î
hibiki's good nature worked against her oof

if not, it'll be the ending theme
I can't believe Serena fucked us over
SUPASAIYANJIN
i can't believe Apple fucked us over
leave it to melua to know
so that's what she was!
if only Gear had more episodes each season
heck, the xd quest made her the most important combatant
welp, xdu ruined that sentiment
re: miku not on frontlines
Fine went from generic villain to tragic figure
you'd expect shemha to be able to blitz through the firewalls like they're made of paper
this is humanity vs god right here
that's terrible!
maria stole 40 CAKES?!
~~Her real name was Miyu Sakatsuki~~
i don't recall such a promise
that's their redemption arc
i don't think so? It might be just amalgam xdrive
visqi is gonna go to town on these designs
holy hell
if that hair can attack
nobody else got that kinda treatment
her hair is a scythe
matrix is horror? <:HibikiWhat:336656482907193344>
patience, young padawan
the whole point of it is to not know what it is after all
You should change it
Spoiler pfp
Ajimu
i can't believe noble red were arash all along
fucking lol
it also won't actually happen
pffft, no
it felt like Carol's head was pasted on top of her
god that was so weird
she even turned into her for a moment
is that like blue waffle but a bird?
you dug your own grave this time kerrik
that does not look in any shape or form good
also that looks painful
goddammit
I wonder *why* this happened at all
kirika takes the cake so far imo
super saiyan
madbikki
she pissed now
Hibiki had to kill
poo
oh you already found it
never forgive millaarc

the smartest clan of the time, I tell you
>disappeared during Sekigahara
more like kanade's harem
everybody is shipped with everybody else in xdu though
we just had that with vanessa
no we dont
and serena
and kanade
wow, I wish
seven
there're seven lights in the ED, but not on the poster
aren't parallels fun?
Which is what this sort of protagonist tends to be
She seems more akin to a messiah than a demigod
this is about as strange as hearing about people who speedwatch anime on 2x speed
but if you mute the sound, then all you get are images?
it's like watching an idol anime and muting it
what's the point even
>anime 90% based on music
>mute the audio and can't hear the music
Chance to apply instakill
Overcharge effect cypher
It's her armed gear that gives her the true anti divine
Yeah
Wasnt kanade said to be really strong?
popsicle gears
lagann-hen final battle
that was your first mistake
>wiki
you can kinda see it on her back
it's funny cos they didn't forget the feedback system
No vambrace on shemha
just noticed their oopsie here
<#336298054724485131>
there were times they just took Yamete tomete's TLs without crediting, for one
all of the former are a direct result of the latter, unfortunately
<@354402389282783235> the wiki makes up facts with headcanon, have insanely terrible song tls, leave articles unfinished, and overall have a very toxic community
i'll leave that for XDU
as much as I'd love a hibimiku song, it's not going to happen in XV
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
~~maria's boobs sag, her face gets wrinkled, and she lives as a lonely crazy cat lady for the rest of her life~~
inb4 shirabe becomes taller than everyone else
10 years later epilogue
wow, that'd be a twist
we have one episode left and an entire boss fight to go through
we can only hope it doesn't completely crash at the end
honestly, at this point
such a gigantic cliffhanger, only for it to be solved in ten minutes in the next ep
I'm still mad over the godzilla bikki thing in AXZ
it almost never pans out
as usual, symphogear has big problems with consequence
always fumbling right at the end
true symphogear fashion
all it really did was let them communicate with the ruins and give them background on shemha... and then the ruins were destroyed
the thing with Airgetlam, in true symphogear fashion, had a meager payoff
a representation of the old civilization
I think it's just imagery at this point
Apple fucked us over
Shiny hair maria
Hit by SSJ laser and purged
You know, I think Shemha will be defeated with a callback to G again
~~i'm the only serious character in this show. that's the joke~~
final offer
truman show plot
so they're all lab rats
we did discover that all of earth was basically an experiment by the custodians
i mean
Hibiki is the only unsuspecting actor!
Symphogear was a Truman show this whole time!
the former theory I've seen applied semi-seriously to the Pokemon anime, and the latter I've seen applied somewhat seriously to Batman
~~that's okay, Gear is inconsequential as it is~~
with the biggest enemy usually meaning the doctor who tries hardest to cure them
and each person represents some sort of person in the hospital there
one of my favorite mad theories is that entire plots are imagined by the MC who's in a psycho ward
and that every person represents a repressed emotion or some shit like that
well, we already know all of Symphogear is just a coma dream of Hibiki's
Maria is the lightweight
Shirabe shockingly can drink a tankard and not feel it
Kirika somehow becomes philosophical
Tsubasa falls asleep standing up
Chris gets very dere
Hibiki is just violently chattery
But this time, with the other wielders included
Even if it's a lot more subdued
I suppose that even though Hibiki's songs arent as blatant as Miku's, Id like to believe that she still feels similarly
But they'd know about Unlimited Beat because XDU shilling in the anime <:TonyEyeRoll:580561912513691679>
Yeah that's what I heard too
On the other side, some people have equally strange reasons for liking stuff too
me kan haz gud greemeer two.!
That is one hell of a logic leap to make
Lol what
Why not?
Logic error shemha
üí•
Hello mine turtle
~~fuel for the het fanfics amirite~~
Probably a clan of nothing but ikemen
Literally Dante
Look what they produced
Ogawa clan, the only clan with half a brain to not get deleted in the sengoku era
I honestly thought for a second he was gonna fight shemha
Goddamn
With a red overcoat and a sword planted in the ground
Edgy character out of nowhere
Dante Ogawa lol
Couldnt resist the protag energy
Is Miku and Hibiki punching Shemha simultaneously. Miku from the inside and Hibiki from the outside
A little scene that could be fun
It's Miku singing it from inside Shemha
Inb4 it's somethinf convoluted like
*that* Serena
Ah yes
None can stand before the edgy power of the ultimate lifeform OC of edgy and destruction!
Break their bonds!
Bend their sexual orientation to your will!
Instantly become their sweetheart even though they're gay!
Go forth and conquer the hearts of the Gear girls!
You're now ready
Because it works
See, raiden is on the right path
Draw the most ominous sounding names you can imagine!
Reach deeper into your inner edge!
You're thinking too small Saki!
A very edgy ability in on itself!
So edgy in fact that their mere presence cuts thing
There are no limits
With an equally edgy name
As edgy as you can possibly go
Your prayers have been realized
Your wishes have been answered
As well as part noise and part custodian
Why not have him be both
In fact
Thats fine too
Go forth in your quest for Gear harem!
Legally allowing you to have assorted ninja abilities
You can now self insert as an unknown Ogawa brother
Yorokobe everyone
Then who's jack
Yes you were
No, Miku is not going to become the captain of the flying dutchman
How ironic
How very edgy <:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>

lagann-hen final battle? I'm fucking in
which has some possessive connotations
the closest we have is the phrasing on Waikyou Shenshoujing
unless you want to capitalize on her being yandere or something
she has literally 0 reason to
well then, there's another reason why Miku can't really turn antagonistic of her own volition
And Miku is like "Okay yeah but that was like‚Äî!"
Shemha is like "Who's the one who wanted to communicate?"
when they talk in the mental space
Episode 11 I think it was
at this point we're used to it
you make weird comparisons all the time
"Absolutely, trust me."
"Really? 100%?"
"So that thing you wanna do? Easy. Just give me your body and I'll do it."
It more looks like that Shemha tricked her
You can only nudge a character to the dark side if they have a noticeable dark side to exploit
Miku doesn't have any real reason to turn antagonist of her own volition
it's the only way I can realistically think of that doesn't involve injuring miku in the process
purged by SSJ laser
my current theory is that she'll be defeated in a G callback
got to <#336297840529899522>
dino, xv discussion isnt the place to discuss your life issues
~~tfw did evilHibiki already and that was easier to justify~~
what if I have a fetish for generalities?
I am happy about that
I did not expect to see Metal Gear Rising today
gotta put the "fun" in "funeral"
the shinais will probably feature some funky shemha shenanigans
experience human life
and her dastardly evil plan to...
a short one shot involving Shemha
I know what I'm gonna write after XV
not clenched!
quenched! <:CarolYandere:424047704826707980>
although we've already self inserted
Dante Ogawa
the backline still stuck with ancient m16s
although only the combat units get the nice stuff
said to the guy carrying it that it's cool

negev is where it's at
who'd have a fetish for that useless scrap of plastic

They literally say the name at least 5 times this season lol
Unless they actually want to crash the ending
They wont
Careful you dont get spoiles by discussion here
all of us
but you don't know that
theorized what?
it'd kinda suck it it is because all of hibiki's b-sides have been used in the show
they dont have time
it wont
she used it to rebuild herself from fragments
Serena didnt have one at all
Kanade had only one
Never seen in the anime itself
Bd extra for G
Ah, this one
Fudou said it when he explained to tsubasa what was up
Just in the latest episode Carol said it
clearly, the only event that'll get animated is the wedding one <:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
lots of girls nobody translated
lol you need to be specific
ahhh wait, you also need the collaborator events
that's currently the "canon" of xdu
and then triple gungnir
then xd quest
kanade, miku, and serena events are necessary for the xd quest
for all we know it'll fart some world reset kind of plot where they all become strangers or some shit like that
it wouldn't do for canon to fuck us over
yeah we need to see how XV ends first before we can cook up coherent ideas
you should probably take it to fancontent lol
a much expanded one
it replaces the canon ending for AXZ and goes for a different route
ye
tfw the only dmjii songs I like are XV b-sides
hibiki is the only one *guaranteed* to have her b-sides sung in the show
correction
hibiki is the only one who had her b-sides sung in the show
It's all the sads
Not for you rany
Gotta earn your happy ending
On the other hand, the west is also contradictory. They decry sex and are terrified by nipples, and also heavily criticize artistic violence in entertainment media. Yet, they have no problems showing criminals on the run on the news and even talk about killings, death, massacres, and serial killers.
Naturally, the latter is more powerful
Yeah but reading it in a fanfic and seeing it canon on screen is different
It was more a self sacrifice on Carol's part
It doesnt cos it wasnt romantic in any manner
Tsubasa lost a lot of things
I mean her b-side is about her now dead dad
Her b-side sounds completely different
The second verse I believe
It was her A-side
When?
?!
Satelight wont do it
Hoping for it is pointless
It wont happen
Germain appearing behind Hibiki and singing a duet is another
Amalgam itself is one thing
But she had her time as a character
That she was
Purely there because of the live
Germain was fanservice
Lagann-hen final battle kthx
It's not me this time Melua! Im innocent!
But Miku herself is just as bad
Miku says Hibiki is terrible at communicating
In the self insert world <:Ver:336656981144109066>
Damn
Millaarc was just a plot device for Basa's arc
Hot take
they're ominous, yes, but not bullshit
noble red, probably before and after shemha powerup
fudou
gear shemha
dress shemha
all 6 amalgams
probably the 5 x drives in ep 8
all 6 x drive amalgams
In XDU we're definitely gonna get
but first carol herself has to be released heh
yeah, probably in xdu
not so much a leak as it was a reveal
Geajin?
Mageass
<:HibikiShock:336656371611074580>
Yeah, at least it's not CR
yeah they did
WHY U NO WATCH YAMETE TOMETE SUBS
REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
>subs by commie
and then carol
some x drive autoscorer versions
their weak xv versions
their full power versions
they'll be released before carol too
oh but we also forgot autoscorers
all of these before carol
oh yeah, and how can we forget real Shemha and Enki
As in, killing Miku so Hibiki doesn't have to
"Are you intending to shoulder the burden of killing a friend?"
it's something along the lines of
Gen's line was completely different
~~offer it up to the server~~
or children's lullabies
the best music to die to is classicalish music

1. no. betrayal is a symptom of sin, not a cause.
2. this has nothing to do with xv
which is?
shonens are as badly executed as isekai
hottake
which both gen and bikki could fit into
i'm appalled nobody mentioned fist of the north star
what are we talking about?
FUCKING TOLD YOU IT'D HAPPEN
I mean pop team epic had 4 main VAs every ep for shits and giggles
they pulled in sugita to for like 5 lines total in axz
I think we said that at this point it's just imagery and doesn't represent really anything concrete
kinda hoped Shemha would appear in the OP in some manner but oh well
technically they didn't since basa mentioned her several times
everything built up until now lead here
now it's the final battle and epilogue
yeah, we don't have anymore time for plot twists
we're gonna cry
oh god
it's gonna be one of the girls
it someone we know isn't it
those stony hands at the end are scary
Burning X-Drive

well, whoever those hands belong to
lel
it'll be Hibiki
but in the end
tfw we thought Shemha was gonna be the statue
tfw FREEDOM is the third god killer
hahahahahahahahahaha
this implies the Gears are gonna disappear
Burning X-Drive
Out of all the right answers, that one is the only wrong one
~~Greater Grail of course~~
ahhh, that
you mean the joined hands?
kimi dake ni this ep or riot
they probably thoguht I was responding to CIntai when I was just screaming at the pic
the name of the ep? no
KIMI DAKE NI PLEASE
we need wholesome
why lewd
like that one time in pokemon special
whose goal is to unstone her
with new characters
announced a sequel
BUT THEN
inb4 the show really does end with hibiki as a stone statue
MY LAGANN-HEN ENDING AWAITS
DO IT
YES
i just dug it up for relevance
that was from ep 8
can't even blame shemha
do you know how mad people can get when they lose their food
https://twitter.com/sento_san/status/1165604354318979073
of course she'll be angry
she lost two of her emergency bananas
they're gonna bring democracy to the custodians
they found out shemha has oil
freedom the fuck out of this god
gungnir, alchemy, and 'murica
it's the system america used to stop shemha's hacking
god, I won't forget how I watched HF 2 right before episode 8
not completely, but it was there
i mean the season has been pretty Heaven's Feel
having victories handed over to him because everyone else was made dumber than he was
more like
So in conclusion, phonic gain really wasn't a repurposed magic power/ki/whatever other quantitative power
gah, website is unresponsive
therefore the curse is gone
the ruins were destroyed
ohhh right
anyway, what were you saying Millhi?
and Ogawa keyword just gives some background on their family
Echelon tells us what the system that stopped Shemha's hacking is
America keyword states that now FREEDOM is the third godslayer
X-Drive keywords states the name of the form as "Burning X-Drive", implying it was a forced form and that the Gears might vanish afterwards
Alchemy keywords tells us how it managed to reach the level of god due to the seeking of perfection or something like that
in a nutshell
Although I think the server overloaded lol
it's the last one
Updated Keywords:

Cypher
and then went crazy when their endings were pretty much the same
and I mean like right before
Well, since this is the end of the show, maybe
L-like sisters, right?
Daaawww
Kimi dake ni
I like how we treat all of America as a character
If it wasnt Fudou, it would br America
Adam was Lordgenome all along
He did nothing wrong
Adam was right
Cos she didnt use it yet
Well we're finally gonna see what her not!Gear can do
Symphogears assemble
Eiai Promise is also context relevant to the event
Unlikely
We're very much hoping it'll appear
Bad guy that is virus-like gets trapped in a floppy and is then deleted with a magnet
I remember from Ah My Goddess
Seen that already
Thats the first 13 minutes
I want to believe

Tfw Shemha reborn as sunshine spawn
Ruling over a civilization of plastic penguins and rubber ducks
Tiny shemha with tiny penguin costume
Must be celebrating over the shiny hair

Proclaiming her superiority from atop a pineapple
Taking a bath in a teacup

Meanwhile, Miku is doing a test

"Hey remember that time you got possessed by a god and nearly destroyed the world?"
Everything fine and dandy
They go back to school

Coming to an anime channel near you
"I Am A God But I've Been Reborn As The Test Tube Child Of My Past Vessel And My Biggest Enemy?!?"
Could make a rad light novel
Izza qt

pussyfooting?!
but madoka is 100 times more popular than Gear
it's getting one, yes
that's not capitalism, that's just the definition of business
XDU is obviously going to continue because it makes money
because no one else does, right?
says who
that'd be terrible
no, not nice
Well, you only need to wait 2 hours after the episode airs to grab it from the torrent
and what connotation it has
I have no idea in what context one might use this word
you learn something new every day

the waiting was part of the experience!
chill
dino
considering the finality with which the team spoke
that's a physical impossibly right now
because well
nothing really
at this point, not doing that would be a surprise
it'd be way too easy for it to crash right at the end
i'd personally prepare for anything
[GRAND LAST BATTLE 1/1]
<@87512939107450880> ARE YOU READY
ver apologists smh
seriously
Ver memes aren't funny anymore guys
he's also irrelevant
they don't have time
showing him for even a minute will instantly make it worse
where exactly will they put him in the episode?
no they dont
it's pretty common for anime to do that
final episode
opening will be skipped of course
at least xdu has an alternate world Fine to make stuff
the show has 20 minutes left
I was prepared for that since season 1
Dante Ogawa will add you to his harem
technically the moon is not a world soo...
>Staff says it's the last episode
>Series itself says it's the last episode
>Voice actors saying it's the last episode
>Kaneko says it's the last episode
>Game says it's the last episode
Fans: "Guys I think we're gonna get another season!"
it's been a nice ride
so long symphogear
i thought that we're getting a new miku song
i'm so glad Miku got to participate in the end
but overall yes
not in every way
i'm satisfied
but we all know what they'll say
of course they'd leave it open
And then the tree
Fight the lostbelt king first
It ended like lostbelt 4
Lol cypher
yeah, it isn't a bad thing
and I kinda wish we knew if the gears were destroyed or not
shemha fight felt a little too short
so that's an okay compromise
but then she participated in 2 more
Ennui?
Shemha did the same here
Remember how Fine briefly used Ryoko's voice to distract Gen?
Pulling a Fine
Fucking Shemha playing dirty
Even if for a bit
We finally got to see Kanade and Serena again
Carol o7
Never heard of it tbh
Whoa
Yes
The credits didnt show a miku song
We got three new songs in return
Im alright without kimi dake ni
Well, hibimiku is canon fellas
Gear Miku
Gear shemha
Dress shemha
Oh hey Ikxi
Metanoia as an "attack" was eh
It is a new song?!?!?
Wait what
Zizzl
Time to play every ending theme I have on my phone
I know right?!?
They somehow mamaged to include Ver and not ruin everything
Carol o7
75% satisfied
I am like
so that's up to individual interpretation
they've left it a question whether or not the gears were destroyed
tfw no rany spirit appearing to Maria
rany plz
lol
it's just Kanade herself that doesn't look any different
They look new
that he got some new kanade frame
Kanadeanon will be glad

I like how Miku's version takes cues from the wedding gear lol
whatever version they give us?
we whaling for faust robe miku?
So millhi
must be a shemha only thing
hence it being what it is
yeah
Yeah that part wasn't necessary, but they did it anyway
that wasn't destroyed
it was the faust robe
it wasn't a gear
if the gears are gone, they're gone
nah, confirmed that only ryoko
por amor reversed lol
we knew they'd do that
as expected of course
it was burned away
did you forget?
because metanoia wasn't really an attack at all
because when was the last time symphogear had ever outright confirmed the yuri
3 new songs + apparently a secret miku one we didn't get to hear
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/407203682216706070/627641726206476301/1569706150859.png
final tier list
ty
anybody got the gaijin reaction?
the fucking mecha though lol
looks like processed coffee grains or whatever it is
lol what is that
if anything
ending with the highest grade of yuri tease
the very fact that we got this ambiguous ending is the best we can ask for
we never expected one
i was too busy fangirling about cute Fine
no sugita
>he had no lines
>sugita
oh shush you
Fine finally got to see him again <:HibikiHug:620080558462205956>
Fine x Enki ancient babylonian SoL kthx
even if a bit wobbly
it managed to land safely
the ending didn't crash
at the very least
i don't think so
she sacrificed herself
carol wasn't killed
don't see why not
~~this is our victory!~~
~~take that, waifuers!~~
Symphogear stuck true to its guns to the very end
to let people catch up
one month after xv ends she said
we don't have to be anal about spoilers now
Gear saturdays will become FGO saturdays
at least now
that's honestly a point for them
and yet they didn't fuck it up
really really easy
it could've been so easy for them to fuck it up
dude
oh god they forgot about chris's parents
don't tell me they forgot about them
hahahaha
oh shit they really didn't lol
you know what to do
so lily
you're gonna need to elaborate on weird
cos the ones with the previews refer to the previous episode
post-season
ep 13 keywords
do we expect more keywords? ü§î
she's the only one in that scene without a loved one
it's more like she acknowledged their conviction
not really
"turns good"

YES SOLO
where have I seen that before...
>``I loved how hibiki changed her desire from helping others to wanting miku.
``
SSJ is the color of truth
it's okay
oh dang, Cypher you're SSJ now!
Serena was considered good?
kanadeverse, mikugear, uhh... XD quest? Triple Gungnir?
always
primordial connection to humanity
whether they broke or not
although the ultimate fate of the Gears is up in the air
for all of... 5 minutes, I suppose
i mean maria got over serena and she still appeared
but she a strong independent girl
chris is the designated forever alone
ever since they did the rumored staff switch
cute Fine was great
waso ranbu or whatever right?
guess I was wrong
that's what I heard at least
the little she had
I thought it butchered her character
it's as expected
but at least she's happy now <:MikuPraise:585839808765493249>
if only she knew
Who spiralled into insanity over a misunderstanding
Fine is a tragic figure
also Kanade used the zesshou wrong
that'd have crippled XV
it was good they didn't delve into them anymore
dmjii and chris didn't have anything left to explore
superhero just for one
we the shippers reign supreme
the waifuers have been defeated
as if Kaneko would reference anything not even somewhat mecha
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal_Hero_Series
provided by melua:
tfw it's not
Kokujou Tengen Myou!
it's another part of the open ending that's up to interpretation
possibly
Bla bla meme man funny bla bla yes yes
Grenadier yeah
at least now we know what her card in XDU will have
Like student like teacher
Thats all I recall
We had basa rage sword thing
Cos Kaneko loves making references
1984 series
Chris attack was based on Metal Hero
she did good
she got it throughout the season
I personally disagree on that Urobuchi part, but I can definitely see why someone would dislike his work. It's very nihilistic in nature and it's pretty obvious when he's the writer behind something
Edge McEdge
Special Ops Asuka too
That was just edge for the sake of edge
yeah some people are completely blind to subtext
what can you do
waifuers
trying to hold onto whatever they can find
we've already got people denying it all over the place
and leaves
one shots the villain
Suddenly Carol returns
all hopes seems lost
15 years into the future, we get Gear movie
Time will pass
one to one
even the "mou hitori no boku"
lol it did
just say it plainly
ahhh that
Miku wasn't there to help her during the period she was getting bullied
and we're not being jebaited by ost
i sure hope to god it's a new miku song
depending on your interpretation whether the gears were destroyed in the end or not
former is fusion dance and latter potara earrings <:GarieWink:336657101273169921>
Hibiku and Mibiki are their fusion forms <:ElfneinWeld:586027421296492585>
hibimiku
how much more marry can it get
well Miku wore a wedding dress
tfw basa now has two songs about people she lost <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
and *especially* basa's
especially bikki's
the b-sides this time are all very feels worthy
now as good time as any
that'd be a nice bonus to have, yeah
i thought you'd be the first!
you haven't heard kimi dake ni until now lily?!?
wait
this is the end
nope
I know on PC you can open their link and just dl them as an image
although it has lewd connotations now
fanservice is an umbrella term though
chalk it up to being used by a god
welp
which is odd because even the axz trio had convertor units
what do you have to gain from doing so
stop wanting to touch the wiki
what?
which I completely forgot about btw lol
jewish new year
every episode has multiple stock footages
you'll love precure
what taste do those have
elfnein likes nagashi somen
because you can't have a battle school anime without skimpy clothes
of course, everybody gets variations of the shemha dress
and he's a dude of course
but the MC is the only one in the world with a Symphogear
faust robe battle school
that's even better
no wait
he wants to engineer catgirls, I'm sure he can animate a fanfic or two
I mean I'm not sure how I can top literally Symphogear Heaven's Feel <:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
ü§î although that and XV can't possibly happen at the same time
~~that's okay, I already wrote a whole season for Gear ~~ <:GarieWink:336657101273169921>
the MC is the one dude in the entire world that can use a Gear
and of course
dystopia
bam
mass produced gears can actually be a cool concept
but then as they're released, you find out the last one was actually bad
naturally, the first in that list is gonna appear OP at first
dress? FR shemha? FR miku? just shemha?
I don't even know which Miku
she hugs the enemy and they explode?
how will they release metanoia as a card now
i'm still kinda confused how she purged shemha
tfw I'd like to have those harems back instead of isekai <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
sometimes
and it magically improves
is of course, to replace the MC with Shirou
Cypher, the best way to make these trash harems better
i don't think Gear will survive with a new cast
we didn't get noise since ep 10
jp fans probably understood it from season 1
tbf, that's only us western normies who didn't get it
they're not exactly subtle with it
and all that pizazz
and the desire to communicate
because language
and it fits
then they're doing a wordplay on Miku's name
if you ever hear the word "mirai"
in many of hibiki's songs
that's why
Êú™Êù•
her name is written with the same kanji as for "future"
yeah
and since future = miku
because everyone was screaming to take back the future
that both makes sense and is both complete bullshit at once!
oooooooh
oh
ryusei nakao can join in somehow too
naturally, they sing and do lives too
don't you want a gear that sounds like satoshi and one that sounds like goku?
have both these grandmas be new generation gears
you know what?
in fact
rica matsumoto
masako nozawa
naturally, Kawasumi is the saber colored Maria
There's your new cast
Rie Takahashi
Risa Taneda
Saori Hayami
Sakura Ayane
Ayako Kawasumi
Maaya Sakamoto
boom
she was also mina tepes
we're obligated to call it blessed too
great, so now every time we post a cursed image
not incest <:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
i think you meant insect, pat daddy
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
>incest pillar
plant a tree
dig them up
yeah sure let's just...
it came from the all-star cast
much of Gear's success and fame didn't come from it being a 'good' story
okay cypher
I can make a shitty copy of something from Fate VN


lel 3.5
that's 20 times the hit
oh damn
oooohhh
i'm not following anymore what
the ultimate reveal
that was the big surprise of the season
~~gohan and goten~~
what? Goku Black?
~~spoilers for xv~~ <:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
Yeah
HMMMMMMM
Hmmmmm
Gear x Tsukihime
ü§î
No problem
I like her a lot
Quite the opposite
Nothing
To arcueid too!
WEW
Change it
<@87512939107450880>
Spoiler pfp
Cypher
the normal ending must also be viewed
naturally, if we got the true ending

*"Edge, ON!"*
got something for you

on this pointless show
being wasted on such a pointless character
what a waste
ugh
ugh
tamaki is voiced by Aoi?!?!
don't cry because it's over smile because it happened and all that jazz
Did someone say?
if you don't want to sit through long, awkward minutes of loli fanservice
as such, for that, you might want to read the manga instead
which the anime increased
Prisma Illya does manage to retain the core of Fate, but it's also filled to the brim with loli fanservice
on the other, when it's bad, it's awful
On one hand, when it's good, it's very good
basically, if it's a Fate by ufotable, then it's worth watching
that's a good idea
the mainline is easier to follow
It just has a lot of spinoffs
gosick as victorique
dance in the vampire bund as mina tepes
hyakka ryouran samurai girls as yagyu jubei
let's see
||as tiamat||
technically she *is* in it
it's sealed
that's it
you said gen first
nope, too late for take backs
if you say ver I swear to god
let's get the XV live first
although the manga is nice
the anime is trash
carnival is very fun, but a full half of it is going to be completely unknown since Tsukihime got the short stick in terms of accessibility
wrong because he exaggerates the complexity
right because there is kind of a lot
that gigguk video is both right and wrong at once
too late
Gen was said first
Nope
big secret BD extended scene revealed
https://twitter.com/BIG_PIG_naonao/status/1178515078649303041?s=20
yep
i'll admit I forgot she did a haiku in s1
Well, topdad is basically shaggy
hibimiku naturally
and ogawa family spinoff happened in xdu
dr.ver wouldnt work unless they give him some Joker levels of backstory
or Fine origin story
a zwei wing prequel
either a post XV movie
this channel isn't your personal blog, dino
and this is related to xv... how?
all good things come to an end
rumors remained rumors it seems
the other characters didn't get lines either
maybe they just didn't need them
miku getting to participate in two new songs <:GenjuurouThumbsUp:336657189475188740>
you'll like what it has to offer
well, now's the time to listen to it akeupho

thank god they didn't

that'd have sucked if it did
at the very least it didn't completely crash

...
happy Fine was excellent civilization
Although I'd assume Kanade's was like a test while Maria's was the final result
I guess we'll never really know why
the live for this is gonna be so lit

making aoi and yuka kiss?
...how?
>show it at a live
but well, now it's just grasping for air
Until the finale, you had plausible deniability due to Hibiki herself not being very clear about it
Or they're terminally tone deaf
Or they're in denial/delusional
I'M SURE THE MOMENT NICEGUY-KUN COMES ALONG THEY'LL DRIFT APART
JUST PURE FRIENDS
THEY'RE JUST FRIENDS GUYS
Shemha assumed she was, but we don't know if she just misunderstood
mostly cos we were never given info on that
whether or not Maria is related to Enki is up for debate
it's just she can only manifest in one at a time
all FIS children are descendants of Fine
yes
Fine, duh
Ver got somewhere because everyone was terminally stupider than he was
look at all of G
of course they are
or she doesn't exist
I suppose in kanadeverse she didn't go?
that is even if they get ignite at all
but without 3 wielders, can they even beat Carol
since FIS won't really do anything while she's still alive, Carol will be the first to act
but then she stays on the moon, thus she can't keep these parties in check
Fine alone keeps all of these in check
or just keep Fine alive
but most just make them OP as shit
which *can* be an interesting premise
after the plot ends, catapult the MC into the beginning of the series with all the knowledge they gained
I've seen premises like that before in fanfics
symphogear was just hibiki's coma dream
nah, we're pokemon
I couldn't tell!
really?!?!?!
noooooooo
i'm gonna hold you to that
is what you keep saying, but you haven't really
but if you go to him thinking he's a reviewer, then he isn't
it is
he nitpicks things that aren't even nitpicks
he's literally paid to nitpick everything
you know cinemasins's sin counter is bullshit in on itself right?
"I wanted Symphogear to not be Symphogear therefore I'm now disappointed."
What I hear you saying is

few seconds later, not golden
and this is *before* Carol used gold transmutation
the horn is golden
This part right here

Holy crap I just noticed a *massive* mistake on their part
let me guess, most if not all are shonen, right/
not brand
they have VA name power
which was then repurposed for edgebikki figure
hibiki gx figure
never forget
do you even know what GSC is dino?
niceguy-kun
of course you did
and she doesn't want to do lives
You watched the most spoiler episode of the *second* season first?
otherwise you wouldn't bring it up
there is a reason
it shares some tune with eiai promise too
I hope we do
maybe
it was so on the nose it was annoying
and Shirabe pretty much tells her to "shut up, the adults are talking"
was when the takeover of SONG was being explained
honestly one of my least favorite parts of XV
neither is Kirika, even though the show wants to hammer in how stupid and immature she is
Hibiki isn't as much of an idiot as people make her out to be
same pose and all, except with the scarf and a new face
Ambiguous
*Yggdrasil
Naturally, she'd be strong enough to catapult herself to her destination
Remember that Miku's throws can break physics?
She threw herself
No wait
Genjuro threw her
<:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
*Continues crying to Kimi dake ni and Kaze no Anata ni*
she can fly
Sunade? ü§î
After the xd quest
She has yet to use it again though
Aka aegis
And even when Shemha used it, its anti-Gear function wasnt that immediately significant
And shemha herself barely used it
They had to get rid of it in one episode so it wouldnt trivialize future plotlines
SSJ is kind of a pitfall since they need to jump through hoops to make an enemy that isnt auto-killed by it
Basically, disallowed to be in most event stories unless she's directly featured
they're not official I think
asumin is a treasure
ngl, probably their best concert duet thus far
wouldn't it just be happy water bottle noises?
yeah, axz had ep 13 keywords
well, the thought process behind it is that every episode so far has had keywords
better not get the hopes up
a possibility, but not a certainty
you could write a fanfic about them existing in the same world, but otherwise, yeah no
also, shield was hydra in the end so no
too big
while letting everyone keep their jobs
worst case scenario, they restructure themselves into something different
there must be some alca noise crystals running around somewhere
SONG would probably still be around
she'd play horror games
what did I tell you about this channel not being your personal blog?
once you hear the good version, you'll notice
the rip
Meh, 6/10
And then you get donutted by a vamp
Masako Nozawa is 82 and still can scream like crazy as Goku

<:HibikiWow:614268629952757760>
the fate of the gears will remain ambiguous
welp, it didn't really tell us anything other than that so...
probably something with "neon" that ends with "evangelion"
yes
~~gj bots~~
Ill be damned
Well
Oh
I was actually looking for that on MAL and couldnt find it
But you're the one that asked it
What about him
What image
I want Fine/Enki prequel when she was still a fairly normal, easily embarrassed priestess
A very good looking boo too
Because she got to be with her boo again
Nah Fine was too busy being a qt
I liked the season where Judai and Hibiki had to use the Symphogear cards to beat Carubel
but not 100% a fan of the editing
not bad
so it wasn't even that bullshit
the absolute tiniest
the minimal amount of foreshadowing
it got like
yeah that was a complete holy shit moment
it is a special ability we have developed over eons
holy shit
more like lesbian sentai
because they're pushed beyond their expiry date
why do you think most shonen either don't end or end badly?
it happens to a lot of series
kinda like how all businesses operate
although it's going to need to have an exponential growth
as long as it makes money, they have no reason to stop even after that
aside from a somewhat feminine figure, we can't tell much about them

I really, *really* wouldn't read the wiki comments
someone already accused them of lesbian erasure
wiki comments also say that the couples in symphogear don't exist
wiki comments lol
someone else did it and uploaded it to soundcloud
tbf, kerrik didn't datamine it himself
this song is holy shit amazing
i was just wondering what the little letter beneath it says
nani nani
Cool I guess?

I suppose igalima and shul shagana existing in both verses is something
My Gear saturdays are now Babylonia saturdays <:Cag:423197445644615711>
they didn't really have one this season
in XV, you mean?
random petitions started in comment sections on youtube are not the first place I'd go in an attempt to have more of a thing
üí¢
*remembers yesterday*
the bastard
kaneko dodging the question huh
Why bother putting in the effort when you have low effort shit like this that makes it to the top
the thing is, it's a disheartening prospect
someone as bad as he is
on FFnet, self insert reigns supreme
the thing is, it won't really matter in the long run
to reiterate, another shit self insert story popped up, with the author saying some insanely pretentious things. I went off on him, prompting his co-writer to attempt to defend him with some ludicrous arguments, and then the author himself responded in his author's notes, understanding nothing
I mean, they're the same low effort shit anyway
different stories, Creme
Author was extremely pretentious so I dropped a harsh review that demonstrated just how bad it's gotten
Another shitty self insert fic popped up on ffnet that's bound to be successful cos that's the only thing people there seem to want to read
in a nutshell
somehow managing to make himself to look more like an idiot
because the writer then decide to write a "response" in his author's notes in the following chapter
It somehow got worse
Gear's fanfic section is cursed
after yesterday I've sworn off of writing anything else for Gear
aside from the events of my story making XV impossible
never
https://tenor.com/view/anime-symphogear-gif-15032069
all of which are spoilers lol
tfw discord's gif thing has gifs of XV already in it
if they're going to try and justify it with "MY FAMILY"
not happily indulging in massacre
they should've shown her showing more regret
buuuut they didnt
well, she could've been had they done it better
millaarc isn;t
yeah but sandman was successfully shown as sympathetic
never forget and never forgive

Kirika's should also be on bd1 no?
I can actually see the differences
wew
[ARMOR TIME]
~~life fibers~~
hibiki is the only one without prominent thigh highs
she only ever used the pistol
kinda missed her huge arsenal in xv
i'm sad she didn't use other weapons
Lasting Song PTSD version
I know right, Maya?
well, considering most downloads these days are digital
none, I think
and not pachinko
in any form that isn't a candy crush clone
hopefully
ps3 and ps vita
No sand on the death star after all
Anakin turned to the dark side because of sand
Even other sand
Everybody loses to sand
Then you should pick someone on the same level
In any case, if you're gonna do these deathbattle style comparisons
Infinite strength isnt very interesting
It's like having anything fight Saitama
People say DBZ has no power ceiling, but superhero comics are beyond even that
They can chain them together and drag them around the galaxy like they're supermarket carts
You're right
Didn't she like, benchpress a planet at some point
Yeah but Wonder Woman, like Superman, is as strong as the plot demands
parley?
...
no way I'm fighting a superpowered ultra lesbian with cosmic powers
In fact, I'd bow down and join her side
are you kidding?
just give her kryptonite though and she wins
geez whiz, I wonder who'd win
so a somewhat strong antagonist from an anime vs the literal definition of asspull powers?
you don't need so many
three dots are enough
bikki basa and chris at the most
and the fact that it remained up for so long
the fact that nobody stopped them
the fact that they could put that in the wikia
the fact that someone was somehow braindead enough to TL it like
there're like, 4 different thing wrong with that alone
it's a horribly butchered translation of Ame-no-Habakiri that stayed up on the wikia for *months*
seriously, the moment they farted the "Celestial Mudguards" out of nowhere, I knew it was a lost cause
and their made up interpretations
not the bullshit the wikia has
along with actually good song tls
thank god
a wiki that actually has accurate information and doesn't have comments
which YMTM are already doing
at this point it's faster to make a new wiki
no, there's no point in that
let me remind you that the wiki is frequented by people who actively deny the yuri exists in Gear
for the love of god even the comments there are full of shit
*still* using the wiki as a source for *anything*
are you
why
you want MTG as a symphogear power?
How are you not tired of memeing about Ver already
PUCHOHANZA
Well if they have headcannons, that is definitely beyond human
Blood of the sakimori or something or another
Meme strength, it seems like
No amount of amazing english voices will be able to make a dub good
Symphogear english dub is the worst idea ever
Tbh it's not Carol that warmed me up to her but Reines
Inorin is a qt
the weekly waits were excruciating
the hype destroyed us
It gets better Anand
This isnt xv
<:TsubasaYareYare:407397617451139073>
it also retained an excellent aerodynamic shape
do they not search the battlegrounds? seriously
somehow, SONG once again failed to find the obvious thing
did you listen to the b-sides?
hibiki's hesitation cost them
carol was especially crazy
we exploded over here from all the hype
did miku's catch you off guard?
what do you think of XV?
never heard your overall impression
so anand
and <:HibiMikuCry:586026583870013455>
kimi dake ni is just <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
well, now you can start on the fanfics ayyy <:ElfneinWeld:586027421296492585>
not X pose
It's called a T pose after all
Miku, Hibiki, and Shemha didn't
Chris did it right
tosses Miku over like a sack of potatoes and goes home to watch the new ep of Utazukin
how anti climactic would it be if that actually worked lol
some are worse than others
somehow, every comment section managed to be toxic or idiotic
I decided to take a look at their symphogear vids on youtube
I will reiterate that Crunchy was a mistake
then slowly turns to horror as they remember what happens in XV
See, it starts with bliss
>Little RL Miku is having the time of her life
>Meets a new friend
>Her name is Hibiki
Parents: <:HibikiShock:336656371611074580>
lol what
awwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww
I doubt it's the case, but with the amount of mecha references Kaneko made, I wouldn't be surprised if he did take the geass symbol as inspiration
shinais are supposed to be comedic no?
that's just evil
boom, that channel with the uploaded songs got crushed
yeah they're gonna get hit with the ban hammer

you mean 3
we have like 15 chrises in this server alone
so name them Snow Sound

or just adopt 7 cats and name them after the girls
can always ~~buy~~ I mean adopt
on the other, considering XV...
on one hand, it'd be cute if this Miku met a friend named Hibiki
who said it wasn't intentional
misspelling like that
silly ikxi
I think you meant the fist of the north star reference

HEAVEN'S FEEL DOUBLE FEATURE
lol, what were you told?
what do?
>tfw god is your girlfriend
this is supposed to be cute, but it feels cursed
also, according to keywords, it's called Burning X-Drive
which one of the new forms did you like the most?
[Miku will remember that]
but i forgot which one
Vanessa's weird form vs Hibiki and Chris is also one for Gundam
leave it to Kaneko to do references to shit before 1990
some 80s toku show called Metal Hero
this is the reference
combined aegis + xdrive in some ways
yeah, that's what we thought
ah ok
I recall someone who drew kanade amalgam but for the life of me i can't find it now
and we assume she'll have a new solo one as well
miku getting to participate in two new songs is nice though
~~should've been 9~~
melua knows all the references in the show
we saw both it and miku vanish in the leadup to shemha reveal
yeah that's what most likely happened
i'm starting to think kaneko didn't think that part all the way through
so what the hell is the dress
while wearing the faust robe
and you can't see if Miku in ep 13 still has the feedback system on
but the dress also had the feedback system on it so <:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
except the faust robe was in its sealed form so the dress appeared literally out of nowhere
cos she got absorbed, but when she appeared again she both had the vambrace on *and* the faust robe
it's a little weird on how it works
although she later just appeared in her normal body, albeit with a kinky dress on
and it absorbed miku and the brace into it
noble red did some ritual or something or another
i wonder, if Miku didn't let her in, would she still get possessed?
why does shemha actually need the vambrace to possess someone
this still confuses me to this day and I feel like an idiot for not understanding
brilliant
on what?
hibiki is ross
Miku was rachel all along
I can't believe symphogear was just ***F.R.I.E.N.D.S*** all along
the kind that makes you think it's a little bit supernatural in nature
pretty damn impressive gymnastics i'd have to say
the kind of ***FRIENDS*** not even god can break
they're the very best of ***FRIENDS***
well, hibiki and miku are still ***FRIENDS*** so all's good!
and the bad <:CarolYandere:424047704826707980>

o7
I'm the one telling the truth
Don't listen to the others
especially episode 2 is the fluffiest of them all
XV is actually the fluff season
dear archive viewers
Hibiki and Miku are just ***F.R.I.E.N.D.S***
remember, archive readers
draw dicks and nazi symbols on their white shirts for paleo?
not really comparable but okay
Metal Gear AXZ was fun
Isnt that just romantic
Tfw hibiki's final attack was a hug
XV was just heaven's feel all along
Also, HF double feature

But yeah, poor Maria
But Shirabe *is* the smart one of the group
Still, big oof moment for her
Ohhhh right
How the heck did Ver bitchslap Maria away when she's stronger than him in practically every regard

At least Shirabe had enough of a mind to nope out eventually

Well, read the whole thing. I'm not too big a fan of smut fics, but that was kinda cute
Sure am glad that wasn't the case eh?
I might have misread the first few lines and might have come to believe it was about Hibiki catching Genjuro sucking Miku's futa dick
phew
okay i read it wrong
oh
i'm sorry, i think i need to go get my bleach

I guess that's why you would go through this whole shady-looking business on a website that looks like it sells crack for bitcoins
ah I see, a sort of personal issue
so i guess i dont know the intricacies behind it
well, im not a girl i just have a thing that stiffens when i see boobies
isn't that the opposite of what you would generally want?
they all end with why?
i have several questions
*PITCHFORKS* WHO'S LEWDING THE PURE SUNSHINE?!?! *PITCHFORKS*
but then it devolved back to hentai shit
i thought it was suddenly getting good when it started getting a plot
More like "watched with a horrified expression"
Seen is sort of subjective here
Gay seal of approval
pics or it isnt
...is this porn?
as most things are
I guess it's enticing because it's considered taboo
I'm guilty of it in some other aspects in life as much as anyone
but that's not always possible
But of course, generalization is also something to be avoided
even if it's a bit optimistic
I'd give it the benefit of the doubt in that regard
We are actively disgusted by the idea of het pairings in it, and absolutely worship the lesbian undertones.
I mean, just look at symphogear.
The anime community is a bit weird in that regard, I think
In this way, the whole problem in America is not actually the guns themselves, but rather the easy access to them that allows all those mentally unwell people to get them easily.
Guns, like all other pieces of technology, are just tools. For example, a kitchen knife could be used to cut cake and be served at a birthday party, but it could also similarly be used as a murder weapon.
Of course, the whole purpose of guns is to kill, but if nobody is around to use them then they can't do it themselves.
Whenever something is made, for whatever reason, the creator has to be aware of the fact that not everyone in his target audience will be mentally sound. He can't do anything about it, but he can perhaps limit the amount of people it can get to.
In the end, the one that is pretty much 100% at fault is the consumer, sorry to say.
If someone is not mentally well enough to distinguish the difference between fantasy and reality, then they probably shouldn't be allowd near such media
I will go back to my saying that the reason some things are enticing is because they are taboo.
Incest and bestiality come to mind in that regard. Whether or not you find it disgusting is one thing, and whether or not it is illegal is another.
Things that are not taboo, like homosexuality, can't truly be put, in my opinion, in the same category.
But as you know, everybody's got their own fetishes and that is another completely different thing.
Games can also leave you with a powerful message, and books can also leave you wanting to come back for more.
In the end, the message depends on the medium it is presented on, which is why as we see in anime and video games, a lot is lost in adaptation because the end result doesn't fit the way the creators wanted the message to be delivered.
To give an example, FSN as a visual novel I believe is a literary masterpiece the likes of which many books I read only struggle to come close to.
FSN the anime is...passable fun, and that's because the core behind the series itself lies behind not its visuals, but what lies in the mind of the protagonist, which is something anime can't show very well due to its nature.
I disagree with that, Tenth
The environment I grew in made me cautious of certain groups regardless of the people within them
I can say this about myself, outside of anime/gaming
In the end, moderation and balance are what's really important. You cannot allow yourself to fall into one end of the spectrum too far, which is why I find slippery slope and or domino effects kind of iffy. 
...
...
Is what I would say, but history proved otherwise in cultivating mob mentality despite other people's better judgment.
E.G anti-vaccination
That's gotta count for something, right?
I mean, look at me. Straight white male writing a fanfiction about fictional ambiguously lesbian schoolgirls.
If there's an anime community I'd recommend to LGBT+ is Symphogear purely because of this lol
female doors specifically
DAMN DOORS
I CAN SCREAM AT IT ALL DAY AND IT WON'T RESPOND TO ME
IT'S A GODDAMN DOOR
what do I care what gender is the door?!?
how the heck am I supposed to know a door is default female?
So much that learning German is a hassle because I never know which object is actually 'female' or 'male' or 'neither'
in Europe most languages have clear distinction between female and male
especially the latin ones
Or are any other languages for that matter
I think the flaw lies in language itself more than anything
asking for forgiveness is easier than asking for permission
well, as they say
in Hebrew, neutral is basically referring to someone as a 'this'
I get you, Rukia
As are many other languages
My own habit comes from the fact that Hebrew is a very divided language and that everything is designated into female, male, and neutral
I'd expect people to default to whatever the person looks like to them
Oh boy I have a story about this myself
about time
wut
Dicks are indeed ugly
How far into Valhalla do you want to get?
that we can all agree on yes
just go back to bionicles
and unless I'm mistaken, queer folk don't like being called "things"
meaning you're a thing
which is basically "it"
unless you wanna be called "ze"
nah

is that ships love grinding against each other
well, if pirates of the carribbean taught me anything
how it all comes together
isn't a ship referred to as a girl many times?
no middle ground
well, hebrew got the same problem. we have at (female) and ata (male)
geez
kek
this is spanish or portuguese?
elx?
but is bad in many other ways
which can be good to avoid social justice bullshit
They never adopted the 'individualistic' ideals of the west
I guess that's why they're so strange for many people
Comes with centuries of isolation
They're very set in their ways, both good and bad
ironically, they're more backwards about this than most countries
lol
I guess that works for English, but some languages don't have this luxury unfortunately
so you have words for every concievable thing on the planet
I'd say time to pack up the bags and leave but I assume that's not an option
It's the police. I assume they know that in some cases, some stuff need to remain a secret
It might not be able to be used in court but...the new one could
Maybe you can use the recording you already have to get them on the case?
So if you can have the police paint them as suspects, then perhaps you can get your hands on another recording and use it
And yes, this is in Florida
Is the police really not an option? According to what I found, you can record someone without their consent if you are working with law enforcement.
I'd assume they have the resources to deal with such cases
Forgive me if I'm a bit too late to the discussion, but have you tried going to a shelter?
he needs something more concrete than that
you can't depend on an unknown
but presents it in a very thoughtful manner
a bit of a loose and extreme look at the current status quo
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AOMpxsiUg2Q
thought it could garner interesting discussion
so I just found this video
Genesis is the formation of the universe except condensed into a shorter timeframe
interestingly enough, science and religion are very tightly intermixed
If god made humans in his image, then god surely must be flawed
Norse and Greek mythology honestly feel like fantasy creations rather than actual gods to follow or worship
I don't think deities exist, at least not in the sense that we believe
No vows or rituals required
You're not supposed to worship God. You're supposed to take the values that he presents and do your best to uphold them
it's just that human nature turned them into essentially gigantic cults
The bible, and religion in on itself are not bad things. Initially, they were meant to just present values, not rules
Well, late night self discoveries
Bloody hell
But not other milkshakes
Every time.
And out of all the possible combinations, chocolate milkshake gives me a bad stomachache
That...makes an alarmingly logical amount of sense
But not in many other dairy products
Most commonly happens with cereal
Only in certain combinations does it make me run to the toilet
I have a strange relationship with milk
also, there's a difference between cheating and poly
and the vast majority of the world doesn't want to do that
It requires a certain change in mindset and commitment to love 2 people simultenously
I dunno
I know someone who is apparently in one such thing, but...
i know...maybe a case of it working? depending on your definition of working
even if one person isn't, then the whole thing falls apart
everyone has to be okay with it
yeah, I guess it's that simple
it's just cheating
it's not even poly
i don't think there's any correlation, but the one I know is also in that boat so...
Like some had like 20 wives at once and everyone was chill with it
I mean if you wanna pretend you're consorts of an emperor then that's fine I guess?
even if they are aware of each other and are fine with it
one person having two people at once is...eh
when I look at poly at least, I see an agreement between 3 people rather than just 2
there is no middle point in such a discussion
unlike sexes, which we can all agree there are only two of, gender is something that can change as a person grows and the brain develops
the reason being that it's entirely seated on opinions, and you cannot bring science into a topic that is entirely based on the mind
because it is such a sensitive topic, one badly worded sentence breaks down the discussion completely
and things start becoming too personal
from my experience, every discussion on gender inevitably becomes total chaos where nobody can agree on anything
and honestly, it was kind of obvious it would spiral down to that
well, just read through that discussion
Anyway, let's see
Was doing a bit more reading, sorry about that
```
CONCLUSIONS

The available data support the conclusion that human sexuality is a dichotomy, not a continuum. More than 99.98% of humans are either male or female. If the term intersex is to retain any clinical meaning, the use of this term should be restricted to those conditions in which chromosomal sex is inconsistent with phenotypic sex, or in which the phenotype is not classifiable as either male or female.

The birth of an intersex child, far from being ‚Äúa fairly common phenomenon,‚Äù is actually a rare event, occurring in fewer than 2 out of every 10,000 births.
```
http://www.leonardsax.com/how-common-is-intersex-a-response-to-anne-fausto-sterling/
found an interesting read here:
hmmm...I've been doing some reading
while I do know it exists, I'm having trouble finding a frequency
some say it occurs 1 in 2000, some 1 in 100
others state it's not even about the sex but about the gender
there are far too many conflicting studies on this topic
that is all
If I am wrong, show me the evidence and I'll rethink my knowledge
i am claiming based on the science I know
have i ever claimed such a thing?
but those are mutations that do no occur commonly enough
and from what i read, treatment usually involves estrogen/testosterone replacement
and for claims like those, you must provide evidence
nobody can agree to disagree
Tried to talk him out of continuing
I was too late
Ugh
Which then boils down to opinion
The question is then is what counts as true intersex? Because depending on how you look at the spectrum, it can either be more than usual or less than usual
Everything aside, those were quite enlightening reads. Didn't think it happened often enough.
I can't disprove them on my own account
I was in the end proven wrong by the mismatched facts I managed to find
As per my own scientific knowledge, which as we saw was just refuted
It also depends on who stays in that vague middle point
For one thing, I never claimed intersex doesn't exist, so let's move on from that.
What I was saying, or at least claiming, is that it's far too rare to be counted among the general population. To that end, intersex is *still* a mutation in every sense of the word, and as such it's definition as a third sex can come into question.
What the writer of that article was saying was basically that the spectrum *for* intersex is too broad because usually those born intersex are eventually given treatments which place them on the normal male or female groups.
So are those counted among intersex? That I couldn't find. The statistics are far too garbled to make a significant conclusion.
BUT
It does seem to occur often enough, which does present a good point.
But that boils down to cultural definition, which then takes this discussion to a whole different place.
And THAT is the very discussion I don't want to get into, because no one will come out of it satisfied.
But I digress
As I said, it's hard to come across anything concrete
Can only speak from what I know
But I can't speak for him since I'm not his mother
From my acquaintance with him, it was actually just ignorance...that came out in the worst possible manner in the world
This is the internet after all
You can't really point them out though
He did want to try and apologize, but it's probably not gonna matter now
Look, I will admit that I do frequently talk with Langou on DM
Mostly for sharing highly offensive memes, but also as to kind of try and wind him down a bit when this sort of thing happens
And I even praised him a few weeks back for being so reserved here...
And I even told him to not do that
Goddammit Langou
We're actually past the real heat
4am I tuck in like an idiot
do you go to sleep at like really late? cos that's what happens to me to
well, what's done is done
not sure about the guy himself though
At least I enlightened myself on that topic
A very good read
The killer of arguments right there
You can't stop bad people from existing. You can only try to curb the amount of them that there are.
If all the people are dead then there isn't anyone to start the ruckus?
conflict is a necessity, whether it is by debates or by force of arms
while others are wonderous
some of those opinions are horrendous
as long as people exist, different opinions will exist
Even if you brainwash all of the people in the world to be be anti-nazi, at least one person will still somehow end up as one
The thing is, you can't. It's impossible to stop the nazi from existing.
Yorin took the words right out of my mouth
Changing your mind is also a universal right
whether or not other people will agree with those ideas is something else
Having ideas is a universal right
but we are also allowed to deride them for being idiots, while also providing them with plenty facts to argue against their opinion
people are allowed to believe and express their opinion that the earth is flat
those are also necessary
~oil~
okay, better question then
wait what is this about me sacrificing myself?
I was hoping at least I was pretty in your dream
I have a receding hairline
no, i'm not pretty in real life
*BUT WAS I HANDSOME?!?! OR AT LEAST PRETTY?!?*
shakespeare? cao cao? some amalgamation of images?
what did I *look* like in the dream
alright
thought it was something serious
oh
haven't seen him in a while
what happened to ibu?
hey so, real talk here
it's sugar and too many carbs at once
fats aren't the problem in food
I don't think it's as easy as people asking for someone's firing
It's possible there was more going inside the company itself that we don't know about
I guess there's more to it than just that
this is beside the fact that she celebrated TB's death
when called upon her overreaction, she pulled out the gender card
what's he's saying is that she reacted negatively to criticism and a call for friendly discussion

if they can access your computer, they can access a password database
might as well just open a .txt file and write it all down there
Overzealousness will, without a shadow of a doubt, alienate even the most moderate people away from a cause
No matter how righteous the cause, if you try to push it too hard people will get defensive
The left hits overzealousness very very easily
Religion has been twisted in time by greed
Most of the time, it beats people into shape and realism
In Israel, that break is filled with obligatory army time.
It turned from a set of values to cultism
The entire message got flipped and corrupted by shitty people
Gyo is one of Junji Ito's more famous mangas
swimming in shit water looking for less shitty shit
doing god's work
you don't even need to be transgender to receive hate. you just need to be a person in general
it's nothing but sewage and filth and all around degeneracy
it doesn't have anything worthwhile anyway
it's best to steer clear of that place
the prevalence of shitty people on 4chan is staggering
I think she's a good actor. The director is the one making all the strange decisions.
anyway, back to scarlet
for a real butchering, see case dragon ball evolution
gits was only okay because it wasn't nearly as anime as all the others things
gits was the epitome of okay
the director did that
she's just an actor though
oh right, popularity
why didn't they cast a transgender in the first place
ohhhh, that thing
the hell is rub and tug
as in "fluid movements"
Oh wow, I totally forgot fluid could be an adjective at all
omlette du fromage

that's nice
both in Britannia?
oh you two met in real life?
but signs point to no
there is no evidence to prove either point
Once she wakes up she'll tell us
We talking about nasty memes from the early days of the internet?
it's like going into a sewage, and being happy it's a little less shitty than expected
not really
at this point, it's not even surprising
it's *4chan*
remembering shameful or bad moments from the past
we all go through such things some times
i feel you yorin
being spiteful isn't the answer
there's a reason you're coming to them for help after all
as a result, they're the most qualified to pinpoint your problem and help you solve it
they have access to equipment and information that you don't
but it's their obligation to find out for you
no person can know everything
that's legit
Without their knowledge, our transgender folks here would have a much harder time
it's what they studied for and what they dedicated their lives to
they don't, but it's their job to find out
the doctor is a doctor for a reason
that sounds a bit far fetched if I may be honest
aren't those one and the same?
Especially when you have a first impression of a person and you then have to conciously change it.
Not knowing and/or being slow with adjusting is not the same as hating
It's natural when faced with something new
Thats also a thing
It might also be slow adjustment
wait what
A cult made to silence and keep the masses in line so they can be drained of their belongings and dignity
A corruption of the real thing.
It turned from something nice and simple to nothing more than a laughingstock
It's a joke
How can they say god is omnibenevolent, and then say that there are groups that are sinful and have to be killed?
But the priests of old twisted it and made a mockery of it, selfishly adding in rules that never existed in the first place for their own gain.
The thing is, religion was never supposed to be like this. It's nothing more than a set of basic values that was believed all people should follow.

Oh god I just rememberes that series of movies

And it will never end until one side is completely annhiliated
It is far, far more complicated than it looks
The palestinian-israel conflict goes back centuries. It is without a doubt the longest conflict to ever take place.
And in the past it was okay too?
It is an undeniable truth that territories are conquered in wars. A side wins, it gains something from the other. To deny such a thing is to deny human history. It's to say that everything gained through violence is unjust and evil, while forgetting that much of our modern life is based upon such a thing.
That was built by murdering the natives
The entirety of the continent
Do the same for America
If you're going to deny Israel its right to exist
I'm most definitely more informed than you are
On the contrary
Made territorial gains
It won the war
Of course it did
Then what are they? Freedom fighters? Sending children into buses to blow themselves up?
They are the real criminals here
You know them
As in Hamas
Instead of improving infrastructure, they use the money to build tunnels and sneak in weapons
They are used and abused by extrmists
The Gazans are as much victims here
Have I at any point blamed them for anything?
However, it's a much more complicated matter
Don't get me wrong, Israel is definitely to blame for a lot of things
Every source will say something else
You already know that the news is politically biased
Every time
The UN repeatedly decries Israel
It doesn't
There's a lot you don't know
It's not as simple as one side killing the other
But to each their own.
Especially when the situation is very different from what the news would have you believe.
I'm saddened you think that way, but not much I can do to change your mind.
But decrying it for genocide and not doing the same for China and America is double standards
Of course, Israel is not without its bad sides
But the one to blame is Hamas, using the Gazans as shields for its operations and politics
It's easy to paint Israel as the aggressor because it's the stronger power
Because they tend to twist information a lot
Then I will ask to take those things with a grain of salt
It's easy to look from the side and say whatever, but until you're in the situation itself, it will never be the full picture.
While I can stand behind the criticism, there is a lot that you still don't know
I would appreciate if you didn't deny my country's existence
Uhhhhh
It's why I loathe speaking about it
I know firsthand that discussion about Israel go down this path
It's too loaded a topic to be civil
You dont either
Let me just tell you this Hazel.
So long as you haven't been in the conflict yourself and haven't seen it with your own eyes, you cannot deny my own experiences.
So much for civility, right?
Oh goody, we've been reduced to swearing now.
I've worked with Palestinians myself
Because they are not
The fact that you think that Palestinians are considered second class citizens already shows the lack of information
What is sending children into populated centers to blow themselves up then?
As an Israeli who had been in the very heart of all that conflict, believe me, *I know*
I'll make an example.
Let's say you're sword fighting with someone.
They lunge at you.
You, in response, put non-combatant in their path, and they end up stabbing that non-combatant.
Who's at fault? Your opponent, who held the sword, or you, who put the innocent in their path?
Did I ever once say I agreed?
Did I ever say that?
So let's cut our losses and never speak again ever about anything
So by that logic, no one should ever speak
All countries and civilizations are guilty of being aggressors at some point
Honestly, that last part is the one that wasn't part of the original discussion
I can't excuse the last point, which I also believe was uncalled for, but the rest is as you can see.
They chose to insult and turn away opinions simply because of what I am, which I believe goes against the very spirit of the server.
There was an attempt at civility, but unfortunately the other party wasn't very receptive to the idea themselves.
As for the first point, there was also an attempt to correct certain misconceptions they had about the nature of the topic, but all opinions were dismissed very rudely and with a complete lack of respect. They were very narrow minded and refused to believe they were wrong in any way, choosing to accuse and blame in a derisive manner. 
Discussion assumes the parties can speak about the topic and exchange ideas.
None of that happened here.
Loaded topics are always, well, loaded
Gotta let things cool
Pretty much
Hihihihihihi?
Uh, I mean
MY DASTARDLY PLAN HAS COME TO FRUITION!
MUHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
Ahem
Oh
Alright alright I give.
Pfft
Mostly because I'm used to it
I see things cooled down a bit? Funnily enough, I wasn't all that insulted by her
I'm always free to speak about it wobbles
I think Hazel just...left?
and feel alienated
because well, you don't want to move to a new place
I would also take into consideration the community of the place you move to
if it keeps on happening, reinstall the OS
in that case, grab a battle axe, eat a bunch of hallucinogenic mushrooms, and proceed to raid villages in the name of Valhalla

digibro's video
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZSOGZFfSDk
this is the introduction video
they put a lot of focus on their diversity
because rather than focus on the series itself
however, the introduction video gave a bad vibe
it isn't
and some shapes it takes can be uglier than others
the human mind is such a malleable thing
the very fact that people like that exists explains how people like the shooter exist
this man up here is an exception in that he actually got out of it
shitty people only propagate further shittiness
it shapes you
having suffered through some serious shit in their lives or were born with something not right in the brain
it's not a secret that all would-be shooters or eventual shooters are not right in the mind
yeah, we're all guilty of this in one way or another. jumping to conclusions is a recipe for disaster, but it feels almost completely unavoidable
Yeah...you should be careful with that. you are walking on eggshells here, and saying you've already made it across without actually making it across will make you careless.
my only real advice is to not call it something it is not. until the very moment it is set in stone, do not tell yourself it's a certainty
it'd be a good idea to not expect anything
it's goes without saying that kindness will only be able to take you so far
this sounds so incredibly unstable it might as well be sand
and as latooni said, such a thing is highly unstable when it comes to jealousy
it's better not to aim for such a thing
it takes one person not being fine with it for the whole thing to crumble
and she'll stay a friend and nothing more
from the impression I got from what you wrote, she isn't all that into such a thing

Riot Games just released this
so
"Oh great Yog-Sothoth, the Lurker at the Threshold, Opener of the Way, The-One-in-All, please enlighten us with your great wisdom from the beyond! Is this person trans or not?"
*Yog-Sothoth proceeds to roll a die, because it doesn't know either.*
commune with the gods?
roll a die?
ü§∑ they flip a coin?
"We can't tell, so you're allowed/not allowed in."
They should have thought this through much more before they planned such a thing
Exactly because it can be used for and against certain groups
That's why it was poorly thought out
From what I can see, the panel was open only to women and non-binary.
Women is one thing...but how exactly do you know who's non-binary or not? Correct me if I'm wrong, but such a thing isn't exactly written on an id card or painted on your forehead or whatnot. All these men they're trying to keep out can just pretend and nobody can tell otherwise.
God this whole debacle is just a shitshow. Riot is digging their own graves deeper with these completely incomprehensible acts.
You don't become more inclusive by excluding an entire group, no matter who they are.
This is why I try and in engage in the "separate the work from the author" mentality. League can be a great game even when Riot is committing PR suicide. 
It's times like these I remember why I try and steer away from these kind of controversies, although that's not always possible.
Well there aren't two kerriks, so pick one
How did you get to this point

And now for something happier
The bad ones are, like in everything else, the more vocal minority
Those exist, but the bad ones are more likely to be talked about
It may have been on the rise lately, but it's still an exception, not a norm
The fact that polyamourism isn't what you're going to end up with
In the end, your only real mistake was developing too many expectations out of something that was too unstable.
As was said here before, it takes one person not being okay with such an arrangement for the whole thing to fall apart.
You'll have to accept that you'll need to compromise. It won't be fun, and it will hurt, but at the end of the day it's the only real solution.
Love comes in many forms. It doesn't have a single, concrete shape. It can be romantic, it can be platonic, and it can be many many others.
But sometimes what we look for isn't immediately available, or it doesn't turn out as we expected. Now, what are you going to do about it?
I understand it feels like shit, but wallowing in grief is definitely not going to make it better. Realize what it is that needs to be done to make *yourself* happy, first and foremost.
It all depends on how you approach it
It's natural
It would be more worrying if you didn't have that fear
at this point it's just full homo

I remember when I had a spanish test in highschool, and I didn't study, I wrote down everything I needed to know on a tiny word card that I hid in my pencil case. I had full intention to cheat, but funnily enough during the test I never even glanced at the notecard. I just remembered what I had written on it, so no need to even look at it.
gotta pick their battle carefully
people gotta know to reign in their anger, even when feeling provoked
this is the main problem with these kind of things lately
cos stepping into the wrong battlefield will get you destroyed
I look like a caveman
Too late for me
but that's not necessarily a bad thing
sometimes, you end up a role model even if you don't want to
Simple enough
then the test itself was flawed
Show confidence and you'll be fine

even after the president removed the tax due to this, it's still going because of other issues

there's no reason the rich should get tax cuts

go over what you have
why only think
just stick to it
you have a plan of action already
trust yourself
it'll be fine
you're only making yourself more nervous
Wait what
you can calm your nerves
you're past the hard part
see? everything turned out fine
you passed the interview?
it's a yes or a no
you need it for your mental wellbeing
find a way
you have to release that anger in a safe way
the worst thing you can do is bottle it up
don't
they let you smash up stuff to your heart's content
drop a few bucks
those work wonders on letting out some steam
seriously
go to a rage room
Even if they compare you to others, fine. But as long as you focus on your own goal, and take on things when you're comfortable with them, you'll have a much easier time
I'm just gonna throw this out there real quick:
Don't hurry. Take your life at your own pace. Don't dally, but also don't allow people to force you to hurry. You want to make sure you take the right direction.
Which is impossible since the very knowledge of the repeat would already cause a divergence
talk about a clean sweep
as an aside, wow even the greetings to the guy was deleted
and deflect
and pretend
because as much as it sucks, you might have to lie
then this can be an experience for you
and do all you can to not explode on them
so bottom line, mentally prepare yourself for a rough ride
yeah
if they're on the hateful part, it'll be impossible to convince them otherwise
go in with the thought that this is a battle you can't win
yeah, you'll have to force yourself back a lot
listen in to conversations. subtly raise the topic to gauge reactions.
information gathering first so you don't go in blind
think of it like military strategy
it sucks, but you'll need to keep quiet about yourself until you can make sure as to their opinions
cos you could be surprised and find out they're all cool with it
it really depends on the people. it'd be best to survey the environment first and ascertain whether or not they'll be as openly hateful.
"You came to the wrong neighbourhood, motherfucker."
I don't think I've seen a more appropriate time to use the meme of:
while I'm all for giving people the benefit of the doubt, sometimes you just can't
didn't think i'd see someone be so upfront with this in this day and age
lily beat me to it
that server will be better without that guy anyway
the best way to deal with such a thing is to condition oneself to let it out only in a specific environment or object, like a punching bag at the gym or some sort of routine. to get oneself so tired you don't have energy to be angry anymore
the bottled up one
dont act like the average online player
if your anger makes you violent or toxic towards others, it's not a good outlet
that's bad too
never *ever* let it out on others
or go to the gym and do so
get a punching bag and let out the anger on that
yeah, that is a prime example of why it's never a good idea to bottle up anger
even if it's to study, how much do they expect
what do they expect you to do in the rest of the time
seriosuly
what the fuck kind of shit is that
fucking camera in the kid's room like it's a jail
we didn't get the parenting skill!
but meta mahn, obviously people on the internet don't know how parenting works!
that shouldn't even be on the menu
the camera is still overkill
I guess the question is what they *expect* this to do
Like hoe long is school and how long is spent on homework
I guess we need to know his full schedule
Like they can fire you or jail you for disobeying
Or a military unit
It gives the vibe of like a company
Everything about this rule setting is weird
You sit and stare at the ceiling?
And? What happens during the rest of the day?
don't 5 year olds play GTA and call of duty and say they fucked your mom these days?
Then shut them out
Take what you can from them until you can leave
So long as you're dependant on them, it's a good idea not to overly antagonize them
And have your own income
At the very least, dont shut them out until you're a legal adult
all's well that ends well
you might be friends but...maybe putting some distance will do you good

japan is notoriously bad with social commentary
let's not pretend the creators had anything but fetishes in mind when they made a character like Astolfo
the unfortunate consequence of turning everything into a fetish
my school had a single lousy t shirt as uniform
just someone in on the actual problem who care shed light on it
not even as a friend
it's even worse when some people *pretend* to care, and have a mistaken view/opinion about a topic made from a lack of research
to the point it's starting to get tiring
it's almost always fetishized
this is a serious question
when was the last time LGBT+ was represented correctly in anime
Space technology developed as far as it did because the US and the Soviet Union kept on competing with one another to get there first

don't surrender to their stupidity
if they got a problem, they can deal with it
don't let a bunch of fuckwads dictate your happiness
and you've already come this far
because having to feel like shit for years on end is tiring
because you want to make your life better
oh yeah, I remember that

cultural differences
who cares about TV anymore
not that I doubt the real ones
wasn't there a big deal around some big name voice actors bandwagoning on the hate train and just tossing potentially fake accusations too?
gun laws, mental illness, and the news are bigger contributors
they're just using them as a scapegoat to not tackle the real problem
not even the people blaming video games believe they're to blame
the immortalization of serial killers on the news is worse than anything video games can do
he tossed himself into this pile of bullcrap for no reason
More like voice of Vegeta, Chris Sabat
Cos they seem like they're jumping on a bandwagon
The ones I personally doubt come from the big name voice actors
It just the matter of which ones are true and which ones are fake.
It exists.
But there is evidence.
Your sentiment is understandable. Believe me, I know.
I actually used to be in the same camp as you Nep. I needed evidence for all of these accusations before I could give my opinion on it.
Suffice to say there was enough. There were simply too many accusations for me to be able to let that slide.
It's important not to get carried away with this
Calling him a rapist though is a little excessive, not gonna lie. While the sexual harassment accusations are legit, there's a major difference between the two.
and the separation was just for show
inb4 the bags for both were exactly the same

Pffffftt
Is it a good bag at least?
If they thought at all
The uni didnt think this through
Wat
if they have any intention of doing so, of course
like off the top of my head, i'd imagine one of the hardest parts would be opening up to close friends and family, and having to wait for them to also adjust
some handle it better than others
well, they probably differ between people
either the emotional struggle that comes with it, or the sheer amount of bureaucracy and speaking to others about it. or both.
yeah, pretty much
it no longer has a place now
once upon a time a long time ago, it drove nations
and yet it's still used to justify horrible things
religion stopped being important once we reached the information age
Amongst other things
Probably having to do with money and corruption
Only thing theyd keep secret are things thatd undermine their influence
Because it's most likely ultra incriminating
Yes
no, i have enough of that
Someone give me hair
you need to be made of wood and lie a lot beforehand
I've more or less surrendered to being bald at this point
"Are you actually going to use my help or are you just gonna throw a tantrum like last time?"
call her out on it
My recommendation is that next time she comes to your for help in anything
They just give you the metaphorical middle finger and pretend like you didn't say anything
And it's not like they consider it for a bit and then decide on a different option
So why ask for help????
>Someone asks for input/help
>You give the input/help
>They ignore every single bit of it and do something else entirely
basic common sense
and don't flip out for no reason after asking for help
you didn't do anything wrong
from my perspective at least, you have nothing to feel sorry for or to feel like the bad guy
religion or no, you don't waste perfectly good food
even your mom should be angry at her for this
damn right to be angry at her
wasting so much food over a tantrum
of course it should
her problem
threw a tantrum over nothing
well, she ain't having her midnight casserole now
she was being unreasonable, and then when you helped she just flipped at a random annoyance
how did you end up the bad guy in this scenario?
at 10 pm?
that's what she was making?
lol what
You both had something going on and it just came out at the weirdest of times
I see, it was really silly
absolute classic
Maybe it's better we dont know
for the latter, STOP BEING ASSHOLES
for the former, UNIONIZE
for both workers and companies
Maybe this'll open their eyes
Oh boy
You can try to gauge a reaction
hamburgesa con jamon y queso
Change people's sexualities *what*
I'm sorry, did I read that correctly?
what
That, or the fact that Arthur is *still* airing
I dunno whats more surprising
do you really want to play this back and forth with this brick wall of a person?
like come on
looks like a banworthy thing
so might as well be rid of him
not on the internet
you're not going to convince a person like him to change his ways
why entertain his idiocy
no seriously
who the fuck is this asshole and why isn't he banned yet
about as effective as the maginot line
and yet people still just went and bought milkshake somewhere else and threw that instead
they could just throw the shitty burgers at him
oh, so people can't throw it at him
and now McDonalds is globally banning milkshakes?
So a guy got a milkshake thrown at him...
Because beating someone down gives a false sense of superiority

https://nationalpost.com/news/world/2-dead-including-child-in-stabbing-attack-in-japan
And it's not longer
can't really be a mass killing if nobody died
which is already good
so perhaps nobody died
they say only hurt
because other people's suffering gives them money
WHAT
what
see, this is a wonderful example of paid-for agendas
basically fake support
ahhh, that sort of thing
what is this ridiculously dystopian term
wtf is even corporate pride
especially if they're based off of bigotry, or just simple misinformation
on the contrary, opinions *should* be criticized
>every opinion is valid and you shouldn't criticize it
>opinions include ethnic cleansing, genocide, racism, homophobia, and more
yeah, I don't think that sort of mentality works anymore
maybe once the world reaches ghost in the shell levels of technology it can work lol
spreading dangerous opinions counts as acting upon btw
that is, unless acted upon, they're harmless...usually
in the end, opinions are also just that, opinions
people have the freedom to live after all
i mean, if you're threatening people of course you'd be arrested
part of freedom of speech also includes *not* listening to things
freedom of speech is basically you can't be arrested for having an opinion
it harkens back to that "IT'S JUST A PRANK BRO" attitude a lot of people have
that condones memery about everything instead of actually doing something
it's just that there's this mindset on the internet
and i've already talked about my personal peeve in length many times
this isn't about me though
i'm not very fond of meme culture, to put it lightly
10000IQ solution!
If you meme about the problem, it doesn't exist!
i mean how can walmart be a shitshow of a company if they JOJO MEME AMIRITE GUYS
literally nothing is bad if you just meme
Everything is fine as long as you meme after all
See, as long as you meme stuff, it's a-okay! You're hip and cool and a comedy genius!
and maybe actually do something worthwhile
it's better that they don't try to meme their way into popularity
this is stupid
now people are gonna be like "ERMAGERD WALMART IS SO COOL HERP DERP"
40 dollars in 2000 and 40k in 2019 what the fuck
wtf
I thought there was a new scary rule in place
Phew
Please saki, we deserve much better than terfs
But why would I want to fuck Terfs? Theyre icky and gooey and smell kinda bad.
nothing to find there
and I dont use twitter no
and that's something people have forgotten
but there's a time and place for everything
heck, I'm the type of person who unironically likes dark humor
and don't get me wrong, I like to joke around a lot too
way too many times
if the person on the other end doesn't like it, you can just shift the blame to them
if you just joke, you're free from all responsibility, right?
that is basically
weren't we talking about that half shaved half slicked to the side blue hair?
it sounds obvious, but people really have a hard time acknowledging this fact
there's two sides to every coin
so yeah, important to remember
after all, you could have a very positive impression of something even though if you look slightly deeper you see all sort of shit
this goes both for negative and positive aspects
if there's one thing worse than having bad impressions, it's to refuse to acknowledge that a different side exists
the important thing is to be aware of it and to educate oneself about it
it happens
we're all guilty of having bad impressions
since the media likes to accentuate the bad of everything, then the bad is what you see
since it's the only thing you see of that group, that becomes your impression
the extreme minority of any group gets more coverage because they're louder
that's the case with everything really
Wtf
Guaranteed
You definitely have some
Ironclad rule of the internet
If it exists, someone has a fetish for it
Most of the time
It's mostly played for fetish
Just an aesthetic for the cyberpunk setting
Yeah I dont think this is made with the intent to offend
It's best not to assume anything
People are complex creatures
both of which can't be delayed
the pokemon thing is also tied to the release of the anime and the TCG
And shareholders are too
Goes to show investors are scumbags
A bold move by nintendo
we were all once dumb fuck kids at some point
I did *not* notice the penis
*oh*
Oh
while I'm all for being skeptical, one needs to know when to accept the evidence
with science tho...yeah...
disagreeing with opinions is one thing
this was quite an unfortunate arguement
even context can't really help that one
it's for this reason sarcasm still fails to register with people when it's in text
yeah, but no amount of that will be able to convey the real meaning behind words
you can only go by context
yeah but text doesn't have voice for you to hear
unfortunate truth
Cos voice actors pretty much ganged up on him without due cause
Which gave him the chance to sue for defamation
It's what caused the Vic thing to go out of control
every language that has those is automatically harder to learn
it's a pain in the ass
grammatical gender
ugh
Cops do a vital job
no?
uhhhhhh
some obvious things aren't as obvious as they seem to be
yeah
that'd have made him, for a lack of a better word, more susceptible to such pressure
but for that you'd have to look at his medical history and whatnot
oh, definitely
it can aggravate an already existing condition
in that the people who actually are pushed to violence through such media are those already with previous problem
it's kinda like that whole "video games cause violence" debacle
thing is
he had mental health problems
In any case, we should prepare for the inevitable news
he was found in the river under the manhattan bridge
he wasn't found in his apartment
just a correction though
has she not heard of earphones?
but if a video game got you interested in history, that's great!
~~it wasn't really that hot tbh~~
Why wouldn't you follow him?
Your country is in shambles, its economy is destroyed, and everyone is suffering. Suddenly this dude comes up, tells you he figured out the problem and offered a solution
<:TsubasaYareYare:407397617451139073>
that was just some crazy ass christians so bored out of their minds they had to point at something to be outraged at
it's nothing new that villains can end up charismatic
just another self-righteous prick
seriously
this guy is an idiot
maybe they could get memed into office
how professional
wait what
regardless of what the truth is
The more you believe what they tell you, the easier it is for them to convince you to give them your money
It's just making a narrative that benefits *them* out of everybody
it's not even just keeping outdated viewpoints
vaccines cause autism, the earth is flat, yadda yadda yadda
it's not secret the media uses actual news to forge a narrative that fits its purposes and political alignments
they also present said problem as easy to fix even though in reality it's either not a problem or it's a problem that's not nearly as simple as they make it out to be
just that promise alone is enough to convince people to support them
then *say* they will fix the problem
they simply point to a thing, regardless of what it is, and call it a problem
what they do is give the *illusion* of dealing with a problem
nah you see, they don't even do that
The culprit will likely face the death penalty for this
That's just digusting
A single fire can cause untold amounts of damage
Thing is that many buildings in japan are still made of wood
Arson in japan is a capital crime
I dont think it can
And discover that the world isnt as black and white as you were told in school
So unfortunately, you have to educate yourself afterwards to find out the full picture
School history tends to paint events in a very particular light depending on where you live
As sad as it is, it's impossible to stop bad people from existing. Even if you change human nature, there'll always be the few exceptions
The book of Genesis and the formation of the universe are pretty much the same story
He's going to get it no matter what
They might have to shut down for the foreseeable future
This might completely destroy the studio
https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2019-07-19/kyoto-animation-president-states-in-interview-that-all-materials-computers-were-destroyed-in-fire/.149142
jesus fuck
This is mass murder
They're not that kind
Something with plagiarism
From the info that was gathered, it was something else
no amount of money will ever fix that
but losing all of their work and data is just too big of a hit
the company was most likely insured
probably, but I don't think that's the problem
who the hell makes up these headlines
wtf are these articles
the beliefs have been constantly tampered with and edited to suit agendas that at this point, nobody knows what the real one was
it's all interpretations
god didn't write anything
without all that "stop being gay" or "dont eat pork" shit
the bible *used* to be a set of very simple values that anyone can stand behind
or use it to push their agenda forward
the biggest problem with all "modern" takes are that they really are just interpretations of a bunch of old guys from the past and present that think their take is the only real one
but neither had a bow named Ichaival
Both Ullr and Odin existed in mythology
Yeah
Ichaival never existed
there is no mention of it anywhere outside of Fire Emblem
his career is already pretty much in shambles
imo, the best answer would always be no
if the choice lies between yes and no when it comes to recreational drugs
but since every person was born with a different brain
temporarily altering the way it functions
the molecules bind to receptors in the brain
if I remember correctly as to how it works
some people end up with permanent brain damage from just one use
can't assume you'll get the same amazing trip that others get
the effects are varied between person to person
hallucinogenic drugs are illegal pretty much everywhere
it's illegal as hell
nobody is in a rush to destroy the world with nukes, as much as that can be surprising
there's no point in doomsinging about it, I'd say
with all due respect, it isn't exactly being threatened on its home soil in a constant basis
does the US even have a reason to implement a draft in this day and age?
As they say, everything in moderation
Hell, *sugar* is a drug
I fucking hate cigs
Alcohol is one thing, but cigarettes are literal cancer in a tube
you'd have to do so by force of arms
there are simply too many groups
probably impossible with the current political climate
not to mention that these days, you'd be hard pressed to even get support for such a war
speaking from experience
especially online
and conversations about it usually end poorly
it's always loaded
yeah, the middle east is a topic that shouldn't be raised casually
but in reality, it's another run of the mill western country
outside looking in, yeah it's impressive
Israel
as someone who comes from a country that is frequently threatened with war, eventually you become numb even to the fear
unless you're travelling directly to the war zone, not even that'll be a problem
for all intents and purposes, war for the general US public will be nothing more than headlines
Any war the US participates in won't be on its home soil
I doubt you have anything to fear

kyoani are gonna continue?
wait really?
use him as an example
you make the calls there
also, he's an ass
bot or not, lolicon and shotacon are against discord's terms of service
just ban him, seriously
you know he did it and he'd do it again if you didn't stop him
this is a discord server
this isn't some loophole in the law
he still abused the bot to post the pictures
it goes against discord's terms of service iirc
why are you even keeping him around
ban him
just kick him out

yeah but a big enough one to cause actual damage? I don't think it would be missed so easily
many smaller asteroids pass through earth's atmosphere pretty regularly
let's just say that if a big enough asteroid came along, astronomers would know
That's a thing you shouldn't worry about
<:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/ci2tyy/yasuhiro_takemoto_47_confirmed_dead_by_his_family/
she claims she's not crazy, buuuuuuut
...what
<:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
heck, shooting stars are exactly that
basically unless the asteroid is big enough, it'd burn up in the atmosphere and do absolutely nothing
or at least break it up enough so that the smaller shards would burn up in the atmosphere
not much I'd say, other than perhaps nuking it or something once it came close enough
They don't know who they're missing
Their loss!
even if that payment is just appreciation
expect payment
when you're good at something, never do it for free
as they say
a person that cannot thank others is a person that cannot help others
a simple thank you can go very far in keeping both parties happy
a mark of a good person is not just a person who helps others, but also someone who can sincerely thank others
and eventually, a lack of gratitude can even lead even the most helpful people to stop being so
and that is something that unfortunately a lot of people have forgotten about
But I believe that gratitude fosters goodwill
It doesn't have to be in words. It can be with just actions.
of sincerely appreciating what you do for them
and they forget that simple word of "thanks"
sometimes, people are so used to you being good to them and helping them, that they start thinking your help is a given
and taken advantage of
The thing is, many times goodwill is taken for granted
appreciation
and that is gratitude
However, one cannot forget about a simple, small thing that keeps good will going
The desire to help others is a good one, and I agree with it
Goodwill is a scarce resource
So
will do so in a moment
I do have a bit of something to add
that goes a long way
you've already said your thanks anyway too
The very fact you have the self-awareness already puts you in a much better position
forget the girl and keep the friendship
god was a bit of an ass yeah

each has their own pros and cons
obviously, there's no correct form of government
because that'd just bring them more money
they wouldn't care if there were even 250 mass shootings every *day*
they don't give a damn about how people actually use them
meanwhile, they benefit from the sale of guns and ammo
and in return, doesn't put them ever on the spotlight
the president wants campaign money, so he takes it from big companies like the NRA
obviously it all comes down to money in the end
draw the attention away from the guns
and because a lot of people blindly believe this, it's easy to just point at them every time
and that they're working on a 'fix'
they only point at them because they need to give the illusion of having identified a problem
these days at least, not even the politicians who say video games cause violence *Actually* believe they do that
here's the thing
there's hardly anything real to be gained from it
even war isn't as profitable these days
if only it was that simple
news sources are master at stirring up misunderstandings
and just compared poor vs wealthy
he should've just kept the whole skin color/race part out of it though
it didn't mention just white kids
he did continue his sentence
however
yeah, he worded himself poorly
he's just a troll
if he has nothing, then you have nothing to worry about
It depends on what sort of "evidence" he's bringing up
in any case, I don't think you need to really worry
what kind of people are in your server, seriously
Biden isn't an evil hitler satan demon just yet
talk about shaping public opinion
somehow conveniently omitting everything he said after it
every headline is focusing on the 'white kids' part
cos that was the entire point of what he was saying
socialism led to communism after all
its value fluctuates way too much
i dont trust cryptocurrency, to be quite honest
that's why they collapsed
there isn't a single chinese dynasty that wasn't corrupt to the core
China has always had a deep history of corruption in its courts
which in the end depends on what do you prioritize

e.g JK Rowling
I think we're all wise enough to know that we can enjoy works despite an author being somewhat of an ass
but in all seriousness though
lel
~~or am I~~
regardless what kind of person he was, reading and enjoying his works doesn't reflect your own opinions
I find that engaging in separation of work and author helps a lot
re: lovecraft
Why is it becoming a reality
A comedy movie
Johnny English
What was it again? Oh right
I swear to god Ive seen a movie about a guy wanting to turn England into a giant prison
finally some good news!

hopefully her vision isn't badly affected
Well, you never know until you actually try
Shield Hero is in the same boat. Set a serious tone, and then as it kept going it lost it completely, making those earlier scenes feel out of place. Apparently, the tone is kept better in the web novel.
In the end, Goblin Slayer is a series that didn't succeed in using a serious topic well, which is why it got so much flak
eh, as one who has read the manga...nah, it doesn't have any more scenes like that in it. Sure, the main cast occasionally find characters who are already after it, and then there's the whole meatshield thing, but it's actually not that edgy aside from that. I'd say that outside of those scenes, it's actually...quite vanilla. Which is why those scenes stick out all the more, because they feel out of place. That's again the problem with it, because it never kept the serious tone throughout, and treated those scenes as just random occurrences. While in the world itself it's established that it's a common thing, it doesn't feel treated as seriously as it should
The problem with Goblin Slayer is that it failed to keep the tone that initial scene set, which is what made it into shock value. Other than that, it's nothing special as a fantasy series. Berserk for example is a series which has those sort of scenes and keeps its tone consistent throughout its run. That's a successful use of it, while Goblin Slayer didn't.
What timelime are we in?!
that's how weird it is

it sounds like they're joking
One more person coming to them with a complaint won't change their mind
The mod doesn't care enough to see this as a problem
Realistically, I highly doubt you're the first person to come forward with this
Your goal is valiant, but you're expecting too much from a mod of a subreddit who hasn't done a thing about this until now
Then what makes you think this letter will suddenly change their mind
shit

here we go again
oh boy
let's not forget Sodom and Gomorrah
just don't check the comments
the samurai mentality of honor and work for the many
those are their values
iirc japan has the highest rate of death by overwork in the world
because of the harsh expectations placed on them
they focus more on a stable career than on raising a family
their population is dwindling
I want to go there again and do a sight seeing trip
they gain some unrealistic image of it, thinking it's the holy land
is how many people see japan as some anime paradise purely based on the anime they watch
the saddest thing though
if you don't leave the city too much
how necessary is a car in japan actually
well, the western mentality of individualism also has its own share of problems
it's already kind of the case
wasn't there a story about a tourist with a huge yakuza-like tattoo and he proceeded to get killed over a misunderstanding?
even a small tattoo and they think you're yakuza
yeah lol
it's fine to love it, but don't go nuts with it
you just need to tone down your enthusiasm a bit
You really shouldnt be worrying about a job right now
how is it any of their business what you do in your free time
You're not at the stage where this sort of thing should be a priority
You have absolutely no idea where you'll be in 10 years, or heck, even 5
You shouldn't even be thinking about it
You're like what, 14? 15?
guy is a goddamn lunatic isn't he
about time
Focus on the other person
In that case, switch the conversation around
not a replacement for actual therapy
but they clearly aren't
if they were your friends, you'd already be back in that group a long time ago
but honestly, it feels like in the long run, you'll benefit
yeah, it's gonna be hard to let them go, because you're so used to their presence
so fuck them
without telling you the who and how and why
it just looks like they chose to dump you out collectively
like, sorry, from an external perspective
then dump them too
He's a toxic ass that you don't need in your life

A civil war in America today is as unlikely as a meteor destroying the world in the next decade
As twitter does
The ones closest to it are either both, fluid, or neither
In fact, i dont think there's a single transgender character in Fate
Although Deon, at least in Fate, doesnt fit the definition either
odd they'd put Astolfo but not Chevalier Deon

they don't want to regulate it
many other countries allow to carry guns and they don't have nearly as many problems with them as America does
and all the other smaller parties are just kinda there
there's always the big duel between two parties
and I assume when elections come, it's only around 1 or 2 parties that everybody is talking about, right?
I'm sure you have your own set of major issues that drive people mad
I don't know anything about Indian politics though
lol, if by biggest you're referring to population number, then yeah, definitely
it's a side effect of democracy
this division
it's a somewhat... western concept, I'd say
it's just that the bad points tend to be highlighted
because both sides have their good points and bad points
at the end of the day, there isn't really a correct answer
and have it extended towards economics, race, social standing, and so on
and expand it beyond the scope of religion
so you more or less take that example
a conservative would stick to the old rules without any desire to change them
a reformist muslim would, for example, bend the rules the religion dictates in order to allow a woman to do certain things men are allowed
let's take islam
for example
in religion it's easiest to grasp
religious, social, and economical, for instance
the left *generally* tend to be reformists, while the right tends to be conservatives
to put it into perspective
then naturally, nothing is going to get anywhere
but as long as the government holds it as sacred law
it is a wack
because the origin of the problems stems from the way the constitution was written in 1776
It's probably not as easy to solve as it seems to be
politically
when was the last time you heard anything positive happening
it seems political issues reign supreme
no matter the country
parliament with many parties, but only two are ever talked about
our political systems also work the exact same way
so I very much understand you
including a difficult situation with a lot of depth
and we practically have the exact same problem
because I'm from Israel
it's kinda funny
You know subra
Heh
usually the rest of the parties form up to become the opposition
not really that supririsng
japan is notoriously awful with representing minorities
Lol, blizzard reddit is blocked now
https://twitter.com/GodsUnchained/status/1181487505180258304
https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/bjw535/blizzards-hong-kong-screw-up-is-officially-an-international-incident
curious to see how Blizzard will respond to this
make sure to protect yourself
he might try to retaliate
in the end, it's impossible for everyone to care about everything
yeah
that's his career destroyed forever
welp
the entire reason Nasu made Saber a girl in the first place was due to wanting to get more people to buy the game during the VN market of the early 2000s
not all of them, but many, specifically the genderbent ones, are
and Astolfo being like "sure why not" for shits and giggles
Even the lore reasons he crossdresses in the first place are entirely due to a different character making a joke
That's the reasoning that went behind his creation
His entire existence is for the sake of crossdressing fetish
He's not nearly as complex as he's made out to be
Also, I won't lie, but you're giving Astolfo way too much credit
because the people to bone are also just as tired and busy
it just takes a while
the world has its own reset button though
did you know that lancelot is actually a french OC?
when told orally, naturally it can change cos people forget details
a lot started off as the sort of "campfire" story
the building could collapse on top of you from a freak earthquake
paranoia isn't helpful
Living while being constantly afraid of danger is no way to live
keep trying
the fact you're aware of yourself is already a good start
you two are sliding away from the convo tbh
but that's not on you, that's on the adults
they need to be taught that such things are not okay to say
Kids say stupid shit all the time
they're *kids*
It's just you'll suffer more with the paranoia
It's not *entirely* unreasonable, because the US does indeed have a huge problem with it
if you live your life constantly being afraid of risk, you'll never get anywhere
as Ship said, every part of life carries a risk, mortal or otherwise
yeah but being scared everyday that someone will bring a gun won't help in any manner
other countries that allow you to carry don't have that kind of problem
it's so bizarre how the mass shooting thing is so egregious only in america
as they should be
what did we say about paranoia
lectric
well, if you had any doubts earlier...
well, I suppose Blizzard's stance has become quite obvious
and then proceed to do nothing
say "nununu you're bad"
say it's that country's fault the world is shit
point to a country
they play the blame game of course
the big scary net neutrality removal thing failed too
lol plz
you can always just go to kissanime and find anything you want
and even then, it'd only affect official providers
but it won't stop japan from producing
that's as far as I see it going
at most, it'll get banned in western UN nations
as if japan is gonna care about what some foreigners think
they have no way to enforce it
we all know even if that goes through
and at most they'll hit the official providers
japan doesn't care enough
I still don't think they have any way to enforce it
if someone doesn't have that ability, then it's a problem with the person, not the work
shockingly, most people have the ability to distinguish between real and fiction
videogames don't cause violence, and fictional child porn doesn't cause uh... pedophiles
sorry but, you have no proof of this claim. it's exactly like the video games cause violence narrative. I understand your feelings on the matter, but drawn and real are vastly different beasts
i didn't know either lol
also yes wtf
ants wage war against each other, and the victor consumes the others' spawn
because that flaw is built into humans as animals
maybe history would've looked very different
if only it was that simple
or is that something else?
I think self defense goes into third no?
*what*
anything less than 25 to life is too little
jesus fuck what
people will murder others over fucking parking space
the bible at this point is just an excuse
as sad as it is, people would find any reason to hate others
if we had the answer as to why that happened, it probably wouldn't have happened at all
because the abuser spins the truth to make it seem like it's their fault
it's one of the reasons why a lot of people tend to remain in abusive relationships
yeah
it's important to recognize the signs so you can cut said person off as soon as possible
it fucks up a lot of people
supreme emotional abuse
```You no longer feel like the person you used to be.
You feel more anxious and less confident than you used to be.
You often wonder if you‚Äôre being too sensitive.
You feel like everything you do is wrong.
You always think it‚Äôs your fault when things go wrong.
You‚Äôre apologizing often.
You have a sense that something‚Äôs wrong, but aren‚Äôt able to identify what it is.
You often question whether your response to your partner is appropriate.
You make excuses for your partner‚Äôs behavior.```
manipulating someone psychologically into doubting their own sanity and perception
gaslighting as well
a lack of empathy is one sign of a narcissist
mostly because you didn't stick around enough
it's likely you've met one but never noticed
it's a varying set of cues that can take a while to notice
it's not just a person who proclaims "I LOVE MYELF SO MUCH"
narcissists are masters at emotional manipulation
that's because they're good at hiding it
then it can become varied
well, you need to see which subjects we end up talking about
i think that'd just fall under sexual exploitation
tfw there's even an adverb, but I have no idea how you'd use it
trans man, trans woman, so on and so forth
yeah
and gaslight you into thinking they know your feelings better than you do
narcissists who pretend to be empaths
hell, you know what's even more ironic?
narcissists and incels can be said to be parallel yet the inverse of each other
incels aren't so much that they are obsessed with themselves and more resentful towards others
narcissism has a lot to do with a lack of empathy as well as emotionally manipulating other people
Narcissism is characterised by a lot of things
yeah, there's an inherent difference
if you no longer feel any joy when you're with a person, it may be a sign to cut them off
yeah, it's horrible

anonymity is powerful
that actually happened a while back
this is without mentioning what the actress said

how to tank your reputation 101
i didn't even think of that
that's actually a very insightful look at it
meaning even if the question did come up and he voted for it, that wouldn't automatically mean it'd pass
iirc, the president's vote doesn't have more weight than the others'
why? did he do something?
they're the single most terrifying thing humanity has ever created
fantastic
having an easy "delete city" button on hand is horrible
hiroshima and nagasaki proved just how utterly terrifying they were
it's either no nukes or a fuckton of them
in the end, it *is* an extreme
the threat of mutual annihilation was too great
it's the reason why the cold war never went hot
not really, no
memed a monkey into office, yeah
even the use of a single nuke could trigger a chain reaction that could cause many other nukes to be launched
talking a lot, yet saying nothing
always old men talking
in an arms race to survive, you start coming up with all sorts of stuff
how war boosts innovation
it's kind of ironic, i have to say
to be fair, most things were use in our day to day lives started off as things for the military
that sounds too absurd to be true
just saying boogaloo won't get you raided or arrested
basically
don't frequent gun discords if you're that afraid
well then
I find it highly unlikely that it's because of "boogaloo"
honestly, if the FBI went as far as to raid someone due to something they said on discord
cos said person can always bring up the defense of not knowing what it meant
and even if they only look at gun discords, they cannot legally arrest anyone for using a certain word
why on earth would they look into random anime discords to look for possible criminals
if the context it's used for is for shooting cops
so at most, they'd look at the servers related to guns
it's impossible for any organization to look at all of them and look for instances of boogaloo
there are literally millions of discord servers
there's your answer
well
>firearm enthusiast discords
<:HibikiWhat:336656482907193344>
huh?
this is why it's confusing
it's not that I don't believe you but... feels like it's too minor to get raided over
that this particular phrase got someone raided?
can you show us the article where it stated that?
so...
why would that get a server tagged by... anything?
look through the keyhole to see who it is if someone knocks
naturally, don't open the door to anyone
in the case of those under 18, it's used to report cases of abuse

they're wrong
it doesn't matter who said it
someone on discord
who the heck told you that therapists sell info?
?!?
it couldn't even be called living
living in fear of risk doesn't lead anywhere
it could happen at any point and any time
exactly
a skewed view of the world caused by twisted experiences
I assure you, in the hypothetical case you could go back in time and study each of them, you'd see a person with extremely abnormal behavior and upbringing
it's a psychological trigger
it's more than that
hatred alone is not enough to cause someone to shoot up a school
schr√∂dinger's apocalypse
they're the only country I hear that has such a high rate of not only suicide, but actual death from overwork
that's enough of a sign that it's unhealthy
their work culture kills them
recognize the signs of when you're freaking out and then stopping it
what you need is the ability to calm your mind
it sounds funny, but it can help
maybe you should start meditating
if a worker dies due to fatigue, the higherups should be punished

what's with this bowing to authoritarian regimes lately
can they? i dunno
their goal is to make money after all
corporations after all
why care about what you say to others if there's virtually no consequence for doing so
because anonymity is a powerful tool
wow, that's the first time I find out about this acronym too lol
religion got twisted by agendas and greed over thousands of years
bible cannot possibly be wrong
the bible said gays are bad
religion, most of the time
it's less religion and more a set of traditions
we all live in a truman show plot
unfortunately, not every arguement has a clear cut middle ground
a lot of arguements turn into ad hominems which is just ugh
ironically enough, the age of consent in most of the US is 16 apparently
i think I understand what he means.
Essentially, being politically correct/progressive for brownie points. E.g, including a gay character just for the sake of having a gay character and wanting to appear inclusive and progressive.
fake representation, pretty much
the fact that they found each other is cute
yeah, there's no way in hell that's legitimate
not even the Room, a memeically bad film, has such a low user score
blizzard's case isn't only how they did it, but *when* they did it
it's as simple as that
you watched it and didn't like it
that's not a problem with fake representation then
yeah lol the original nick fury was just a common GI Joe looking dude
it's just that it's not so simple
there are probably ways to do it correctly

I have no idea if I answered as I'd have liked
i swear, the wording the test uses is deliberately confusing

oh jeez
so why does it call it anarchist? ü§î
adapting takes a while
You lived in a certain sort of environment that didn't expose you to this, and so it's new to you
Well, you can't help the fact that you didn't know
mostly cos all the lawmakers are greedy 60 year olds
laws take a long time to catch up to recent trends
wonderful first videogame
I was like 6 when I played Duke Nukem for the first time
the most perfect stage to use "ok boomer" on
what kind of mental gymnastics did he do to reach that sort of conclusion
no seriously
*how*
w-what
is he saying that free broadband is anti semitic?
I'm seriously confused
w-what
what is he even saying
i don't understand his take lol
is bolsenaro still the president?
trying to convince them of anything would be a waste of time
just leave the group and let them stew in their own stupidity
(that's the simplified version btw)
it's bigger
and the sugarpunch server
the wikia server
there's two more btw
basically
and Hazel got away with a slap on the wrist
whatever the fuck that means
"Trying to shut down discussion"
I got slapped with a warning for
at the end of it all, when alice came to "clean up"
fat load of good that did
I tried to engage in a discussion
"you're the aggressor so your opinion doesn't matter"
"you deserve to die"
opinions like
that hazel person had very strong opinions about israel and jews
long story short
Yeah well... Let's just say I'm still pissed over the fact that alice allowed the server to be used as a platform for thinly veiled anti-semitism
I still have beef with Alice over the whole Hazel thing
that they're not here
it's better this way
lmao
did he ever say his reasons?
that was a very odd time
sugarpunch is a non factor
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
the wikia...
sgg keep to themselves
basically, the only servers worth noting are this one and valk
after coming back I had negative trust in the mod team, and I told myself to never bring up the topic of israel again. couldn't know if they'd turn on me if I did.
i'm quite a grudge holder
forgive me for not having sympathy
some of which left the server after that
that pissed a lot of people off here by the way
Server was used as a platform for anti-semitism
In any case, yeah
I won't delve into this now because that's not the conversation we're engaging in
suffice to say I have to stand my ground a lot
israeli jewish
I am
and turned on me when I defended myself
and alice basically let it happen
I was being verbally attacked
so now it's just archaeic and infinitely more unfunny
like all jokes, it stopped being funny the more people did it
it's just a dig at genders and sexual orientation
but it's already been done to death everywhere else
either don't meet them or understand from the beginning that they're not as great as you think they are
and humans are flawed
because unsurprisingly, they're human
Once certain symbols are taken and become associated with hate, it's hard to rid them of that image
Pretty much
push him to seek help harder
to lose that would be to lose part of history
and culture is closely tied to history
as was said here before, language is closely tied to culture
even among people who speak the same language there are a myriad of conflicts and misunderstandings
in my opinion at least, it wouldn't change a thing
absolutely not
no

welp
Considering a mordor-shaped lava formation near australia was found, calling it a hellscape isnt far off right now
you don't even need an article to reach the conclusion that it's a shithole
I mean, what you get when looking up kiwi farms on google is a straight up:
Most of the jews he rescued eventually left japan to head back home or to Israel, while a few others remained behind and assimilated into japanese society
He's the only japanese national known to have done so and on such a scale
Many of which made their way into japan and survived the holocaust as a result
Who risked his life, career, and family to issue travel visas into japan for thousands of lithuanian jews
One of the more famous rescuers at the time was the japanese ambassador in lithuania, Chiune Sugihara
In an interesting sort of irony, japan actually harbored jews for a good while
Considering they had their own
While they were part of the axis, they never implemented the nazis' policies
As for japan
Swastika alone = usually okay depending where
German flag alone = ok
German flag + swastika = nazi
Not really a source id trust tbh
Who are these sources
Anything heavier is an instant no though
Weed isn't bad in small doses and at irregular times
Also it depends how much you like these people
But it's pretty harmless
I mean if seeing others smoking weed makes you uncomfortable then dont go
google brings up that they killed at least 6 million people of mixed east asian descent
yeah, I've read in some places that what Japan did was equal in severity to the holocaust
this is how you find out what you like, what you don't like, who you like and why, and who you want to stay away from
use this time you have to discover and experience
but still
It wasn't all bad because it proved useful later
that was an experience
later down the line I cut contact with them and moved on with life
It was really only to get along with the cool kids who I later discovered didn't like me at all
and I didn't even like doing it
completely crazy thing to do for such a dumb thing
forged the principal's signature and everything
I managed to get a fake ID and get into clubs while pretending to be 18
around 15-16
like, I can tell you that when I was in highschool
adding some reasonable spice to life isn't a crime
it's the perfect time to explore the world and discover things
you're a teenager
They know they'll be destroyed if they do so
Neither Iran nor North Korea have the guts to do it
I feel that it's a bit too paranoid to be worried about being nuked
as a deterrent against enemies
most countries holding nukes today hold them just to check off that they have them
The repercussions for using a weapon banned by the geneva convention are too high to be worth revenge
the country known as Iran would literally cease to exist
and if we assume the worst case scenario and they actually manage to drop a nuke on the US
and just that discovery would be incentive enough for the US to come in and raze the place to the ground
even if Iran suddenly decides to nuke the US, I highly doubt they'll be able to do so without being discovered
it's less that and more that if they do, they'll be utterly annihilated
So to a lot of people, the wars in the middle east are nothing more than headlines in a newspaper
And the people fear mass shootings more than anything
However, America has its own fair share of problems domestically
To that end, America has no real need to fear invasion and therefore the civilians dont live in fear of being bombed and such like the ones in the middle east
I think 9/11 was the last time America was actively attacked by a foreign power on its own soil
and if there's war, it won't be on american soil
and all of a sudden there's a talk of nukes
Trump called a drone strike on some Iranian general/leader or something, and now Iran is pulling out of negotiations and claim they want revenge
south korea has a draft due to the threat of north korea
but that still hasn't happened everywhere
europe however does seem to be more open to it due to Russia possibly being a threat and they want to prepare in case of
but yeah, I think in the current social aspect of the US, I think that a draft in case of war would be unlikely
squats
you don't get to see your home for weeks
yeah, if you do that
hahahaha
because everyone goes through that and it's the biggest shock when you first enlist
unarguably, the hardest part will be bootcamp
it looks good on a resume too
the IT department of militaries is actually a good gateway to getting experience in a field
there're a lot of jobs to do in the backlines
armies don't consist of only fighters
however, there is a silver lining
it's mandatory after all
the military doesn't really care if you're against war or not
unsurprisingly, a whole lot of people are unfit to be in the military
yeah, that happens a lot
as someone who went through mandatory military time, and served as a unit commander for fresh recruits
and those nations are at much bigger risk than the US or any european country could ever be
I think the pushback would be too strong for that to happen
I don't think there's any need to fear military drafts happening
I know
and for some reason people preferred him over hillary
at this point i'd say trump is actively seeking to tarnish america's image more than it already was
this is without mentioning the fundamental difference in values
Also, the culture around voice acting in japan is completely different from the west
You're forgetting that she's in Japan, not the states
and that's where the difference lies
to single her out is a dick move
she's not very different from other VAs
she was also pretty openly perverted in the fgo NA panel
which is most likely what it is
It's kind of interesting how in Japan nobody gives a damn about what she said and took it as a joke
but just from what I see trump is doing
I don't know enough about her to know why this happened
those theories are fun, but the vast majority of them are most likely going to be proven false
Our observable universe is way smaller than what truly exists
I think we've not yet achieved the technological prowess to determine that for certain
and the US isn't helping
the country is a hellhole and they've already suffered enough under a horrible, extremist regime
in any case, the ones you should be fearing for are the innocent iranians who'll get caught up in the conflict
did china even offer a statement on the matter? i didn't notice if they did
nukes are not getting dropped on anyone
take comfort in the fact that for you, this is going to remain nothing but headlines
let me put it this way
it's not going to become a world war no matter what way you take this
leave all those ass servers
stay only in places you feel comfortable in
it's not the first time you've dealt with this
stop using it
social media causes you anxiety
Also I'm pretty sure a 3d printed gun wouldn't survive a single shot
He'll 100% fail doing that with a 3d printer
Also making a working gun is a lot harder than it looks
healthy skepticism is good for you
I also suggest taking sources online with a grain of salt
surround yourself with people you trust
people download porn on school computers and nobody raises an eyebrow
believe me, a single image of a loli is not going to get you in trouble
that's just a really stupid name
fucking lolicore
and nightcore is just remixed anime themes
its basically nightcore
strangers is another
with friends it's one thing
yeah exactly
because anonymity is too much of an easy tool
hype backlash and aversion are definitely real things
Because I experienced it too
I can't blame people for avoiding certain things because of the fandom
you can't know for certain ever
this is the internet after all
and hyperbole can give impressions of fanaticism
if your first impression is through a giant group essentially trying to force it down your throat, then it's no surprise you'd never want to check it out
but as you know, first impressions are critical
Yeah, a fandom shouldn't ever be a part of the experience
it's rare to just stumble upon things these days
For the vast majority of people, the first encounter with any particular show is usually through its fandom
Yeah but you gotta remember
Since he most likely never had an interest in it in the first place, he's just jumping on the hater crowd without really knowing what it's about
It's not secret that fandoms for any media can become insanely toxic, which puts off a lot of people
He's most likely parroting comments made by others
in the end Aria, i think it was only a matter of when rather than an if
but that takes effort from both sides
but you should aim to reach a mutual understanding
yeah I mean you don't *have* to agree on everything
yeah that never goes down well
toxic friendships are hell
yeah that person just sounds toxic
honesty is also important
In the case they don't, I think it's important to come forward and ask
yeah that's not unreasonable
of course, it's important to not have twisted expectations
friendship is a compromise, just like any relationship
Not so much with strangers you know nothing about
You have a reason to put trust in your friends
it just happens like most things
it's not "WILL YOU BE MY FRIEND"
life isn't an anime after all
and it goes from there
you click in terms of personality and vibe
you bond over similar interests
not very different from how it happens in real life
He didn't reciprocate your effort, and that's why it fell through
Like could you have been better? Yeah sure, maybe, but there's only so much one side can do before the ball ends up in the other's court
Like judo or kendo or whatever
In that case, I think a good way is to sign up for something
Exercise is tough for a lot of people to just get into like that
the wonders of halfswording
and exercise can give energy
2 years of no physical exertion is too much
Like, I'm going to sign up for kendo once I get back home
trying to pacify always leads to bad places
being real with each other is also important
being able to call each other out for bad behavior
which leads to another part of friendship that I also think is important
Sometimes they're just socially awkward, and other times they're truly wolves in sheep's clothing
The more you interact with people the more you begin to understand their nature
that's their inherent nature
all abridged series are parodies
yeah it's definitely not satire
the only people who send those are well, a lot of words I can't use here
death threats aren't criticism
melua said it best
just like anything
criticism is par for the course
it was posted in a public space where anyone can reach it
i thought it was funny too, only that the miku thing was taken to the wrong direction
okay but that's you
you could think discordgear is absolute shit and still that doesn't excuse the death threats
nobody said death threats are acceptable dude
did you talk with home advisor?
And generally, people will calmly point it out
Bad habits cans be fixed
because there's a lot of misunderstanding around the subject due to its nature
whoever explodes with rage at you just because you made a mistake once is not someone you should bother with
they'll point it out to you calmly
nobody is going to hate you just for getting their pronouns wrong by accident
it happens
you don't need to be so afraid of hurting others by accident
exactly
it can however be overblown and/or lacking depending on the situation
it's a natural reaction to perceived threats
fear isn't good or bad
Tbf you can understand why it's perceived as a negative, considering many laws beforehand were internet stranglers

but *why* did the UK decide to leave the EU in the first place
okay so excuse me for my ignorance

no empathy or understanding
the US stigmatizes anything that is different after all
phones causing cancer is still one of the most bogus non-issues people started worrying about

he's not a good character either
Well, Terfs are a thing for instance
Ask them if they want to join a server dedicated to the lord and savior Ganesha

and stop randomly believing these "people"
and yes, part of it is embarrassing
it's all part of the journey of self discovery
it's a natural part of growth as the body's sexual urges develop
hell, it's rarer to find people who hadn't
you think the people here didn't discover porn the same way?
you don't have anything to worry about, period
Nobody will ever take you seriously
Yeah dont do that
and I'd much rather laugh
well you either laugh or you cry
are you kidding? the only thing you should do with politics is make fun of them
just because you don't like it doesn't make you better than them
in my view, the gross one right now is you
so you're both assuming things you have no way to know about people you're generalizing
are you assuming everyone watches them for that?
and?
never call people gross just for enjoying a show
you wouldn't like it if someone said that about you so don't say it about others
ever
don't generalize
hence why it's a double edged sword now
but it's an archaeic way of thinking that was relevant only during the 18th century
and because you can't change the people, you have to target the guns
the guns aren't the problem so much as the people are

it's always a cultural problem

nobody is stopping you
go ahead then

and we keep on telling you that you're overthinking things or that what you're saying has no real world basis

it's like clockwork with you

well a cursory glance at the wiki page about it shows that the company and many of its executives were charged with corruption and human rights violation
that's an extreme case you don't want
you don't shut a whole system down just because some people abuse it

if this is a hill you're willing to die on, be my guest
if you're going in with such a thing, then come prepared
you're getting tired of this but you're the one who made the bold claims
why would anyone in their goddamn mind want to work there
Pemex were charged with corruption and human rights violation
so you make bold statements without having any evidence to back up your claims?
anything?
percentages?
do you have figures to show?
is this extreme minority ruining mexico?
why are you so focused on this extreme minority?
pray tell

then you should've expected bold reactions
why are you raising such a fuss over an extreme minority then?

it's not better... anywhere, really
i'd be very careful with such words
we're due for a witchhunt

ffs
extremists

stop
good luck doing that
a vpn would defeat this easily
also it'd be ridiculously easy to circumvent
this will never happen
We literally dont have a government
In a row
Here is israel, we're looking at 4th elections
You think that's bad?
it's not going to pass because it'll be impossible to enforce
that's just you being a doomer as usual
it exists in absolutely every animal and plant species on the planet
that's a natural instinct
you say that people prefer to fight, but well...
you have to thank war for the internet and personal computers for existing
and yet the vast majority of mankind's most worthwhile inventions came to be during times of war
But youd need to eat a shitton of gluten food for that to do anything
Only reason I can think of is the sugar
You use a vpn and you defeat any sort of thing like this easily
You simply cant enforce it
It'll fail just like all those other internet bills
Nah, thats not tyranny
What is it you're referring to
Extreme circumstances require extreme measures
How do you think tyrants are toppled
At times, yes
A transformation from one state to another
After all, change is the disruption of the status quo
A bit of both
why are people glorifying marx I have no idea

for those who think they're immune:
it's unenforcable
and even then that won't work because there're workarounds for that too
their best bet would be to carpet ban all vpn sites across all isps
even if it does, how does one even find out if someone is using a vpn
we've already said how a simple vpn would defeat this easily
this act won't be implemented because it's impossible to enforce

they'll go to the deep web and that's where they'll find it
because no such person would look for it on platforms like facebook or google
even the act's supposed purpose, catching child predators, would fall through
utterly impossible
it's impossible to police the internet
Next time just dont jump to conclusions
we're in this for the long haul
this whole situation is going to get worse before it gets better
it's extremely hurtful
don't play these games
yeah just tell him
the fact that people still believe the 5G thing is just amazing
"I will figure it out"
you change that to "I will do my best"
that's how you convince yourself that you've already failed
another thing you need to do is stop with all these "i don't know how"
that's the first thing
you ask your therapist of course
you bring yourself absolutely nowhere by espousing pessimism every time
we're not your therapists, but we can tell you that sometimes you need to stop whatever it is you're thinking and realize why that line of thinking is mistaken
this is what causes this constant cycle of you getting stuck in anxiety
you keep convincing yourself of things that are blatantly untrue or are grossly exaggerated
this cycle will never end
like clockwork
it's understandable that it's difficult, but you owe it to yourself to at least try
to look at the positive side of everything you do
yes, that requires flipping your thinking completely
stop looking for opportunities to bring yourself down and start looking for those that bring you up
you already know that for you, that's a great step already
you managed to finish a jrpg from beginning to end without dropping it or getting sidetracked
because every one of those is another step towards something greater
no matter how small or insignificant they may seem
having pride in your own accomplishments
to give oneself a pat on the back for a job well done
is the ability to give oneself praise
something that a lot of people are bad at
you just forgot
because a bunch of strangers on discord won't make you budge
talk to your therapist about it
the fact that you asked what makes more sense proves you learned nothing
out of all the conclusions you jumped to, you jumped to the one that's so far out it might as well be in outer space
> to tell you the truth, I haven't experienced joy or euphoria in a very long time and thats why I assume my dopamine receptors are messed up somehow
<@!302063351767498752> what did we say about assuming things that're blatantly untrue or grossly exaggerated?
it's going to get worse before it gets better
the worst thing is
not others
but that's you
online friendships don't work for you? fine
everyone gives it their own meaning
you don't get to set the meaning of a friendship of other people
also, who the hell are you to decide that lectic
well thanks for shitting on people who's friends are online
literally anyone would disagree with that
newsflash kid, life is dynamic
jesus fucking christ
isn't
there
no
you need to leave that behind
your state of mind is as static as your parents'
because you overthink everything and think everything has only one right way
your default state is being anxiety riddled
of course you're not happy
clockwork
ah okay so you're believing stuff idiots said but you argue with us when we actually tell you something smart
there's no right answer
there's no one way for stuff to work
unlike what you'd believe
the way friendship, and overall relationships work has changed considerably
you can be close friends and never have seen the person's face
no, you don't need that
society is dynamic
unlike what your parents would believe
pffttt
lifelong friends in high school
I'm not even joking
that is some boomer advice right there
wow
bwahahahahaha
i play league with my irl friends literally every day
You've been doing that a lot lately
Nice generalization again lectic
It's fine, it wasn't towards you anyway
so feel free to continue feeling yucky on your own
pretty much all GFL players here can take offense to that
pretty presumptuous to assume they're obsessed with war just because they like guns or tanks or military strategy
what
?!?!
or step away from the places where their shittiness has a platform
which is why the recommended course of action is to numb yourself as much as possible to their shittiness
and unshitting them is next to impossible
shitty people will always exist no matter how hard you try
they'll just flip you off
in the end, people won't change their minds
which is a noble thing to do, but ultimately futile
but there's nothing you can really do about it
yeah, it's a shit thing to do, using memes like "autistic kid" or "trap" or any variations
in the end, wracking your brain over every person on the internet will only end up with you losing
it's a very assholish way to put it, but the message isn't wrong
i do not envy them right now
oh geez
that requires to learn the lay of the land beforehand
in cases like that, you'd just leave the community
you can't exactly win against that
they'll just troll and insult
but in the ones where assholes reign supreme, they wouldn't care
if it's an alright community, then telling them that may help
that's the thing
don't fight battles you're going to lose
pick your battles carefully
any attempt at calling them out will lead to them just trolling you
because in a lot of places where they hang out
It also depends on where you're doing it
healthy skepticism is recommended
in times like these, fake news are rampant
it makes sense you'd eat up whatever someone will tell you
you don't know *anything* about life
you're 15
it's your paranoia and unrealistic expectations
if there's anything that'll fuck up your life permanently
let me tell you this lectic
and you have to prove that purpose
a country won't let you stay without an explicit purpose, for a start
perhaps college is cheaper and more affordable
most of the time, it's looking for opportunities that may not have been possible for you in your home country
if you're going to be moving, you generally need a real purpose to be there
you may not like your home country, but other countries aren't in a much better state either
I have to agree

a bit on the nose, but here's a few tips:
it's about working smart
these days it's not about working hard
what happened in our parents' age is *not* relevant to today
but here's an interesting fact
I'm sure a lot of us have a lot of things to say, but nothing productive will come out of it
I think we should move on
and what way to pretend they have other than to put others down?
that's what those fundamentalists do after all
the more you argue with them the more empowered they feel
you stop entertaining their idiocy
because governing isn't an objective, right or wrong process
an AI can't govern for shit
Good luck with that moral compass kid
You really are a kid, lectic
not for you lectic
in series like this, they want you to cheer for the hero by making the government/empire/kingdom/whatever even worse than he is
it's probably gonna be arifuerta level of shit
revenge porn story
of all the things they could've adapted they chose this shit
I still don't know how that even got an adaptation
oh god the kaifuku anime
Synonyms
Bigot is easier to write and remember than discriminator
You'll find that people tend to have contradictory values
if that's what you call it
you're swayed so easily i don't understand how you manage to even hold a political opinion at all
the only political leaning you have right now lectic, is turncoat
but it isn't
if only the world was so black and white
stop listening to your boomer parents and build your own future
and they can change paths even at 60 years old
people spend their entire lives trying to figure out the right path for themselves
it *is* possible to do something you enjoy *and* be proud you did it
in a shocking turn of events
because it implies that these are mutually exclusive
you know what makes that statement stupid?
I AM FINE AND IF YOU SAY WE'RE NOT FINE YOU DIE
it's not a sin to just like things
power to you man
you're a 60 year old father of 3 and like my little pony?
doing things you enjoy isn't a childish thing to do
being childish is an attitude, not a set of actions
and even then, as Nevis said, some adults never stop acting childish
as you grow and gain experience with the world and life, you'll start to understand why certain things you do and think are childish
literally everyone is a child at that age and you're no different
you're 15 years old
but that's because *you're still a child*
you are very childish
yeah, you are
and even then, nothing promises those policies will be obeyed by all members of the society
it's become less about what the goals are and more about how to label everything and sort them into different groups
political discussion has basically turned into tribalism
it's a simplification of a complex issue into a "yes or no"
people will use any excuse to leave the house these days
if he's for real then holy shit that's one dumbfuck kid
it's almost too on the nose as to how blatantly stupid this is
this sounds way too extreme to be serious
freedom of speech also doesn't grant freedom from criticism and consequence
then stop coming to us and reporting on those places
it's entirely possible he'll get it
in fact, i'd be surprised if he didn't
japan still practices the death penalty
a vocal minority is never the face of the community as a whole

how is something this important not held by the government
that makes no sense
how are prisons privately owned
cos if they *really* don't get it, you need to make it as simple as possible
it's just for simplicity
and ask them their opinion about that
"say you're a man, but you like boys and like to wear dresses"
stuff like
i think you can make it easier to understand by going about it in terms they know

Not really?
it was a very powerful video

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3FfFj_to7fU
extremely important clip that should be seen by as many people as possible
i squint my eyes at those takes because it reminds me of those people who a long time ago showed up here and went "why is gear yuri" and "gay is bad"
which is fine but like, don't dance around it with such bizarre takes
they can't admit they waifu characters
but saying you dont mind yuri and then be bothered by yuri is like yo what's up dude
like, we obviously can't thought police them
which is a little bit... eh?
to me it at times reminds me of those takes of "i don't mind yuri, but hibiki and miku getting together bothered me"
why do they care?
the underlying question in this case then would be
a full female cast that has no yuri undertones
more or less
and other, similarly phrased "I don't mind yuri/yaoi but I don't like yuri/yaoi."
I honestly wonder what you guys think about takes like this
you know

generalizing everybody who cares about tradition as drones is a pretty damn dick move
there isn't really a simple answer to this
and naturally, the question of cultural identity comes up
anyway, police and other government bodies have tried to crack down on this trend to varying degrees of success
you're adding nothing to the arguement
first of all, stop generalizing
even though these days it's considered animal cruelty
for example here in israel, the orthodox still spin a chicken over their head on yom kippur as per the ancient tradition
but many traditions are dated and no longer hold up
about keeping some traditions alive
there isn't anything inherently wrong about a cultural identity
just because you can't be arrested for what you say doesn't mean you have to be given a platform to say it
people forget that freedom of speech doesn't mean freedom from consequence
I know oversimplification is bad, but at this point, calling Trump and his administration evil doesnt feel all that outrageous
Go eat something
Low blood sugar probably
probably all the time
don't pick a fight that you can't win
in the end, it's better not to waste mental energy on things you can't control
you have to live with the fact that they exist
you can't do anything about such people
but god help you you show a nipple
it's fine to show death, blood, and violence on TV and on the news
the media is a perfect example of these skewed values
good, conservative, christian, obedient, ignorant parents vs evil satanic porn
Us vs them
and all the maniac parents who don't know anything will eat it up and sign
claim the evil porn is evil
they use the children excuse to rally people to their cause
it's about protecting their own interests
it's not been about protecting children for a while
exactly
it's always easier to simplify a picture into an us vs them scenario and rally people to the side they believe is "good"
from the outside, people seem to repeat communism/marxism/whateverism without actually knowing what they mean
took the words right out of my mouth
<@&336302034070536192>
what is the you in that clone in that case

this topic falls into the more philosophical nature of
of course it's dumb
making something gray like politics into a black and white matter
there are some laws that they attempt that're so ridiculous that you can tell from a mile away they'll never pass
Pridefall is a lot worse than just sending random people porn
Definitely a troll
it couldn't have been that it called being 70% conservative having common sense!

really?!?! I wonder what gave it that impression!
dumbfuck test

and is just going to fall through
Honestly, I don't think this movement is going to have any real effect
In fact, it's just going to create more pushback against it
trying to force this change isn't going to be beneficial to anyone
I agree with cypher on this
if that happens, this is one hell of a shit store
i don't think you'd get fired for rightly yelling at a customer

she sounds like a pleasant person
they're not the sharpest crayon in the sea that's for sure
after hanging on around 2k
within 2 months we got over 70k new infected
but after the lockdown was lifted, things went from bad to very very bad
we somehow managed through the first wave fairly well
we've had it pretty bad over here with the second wave
and a lack of conversation *is* a dealbreaker
but something like that could be a hint towards other, worse behaviors
i mean, it's not like that alone is a dealbreaker
I think honesty is important but it's tough to adhere to because it can be uncomfortable to deal with
or course that's just two of the ones that exist
ashkenazi jews are from european descent while mizrahi is middle eastern/arabic descent
kaiyo is right
the older generations don't make this any easier to deal with
when you walk through a minefield, you have to be very careful of where you step
i'm not kidding when I say that it'd take an alien invasion to cause this conflict to stop
and after everything is said and done, *then* go back up again
and then go below it
we'll legit need to reach rock bottom
it's only going to get worse before it gets better
to call it a terrible move would be an understatement
the classic "us vs them"
because a book-like narrative is easier to grasp than thousands of years of history
and easily being swayed to one side due to sensualized media
the problem begins when people only see contemporary history and not everything that came before it
as you can see, it didn't work
people way smarter and wiser than us have tried all of the options already
and naturally, it never came into effect
I'm sure that option had already been considered
well, I am stretching it a bit, cos judaism came into the picture around that time, when the kingdoms of israel and judea still existed
this conflict is as old as the mesopotamian empire
it goes beyond politics and humanities
I'd be surprised if it ended before 2100
period
our modern society can't solve this conflict
essentially, the very nature of humans would have to be changed
it'd require a complete and total transformation of the cultures and societal mindset of both sides
Even more than that
ever
I don't think this is ever going to be resolved
I'll be real with you
hell, the british actively exacerbated it back in the 30s and 40s
and unfortunately, nobody from the outside seems to want to help resolve it
i feel like that kinda minimizes the severity lol
at the end of the day, our modern world was built upon the blood of others
I'm treading carefully around this topic too because the last time it happened here, it didn't go well so I'm staying as vague and non-committed as possible
no matter how far back you go
at no point did this conflict not involve civilians
that's the sad part
it always did
you can pick any country in the world and see what events led to it being what it is
but politics, and by extension, history are never that simple
not just about this either
it's very easy to fall into the "good vs bad" narrative that is commonly presented
to understand the full scope of the reasons for the conflict, you have to go back *millennia*
it's even more complicated than that
there's a reason it's volatile
but you must tread carefully on it
the region has a very rich history, and is very interesting to learn about
yeah there's a lot
israel is a melting pot of multiple cultures
and yemenite jews
there's russian jews and ethiopian jews and sudanese jews for instance
and stubbornly die on those hills
we know what happens when people pick sides
because it's not about picking sides
by admitting you don't know, it shows you're open to learning more about it and that you understand that this issue is not nearly as simple as it's said to be
that's already a big step up because a lot of people believe they know everything just from a bunch of random news articles
it's less about what your opinions are and more than you admitted that you don't know enough about the subject
no amount of inherent quality is worth the risk of falling into their gambling schemes
honestly, no one should ever push for them or recommend them to others
sometimes even worse so
gacha games are just as bad as lootboxes

you think kissanime was the only one?
there're plenty of alternatives
nah

Plenty of gamers are right wingers as it is
Thats true
If it lionizes him then yeah, fuck them
Exactly, and we dont know how the game is going to frame him yet
We dont know anything beyond this trailer
Mostly because his inclusion has no real context
I think it's a little too early for a controversy
While I can see why this is insanely problematic
as an israeli jew, I know
Being antisemetic doesn't make you a nazi, sure, but people who are antisemetic share a lot of ideologies with nazis
scared of what exactly?
on paper, maybe
it won't
and what Denmark went through in its history is not the same as what other countries went through
because Denmark is just one country out of hundreds of others
the problem is that that model *cannot* work everywhere else
and yet Denmark still has its own fair share of problems, doesn't it?
in a fair society, all of that would've been given back
built on land stolen from the natives
you *have* to be unfair for society to work
and you know what? that very thing is unfair at its core
and we've seen how useless the police can be
because nazis and rapists were never fair in the first place
you need to come down hard on certain things even if it means being unfair
look, I can see that inherently, you have good intentions. what you want isn't bad on paper, but in reality it just can't happen
because idealism helps no one
and that's exactly the problem
but you can't
it's a pipe dream of idealists
a fair society is an impossibility from the get go
what the law sees and what society see are different things
but society views it differently
they are innocent until proven guilty
and that's what they are
*because* of how many times it has been true
but you can't just write off such an accusation
then that's when you have a case by case basis
you have to rememeber the circumstances
but in actuality? it won't
It's had its bad moments
Most of the time
Some are just louder than others
Every fandoms has its lunatics

are you any of those things?
accountants

stock owners
you know who worries about this sort of stuff?
you're not even 18
because you're still in highschool
you know why?
it's not a genuine concern no matter what way you look at it
the very fact you're even worrying about worrying about this at all at this point is the biggest question you should ask yourself
to that I say that it took them long enough
so now they're getting a divorce because they're just too incompatible
It took my parents nearly 30 years to realize they don't click anymore
there are a lot of wrongs ways though

everyone processes grief differently
and tell him about it regardless
Or perhaps take this gift to the store and change it to something else
It's nice to get a gift and all but it's clearly not something you wanted
I think you should just be honest with him
but in the end grief is grief
you dont understand gender or culture if you can spout such drivel
yes
because assuming things is part of our built in animal nature
people are going to assume things regardless of your personal wishes
Instead of accepting that your knowledge about certain things is lacking, and coming with the intention of learning, you only come here to basically rile people up on purpose
You take an insanely absolutist stance on everything, refuse to understand or accept that things have nuance, and constantly argue back and refuse to budge.
It's not just that
The person who made this list offered none of those
Like, accusing people of pedophilia is a very serious allegation that has to be backed up with evidence, anecdotal or factual
Where did this list even come from
You do realize you asking that can feel like a trap right?
but I wouldn't look up to it as favorable
when does it ever when it comes to politics
i mean
I can tell you right now that it doesn't work as intended
israeli here
that word was garbage from the moment it was created
that tweet scared us half to death
that's a relief
cluster fuck of the decade
A news outlet over here described these elections as "the most disgusting elections we've seen in a while"
It's arguably the most powerful position in the world
Im suddenly reminded of that one movie where just one guy didnt vote and it was exactly 50%-50%  so each candidate tried to butter him up
it's amazing how elections are the most opportune time to see the giant flaws in a democratic government
they just dont want trump
most people who voted for biden... didn't actually vote because they want biden
from what I understood at least
even the real people vote is just sad
everything about this election is just so nasty
has something like this ever happened in the history of american politics
but nobody actually has to do it
He's trying to force a halt
I wonder why this is legal in the first place
what a sore loser
I just don't really see the point of following these predictions
I think I'm missing something in this whole equation
this and that outlet predicted the results correctly so they're more valid?
is it like horse racing where there's money on the line for guessing right?
bragging rights?
what's the point of calling a winner or not
Yeah but
There's so much buzz around having outlets accurately predict the leanings of each state but why does this actually matter in the long run
Votes have already been entered and it's not like people can re-vote for the winner
why does it actually matter if someone predicts the way each state goes
I have to ask
World's most viewed wrestling match
that sounds fucked up
Is there like
But he's just short of the number he needs?
All votes are counted
Like
Is it possible for biden to not reach 270 seats
And he still got votes somehow
If everyone is shady, no one is
You mean there are people with non-shady political views?
A hard cap
how much would the recounts really matter
something along the lines of "gg" to put it a bit crudely
usually the winner's speech says something about the loser no?
Nevappleappleduh?
Never-die
at least half of these can be thrown away!
what do you do with all these states!
the US has too many states!
what does this say about the overall state demographics
and then gigantic red in the middle
the entire top right is blue and the entire left is blue
the split is interesting
so I've been looking at this map

he can't
it's an exaggeration to say that he can do that
biden's presidency is most likely going to be categorized by undoing all the damage trump did
hopefully if he tries something he'll be stopped
and that not eating isn't really a way to lose weight in the long run
considering the vast amounts of side effects smoking has
and is probably not recommended as an alternative to exercise
so the link isn't very direct

according to this paper, smoker tend to lose weight

Ill leave off with fuck corporations and fuck greed
And Im going on a useless tangent anyway so
We can go on about this forever
Or perhaps it's also part of this grand human design
A lot of sorrow should've already been avoided
Oh thats definitely true
But in a nutshell, we only know what happiness is when we know what sadness is
There's a whole philosophical debate we can make about this but I won't go into it now
How can we know what's right if we don't know what's wrong?
Human history has shown us that bad people are sometimes required for progress
See, the problem is
being shitty to others makes them money
It's all about the money after all
what a waste of time
it's like corporations having "concerns" about worker unions or some shit
I legit can't think of anything that'd be significant enough to be a legitimate concern
does the article at all elaborate on what these elusive consequences are?
what unintended consequences could possibly be major enough to be worth consideration?
i'm trying to wrap my head around this statement
``` about unintended consequences of trans-activism```
but I'd never ever ever ever ever *ever* trust a random list off of the internet
Major depressive disorder
there're hundreds of thousands if not millions of students
what can they actually do about that
in the extremely hypothetical case literally every student decides to not pay their debts
this amount of money is so stupidly huge that it's become meaningless
especially since it seems literally everyone and their grandma has one
is there any downside to never paying off the student debt
since these numbers are just ridiculous

people used to look up to JK Rowling due to her life story
and as Rakhi said, many times the public behavior of a person just hides a very ugly nature
not stand in someone else's shadow
you should be striving to leave your own personal mark on the world
but emulating strength of character is something that hasn't been effective for decades
It's fine to admire their wisdom or intelligence or whatnot
trying to emulate someone else can end up looking insincere, because you're so busy trying to be like them
I have to agree with Rakhi here
and they don't want to get professional help
you've done absolutely everything you could from where you are, and it didn't work
this is a real question
is there anything else you think you can do?
set the appropriate boundaries
then stop
and if you feel that you can't handle it anymore
you have to prioritize your own above all else
but you're not responsible for other people's mental wellbeing
yeah, it's extremely difficult seeing this
if they're this stubborn, there's very little else you can do
and yeah
then bring the professional to them
more than ever, now is the time to take a step back and let someone professional handle it
you alone can't take on 3/4 people's emotions
the only thing you can do is ask them to get help
you also need to realize what you can do is very limited
but
I understand that this is an incredibly tough situation

crossdresser, i think
look at it now
the swastika used to be a symbol of eastern religions
as anime, manga, and games often make use of crossdressers as a fetish tool
the term itself was super popularized in anime circles
also the juvenile mentality of "hahaha you thought it was a girl but it's actually a guy and now you're gay lmao gottcha"
thus, the "trap"
there's this belief that all the beautiful women and/or the prostitutes in thailand are in fact men looking to swindle tourists by offering sex with what they'd think is a woman but is in fact a man

I'm not above thinking that someone may try to assassinate Biden on that day tbh
Oh okay then it's what I figured then
Can Trump be arrested for endorsing an insurrection?
I gotta ask
you know
lol 4chan
can't be serious
no
WHAT
<a:confusedbu:586119489712816150>
?!!?!?!?!?!?!
I'm missing the joke here
in their minds at least
100% anti bad people cure
rebellions are what fixes everything
because you know
how did you find that out?
oh shit
platforms cutting ties now that all the potential profit they can make off him is no longer viable
but this just nails it
there was at least a little doubt beforehand
like
okay so trump supporters are actually total lunatics
WHAT THE FUCK
https://twitter.com/NBCNews/status/1349470587543040002
it's okay, everybody wants to go back in time and punch their younger self in the face for being an idiot
it means you learned
it's natural
you suddenly remember stupid shit you've done and wanna dig a hole
that happens sometimes
yep
do like britain and the cut the homeless in half
Have republicans become enemies of the state?
o......kay?
uhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
red flag right there
after what happened, barricading the building is the least they can do
not surprising
please tell me they saw the irony of this statement
```‚Äúyour best sexual partner is yourself or someone within your household‚Äù.```
are they gonna arrest you for sexing wrong?
lmao
So yes, you can dislike genocide like any reasonable person in real life, but still understand and support it *in a completely fictional setting that has no bearing on reality*
only those that cannot make that distinction become starkly affected by the media they consume
Because the average person has the ability to distinguish reality from fiction, none of these confirm what sort of person they are
You can like violent shooters like GTA, you can watch raunchy porn at your leisure, read hentai with fringe fetishes, and be interested in things like tanks, wars, and killers
The things you like watching/playing/reading/whatever are not indicative of your personality
I disagree with this in regards to the media one consumes
If that line starts blurring for you, you may want to inspect why that is
Fiction =/= reality
most case studies reveal shooters were enchanted by previous killers
that, imo, has more impact on normalization than any video game
reminder that news media often give very deep looks into the minds of serial killers and shooters
Cant say Im surprised
So trump supporters are pretty much terrorists now
You can call them awful and shit and evil and unfairly judge all the people who like them as scum, but in the end that serves no purpose other than to give them more attention
This is what keeps them in the public consciousness
If Ill be honest, I think the trends show that it's meaningless to get riled up over these sort of controversial shows
But youve seen the talks most likely. "Ohhhhh Twitter are gonna get so triggered over this ohhhhh."
I dont think it deserved an anime either really, as there are much better things that couldve been adapted
Drawing attention to it due to its infamy
And I think that was what they were going for in the first place
There's this one effect... what was it called again? Not Streisand, but another.
In any case, the controversy around Redo, just like with Arifureta and Shield Hero and Goblin Slayer did a lot to draw people in to check it out
when it turned out the event had nothing to do with Korea or the war at large
To give an example, an event in Fate Grand Order was advertised as being set in 1945, which caused an uproar in SK because of you know
But assuming it's true, it does explain some things
I don't have any evidence and I can't really pull up the articles at the moment so do take it with a grain of salt
I've read some articles that SK tends to have an irrational hatred of things Japanese
and all the stuff about fascism and holocaust imagery
it lives and breathes its controversy and both the audience and the author know it
And if I'll be brutally honest, I think too many people give stuff like Redo attention
I won't say that media doesn't contain politics because it 100% does
and even then, I personally don't really see it that way
the poor and pitiful fantasy races that have to be rescued from evil by the benevolent forces of the JSDF I suppose
people didn't throw that much of a fit with GATE when it was clearly nationalistic propaganda
like wayyyyyyy too much into it
honestly I think that's people reading too much into it
I'm jewish and I didn't perceive anything in it as remotely close to that sort of thing
that's news to me really
goblin slayer has an anti-semitic message? ü§î
moderating such gigantic servers sounds like a nightmare
And it has to be done with big numbers
For meaningful change, meaningful actions need to be done
We basically fund the CCP from the moment we were born
Globalization has led to our lives being filled with global products, many of which are Chinese made
Problem is that people *do* pat themselves on the back too often
not playing a game originating from China isn't one of those things
There are more effective ways to criticise and resist the CCP influence
what the heck is a tankie
okay I have to ask
If a leader says they'll give you what you want, of course you'll be inclined to follow them
Or at least, the problems he told them there were
People gathered to him because he found solutions to their problems
The reason Hitler succeeded so much was because he expertly manipulated the German sense of failure and the frustration and anger a lot of the Germans felt towards the honestly unfair sanctions that were put on the country
and frustration
it uses confusing language and sticks labels on things randomly
I don't like this quiz
wasn't the kyoani arsonist sentenced to execution?
the US's system creates more criminals on purpose
I've lost track of all there political labels
if an academic or scientific text uses it, then you're fine with using it everywhere else
academic texts even
yeah, in everything
just as an aside, that "because" clause is total bullshit and doesn't deserve to be adhered to in any manner. "because" is a universal word and if a school says to not use it, they're wrong period
If you have *anyone* you can contact that can get you a place to crash then take that chance
Don't force yourself to live in hell
You must take action now before the only out will be an extreme one
Feeding her madness wont make it better
If she starts threatening you or steals your stuff, you resist
You simply cannot stay with this control freak
I know it isnt as helpful but I urge you to pick a solution and prepare for the risks involved as soon as possible
You're taller than her
Keep resisting
She hit you?
Wtf
She doesn't have the guts to do anything
and according to what you said, her threats are empty
Try to at least add flavored water into this mix
I personally haven't seen a positive generalization in a while
Generalizations seem to happen mostly due to anger, misplaced or otherwise, that is unfairly applied to all members of a particular group. From what I've seen, it's evolved to have a negative connotation as most generalizations deal with the negative aspects of said groups
Which is a bit of an ironic thing to say too
Sorry, then I might be getting mixed signals in this discussion. It's in this very server that I've seen people adhere to no generalizations, but at the same time I'm hearing that not all generalizations are bad?
jews were generalized and blamed for a vast majority of germany's problems in the 30s for basically no reason
we've seen the sort of places that sort of generalization can lead
does the issue matter though? people look for any excuse, no matter how small, to cancel entire groups
and it's as idiotic and pointless as every generalization
replace men in the equation with every group ever and the problem doesn't change
it's another case of radical generalization based on stereotypes
the phrase isn't a solution in any manner and never was
yeah
as minimizing others to raise yourself is a universal taboo regardless of the groups involved
but at the end of the day it really is just venting
without actually understanding what it means
most of the people saying "men are trash" probably are only following a fad they think is cool at the moment
I don't know anything about her as a person, but in this case, the best case scenario would be for her to reflect on her actions and attitude
Others with more exposure to her can tell more about this than I can, but considering the amount of negativity directed towards her, it seems she has done things that were out of line
First impressions are key, and it seems she hasn't made many good first impressions
Which is something that she most likely brought upon herself
But from what I've heard, her attitude rubbed the wrong way with a lot of people for many reasons
I don't think there's doubt that she's probably an alright person
I don't have any eggs in this basket since I'm not active on twitter at all, but I'll give my two cents on this matter
is this still a serious discussion well, discussion?
someone funny can't possibly be a bad!
he's le funneh
it's cos he's so meme and hip!
rubbish court
innocent until proven guilty huh?
obviously the intentions of this are fine and dandy
that's not the message it brings across though
but that's basic decency
The points at legit yeah
wtf
I'm a little out of the loop
so what's the deal with coca cola right now?
with how much of a maniac she is I'm surprised a dog is allowed in the house
Cant read it with your stupid subscription thing
Goddamn it new york times
not completely, considering there are reasons unrelated to other people
I knew none and no one talked about them
When I was in like middle school, I was convinced gay people were a myth
you're making the classic mistake of letting other people dictate your life
so this is what it boils down to in the end huh?
amongst many other things
he also utterly failed in handling the virus correctly
his constant caving to ultra orthodox demands cripple the country
externally and internally
but in a nutshell, his right wing policies screw everyone over
I suppose it's common with world leaders, because there's more wrong with him than there is right with him
where do we even begin with what's wrong with him
but not what they actually stand for
they all go on about how anti-Bibi they are
the other parties genuinely don't stand for anything concrete
if only it was that easy <:YumiPanic:688429717174354012>
changes to languages, especially gendered ones, don't come easily
and other ridiculous claims
cos Jews eat babies and all that of course
but realistically it'll never happen
it's fine to want it and wish for it
this latinx thing is just never going to happen
and cultural changes don't happen overnight
language is a part of culture
even if they're taken seriously
if at all
i highly doubt there changes will come to pass any time soon
cryptocurrency was a mistake
If they lose their shit over that
Fuck those people, honestly
And all he said was that he liked the series and people started dumping on him?
18 and 17 is perfectly normal
To be perfectly honest, people losing their shit over them dating is worse
You dont want to generalize like this
how big was the sample size presented in the study?
the problem is that a small study group does not reflect the majority
hell, even 6 months would be fine
for all we know, the actual gap between them is a month
of course it's okay
you didn't say why at all
why would I assume anything about you just because you like the book?
of course
I wouldnt
but until we know what he said, it's impossible for us to accurate judge
fair enough
exactly
in what way?
defend it how?
yeah if you see someone who tries to defend it in a manner like Armis said and they're generally acting sketchy, then 100% there's something off
what you *can* do is judge their attitude and reasonings
you can't thought police them
people are allowed to like things even if they're controversial
You'll be hard pressed to find anyone who thinks it's a masterpiece or even remotely good
but it's *100% fine to like it for trashy indulgence*
yeah, the anime is revenge porn garbage
well then there you go
then you're the asshole, not them
if liking redo of healer is enough for you to insult a person and start accusing them of a laundry list of shit
just because he liked it
and apparently, due to that, he was insulted
he didn't state the reasons
the guy (according to zenbu) only ever said he liked the show
What kind of mental gymanstics did you make
How the fuck  did you reach this conclusion
sure
lol ok
then provide the full context
so why was it even raised as a point in this discussion?
well, *does it* have valuable conclusions?
so if the article is clickbait, the riddle is useless, and the sample size is tiny, how is this "study" even legitimate
To answer to that point: while media can influence people, it doesn't influence everyone equally
not only did it provide the wrong information, it's also asking it of the wrong people
then the riddle is useless
since from the information we do have, there's enough to find both sides sus
and I simply can't go ahead and accuse him (or the server) of anything until then
just to be clear, personally, I also think it's kinda sus to go ahead and defend redo for any reason. I just find that there's nothing to defend about it other than that it serves as the equivalent of junk food. Not good in any manner, but entertaining enough to pass the time.
However, I'm under the impression that we want to make reasonable arguments about the matter. As such, if the aim is to be fair as much as possible, we first need to know more about the people involved and what they said
of course, we don't know enough about what they said, but that's also a legitimate point
because the server did so despite these facts, that also raises concerns about where their priorities lie
an age gap that can be considered legitimate both legally and morally/ethically/whatever else
this led to him also being attacked by said server for this age gap
according to what Zenbu said, the guy in question raised that point. He said he's 18 and that his girlfriend is 17
the 18/17 thing
However, let's take the second part of this
having concerns is legitimate and I can stand behind it
but is there a good reason to automatically assume it's the latter?
the context is not adequate enough to make an accurate judgement
I'm sorry, but I disagree
that'd be, as plenty of people have said here in the past, arguing in bad faith
but we don't know, hence why I find it's not okay to judge without enough information
for all we know, that can be true
perhaps
until you know the exact circumstances behind what went down and what people said, you simply cannot make accurate judgements
at the same time, you can also assume they unjustly attacked someone even if their reasons were benign or nothing special
you can assume they rightly called out someone for having messed up reasons for liking it
but that's *also* an eyebrow raiser
what does this mean? I dunno
but at the same time, zenbu stated that the server is known for its toxicity
fair enough
hence why you *ask them*
just because they can doesn't mean they influence everyone equally
of course, because not everyone accepted those laws
Well, if the people are starving, they become desperate
people killing each other and dying was pretty normal
BC and all
you'd think so, but consider this is ancient times
to murder cults
from the ten commandments establishing the basic rules of Anti-being a dick
of which they have across the entire spectrum
however, they're also valuable for the values they tried to instill
they are
and unfortunately, we live in the timeline where the accepted interpretation is the one we know
and like all books, they are open to interpretation
some of which were even scholars and scientists of the time
they were written by a lot of people over a long period of time
the holy books weren't written by just one person after all
indeed
when you have no food, nothing to lose, and everything to gain, why *not* join the murder cult?
poorer countries tend to turn towards extremism more than others
also economical context to it
not what I meant
They do! But they also have not vile shit in them, but that part tends to get ignored in favor of arbitrary made up "laws" that were invented for religious establishments to maintain their power
people don't need excuses to be awful these days
of course, it's just an excuse at this point
And yeah, it's a damn shame the Bible/Torah/Quran/whatever your version of it is, is being used as justification for atrocities
Yeah there's very much a difference between anime fans just being annoying online and religious extremism
but romanticising that possibility is a job for the fiction writers
in an optimal world, perhaps
I don't think the mid 20th century could've gone without a major conflict
and more inevitable
Less justified I'd say
If there even is one
And unfortunately, we may never know the answer
Thats a good question
Who knows? We could've ended up with someone even worse
He may have been a monster, but Hitler was a smart (and very lucky) man
heh
I think it's both
and by pointing at the groups of marginalized people in their midst and telling them "those are the bad guys" was scarily effective
Hitler and co knew they needed *something* to blame
using the desperation of the german people after WW1 and finding scapegoats for their suffering
For a good example of organized extremism, the nazis fit
as you said, they have historical and literary context
but for the region they were written in, they were important
cos on the other side of the sea, you got Aristotle and Plato discussing ethics without them
at least for the people they were written by and for
They didn't invent them of course, but what they did was organize them and make them clear
not what I meant
it's a fascinating topic
quite a nice debate if I do say so myself
just a debate
I don't think there's any fighting happening here
I think we're a bit at an impasse here because we don't have enough concrete examples to prove our claims
Because a lot of scientific advancement and technology happens *because* of war, not *in spite* of war
Hmmm, I wonder
I know someone who died because a blood clot that travelled to her brain formed after a seemingly minor surgery on her hand
it's not something you can really see coming
blood clots tend to be symptoms of a different underlying condition
The UN also needs to be rebuilt from the ground up
and you need to basically trace back where the supply comes from and why it's going the way it is
yeah
that's a different topic altogether imo
still exists, but not as egregious
there's also a relatively low amount of vaccine denial
people have been crediting the various HMOs we have here, all of which worked pretty damn effectively with the public and each other and created a working system of vaccinations
yeah the vaccination rate here is crazy
You got this!
top notch
```Other salmon-themed names reported in local media included "Salmon Prince," "Meteor Salmon King" and "Salmon Fried Rice".```
it's so beyond stupid, just for that they deserve to be slapped
It's wrong factually, morally, ethically, and everything else-ally
I fucking hate those asshats who compare the lockdowns to the holocaust
And that most importantly, something is happening
Great to see things are looking up
Nice!
It's a serious allegation to make but not one without basis
Being an accomplice to it and/or ignoring it's been happening and/or trying to hide it doesnt paint her in a good light
it won't have any real value in the real world, it'll become officially separate from actual money, and will only be useful in underground dealings
crypto can go die

saw the backlash and just turned tails
sounds like they were backtracking <:GudaShrug:641769332401242112>
Or an elitist or a contrarian
You seriously can't have reasonable grievances against things without being called an idiot and a child
Taking criticism against it or the creator as a personal insult
People really turn the media they consume into part of their identity
Serious or not, I somewhat agree with that take
How the heck do shrimp tails get into the processing line
Personally I had more bad experiences with fandoms than with haters
why can't you say?
Probably
Money
they're a private business most of the time iirc
hopefully they don't do anything too bad
never fun to deal with cops like that
damn, that's anxiety inducing
people will just find workarounds like always
I don't think this program will be that useful
eh
Conservatives tend to believe the monotheistic interpretation of homosexuality is the only real one
Socrates didn't die because he was gay lol
Nixon was an idiot lol
you know shit's bad when even a rightwinger finds their behavior to be shit
considering who they are, they probably wanted him to violate orders so they could kill him
like, at some points it becomes so insanely ridiculous that i'm convinced that at this point they don't so much as believe what they say as much as they say it to get the funding
exactly that
that
what is even happening in poland right now

not surprising from a study from 1976
And go around asking others about their own experiences
Don't go into something life changing without being 100% on board with it
I think the very fact that you have doubts shows that maybe you should take a step back and reconsider it
*you're* alaskan
split it into two so you either buy both games or find someone who has the other version
Old Pokemon games
that's not any different from let's say
I mean
>earth day nft
>nfts are widely known as gigantic environmental disasters
please tell me they saw the irony
and with a government like china's, being arrested and being dead might as well be the same thing
the government arrests you
and if the players don't kill you
yeah
the chinese playerbase is crazy enough that they'd probably hack mihoyo's database, figure out all the people who work there, and murder them in their own homes
but they could've easily been next
it's bad enough
trying to kill the founders is one thing
i have the utmost sympathy and pity for the developers for this
this could've easily been kyoani 2.0
and mihoyo caving make sense because not caving has become a very real threat to their lives
Can't actually blame you for hating yaoi. Heck, I've seen people hate yuri just as much, because the Japanese portrayal of gay relationships, in anime, games, and manga at least, tends to be  more fetish in nature. You can count on one hand the amount of times they portrayed it in a more realistic, down to earth manner. It's a common criticism against the medium so cant't fault you for that.
one of the most racist countries in the world
and Asian Americans
not to mention against African Americans
also recognize that racism against Native Americans is still ongoing
accountability for America? hell yeah!
i don't see how this is a problem to be quite honest
having an interest in other cultures and wanting to explore them and use them in writing isn't a crime or morally wrong
Cultural appropriation only applies when the intent for using said cultural aspect is used for mockery and or insult or racism or any other negative things like that
it feels like appreciation all too often is confused with appropriation
yeah
and it's a wonderful thing, having that cultural contact
yeah
but wanting to go to India, wearing a sari, participating in a ritual, and following their traditions through a service they themselves offer, and learning as much as you can about gurus there so you can be as accurate as possible is not appropriation
being an idiot and not doing the research on gurus is one thing
the picture you painted however felt far too generalized imo
of course
at that point it's a case by case basis so that's understandable
okay so let's say India
they literally sell it as an attraction
yes, they do
hell, they want you to come and experience it
why wouldn't you want to go to japan and experience some of the things you looked at personally?
yeah but if you're interested in let's say japanese culture
how do you become truly interested in a foreign culture without experiencing it for yourself?
they use their own culture and heritage as a drawing point
and the latter is bad how? i honestly fail to see how the japanese letting people wear kimonos and watch/participate in festivals and have a leisurely taste of japanese culture is a bad thing
isn't that the point of tourism though?
okay but what if it functions as a gateway for the person to start being interested in shinto and exploring it and studying it and the cultural context behind it? sure, their initial motivation may be super simple, but it's through these simple contacts that real interest starts to grow
cos by god, twitter is one hell of a toxic platform
especially on twitter
there's no need to be so scared of people on the internet
platonic feelings are a thing that exists
finding something cute doesn't immediately mean sexual/romantic/whatever else attraction
nobody is going to cancel you even if you did like the character
you don't need to be so terrified of it
well that explains quite a lot
you're giving too much weight to what other people think
there's nothing wrong with that
it's fine to be uncomfortable with certain content
then you give those people the middle finger
especially those on twitter
other people can go to hell
so let me tell you this
you're so deathly afraid of what other people think of you it's affecting everything you do
the only people who are so strongly affected are the people with problems that make them susceptible
just like porn doesn't turn people into rapists
violent video games don't turn hapless teens into murderers
to give an example
Fiction affects reality *only* for the people already susceptible to questionable content
I will repeat myself so I'm clear
you assuming you're a creep because of this fuck ass card directly implies you think everybody else who has it is also a creep
the percentage of people like that is a lot lower than you'd expect
they affect reality for the sort of people who're already susceptible to questionable content
Reformist sects are common in every religion
The first step is to reject those stigmas
Unsurprisingly, as that has been the case in every country throughout history
and then it depends
whether they're the same inside is a different question
*to be fair* though, fandoms are always awful when you look at them from the outside
of course
unsurprisingly, the bigger it is, the worse it gets
some fandoms are worse than others in that regard
in some ways, yes
i'll be brutally honest
other people don't dictate what you like
I would disregard their opinion on anything and enjoy the thing without giving a shit about what they think
fandoms are the worst and they don't deserve any credit for anything. they don't do anything worthwhile, they're full of themselves, they're full of elitists and assholes, and they're in general toxic communities that're circlejerks around the thing they worship like it's christ and god help anyone who disagrees with them
you can be a fan of something while still calling it out for its flaws
yes
and they don't stop to think about their actions
if it helps, people who're toxic don't have self awareness of their toxicity
bad apples stand out more than regular ones
but that's as expected
I wish I could say the same, but my personal experience has been more evened out than that
the wording is a little strange but I assume this is a good thing?
They work and work and work and at least they give something back
Forced labor is probably the most reasonable solution
so both videos are equally worthless now
All of these are interceptions

A bit too fantastical in both cases
At this point, neither side gives a shit about what the rest of the world thinks
Both sides have more to gain from fighting, regardless of what the international community thinks
Thats the hard truth
Peace isnt useful for profit and politics
So there's nothing left but more fighting
But even peace was rejected
In an ideal world, the option of peace would come much more easily
Bombs exploding over my head is normal, not worrying
And it's sad how desensitized we all became to a reality of constant conflict
As we can see, none worked
I believe people smarter than us already considered all the options
And thats just modern history
Not its fundamentals
Only its shape changed
It's a vicious cycle
There is never going to be an end to this
Im mad you summarized it so shortly and accurately
already confirmed at least 1 death and ten injured
the building was shaking
explosions rang out above us like crazy
very scary stuff
Can confirm, experienced it myself
People showed way too much faith in a company whose entire success was behind exactly one game
see, the only people to whom the rules apply are the only one who cared about the rules in the first place
and Israel would be their first target
because if Iran ever manages to get one, it's a straight line to a bomb
there's a reason why Israel constantly hits Iran's nuclear plants
nah, they sleep on the real problems and cry about I dunno, anime titties
you're saying that as if the UN or the EU had any sort of real authority
yeah but the problem is that nobody wants to solve it
Putin would've turned the whole area into glass
imagine if the Russians had to deal with this
juicy series of events for pushing agendas
it's a great narrative to follow after all
and go back to crying about something else
pat themselves on the back
all they know is to point and say "nu nu nu bad"
so no reason for them to do anything now
please, international forces have done absolutely nothing so far
and I fear this may be the start of something even bigger
You say that like it ever stopped
had the 3 am wake up call
I'm in Tel Aviv so I felt it mostly yesterday
stay safe man
what can they do? come in on planes and ships, capture netanyahu and his cohorts, and take over? nah
what can they actually do here though
you can call it cynical, but this sort of cynicism has been reality for decades
when in reality they wouldn't care if Israel and the Palestinian territories destroyed each other
international communities putting up the facade of actually caring about the situation
cos they're all talk
that's why nobody respects their authority
it's almost a given at this point
the same exact way they dodge the situation everywhere else
Hamas have repeatedly proven they don't want peace
the perfect position to be for a militant group to rise and stir them into a frenzy
so they're cornered and helpless
for all the support people show them, there's yet to be a single country or organization that, to my knowledge, has given them something of value
Arab countries, the UN, the US, what have you
nobody wants to solve their problems and nobody wants to take them in
neighouring arab countries, who should be their closest allies, do nothing to assist them beyond providing them with bombs
nobody is giving them solutions or finding reprieve for their desperation
nobody really supports them or provides them with relief
nobody cares for their wellbeing
nobody wants to help them
is that nobody actually cares about the Palestinians
the hard truth that nobody wants to admit
people forgot about Hong Kong once it was no longer the trend to talk about it
probably not
people smarter than me have most likely tried to no success
If I had the answer to that, it'd have already been done ages ago
slacktivism at its highest
until the next international incident so they can spread their fucking tiktoks and tweets and pretend to give a shit about people's suffering
once this ends (for now), people are going to forget about it in about a week
and you know what's the most amusing thing about this is?
cos it sure ain't a political one
the only duty anyone has to the UN is a moral one
unfortunately, the reality is very different
I understand Cypher's position, because he believes that the international community would jump in to change something
all they do is sit and talk and wave their dicks around as if they matter
they don't help *anywhere*
they don't help in North Korea
they don't help in China or Hong Kong or Taiwan
they don't help in Gaza
what has the UN actually done to help *anyone*
but what have they actually done to help them
and you know what? it's fine and dandy to be supportive of them, sure
but in conflicts? they sit on their ass
sure, they do a lot during natural disasters
because they have none
nobody respects the UN's or the EU's authority
like what's her face? the head prosecutor of the UN who wanted to charge Israel with war crimes? Legit everyone gave her the middle finger and told her to fuck off
fat load of good that did
a call to this, a call to that
the problem is that *all* they do is talk
glorified nu nu nu bad
see Cypher, that article is the very definition of what I said
and it's that exact history that shaped this mentality
so I'm right in the thick of things
israeli jewish even
our name is dragged through the mud so often we've mostly become numb to it
at this point, we're used to it
and the mentality has always been there
but it isn't that easy
If it was just a case of there being an overarching bad guy, it'd be easy to solve
I wish it was that simple
stay safe and take care
the possibility of peace died with Rabin, yeah
and that we have no faith that any organization or country will jump in to change the status quo
you're just not entirely aware that we've been through this song and dance enough to know exactly how it'll unfold
Nah i know you're not dismissing
Trump's only skill in life is making things worse
Go in, chase out, capture, or eliminate Hamas leaders, and take over the area
which they should do
the only place they'll go is Gaza
well, it also depends on where it's sent
you need to do it in time
but yeah
a nuke before its reactions began is just a bunch of flying metal
shoot it down, I suppose
I feel like countries will be able to detect a launch and its target even before it left the silo
also I think launching one with malicious intent will be difficult
unless they don't mind sacrificing their entire country for the sake of using one
even if Iran somehow gets nukes, they'll be too afraid to use them
the damage you inflict to the enemy will be minimal compared to what your country will go through
not only that
there's too much to lose from using one
nukes are a dangerous gamble nobody wants to make
and I might be exaggerating, but it feels that the ugliness will come as a third world war
and things will turn very ugly very quickly
it'll keep going and going and going until *something* gives
it doesn't feel like it'll ever end
that's why cynicism has set it
on *both* sides
and that is difficult to impossible
because the change that needs to happen is a deep social one
and yet none succeeded
and people smarter than all of us have already thought of all possible solutions
as you can see, it's not only an old conflict, it's also multi layered
and religion is also what drives the Palestinians
and very very very significant for many many people
it was *really really really* big
and as much as we look down on religion
was religion
because a big part of the motives that led to the creation of israel
but naturally, it didn't work
not in the US, but in Ethiopia
that's already been considered
see, the thing is
as incompetent as the league of nations
the UN is a joke
kinda like how the geneva conventions aren't so much a rule as they are suggestions for the parties who actually care about them
interesting
Well, all things considered, whenever such a war happens, I think there will already be contingencies in place
just heard one explode in the air
yep
starting to get very close to here
Speaking of, barrage has renewed
entirely possible I wouldn't be here if it didn't exist
yesterday would be very different if we didn't have it
quite revolutionary if I do say so myself
Iron Dome is the system that intercepts rocket launches
yeah this is all very theoretical
and yeah, in a war where a nuke is being used, all parties involved will already have scrambled forces
on an aircraft it'll be even more difficult
and that's if you launch it on its own
if it has to travel a long distance then the window is much bigger
does that mean the entirety of the US should go back to Britain?
the entirety of the US is built on stolen Native land
We can use a different example
Very ancient history, in fact
Very loud booms
Update, ran to shelter
You can add... basically every major country to the list
You haven't heard it cos it stopped being relevant
BDS is a joke
BDS never worked
this shambled messed of nothing
more like
"Government"
or Hamas
They don't trust the Palestinian Authority with it either
it's a chokehold that Israel wants to avoid
there's only a few dozen miles between the sea and the Green Line
There's an unfortunate strategic aspect as well, however
Seriously, there's legit nothing there that's worth all this shit for
I feel a necessary evil will have to be committed in a large scale for something to change
it didn't work
tell the politician that that's already been tried
Or maybe you jumped to an idiotic conclusion to try and appear superior
are ad hominems all your'e capable of?
armis
Yeah except no one will ever say that seriously or ever be taken seriously by anyone
Now that's a claim
like the death camps in China
to the detriment of other, similarly worthy causes
in every regard
always
The problem we find is that there's always hyper focus on what Israel is doing
Do you truly believe that?
Truly?
All of the evils you claim Israel is committing or committed is being and has been committed by all major countries you know of
or Burma
or North Korea
I suppose China isn't a thing that exists
Hamas fires their rockets from within civilian centres
https://www.un.org/unispal/document/auto-insert-182027/
just like old times
Oh I'm sorry, so me defending myself is wrong but armis essentially going "Ayyyy lmao" in serious discussion after once again doubting my integrity *while i'm in hiding* is fine
<@&336302034070536192>
I will do whatever I damn well please considering Armis has a tendency to go for the throat in every discussion
as if news cant be biased
it's easy to look at random news articles and say they're inequivocal truth
it's easy to point fingers
and know nothing about the nuance of the conflict
It's easy to look from the outside and see it as a black and white deal
pot calling the kettle black
*again*
Politics is the science of agendas after all
Thanks
but because it's somewhat unique, it's difficult to grasp
Our perspective is not something I wish any of you have to experience
Until you yourself feel what it's like to get bombed and run for shelter, and to have gas masks sent to your homes, and to go through every day not knowing if you're gonna be alive the next
And as much as we understand your perspectives, our shoes are a tad bit too heavy to fill
I don't wish on any of you what we're going through right now
nothing good comes from talking about it
this topic is too heated for positive outcomes
I knew this wasn't a conversation worth having but it happened anyway
tbh, same
they provide weapons
Russia definitely have stakes
clearly he hasn't stopped smoking those joints
Smoking a whole lot of joints apparently
And all the other Diasporas and exiles and inquisitions and what have you
Hm?
places closer to Gaza though have it much worse
there was one alarm today here, but so far it's been quiet
Yeah, if it's true
if that's true, then the IDF just stopped a possible murder
Again, Hezbollah
But before you start making claims, do make sure you understand who're the people you're dealing with
Of course
they're not here to parade for peace, to put it lightly
When the name Hezbollah is attached to them, then you can make a very educated guess
*another* terrorist regime
As Kat just said, it's possible Hezbollah volunteers
You mock them, but you don't know what their intentions were
Does it actually matter at this point?
So who came first? The chicken or the egg?
it was never that simple
but it's not that simple
It's easy to make a romantic narrative out of it and have one side be the good guys and one side be the villains
Hell, just recently, an Arab leader encourages them to pick up knives and guns and to go out and kill jews
Unfortunately, the "support" they tend to generate involves suicide bombing, terror tunnels, stabbing families while they're having dinner, kidnapping soldiers and people for ransom, burning buildings, cars, and shops, and others
because nobody truly does
They're really stuck under the thumb of a horrible regime and they don't feel like anyone can help them
I really do
Honestly, I pity the Palestinians
Yeah
if they did, Gaza would be a much nicer place
their intent isn't to safeguard the welfare of the people
they're a militant regime
to call what they have "palestinian support" is a bit overplaying it, from what I've seen
Hamas will go down fighting and will sacrifice a lot of people just for spite
It's going to be a bloody process no matter what way you go about it
no sir
that definitely doesn't sound like something that could totally backfire
the less of Hamas there is, the better
if it's true, good
I've also seen some stuff on the news about that
no matter what way you look at this, you won't find a definite right answer
which makes it even more complicated
jumping to conclusions is the whole reason why this whole discourse is so shitty
since we only go by "he said they said", we don't want to jump to conclusions
but if they had every intention to cause harm, then the IDF acted reasonably
If they were just protesting without harm, then sure, that's a dick move
that's honestly the best case scenario
They scare them away with nobody getting hurt
that's why it was warning shots
It's not like those rioters had giant flags that said Hezbollah
They don't have any way to be sure
what I had a problem with was that you automatically assumed things and took a stance without actually looking at the whole picture
whether it's tunnels going under the border or facilities within civilian areas
But what proceeds to happen is that those very same officials use their influence to gather funds to smuggle in more weapons and to build more military instillations
Yeah. The IDF mostly doesn't bother with Gaza unless something starts there
It's not that simple
Exactly
A bloodless solution that'll magic this conflict away
Do give a solution
Then again
Of course it's horrible. We all feel how horrible it is
We're saying that *this is the reality and that nobody found a better solution*
Nobody is justifying anything
Matt for the love of god
If you have a realistic solution, then say so
I'd like to know that as well
What I take from this is that you're treating Hamas like an off-hand thing whose effect on the conflict and the poor livelihood on the Palestinians is minor
And yeah, Shemmy got it right
and once someone is radicalized, you can't unradicalize them
They used the lulls between 2014 and now to strengthen their military
If they did, the funds they used for war would've been used for rebuilding
they never did
They don't have the Palestinians' welfare in mind
It grants them power to keep the people radicalized
Hamas want this conflict to continue because of that cycle you spoke of
exactly
Not to mention the whole Jerusalem fuckery
and delaying it
but he isn't because his supporters keep on blocking it
Which is why he's supposed to be on trial for corruption
Netanyahu gets to keep his golden seat as long as he caves to the far right
Which is why that happens in the first place
There's nothing to gain from them except more political power for the far right in the Israeli government
I won't deny that the settlements were a horrible, misguided, and stupid idea
They don't want to negotiate because the conflict works in their favor
That's why they're constantly in hiding
Of course not
Do you think Hamas leaders will come to a table, sit with Israeli leaders, and talk?
Do you think negotiations with such a party are realistically acheivable?
and again, Hamas is a militant group that is an internationally recognized terrorist organization
They're now separate entities
the PA have no authority there anymore
but Hamas took control of Gaza from them
That already exists and negotiations with them already happen
That's what the Palestinian Authority is for
It takes two to tango
Do you think Hamas wants to negotiate?
next question
Okay, that's a start
We are telling you that the reality of the situation is this
You're the one arguing in bad faith now
nobody is putting lives on a scale
for the love of fucking god
Matt
suicide bombings in the mid 2000s also come to mind
radicalized people sneaking into Israeli towns and murdering people happened all too often
Unfortunately, in more than a few cases, they did
nobody wants this
but until an alternative is found, this is reality
We can sit here all day screaming about how horrible it is
but again, what solution do you have?
And yes, civilians died. It's horrible and I won't justify their killing that it was to shut down those military facilities
I ain't saying it worked perfectly, but they tried
thus the IDF used several tactics to mixed success to try and get civilians away
Not shutting them down means letting them use those facilities to attack Israeli citizens
Knowing that the IDF will be forced to attack there to shut them down
You see, it'd be that simple if Hamas weren't intentionally building their facilities within those civilian areas
They're not willing to negotiate with each other, much less with Israel
and it's most likely already been considered
but again, the losses would make it not worth it
and that's basically charging into Gaza enmass and taking it over by force, capturing, chasing out, or eliminating Hamas leaders on the way
The only solution I feel that is remotely attainable will cost too many lives
I wish I had the answer to that
and the many centuries before that, yeah
clearly, they didn't use it
and between us, I'm fairly certain people smarter than us have already thought of that solution
It's unattainable
I'm sorry Lank, but your solution is unrealistic in the existing climate of the region
As it served Netanyahu to turn the citizens against the Palestinians
for those exact reasons
Yep, they did
Thus leading to them electing officials who do respond in kind
If such a thing happens, it's the Israeli citizens who're getting radicalized against the Palestinians
Remember that it's a two way street
That's as good as telling Israel to sacrifice its civilians
Take the hits without retaliating? What country on this god forsaken earth would ever take that lying down?
for the simple matter that Hamas don't want to slow radicalization
I'm unfraid it's an unattainable solution
It's good for politics
War is good for profit after all
there are a lot of additional parties who definitely want it to continue
I'm sure a bunch of twitter links are a proper replacement for actual research
Someone should write a book about this
What an incredible romantic narrative
incredible display of solidarity
Click this button to magic the problem away!
That'll save the Palestinians
I'm sure all the feel good slacktivists feel like they're doing their honest part by clicking a button on a website
rinse repeat till the heat death of the universe
until the next international incident
Once this all ends people will forget about it in about a week
It definitely is a challenge
Hamas really is a foot note for people in this whole deal
I'm sure it'll be effective like all the others
Cool story
then it's fair
Equalize the KDA ratio
I suppose turning off the Iron Dome system is the first step for us hm?
https://www.ynetnews.com/article/HJQrJ1TOu
It reminded me just how little people truly understand the topic
Yesterday was several levels of exhausting
It could've been a lot worse here, but it could've also been a lot better
i have mixed feelings about that statement but sure
It took a murder to finally pinpoint their location
Hamas built a giant network of tunnels right under the border and nobody noticed
Two rounda right after the other
I wish we could take our mind off of it, but I can't exactly disconnect lest I won't hear the siren
<:Teedus:632320401397252107> old but gold
What the flying fuck
Until it happens again and the cycle repeats and repeats
It'll all blow over in about a week and a week after that people will already forget about it
And just let people spew their whatever
At some point it comes to a place of thinking whether it's even worth trying to explain
People turning the conflict into a romantic narrative, featuring the Freedom Fighters for Free and Fair against the Evil Empire of Evil Doom
All because we gave explanations of things outsiders didn't know, didn't think about, didn't consider, or didn't want to know
People doubting our integrity, our morality, our ethics, our view on human life, and what have you
It's difficult not to be snappy when we're basically the only two people who have any real perspective of it from the other side and had to weather a storm of accusations and unsubstantiated/ignorant claims constantly for the last few days
Fun stuff
So logically I assume that the vast majority of the attacks are on point
What we do know is that in the vast majority of the attacks, Hamas operatives *were* killed, and that when a particularly high ranking one was eliminated, Hamas publicly confirmed it
I admit it's iffy
All we really know is that army intelligence figured out those locations through various means (Israel's cyber branch is pretty fearsome), and since we can't exactly go in there to see what was inside, that's all we really have going for it
For that, I don't have much of an answer
Ah
Why would they admit having facilities in those buildings if admitting would just give Israel legitimacy?
But what if they purposefully avoid confirming anything because it serves their purposes?
just read the Hamas Covenant
the people's wellbeing is about the same level as that
equality is the last thing on their mind
I'll come back to this channel in a month when this all blows over
You know what? Nevermind
<:MikuSigh:688429722799308883>
everything
who they are, how they rose to power, what they stand for, what they've done
If you don't like Hamas then you need to be fully aware of what they're doing
in an ironic case of not trying to come to a mutual understanding
With all due respect, you're not willing to see our point of view either
*That* does more damage to them
In short, it's turning a blind eye to a major factor in this entire conflict
to only blame Israel and to downplay Hamas's involvement is a *direct* ignorance of one of the primary reasons of the Palestinians' suffering
*however*
I get that and I support that view
I am 100% willing to admit that Israel is responsible for a lot of terrible shit that was pushed for by this fuck ass non-government we have led by that tyrant Netanyahu who himself pushes for radicalization against the Palestinians
that's the fact
they don't want peace
when such a group is in control of people's lives, what do you think will happen?
a fundamentalist, terrorist organization who, as we said, directly contribute to radicalization and call for murder and destruction
that alone explains a lot about their and their mindset
Hamas are a *terrorist* organization
You said it yourself
where do you think they got their 15k rockets and build their giant network of tunnels?
care for infrastructure?
build buildings?
what do you think they did between 2014 and now?
but Hamas are *directly* contributing to the Palestinians' suffering
Yes, a lot can be traced back to Israel
That's the problem Lank
You want me to support the Palestinians in everything and condemn Israel for everything?
what? you want me to wholeheartedly support Israel so I can be the villain here?
and those truth make this situation more difficult
simple as that
We see truths that you don't
and again, for the billionth time, explaining what's happening is not justifying it
and again, for the millionth time, I am not justifying anything
but there are *reasons* they happen and you need to understand why those reasons happen at all
Of course I find the IDF's actions horrific!
then what the fuck do you expect me to do?
That's why this is a difficult situation because yes, the people dying is horrific and we will never justify their deaths no matter the cause
As for Hamas, it's extremely important to not downplay their involvement in the Palestinians' suffering
While I understand what you're going for, you also need to be careful as you could be directly implying more israelis should die to even it out and make it fair
if you can't tell the fucking difference, that's on you, not us
There's a clear distinction between them
Explanations are *not* justifications
Why solutions don't come easily because it's not as clear cut as the media makes it look like
All we've done is explain what we know and why this situation is a lot more complicated than you think it is
Nobody here has been justifying anything
I don't take this sort of shit lightly and I won't stand for these sort of accusations
And if you accuse me one more fucking time of this shit I will be contacting the mods
you assuming this is your own damn problem
i did not
No
We've had this conversation every single day and I've explained, *clearly*, that I don't justify it
I've done nothing to deserve that kind of treatment and I find that sort of accusation disrespectful to the extreme
I would very very appreciate it if you didn't accuse me of something that horrific
Lank
with all due respect
We've already had this conversation so I won't start that up again
Whether there are exceptions is beyond me
Our reality is fiction and our experiences are irrelevent
But from the way you've spoken about this, and the way you've decided to demonize us, being Israeli here seems to no longer be acceptable
Ironic, considering this is supposed to be a space that is supposed to accept the experiences and reality of people from all over the world
But you chose to disregard our opinion *and* experiences in favor of the narrative you've chosen to create for yourselves
Strangers justifying conflict and murder and mass death, when all we've done is explain as evenly as possible what we've experienced
We might as well be strangers now in your eyes
But once the accusations started coming, I realized that was never the case
I genuinely believed we could've had an actual discussion and speak of this in a civil manner
Proven by the amount of times we've had to reiterate the same explanations only to fall on deaf ears time and time again
Once we've said something you didn't like, at that moment, you decided we're not worth listening to
We're the killers justifying murder now
because to you, we're part of the problem
But you choose you don't want to
And we're trying to explain and pour everything out here so you can see
Instead of choosing to try to stop, think for a second of how we, who live in the heart of this conflict, try to show you that it's so much more of a heartbreaking tragedy than it already is
Yet you close your eyes and ears, choose to burn those bridges with us for the sake of *your* moral superiority
And it's absolutely painful to see people you know here come at you and accuse you of horrible shit just because I'm trying my hardest to get you to understand why this is such a problem
How we're also tired from all this conflict and have been for the whole time we've been alive
I'm saying all of this because it truly matters to me you all understand what we're also going through and how we're seeing it from our side as well
I didn't sit here to argue with you to have some moral superiority or to prove my mighty centrist attitude
We know each other and you know that everything I say comes only from the heart
I've been with some of you years for years already
What really hurts me personally the most in all this is that we've known each other here for a long time
And I'll say the next thing for whoever bothers to read it:
I'm sure that'll save the Palestinians
Continue to have fun as you do
Since reiterating everything at you again and again proved to be completely pointless, then I don't see any reason to entertain this idiotic circus anymore
And from what I can see, you feel better when you know nothing
*again* showing you know nothing
And through all of that post of yours, not once have you even stopped to say anything about Hamas
Much rather do that instead of accuse and accuse and blame
And I will keep both siding and I will not be accused of justifying murder by any fuck here or anywhere
Say what you will and think what you will
Then feel free to say what you will
I won't be turned into a radical by anyone
I will fucking both sides
So yes
And instead of turning a centuries old conflict into a romantic narrative of with heroes and villains, remember that there are people behind both sides and that people are also complicated
You will come to understand
maybe then
and then
Why it's problematic and multi-layered
Where it originiated from
Understand how both players are responsible for the situation
*See* that it isn't a simple matter
You want to help them? You want to show you actually care? Do you goddamn research into everything
that your ignorance, *your* taking sides is *directly* contributing to the Palestinians' suffering
that not only are you not seeing everything, you're directly fed half the truth or selective parts of it
And you don't stop to think that your view might, just might, also be biased
We're the evil fucks who justify murder because we tell you something isn't simple
and when people tell you that it's *not* simple, we're the villains now
It's easier to look at something you're not directly involved in, think it's a simple matter, then pass judgement stubbornly
because it's easier that way
Having to explain what we know and people outright ignoring us for a narrative they've already devoted themselves to and refuse to budge on
because I knew it'd go down like this
This is why I loathed to talk about this subject here
*this* is what I mean by you not listening to us
Hamas *never* wanted negotiations
but we also know that negotations *cannot* happen unless *Both* sides want it
Of course we know Israel is a major player! *WE FUCKING KNOW THAT AND WE ADMITTED IT OPENLY*
We hate that fuck and everything he stands for and I won't be surprised if he fucking instigated this shit so he can avoid being convincted for corruption!
We tried to vote these fuckers away but they have too much sway!
We fucking hate bibi and his cronies!
All the fucking time!
But we do criticise!
once you have bombs exploding over your heads, you can sit on your high horses
so no, I WILL NOT FUCKING STOP BOTH SIDING AND NO FUCKING PUNK WILL TELL ME OTHERWISE
it's so easy to look from the outside and take a side
and I'm sick and tired of having to listen to this echo chamber that pats itself on the back
that you genuinely believe we stand for murder and justify it
but we're both continuously ignored and get accused of horrible shit for nothing because you're so deadset on us being shit people that you refuse to listen to anything we have to say
and we sit here, every day, telling you again and again that you're not seeing the full picture
and refusing to acknowledge this fact is a direct contributor to the elongation of this conflict
This is not a romantic narrative of good vs evil, as much as we all want it to be
People who're horrendously uninformed about who they are and that hurts the Palestinians a lot
thank you
I'd also like to take this offer actually
Thank you Lily
Of wasted taxpayer money?
What dont you want another free day? <a:HAMDANCE:701127155517489192>
And redo this whole thing again
Or we just get 5th election <:GudaShrug:641769332401242112>
Yep
Everything is a political tool for him
Bibi is very very good at inciting people
They might very well sacrifice the LGBT to get rid of him
But it's a difficult situation
And afaik they dont have any orthodox members to deal with
It's made up of people who dont want him
Thats why the new government that is trying to form even exists
Unsurprisingly
Right wingers do
He said fuck you to everyone else and catered only to the orthodox
Thats how he stayed in power
And Netanyahu appealed to them *all the freaking time*
It wouldn't be wrong to say 90% of everything bad and wrong here is because of them
We hate them so much it cant even be quantified
Wtf lol
Good
Looks a little fake
The power of religious orthodoxy is horrifying
There's no separation between church and state here, and the "church" here has an insane pull in the government because their backing is *gigantic*
The entire thing with the settlements here is *entirely* their fault, and Netanyahu has been their lapdop the entire time because he depended on their political support to retain his position
The ultra orthodox have long been a source of a lot of pain and suffering here, as their bigoted and selfish policies benefited only them at the expense of everyone else
and that's a *gigantic* plus because their ability to lobby for their agendas will be lessened significantly
The *good* thing is though that afaik, there are no Ultra Orthodox parties involved in the coalition
While kicking Netanyahu out will always be welcome, it's far from the best or optimal or even a good solution
It's made up of so many small parties all over the political spectrum, and it's bound to cause a fuckton of problems
And amongst all of this, it's next to impossible to know how long this government will actually last
Meaning that essentially, Lapid and Benett sacrificed the LGBT to oust Netanyahu
Secondly, Abbas here, the head of the Arab Party, only agreed to join this coalition if they agreed to stop pushing forward pro-LGBT policies
We know what they stand against, but we have next to no idea what they actually mean to do
For one, while this new government was formed to oust Netanyahu, it's not entirely clear what they stand for
Because there are several problems with the arrangement they reached
I wish it was more positive than it really is
but it's just weird
like I don't think there's anything here being done on purpose
huh?
it'll just hurt you in the end
if you shake the can but never open it it's going to explode eventually and that isn't pretty
you never want to keep things in like that
the worst thing you can do though is let it boil over
maybe you can tell them anyway and still stay friends
yeah it can suck a lot sometimes but it's not the end of the world
sometimes love doesn't work out
like in this scenario, maybe the best way is to just let it go
we ain't teenagers anymore who got time and patience to do these romantic games
and if they don't? hells yeah!
because that way even if they turn you down, you do it early so it doesn't hurt as much
if you're interested in someone, tell them
honestly, at our age, I feel the best way to go about it is the honest way
as fenny said, it's what you do with those feelings that matters
it's a completely natural process
when you meet new people there's always a chance you meet someone who vibes with who you are
love comes at unexpected times and at unexpected places
plenty of people
<:Teedus:632320401397252107>
Which companies?
cos that's pocket change
yeah their real money doesn't even come from the renting itself
real estate turned into a game
completely depends on where it is though
people stop being able to afford even a roof
I kinda see what Melua's going for, as real estate has a tendency to always go up in price (whether naturally or artificially), and that forces renters to pay even more
It has many interpretations that no one can agree on
But what *is* change?
The left wants change
Exactly
And it doesnt take much for the left to screw itself over from what is basically infighting
It's much easier to rally to the right than the left because it's much easier for the right to stand behind a unified cause
the moment someone pronounces you guilty
the very existence of an accusation makes someone guilty
despite the justice system supposedly being innocent until proven guilty
let's go back to feudal monarchies <a:HAMDANCE:701127155517489192>
because even in a parliamentary system, the parties still become left or right aligned
the problem is that even the alternative won't be enough
trying to roll the boulder up the mountain only for it to roll back down every time
it's like sisyphus
it's easier to keep the rock where it is than to move it
and that is *still* easier for people to grasp than the left
At the very least, I dont think they'll pull any existing laws, which would be horrible, but not making any news ones isnt great either
We'll have to see what they'll do in practice
forever
you're guilty
regardless of evidence and/or actual guilt

historically? not that I'm aware of, but it's possible
for your example, yeah
while that's the general nature of a poly relationship, naturally every one is different and each are handled differently by the people involved
poly relationships are a relationship that contains more than 2 people. They are agreed upon ahead of time, and the love is shared between all the members included in that relationship. There's no "harem king" or something similar in a poly relationship. Everyone is equal in it (to the best of my knowledge, correct me if I'm wrong about that)
harems (at least real life ones) are now very uncommon. They usually happened with royalty, and that's one man having multiple wives all of whom (or just some) bore him children
there is a difference
news is pretty damn sensationalized as well for the exact purpose of getting emotional reactions out of people so that's a thing too
so it happens
but human all the same
yeah discord isn't a democracy

while it's far from perfect, it could've been much worse
and it was ww2 in particular that launched the civil rights movement that reverberated around the world, eventually leading to a sharp decrease in institutionalised racism
and it took all those atrocities to get to the point today where we consider them vile
that was just the reality of the times
to be fair, that sort of justification wasn't all that uncommon pre-WW2, and even more so in the 18th and 19th centuries. The Americans did it, the Russians did it, the Chinese did it, the Japanese did it, and definitely more.
that's only ever happened to me once when I really had to puke and the male toilets were in the upper floor so I said fuck it
i'd never walk into the female bathroom unless there's a critical emergency
unisex = male > ease of access > female

We are in an epidemic, for one
Even if it comes through some absurd catastrophe
If not in our generation, then the next
One day reality as we know it will change
When was the last time that happened
otherwise you're just gonna have to deal with it
your only solution is to stop being around them if it bothers you
being a horny teenager is a part of life. you can't make it go away and you can't stop them from talking about it
Even in mythology that was the case

oh
These are going to be the worst olympics ever
Even I think this is such a stupid thing
like, it's just ice cream too
not that I think they were completely in the right yeah? But like everything ever, people make idiotic assumptions and jump to conclusions
they took it out of context and started shouting "boycott boycott!" when that's not at all what ben and jerry's were doing
people all over also misunderstand the ben and jerry's thing completely
lmao

stress is probably the biggest factor
you don't so much choose to be lazy as much as there's external factors weighing on you psychologically that cause you do be idle
what they mean probably is that laziness is a symptom, not a catalyst in and of itself
i recall the north korean soccer team was jailed for losing
let's just hope winnie doesn't spirit the olympic team away
and i have words to say to people who claim otherwise
online friendships are invaluable in that regard
people have committed suicide over a lack of social interactions
being able to have interactions with people to fill social needs is paramount to weathering the epidemic
also implying this so called introversion is bad is a very hot take
when in fact nobody is 100% this or that
they imply an absolute spectrum
introversion and extroversion are both overused as concepts
and a total lack of oversight
a lack of proper representation and anti-union actions
higherups abusing the passion of the employees for their own gain
insert random bullshit reason here
because stealing jobs or something i dunno
no such thing as bad publicity i suppose
what the fuck
being an idiot for a while and then not being one anymore is a sign of growth
i think what's telling more is that ya'll managed to leave those spaces rather than the fact you were in them in the first place
cynthia beat me to it
unfortunately the gamer crowd is made of people who're usually super susceptible to shitty opinions
we know that attempting to create a strict moral dichotomy will just create antagonism no matter what the issue is
and it comes down to the simpler question of is it bad to enjoy something made by a bad person
it can be big issues like this or smaller ones, e.g nintendo and their greed and paranoia
yet we still choose to buy and play and immerse ourselves in their games
I think we all know the total shit hole that the videogame industry is and the rampant abuse that goes on in many major companies
let's look at the videogame industry as another example
As i said, it comes down to the question of where you draw the line
but is putting a stance on the issue always a necessity?
because let's be real, the vast majority of the things we enjoy come with the baggage of the creator behind it
it may not be a binary thing, but I think the picture this argument tends to be painted in a binary light
Because as much as we can agree that the moral side of it is important, a lot of people simply want to divorce that sort of thing from their enjoyment
I don't think so
does that make them bad people for doing so?
Despite that, they still enjoy harry potter and buy merchandise and engage in the world
some of them know what is her deal, and others don't
it's certain without a doubt that JKR is a giant bitch. It's also certain without a doubt that Harry Potter is still a very popular work with millions upon millions of fans worldwide
to take harry potter for example
I think it entirely depends on where you draw the line
to give my 2 cents on the art vs artist thing (aka death of the author)

it went over the head of pretty much everyone else
because the word had other connotations

autism is also a spectrum
why are people doing this and why did this become a trend
Because of how badly it's been handled in the past
Basically, there's a complete lack of trust to be able to handle this topic maturely here
However, it can't be denied that it's a symptom of the trend. It may not be huge huge, but it *is* one. Whether it's dwindling or not is up for debate
I agree that this time it was uncalled for. It shouldn't have happened, and the goal should be to try and defuse these sort of arguments before they explode
Just to interject for a bit, people here *have* done what you said. Quite a lot, in fact, both in the past and in the present. It just tended to get brushed off quite a lot.
*why in Fortnite*
Like, the intention is nice but...
and you *don't* disable a *whipcrack* emote...
And when you combine an event meant to celebrate the civil rights movement and liberation of African Americans
But the whipcrack emote was not disabled because it's associated with an outsider influencer
So far so good
Part of the MLK event involved Epic disabling various emotes in order to show the proper respect to the topic
In the comics context, this is nothing to write home about
Separately, they made a DC comics event that included skins and emotes relating to characters. One of those emotes is a whipcrack that is associated with Catwoman
Spain of all countries has such a high percentage? Talk about surprising
you can, it just depends on how you do it
both physically and mentally
since you cant get rid of them, you have to do what you can to make sure you're not affected by them and to protect yourself
but in the end, you can't get rid of bad people no matter how much you try
if they only understand it the hard way, then the hard way is what they get
it's not efficient to chase after every single one, as Armis said, so you need to either flush them out or make their existence impractical for them in every way
it's not wrong, but it's like trying to find needles in a haystack

what
but since we love making things easier to comprehend, we give them names and define them based on what we know as a species
what we think we understand may not actually be what it is
in summation, we are limited by our own human perspective on the universe
the book of Genesis is a near 1-to-1 recreation of the big bang theory
given different definitions by different people
as we've stated, they're both explanations for similar phenomena
at their core, god and science aren't very different things
so for all we know, science is entirely the exploration of god's work
our knowledge of science is still pretty limited in many scopes
but what we *think* is the truth and what it actually is might not actually be the same thing
science is the exploration of the truth *as we defined the truth*
whereas science defined the oceans as a body of water containing life and currents (and other things), people in the past called it Poseidon, to give an example
that's not very different from how religion went about it
we just defined it as it was and it worked well for our purposes
but it's not necessarily what it is
Rutherford's atomic model is based on many calculations and hypotheses
so how do you define "the unknown"?
everything beyond that is unknown
take quantum physics for example, where they deal with particles that're so small that the very act of observing them changes their properties
it eventually reaches a wall
but science isn't infalliable
because them being unknown makes them scary and weird
we looked at natural phenomena and gave them names so we can explain them
but the thing is, they're all things we humans made and defined
we created tools that allow us to expand the scope of those observations and calculations
we all know science is based on observations and calculations, among many other things
I'll explain
they're both definitions we humans have made of natural phenomena
they pretend to be for their own gain
many would argue they're not actually Christians
but people don't grasp that because they were taught not to
viewed through different lenses
they're just different names for the same thing
science does not refute god, nor does god refute science
it's because of that that religion looks the way it does today
just because it fit their needs
they made up laws and rules and customs that were never intended or are a gross misinterpretation
people with agendas used it as a tool
but like everything in the world
some of the foremost geniuses of science, psychology, and philosophy were religious
it's just another way of explaining how the world works
in that regard, it's no different from science
the problem is that religion isn't an inherently bad concept
it's merely a platform where both great and terrible things can happen
it can't do anything on its own
internet is just a tool
nah
they're nurtured into it
yeah
because without them, you wouldn't be able to measure what "good" is in comparison
bad people are well, bad, but they're also in a way necessary
well, let's look at it this way as well
there's always going to be bad people everywhere
to put it simply, you can never get rid of the bad people completely
that's the unfortunate truth
toxicity isn't a matter of if, but a matter of how much
there's not a single online community that is exempt from this
that too
being a simple profile picture on a screen does a lot to remove the human factor
it's a double nasty
yeah
You can't outright prevent it, just reduce it as much as possible
There simply isn't a solution
Anonymity is a nasty tool
Online spaces will be toxic regardless of what you try to do about it
interdimensional facepalm moment
and those with no money can't even begin to think about joining this trend
all of the people with the money flaunt their money at things
it's basically hyper capitalism
because unlike all the cryptobros, you can't just fill a random piece of paper like a lotto and hope to win
it's a gamble you're guaranteed to lose
probably
https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/09/world/asia/singapore-unvaccinated-covid.html
clearly what the world needed
nothing like buying child porn with crypto
like genuinely only assholes love this thing
the only people who can actually engage in anything relating to it are the people who already have more than enough money so they're bored and want to try a "new" investment method
everything about crypto is omega capitalist to an infinity degree
seriously
so it's even more useless than useless
500 times more regulated by the sheer lack of usage and bottlenecking
it's like
so for all of their talk about having a currency unregulated by banks
and even then not all crypto is accepted everywhere
or deposit
but what bank will authorize such a transaction
all of these cryptocurrencies are completely useless until they're converted into actual money
like
that's suspicious as hell
banks aren't just going to turn the other cheek when suddenly 40 million dollars enter your bank account right?
unless I'm mistaken
okay you sell it but
like, the value of both is comparative to the dollar no?
but what can you *actually* do with it
Say you had the luck and earned 40 million dollars in ethereum or bitcoin for example
Here's something that I don't completely understand about NFTs and crypto in general
https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/04/nfts-werent-supposed-end-like/618488/
Like Paris Hilton believes she's an investor now and thinks NFTs are the future
this whole nft fuckery might as well not exist for anyone middle class and below
so far, I've only seen the ultra rich use it to try and get even richer
who is *actually* using these
thing is
3 million what? bottlecaps? There's more value in runescape gold coins farmed by poor children in sweatshops than whatever this is supposed to be
I have to commend these people for thinking that their shitcoin makes them somehow more advanced or progressive than others
also it was only a matter of time until someone turned your average random ass waifu maker into an nft machine
So anyone can make a worthless coin out of anything these days huh
The usual one day fever at most
except this is still tied to an actual currency
do you have proof?
If you go back in time maybe
so far it's been people with money flexing their money for the sake of flexing
I have yet to see any poor or disadvantaged person benefit from the existence of bitcoin and NFTs
king record's can
we don't need to
essentially calling us "sheeple" isn't a great take to make
oh they backpedalled on that?
And yet there's a rise in major corporations, video game ones included, who've started to delve into the NFT market
because its efficiency is questionable and accessibility is even worse
right now, the vast majority of people can't use it
bitcoin isn't a magic solution
it's an extremely long term investment
quite a few landlords actually do not benefit from rent
if the house is shit maybe
O_o
now it delves into conspiracy theories and that doesn't feel very convincing
some people don't even have money to pay for electricity and you want them to care about some digital coin?
fact of the matter is, *practically*, crypto is out of reach for the vast majority of people
and it could even *ruin* people's lives just as much
that is not certain
perhaps, but a possibility is just that - a possibility
and it's not a magic solution like you're making it out to be
*how*
fires don't start for no reason
maybe there was metal somewhere?
the second is to not give a damn what people think
and learn how to not repeat that in the future
You need to reflect on them and understand what it is you did wrong
first step is to acknowledge that you can't get away from your past mistakes
Anonymity is a powerful tool

Yeah some people in this server can be horrendously malicious and hostile
wake up the next, it's 12
it's literally wake up one morning, it's 40 dollars, wake up the next, it's 10000 dollars
crypto has no such system
stocks also do have systems in place to try and prevent crashes, although they're not foolproof and as we've seen plenty of time, they can go out of control
another one of those investments that they believe could explode in the future
that's *probably* what people are seeing with nfts
the only real way to earn big on crypto is to go back in time to before it was worth this much
that's pretty much it
a get rich quick scheme
an evolution of crypto
they're *behind* on the whole discourse
oh wow okay so it's the complete opposite
maybe because the amateur artist sphere there is bigger?
hmmmm
if it works like intended for them, then maybe the amount of shittery from nftbros there isn't as terrible
from what it seems, literally everyone who is not the artist is getting a lot of money
so much for that, right?
so remember that nonsense about NFTs "protecting artists"?
Jfc nfts are such a fucking joke
Now you can pay 3957392748383 dollar for a receipt of a one of a kind smell!

Whats next, nfts of bath water?
Nfts... of a single note...
Wtf
and it was never the same
And then the people with agenda came
complete on their own merit of course
about as credible as the "wonderkids" who mysteriously managed to build a nuclear reactor in their homes and earn a phd at age 11

THINK OF THE "pOtEnTiAl!"
Totally worth buying for 50 bajillion dollars
Much amaze
Wow
A local coffee brand here started selling nfts of their mascot lol and they say that if you go to any branch and show your nft receipt, you can get 1 donut a day for free for a year lmao
Lets not forget what videogame publishers are trying to do
I also don't understand something here
i choose to hate
the automation would make it basically hands free
it's like making bank off of pennies but it doesn't sound so farfetched
dumb idea, but can't you just... make a bot that opens like a bajillion wallets and connect it to your I dunno, paypal? or some offshore bank?
so just opening a wallet on their chain gives you essentially free money?
to give an example
yeah but that's a singular case
the coins don't just pop into existence
in order to buy the nfts, you need to first somehow obtain the currency with which it is purchased, no?
the weird thing about it is this
vs the value of a pound
the value of a euro vs the value of a dollar
it's not like
because the decentralization thing causes it so you don't have any currency to actually compare them to
that can't interact with anyone else
it's like they're carving up their own personal kingdoms
it sounds counterproductive as hell
so you end up with an ungodly amount of blockchains and cryptos
because alongside those blockchains, they also push out their own cryptocurrency
meaning that outside of it, they don't exist and/or have no value
And the NFTs they sell can only be exchanged on that blockchain
so about every single company that's getting into NFTs open up their own blockchain no?
here's another thing that I found weird
it sounds like something that can easily backfire on you if you're not careful
this sounds like something that is so easy to manipulate it's a wonder how anyone still has any trust in it
like, here's another thought
but what are the chances this will *actually* work this way
okay, so I understand what it's supposed to do in theory
I mean, isn't that how it's supposed to be right now?
using his voice for bigotry, racism, and so forth
imagine something even worse
this is something vocaloid had mastered  *nearly 2 decades ago*
like someone brought up an interesting comparison
how does making it a shitty NFT in any way shape or form benefit anyone
sell? the voices? like a product?
why not just...
if they're supposed to be "useful", as in, you can use the voice you purchase in whatever creation you want
<:CarolShock:730816714345938956>
there's something extremely off putting about seeing people who embrace nfts and such turn it into a major part of their personality
crypto is rapidly becoming less of a technology and more of a cult
thank god it didn't happen
jfc
implying the people behind it are normal
now they're just sad
bugs used to be features
never forget what happened with neopets
ü§î
ü§®
üôã
but as we've seen, the practical execution is nothing more than money laundring, grifting, scams, and actual destruction
the theoretical application of nfts is fine
and did the same thing
imagine if someone bought the statue of david or the mona lisa
a timeless, one of a kind *piece of history* is going to be destroyed for their profit
real value is turned into pure garbage
that's what nfts are in the end
and that's the crux
purely because of that
if it says NFT on it, someone will buy it
you know they will
someone's gonna buy it
but it could also be a gigantic failure and spiral them down even lower
sure, it could be a huge success and help them out of poverty
that's great and all, but that one step doesn't immediately prove anything
so currently, there's no reason to believe it'll work
*and?*
so they adopted it as an additional legal tender
this still doesn't prove how bitcoin can "save" el salvador
^ in regards to el salvador
you made a claim with no evidence

uhhhh
yeah but that's an exception, not a rule
counted by who?
when it's much bigger than you, it feels disconnected emotionally
we all have our own share of worries in our immediate lives we have to care for, whether it's career, family, and so forth
it's easy to look from the side at something on the other side of the world, or on a bigger scale than your immediate concerns, and not really give it any real mind
it's difficult to care for something that doesn't immediately concern you
can't completely blame them
I don't think there's any reason to even talk about it
but until it achieves widespread adoption
maybe some independent actors do so
order a pizza in bitcoin too why not
maybe a day will come when you can buy groceries, pay for hospital bills, buy a car, pay rent, and receive a paycheck in bitcoin
all the talk of decentralization and fighting against fiat currency is just sugarcoating the fact that it's unattainable
it was doomed from the start
you use a centralized currency to buy a decentralized one so you can win back a centralized one
it cant be decentralized by definition because bitcoin depends on  a centralized currency to have value
that's why this whole crypto business seems counterproductive as hell
for that to happen, enough people need to care
as you said, the change has to be gigantic in scale
as long as the world is run by the dollar, decentralization, imo, is a pipe dream
on a micro scale maybe, but on the macro I think it's next to impossible
that doesn't automatically become recentralized because regulations come down on it
but I've yet to see any functional, beneficial, and accessible application of it
theoretically yeah
yeah but... *why* is that a benefit?
that's... a good question
huh
but again, nothing promises it's what will actually benefit them
a good tool, yes
but I don't think decentralization is necessarily the solution
yeah, it's not a necessarily good thing
politics are universal now
economies are becoming more entangled
people are becoming *more* connected
cos globalization isn't decreasing, it's *increasing*
but I feel the world's interconnectivity makes it an uphill battle
there are some who'd argue it isn't all that great, and I *can* see why it can be perceived as such
from how I'm grasping it, fighting centralization also requires fighting globalization
essentially, the dollar is, as it is right now, an integral part of the process
but the inherent problem is that crypto depends on fiat currency to have value
from the examples given, I've found that only Indonesia is seeing a positive surge. The rest seem to be doubling down on not allowing it and restricting it
who's everyone?
which ones?
but at the same time, it's not a magic solution
sure, it's not the technology's fault
because the foundations themselves are faulty
you could have 100 options and all of them could fail
the problem is that having more options doesn't necessarily help if they can't apply them properly
nobody said it's bad that they have more options
and in the event it fails for any reason, like a failure to properly implement it?
that still doesn't prove how bitcoin can help them
that's not an answer
that's...
I feel like you have a personal vendetta against America and its media. Which is of course fair enough and plenty understandable all things considered, but I can't help but think that it's coloring your perceptions of the world
this is pure comedy
this isn't serious

at this point I'd rather open runescape again and farm GPs for real money

Just trend chasing
Not even out of touch
something is hilarious about this
lmao
he spoke of nukes and that's concerning in that it feels like he might actually go through with it
maybe that's why he's going this far
even if they want to arrest him and put him on trial, who will do so and how?
On a personal level
It's so disturbing because he can just kinda... get away with it
And his position is pretty unmovable at this point
He had been liquidating his opposition for years now
Like
Like he wants to go out with a bang
In a way, it also feels like Putin has a somewhat... personal agenda with this whole thing
I think so
it's so involved on the global scale that the *actual* fighting feels somewhat secondary to the online discourse around it
but this entire conflict feels so... commercialized
one of the massive differences I've noticed, and forgive me if it isn't the right word for it
the geo-social-political landscape is so different from the 40s that the very nature of war doesn't work as massive campaigns anymore
even a hypothetical world war 3 won't happen like the first two did
war simply doesn't work the same way it used to
yeah
nationalism is in a bit of a weird state right now
it's also harder to garner support for it
war doesn't make money anymore and that's why it's not very tenable
it's a massive simplification and an absolute speculation, but it gives that sort of vibe
a "nothing left to lose" sort of situation
Biden did an oopsie
https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10567679/Biden-confuses-Ukraine-Iran-State-Union-address.html
the answer is most likely no but the spirit is appreciated
they're more cultural relics than anything else
yeah these sort of expressions can be hard to parse for anyone not a native
Could be a piece of cloth or whatever she decides
It's when a lady gives her lover some kind of item, usually jewelery and such
```To show one‚Äôs feelings, especially amorous ones, openly. This term comes from the old custom of tying a lady‚Äôs favor to her lover‚Äôs sleeve, thus announcing their attachment. Shakespeare used it in Othello (1.1): ‚ÄúBut I will wear my heart upon my sleeve for daws to peck at.‚Äù```
and their insanely anti-consumer measures are a sight to behold
they're the most problematic major company
nintendo aren't known for being reasonable in pretty much anything
Putin changed the whole country in less than a month
usually these sort of things happen over a long period
it happened out of nowhere
where the hell did this come from
You possibly could get it restored if you havent touched anything
saying nothing is akin to supporting
Cos it's been turned into an Us vs Them situation
Denying covid vaccines is a little overkill
But it doesnt really make much a difference overall
Well, sure
This isnt a person that can be reasoned with
You should probably block them tbh
It's kindergarten level of bullying
At this point it's just pathetic
Who does that like wtf
What a lunatic holy shit
Elon Musk being helpful as usual
https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2022/03/14/elon-musk-challenges-vladimir-putin-duel-ukraine/
although I don't doubt there's plenty of those who do
I suppose it's alright since it's Ukraine itself doing it and not some douchebag making bank on people's suffering *again* (referring to the nfts)
it feels like this war has become ever more of a spectacle and a commercialized event
Cos while it helps the Ukrainians
I still don't know how to feel about that
hmm
oh huh
so they have to resort to this sort of bullshit just so they can have a chance
because the suffering of the ukrainian people is apparently not enough of an incentive for overseas agents to fund their military
in a way, it's kind of sad
so war is profitable after all
Yeah that
Well, news does need to be scrutinized healthily
And necessary?

Shutting out an entire continent out of their social media platforms doesn't at all sound like a terrible idea that definitely won't backfire
that's a little messed up
Wasting 8 years of planning, process, funds, manpower, actual development, etc
E.g one president starting a project and the next cutting all funding to it
Term limits can also hinder any developmental plan thats takes more time to accomplish than the length of the term
And I felt the need to state that
But I found that statement to not completely reflect my personal experiences here
Im doing quite well actually
While it has improved over time, it's still a very significant blemish
I can only speak for my myself, but I have definitely been on the receiving end of unjustified statements and comments on the basis of who I am and where I'm from
There are aspects (and people) in this server that are the embodiment of the exact opposite
I have to disagree with that statement to an extent
I have feelings about that statement

and you later had hours upon hours to do what you want
how is that taking over a channel to that extent?
It went on for a grand total of 20 minutes until you shooed us off
hell, just the post itself references a few just for shits and giggles
that's why we made a joke of them and mocked them
it's the basic thing to do
we all do
I hate them about as much as everyone else
The topic isn't about NFTs here
and behind our backs, if we refer to the suffering prompt
because apparently not liking a dumb april fool's joke is enough reason for some to insult us to our faces
but alas, this is why we can't have nice things
I appreciate the ones who did play along and that was fun while it lasted
it's a goddamn april fool's joke
and just to "piss people off" isn't the fucking intention
But this time? Nah, I don't buy it, sorry
People took their reactions to it too far imo, but fine
I can buy not liking the suffering prompt. Sure, okay, even the mods told me it wasn't the best, and it's a difficult topic for some to handle and that's fine, I accept it
That already makes it a not great solution because it forces you to work much harder than is actually necessary
We're an international server so it's already difficult to line up the exact timeframe where you'll get the most responses
and why that feeling probably changed
I can see why
I want to believe we're sensible enough to not need that much moderation in a writing prompt focused thread
*that's why we stopped*
we read the room
and you know what? we respected it when it bothered you and moved away
Oh and by the way, techno had actually hijacked the topic *away* from the joke
And took a total of 20 minutes
Depends
I have nothing to prove or explain to someone who's that self centered

oh no i'm not having this conversation with you here
just make one for prompts and that's it

I hadn't interacted with anyone lgbt until I was like what, 16?
it took me so long to even meet a single one
Like i thought transgender people were a myth
like I didn't even know what LGBT was 15 years ago due to how unexpressed it went
if I'm understanding it correctly, it's not that there's suddenly more LGBT folk as if they're an invasive species or something lol, but rather that the ones who kept it a secret due to societal norms were able to finally express themselves properly
it'll make the process as a whole longer and harder
definitely
because they'll require more evidence to prove it
I can see this being a precedent for abuse victims finding it harder for people to believe them
but that's just in this specific case
well, according to the evidence that was uncovered, she was just as, if not even more abusive to him than he was to her
in essence, depp wins the case
verdict is both defamed each other

Just drawing comparisons about accountability
More details on his wiki page
Thats it in a nutshell
Around 2018, due to some tweet he made criticizing trump, someone dug up old tweets of his from like 2008 in which he made tasteless jokes about pedophilia and the holocaust,
He was then fired by disney, and he accepted the firing by holding himself accountable for what he said even if it was 10 years ago
He received pretty much universal support from pretty much everyone, including high profile actors until Disney reinstated him
Reminds me of what happened with James Gunn
i'd say saving people's lives is pretty productive and healthy
It's like if a Native American became the president of the United States

And then you have examples like Roman Polanski, a stunningly talented director who made some spectacular movies and adaptations like Macbeth, who was charged with assaulting a minor, fled to Europe, and continued directing
That sometimes come with odd fixations
Nerd culture has that sort of stigma attached because it has a high percentage of the socially outcast
Yeah definitely
The bigger it is, the more scum there are, and the more scum there are, the more the especially scummy stand out

that second part can be a little difficult to accomplish
but beer is illegal until 21
sooo I suppose the whole age-limit to owning guns thing doesn't actually matter anymore
it's a triple A game, the only right thing to do is to pirate it
but yeah I expected a shitstorm and got what is mostly a strong breeze
to be honest I thought there would be much much bigger pushback online against the game but most i've personally seen was articles so the harassment factor probably did get overblown, even if it did happen a handful of times when the game just released
probably was being used for that as well but then again you don't actually need a second website to really do that
there was also this one website that allowed people to look up streamers who were playing the game. Suffice to say that site shut down very quickly because they realized it was instantly being used as a tool for harassment
and yeah, new toy syndrome. it's big now, there's a bit of a buzz, and then everything about it will die down in a month or two and we'll forget it exists
nostalgia in general is very strong
nostalgia for harry potter is always a big factor
they probably don't know how to handle it when things get more heated than they're used to
it'll get cracked eventually
well, pirating it is the only real compromise I think exists in this case
ah rip
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sirona
apparently it's derived from this?
for at least one nomination
100% guaranteed
we are definitely going to see it in the game awards
at this point I think the only real option is to ride it out and let it all just go away on its own
the only winning move is to not play
cos both pirating and buying used require patience
they got swept along by the hype and won't hear no for an answer
another symptom of new toy syndrome
they're too impatient and want to play it *now*, I suppose
not to the extent the west does
The Japanese probably don't know anything about the controversy or even about Rowling
the only real deviation I found was when it came to overseas crowd, such as hololive idols or VAs such as Natsuki Hanae and Kensho Ono
the site was shut down like a day later anyway

there can't be a 4th movie
and as illi said, zero was a prequel written after FSN was already out
considering the vastly different characters, yeah, you couldn't
if that was the initial problem you had with UBW
it'll give you a far better impression of Shirou, that I can promise
not that there is much that can be done about it
something that is not well done in the anime adaptations
and his twisted mindset
considering it was originally written through Shirou's perspective
the problem with adaptations of FSN is that they never truly manage to get the perspective right
the fandom also has a serious elitism problem
and unless you have managed to follow it from the start, you'll have a hard time getting into it
considering fate's, and by extension type moon's biggest problem is a serious overcomplication of everything
he's overcomplicating, but he's not exactly wrong
that is literally omega comf

it's the maximum *comf*

the HF movie was bloody amazing
that's the one capable of literal anime like moments
it's called RUGP
muvluv's engine isn't renpy
I was mistaken
oh oops
and even surround sound
lip movements on characters that match the voice acting
sprites moving elegantly
it allows for an incredible range of practical effects
the most advanced engine I've seen thus far is renpy, which is used by the likes of muvluv
yeah
and replacemenet scenes for the h-scenes
only things they added were voice acting and additional cgs
there are zero differences
realta nua uses the same thing
yeah. I think NScripter doesn't allow voice acting. Kirikiri allows for voice acting, has more elegant looking menus, and allows for simple practical effects
and easier to use
which is a much simpler one
yeah except when they cry use the Nscripter engine

the thing that sets it apart, from what I've noticed, is that the dialogue box is on top of the imagery, and not at the bottom as a textbox
the only thing I have to offer are FSN walkthroughs on youtube to show how it operates
uhhh...hmm...
it has an auto read option as well
kirikiri it's called iirc
as not everyone has the time or patience for it
even the VN i'd say is optional
everything else is optional
zero and ubw I'd say are the bread and butter at this point
and the answer would be "because the answer is in a different route"
you're pretty must certain to ask "wait, why wasn't this and that touched upon?"
because once you finish UBW
you'd need to experience all three
and to get all of the answers to the questions zero raised
so to really get a grasp on the entirety of FSN
they also cover different parts of the larger whole
yes
and the third, adapted into movies by ufotable, is so far amazing, without even going into the meat of it
the second by ufotable was great
the first route by DEEN was...okay, but nothing more
as for the anime adaptations,
each route has its own tone as well
and yes, since FSN was a route based VN, a single route does not encompass everything that it has to offer
I can say that the second half of UBW is vastly superior to the first
that's a legit criticism
you...just don't like the artstyle
that was great as well
i read the manga for it
Have watched Shiki
psycho-pass haven't seen, but heard a lot of good things about it
seen all three hahahaha
that was definitely up my alley
if you have anymore like it, do say so
binged it in two days and holy hell what an experience that was
what a series
oh man am I glad I listened to you
<@!388516680742993933> wow wow wow wow
just finished Shinsekai Yori
I'll check it out
nice combination
oooooh
wikipedia says dark fantasy, science fiction, and thriller
beautiful show
saw that too
haven't seen Shinsekai
have seen monster
Let's see...
Interested in:
War/Strategy
Psychological
Philosophical
Tragedy
Stuff with a surprising premise (Such as Revue Starlight and Madoka)
Horror

Avoiding:
Harems
Cute girls doing cute things
Idols
Jojo
Purely waifu shows
guess I should lay out my preferences first though
sports huh...hmm...not too keen on those tbh. got anything else?
no harems and no cute girls doing cute things please
looking for anime recommendations
hmmm ü§î
i know right?
why does that automatically translate as "something wrong with you" for you
nobody can force you to like it
i found a screening in hamburg but it's a little strange
i've been having a hard time finding out where I can watch FSN HF2 around here
that's good to know
hoh
so trippy yet so good
that's a very specific thing to complain about
it's not kiddy like it used to be in dbz
the dub is actually rad though
values were straight up different
adapting anything from before the 2000s will most definitely be divisive
summer gon' be a blast
<:MikuBliss:336657233712513024>
>anime about oda nobunaga airing in july with symphogear
if kaguya isn't at least nominated for best op for 2019 I will riot
nothing like some good ol' fashioned homocide
Asuka just resonates with me
Never got to neverland before, but like it so far
Kaguya and Shield Hero I stumbled upon the manga last year and liked both
I'm watching:
Kaguya
Neverland
Shield Hero
Asuka
i tend to be negatively influenced by hype, so much so that I tend to not give the popular stuff even a second look
i dont think I watched most of the anime in 2018 lol
it's why i stopped watching stuff like monogatari and durarara
i get you
surprised that devilman crybaby got anime of the year
so eeny meenie meiny mo, let's pick the only one that I know!
but of course they don't
this would have been worth something if the people voting actually watched all of the shows that are listed for each category
today on captain obvious 101: anime awards are rigged popularity contests
https://www.crunchyroll.com/anime-news/2019/02/16/winners-of-the-2019-anime-awardsupdated-live
in other news
i should finish watching it
I wish
wow good mecha
or end up wrecked themselves
so normal there's a whole city of people who got isekaied
a world where being isekaid is actually a pretty normal occurence
speak to the boners and you'll always succeed
sex sells after all
at the very least, we can hope to never again get shit like smartphone
it took a different approach, but still pretty generic
I like shield hero and even I think it doesn't renew anything
no show is able to revive the genre
isekai has been ruined completely by its trends
and it's the same in every show with a focus on pretty waifus
which is a shame, seeing as the production committee isn't
not the goal
It's naive to think so, but the merch and sales should be a mere byproduct of a good and respected franchise
Symphogear is a very sad and obvious example of this
I think the biggest problem is that anime lately is being used not as a method of unique storytelling, but rather to sell waifus
probably one of the broadest next to shonen and shoujo
slice of life is a very broad genre
on that note, we also need less kawaii moe moe kyun and comf every season and stuff with a little more substance
it's very short
just watch one piece
it could also be something completely different
if it is indeed a sequel to rebellion
big one
it is
need that real a e s t h e t i c experience
but on an OG fat TV from a tape player
rising of the shield hero
is this an abridged?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnvgQCavmkM
anyone remember the watch order for yuyuyu?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8vk5P0xdEQ
now hear him *sing*
you also want to have your impression of Jotaro changed even more?
I'm the weird one who thinks of Nobuyuki Sanada from samurai warriors first
*(insert enemy stand here)*
*(insert yare yare daze here)*
*(insert dio joke here)*
*crickets*
Demons *were* presented as feral for the majority of the time
And it's not like he's wrong either
So he added those suggestions on top to cement it
I'm thinking that despite her special circumstances, Urokudaki decided not to take risks with her
If you remember in like...episode 2 I think it was, that she was salivating at the sight of human blood
as for Nezuko, it depends on how you view it
it's the same there as well
yeah
but it takes a little to notice the slashes only cut and don't do anything else
I thought they had elemental swords too at the start
it's there to show the style. we have yet to see others, but in the case of Tanjiro's it's to show his flowy movements as he attacks
there isn't any actual element added to it
effects
the water effects are just that
ah no
but it could've used another 1-2 episodes
yeah, they definitely wanted to get the training/introduction out of the way quickly to get to the meat of the story already
It felt a little rushed because I figure they wanted to get the whole introductory arc out of the way
The start was kinda like this in the manga too
also, Kimetsu no Yaiba simply doesn't stop getting better
at least the rest of it is pretty good
See what it's got to offer
I'll give it a chance then
I see
Is it worth a watch?
Yay or nay?
Anybody here who watched Knights of Sidonia
ufotable after all
it has memes?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XA_P2vyOi70
<@468591607332208641> this actually happened
speaking of love love tenkyoken
>Attack on Titan is the highest rated TV episode of anything
https://www.imdb.com/search/title?title_type=tv_episode&num_votes=1000,&sort=user_rating,desc
tfw
and made it 1000% better while still retaining its uniqueness
ufotable took the rough and weird artstyle
holy shit what night and day
as for the art though
because my memory is bad I don't quite remember in the manga if it did or not
I guess it's simply putting more emphasis on the severity of the demon transformation as a plot point than on Nezuko's still developing character
Yeah, I get what you mean
and only old demons like the mutated one had any real sentience
TIFFANIA

horimiya
What do y'all think of it
Caught up on the manga
Kimetsu no Yaiba is pretty good
So uhhh
the movie looks promising
it's nice
Hamon is an even more poorly defined Hokuto Shinken
one to one FotNS
from the looks of the characters down to where the final battle took place
it is
I've already had a jojo related incident this week and I'm not itching for another
eh, I'll pass this time
but i won't get into it since i'll just go on another gigantic rant if I do
I like fotns, but a lot of people here already know just how far my dislike of jojo goes
can't say the opposite though
having an anime in the 80s isn't helpful in drawing in new watchers
maybe one day it'll get a modern remake
if you like jojo in general you have a high chance of liking fotns
all I can say is, if you like part 1, you'll like fotns
another one later comes with silver chariot, whose mask is similar to Jagi's
that's the heaviest inspiration
i dunno if any of you read or seen fotns, but I can assure you that should you give it a look, you'll start seeing more and more similarities shine through
part 1 of jojo bears striking similarities to the Shin arc in fotns
not only the castle, but the very fact it took place on a balcony
the location of the final battle is one as well
speedwagon is one too
there were a bit too many similarities for me to call it just inspiration
fotns just got to it first in japan
the action-movie super buff men
that's what was predominantly popular in the 80s
there's nothing wrong with having a similar style at that time
it's only part 1 that bears similarities
part 2 isn't relevant because he had already diverged at that point
it's just that part 1 was heavily inspired by the tropes of the time, which fotns took charge of
that is not to say that araki didn't have his own ideas at the start
Jonathan and Kenshiro share almost the exact same design, down to the hair and the shoulder pads
it's only part 2 onwards that he diverged from it
araki specifically took inspiration from it for part 1
jojo and fotns were made in the same timeframe
consider this
fascinating
memes don't justify it
kind of like how every time a flamboyant character appears anywhere, it's apparently a jojo reference
and then actually do it
and just list a bunch of crazy ass ideas they want to do in animation
get wasted off of sake
a bunch of japanese executives going on a holiday trip to a hotspring
just imagine it
they got drunk in a hotspring and that's how they thought of it
i mean, just the story of how they came up with panty and stocking is hilarious
due to the artstyle and setting
the show lends itself to dubbing easier than regular anime
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKPcZFBeYec
and the dub was superior to the jp original in every way
oh man, panty and stocking was great
that is a gorgeous cgi anime
houseki no kuni, I insist
but kinda like goblin slayer, once the initial edge wears off, it's kinda...plain
I mean, it's not bad
arifureta is...
¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
we keeps on watching illegally?
so...
how do you get a translation so wrong
what
you can always try to recommend those older things to her and see how she responds
then they wouldn't have any point to the rivalry
real robot and super robot are very different in execution after all
What speaks to me personally with Gundam so far is the military, technical aspect of it all which is a lot of fun
they are few and far between, and there also aren't all that many of them
and only one ROTK game
I haven't played the kessen games
that's even more than I did!
wow!
and by extension, sengoku?
which games related to it did you play
ah, that's fine
You also read romance of the three kingdoms?!?!
also, I forgot to respond to this
but people take their rankings as absolute, which gives it a bad name
I mean, in case of keeping track of your anime, MAL is no contest
see, that was the first mistake
>MAL
yeah, it won't be interesting unless you know who all the people are
if it does that, i'm off
or diverge towards the standard shonen fare
either it'll go all in on the science
dr stone has two ways it can go
tfw I'm probably the only one watching Kochiki Nobunaga and I'm not even surprised
this is my short list
so what anime y'all following this season?
sure
old thing
lol, yeah
funnily enough, Koihime Musou is what got me into three kingdoms and then into sengoku
too bad Shin wasn't fully tled yet
it was fun for what it was
lol, I played it too
and ikki tousen too
and then there's koihime musou which was a whole different creature
souten kuro was one
that has even less animated adaptations
not to mention the three kingdoms
the sengoku era is a goldmine of stories, but they don't really use it all that much
and nobunagun has an MC in the lead with his abilities but that's it
the only other two that come to mind are nobunaga the fool and nobunaga concerto
I've seen nobuna
did I miss VN talk?
nowadays you can't go into a single clip of him appearing in anything without the comment section being flooded with "DIOOOOOOOOOO"
as well as in seto no hanayome as Shark Fujishiro
i specifically remember him in this
yep, I definitely remember
it has takehito koyasu and eri kitamura in the lead roles
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1I2lGzOteY
<@87512939107450880> did i just hear *fucking* **NEEDLESS**?!?!
what's up
oh hey ayamine you pinged me
not all popular things are good, and not all good things are popular
people tend to forget that popularity does not indicate quality
pretty much
we'd run out of things to talk about because everyone would like the same things
imagine if everyone watched things that are dictated by their MAL scores
you're expecting logic from people who depend on ratings to dictate what they enjoy
Anything below an 8 in their eyes is complete trash
seriously
There are people that religiously follow MAL ratings
finally something good came out of MAL
nah, it's even better
https://kissanime.ru/Anime/Sangokushi-Dainibu-Choukou-Moyu/Episode?id=157782&s=default
I'm glad you asked!
<@238855496797257729> do *you* want a 2 and a half hour long anime movie about the three kingdoms from 1993?
if MAL dictated the quality of works, then that'd actually be true
the japanese audience is a lot more significant for a show's success, I'd say
God of War winning game of the year was a triumph
honestly, last year had the most balanced game awards in a while
How could I forget
ah of course
***MAL***
afterl all
well, it's a per episode basis so it's not really indicative of anything
history has no plot holes!
It's a lot of fun
It's definitely high quality, and worth following imo
like, extremely accurate
historically accurate vikings
it takes some artistic licenses, but all in all it's fairly historically accurate
despite being animated by DEEN, it's quite beautifully made
surprisingly, it is
are you following Kochuki Nobunaga?
btw Cypher
VInland Saga! <:MikuPraise:585839808765493249>
hayao miyazaki was right
anime was a mistake
there is no justice in this world
another one of the pile
it's just more of the same
it's another battle shonen in a sea of them
can't be a shonen without a copout ending
it's the one thing I remember from dog days
dog days?
DBZ is the Ur-example of shonen after all
they *might've* had meaning in the early DBZ days like the saiyan saga
I really don't get it
can someone explain to me why takagi-san is so popular
<@193947577714999306>
¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
deen stay night for you
and not give this broken car engine noise
they could've just copy pasted the sound he makes in the VN
god that was such a stupid sound
Illya even comments on it
that's a thing that they did
yep
lol
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuz01t_9wtg
does this count?
tfw Hitler was a Drifter and Jesus might be the big bad
STAB THEM WITH SPEARS COATED WITH FECES!
Drifters!
with the whole life flashing before your eyes thing
earlier in the ep we kinda got a setup?
well
at least it was fairly good and seriously hype
expected at this point
it's like
yeah it was a fairly simple shonen power up scene
agents pointing at kaiba with their fingers instead of guns
it's so bad it's hilarious
anime these days usually never passes the 25 episode mark
Ufotable have pretty much enhanced the original in every way
live action ones maybe <:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
characters' appearances aside
it does take quite a few liberties with the historical accuracy
you actually enjoy watching him on screen
I can say that it does improves as it goes along, as Nobunaga does grow and become less of a headache
Not often you get to actually have the phrase "am I the only one" be truthful
I know right
tfw there are like, 4 people including me on r/anime that are watching Kochuki Nobunaga
hard hitting
what a rough ep of vinland saga
god
highly recommend trying to show them Wolf Children
There's some level of satisfaction to be had in GATE I have to admit
then you'll see that aplenty here
Gate is a very nationalistic work. It's basically "JSDF good, everything else bad". However, if you can put that sort of thing aside, it's actually quite enjoyable.
ty
<@155150213445582850> can you link that fic?
Rebuild 4 looking neat
I mean *everyone* wants to
don't tell me you've never wanted to translate your opinion on race horses into possible mobile suits
since you've always been wondering

that's definitely an unheard of premise
O_o
see what it's about
alright, I'll give it a look
is that so
is it good?
I didn't even know this was a thing that exists
is that a thing airing right now?
Kirika saw the potential danger they posed and move quickly to put them down
THE DESS!

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yx-9zJ3UpvQ
somehow came across this again
although Timon is actually likable
too fitting
fucking lol
¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
world moved on without them
but nobody remembers they exist anymore
they were super popular in the 90's and early 2000s
I guess they just didn't age too well
which was hilarious
and a yuri version of alice in wonderland
old stuff like magic knight rayearth
I mean do they need to? Their backlog of works in pretty epic as it is
a spinoff to xxxHolic, apparently
the manga for it is still publishing though
it ended last year
oh wait no
the sequel to cardcaptor sakura is sitll airing iirc
but they do some amazing work
they are
considering the names of the characters and the name of the kingdom
I think it is
as odd as it is
clamp's extended universe is mesmerizing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVbjOmraAkI
classic
FUCKING LOL

This is a different one
xxxHolic isn't with the crossdresser though. That's Maria Holic
¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
I mean he asked for gothic series
It fits the bill!
Lel
<@!263983345669505025>
Claymore
xxxHolic
Pandora...Hearts? Is that gothic? not sure
Gosick
Shiki
Ergo Proxy if you haven't tried it yet
if symphogear ever ends up in super robot wars we'll literally explode
I mean, Nono is in it as a unit, isn't she? Even though she's a robot herself
took a while though
it's great
Well, regardless
HOW
Good vid on how ufotable does their magic
https://youtu.be/r3R6cf6njz4
Iirc the way they do so is by building a 3d set first and then animating the fight inside it
Cos whichever one it'd be, they'd try their hardest to copy ufotable's style
I think i'd see how the new studio does in that case
It gets near universal praise atm
I dont doubt the series will get more seasons though
He appeared for a bit but we never saw him again
He needs to be relevant again though first thing first
It feels a lot more intimate with the viewer/reader
He's relatable and grounded. A protag you can actually feel yourself understanding, particularly how he keeps on psyching himself up in a fight
That just like her, they were also humans once
Nezuko was the very first demon he ever saw, and I think that gave him a certain impression about the demons
I think the very fact his sister became a demon affected his mindset a lot
honestly, I think if Nezuko wasn't a demon, he wouldn't be as compassionate
Tanjiro knows that exceptionally well
they put a lot of emphasis on humanizing the demons, even when they're cold blooded killers
that's also a major plus, yeah
He's the good boy protag, but isn't obnoxiously so
Tanjiro is a relatable protagonist with a clear, grounded goal, and the powers he gains are just a means to an end to that
what I personally like about Kimetsu is Tanjiro and Nezuko, more than anything
~~except God Eater~~
I think I've seen it before in something else
it's a meme
if they were gonna meme about battle shonens, they should've included way more lol
attack on titan has a lot of fairly one dimensional characters, and whenever it doesn't deal with the titans directly, it struggles to remain interesting. The current arc is honestly one of the most convoluted it had
Where do I even begin with this meme lol
which is a damn shame
it's on hiatus apparently
play all of them
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5-9lAHiORk
what nostalgia
mid 2000s VN openings
She killed Shinji once he threatened to reveal her history to Shirou
Sakura considers herself filthy because she was violated constantly for over ten years, not to mention the whole worm thing
you saw how she constantly tried to push him away but he didn't care
and that she doesn't want to drag him into that
it was because she considers herself as filthy
I don't think she was being literal
in HF they have a *lot* of sex
no beating around that bush
the original was a lot of sex
that's the replacement scene in realta nua
the blood thing was even the non-h version
they actually made it somewhat emotional
because rather than go about the weird writing nasu had
the sex scene was honestly really good
they're all about the small world that doesn't extend past a single city
But that's how VNs are though
they cut out a lot from the VN, but the compensated by emphasising a lot of other things
absolutely wonderful movie
yep
UBW made sense because Gil has a gigantic armory
it was the worst in Fate, when he *somehow* lost a bunch of lives to Caliburn
yeah, it's a big flaw of FSN
Saber was overpowering him in eery regard
the same thing happened in the VN and he still lost
it might also be because the shadow is draining him
it depends on the method used to kill him
it's not so much a plot hole and more people forgetting that God Hand isn't perfect in its defense
she's overpowering that defense
she's connected to an infinite mana source and is throwing around mana bursts with ease
it's because she's just that strong
it was actually scary to look at
it was fantastic
I can't praise the way they showed the shadow enough
it's a great way to make up for the fact they can't show shirou's inner monologue
yet still managed to keep its impact
his decision to protect sakura and throw away his ideals was changed around
they even managed to find a way to keep Shirou's important scene of the route
but at least they know how to compensate in other areas
they may remove a lot
he got wrecked in the VN, but here he held his own for quite a while
other things HF movie did well was have berserker actually give a fight against saber alter
im not kidding
unironically, Archer's rant was better in the english dub
but like DEENstay night, it had a good ost
literally just a fight compilation
i remember the ubw movie which was just...a disaster
he doesn't turn into Archer in *any* route
because none of the FSN routes serve as a start to Archer
like, the shadow was 100 times more terrifying in the movie
but as I said, they compensated by turning up a lot of things
yeah, a lot was cut
nasu can make up shit on the fly and integrate it to canon and we're supposed to take it as is
nothing is a known fact in the Nasuverse lol
that sort of resistance doesn't matter
but when you have infinite mana and your swings are imbued with mana burst at every turn
it's just a very strong resistance
it's not perfect defense
yeah
but yes, Berserker is that character whose purpose is to showcase just how powerful another character is
Hf is kinda in the middle since you can't really know what's the deal
tfw anime ost is played in an orchestra in church
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXHL_c0SNmg&feature=youtu.be
huh
wow, it really was the same day
yeah, same year
not something I'd call great though
it didn't quite succeed, but it was fun regardless
Nobunaga the Fool was interesting because it tried to be literally everything
they for some reason don't want to just keep the sengoku vibe to it
they always try to freshen it up
this wasn't bad at all though
like, all of it is mid 2000s now, more or less
tbf, we don't have that much nobunaga anymore?
Wakaki Nobunaga is the most underrated!
no its isn't!
it actually looks good too
this is so lit
An anime for Uzumaki?!?!?
No way!!!
No way
Ty
For shield hero
Source?
Millhi
so you can torrent it from nyaa probably
just noticed it on kissanime
ye
youjo senki movie got eng subs
oh wow
Oh
in fact, it hasn't been for 14 years
vinland saga isn't in shonen jump anymore though
not to mention a gripping story
and has a beautiful visual style
it's very powerful in its themes
it's very good
you should give Vinland Saga a chance if you haven't seen it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXqUc-2ighk
another anime people might know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S939GlCnRKI
who remembers this?
i'm 25 but i look 43
took forever to get to the confession part
i remember following it as it was updating
wow, that old thing
Cheesesuke
well, depends on how old she is
Granbelm is good but not for her age
<@377429672264335363> you'd be better off giving her stuff like Precure
never trust the wiki
and the english voices are wonderful. One of the best game dubs I've heard in a while
the character interactions are fantastic
Despite what the premise sounds like, it's not actually a harem
I can vouch for Stella Glow too
it's the same creator after all
Drifters
Oh!
I suppose Konosuba counts due to it being a comedy
there have been so many bad ones I've honestly forgotten which ones were the good ones
how is that a thing
wasn't there one about a fridge?
she might just be the only good thing about this show lol
This extra normie list
What is this shit
No accounting for taste I suppose
yeah but OPM isn't about the training though
Every bloody time
Oh, mid 2000s adaptations
These are... Sorta rarer these days I believe?
Yeah, adaptations that leave open endings due to catching up to the source material and whatnot
pop team epic is just a giant shitpost though
Didnt like the MC too much
Hype fell through for me completely
Couldnt get into mob unfortunately
~~tfw didnt watch any of these~~
I forgot what aired last year lol
Reviews didnt sound so hot
I havent actually seen killing bites
But nipples are the devil's work
Blood and guts are a okay
Remember folks
Never forget the teacher masturbating while wearing MCs gym clothes
I liked the teacher
That shit
Oh my fuck lol
I think the manga went full on hentai at some point
Anime for real cultured folk
To love ru lol
Normally thats how these work I suppose. If theres a winner, itll be the main girl
Oreimo ending lol
so many harems have non endings
JUSTICE FOR ONODERAAAAAA
Oh wait, was special ops asuka this year or last year?
Reminds me of mahou shoujo site
i'd kill for a good yandere anime
Bols though <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
Black clover lol
But well, standing out doesnt necessarily make it better
So they stand out
Usually it's the ones that establish themselves in an odd manner
Some series have a much more pronounced split than others
It felt like nothing was happening
Monogatari series started interesting for me and then just lost my interest
Give ufo Tsukihime
It's a perfect example of why presentation is important
And elevated it with pure style
They took a mediocre series
Thats the thing
The only good recent shonen is Demon Slayer <:KanadeSinging:421432676789256202>
Never watched an episode welp
Oh, that thing
Whats SDS again
In one context in particular <:CarolYandere:424047704826707980>
A whooooole lot
Oh, I definitely heard that line a lot
Black clover aka gets better only after 100 episodes
Actual dogshit
Tsukasa is a shit villain
But right now, it's at the point Id tell people to skip the manga
Demon slayer wouldve sucked if it wasnt ufo
God, Fire Force was so boring
Monster hunter came first
Joke's on you
Isnt god eater like a poor man's monster hunter
At least it had a banger OP
God Eater <:CarolYandere:424047704826707980>
it's also too long
this is deen


hey, it actually looks pretty nice
~~tfw their recent Kochiki Nobunaga actually looks super good~~
a rotting banana peel in the middle of the sahara has more inherent worth in it than MAL scores
good job bots

IS is infinite stratos
it's the same thing lol
did anything of note happen there at all recently lol
is IS still ongoing as an LN?
why would you do that to yourself
fucking knew it
TL NOTES
DID SOMEONE SAY
even the food they make is shit
everything afterwards is shit
just stop there
>Shokugeki no Soma
>Naruto
>Bleach
i mean
there's yet to be an exception
at least we know all battle shonens are destined to have shit endings
evangelion is almost purely super robot
gundam tends to be a mix
my polar opposite lol
MCU is its own continuity now
well, MCU and comics have diverged completely at this point
the only time this meme was funny in any context was with thanos, and that's when it's being used to refer to traffic jams or some shit like that
well it *is* a meme after all
curse of balal indeed
all's good
Ah i was referring to Barty. I did read Berserk
Im not sure I completely understand but to each their own
awwww, why is fate zero off limit though
all of their faces look the same across every show
as soon as I saw the faces I knew the studio was Xebec
that actually sounds pretty neat
comedy mecha huh
for a second I thought you meant captain planet and I was so confused
lol what do they still use in dai-guard? bayonets?
are there also a few series you've accepted you'll always hate?
china are the real target market
and in the end
because their cash cows are leaving
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZApFlVeSOAk
I like this one
and I was extra confused
once again I misread and read that as "MLP is good mecha"
What is?
the series about fires has only managed to be wet
how ironic
Kouta treated the belt as a game
being scared of death is a natural reaction
Sagara wasn't a straight up villain though. He was the representation of the forest, and he's more akin to a natural phenomenon than a person.
Kouta being mopey made sense because he was terrified of the belt
Every villain was defeated
But the main villain didnt get away?
blame the otaku market who thought VNs and porn were inseparable
chalk it up to being the first VN of the company when it was still considered a doujin software maker
Shiki was... kinda rapey in the VN
Although let's not try to sugarcoat it
mollusks
||"Suppress Roa in my ass Shiki!"||
in the trash
it's kancolle just... not crap, I suppose?
What is this anime twitter and why does anyone care about this "competition"
This list is beyond bafflingly stupid
I loled

DE ARU KA
really putting the mad in their name
sasuga madhouse
THEY ANIMATED THE ED IN UNREAL ENGINE?!?
UNREAL ENGINE?!
?!?!?!?!
well... this is something you don't see every day
I'm waiting for the one true king
what's the name?
I second that
I think i did something similar at 12 years old on powerpoint
"Animation"
yeah, the problem with these slow burners is that if they fail to grab you right from the start, you're not going to be satisfied until waaaaaayyyyy later down the line
stuff like FSN, you mean?
define anime VNs
i've heard the progressive LNs are a massive improvement
there's definitely worse shows
but yeah, the hate for it is overblown
it's no secret that SAO has a lot of problems
i completely forgot most of the things I planned to follow
1993
huh, I'm also one year younger lol
takeuchi before saber took over his mind
old art after all
it is
what's up?
yes cypher?
5* Pokelabo Spy Class Servant
||Millhi was shemha all along||
pffft
you guys still get presents?
bit of a strange decision to do so without extra and unlimited though
that's way too hype yo
still, getting an alternative anime
sub based?
yeah the previous muvluv gacha game crashed hard
the kickstarter has yet to deliver on that
mobile game is more like mobile version of muvluv
ASDHAJKDHSAD
FUCKING
NO
NO FUCKING WAY
NO WAY
no way
did every season have a different studio lol
<:MikuBliss:336657233712513024>
it has a translation for sumika's route iirc
cos there's a hellish minigame
i only did one route though
i did
i don't remember all the details
I think I did it to uh... Meiya? not sure
I forgot <:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
i didn't even know it was going on
i missed it completely goddamn
he was?!?!
twizzlers fucked me up a bit the first time ngl
chomp or twizzlers?
I ate everything I could find
i injected that shit into my veins like a madman
the first time i discovered muvluv
but what's that about BETA in extraverse?!?!
https://twinfinite.net/2019/10/new-muv-luv-action-game-code-named-project-mikhail-announced-for-pc-and-mobile/
I saw some of the screens here:
NANI
n-nani
raised over a million dollars for a localization
considering they know how big their western fanbase is
they probably will
cos the second half is pretty hype
that wouldn't be so bad actually
wonder if they'll take that into consideration at all
the tsukihime anime is considered so bad it's easier to pretend it doesn't exist
in a nutshell
why did you send an empty picture?
it's actually pretty catchy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTNjspzDj48
https://tenor.com/view/coincidence-ithink-not-coincidence-ithink-not-the-incredibles-gif-5096707
>Ghost in the Shell: SAC 2045
>Gear confirmed to happen in 2045
jaguarman was more badass than she had any right to be
and it's the complete opposite of what you'd expect from her
cos she voices Kiara in Fate
freaking crazy
rie tanaka is both neptune and purple heart righT?
but the game had its fair share of difficulty
story is entirely forgettable to completely nonexistent
I played VII and it was fun all things considered
it was born for this
that's its purpose
but yeah, neptunia is jokes, memes, and waifus
purple heart though
I mean neptunia is just jokes and memes all the time
like totally like totes like shut up! ‚ù§ üôâ O.M.G
but it's also very very ecchi
parallel paradise also has action
https://mangakakalot.com/manga/machigatta_ko_wo_mahou_shoujo_ni_shite_shimatta
https://manganelo.com/manga/parallel_paradise
WARNING: ridiculously ecchi, bordering on hentai. Still pretty good somehow
https://mangakakalot.com/manga/kekkon_yubiwa_monogatari
https://mangakakalot.com/manga/dv919347
not finished, and pretty short, but it's sfun
what's the story behind that?
only the greatest anime get 1/1 figures of waifus
<:CarolBlush:617039657896509460>
as if it'd be anything less
not many get to have a real life sized waifu
<:KirikaSpook:605209108827734017>
to love ru is anime for the highly cultured
to love ru?
did someone say
everyone: visible concern.jpg
"Reborn as a dog in another world!"
Tags: ecchi
just like most things
there's probably an anime for that
more like people are weird
i've always found it weird that a lot of people are so averse to seeing a bit of a naked body, but are perfectly fine with seeing the bloody guts within that body
sounds very american
my greatest weakness!
oh no! nipples!
sounds like good shit
intermingle of sex and violence I see
but we love it cos it's fun
it's stupid and it's total trash
don't bother with to love ru if you don't like borderline hentai
i should reread to love ru
reborn as a dog, a mouse, a sword, a fridge, a vending machine, a kitchen, a doll
and it's just a collection of similar isekais
when all of the big name anime have ended
at some point there'll be a season of nothing but isekai
but let's not give it credit it doesn't deserve
yeah
i don't trust isekai to have social commentary
iirc sono hanabira is the one with the really out of place gameplay element no?
can always scour vndb
just watch strawberry panic for pure yuri
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djoO-LJxfvo
this legendary ost
i love it when a fantasy character sees modern technology and is blown away by it
outbreak company
speaking of fun isekais
re creators?
pfft, hell if I know
vision of escaflowne no?
and mecha love their politics
in addition, alternative is mecha
at most I see an episode 0 summarizing extra and unlimited
and even then, alternative is fucking looooooooooong
alternative without extra and unlimited is like whaaaaa
it's welcome, but also worrying
it's either gonna be great or it's gonna flop hard
like, wtf
i know right
like how age just announced alternative anime
japanese companies love leaving things to anniversaries
and it just so happens that tsukihime's 20th anniversary is next year
he recently mentioned that he's play testing the remake actually
at least he's leaving the fgo writing team after part 2 is over
my dream vn is TSUKIHIME REMAKE REEEEEEEEEE
How I wish shin koihime was Tled
<:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
and central was the last time you could say it was anywhere near interesting
that's all i'll say
it was a non-ending, basically
but the ending was god awful
tbh, that's a pretty neat premise
it took all of what people like in shonen and then just applied it to cooking
kinda like how shokugeki technically counts as battle too
battle
and then they have to wrap up within like what, a month?
they just keep on going until they're told to stop
also, yeah
fuck, even fist of the north star had a somewhat poopy ending
about as likely as HxH's author not being on hiatus forever
if he ever finishes the damn thing
somehow not a single shonen jump author can write a good ending
i loved it though
reborn was... fine, I guess
shokugeki no soma pooped
bleach pooped
naruto pooped
tbf, when was the last time a battle shonen that ended had a successful ending
and yet somehow married sakura in the end
the goku template ran its course with goku himself
I prefer him to naruto and luffy, who're basically the same character
yeah, it was my favorite too
i watched a few bleach openings and endings and got hit by nostalgia too
hence why we pretend it doesn't exist
without them it's easy to brush him off as an idiot
and his thought processes are critical for understanding his character
he comes from a VN after all
not really
because you can't animate his thought processes
the real problem is that no matter the adaptation, people will still dislike shirou
it's an ok entry to the franchise
it's not as bad as people make it out to be
you can't sleep on kawai kenji's compositions
what deen stay night did well is ost
sorry, haven't seen the dubs for both to compare
the plot is having no plot
i suppose at this point it's like the simpsons
but whether it's good or not means little if it doesn't interest you
it probably does, from the little i've seen of it
too long
even if it is, i'm not watching it
>6 instances of gintama at the top 20
but anything regarding rankings is so completely useless it might as well not be there
maybe for just having a repository for anime
that was your first mistake
>MAL
while not as epic as alternative, it does have the same weight to it
a very gripping and engaging story
truth is a great sendoff to the story
you should
the only thing I can say is to try and power through it
which makes it a lot more interesting
meanwhile, truth is a direct sequel to deception, thus you already know everyone and everything and are already in the thick of things
because it's stuck in the world building
and deception really need a while to get going
like, you also need the context of the first
that's alright
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBdkaA1Tl7o
the original is getting a remake for ps4 and vita
yeah, they're sequels to it
i played it, and while fun, it's ultra short
it's more like a musou game
but it's not part of the narrative
yeah
and Zan
mask of truth
mask of deception
currently it has
well, it will be third once the remake of the first comes out
third
so you hear the grand finales are being animated
what they had that got animated was just... not very good
for both of these
it's like
and this is after hearing utawarerumono mask of truth is also getting animated
so much can go wrong
god, will alternative anime *work*
you have time for this KGB shit while on the verge of annihilation?
schwarzesmarken was also kinda ???
at least the second half is apparently a lot better
too bad total eclipse was kinda boring
that shuffle around like bugs
they already look like walking ballsacks
spoilers üò¨
and I consider myself able to handle stuff like that
that shit broke me
just so we get an "idea"
it'd probably get condensed into a series of vague frames
absolutely no way
you can take out twizzlers though that's fine
i won't forgive them if they dont
they have to
maybe even more
at least alternative is linear
and it doesn't have anything going for it like deen stay night
and all in all, trying to condense 5 routes into 12 episodes was like what
the sort of washed out clamp style but in a bad way
the character designs were also really ugly
the hurt makes us sad
it did
arguable, but that's not a talk for right now
the new mobile game is garbage
So yeah, Fist needs a new anime
I'd prefer we move away from talking about it
amongst other, similarly unlikable qualities but I won't get into that now
if it's more than 50 i probably won't watch it
in any case, i've ran out of patience for long runners
but I meant jojo
well, I suppose dragon ball fits the bill too
unlike ahemahem another shonen from the time ahemahem
it also ended when it needed to
it started, lived, and died in the era of Schwarzenegger and Stallone action movies
even the anime never left the 80s
it never had the need to change
and well, Fist completed its run in the 80s
Fist without men the size of a mountain wouldn't be Fist at all
of course
as fun as it is
we can't stay with an anime from the 80s
a new anime that adapts the story
fist needs a remake
except it's not kenshiro at all
and of course, kenshiro is here too
it's just that his artstyle has remained exactly the same
but it's not
you'd think this is a page straight out of fist

his artstyle hasn't changed a bit in over 30 years
the god behind fist of the north star
drawn by motherfucking Tetsuo Hara
and then lately I found a nobunaga manga I never knew about
but it was just a boring 2 minute narrator summary
so I thought I'd at least get a good look at their interpretation of that battle
mainly about his conflict with his brother
the whole anime is a dramatized version of nobu's life before he became a conqueror
nope
summarizing nobu's greatest battle in 2 minutes
not a great ending though
I was caught off guard by the yaoi tease, but it was still pretty fun
it wasn't shit
although to be fair, they did good on wakaki nobunaga
i will sudoku
both of which had anime in the past that failed
the grand finales to two famous VN trilogies
both alternative and truth are getting animated now
in any case
it's honestly a major part as to why alternative was so good
it's crazy
you can actually hear it getting further away
when a tfs fires a shot
like, rugp allowed for things like distant sounds
all the crazy movements and surround sound of alternative is thanks to that
that's the name of the engine
nope
the magic of rUGP
can she fit in back pack
this video is fucking more than a decade old
uploaded in 2007
it seems they upgraded to 480p though
I think I watched this anime on this specific channel
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5esri7wvSw8&list=PLEEC5B9D318E2D14B
amen
even worse than I imagined
jesus fuck
it was 2 years?!?
remember when naruto had a full year of filler?
i'm so sick of filler
but one continuous story that has no end in sight is a no
if it's 2 or so season then it's fine
same ayamine
but I meant a new anime for the original story
i actually have to finish watching it lol
fist of the blue sky
lol what
It was honestly super forgettable
I dont remember most of it
The most random ass ping pong sequence in the world
Remember the ping pong
Lol i remember that
Im sold!
well why didn't you say so earlier!
but in SPACE?!
is fairy tail
Eden Zero
you mean to tell me
wait
yoko kanno?
naturally he loses
he picks a fight with a windmill
a spanish chuuni
<@87512939107450880> same
<:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
>of the 6
The manga is fun
The anime was awful
Lol shomin sample
yeah lol it's hilarious
dokuro chan wow
they actually look good in real life as well
just look up some images of real life yukatas
I lost interest around index season 3
<:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
fan of kaiju then
oh right I forgot <:HibikiWhoops:585839808115507222>
well, if you're not a fan of toku and all that, it's understandable
is that some kind of food?
>watching anime legally
if we wanna be technical, alice in wonderland was the first isekai
you think someone didn't think of the concept beforehand?
not even close
tfw anime animators dunk on western ones
But what about *free* anime
just isekai into pokemon
saya no uta anime adaptation when <:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
the curse of adaptations
"Naturally, I knows the hacker"
ever 17 was fun
pray for it to be good, regretfully expect it to be awful
i'm too busy adjusting my expectations for the upcoming muvluv alternative adaptation
he somehow levels up in cross days to be even worse
if you thought makoto was a douche in school days
and then there's cross days <:TsubasaDisgust:349013662775902209>
just go play school days <:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
is it a build up on the original, or a near complete change of style
it depends on what you define art evolution
at the end
ah my goddess at release
ah my goddess for example
I kinda disagree because I've definitely seen starker evolutions is artstyle
enjoyable read like the first time
i recently reread rosario vampire
millhi speaks to my soul
but kinda unremarkable
had some cool twists and turns
it was fun
i'm still cleaning my brain off the floor cos that show just left me gaping in confusion
which was also an anime that was definitely an anime
and then there was yumi kuma arashi
lmao
it was definitely a show
with each iteration leaning towards one or the other more
iirc gundam tends to be both real and super robot
don't most of them already have that?
just check ffnet's xover section heh
I'm sure someone did that already
~~WHOOOAAAA LIVING ON A PRAYER!~~
no idea what you're talking about
happy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SIF5BLyh3Mk
that's a heartwarming adventure with pokemon like characters
go watch narutaru instead
you're right
cos it isekais the whole goddamn school and it also has more interesting characters
seinarukana imo is better
>get physical copy with sumika figure
>give 150 dollars
>see kickstarter
>be me, pirate all of muvluv
not as crazy as me
I suppose you can try the utawarerumono trilogy if you haven't yet
man of goddamn culture
ever tried princess waltz?
or just sit on the shelf
like, to play and all
hmm
ah so you want some VNs to own
did you try the sequel?
ah shit
has permadeath
hard af
also has great gameplay
legit good VN
ye
ever heard of eien no aselia?
aight so
I remember one VN about...
but takes place in the countryside so you can be forgiven for forgetting that
It's a somewhat semi-dystopian future
I personally liked it a lot
Sharin no kuni?
let's see
lol I"m here
i forgot a lot of the vns I played
both games sold super poorly so nobody cares about them anymore
lol, no chance
you have to play like an idiot to get it though
||MC loses his mind, becomes evil, and proceeds to hentai corrupt all the girls or enslaves them or whatever. some dumb thing like that||
it was pretty dumb
the conquest ending
lmao
so you have to play through the same tough levels multiple times
and has a lot of routes
also yeah, the game is tough as balls as times
only good as supports
surprisingly, I haven't played it
little busters
ahhh
what's that
never heard of litbus
playing the game is a hassle
it's fine just watching it tbh
yeah for the life of me I can't remember a lot of the Vns
made by the people of ever 17
weird yuri thing
Aoishiro
remembered another one
completely forgot the name though
if you do, you become the ghost
so you can choose whether to give her your life force or not
I think it was that you meet this girl who died, but didn't have a chance to confess to her senpai
rinse repeat
and find out it's shit
you play it
and finally, after going through all of that to get the game ready and playable
it was either squares or random characters or just question marks
but you get error messages in klingon or some shit
you finally install everything
the locale thing is hilarious
you trick the computer into thinking it has a cd port
you learn about daemon tools
you don't know how to install it
you look for the TL patch in some weird looking site you've never heard of
you download it on 40 kb per second because like 3 people in antarctica still seed it
you find the game
by that time, you've met every single hot mom in your area
look around for the game for hours
sailing the high seas ten years ago and rummaging around the internet for isos, translations, cracks, and patches
is good to have people on board the vn train
amongst other things yeah
mostly cos shiki is kinda rapey
tsukihime's are somehow even worse
nasu's h scenes have to be experienced
ryukishi couldn't write porn to save his life
lmao
but terrible h scenes are part of the experience!
gn
this is coming along with the mahoyo translation that came back to life recently
lel
if you want I can link you the discord channel
ye
so expect a release in the coming months
the muvluv team says it's practically finished
altered fable translation soon
actually
every little piece that existed down to the fanfics
I was so hooked I consumed everything I could find of it
god, the first time I finished muvluv
quit your job to play vns forever
First time I read it, I fucking loved it
hopefully it's good
looks... interesting
kaiju decode?
is good
awww shit
nope
>unique language
>practically stole it from the chinese
and kick
precures always punch
aside from like one season
funny thing is
Aoi Yuuki confirmed as the VA of the MC of the new precure season
https://www.asahi.co.jp/precure/healingood/character/curegrace.html
Well isnt it a comedy
but it was fun
somewhat confusing at parts due to the weird canonicity
but after so long without code geass content, it's nice to have something
isn't really that necessary to see
pure fanservice for fans more than anything else
it was nice
just saw the code geass movie
Yorokobe, baka!
people just forgot about mirai nikki lol
yanderes kill everyone else around the protagonist so they can have him to themselves
yanderes don't do that
nah nah nah
that's a fake yandere
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjPigquaRcE
<@!87512939107450880> it was simply meant to be
seinarukana
In one game a whole school gets isekaied multiple times
~~separated itself from britannia~~
yeah I think his arc with Setsuna didn't really get resolved all that well
so it felt like they were all talk
The innovators were all like "WE'RE BETTER THAN HUMANS!" and at no point actually show this
season 1's was forgettable, and season 2's were just... eehhhhh
tbh, I think the antagonists for both seasons were just really boring
It had its moments of being all over the place, but overall, a fun show
I liked it
It was pretty good
Just finished Gundam 00
i'm always down for more higurashi
because they only end when they're cancelled
shounen shows are built to be slow
same
you looking for manga?
also the most adorable protecc in the world
watch sweetness and lightning for good father
you can go back a little bit and watch summer wars
it just sucks they stuck all those spoiler scenes in
it's a passable enough entry to the franchise which is honestly enough
what a stupid mistake to make
took me a second lol
sometimes pure trash is nice
it's pure trash
it's not even surprising at this point
Just another one that'll join the ranks of shit endings
AoT pulling a normal battle shonen more like it
but it doesn't do anything new or exciting
i haven't seen it, but from what I've seen people say, it takes every shonen trope and somewhat refines it
it's more of that
yeah I don't think it'll change your mind if you don't like battle shonens
lmao alright
i'm right
when?
i'm down
what're we doing?
it's not too anime to be impossible to animate
I mean..... it *could* work?
uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
i bet this happened at some point
she's just mad cos nanoha shippuden is the best anime ever
I assure you I have many likes!
I don't read *just* Nanoha Shippuden!
Shirabe!
üü£
shoo shoo
I already called dibs
whoa whoa whoa
he dies a lot but that's okay
not even the author
okay, that makes sense
https://twitter.com/hypdadaist/status/954213509113327616
ah here found it
never read said novel so I don't really know
from what I'm seeing, it was brought up in the novel and the context says something else
really? I've seen quite a few people claim otherwise
that's all there is to him really
astolfo is just a crossdresser
sub is out?
He actually ran an interview with shindol
He legit has some interesting content
The anime man
it sometimes feels like he's just jumping on the bandwagon to make a video on it
he makes extensive videos on the show everybody knows are good or popular already
gigguk is alright but most of the time he just says things people already know
Now whenever I look someone relating to it up, I notice just how strange reality was in relation to fiction
before Fate I had next to no interest in history
makes you interested in things
Sometimes anime does that
LMAO
that's just hilarious
now people from both sides are bombarding both fmab and reviewers with 1's
good
legendary
oh man
omfg reviewers is gonna pass fullmetal alchemist on MAL soon hahahahahahahaha
It's very basic as it's just an introduction to the concept
From the parts I saw/read, ironically part 1 was the most memorable
Depth and subtlety isnt something it's good at
And that's what it delivered
Let's say you dont go to jojo expecting anything more than your usual shonen shenanigans
Fate is still more interesting by a wide margin
It's easier to adapt a manga than a visual novel like Fate
make sure to dedicate your souls to the top 10 at all times
you'll have, god forbid, shit taste
you must follow it or anime jesus will smite you to anime hell
but guys, MAL is literally anime bible
went nowhere and there was no real endgame to it
although the plot is completely meh
with fun character and concept
bite sized gundam-like mecha
nothing amazing, but passable
it was alright
finished watching Buddy Complex today
The show is trying to cross as many lines as it can
and just is a story about a genius sadistic girl in a magic ww1 setting
the fun thing is that it quickly stops being an isekai
<@!263534352422404096> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVjN3nwvJto
just that? wew
<@99695384296701952> which iteration of Mazinger would you recommend to watch?

what's up?
ye
nasu loved that and made it a part of emiya's arsenal since then
the wing swords are called overedge
EYEEEEEE EM DE BON OVU MAI SORD
The public's taste is obvious
Obviously the public will pick aot
Xv got 3rd place pshiiiii
Hugtto got voted beat anime of the year on r anime?
Wait what
Both in terms of hype and in terms of narrative
Heaven's Feel is the apex of FSN
The spoiler parts ruin it
Deen stay night can be removed I suppose
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
Hush you
That's the "general" order to it
2006 FSN -> UBW > Heaven's Feel movies -> Zero
<:HibikiWhat:336656482907193344>
ping when it happens
i'm down for amq
shun the heretic
put everything you remember you watched
y'all zoomers
Like they should
neither will berserk
at this point it's just not going to happen
hunter x hunter will never finish
long running shonens just don't work the way they used to
same goes for one piece
cos he's not getting any younger
if he ever ends it
it remains to be seen how it'll end
even if it required him to basically scrap everything that came before and restart the series
araki was smart to move away from it
shonen jump is a really shitty magazine
honestly for all the great works it provides
he barely slept iirc
after the absolute insanity that was soul society and hueco mundo
and what did he make? two subpar arcs
yet they forced him to continue
it should've ended with aizen
this is why bleach fell hard
and then shonen jump gets its greedy grip on them and milk them for all they're worth
the problem is when they start the series without really knowing how they want to end it
even older manga like dragon ball and fist of the north star fell to the shonen syndrome
but it's not completely free of it either
it managed to sorta get away with it because it changes its setting and characters every part
it's too long for its ending to be worth anything now
one piece is 100% going to be hit with it too
and its quality dropped as the result
longer than it should've
went too long
shokugeki was hit with shonen syndrome
trash arc
this is awful
ugh are they really adapting this
the one belonging to your favorite anime
if you like that sort of thing, you'll enjoy it
the toppest of top culture anime
to love ru is the kind of show that pushes the limit of ecchi as much as it can
tfw season 3's animation is garbage tier
>date a live
you can thank me later
ah my goddess
Skeptical af
but how is lelouch still up there
i can understand kirito being on top cos his anime is still airing
the anime aired when it wasn't even finished
the manga had a more solid ending
wtf ash has a gengar and a dragonite now?!
believability level: flat earthers
Yep
The way the plot constantly bent over backwards for her whims didnt sit well with me
Kanami felt Mary Sueish
every single bit of cool was rendered pointless
The dumb stuff was so dumb they outright ruined what the show had established until then
I couldn't, sorry
so the only real way you can decide is by giving it a chance
you see here two opposing opinions
I say you be the judge
a big red flag was also the fact that the main fight choreographer had to explain how exactly Kanami won a fight she shouldn't have
it has a lot of style, that's true, but the substance is practically non-existent
by that point I was close to the end so i saw the last three episodes
obliterating every bit of significance the show had until then
where it's revealed Kanami is secretly OP af and could've trivialized every single fight up until that point
i watched it with friends, and the moment I realized how bad of a problem Kanami was to the story as a whole was in ep 21
maybe this OVA will be much better considering it has a different protagonist
the choreography was nice, but Kanami single handedly ruined everything else
didn't have fun at all at any point
thought it was really bad
a lot
I disliked the show
Uhhh...
both seasons

RETURNS
BLEACH
~~why does garindelia have UBW in this clips~~
Waiting for next season
I watched the new anime and played the musou game and liked both
arslan senki for something more traditional
imagine watching all of one piece
hence why I've stopped watching anything longer than 50
Also Ichika fucking wishes he was keiichi
He's beyond the reach of even heaven
Nah, not even Belldandy can cause such denseness in a protag
Lmao
and disease
And doctors
Because the premise is about healing
Healing Good Precure is also surprisingly fitting right now
go watch and then give me the answer <:TsubasaUpset:672861878703357968>
noob
you gave the impression you did
nani
it sounds like someone who used to be in kalafina but I can't pinpoint it
in ep 13
<@!152896851660505088> do you perhaps know who sang the ending song?
we didnt
seems highly unlikely tbh
probably just you
ORE WA GUNDAMU
Deen stay night at least has incredible music
That's pretty awful even production wise
The real meme is tsukihime anime
Yeah it's not the worst
the funny thing is
youjo senki isn't even set in that period
idiots
bla bla bla nazis bla bla bla?
there're better ones in manga form but it's pretty nice
it's fun
but yeah, otome villainess tends to be a little more interesting than your average isekai
> Oh, hey. That Otome Villainess LN/manga got an anime adaptation. It's always a bit odd how the gender dynamics of the isekai genre tend to make male MCs bland AF self-inserts whereas female MCs have a decent chance of winding up with actual personality.
<@!445783190976856065> YOU'RE LATE
Haku <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
oh well I'll do it tomorrow
oh right I wanted to watch the kaguya-sama live action
it's actually pretty good
yeah
but you gotta analyze and think about the right things
it's fun to analyze and think about things
like
that's cos every other person thinks they're a political analyst
it's an excuse for tanya to be crazy
the empire's political leanings aren't even directly stated
not even close
it's not about that at all
that's for the people who read too much into it

rakudai mc got together with the main heroine 4 episodes in
asterisk mc is a wimp like very other mc!
rakudai's mc has actual baaaaaaaallsss
long live rakudai
asterisk was shit
slap the wangst out of the whiny dude
except instead of on machines it's on people
good ol' percussive maintanence
bright slap is a thing after all
all the "be a real man!" and all that jazz
you know, 70s-80s
as was the norm for mid 2000s anime
so the ending is totally different
the anime aired before the manga finished
The manga went in some weird directions
needless was fucking awesome
> a harem anime i actually liked was needless

oh shit I didn't know aoi shouta sang the ending for bakarina
eventually all the cool scifi stuff will become real
give it a few centuries
https://twitter.com/Jaehaerys48/status/1254609654149189637
the manga had it, but it wasn't this exaggerated
the problem with the anime was that it went too ham with the fanservice
it doesn't really have a middle point
and absolute trash when it's bad
fate kaleid is really good when it's good
eh
t-there was a right answer?
cardcaptor sakura
and some say madoka too
compilation movies that should be watched are Gurren Lagann's
it doesn't really offer anything new
death and rebirth is just a compilation movies of the series
but that's it
cute main heroine
> Hmm...anyone watched Dimension W?
<@!457268466429329429> i did. it was... fine
shinami maou testament for instance started off as heavy ecchi and then just became pretty much hentai
to love ru
just go watch the ultimate anime of culture
you've seen nothing
plz
mayo chiki is what you call heavy ecchi?
which was the best one
the sad thing is that the anime never touches on the manga's last arc
yeah, two movies
2? movies iirc
it has uhhh
my man
SORA NO OTOSHIMONO
<@!87512939107450880> DID I SEE
are you recommending us nanoha?
twintail is if symphogear was full blown comedy
see if it speaks to you
give it a few episodes
just try it out
age 16
i had a big lonely period as a weeblet so I didn't talk with anyone about anime until like
you dont watch those knowing they were anime
i dont count childhood anime like pokemon, dbz, or yugioh
claymore
after that I saw...
caught it late at night when I was like 12
ghost in the shell movie
i think mine was...
but it's only 12 episodes so it's bite sized
in hindsight it's kinda like whatever
I really liked kannazuki no miko as it's one of my first anime ever
yeah exactly
two girls one guy
it has three main characters
the reason I can see someone hating it is honestly because of the mecha or not liking the male protagonist
first time I ever heard someone describe it as such
kannazuki no miko being creepy/gross?!?! <:HibikiWhat:336656482907193344>
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2gzroX4bAU
<@!87512939107450880> you have this too
Yeah popularity isnt a measure of quality
Chef of nobunaga, komachi sengoku, and buronson's manga all have him be awesome af
In manga they tend to give him a better depiction
Literally their king arthur
Or nobunaga concerto
I mean who here heard about nobunaga the fool
Seriously
Super robot wars X literally fixed everything wrong with buddy complex
It had no point as a show
Buddy complex was boring
Anime is mostly word of mouth after all
<@160142617940590594> have you seen strawberry panic?
No shortage of sites
Just torrent or stream through kissanime or something
Most old anime is inaccessible otherwise
You can always pirate
Omega super text
Ultra text
It's gay supreme
It's right up your alley
i know Armageddon is a thing
any consumable getter robo season that isn't the 1970s one?
as an aside
and I wanna watch infinity too
will read the manga after it
lel, started with the anime
it's told in a very weird way but it's pretty damn cool
what i'm currently catching up on is shin mazinger
Nu-Gundam
So I took Haman out of that dumb looking Quebeley and put her in a real machine
the good thing about srw is that you can put any gundam pilot into any gundam
~~still fresh from srw but that still counts right?~~
it looks kinda dumb
i don't like the quebeley in general tbh
<@!87512939107450880> haman karn best girl
Masa-san best girl
Thats just the start
One of my favorite anime ever
Now i want to too
Cypher y u do dis to me
The truck got reincarnated in another world
Chuck norris was once hit by a truck
and give him koihime musou too <:MariaChuckle:672465496515411984>
it's awesome
the mazinger units were kinda... well, not weak, but not impressive
I kinda had a feeling after its appearance in T
it interests me so at most I'll just be like 'eh, whatever'
even if it's not great I'll watch it
yeah they made a new studio just for that
and then in 2002 came the longer version
yeah the OG had one volume
i mean the OG manga came out in 1985
only someone that sounds like her
or not?
fucking hell
and aoi yuuki was in it too
you saw it too?
my man
the superman one
no
lmao
the man of steel movie had a homage to this anime
just so you know
https://www.amazon.com/Mazinger-Robot-Chogokin-Action-Figure/dp/B01N30PNQ1
i've had my eye on a mazinger zero one and was wondering if it was worth
<@!99695384296701952> how knowledgable are you about mecha figures?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhWrbaeooCY
gleipnir is the edgy of the season
and among all on the list, the mazinger zero one is the most expensive
the mazinkaiser one looks awesome too
they have a bunch of other stuff
so you'd say this is a good deal?
it looks pretty cool
so in this case, they'd want you to buy the light novel
adaptations are usually used as marketing for the source material
because it's 12 episodes and will never get a second season
the anime won't even get that far
it depends what the harem is adapting from and how far along said harem is in its story
the microphones aren't as good?
it's like
like, if you compare it to other anime
i noticed that the voice audio in bakarina is kind of odd
I suppose my answer would be jonathan joestar
that's true
sounds like an assault rifle but with extra steps
this is why i'm not getting into light novels lol
it also wanks katanas lol
forgettable af
which made it a mess and it spoils a bunch of things about them unnecessarily
the first anime made in 2006 tried to incorporate elements from the other routes
the problem with fate's anime adaptations is
I ignore that idiotic comment
fuck nasu for that, seriously
it's basically divided into:
if you like reading, VN
if you don't, UBW anime
people just overcomplicate it
don't worry about it Carols
the main content isn't longer than your average show
yeah it just has a bunch of spinoffs
Fate is not nearly as big as this
it's not optimal, but better than nothing
same
because he sat on his ass
i've been a fan of fate for over 10 years and I heavily dislike a lot of the things nasu and the other writers chose to do with the formula
but otherwise, don't bother
it's only worth getting into if you really *really* like fate
but because it expects you to at least know all the fate entries
no just because it's gacha
and is the last thing i'd ever tell a newcomer to get into
fgo is a whole different creature on its own
it's the exact kind of thing that makes it more annoying to deal with
honestly, fuck gigguk for that video
it doesn't help that it has a bunch of spinoffs you have no reason to care about
not because of fanaticism
fate's fandom make getting into it tough because of overcomplication
fate's fandom is annoying
don't listen to the overarching fandom
when you get to it just say so and we'll clarify
just don't worry about it now
and it's a problem because it's the introductory route
It's a butchered adaptation that just doesn't really work
that's the one I'm talking about
eh, wasn't impressed
it's multiple narratives taking place at the same time
they're not different arcs
nah durarara isn't like that
it's a bunch of different ones tied together
it's not a straight up narrative
if you dig the concept
not sure how much you'll like durarara
not a bad list
maybe the new studio will deliver something worthwhile
he needs to get out of his ass
hell, now those same concepts take a *full* page to explain
but he still does that
he never stopped being chuuni
you start with any anime you want for any reason
out with that bull
no such thing as a must
anime isn't as underground as it used to be
nope
keeping track of who's doing what where and why
it can get kind of confusing
and how their stories connect to each other
i remember some portugese folk trying to turn it into a real sport
because publishers have no ***C U L T U R E***
hottake, but there's no such thing as turning your brain off
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
just ebcause of how ridiculous the concept is and how seriously they take it
as stupid as it is
keijo is unironically fun
it's just pure bizarreness
it's not even memes
pop team epic is above the confines of mere anime
please millhi you can't put that on the level of the regular, boring stuff
there's no such thing as the best
i disagree
nah
not any different from other shows
it has some neat ideas but it falters a lot
sao is really not that bad
like ffs, people use sao as a metric as to how bad something is
when there's way worse shit
people overplay how bad it is
shitting on sao is just pointless bandwagoning at this point tbh
i recently reread it and I didn't even notice
lmao
the manga of darkness became **I CAN'T BELIEVE IT'S NOT HENTAI** levels
now *that's* culture
lmao to love ru
jeez
even I didn't notice
wow it kept going that long?
^truth
it's a one episode ova
mars of destruction is kind of a bad example though
everyone has shit taste
anime fans love flexing their interests at other anime fans in an attempt to appear as having supreme taste or some shit like that
circlejerks
this all circles back to the default state of anime fandom
you're still allowed to think so
yeah they did
a personal friend of mine is the TLer for that so it'll be great to have as many opinions on it as possible <:Cag:423197445644615711>
yep
go read 86
i have a rec
if we're talking light novels
cypher
it's harem, basically
It managed to tackle stuff that Precure doesn't usually tackle in a positive, mature manner
funnily enough, I found Hugtto to be the most gripping when it came to themes
<@!99695384296701952> feel like having some...

oops
> Netsuzou TRap receiving a 5.42 on MAL
>mal
that was your first mistake
it has... somewhat of a plot?
Strawberry Panic is so yuri it doesn't have a single male character in the show
now above that you have omegatext
you like yuri that's text, right?
how badly do you want one of the most omegatext yuris out there
filled with ads but nothing an adblocker cant solve
you can try mangakakalot
because of some bullshittery they do with HQ scans
yes
but it's yuri seduction
i love how it approaches its subject with the seriousness of battle shonen
it's hilarious
lmao the gigolette manga
a similar series would be Maria-sama ga Miteru
but it starts as your fairly typical "catholic academy full of lesbians" that includes a new student and an onee-sama character
i watched it like fifty billion years ago so the details are kind of blurry
through and through
then that's what it is
it's a romance drama
Has some quite realistic medieval combat
You might like Maria the Virgin Witch
products of their time
lots of shows are dated by now
||Don't worry, someone among them will fill that role||
aged like somewhat okay wine
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MR7xA2JbNCQ
especially those that were made when values were looser
FMA isn't so bad in that regard but some shows have aged poorly
it depends
fucking hell
this is why you don't BM

yes

i think gintama is the kind of show you can only watch after watching a bunch of other shows first cos otherwise the humor falls flat
I'm starting to believe he has a fetish for asteroids

it's newer than Gurren Lagann
No, I refuse to believe this
>Shin Mazinger already counts as retro
it being hyped to death and being popular doesn't mean anything
i mean if you like the concept then sure, why not check it out
It's honestly awful
I dont like the last arc
i think whoever made this list forgot their own criteria halway through

those are ecchi?!?
why are there male characters here lol
putting pokemon on the list is cheating

no

a lot easier to grasp and less crabs involved

It's the *good* kind!
Hey! Kannazuki no Miko is not yuri dumpster!
Hottake: the bad shonens are the long winded and exhausting battle shonens
it feels so needlessly chaotic and introduced themes that're pure meh
i don't like this post timeskip arc at all
||remember when attack on titan was about the titans? good times||
mahou shoujo site is ultra edge
¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
Cross Ange was leagues above a lot of the dumb shit they produce today so
but yeah, anime adaptations
~~maybe the writer should stop dragging things on for forever üôÉ ~~
reading 46 volumes is daunting enough
well, you can't blame people who only watched the anime for thinking like this
but even then it's not perfect
yeah
Index has a similar problem
but the adaptations just can't add his internal thought processes in
while in reality he isn't
most famously, Shirou is often seen as a dumbfuck character in the Fate anime adaptations
some of which can be critical to understanding the story
you lose a lot of the things that made the original good
it's the same problem as all adaptations
nobody said it didn't lol
justice league unlimited was cool
but allison there are a lot of actual yuri shows too
what prequel

the sakuga moments were also lit af

||Illya dies in every route, yes. Only in Fate she survives past the war but she dies around a year later.||
das alright
vns by their nature are slow burns
while the VN is usually the way to go, it requires patience to play through
legit carolnein
i mean technically he only has one love interest in each route
and he completely cancelled out kariya's worries
he was utterly ignorant of kirei's internal turmoil and he trusted zouken to be a proper mage
tokiomi's biggest flaw was being a horrible judge of character
old af game
yuri vn
it can only be pirated though
i can hook you up with another called aoi shiro
Sion existing in FGO is already a blessing
nasu needs to stop fucking around
they just look awful and generic and expressionless
I think the character design was the worst
out of all the parts I didn't like about the adaptation
ACTION FIGURE IN WINE
PEOPLE SITTING IN CHAIRS
WOMAN FALLING FROM CASTLE
||Shiki comes from a family of demon hunters so he's extremely good at sniffing the inhuman out. The most egregious scene was in the beginning where he stalks Arcueid to her apartment and cuts her up to pieces, and the narration goes on about how pleasurable it feels to him.||
||he's kinda rapey when it comes to sex||
dude, this chair is only the tip of the iceberg
and shiki is *very very very very* **very** messed up in the head
well, shirou is messed up in the head so that makes sense
maybe type moon protagonists just have weird imaginations
that's old
wow, kannagi
she's part of the church
kirei's kid is caren
you need to know SUN CHAN!
SUN-CHAN!
k
there's also a mixed version with Luna
amazing song
SUN CHAN
And the atrocious animation
Never forget seven deadly sins
It's also boring
Wow not only is it poorly animated
Justice for Kuroneko!
So the entire story got tossed in the trash
So they didnt even stay together
They had a mock wedding and then dropped the whole thing some time afterward
The problem is that they didnt actually end up together
yeah she's not a big name seiyuu but she's good nonetheless

<@!468591607332208641> you said mazinger zero vs great general of darkness hasn't been tled yet right?
i have to question why asanagi of all people is providing art for a light novel
you know that's asanagi, right?\

OYO!!!!
oyo!
> He gave season 1 a 4/10 and season 2 a 6/10
> Overall, he thinks the show sucked and wants to know why people seem to like it so much
<@209536346413465600> 
Well if he wants to know why people like it he should explain why he didnt. Only fair this way
Other people's arbitrary scoring habit dont matter in the least
That's all that matters
It was a nice show
If interspecies reviewers can get memed above FMAB then nothing there actually matters
I thought we roasted MAL enough  to remind people how inconsequential the scores there are
In any case, anime and co are in a weird place when it comes to representation
Yuri and yaoi do tend to get fetishized though so they're somewhat not really well represented
If they like it like that then hey, more power to them
It's simple discussion
Nah
Japan either forgets they exist or use them for jokes
Tbf the ones who force it more tends to be western media
People treat it as gospel
Fuck MAL
But yeah
<a:CUHRAYZEEvera:624583288803033138>
They're weird
Better not to try and de-*CYPHER* other people's standards
MAL is shit and dont listen to anyone there
Bottom line
I give 10s to my favorites regardless of quality
You score how you want to
Like
Hey, good for you man
that's a cool opening
kaiservsggd was honestly eh
it's amazing how tetsuya is given much more spotlight in SRW
I just don't like how Great showed up for a little bit at the start and then vanished completely
I mean I like Kaiser
cos it was the same case in mazinkaiser
is tetsuya's role to be the punching bag until kouji shows up?
yeah... except great wasn't great
it really was a mediocre movie
<@!99695384296701952> wow you were not kidding about mazinger infinity
yeah it's a snoozefest at the start but later gets more interesting
that's nostalgic
wow, hitman reborn
good
i'll toss in getter robo in the middle somewhere
My next go nagai ventures will be cutie honey, devilman, and jeeg
not sure
i read somewhere that it wasn't?
were they even in kaiser vs ggd? i can't even remember
they had a pathetic showing in kaiser vs ggd and infinity
thanks to what impact did for them
asura is by far my favorite villain of the bunch
although I gotta give impact credit for making the characters a little more fleshed out
shin mazinger zero anime never huh
cos if ||pacific rim|| is in then it's pretty damn new
when *did* zero vs ggd come out?
what *really* clinches it for me is that ||zero's ultimate goal was to be the only super robot in existence, as if he's the mazinger franchise's attempt at staying relevant. but then kouji defeats him with the power of every mecha in existence, telling him that it's fine to fall into obscurity because the spirit of mazinger exists in every mecha that came after it||
||Kouji channeling SRW and summoning spectral versions of a fuckton of mechas that came after mazinger, and all of them teaming up to defeat zero||
like, how 2000% meta they went
I read about the finale and it absolutely blew my mind
<@!468591607332208641> btw, how much do you know about the end of zero vs ggd?
too much time wasted on getting to kaiser rather than actually using kaiser
<@160142617940590594> neither are really yuri. While the main characters are girls, they dont really have teasing with each other and they're shown interested in boys
People rag on SAO for being shit but IS is worse in every way
Ichika the black hole protagonist
a precure no-personnel-kid'd a villain
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icyByCTKQ4w
let's not forget this sexy beast of a scene
and then got no-personnel-kid'd herself
no chapters I can find
for ***E D G E***
time
<@!468591607332208641> time for Mazinkaiser SKL
who do I need to pay to get SKL and Zero vs GGD tled
why are all the cool mazinger mangas not TLED <a:illyaPanic:393811760273948673>
<@!468591607332208641> I give Mazinkaiser SKL
666/10 not enough death metal
<@!87512939107450880> mr. light novel, help this poor soul
thug nana
WHAT
being?
in bad harems, both the MC and the girls are poorly written archetypes meant purely for self insert
on most anime, you can tell right away what they were made for
it all depends on the intent of the creator
<@!87512939107450880> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4TP82NezXU
Tachibana-sou i think it was called
there's that *one* yuri harem manga
never forget amagami
I thought it was just scattered tiny groups
> stay as far away from harem manga fanbases as possible
<@!139432096023183360> those have fanbases?
ironic considering their history
i dont think japan understand what polygamy is anymore
Carlos wants to boomer?!?
sora no otoshimono best anime
not only is fist of the northstar super boomer, it's also the series that inspired jojo, so it's only fair to give it a chance
have you ever actually seen fist of the north star?
oh wait carlos
Narutaru
hehehe
*oohh*
but still boomer
well, not that super
go watch Elemental Gelade
for super boomer
anyway carlos
>gave hokuto no ken a 10/10 but dropped at ep 77
cypher plz
ah okay okay
<@!468591607332208641> remind me again in what order to watch getter robo?
i completely forgot it existed
het
that's pretty common in anime though
was a thing that existed
heavy object was...
how much should we expect from their quality
on the other hand, crunchy
on one hand, yay
not sure what to think about precure being licensed
didn't know mazinger vs ggd existed
i'm dumb
oh lmao
it could've been good if the vast majority of the movie wasn't focused on just *getting* to mazinkaiser
tbh, not very good
mazinger vs ggd was...
i'll give them a glimpse later and see if they're interesting
so nothing necessary
ah okay
and great mazinger vs getter?
what about stuff like getter robo + great mazinger + grendizer vs sea monster
I'll get right on watching all these
well, thanks for the help
lmao
||does musashi die again||
while everything is more or less not that necessary
so from the animes, Armaggedon and Shin are the go to
thanks <:GenjuroThumbsUp:336657189475188740>
gurren lagann was awesome af and that was made back when trigger's staff was in gainax
yep, sounds about right
dense + ecchi equals insufferable harem lead
sounds unbearable tbh
he'd wake up accidentally banging one of the girls in his house
lmao yuuki rito
same with spec ops asuka
people are despicable for no real reason and the entire world is horrible just for the sake of being horrible
there's no nuance to anything in mahou shoujo site
it's suffer porn
that's not tragic

w-what
Not Blood Related Sister‚Ñ¢Ô∏è
that one is obvious
people ship in AOT?!
people ship historia and eren?
what is the this
make everyone watch astroboy
at least the show treats it with the respect it deserves
can't do anything about some of the fans being shit
i'm hurt you didn't ping me earlier for it
wow ancient song
This show is basically the embodiment of having a bunch of different producers who have no idea what the other is doing
I rate it Sentient CGI Tank Nobody Ever Seems to Remember/10
something else
definitely
it was
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sisters_of_Wellber
so just watched the first season of this... thing
hugtto was pretty damn good
that's actually kinda impressive
as well as eva and sailor moon apparently
LET'S DO THIS CYPHER
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Misfit_of_Demon_King_Academy
<@!87512939107450880> says yes
is it time to return to my roots in harem?
this looks very 2006
wow
>misfit demon anime
That sounds like someone who's not sun-chan
How to justify incest competition
Guys I think she likes her brother
<:shiroutink:687742053601509399>
does that mean tatsuya doesn't die when he's killed?
who's your pfp and why isn't it sun-chan
also cypher
time to go back to 2006
It's short and it'd be a shame to drop it before you see what it offers
I'd say watch the whole thing
<@!152896851660505088> unsurprisingly, crunchyroll butchered the subs for healin good
fate zero is 24?25?
heaven's feel is three movies (although the third isn't out yet)
ubw is 25
2006 is 26 episodes
hmmmm
good question
that's the order
yep
after that, everything else is an optional spinoff you dont need to bother with
after that, fate zero
after that, the heaven's feel movies
then unlimited blade works
start with the 2006 anime
yes
remove it from your lexicon
dont even think about fgo
dont listen to this aqua person
you are a pirate!
do what you want cos a pirate is free

!!!!!!!!!!
hahahaha okay that's good
qbit it is!
utorrent and bittorrent are apparently adware and malware now so...
they're as strong as the plot requires
neither series has a consistent power system really
vegeta also destroyed whole star systems for shits and giggles
i mean early dbz is also piccolo blowing up the moon with two fingers
the cannon that took her years to build and was pointed towards a specific, stationary, gigantic target in the sky
also no real sense in comparing with characters who can blow up planets with two fingers
miku herself? lol nope
the beams can, sure

not even doing this brain turning off can make it tolerable
kampfer has nothing
infinite stratos at least has that ironic enjoyment factor to it
at least SAO improved after the bad start
when shows like infinite stratos and kampfer exist
I can't believe SAO is still used as a metric for bad series <:TsubasaYareYare:407397617451139073>

<:ShirabeFear:696380146248319066>
i liked it when it was about killing titans
i'm the opposite tbh
big stretch
eh
like it was nice and all, but it feels like nothing was really that connected
I'm... not quite sure what it was trying to do?
<@!468591607332208641> oh yeah just finished new getter robo
and being a cute waifu means you're exempt from being shit!
because she's a cute waifu!
but ardania, everyone know when a pretty anime waifu nags you and is genuinely hell to be with, it's fine!
something something japanese blood bank used her as a promotion symbol and people god pissed for some reason
i thought it was a barren wasteland
there are shows this season?
only series I think manages to get away with being nothing but a tournament arc is record of ragnarok
you don't get to give jojo parts 10s and 9s and not finish hokuto
finish it <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
also cypher how dare you not finish hokuto
reminds me of birdy the mighty
I'd ahve assumed you made it up aya

Millhi you must
SBP and kannazuki no miko
so yeah, I started my venture into anime through yuri lmao
what're they planning
i did kinda like the anime so the movie was nice
it was not bad!
I just finished watching the movie after putting it off for like 3 years
speaking of kancolle
lol yeah very much a stretch
i remember 2
there was a third?
never forget goku vs superman
neither is berserk
hunter x hunter is never gonna finish
lmao deathbattles
hahahahaha
berserk x imas crossover when
familiar of zero and MM! is what I remember

>volume 43
i personally don't like the new arc
it's really really boring
boring
well
healing good is...
you didn't?!
the more of them that pop up, the more they go around being toxic assholes
the bigger it becomes, the more prospective ultra fanatics that can pop up
the more popular a show gets, the bigger its fanbase becomes
it's the fanbase
and at the end of the day, it's not even the show itself that's the problem
it makes people feel smart and special
shitting on sao is just a stupid meme at this point like everything else
people use MAL ratings or other arbitrary rating systems to pretend they have supreme taste and that they're better than everyone else
if someone likes some harem trash more than the so called greats like full metal alchemist, more power to them
every person is different and every person likes different things
other than the people who made it
*nothing* about it is objective
it's bloody entertainment
tbh mal ratings are the absolute worst thing you can use to gauge an anime's quality
ah I wasn't referring to yours
when in the end all they did was copy the opinion of some random popular youtuber
positive or negative
the problem starts when people use analyses (or lack thereof) like this to try and proclaim how much better, smarter, and more mature they are than others
not enough people do it
in fact, do it more
nothing wrong with analyzing media
i didn't watch anything past gun gale
and i'm not even that big a fan
you know they didn't think it up themselves
the fact that people still use it as some metric of how bad something is is just...
honestly, there're anime way worse than sao
and proceed to insult others when those same people like something they don't
people lose their shit when some random strangers on the internet say they don't like their favorite shows
and the more they do that, the bigger the hatedom becomes
rayearth is fun
ayyyyy
<a:clapping:393814714636959744>

your homies suck cocoa
at like chapter 300 or some shit i heard
battle shonens ran out of ideas
black clover is boring
but had a nice cast
had a lot of problems
fairy tail was fun
it's called reddit
the same hole people got the sao is garbage meme from
i mean dragon ball in hindsight isn't very good but I dare you to find an anime that gathered a crowd like this
yeah fuck battle shonens
look how many people
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7o3ZMomtw-M
and showed them
to show the citizens
city mayors pirated the episodes of super
and yet thousands upon thousands of people gathered to watch super's final episodes
and jar jar bizarre escapade fans
the same people who lose their shit when FMAB isn't considered the greatest masterpiece mankind has ever concieved
they're never good
it's reddit takes
old broly is cooler than new broly but new broly is a lot more developed
It's a cowardly ending
God I hate the ending
how dastardly!

dokyuu hentai is something else indeed


it's okay, they'll put it in super robot wars and fix the plot
say what you want about the anime, the op fucking slaps
watch it for frieza singing
however, funnily enough, it was the only one that did it correctly
at the end of the day, Madoka did set the trend for "dark" magical girl shows
no right way to enjoy it
just depends on what you prefer
I personally watched the sub and it was great
just watch it and tell us what you think
that's the part where madoka unveils itself
then what does that make Darker than Black
remember the c-section episode?
hugtto especially
nanoha is more akin to a magical girl army
it has a scary setting, but overall it has an extremely hopeful message and things don't tend to spiral into madness or delve into deep psychological issues
i wouldn't call symphogear dark either
it depends on what your definition of "dark" is
>digibro
I don't really think so
> Nanoha did dark magica girl way before madoka
<@!114081181611458563> can nanoha be really called dark though?
ep 1 of Gear was maybe the closest it got
it was the first one that drew that much attention though
oh definitely
symphogear started in its shadow and then split off to become its own thing
just call it gray magical girl <:HibikiSmug:672655850518609940>
Not as culture as to love ru
~~we're still talking about rebellion right~~
it's truly a masterpiece made by a genius
you're missing the sheer genius behind every scene
you must have 420IQ to understand it of course
i can recite their lines from memory
rewatched it 69 times already
it's my favorite anime
of course
shaft went very ham on the symbolism
I also didn't understand what happened until I saw it the second time
you might need to give it a rewatch at some point
basically, the movie is either an incredible, unexpected twist ending for the series or the worst thing to have ever happened to anime since boku no pico
you forgot that you must also debate whether the ending is fitting for madoka or not
I truly appreciate the subtlety in this show

it's that time of the day

fandoms are trash anyway so just ignore what they say and reach your own conclusion about it
it's a different feel
most important thing though is to not expect OG madoka again
it's pretty good
the second half was confirmed so it's just a matter of waiting for it
no stupid gacha and incredible visuals owed to shaft's talent
it's just better than the game in every single way
the magia record anime proves the game is completely unnecessary
it's called magia record now <:GudaShrug:641769332401242112>
of course it continued
i'm one of those rare creatures who was more than fine with the rebellion ending and left the movie quite satisfied
it'll come out with the panty and stocking sequel
how fitting

clearly you haven't seen the best live action
Anitubers only really serve to further the circlejerks
Fuck elitists and fuck anitubers
You're expected to hate sao if youre an anime fan
Sao gets dunked on to the point that it's a meme in and of itself
Didnt even bother with alicization
Nah i aint no sao stan
Sao good mha bad
Never listen to fate elitists
And I even like demon slayer
Thats all those videos end up being
Whats the point of confirmation bias like seriously
Hence the rampant sao hate
The problem is that it creates a circlejerk
Demon slayer is just an example btw
And because anitubers say it then it becomes ingrained it's true because they said so
A popular opinion forms which then anitubers adopt because it's expected of them to do so because they're anitubers who're suppozed to follow the popular opinion
It's a recursive thing
Even though gigguk just jumped on a bandwagon for views
So now all the reddit people are like "gigguk said my anime is good therefore my anime is objectively good and you haters can get fucked"
In comes fucking Gigguk and makes a video. "DEMON SLAYER WORK OF ART ERMAGER!!!"
And other exaggerated praise
Reddit popular opinion is that demon slayer is an amazing piece of art that is amazing and masterpiece
To give an example, lets take demon slayer
Cos all they do is echo the popular opinion and make people believe that they're now objectively correct cos an anituber said so
but it's something
34 days wew
saw it yeah
basically making it better in every way
yeah progressive is a remake of the OG sao
hoh
if anything the animation was very pretty

therefore both are shit
okay but neither is mars
I agree
the best anime are the ones you like
fandoms are crap and anime websites are crap
a slightly less steaming pile of shit is still a steaming pile of shit
everyone has shit taste, no exceptions
is that everything people say is bullshit
if there's anything I learned in the years i've watched anime
might as well use wikipedia
nothing much you can do
it's the fault of the adaptation
it's kinda like how anime only watchers dont like shirou but VN readers do
it was cute... for a little bit
i read the manga for it a bit
What the fuck

<@!161155855524298752> ever seen kannazuki no miko?
I mean they ||keep on reincarnating and finding each other again so it's not so bad||
rip
one chapter so far
oh
just need to find it
oh yeah I forgot about this
the ending itself is different too
hell
the general direction of the plot is similar but a *lot* of the details were changed
there're some blatant differences
yeah
kannazuki no miko?
honestly I thought the same thing in retrospect
understandable
regardless of what they would actually think about it if it was in its own bubble
a lot of times it feels like anitubers jump on the bandwagon of hype for a certain show to get views
to summarize
same thing the inverse with sao or other hated shows
which then only further fuels that popular opinion because it was "validated" by a popular anituber
it's only *after* a show like demon slayer or vinland saga become popular that he goes around telling you how amazing they are
see case gigguk
a trend I've also noticed is that anitubers tend to echo the popular opinion a lot
like they're some objective source of truth about it
i find that people give too much weight to what anitubers say
but as for what he actually says? pfft
in that way he's pretty good at what he does
I mean digibro only says things to rile people up
lmao
people caring about the opinion of anitubers <:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
same
but trying to tailor recommendations to their interests
not by tossing stuff like popularity and memes at them
that's how you really recommend shows I find
none of them cos hype is subjective
With no real intention of seeing Brotherhood because it's not interesting enough
Same
personally not fond of that mindset Fenny
maybe I just didn't try hard enough but I don't see a point
mostly cos I didn't find it
I don't think I've ever interacted with the fandom
same
Do I assume HNK is hokuto no ken?
luckily, those are easier to squash and kick out
yet there was still toxicity shining through with some people
I'm on the one discord server it has and it has less than 60 people
like, the smallest fandom I'm personally in is ah my goddess
in terms of anime, battle shonens tend to be the worst case scenario
the bigger the fandom, the easier it is to find the toxic ones since it's bigger in number
it depends
personally, I feel that experiencing something with a small group of friends trumps doing it with a giant group
even the ones that seem nice
it's more or less a universal rule at this point
every fanbase is bad
to be fair though
the show in question didn't even do anything wrong
and as the derision from the fanbase continues, going against their opinion almost feels spiteful
it's because of that that I go out of my way to be as humble about the stuff I like as possible
So in summation, I can 100% understand why someone would be put off because of a fanbase
you're LITERALLY disagreeing with OBJECTIVE FACT*
so now it's an objective fact
now the famous youtuber said it
"DEMON SLAYER AMAZING BEST THING EVER OMG"
in come the anitubers, seeing easy views
people singled it out as an amazing best thing ever omg
to take an example, demon slayer
anitubers in general parrot the general opinion a fuckton
people have done that yes
you must follow the herd
yep
and you don't
because I like this one show
and because I'm smart I'm better than you
but I get it because I'm smart
you don't get it because you're dumb
> Apparently you must say that particular anime is perfect otherwise you'll be called by everyone as less of a human being
<@!457268466429329429> nah you see, you just don't "get" it!
you're not allowed to call them garbage lest you bring down the wrath of everyone around you upon you
meanwhile, the precious battle shonens like MHA and Jojo are a no-no when it comes to criticism
and 2. it's an acceptable target now so it's fine to shit on it at every turn
because 1. it's definitely not the worst anime out there
and i'm not even a fan of it
I'm honestly sick of hearing how awful SAO is
haters do the same thing btw
then I don't want to listen
but when the only things they say are the popular opinion and toss the usual drivel you've heard a thousand times already
I mean, I don't mind listening either
as if by liking those shows, they're smarter/better/more mature than you
people really go out of their way to flex their favorite shows at others
if there's one thing I don't like, it's when people try to force me to think like them about certain things
regardless if you had any intention of doing so in the first place
people latch onto this one show and now it's expected of everyone to watch and like it
it's why I hate the seasonal hype
I'd much more appreciate a heartfelt recommendation from a friend who found something they know I'd like rather than one that goes on about an arbitrary score on some websites and LE MAYMAYS
I'll pick up the Bleach Final Arc when it comes out but other than that I don't think I'll touch anything of the sort again
i've basically stopped watching battle shonens period
i don't like kid protagonists all that much so that put me off too
i watched 1 ep of bnha, found something else, and never got back to it
star driver is fantastic
Sorry if I seem so pushy about all this but I've faced a lot of the things I said from fandom, especially Jojo's
people are allowed to dislike it
their opinions are valid and will always be just as valid
they're allowed to not like it and they're valid
and if people don't like it, more power to them
it's a thing that exists that was well made
but I don't think it's amazing
And hell, I even liked Demon Slayer!
he didn't sex her so we don't know that
b-but they're not?
yeah Niko except ||He's fucking dead||
so like Bebop where it's mostly a space cowboy or panty and stocking and whatnot
I think the shows where dub works best are ones where the japanese element isn't as important
code geass too
panty and stocking has a great dub
>heroes
>lala satalin
wait what
this is one hell of an utterly useless video lol

dumb memes we're too normal too understand
it's a bunch of dumb memes I suppose
i feel my IQ dropping just seeing these numbers
this is dumb
<:MariaWhat:672245553920344080>
legendary meme


let's bang
we're being chased by big bad man
because fuck you
why?
shirou and seibah stab basaka with fake twig and kill him 127391723912 times
it has the biggest density of bullshit
meh
but like
like yeah, it's the intro to fate and shit
Fate route is snooze
tbh is it really that necessary
they farted out a caster version so they can fart anything
they'll make one
and that's how we have 50 of the same character in different costumes
https://tenor.com/view/dj-khaled-another-one-one-more-time-gif-4816107
and then takeuchi came and said
and then the rest is history
tweeleelee twirl! your king arthur is now a girl!
so he switcharoo'd
but then Nasu realized he needed some bang bucks
it never started
Infinity was infinitely more interesting in T than in the movie lol
> I am a longtime fan of mazinger and saw it in theaters and I was still bored out of my mind for half the movie
<@99695384296701952> another sad thing SRW fixed in every regard
How do you explain humanity having advanced space capabilities
God Muvluv really does put a damper on things
But you discover the previously MIA team of ultra super robots got involved and roflstomped them
The BETA taking over the world is too major a plot point to neuter it
The only way I see it working is the parallel world plot
It's what makes it so endearing
Bullshit excuses are SRW's speciality
Something something getter rays
Votoms is jii-ing at you
Maybe when the muvluv alternative anime comes out <:GudaShrug:641769332401242112>
But I dont want Macross <a:KirikaUpset:688429724221046872>
But I didnt get my muvluv in a main game yet <:notlikerin:585552123413004309>
So I suppose this elusive 30th year anniversary, if true, could easily be the last
<:BikkiSad:497709420122341386>
Banpresto are gone?!?
You just dropped something very important really casually
Wait what
Steel ourselves for no Gear and we will probably see Franxx
But hey, at least a new one should be coming
Oh right those
Letters blend in
There was a J right?
J?
SKL when
Higurashi did sus before sus was cool
<:Sakurawithgun:702138013668343899> dont sully it with such boorish memery
What dark lord do I have to pay to get zero adapted
Koji being an indecisive wimp with Sayaka
I mean, 2004 anime
Theyve found ways
And since it's SRW they can find ways to go around the problametic part
Theyre cool
I just want the mecha from it
Now give me kannazuki no miko <a:KirikaUpset:688429724221046872>
Wrote himself into a corner
Mothers Rosario was one of the better parts
They couldve explored some real interesting topics but chose to stick to Kirito
SAO is a wasted premise that I have to agree on
It was popular when it came out and had an annoying fanbase so people decided to shit on it
> I still do not understand why SAO consider to be the worst anime.
<@740195087895756820> memes, basically
the mangaka is a big fan of fate iirc
tonikaku is filled to the brim with references lol
symphogear but fujitaka and genjuro decide to stop messing around so they dig up mazinger and getter and beat the bad guys with them
will need to check again
cant remember
and I think IS made it to the mobage?
symphogear has a higher chance of making it in than Yuyuyu
> I want Yuuki Yuuna in SRW
<@!285413253834866689> probably wont happen
winx club getting a crossover with known magical girl anime
i dunno
it's like...
still, it's a western movie
basically what it is lol
which is probably a great honor
> Its literally all mechas and implied all anime rebelling against ZERO himself
<@!285413253834866689> all mecha anime/manga supposedly made since mazinger + pacific rim
voltes is by tomino
i dont think so cypher
and it has the greatest ending in the history of endings
Kouji's badassery is godlike there
it has the best versions of all characters like how could I not want it
i want now
> How about Shin Mazinger ZERO anime?
<@!285413253834866689> give me now
Go Nagai looks really good for a man in his 70s
https://twitter.com/RealGDT/status/874630995756158976
and the creator of said thing acknowledges it and decides to add it into his verse
Imagine making something inspired by something you loved as a child
I see you raided fuwanovel lol
there're more yuri bait shows than actual yuri shows
there's yuri bait and actual yuri
depends on your definition
do you need the necessarily legal way?
but that's really it tbh
it was fun for what it was
really the epitome of okay
like
mazinger angels... was okay

truly a dad of culture
wow
highly recommended that you do don't not don't do do not do watch it
he loves the anime so much he can't even type right now
see? cypher agrees

He's the shaftman

Technically it is

OMEGA TILT
Making sure it's as accurate as possible
Cos they're also comparing it directly to the jp version
Theyre actually being very meticulous about it
But then comes editing

interesting
i thought it was an anime
oh it's a movie?!?!
yeah but those are closer to mecha than yuki yuuna
cos that has mecha
even if rayearth was in it
straight up magical girl in SRW would be a stretch
great setting and premise too
it's not very long but it makes up for that with a lot of great details
it's a very meticulously crafted show
it's pretty damn good
I feel like this is wholly unnecessary
all of this just to send a text?
and he doesn't feel a step closer to breaking out of this loop
I felt like nothing happened
i didn't like s2
i've legit purged everything I learned of math after high school
But I feel Gaim isn't at all representative of what he can really do
It doesn't justify the flaws of course
You could tell he wanted to do more with it but couldn't
you could feel it
I personally liked Gaim a lot, but the formula was *really* limiting
yeah but Gurren Lagann's writing fits the Kamen Rider mold a lot better
I think the Kamen Rider mold doesn't fit his style
I have to agree
in a nutshell, Kouta is the Nobunaga while Micchi is the Mitsuhide
do remember that the show also has allusions to the sengoku period of japan
Micchi's character direction was really predictable

Gimme!!!
Holy shit thats so cool!!!!
people are gonna go into psycho mode

may or may not be fgo based and may or may not be carnival phantasm

let's see if the anime will make me somehow like this arc
wrong channel
~~it's okay being wrong is also accepted üôÉ ~~
88' actually but close enough
^XV spoilers
||Noriko is voiced by the same person who voiced true form Shemha||
just so all you nerds know
The dreams of my people came to life in SRW T
~~it gets worse~~
don't worry, it won't be for long
the first episode of elfen lied has more grotesque violence in it than most of higurashi
in terms of the pure violence
elfen lied is more brutal than higurashi
they just didn't register because of their context
basically firezero, you've definitely watched stuff like higurashi before
jojo part 1
i mean you watched a dog get burned alive so you should be fine
it was marketed as a remake, but spoiler not spoiler, it's actually a sequel
yeah recommended you watch the first anime before checking this new one out
yesterday
healin good failed to improve unfortunately
higurashi gou is finally getting real juicy
most of the problems stem from seed destiny
https://tenor.com/view/walking-nautilus-wide-gif-17844364
i shudder to think what happens when you don't like a certain show
At least one can't go wrong with recommending you stuff
The Great Propane War arc was fantastic
King of the hill is by far the best shonen ever made
"So lexi what do you like?"
"Yes"
also lexi you madlass you like too many things lmao
supernatural is my favorite anime too <:HibikiSmug:672655850518609940>
it's really bizarre too
this anime is really fucking good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-anabfAg06U
cypher
so you admit you're a greek witch?
yeah the character
and jean is an idiot for constantly coddling her
nadia fucking sucks and everyone knows it
Ange is too alpha for him
what is it with series and dropping quality after season 5
very honest
it's a comfy show
<@!782841825069236236> honestly the one that I'd ask you to check out from these (if you hadnt already seen it) is oh my goddess
for 15 years of anime watching it ain't that much tbh
my list lel
https://anilist.co/user/solopy567/animelist
talk about nostalgia
wow
did I just see MONK?!?
wait wtf
now I wanna toss my list at you and hope to land all my faves
ah you also reject the ending? <:HibikiSmug:672655850518609940>
it was never coming
i mean tbf half life 3 has more or less been confirmed to be dead
it's about fucking time
cocoa lmao
~~hibiki's dad lusting over tsubasa~~
I think it was just pure canon
why headcanon
i think you'll like higurashi better
from this season im only watching aot and higurashi

no i mean
do we know which show?

like, it ends up still being really convoluted but in a way it has some logic to it
I love how in SRW they try their hardest to make a plot that makes sense
Char and his fetish for colony drops
oh yeah? bet you never heard of Nobunaga the Fool!
Gundam is in a weird spot because it actually skirts the line between real and super quite a lot
legendary ending
it's about goddamn time!
does the wallpaper come with the music <:GenjuroLaugh:689563633516150872>
okay, the rest of the entries are much more extensive
interesting
oh there're more entries
maybe there's more to this blog I'm not seeing but from this page alone, I'm not all that convinced
some of the evidence they provide isn't all that convincing and feels coincidental more than anything
hmmm, I can see what they're going for here, but I feel their argument is a little weak
it is? didn't get that vibe at all
jeez they could've at least been subtle about it
I personally am quite fond of Gate but the nationalism is pretty obvious yeah
understandable
it's coming out
yep
redo of healer is gonna bring so much controversy it will make goblin slayer look like teletubies
welcome to infinite shittos
mollusks
I also really don't like the final arc
it's fun but that's where it stops really
another +1 for the ever elongating anime list
It's still just another show though
I mean I like AoT too to the point I read the manga, watched all the seasons, and played the ps4 games
and everyone knows youtubers are the real anime fans!
Look! This youtuber said it's good!
Clearly this is the only right source!
This one has a 10 on it!
Look at all these random numbers on these random sites on the internet!
Problems?! In my clearly objective masterpiece of a piece of entertainment?!?!
surely not!
What? are you telling me fans of ultra popular things will outright ignore the problems it has and hype them up to such an unhealthy degree it will never live up to the expectations they built for it?!
the most unrealistic thing is that the coin doesn't disintegrate from the inertia and heat
the quebeley is honestly kind of an ugly mobile suit
the perspective on that dime is mind blowing lol
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZvQpwvlz-o
and at times it feels like things are included for no reason other than to be confusing
that's fine and all but that doesn't negate the fact that ikuhara likes to go way too far
and can be really up his ass with the themes and imagery
ikuhara for all of his talent tends to overindulge in his symbolism
I say that's the best result
an ikuhara work without ikuhara in it!
that at some point, you just lose what they're supposed to represent
is that they're too numerous
it's not that they're not deep or hard to understand
pretty much
it's not a battle shonen lol
what is even happening
is this an experimental project?
?!?!?!
FMA was pretty zzzzzz personally
Elitism is rampant and people genuinely lose their cool over which japanese cartoon is better
Anime fans are ass what can I say
Recency bias is super strong too
People have an incurable new toy syndrome and no patience
That's why I say disregard MAL entirely
Yeah exactly
The rankings tend to be rigged
They work by popularity
You forget MAL dont work by actual quality
Theyre *always* wrong
japan tends to well... fetishize the concepts
yuri is usually made for men and yaoi is made for women
yuri and yaoi are a little bit weird because they're not made with the expected target audience in mind
I mean
You can watch tens of shows in that period
Nearly 1000 episodes by now
One Piece is too long for its own good
You can watch multiple great shows in the time it takes one battle shounens to get itself started
Theyre just not worth the time anymore
Ive personally stopped with battle shounens entirely
never humor the elitists
and that's how you know to ignore his opiniion
90% of the time it's the latter
do they dislike it because they genuinely found faults or are they just parroting each other
it's genuinely fascinating not from just the biological perspective, but also from a storytelling one
really damn good adaptation
fantastic
fucking
bloody
cells at work black is
I love it
so fucking good
is just
wonder egg
but who cares
>Amazon Prime
holy shit I didn't realize it was Yoko Takahashi herself lol
Who will win?!?
Wild west vs ancient china vs victorian england
<@!87512939107450880> HAH
you know exactly what's going to be said
it's like seeing a review on SAO
why? because it's what everyone has already said about it
Without watching the video I can already tell what he's going to say
lol anitubers
but it went too deep on the edge
like the premise was cool and all
it was mediocre honestly
meh
I bet it was Kellogs
so which company made this episode this time?
tomoyo after anime!
they're not gone
kyoani are getting back on their feet slowly but surely
it might!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSomXj_CZOM
go watch this
yes you
<@!782841825069236236> you
Yeah this is definitely far fetched as hell
CGI aside
except animation wise it looks better
the Symphogear people
aka
satelight
shockingly enough
it's
cos it's not gainax üôÉ
Like if you ask Yoko Hikasa if she remembers it, will she even say yes?
I don't know if anyone in Japan even remembers this anime
Nadia is more high key though
that's true
lmao
but yeah while I think it has the chance to appear in SRW, I don't know what exactly are their criteria for *popularity*
his name is on the box after all
that's a given
I fucking bloody wish
jam project? check
minori chihara? check
all star cast? check
mecha? check
sexy european ladies? check
glorious nippon steel? check
historical people? check
it has everything you ever need
she even has the one stocking
you have Maria as Jeanne d'arc
goblin slayer season 2 announced
https://twitter.com/GA_bunko/status/1355828083660529665
cos best girl already won
barely harem
that never actually grow or change after their "arcs"
so every single character is one-dimensional
they just take archetypes and heavily exaggerate them
the girls are too
the problem with most harems is not only is the MC really awfully written
but pot of greed is still banned because of reasons <:GudaShrug:641769332401242112>
and that'll make them buy more packs
because people will want the newest op cards
konami are only doubling down on everything they did wrong
the power creep is so gigantic and the game is so unbalanced, it's probably impossible to fix it
on the contrary, they made the problem *worse*
the rarest combination of words on this planet
>konami recognizing a mistake
https://tenor.com/view/bender-futurama-serious-laugh-mocking-gif-5538669
his bullshit MC powers are part of the lore
as in
wasn't it revealed that Atem's power literally lets him draw the card he wants all the time
but in terms of balance it's probably the worst of the big 3
it's fine to enjoy it
yeah
what I've seen of modern yugioh is that the game has become a test of who can puke their combo out the fastest and make the opponent not play the game
it worked really well
someone once made a script that beat the anti-adblock script kiss had
mangarock became sellouts
it was just convenient and had a large library
honestly kiss was awful from the start
way better than kiss
9anime honeslty has been pretty light on ads from what i've seen
hence why you put on the double condoms and use adblocks on every corner
Are you all okay? You've been spelling Wonder Egg wrong repeatedly
i tried using it and didn't like it
rejected
>says tensei looks the best while wonder egg exists in the same universe
no need to wait, I already have this take üôÉ
but it spawned really fucking good fanfics
in retrospect it was shit
zero no tsukaima goddamn
that 60fps <:SerenaDizzy:736605371912945736>
it's a so and so adaptation of the vn
Live action *philipine* voltes series
<@468591607332208641> <@99695384296701952> wat
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voltes_V_Legacy
what the fuck is happening
remember it's also an adaptation of a VN
they *all* matter for a specific reason
like sure, if you didn't like it then don't continue, but there is a definite answer to most of the events
a lot of the payoff comes in after story, which is what everything built up towards
I don't agree
I disagree with the general opinion on clannad and think that s1 was fantastic and funny for all the right reasons
and the expression on his face
the fact that he was asked to read this
this was both cringe and sad at the same time
oh god this
heard that excuse a million times already
yes
that's what everybody says about all gacha games
sure it is <:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>

at least it's not a gacha shit üôÉ
I am all for a DOOM anime
now THAT'S retro!
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_a_Realist_Hero_Rebuilt_the_Kingdom

Legit part of the story is how Saber's and Shirou's perceptions of him differ
He doesnt know though
it served the purpose of the narrative and themes
anime reasons, yeah
<@!186660127825330177> lain talk
oh the manga for this is pretty nice
fede that's too cultured
try jujutsu kaisen, demon slayer, fire force, hokuto no ken
simple stuff then
what anime did you like
define "hype"
she also voices villains in Claymore and Witchblade
and then you hear about aoi shouta
nana is a very versatile va
They need s2 and s3 at the very least
It's not amazing but it's alright
AOT is fine
Theyre either really fucky or permanent :|
Aot also has a problem with facial expressions
At least the manga is ending soon
I personally dont like this arc at all
The anime is better at making things clearer
damn
~~isn't that just attack on titan~~
nothing amazing, but I came in with no expectations and was pleasantly entertained
honestly the kantai collection anime and movie were more enjoyable than I expected

https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2021-03-07/date-a-live-iv-anime-debuts-in-october-with-new-studio-staff/.170339
fucking kashimashi lol
What
how they cry?
at least they have time to finish it lol
For one piece you need 70 years
What dont you like?
<@722121666641133608> in all seriousness, what kind of shows do you like?
wow
garfiel is the mvp
<:shiroutink:687742053601509399>

it felt like nothing was happening and that they were retreading the same points again and again for no reason
i was just seriously underwhelmed by these two cours
it took this long
finally a good episode of rezero in this season
Definitely not new
that's the order
Yuuki Yuuna Yuusha de Aru
Yuuki Yuuna Yuusha de Aru: Washio Sumi
Yuuki Yuuna Yuusha de Aru: Yuusha no Shou
in any case
factually incorrect to say they're movies
it's not movies
they're wrong
It goes like this:
it's just a short anime
nah it isn't movies
ah they separated the washio sumi episodes
easy peasy!
the night is young and you got over 900 episodes to go!
let's go!
Clearly that means you need to marathon all of one piece tonight!
all good
if you want of course
cos in those short runners they need a little bit more
i think you should try maybe two more episodes
the upside is that yuki yuuna is more openly yuri than even Gear
the washio sumi episodes are even on youtube for easy access
~~he knows the sex good~~
Chadman 9000
Rance
Just their appearance makes people pick up the pitchforks
You're daring to show the evil Keyaru and Naofumi
Cypher you maniac you're gonna get crucified
did the anime adaptation destroy him?
OOF
the gifs are fucking amazing
i can't get over how even ANN can't take ex arm seriously
https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/ex-arm/episode-10/.170597
~~replace yugioh with any other anime and itll still be very sad~~
I don't completely agree with Nox's takes, but I can see why it's perceived this way
but the execution was piss poor
the premise is cool as hell and I loved that
without any substance behind it
but just ended up being an edgefest of epic proportions
it tried really hard to be more
honestly, I can only call it edgy
Ops Asuka is...
~~because crusaders were always bad people~~
those little rascals
is this the year of sci fi?
they used to make fun of uhhhh Ishihara, the governor of Tokyo at the time
I used to frequent them back in the day
god I remember them
it has basically everything it needs to be in it
I already want to see Back Arrow is SRW
it was a pointless anime
it was also an awful... "adaptation", if you can even call it that
he likes all the culture
ikxi's dad is too based
who pays for manga
let's watch how he fucks it up <:harold:595434251286085653>
one chapter left for the manga finally
JUSTICE FOR ONODERA!!!
like how space doesn't make sense in their works
I suppose their inconsistency is part of the charm?
<:Teedus:632320401397252107>
and I think the final episode aired on the same day as the actual Walpurgisnacht
and how the last 2 or so episodes were delayed cos fo the earthquake
but I remember being around the time it was airing and it was scary how it exploded
like it's still popular now
thinking back, goddamn Madoka sent *waves*
but people found out quickly and so they tried to do damage control
I remember how shaft tried to hide the fact urobuchi was on board
the difference between having creative freedom and being held down by a kid friendly direction
the sheer bizarreness of the visuals of the witches makes it unique
it's probably the most memorable part of madoka
that's the point yeah
the labyrinths and the witches were designed by an artist called gekidan inu curry
it's very much an artistic direction
acid trip dimensions yeah
what has you confused?
iS iT gOnNa bE tHe nExT bIg 3?!?
you can write a research paper on this just to figure it out
*how*
like
it exploded so massively it's become a household name within a year
like it didn't just get popular
demon slayer's success is scary
hoping for the best, preparing for the worst
in the muvluv discord one of the anchor people said it's look damn good so I dunno
we know legit nothing about it
it's hard to say ü§î
All the AOT fans will be coming <:YumiPanic:688429717174354012>
when Muvluv Alternative anime drops
oh god Millhi
Muvluv did it better <:sumika:230385746828066826>
started off as a sorta-apocalypse scenario
iSaYaMa iS a gEnIuS!
was filler <:GarieOhYeah:688429715769262187>
what aot needed
maybe
i never liked this arc and the anime really didn't change my mind
it's just not interesting <:GudaShrug:641769332401242112>
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Gteny7PbqA
it had some moments
it's kodomo <:kek:814617739167137863>
yugioh isn't shounen
~~cos the usual shounens are crap~~
symphogear isn't really shounen but <:GudaShrug:641769332401242112>
battle shounens are a tired genre
what is this 2004
Naruto (actually Boruto), Bleach, and One Piece all at the same time again after so long
isn't this totally crazy lol
and that legendarily awful ending?
remember how people exploded at oreimo? <:kek:814617739167137863>
millhi
yoko hikasa sure was in a lot of trash harems <:kek:814617739167137863>
<#803824240494903338>
you can even see which characters they voiced to remember
wow that stats list is ridiculously good

by konami?! <:YumiPanic:688429717174354012>
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55iX64NmUDA
all the political mumbo jumbo is sleep worthy
there was never an apocalypse and the titans are barely even relevant
but now neither of those are even factors
The apocalypse feeling and the fear of the titans was great in the first seasons
I also think that with the last arc, AoT lost a lot of what made it interesting in the first place
there aren't an awful lot of memorable characters
or lack thereof
not to mention the facial expressions
the character writing for AoT is also pretty weak
like
yeah but the problem comes when they think the writing for their animation trumps all literary creations in the history of mankind
romance of the three kingdoms basically had powerlevels <:Teedus:632320401397252107>
which is inherently false
anime fans tend to overly idolize japanese writing
also, in general, let's be real about something
aren't they fun
hyperbolies!
dragon ball z is a repetitive hack but you'll be hard pressed to find a shonen with a bigger worldwide influence
remember that quality and popularity have no correlation
depends
my screaming mans punching other screaming mans are better than your screaming mans punching other screaming mans
it baffled me all the time with the acronyms
holy fuck I didn't think I'd find anyone else who'd confuse it with that
Kuroneko üôÉ
i should play the oreimo VN <:Ver:704169051391524875>
Kuroneko was done dirty
this is too good
I mean, 3 movies won't ever capture a 30 hour route
already watched the cam rip i see <:15min:406862587657977866>
but they 100% require the context
I think they do the job well
i dont agree
it depends on the VN
so you're met with an unsolvable problem
but it's also unavoidable because they can't include them
the vast majority of VN adaptations drop the inner thoughts, which are critical for the understanding of the main character
this is the problem with adapting vns
for completion's sake I'd say
it's almost unavoidable
yeah
can't even blame that thought
without a look into his thoughts, he obviously comes off as shallow and stupid
but yeah, anime Shirou and VN Shirou are, well, kinda different characters in a way
that too
I feel like UBW was more made for Fate fans in mind than newcomers
which is absent in the anime
the problem with Shirou is that because his character is dependent on his own inner monologuing
Ill give the smartass answer and say none of them and all of them
Yeah madoka is bizarre and pretty creepy at times but it's not that terrifying
I feel you're overstating it lol
mostly no
yes and no
eh
didn't we have this conversation yesterday
<:Teedus:632320401397252107>
>anime community
kizuna ai is still relevant?
<:HibikiSmug:672655850518609940>
Animepahe
9anime
No matter how many people try to say it does
Objectivity and all that doesnt exist in entertainment
Cos no point in giving that much weight to people's opinions
I want to give a sarcastic answer but I wont
What is this list?
<@297542051057238017> rush him!
*All* the Precure?!?
Kenjiro tsuda is a big deal after all
What about it stands out so much?
piracy is the only way to watch anime üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è
and the director did the infamous hand shakers iirc
no different from the video game industry
WEP is a great anime and all but holy shit it is not worth this nightmare
not sure what egg is going for anymore
Jesus Crepes

hf 3
oh
what
jouran princess of snow and blood
checked out two new anime that came out
so!
~~and it's not even an april fool's joke~~
right?
it can't be more boring than that
the game was so boring
thank god
quite a few nice things coming out this season that look good
steampunk japan ye
both with supernatural creatures
i know right
~~who cares about space fairy tail~~
honestly, both look pretty damn good!
and mars red
||oh that was Ayahi?!?! Didnt recognize her!||
the french and their penchants for revolutions
It looks fantastic!
Wow

birdy the mighty decode
kamen no maid guy
it's only trailers for now and I think it's unfair to judge all of it purely on that
fair enough, but I think you should let the show speak for itself
it's gorgeous and fascinating
new anime airing this season
Vivy: Fluorite Eye's Song
this is gonna shape up to be an absolute treat
absolutely fantastic
just wow
wow
just watched the two episodes of Vivy
what anime?
lmao
<:MikuPraise:585839808765493249>
stella plz lol
Bobobobobobobobo
dead leaves
ergo proxy
serial experiments lain
that is the hot fox girl
ye
that's twintails
twintails is symphogear if it was a comedy
run before they give you something stupid like attack on titan or naruto
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158> im the only one giving real recommendations here!
mahou shoujo ore

don't they also eat people or something
Loris is a prude?!?
i never finished yuri kuma after having to wipe my brain off the floor
we just said it's symphogear but comedy
thick, juicy symbolism

<:JustFine:256624508025307137>
time to leave the internet for another year
it's an entirely selfish pursuit
everybody has their own goals for it
that's how the grail war is?
I mean
so it doesn't feel as shallow
Shinji and Zouken are both unforgivable bastards, but at least you gain an insight into their backstory that explains why they're bastards
it's entirely original
||That it was built on top of the pillar where illya's ancestor was squished||
i really liked how ||they gave the grail cavern a legit design and let us understand what exactly is inside the grail itself||
with insane fight scenes
so it may not be the best adaptation, but they at least made it damn enjoyable
I think they did the best they could with what they had
||Like a lot of the route's original exposition is really just exposition for its own sake||
||I think that wasn't something they really had to give background on||
battle shonens are zzzzzzzzzzzzz
Urobuchi's writing tends to do that
I don't entirely agree but I can see why it can seem as such
what do you mean by felt like an animal
idiot protagonist, long run time, filler arcs, power levels, power ups, large cast of characters, many of which are fairly lacking, all over the place pacing
not to mention they don't stay up for hundreds of episodes at a time
newer shows tend to leave the sort of cliches those older shonens followed
those kind of shows don't really happen these days
and those too yeah
for example, take the big 3
there's hardly any new ones that follow the old trends
battle shonens as we remember them don't really happen anymore?
power of friendship hasn't really been a factor for a while
but yeah, i'd say Symphogear counts as shonen only through the osmosis and following trends within the industry
i could be wrong though
I think it was Sailor Moon that kinda brought the "sentai" aspect to magical girls
magical girls as we know them more or less started from Cutie Honey
also it's kinda funny cos technically the magical girl genre as we know it is older than the shounen "genre"
yeah but random sites aren't really an indicator
and that's mostly because the magical girl genre in general did lift some things from those sort of shonens
because it can feel like one but it isn't
Symphogear is in a weird place
>youtubers having takes that are ever good and not just parroting the popular opinion for views
youtubers are a massive problem imo
in the west it's like tiny
a cultural icon and a household name
precure for instance is *massive* in japan
and vice versa
some things are way bigger here than there
also important to remember the success in the west and the east
honestly hype kills more than it helps
disagree on JJK but we'll agree to disagree
it *exploded*
like it wasn't even gradual
demon slayer's success was scary to behold
they couldn't save god eater
üôÉ
as did like 99% of all anime characters
Also Flamie is Aoi Yuuki
Ye
read the LNs and find out <:yumipoint:721897096101494816>
either you love what it's going for or it's total unwatchable nonsense
gatari is a mixed bag as it is
basically, stop buying blurays of crap you don't watch and just torrent anime
i really wanted my ||KOTOMINEEEEEEEEEEEEEE KIREEEEEEEEEEEEEEIIIIIIIIII||
she went god mode
https://typemoon.fandom.com/wiki/Kanshou_and_Bakuya
yeah man
that's crane wing
that's not nine lives though
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DO2tZPimkD0
at least we got him in some way
oh and the manga is gonna have another part apparently
what happened to it
that reminds me HF also got a manga
haven't touched the dub at all
i watched sub and it was great
chaika is cute
it's fun
tell us!
what are you hiding?
where's the catch
there's no way an anime will have all of those qualities and not have a catch
you must be lying then
different standards
And Nashetalia is Yoko Hikasa
Yep
they could've added ||shirou taking a step forward|| at least
but it was a little... meek?
ufotable's punchy and powerful animation would've elevated it further
While I still liked it in the end and how they went about it, I feel that ||Nine lives blade works|| could've been much more epic
honestly, it kinda felt like they mixed them a little bit?
<:Teedus:632320401397252107>
and sakura also babbling fake german lol
lol
I thought the way they used it and the imagery that accompanied it was very strong
disagree
*wife
||And shirou telling avenger to basically fuck off||
the manga was better <:smugredman:585673300441563168>
give us that realta nua cg
an awful adaptation
the anime is terrible
especially the latter half
it's really good
not bad at all
so it should be fully released at this point
when I lived in germany I spied the store having a volume here and there of it
it's so much better it's not even fair
for that you must turn him to the manga
oh man
im pretty sure there are ones with german dub
you can always hook him up with some pirate site
it wasn't the best and it was bombarded with porn and virus ads, but the sheer amount of content it had was impressive
a *lot*
like
a lot of people
cos it was a depository of anime that's basically abandonware
that's why some people were mad at kissanime going down
Who shall emerge victorious between Crunchyroll, Funimation, and Netflix?
Romance of the Three Anisites Kingdoms
maybe if the services weren't pretty much kingdoms of their own with divided content it'd be worth it
but yeah, the high seas is the only way
it's okay they're basically the same thing
yes
you have it listed as Beyond the Heavens
cypher go watch Souten Kuro
we're filthy pirates though
~~just stop using mal and go for anilist or something~~
I personally point to fate/zero
cos they're all fairly different
what do you feel like?
you gotta narrow it down
but literally every second anime ever released is a shonen
does that count?
what battle shonens are there even to watch
lots of good shows this season
how didn't you have a seizure from all the movement and the lights
lol cypher
I can already see the stages
Back Arrow already has all it needs to be in SRW
batman, what're you doing here
like I recall seeing him for the first time and I was like whaaaaaaa
the protagonist of big O legitimately looks like bruce wayne
Shirou Emiya syndrome
Absolute dumbass and unexplainable in the adaptations
But do they bang
~~there are plot holes but by tbe time you get to the last volumes both you and the author forgot what they were~~
accelerator is already op as hell
op to the point the entire story has to be changed to accommodate that power
maybe that's the plot hole <:Teedus:632320401397252107>
i bet he can't beat ultra instinct shaggy
but can he beat goku
but can he beat madara uchiha?
any more powers and he'll be unbeatable
Mazinkaiser SKL?
did I see

The weight behind the job isnt the same
Noteworthy english vas
5
Theres like
so you might want a version that subbed those
like above symphogear style relevant
although I heard the songs are also super relevant
it kinda does from my experience
you don't sound ready
are you ready?!
raiden are you ready for this?
Who has the rights to gunbuster/diebuster and gurren lagann
As an aside
Rip gainax
So do we get the sequel or no lol
So is macross finally free?
wait till you hear her as ibuki douji
has a strange but fascinating premise
shadows house is definitely an interesting show
In how many of those anime she *didnt* voice a character?
Of all the anime openings Nana sang
Random question
nothing new
I mean we know zoomers have trash taste <:KanadeSmug:688191203178840064>
pffft
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/589841630555668503/830520805896486972/unknown.png
gunbuster at 166 is a crime
though we gotta remember they only watched what was available
ye it's all 2005 and back
27!
they had the tsukihime anime at 27
https://web.archive.org/web/20050205163039/http://www.animenfo.com/statistic/top.php?type=anime
and that's from like, 80s-90s people
it's okay I mean have you seen the top anime list of like 2005? holy hell their taste was horrific
wait a fucking second
they wanna show em off and all
although that's usual for SRW and new entries
even though it bent for it
and SRW X basically fixed everything wrong with it
buddy complex was such a strange show
remember fucking bloody Buddy Complex and that sack of sad potatoes?
that is why you had Super Robot Wars to save them as usual <:HibikiDab:688190074395164696>
*look at this guy*
https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/interest/2021-04-15/yoshiyuki-tomino-aims-high-my-next-work-will-crush-demon-slayer-and-evangelion/.171720
you can't match that
like sorry
but is it as good as ex arm
from the maker of Kannazuki no Miko
steel angel kurumi I see
what even is this series about lol
one piece is too long to be worth going through all of it <:Teedus:632320401397252107>
~~so one piece but in space?~~
it's a fun little thing
shaman king is for pure nostalgia tbh
legit all of the characters look exactly like fairy tail and rave master characters
no seriously like
hiro mashima has sameface syndrome lol
is her hair *floating on the side of her head*
I'm sorry but

nice fairy tail opening

<:Teedus:632320401397252107> if he did, he did a good job lol
they'll find a way to fuck up
never trust battle shonen writers
<:Ver:704169051391524875>

but you know what he's never correct about?
<:kek:814617739167137863>
good nobu
nope
that
and ridiculously obviously evil nobu
although wakamoto

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbhZHSLK9ik
there's also this
good shit
nobuna
hoh
Reading comprehension!
God damn it people
It says it right there
He nukes
86 is nothing short of amazing
what is even happening in back arrow anymore
NaLu confirmed?
maybe that's the whole point
HUEHUEHUEHUEHUEHUEHUEHUEHUE
thinking on it, isn't that kind of super messed up? like, ||since magical girls become witches, that means Walpurgis is basically a some sort of eldritch fusion of corrupted magical girls' souls||
go watch season 2 and Zero
because it's amazing^2
did I already say Vivy is amazing?
lol
this is my religion
something something the switch between hand drawn and digital
Demon magic lol
So it's like
Also it's the kanji for demon iirc
funny you should say that cos stuff happened in the manga

Do it you coward
Do it
what's up?
I did
people write Shiki fanfics?
including ||shirely still being alive||
where several things have changed
the resurrection movie is more a sequel to the compilation movies than the tv series
well, here's the thing
Honkai üôÉ
yeah
well there is the remake
was legit about to say that lol
Cos at this point toss anything at thrm
Itd be easier if they had a specific taste we can know
For star wars, star blazers/legend of the galactic heroes
Well little witch academia fits for harry potter
Hmmmm
Pffftt
What movies and or shows did they watch that they liked
Says so in the link in the description lel
Little witch academia
help this guy
<@!152896851660505088>
more attempts at idols?
His work will always be remembered as a cornerstone that birthed many other works after it
May he rest in peace
I suppose now is a good time as any to reread this greatness
more like Mr. Weeaboo
Vocaloid is still relevant?
so...
it's par for the course
a lot of anime is gonna have sexual moments, whether for drama or for comedy
~~even if there was that's like the least of the problems~~
I don't recall that
there was boob missiles?
https://tenor.com/view/joueur-du-grenier-no-fun-fun-fun-is-not-allowed-stop-it-gif-16558170
sure they are
sure they are amiya
that's HxEros üôÉ
of course it does
it does what it's supposed to
ok
the entire premise is that the mc has a fetish for twintails
Fucking hell mates Lupin truly never dies
oh shit the movie is out?
that's a cool car
yeah she has some pretty impressive range
Sugita will always be Kyon to me
some are better for it than others
that's cos Kirito's va is like Generic Anime Protagonist‚Ñ¢Ô∏è
good memories from him as Ichigo and Lelouch
I like Yong Bosch
that's him lol
but doesn't it feel like Jp also use the same like 5 all the time
you know, they say english dubs use like the same 5 VAs...
Eren
he's ridiculously easy to spot lol
her newest role as Yo in Shaman King is pretty good
it's just an example of her range
you dont need to do Fate
I think she's too prolific right now though
she does have surprising roles
uchi?
<:ROsad:665360371812401162>
fujiawa keiji?
who's fujikei again?
oh Nana is also super recognizable
first time I heard that was in valkyrie drive lol
although she can pull off the deep voice
fucking index lol
partially up
higurashi has a lot of *that* scenes
you're going to have to be more specific lol

I wish more anime of this nature came out today
it has an atmosphere you don't really see these days anymore
lain is absolutely fantastic
why does netflix have to ruin fucking everything
but goddamn
so luckily not the entire show is like this
and your expectations
maybe you should take a step back and rethink your comparisons
random kid falling into a mecha and all that
a *lot* of anime do that
not just battle royale either
what's this?
https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/interest/2021-06-26/kingdom-hearts-evangelion-singer-hikaru-utada-comes-out-as-non-binary/.174473
and haganai
i personally also disliked toji no miko
and then it just didn't
terraformars had something going for it
holy shit bahamut really is an IS ripoff
and ugly
yet somehow it managed to be both boring and stupid
yeah that
seiken tsukai?
i think it was...
there was this one anime that was both bad and ugly
so without all its various collabs it sucks
iirc the game itself is just a crossover galore
i have no idea
~~jojo~~
akikan
otoboku
spec ops asuka
tsukihime anime
oreimo
kampfer
it has a nice opening
cypher talking about his favorite anime
that's just a shit adaptation of an equally shit LN
oh
kaiyari?
i didn't like anything in it
western anime fandom was a mistake <:kanadeShrug:289459139174989834>
I will laugh so hard if it does
tfw Lynn Okamoto's hot new manga is parallel paradise <:Teedus:632320401397252107>
this is what mid 2000s weebs thought was good
look at this list

I recall that one anime list from 2005
the standards in the mid 2000s were way different
it's difficult to compare when today it's considered bad
cos back then it was hot af
Shirou stealing Ichika's heroines üôÉ
more like
the best part of all the shit battle school anime is that you can make really good crossovers with them
i just like how the conquest ending is such a total tone shift
of course you do <:KanadeSmug:688191203178840064>
this looks nice

My man
a hiroyuki work after all
oh it's this shit lol
My man
like, it looks and feels like a mid 2000s anime
even if the artstyle is supposed to be reminiscent of the old one, it feels like it has lacking production values
is it just me or does getter robo arc look a little ancient
Ufotable flexing their budget
with panels of the manga
a 2021 rendition of Dragon
at least the ed theme is neat
continuing with getter robo arc
it'll come
give it time

I didnt know these characters and now I want to know them
just that alone can color your expectations even when you don't want them to
and if you hang out in a space with other people, you're bound to run into something being hyped or anti-hyped to high heavens
hype, for example, easily makes or breaks shows
I agree, although in some cases it's sometimes unavoidable
others enjoy scrutinising every detail
some enjoy things by not thinking about them at all
I don't think there's a right or wrong way to enjoy a piece of media
I don't completely agree with that

I'm pretty convinced the author of this played Fate or something beforehand and took as many concepts as possible
sky girls
read or die

on that ga rei zero op video
cypher
but the manga it's based on is crap
it's actually a really fun and tragic anime
ga rei zero alone is better than all of the manga combined

btw cypher does nobuna go in an interesting direction?

the anime had an all star cast for no bloody reason other than they could

did someone say
October is stacked yo
And then the movie came and the series' entire tone shifted dramatically
I still find it funny that Ghost in the Shell was originally comedic in nature
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxkMzn4et2U
on the other, they have computers and pepsi
on one hand it's like, feudal
it's so anarchronistic
what even is the period in naruto
there's the technical definition and the accepted definition
mecha is almost always scifi, but scifi is not always mecha
you're taking it too literally
Does that mean Vivy has a small dwarf piloting her?
wow they suddenly remembered black rock shooter out of nowhere?
it is indeed
but what they don't say is that those cookies make you fat
you know how they say the dark side has cookies

cypher don't forget to watch the other seasons of steel angel kurumi
danke
anyone know anime streaming sites besides 9anime and animepahe?
You should check out the movies too
Yeah still pretty hype
oh are you watching madoka for the first time?
Funnily enough, a few friends of mine found the adaptation to be *superior* to the mobile game because of just how much the visuals add and the way they took a different turn from what's expected
It's a whole lot better if you come into it with an open mind
People say it's not great because they expected Madoka 2.0 when instead it's a spinoff with a different atmosphere and themes. The visual uniqueness is still there thankfully, but it was all a matter of expectations
clearly he hasn't met kenshiro
Well, Higurashi is split into whats called "question arcs" and "answer arcs". The first season raises all the questions and deepens the mystery while Kai starts giving the answers, so if youre ready for the answers, go ahead
Their trainer is Yugi Muto, who came from planet Vegeta in order to rescue Konoha Village from the Hollows
Calling it now
Third one will digivolve into a waifu

<a:reee:832657992091828265>
Like seriously, you can write a research paper about this
But it wouldnt have been #1 manga for weeks on end and a household name within a year
Like yeah, it wouldve been good
Yeah I mean I liked it too but it didnt really do anything we havent already seen
And has good animation
Imagine a world where ex arm isnt a disaster
And how much it actually matters
And it goes to show how animation alone can elevate something
But then ufotable happened
There were some parts that stood out, but otherwise normal
Super basic shonen of basicness
It is basic
They took what was a fairly standard shonen fight and gave it an insane wow factor
The movie was good purely due to ufotable's godlike animation
Like jfc how did it explode this high so quickly
Yeah Demon Slayer's popularity exploded in a scary way

one day we'll get nowayu animated
considering I haven't seen s2 and 3, this is me also playing catch up lol
<@!152896851660505088> time to rewatch
<@!468591607332208641> is there like a genuine reason why the animation in getter robo arc looks like so much ass
<@152896851660505088> millhi is cute
and honestly I have to agree, because madoka is at its strongest when it makes use of the stuff that made it stand out in the first place
I haven't played much of the game myself (only a little bit on NA before it shut down), but I have friends who do play jp and just straight up told me to ignore the game and watch the anime because it was just that well done
it's honestly pretty damn engrossing and the visuals are some of the best madoka has had
but I disagree that it's an automatic "don't watch it's crap"
again, it's fine to not like it
the magia record anime is perfectly fine
and nobody would be able to tell you which was mid in the 2000s and which in 2021
or shin mazinger
you legit could put it next to like new getter robo
it genuinely doesn't look good
unless this is some artistic expression sort of thing in trying to emulate the early 2000s animation
like
<@!152896851660505088>

considering the production issues it had, honestly this was kind of inevitable

konosuba doesn't deconstruct isekai though
no commitment, no bullshit, no losses, no expectations!
this is why you sail the high seas
I ain't gonna talk about it here
You're gonna have to catch up on everything surrounding this
you can also tell ahead of time how the drama around this is gonna go down
everything about this screams subpar
akin to avatar
but it's anime-like rather than anime entirely

they don't know the real doggirl
look at all these cultureless noobs, Millhi
smh
that was a great meme
it was
now that was funny
remember that time interspecies reviewers was in first place for a little while?
you can already see the pitchforks
is this a good thing?
<@!384495616065273856> what season of Rider is this
nice
Oh shit it's the uncensored version
rewatching
the first one
Time to culture
it's really good
play the game my dude
||after that manga ending they fucking better make a movie||
Dont forget final part 4
how hasn't that got old already
oh this rodeo again?
i mean that's what it is
My nichest manga is Chef of Nobunaga
fairly forgettable, but fine
yeah it was alright
isnt that just Lio from Promare
GLT?
Kampfer might be a good betting material
not something with some actualy inherent value
but you want something idiotic and trashy
but higurashi is actually good
you can use it as betting material
they also tend to be fairly hands off cos you don't bother getting attached to the characters
that way you can appreciate the good stuff even more
honestly yeah, sometimes you just need something that's spicy and trashy to add a bit of variety
so now you get more of it but in even worse contexts lmao
this is because too many people complained about fanservice and harems <:KanadeSmug:688191203178840064>
the streisand effect, as it's called
call it a self fulfilling prophecy
in a parallel paradise üôÉ
no such thing as bad publicity amirite
it was hilariously successful
apparently yeah
so can this
if redo of healer can get an anime and even another season
it's not the only thing turning hard there <:KanadeSmug:688191203178840064>
now *that* will be spicy
i'm just waiting for parallel paradise to get an anime
The anime my dude
Oh huh
Anyway, we need to go into this with appropriate expectations
Fate UBW and HF kinda
Your eye is keener than mine cos I dont see it
Good luck animating tens of thousands of these all at once
Tbf
No one can watch this <:Teedus:632320401397252107>

false, they're just too obsessed with what's "in" and "cool" to watch and like
it's just a popularity contest
MAL isn't a site for actual scores and ratings
I just hope it's actually building up to what we think it's building up to
when are they not shit
and it's not like all mecha shows have sublime endings
whether they end well is a different matter
and don't take 500 episodes to do so
shows actually ending is pretty rare nowadays after all
~~I mean the doujins are pretty good~~
in the manga it's less egregious but in the anime they went way too hard on it
but can't fault anyone for not liking that
prisma illya is pretty good if you can deal with the excessively egregious loli fanservice
https://tenor.com/view/wtf-time-robin-williams-what-year-is-it-jumanji-gif-5640889
nobody cares what nasu thinks
zero and FSN spoil each other and you can't do anything about that
they decided to stick to his narrative and how he affects the war
rather than really go all in on the team deathmatch aspect
like, sieg himself isn't so much the problem as much as the unnecessary amount of attention the story was forced to give him
apocrypha could've been much better if it was more focused on everything not sieg
And yes, Nasu got owned and the remake basically got reverse engineered within 3 days
Not only cos the remake isnt tled yet, but also cos it's genuinely good
Definitely
you just got a remake of the near side + an upcoming remake of the farside that includes a sacchin route!
I genuinely remember nothing about this show
so at least on the OST department we're good
and Violet Evergarden
ye I see now
<@!152896851660505088> tfw I just realized Muvluv anime's composer is Evan Call who also did work on Gear
I'll be more surprised if it ends up a good adaptation
But still
At least they planned it well in advance
Easier for it to be one than not
I have fully prepared myself for this to be a disaster

thankfully, after hollow ataraxia he completely did away with the sex scenes
mollusks
you called?
once he left the academy, it just became a clusterfuck and devolved into truly low bar isekai
I caught ahead in the manga and tbh it lost all of what made it remotely interesting at the very beginning
go drink boobs
i don't think there is
I never thought i'd see that and madoka in the same context
also pretty funny he mentions dokuro chan
girl reminds me of asuka
well, at least it looks kinda nice from the visual?
wow
I'll give the fate extra anime credit for giving us cu chulainn rin
not very good

decided to rewatch Excel Saga because I can
fall season is stacked
I was getting tired of aoi yuuki but her performance here is top notch
this is super good
dude
her role is interesting this time
not this time
how unsurprising
aoi yuuki is in it
oh
Neat
Oh heike is out?
yeah 86 is pretty cute
My theoretical watch list for next season:
Demon slayer 2
Komi san
Platinum End
86 2
Mieruko-chan
Takt op Destiny
World End Harem
Saihate no Paladin
Laika to Nosferatu
Sakugan
Sugu Shinu
Muvluv
Sankaku Mado
Yuyuyu
Deep Insanity
Shikizakura
Tesla Note
Gyakuten Sekai
Kyoukai Senki

Now, I say theoretical, because 80% of these I'm gonna start and not actually continue so it's gonna be cut down probably to maybe 5 or 6 lel
they painted the entire procedure in a positive light
it was highly regarded
on the contrary
how is it infamous
taking something frowned upon in their society and talking about it in a positive, mature manner
the aforementioned c-section episode is one such highlight
hugtto is fantastic as a vehicle for exploring themes usual precure season don't
what the hell is with that boy's hair
the dissonance between the ladylike characteristics and the brutish attitude is hilarious
her methods are so straightforward and hilarious
just fucking punches her in the face
this is lit
<@!237964037898502144> *yo*

I also like how you can already tell their personalities
but it looks good
they look like they took your average idol troop and put them in a hockey ring
power levels have no meaning in db
MASA SAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAN
yes hello?
then did everything in its power to be as horrifically generic and boring as possible
it started off slightly promising
it's just pure isekai badness
it's not that it's nonsense
seirei gensouki is just bad
i swear the animation in realist hero gets worse every episode lmao
but with little fairies!
forgot the name
nah it was a different one
what works with the BETA is that they're so ugly and disconcerting, and the way they move like cockroaches makes them disturbing and scary
walking ballsacks indeed <:Teedus:632320401397252107>
hoh?
who the heck knows
at least norio wakamoto is staying
I'm also eagerly awaiting the comments from AOT fans
not only am I expecting it to be bad
the chance is higher that it is than it isn't
I'll bite through the tears
I'
my loyalty is too high to drop it even if it's shit
my list is pretty big but I'll most likely drop a lot of things
omega boobs
you say that like that doesn't happen all the time
the rest isn't

well, in some parts
the wiki is total shit lol

<:Twiz:242044344570347520><:zlers:242044346810105856>
the what it exactly sounds like
strike frontier was the gacha game that shut down
that's understandable

all his VNs <:Ver:704169051391524875>
he has a very clear calling card in his works
it's fine
You either like what Urobuchi does or you don't
once she's not as much of a focus and it turns back to other antagonists, it's much better
Prilliya's weakest part is without a doubt Kuro's introduction and the events immediately following
Shirou stealing his sister's spinoff
it goes all in on its Fate background and it's fantastic
Prilliya is also super based later on especially in Drei
it's a shame it wasn't even slightly alluded to
yeah that was a bit ???
funnily enough, Monogatari's way of doing it is the way I personally don't like
but the UBW anime yeah
the VN no
Fate is a tad too dependent on itself to function, if that makes sense
wow heike monogatari is really good
legally or illegally
Cutest story
It's all happy and sunshine
Nah
Mystic eyes of uhhh weird perception
Yeah it's really nice

precure had worse ones
this is tame in comparison
seen worse
||As an aside, Emi Evans's score is fucking incredible||
FeMC's design in both normal and super form is really nice
then it's pretty damn dark
until it starts to heavily embrace its Fate side
pure lies
why only considering?
<@!297542051057238017>
The real yuri on ice
new season of love live looks neat
The deep fried photos give a very nice vibe
Specifically the backgrounds
But tbh I like the OGs more
Mion has more boob on steam lel
2000s vn babyyyy
Rena with a fucking Gungnir cleaver
Wait till you see the Symphogear collab
Steins gate collab
Oh yeah
the episode was shorter than usual
if a bit fast paced
I think it was quite nice
yeah this was just an appetizer
you're way more critical about it than I am lel
it's difficult to say how it'll end up
but now we need to see how they deliver the rest
this was a nice first episode
have you ever played the game?
yep
how can you get giant mecha wrong so often
like
it's weird that it's like this tbh
always
is it like the aya hirano deal back from like a decade ago
that sounds like a fun story
wait who's the one doing the eating

<@!99695384296701952> <@!468591607332208641> did you two check out megaton kyu musashi?
Thats cute
my seasonal watch list is a bit big lol
cypher go watch megaton kyu musashi lel
fair enough
86 also kept the overarching enemies relevant
You are pretty crazy then
Yeah lol
gai is pretty cute
ok
what's up
zeus is an asshole what can you do
Rama was a girl in one incarnation iirc
Does Rama count, considering the avatar of Vishnu nonsense?
so in Fate, (You) get to decide their gender
<@!161155855524298752> if it counts, Chevalier deon is genderfluid in fate
and he changed his names to Caenus iirc
so he gave her a boon and made her a man
after being raped by him
by poseidon
and yeah, caenis was potentially one of them
there's a few unknown genders
not that I recall
hmmm

<:MariaDefeated:688429716780089397>
but I got such bad vibes from everything going on, I don't have it in me to let it slide
i'm probably being overly critical going off all of 1 episode yeah
cos they uploaded full playthroughs of both extra and unlimited to the official youtube channel
you know how I know that?
you have no reason to care about any of the characters *even as a VN reader*
the animation is mediocre to below average, and at times was awful
or *any* weight really
the important scenes that should mark the start of alternative are completely lacking in emotional weight
takeru himself just pukes out terms viewers have no reason to know yet acts like they should already know them
rushed rushed rushed rushed
that's the name of the game here
they rush a barely introduction to takeru without giving any actual context
the episode starts with it automatically assuming you played extra and unlimited
and the ending theme is just pure üöÆ
this was such a generic opening unfitting for what the atmosphere of the series is supposed to be
even ignoring the openings the vn had
really really meh
the op is meh as hell
I legit could not find a single thing I genuinely liked

<:monkaS:690172939827806240>
<@152896851660505088>
tesla note looks like steamed ass
<@!152896851660505088> didn't you say world end harem was delayed to january?
it's that old style of edgy
platinum end is both exasperating and refreshing
but it's also horrendously bad lel
it's like, fine?
I mean
but Kampfer?
now see, these are highly cultured anime
oh no lol
and Red is a badass
mewtwo is one of the best characters
pokemon adventures is based af
calls him millhiore-chan
millhi has nana on speeddial
you mean steal everything all the time every time no matter what?
no such thing as bad publicity huh?
is this trend actually lucrative for them or is it pure stupidity
millhi, since you're the resident industry expert
just like all nfts, this is fucking stupid to the core
i'm not happy about this

Whoever buys this either:
1. Has too much spare money
2. Has too little brains
3. Is a giant sucker
4. Any combination of the above
It's not even a good offer
fena

https://kotaku.com/440-super-mario-bros-x-one-piece-crossover-has-wonder-1847888860
isn't AKB the idol death game one
and macross
idolmaster xenoglossia exists
i mean
get some sucker to buy that idiotic nft so you can right click save
burn those too
just so I can burn them
of course
now that's a good one
get me an autograph from kikuko inoue
but we were taken back in time
we didn't think bad vn adaptations were possible anymore
this is very mid 2000s
if anything cypher
it's just a blank image
there's no muvluv alternative anime

<@!152896851660505088> moovloov
<:Teedus:632320401397252107>
He hates it lol
<:Teedus:632320401397252107>
<@152896851660505088>
https://youtu.be/Pluc0XbL_ks
but is it like mooblube?
it seems all great writers fall in idol hell
Everybody loves warcrimes!
that's what I'm asking
I don't understand the direction Fena went in
clearly, a chinese disney cartoon
amazing
Mystic Eyes of Meat Perception
||takeru giving yuuko the ideas of cancels and combos and her deciding it's worth a shot||
yeah lol
of course, ||they once again showed flashbacks of sumika, who at this point they have not at all explained||
it's the ||lead up to xm3||
what? no no no
<@!152896851660505088> today's nooblube alternative was actually almost passable!
30 is coming out in like 10 hours
Youre late cypher
but at least mechas show up!
oh of course the animation is as terrible as always
lmao
maybe just a singular car crash
but not entirely a disaster pile up
still very embarrassing
still really bad
basically
||mana shows up too but it's an ultra rushed introduction||
that's where it ends pretty much
the deen anime had some nice moments
meiya's og va like retired for voice acting no?
a friend of mine described their new design as if their hair is constantly wet
how can you forget meiya and her gundam hair
lubemoob
hyped for TE vn too
nope
the day after part 4 basically
literally everything that is not the anime looks good
at least mikhail and immortals look lit
problem: exists
Char: "Imma drop a colony on it"
too much cash when in 2006 they could hire jam project to sing like multiple songs for the game
they are pretty much zombies yeah
gundam
I read the manga and she just destroys with her cuteness
The little girl is so adorable it's painful
<:crybasa:773199802249904149>
one day muvluv in a proper srw
one day
jam are the best jam
the sumika you know nothing about and whose importance is completely a mystery
<:asagi_pat:817618458052788305>
Mr. and Mrs. Smith the anime
who cares about ratings though
it feels like it's a series specifically made to be included in SRW and to be massively improved by it
in a weird sort of way
and also tries to be somewhat Gundam but also not succeeding in that either
I feel like it's doing everything Code Geass did but worse
Kyoukai Senki is such a code geass wannabe lol
btw
and then just stomps
cos mazinkaiser is absent for 90% of the movie
boring
it's just

Zero has such badass art
the manga is better in every way lol
tbf at least it wasn't as bad as mazinkaiser vs general dark
mediocre
but everything else is just
the fights are badass af
it's just meh
and not giving Shin Mazinger a proper continuation
clearly not that loved when Infinity was the best they could do
~~you say that like it's a bad thing amirite~~
and then read the VN üôÉ
chinese cartoons
but anime is also cartoons
it was kinda boring
although gotta admit Arc dissapointed me
season 2??
????
>comes out next year
maybe should reexperience it
experienced it like 15 years ago
~~shaved ballsack~~
<@99695384296701952> <@152896851660505088>
WHAT
muvluv alternative might join it soon <a:KirikaTwirl:752996271702147162>

these are my lowest on anilist
anitubers were a mistake <a:jeannehappydance:600532211707543573>
they're ultra short for a reason and can barely be said to even have a narrative
I don't think ovas should count for worst anime
I see beta-kun
it's *that* kind of anime
oh
lmao
and I remember I watched it but not what it was about
i don't remember a single detail of comet lucifer lol
but understandable
harsh seeing it that low
oof Shana
Gacha is angelic in comparison
I have so many questions
What the flying fuck
Literally nft lootbox
What
...
...
<@!468591607332208641> so have you been catching up with megaton musashi?
2009 anime
and from modern times, Arte and tonikaku kawaii
can't be that bad
you sure? they did nanoha and dog days
im shocked too
very ecchi
https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2021-11-17/ya-boy-kongming-manga-gets-tv-anime-in-april-2022-by-p.a-works/.179539
omg this is getting an anime too
fucking nice
no freaking way
WHAT
!!!!
no fingers lol
quite

THEY CAN'T EVEN DO BASIC LIP MOVEMENTS PROPERLY
<@!152896851660505088> basic lip movements
You can make a game made entirely of Brave titles
The dumbest gundam op
<@722121666641133608>
https://youtu.be/Zw-X8DkdZhM
They sure like that effect lol
Finally
Interesting
These designs are...
<@152896851660505088> oh geez
I mean it's not impossible to get used to but yeah it's different as hell
no stopping the cure chain
LOL
that is a big bird
this actually was good
wow
the legend!
invented a time machine just to go back to ancient egypt/the afterlife so he can duel him
it's basically Getter Robo but also Muvluv but also Pacific Rim
it's a fun little series
suddenly, insert song by aoi yuuki
>megaton musashi
~~just remove the horses~~
when the primary horseman says so, you know it's true
we get more peace of mind!
they get a bunch of episodes to binge
I don't see a problem with this
they aren't as terribly unbearable as in the past
I have to admit that with the release of part 6 the fans have been a lot more subdued this time around
aka the greatest series to have ever been thought by a person with a brain
Nobody ruins Excel Saga
Excel Saga is too perfect to be ruined by something this stupid!
Wait did Sunrise make Combattler and Voltes or was it Nue
The Big O's protagonist always looked like bruce wayne
"Only"
Lel
Does it count as a ripoff when sunrise made like 99% of all mechas at the time lol
Char Solo
Kamille Skywalker
Kek
Wew. I expected this answer yet Im still surprised, considering Gundam at least came out very close to A New Hope
"Beam sword"
<@99695384296701952> a question that I wondered
Did Gundam and later Sunrise shows derive some sort of influence from Star Wars? Like L-Gaim, where he has a lightsaber and all

Oh shit what
also this is more about yongyea who's a pretty cool guy so good for him
mostly
I mostly mellowed out on it
lel
congrats to him
YongYea got a major role
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CagZrix3iUk
well I'll be damned
A bit late but yeah
6? 7?
hmmmm
takes a bit to get going but it has good mecha action and good character interactions
gotta say Megaton Musashi is surprisingly good
<@!152896851660505088> how much do you hate that Muvluv manages to be somewhat decent now
if a freak hurricane ravaged an entire coastal city, picked up a card, and somehow jettisoned it halfway across the world to a duelist's hand, that's legit
at least the drip is back
just from this trailer it looks pretty damn good
OH SHIT
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

mega ultra chicken
w-what
when exactly did I say that because I like bleach that I think it's better?
how is that = that
???
never said it was better
what? go on forever, never reaching a conclusion within 1000 chapters, reiterate and revisit the same themes repeatedly, and never actually get anywhere?
it didn't feel like that was what they were going for with it
i'm weird in that I wouldn't mind a bleach sequel
egg
Shinji-kun?
she's there
<@!722121666641133608> btw, if you want more Velvet, you can watch Tales of Zestiria the X
heck, there were parts of the movie that were strictly better animated than even heaven's feel
yeah ufotable were just flexing the entire time
and then overnight it was insane
one day it was like meh
*HOW*
like yeah I like it but *how*
i still can't understand how demon slayer got so insanely popular so quickly
not completely, but kind of
old guard shonens kinda aged poorly
shounens don't have fillers anymore
I can see what you mean
and awful endings
shounens as a whole have a problem of length
there's only so much you can do before you start redoing the same thing over and over again
ridiculous length isn't one of those
there are a lot of ways other works could be like one piece
I don't understand your reasoning
Gundoom
||It's one of my favorite parts of the VN||
same tbh
2) the anime is crap. it has been crap. we wanted it to die and be forgotten, but they seem intent on continuing the crap
1) muvluv is a criticially acclaimed VN series that recently got an anime adaptation for its 3rd and longest story arc, very messily cutting out a majority of the context that made the original good and engaging
this'll have a season 3 probably
hmmmmmmmmmmm
millhi why did you do this

Shoo shoo snake child!
Not that one!
As you should
those are not mutually exclusive <:YumiPoint:688429724103344164>
isn't that the battle royal one
Anya is such a potato
Uniform!
Uniform!
a rock skirt sounds painful
Looks like she fucked herself real hard
<@152896851660505088> so Narumi Runa quite entertainment
and after that you need to read the mazinger zero manga
ohhh ok
but it's hilariously edgy and kinda cool
it's a series that has no reason to exist
<@!477182101330984960> now watch mazinkaiser skl
that was in the series iirc
at least majin kenzan is an epic af song
he also too easily destroyed general dark
the last 10 minutes of it
considering mazinkaiser is only in like
yeah the movie isn't that great
<@87512939107450880>
Still one of my fav eds
https://youtu.be/PQjMZbob4mM
*you havent seen Valkyrie Drive???*
But then I discovered big titty harems
I used to be a yuri connoisseur
Who can forget that one
That and Strawberry Panic
Watch and find out!
It's yuri and also mecha and also supernatural
Kannazuki no Miko
ah sakugan
Amaaim?
it says
giant scale figure
centaur princess
old news lel
now do a Gear chart
Yo Orient is high key kickass
it's very much a "tosses you in expecting you to know things" sort of start
interesting
yeah the pacing is...
And the anime looks beautiful
The manga is already god tier
Sono bisque doll yeah
Dress up darling is anime of the season
I only know some of them by context
also the stupid amount of untranslated chinese terms kinda makes it hard to follow
but it's not focusing on what's actually interesting
I was hyped for a three kingdoms anime
but yeah this is pretty blergh
I mean I guess the bucket is also funny?
he's our man Genjuro!

there's no reason other than a morale one to use legal sites

all of those services are god awful in literally every single way possible
genuinely terrible video made by an elitist
it was dumb
I saw it

It does???
in a weird way it feels like a subversion of a genre that never existed lol
actually villainous?
when was the last time the villainess was well
yeah but like
but when was the last time this was actually played straight?
new cute girl comes, bunch of love interests, evil villainess who gets banished or punished and whatnot
right now, they're supposed to be subversions of the otome game genre right?
villainess stories
I've been wondering
You know
also lmao at the ripley one
wow
oh, in 11 hours
about damn time!

also gay af

it's absurdly cute

bleach characters have the most drip
who
and you thought Gear wasn't bad <:GenjuroLaugh:689563633516150872>
ufotable fucking destroying with this season of demon slayer
later on, he finds out his dad remarried
at a mixer, he has a one night stand with a girl
guy has a crush on his hot teacher
a really messy romantic drama
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ua5UARWRYLA
at least it has a really fire op
I even finished the manga for it
domestic girlfriend was something else
the only one I have lower than it is oreimo s2 <:GenjuroLaugh:689563633516150872>
I gave jojo a 4 because I heavily dislike the show and despise the fanbase, so I made it low partially out of spite too
it's okay
cos they're the best study cases for the polarity of opinions
this is most obviously shown when talking about any show that is popular
yet anyone could still end up disliking it
a show could be a goddamn masterpiece in every "objective" sense of the word
but in the end it matters very little to the viewer
we can talk all day about some so called "objective quality"
that's the right attitude
so the numbers themselves don't really mean much
one person's 10 can be another's 5 easily
to me, 10s mean shows that are my absolute personal favorites
i mean, it depends what your 10s mean to you
nothing special
it was okay
yeah pretty much
snoop dogg remixes are the great shit ever
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJfg39WkMvE
the only good hot teacher anime i've seen was Onegai Teacher
yeah it's the teacher
it doesn't even take into consideration all the other characters
there is a *stupid* amount of drama involved
who're sisters
So now he has to deal with living both with his crush and the girl he slept with
who turn out to be the teacher *and* the girl he had a one night stand with
the new mom brings her children with her
I should rewatch ikki tousen
where
when he was 10 years old
my dad watched it
never watched the original lel
good time as any to continue!

I've finished the manga a while ago and I don't really feel like watching the end of this arc
i just kinda dropped aot tbh
tiny blonde gets wrecked by teacher
:^)
this is insanely common in revenge porn stories
bonus points for the saintess and or the pope being the alpha assholes

both mha and one piece are gonna shit their endings
demon slayer? shit ending
fairy tail? shit ending

dragon ball? shit ending
naruto? shit ending
bleach? shit ending
it's a rule of shonen to never stick the landing

everything post timeskip is cringe af
yeah

that shit was solid af
also I wish rosario vampire had a proper anime
highschool dxd was lit
it's kinda like precure in a way
i dont really count kid shows like beyblade
i mean sure, I won't say no to seeing lucy's and erza's sexy ass, but I don't need a whole new manga for that
i mean, fairy tail pulled a boruto and did a sequel manga despite the ending
might as well pull a hunter x hunter and just have it die on its own
wouldn't hold my breath for a good ending for that either
dude's gonna die before he finishes it
dude has houki and char but he can't even make a simple decision

starting with ghost in the shell which I watched one night before school on adult swim
but at least i discovered anime there
yeah I hated my time in america
cos American middle schoolers sucked and I didn't have any friends lel
discovering anime for the first time
oh yeah, Florida
I was... where was I
nah that's more recent
i wish lel
and type moon commonly appeared in special thanks sections of credits
heck, there's a whole character in higu that's literally a reference to Ciel
the entire reason higurashi came out on nscripter was because tsukihime did
ryukishi was himself inspired by nasu
you know what the funny thing is?
it felt like ryukishi was trying to be smarter than he had any reason to be
to the point that it felt like a detriment
yeah but umineko was *too* complicated
I just didn't like the overcomplicated nature it decided to take
i dropped it after the fourth question arc
umineko is unadaptable lel
that's how much of a piss it was
Ciconia got delayed for GouSotsu
https://07th-expansion.fandom.com/wiki/Higurashi_no_Naku_Koro_ni_Oni
we're also getting a Sonozaki Oryou origin story
in the end we got whatever it ended up being
what we wanted them to be was ||some kind of genuine connection between higu and umineko, perhaps serving as an origin story for bernkastel, umineko's main antagonist||
they weren't based on anything
gou and sotsu were anime original
and were generally completely pointless
destroyed characterizations
gou and sotsu spat on all of the themes the series ever explored
there was even an interview he did post series
I'm 90% sure it was him
ryukishi took the piss
grandiously
nope
I watched revue and dont remember anything about it
I liked it when IB just said nope to stuff
OH
Best girl
Well she's hot
Who's she
Nfts 100%
I swear to god if they fuck this up
they better not fuck this up
oh boy
this was so fantastic
it was
Thats not what the doujins think!
why are they doing it like this
are they stupid
wtf
wait so the anime isn't ending on the actual finale?
And kid's first edgy anime
And teen phase
We liked it cos we liked it I guess
interestingly, he's *not* series composition this time
only if juliet wasn't a pushover
it's more like romeo and juliet
it's not to be taken too seriously as an actual good vs evil narrative
it's light hearted and funny
you'd think the writer of death note would be able to deliver something less idiotic than this
it's gonna be shit anyway
shit is like 20 years old
it took them this long to make a hentai of it?
did someone say marin daki
the original ship girls
Send as .bmp
Owari no seraph says hi
But still, cool designs all around
She looks like a precure mc lel
I think Sunrise need someone to think up better names lol
*Arte*style amirite
The
Give me all the gundams
Who cares about fucking Zakus
And they out all the boring mechs in
harkening back to dragon ball power levels where it becomes arbitrary and loses meaning
it can feel highly excessive in its scale
but i can see where you're coming from
just an excuse for the infinite scaling
but it was highly secondary
well, not completely
completely forgoing any sense of substance for maximum style
that's the essence of gurren lagann imo
( i hate that idiom anyway)
i don't think it's a matter of turning off the brain or not
definitely
the main changes lie in the climaxes of each part
genuinely
I loved what they did
yeah
well, 15 years later that opinion changed somewhat but it's still one of the most bombastic I've liked
everything about it was so different from the anime I used to watch at the time I wasn't sure I could find anything like it ever
one of my first mechas and still very dear to my heart
gurren lagann <:ElsaCharge:690470897559011328>
a *really* good job
like
they did a great job on it
wow
so watched the first episode of Ya Boy Kongming

s3 was kinda meh
animation is pretty good this time around
that sure was an ending lol
exactly
because you know it's fun crap
none of them are on nyaa
there are files they check
or the occassional visual nobel
they don't care about anime
haven't seen s1 so nope
this season's watch list
https://9anime.to/home
.to is usually the go to
they have various mirrors
just put 9anime.to in the url bar
I use it all the time
yeah
then you won't meet russian milfs in your area
unless you want to meet hot russian milfs in your area
make sure you have an adblock
animepahe or 9anime.to
only uploads

oh yeah add spy x family when it drops
Ho! Tell D.u.s.k arc

STATUE IN WINE
PEOPLE SITTING IN CHAIRS
WOMAN FALLING FROM CASTLE
only a couple of months ago? sounds like a mid 2000s complaint lel
simple! ||none of that happens||
we don't take about sotsugou
higurashi is more linear in that regard
"fan discs"
they were technically
yeah, both did that
sometimes I miss pre-FGO nasuverse
isn't it sad, sacchin?
in the other one ||shiki "dies" to help her regain her sanity and she vows to look for him||
Out of context it makes no sense
Happy delusion: "teehee, oniichan you so silly!"
Bad delusion: sister dies from poisoned juice
Delusion!
just the opening
nothing after that
the first 1.30 minutes
but only the opening
you should watch valvrave
easier than Fate even
and just a bunch of spinoffs
the VNs are a very straight line
it's not really that goofy
where the hell is the TE VN goddammit!
but yeah, yor is best girl
nigthfall is actually pretty adorable like that lel
with shit tl though

"Yeah he's right." - Author

they later marry men called jack and chad
old manga but good
when's the Girl Friends adaptation
I mean don't you go to your closest friend and tell them they're your emotional oasis?
clearly it's completely platonic
I have some doubts
i dunno fenny
I read that as "I want piracy"
never forget the original annotations
sounds exactly how ikki tousen should be
in a single chapter Mira shot up the best girl list
but he'd be mean and bad and stupid
yes
this one is amazing and I love it and the fact that it's getting an anime means god still exists
It lives?

Do they say "no homo" after being married for 603 years and having 50 children, 148 grandchildren, and at least 5 imperial dynasties?
Everything about it is amazing
the fact nobody mentions naruto shippuden's legendary 52 episode filler depresses me
and you'd say thank you for it!
back in my day, you'd have a full year of filler!
young whippersnappers these days don't even know what filler is!

It's *really fucking good*

Started reading Oshi no Ko due to the anime being announced
Pay attention to ||Ruby and Aqua's star pupil at various times.||
they don't count if you didn't know they were anime at the time üò§
mahoyo is coming soon enough
yes
Watched KnK
Read everything Tsukihime possible under the sun and the moon, up to and including prelude and talk
muvluv alternative doesn't have one either
yeah it's a shame
and yes she's much cooler and less forgettable
BIRDY!
barely holds itself together
but it's very fragile
and the story is... servicable
on one hand, it's more madoka goodness with the on brand weirdness and artstyle
Magia Record's anime is a mixed bag
üôÉ
HF has the most H after all
and then beast's lair
then a giant void
then kars fans
there's type moon fans
you went from bad to worse
if it rhymes with type moon fans, you know you dont listen to them
from who
Then go Hollow Ataraxia too
And if you saw or played or whatever Stay Night
Yes go play kagetsu
In any case
par for the course for lain
or what's actually happening
or how to play it
i still have no idea what it is
they made it work
it was implemented onto a webpage
i found it yesterday
the serial experiments lain ps1 game üôÉ
cypher you can add another vn to the mix
so good thing something official picked it up
cos the english translation is made by fucking idiots
maybe one day tsukihime remake will get the treatment too
I'm seriously shocked that they're doing so for a show over 30 years old
wow they have a shitload of stuff don't they
gubnuster
an english dub?
after all this time
i didn't know that
***NOW???***
for *gunbuster*???
english dub???
wait what

what year is this
ahh, the trigun anime
what is it?
that and
Who Comes Up With These Names‚Ñ¢Ô∏è
is luffy pirate king yet
The way she stabs you is erotic
I mean Menou is pretty lewd
Now I want to rewatch it
I have the supremest taste
holy shit I'm seeing clips of the dub for kaguya and it's glorious
at least kurumi sets herself up as best girl in like 2 episodes
at least the animation is nicer than s3's
there's more legit action in the op than there is in the actual show
<@152896851660505088> i think the only interesting part of this season's date a live is the opening
https://kotaku.com/one-punch-man-movie-film-sony-pictures-avi-arad-adaptat-1849056947

Wow beat angel escalayer
Oh nice
Whoa where is this
this character is if you took marnie and morpeko and just fused them
but fenny, in the game you can be FeMHakuno and have a roman empress or fox wife as a well, wife
CCC is where it's at with all its craziness
it's *fine*
as for the game
we dont talk about the fate extra anime
play hollow ataraxia üôÉ
makes a lot of sense if it was
that particular scene?
ye
has nice music though
everything else is *eh*
only the battle with saber alter i can say is improved
the anime is also just... not very good?
in the anime they're shoved in your face and you have to watch them the entire time
I don't care about the lolicon parts, but at least in the manga you can go through them more quickly
but yeah, manga is the way to go with prilliya
drei is a *major* tone shift
i can promise you this shirou becomes less relevant as the series goes on
if anything
it simply never changed
i say this as someone who's been in that scene for years and years
this is just how it is
is to have anything beyond shirou fics or fgo fics
if there's one thing you shouldn't expect from fate fics
but they're using purely game soundtrack here lmao
also I don't remember if they did this in the previous season
op is pretty good
cos the first ones I found were atrocious
seems like there's a bunch of sub groups
seems they'll be the same quality as the previous season
well, they're out
<@152896851660505088> so the first 2 uta episodes
right off the bat you notice they ||completely removed the kuon scene that the game started with||
pacing is lightning speed as expected
and then they weren't
every time one of these korean webcomics get an anime announced people think it'll be the next hot shit
<:ShirabeSleep:691497302535176302>
DRAGON SLAVE!
hello Rain and your absurdly sexy rubber suit sequence

it's not going to be the next hot shit that's for sure

```Fascinating by tuna since childhood, high school girl Misaki dreams to catch and eat her own whole tuna. One day, Misaki really caught a tuna at the seaside; however, the fish just turned into a cute girl!

i liked izetta
i saw izetta and katana maidens but not girl in twilight
i see
izetta?
hell, the talk *was* the fight
it's more like a talk fight
but they weren't even really fighting
that's the one time i'd say it's fine to talk in a fight
i mean
the first season was decently entertaining I guess
oh there's Orient s2
nothing *really* caught my eye this time around
not sure what to watch this season
utawarerumono ep 3
this is exactly how I expected it to be
I like it!
This is really good! The premise is really unique despite thr fairly standard plot

Saber then finds herself with Sakura
Berserker proceeds to pancake you and illya transfers your soul into a doll forever
In which you choose to not fight in the war and run into illya and berserker on the way home
I recall one ancient fic that took place after the very first bad end
So she has Saber in her employ and wins the war
You can always go for that one bad end in which you agree to an alliance with Caster and she turns you into a fetus core of a projection wand
If you want Saber yuri just go for the abandoned house threesome or anything between Saber Alter and Dark Sakura
Caster then uses all her command spells on Saber who proceeds to excaliblast the three of you to oblivion
You choose to leave your hiding spot when Rin and Archer confront her
The second bad is in UBw
She comes back and evicerates your organs
When she attacks the house, you choose to send Saber to investigate
The first bad end happens in the fate route
Ye
In one or two bad ends she controls her completely
Saber's magic resistance allowed her to resist for some time but mostly Medea just had her in a pretty dress
Only in a bad end
*pretty much* yeah lol
but enjoyable enough
not amazing
not bad
oh neat, ty
```Clock Striker, now in graphic novel format, follows Shonen manga‚Äôs first Black female lead hero, Cast, in her quest to become a member of the SMITHS, the legendary warrior engineers.

Cast dreams of being a SMITH, and though she‚Äôs rather handy with her tools, no one in her small town ever realizes their dreams. Besides, these legendary warrior engineers haven‚Äôt been seen in years and were never known for having female members. Fortunately, Cast meets one surviving member named Ms. Philomena Clock, who agrees to take her on as her apprentice, or striker.

Now Cast is thrust into one deadly adventure after another! From cybernetic desperadoes to technology thieves and more, Cast has to use her mind and her remodeled robotics-lab prosthetic hand, which offers unfathomable offensive power in the form of scientific experiments. Need lightning? Cast can generate it from her hand! Cast‚Äôs mentor seeks to uncover an ominous mystery that explains what happened to the SMITHS and shines a light on a hidden power that may be within Cast herself.```
oh the site has a premise too
i'm on pc so nope

<:HibikiFingerguns:688429715836502063>
if it's good it's good, if it's bad it's bad
i guess we'll let time do the talking
for all we know it could end up amazing and the second coming of the last airbender
well, it is too early to tell and this is just first impressions
more specifically, the battle shonen
the biggest series we know fall under the shonen umbrella
it is the biggest demographic in anime and manga after all
a lot of everybody really lel
but he *is* selling it as a "shonen manga" so...
maybe I'm just not part of the intended demographic, and that's fair
possibly
pretty bad
which despite what they sold it on, it ended up being, well
I can only think about High Guardian Spice
unfortunately, I don't think this method of appealing has very much a history of working
that's fair
i can't help but feel it's going to end up a massive collection of cliches
battle shonen is already a very saturated medium so to stand out you need to deliver something interesting
Like he says it's shonen, but a more detailed premise would be nice
aside from that, it just... doesn't really look all that interesting?
*oof*
the way I see this going is that it might garner a few loyal fans but fail to keep its momentum and maybe 4 volumes in he'll just stop
it's like this mid 2000s sort of vibe
yeah star said it
it's already in a disadvantage due to not being japanese in origin
hopefully it's good but I don't see this picking up a lot of steam
The artstyle and overall vibe reminds me of a few series but for the life of me i can't remember which
apparently it's a prosthetic
which is pretty cool, but I dunno how much this will catch on
apparently the artist is from Nigeria
so it's not japanese in origin
ah okay I see
oh it's brand new
can't say I've heard of this manga
that's very interesting but what is it
That's the vibe I was getting!
SHAMAN KING
I dunno I just like giant robots with star wars sound effects
the eternal pain
Yep!

<@87512939107450880> i found this manga you might like
https://nanoha.fandom.com/wiki/Lyrical_Toy_Box
which is what makes it hilarious that her spinoff is vastly more well known and more popular than the game she debuted in
she's the most minors of characters there
and she's the only member of the family who doesn't know about it
the game focused on her family who are a family of assassins
nanoha was a literal non-factor in the game she spinoffed from
she wasn't even a factor in it
that's the neat part
~~more like the best part amirite~~

I swear to god if fata morgana gets adapted some day i will murder someone if the anime aucks
Why do all my favorite things gets such garbage adaptations
This will literally air at the same time as utawarerumono 3's adaptation, which also sucks ass
Genuinely
It sucks ass

that there are a lot
is that a good or bad thing
ah ok
AD?
both the op and the ed are better, so at least we can look forward to that
although I suppose this season will be better because it has some of the big moments in it
<@87512939107450880> look
at least the song is fire
the trailer makes this season look better than it actually is lmao
they actually done did it finally?
holy potatoes
I guess i'll just pirate harder
The only wonder egg there was the one the show received to its metaphorical face
Let things end please

Oh you finished eva?
how surprising!
Amongst other things
Since he wrote code geass, guilty crown, devilman crybaby, and eureka seven
It'll be either great or a trainwreck
that has no tomatoes
I like how Mercury is considered rural like some amish american town in the middle of ohio or something
probably like kana hanazawa, he doesn't know what they are and it's some marketing team doing it
why buy an nft of his work when you can just buy a normal physical copy
wut
shame his sequel got cancelled
his manga is actually gorgeous
poor ex arm author
<:KirikaPanic:644235681677180958>
at least it's funny
human error
for the crime of having no tomatoes
mercury of course
cypher cypher how much you wanna bet on axis drop in mercury witch
yeah it gives context
SO are you saying Sutella is secret hibiki/saint germain child?
what I appreciate about Suletta is that while she's a nervous wreck 100% of the time, she still stands up for what's right and isn't afraid of confrontations
and Suletta is a woodpecker
revue?
wait what is this
this is gonna be the best isekai this season
fucking rules
first ep of eminence in shadow
in other news
sumika's hair looks awful
character designs are still garbage tier
millhi i am shocked
but the visuals are alright too
like of course the song is good
*actually good?!?*
the opening is
holy shit

except, you know
wasn't... all that bad?
this ep of luv
<@152896851660505088> you know
this is delightfully bizarre lmao
I think the manager voiced by Ayahi
i personally don't agree with your assessements but we'll agree to disagree
+ setting it in the 80s and 90s which was kinda a yakuza glory days and you got this
as an aside, i think the entire premise is built on the wordplay between how they write maid in katakana (meido) and criminal underworld (meidou)
this ain't it imo
asuka was edge galore
but i don't think it's edgy
that's fine
asuka took itself almost 100% seriously while this definitely feels like it's one giant joke
i didn't feel like it was anywhere close to that to be honest. from the cartoonish blood spurts to the hilariously bizarre scene of her killing all the maids while doing wotagoei to the beat of a cutesy maid song to the tarantino-esque ending that has moe moe kyun in the lyrics
cos it doesn't take itself seriously
except it isn't
that exists
a thing
girlfriend of steel was
but yeah, the interpretation is up to you
some say that eps 25 and 26 are what's going on inside Shinji's head while third impact is happening
lol, that's a natural reaction
and the shockingly good doujin Retake
and read Anima
and play the ancient vn Girlfriend of Steel
at least you don't need to wait 50 years for rebuild's final movie
as you have like a bunch of more things to watch
which isn't the end of evangelion
so yeah, that was end of evangelion
that was what he was on
depression
there are also photos of the death threats anno got for the original TV ending scattered around here and there
but now the guilt is all mine~
remember when dvd menus were a thing?
yep
Ok lol I was wondering why they all looked the same lmao
Millhi are all those shows different lol
wew a full year I see

oh shit
or god forbid, gasoline cars
i bet they still use horse drawn carriages in mercury
where you have space cows and space farms and space cowboys and space alabama
the literal rural nothingness of the solar system
I knew it was coming when Mercury was considered the sticks of space
"Damn straight"
same as his of course
both were well done
and takeru's massive freakout that led up to it
yeah cypher this episode had chomp
is this adaptation leaving crappy land and going into alright land?
i can't believe it
not as aggressively shocking as the original, but worked well enough for an already intense episode
i think it was an alright adaptation of the scene
pretty damn intense
was actually
this ep

did someone say
yeah that one
yoko taro is definitely planning something
cowardly but brave, nervous and skittish but confident in her abilities, optimistic yet a realist, and is silly about the strangest things yet can be very serious when needed
I am liking Suletta a lot and her complex character
bike-zerker is the best part
but cypher
just needs some wings and it'd be set imo
is why I think Aerial also looks neat
lean gundam designs are pretty neat imo
*every day* is shirou day!

scryed is awesome

i was literally whoing the entire time
this isn't an inbetween frame either
wtf is happening in this shot
dude

<@152896851660505088> wow they played Wings in the ep
but I think it's a tad too serious
here they opted for a more serious direction, which is also great
the manga is funny pretty much all the time together with his opness
The anime's presentation is exquisite *but* I think they needed to make it more comedic
it's post-anime
ah wait ignore me about that latter comment
maybe even check out the other movies like solid state society
you should try stand alone complex
ghost in the shell kinda plays with it
cos cyberpunk is more often than not very bleak, capitalistic, dark, and pessimistic
you're right
but the movie is what really gave it its name as the go to cyberpunk philosophy series
it wasn't totally devoid
like the original did touch upon themes that the movie and subsequent anime did
which is what it's best known for now
it was mamoru oshii and his team that took it towards that philosophical cyberpunk direction
a sort of boomerish sci fi comedy
it was more like
interestingly, the original ghost in the shell manga wasn't remotely like this
it's really good
the movie right?
but it has nana mizuki
Ghosta join the dark side and start pirating for those sweet endless free possibilities
it's been like 3 years since I saw it and I still haven't finished mopping up my brain from the floor

Or part 2 part 5 part 7 final part part 4?
Part 2 part 3 part 6 final part?
Industry slowly imploding
Goddamn it man
the entire history of battle shonen ship wars will definitely try
that has to be some sort of art in and of itself
screwing up the anime for two of the best VNs around
the utawarerumono anime also literally cut out entire characters and arcs
not an important aspect of VN adaptations anyway
and the action is solid
well you both played it so this season is better than the first one purely cos now we're where all the action is
yeah I agree
ah okay
are we talking about the anime or the games
i'm confused
apparently pretty good at what?
like somehow a much lighter version of the muvluv atmosphere
it feels like it's going for a genuine exploration of PTSD
<@152896851660505088> I'm sad, man. this season of Kancolle is so solid so it having such horrific production issues is just <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>

at least g witch gets a few breathing rooms with all the broadcast delays
the problems are getting worse every season

look at all these whippersnappers Cypher
basically the queen of yuri manga
for some early yuri manga you can also look up basically anything by milk morinaga
will always have a soft spot for strawberry panic
yuri was like my first anime genre I actively explored
basically proto-yuri
people forgot the greatness of class S and classical yuri smh
unless I'm remembering wrong
iirc isn't it just full on text?
why are you all going for the yuri *subtext* and not the yuri *text* <:GermainAngry:689199996653928451>
the comedic timing was also better in teh manga
yeah
for science and research, hilariously enough
the show I"m currently watching is zetsuen no tempest
it was fucking awesome
I was purely mid 2000s at the time, never went back to far except for fist
yeah definitely didn't see this
i probably heard of most but never saw a bunch so that's likely lol
neat I guess
yeah i remember that bit of trivia
it was like fate apo's sieg vs karna fight but without being able to blame it on interns
a thing
s2's climactic fight scene was...
oof yeah
even the early entries
it think it even looked quite nice in a lot of places
sao wasn't that bad looking imo
i think you mean inconsistent
i thought it looked familiar somehow
i'm honestly sadder about the mediocre animation in villainess commentary
reminds me of like a slightly better looking GATE
yeah animation wise it's nothing special
i almost expect something radical like somehow involving the audience in how the anime goes
i don't trust a single thing any person in this production says
way too early
too early to tell
it is so tightly tied to its medium that making it anything else would take away of what made it stand out in the first place
I hope it's like that, because that's the only way the game can be adapted
but instead veering in a *wildly* different direction from the game
as in, making us believe it's a direct one
since this is yoko taro I'm expecting this to be an "adaptation"
but that's it
Duolingo alone will teach you more
Anime is a horrible way to learn japanese
I thought it was a case of weird perspective
Oh she's just tall?

you can just pretend it doesn't exist
the less you ask about this game the better
the "embrace yourself and what you can do" but actually going all the way by doing it through its cast too
like Hugtto but on steroids
the main theme of this show is going to be crazy isn't it
100% unconventional
this is like
holy shit
The lead cure is *not* pink this time around
THere's an actual, full time boy precure
And there's now a young adult precure
so let me get this straight
but wasn't Moonlight also an adult?
holy shit it is

yooooooo star driver
<@131244146324144137> https://nyaa.si/view/1028602
yeah the subs had problems
does Heroic Age count as mecha by the way lol
sooo anything from the 70s and 80s
any mecha that has the name of the robot as the title and the main theme song repeats the name of the mecha like a thousand times
early super robots were just advertisements for toys
to be fair
the 70s and 80s
save for like
when was the last time a mecha show was *About* the robot
Code Geass hilariously became this sort of show that people who don't like mecha say they like because it's "not about the robots"
i suggest then grabbing the movie's torrent from here and then the fixed subs they put in the comments
if you're using the torrented file at least
scroll down in the comments, someone did a fix
you know it's bad when even jojo fans aren't this bad anymore

Kotoko ‚ù§
now that's an ultra specific example I can definitely stand behind
Like it can't decide what it wants to be
it feels a little...unfocused?
now I"m no music expert so I'll just say what comes naturally

What is even happening
let's go to nonsymphogear spoilers
6 hours at the most if you read slow
and fasten your seatbelt
don't stop until the credits roll
Is...is that a lot?
Alice your wallet can't take much more
Play games instead
Well obviously you can't play with gems
WHAT
WHAT
WHAT
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3AB8iHqlpLc
too bad not on psn
and now I got the scanner and need to look for 9S
just beat that giant robot that came out of the sea
hmmm
nier automata is too good
what is life
help
hope they have long blue hair in the hairstyles
which wielder do I make first hmmmm
attack on titan
with a create a character mode as well
that will be fun
also, a.o.t 2 is coming this month too
i'll put that on my watch list
was never much of a racing game player, but this series alone got me liking it
damn that was a nice game
had the third one on my ps2
oh shit i loved burnout
never been much of a Persona fan, but automata is right up my alley in all aspects so I had to get it
ps4
retail ain't dead yet fella
so managed to grab today nier automata for 40 euros instead of 70
between nier automata, tales of berseria and nioh, I got a lot
i have no shortage of games to play lol
In the rest of the world it's just 1 2 3 4
It was basically something like: Warriors Orochi 1, Warriors Orochi The Return, Warriors Orochi 2, and then now 3.
In japan the second entry wasn't called number 2
weird naming stuff
ah yes
So not only a new game, but it's coming in 2018??
And I love it to death
The third game was pretty conclusive with its plot
There was no hinting it was coming at all
One nobody expected
Nope, it's a new installment
I thought it ended with the third game, but now they're bringing in another one
Because it takes the traditional Musou formula and puts it on a huge scale as it gives floor for all the shitton of characters
It is unarguably Koei's best Musou title
Along with putting in some originals, and in the case of the third installment even had some external guest characters
It brings all the characters from both series into one setting and plotline
it's a crossover game between the Samurai and Dynasty Warriors series
Long story short

ahem, excuse my language, but...
I love this store
New AoT only for 40 euros
And there is no long hair either so cant even make a fake Basa or something
The hairstyles dont have anything remotely close to her actual hair
And that grey? Thats supposed to be white
Pretty much yes
Attempt at Miku in AOT2. Man the customization is lacking

they just play ignorant
oh they know
but her answer is pretty much "I don't know what you're talking about."
You succeed
You roll to question Maria
as if they're afraid themselves
but they just won't speak
and you try to get the other characters to fess up
It starts taking a strange turn when players start dying off
And now from a Symphogear tabletop it becomes a Horror tabletop
but Miku heard you as well
Not only you failed to flirt with Bikki
reality will find a way to smack you in the balls
to succeed, you need to roll a 21 on a d20
There is only one appropriate response
Yes but isn't tabletop about creating your own character?
Random player: "Roll for successful flirting with Hibiki."
Me: "...Roll for stabbing player in the neck."
Here's what would happen if I ever played a Symphogear tabletop:
But what was the storyyyyy
Bajillion Noise on the screen at once
With nice graphics and musou gameplay
A solid home console one
We really need a Symphogear game
I tried making Miku cos she was the only one you could come close to making
The closest I got to putting a Gear character anywhere is in AOT2
"You wake up with a relic in your left nipple, what do you do?"
The campaign
Whats the story
Like
how
No but
found it
ibu I think it was you who had the image
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
But it's 70e
Well im in Germany and i found a retail version
Whattt?
Super robot wars X in english???

<@!302063351767498752> try Nox emulator
what the heck did you guys play
and competitors try to use some of the hype, but until now not a single one managed to bring even a half decent product
right now, only 2 BR games make headlines
it's not like the competitors are even good
thing is
why are companies trying to compete with Fortnite? It's impossible. It's dominating the battle royale market so completely even PUBG is barely managing
https://gamerant.com/the-culling-2-launch-xaviant-games-future/
It was wayyyy harder than I thought
tried to make the Gears in it
so I started playing Samurai Warriors 4 Empires
Kirika
The "attempt" at Maria
We can do it again with a different character if you want
Ah shucks, thanks everyone
this is why they always make swimsuit events with only girls
because they go for what make money
you can only be meta-evil
but they'll never be mean to their retainers
closest thing is executing all captured officers or constantly dropping your reputation
meaning you can't actually be completely evil or crazy
is that all the custom characters have the same personality
Problem is...
I need to make her first, but it's possible
