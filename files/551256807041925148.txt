to be fair i died like 5 times when i first played that level
but can tsubasa handle the bayonetta bike
me and a few others were discussing the potential for a server-wide fanfic writing collab for the 28 possible symphogear pairings (between the main 6 + miku + kanade) and it seems like it could be fun
i guess every participant could be randomly assigned 1 or 2 pairings, and they could all be made into one unified collection on ao3 or something similar, and then at the end there'd be one fic for each pairing
it seems like a cool idea so i thought i'd pose it here to see what everyone else and the staff thinks
<:MikuBliss:336657233712513024>
yesss
now make one where both of them are hugging the heart 👀
i think they're saying that you can either rewatch it on your own, or watch it with others here at the scheduled time
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
is there a way to only let people talk in the server if they type "i will not click suspicious links" daily
do not click on any links
they do not contain free candy
then is pan infinite gay
yes
top tier name
"dr. ver best girl"
~~someone put an ip grabber link in chat and show this wannabe how it's done~~
apply to be server owner
i can't because being a redditor and a discord mod would make me too powerful for this realm
what
literally 1984
lets make elfnein bot a mod
<:MariaScared:672584661125431299>
and it creates the possibility of people discussing crypto

thanks!
hello
just needed some time away from discord
thanks
~~first time not writing about gear in 4 months~~
hello 👀
i wrote a nanofate fanfic, and i thought i'd put it here if anyone's interested since i know there's a few lyrical nanoha fans in this server
https://archiveofourown.org/works/37031725
kirika and dess
canaan 👀
also, i would not mind being pinged for tsubachris if you're up for it 👀
just noticed that their pendants are touching
that's really cute ~~and gay~~
^
👀
i would ship ver x solomon's cane but anything else is too cursed for me
ships between the gear users, i'll clarify
and no i haven't
symphogear is one of those rare cases where i can get behind any ship pretty much
hibichris is great too imo 👀
i will die on the tsubachris hill
<:ChrisAwe:672579889685069889>
i don't know the ping list but this artist's twitter is almost entirely tsubachris for anyone interested

oh my god this actually works perfectly with them
<:MikuBliss:336657233712513024>
i agree
wish they interacted a little more in the show
i honestly might end up writing for that ship with how much i write chris
it is a good ship
i honestly never considered the ship until i saw the art

art of lesbian couples and their science/magic children are to die for imo

<:MikuBliss:336657233712513024>
i'll read this later tonight, thanks 👀
do you have it uploaded somewhere
ooh?
even though i can count the number of shippers in the world on one hand, probably
hibibasa intrigues me, i will say that
i also really like the very uncommon chris/miku
bayonet good <:MikuJoy:738234684655403110>
<:ChrisHappy:660870796696223744>
chris x any gear user good
what
is it gay to kiss your senpai's armed gear?
not all that bad, surprisingly
oho 👀
<:KanadeAngry:672861874966233118>
who doesn't like eevee 👀
oh look it's miku's room
it's a bit saddening ~~but that's what fanfic and fanart is for 👀~~
there's lots of potential but they barely talk
but maria grew on me over time and the flicking in xv won me over
exactly
whereas tsubasa and chris had 2 whole seasons together and some pretty prominent scenes
what bothered me was that we didn't get to see tsubasa and maria's relationship initially develop, gx comes around and they're suddenly close

my heart
<:MikuBliss:336657233712513024><:MikuBliss:336657233712513024><:MikuBliss:336657233712513024>

the text in the blue circles translates to "soft drink" if i'm not mistaken
it might have to do with it being the only alcoholic one

put on your coat and your gloves and go touch the grass
~~should go play a better fire emblem game instead~~
people are still fighting over rhea vs edelgard 3 years later?
the gay mod will come one day

yes
and could have called maria out on saying being abused was fine
chris would have been the perfect one to send with maria seeing as she could relate
and it was with elfnein of all people
could have been done with better writing and planning

their faces <:MikuBliss:336657233712513024>
ahh it looks like they also did a hibimiku
you are the maria enjoyer, so im not surprised you knew

i only remember the very first and very last fight in axz
cagliostro approves
tachibana hibiki *will* steal your girl
i will ship nearly anything so why not
ok
i have played a claw machine only once and i won
fun fact
gungnir must give them the urge to scream
ahh
hmm
never really considered hibiki/maria though
lmao
i missed the mikuchris 👀
the background is so pretty there
her butt is her butt
<:MikuBliss:336657233712513024> <:MikuBliss:336657233712513024>
sorry im very tired today
shit
ooh, very cool sword
the chris with no gatling gun <:ChrisShock:620077681484103680>
here's something cute
foot and toothbrush torture
especially the backgrounds
these are so pretty
madohomu <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
but does tsubasa have the high ground
<@!441981795429384202>
love that image
this is gold
<:MikuCute:672908542763859968>
<:MikuWhoa:670502684692054042>
shirabe really doesn't like hibiki's hand
ooo
buff mountain climber lady
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
oh <@!222517038042710017> would probably like this
sounds about right
lots of cute hibimiku at source
saddening
ahh, the person who was making those and the old spice videos stopped uploading 3 years ago
"tachibana, smoking this makes my training sessions much more vivid! would you care for some?"
for sure
<:MariaScared:672584661125431299>
she's doing the
nehushtan miku 
<@456226577798135808>
girl with cool weapon thing
oo
<@!331908049822547978>
have some cute stuff of them on hand actually 👀
tsubachris <:HibikiGay:670494484701773845>
if you have two hands then why not pat two heads
very cute 👀
yeah those two
havent watched it in years
probably just these two
was the first yuri i ever watched
fantastic
i love sakura trick
i guess the fans must have wished on their lucky star
das antihero senki zesshou symphogear discord?
need <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
chris x au chris x christina
i want art of that
chris harem 👀
~~and the most wives~~
<:TsubasaDere:768545990495961129>
i saw that on pixiv earlier and its so pretty
<:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
can't believe chris traded in her gatlings for something so basic, this is so sad
it kinda does yeah
america moment
i will keep my eyes peeled for you bestie
hibimiku posting makes me smile like a gay idiot
maria posting makes me think she pretty
both are different and appreciated in my eyes
3_skip
the only logical explanation with my incredible detective skills
these "group chats" are definitely just underground nft drug rings
>implying tsubachris isnt a main pairing
maybe id join a tsubachris one
ahh then nevermind
if there's an open space then i guess i wouldn't mind
you have successfully converted me
well they all are but that's what grabbed most of my attention
the first one and all the suit ones are really really nice
same artist maybe?
i saw one similar to that focused on kanade
3_skip enjoy my very small edit
very cute but also very sad knowing the parallel
3_skip yes
she doesn't know what to do about maria staring at her like that
so i guess there's a 4 year window
7zip apparently came out in 99
the only valid reason to use winrar is if you were on like windows 95
understandable
thank god
winrar???
kanade knows what's important i see
never all four
it's all tsubamarichris or tsubamarikana
please do
<@!441981795429384202>  lots of kanade
fuck im gay
my name's gonna be orange if you keep this up
<@!250295696714891285> das found some cool looking pictures of you
kanade is fantastic
and xdu has only fueled the artists and writers
kanade and lilith are going to have a great time im sure
there it is
yeeeesss
im imagining hibiki standing there with tsubasa cheering her on now
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
<:TsubasaFish:689163064830066696>
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
marichris AND shiramiku???
going to write more about them one day
marichris makes me very happy
<:ChrisHappy:660870796696223744>
hamster
<:HibikiTired:422925410490253313>
minerva!
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
i could see hibiki offering tsubasa a hug though, but only on days where miku feels like sharing
chris can offer a bullet in the back
i say as i sneeze for the 200th time today
nooo their poor noses
kaneko: no :)
<:MikuCute:672908542763859968>
the wep special would have been much better if they just shared an omelette made out of the wonder eggs and just did tropey slice of life things
honestly though
<:KirikaPog:605209108827734017>
might need to read the light novels soon
i really liked it
this is such a big brain combination
toriko and kirika have the same VA
oh my god wait
i did not expect this crossover in a million years but i love it
don't know if i posted this here before but i really like this
you will have to be more specific
there are a lot of those
love this color swap
<@!331908049822547978>

how about miku and maria
yes
<:ChrisEmbarrassed:738167509869527060> <:MikuKiss:738240587014340649>
kanade and tomosato
one of the few times i think the art style was great
the season 1 x drives looked soft and almost pastel-like, in a way
3_skip

there is a story behind this image going untold
cute dresses
<:MikuWhoa:670502684692054042>
for some reason, nanofate remains the cutest pairing ever in my mind
<:MikuCute:672908542763859968>
rip homura

best moms


think ill join in on all the nanoha posting
lmao
<:MikuBliss:336657233712513024>
yes 👀
just a few more days
yessss
i love this
me too but i guess i dug my own grave here
is that why he's the mom now
<:MariaScared:672584661125431299>
everything's all fun and cute until he eats one of them
this one as well as the author of the tsubachris one you posted are writers i really look up to
love this one
<:MikuCute:672908542763859968><:MikuCute:672908542763859968><:MikuCute:672908542763859968>
**hey!**
hibimari time
it is a generic anime cat girl
no
didn't know tsubasa could flirt
👀
all this nanoha posting is great
<@!441981795429384202>  heterochromia
who is she
i agree
the kids wondering why aunt maria has such long "sleepovers" with their moms
"hey senpai, your daughters call me mommy too"
tsubasa would probably be something formal like "mother"
chris is definitely mommy imo
some of the new characters are growing on me a little bit so that's a good sign i think
yeah ill give those a try too
all this recent nanoha posting was the one thing that got me to continue watching strikers, in all honesty
<:MikuCute:672908542763859968>
everyone likes chris
or anyone really
or miku
or hibiki
<:MikuCute:672908542763859968>
not sure who what is but sounds kinda cringe
who's the guy
<:KirikaShout:607741871703457812>
sounds convenient
oh no jake has become друг
you'er a giant boob
what
<:KirikaSmug:607742561414676517>

oh so maria does have a slight edge
not even the rooster or the zenboobs can compare i guess
oh my god
i think you should read some of these if you need some cursed inspiration
theres so many shrek and dream smp crossovers specifically with teletubbies
thought we were in fancontent
fuck
why are there so many

<:MariaScared:672584661125431299>
im afraid to ask because it's you, but i'm also curious
oh?
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
everyone is allowed to have 1 piece of ash
yes
want
watching this right now actually 👀
tsubasa is the one taking the photo
<:HibikiGay:670494484701773845>
literally my favorite pairing ever i think
the colors are so pretty

<:TsubasaFish:689163064830066696>
a sword must be flat and aerodynamic
makes sense, seems a little weird to me that tsubasa is listed as bigger than miku
boob sizing is actually really weird and complicated
i guess?
please

the first yuri i ever watched 👀
no regrets in finishing nanoha
vivid strike was really good
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
fuuka!
i have no idea
is it gay to create 4 girlfriends for yourself?


good
no you
<@441981795429384202> lots of kanade

still need to watch that
she pretty
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
so cute
yes
they feel too much like mother and daughters to me
except for maria and the zababies
or, better yet, ascend to my level and ship all the gears with each other
i ship her with miku which is much more baseless
what is happening here
would love to be that sapphic that learns smithing just to make her wife a proposal sword
<:HibikiGay:670494484701773845>
excellent work
the file name has me dead lmfao
ooh very cool
<:MikuCry:688397678584791074>
tsubahibi??? 👀
mine will be better
for now
art with normal bust sizes is cool
i want to have that one day if i'm in a good spot
same <:MikuCute:672908542763859968>
<:HibikiGay:670494484701773845>
i honestly can't tell
is this supposed to be fate on the right or did shirabe dye her hair

cute
i don't think it's before anyones time that's still alive
i mean the first meme ever made was in 1921 so
wanna see some epic me mes?

<:MariaScared:672584661125431299>
gonna make you watch that with me one day
im referencing a nanoha meme
(shoot to kill if male)
whereas vivid strike was actually exciting
the fights were just really boring since half the time random characters were fighting
if you really want to watch vivid then just turn it off when fate leaves lmao
is the manga even finished
from what i hear, one of sayaka's transformations in magia record referenced mai-otome?
should probably finish that
i only watched like half of mai-hime but i can kinda see what you mean
mmm
~~nanoha always has a divine buster ready when einhardt comes over~~
oh and you could probably skip vivid since it's so bad but be sure to watch vivid strike

nanofate best moms
i know ;-;
yes
yes this one
watching season 2 and the second movie is a good idea though
you should only skip season 1 since it's pretty rough around the edges and watch the first movie instead
i think every symphogear fan should give it a try
because there's lots of parallels
im 99% convinced that the symphogear creators must have watched nanoha
maria/miku though 👀
~~i could see this becoming super cursed fanfic material if you took some inspiration from jail in nanoha strikers~~
<:MariaScared:672584661125431299>
insert miku into the maria/ver ship then 👀
polyamory very cool
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
hee ho
some of them have things you can use to help you walk if you don't know how

as you should be
that sounds cool
homo animals
and considering they're literally humans in every way other than the horse ears and tail
the definition implies there are human animals and nonhuman animals
they are human-like horses
3_skip nope
kanade and gold ship are in love and happily married
yes
3_skip will put this here too but here's the actual actual relationship chart
give her the love

i think i've only done gorod and origins lmao
c:
i think i got him killed by grabbing the max in the boss fight by accident
or was that revelations
all i remember is purple juggernog and dying all the time
i think when he did gorod krovi i just put my controller down and did something else
unless i have the mk2 i will have 30 downs
i'm good on mouse and keyboard but i suck on controller haha
doing spaceland tonight
we just did the origins ee yesterday
but he is genuinely good at zombies
me neither
no you won't die if you fall from the bouncy platforms

is that a thing
maybe ill learn how to hand forge it
thinking about actually bringing a sword to my wedding when i get married
thats mega gay
i guess you could watch it standalone but i think it helps to at least watch nanoha s1 through 3
vivid strike
so many times i've wished characters in anime would talk to each other more, and this one did it
literally the best part of the show
youre right
😳
is there anything gayer than beating each other up for 2 and a half episodes and talking about your feelings?
<:MikuCute:672908542763859968><:MikuCute:672908542763859968>
