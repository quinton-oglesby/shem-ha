here's the ost in question for reference
https://youtu.be/rex4zJ-p6Rk?t=35
so i'm watching mouretsu pirates when a certain part of the ost catches my ear
it's only about 4 seconds long, but i thought "huh i recognize that"
it's the first verse of the superb song
fucking agematsu i swear to god
and then the sequel
i think i'll watch rondo rondo rondo first
<:kagetoracrunch:775453650117853195>
oh gReAt
god i need a drink
||"IT WAS YOU, AUSTIN"||
||"IT WAS YOU ALL ALONGGGGG"||
<a:woewasi:928111528484421632>
like seriously
the entire time, we're like ||"what the fuck is a giraffe doing here"||
and then that happens
dear GOD
it's 3am, i wasn't ready for this
i am in shambles
<:sadcat:455102404845633546>
can't wait to watch the movies for a second dose
and for some reason, the ||4th wall-break by the giraffe in episode 12|| hit me like a fucking freight train

forgot who exactly kept posting revue starlight memes, but thanks to you i watched it and i hate you
now that i just finished the tv series, i'm in fucking tears
<:jesus:501378973830217739>
banana is a god
the weak should fear the strong
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
when she was first introduced: "haha banana motif and puns"
episode 7 onwards: "please no"
i have gained an irrational fear of bananas now
<:jesus:501378973830217739>
yeah i was half worried the next episode was gonna be a repeat
absolutely terrifying
like jesus christ ||how long has she been doing this||
episodes 1, 7, and 12 must be my top 3 in no particular order
1 because it captivated me
7 because banana development was terrifying
12 because AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
episode 7 might be one of my favorites just for developing banana
back on the topic of banana and episode 7
i noticed in the ending song sequence that ||in that last pan downwards across the main cast, it looks like nana's carrying/shouldering everyone except karen and hikari||
not sure if it was intentional, but episode 7 made me connect some dots and it was mildly terrifying
it's 4 in the morning and i'm still trying to process that show
maybe after i wake up
not that it was sad
i was just overcome with emotions
first time i cried because of an anime in a while
my head hurts now <:exucry:938684219180331048>
sounds like you need to rewatch it
episode 7 had me going "this is not a certified bananice moment gET ME OUT OF HERE"
<:bananice:934590989153210398>
still can't get over the fact that her name is a homonym for big banana
really minor and silly but i loved it
7 -> nana
also they did a pun with the episode number and banana's name and that tickled me
speaking of banana, fucking episode 7 good god
pretty sure i was aware there was going to be something extra
i don't quite remember, but i think i knew it wasn't going to just be girls on stage doing their thing
the first duel had me absolutely enraptured
not sure
either the duet or the very first one
still recovering from revue starlight
fUCK
yeah that's kinda what i'm expecting
a lot of big names are working on it, so people have big expectations for it
<:ChrisPray:672578403156885504>
FUCKING GIRAFFE
i hate this
<:NotLikeFist:689188869974786133>
thanks to ||that fucking fourth wall break|| i just realized that, in rewatching the first episode like 4 times because it was so captivating, ||i was just following nana's mistake||
well yeah, it has to have been
i mean, how else would she ||have her perfect recreation of the 99th seisho festival||
only bananas now
<:AAAAAAAAAAAAA:455102404640112672>
IT'S EVERYWHERE
the purplish-pink gleam of the star tiara is present in so many shots what the FUCK AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
<:NotLikeJunna:636922044138913802>
holy shit i'm-
<:NotLikeKaren:636922043715026945>
*oh my fucking god*
i think i found it
gib link
exhibit a:
i have a thing for singing, battling lesbians
i'll experience it in due time
shush shush
later
so what the FUCK is it gonna do to the series for me
i still haven't watched the movie
up there with kemono friends and sora no woto for me
revue starlight has become one of my few unironic 10/10 anime
banana is an eldritch horror from beyond that we cannot fathom
i've never been more afraid of bananas
<:sweat:488456042364141578>
the brief look of surprise when the teacher announces a transfer student
<a:NotLikeNade:870791012631609425>
like jesus these shots and lines are horrifying in hindsight <:monkaGiga:585595799027712004>
<:HotBanana:702834870430334977>
<a:Bananaisu:476011303916273674>
each of her lines fills me with an existential dread
watching revue starlight episode 1 is making me notice these shots that linger on nana more and now i'm terrified of bananas again
i fucking HATE giraffes bro
how dare they do this to me
i fucking hate singing lesbians now
i am a broken mess
i am IN TEARS
WHAT THE FUCKKKKKKK
I FUVKING **BROKE** WHEN THEY ||DID THE FUCKING FOURTH WALL BREAK **AGAIN**||
I FINALLY FUCKING WATCHED THE MOVIE AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
partly because i already purged my memory of it all
and partly because i'll notice new things upon a rewatch
i feel the urge to rewatch the series and movie again
wait
reading the summary on the revue starlight wiki
apparently rondo ||previews/foreshadows some of the stuff that's in the sequel movie||
<:AdamScream:688241618356404224>
still can't get over the fact that ||the pink glimmer is fucking EVERYWHERE in EVERY DAMN SHOT||
"supporting character"
yeah ok

apparently it has a bit of extra footage, so i thought it might be worth a try
should i watch rondo
||especially when the train car fucking launched itself||
also the mad max part was funny
||KAREN WHY DID YOU HAVE TO DO THAT||
back to having a breakdown about the movie for me
i rate revue starlight a bana/nice
like on one hand, i love banana-chan
on the other... ||damn girl, she fuckin SCARY||
joined the ranks of kemono friends, kino no tabi, and sora no woto
welp anyway
revue starlight and its movie are now among my few unironic 10/10s on my anilist
like damn, i thought ||you were over this by now, banana||
||the part where she just fucking MURDERS the girls made me gasp||
it was hilarious in the moment, but ||banana was still absolutely terrifying in almost every appearance||
||bananas still fill me with dread||
I WAKARIMUST
AAAAAAAAAAAA
I DON'T WANT TO WAKARIMASU
slightly unrelated, but
||WHEN THE TRAIN TRACK TURNED INTO THE TOWER AS IT RAMPED UP||
GOD FUCKING DAMMIT
||AND THEN THE PART WITH THE GALAXY SHIT BEHIND IT||
||AND THEN IT FUCKING BURSTING INTO FLAME||
THAT FUCKING THING
GOD
i fucking HATE giraffes now
but towards the end, i ||started fearing the tomatos||
it started off with me fucking cackling at the ||tomato just exploding out of nowhere, immediately followed by a dramatic musical sting||
god i was screaming every 10 fucking minutes for that movie
i definitely recommend wearing headphones
i watched it on my laptop with headphones
i love it
gayest shit i've ever seen
BRO
I FUCKING PREDICTED THE ||"FOR ME, THERE IS YOU" LINE CHANGE||
i swear, going from heartcatch precure to fucking revue starlight broke my goddamn spine with the tonal whiplash
me, after watching this wretched fucking movie
fuck
i need a hard drink
i think the movie works best if you just finished the series/rondo
<:KirikaCry:674720015047720961>
