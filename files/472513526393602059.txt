genocide?
I wonder if we can get something like that
which gives a random image based on an emote/word trigger
we have a bot
On another server
It really is fun
Just bots
Well it shouldnt trigger everywhere
thats what was done in the other server
Confine it to bots
Need? nah. But it is still nice imo
Anyway, if it's not something appreciated, I won't do it
Kinda like waifu wars
Well it's not an actual judgement?
It's supposed to be a stupid argument with no substance behind it, in which both sides are being facetious
Overdone?
Sorry
Lol
~~let the heretics suffer~~
Ayyy
Dmjii
There we go
Lmao
The last one
Can be anger tho it was a blush
From the new shinai
New crying emote, if cropped
<:PadoruKirika:648642932135428096>
Nevah enough geah
We need more geah
~~the sword that shall impale you~~
Like a voluntary thing where people can put up their preferred pronouns
Thoughts?
Like, she, he, them, any
There was a thing in another server where people could self assign pronoun roles
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
Where is the total
<:KirikaPanic:644235681677180958>
Wait no there is only him
There is only me
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
There is only you
Wait no
So there is only me
<@203444794737950720> choo mean our?
We are each other
Seconded
<:TsubasaBliss:672861879000891432>
Lol
All good
I know it can be disabled
It's actually rather anxiety inducing, the announcement thing
(didn't mean that one, I meant the boost notif in <#336297387863703552>, but eh, it's been forgotten already, so all good)
Can you delete the notification?
There you go
:(
Thenks
Smh

13$
3 boosts
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
~~in the ennnnd~~
~~I can traumatize my mathematician friend with it~~
Seems like it
Is it a past tense?
It's an odd phrase tbh
Yeh
Ask saki for help maybe?
~~is that a reference to the image quality?~~
Okay this i like
~~milaarc~~
<:ShirabeCheer:671887003414954005>
(only pinging so it doesn't get lost in the emote storms)
<@106866895076003840>
Probably need to update the rules and info for the channels, lots of new faces and some confusion.
Lv3 goddamn
This is amazing
Holy wow that's a lot
100 slots
Them emoted
Holy wow
<:TsubasaFish:689163064830066696>
This is highkey amazing
God there is an emote for literally everything now
<a:MariaSparkle:688839288082792462>
3 days
That was *fast*
<:blobsweat:352986325575663626> <:blobsweat:352986325575663626>
250 be the limit
<a:MikuQuake:605209236082786355>
~~just like canon~~
The ghost of the padorus
Anyway
*1 boost
The former is what I assume
hmm
cuz if I see no role, imma just outright ask, assuming that they have forgotten or are unaware
It would be nice to have a confirmation
(Like lec, for example, he doesnt wish to be referred to as "they")
and to differentiate between those who *do* have a specific preference
Easier to have a single role for it
and want to make it clear that any pronoun is fine
A suggestion: an "Any" pronoun role for those who don't wish to express a particular preference?
These 2 complement each other well

Truth
Its something I participate in only when I know everyone and the fact that they aren't attached enough totheir waifus to take any mock insult made personally
if you dont find it fun it isn't fun
and isnt really fun otherwise
and waifu wars only work if everyone knows its a meme
All the girls are great
No waifu channels
Sorry
Unintentional
>.>
Hmm yeah
Alright
Modding*
A legitimate fear is the vents channel turning extremely toxic and needing excessive middling
So am not sure how useful it may be
But the place where it is implemented has far more level minded people in general
Separates the salt out further
Whereas those who wish to discuss contentious topics in a civil manner have a separate place to do so
So people who want to vent about their day for example can do so
Not sure how useful it may be here
A separation of serious debate and serious vents
Something that was implemented in another place
Do dm me if/when you reach a decision, even if negative, just so that I know. (just, info, not to argue about it)
is why I suggested it here
It's something I have seen used in other places
fair
Hmmm probably
I mean, I would end up choosing one and sticking to it out if a desire for internal consistency
Which I *think* can be done in <#336297840529899522>?
Unless you are talking about academic discussion
Enough freedom to express, not enough to be abused
I dunno, I think it's a good thing that explicit kink talk and horny talk are lowkey discouraged without being outright banned
It's a server of 2.2k people
Like, it's not only a small group of known people
Like, joking and Joshing is fine, but explicit kink talk can be done in DMs or more private spaces
I sorta think that it shouldn't be encouraged here? Not because its bad, but because the server is fairly large?
<:ShemHaWhat:727010581722431499>
Lol
<:shinobuwu:588588702541021197>
alright
In keeping conflicts and misunderstandings down
I have seen it being very effective
Hmm
and public
membership of 800
I have seen it in smaller servers
Better to channel it
hmm
When I say vents, its more like, looking for support rather than feedback on the thought
Hmm
People *do* vent in <#336297840529899522> a fair bit
Sure. that happens in <#336297840529899522> as well
so...hmm
Not necessarily Lily, part of the problem lies in the currentrly it is used for discussion as well
It isnt actually rare, people talk in <#336297840529899522> for support about half the time
hmm
Oops?
>.>
Last time my fear was that a vents channel would require excessive modding
Oh right
and that distinction will make it clear
Like. Sometimes people don't *want* to discuss, just want support
Can we separate <#336297840529899522> into a vents channel and into a discussion channel?
I am fairly sure that it never is hostile, moderating
most anything can aria, sadly
At least for you, for now
>.>
hmm
More of something (for lack of a better description) a safe word? of sorts?
I was not suggesting a bot
A simple non-confrontational warning system?
But, Aria's suggestion holds merit?
and yeah, folks also self moderate a fair bit here
thats not the problem
Mods intervene
You are getting heeated mate
like
more off, friendly...
Not really authority
(we are not blaming you aria. Just thinking of ways such that people don't get that heated or dont get that frustrated)
but I feel it would have been more effective if it were clear that the intent wasnt to discuss the problem
I don't want to stop her
more DMJiii
LOL
To prevent the spark from jumping
Lol nice
yep yep
LOL
AAA
moderation issues was the response if I remember correctly
Ooof I have been inactive here way too long
....I remember now
Wait
Why not separate Vents and Support from <#336297840529899522>
I know it's been a while, but I had a suggestion to make
Hey!
hello
Ayy chiki
gimme a sec lemme read the rules
Well three are from the index server
Who is that
That's not kande
Wait no
But it's nice
Give her more expression and we have a Kanade emote
<:MikuBliss:336657233712513024>

<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
I disassociate
<:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
Not much disturbs me, but the warning be appreciated
Eh tis okay, I usually wouldn't care, just people were next to me
~~never~~
Should have opened in private
That's okay, tis my fault
First two results were nsfw
Should have been a wee bit more careful before opening that lmfao
I shall start diving
Hmm hmm
I dunno, I have been brought up to be vary of too much virtual interaction
Hmm Hmmm
<:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
Thus I shall live vicariously through you
It puts me off
I tend to avoid the media places
😰
So much
(I also am not someone who uses social networking apps in general, and surf the net very less)
She has commands for searching?
Hmmm?
Esp since I dunno where to search for good art
This makes my day
Love you lots
Lmao
Amongst men
Kerrik you are a god
Oof
Nice
Damn that is Wallpaper worthy
That pic is deffo worth it
That last one
Oh fuck

The basa/Chris in yukata that akeupho was tagged in
Yes
Bikki being straight is legit weird
Thank you
LOL
Its just easier for me to relate to is all
Hidoi
<:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
I like straight romance dammit, its easier for me to relate to <:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
baht y
??
since she is the most likely to be straight amongst them all
Probably Chris with someone
I want one straight pairing tho
gay is good
oof
<:HibikiAAA:620079684109205534>
heh
~~just as it should be~~
Kerrik drowning us in love
apparently they were guys too
yeh
nice
Agreed
this is discrimination
Hidoi
<:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
Ogawa comes off as an older brother to the gears
just very very weak
but possible
ogawa X basa doesnt seem all that likely either to me
and there are only hints of Maria X Basa
but only two sets are confirmed pairs
jokes aside, there really isnt anyone i see as a likely male prospect
cursed
fujitaka?
like they are all way too old and havent shown any real interest
imma block yo ass'
huh i am trying so hard and there really isnt one
no
so theres that
well there are no male chars to ship any o the girls with
<:ChrisSmile:336656717553074176>
the rest are 100% gay and thats how it should be
a 50-50 for chris, 80-20 for the other two
they are the only ones I see as possibly straight
Chris, basa, Maria
I completely agree
So good
OH man
Nice
Railgun art
indeed
<:CarolSmug:617040484111745027>
Maria X Chriss
They seem more like colleagues who just respect each other
I dont see Basa X Maria tbh
Like
also that is a pair i wouldnt mind seeing more of
lol
see this is good
any art of them with anyone other than each other is cursed
any straight art of them and hibimiku is just straight up cursed
they are meant for each other
i honestly wouldnt
nah
<:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
posting the one of the two ships that I cant argue against
rady noooo
like, it would be nice if it were treated semi-realistically
that honestly sounds like a good story

Why is bikki saying ohayo de arimasu?

It would have so much potential
Why just the two of them

It's badly written imo
Yeh it's hard to read
The index LNs?
I thought you had an eye condition that didn't allow you to read much lol
Dont*

Lol

Wanna see it? <@203444794737950720>
Very well done
Regarding Mikoto
A friend of mine wrote some rather..... Interesting literature
Mikoto's hair is a lighter brown
Hair color is off tho
It is
On that note, I sleep
*heresy*
Heresy rady
Followed by accel
Overall I think it's Mikoto followed by kirika
From that series
Followed by accel and touma
She is my favorite character
Lol
Yes
She is short hair
Like
It doesn't fit her tho
Yes

I just ssaw this

Eh, not best for me, but one I certainly enjoyed
Time for ep 2
Well the rest is history
The I watched ep 1 of G
I almost dropped it after S1
I actually was the same
Its not logical, discussion destroys it
This, honestly, is not a series I would discuss tbh
~~that's good~~
just as XV was ending
I started at the perfect time didnt I
I do not no
time constraints
I have to wtch a few eps at a time
I wont be able to binge tho
It must have killed you
stopping after this sort of high
Holy crap
I can imagine so
before I watched some more
I needed to vent a little
I liveblog elsewhere, my usual set of fans were asleep/inactive
It's muted, worry not
worry not
I entered here fully aware
Eh I wont be around much, mostly to vent excitement
so many throwbacks to S1
Goddamn tho, Hibiki's new transformation
It will be a good end imo
I am in a perpetual state of HYPE
lol
Heavensrend
Pavaria
Commie subs tho
So glad I persevered past S1
been watching Symphogear over the past 2 weeks
ep 2 is downloading
I just watched ep1 lol
I am only being slowed by my lack of net
Ayyy I will be done by then
Don't want to spoil for others
This is the right place yeah?
I will end up occasionally popping in to went sheer excitement
okay it was just very very very good
AHHHHHHH
THE ACTION
THE EPIC SONG
THE NEW TRANSFOPRMATION
HOLY SHIT
EPISODE 1 WAS SO HYPE
HOLY FUCK
FUCK
AHHHHH
They actually resolved all the poorly done daddy issues from GX
I am crying
XV so good
are fucking out of this world
The transformations
and I like your name
Lies and slander
Lies\
nani
Ooof. That must be ~~pleasurable~~ painful
rekt
BANG
Sealed some emotion I guess
It did something to Tsubasa
I will find out I guess
Yeah but what did it *do*
Regret?
Anger?
And what did she seal into Tsubasa?
Fucking
Milaarc
Not Elsa
For once, well executed edge but OUCH
OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOF
Oof
Ep2 was
<:GWpingKanyeLUL:395627394876178453>
thanks
What's her name?
Kirika and Shirabe vs new girl was just 👌
Wow the action took a *huge* uptick from AXZ to XV
DEEEEEESSS
Byeee
Okay later
Yes LOL
Had to take a break at that point
I downright hate Nastasha and the way they tried to make her child abuse look good
there were too many moments that legit upset me
Heh
AHH
The dance
So pretty omg
Shirabes transformation tho
Lmfao
None of the girls are flirty in any way
It doesn't mesh with her personality
Thank God
Smh
Rashikunai dess
Edge or not, I just can't see any of the symphogear girls really *pole dancing* like that
Completely clashes with her personality tbh
Like.... It was ultra weird
I really wish Kirika's transformation were a little less.... Suggestive?
Hot damn
Thus far, XV is trumping G as my most favorite season of symphogear
Ma heart
<:GWinfxCry:363337570048016384>
<:GWinfxCry:363337570048016384>
The pain begins
Done with XV
So most of it is saved for the actual seroes
I have rather limited data
I haven't listened to the music yet
Not yet
I really love how XV brought that into focus
because it is all internal struggles and conflicts
Most of her character develops off-screen
especially Tsubasa
Symphogear has a lot of hidden, unexplored depth
Rather she isnt a warrior
imo
And yeah, Hibiki is not a fighter
So pretty
This moment tho, in tsubasa's transformation
heh
AND IT LOOKS SO AMAZING
where she rush transforms
ep12 transform
tsubasa is a close second
AND THE SCREAM-RUSH TRANSFORM
OMG HIBIKI
HIBIKI
ikr
It would have fit more on maria
that was just weird
felt completely OOC
The only quibble I probably have is Kirika's transfornation
IT WAS SO AWESOME
I can understand why
AHHH
CAROL
X-drives
imo ep8-9 hit the absolute peak of hype
I expected a transformation *sometime* but not like that
Yes
SO MUCH HYPE
SO MANY THROWBACKS
I died a few times in pure bliss
AND THE TRANSFORMATIONS
AHHHHHHHH
It has never been this great before
Oh *God* the action
Storyboard
Characterizaation
Action
Animation
In so many ways
Its just so...clean!
XV was the best gift to fans I have ever seen
The entirety if XV is done so orgasmically well
<@231492516820680704> an index reader?
Holy
Heh
of cute geahs
Is the pinnacle
Zesshoushinai
but yesh
Basa needs professional counselling tbf
nani
~~and I rarely notice pfps~~
Just making sure lol
But the spoken was all very easy and simple tbh
Well I always switched in during the kanji
With klk
I assume you meant kill LA kill
It was hilarious
I watched it without subs
And many complex words
Lots of formal language by Tsubasa
S1 of gear gave me a hard time actually
I switch off cr subs most of the time
All the time
I suck at reading
Well spoken Japanese at least
~~I understand Jap well enough to not need to read lyrics~~
Life is good with more symphogear
Well the entirety if the songs and osts from s1-4 are waiting to DL
Nyaaa
<:HibiMikuCry:586026583870013455>

Hobby or not, guns are fucking dangerous
Or in active military service
Unless you are a hunter, a policeman, or a veteran
Why... Would you need a gun... At all?
Calling it one is moronic
A gun isn't a defensive weapon
I approve
Oh serious discussion channel
I dunno, where I live, civilians aren't allowed to own guns unless they get a liscene, and getting one isn't easy.
You need more restrictions. Guns ain't toys.
/shrug
That isn't happening innit
Truly dangerous stuff like cocaine
I am not talking weed
And not distributed as freely as guns
Yet they are *restricted*
A gun is equally, and even more viscerally so
Cmon man, you restrict drugs on the basis that they are dangerous
Not on terms of guns
I mean it's a visible problem
So regulate it?
Not gonna be easily fixed because it was allowed to grow so much out of control in the first place tbh
:/
I just cannot comprehend everyone having a gun just because it's cool
I can understand someone who is fearing for their life owning a gun
That's the thing, underground exists regardless.
A lot more
It means that you need to clamp doen
That doesn't justify it
And goes into the public sphere
While shooting in a range is fine, the problem is the gun leaves the range
Well
The reason why it's usually the state employees are the ones who are allowed to use guns is because there are always restrictions in place to make them accountable for every shot fired.
Which is not possible for a private user.
Alright
Why would *anyone* outside of the armed forces need an assault rifle
And if you are going to a range why would you need an *assault rifle*
It's just too easy to misuse
Not really?
Ummm
So that means there are literally hundreds of parties
And we don't have a bipartisan system
It's insane
If American politics is as complicated as say...a calculator, Indian politics would be an i7 processor
It's massively complicated
Be glad
Yep
Lmao I be in the single biggest democracy in the world
What's conservative to one person is radical to another
Due to the huge cultural diversity
To anyone
Where I live it's hard to apply such definitions
Well
That is so difficult to comprehend for me
Wow
Interesting
Ah
Okay
Ah
?
And social groups
Like there are so many religions around
<@279341087494242304> there isn't just one set of those either....
Okay
Ah
There are millions
Yes but which traditions
Mind you I only have a vague caricature of what a conservative Christian is
What does conservative mean in this context
Ah
Ah one leans towards policy that support more individual freedoms
Complete individuality would be anarchy
I mean
Imkean5
Sort of?
Those aren't mutually exclusive
🤔
Impossible to be left or right tbh, population is just too diverse
Like.... India doesn't have much of a left or right, both major national parties being centrist
In the states that is
What is left and right
Later
Ugh
And the NRA is trying to spread gun culture
And on top of that, guns aren't sold casually
Ahhh
Narratives?
Philosophy is fun
Lmao
I challenge you to try to understand Indian politics
Gg
Lmao
For everyone
Last good news I had was that instant divorce priveliges enjoyed by Muslim men in India were criminalized
Well
Brexit seems like a complete mess
Lol
But at the same time there it is also not possible to keep the old status quo
It isn't right
It's much more understandable from an Indian context
Hmmm
And given our nation has a history of like 75 years...
6 full terms
*30 years*
It's been 30 years since we had a non-coalition govt
Like I said
Not at all
Not so over here
So many parties hold rather decisive portions of power
Just because they are the largest doesn't mean that they are the only important ones reee
Ik that feel
Like hindu-Muslim relations isn't easy to explain in the context of India
Yeah
Hmm?
Yep
And is nowhere near as simple as "hindus crushing the Muslim state"
It has a lot of depth that is just impossible to explain
But
Yep
Kashmir?
India
Yeah our second national party basically killed itself
Our current govt is the first non coalition since 1987
You cannot make a non-coalition government
It's actually a meme here lol
The state parties control about 30% of the parliament
Even now, despite the leading party having about 60% of the seats
Like the small parties together control 1/3rd of the parliament
~~still has no idea what to make of it~~
Ah
I do not know who Jeremy Corbyn is
To me they be too pictures of a guy
Hm?
||you may not like me saying this, but there are many many humanitarian crisis going on around the world and yet we are all sitting here commenting from afar. People have far more immediate problems than distant battles, severe as it may be||
and well....all I can say is that humanity is inherently selfish and self-centered?
Curd, curds
Its a words for yogurt
Cuz...curds is something else
*kurds
Just fanning flanes
No context
I hate articles like that
It isn't a *necessity*
Guns have no use beyond being a weapon
The car comparison is poor
Mostly law enforcement carry handguns in Europe
Mhmm
I mean, I think we agree
Thus, regulation
They are useful tools, but they still are primarily powerful weapons
I didn't say guns should be *banned*
I agree
I never said it was not regulated, it's just not regulated enough
I know that you have to have a liscence and stuff to buy a gun, and it isn't a simple process to begin with
Which was the point I was trying to make, not that any kid could lift a gun from Walmart
Also, <@256945399338631168> the very fact that it is available in such a widespread manner is a problem imo
Just don't go overboard with it
If it helps, pay attention to your surroudings, small stuff that will help you increase your sense of security
So astolfo, just stay calm, and do small things to help you calm down maybe
Sorry, it got diverted
Hmm
Okay?
And snide
And you are being overly defensive
I am aware that it isn't as simple as picking it up and walking out
Sure.
I don't need proof, I trust your word
/shrug
Not well enough if you can sell them openly on Walmart
Sure. And they are all regulated in some way
Not something a civilian should even need
Point is, it has no use beyond violence in some form. Some justified usages, like hunting, and in the case of police and military, a part of their jobs.
Not as a tool to dig
And in a hunt it is used *as a weapon*
What do want to hunt in school
Really?
In school?
What is it
Really?
It has a use beyond it
Yes, but a car is not primarily a weapon
This power and responsibility lies with the staff.
And as (I am assuming) a student, you really can't do anything about such jokes, as you have no power over a student population
You honestly shouldn't take their words seriously
They don't realize the true horror of it
That said, they have a point, being scared all the time won't help you
Just saying, bad comparison
True
Carrying a gun is not
Sure and drunk driving is crime
Sorry
They*
Well yeah, he is scared because people can bring guns
Unlike a car
Or ex-army
It isn't looked upon favorably unless you are police
Like... Over here, if you have a gun, you are either a veteran, or you are someone gearing up for some serious shit
I mean....I could get a gun and have it completely undocumented pretty damn easily
Reported or unreported
And we don't have anything close to this
Where laws are like paper
I live in India
I mean
I mean, guns should be last resort anyway
And yeah, that makes sense
Lol
It's *hard* to use a gun in a crime anonymously
Because of the regulations in place
And well, every bullet shot is easily traceable
Free speech != free of consequence speech
Coolgamerdude was an idiot.
Welp
Grammar is so easy tho lol
Japanese is a fun language to learn, tho reading is hard
Yep yep
As a Japanese term
Imo
Best
Bishonen works the besg
Sorry sorry
The ko in 巫女 reads differently when paired with 男
<@263983345669505025> that just reads wrong
I tend to watch anime raw
(I do know Japanese to an extent, though me reading is weak)
What's the Kanji fo this?
Ahh different kanji
That's just male child
Alright
Specifically, extremely feminine looking male characters which can be appealing to a straight male
I usually use it to refer to anime characters, not real people
I don't
Also, future note, I have limited exposure to western culture so there are probably Going to be moments like this where I ask questions about stuff that people take for granted
Apologies if I upset you
I had just never thought about it in that manner
Sure
I don't
Well I know more now, so I won't use it as much
I did not know it was used in that specific way
Trap is to me, just a very feminine looking guy
That I did not know
Okay
Ah
Why is the word trap itself insensitive tho
The meme itself
That's just unfunny
I do not know what the meme in question was
Since it usually applies to an anime trope, and not to real people, I asked the question
Simple
It is not something that occoured to me
Not attacking or saying you shouldn't feel hurt
That's all
I am trying to understand the thought behind it
Sarcasm not really appreciated
Hi
May I ask why?
Traps are an insensitive term?
And what slur was not used
Or insensitive
And why it was offensive
<@102691114762371072> may I ask what meme was deleted?
Hmmm.
I am going to say something controversial, so before I say it, I want to make it clear that I personally do not enjoy the sexualization of young characters which is quite prevalent in anime.


So while countries regulating such content within their countries is fine to me, attempting to force Japan to do the same through a UN resolution over something so minor really bugged me
?
Not just in anime
Because young appearing adults are a thing
Agreed
Instead it was vague as all hl
I can understand if they said: banning of creation and distribution of art depicting minors in sexually explicit material, with a full definition of what is a minor
<@168183302300237824> the thing is, the resolution was bloody vague when it came to what art was not allowable.
tmi?
what be the difference if I may ask?
I mean, I usually tend towards porn in which the female's pleasure is made the primary purpose
~~because many straight guys also like to consume lesbian porn~~
Its actually amusing
Yeah...over here girls legit cringe at the mention of porn
is what I have percieved
~~also straight men are more direct with their thirst~~
Yeah
Parents on my side were definitely *conservative* but were quite open to discussion
Well....ouch is all I can say
oof?
well
big big difference
They don't like it being trivialized
Huh they don't hat sex
Always have, its fun to discuss opinions with them
As in, they leave me to my devices
(they don't actually regulate? they just entertain the discussions)
Go find a girlfriend/boyfriend you idiot
Yeah, parents be like, but *why*
LOL
As in, the discussion started there
The discussion veered from nudity and into porn
They are
The actual comment came about when we were discussing Nudity in GoT
I don't fully agree, but it did make sense
The justification?
That it is vouyeurictic in nature and shouldn't be encouraged
<@!246146781832806401> my parents actually gave a rather interesting resaoning for their dislike for porn, which legit made sense
it was far too vague
What exactly constitutes art that should be banned
<@!476058996315389953> My problem was that the terms were poorly defined
as in....
Hmm I am not able to put it in words myself
They seem confused themselves. Because what is available doesn't fit
Nice hair
Oh face reveal
Hmm hmm
Problem is trans people themselves (the ones I have talked to at least) don't fully understand how it is?
or it's difficult to explain to a cis person
if I may ask
what are those?
?
I yearn for the day that it is completely normal tbh
And I completely support you
It just is?
Nowhere to go
?
hmm hmm
Can I ask if you are homosexual?
fun stuff
It usually involves quite a lot of foreplay
It is
yeah
quite fun too
it's slow usually
lol true
That is sad kanade anon
Huh
I actually prefer a story in which sex, rather than being the point, is used as a tool to further the plot
There are some with super long stiry arcs
doujins are nice yeah
Hmm
adulting is a lie
<:GWjojoJotaroSweat:363025412105830420>
3 day weekedn
LOL
They should be given the support to explore it properly instead of being spat upon and abused.
LOL
No no, that isn't what I meant by confused
I mean, I don't get why it's so hard to just...address them by what they want to be addressed as
But acceptance should come first
So needs to be explored a lot more
But some who are very confused
I mean, I have met some who are really decisive
Hmmm
LOL
Welp
:/
Hmmm why are people dicks to trans people tho?
I sorta understand the hate towards gay people, because apparently the bible says its a sin? (Not too sure, have never actually read a bible)
Is there something similar about trans people?
y tho?
I haven't met anyone truly narcissistic
True
~~don't we all~~
Wait....
Saying "I panicked cuz the person was trans/gay" is an actual defense (even if never successfully used)
Ah well
Hmm
Hmm
Hmm
How different is narcissism from being an Incel?
I mean... Sure
Lol
Like, it takes no real effort to be nice
But... That's just sad
That's just sad
Is that the only reason people are nice?
I have generally been brought up to understand that nothing is absolute and everything is POV
Well...
Interesting.
Huh
To see the other pov?
Isn't that the point of a debate?
Ah
But damn are they one of the best conversational partners I have ever had
We never ended up agreeing at all
Rather
An *antitheist*
Like, the most civil discussions I have ever had have been about religion with an atheist
It's as simple as that
Rather, what you need is the mindset that your thoughts are not the only way of looking at the world
<@189146272865845248> I disagree rather strongly with the statement that you'd need 90% agreement to have a civil discussion
Huh that makes sense
Lol
Loo
2:45
Well
Ooo wow it's 3 am
Fair
Even emotionally doesn't make sense
Well logic aside
*cue dark night theme*
Ah well
Like what purpose does it serve...
But why?
China has too much money
The very thought seems fundamentally wrong
Even if you could you shouldn't
Even if it was a choice it is wrong
Disregarding the fact that it is not a choice but the way you are born
That's so dumb
.............
Shouldn't have deleted the wut tho
So makes perfect sense
I said wut
Conversion sounds ominous in general
Conversion camps?
Hooah
like how on earth do you represent the sheer diversity
America's two party system always struck me as very narrow
Hmm
cats are E V I L
Agreed
Yep
In a democratic system
not representing the various diverse cultures
Thats just sad
But...
Lol
DETERMINATION TO FIST!
You will fist your way to glory
GANBAREEE!
This was so weird to backread lmao
So...I would kill for someone who is just quietly competent
They don't supress, but they rarely speak in support of them
and then the current government has...questionable views on minorities?
I think
another 27 billion
And then coal gate
42 billion $
its legit bigger than 1MDB
its mind boggling
and just see the figures
look up 2G spectrum scam
Okay, in India, the givt before this one had major corruption scandals
Quiet as in...
Hmm
Just.....quietly successful
I mean from a controversy POV
Why can't our leaders be like her
Merkel is such a *quiet* leader
anyway, moving on
hmm
Also, regarding how it got out of hand earlier...
well i have seen serious discussion being used in another place, and well...I dunno, I have never seen it get so out of hand
Just...live your life.
it just is
or anything
or a building collapse
you could be killed by a car
And well, in the end, ig you do want to go by that logic, life itself is a risk
I very seriously doubt that whatever causes the shootings is actually *hatred*, unless it is bigotry or a very personal feud that got out of hand
<@!302063351767498752> You are being overly paranoid. You may not be able to help it, but you should try to mitigate it.
You should probably read more about the students who did shoot up schools. It will help you understand their behaviours. I doubt it would be *completely* random, there mist have been something stressing out the poor kids
wew lad
that got toxic really quickly
We just don't have data about it
Can't be worse than China
Really weird
Excellence is an expectation
Anyway, based on my short experience with it.... It's weird
I backread
I've heard a lot of bad things about Japanese work culture
They seem to be feeding into each other
Both the environment around you and your mental state
I hope it gets better man
That's... Just sad, and also worrying.
Like every kid here hates school but no one feels this unsafe
That's... Ouch
:/
I would be stressed too
I can see why that would be stressful
Ah
At least, it isn't here
But your info is not going to the police is it?
I understand mistrust about the police
As in
You don't even know what you are scared of?
??
So, don't think so hard
Though memeing aside, as someone who i assume living in the states, your institutions are relatively really strong
People are just not motivated enough to do stupid shit
I trust in the inherent laziness of humanity
Unified cashless payment interface being one of them
Used as the basis of a lot of shit
Issued by the central govt
Biometrically linked unique numbers
And India has a voluntary ID card system
Ration cards
Tax numbers
But everyone has *some* form of ID
Same here
For voting
How can you not have ID proof?
Being the most common forms of ID proof
Drivers liscence, Aadhar card, passport, PAN
Which can be created at the ballot upon provision of valid ID proof, which is any state or central govt issued ID card
In India, you need a voter ID
It has two parts
It's controlled by a real person?
X has cast their vote basically
Your identity is verified
Before you enter the booth
No
Lol
Not on the machine
It's not any faster than a paper vote
Read up on it if you are interetsed
Like I said
Of course it is
The vote itself is anonymous
I'm essentiality, it is an electronic ballot box, and is far more difficult to tamper with because it requires specialist knowledge
Voter verifiable paper trail
And since 2013, you get a paper receipt too
You'd have to tamper with millions of them to gain any sort of significant margin
By design
Again
And an EVM can only count like 3.8k votes
Those are not really related to EVMs?
Well
It verifies the identify based on fingerprint recognition
It's finger prints locked
And you can't stuff a machine with votes
^
Than to use... Well something that cannot be influenced?
The only way to actually tamper with those things is to open it up and change its hardware
It's far easier to commit fraud using people
Read up on it
It's in fact far less risky
Not really
Far far cheaper
It's cheaper than hiring millions of people to count the vote
Yep
And shows the result on a 7 segment display
It's a counter
Read up on it if you are interested
It's local
On the machine itself?
For the candidate you are voting for
Registers a vote
By design
Nor do they have data ports
The machines have no networking capabilities
Instead of paper, you press a button
And cast your vote
You have to go the ballot office
The vote is still physical
Oh n9
They have been introduced in a phased manner since the 90s, and all elections since '04 have had only electronic ballots
@ <@284390402210136064>
The EVMs used in India
Read up on it
In contrast, the population of the US, incidentally the third most populous country in the world is 350 million
With 600 million actually casting their votes
And yeah... The last general election in India had 900 million registered voters
You can only physically tamper with them, and even that would require some expert knowledge
They are basically closed systems
As in
They are too low tech
Well not really?
I mean... How hard is it to make a chip with 4 choices
?
They don't have EVMs
So EVMs are definitely implementable (though I would hesitate to call them superior, it only reduces post processing costs)
And since the number of votes per machine is limited, you'd immediately know if there was some sort of fraud cuz there can't be more votes than there are machines
2 standard 9v Batteries
The machines here run on a 9v alkaline battery
And many of the more remote places don't have that
A plug point
Like
Problem with that is that the machine would require a power source
Sure that would work too
Hmm
They aren't large enough to warrant electronic voting
Municipal elections are still paper
And the machine can only display the results, not transfer them
And once the vote is done, the machines are sealed and kept under guard
Thus the paper trail
The only thing they found that they could do was to steal the actual machine and open it up and tamper with its hardware. And in this case they were provided with the machine cuz well, they were testing it
There was a team that tried to test the security of the EVM
So you can't just tamper with one, you'd have to tamper with thousands
Also, each EVM registers a maximum of 3800 votes
That

The party symbol
A serial number plus the image of the party you voted for
So you have a paper trail for verification
Hmm no, it's a bit of both.
You press a button.
And when you do, a paper slip is also printed, which is displayed on a sealed windowed screen to the voter
The machine is treated *exactly* like a ballot box, they don't take the results with a USB, you literally can't
The machines themselves are produced not by co traced third parties but by public sector, government run companies
There is little to no software on the machine itself, and what little is there open source
You can't post your votes online
The man in the video clearly hasn't looked into successful voting systems implementing EVMs
In a country with an electorate the size of India, it not only makes sense, it is actually necessary
Yes it essentially is a complex counting machine, which is the *point*
All of the things this guy is talking about has been thought of and addressed
Reprogammable*
And it's *not* reprogtammable.
It's an electronic ballot box
This isn't electronic voting
Seriously. You guys have the wrong idea
It took a lot of time and effort
Yes
Yed
Lmao
The roll of slips is stored for cross verification purposes if the integrity of the EVM is questioned
So there is a windowed machine.
When a person casts a vote.
The machine prints a small slip which is displayed on the macuone so that the voter knows that their vote has been registered for the candidate that they pressed the button for.
Ummm
The voter doesn't get to take it home
On it
That paper doesn't have a name
OK?
It can only count and display the results when asked to
The machine itself doesn't have the capability to register names
It prints a serial number
It doesn't have a name
And memory
The thing is purposefully designed to be as prehistoric as possible when it comes to communication tech
And locks it again once the vote is registered
So when someone verifies their identity at the entrance of the booth, the polling officer opens the machine to accept a vote
The control unit is used to lock and unlock the machine
Connected by a 5 m cable
The actual ballot unit and a control unit
It like the entire company is run by incels
Yeah lol
The entire gaming industry is rotting
They are a soulless money sucking machine yeah
I mean that would be fucking awesome
Whose stories can be used as an inspiration
And there are *plenty* of awesome women in history
Don't do it
So don't
Seamlessly integrated into the story
All of these people
It's just *there*
I love stories which... Just don't make a big deal
The idea
It's moronic
Like actually write a good story which casually includes all these people instead of doing a half hearted job
Just slap a woman or a gay couple  on for "progressive"
A hypocrites solution
Like..

It doesn't address the problem
I don't like that
Which details a world in which cybernetics are commom
It has a fanfic
If any of you have watched mahou shoujo madoka magica
Huh
So the government
Matrix level management too
Non core worlds
Because it is in interesting outlook on the topic
Hey that was the point lol
Lived*
You have to have loved at least 100 years on it
To. Leave earth
And well
And it's not all roses
Yep
Upset by the war
It is this super complex balance
There don't seem to be classes
That's the thing
The colonies are still capitalist
Yeaht
Just super efficient resource distribution
Not out of nothing
Oh yeah, AIs are considered sentients on their own right
Which is not a sentient
Every military guy has a taccomp
Only the upper stadf
Most
Not lost
The works
Functional immortality, general physical enhancement, cortical implants
No
The capitalist system doesn't exist anymore
So in the universe detailed, humanity on earth lives in a utopia, in which every human has a standard cybernetic package, and does exactly what they want.
Let me elaborate
It's a bit complex
Ah sec
Project eden was online waaay before thag
In the timeline
But magic was revealed only 20 years ago
It seems very *plausible* in relation to how the world in the story developed but still
Is such a thing even possible?
I found the supposed utopia detailed in it interesting
It was such an odd story
*everyone*
In the point of time that the fic is at, everyone gets a standard cybernetic package
Before I got derailed
<@189146272865845248>
Which is why I was talking about it here
I was talking about how it explored the question of cybernetics and the morality of it
Anyway!
Gah I hate phone keyboards
Hours&
And the first 24 hot s were sorta important?
I never noticed
Is it that long?
Anyway, point is, it is a world in which cybernetics is common
Infodump*
And it's better than a direct infodumo
That's Fair to me
More than the characters, it's the universe that they are building
Given the depth and scope of it
It has to be
Yes of course
It details the history behind its development too
And it's very *interesting*
We will have a new baseline smell
We'd get used to it
With a narrower and narrower margin of error
Regarding how unstable it keeps getting
Which he made
I loved the analysis
We don't have the energy for a City
Where are my damn megapolises
Hoover damm
7.7 is the estimate yeah
Okay no
We have definitely crossed 8
<:GWinfxCry:363337570048016384>
(we are pretty close to that already)
(though asimov assumed 8 billion was not sustainable)
Classiest society
This is a more realistic world
Another book that deals with the economics of a huge population : caves of steel by Isaac asimov
Centuries ahead
Like I said
Yeah that's true
Centuries*
Literally
This is snetiries ahead
Course not
In my eyes it's as close to utopia as possible
I am wondering how feasible this one scenario is
Eh perfect is not possible
After having lived a significant amount of time on earth
And depends on people wanting to leave
It is not a perfect utopia
It's pretty close to that
Is run by AI- human hybrids
That's not the point tho
And well, it's easy to interpret it from density per area
Alright, thanks aria, sorry about the question
Regarding density, density per unit volume, while sensible, is not required, as there is a lot of up, not not as much area to build on
(sorry for the off topic, I was curious)
Out of curiousty, how exactly does aspergers manifest for you, if you don't mind me asking? (you are free to baldly
 say no) 
I read a little on Wikipedia, but I tend not to trust it over actual people.
Mass which is not already a part of it
To the system
You are adding masd
Because if you are getting materials off planet
Why wouldn't they?
No it's a super developed real planet
Yes, and if that happened, how would it affect the orbit of the planet
No oceans
There is no non-city surface
It's a city planet
Did the import of off-planet material affect the mass of the planet
Where did the material for that level if construction come from?
From star wars
Take coruscant for example
I am articulating this poorly
So after a certain point, as cities grow larger, where will the material come from
You are redistributing the mass on the planet basically
As in
Where does the material come from
Brings me to a question
All this talk about building up
You know
Because other than city centers, vertical building is not that common beyond a couple of floors
Population isn't dense enough to warrant calculation by volume
Actually I have another
Yep
But predicting it is something else
True
S C I E N C E
Just curious as to how they'd do that
Yeah I know I know
It wasn't just area but depth
Living on the surface is considered to be a luxury
It's a *city planet*
It's not a corporate, it was just an excuse used by Britain to gain superiority in India
British east India is a poor example
But I have heard it happening in Africa.
Mind you, it's not necessarily completely exploitative
Because I have not looked into it well enough
No
A specific one?
Regardless of the wishes of the populace and the government
It means that the corporation directs the policy decisions of the country
There are many cou tries effectively owned by corporations that are richer and better run than the local govt
A lot?
That's happened?
Umm
hmm
I mean, christians celebrate it, but they are like, a tiny portion of the pop
Christmas isnt a big thing here
I researched my holidays
22nd*
24th is the solstice not 25th
Really?
huh
Ah
what even is Halloween?
Halloween is a christian Holiday, and not everywhere is christian
to be fair
Well
regardless, person was stupid for posting on the internet
So maybe it makes sense in the context
Well
We don't really know the context, do we
Or guy
Poor lady
capture the market
like
<@279341087494242304> making money, sure, but long term planning means even more money
Gaming
Hollywood
So many big industries seem to be drowning in greedy people trying to make short term gains
third most populous in the world
the US pop is 350 million
thats about 400 millionm
30% of Indians are vegetarian, for example
32 million is approx 10% of the US population
India
its funny how tiny percentages translate to huge actual numbers over here lol
approx
32 million peeps
still thats a significant number
like....2.3% of the population over here is Christian
More or less
It's what I have been taught my entire life
I agree
Though from the way I understand it, Christian values hinge on belief
It means you are a person that follows Christian values
But that doesn't mean you are Christian
That is true
No you don't
While differing on the details
And most religions espouse similar basic sets of moral values
It's like saying "Oh, that's a nice car, now how about I use it without its engine"
Its like the central aspect of it all
Yep
Christianity, Islam, the way I understand it, belief in God is central to being a good person
It's explicitly said so isn't it?
It is tho
And that they affect you in ways you may or may not understand
Hmmm set of values is not religion.
That way, atheism is a 'religion'.
Religion, to me, hinges on faith in the existence of powers beyond your understanding
Non-existence
Nasthika it's called
Like, atheism has been a part of India for centuries now
That's the thing, the acceptance of an almighty power isn't really central to Hinduism
Hmmm
It's all upto you, no unquestionable athourity defining what's right and what's wrong
There isn't much binding it as a religion as such
It's extremely decentralized
I do not know
Mhmm
Pretty accurate actually
Lol
Wikipedia definition.
Hinduism includes a diversity of ideas on spirituality and traditions, but has no ecclesiastical order, no unquestionable religious authorities, no governing body, no prophet(s) nor any binding holy book; Hindus can choose to be polytheistic, pantheistic, panentheistic, pandeistic, henotheistic, monotheistic, monistic, agnostic, atheistic or humanist.[4
I've been told that Hinduism barely qualifies as a religion
Of which the personifications are part of
For the collective whole
That's pretty much it yeah
Hindus just have a name for existence
I am not familiar with it
<@143129446046498816> what is the concept of kami?
Like the beings depicted in Hinduism are personifications of specific aspects of creation
It's not capable of judgement or anything, because it's not a being
It's the universe and everything in it, and it just is
In Hinduism, there is a concept of ishvara.
It isn't a being, or anything with any sort of consciousness
god*
Regarding the discussion of God above
It's very confusing
Like, they read inconsistently to me, sometimes as male, other times as female
And the few gender fluid people I have talked to... Are legitimately that
I understand that it exists, but it's hard to conceptualize
Who don't identify with either of the standard gender identities, regardless of biological gender
Specifically gender fluid people
There are some aspects of trans people I don't understand tho
Gay people don't exist lol
Generalizing anything too much is bad
Which is bad
They are generalizing all males
That's still not nice
Lol
People who don't reason, who say utterly stupid things thinking about it, who are anti male rather than pro female
Yeah
Terf sounds even worse lol
I don't like radical feminism on its own
That sounds toxic as all fuck
What's a terf
?
Right
While*
You can't say you are pro LGBT whole rejecting it's central value
I think radykjo meant to say, it's like someone saying they are pro LGBT, but are against homosexuality
Despite the wide variance in interpretation
I am saying that Christianity doesn't allow for that level of flexibility
Like, the details differ, yes, and the interpretations of the Bible
With Jesus being his son
Yes, but both of them still believe in God as a being
Well yeah, because Christianity by its very nature is gatekeepy
Rather below
Not that one, the one above
Clarify?
Yeah I am talking to you only rakhi, your statement confused me
Confused
I am Confised
I mean it would be nice if it were like that
<@284390402210136064> people aren't that open minded. If there was no gate keeping, evangelism wouldn't even exist.
People wouldn't be bothered to convert
Lol
True
Lol
All of them
Not really, fluids adhere to the shapes of their containers
It's a more generic classification than liquid
So plasma is also a fluid
~~fluid refers to anything that can flow~~
~~gas is a fluid~~
That's the point innit
Yes but solids remain the same regardless of the vessel
I ought to sleep
Wew lad
3:10 AM
Unless they specify otherwise
I just refer to them as they
Mhmm
It's 😖 😖
Yeh
😖 😖
I be like
So everyone refers to them by different ones and it's super inconsistent
Especially since they be like meh towards pronouns
It's really confusing
They be real, I know a few of them
*shudders*
And it's not like it's whimsy, it just is
It keeps changing, that's what's confusing
Because they know what they are
I can understand non-binary identities tko
That's what I am talking about
Current has different definitions based on the context it is used in
Not really?
Not as easily changeable
And are more widely accepted
But some terms are defined more concretely than others
Yeah
Fluid doesn't mean different things in colloquial and scientific for example
It's different types of communication, not different languages
Right
So when I say fluid in a scientific paper, it means a very specific, agreed upon thing
It's nowhere near as specific as legalese
Terms are defined in academia
Because *that* is removal of subtext
If you say legalese is a different language, I'd agree
Its not removal of subtext
So if you use a new word or term, you have to define it
You can't be vague in academia
Academia is more specific is all
Not really no
If there is, could someone guide me towards a credible reference regarding it
I was asking if there is any specific, accepted theory regarding that
Heh
Or yes
I didn't read it properly my bad
Yeah not necessarily
Wait no
There are many who just don't
But that only addresses those who explicitly identify with male or female
How it relates to biological gender, if it does at all
Like, what causes a person to identify with a particular gender
Ummm
I am not able to really find anything half way reliable, and I do not have enough of an understanding of it to be able to judge whether what I am reading is credible or accurate
Out of curiosity, is there any commonly accepted model for gender identity?
Why does nothing make sense anymore
Like where did all the js come from
For me
It was so very confusing
Lol
In general capitals are for DC and common for AC
i specifically refers to alternating currents actually
Yes that's true attacker
Lmfao
Pfft
But flow of electricity in electrical
Currents refer to fluid flow in mechanics
Exposure will break my perceptions
That's good
Like is said, openly trans people just aren't that common here
I have been trying to refer to people by they tho
I would automatically refer to you as male >.<
Huh
Doesn't help that I haven't actually met trans people except over the internet, it's just not very common here for people to be openly trans or gay
Takes time
<@102691114762371072> I know it doesn't, but the associations are still there for me, and it's hard to over write them
It just is
No no, not assigning blame lol
It was very odd calling someone who looked female as male (they haven't had any surgery yet)
I also noted that when I found out he was afab, it took me a while to adjust my view
It is yeah
It is yeah
Sometimes comes off as male, other times as female
And there is a genderfluod person who reads very inconsistently
Same in other places, I know an ftm guy, and if he hadn't told me, I wouldn't have guessed that he was afab
Like, for example, saki here always read as female to me
If that's what makes you happy, sure.
Also, in general, I have noticed that people who are trans come off as their preferred gender when speaking online
Hmm
True
Ah
Huh
Really??
Can't go around assuming that it's bad
There is so much we don't know
Isn't that a given?
Most people are fine when I make it clear that I am only trying to understand
I will learn through exposure
Ah well
Actions
Not curiosity
Ah no
Leaves me floundering and awkward, I don't know what exactly is insensitive/upsetting for them when I do it
It makes it hard to empathize with properly
>.<
Especially here, when it deals with people
It's mildly frustrating to me.
I don't like not understanding stuff properly.
And I had to kill that thought with the info I have now
Because just now, my first thought was "that sounds like being straight with extra steps"
I can see how that would be confusing
Why do people have a thing against Trans people?
I get gay people getting hostile stares(mainly cuz I hear that it's a sin in the Bible), but I don't think there is anything in the Bible about trans peeps?
.....
Still rude to stare
Well it's not normalized yet innit
>.<
Bathrooms are typically only male/female
Thats another thing.....
Passing is no real measure of it anyway
Well there are perfectly cis people who have mannerisms that typically are of the opposutr gender
?
Based on my read of you in conversation
Like, tbh, if you b hadn't told me that you were amab, I wouldn't have even noticed
Mhmm
It will change over time
It's just preconceived notions on my part
Over time
That's a relationship?
Much easier
It's easier over the net imo is all
Sure
A'ight
Getting back to the topic, <@302063351767498752> while your concern is commendable, pushing it upon them is not. Inform them that it's possible, and then it's upto them
A fully virtual relationship is weird to me
I dunno, I need a physical aspect
And a person leaving irl is not *as* easy as over the net
It's just... Too easy
A relationship over the net
Imo
It's far more tenuous
Yes but how is it possible to have that level of trust for someone who can break of connections with just a button
Heh
Like other than friendship
How can you be in a relationship with someone you never meet?
Chatting apps I assume is what they meant
And... Well relationship over just chat protocols is so weird to me
Thats on them
Which is also technically against discord TOS
And well.... Not to put a too fine point on it, you have servers that share Loli porn which don't get banned
I would block you if you were being that pushy about it...
The chat is private
Yeh
So if it's in dms they won't even notice unless one of the participants reported it
I thought it only acts of someone gets reported
I didn't think it did?
Discord has passive surveillance?
Ummm
just all that good karma hitting you in the right spot
worry not
it isnt
Hmm hmm
But when it does come up, I don't want it to come off as being judgemental or attacking
Well I wouldn't ask unless it came up
Lol
Disconnects from gender
But preference seems better
I would have asked, are you gay or straight
Okay no, that's deffo not what I had in mind
Tf
Are you one of those gays
It's something I'd want to clarify before saying anything more
Like for example, when talking about relationships
Not out of the blue lol
Hmm thanks
Second seems better
Knowing what the person likes/dislikes
For me, it's mostly clarification
I don't want to come off as being judgemental and stuff, I just want to know
On a related note, what is a polite way to ask someone if they are gay?
Like. All the words I know seem to have a negative context attached to them
Forms a large aspect of the relationship
It's just comforting to have that physical presence
Harder to support physically
Hmm hmm
I don't understand it, but I can respect it
I agree
Sure
That's all I can say
It's not something I can do
Alright
That*
It can start way, sure
Not saying there isn't multiple aspects to a relationship, but having a relationship purely through online forums, never having met, doesn't seem to be a commited relationship
That it is
The one that broke it off
Well if it was that easy to break off, the party wasn't that commited
Not luving
Like... How is a date a relationship
Baht y?
No reactions perms?
Hmm hmm
See
Anyway, dun worry too much about it
Cuz talking helps
interesting
🤔
Chris is a good girl yeah
start debating with someone aggravating
meh you just don't have enough peeps disagreeing with you
is it hibikis bday
That is so sad
:/
I mean, some just can't, so you leave them be
And if they can be reconciled
And seeing what the base difference is
It's not about agreement or disagreement, it's airing of opinions
It's easier for me when not involved emotionally is all
/shrug
It's never good to go into on emotionally, you will never reach a resolution that way
If I see myself getting emotionally involved I stop and go away for a bit
I tend to detach myself when in an argument
Oof
Ah
I rarely get that emotionally involved
Worst case, I agree to disagree
Different Povs are just that
Like, it always is academic in my case....
I probably don't have experiences with heated debates then
Well
Hmm
That happens quite a lot
In a succinct way
Someone expresses a thought you are trying to express
Like
Not really...
It's not about votes
Hmm
Like people getting shit out of their system and people starting debates
You probably can separate serious rants and debates...
Hmmmm
....
But how do you display agreement?
Well reactions aren't always for jokes
Oof
Well part of being intimate with someone is them being able to understand you a lot better.
You will get over it as you get exposed to the opposing opinion more
Twas a joke.
Anyway, it's probably the association with sex and bad which uou said your family has
For future reference, my preferred pronoun is he <@209536346413465600>
~~you basically brozobe everyone~~
That's weird
Ah
Right?
It's something intimate and you prefer that it be treated as such
I completely get that
<@302063351767498752> you don't like the casualness with which it is approached
This turned into something a lot more fun than expected
5rue
Rather than the physical aspects of it
The author concentrates more on the mental aspect
The description isn't all that deep?
Sure
At all?
It doesn't actually go into description?
It's actually relatively tame?
It's how that world is
Melua*
Melia?
Not really?
And relationships and porn are very different?
And I am not even trying to justify it
Porn is not justified
In which the Soceity is different
It's a universe
Game of thrones is a good example actually
Now if a universe Is being twisted around to provide a justification for a specific situation, I agree that is very much wrong
Applying laws that have formed over the past century or so to a story?
Like
And the universe in context is *also* important
That's..
Not right
But describing a relationship between two minors, especially imaginary ones is not really weird or even wrong?
Extremes are bad everywhere
But descriptions of a relationship between imaginary characters in a different universe?
And should be treated seriously in those cases
Legality is between real, consenting people
14 and 20 is weird as all hell
14 and 16 is not really outside the normal?
Also imaginary ones?
(I would like to point out, teenage characters, and relationships happen at that age?)
Okay
Nor do I take anything it says seriously at all
I don't really see it in the same light
Just pointing out
Not justifying it
The latter is more important I feel
And is created in a culture that really isn't upto date with western perceptions?
It's a show that isn't meant to be taken seriously?
........
Right, it was presented as a negative thing in that world <@456226577798135808>
Something *existing* in a world is not wrong, the way it is *presented* matters
14-16 is pretty normal?
Like was the relationship toxic? Described in way too much detail?
Without going into *why* it was yikes
Why I am saying this is because, up there, when someone brought up megumin and Kazuma, they were like, yikes
In the end, context *matters*
(in referemce to the video linked above)
Or the full, piece by peice dismemberment of a human in vivid, graphic detail
I did say that presentation is important. 
For example, take Vinland saga. 
Now in vinland saga, the world is a violent place. Raiding and rape is commonplace. 
However the author chooses not to focus on those aspects of it, instead showing it peripherally. 
It would be weird and wrong if he dedicated entire pages to describing a rape scene which isnt relevant at all
I wasmt talking about trans phobia there, I was talking about the relationship between megumin and kazuma
Sorry I got derailed
It's not
Yes, and when something is written for an adult audience, you'd expect them to be able to detach
What age you should read it at
That's why everything has restrictions
They aren't detached completely
Sure
Or things to be learnt
There are no lessons there
That's the *point*
But... It's not real.
.
Ah sorry
Why would you apply critical context based on an unrelated world
Exactly
Did I ever say it was?
But it happened
It's not right
It's history
In real life
And quite often too
And arranged marriages between 14 and 30 year Olds happened?
Example*
I am giving an exole
No?
?
The way its presented? That is what needs to be scrutinized
Something *happening* is not wrong
Point is, you can have circumstances that are justified in a universe without going into too much detail about it.
So for example, you can have an arranged marriage between a 14 year old and a 30 year old.
However it's weird if you started describing their sex life in graphic vivid detail
That's not the point I am trying to make?
It is
Yes
Which is horrifying
It's something that happened
It wasn't graphic
Yes
That is not what I said
True
Hmm
Hmmm LO always registered as 8 and Komoe as 13 to me
Hmmm
Last order looks 8
Really?
She looks 13
She doesn't look 8
13 or so
Touma's teacher
Yes
Except for physically appearing to be young
She is*
Especially when she depicted as an adult in all respects
Is it wrong for a fan artist to draw lewd fanart of her?
Example: Komoe from Index.
Her body never appeared to age past 13 or so despite being nearly 30 now in the main story.
It isn't used as a justification to lewd the character in the main series, she is just one of the many characters in the story.
However, there do exist characters that appear younger than they are
Its both?
Like you can't use a thin veneer of age to justify lewding an 8 year old body
And can't be generalized
Using a thin veneer of age to justify is wrong.
However that is not always the case
That I don't belive is justified
If the author is twisting stuff around to make it not so, then they are being weird
An 8 year old body is not physically capable of supporting a physical relationship anyway
They appear 14-15 at best
Which Loli appears to be 8 and is lewded?
And 8 year old?
Thats important
Appearance is not age
But 16-18?
Not nearly as questionable to me at least
So lewding a 14 year old? I would be like, bro tf is up with you?
Not yet at least
What's an acceptable age is not universal
Anyway.
Definition of minor is also not constant.
In some perceptions its 16, others 18
Lol
With your statement
That's why is didn't agree immediately tbh
Hmm
The fact that the author chose to write the existence of something is not wrong
You misunderstand
It's biology.
Just because the body is ready does not meant one is ready to support a physical relationship
?
That's not the only aspect to it
Physically, the body can technically be ready as early as 12
Age of consent is where you are believed to be old enough to be not only physically, but mentally capable of taking decisions about your body
Yes
And pedophilia is wrong because of *people incapable of consenting* are forced into sexual situations
In all the ways that matter
In
A child ik the physical and mental sense
Because you are in the end lewding a child
Those are just....no
I don't like fanart of that either
Who are depicted as such
Like, characters who are 12 or 8
Lewding actual children is still wrong
No
Which is the main reason for why rl child pronography is downright *wrong*
Because the question of power imbalance is not a thing
But why is fanart of an adult character wrong
And it isn't used as some sort of thin veneer to lewd her in the main story
Sure, doesnt change the fact that she is an adult, and is depicted as such
Read the entire thing
If that is not true, why is it still wrong
Why is child porn wrong.
Before you get upset, I know why it is wrong, I am asking this to remind you why *exactly* it is wrong.
It is wrong because it forces people who are not physically or mentally capable of supporting sex
She is adult. I mean, she is a teacher
She ain't *acting* adult
I agree completely
It isn't
Correct?
So it's better to not encourage it
That is used as a justification by pedophiles
Not exactly
It is likely to not agree with you, just saying
Don't mikek
"fun"
Lol
If that cannot be talked about, there is nothing else to it, and I get why you are shutting it down
It honestly just defuses the argument tbh
Alright
Which is why child porn is wrong
It's not physically possible irl to have a person with a child like body be mentally mature
Age is not rooted in appearance
What Rady said actually
But people condemning it wholesale is just wrong imo
That's fine
Wyswig?
The mind takes a lot longer to mature than the body
The mental aspect being far more important imo
It's both physical and mental
But child is defined not only by physical state innit?
It isn't
Lol my mom said much the same about why she feels lewding even in fiction is not right
I see what you mean
~~an attitude my mom completely would approve of~~
That way everything lewd is illegal voyeurism
Hmm
Don't think of it from a legal pov
My bad, I still tend to default to Male when not sure, it's a a habit I am trying to break
Sorry sorry
Let the man finish
Of*
The concept is consent is what matters?
Not exactly?
Uhh
Yes
Did you actually backread all of it saki?
<:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
Oh right no reactions
Good night people, it was an interesting discussion, and I am glad it remained civil despite the contentious topic
It is now 5 am
Welp
Eh unless it's reported or if it's a partnered server, discord isn't going to find out
Better off without them then
They be there to ensure that there is no friction and trust in the maturity of the server members
Mods ain't lawyers
If there isn't a channel labeled nsfw, I assume that such material is not allowed on the server...
Why would you post nsfw in general...
Ah
So no comment
I do not know what type of person that was, and first person accounts are inherently biased
Oh
It's not something I personally find attractive tbh, but it's something that I personally feel, that in fantasy, underdeveloped bodies can be safely delinked from equally underdeveloped minds
Well some are
The one that probably stuck out to me was Hermione being represented by a black person in the cursed child.
Now I know it isn't really mentioned in the books, but there were 8 movies in which hermione was played by a white actress, movies which Rowling directly endorsed.
I havent really noticed tbh
Okay, a good example of political correctness ruining a show maybe?
Because the machines have serial numbers, so you can tell which machine comes from which place
Main concerns with Indian EVM systems are the relative ease with which voting trends can be tracked
I had a far too long conversation about it already
<@182890099183190018> read up on how it's implemented in India
/shrug
And in India, the cost of the 'expensive pencil' is very much justified due to the sheer *size* of the electorate
I have talked about this before here
It can be implemented safely
Using EVMs is not
E-voting is bad
And even *then* people are poking holes and improving the system even further
Like over here, even though the machines we use are literally unhackable and unreprogramable (you actually have to replace the hardware completely), we *still* have a paper trail, just in case.
Holy crap
All I can say is *wow*
About electronic voting in the states
I just saw a John Oliver video
Good*
But nick fury as played by Samuel Jackson was good5
I am not sure there is a good example
I dunno, any place where pc has ruined a story
Like
Not skin color per se
I am not able to think of one tbh, cuz I find that what information I have absorbed seems to be biased as hell
A good example of bad PC.....
The impression that came off to me was that she was chosen cuz she was black, not the other way round
Why was there such a big fuss over it then?
why so?
so that you can register your protest against all the candidates
None of the above
we have NOTA here
Huh
no software BS
with built in physical safeties to prevent tampering
literally an electronic counter
Cant transfer the results and all
to display the reuslts
Like it doesnt even have a screen, it uses seven segment displays
Yeah over here that common, many places just dont have power, so they are designed to run on AA batteries
Non programmable
manufactured and designed
and is manufactured by the state
and has a custom designed chip
and has the complexity of a calculator
It can only register upto 4k or so votes
The EVMs are designed to be completely unchangable lol
Over here...well
Its more expensive to implement, but cuts down post-proc *a lot*
I dunno, I like the system we use
Eh
LOL
Hand voting is also not really all that secure
Not ironically
Country that is
where are you from?
so it wont really be reliable
And its been retrofitted to be sorta unchangable
The original design that is
to be changab;e
Is designed
a tablet
I mean
LOL
They are designed to be the exact opposite in fact
They aren't designed to be unchangable
that is very insecure
machine != compter
to vote with
and trying to use computers
this is because people are being lazy
Thats actually pretty applicable
make it physically incapable of doing so
or indeed, even the capability of accepting one
Dont give it access ports or network capabilities
with as much complexity as a non-programmable scientific calculator
Its easier to just build a simple chip from scratch
Physical design is made for easily changing
Like
Its not foolproof, because they are designed to be easily wiped
like wut
using an existing computer and just...programming it with safeties
Thats just plain lazy imo
smh
For a *voting machine*
why would you use something with a *programmable memory*
it had a *harddisk*
God that is horrifying
yeh
He likes talking about issues in the states
Stand up
welp
Still has to get to the Election Commission but that aspect is not as unimpeachable as we'd like it to be
And have an idea as to how the voters voted
Age discrimination is a thing, but boomer just seems like some shit that teenagers have started using to call people old whenever someone mentions anything before their time or when they get called out for not knowing about anything before their time.

This be a quote from another server encapsulating my thoughts right now
I am not
No
Must be a reason why boomer is being equated to the N-word
Anyone know what's up with the boomer/zoomer memes?
oof
But State parties get elected to the parliament too, and they are a significant force
that contest elections in multiple states
we have only 2 *national* parties
And those parties represent that
because India has a large number of very distinct cuktures
No its good here
In the national Assembly
India has like....30 parties
Its usually a coalition govt
Happens pretty often here
Right?
but the opposing coalition won
I know your pain
Oof
Parliamentary?
What system does Belgium use?
got a large percent of votes but didnt win seats?
even if they had a majority
So high number of NOTAs shows the unpopular nature of the person elected
It shows that despite being interested, there is no one you found worth voting for
Like
No it makes a difference
?
Mhmm
Same
I didn't know ||retard|| was a slur until recently
Lack of exposure
That happens
Alright
Cuz some slurs are legit just *not done*
Or just this particular instance
In general?
Slurs?
Like... A slur is something that is defined completely by the negative context that it is used in. Like the N-word was used to refer to black slaves, and calling someone that is referring to that part of history and is equated to calling them a slave (I think)
Thad poorly defined tbh
Insults can sorta be used ik a loving way between friends but slurs have so much negative context that it's just not done
It's something that has so much negative context that it becomes genuinely hurtful whenever it is used
Yes
Any word can
So it *can* gain negative context
You are dismissing someone cuz of their age
I can see how actually
It's not centrist, but people are more open to explaining their thought process here without getting into insults
And another is filled with rather kind-hearted, non weeb souls
One is here which seems more neutral
Lots of alt-right leaning peeps there
One be a sorta alt-right place?
This question
Third place I am asking
That makes it a consensus then
Alright
Cuz the N-word has like centuries of negative context
Equating that to the N-word seems a bit much is all
When did it gain an offensive context
Alright
Post ww2?
50s/60s?
Of the 50s?
https://youtu.be/1tEuU_1ZGSY
Show them that even in the short term, their practices are bound to doom their bottom lines
*corporations* aren't really altruistic
People aren't really altruistic
But phrasing it in altruistic terms is... Well
Nor should it be put across that way
Well it's not hopeless
I dunno.
My perception is that people respond better to threats to themselves than threats to abstract concepts that doesn't really affect them
Mass hysteria would be better than what we have now
It gives a sense of urgency
Rather than the planet is dying
It would have been better to phrase it as humanity is dying
That's the thing
People just aren't that selfless and I don't know why the entire movement continues to appeal to it
People are more likely to respond to pleas of self preservation than pleas of altruism
It makes a difference in perception
Yeh
Not the earth lol
We are supposed to be trying to prevent a change in climate cuz that's disastrous for us
There never was a 'saving earth'
It's saving ourselves at this point
Earth doesn't give a shit
Tbf there is no 'saving earth'
Welp
South America
Oh
Which country?
Eve Morales?
Oshit
any specific reason why?
A few days of vacation
Too relatable
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
Or even partially
Thats actually not fully true
ugh
too well
Ik the feel
~~thats why an authoritarian made it to power here on a landslide~~
Cuz its frustrating at times
You are basically delinloimg decades of integration
From a third view
Brexit just seems horrifying for the the British
Welp
But you did
But you've already bought in, why buy out all of a sudden
Sure I don't disagree
The UK is the laughing stock of the international community rn
Like
Economic and political
What justifies the cost
*why*
Like
Like why would you want to pull out so bad is my question
^
So it's going to be *hard* to pull it out
Like
You integrated part of your economy
Delinking*
It can't happen fast
I would offer to engage but I always feel really inadequately exposed to talk about it properly
Lol
Tho most of it is not really transferable
There is a temple in India that has assets that, when put together, have more value than small nations
Oh
But they all have a religious slant to it
That aren't really talked about much
So many controversial decisions over here
Maybe
Lol
I saw what you said
Mhmm
Other issues form the Crux of the nation's parties
It just isn't a part of public perception much
Like the very concepts of left and right are so.... Weak over here
Different
The perceptions itself are so doffere t
It is just so radically different from what I know
Politics in most western countries actually
I just don't know enough about it tbh
British politics escapes me
Rather than just punish
And a better way to prevent poor behavior is to invest time and effort to correct it
The whole point of punishment as I perceive it is serve as a deterrent to poor behavior
I actually don't like the concept of justice very much
Like, someone bad deserves bad things happening to them
Hmmm
What's going on now
Rakhi gave me a far too interesting video and I have lost track
Welp here is mine

Lol
I disagree with the meme itself
As in
The meme?
Like, not exactly a *choice* is it?
Am I right not to think it stupid?
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/194203258485473280/644200892165390337/image0.jpg

I don't think this is stupid though
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
They just didnt buy stuff
My parents had a unique solution for that
gg
:(
Because you are outside their worldview
Yep
You can just pay attention and make sure the kid trusts that you won't blow up if they do confide in you
I wouldn't go as far as to call it stupid, but more like misguided a little
Mhmm
You can't expect a kid to really understand gendering
Like it went just a bit too far
The second part was weird to me
<:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
I get to beta stories
<:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
But tomorrow is my weekly off
Yeah week days suck
Like if the people I first talked to had gotten angry rather than entertaining my request to *explain* what they were calling me out about, I'd probably be still calling every person who cmapigned for trans rights an SJW.
And be participating in the "there are only 2 genders" memes
Doesn't help tho
It's easier and more effective to talk
Like, I honestly feel that getting angry, while justified, doesn't really help
And till recently I would have found that meme funny
It's just very *very* alien to what at least I have been exposed to
I still have thoughts like that I consciously suppress with the thought that given how much of what I thought is wrong, I have no right to make assumptions about it
Till I actually talked to trans people
I used to think much like that
Understand such people
<@238855496797257729> i do actually
And well, if you are not told what your gender is from birth it might be easier to accept what you are earlier
But you dunno how the baby is gonna grow up right?
Well maybe the latter bit
It doesnt seem stupid
Can he be sued in Sweden?
Cuz I doubt Felix will take it all that seriously
Will probably go after people like pewds first
YT is ded then
Well
But then no comments
Not doing so will be risky
Might just as well mark everything as kid related tbf
Because that's honestly the only way to know what you are on the internet
You won't be able to comment
So unless you register yourself, ads will be untargetted, excessive
So YT would no longer be fully anonymous
One thing that *can* be done is to link specific services to real life identities
Companies cannot reasonably be expected to know
Not when there is no user level regulation
No way of verifying anything on the net
Like
You can't have both
Honestly?
So it's a completely different beast
Nor do they have the targeted ad system that internet services do
Also, TV networks have a *lot* of regulations?
Socialism is not a bad thing at all, I don't get america's beef with it
Non-industrial land simply *cannot* be sold to corporations
land is protected for example
India has a *lot* of socialist policies
I do mean that unironically tho
heh
We need more communism
hmm
because that is what makes them viable as a business venture
It actually isnt
No
true
whennthe child acquires that differs
It requires a certain baseline knowledge before the separation of reality and fiction can be understood
They are very easily *impressionable*
I don't say they are dumb Rakhi
~~never gonna have kids I am~~
Pretty huge one
and till the kid is an adult, its their responsibility
and judge
Thats on the parents to measure
I agree
sure
Expose them later
That requires a certain level of mental maturity  <@284390402210136064> that children are just not capable of yet
the first GTA
maybe?
2002?
back in the early 2000's
I remember my dad getting super angry when he found out my brother had pirated GTA onto one of our computers
LOL
But that just made them even more wary on what we were exposed to
I mean, they were pretty tech savvy
and rather wary of digital media in general
My parents were super careful
Welp
Why would you even bring a kid to an r rated movie
Stupid
That really is stupof6
they are living fixtures
they arent pets
Aria went off the point a little
lol
yes
See a private jet is actually a useful thing
or if it provides some sentimental value
I dont see the point of buying something unless I intend to use it
Like
Yeah, but what even will you *do* with all the stuff
Sure
But after a certain point, more money just doesnt matter
I am of course slated to earn more
but I am pretty comfortable
I earn 220$ a month
going by objective metrics
I am technically poor
Like
I really dont get the obsession with money in general
sigh
but there are other aspoects to it
sure its important
i mean
life isnt only money...
but
makes no sense
I dont get pure capitalism
Ugh
or approx 38$ in the states
and remember, non AC costs 10$
al considered
But still pretty cheap
what 30$ buys in India would approx cost 110$ in the USA
well accounting for ppp, the equivalent of 30$ in India is about 110$ in the states
its faster than a roadtrip
if you went 2k km
umm approx 30 hrs
and non AC for about 10
for around 30$
I can travel upwards of 2000km in an airconditioned compartment with berths to sleep on
So *much* runs on railways here
Like the railways are the single largest employers in India
and also are targetted towards making  the country work smoothly rather than profit
but State corporations just have so much infra on the ground
they are *slowly* allowing private players in
roadways too
they are still state owned
like, power, railways
We still have all the state corps, and they are all powerful players in their own right
everything was state owned
India was, until the 90s, a fully socialist republic
That, is, I agree, very bad
without being truly accountable for it
its a lot of *power*
thats a lot of things you control
because when you have that much active wealth floating around
its power
Don't think of it as wealth
Hmmm
having a lot of wealth is not necessarily so
Capitalistic mindste is bad
so yeah
Invested money doesnt just sit and vegetate
money that is invested
it involves assets that are in use'
exactly
fair nuff
~~you loved a moving plant~~
lel
Do more research maybe
Like
Want more of more useful things at least
what purpose does it serve
Like you have money, why do you want *more* money
Yeh
because wealth is not really the only thing in the world
However, modelling your soceity such that being rich is the finak goal is horrible
Being *rich* is not a bad thing
There are many people who are just quietly rich
The most visible ones
Those are like... A small portion of actual rich people
I do understand that
Many jus lt quietly have one
You hear of those who buy it to brag
Many people do buy it for legitimate uses
But is shouldn't be an aim in am of itself
It is a luxury
Especially for individuals who value privacy
Well tbf private jets are useful
cuz its sorta moving away from the convo
I certainly hope ypu are
sorta like plants
Lmao
Based on that marker
Being already marginalized, referring to them by community markers makes it easier to separate them from everyone else
I get that
Ah
Like for example, if I said "the hindus", well it is an accurate description of the common factor amongst all the people in the community
How do you refer to a community then? In general
Well that sorta applies to every community then.
But alright, I will try to break that habit off
Hmm
May I ask why is it inappropriate?
Thanks
Mhmm alright
And homosexuality in 2013?
Like anal and oral sex was only decriminalized in 2018?
Our society has a lot of values picked up from 18th century Britain that never really left
And is very very cis dominated
Suffice to say, India doesn't have systems to deal with transgenders
And difficult to understand when you don't have the Indian context
It's weird
So.... Yeah
Even though it is officially recognized as the third gender
But they can't participate in the elections unless they identify as male or female
So you have a third gender identification everywhere
So their status is a WIP
And have historically been treated pretty badly
They are eunuchs
Who aren't trans per se
It mainly deals with hijras
It's just weird
Sort of?
Nvm India is just *weird* with trans rights
Wasn't the main point, but more like a SoL of a village
Welcome io Sajjanpur
There was actually a nice movie where a trans lady ran for the local elections
But I never really thought about them
Trans people have been very publically *there* for centuries here
I actually should find out
But I am not sure it's for the same reasons....
We do
Wait no
I don't think we even *have* a department for dealing with trans issues
Welp it's atleast better than where I am
:/
Hormones would have done most of their work by then
Won't that be like a bit late?
It's all personal
Like honestly?
It doesn't really matter
One can hope
One day we will reach a level where being gay won't really be noted. It will be completely normal.
Corporates won't try to earn brownie points by marketing being friendly towards marginalized groups.
I really hope that day comes soon
*British politics
hmm
Much like how french, english, spanish and portugese have the same base language, latin
Many have a common base of course
Yes
by pretty significant portions of the population
Well the 21 languages are all used
And used
All of which are spoken
21 official languages
Well sanskrit is dead so 21 more like
Lmao
Kek
<:TsubasaSmug:585839805737467920> <:TsubasaSmug:585839805737467920>
22 official languages
22
Lol
Nah bit too high
Go higher
Still not enough
Not even close
Have a guess at how many official languages there are
There is more you know
Muahahahaha
<@203444794737950720> bask in our contrariness
I am surprised we are still even functioning as a country tbh
So most of the time, stuff like this takes a back seat
But honestly? Lots of issues
Yeah India is still catching up
Lol
No way it was enforcable lol
<@!141531216200466432> People ignored the law of course
I can't really think of any products that *just* gay people would want tbf, but that may be lack of exposure talking
(just an example)
I have a product targeted towards all women versus I have a product which is meant for all women but has very specific marketing keyed towards the making it seem like the company is friendly towards gay people, despite the product itself not being really about anything related to gay people
Like someone's personal life and choices shouldn't really matter to everyone else
I just want it to be.... Well normal
I don't really mind it being marketed towards a demographic
What does it matter
Even what saki just said.
Okay, it's not something I find particularly common.
But.....*so what*?
as long as it doesn't affect you, you have no claim or stake in it
You don't have to understand
I don't understand why people think they have a stake in someone else's life and their choices
They could just run it on their own, and India has more than enough talented programmers to be able to pull it off
And T-series makes some money out of it
Sure, that is YT
Like music is just *not produced* outside of movies
And by proxy the movies the music features in
Cuz that's what YT is to them, a service to advertise their music
Sure, and they will treat it as ad spending
They don't make money by selling to private individuals
Piracy*
Because that's not how they make money
Like...
T-series doesn't even care about potavy of their songs
Saki, Indian music is quite radically different than western music production
The songs are just a byproduct
They make money from producing for movies
That's not their source of income anyway
Sure
Tbf, they'd just take the entirety of their collection of off YT and create their own free streaming service for their songs
And that's massive
T-series is not *just* a Corp, it is *the* biggest Indian music producer
How are they going to take action against the millions and millions of videos that just don't originate in America
It just attacks content creators
How does this regulation even protect anyone
Neither of which are even in the states
Like the biggest channels are T-series and pewdiepie lol
The biggest content creators aren't even in the states are they?
Bye bye YouTube I guess
Welp
Hmmm
I am trying to understand its scope
I am aware
But yeah
Not what I was asking
Ah that way
How tho
I mean YT is a global service, can it affect people abroad?
I am not american so it probably doesn't apply to me?
Like wow
The law seems hopelessly vague?
And well
I watched mikek's vid
Hmm
Not really unique to you, that breaking easily, don't worry
So everything is delicate
Laptops are designed to be compact as all hell
That's because they are micro contacts
(you don't need something that delicate tbf, even I break those)
Those are pretty delicate
Oh
The USB port?
But yeah, there should easily be motion sensitive switching devices available on the market already
(I meant as, like I am trained as an electronics engineer lol)
Oh?
I mean
You haven't studied it
That's fair
Ah kk
(it's something I'd do as a small project tbh)
Doesn't even need a computer, it needs a couple of relays and some light sensors lol
With components from a local electronics store
Like it's easily DIY
Yeah 8 $
Which is under 10$ I think?
And probably costs about 500 INR
I could prolly design one that doesn't need you to do anything other than wave your hand In a specific direction
Yes?
It*
Like it's doesn't have to be smart
Use a motion/presence sensor
I don't have much smart stuff, but then again, I am not too careful
It's would just make Indians go to local services
YT that is
But it's still a service they can very easily do without
Course not, they will run ads
It's still isn't owned by them
Last*
All are free with ads
The lady two are Indian
It's on Spotify, hungama, jio music
And yt isnt even the only platform that their music is on
Alright
If I may ask, you hate your voice because?
(don't need to say anything if it is personal)
Lmao
Alright
You don't have to kek, just said it isn't as expensive as you think it may be
Alright
A system that allows you to switch lights on and off based on specific motions
I am just giving the cheapest possible option
Alright.
But anything like this will cost money
That makes sense
Ah kk
Just.... How much is welfare in America
300$ savings on *welfare*?
(not deleting that cuz it would just confuse them)
I meant to ping <@189146272865845248>
Sorry maria
Wrong ping
Oops
But you'd have to do the stuff on your own
Like I can give you the basic principle I have in mind
You'd have to design it yourself tho <@193408538909868033>
And design the circuit
And I'd have to go hunting for stuff
But I dunno how much it costs there
Well, I know the parts aren't expensive here
Which may still have problems
Like I would fail a couple dozen times before getting a working system
Sure.
Tbf I would play with some thing like this for fun, which is not something I am sure you want to do?
Very easy to damage w/o noticing
Again, designed for compactness so very small contacts
I wasn't implying you get a job aria, I don't know your circumstances....
Like.
I was just saying that I need to get out of here because social security in the states pays as much as my current job
Ah
Aria, I can't even dream of going to Japan for example.
Like my income is just that low.
So, it's possible
In my industry? I'd probably make a headway.
I work in testing
I need to get out of here cuz I am being paid shit for my work
I am not implying it is
It isn't wonderful
A month
Like. In actuality, just going by raw conversion rates and not accounting for purchasing power and all, I earn 220
As an engineer
At a paying job
Accounting for economies that is
Accounting for that aria, I earn the equivalent of 820$ a month in the states
I feel sorta sad that aria gets more on social welfare in that states than I do at a job
I need to get out of here
😰
so why are there 2 servers?
Well no harm in trying
(a cis straight male can be pro-LGBT? I think?)
Lel
?
Actually, until I heard Kirika and Shirabes B-sides, I thought they were more like sisters than lovers
certainly isnt portrayed that way
I mean they *could* be
What even is yuri denial tho
well
....
hellhole why?
that server is not as active
Dunno about right
Weird
Valk seems organized to host a much larger set of people than it actually does
1155 here
980 members there
like 200 less
even now
significantly so
It is
If it is so much older?
So, why is the Valk server smaller?
I figured
(are these people you know irl?)
so I like it
and patient people willing to explain stuff
and has a lot of trans people, which helps me learn more
This place is lovely
Welp
This actually isnt that bad
lol
and I want symph merch
Cuz a friend is going there
Places to buy merch
Speaking of, needed to ask them about japam
I keep forgetting
ah yeh
wfc?
Well the mods on my fav server have been there for 4 years
2 years
2017 wew lad
LOL
I was liveblogging on another server
I joined halfway through my watch of GX I think
?
gear doesnt really lend itself to critical breakdown tbf
So I didnt want that to infect my views while watching
cuz you guys were pulling some of the flaws of gear while I was still watching
I muted the server for a while tho
LMAO
I didnt really count
okay month
LOL I started watching geah about a week before ep12 of XV dropped
couple of weeks? I think?
and is fun to me
And this just is the most active of the symphogear servers I am on
I am glad that the other fandoms I frequent didnt go through something like this
Wew lad
Lots of shit went up eh
ah kk
as in, online
Like they are on rn
So Alice doesnt frequent this server anymore?
Right right
Ah so that is why you compared Kashmir to the Palestine Issue
hmm hmm
Solo, you are of jewish ancestry? 
(it doesnt metter to me, very honestly, just asking)
LOL
Hmm?
Thanks for the input
So male leaning hmmm
Nobody has yet, but just wanted to confirm
If they tell me no, it's a no
Is that alright?
I am using it to refer to someone whose gender I do not know or have not asked
Okay
Hmmm is dude a gender neutral term?
Maybe the feeling of doing something
Be as cool as a cucumber
Take them all off
Gg
<:TsubasaDisgust:349013662775902209>
I got *that*
felt like a joke or an angry statement taken out of context
Doesnt seem like anyone would indetify as something that random
which I never really understood?
I assume its the "I identify as Attack helicopter" joke
<:MikuPanic:640289659452129310>
Wtf happened that day
LOL
relatively small number of active peeps here
tbh
It can be used in a serious context
Wut is complete comfus{n and disbelief,, expressing more that 'what?' <@99695384296701952>
That is irritating in the middle of serious convo
:/
Like the Abrogation of the special status of Kashmir required a 2/3rds majority, something even the modi govt did not have on its own
And that requires a huge majority to make changes to, at least here
Cuz that's written into the constitution?
Electoral system change is hard tho
That's complex
Huh
Pr?
And well that's common in all democracies
Alright
Ik that?
OK?
They are here
Aren't the seats divided by pop?
Like if the largest party didn't have majority you'd have to call elections again
But won't that just be unstable af?
First past the post?
Forget new party independents could prolly win
Someone could make a new party rn and would win by a landslide lol
They are tearing the country apart man
Confident
This is just being stupidly colfodent
This isn't dirty politics anymore
What.. Is wrong with the UK?
I mean, so much to talk about man
anyway
the XX is missing
India numbers would go +91XX24597777
it needs an are code
tho, for real, the India number on that list is wrong
thus the clarification
yep yeop
dont worry about it
I was being facetitious
What have you been watching <@309482589121413121>
but hey anime is awesome
driniking is bad trueblade
The Indian one needs an area code
dont
no
just
no?
Naisu
Anyway, not upto me
Well.
Probably a good thing I never have been exposed to it
Alright
Huh. That bad?
Huh also, regarding the swastika.
Don't be surprised to see a hindu guy using it. Especially if they are new to being outside their country. Swastikas are... Well they are good lick symbols, have been for millenia. It's used almost everyday here for small rituals
Dm?
Like I can't find any proper examples
Just what memes were they tho?
And now I feel bad for having picked up that particular word
Huh just reached kekistan....
Like the Wikipedia article says it was used, but *how* was it used
Out of curiousty, context for the pepe dogwhistling?
<:HibikiHug:620080558462205956>
I am in the same situation
I feel you sketch
Institutions can and do have biases but those can be explicitly controlled
Which.... Is not a good idea because people are nowhere near as unbiased as an institution
You are going to piss of people, and taking the free speech think too far basically means that you are allowing people to moderate themselves
And well... Freedom of speech isn't really freedom of consequence
But free, unmoderated speech is not really a good thing
Like a prominent example would be a |||swastika||
Like, in the west, it is associated strongly with the nazis, but out here it's a symbol of luck and peace.
I mean it is an extreme example of course.
But what is illegal in one place is not so in another
Ah
Well let's not go there then
Cuz no global policy or moderation?
Where people all know each other and their limits
When there aren't written ones
Well people follow unwritten rules
In general, just bad
No rules is bad.
Let's *not* go there
Okay then
That is...
Wow
No moderation just sounds bad tbf
To show how harmless it is, is what I gather
It's posted on reddit and stuff
Oh that
I don't?
Just the interface is enough to put me off
Eh
Tbf I have never even heard of it other than people saying 'don't go there'
Yep coppa is the big bad
Well to many people fashion is a utility.
~~and many people are unhealthilydependant on their outward appearance for their self confidence~~
Which means her wardrobe is packed af
Rather she uses them a long while before disposing
My sister in law is similar, but she doesn't throw out stuff
Some people just like to shop
Sooo I have a couple I good shirts that I never ever use
But that's cuz I always shop for utility
Tees wear out faster, need to get new ones every couple of years
I use mine for like 5-6 years....
Lots of oil and Coolant all around
Like use them at work
I need jeans tho, cuz it's durable
That's about it
Yeh
I think
Just... 4 jeans? 2 shorts, 3 track pants and 7-10 tees
Tho I should get some more clothes, I barely have enough rn
Now I can safely tell my fashion conscious cousins to fuck off waaay away from me
https://youtu.be/xGF3ObOBbac
I haven't looked into it closely enough so I am just going to watch for now
Anyway
Nor is it there to introduce people to communism in general
And well the reddit explicitly states that it isn't there to convert naysayers?
Because communism is a wide wide spectrum. Of ideas
I sincerely doubt it
Does it?
Maybe one of the more prominent ones yeah
Marx isn't the only communist symbol?
Communism isn't inherently bad
I agree with saki here
And allowing fully open platforms just makes it easier for such elements to spread their harmful views
~~Maria's thick thighs would break Ver in an instant~~
True
Lmao
You may have to fight to defend yourself. But at that point you have reached your base animal instincts.
It's one of the few wonderful things about the modern world, people take war fucking seriously. Compared to say a 100 years ago
No cause is worth killing for
OK maybe the latter is less true, but the former I fully stand by
There is no cause that is worthy of killing or being killed for, and saying that is a delusion
Simple
Nothing justifies loss of life
Nothing justifies it
But if taken seriously, Ver's way is legitimately stupid
Because for a sec I took that rather seriously and was pissed af
Probably not the best place to be making jokes about it
Eh
And our world, as well connected as it is now, is still not connected enough to become a monoculture
People are fundamentally *different*
All the way upto world War 2 and the nazis
It's the sort of thought that led to some of the bloodiest conflicts in the world
And that very line of thought is dangerous
As long as earth doesn't have a monoculture, there won't be one language
Language is part of one's culture
That's all you can do
And what you can't change, learn from
Do what you can to reverse the bad effects
Like....
You have made a mistake (or mistakes)
(stress upon *too* hard. It should be protected yes but not considered to be the highest priority)
Seeking to protect too hard is not a good thing
That's how it is
In general
Something is always lost
If it doesn't happen... Well you improve the structures to ensure that it doesn't happen again while respecting the reasons fo which the lives were lost
So you do your best to ensure it lives its natural course
It's not something that can be evaluated
Not even religion
No one has the authority to decide what value a life has
Who are you to decide the opposite?
Every life has value
I never have and never will say that
I don't exactly condemn suicide. I hate that it happens and wish that a more robust structure exitsted to help people step away from it and live their lives happily
And that's just beautiful imo
Which is what people are trying to push
In a multicultural community its really important to understand that differences can and will exist and pushing your thought as fundamentally right with everyone else being wrong will never work out.
All 9f the problems the internet faces is a larger scale of what is faced by a multicultural community in general
It's why free speech is so important innit (note, by free speech, I do not support purposefully *hateful* speech using it as a justification)
Its much *much* easier to understand something when you have information on it
All the differences get broadcast
But that's important innit
Everything gets communicated
True
So language, like much of the world in general, will change the more that people become involved In a larger global culture
And so many other concepts
In a less connected world I wouldn't have even *heard* about how people are not the gender they were assigned at at birth
We are talking across vast distances
I meant look at us now
Which is what is happening
And rakhi, the more that people talk about such problems, the more that they are heard, the faster it changes
Because of how fast things get communicated across distances
And this Era is the most rapidly changing Era of all time
That's all
Change is just frustratingly slow
Because people are *talking* about it
Actually rakhi, that will and already is changing
Death was one of the things that caused countries to grow closer, it was the shared horror, it was the fact that so many people fought together that made the western world more unified
Bleeding between cultures
Not world War 2
Actually I would say the bleeding of now is caused by the net
It's something that will happen over time as people *talk* more
.... That was my initial point, ideas about forcing a monoculture are bad
It's a fundamental instinct to *live*
Disregarding personal morals, life fights in weird, unpredictable ways when threatened
You are disregarding a fundamental aspect of it
Flawed
Yes that's why the plan is flawes
?
Of course when your fundamental morals are not based on it, it doesn't matter
That is flawed because it disregards the value of life
Don't we all
Lmao
start applying for opthers
So put in your notice and leave
and people ask *questions*
cuz it essentially means a void in your employment history
well leaving the job is well and good, ghosting is...well only if you are desperate as all fuck
So we don't have to pirate it to read it
Like do your job properly and market it worldwide
^
Does that mean the end of scanlation
Huh
Lol sorry
~~Rady became a hard working kid~~ you failed out
A misconception on my part then
Ah ok
I was mildly surprised because my perception of Conservative families is that they are rarely accepting of behaviors they don't consider within their definition of normal
I didn't say that :(
Isn't your family conservative?
Yep
My parents weren't that bad thankfully
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
Being Asian
Whereas the open category cutoffs are at 110-120 depending on the year and the relative difficulty of the paper
Out of 360
And in some of the reserved categories, the cutoff is *literally* zero
So only half of those 150k seats are open
For specific backward communities
Now India has a reservation system
So the top 150k in the first level get to write the second level for entrance into the IITs which have about 25k seats total in all their branches put together on all streams
It's a two level exam for entrance into government institutes in India
<@203444794737950720> so, every year, in India, you have this exam called the joint engineering entrance exam (shortened to JEE)
Wait...
Okay I misunderstood that, ignore me
That's sounds like the Indian system actually
Only half the seats have had their polls done
Well isn't it a bit early?
Ahhh
(usd)
About 30$ going just by exchange rates
(which Translates to approx 110$ accounting for purchasing power parity)
So you won't be able to fold it on one side but better than spending like 2k INR on a new pair
Since the lens is what is important
Over here they just weld the joint
~~that can be fixed~~
Like trump was one man, this is an entire nation unraveling at the seams
I honestly can only watch in awe at this slowly unfolding cluster fuck
Well
.... Shouldn't the smear campaign disqualify Boris?
Welp
LOL
Like everyone chose a style for themselves is all
But....I never thought of them as being different for men and women
I mean yeah
everyone wears them
I just always thought of them as glasses
Like
Yeh what rady sai
My previous Fram was bright blue
Tho my current is mostly black
I would have been mildly embarrassed if I had to buy from female sections
My frames usually are colorful
<:GWpinkuSadOtato:393081466176667648>
But I like colors
Thus TIL
Just that, I have never seen separate sections
Never implied that
Wasn't ever separate sections here
Huh
Tho I never actually looked for styles tbh
TIL
Glasses have feminine and masculine styles
Huh
Make it rigorous
Only if the car passes can it go on the road
Design reaction tests for various situations
Absolve them of responsibility? No.
However, you can have a department that approves self driving technologies.
Too risky
Because they will then stop all Dev into self driving tech
I really hope that it doesn't fall on companies
He is polarizing the 80% against the 12%
The remaining 8 being other minority communities
Muslims about 12%
Hindus are 80%
Not all occupants
No hindus
So it is a bloody *miracle* when they all vote the same way
There is no unified belief system
Hindus...
It's actually inaccurate to call Hinduism a religion
All hindus
That's *terrifying as fuck*
And modi is actually uniting them
That's accurate
Yes
Fuck I need to get the *fuck* out if this country
He is actually getting there
Yes ikik he is giving Hitler vibes
It's amateur politics *but his opponents are falling for it*
And it's *terrifying*
He is allowing millenia of insecurity to take root
Kashmir being the biggest example, and even *that* does have justifications which can easily be presented
So it doesn't appear odd when he *does* actually do something unreasonable
And fans the perception that they are the ones being unreasonable
He *allows* his detractors to criticize what is actually reasonable
But he doesn't present it tht way
His laws....
They all actually have a reasonable justification
The prime minister
A person
Modi is.... Very *very* successfully polarizing the Indian community
But not for the reasons you'd think
India is growing terrifying
Yes you are
Yes
LOL
Ptemper, Ptemper
Nice
Trump got pissed?
Oo
Welp
And once again, rather than the act itself, it's the way modi has allowed to be portrayed that is scary
There were several motivations behind what happened in kashmir.
Judgement
With Far too much history behind for you, as an outsider, to pass hufgement over
Tbh, it's a complex complex situation
Kashmir...
Well
;-;
And it's *terrifying*
He is slowly fanning the flames
Like, much of what modi has done at this point are arguably good.
It's the way he has *allowed* himself to be presented.
He *allows* himself to be presented as anti-Muslim.
He *allows* people's insecurities to take root by staying *completely silent*
I need to gtfo from here and *soon*
Yeh
There still isn't much *exposure*
Even though everyone has internet these days
I mean
Even though it's there in our fucking history books
They don't see the parallels
They have no real exposure to the outside world
They have knowledge
Even those who are aren't really... *educated*
Most people just arent thay well educated
I mean
Of*
Globalization hadn't happened for most fo India
Right
Oh the Hitler vibes
Expand
Hmm?
?
It is assumed that Muslims in those countries aren't persecuted
It rpvides refugee status to specific communities persecuted in our neighbouring Muslim majority countries
The citizenship amendment
Take the newest bit of controversy
And the impression isn't helped by them protesting against stuff that is *actually reasonable*
He is preying upon the historical fears and resentment that all hindus hold for centuries of repression by Muslim rulers, and the partition
Go read the wiki page
You don't even know the statement of the bloody bill
There is so much context you are unaware of or just are unable to comprehend as an outsider over which you pass judgement
This*
And thus discussion is unhelpful
I hate this entire thing
Sigh
But misrepresenting the issue *doesn't solve that problem*
It means that, at the very least, the bill has to be brought back to discussion
It's not justified
Btw I am not justifying the crackdown
To*
Too make it hindu against Muslim
Should protests exist? Yes.
But I hate that the issue itself is being misrepresented.
It's being used by both sides of the political spectrum to polarize the country
It is not a blanket ban on mulsim entry
It doesn't prevent Muslims from entering, nor does it invalidate existing rules for entry
Resettle
It is, very specifically, something tailored to help refugees from 3 very specific countries to resttle
It never was
Is not to deny Muslims entry
The main point
Ok
To give them citizenship
They won't push for a bill to help settle undocumented people
They won't try to help the refugees, of all communities
Once (and if) this bill is repealed they will sit silent
And people *Still aren't pushing for that*
Which it needs
The problem is India doesn't have a framework for refugees
Nor does it change the old setup which still exists
....... The law isn't barbaric you know.
It doesn't deny people citizenship
They are trying to repeal this without presenting a bloody solution
They aren't
People should be pushing for that
Let me finish. I recognize the problem, and I am saying that it never was meant to address all undocumented people
Gimme a sec
Context
Ckntext
Okay
The current one was never supposed to be that
People should be pushing for a new catch all bill
It's irritating
AAA
The issue is getting confused
That happened
Yeah
:/
Well. In India, there is a separate voter ID carf
Talking*
Just pint of nuclear weaponry in general
Oh I wasn't talking about the specific instance
Scorched earth yeah
What
?
And having nukes means they can do so cost effectively
If you piss them off enough, they will implement a razed ground strategy
You don't actually know
Fucking autowrong
Ground*
It's probably the most cost effective way to implement a razed grained strategy
A threat is all
Nuclear weaponry actually serves little tactical purpose
Hasnt*
Right, and you still can I migrate under the existing law which hadn't changed
They arent secular states
Muslim*
They three countries mentioned are Muslims states
It does not even address hindu refugees from Sri Lanka
Well.
The bill, in its main statement, provides refugee status and relaxes the naturalization period from 11 years to 6 years for hindus, Sikhs, Christians, jains, parsis and Buddhists for people from the countries of Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh
You underestimate it's depth
Ah man
And remember that Indians have a long history of bad blood with Muslims from various countries, much longer than what most other places have
It states the facts of the matter
It actually is neutral on it
And having allied land to land on to
USA had the advantage of being well... Far away from the field
You want it to explode
You don't want the reaction to be sustainable
I mean
Not directly no
It basically kills the reaction
Yeah
Not really used in a bomb
My fingers are rebelling
Ugh
Waterf
Heavy watter is used to slow down reactions in a reactor
Anyway
<:KirikaPanic:644235681677180958>
So sorry
Not you outside
Sorry meant to ping you aria
My bad
Ahhh
<@193408538909868033> apologies
Not used in a bomb
In*
If a reactor
It's used for slowing down neutrons in the core
Yeh
Short*
In its core
Has an extra neutron
In shirt
Hydrogen fatter bro
It's D20
Mhmm
That's what happened in fukushima
You do *not* want that
Stuff got too hot and then just started *leaking*
Nuclear meltdowns are rarely explosions
You can have a slow nuclear meltdown fyi
You do *not* want that reaction to chain
The uranium is dangerous just by being that close together
You have to have the right amount of retardation of neutrons
It's just hard to maintain safely
The reaction itself is actually pretty simple
It isn't
Yeh
Parts of power generation techs
For me
It's taught in uni
Latter is far less common
Or tidal power plants
Hydro plants like those in dams
Yeh
Only for small scale
Direct conversion using solar cells is poor efficiency
And use it to run a turbine
You focus the heat onto a water tank
Large scale solar is the same
Even solar actually
Yes
Same tired old arrangement
It's basically a steam plant
So the fluid heated by the reactor doesn't come in contact with the water used to power the steam plant
You have a heat exchanger
Yeh
Except the heater is nuclear?
<@152896851660505088> isnt it essentially a steam plant
It makes me want to search for other sources
But the author of the page was... Well not neutral at all and it showed
It wasn't neutral, so it makes me question.
I mean, pretty sure that kiwi farms is place full of horrible people
At least the article it had on kiwi farms
Well
I don't like rational wiki
Is what I assume
But they didn't expect water
They would have
Lmao
Nuclear plants need robust emergency protocols
It's mildly stupid
Without really understand it
Far more so than thermal
Ahhh but nuclear is super efficient
You can't do anything when nothing is moving
It*
They were hoping to contain it which they weren't really able to, but nothing to be done about or
Anyway, yeah, I know most of that
Hmm
It just an example of a slow meltdown
Wasn't pointing blame anyway?
Mhmm
Then tsunami killed it all
They be powered by the output of the plant itslef
Much too large
And those pumps aren't battery powered
Batteries can be changed
Killed the pumps period
You just *don't*
Like that is just basic manners
Regardless of what you think of a person
:(
Harassing is never right
Kiwi farms sounds like a cesspool of some of the worst dregs of humanity
I mean I have been saying thy from the beggining
I didn't dismiss it as useless or pointless
I just said I don't like the article
I don't need that evidence
Sure
At least in most cases
Especially when the news is not fake
For example, the president screaming fake news all the time is stupidly unprofessional
There definitely are places where it is irrelevant because the opposition has no respect for it
I do consider professionalism important vecasue well, it means at the very least, you respect the fact that other opinions exist
No, that's a fact
Huh what
Part*
And well to me, one ort of appearing rational is being professional about your opinions
What*
<@99695384296701952> yeah that's why bothered me
Like I said, I don't like or approve of it in the slightest
I don't like or approve of whatever kiwi farms is
Which I don't want it to come of as
I am not going to argue it further because it will seem like defense
Because many things seem repulsive to people on the surface.
So didn't really like it much
Like the author is completely dismissive and it shows
Sure but the biases were very apparent
I...actually can
and how young are his kids, 10?
wait does he have access to the tech or not?
welp
I hate emotional blackmail with a *passion*
Welp
Merry Christmas people, and hope your days always look up
Ah okay
(just a side note, the swastika is a symbol of luck here. The fact that he was wearing a hoodie with a German flag and a swastika may be complete coincidences)
don't ever feel a desire to get physically close to a guy
but I wouldn't like a guy the same way i'd like a girl
I am finding it hard to put in words
getting back to the main thing,
(Very much a personal opinion)
I still don't like it very much, feels way too private to me
right, we dont do PDA
right, am not sure i'd ever be comfortable getting that close to anyone, of any gender or orientation, unless I was very much commited to pursuing a relationship with them, outside family
worry not
No no I didnt ever think that
Hmmmm
I don't really think of my friends the same way tho hmmm
or my grandpa
Hmm yeah I do cuddel up with dad
It's an outlook I haven't really thought about
Expand?
Maybe so
(I didnt say that, I am talking *only* about me)
I like my male friends, and am quite close to them, but I wouldn't feel comfortable cuddling with them
Hmmm I can like people but not be physically attracted to them
(Then again, by dating I assume a physical aspect to a relationship, and I am definitely attracted physically to the female body)
it would be....not pleasant for either of us
and would forever be on tenterhooks
I find it difficult to relate to
Mainly because I still dont fully comprehend it
(I really miss my comfort emoji, so here is a smile instead <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>)
Alright
(I always feel obligated to defend it because it's an integral part of my culture sorry)
:(
It's everywherr
We use it in our rituals
We draw it on our doors
I mean, I am looking at a swastika right now lol
But it has a lot more significance to us, and people aren't going to stop using it
I do understand thay
Ik
Yeah they do Sadly
Anyway, not gonna defend the guy, just, I hate seeing the swastika being linked so inextricably to that, especially given the millenia of history it had before the Nazis
Hmm hmm
Just saying, that it's not always a safe assumption to make
I am reiterating, wfc is probably right in this case
(wfc is lost probably right in this case, but that's really not a safe assumption to make in the east)
Because it's just that common
Quite honestly, it might even be stitched on by their moms later
Because it has negative connotations there
Sure, I wouldn't wear it in Europe
Case it*
But in this Cas eit probably was
It far far older than the nazis
It just doesnt have the same connotation out here
It's even on my doorstep right now
It happens here, quite often, because swastika are literally on everything
I would really like to disagree there
Ah
Ummm
cuz it isn't really all that harmful
anywhere
Weed isn't treated seriosuly
like say the more serious stuff. Meth, heroin,
doesn't cause dependancies
Police rarely take it seriously unless you go out and do something truly stupid, and it isn't an addictive substance
but in the end, it's your choice
long term effects are far less pronounced
actually significantly less
Well. Weed is about as bad as alcohol
<@189146272865845248> oil isn't just for burning. It's a bloody chemical wonder. It is used for the synthesis a *huge* portion of artificially created  materials
Hooah
Hmm hmm
But communism itself isn't really bad...
How is this guy on the verge if being *reelected*
Sigh
Does the US ever help
A militarized China is a threat that cannot be ignored
But if China decides it wants in, India will be involved
Maybe not nukes
This is really really nerve wracking
...... Why do u have a feeling that someone scolded DJT in the white house
and what occlisto said
Your friend may or may not have a point, and you will have to evaluate that yourself
Honestly, judgement or not, that's up to the two of you.
Still is a thing
And yeah, confidentiality
Disapproval aside, it could be legit dangerous so
I mean, it woild probably be best to confirm with the doc, because there may be a reaction, but far less likely than harder stuff
And private ones for that matter
That's the class size in Indian public schools
Try to make that 50-60
>30 students
It's become a lot more normalized to be openly gay, and that's really good
I mean they achieved quite a lot
It's a movement for general acceptance that has a flag
I still can't compute the logic tbh
My company has a flag lol
Like the UN has a flag, it's not a country
What's flags got to with countries
?
It's like how the eagle is associated with America
Flags are rather significant
I mean, I go out of my way to make people who try calling me gay as an insult uncomfortable by playing it up
It isn't
I never paid much attention either so there's thay
I didn't really notice the difference
Huh
I honestly didn't know
Huh really?
There is?
It's what I do, I just make exaggerated affectionate gestures
Or play along
Just say you aren't
Not really gay people's fault, what's wrong in being called gay
Well
(sorry was replying to the earlier topic)
Some*
It's done stupid vn
And well that video which he was watching a parody game
Someone was playing that game
Or if there isn't, I just do something else
There is always something else to talk about
Just move on
If it doesn't catch my interest, so be it
I try to pick up the stuff they are interested in
But I don't really need to now do I?
I don't relate very well to my colleagues most of the time
That is a weird ass combination lol
I mean it's especially bad for me because I am an Indian guy who watches Japanese anime and reads in English
Quite a lot yes
~~I am that friend~~
Fear of being judged?
They are narrow minded for dismissing it without ever having tried it
If someone calls what you like weird, be confident in the fact that it really isn't weird at all, and is just something you enjoy
Which I doubt you'd do anyway
Just, do what you like, while being considerate if people feel legitimately uncomfortable
Funnily enough, the less you think about it the more likely you are to fit in
Fear of not being able to fit in?
I mean, if they think you are a weirdo that's on them
So there is nothing to be ashamed of
What you are doing is (hopefully) not wrong
What's there to be ashamed?
Confidence is the key
Interesting from the popular POV
Yeah
How do I put it? There is no need to be.... Well special? Or ummm interesting
Being "special" in any way or form is overrated.
I honestly don't know what people you have interacted with aria, but damn, that's just....
Ah well, I don't really know you well either. But hopefully you'll find some of the more decent humans
LOL
<:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
Must be nice
RP
That sucks
Serious indeed
What about?
/s
Kirika and shirabe are just friends didnt you know?
Hey
Had to keep track of the main conversation
Too much going on at the same time
True, but I hadn't been paying enough attention
<@238855496797257729> i have seen the light a long time ago. When I paid attention to their songs (sorry for replying to something that long back, this is in reference to kirika and shirabe)
But criticism is par for the course
Death threats are never justified
And vote trump out of office
Hey maybe Americans will see the light
I do try, I tend to forget, and am sorry about that
It's usually a polite correction
Like literally no one has shouted at me for making a misktake
.... There is more than enough
So I don't see the problem
I do try, but It happens, and I I haven't ever been shouted at for making the mistake the first time
Which needs to go
I mean I do it all the time by accident, it's just a bad habit
It's a changing worldview for a newer normal
It isn't forcing an ideal?
It's a habit that's hard to break
Sure. But you won't need to even apply that initial correction
Yeah
Or just point people that way
(I mean, if you feel confused or don't remember you can just click on the profile for a sec)
And less unintentional people getting hurt
And less confusion
It helps me make fewer mistakes, pronoun roles.
And they can be self assigned, and those that don't have one can be referred to as they
(I second pronoun roles, they are incredibly convenient)
But I will honestly try and have been
A lifetimes worth of habit is hard to change especially when I have literally zero exposure in real life
<:KirikaPanic:644235681677180958>
Many people are witness to it and they might not be comfortable for a variety of reasons
You can talk them over dms
Not bad, but wrong place
Hello princess XD
To me it's not about people getting angry when I hurt them by accident.
I just don't want to do it, and support anything that reduces the possibility
It's irritating to see stupid tense mistakes that I never Intended to make
No genius of course, but more than fluent
Like, I am *good* at English
It's made me look really stupid a lot
Lowkey rant: my keyboard autocorrects my tenses and it is very irritating
Also <@189146272865845248> just to clarify, you weren't being berated or condemned. There is nothing wrong in wanting to understand. However, sometimes people are not comfortable discussing their views in a semi-public/public space for a variety of reasons, not all of which may be clearly understood by the person you are asking for a clarification.
So nothing wrong in asking, but they can say that they are not comfortable discussing it, and may move to a more private space <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
(strongly agree regarding confusion. Like very strongly. It's been implemented in other places and it helps a lot)
You live far far away from it. Yes there have been cases in the states, I am aware, but all you can do is be careful.
In the end, you don't have control over it, and worrying over it is pointless
Maybe, maybe not
Gdi autowrong
It*
It's spreads unnecessary paranoia
Regardless, it's bad
High key bad
It's bad
Chris is great
Heh
XD
Like me
Thanks
Hey it worked
Assuming dess_iam command?
Also thanks saki, for the help <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
Or private for that matter
You don't need to, if confused one can always check. Instead of awkwardly asking in public
Thanks to her too
And lily (who are the only two of the mod team I know)
Thanks melua
Ayy
Was addressing yorin but yeh
Also the entire thing is voluntary by nature? The gender role thing?
Like.... If it were implemented I assumed it would be self assignable and has no purpose other than to tell people "I prefer to be called this"
No one would *need* to do it, but the option can be available for those who want to?
??
Yeah sorry sorry
Oh its 6 inches
I think?
I have a 5 inch screen?
;-;
A phone the right size for my hands are inconvenient to use
Me and my phat phingers
Don't take it too far
Just be generally careful. Like general hygiene
Yep
But it's not always visible in the moment, usually more in retrospect
Excessive reaction to fear is bad
Would you correct move to love
*why*
Why
Gah
Move*
And can love out for proper
Then I can leave my grandparents to mom
Few more months
Ah well
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
I need a girlfriend tbh
Lol
There is nothing that you 'should' feel.
If you are feeling lonely, you are, and if you can, try to get someone to talk to
It is perfectly normal
No
Hmm
the arm thats bent is....usually hard to replace if its what I think it is
Huh thats a lot of damage
They usually move on pretty quick
Entertaining kids for a few secs
I haven't had bad experiences with it tbh
Huh
Huu
Or entertain it a little
Like, it's not that hard
I'd just guide them toward atheir parents?
Like how small?
Don't need to yell?
It irritates yoy
I mean
So you tell them to stop?
She's never going to grow up
Poor kids
Poor lady
Huh
And no parent knows what's going to come up
I would like to say that it's usually subjective, what is a good way to raise a child
:/
Also sketch, go spend time with her. And if she moves on, mourn for her, and remember what she was.
(it may not be the most helpful thing to hear, but it's how I deal with older members of my family passing away. It hurts, but it's also just part of nature, and doesn't pay to dwell upon)
It isn't
How old is she
:(
But on the whole pretty open minded
Mom is quite a bit Islamophobic for one
I mean they do have their flaws
That they are
I tend to have a lot of views that are quite radically different from many in my society
So
But my family is also very weird
But I dunno, I never felt that?
It similar here
I can understand if people say that the first few months of a child a guy won't be as good as the mother but other wise?
Like legit
I love kids
Simce when?
Men not good around children?
:(
As long as you live as a good person, what you perceive the world as is truly irrelevant.
In the end all are equally unprovable, and are just different world views
Like, just because I don't share your worldview, regardless of whether it's Christian, atheist, Muslim or so on, it doesn't make you automatically wrong
And it promotes this us vs them attitude.
I have very rarely been able to have a discussion regarding faith with people raised in the west without it devolving into an us vs them
It's a concept that has caused a lot of harm in my part of the world here
Because it encourages people to ignore different culture and promote their own as superior
I don't have a problem with the faith, I have a problem with evangelism
Like I am not going to talk about this anynore because the difference is so great that I feel completely unprepared to talk about the Bible or belief as perceived by Christians in any form or manner
That is a very wide deviation from how I look at the world
In some way
They are entities that have thoughts and behave similar to humans and control our lives
So I am like... OK then
The very idea of a being is odd to me
I just don't perceive it that way
In the end, in my worldview, both satan and God as entities are just odd to me
It is of course a lot more than that
It was just to confirm that we were thinking of the same story
I know I did
I oversimpified ir
So the entire story is like a big wtf to me
The very concept feels rather.... Odd to me
But at the same time, I dont have a concept of God as an entity
I am not an atheist
Okay
It's...
The rich man who was tested by satan
That story is a rather wide deviation from my world view
I did
Uhhh
Oof lol
Regardless of whether it's related to work or not
I force myself to immerse in a task
I usually just.... Do something. Anything
PC is not insulting people unintentionally. People do far more than being politically incorrect
I have a very low opinion of Christianity and Islam as faiths due to the fact that there are large portions of both faiths that promote evangelism
Bible belt was oof
Also more than PC, it's just acknowledging that there is a more than a significant portion of Soceity that has needs that *very much* need to be accommodated, because they cause irreparable mental and physical harm to them when not accommodated
Also <@183785454447886346>, as a guy, I can definitively say that *yes* I want a space in which I can go to the loo without people of other genders being in the same space. 
So unisex bathrooms would be good, where people who are in the process of transitioning or are uncomfortable in using the the standard male/female bathrooms can do their business
Huh oof
Hmmm
Ban && for impersonation
<:KirikaPanic:644235681677180958>
How did that happen
Wait
XD
I have no clue
LOL
LOL
still in uni
maybe 2 years?
they are slighlty younger than ,me
pretty sure
smh
the dopamine rush can be addictive
one more reason for me not to exercise
and I was like....okay then
so ypou shouldnt do it
That the end result of addiction ios the same
someone on discord
no actually
combine (two or more sets of information, texts, ideas, etc.) into one.
making the two the same
like
Its combining
no
and I was like bruh
So someone was conflating addiction to stuff like gaming to substance addicton
There is no real greater reason in my opinion.
But the same time, I dont really need one.
Luck
Milk is the true addiction
Canada, Japan, Germany
I am really glad that I struck the UK out of my list of possible countries to study at
I was talking about how its not necessarily dangerous to game, ot have weed
I dont disagree
(so point is, I wasn't talking about treatment, I was talking about how dangerous the substance inherently is)
The end is the same yes, but one has a far *far* higher probability of causing an addiction than the other
However when it comes to substances like meth, or cocaine which cause dependancies, even trying is dangerous
That's people
Addictive behaviours happen.
But that doesn't mean that the substance itself is at fault, in the case of non-addictive substances
Like
That's the difference I am talking about?
Right
Hmm?
Which isn't the case for other stuff
It's dangerous to even try them because of the biological dependancies they cause
Like
I mean melua, substances get you addicted far faster
He isn't conservative, he is dumb
Like
Honestly, I find that sad
I mean, his sheer negligence is more than enough reason to boot him out
Wew lad

Like
An app?
What did they do?
Tell me more
Digital voting
It's an EPROM board lol
No access ports, no USB capability
It can't be fudged without physically changing components
Nothing at all
There is literally nothing to hack, it hs no function beyond counting
It makes itself secure by being as primitive as possible
Buut it's.... Well
I mean India has an electronic voting system
Discussion tends to spiral out of control
the topic is very charged
Let's not
lol
As are most anime girls
But yeah megumin is definitely cute
Heh
Then I'd be a pedo for liking kirika and shirabe and most of the symphogear cast
:(
Liking a character is not pedo behaviour
Funni sax numbah
Higher frequency = faster attenuation
Like in this age, information can be trusted a lot more, so conversely, incomplete info is trusted a lot more than it should
Also information is not always complete
I nearly dropped the show because of thay
What the fuck indeed

This just means I need to watch the entire thing again
Now I feel weird for having defended him a little
I had forgotten about that
Oh right
I honestly don't know, and I don't really have strong enough feelings for Ver to really defend him
Huh
(just my view on it)
A good character!= good person, to be clear
I mean, he wasn't a good person, but he is a decent character
(idrc the rape, which probably means I need to rewatch the series again)
Doesn't matter whom, harrasment is harassment
That's....
Ouch
Oh
But Ver is pretty great :(
In the mad scientists meme wy
Based on how the people you have met have treated you
It's a personal thing, yeah I get it
Misunderstandings and such
Does it lead to a lot of friction between each other?
Like, you have many many different people, who may or may not share common ground
Given the huge diversity amongst people within the lgbt+ society? Community?, won't there be significant amounts of friction?
Moved it here cuz it's more of a serious topic than general
Ahh right makes sense
Actually I think the states is too capitalistic
Uhhhh
He sued them too
They sorta cut hin out at every opportunity
Lol
I mean the media doesn't help
I hate my country sometimes
Goddammit Delhi

That's hard
Ah
If so, copy all of your data to another hard disk

So I am right leaning neutral?
<@238855496797257729>
If you don't want to use it, don't. But if someone takes offense to be being misgendered when they have a pronoun role for that specific purpose, thats on you.
Which happens
Regarding the pronoun roles.
Entire purpose is so that it can be used if you are confused or have forgotten someone's preferred gender pronouns.
It's irritating to deal with
Sigh
Ah well can't be against discord ToS
It's like uninvited advertising
It's... Irritating
Hmm
It should be
This isn't against ToS?
It's a person I know, not a Bot
Is there anyway to report such people?

Sent me an invite to a server 'to talk about our Lord and saviour jesus'
So this guy
What comes under precalc?
I am aware.
It's why I don't like it.
(to me at least)
And that includes not pushing personal beliefs on others uninvited
You don't make light of other people's faith, regardless of the fact that you may not believe in the same
Me*
It's just wrong fundamentally to mr
I don't participate in it even as a meme
Nah
It gets my hackles up
I don't like uninvited proselytizing
True
(I know he isn't really)
Seems relatively anti-capitalist
I don't think he'll win tho
Is Bernie popular?
Thats honestly a bad way to put it
uhhh
and ypu have to pay the fuck up
Like, you call the police frivolously, they will file a case against you
they are here
And I am pretty sure people are punished severelt for it
I mean thats still bad
indeed
So overkill if called usually
and SWAT is supposed to be response to violent threats
its supposed to be a balance I think
They are not supposed to be called frivolously
its a matter of trust tbh
ah
Its an emergency service
hiw is that not criminal?
...........what the actual fuck
swatting?
I mean.... You haven't done anything to be unwanted?
I like seeing you around
It's irritating too beciase I know that those thoughts are just wrong
A lifetime of prejudices is bloody hard to get out
Like, for me it usually relates to the lgbt+ movement
Yes
people know more in general?
which are complicated by different issues
every country has its own share of problems
all countries are a mess
a long time?
wow
Huh that is still pretty bad then
(thats the impression I am getting)
Like...cops are out to get the civilians?
Is it really that bad?
alright
huh
acab?
From what I understood, the system is badly formed, and needs reform, and people are already working towards it
I already have
I do not know enough then
Alright
I don't have the inside perspective
which is true
the moment you said that I dont have perspecctive
I have backed off
I am genuinely confused
What did I say wrt you aria
?
alright
not no basis, a poor basis
I have not said that. 
I am saying that you are generalizing far too much
Yes, the system is corrupt, but that does not mean every cop is a bad cop
I doubt it is nearly enough tio make a complete oicture of the police system of your country, and denouncing every participant of it
because you have little to no credible source of information
I didnt say you are right or wrong, I say you are in no position to even make a statement
doesnt mean that its truth
its your viewpoint
not really
because the system is biased against them, and the cops intent doesnt matter
They can't trust in the system. yes
please continue
thank you
I....still havent said that aria
Because very little is inherently evil in my mind
Yes you did explain, and its something I have difficulty in...I guess framing in my mind
I backread once more to make sure I havent misunderstood
You havent explained it? not yet?
I exoplained why I thought so aria
well yes, that was what I was talking about
it just isnt that simple
Blanketly terming them as evil is what I am talking against
I do believe that bad things are happening in alarming amounts across the world
Please don't do that
I am not dismissing what you are saying aria
Its more of what motivates people, and whether that motivation and the consequences of it being acceptable
Like, my view is that evil is far too nebulous a term to have any real serious connotation. it depends on far too many factors and varies from person to person
I am still phrasing this as how I am viewing it
I am?
Hmm
and whats inherently bad doesnt necessarily fall into neat little lines
I dunno, I said I found using the term childish because no one is purely evil or purely good. you have extremes but those are usually few and far in between
Other than the core, most people can be convinced away is what I beleive
Becauuse us vs them is something I beleive to be inherently unhealthy
Evil is a term that I find polarizes far too much
I am going to stop
sorry
phrasing it as evil hinestly makes it sound childish
People know more, and there are more credible sources of information, thus less credible sources of info are also treated with more credibility than they probably deserve
Yeh
he united all those diverse people under a rather scary cause
however, the diversity of the people within it usually acts as a balancing force. which is what makes Modi so scary
its easy to abuse for the people in power
our country is jury rigged and thus has weak institutions
LOL India has a lot of problems
plus american democracy is.,...weird
and there is no real way to change it because you are outside the system huh
and that doesnt help either
makes*
calling it evil....it carries connotations, to me at least, which males everyone the enemy
The aim should always be to reduce such things
I didn't mean for it to be that way
Ah
as much as you can
you can only mitigate it
thats just life
because someone is always going to get hurt
so its always going to be evil to someone tho
but there is no perfect solution
it makes it one that needs to change yes
I still feel that a system that people disagree with for legitimate reasons does not make the system evil
Right
You do need some structure for enforecement of rule of law
How do you regulate society then?
you want to change the society to be fair towards all people within it
I still don't see how this can be termed as evil
So the police is just a tool in the end
Right
I do know that
So in that way the police in and of itself is something that is a tool of the people in power
hmmm
that is a big *ouch*
Oof
Its that bad?
makes it harder to discuss, to reach a resolution
still, denouncing people doing their jobs....just makes it harder for everyone
more or less. though not necessarily a violent one
within and without
it needs to be broken from within and restructured
it self propagates
but yeah i get what you mean
that makes the system bad, and biased.
both legally and within the police culture itself
it can be judged
sure
punishment propagates bad faith and degrades trust
I lean towards the former personally
reintegration or punishment?
question, what should be the purpiose of a justice system
I can think of several topics
its stopped being productive
Thats okay, lets just move on
but yes, lets move on
......I mean, 
okay, aria, I do not know, you may think you defined the term as you see it, but it really hasnt come across in a way that I, at least, could understand it
I will repeat.
I am backreading again, and I legitimately do not see it.
Quote it. please.
you havent defined it.
Yoiu keep using the term, and havent specifically defined it, at least, not in a way that I could grasp as it being a definition from the conversation
You still havent told me what yours is aria
Anyway, I will clarify mine at least.
Evil, as I have understood it, is something that has no redeeming quality to it, and is something that only propagates harm an pain to everything around it
I dont think its better
Multilingual
Sorta in between?
I learnt english first
what is it that you define it as
I had not known
Ah
unsalvagable
Evil by definition means unsalvagagebale
like, police seems to have some level of accountability
like from here, I look at the american system and think, wow, they have a pretty neat system, which can be worked on to make it better
because the indian police is probably worse
I had not known that it was *that* bad
if that is the case with the american police system, then thats....horrifying
Anyway, to summarize my thoughts, when someone says something is evil, it means that it has to go completely, and there is no way to save it or reform it in a way that benefits everyone
Also rakhi, I don't think the indian police force is evil either, they just have even fewer institutional blocks preventing them from becoming an extensuion of the ruling party
That is what the people within it are bound to do, with consequences for refusing to di so, both legal and social
the police exitsts to enforce the system
the problem isnt the people
I diont see how it would work nevis
LOL
I legitimately am, and I am not attacking you in any way
I am trying to explain aria
The devils advocate is supposed to posit the exact opposite. 
Pointing out a disagreement with phrasing  to make it more moderate defeats its purpose
and the devils advocate is supposed to advocate the extreme opposite, so picking on the statement itself serves no putpose
Hmmm I think I pointed it out because you were disagreeing not with the view presented but with the phrasing of it, which was designed to be as extreme as possible
once again, apologies
sorry
Again I disagreed with her too
no?
she did say devils advocate
it doesnt bring back those that have passed away
it just means another life lost
is it though
by default
thats out
I think so rakhi
should punishment even be a motivation?
thus incarceration
they can be removed from society
in most cases they are pushed towards it by circumstnces
people dont usually commit crime just to do bad stuff tho
hmm why so
hmm
it just means one more person is hurt
yes people were hurt, hurting them back doesnt change tgat tho
Should punishment even be a part of it?
I was questioning deeper than that tho.
Like, when a judgement is handed out, what should its prime purpose be?
Punishment is an action whose sole purpose is to inflict some aspect of suffering on its target in retaliation for a harm doen by them to people or society
Indeed
I guess so
<:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
but yes, if it will help you regain equilibrium, thats good
I will miss seeing you around aria
there are of course cases where that is not the case, I am talking about the specific scenario outlined
usually
Even if they were going at the right speed an lost control, regardless of intention and blame, it is the driver's responsibility as the person with greater power
yes, it is the drivers responsibility\
as the person with greater power in the scenario, the situation, regardless of the intention, is their responsibility
And yes, technically, its the responsibility if the driver
I usually get around that by just sayoing what comes to mind, and clarifying when someone misunderstands the best I can
I mean, I can honestly understand and get behind that view, assuming I have understood it in the way that you intended it to be
they should get some form of closure and healing from it?
So you feel that it is not only the agressor but the victim should be part of whatever action the justice system decides on?
talk about it
like just
can you try to crystallize it for yourself as well
in a discussion, the definition is quite important
do expand on the definition for reform
go on
<:ShirabeToast:672245704118501376>
Since I lack the on ground context, I may be wrong
If anyone of you watch him
Has he?
In the patriot act
Actually Hasan Minhaj seems to have done a pretty good job of explaining it
Cuz many people don't have access to good computers and internet but far more people have access to porn
I mean gaming addiction is more common, and porn is far more common than gaming worldwide
All of which can be addictive
Also.... Uh it's about as dangerous as anything that causes a dopamine rush, so about as dangerous as social media, gaming, watching movies, etc.
It's a rwaltively decent place to start exploring your sexuality and finding out the absolute basics of what you like or don't like
However, it is important to understand that it is all fully staged, and is nowhere near an accurate depiction of sex
There is nothing to worry about in watching porn
It has very strong socialist elements
India isn't purely capitalist
It's just.... That the main other national party, the Congress, failed *spectacularly* two times in a row
And even now, independent state parties control nearly 40% of the parliament
India hasn't had a non coalition givernwmt for nearly 30 years before modi came along
I realize that, I was struggling to come up with a phrasing which didn't generalize
He was popular across diverse groups of people, a feat that is fucking impossible in India
And continued to do so in 2019
I do not know how to phrase it better tbh.
Smart educated people who don't usually side with the BJP sided with midis government in the 2014 elections
I see what is wrong there
I apologize
Poor phrasing on my part.
Sorry
Like not just amongst the poor, but the educated
And unlike trump in the states, modi.... Is, or at least was, legitimately popular in most places in India
And the reasons are even more depressing
Pushing stupid options ahead of strong leaders
But they basically are like the democrats rn
They have a lot of strong people
The congress is....
The sad thing is, modi and the BJP are the only people with both national presence and some sort of.... Well policy
And honestly?
Because his subordinates say some very fucking disgusting things
If there is that is honestly chilling
I probably like it because I watch it while having a poor perspective on the problems he explores
Lol
And doesn't denounce them
He let's his people say the most egregious things
And he does not fucking open his mouth enough
He is really polarizing
I don't support modi btw
Or at least report neutrally, even if he does add his own opinion
While it is by no means supposed to be neutral, in general John oliver has tried to stay neutral on a lot of controversial stuff
It came off as a very... Slanted peice.
While he pointed out very legitimate problems with his rule, he neglected to provide very very important bits of context, bits of context which... Well are quite a large part of the protests here
I am very unhappy with it tbh
So John oliver made a peice about modi
Within the state itself
All of whom are significant
Like, in the state where I live, we have the NCP, the Congress, shiv sena, and the bjp
One good thing here is that if you don't support one party, there always is an alternative
He lost by 65000 votes
And he didn't lose by a small margin either
Anybody but him
The congress has so much support, but there are large portions of people who are just 'fuck no we aren't voting for gandhi'
It's so bad that Rahul gandhi lost from Amethi, a seat that has voted for Congress for the past 40 years
Which is.... Just not working out
However, his mother, Sonia, keeps pushing for him to head it
Or was pushed into politics to early and has made a lot of mistakes
However, the most recent gandhi.... Is a moron
The first PM India ever had
That is, nehrus descendants
The congress' face is the gandhi family
It's not organizing against
The reasons are so stupid too tbh.
It's not even money
They couldn't even form a viable opposition, which is fucking moronic
Who is a moron
They keep pushing fucking gandhi
The fact tht the BJP has a simple majority is, in large part, a resukt of the utter failure of the congress to put up viable alternative to modi
Yeh
The BJP on its own controls 303, the Congress 92
148 are independent parties, some of which are allied with the  BJP
148
Not 98
Wait no
Well 98 to be exact
That is, parties that are not the congress or the BJP
In the currently the parliament has 100 seats controlled by other parties
In a parliament of 545 members
By significant I mean 8-10 seats at least
(India has a parliamentary system similar to UK, except India has about 20 parties with significant representations in the national parliament instead of 3-4)
Their support or lack of thereof makes or breaks governements
And very very important
State parties are very strong
I mean India doesn't even have just two parties
Maybe not
It just *cannot* be summed up as two sides
Tbh.... Indian politics is much like it's people
With mild leanings on left and right for the congress and BJP respectively
Both major parties are centrist wrt standard left and right definitions of the west
Besides, politics here.... Doesn't split along tjose lines
All are 99% public domain
Railway, electricity, water
Public sector is *very* strong and very protected
Bangladesh
Pakistan
The bill applies to refugees from only 3 countries
Regarding the citizenship amendment bill
Anyway
Which is a very... Small aspect of Indian cuisine
They stole Punjabi food
And being south Indian, I can guarantee that most of the food I send will not be there in most Indian restaurants
I would love to
LOL
Very much so
Yes
The national citizenship register
And the NRC
For example, regarding the CAB
And it's not small, inconsequential bits
I literally ranted about that just a few hours ago
As both an Indian and a non-supporter of modi I can tell you that that segment misses critical bits of context and fact regarding several things that he touches upon
Legitimately bad
That segment is horrible
<@263534352422404096> no
Yeah
And live by rationality and fixed personal morals
They don't believe in higher powers of any form
Even that isn't fixed
Lol
'hindu pantheon'
Non-existence
It's called nasthika
More?
Atheism has been a part of Hinduism for nearly a millenia now?
I mean
Yep
Like, just nothing is absolute
Because there is nothing that is absolute
But, relatively little
Yes
Or common to all
There is little that is really central
It depends on what the person personally believes in matt
Hinduism in a nutshell
Hinduism includes a diversity of ideas on spirituality and traditions, but has no ecclesiastical order, no unquestionable religious authorities, no governing body, no prophet(s) nor any binding holy book; Hindus can choose to be polytheistic, pantheistic, panentheistic, pandeistic, henotheistic, monotheistic, monistic, agnostic, atheistic or humanist.[44][45][46] Ideas about all the major issues of faith and lifestyle including: vegetarianism, nonviolence, belief in rebirth, even caste, are subjects of debate, not dogma
Most of Hinduism is that tbh
(I mean no Indian would really mind unless you were being genuinely insensitive)
I don't mind worry not
These diets are millenia old
You are right, but the people who originally designed the vegetarian diets were not capable of making unfertilized eggs or didn't know of their existence
If cheese uses animal rennet it's marked over here
For example, cheese
It's actually hard outside India
And they are sorta important nutritionally to me because of lack of sources of B12
I need them
Me too lol
Between vegetarian and non-vegetarian
Over here, all kitchens are segregated
Like
Because the cukture there is just not geared to supporting vegetarian tendencies
It's easier to just go vegan tho, when in the west
So some have and some don't
Many people are iffy on eggs
Lacto vegetarianism is what it is called in the west
No
About 30% of the population
Btw not everyone is vegetarian
Indians consume milk a lot
Yes it does
And milk and manual labour
Lacto-vegetarianism
Dashavatara is pretty lit
Oh
And cows are revered because of the sheer usefulness of them as living creatures
Indians in general abhor violence in all forms, and that extends to our eating habits.
India has the largest population of vegetarians in the world, and the lowest meat consumption worldwide
Well the cow worship does have a lot of context
Ah
Put it in <#407060923078017026>
At least not here
Please don't
And is a good start
Which is fairly accurate
Read up on the Wikipedia page of Hinduism
Ah
..... If you aren't joking I will be very very sad
Or refugees from myanmar
For example
But it also excludes *hindu* refugees from Sri Lanka
It's still bad, because it uses sectarian lines
It certainly isn't a rolling bill to give all nonuslims citizenship
Only 30k people will be immidiate beneficiaries of this law
To be able to gain citizenship
You have to have been in India for at least 6 years before 2014
And it has a hard time cap
Afghanistan
He really said that?
*muahahahahah*
I find them useful
But emotes do add context
Don't over use the emotes of course
I think the thought bubbles look more odd
Uhhh
Probably better to find emotes
Nothing, it's mildly odd.
Indeed
Long and fraught
Hindus and Muslims have a long *long* history here
And then there is the entire partition thing between India and Pakistan, which happened along sectarian lines
But quite a large number of people fear it
It's BS of course
That's actually one of the reasons for the Islamophobia in India.
Many people fear that more forceful faiths like Islam or Christianity will force the hindu traditions out
Like, preaching to others about your beliefs uninvited is just.... Not done
Also one of the reasons why it tends to group by region is that most sects of Hinduism abhor evangelism
Kek
Tis fine
This was more fun to talk about
But eh
Gdi
I have been successfully distracted from the NRC
Yes lol
You just don't get it outside
And it's always unique and home made
Brilliant fucking food
Well all of them are tbh
Vamana
I love that story btw
Yes Onam is the main festival of kerala
Ooo mallu
I usually run to Goa or some godforsaken village
Oh god crackers everywhere
Buuut crackers
Lots of diyas
It's really pretty
Ehhhh it's a bit of hit and miss
Diwali is one of the very few festivals that is celebrated by nearly everyone, on the level of christmas in the west
Like even the festivals are massively different if you move from one region to another
Yeh
Like the traditions show more commonality by region
It's easier to group by region rather than faith
But.... It's really hard because there are so many outliers that it becomes essentially superfluous
There are some denotations
It's hard to quantify
Commonalities*
There are some commanaloties and popular groups of thought
I.... Honestly don't know
No two Indians can give you the same set of answers even about the most basic questions
Like, kohaku here might know a completely different version
The variance is huge
It isn't
Ah. No
But it still falls within the spectrum
It depends upon people
Most aren't
Hi kohaku
But the past few months have increasingly been proving that the current govt can no longer be given the benefit of doubt
And there are more reliable and widespread identification papers other than passports here, notably PAN cards and ration cards
You do have to have govt identity, but not specifically that one
The Supreme Court struck down the decision to link government services to it
The biometric identification system was started by the previous government, and is very notably  *voluntary*
It does have a few mistakes, and it's focus is relatively narrow
<@284390402210136064> thanks for linking that article
I hate this
Fuck man
Unclear who the perpetrators are
Protests gone out of control
13 dead in Delhi in riots
Fuck me sideways
Welp
That's just.... Sad
<:SEIGI:405539944212201472>
Fuck
Death toll at 27
~~the more I hear about the USA version of freedom, the more toxic I feel it is~~
Something has to be tried, and the concern needs to be kept in mind
I mean either way someone gets hurt
just....nuts like the NRA don't seem to want to
without disarming everyone
I mean, there are solutions to regulate it
every bullet purchased, track it
track ammunition use
Ammunition
Not guns
I see
ah
freedom to own doesnt mean freedom from consequences
I mean
Add more penalties to violence if tracked to a person
which are tools of very focused violence
It's guns
people track much larger quantities of stuff far more obsessively
i mean
Just track
why disarm?
Well you could track guns
This is getting scarier
Yeah
Anything more will be perceived as a judgement of their choice, which I dont want
The joke still persists, in any crowd with a significant number of non-vegetarian consumers
I dont smile or participate or encourage
Lol I dont let them know that I am okay with it
Its just stupid
No point, it will just unnecessarily escalate
And they are well aware of it
Like.... Its not funny
Which has no relevance to anyone but myself
Its a direct dismissal of personal choice
Quite a bit worse
<:REEEE:357727557174558722>
Not like I force you to eat my food, leave me be
Or questioning reasons and stuff
Like i can excuse and tolerate ignorance
And you have to smile and politely say no
Its worse because its not even someone being polite yet ignorant, they deliberately bait
Sigh
Yes you are very smart hahahah
<:SEIGI:405539944212201472>
Always that one person who mockingly offers you a peice despite knowing that you dont eat
Eating in a non-veg crowd os always a chore
Wtaf
But can no longer do so in good conscience
It actually makes me sad to say that, because i used to give tjem the benefit of doubt
And the BJP are just.... Shitting all over it
However the idea was still admirable
Like the family law as it applied to Muslims
Led to a lot of shitty laws and protections
Previous governments took grwat efforts to *ensure* everyone was accomodated for, which.... Wasnt perfect
That the current government fans and tacitly approves of
Motives*
There is an unfounded suspicion of ulterior notices
So while a demand for accommodation by another person would just be accommodated, that trust doesn't exist towards Muslims
But problem is that most hindus still hold bitter memories of partition, and by extension, any Muslim
Or any universal holy book or prophet
It has no institutions
Which is not necessarily bad, because Hinduism, by nature is severely decentralized
They wish to make India a hindu nation
However the BJP... Well
Its something that every government before this one held in highest regard
Rather than a hindu nation
The violence perpetrated on both sides of the border was what led to India being a *plural* country
It was the biggest and bloodiest migration event in recent history
And well the mistrust did the rest
We split ourselves apart
Towards the end of the independence movement
The British just blew on the flames
The mistrust existed
But it wasnt jist them
The British certainlt exacwrbated it
Oh no
Hindus blame Muslims and vice versa
Because it was utterly disastrous
It is tje one that is most bitter in Indian memory
Like
Yes but that was the most recent Flashpoint
And the crux of the current problem
Its the biggest source of the animosity
If you arw interested, read up on the partition
I can try to explain, but it will be a pretty long explanation
And exacerbated by the terrorism that many beleive is sponsored or at yhe very least protected by Pakistan
Because of the overall frustration that the average Indian feels, and Muslims have long been a source of mistrust, partially fuelled by their more extreme elements
And worst part is they are doing it pretty successfully
They are eroding the foundations of the country
But the current government?
And is far older than tbe current wave of terrorism based islamophobia
Because it has a lot of context
That in and of itself will need a history lesson
Uhhh honestly matt?
House of commons
Lok sabha
Didn't brexit happen on Jan 31st?
a beat
Or maybe
~~context for meme? Thank you~~
Welp
~~like open discord~~
My personal strategy is to just do something else if a topic dies out
Well he is getting help regarding that
Chill, until a doc says you are impotent or something, you be fine
But still
(I think it's more anxiety in his case)
Like, people are just never the same?
Till the dont assume anything
<@!302063351767498752> you really should stop getting worried over what random people tell you......
Like....if you hear something, talk to someone who...well knows?
Lmao
While its a lot less fatal than, say SARS, its also a lot more communicable
Well it is dangerous because...well
Indeed
Just mute the server
But yeah stop using social media for a bit
Not using electronics is a bit extreme
It cannot be separated from politics though
I didn't say you did
I know you didn't
Cunts*
Counts
Fucking cubits
Indeed
It cannot be ignored as much as some people like to talk about doing it
Whether you like it or not
Well Cypher, its an inherent part of many peoples identities
Ehhh religion too, but mostly along hindu-muslim lines because they are so easy to polarize here
People vote just because they are if X caste
Happens a lot over here
Right
Voting for someone based on that fact
Like
I can get that actually
Like I said, self interest, even if misguided
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
<:SEIGI:405539944212201472>
Manipulating humanity is bad because every human has a lot of potential to act on said self interest, much more so than animals
We always have and always will be dictated by self interest
I mean nevis, we can't really do thay for animals either
So depends on what purpose it is being used for
Easy to abuse
¯\\_(ツ)\_/¯
Probably is to some people
Oh
But why?
Its unethical?
<:amatakek:493175844295016469>
And cause a great flatulent disaster
There will be that ine Indian who will still bring curry
In fact it's remarkably *tame* given the tensions that surround such issues
This just has a lot of international attention because of it being kashmir
When it comes to communal clashes in India
Honestly tho this isnt even close ti being the worst
Well
Lmao
Bill
Kashmir and the amendment bull
And he has fulfilled twi of his biggest election promises
Its not even been a year
Term
But at the same time? He is doing all the big shit *extremely* early into his turn
Not least because a lot of people dont see him as the only good option any more
Modi won't come back as pm
We have 5 year terms
Was our lasy election
2019
LOL
Hey at least this time its because of protests
Was much much worse
2001
Emily
Religious pluralism is different from secularism
Not even in recent memory
Not eben the worst
Honestly?
The riots?
The current pm and his party are attempting ti move away from india's pluralistic roots
Btw Cypher thats the problem in India rn
Not in India for sore
It can only work in countries with a relatively homogeneous religious makeup
Hmmm
Wise
Okay
The bots are a lighthearted thing
Not reactions
Ah.
Can the white list ne changed ti not include this channel
And is different for everyone
Thats just decided by what *you* value personally
Tbh*
Not mucj really is rbh
I mean i don't think its inherently unethical
So in this case the resistance to it i think is a good thing, motivations behind it aside
I am saying its dangerous regardless
Sure, it has benefits Cypher
True Rakhi
Biotech is a lot more.... Versatile
It benefits literally no one and has huge collateral effects
Mass destruction
But nukes have only one outcome if misused
Sure
Which is why enabling it too much is Dangerous
There *is* going to be political discussion
I mean....this is serious discussion
:(
ah
that bad huh
Guy is as blunt as a hammer, goddamn
Think he will get the democratic ticket?
I hear Bernie did well
And some orders regarding travel and stuff
I work at an engineering services company that deals with engine testing services
Which is actually a feat since
Specifically, they will be keeping sanitizer at easily accessible ppints everywhere at work
Wonder how much they will be follower
Which actually sound reasonable
We got instructions for it
Like
It's corporate greed that gets me tbh
Corps are pretty powerful
It doesn't work that way in many countries
That was wrong
Okay
It doesn't work that way in most countries at least
Yay
Emily
In India
I mean it brought down the congress
Public opinion has been very powerful in shaping governments here
It really isnt here
people tend to play a lot of identity politics to secure voters
That too has its drawbacks
you really have to get your votes
Hmmm dunno about the states but isnt that way here
even though I try not to
I mean I do that a lot myself, and I know I sound stupid a lot because of it
it just doesn't sound informed, thats about it
Sure you can
anyway
Then why make statements about it
Ah well
That bad huh
Maybe
but them being neck to neck when it came to delegates
With Biden having done a lot better than sanders
Sanders and Biden
I thought the ticket was narrowed down to 2 candidated
Anyway, what went down on super tuesday?
ah okay
(I was referring to carlos)
???
I mean you just sound about as uninformed as me
They are?
And the situation in the states seems far too complex to boil down to "They are happy with trump"
But more doesn't mean better
I never denied the *necessity*
Unless you have a larger purpose behind it
But afyer a csrtain point it's superfluous
Money is a necessity sure
Anyway
Bad habit
I keep doing that
Sorry
Gah
Its not even arguably the most powerful or efficient
But thats not the only tjing that can be used for ot
Sure
Why is *money* worth so much
But it just baffles me on a fundamental level
Like I don't get it on a fundamental level.
I understand it intellectually
What purpose does money for the sake of money servd
Where did it even come from
I mean the ones who are the laziest are usually the richest
its people who have no incentive to work
nor is it of lazy people
Thats not the problem of welfare tho
Ah
Buy an action?
You improve the system
Like, not even a few decades ago, someone with ADHD or who was dyslexic would be called "lazy"
Also, many people have rather....shady definitons of the word lazy
The system can be abusable
~~You are all unecessarily attacking him tbh~~
its not a life anyone really aspires to
to survive
Social welare provides the absolute and utter bare minimum
Okay
Carlos
Now that doesnt mean that a system shouldnt exist of course, but systems can and have been poorly implemented, or been allowed to go on for far longer than really necessary
Said people unquaified for jobs take years to train, and are complacent because of the security it provides
Also regarding how welfare programs being gamed, or being poorly implemented such that it causes actual harm, not to 'society' but people who supposedly benefit from it.
India had a problem with caste based discrimination. (It still does, *to an extent*, and far far lesser than it was when what I am going to talk about was implemented)
As a solution to it, after much contentious debate and a *lot* of opposition from a lot of people, caste based reservation systems were instituted in India for all government based jobs and education apparatuses.
India, when it was instituted, was fundamentally socialist, and had quite a lot of far left policies, so access to government jobs was very much a big thing, since the oublic sector, at the time, was the largest employer outside of agriculture.
Now at that time, it was very much needed and relevant, and was *supposed* to be temporary.
Coming forward to now, the caste based reservation system still exists. However, it leads to a lot of people getting into jobs that they just *aren't* qualified for, in this day and age when the gap between castes is a lot *lot* lower.
People are unable to change the system to make it purely economic, because people who benefit from the system refuse to let it go, despite the fact that many of them don't actually need it and use it as a far too wide safety net.
I don't agree with them either, but really doesnt justify it either
And the attacks were uncalled for, as much as you may disagree with his statements
And mexico is far more fucked than india when it comes to corruption
it really can be that easy
as someone who comes from an *extremely* corrupt  country
Saki
its what he has been trying to articulate (I think) in his stance
that's about it
including welfare
and has far lower trust in any sort of institution
He lives in a system where it is easy to manipulate *any* system
I get what the man is saying
Okay....that really is uncalled for
The fact that the WHO has declared it as a pandemic means that it *does* need to be taken seriously
Its actually reassuring that there is an organization that makes such declarations amd os respected
Welp
People need to know where to draw the line
And yeah
Hmm hmm no probs
I don't see the problem
Homosexual couples form one more source of possible stable family units
?
~~I hate the fact that my mind defaulted to normal and it took me a few seconds to rephrase it as something not that way~~
Stds happen amongst those who are straight and cis too
Also @ archbishop, I find it really hard to see how lgbt is dangerous
And much like the flu, it doesn't have an effective cure
It just isn't apparent now because the spread is tiny compared to the flu
It is a new disease with a fatality rate much higher than the flu
The fact that it is communicable is the problem
Actually
But in the meanwhile, we are still vulnerable
People are getting better and it's improving over time
*poor
Given the sheer size of the population, and the number of young people we have
Which is saying something over here
Very few don't
Literally everyone
People get basic education Cypher
At the very least they are limiting points of entry
Anyway, sorta glad that the governement is taking it seriously early on
Hmm
People have knowledge
Knowledge isn't education
Again
People have knowledge
Also knowledge ks not education
Honestly, that India is managing so well is a miracle
The gap is huge
Ah well
Cypher....
I wouldn't say that
Not for lack of effort
Boils down to lack of education tbh.
Which, again, has been improving, but we are quite far behind
Guidelines and stuff are rarely obeyed
Its just there culturally
It's.... Hard tk describe
Put simply
People's attitudes
Public Sanitation, which *has* been rapidly improving, is still very vulnerable
I'll be honest, while I am glad that the government is taking measures here, our system is exceptionally susceptible to outbreaks

..... Why is the image of punjab police
> Hand sanitizer and masks have been declared essential commodities for the next 100 days
And this means suppliers can't hoard, not that only yhe govt will sell
For all the shit that he has done, modi hasn't yet  changed the system enough for stuff to get that bad
Hasn't actually happened before, won't happen now
Hmmm nah
Prevent hoarding and shit
Giving govt free reign to regulate
Hand sanitizer and masks have been declared essential commodities for the next 100 days
My state has shut down schools in the districts on Mumbai, Thane, Pune, pimpri-chinchwad and Nagpur (the largest population centers)
I mean, he just might implement more effective measures that way
Let's hope trump gets it
Welp
Which is a bit scary
My city is one of the few places where there have been cases of the virus in India
Let's hope measures taken here work
You need to form your system
<:miko4:290142254180466688>
<@302063351767498752> glad that your worldview crystallized a little more.
Which is why they want to limit thw spread as much as possible
1% on 100 million people is still a million dead
Problem with this one is that its far more deadly (though not as deadly on an absolute scake as say, sars), and equally communicable

Also, when you have powerful state legislatures, a multi party system can work quite well
Which seems lacking in a two party system
I just like the spectrum if choice that a multi party system provides
Not really
I realized what I was doing
I get it
Sorry
?
Plus, splitting if power between center and state
Ah but the power dynamics are also a lot more fluid
Has its drawbacks
True
Right, and that's good
So you *have* to compromise
And the power is very rarely centralized
But you still have a wider spectrum of choice
~~now make that 20~~
How do you represent everyone in a 2 party system
I am curious
Actually
~~mel lowkey coaching lect in revolutionary thought~~
It will be different for everyone
Which it did to mw
Question was whether it looked like a workable system
That's actually what that conversation I posted was about
> trying to crowbar relationships into something that works for another person but not for you is what ruins so many good relationships
<@186660127825330177> well yes
I don't agree with them, of course, but it is prevalent
Yes
So those roles are very much strongly interlinked *over here*
And the speaker is speaking wrt Indian society
Once again, note that Indian view on marriage is exceptionally conservative
What do you think of the discussion above out of curiosity?
Interesting
So stuff like open relationships, single parents, etc. Are looked upon extremely poorly
Also note: the Indian society is pretty much hard conservative on relationships
Thoughts

And written from the POV if trust jn the government
It likely written by people who are ignorant of the greater context
Our PM has started to take sone drastic steps
Hoo boy
I thought this directly came from yoir doctor
Agreed
(maybe the doc had reasons? I do not know. Unless you are a medical professional/student, which maybe you are, I do not know)
<:seigi:303271863683907584>
Sure
Whyever not
Try to follow the advice for a bit
Pretty sure you have a wide range of options then
Ah
Out of curiosity?
Is your family vegetarian/vegan?
No real harm
Try and see what happens
I would place weight on it then
(did a doctor tell you this?)

You build conclusions far too quickly
Rather than seriously
<:meguded:256618080866795531>
Country has suspended all non-essential services in cities with 10 cases or more
~~time to prepare a few hours to watch it~~
That is pretty long
350k cases
Corona?
Confirmed deaths? 18k
900million to 1.5 billion estimated cases
H1n1?
Swine flu?
Not... Really
This thing spreads so incredibly fast that regardless of how good your public and private sanitation is, it just gets around that quickly when people arw moving around
Thats *precisely* why WHO is so spooked
So hospitals aren't able to deal
There are too many simultaneous cases
Okay their system is overwhelmed
Cher...
Hoo boy
<:seigii:661173299497271307>
Added 6k cases today?
Cases skyrocketed in the states I heard
<:miko4:290142254180466688>
Not even freight
No trains running today for the first time in 45 years
Indian railways have stopped all passenger trains till March 31st
It really do be that way
Nani
Yes
And goes to them fairly regularly?
He has a therapist iirc
Regarding this
A video was shared here
You know what
Nowhere close
Not like this
Actually, less so than this, *because ebola is not contagious*
Regardless, you really should be taking this seriously
Ahhh don't do that keahi
Based on the spikes we are seeing in recored cases
Already has
While they are thinking the virus will spread
Not even a *fraction*
Like
> Government thinks they can just shut down society am I the only one who thinks that's bullshit?
<@686676373364146353> India be doing it. And we dont have the *fraction* of the level of discipline
Seems to ve headed towards and epidemic
The us
Of thw coronavirus
The mortality rate is still not even a fraction of the current recorded mortality rate
Even if you triple the deaths
Triple?
Double?
So how much more
That still doesnt rwally yake away from the severity
Bias upwards or downwards
Okay man
What?
Regarding corona, it's probably mildly underreprted due to lack of kits for testing
For yhe states? Yes
And still has more deaths
Corona hasn't had even a percentage point of that level of spread worldwide
This is just the states mind you
As reported by the CDC, it is true that there were an estimated 60.8 million cases and 12,469 deaths in the U.S. due to the H1N1 viru
By the CDC
Official numbers
Okay then
So *yes* pretty damn serious
Already 14k
Confirmed deaths?
> Thing is I will verify the government knew about this, but they waited because they wanted to discredit the president
<@192304778938679296> honestly? Given how trump has reacted to any and all events before this? Even if he knew he wouldn't have done much
¯\\_(ツ)\_/¯
So
Nor people
Corporate is interested in money nkt sustainability
I mean
They can do a lot more, they jist are too controlled by financial interests to do so
Sure, but the government discouraging people from moving around would help *a lot*
I just hope that it doesn't become a disaster
Anyway, based on Italy, and the spikes in the states you'll have to ve super careful
You see their affects much later
Actions made now?
Its like a game with 5 second lag
The numbers you aee seeing?
This thing has a 2 week incubation
That's the thing you see.
Even if you are immune *you can very very easily* be a carrier
<:notlikethis:586047143580663815>
I have done my part
You can spin your theories
I am done
Okay
Bruh
It is a mutation of an already existing virus
Come from a bat
Ot didn't
Are you all... Okay?
I am sorry this just worries me
Wow

And locked down district borders
State of Maharashtra (the state in which mumbai is located) has shut down all highways
All passenger rails have been shut down
Sealed internal borders in many places
Plus a lot if other urban areas
They shut down the mumbai and delhi metropolitan regions
God they are going full panic breaks here
Yeah
Hmm
Well no it was people fron the con who did it
But again, other people do worse shit
To be fair it was pretty bad
Still doesn't make a case against furries on general
Basically some idiots took pranking to an obscene level
Rainfurrest
So no like... Legit reason for it. Other than poor associations
Hmm
(I ask here because I find a greater variance in people and in general, more acceptance of relative outliers)
What does it involve
For what's looks to be a harmless kink
So essentially, it's just kink shaming
<:SEIGI:405539944212201472>
The disgust seems disproportionate to the relative weirdness of the kink
its essentially a weird kink
I haven't found any real reason for it
Why do people hate furries
Weird topic time
Hmm
Which is also being looked into
Of course, older vaccines may work
> Isolating a vaccine is difficult and I've heard that it might be 6+ mos in the future
<@99695384296701952> thats.... A *very* generous estimate. Like, almost unrealistically so. Estimates are between 1.5 to 2 years
This be some insane shit
its definitely at community spread for you all
6k cases
like
I mean it seems to be heading that way a;ready tbh
And I used to deeply admire it for the way in which it came into being
<:SEIGI:405539944212201472>
UK looks like its democracy is literally dying
<:SEIGI:405539944212201472>
so essentially UK is heading towards anarchy
I hope it doesn't happen that way here
<:SEIGI:405539944212201472>
<:SEIGI:405539944212201472>
esp given how weak our institutions are
21 days of lockdown is gonna be harsh
this is huge for us
Well if this works, great
When the gangs take over from the govt
Also lmao
this feels like overkill tbh
<:SEIGI:405539944212201472>
We have like...550 cases
India is officially totally shutdown
country wide
for 21 days
full lockdown
welp
This be 1.3 billion people, a sudden shutdown is gonna probably kill as many as the virus would have
So may lead to a lot of problems
People weren't given time to prepare
May be an overreaction actually
Besides, thats now moot, India is on full lock down
Last time they did that was the indo pak war of 71
For the first time in 45 years
> Wasn't there a point about Indian Railways - now closed - never having done so even times of conflict?
<@486087033652248576> Indian railways shutdown passenger services
But any further and....well
Well that NY is able to manage so many simultaneous cases says a lot
but...uhhh that was a dramatic spike
Thankfully deaths are still only a fraction that of Italy's
no number of cases
<:SEIGI:405539944212201472>
USA overtook Italy
Hooah
I think our parliament sessions have been temporarily suspended
<:blobsweat:352986325575663626>
The parliament?
Sejm?
Along with food give outs
22.67 billion $ care package for the poor, with benefits extending for approx 800million people
<:blobsweat:352986325575663626> <:blobsweat:352986325575663626> <:blobsweat:352986325575663626>
Hmm
Our finance minister announced a slew of measures to mitigate the effect on the poor and for healthcare workers
Hmm
LOL
Our healthcare system is not even close to being as robust as any developed country's
We *cannot* cope with it
I hope that we don't hit community spread
<:seigii:661173299497271307>
Over here
But govt is cracking down on it
I mean we have those here too tbh
Even Italy wasnt this fast
People haven't had time to die to it yet
Tbh i think the deaths haven't spiked yet because of the number of simultaneous cases
<:seigii:661173299497271307>
In a week
From 19k to 85k
You had what, 3000 cases last week?
But it's spiking like crazy
So it can handle a lot more cases safely
After China and India
The US js the third most populous country
Look at the size of the Italian population
USA is heading there
Italy had it's system overwhelmed
Hopefully deaths won't be like Italy
Assuming that China's numbers are 'fake' as people like to call it
You've officially surpassed Italy
<:SEIGI:405539944212201472>
another 700 passed away in Itay
Wait which country
In the USA?
in what, 1 week?
Sorry sorry

Lectric, you just should.... Talk about it in this channel?
And actively propagate it
Yet people beleive this BS
In comparison there are an estimated 200 million Muslims
As per the last census in 2011 it was 966 million
Projected
For further context, the hindu population of India is 1.1 billion
However our media and people are using this as an excuse to demonize the entire Islamic community
For the lockdown, and led to around 1500 cases of covid-19
And it's guidelines
Did not cooperate with the government
They... Well sorta behaved like idiots
Attended by people who had come from various SEA countries including Phillipines
In India, a fundamentalist muslim organization was having a gathering
For context

More of we can't be of much help. No need to apologize
Chose the wrong place to vent about it I think... Most of us here don't know the context of the second server. Like, some people are fine with it. I might do something like that with my best friend, whom I know extremely well and know will not be bothered by gore, but wouldn't present it in a public or semi-public server which may have people who aren't comfortable with it
It's still not fully functional but net services are up and most lockdowns and curfews had been lifted till corona hit
Omar Abdullah has been very vocally denouncing the actions of the media since he got out
And most of the arrested leaders have beem released
For a couple of months now
Oh kashmir has had restrictions lifted
India is home to the second largest muslim population world wide
I have no idea how it's gonna happen and it's sorta terrifying
End*
Again, Emily, you lack a significant bit of context.
But the wnd result is the same
Trying to milk the communal divide and failing
Honestly I am not sure how much of that was actually the governementa intention and how much of that was the congress and opposition
That are excluded under that
There are a few hundred thousand Tamil refugees from Sri Lanka
The bill excludes hindus too.
It excludes a lot of people
Which has so many wrong base assumptions
People say stuff like this
.
It's just gonna get worse
Strategic silence indeed
That's why it's so incredibly disturbing to me
People don't think the media is even wrong
I know it does
Of course it does
And people started circulating fake or out of context videos of Muslims Licking cutlery and utensils
Our media however took it as an excuse to demonize all muslims in our nation
Maybe much much more
And caused the cases to spike from 900 or so to 3.5k
But they had the virus amongst them
Not the only ones to do so
Tbey behaved rather irresponsibly
Around the time the lockdown went up
A fundamentalist Islamic organization had a congregation in Delhi
Which is even more disturbing
And for once it actually isn't our esteemed ruling party's fault
People are generalizing left right and center
No but much more history here
Unironically
They said this
Like

People I didn't expect showed Islamophobic sentiment so deep that it shocked me to the core
This week was especially harsh
I am just losing faith everyday
I don't know
Probable
Or in the UK?
Over here?
Damn its hard to deal with
<:notlikethis:586047143580663815>
And its....
Islamophobic sentiment is peaking here
I mean, if you want to put yourself down, sure?
But people don't mind helping and listening, just in thw right place. That's about it
It *is* serious and requires people to pay attention and give it some thought
<:KirikaPanic:644235681677180958>
<@302063351767498752> thanks
The corona virus?
.... Will this be what saves the UK
LOL
Lectric, I was being sarcastic. I agree the stance is stupid
Will learn th forbidden ways of the introvert
The extroverts
But lectric
(I ask here because there are a fair number of transgendered people, and I don't trust google to give me any sort of reliable answer regarding this)
How common is that, out of curiosity?
that is, he felt that it wouldn't aggravate/trigger his dysphoria
I recently came across an afab guy who was open to the idea of pregnancy
.....wow that is basically everyone in both towers
Also y'all are adding more than 1k deaths a day continuously for the past week or so
Didn't 3k people die from 9/11?
<:SEIGI:405539944212201472>
NY city on its own has more cases than any other country in the world
Please stay safe, all of you who are over thee
<:seigii:661173299497271307>
1900 people died in the USA yesterday
Not like BJ knew about corona then
Like
Why yikes tho
He seemed to be giving at least a slightly wider political spectrum to the US
Disappointing
Sanders is out huh
I heard a mayor was flying drones with him swearing at citizens to stay at home
<:blobsweat:352986325575663626> <:blobsweat:352986325575663626> <:blobsweat:352986325575663626>
Lockdowns are being extend by some states here
I gave you an idea as to how to evaluate stuff for yourself
https://youtu.be/hfW0LSiAMoQ
Having a basic framework to evaluate those ideas is important
You will forever keep getting exposed to new ideas
And politics is a huge, wide topic
And you dont need to agree with one political system, all of them have pros and cons
> how do i figure out my political ideology
<@302063351767498752> your political ideology is far less important than figuring out your personal morals and what your lines are.
and branches outward from that simple concept
Like, for me, it is mostly based on "Does a situation cause physical and/or mental harm to people, or have the potential to do so"
it can be just a very simplistic set of concepts
what is the absolute base and how it branches out
Like
<@!302063351767498752> it is not a bad thing to absorb opinions. 
However, it will be good if you can flesh out your own personal moral system, that gives you a base upon which you can evaluate opinions you absorb
<:SEIGI:405539944212201472>
some things you just dont get closure for
<:SEIGI:405539944212201472>
all the time
:/
Sadly you have to wait for them to initiate further than that
<@!115744398997716995> just DM them asking them if there is anything they want to talk about
That is hard to deal with. How close are you to them?
:/
<:SEIGI:405539944212201472>
Maybe more
Some 150 in my city
When you say Health Care you mean?....
And while expensive, its not so expensive that it would bankrupt most
From that
600
Uhh
Health insurance only covered
In a private, non-subsidized hospital
Of*
That cost the equivalent of 4000$
My grandpa was at the hospital for 2 weeks
Like
But even private healthcare is relatively affordable
Like, India has that, tho they do it poorly due to people being morons
And have a economic cap for free healthcare?
Why not setup a parallel system?
possible extension of lockdown
<:SEIGI:405539944212201472>
and various others
They are sealing of zones in my city
wew
LOL
~~is this the April disaster people were expecting?~~
<:SEIGI:405539944212201472>
I am always asking myself in any conversation with a female whether my sexual attraction towards them is coloring my behaviour
<:seigii:661173299497271307>
Oh yeah
Public ambulances, which are equally well equipped mind you, are free, and available
Uninsured, and coming from a private hospital
An ambulance ride here costs about 4000 to 5000 INR, which is equivalent to 220-270 USD (actual exchange rate values are approx 55-65 USD)
We do have a nationalized public healthcare system which provides free care to those who can't afford it, and is funded by the government, but our private medical industry isn't as obviously broken as the USA
And <@192304778938679296> my country, a third world country mind you, people don't have to fear calling an ambulance, even *without* health insurance. Even if it is *private* ambulance
> I once needed an ambulance, I had to pay 3k
<@99695384296701952> this was only 1000$ less than the cost of my grandfathers 2 week stay at the hospital (adjusted for PPP, going be exchange rates the stay cost like 950$)
You couldn't form a govt without them
Until Modi they literally held the keys to power
Like
Here local parties have a lot of power
Huh
And hard to comprehend
Us system is weird
Interesting
What fr?
It is pretty similar yeah
And the majority party decides the cabinet on their own
Here you vote for who represents your seat in the national and local parliaments
Firstly over here you dont vote directly for the prime minister
Okay wait
But power is distributed?
?
And represent those local interests on a national stage too
States are represented by parties which are more closely tied to local interests
It works fairly well here. Not on the national level but at the state level
Well
Also why are you hung up on just 3 parties
It gives negotiating power
Oh but it will
And you didn't address the idea of state power
Ideas
It shows greater representation of idead
I wouldn't call it wasted dud
You can vote for *not* the two parties
Like
But still better than just 2 parties imo
True
Conversely lack of a strong central party can lead to anarchy
More voices and points of view are heard
So coalitions mean *compromise*
Also in a federal system like the US, where states have significant power, locally powerful parties can rise fairly easily
Firstly, more than 3 groups can exists
Uhhh not really dud
As in
?
Yes
<:SEIGI:405539944212201472>
What the *entire* year
He is salty af
Honestly more terrified of being stuck at home with my uncle for such an extended period of time
Gah
<:seigi:303271863683907584>
Lockdown extended
<:SEIGI:405539944212201472>
You lie
<:yamero:255877561601490954>
Its exceptionally vexing
Yeah
Honestly, gonna see if I can get my new boss to use discord
Lmao
Hot damn
Like
Honestly this just doubles the reasons for buying nitro
So... It's operating ethically
Hey, it's legit honest work
Lmao
So cumbersome
It's just
I don't like outlook and Microsoft products
Sigh
How is Microsoft teams in comparison?
Skype is so cumbersome
It's hecking useful
Heck it would be brilliant if I could convince my boss to setup discord for work
Ngl, I use discord a lot, so don't mind paying for it
<:Ruby_Cry:661198742099329035>
<:yumiyan:230841435857879040>
Thanks for that call out
<:yumiyan:230841435857879040>
> Nitro addicted
Yeah
Without ads?
How does it stay solvent
Imagine if discord became paid
Heck the only thing that is close seems to be slack
I mean discord is super useful outside of it
There were 126k cases world wide a month ago
They declared it a pandemic little more than a month ago
Hell they were warning about this since February
Given the time line, and they have done a fairly decent job
It's incredibly valuable
They don't need to see each other across the table
So people who are at odds with each other can report to the WHO
They serve as a buffer fkr tensions
Coordinate *international* response, that's not a small thing
As a supposedly neutral body
They help coordinate response
That's a fairly large thing muso
WHO isn't an intel organization, it relies on member countries reporting their info to them reliably
It's now at 2 million
Lesser than a month ago we had 2-300k reported cases
The virus was first reported in December
Its mid April
And the rate of it
Am not honestly too sure about that, look at the spread
<:SEIGI:405539944212201472>
Wait <@284390402210136064> trump legit cutting funding to the WHO?
That's fucking huge
Discord has 200 million users
I mean
Yep
But the other server is a fraction of this one's size
This server has the highest density... Maybe second highest? In the servers I populate
Some watch anime, some don't
... I honestly haven't noticed much difference.
I know a few trans guys amd a few trans women and a few NB people and they are all equally rare
That too
Anyway, trashing the WHO as a whole os sorta unhelpful, they are a product of a flawed system which needs to be fixed
<:seigi:303271863683907584>
Yeah
But China fucks up everything which it feels threatens its Powe
Yeah
And I don't blame the WHO for that, it's a failing on the part of the UN
International legitimacy is unfortunately a thing
Yep
It isn't recognized as a country by many member nations
And its set of organizations
Who is and who is not a part of the UN
Its upto member nations to decide
It is, but the WHO cant decide that can jt
Over maintaining their projection of power
And China is not really all that concerned with human life or humanitarian causes
China is the second largest contributor
I blame china more than the WHO for that tbh
So they want the info... But they technically aren't acknowledging Taiwan as a country
The WHO is in a rock and a hard place.
They arent a body that can decide who is and who is not a member
And honestly?
I did say *supposedly* neutral
After that, it's on countries to take the measures or ask for external help as required
Part of the WHO's responsibility is to report and warn the world about dangerous diseases in time for countries to prepare, and they have done that to the best of their ability
Heck, many countries at the time thought they were panic mongering
Yeah, no shit, that's not a small declaration to make
From first report to pandemic declaration in 3.5 months? That's *fast* for a global level bureaucratic organization
126k cases in a population of more than 7 billion
But both sides propagated it
Responsibility lies on the governement
The government allowed irresponsible statements by both sides to slide, and didn't clarify it well enough.
But it's true
Both siding?
On either side of it
But please *do not* contribute to that sentiment
I am not denying that
(forgive me, I get pissed off because part of the reason that there was so much violence was because both sides propagated bad info regarding the bill)
Heck, the bill leaves out hindu people too, it leaves out a *lot* of refugees
Fuck modi's word, look at the exact provisions of it
Modi himself, and prominent members within his party said that the bill wasnt meant to be that, and the wording is quite clear about it.
Western media has downplayed the importance of both the time cap and the fact that it applies very specifically to only 3 countries
Regarding the bill
Wrong phrasing Emily
Indian civil code isn't uniform and it irks the hell out of a lot of people
Over the civil code and what was viewed as preferential treatment
And there was building frustration
It always *was* strong
Emily... Islamophobic sentiment was strong before modi
And that was before modi
Very very few indian hindus have the perspective required to view Muslims objectively
But it could very well be
I hesitate to call it majority
He sadly represents the collective will and attitude of a large *large* portion of Indians
The fire was lit, Modi is a result of it
Other way round
Yeah<:seigi:267071474936840193>
Nor is it really modi that caused it, it's always been there
Problem is it isn't really isolated
True
To be fair, he actually *isnt* doing that right now
Staff*
With the medical Stagg
It didn't help that the members of the Islamic group behaved like morons
'biological Jihad'
Media started demonizing Muslims
(in this case that is)
So despite the government actually not trying to be partisan about the issue, our people are doing it anyway
So now it's taken a life of its own
What happened was that the current government lowkey encouraged those sentiments
Heck partition was a result of those tensions
India has had hindu/muslim tensions for centuries now
Isis is new
What
Behind Islamophobic sentiment
In India
Before you go any further, long long history
So our media started hating on them
Islamophobic sentiment is at an all time high here
And they had dispersed to all four corners
A week or so into the lockdown a Islamic fundamentalist organizations meetup was discovered to have positive covid 19 cases
Uhh so lockdown was imposed 3 weeks ago
I had not known you were south Asian descent
👀
(I probably can provide better context since I live here)
Uhh
Well
Hmm
<:Ruby_Cry:661198742099329035>
LOL
(and I sorta need to go, so we can continue this later?)
He seeds of it far *far* predate modi and his government
If it weren't for the fact that I like talking to people and learning about different perspectives, it's very likely that I would be part of the large number of people that support the entire hindutva movement
Even before modi came to the fore
Like
It's hard to describe the scenario on the ground level Emily.
The regional news stations and all
The local stations
Not national media
And people bought into it
But our media propagated the idea
The government has not been as passive about it this time.
In this case, not really
Which happened in the aftermath of the jamaat incident
Oh right demonization amd generalization
Nor does it give a free pass for all hindus
It isn't
Many people were against this, and in large part, they were operating under 5he false assumption that it is meant to lock Muslims out of tje country
Its not just Muslims who were a part of the protests
Besides, again
I never said that nor will I say it
And no its not
In this very specific scenario and case, regarding this bill, both sides are at fault.
So?
Ok?
6-8 hours in a week is not a bad thing
At best, i game twice a week
I sure don't
So don't game everyday
Where even are you pulling that number from
What
No
Yes
As with everything
But complete abstinence *also* has severe negative effects
I used to think the same
Abstinence is not the answer
And that's a dangerous conclusion
It means you moderate amd monitor
Thay doesn't mean you avoid all consumption
Overconsumption is bad
It depends on you and your habits
No.
Or gaming
Or shooting a gun at a target
Or driving rashly
Including eating tasty food
That's true of everything that causes a dopamine rush
Very few het-cis men at least, since that's where my exposure lies
I know of very very few people who are like that
If you are masturbating to porn multiple times a day, you have a problem
Which makes sense
Yeah both on yhe surface link it to over consumption
Link these problems not to *porn* but ooor sex ed and exposure to healthy relationships
Also, the links I have seen
Show
Right
When consumed in excess
Is bad
Gaming
Lectric
Also, anything is bad when over consumed
Chill lectric
We aren't discussing mechanics
I mean
I sorta disagree?
He can play 6 hour on the weekend
Like he doesn't need ti play 2 hours a day
He can use it whenever
Weekly limits
I didn't tell him to schedule tho
<:yumiyan:230841435857879040>
I offered what worked for me
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
Sounds good
And rest for a bit before doing it again
So you can spend one 12 hour session
If you feel you are exceeding it, cut back for a bit
Set a limit
Hours per week
Doesn't need to be a rigid schedule
The second is quite a bit harder to achieve
Another os being self aware
One way is schedules
Unless you have iron self control, you don't get into it
With that capital D
So Dangerous
But unregulated
It's gambling
Don't ever play gacha
Oh right
And if you feel you are spending too much time, let go for a bit
So play as per your interests
Okay
And if they badger you, you have every right to snap back at them
The obvious solution is that just because someone else loves it and binges it, you don't have to
That isn't the obvious solution
So indulge occasionally
Alright
It ain't as black and white as that
Point is, you don't make sweeping statements for everyone
If you feel you can't moderate reliably, you abstain
So it's not for you.
As with everything, it's upto you to find your personal balance
At least
I spend 2-3 months on any game that I get
You don't have to play every game in the world
Ok?
(and hope you have a therapist or a friend whom you can talk to about this ><)
As a stranger on the internet
I unfortunately don't have much else to add to that
>pat Emily
But it's startling just how the interpretations of said values change based on changing perspectives
It's all still consistent with the moral values I started with
Change has been rapid for me. And fairly radical
Lots of my views and perspectives have changed in that time, so much so that now that I think back upon it, it's rather shocking, the views I used to hold
The past year and a half has been very interesting
<:GWovoYayy:390538500195352578>
Hi Emily
LGBT movement is at its infancy here yeah
I know people online, and all my exposure comes from it
Irl that is
Or any openly gay people for that matter
I don't actually know any openly trans women
Oh no, in general
It does for me at least
But i am definitely attracted to a female body over a male one
It doesn't disgust me mind you
That I wouldn't, mainly because sex is a large part of me forming bonds, and a penis doesn't turn me on
It is
Yes
(which of course is crude, but we were discussing this as friends)
More specifically I said, get a vagina and lose the beard
And I said if he were female I'd jump on it
We were discussing tinder bios
No, he is a guy. A cis guy
I am definitely sexually attracted to a female body, but why does being assigned male matter
Was talking to a friend of mine and was like... But why did I have that block
I used to have a lowkey block against dating a trans woman
Regarding myself
I just had an interesting realization
Like they are anti anything that has centralized authority outside of the proletariat
Sure. But they weren't specifically anti-hindu
<:seigii:661173299497271307> <:seigii:661173299497271307>
What even does communism have ti do with religion
<:seigii:661173299497271307>
It's so endlessly amusing to see people calling anything mildly anti-hindu communist
Rip Poland
I do not know how accurate the portions about the question of evil is
It also puts across parts hindu attitudes towards the world, which is interesting to note.
Which puts across views.
TW: In my opinion, this video is also quite preachy. So take it with how many ever grains of salt you need
So an interesting video
https://youtu.be/RgtOeWBh9J8
Only notable change for me was a better handle on my libido and decreased overall horniness
I don't remember feeling that way during puberty
Interesting
Disc collapsed and trapped nerve fibre
My uncle had a minor spone injury that caused a similar temporary loss of mobility
Dess
And the American peeps look like they are gonna re elect him
But then I see DJT in office and this huge number of international diplomatic disasters
Heck most of the peeps here are American
I intellectually know that Americans aren't dumb
Now people are like.. 'aren't they a bit... Dumb?'
Like.... People here?
It used to be the dream to go to America
Trump*
It's lowkey funny seeing just how badly trumo is destroying america's international reputation
Which, honestly? Is an acheivement given the sheer number of poor people my country has
At this point, as many people have died of the virus as they have of conditions caused by the imposition of the lockdown
The problem is the sheer scale here
Well the government here has been trying to disburse welfare money and goods
These are literally starving people
Legitimately motivated tbh
And well
Anti-lockdown movements are a thing here too
I would like to say that online friendships are a lot easier to uhhh terminate. Just cut off. Leaves a sense of non-closure when it happens that isn't as easy with IRL friendships and relationships
<:SEIGI:405539944212201472>
Thanks Emily
Because assumptions made are challenged
And my perspective on the world, and always subject to change when I get new inputs
Those just are my ideas
I never thought of it that way
Heck, I am told that my ideas are centrist
The labels come later
What you need to do lectric, is focus on your personal moral system. And start evaluating your outlooks based on that, not on higher level labels
Their being an asshole is independant of that
Nit because they espoused leftist, rightist or centrist policies
If someone disagrees with your idea and refuses to expand upon why, they are an asshole
<@302063351767498752> I have told you this before. I will say it again.
You are far too focused on the higher level labels. You just *do not* need to
People calling me a hypocrite because I am more disturbed by narration lewding 8yo than narration lewding 13-15 yo
Information isn't really junk tho
People be weird. And complex. And hard to gauge properly. Some are fun, others are not.
like, why x opinion is good and why y opinion is bad
I am not fully sure you are asking why enough
you just are... sorta...skipping a few steps in the process.
sorry
> i can sure laugh at all of them
<@!302063351767498752> so if you wanna laugh at their obssession with war, then sure, go ahead. but *do not* dismiss them as people just because they have war-based hobbies and interests
dont do that
just.
> people are complicated, saying otherwise would mean denying centuries of philosophers
forget centuries of philosophers. It just is fact. People are not simple. Trying to shove them into a box and define and dismiss them based on it is the basis of all bigotry and racism
you really *cannot* dismiss anyone like that
is complicated
*everyone*
everyone
Lec
people aren't that simple
dont need to fall into that neat little box
You don't need to go by any one of them
The labels will come later
Start developing and clarifying your personal moral system
Stop judging people based on broad labels
I will tell you this a third and last time
they won't fit my man
Once again, putting people in unnecessary boxes
> but I know lots of people who base their entire personality over war history, guns, tanks, and the soviet union
and disdaining war history is a bad thing. you learn from others strategies. examine them
And tend to go into civilian tech
A lot of military tech are amazing feats of engineering
And tanks are amazing feats of engineering
what in the world
which....makes sense. Or rather, is something that I can understand, even though I know its not true
Well more like they dont consider trans women as real women
Since it isn't really all the common
And doesn't really deter people
A lot
Is just
The amount of effort needed to confirm and carry out a death sentence
Death penalty just seems.... Ineffective
India's movement is a bit behind
Yeah makes sense
LGBT movement is only now gaining some traction here in the public eye
And other smaller governance bodies
Reservations in local parliaments
And lots of female positive movements
They got sex determination tests banned here for one
Like female infanticide
Just focused a lot more on more basic issues
And feminism is quite strong in India rakhi
As in?
?
We have feminist groups
Then again i haven't come across anyone trans or gay in my part of the world so..
I've never come across a terf
<:seigi:303271863683907584>
to be a truly 'people person'
I am too bull headed and uhhh strongly opnionated
oof
<:yumiyan:230841435857879040>
<:notlikethis:586047143580663815>
<:GWovoYayy:390538500195352578>
Despite not liking either
what real hate?
?
its everywhere
Well the naggy wife 'meme' transcends cultures
POC?
Indian that is
yes I am
But quite a large portion of guys  in my country at least, are the same
Probably should have added straight in there too
I was very specific with my words because I don't have experience with anything else
complains about the wife
every married guy I know does it
like
its not only straight white peeps
lol
oof
didnt he come under fire for pushing for legislation that would harm gay and trans people?
;-;
i only know him vaguely sadly
token gay?
cis gay men I assume she meant
LOL
what is the history there?
as in
can I ask why theyd have a problem?
just be nice people
<:SEIGI:405539944212201472>
> Yeah, please don't 🤢 
> damn that really was fucked up. Please tell me this took place in like the 60s or 70s or something and that people learned their lessons
<@504069701911969803> I don't want to. But regardless i actually cant
Like... The man was like, what is wrong with modern Japanese people, how are their thoughts so similar to mine?
The man is still alive
Man was creepy? Yeah. Japanese reaction though was even more fucked up
I can't link that video because it contains exceptionally graphic content
They also had a porn star stay with him and have sex with him for an entire day and the revealed at the end of it that he was a real life cannibal
'real life cannibal as a wolf'
They filmed a short story with a variation of little red riding hood with him as the wolf
And Japanese media and stuff treated him like a freak show
Because he had no idea what to do
He used to channel his urges into masturbation
And he had no idea what to do bout it
The man knew he was fucked up
You know whats sad?
Murder didn't take place in Japan
Whom he outright admitted that he wanted ti eat
Heck he ended up travelling tge world with a couple of women
They just casually left him alone
They didn't give him psychiatric treatment
They didn't arrest him
Japan.... Japan didn't do anything
Because there wa outrage amongst the French public
He murdered a woman and ate her body in France and was deported back to Japan
Issei sagawa
This man
<@504069701911969803> so uhh
Rip poland
Welp
It isn't lame. It's the basis of reasoned thought
It is more than enough
There are examples that directly contradict that statement that you know of
That's more than enough isn't it?
And the people I have talked with
Its fairly easy to say that its not true based on what I have seen
Why not?
Like the many people here
Okay. Does that really mesh with real trans people that you have talked to
All of this is based off of a simple concept for me
And peering at anything that denies its existence with a wary eye
You start with accepting that it exists
You don't need to know immediately however
Many don't
Okay
> For me, the first question J would ask is "are there people who suffer from it"
Once the answer to this question is 'yes', the rest is just details that need to be filled in
If not, is there any way to mitigate its consequences
Is there a clear answer for it?
What is the best way to resolve it without hurting people
What causes it
Then I would search for reasons
If the answer is yes, then my first action is to accept that it exists and that people suffer from it.
For me, the first question J would ask is "are there people who suffer from it"
You doubted it's validity
Dysphoria
Your question from above
Let's take an example
Okay
They are only useful for grouping people in vague groups, not for really forming your opinions off kf
Clarify your base morals and judge everything based on those.
Don't think about labels. They are mostly irrelevant generalizations
But whatever
Thrice
I gave you an idea
That is, psychiatrists or people suffering from it
Because my source tends to be people
I don't have studies on hand
But it's existence is not debated
On*
No clear consensus in reason
Dysphoria (not just gender dysphoria) is a well documented psychological issue
<:seigi:267071474936840193>
And that applies to any framework, religious or not
In the end it is a framework. Trying to stick hard and fast to every aspect of it regardless of changing contexts is what the problem is
People with agendas co-opt it for their own purposes
Ehhh religion isn't an inherently bad thing
So. Its hard to really help them
Take away the core of their beliefs and they just will fall apart
Close to impossible
Well
Pushing them away from radical thoughts is
Not necessarily
But if true, its fairly consistent with what trump wants to do
Well if it's true, it doesn't seem to citing sources well
You having a path decided is good. But if you fall off of it, there is always a million other paths that are still viable
Like
Of course6
There always are options
Which I sorta gave up on when I got my current job
Japanese to English
If I had failed out of university (a definite possibility), I might jave gotten into technical translation
So losing one is not the end of the world
There are *so many fucking options*
But that's the thing
Sure, it closes some options
You make decisions and make the best out of the consequences of it
It's never 'figured out'
Life isn't straightforward
Working with engine testing and dev
Of*
And right now I am in the core if my field
I failed 2 subjects in university, have a GPA of like, 2.2 (on the 4 scale, its 6.4 out of 10), took an extra sem go complete university
Take me for example
Like... Always
Like, there is always another option
I'd say 99% of humans function like this
I mean, 90% of humans function this way
Not really
And you won't always have the info you need
You always have to take decisions
You cant 'figure it out'
Thing is, life is complex
Not in the least
I dont have my life figured out
Then I am a waste too
Not rwally
Adulting is a lie children
Like, proper formal debates
You should watch formal debates
That's how people function
So if one of those facts turn out to ve wrong, you revise the assumption to remain consistent
What are the base facts/beliefs that are used to form that assumption
And when you form an assumption. Make sure you are aware if what *your* reasoning for assuming that is
Until you find something that directly contradicts it
Stick to it
When you form an assumption
Which is why I am saying
It's upto the other side arguing to form a consistent logic to account for the fact that their base assumptions don't account for existing data
> idk it seems like kind of a lame argument to me
So saying that 'this contradicts what I know' is not a lame argument
And I mean an example, not a random argument
Once you form an assumption, stick to it unless you find an example that directly contradicts said assumption
And there is no way to really even rationalize it
Coming from people who have lived it their entire lives
Is false because there are direct examples personally known to you that fall outside that statement
That statement above, from it's a fetish
Its not really needed when there are clear examples that fall outside that reasoning
How do I put it?
Objective data is when there are a set of questions over which there is no clear consensus for the answers amongst qualified experts
And talking to people counts
You have your own exoerinece6
You dont need ti lectric
It doesn't mean living for others
Your dad has a point. Your interpretation is a bit off
It means doing stuff that makes you happy while also making sure that it doesn't harm others in the process. It means developing a sense of empathy for those around you, and not acting *purely* on selfish desire
It doesn't mean sacrificing your happiness for everyone else
You don't do things without thinking about others
This means you look a little beyond yourself
> my dad tells me a lot that "when you're a kid playing video games and stuff is fun but growing up is about learning to find joy in serving others"
<@302063351767498752> so. This doesn't mean you dont do anything for yourself
Honestly. If GS is bad, then symphogear has far worse elements.
It, in order, normalizes rape (ver), emotional abuse (top dad), physical child abuse (nastasjaa)
<:seigi:303271863683907584>
Lmao
Autowrong you mean
Not *always* relevant solopy
Anyone who enjoys any second of symphogear is shit.
It's a show that celebrates abuse and rape and you are morally deficit for enjoying it
That's what your statement is
You like a show with *ver* in it
So you are shit wfv
But you like the show
Alright then
Feel free to judge me over it
But whatever
No. I am saying such strong statements are not justified
You assume so
Nope
I am not defending anything
Honestly the strength of the judgement just makes me think less of the entire argument. Regardless of what points you may or may not have
That I can't even
Is so amazingly judgemental
That
<:seigi:303271863683907584>
It literally wants to destroy and kill said rapists
GS doesn't present rape as good or normal.
Welp
In fact everyone here explicitly talked about other reasons for which they enjoyed the show
Nor did anyone try to defend the rape
I doubt anyone here did
Not the fact that you didn't like the rape
More than anything, it's the rank hypocrisy and judgement thats controversial
Alright
That is all
Nor does he have any right to judge others who enjoy other shows with questionable themes
If he is going by his own definition and morals. He really shouldn't be supporting this show
I feel obligated to point it out
Sure.
Literally celebrates
Well then. You are supporting symphogear. Which celebrates far worse themes.
Alright then.
Your attitude wfc is fairly similar to some of the worst people in society that I have come across.
Blanket condemnation is never okay.
Not hearing people's reasons is *not okay*
No. People saying that your condemnation is way too strong and way too generalized
This is just insults now
Okay.
No not really. Its not productive
It's not gonna change
Just leave it
You are fine. Chill.
Aria
Anyway
Shouldn't have engaged
<:seigii:661173299497271307>
You don't get to judge everyone who enjoys aspects of the show
Fair
You don't like it
Okay
That's what your statement sounds like
Honestly wasn't the point.
<:ShirabeEmbarassed:336657288477671436>
Anyway
It's harder when you respect the person in question and don't like seeing them that way
True
Hard not to descend into insults and stay objective when the opposite side is doing their damndest to do the opposite
As hard as it may be to resist
:/
Don't do that rady
Apologies
I will stop
Okay
He didn't hear a word of what is being said
Lmao
Bernie, the most zoomer boomer
But doubtful
Will be amazing if Bernie somehow manages to finagle a win
Don't we all
But I like seeing this place being a point of good discussion. Toxicity just makes me feel down
True
Ugh
Yeah they are hypocritical
Ik matt. Just, it can hurt people. It's a bit sensitive, for good reasons
And not lead to any productive discussion
It will just hurt people
Or if they do they are silent about it
No one here agrees with that opinion
Honestly I would petition for that to be deleted from here
<:seigi:303271863683907584>
They shouldn't have a problem stopping or cutting back
Like
Problem*
If they don't stop, it's a peon lemme
So say so
They just say 'not my thing' and move on
Like, people I consider close don't insult my taste (for anything more than teasing)
That's some weird friends >.>
They are welcome to their flawed judgement
If they mean it seriously I just ignore them completely
I mean... I just ignore it. Or consider it a meme and just insult them right back
Well I usually don't participate, I just use it for the hentai subs. And world news
I thought that was what you had commented or summat
Ahh
So not surprising that they temporarily banned you
Maybe they are, but you sorta just insulted a post.
Centuries at least. Millenia most probably
Has been for a long long time
It's an implemented lifestyle over here
And are perfectly healthy
And many have just one
More food
I like 3 meals a day
<:blobsweat:352986325575663626>
Preach
Heh
It's one of the many roots of today's problems
Its particularly unhealthy imo
Lol
And this is common to all groups
'if you aren't with me you are against me'
The problem is exacerbated by confrontational attitudes imo
Jokes aside
<:yamero:522497824685031424>
Not in the least because people like to frame those who don't beleive in the same things as enemies
Many people have their beliefs polarized by the internet
So depends on the person
Others don't
Some people look for more info to confirm their own biases
Depends
Sorta
It's just more apparent due to the sheer anount of info
Everyone falls prey to this
So people form judgements and perspectives based on flawed information
Its just that information is more free. And also less rigorously verified
No aya
And christian and muslim fundamentalists tend to be particularly irritating since large sects of both beleive in evangelism
Indeee
Its a horrible generalization of a beautiful concept
> Religion means a very particular thing in the west, Anand.
<@263983345669505025> i know. I hate it
A fundamentalist interprets a source material extremely literally
Its more than that aya
I feel obliged to point that out since they are frequently conflated
There is a difference between being religious and a religious fundamentalist.
It's a dangerous mindset
Indeed
It's a bit dangerous since religious books are products of their time
> That's a big word that I don't understand
<@238855496797257729> those who interpret their world view completely literally
Haffun
Just, veggie diets aren't bad either. That's about it
I am not asking you to lol
Of course
Since the older hindu traditions abhor killing in all forms and seek to avoid it always
Its something that's just part of our culture
And a large large variety of vegetables
For vegetarians
Home made curd is the biggest source of B12 here
But need not be meat
You do need some animal product
I said vegetarian not vegan
To compensate for the lack of meat
And milk products
Indian diets are heavy on pulses
Because the support system for it doesn't exist
Like, it's difficult to implement in Europe
Mhmm
Oof
Dont judge it
Life*
Its a oife choice
I am saying, don't dismiss it out of hand
I know.
I don't have supplements
So people pay attention to it
It's in the culture
It isn't here
Depends on where you are
My family has been vegetarian for literal generations
It's not impossible as you think it to be is all I wish to say Cypher
I am 6'2"
Nope
¯\\_(ツ)\_/¯
350 million Indians disagree with you
You just need the right support system for it
Fairly easily
You can Cypher
<:happythoughts:405102851069837324>
Is this why Indians are short?
*sweats in veggie diet*
It's a lifestyle choice in the end
Also the constantly evolving language around the LGBT movement is... Hard to keep up with
Lol
I mean it happens to everyone
It depends on having a neutral moderator
Formalized debate does have winning as the objective. But it ks regimented such that you can win only by presenting logical arguments
Not always aya
Amen
<@203444794737950720> no, no specific word. Various expressions for that idea tho
Not so sure about Marathi
I know there are a few in Tamil
Probably?
As in?
And I will respect corrections made to missteps that I inevitably make
I will learn
So I will ask
As much as I respect it, it's not something that is immediate for me. It's a secondary thought, and a general desire to just respect people.
If they aren't I will be told.
I shall stick to those
Like, for now, I have a set of words which I have been told is acceptable
Defining ignorance as evil is a bit :/
Hmmm.
Not malicious in its own right
My take on it is that ignorance is a possible indicator of maliciousness
Even if it is at times
If the line is not clearly defined
But saying ignorance can be possibly malicious puts B and C in the same category
Is*
C id
B is not malicious in its ignorance
Both B and C are acting out of ignorance
This is an analogy
Person A may try their best to buy ethically sourced food, trying their best to minimise their negative impact on the environment.
Person B may just buy whatever food that's cheapest, or more convenient, because they don't have the luxury of worrying about the environment.
Person C is fond of exotic delicacies, and goes out of their way to seek them out, including trying things like shark fin.
It's a distinction that's very significant
Sure. But ignorance isn't the cause of that maliciousness
I disagree with this statement
Ignorance after a certain point is maliciousness
Topic
but yeah
<@!213645184125239317> that's sorta my point, its not ignorance that malicious, its the underlying reason for that ignorance that is
~~part of it is that I feel personally attacked by that statement given the number of things I only recently came to know of~~
Also, all of this is *not* an excuse for actions carried out in ignorance
What is that 'certain point'
It... Leads to misunderstanding
I still don't like the un-nuanced nature of the statement
Hmm.
While my blanket disagreement is flawed
Which is more positive
And instead become B to A
I just feel that not using that statement would lessen the drift of B to C
Causing them to gravitate towards being type C
In many cases, I feel that type B is assumed to be Type C
To me, only type C is malicious.
Okay.
New example.
A community has a certain specific word that has insulting connotations that have recently gained more attention. Large portions of society condemn the usage of that word or set of words. But not yet everyone, due to various issues.
Type A is a person who knows about all these connotations and actively chooses not to use said language, and tell others who do use it the reason why its a bad thing.
Type B hasn't really been exposed to it, and is in the habit of using that word because they haven't ever been told not to. However when someone corrects them, they ask why, and then proceed to make decisions based on new information.
Type C is similar to type B. But type C is like wth are you taking about, I have beem saying this for years and no one has gotten hurt, what changed now?
Don't apologize
You made a valid point
No no
Gimme a sec to think of an example that better illustrates my point?
I get you
But yeah
Some people might not care to research
Not necessarily no.
Elaborate?
Ignorance is at best an indicator
Ignorance really isn't a root cause
Which sorta is my point
Right
Nor do they have the mental luxury to do so
Sure. They don't research
To be clear, maliciously ignorant people *definitely* exist
There are many.
It's one example
Hmm
When it simply was not the case
Hell bent on destroying the country with it
There were many news articles branding sections of these people as maliciously ignorant
Farmers
Daily wage labourers
Unable to understand why they were being told to stay in place
So many people were gathering
It's particularly bad here because if the large number of people who have poor access to goid quality education
So many people were ignorant about the coronavirus spread
A very recent one
Am example from my country
Because many people are also *not* maliciously ignorant and have been branded that way
I personally think it should be.
I am watching the vid, but am basing this statement on the tl;dr above
Resulting in wilful ignorance
See that is maliciousness borne of greed and apathy
Elaborate?
(do tell me if I am pressing on this too hard)
not an inherent source of maliciousness
Wilful ignorance is a result of a flawed moral base
It can work only in the most idealistic world
Anarchy doesn't really work
this place is meant for all sorts of serious discussion, including politics
wrong channel then
anarchism is...ehhhh
Which make sense
Like the political left has a lot of good points
Nani
of *any* political view
don't listen to the assholes
there is always a lot of discourse
anyway
was wondering what that was about
Lol
Not really practical in our time
But I also accept that it has many many flaws
Like, I personally like democratic systems because of the relative value given to choice, and acceptance of the "there is no one right way" inherent to it
yes lmao
Its a great pfp
instead you choose what you value
not even close to it
No system is perfect
Which is why you have so much debate over it lec
Political views have little to do with how good or bad a person is
^
or two
just pushed back by a sem
You probably will lec
does anyone know of something that is....well better researched than this?

Always try to widen your perspective
but don't hold too hard to any one political view
i am going to need to dip out too
leading to greater class divides
America is a good example of relatively uncontrolled capitalism
Pure capitalism also has its issues
don't need to fall for any label
if they don't ring tru to you, feel free to discard them
listen to arguments
So lec, in essence
not a really good thing, people can be fairly shitty
people govern themselves
There is no government in an anarchic system
Except for cooperation between people
a society with no system at all
No
Like, for example, I abhor violence in all forms, and believe that it's the absolute last resort
*everyone*
Everyone has a set if absolute lines
I mean
It's something that happens to everyone
But it's untrue
Wouldn't call it disgusting.
You do need government regulation to break monopolies
Like amazon for example
The Free Market paves way for huge monopolies
Ah 15 then
16 iirc
Hurt*
You do nothing more people get Hitt
People get hurt
Ok
Violence doesn't mean killing
Again
You needn't *kill* them
They are a threat.
Inaction can also kill
And that is a good attitude to have
Nobody does
It won't always work
So non-violent protest worked there
Since they considered it more of a business enterprise than any real personal investment
It just become a 'not worth it' for the British empire
But fact is, the economic situation in India was already precarious
People like to praise gandhi for what he did.
But it is resistance all the same
It need not be violent resistance
But after a certain point it's impossible and you have to just resist
And definitely look to talk it out first
You need to hold your ground
Else you are setting yourself up to be bullied
If everyone shares that value for talking it out, you'll have a non-violent solution
Anyway lec, the fundamental aspects of non-violence involves both parties wanting to *talk*
This argument spiraled out of control
<:seigi:303271863683907584>
This is true
All lives are equal
However there does exist a base flaw in it
I get lec's POV
Interesting
Right
<:REEEE:357727557174558722>
<:yumiyan:230841435857879040>
How do you get someone to go for therapy
Sorry. And thanks
Thanks for the offer. I will refrain for now. If it becomes more pertinent I will bring it up again
Well. They might be. So probably not
It actually feels a bit too private to share
:/
How do I put it?
Who expressed an... Odd set of inclinations
An RL friend
So I have a friend
Until recently
Well I didn't know the difference between a bath and a shower
At least a shower everyday
Yes
>.>
It's their choice. You don't need to go an judge them over it
......
Like
Of that guy
Not nice
That is....
Selling nudes online?
Were they teenagers or something?
That guy who was busting 'sex workers'
At the very least it should be looked into
It just makes them the enemy with no chance for recourse
And. Well.
Dehumanizing *anyone* is bad imo
There is a very very clear line mentioned however
||https://medium.com/matter/youre-16-youre-a-pedophile-you-dont-want-to-hurt-anyone-what-do-you-do-now-e11ce4b88bdb||

TW: deals with pedophilia.
Deals with graphic description of CP including a toddler.

This article deals with how pedophilia is not addressed as the mental health issue that it is.
XDD
27 at night
Peak
It's about 35 degrees rn
Come on to India
Hey kerrik
Honestly if he isn't able to grasp boundaries it might be safer to just set hard ones and slowly loosen them.
I hadn't realized it was that bad
She can't even walk around her campus without something triggering a memory
She has been mauled so bad
But god
I am trying to
Like, they are having breakdowns
Badly
Cuz it's hurting them
To delete all pictures of their ex?
How do I convince someone
That sorta looks like a meme
Sucks
And now I can't meet my new friend
> I don't have an irl life though
It's a joke that tye biggest success I had in my RL interactions came in the wake of lockdown
Water lines are contaminated
Poor connectivity
No power
15 million people just in Kolkata
Bengal is gonna be the next big Hotspot
Border incursion between our countries are not at all uncommon
The army can posture with china if need be
We are far far more worried about Kolkata
No
It happens fairly often
It's normal
In one of our most belligerent states
Just as lockdown was being lifted
Social distancing and quarantine protocols have gone to shit in one of our largest metros
A border incursion in ladakh is the least of our worries
Fuck that. Kolkata was hit by a cyclone
And are both poor systems of governance
I am saying both rely on extremely narrow interpretations of what motivates people
But another extreme is not really the answer
I am not supporting capitalism
They are also kind, capable of compassion, empathy
Humans aren't *only* self interest anf greed
Where that is given far too much priority
That's another extreme
Which are powerful motivating factors for most people
And the controls in a communist system does not account at all for personal greed and self interest
Or anarcho-communism
Which is the opposite of anarchism
Are used to control people
External controls, laws, structures
Or the ability of people to work together towards a goal which those that control the government feel is good, either for them personally or for society as a whole
Becasue there is no trust in the inherent goodness of people
Other governments are forms of control
Not every government depends on it to this degree
Not really
For it to really work
As does anarchism
Communism relies too much on.... People not being dicks
But their base moral compasses are not really in the right place
They may have an occasional point
At all
Lec.
The alt right is insidious.
Just.
Not the right people to listen to
Foxes are cute yeh
Without any intention to form any views. Just listen
Or if you want mental stimulation, try to talk to people about interesting topics here just to hear views
Please, try to avoid that urge
Far more than I ever was
And you are dangerously susceptible to absorbing dangerous viewpoints in this point of life
Had I stayed there
It's very likely that I would have absorbed those views easily
I consider myself lucky that I only brushed the surface of such places and got to better ones fairly soon
For a while at least
Take a break from it lec
Infects you
It just... Makes you toxic
It serves no purpose
Then why?
But. Disturbing people?
I mean. I have a fairly high tolerance for disturbing topics
It's despicable
Like they are genuinely assholes and choose to be that way
And that is not healthy for me
I feel an uncontrollable urge to just.... I dunno *do* something
I do not wish to interact with it at all
Badly
Like
It upsets me
No
Like. It's just not nice?
The base of their thought is enough for me to understand that I don't really need to know more details
Coping or copping?
It's.... Not a nice place to be
Why do you populate those circles so much?
?
As a person
At all
Like. Not good for you
Tho that has ceased to be a problem since modi came into power
> nah we have like 7-8 political parties
*cries in 20 parties*
Because India doesn't have strong institutions in place
I dunno it feels worse here
Both sides just expecting the other to understand
There is no real discussion
Tho tbf, the entire political spectrum in India is toxic
I mean, there are echoes of it here in India
To the general rule
Have all turned out to be exceptions
Like, upto now, without exception, all the stuff that I have heard about PC, over enthusiastic feminists
Being used to justify greater atrocities
They are very *very* likely the exceptions to the rule
So I would advice you to take their 'points' with a heavy *heavy* dose of salt
Like. Again. It's not just the folks on the alt-right that generalize, but they do it on a far *far* larger scale
To justify their views
Using a horrifically small sample size
Generalizes*
The alt right genera oozes
But they are far far more common on the alt right than they are elsewhere
Those people exist everywhere
And this doesn't apply to just those in the alt-right
But god does it hurt like a bitch when it happens
You slowly get over it
<@263534352422404096> I had a situation exactly like that about 2 years ago. And. Well. It gets better.
And also so very unique to the American context
The entire debate of all lives matter above was interesting
'be proud'
So they give you a pat on the back
The meaningless effort
The trauma caused
They can't replace the lives they have lost
To not give anything if true meaning
Pride is just a construct
When you understand that it js meaningless
It just turns into disappointment
See that's the thing
Pride serves little to no purpose
You gave your life, be proud
It's such a stupid thing
At all
It gives you nothing
With *pride*
With honor?
What do you do with a medal?
Are... Well
War heroes
Because being LGBTQA+ is just....normal. Accepted
In an ideal world, the pride flag wouldn't be needed
Of knowledge
Pride month is an effort to combat that lack od understanding
People fear what they do not understand
I would just see people
Or anything else
Or trans
I wouldn't note that someone is gay
It would just be... Normal
In an ideal world?
Is better than nothing
And well, companies jumping on the bandwagon, while not really ideal
Especially in countries like mine
Is sorely needed
But the awareness that pride month raises globally
It may seem normal to you where you live maybe
To normalize it
It's something to raise awareness
It explores and explains this very same attitude that you are experiencing <@530066012242968576>
https://youtu.be/yCxqdhZkxCo
And I have a video which touches on it
It's an interesting discussion
Like many labels can apply completely independent of each other's
People forget that it's only a label. It's not the person
Labels are just so.... Weird
Nice
Ah ok
Bjj?
Huh what?
Or denouncements
No religious prohibitions
Nothing*
Literally Lothian
Except for hold overs from the British Empire
There really is nothing saying that being LGBT is wrong
Like, places like India. It's just lack of awareness
That is different
They exist. They aren't some fringe community
It's raising awareness about *people*
It's not spreading and idealogy
Pride month is needed. And it needs to be global
Loke
Not the case across the world
Martin Luther King?
Is terrifying
That
<:seigi:298839866299514880>
Is it actually possible for trump to win after all this?
Ah
Monopolies are *bad* in capitalism
Like
Capitalism also has a fundamental aspect of maintaining healthy competition and preventing the formation of monopolies
Free market is not capitalism
What rady said
And capitalism is a shitty system because it sorta simplifies it
Are not mutually exclusive
Compassion and being self centered
Loke
It's a bit more than that
<:seigi:298839866299514880>
He threatened to unleash the army on civilians
Can I just say that that's terrifying?
Uhhhhh
I just listened to Trumps address
Man
He did talk nice tho
<:yumiyan:230841435857879040>
Maybe
Hey sanders might do something
<:GWovoYayy:390538500195352578>
Hey
Emily
And you needn't reach one solution for everyone
Pick what is best for the situation
Without trying to stick to dumb labels
You can make your system such that it benefits maximum people
But, you don't need to fall into one label
It's a lot if stuff
Like
Yeah
It's upto them whether to accept it or not
He is good at being popular
Well
> Is it though, that's a very low bar
<@203444794737950720> it is because modi is... Uhhh
<:seigi:298839866299514880>
It's sorta terrifying that modi is looking better than trump
<:seigi:231411123369279488>
Second cyclone in a week
Hmm
Or belief
Has little to do with religion
Marriage is a form of commitment
At least not here
Marriage isn't exactly religious
Civil partnership doesn't usually have the same level of legal protections and rights as a marriage
Of which marriage is a part
Form a wider framework
Why get rid of it?
Marriage needn't be the only option for legally recognized commitment
Civil partnerships should be an option
There is imo
Willing to listen. But I need to frame it properly
>.>
Like. Gender dysphoria is just a disorder
To them, sex and gender aren't distinct
How do I put it?
Ugh
They are aware of gender dysphoria. But
Hmmm
To someone who hasn't ever been exposed to that concept
Like. How do I explain gender identity.
Forgive me if I am using the wrong words
That's what I mean by biological
Birth assigned gender
And how it's separate from birth assigned gender
That's not helpful because I am trying to explain it to someone who doesn't understand the latter
Can someone help me put it in proper words
Like
How biological gender and gender identity are different
I wasn't able to properly frame
;-;
Will have to discuss with them later
Ahhh they aren't on rn
Hmm
Hijras don't fall into this category per se. Like. They are usually eunuchs
Sorry
Trans people
But the hijra community of India are not exactly transgenders
~~India~~
Hmm
Backread
They really don't get it
Or identify with them
And ask them why only those born with dicks have to have those traits
Is to make them list all traits they think of as male
One thing that is occouring to me
Hmm
Bruh
The fact that gender and sex and sexuality.... Aren't really as straight forward as it has been made out to be
Because it isn't yet normalized
> they were fine with it when it was just in the back of their minds, only implied and not developed beyond small scenes
<@284390402210136064> that is often a hard thing to confront tho
Yes
But weird preference
That's not a bad thing per se
I mean, fairly sure that that exists?
(||tranny|| is a slur right?)
~~I am sorry to say I read that as erection~~
Ouch
Like legit horrible
> if we didn't shame them, they would continue to exist
<@302063351767498752> that is horrible
Honestly couldn't care less
Why are you bothered?
Okay. He is a moron
It happens every 3-4 years, vs every few weeks or months with Pakistan
Skirmishes with Pakistan are common
Everytime it happens there is a fairly large amount of tension
Skirmishes with China are *not common*
Maya
The media is trying to spin it as being something small and isolated
And modi can't look weak
Yeah but China is pushing
If not probable
But it's possible
I don't know
I don't know
That is, India and China
Not so on the other side
Like, a few soldiers losing their lives at the LAC between india and Pakistan is common
Not like this
Not China
It's usually tense with Pakistan
Much more so than usual
Indo-china war
It really will be the feather in the cap of the year of 2020
<:seigi:298839866299514880>
China killed 3 Indian soldiers today
It really doesn't belong in serious
If you really want to do so, talk to mel/lilly and do it in <#407060923078017026>
Like. I just don't. Especially in a thread that I respect for being a good place for discussion
> If you want to mock someone for being, as you call it, stupid
I don't want to be party to it
Yeah
But lec keeps coming in like that
I don't agree with them either
Yeah I get that kaiyo
If you want to mock someone for being, as you call it, stupid
Now. I get that you don't like the man's views. But I don't wish to vd party to your mocking sessions
It's the sort of things bullies do
Of*
No. There is a difference between friendly Joshing and malicious mocking.
The latter implies a non-acceptance if different mindsets
It doesn't matter who, it's just not
Especially not in a thread labelled as <#336297840529899522>
Okay. Lec.
I get that. But mocking people is generally not a good thing.
Try
But still
It's hard
The what if game
Don't play that game
They just do what they like, and importantly, don't over think
Not in exacting detail
Nobody does
> I want to be happy normally
<@302063351767498752> there is no such thing as 'normal'
They are the definition of never ending
Also mmos are a bad idea
It's something you unfortunately have to balance against other obligations
So play for a few weeks
Okay
What the rest of the world beleives in that respect doesn't really matter
And that's that
So if for you, a game is about reaching the end
Anything is about whatever you want it to be about
A simple thing about life lec
Hmm
Stuff that actually can be completed
Do short stuff then
Hmm
Just cut back for a bit
Or if you feel you are spending too much time, don't think so much
And it will get done
Okay
And you need to balance the two
Relaxation is too
Obligations are Important
But at the same time you shouldn't give up everything else to do so
So. You should spend time with the fam
<:blobsweat:522497822684217347> <:blobsweat:522497822684217347> <:blobsweat:522497822684217347>
The last time that happened there was an entire war
It hasn't escalated to war before, but no one died before
Hmm
You don't have to make adjustments Cypher
Lol
Neat
Hard to grasp. But glad it's working for you
I knew a person who was 3 different people and didn't share any memories with any of themselves
Hard to grasp as being real lol
Wow₹
Woe
How do all of you communicate?
Out of curiosity?
All of you share memories?
So many questions
Because it's an interesting chat meiyi
Brains are so complex
Lol I have a friend I call ten
Hello ten
Also. Interesting, I had not known there are multiple plural people here
And probably requires a significant amount of mental flexibility to accept and accommodate for
Because Cypher, it's hard to accept
👀
I have mine
I honestly don't know and don't care regarding debates over definitions
It is not some sort of moral obligation
I mean aria, my opinion is that its a choice
I am okay with it.
Like, leave me alone dammit
Cuz there is always one person who will ve like 'why don't you try the chicken'
I mean, I always feel wary when I eat in a mixed crowd
Lol
Despite the fact that I have repeatedly told them, no, I don't want eggs
Like, there is this one guy at work who *keeps asking me to eat eggs*
And well some of them really seek you out?
It's not even well meaning ignorance
They are fully aware and disdain it
It's even more irritating here because they legitimately and actively look down on you
I'd rather they exist far away from me
There is always that asshole who just won't respect your wishes
But it's sometimes tiring to have to y'know. Be on guard all the time
It was indeed
Cuz vegetarian, and people tend to be rather aggressive about pushing on the whys
Also regarding veggies, I tend to be defensive
Sorry don't mean to come off as antagonistic
Hm hmm
I am just pointing it's easy to accept when not much needs to be done by you
I don't doubt
America is gonna have a fun decade
<:seigi:298839866299514880>
Someone who subsists purely on meat and a very small complement of veggies is rare here
It's just part of the culture, even those who eat non-vegetarian food do so only on special occasions
You just have to look out for milk and request that clarified butter (ghee) not ve used in food prep
Tho veganism can also be easily supported
Or very few are
Nobody here is vegan
Does
Lol
Along with milk and milk products
Ovo also have eggs
Lacto is milk and milk products
Cultivated stem cells are not very different from milk imo
I have no real attachment to tastes in general
But I don't see the point of going to all thay effort for.... Well taste
I mean if it's just cultivated stem cells, sure
Maybe?
So you sorta have to have veg options
And well, nearly half of Indian are either lacto or ovo vegetarian
I never bothered to learn tbf, it didn't seem necessary in the least
I know very little about meat in general
I actually don't know what they put in burgers here
But beef isn't the only form of meat
Cows are important
Part of it
It's ironic but brilliant
Lol
Yes
A lot of veg
In India
Lol kfc has veg
It's much easier to be a vegetarian
Much *much* cheaper
Here everything vegetarian is much cheaper
Lol
They are pricey?
Veggie burgers are awesome
Plus an urge to decrease the number of things that are to die/are inconvenienced by my existence
My thing against meat is mostly a) it's really unnecessary and b) its inefficient
And doesn't harm too much during it's production
Regarding synthetic meat, I don't have a problem as such, as long as it's viable
Anyway
Also that was rude Emily
People are going to be dropping like flies here, and not because of corona
<:seigi:298839866299514880>
Pandemic
Hmm
Because bad attitudes
Bad place to be, despite actually having a lot of decent therapists
Anyway
And zero people that get her
Pulled the emergency brakes and sent her to the one place where she has zero freedom
Especially because her therapist basically blew out her life under her
It is *infuriating*
Her family be like 'baht y r u sed'
My friend has clinical depression
It's fairly horrible actually
People *do not* get mental health and mental healthcare
> lots of other problems with living in India
<@189146272865845248> jokes aside, you don't want to be in India as an autistic trans woman.
Yeah
Like, even the homeless live better in America
Yeah ik ik
General civic sense isn't there
Like
No, it's worse here
You *don't* want to be homeless in India lol
Uhhh
Manpower all across the world
India be literally exporting lol
Besides, India has a shit ton of people already
Like residence is not really easy
You do need for immigration rad
Don't go by people with different experiences, try to find people who have had similar ones
And well.... People have different perceptions and different ways of masturbating?
<:seigi:298839866299514880> <:seigi:298839866299514880> <:seigi:298839866299514880>
??
And isnt antifa a loose group of idealogies?
What does that mean?
In a lot of ways
But it's worrying
I am not prone to anxiety breakdowns luckily
Lol, dw, I will be fine
Which phrase?
?
Because if influential America still is
No, his idiocy affects fucking *everyone*
Because, like it or not, America *matters*
The possibility that trump might actually win is giving me anxiety on the other side of the world
Oh god
At this point I would not be surprised if trump actually won again and started ww3
<:seigi:298839866299514880>
America is a complete shitstorm rn
We don't have stable renewable sources
Renewables.... Work only to an extent, can't have a stable grid with only renewables
But nuclear power is the only stable source of power that we have rn that doesn't have uncontrolled waste
I dunno what left means in this context
Tbh
Nuclear power is the best source we have rn
They are criminally negligent
And their *fucking* family
And it sucks that I can't help them
I hope they get better
Yeah...
Yeah
They talk
But
Not bubbly
Especially when it is just so.... Contrary to their usual self
It's so scary
No communication
Dead
They just go..... Silent
They have to talk
Fuck
God I care for this person and it's hard to see them just.... Cut off
It's scary when they just drop off
And well. God
A friend of mine is clinically depressed
Though the information is appreciated
At all
Ahahaha.... Uhhh it's honestly not for me
If so how?
Does it ever end?
How do people.... Recover from depression
Have a question to ask
I
Oof
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089> <:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089> <:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089> <:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
Like
'You know that they are friends only to copy from you right?'
'oh I am going to meet my friends from school'
Oh, chin up buttercup!
'I am anxious about my exams'
Especially when I hear them desperately looking for that validation from them
It's *infuriating*
Like. There is a consistent history of their issues, problems, concerns and even fucking interests being dismissed
This isn't even the first thing they have ignored
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
Ugh
Just
Sorry
Yeah
I mean that in all seriousness
The first thing I said was *criminally negligent*
Who said it's an excuse
Holy fuck
Like
And they never will
They don't understand
They don't know
They are just..... Negligent
They aren't abusive
That's the sad part
AAAAAAA
Like
But it never hit so personally
I always knew
Like
I hate Indian attitudes towards mental health
How dumb must you be
Holy fuck
Like
And this is diagnosed. With medication
God
That's what's frustrating
No
You have a loving family
You can't be depressed
They deny their depression.
It's the most frustrating and downright *infuriating* thing I have ever seen
And I mean that seriously
Counselor for the university thay the person does their research at
She has legal obligations to the institution
The only reason it's legal is because she is an institutional therapist
Like. It barely fell under the self harm clause
Hmmm. A private counselor wouldn't have
Gifted mind, fucked up family and fucked up situation
This is just so *fucking* unfair
And all I can do is just talk, and vent all my frustration in other places
Thanks
Fuck. Just fucking hell
Like
Like, the details of what happened
I have been in a consistent state of horror ever since I came to know about this, about 3 months ago
And it's incredibly upsetting because she is one of the most gifted people I know
Her entire situation is so fucking unhealthy
Just *wow*
Like
Ya think???
I need to break shit
Gah
Like
Because she is being monitored
And she still has to go to that bitch
AAAAAAAAAA
Like
She really really really needs it
She needs it
But
Like, I know
FUCK
And it's just
Her trust is just broken
And now she won't go to another one
Like
Wasn't illegal
Inatitutional therapist
Her therapist broke confidentiality
Friend of mine. Same one I mentioned earlier
Like. So
Need to talk
Is anyone around?
I need...
No it isn't
Interesting
I honestly never noticed?
Oh wait male standards. Huh
That being?
Porn in general is unrealistic tho so
At least what I gave seen
It's actually fairly varied tho
They are?
> And all I can do is just talk, and vent all my frustration in other places
Hence this
Yeah
Sigh
I do what I can
It never was a plan
She's a friend
That's not a plan
Then no
If it weren't for this bitch of a counsellor
She could have easily gotten out for her PhD
(and honestly, that joke isn't appreciated since.... Idk, it makes me uncomfortable)
She is in a completely different field of study
No, I will be getting out for my masters degree
<:HibikiWhat:336656482907193344>
Together?
One more reason to get her out of this hell hole of a country
That's great
Private practitioners can't do that
Like I said, it's legal only because the counsellor was an institutional counsellor
Fucking hell
Like
That this person is 'crazy'
And she basically informed everyone on thw staff
India has unhealthy attitudes towards mental health
In so many many ways
It*
She nearly committed suicide multiple times after that because of how much ot fucked up her life
Like. And it didn't even help her. At all
That's how reality is
That's a key difference and it is important
But it's less asshole and more lack of knowledge which needs to ve corrected
Not in the least
It doesn't excuse them
No. No they don't. Not always
So understandings of consent will always be different
They just are
Because cultures, in the end, are different
Doubtful
Maybe
And the problems it causes are insane
No one gets consent properly here
And don't get me started about India
Yes
People are no longer rigid
Roles are no longer rigid
Roles of people have change
Because definitions change
I am saying, that it legitimately is a problem
I knoe you aren't
And it all comes down to a lack of understanding of how healthy interaction between genders works
It's disgusting
Oh god yes
Yes
Just different interpretations
Not otherwise
Yes
I have had poor understandings of consent
People aren't monolith
Like
Ah. Its not that obvious tho?
Poor understanding of consent, warped by differing cultural and social values
It's not weird that consent needs to be taught
Like
It needs to be *absolutely* clear
Like, regarding consent
You
It's a horrible assumption to make
Don't ever assume that
Like
It really isn't
It's frustrating to see the situation
And given the attitudes that people have towards sex in my country?
Before I ever actually did something dumb
I luckily had people who talked to me
I see it everyday, and not too long ago, was one of those people
Personally experienced
Like
I was playing with Rady
I wasn't taking it seriously
Okay, that is a meme test
<:pepehands:588063076029431829>
Hah
I am only 70% conservative
> Alright guys, it's been fun here, but it's time for me to be exiled
<@203444794737950720> begone, right-wing heretic
But at the same time, I wouldn't have thought about it unless you'd pointed it out
Schizophrenia isn't really funny
Hmm
Can I just say *wow*?
Tinder India made this for pride month
https://www.instagram.com/tv/CB76G1spK5N/?igshid=1fj42i1dvh7um

I am being impolite

Okay? Yet another moron on the internet
Ah well
The first comment
https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/hhzs8e/serious_in_opposition_of_whats_on_front_page_now/fwde4mc?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share
But that seems to be the terrifying thing about depression, you can't do anything to help other than to remove every other worry that they have, so that they can deal with it themselves
Bit of a double edged sword
From what little experience I have, just being there and reminding them that they are valued
Your first wave ended?
What the actual fuck
Liek
What sort of response is that to a person who just went through a five hour panic attack
'when you panic, dont panic'
As to just how *callous* some mental health professionals can be
And terrifying
Just fucking horrifying
It's
Not because of their personal issues but because of just how many times their trust has beem betrayed, both by their personal relations and those professionally assigned to help them
It feels sorta hard to breath when I think of what they have gone through and still aee going through
I just
And
I am talking to my friend
and if you are, just *hugs*
and I hope to god that none of you are currently in such a situation
I just want to say: Seeing an emotionally abusive family in action is one of the most terrifying things I have ever seen
Holy crap is that ugly
And it's numbers down
So. It needs to have it's usage regulated
It is, in the end, a weapon that is designed primarily to cause lethal injury and/or death
Like. Regardless of its myriad of uses
Like. Don't take the guns away, but better regulation? Please?
I cannot imagine prioritizing freedom to own and use guns over ensuring that people don't get hurt by its misuse
American gun culture will forever baffle me
Heck, my psychiatrist used to track my doses and shit
Keep your sister away from it man, its dangerous
Adhd meds are dangerous in that they are stimulants and can be addictive
Like
It's dangerous
Yeah no shit
She stole your adhd meds?
Wait
Jisu artist
The post
We don't
More like it's slowed down a little
It's improved a *lot* overall
Not even a full generation?
Compared to even 30 years ago?
And well
The world os constantly changing, for the better or for the worse
Based on lack of communication
And I have to assume
It fucking sucks because.... I can't confirm it
Suspect that my friend is having a depressive episode again
Thanks aria
Thanks mel, rady
And it doesn't fucking help that the people immediately around them are dismissive cunts
Yes, it's hard, but its needed
Nothing I can say will convince them that yes, I do want to hear about the shit that they are going through
Like
Aaaaa the hardest thing to deal with is the.... Guikt
Right. That is exactly what I want to express
The lack of communication is a lot more worrying
That I am fine with
Is it a good idea to ask a person who is coming out of a depressive episode if they are doing better now?
May not be the answer you want but.... Yeah
We just don't
Sadly
First past the post is the system used here too, and the current government is the first in the past 30 years to have had a simple majority in parliament
Its depends on how many levels of government you have
You can have local state level powers
> first-past-the-post systems end up boiling down to having two actual parties with any mathematical viability
<@160142617940590594> not really true
You carry on, and do what needs to be done
And in the end none of us are experts so our opinion doesn't really matter
Please be safe in the USA
Like, I get the logic, people are running away, making contacts hard to trace
Aaaaaa
Like
It's frustrating that my local government is withholding reports
35$ a test
yeah
its uhhh.... 35$?
and the test is not that expensive?
sure, but the requirements are fairly broad?
> Anand if you want to get tested while there is no reason to believe you had contact with sick, you'd probably need to pay out of your own pocket
<@203444794737950720> okay?
That's not much of a problem here, government testing centers exist
Okay that's a dick move
Bruh
Like, fuck him
But, regardless. Its good for you?
He is an asshole
Got tested through contact tracing, and tested positive
Attributed it to asthma
I had an extremely minor tightness of chest
Its good to be safe Anyway?

Duda lost?
> It hurts.
<@!263534352422404096> It doesnt hurt. it feels quite uncomfortable though
Wow that is razor thin
huh 49-51
Bad wording on my part
?
Duda is the PiS
nani?
And the person in question doesn't even have attributes that are very far from the general population, they are just smart and driven
> Don't praise them too much though
<@354236264595324928> don't pamper them, yeah. But there is a difference between reprimanding and forcing someone into a mould they just do not fit
Oh saki is back!
> I'm sure the situation Anand is talking about is one that was emotionally abusive
<@170641480791228417> yes. Well, more like is
Because not doing that, forcing them into a mould that they don't fit into is the most damaging fucking thing you can do to them
Praise your children folks
To deal with someone you value being excessively self depreciative
It's extremely hard
Greed wins, because it is not concerned with lifting everyone up with them

Damn
And that's just.... Appropriate

Am aware, not Comparing to that. Just, different form of suffering to see someone you care for going through it amd just... Withdrawing
Depression is terrifying to observe/be close to
But yes. I hope you can move on from it
Maybe she legitimately can't move on from it, and was asking you to accept it.

<@!222517038042710017> Yeah

Technically, I live below poverty by American Standards
Poverty line be high in America
*huh*
What is the poverty line in America?

The 12k pa min wage listed is wrt one person
Also, that document listed minimum wage thresholds for different family sizes
especially in government run unis, which tend to be the best in the nation
But there are a lot of economy based grants here?
So not something I can do on minimum wage without taking a huge loan
and a graduate course is typically 8 sems
5k per sem in the top governement institute
But a government institution costs about....1/3rd? less?
> I have a hard time believing that minimum wage used to be able to get someone through an accredited university.
<@!263534352422404096> so a private university here, like the one I went to cost the equivalent of 62 grand?

don't go into friendships and relationships looking for it

Uhh. Word of advice?
Marriage is a huge commitment? With a lot of connotations?
Tbf, you need social groups, and that usually happens in Uni, its rare outside of it

You apparently have to go out
its only going to hurt you

No. but there may not be a choice.

hmm
Not depression
Treat it for functionality, yes

>.> Nobody is telling you to do that
okay

choose one person, talk one on one
I didn't say don't talk
I mean, talk in private
N0
Because people will keep triggering you
Meanwhile, in India, we are getting 60k new cases everyday
I mean. There certainly are patterns
That is ridiculous
wat
Society has been ordered around those labels for so long, that people are uncomfortable in facing the fact that the labels aren't rigid or comprehensive
what you are saying rad
> People confuse the label with the person
This
pretty weapons
I just saw weapons, not something inherently masculine or feminine
Huh
I see it now.
Ah
Also <@!170641480791228417> what is the conflict in that image?
as far as I have seen it atleast
But it is
see what?
even though they aren't really boxes,
Meiyi is Meiyi. But society is designed along the boxes of male and female
People confuse the label with the person
thinking of stuff a fuzzy, or a spectrum of intersecting patterns, thats hard
Its easy to understand things that way, but as a result, nuance is lost
Because everything in society is mostly framed as a dichotomy <@!170641480791228417>
I agree
yep
Well, if you just opened up something like say, boxing to everyone, it would still end up amab dominated, because testosterone
Basically, shit be confusing, and we have been trianed to think with certain boxes, some people fnd it a lot harder to break out of that thinking than others, and react negaitively
or men for that matter
neither of those things need to be related to women at all, is what meiyi is saying
See that is the thing
> Not have to justify why I'm allowed to train martial arts and then put on lipstick a few hours later
dont people do this all the time?
it sometimes is an effort to supress the urge to gender stuff
for sure
I have been annoyed because of it
most of the largest languages are fairly strongly gendered
Right
Similarily, it seems to extend to everything for a lot of people
Cuz the name richard is very strongly associated with males
I would have a hard time not misgendering her
If aria were named, say richard
like, at least that name has always been used to refer to male people, we have a lot if gender neutral names
which is so weird to me
yeah
except on a much wider scale
So it's something like that, people associate traits very stringly with certain exected behaviours
but the moment I start using her name, I start using male pronouns with it
I don't even have to think about it
no problems
when I am writing without her name
like, right now?
because I so stringly associate her name with the opposite gender
and ever since she expressed her desire to be identified as female, I have found it exceptionally hard to not misgender her
and has a *very* male name
A friend of mine, she was introduced to me as male
I actually have an interesting problem here relating to this
thats about it
Its the way meiyi thinks
can we?
i mean to say, we cant use male or female to describe you in most cases
and can't really be grouped
that is just plurality then, all of you are different
ahh
I actually have an interesting problem myself
People certainly can be grouped based on certain traits, but there always is going to be bleed over
both of you will hurt for it
not because you feel she will be disappointed if you dont
respond because *you* want it
like, if you respond to something
You don't need to worry about that, if she really wants to, she will pursue it, as long as you don't string her alongm it's fine
and thats okay
to really put in effort to change it
Maybe. You just were probab;y like, meh, if it happens, alright, and when it didn't happen, you never really wanted it enough to pursue it with this person
Yeah
but not a long term thing where you start something committed
Maybe fun and games and erotic stuff
It means you are (maybe) not really interested in a relationship with that person
Nothing wrong with you
Except Israel is at a later stage
>.> this sounds so much like the situation here.
Millenia of history if bad blood
Heck, India's Islamophobia is similar looking to the israel situation
Purpose of a counsellor is someone neutral, and more importantly, trusted
Can they even help?
Its a toxic situation where they are both hurting each other but no resolution
Where neither side is really blameless, but neither can they easily resolve their issues
Is it appropriate for me to compare the situation in Israel to a failed marriage with no option for divorce?
Solo
But typically asian in the west seems to refer to people having oriental features
Tbf, I too am 'Asian'
Okay. As long as you are aware that yes, that is a stereotype and are not using that as a tag to categorize people beyond absolute surface characteristics, I feel it's fine
It's a stereotype
And I don't really think that is all bad
So he will have a stereotype based on what he has most been exposed to
Basically, Rady has not been exposed to all these people abd cultures
Heck, there are at least 20 different types of indians that I can generally identify
And that's a lot of different people
More I think
It's like. Half of the world pop
Eh. Even in looks, Asian is sorta.... A lot of people
Yeah
And exploitation
Think of an entire series of cultures that implicitly encourages such relationships
Yeah? You think that's fucked up?
> There is no "to be completely fair" about pursuing people from a culture because you think they're easy to boss around, jesus
There sorta is a reason for that perception that is chilling to me. Which was what I was talking about.
But whatever
I come from such a culture. I hate it, but I also see it
Sorry
Ouch?
>.>
It is not a bad frame of reference in a more homogenous environment
Which this server is
Actually, it's a bad frame of reference in a multicultural environment
Huh really?

(the results of violence are not always desirable, but it undeniably brings out change. Regardless of what the change is)
The internet is more effective at bringing about change than anything other than actual violence
And mixing and homogeneising
And along with it, the results of different cultures clashing
The amount of cultural progress and change that is taking place because of it is so damn high. Stuff that usually changes over generations is changing over the course of a few years
And that is *insane*
Compared to what existed even 2 decades ago
On a very *very* close level
The internet has suddenly connected a lot of clashing people and cultures
Like
Because we were less connected
And that is one part of the toxicity
The internet.... Is not regulated like how the real world is.
People don't have to take responsibility for what they say in most cases.
And well, some people believe they are entitled to that
They are reacting like... People on the internet do
Lol
Oh of course not
Regarding the earlier discussion on how people are being a bit stubborn regarding the usage of the word trap.
Its... Well. A sudden change. And many people don't get why its bad or offensive because in most cases they just haven't been exposed. And most people have an inherent resistance to change.
> It allows people to quarter themselves off in small communities with homogenous views and ignore the opinions of others while assuming they're in the majority in a far more efficient manner than they could in a real life setting
<@278860841485598720> sure it does. But the sheer density of people means that there is still bleed over of ideas and general attitude of more acceptance of differences. Not all differences, because some biases are just too deeply rooted, and people gravitate towards like. But there always are differences, large ones too.
You always will have radicals, and the scale on which they can act is also aided by the net. But the amount of cultural bleed over that the internet brings out far far outweighs these groups of people.
China is quite rightfully afraid of it, and does it's best to control the free flow of information
So maybe 1k including all overheads
Oof
Wow kissanime died
On a usable streaming service
I really wouldn't mind paying for anime and anime merch if they actually took the fucking effort to make it accessible outside Japan
Which is *especially* bad because they also have a tendency to.... Ignore what is inconvenient
Takes any implication of support from outside the family as an insult
Because it takes affection for granted
Which is... Harmful
They follow an outdated system of well... Family
They are...
They aren't intentionally dicks
I hate this country sometimes
Thanks
That always is going to be the case, for as long as they live
Yeah..
Yeah
I can't even call and check on them
It is *annoying* that I am not able to do that because of the presence of complete assholes in their lives who hold more control over them
That's the thing, I have accepted that there is nothing I can say to help. But... Just presence helps
> Just try to do whatever you can, offer to be there and if they text you at work try to text them back a time you can talk at
Yeah.. Yeah I know. Is what I am doing
I cant even call if I wanted to

Question: a family member calls you, a trained medical Profesional, asking for medical advice

(a note: in general, y'all are too sensitive to alt-right buzzwords which are common mostly in the states, and not separating them from the idealogy behind it, which is, in general, *not* welcome in this server. A little trust in intent guys, atleast on this server)
It is
So saying black lives matter too... Just makes it clearer
To people not fully within the context, it confuses stuff
> most people using "Black Lives Matter" are fully aware that **all** lives matter
<@189146272865845248> problem is, this only is understood by those who already understand racism, or are directly exposed to it
> It doesn't matter if you're not from the US. The words have a meaning outside of your control.
<@170641480791228417> sure, and ve aware that not everyone will know it. At least here, mods are pretty damn active in making sure assholes don't stay. So, some trust in intent is warranted
I don't think anyone is denying that
It as simple as that

> It's not a matter of "all I said was x" because words have meaning in the context of their society and culture.
<@170641480791228417> and we are an international, and multicultural server
Alright.
It may have been a sensitive topic for her. She should have disengaged
I would like to point out, that barring a couple of mild warnings, shemmy was not really chastised for accusing someone, at various points, of being a rape apologist, a nazi and many other things, and otherwise not contributing to the discussion.
Imagine if China unironically won
How do you even attempt to convince someone that there is good in them
Zero self esteem
Like
How do you help someone with no faith in themselves
Just talking about it, discussing it, helps suss out stuff
Out*
Keep talking and you'll figure stuff oit6
> They don't really know themselves
<@676272618839605249> they don't need to
And they have to be willing to share
You'll have to talk to the person in a lot more detail
Depends on how the fear manifests
But it's fun
People are sensitive about things and given that this is public, in general, we sorta have to be more careful in what we say and how we say it, and it may occasionally not work, given how diverse this place is
<@456226577798135808> I occasionally feel that way. But I also know that none of the criticism, however sharp it may be, comes from a place of maliciousness
It's funny how something as simple as masks somehow became political
Sex, maybe not
Ah. For me it's fairly high
At least not for me
But I don't think a relationship can survive being purely online because some things just can't be done online
It being online doesn't make a difference in that
They always will
I don't get sick of the people I am intimately familiar with
Not a general trend
That.... Is you mate
It just progresses to a point of comfort where you either accept it or stay close and move on
No, not really
That you got sick of them is a bad sign
And keeping a commitment through purely online interactions is hard
And that is part of the effort
I am saying, for it to progress beyond a certain point, you sorta need to meet up
I didn't? Blame a computer?
But I don't actually feel that I know a person without actually meeting them at least a few times
I can share a lot online
Rather than an image or a series of texts
I feel more comfortable with a person in person
It still takes effort
It being online doesn't make it any more easy or difficult
That is true
Maybe you've had a better experience than I have
Agree to disagree shemmy. My personal experience is that it doesn't work
You get to know a very limited aspect
You don't actually get to know a person through the veil of online interaction
Something that can't be done in an in-person relationship
But it is far easier to hide and present yourself a certain way when you have control over all the variables that are being presented to the person you are talking to
I am not saying they don't?
As well as the support you can provide without being physically there
It's just incomplete, the image that you form
This
It can start there, sure
A relationship can't stay purely online
It can only supplement a relationship, online interaction, not be the basis of it
Okay, it's just missing a vital component of actually getting to know a person
It's....
Online relationships don't work
In any relationship between people
I don't think it works for me, and I find it hard to believe that it works for people given the importance that physical intimacy and presence usually has
I don't see it as inherently superior
And many people are like that
To me, the simple gesture of a hug provides far more comfort than any online interaction
And familiar with online interaction
Everyone os definitely not online
That is stupidly america centric
Also no
That isn't really different from irl coca
Emojis and images don't cut it
Nah. I can't provide comfort without words online
Online?
For me
Like. It is for every relationship, not just romantic ones
And being able to support the person when they need it
But dependancy and ability to talk without feeling awkward are things i value
In the end, you need to find that perfect compromise
It depends on people
Regardless of where they take place
Indeed they are
True, hard to avoid them sometimes. It sorta slips out
In hindsight, i should have said 'for me' in my initial statement
And all of it needs effort
It will work, but its harder to maintain it
But, imo, any relationship is incomplete if it focuses too hard on just one aspect of a relationship
Previously it was && Sub&
The older one is not
This one is
Wait no
No it's not
Lol
I should revert to the real me
XD
<:GWovoYayy:390538500195352578>
Hey Emily
I am the sub occ
Something I have only with family and a couple of friends
I like the comfort of presence with no questions asked
Some people like the space
Not everyone is like that
I did say personally for a reason
I can do my own shit, they can do theirs
I don't need to talk or do anything
I personally like being able to be... Passively there
I mean, over the past couple of generations, the breadth of choice has been increasing rapidly
And you don't really need one to live a satisfying and happy life
There is a lot more to life beyond looking for a partner
So relationships don't need to be the primary focus of people
People are more individualistic
And options
That's the thing, the past couple of generations, people have a lot more choice
> honestly the best thing you can probably encourage them to do is get professional help if it's that bad. There's only so much you can do
 oh how I wish this was a viable option
How does one deal with a friend saying something distressing that you have no idea how to deal with
What's worse is just how *blind* some of the educated middle class are
But it still isn't enough
The power in legal circles is skewed towards women, especially in cases of domestic abuse
But the traditional mindset doesn't see women as anything more than housewives, and it's incredibly disheartening to see
People are directly incentivized to have and educate more female children
Education for women is mostly free in government institutions
I will say that much has been done to combat it
It is hard to leave a country after all
Doesn't mean they get the opportunity
Nearly every educated one
Yes lol
India is a breeding ground for incels
But people still have insanely backward attitudes towards women and relationships
Mind you, it is improving, and has improved a *lot*
And just thinking of expressing yourself or breaking from the mold is... Hard
As a woman, you are just culturally repressed from birth
It's so hard to explain
The *culture* is not
The legal *structure* is relatively biased towards women
Like
So legally, she could have gotten divorced
Still doesn't change the fact that it a pervasive part of our culture
At the very least, all the governments starting from the very first recognized the poison that it was and did a *lot* to combat it
Or rather, was
Also, i am not that surprised by that headline, the government banned prenatal sex determination tests because of how common female infanticide is
> is domestic violence commonly overlooked in india?
<@183785454447886346> the environment is such that it is passively encouraged
In a lot of places
India is about 3 generations behind on women's rights
> You know divorce is always an option
<@399293953171521549> no
..... So
While *most* people are normal, helpful people, the culture is such that people who commit crimes against women are not punished as strongly as they should
Basically, if you are a woman, avoid India
Just because it's rarer in their circles, they dont believe that it's a systemic problem
And I think I am about to start pushing a lot harder for it
They can. They won't
I have no idea how to help them break it
Aaaaa
How does one respond to someone saying that they are spiralling
And they have the money too
Surrounded by friends, full indpendance and therapists are taking appointments
It's all them now
Parents have zero control now
They are back at uni
Situation changed
Enough is enough
Is*
Doesn't mean gender as a concept it bad
Simple
And that is changing
The problem with gender is that the identity is forced upon people who don't necessarily identify with all parts of it
It gives me common ground with others
I identify as a fan of Fanfiction
I mean
Identity is not some fixed thing
And modified fo fit our broadening perspectives
It's not only a social construct, and yes, it is not fully understood, especially in these times when it's very basis is being questioned
However, many people are quite comfortable in their identity
Lec, you don't *need* to identify with a specific gender
Which is very surprising
Weirdly enough, the number of active cases is dropping here
At least in Delhi
Antibody tests in Delhi indicate that as of July, upwards of 40% of the population had already been infected
Heck, I am quite sure that reported numbers are a lot higher than tge actual numbers
I would know, I live there
Yep yep
~~India is doing better than the states though I don't trust the numbers~~
True
So it can do shit that other countries can't, and has a competent govt to boot
China has the control to do rather extreme things regardless of what it's population feels
Most of Europe is doing better than the states. And they do have a larger pop density than the states
Not implausible
Meanwhile, India seems to have a decreasing case count. No idea how tho
War*
They practise the *threat* of wat
They are powerful, but actual war runs counter to their goals
Doubtful
Something I wanted to say about all this.
Attraction to a teenage minor is not pedophilia. Ir certainly is *bad* to act on it, mainly because of differences in power.
Imagining up a relationship with a character known to be a minor is definitely questionable, but, to me, isn't inherently wrong. But it blurs the line on your mind, and you can normalize abuse irl. And Japanese media is quite bad about that. It actually encourages pedophilia. Not just with barely there work arounds, but explicit CP in art and  doihinshi
<@84811738653929472> go to a specialist. If it's strong enough to make you feel this uncomfortable, no harm in getting it looked at. If it turns out that you are a normal but fringe case, yay! Else you can get treatment for it.
Also, resources are nowhere near limited, just locked behind a paywall

I left soon after
Like just. Wat
It was a fem domme server
This was the response I got from the mod team

Bruh
I was like
A server I entered had pronoun roles behind a paywall
I just got hit by some hard-core.... Idk what to call it
I think it's the same bot as the old kirika
Like. Sorta like the card game we used to have?
Economy bot shenanigans
Basically you could buy roles with coins from the bot
(the pay wall wasn't actual currency, in server tokens was the currency)
Hi!
A friend of mine has developed an app to aid people who fight against OCD in tracking their compulsions.

Everyone is
To answer this, Patriarchy is the system in which people are locked into roles based on their gender, with males occupying the position of power over other roles
simply because of the roles Patriarchal society casts us into
Women in general find it much harder to reach the same position
No not really
for sure
And women need special consderation
and needs to go
Patrirachy is a *problem*
Ah. I wasnt trying to do that
It's not "Men need to be treated equal to women", but more like, dont use Patriarchy as an excuse to be an asshole
They need privileges in society to battle the millennia of  being treated as inferior, to battle the huge amount of systemic bias
Like. There is no denying that
Women *need* to be treated better
The point of that, was that while men definitely are privileged, it doesn't justify people acting like assholes, and then using "Men have had it good" as a justification

Hugs for you <@!189146272865845248>

thats one more than half
Thats not over represneted
Okay, thats good then
How many members of the court? Like actual numbers
Ooo
not as a driver at least
Not that I know of
Has there been a woman in F1?
That is likely work cultures exacerbating the differences in roles. 
Any work culture that devalues home life will have fewer women in it
so not going to comment about it specifically
I don't know about Germany
Germany does well ngl, relative to most other nations
I live in India
I dont live in the States
literal opposite
no they aren't
Uh what?
It will *always* skew higher towards men
Look at the proportion of men to women in those positions <@!181831124958445568>
but its still all fairly biased towards men
Western society is a bit more egalitarian
just the degree varies
Literally everyone
Hmm?
But getting hydrogen is hard
Fuel Cells are good yes
EVs are just a lot lot better in a lot of ways
It will get there soon enough

At the rate at which vaccinations are being administered in the states, it should be a lot better in the upcoming months
Content Warning: Mentions ||Rape||

||So in Uttar Pradesh, one of the states of India, they have implemented an active anti-porn watch. Pornographic content was already banned, but they will be monitoring searches and stuff.
The kicker? 
This is an "Anti-Rape measure" 
This frustrates me because our people are already repressed sexually, and severely uneducated. While porn is a horrible place to learn shit, it's also like, the only semi-healthy outlet that many people have, and suppressing that while having literally zero sex ed is going to do absolutely nothing to reduce rape||
Honestly I should change 'women' to 'every person who isn't cis-het male'
-_-
perceiving broader issues is hard
Thats human nature
thank you? I guess?
Oh I read that as biased for a sec lmao
Like, the exact same thing happens here
heck, even I don't fully get it, for sure
the nature of privilege is that it's difficult to perceive the problems of those who don't have the same privilege
Dude, even here, it is difficult to perceive
Doesn't change the point I made. May be more difficult to perceive, but it's very much present
but still not at all equal
it is *better*
I don't think so. Sure India is quite a bit more misgynistic than most other nations, but what I have heard from women in far more egalitarian nations also doesn't speak to true equality
but distrust? don't blame them in the slightest
collective hate, of course, is always unjustified
Like. It's frustrating? But I don't think women are wrong to be distrustful of men as a whole
Yeah. That is true. and, tbh? It's justfied. In nearly all places in the world, guys occupy a position of privilege wrt women, and rarely, if ever, realize it, and often act in ways that perpetuate systemic biases against women, laying a pretty solid basis for collective distrust
Hmm yeah
🤔
At least, large ones
EV isn't compatible with that
different operating principle
they use Jet Engines
and Aircrafts don't use ICEs
ICE tech can maybe break 50% efficiency, but there are other techs that have much hgher efficiencies, that scale up well.
there are techs with much higher efficiencies
Like
Or make ships large enough that they can go for a full powerplant on board
Solution: Go nuclear
huh that *is* inspired
Using the Turbo as an electric gen
Uhhh
it *can't*
Thats the thing
the tech is so oversaturated lol
like
There isn't much need for dev in that field tho
and they really do need to be phased out
But like. We don't need *developement* in ICEs
And Also, energy density issues related to battery storage tech are being worked on. It's one of the most active areas of research
And like. Umm. Global Warming affects everyone?
It isn't the *largest* contributor, but it's a fairly significant one
so, increasing taxation on ICE and emissions is sorta necessary.
So a lot of ICE can def be replaced by EV
Nor do they need more than 150km of range as they stay within the city
You don't need a super expensive setup to make it into one either
almost all Autos are now EVs
Heck, take Delhi fr example
EV for last mile coverage, Public transport for long distance
but low level private vehicles can def be replaced by EV and good public tranportation
you still need ICEs
Yes, heavy duty especially
the only reason there aren't as many affordable options was because the entire industry was dragging its feet
And EV tech is growing pretty damn fast
As someone who directly works in the automotive industry: ICEs are dying, saturated tech
Nahh I doubt it will work on the scale that shipping takes place on these days
More this than anything elsw
And secondarily to others around you, but that's not as important as your self worth
And I honestly hope that you are able to move past the pain and hurt within you, and survive, because you are inherently valuable, to yourself
<@189146272865845248> I know it doesn't help but *hugs*
It's okay to have changing surface beliefs as long as the core is stable
I have told this to you before my man. Pick a solid baseline reasoning and system and evaluate all info based on that

yeah >.>
so
Attraction may happen, action based on attraction is inexcusable, which is what those tagging themselves as MAP are trying to acheive
Pedophilia is a mental condition. Those calling themselves MAPs are trying to validate their harmful actions and ideas instead of controlling and moderating themselves
I would actually class MAP as worse than Pedos
And MAP isn't pedophilia. It's a term that validates exploitation/abuse of minors under the idea of attraction. Which is *wrong*
Banning all discussion just allows those influenced by harmful ideas to fall further into spaces that allow it's glorification
no  glorification
and reasons for why it is
discuss it, as the negative thing that it is
like
Thats healthy imo

and not cuz hes gay
a lot of people apparently dont like varadkar
I have no idea lmao I read it somewhere once
yee lol
or whatever
the taseoeach
Yee ik
Varadkar?
Why are all the pubs so loud here mate
👀
wait sapphire is in Ireland?
not malicious to the main target but to others associated
Idk, my experience with cancelling is that it tends to turn malicious. I prefer not to use that term when referring to action taken against people
the conservatives yes
Cancelling, to me, has the specific connotation of a boycott movement that becomes malicious
you dont enforce your choice on others in a boycott
of course it is
like, cancelling is a *lot* more active
Boycotting is *not* cancelling
and its a lot more nebulous, a strike has a defined target
which is what happens in cancelling
Yeah, you dont threaten people into strikes
oh labour strikes
strikes?
people with equally or even more loud voices
There are many powerful transphobes unfortunately, not just JKR
not at all productive
and leads to all sorts of judgemental shit
it leads to so much more resentment than is necessary
I do
as well
it is targetting people who happen to enjoy the content
No cancelling is quite a lot more active
and that is happening
the more people that disengage the better
the best thing to do is just disengage
And like
Another one?
Really?
they were supposed to be perpetually at war with wizards
Also given how goblins were portrayed in the universe, that doesnt sound very surprosing
and I dont care
I dont follow JKR
👀
I wanna talk man 😭

Also a brilliant investment in Ireland would be a pub with *quiet* music
Yes that
fair fair
national strikes in India *are* crippling, with turnouts going in the hundreds of millions at the well attended ones
For a national strike in India, thats pretty tame.
There are actually similar issues with batteries, they don't last long enough, especially under constant charge and discharge cycles
You aren't necessarily right in that baseload needs to be stable. It actually is sorta the other way round, you need capacity to fit in peaks, which doesnt need to generate at that capacity. Basically factors of safety. You can still have majority or even all generation on renewable, as long as excess capacity exists from more stable forms of energy that can be brought online quickly. And that doesnt even need to be nuclear, there are actually a lot of solutions that are viable, mainly around usage of biofuels over conventional fuels. A lot of them just havent reaches the economies of scale needed, rather than any real technical difficulty. Basically corporations going 'But I don't want to lose money *first*'.
Also regarding flywheels: They don't work not because of energy density but because of longevity. You cant really do much more than store a few minutes worth of energy in a flywheel because it dissipates *way* too quickly. Practically installed flywheel energy storage systems for grid level storage can't store more than half an hour's worth of energy before the dissipate most of it. In rapidly changing environments (like say, a car) where the load is going up and down really fast, it is very useful for balancing, but not as much on a grid scale, where you, quite often, need to store *hours* worth of excess energy generation
~~I know I am summoning a convo from the dead~~ But citizenship in Ireland at least is....actually relatively easy if you have qualifications?
If you qualify for critical work, you can get PR in 2 years, citizenship after 5 years of PR.
otherwise, you qualify for PR in 5 years
LMAO
In the end, power is still centralized
It had a bunch of issues of its own creation
Russia, again, did it's own thing
Yeah
Historically, other countries trying to impose their systems of thought has not worked very well
for better or worse, China made it's own mistakes and rose up from it
And that is an inherently colonialist attitude
the League trying to 'Institute' democracy would not have made things any better
so no
I am not trying to argue mao was better or worse, just that the KMT would not really have been a boon in any way, and would have likely made different mistakes, which might have been just as bad
and Taiwan democratized *very* recently
Based on how they were, it wouldn't have done much. They were massively corrupt
It would have been an even more drastic failure
Basically those who took the helm after mao died and streered the country to where it is now, before Xi took over
at least the communist party had people outside his cohort who cared for the people in some way and took power afterwards
they werent much better than Mao and his cohort
I mean
What became Taiwan?
The republic?
and thus easier to pin a target on
(For the record, china is still *very* bad cuz no systemic protections *at all*)
China is just more open with their hypocritical nature
not much else
Nahh, not really.
To be frank, the only saving grace for western nations is freedom of media and media protections
Nahh not US created, Colonialism created
for all it's issues, where they are now is fairly admirable, from an economic stand-point
people can succeed....to an extent
That is sorta one thing that China is doing right, they liberalized their economy....but still maintain tight control over it
And the russian federation failed because crucially, the power centralized under the USSR remained centralized, except there was now no tying concept or greater 'goal'. It was all 'everyone for themselves', and that is exactly what they did
and stopped compensating for the failure of the centrally planned economy
The main reason it collapsed was not the US directly, but the failure of their economy when oil prices crashed
Their centrally planned economy didn't have the necessary local insight to actually be effective
They were heavily dependent on oil
Not really
might have been acedemically interesting yee
it's a big what if anyway
for better or worse
which probably why it would have collapsed faster
It likely would have collapsed fairly quickly tbh
in the form of money and corporations
the power is just centralized differently
the west suffers from the same problem
I mean
There are not many systems to direct that centralized power, and what little was there is being stripped back away
and thats the issue
and yes I was alread aware of their overbuilt rails and huge debt issue
more flexibility
It is much better than the soviet style centrally planned economies
I never said it's *perfect*
Cars are trending smaller, lighter and more efficient as population densities rise
Huh. No actually, it's the opposite in most of the world
which country
like
where are you?
huh
Ahh
most engines are like, 1.2L to 1.4L
Ah. ICEs are pretty much at the limit of how small they can be without being *too* small for minimum torque to start moving
That's an...interesting opinion
What isn't true?
It doesn't fix the issues causing violence. The countries having guns and the little bit of gun violence associated have those issues stemming from other issues, guns being present or absent doesn't change that
Reducing that requires other changes, not having guns just pushes people to other weapons
The NRA and republicans pandering to far right nuts are th3 ones who muddle the conversation. And I still do not see how gun violence specifically is different from violence of other kinds
And restrictions are being put in place. Nobody with common sense, including most gun owners in the US are against regulation.
Yes it is indeed insensitive. Especially because that isn't their primary purpose. And especially because there are a lot of countries that have high levels of gun ownership.
Anyway. I will still stand behind the fact that discussing it from the POV of complete bans os counterproductive and insensitive
Not people
Umm. Safety in the context of wild animals
And guns also are tools. They are used for hunting, by vets, for safety in certain area
It is very much a weapon, it being a tool aside
And all of which are also restricted in usage
All of which have recreational and professional uses
Much like a sword. Or a bow and arrow. Or a hammer
Nah. They are tools
Guns aren't inherently destructive or bad. Restrictions and regulations are necessary and need to be pushed for
Yes, violently changing culture jas worked *beautifully* in the past
And completely ignorant of its culture
It's counter productive
Well yeah, less guns equals less violence with guns. But like. That's just an unrealistic goal in the context of the US, for so many many reasons
How is gun violence different from other forms of violence
Homicides per 100000 population in 2020 was 0.5 in Switzerland, 1.2 in UK, and 1.02 in Australia
By nearly half
Also: rate of violent crime in Switzerland is far lower than in UK and Australia
That's the point
They don't restrict
They control
And how they can be owned
Because they have very stringent control on how guns are used
And nowhere near the same history of gun related violence
But it also has one of the highest proportions of guns wrt people
Switzerland, for example, has very high regulation of guns and gun ownership
And I agree. That doesn't equate to a ban however.
In addition to being unfeasible, it also isn't necessary to bring down gun violence.
There are several examples of countries with lots of guns but no history mass shootings the same way. Switzerland and Germany come to mind. 
It requires more consistent gun control laws. Which this is at least starting to do. It requires a change in the mindset towards guns, and more emphasis on training users, tracking ownership and ammunition, etc.
Calling for bans is just... Counterproductive. It acheives nothing and just polarizes people. And also calling for a gun ban will, as Rakhi said, exacerbate a bunch of systemic inequalities that already exist. Additionally there are a bunch of legitimate uses for a lot of guns.
There is just... No need to take away everyone's guns. There is however, need for more stringent and consistent gun control
In that banning is solving part of the problem that is
Hmm. I am not sure I agree with you. But I am content to agree to disagree on that specific point
Parts of it at least
Well. At least in Europe they are
Aren't cars restricted already?
The goal should be zero homicides in general, hyperfocusing on guns specifically doesn't solve it
I do not see why gun homicides are different from homicides of other kinds
Again
I mean. I am not arguing against restricting usage, I am arguing against bans being the end goal
Indeed
Australia isn't the US 👀
Different context, different culture, different systemic issues
That's sorta the point
It isn't as simple as 'Take the guns away and the crime reduces' either
It isn't however BS that violence rates specifically are not directly correlated to presence or absence of guns.
All of those things are needed
The works
Background checks
As well as storage, purchase of ammunition
Restrictions are 100% needed. Consistent rules surrounding ownership and training
Which is dumb
Yeah no, the NRA uses that to twist the narrative and argue against restricting gun ownership and usage
this isnt even sarcasm
*please*
Yes, pls invest in public transport
Yeah. I did react strongly, I apologize for that. I have seen the negative effects of arguing and implementing along strict moral lines rather than acknowledging the fact that moral values are never consistent amongst a population, except in the broadest of strokes.
yeah
for a multitude of reasons
I mean, I have made it particularly clear that I am very much in favour of gun regulation
and efforts always should be taken to limit the affect of your decisions on people around you
Rule of thumb: There is no compromise when your decision affects more than just you
But arguing for it from a moralistic point of view is going to get no one anywhere
In relation to guns: There are a *bunch* of very valid reasons for heavier regulation
Arguing along strict morals is reminiscent, to me, of heavily religious modes of thought, and black and white thinking. The biggest non-religious example that comes to mind is vegans.
There are a *bunch* of valid reasons for veganism, it's something that I myself aim to move towards, but arguing for it as a moral failing of those who arent raised or dont fall the same way polarizes and alienates people, and gives the entire thing a bad reputation, and rightfully so: You aren't respecting people's right to not agree with you, especially as it relates to personal decisons
Apologies for that. It was a moment of reaction.
I do not like heavily moralistic arguments being made in relation to any form of regulation. It very often leads to perpetuation of widespread systemic issues, and closing off of minds to legitimate differences.
I will clarify why I brought it up then: The reason I brought it up was to emphasize that morality, in this case, is relative, especially as it relates to animals and animal rights, especially those that are wild.
Imposition of laws based on relative moral values that are *not* collectively agreed upon is problematic
without disproportionately high volumes of gun related violence
Switzerland (and many countries in Europe) have effective gun laws that allow citizenry to use guns
investigation of storage capability, safety from underage/non-licenced users, not allowing weapons to be passed on un recorded, etc.
Like, more effective liscensing, separate tracking of ammunition sales and use
People get paranoid, and empower the nuts who want little to no regulation
but not really an argument against banning guns. Conversing in that direction just polarizes the viewpoint and doesnt lead to any effective solution.
Much more than what is practiced
Like, yes, perpetuating societal harm, hence why regulation is needed
Irrelevant. That is, in the end, relative moral views, and imposition of personal values on others is an issue
Like, I am not defending gun nuts, but they form a very small and loud proportion of gun users, most people do want effective regulation of gun use
Point being? 
People eat meat on a daily basis, defense against wildlife and occasional hunting is not really very different. More humane tbh, it gives animals more of a chance and isnt organized slaughter
also: dynamite was and still is used for mining
very few countries have literally zero guns and they dont really need to
any country that isnt america regulates gun use rather effectively
Regulation is def needed tho
recreation is also a use, especially in controlled environments (like gun ranges)
Hunting, self defense against wildlife, especially in areas of low population density
Yes they do
Not the actual coops (which are usually fairly small)
Like, when I say land use, I mean land used for growing food for poultry
Poultry has land use issues though. Food has to be grown for poultry
Per unit mass moved, it's pretty insane, the efficiency of transport by sea
Due to the fact that most of it happens over sea
Transport is extremely efficient
In general yeah
Yeah overall raw milk is not as much of an issue, but milk is not used independently
Right, reading through that makes sense now
Ahhh
Specifically the carbon intensity of various agricultural systems and their impacts on resources and carbon footprints
And I had to research this as part of my degree
Mmh.
Can you link the study? I want to look at it because that figure runs counter to every other figure I have seen
They usually come from natural biological processes
Right, most of the emissions in agriculture have nothing to do with energy consumption
Since it's not just CO2 that contributes to global warming
The latter is what is more relevant
By what metric? Are the measuring CO2 or CO2 equivalent?
For diets?
That is a very different statement from 'the difference is negligible'
It most certainly is not.
Vegetarianism is more sustainable in comparison to non-veg and easier to meet dietary requirements with respect to veganism
'I beleive its wrong, and thus so should you'
And regardless, according to me, using moralistic arguments is fundamentally flawed. It means you are refusing to use any common ground available and are attempting to force your POV on the other person with no regard for the possibility that the other person may not share the same moral system
(for the record, I personally am vegetarian and always have been)
Because of the entire process of enteric fermentation. Lots of methane.
Anything which uses a grass eating animal is carbon intense
Uhh no.
Dairy is *extremely* carbon and resource intense
yeah was about to say
and conversion therapy
The foster care one strikes me as the most useful one
All of it seems to be more...guidance rather than enforcement
You don't need tofu/tempe for protein. In India we get most of our protein intake from lentils, for example
I don't think most hardcore vegans even consider peta valid
Peta always was weird
But still, worth talking about
Mel linked this exact same tweet earlier I think
Make sure that you exert the power you hold and push for change
It's pretty clear that controlling powers have zero interest in 'talking' and has been for a long time so
they deserve it
Be petty af
It's less 'High Road' and more 'The only really productive one'
Protesting and making life as inconvenient as possible really isnt the high road
Well yes, not keeping decorum is essentially what protesting is
I would hope that mods would immediately shut down that line of thought regardless
'That the police will track it' Really shouldn't be how the warning is phrased >.>
and not an actual call for violence (additionally being called out by others not to talk about it in those terms?)
Its too diffuse?
I doubt that this is the sort of stuff that is being tracked?
and that data is all in data brokers hands which can just be bought off
I doubt they have the sort of extensive user tracking that fb or google services uses
It isnt particularly effective then
Huh
*blinks*
Do they even have the sort of monitoring that other social media does?
Do they?
👀
just requires investment thats being consistently blocked across the world
*profitable* ones too
for most countries in the world
viable ones
Point is, there are a bunch of solutions
becuase of overblown concern regarding nuclear fallout
there are a bunch of associated problems with solutions not being taken well
also waste disposal and management
Not shortage of uranium
Supply chains
Also supply of fuels
especially that of cost and loss of expertise
Nuclear has issues outside overblown safety concerns, to be fair
Europe is not one country, not by a long shot
Reducing the continent to just 'Europe' is incredibly stupid in the first place
I mean
Religions with less organisational structures (like buddhism, shintoism, Hinduism) tend to have fewer powet structures, but those that do form are almost always abusive in nature
And when backed by then strength of belief, they do horrible things.
That's why I differentiated between faith and religious organizations
Religious organizations are power structures designed to execute the will of those controlling it or directing it
That's not what religious organizations are
I am not limiting this to Christianity. Heck I have very limited exposure to Christianity, I was born and raised as a hindu in India
But it has happened
Not the recent past
Yes and Buddhist leaders in the past have committed genocides as well, in SEA
There are some that are purely focused on educating or just helping, but overall, religious organizations focus on enforcing what they believe is the perfect world for everyone.
And I don't mean this as a diss of people's faith, but more of attempting to enforce said faith on others who do not share it
Also, like. Faith is different from organized effort to enforce religious wirldviews on the rest of society (which is what most large religious organisations aim for)
Faith is very different from organized religion.
Organized religion, without exception, is used to oppress.
(I say this, btw, as someone who is religious myself. I actually despise anti-theist sentiments)
But scale of deployment is useful for collecting data and making improvements
You still have to pay a lot of attention to it
its a cool gimmick at best
Yeah, they certainly aren't meant to be used unsupervised
Ones that have been deployed at least
While I dont really like musk, are there better driving assistance programs out there?
banning the entire field is counter productive
Same standard should apply to self driving tech research yes
yes but research is being conducted in the field of human genetics afaik
Well, tesla's systems aren't supposed to be independent drivers, hence why they are even allowed on roads
How so?
Huh
👀
And this would be the latter example
cuz all the examples I can think of either had extremely high risk or was just uneducated idiots making calls
Like? I know there are a lot of examples, but I am curious as to which one you will bring up
Yeah
Right
if you don't wish to invest in it, fine, but people are going to because they see use in it
Research is research
it leads to improvments in a bunch of related fields as well
but regardless, developing self driving does have uses. And developments in self driving aren't just limited to that specific field
I am not shilling mono-rail specifically
Also, to be clear: Nothing beats local rail systems (like mono, metro, light rail) in heavy urban areas
Right, but the economy of scale matters, especially if you are talking intercity routes
Plus last mile coverage is easier on buses than by rail since road infrastructure is still needed
like, literally anything
anything is better than a car
I am not comparing to cars, am comparing to buses
In a city its false
Also rails cant transport the same volume, especially of human passengers
like much of the central US
large plains
Mountainous regions
intercity transit where its not viable to lay rails?
but buses?
yeah no
rails?
depends
however you can't run tests on automated mass transit systems using existing networks on scale first
Implementing it on transit would make mass transit even more effective
👀
Self driving builds towards that though
Interesting
👀
whyever not
*blinks*
Yeah. I read through the article again, the last para makes it clear that it's a snippet of a larger argument in which the author is pointing out how people think rather than endorsing the thought process itself
Making the argument that people need to rot at the bottom so the top can prosper is utter horseshit
You have janitors in developed countries: they aren't starving. Sure, it isn't the most desirable job but plenty of people do it and are able to subsist on it
That's just utterly moronic
People don't need to be literally starving to do jobs that are hard
This article is dumb and it's horrifying that it is coming from the UN
And I've known for a longtime that that's how people think unfortunately
But still
Guards are quite friendly tbh
Who is ted bundy
Country has literally gone to shit
It was a bunch of bad economic planning
This wasn't a 'Great Leap Forward' type thing, but the government trying to mask the fact that they could not afford to import fertilizer any more due to crashing foreign reserves, further impacted by the pandemic crashing the tourism and service industry that sri lanka relied on for maintaining foreign reserves
Ireland is a fun place
A 200-300cc vehicle is really good
Especially if its not a monster of a machine
You *feel* more in control
It's less safe but you have so much more awareness and control
Bikes are really responsive
Small cessnas which aren't in commercial air routes and don't use commercial airports, for example
Most cars are like, upwards of a tonne
Half a tonne is a very tiny car
And the slightest loss of focus is dangerous
See funny thing is, I don't find the technical aspects of driving particularly challenging, it's just that it requires a lot of focus for me
I would actively avoid any driving don't have to do
Like, for me, driving is honestly actively dangerous in long stints, cuz ADHD will make me lose focus
Tho*
You can most certainly speak for your experience thi
We really don't understand much about human brains to be making blanket statements of any kind
Cuz brains work differently
Cuz they aren't equipped for it
Driving can be very uncomfortable. Plus for a lot of people, paying attention on a task with limited changing stimuli is dangerous
Plus overall a bike is more efficient since its lugging around a lot less mass
For example, a lot of roads in the US don't even have sidewalks
Less sidewalk area. Less crossing points.
Entire infrastructure makes it unsafe for people not in cars or a vehicle
Infrastructure
Not cars
So many more things you need to be trained to pay attention to
Also cars are not nearly as complicated to operate as a plane? You are moving in 2 dimensions in a car compared to the 3 in an airplane
Not as viable for personal travel but like, we can do a lot better than we are now
99% of air travel is done through large airbuses
Actually, the aircraft model is really great
XD
Basically: we need more public transport
Again, not really true
But the number? Not really no
True enough
The carrying capacity of said crafts is insignificant
Lol that's just plain false.
But like, there are significantly large numbers of small aircraft used for personal or recreational purpose
Most people don't fly period
So, possibly disturbing, especially if you are of a somewhat patriotic/nationalist bent
Yes, and this is the first time this aspect has been used
I will state though: it is unequivocally good that this is being done ij defense of LGBTQ+ rights
There are very clear borders, and this is the breaching of the boundary between separate nations in alliance and one single entity imposing its will
It's not just culture
Cuz the EU is not really one nation.
Interesting, but also fundamentally, possibly disturbing
Yeah, one of the biggest problems we have is shifting loads so
I can say that's false.
Here, in Ireland.
I was taking a bus at 3 am.
It was literally full
Disengage
So. Yeah.
It's not going to lead anywhere productive
Just. Yeah. Move on? Everyone?
While I understand the urge to clarify and so on, it's not something people are particularly interested in talking about, especially given the poor start to the conversation, however well intentioned.
Leave it be
So like mistakes were made, and amended
Them*
Nor should they given the ideas espoused and carried out by time
Sure.
But it's very key to note.
*Nazis are a sensitive issue*.
If you wish to talk about them in *any* context, you have to be careful and *clear*.
People are not going to give you the benefit of the doubt
A comparison was applied. It was not one that was applied particularly sensibly. While intent does matter, so does sensitivity of the atmosphere of the place
Eh. Context matters.
Brutality isn't really comparable.
Shouldn't have really been tried.
Especially not on a sensitive topic for others.
Neefs more sensitivity when being approached. If you want to talk about soviet brutality, then do so.
But seeming to diminish the pain caused by nazi Germany is typically not the best way to go about it
Isn't that perjury?
I read the actual article
Honestly, that article is clickbaitey as fuck. It's really weird that the guardian is doing that
It's anti-competitive
It's monopolising
Merging is bad
Yay more anti-capitalist monopolies that no one does anything about
It's still concerning af, but the article itself is pushing it in the wrong light
The question on abortion *did* come up, but more so in the possible context of immigration checking if the person was planning to or had planned to give birth to a child in the US to give it citizenship.
The woman was denied entry because her visa didn't allow employment and she was technically taking benefits for services given
https://youtu.be/SlaEaN2sm14
That would just be some form of obstruction of justice
Idk man, you can't really refuse a warrant if you have the information on hand
No. What I am saying is, blame is in tje wrong place. Blame lies on regulatory bodies
I mean. Has Facebook *ever* been interested in maintaining privacy?
Without escalating *really* high. And they don't have that strong a stance on this issue to want to do that
Plus this isn't even something they *can* challenge
Defending abortion rights at the cost of breaking laws, really isn't
Am not saying companies are responsible, but like. Just. Why is that even an expectation? They will do what is in its best interest
They'd have to challenge it in court. And like. They really don't have a responsibility nor any motivation to do that
They don't need to be. That's the choice of their platform. Like, I wouldn't suggest *using* it or anything (cuz I categorically *despise* Facebook), but still, it's not really their *fault* specifically
This is more on how the legal system makes the warrant even possible
I don't think meta really can be blamed here? They can't *not* respect a warrant
Well... Yes. I am still monumentally pissed off that people here use messenger so much
Tbf, Facebook would not be obliged to give data to be acted upon were it not for this being acted upon
Which is terrifying
And police were able to obtain warrants using that as a justification
And like, facebook is stupid and harmful, I don't disagree, but that's not relevant to the issue here: that someone was prosecuted over abortion
They will be liable to fines, non-compliance, etc. And if it escalates, yes, they can lose a number of licenses
And like, yeah, they should. But again, that's a different debate.
Yes, that is criticizable. Which was brought up earlier
They can maybe stall if they really cared, but they still have to eventually comply
Which is why, shun facebook and all, fully support that (Heck I haven't used Facebook in over a decade)
And like. Idk. They aren't ethical hawks on the look out for things to defend against. Which is worth criticising, sure, but that's just how they generally *are*.
Merely that this was regarding a fetus and criminal charges
Sure, they could. They also were not told it was about abortion according to them
Not that its not a disgusting law in the first place
And when I say 'fully justifiable' I mean, the law is on the side of the warrant
It won't apply here
But that's at a much higher level
No, I am saying, criticising them for complying with what is, in that specific case, a fully justifiable warrant, is... Idk. They have to do that, they don't have a choice lol.
They can lobby for challenging to change that from being valid
If it's justified according to the laws of the state, it would just be thrown out
You'd have to challenge the validity in court. And there is no point of doing that if the warrant is actually valid
I think this depends on the company tbh.
For example, amazon only recently started making profit.
A lot of companies do a growth at all costs approach which isn't profit oriented at all
?
Lol
I can attest that it's less varied than India lol. India has completely separate parties ruling most states
Unlike Ireland
It wasn't a conquered territory
It was a full part of China that ended up developing its own identity
Taiwan was where the remnants of the civil war fled to
It's not 'Lost territory'
I don't like it, but it is their territory, ceded to them at the expiry of the 99 year lease the British held
Like, it's not even remotely grey like Taiwan
That is, in the end, Chinese territory
The most aggressive action taken has been with the Indian border skirmish that happened a few years ago
A lot of sabre rattling
They have not actively attacked them
Even taiwan
The US just has stronger allies at the moment
I mean, the US and China aren't that different in my eyes, diplomatically. Both are bullies
It's still wrong, but not really w deviation from their normal behaviour
Hence why legal recognition is important. Corporations will seek profit, principles are not really their priority
They don't have principles outside of those imposed on them by external regulation. That's.... Sorta the point.
Also in general expecting a company to take a moral stand against profits...
The fact that they are even going this far is pretty great tbh
It doesn't
Same with a large portion of South America and Vietnam
With no nuance or thought applied
Cuba is literally just 'communism bad'
I mean it from geopolitical POV, not from a systemic one. Of which China has a lot of issues.
They don't want to deal with the BS of fully seceding from China
Like, India did that with Kashmir most recently, for example
It's a matter of convenience and allies. Nations are fundamentally self centered
Most every country in the world, not just the west
So like, by all means, stand with Taiwan, that's thw good thing to do
But like. 'We wouldn't have done it'  is just false
Like, it is not good
Course not
It is so deeply hypocritical
Especially the US
Like they are any better when it comes to diplomatic issues
But I tire of the moral superiority that western nations tend to take when standing against China
So like, I don't like China. Not in the least
Very recent. Like, not even 2 generations
But that is recent
I did acknowledge that. It developed its own identity
Taiwan was where the remnants of the civil war in the wake of Western withdrawal from chain ended up
No not really
It's just that the american overton window is so far right that center seems left af
XD
Hey, I am lowkey centrist
Lmao
Yee
'03
Commercially 1976 though
1969
Even earlier
Wait bo
Concorde was from 1976
Try 50
I understand it. But also: to me, that still comes from a place of internalized ableism
Disability can be part of who they are and still not be negative?
They don't need to?
Everyone has things they need accomodations for
I dislike the association of disability with like. Lack of value. It's annoying
LOL
Disability is not a negative, it just means needs accomodation
And yes matt
Trans identity, not really repulsed by their body
I know a bunch of people like that
Also, would like to clarify, I initially misunderstood what you had meant by 'centrist', and going by the clarified definition, yes, centrists are bad
And there are a lot of left wing politicians. Just, no one in the US is one. Because that's how far right the spectrum of discussion has shifted
We still have remnants of that
Nationalised industry, centrally planned economy for the most part, heavy government intervention and control, etc.
He is merely advocating for more government participation in civil life and social protection. That's just right of center.
India in the 50s and 60s was left of center
He is not arguing for nationalised enterprise, centralization of property ownership, planned economies, etc.
He is a social democrat
Bernie doesn't espouse communism in any way or manner
True, but there are known extremes of left and right
His policies are a bit more right than political systems implemented in Western Europe. Which is still, right of center
That's just how far right the overton window is in the US
On the political scale
He is right of center
No
Lmao
I don't really think staying static is a good thing since the world is rapidly changing and we need to change with it
Amongst other things
I mean. I am politically right of center. Not left. I would lie where Bernie Sanders lies. Maybe a little more left of him? Since I personally beleive capitalism is necessary to a societal system, albeit with the acknowledgement that it is inherently amoral and thus needs to be shackled
What is that?
Not exactly a vent, but more advice
A friend of mine was recently diagnosed as being on the ASD spectrum and wanted to know about online spaces with other people having similar experiences/diagnoses who can help educate her about stuff,  and/or share experiences.
Are there any suggestions for such spaces?
Tbf, India existing as a nation is a miracle in its own right, given the *extremely* strong cultural identities and divides
There is no one more racist than an Indian to other Indians
Well with respect to India it is a lot to do with how aggressive China has been at the border, and decades of them occupying contested territory. Which is annoying becuase a significant portion of indians, especially from the north east have Chinese characteristics and face racism because of it.
And distribution is deliberately fucked over by capitalistic considerations
Distribution is the issue not resources
To be frank, resources are not scarce
Adjusted for purchasing power? That is a starting of 1400$, moving to around 1900$ in a year
In absolute exchange
Which usually graduates to about 40k a month within a year, which is about 550$
In India, you'd earn between 25 abd 30k a month when you start off, which is about 350 and 450$ a month
But like, it makes sense in the local economy. Viewing it through the lens of your local costs is not realistic
I never said that it was
It's starting
It isn't
It is still low
Yes exactly
(1100 is still not a lot btw, 300$ is very much low pay even in India, qualified people usually start at around 500$)
It's actually a lot more complicated than that, they aren't really *under* paying, and more like, paying relative to the local economy
Btw I was one of those people lmao
300$ in India is equivalent to about 1100$ in the USA
Purchasing power parity
We do be racist af, but we still agree that we are indian lmao
Forged a collective identity. Pretty impressive tbh
Lmao. Well, in this case, it was the leaders of the independence movement who made it stay united so
It is europe with actually one government
That is the analogy I use actually
Yee more or less
Mhmm, but can't really call them dialects, they are as distinct as Spanish and French
Well, there are like, 20 major languages so
Ohh
Hindustani isn't... Well it's a type of music?

Like. The vibe I got from the thread is that they still internally feel sex work is bad somehow, when it isn't
not inherently wrong
People dont always do sex work out of necessity, people enjoy it, and the criminalization of it makes it dangerous
I mean, it's a good thread, but fundamentally; *sex work is not wrong*
Not the wider industry
So focus on that
Sure
Remember, for many, it's a legitimate occupation
So if I sell porn, in my home, through an only fans account, my clients are persecutable?
Again, why?
By making it illegal, you make it impossible to be safe within it
It's the sellers
In the end, it's not the buyers who are affected
It's outlawed in most countries in the world, and all of them have problems with trafficking
Yes it is
Why?
No, not really. This is something that has been told to me directly by current and former sex workers. Only fans was a boon because it gave them control. And several of them did it because it was something they found satisfaction in.
 Sex work is a wide wide variety of things.
Several people with only fans also directly meet with clients
The difference is that the latter is more exploitative *because of lack of protection*
Its sex work
It is a system that provides a level of safety and control
Only fans exists for a reason
LMFAO
It's a similar problem with drugs
What is that root according to you?
According to me it is treating sex work as something that is morally wrong rather than a legitimate occupation deserving of the same respect and protections, which it doesn't get.
The sort of trafficking that happens is a direct result of that because people act motivated by morally shutting down the act of sex work, rather than addressing the over-exploitative nature of it
And what it's loopholes
I am not the most familiar with the Dutch system
Protections for workers
Again
That's sorta the point, there aren't enough protections because it's illegal and stigmatised
Simple
And they should be allowed to define their boundaries
They should have legal recourse, and they should have rights
Like. I don't believe people should be *stopped* from sex work, but they should be *protected*, like workers in every industry at the very least
Different things have different senses of intimacy for different people
Also, fundamentally, not everyone holds sex as a form of intimacy in the same way
And they hold similar viewpoints on this
My point of view here comes from people, some of whom chose to be in the industry, and some of whom were trafficked/coerced into it
Anyway. I am noping from this convo.
Who are doing so without any real coercion on either party's part
But by making it illegal to purchase this service, you are affecting those who sell services on platforms on onlyfans
Not making sex work illegal
Eliminating the power imbalance is the goal
So if it is, very fundamentally, *done without coercion*, what's the problem
Yes?
They are buying a service
They aren't necessarily buying humans for the record
Again, why?
Not always they aren't
A *correct* definition helps narrow, targetted policy
Sex work isn't just people who are trafficked into selling their bodies at clubs
Also fuwa, your narrow definition of 'sex work' is part of the problem
Have consequences for coercion and for fucks sake stop assuming that every person who works in the sex industry is forced into it
As much as people like to think it is
Sex work isn't something special
Basically: my viewpoint is: have consequences for exploitation. Just like you do *for any industry*
Especially those that have control over how and where they work
A lot if sex workers earn well. They don't earn in the millions maybe, but well above minimum wage
Not really
You prevent others from falling inti it
It could also just be convenience y'know
Sure, reducing the power imbalance is a good thing. But assuming that it wouldn't exist without the power imbalance is flawed
Again, not every sex worker needs the job they do. Many operate within it because it earns them a lot of money directly
Saying that regulations are sometimes ignored is not an argument against its use
Yes of course they are, but it helps the majority
It makes it better
And that can and does easily end up in a paid service where people physically meet up
That's sorta the point
There isn't a clean separation like that fuwa
As they should be here
And when this happens in any other industry, labour protection laws are brought in
When I look into it
If it comes from a mindset similar to yours, I am pretty sure I will find the same systemic failures
And it's annoying af
This is just attack on legal aspects of the industry using the illegal aspects as an excuse
Idk
Also like
(I do not know what skebs ks personally)
This is just sad
Man
It's sorta fucked up that while he is an asshole, he has a point when it comes to the monopolization of Internet spaces. (yes ik it's besides the point, and in no way legitimises this person's actions)
Terminating an existing contract without due cause?
I'd say the seller is obligated to provide service in the absence of malice and/or illegal activity
I believe that that is not a very good dichotomy?
New identities form all the time
That's what people here have told me
Isn't the idea of unification sorta split even amongst the residents of NI?
That isn't the case in most countries
That's probably cuz in Germany employee protections are hardwired into the government structure

Most of those costs are likely associated with security for officials attending + extra measures due to paranoia given what just happened
Especially for a state funeral of someone as important as Abe?
That doesn't seem particularly high?
Only elected members can appoint members to the rajya sabha (barring 12 seats that the president can assign), and the president is elected by the rajya sabha.
Mandate*
It's an indirect election, but it's still only through a date
Yee the president here serves terms too
Not really?
It's just that that power needs to be elected as well.
We have that in India, the president is separately elected and is the official Head of the state and commander of the armed forces. Is elected from the members of the Rajya Sabha, the members of whom are in turn put in by the state legislatures
Same with China
Which makes it even more annoying that India is somehow expected to drag itself economically into a conflict it has no stakes in
It's mostly reserved distance, partially propagated by Indian diplomatic policy of non-alignment
But yeah. America and most of the west have never even tried to treat India as a potential ally for the most part or make any allowances to make the deal sweeter
Probably. But I try not to make blanket statements. Who knows, they might be trying to change it
Especially since a lot of terrorist groups were directly funded by the Pakistani state at the time
Yeah Indians were *pissed* about that
I haven't either
India had always resisted, for good reason
And the West famously attempts to force 'open market' policies on others
Who could have known
Ikrrr4
As does every nation
It acts in its own interests, as it always has
Even now, it is.... Yeah. Telling that a lot of western media is framing India's relative non-alignment as being 'treacherous' or 'amoral', completely ignoring the fact that other conflicts of similar scale are ignored by them
And in many cases acted directly against its interests
US actually isn't very well liked in India tbh. Russia is not either, but the US has *never* done favours for India in any meaningful way to deserve its trust
Modi gained popularity well independent of Russian influence. Additionally, historically, India has been a lot closer politically to Russia than we have been to the US due to being a lot more left leaning than the US
Nah
You could try with a cheap external card
Not software
Ahh you said adapter so I assumed hardware
Those are usually replaceable components
Is it possible to replace the network adapter?
True that
The monarchy hasn't died tho
Applying pressure through the world bank
And have for decades
American policies consistently attack consumer and business protection policies under the guise of 'free market'
And like, that's not really a favour per se. Military equipment is the least of it
France gave the better deal
There was a big uproar when India dissolved the state of J&K in 2019 and maded it a union territory
Central and South is India
North West and West by Pakistan
The north Eastern third of it is controlled by China
Yee
And publish maps of the whole of it being India
Controls*
For all they cry about it, what was done in 2019 to J&K is the most that will happen. India will quietly just sit on the territory it control
It's too expensive
And also, lots of saber rattling, not much will happen
Course they will, they have no stakes and everything to gain from it
People demonising China for trading with Russia
No I meant
They exist. Period. Its not up for debate.
Debating the existence of a person like its a matter of opinion is fundamentally wrong
A difference of opinion is disagreement on what constitutes fair tax or what is left and right politically. Stuff like that
That's not a 'difference of opinion' that can be just discounted
Becasue they literally do not acknowledge that you exist and need to be accounted for
There is a flaw in this.
When your belief discounts the existence of a person, it is not something that can just be like 'live and let live'
It's a different form of guarantee of value
Crypto isn't really any less or more real than fiat money that we use tbh.
Are they vassals? It's more their interests tend to align as allies
What is mermaids?
Power, in short. Its not just corps.
Anyone capable of hiring large teams of lawyers gets a better defense
Is this the United States?
It's honestly disgusting how badly implemented anti-compete is over there.
Over here, all employees are specifically given training on anti-competitive practice
Def hindu af then
He is the son in law of Narayan Murthy
OB
Is he actually a practicing Hindu?
LMAO
The fact that a person of Indian descent is the British PM amuses me
Eh.
My 2 cents on this: google is neither inherently good nor inherently evil. It is, as mentioned before, amoral, their aim, like every other corporation, is to make money based on their business model. It is external regulators that are supposed to protect consumers from potential harmful practices that corporations may adopt in the pursuit of their prime directive.
And unfortunately when it comes to anything related to the Internet and computers, the field is developing way too fast for government and regulatory bodies to catch up to what corporations get upto. And what they themselves get up to.
Even if they can't access it while imprisoned, it should ve accessible to them upon the completion of their sentence
Making them work isn't necessarily an issue, it's making them work with little to no renumeration that's the issue
I do not know enough of systems in Europe, my knowledge is limited to India and the US
From what I saw the entire conversation was focused on the United States
Well I was speaking in the context above, which is the United States....?
What you do in prison.... Doesn't change by too much
How *long* you are in prison changes
Also criminality is very subjective. Degrees of criminality are not usually considered. Context is not really considered. Not when it comes to imprisonment.
But like. Big wew for me
It's cultural
Okay I won't say no good reason
Like. Access to vegetables and the lot is there
Depends on the environment tbh.
In Europe? It's genuinely *weird* to see how meat focused things are, for no good reason.
At it's current scale, the level of meat consumption is not sustainable.
So reducing the amount of meat you consume, focusing on more vegetable heavy options, will help significantly
vegans like to make it a bit extreme, but the issue is the scale, not the very presence of it
It is actually quite viable
MUSHROOMS ARE GODLY
There is a lot of tasty shit out there that doesn't have meat and is easy to make as well
Also exploring new recipes for stuff!
Yee reduction helps
There is more you can do of course, but this is the simplest recipe
Have with rice or bread
Stir fry turmeric and cumin with some onion and tomato, boil (or pressure Cook) the lot with water and ad salt to  taste
Veggies taste good in a different way and that's okay
Like. Stop trying to make veggies like meat, it won't work 😭
It's texture is so bad
It tastes disgusting
Lile
I honestly despise the fake meat stuff
And yes uncle ben's
It's precooked and spiced so you can add your own shit to it
That's not the point lol
Oh an some tofu or halumi
So tasty
Pop in a wee bit of cheese and mayo in a wrap
Put a bunch of extra beans, stir fry it with whatever veggies I cna find
Like yhe Mexican one
I have been making these burritos with Bens rice
LOL
Like, vegetarian diets have existed for millenia
It's something I have seen across Europe and its so weird lol
Lentils, beans
And you have pretty decent access to spices as well
Ooh brocoli!
A *tasty* vegetarian diet
Like, I am in Ireland rn, and while the options aren't nearly as bountiful as my home (India), its more than sufficient to sustain a largely vegetarian diet
You get onions, chillies, spinach, peas, carrots
Also Mexican and Indian food are the easiest to modify to be vegan/vegetarian since the bulk of the meal isn't the meat itself, if you are looking for alternatives
This makes no sense for a software company tho
It still required quite a lot of specific inputs to get what you wanted.
Like on another server, an artist friend of mine was quite disappointed by it
That's actually not true?
AI art is still *really* limited. It doesn't capture concepts well unless a human gives the exact right prompts for it.
Like. It makes things easier, doesn't make humans superfluous.
It makes certain specific skill sets superfluous, which can be dangerous if too many people get made redundant at the same time, but that isn't that easy to make happen
And that is private too
My grandma's insulin pen costs about 40$ and the refills about 8$ each
>.>
Wow]
She sorta hates the job but also money
It's quite creepy
Can confirm cuz one of my friends works for the division of apple that does this
Yeah. Sure. And war isn't funny and dark humor is polarising which isn't conducive to discussing the situation
It's not really funny and especially not in a place meant for topics to be discussed *seriously*
Please?
Also umm. Those of you me memeing it, probably *don't* in this channel?
This can't be anything but intentional
I was just about to express condolences as part of the trans day of remembrance >.>
Ouch
That's true
Different aspects of the same event
Tangent, but I personally feel a funeral and a celebration of life are different, at least to us.
A funeral is an expression of grief for what was lost, a celebration of life is.... What it is on the tin. A celebration of the life of the person who passed, their achievements and the good things in their life.
But still
It was expected
I mean
https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/nov/22/fifa-qatar-talks-wales-rainbow-hats-confiscated-world-cup
But like. While that video is super cringe and is really trying to portray it badly, there is a lot to be said about how the depictions are emblematic of attitudes in the industry.
For example, it's relatively rare for a healthy relationship dynamic to be described in anime and manga. And when it comes to pornography, there is a lot of questionable attitudes depicted, regardless of the supposed age of the characters
Also from what I remember that too is going to be changed
Since in the end the point is to have competition
Things don't need to be private to have competition though
Radical feminist
Like, that's sorta the point for me, as fucked as it may sound, it is *good* we are hearing more about SA committed by women towards men, because it means there are more women in positions of power, and the issues tied to that are coming to light.
And additionally moving the idea of sexual assault of 'Man on woman' to 'person abusing position of power' regardless of gender
Western European at least
To be fair, Japan is still *deeply* patriarchal, in a way most western nations are not
It's far far rarer for a woman to be in a position of power over men
It comes down to positions of power
Doesn't matter what I do personally the problem will still persist
Hence the sense of powerlessness that tends to grip me when I think about it
Yep
They aren't as separate as you'd like to think
Like point is, the issues are linked
Mhmm
And like. It's so annoying.
I used to think that way, until I started getting closer to more women.
TW: Mention of SA: ||I still have not met a single woman who hasn't been subjected to sexual assault of some form, across 4 separate continents||
Yee
And point at the few successes and ignore the majority of failings
They see the slight progress and are like. Well why do you want more? We gave you what you want right?? The issue is resolved now
Indeed
Like. It's good. It's progress. It's not resolution
When it's really not
Like, the trend is changing, but also the effects are still very much there.
However, a lot of people in positions of power see these incremental changes and claim the issue is solved
Oh It is happening. But very very slowly
An easy example for me at least is how, in general, women tend to be expected to be in charge of a household, and that is not accounted for in corporate structures.
Like. Most of them are used to people who are not in charge or expected to be in charge for these things.
So a woman who wants a successful career has to work within that framework which is steeped in generations of men for whom there was someone else managing the household, a person whose general societal contributions were and still are not pinned to any economic value
It's a general pattern that's not easily observable on an individual level unless you really know what to look for or live in a place where the divide is starkly visible
And to be clear, this isn't like. A black and white thing
And to be fair, it has improved, but it's effects are pretty apparent even now if you know what to look for
The one I am personally familiar with is that currently roles are split by gender, with a large portion of roles with hard power and authority falling to men by default.
The current system affects everyone, but disproportionately affects those who aren't men since they are the ones not cast in positions of power.
Which isn't to say patriarchy doesn't affect men, it just means the men tend to have the power and autonomy within society to be able to live with said negative effects, a privilege that other groups don't have
I just hate it so much. Every single problem I currently have with respect to my relationships with people can be directly sourced to the effects of the patriarchal systems, and any effort I put in doesn't change the systems around me. Its just annoying to see people like this existing and making life harder for everyone by seeing it as blacks and whites
Yeah
Like gah
I also hate that the views of those idiots are used to like. Discredit the legitimacy of feminist viewpoints?
It's just misandry
Feminism, at least the school I am familiar with, is supposed to be inclusive of all
Cuz they aren't
I hate that the most popular term for them includes the word feminist
They are the type of feminist memes are made about
It's quite disgusting
Basically misandrists calling themselves feminists
Trans exclusionary radical feminist
It's not acceptable but it is what we have and needs to be pushed more
Ah well
Like just *sigh*
Yeah.
Just depressing to me.
It also affects and strains all my relationships with women. Like. It doesn't matter how much effort I take, there is always a guy who appeared just as nice and unthreatening who used any power given to them to manipulate and hurt after a certain level of closeness and its a *hard* barrier to overcome.
Exactly
That is the end goal of feminism in my perception: the dismantling of the gender based patriarchal system
But like. It's not all-encompassing
Cuz it did and does
Not caste existing
No I mean
It's complicated
~~and Indian culture has always been about far more than just Hinduism~~
Also Indian society isn't about caste? Even though depending on where you are and what community you are part of it can form a part of it
It's a lot more complex than that?
There were so many layers to it
It's based completely on the caste system, which is just.... Lmao false
The understanding of Indian social structure is complete BS though
A lot of the facts surrounding it are accurate, even if the understanding is quite incomplete and lacking nuance
It's not complete bs. I say that as an Indian, and someone who actually looked into a lot of root philosophies of vedic culture. I do not know about the Chinese aspect of it.
I've watched it
Yeah I know this video
Ah fair
But Indian culture is just extremely complex because for the longest time, its guiding principle tended to be live and let live? So everything influenced it
Yee that's the point
Never mind the actual programming and structure of it
And that's just the conduction mechanism
Its just so complicated
Like
Mmh.
From my understanding its more like.
Chemicals change the activation potential? Sorta?
It's like an infinite fuzzy set of possible connections from just one set of neurons
(for context, neuron connections change based on chemical concentrations)
Never mind a system that is known to change its entire layout based on chemical concentrations
Is so hard to trace
Just simple wiring
Like
Honestly, it will never get to that point
And it isn't limited by size
We can with AI
At its core, we cannot yet play with human brains yet
Also arguably, human art is more complex because the concepts linked are on a much higher level
It's just. It's pretty. Humans are capable of a lot more. It's a form of expression for humans
I mean, I don't think anyone claims AI art to be anywhere close to what humans can create?
Which is like just ew
Also like, there are scum who rip off part of other people's work and use AI to complete it
I mean it's sorta the point
Tru
Wouldn't it just be a sentient at that point?
Trade off of speed vs versatility is how I would put it
But the learning process for both is similar. Humans just do a lot more with it
I mean. AI are more limited than humans, that's known
Amongst a host of other things
Completing patterns
It's just that humans do it with far more limited data
I mean, there is more to humans but also like. The process for *learning* is very very similar
It could represent the next jump in processing and computing
Though biological computers would be very interesting
two messages up Rakhi XD
Isn't that foundation ableist af?
A lot of them still do for the record
A doctor is not obligated to give up their life for your convenience
But like. You sorta need people to pay attention if a system is untenable
They aren't going to stop emergency care
Not like they won't
And a lot of the time it's not exactly money, it's being overworked because of lack of investment in manpower
They still need to survive and have basic requirements met
So like
If it's anything like Ireland, they are overworked, emotionally blackmailed and underpaid
Okay mm
Basically, why should someone sacrifice their life because you need it
Are they selfish though?
The top gear presenter
Jeremy?
It's fun yes
But like. Direct blame at the people who are responsible for the situation and were using their power to keep it that way, intentionally or not
You should be in fact
And for the record, you are right to be pissed at the inconvenience
And like. It's not their responsibility to sacrifice for general convenience.
Yes the system needs to function, the point of the strike is *this is dysfunctional and needs to be fixed right fucking now*
~~and in a lot of places that balance is moving towards people who don't actually need it as much~~
To balance people's needs
That's the job of the government
It's not their job to be aware of the whole picture though
But this isn't something that started with him so
Rishi Sunak
Which, in this case, is the government of the UK
The governing body for these people
Blame the people responsible for it
It's inconvenient
I severely doubt that such a widescale protest is the result of anything other than complete neglect
'just wait, we will get back to you, but in the meanwhile, keep working in this untenable, horrible environment that we created'
'the people need you'
And are using the same emotional blackmail type argument to push away concerns
Note: you've probably exhausted other avenues and people in power aren't listening to you
But a lot of healthcare is a lot more than emergency care
Yeah they won't stop emergency care like
Not just doctors
Amendment: any health care worker
And then there are people who have just given up and stopped caring because they are overworked
I loved all the jobs I worked, I switched because it didn't pay enough for it to be sustainable, but the current job is also really interesting
Work can be satisfying if the job is appreciated and not like. Exploited.
~~I sorta disagree with your first line, I do actually like the work I do and would be pretty damn depressed and purposeless without a job. And not because of lack of money either~~
That wasn't what was being said.
I mean.
You had a conversation. People had an opinion on it and explained the point of view.
You may or may not agree with it.
The PoV I see and what you see are very different.
That's about it.
You aren't a lunatic for being mad with nothing fucking working when you need it to.
Which we are actually very rapidly moving towards
But also as a society, the more efficient we grow at communicating and coordinating, the more effective a decentralised setup will become
It's a bit of a paradox
The problem with any system is that there isn't enough computing power.
An autocratic system is *too* centralised, and the central unit doesn't have enough processing to grasp the effects of decisions.
When you decentralise, there is enough computing but not enough co-ordination
That's full decentralisation
Mhmm
💖
And isn't going to lead anywhere, is all
Not going to argue it mainly because its personal to each of us
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
My personal belief system is honestly incompatible with this
I mean, postal service in the US. Railways in the US.
Healthcare in the US
India actually
Merely having only one authority making all decisions
I don't argue against *all* centralization
Oh nationalisation is useful
I don't think it inevitable
But also can be prevented
Hmm I think less will and more it can happen
No one commission ir authority for everything
I mean more wings
Oh I am not arguing for ancap society lol
I see that in India actually, while money is a great power, a lot of power lies in the popular mandate. Which leads to real progress in a lot of cases
I think it can if there are proper checks abd balances that derive power from a source that isn't money
There isn't
Having a centrally planned economy is not necessarily bad as long as other things remain decentralised
I would argue given the inherent limitation of human perception and the lack of resources to directly enhance it, decentralisation would serve better
Beyond a certain point
For one or even a small group
People and their needs. Grasping the entire spectrum of needs is impossible
Economy is only one aspect of a nation
That's only one aspect of it though
At least not in their current state
Not machines.
Machines enhance, not replace
No, because, in the end, the final decision maker is a human, and a single or even a small group of human minds 8s not capable of grasping tje effects of decisions made beyond a certain scale.
The limitation is the computation of a human
Huh fair enough
Hmm.
I will say then, it's my opinion and I don't have enough supporting arguments for it
I mean not like I did either
From what I have seen, planned economies have the same issues that anything centralized has: inability to appropriately react to issues fast enough and adapt at the lower levels
I don't know much about this so can't comment on it
I do not no
Which country?
Tito?
👀
It shouldn't be allowed to become a monopoly
Independent enterprise *does* help a lot
But also, economically, you still need decentralisation of some sort
I would honestly agree
And they control a large aspect of the global economy and soft influence
MONEYYYY
But US be like
Cuz a lot of nations were and are figuring out balances
Honestly, the US is one of the worst fucking influences for it
People are getting there
And there are checks and balances
More people having authority, but still some level of centralization to ensure things actually happen
And that's not what I am arguing for
Where the biggest bully wins
It's basically a big school yard
The UN never was an organization of control anyway
A fully decentralised doesn't have enough checks against monopolization
I mean, this is sorta what I was arguing for?
Like, a fully centralized economy becomes too rigid
Like. How on earth
Man when people compare trump to Modi 🤣🤣
A lot of nations don't have well equipped rail networks
Ireland
Hint hint: just use rail for long distance transport, and trucks for last mile delivery
Specific areas of it may be useful
Not necessarily?
In?
What's the og degree?
👀
That's how I got out of my rut
Is it possible to pursue further education?
:/
Ahh my age
That does suck :/
But also how old are you, if I may ask?
There usually always is some option available. Somewhere, somehow.
Do things only you like and you feel develops you and put bare minimum everywhere else
In response to this, my philosophy is, if someone is not recognising your efforts, instead of quitting efforts entirely, refocus as much as possible.
But yeah. Options do exist, even if life around is shit
Okay, I have to get back to work
That's more than most XD
Plus rudimentary spoken skills
I have the N5 cert is all
I mean, I have Japanese on mine, even though its very weak
Yet that is
Oooh
Not saying you should btw. Just. Possibilities are there
Mhmm
So it's possible, even if it's hard
Now is 34
He quit when he was 29
He's in Tokyo now I think
Quit it all, spent a year learning Japanese full time before going into translation
Hated
He was in IT
Like
When I was learning Japanese, there was a guy similar to you
You can do it!
I didn't put all my effort in cuz I did end up completing my degree but still
That I already knew
I had languages that were near mirrors of Japanese
LOL fair
It will work out Fenny
*pats*
And Japanese is... Easier than people think, especially if you speak an Asian language, they have similar grammar structurs
My bachelors that is
It was one of my alternate ideas when I thought I was going to fail out of my degree
Like, there is a course
Japanese translation is massive though!
And it is not really fair or anything
It doesn't take away from how hard it is though
I did one of those. It's just a possibility to explore
There are several 1 year courses
I know friends who did the same
Also like, I don't know what all you studied within your course.
But even if it is useless in its current form, you have an MBA. Worst case you study further and combine stuff from both degrees
Alarmism and Austerity followed by a drive to acheive whatever goal elon has at the time for the company
Apparently Elon uses this as a strategy to grow companies
In crude terms, in fusion, you put 2 particles together, but they don't fuse entirely, and the excess is released as pure energy
Fission is where you gain energy from breaking atomic bonds
It's more like.
If you keep looking deeper into mass, you just end up with energy.
And in fusion, you convert part of the mass to pure energy..
It's a ✨ spectrum ✨
People aren't a monolith yee
Ah well
Just. The less you understand the more you assume and the more scope for misunderstanding....
That lack of awareness on both sides is sorta dangerous tbh
Aww
And are uncomfortable around due to lack of exposure rather than any active hatred
Don't actively hate people, just... Outsiders they don't know/understand
So, sorta xenophobic tendencies? Similar to Japan? 👀
Outsider
It's more.
Is foreigner a slur?
👀
This is just peak salt
Lmao
Is he wrong?
Like, the bengal famine was the second worst, the only thing worse than it was the Irish famine
I mean.
He actively perpetuated the myth of the clean Wehmacht
the ones I read at least
they tend to be better stories
But honestly, I enjoy the fanfics a lot more
and percy jackson too
I got into HP as a kid
that family can be based anywhere, it can be african, american, irsh, chinese
the point was that he was part of a family trained to be companions to the Fowls
where he specifically comes from doesnt matter
I mean, his past can be modified a bit
it's been a while
like, in the books that is
wasn't butler central asian?
it didn't specifically try to put it out there but there wasn't any bs justification of anything bad
.....Artemis fowl was pretty okay for diversity
not the actual author's
at least with fanfic you know you are getting the writer's take on the story
Cuz they try to do what fanfic does without the disclaimers
I rarely watch adaptations tbh
or even enid blyton stories
or artemis fowlk
like percy jackson
there are better books out there that are equally easy to consume
I don't want it being given to his kids]
Though I should ask my brother where he stowed it
I probably won't get to it anytime soon cuz its literally halfway across the world lol
on so many different levels
far far better
plus fanfics are just
I just dont want JKR to profit from it anymore
nor am I encouraging people to like. destroy it as a whole
the information isnt being lost
Like
Exactly
it's a platform for a repugnant person
I grew up with it and developed an attachment, I really don't want anymore people to
It's not something I want more kids to read
idk
Like
Eh. I sorta dont want to
I should probably burn the copies I have tbh
I say this as a kid who read the HP series as a whole some 8 times
100% agree
ending in the same result
And the movies followed the books relatively closely, they only changed bacjground stuff
The books were not the best in the world, but they weren't *bad*
No
Uhhh
Like say 'methods of transmission of x disease'
A Google search is usually a bad idea unless you have a specific disease you are trying to exclude
They don't want to actively stick a knife in, just completely deny their existence and right to seek treatment on their own
Anyway
Ahh.
There is a lot of specific and wider instances. 
People here would be happy to provide that.
Ah.
Because you chose a particularly sensitive topic?
that would be more accurate
Hmm yeah
Uhh demonstrably false.
(also probably don't ping them with replies here)
Again. Why are you here then. Like.
This space is segregated away so you can enjoy the rest of the server without engaging with it
Except for a specific, narrow audience. Harmful outside that context. So that type of fun doesn't need a platform.
Some types of fun are just not fun
I thought you didn't want to engage 👀
But also that is not really relevant to the discussion
A morbid part of me was like 'Is this what post-scarcity society will be like? Politics cua we have nothing better to do?'
Can't execute your agenda if there are too many dissenting voices now can you
lol. Enemy of politics*
its a hard skill to cultivate
Eh, for that you sorta need to be willing to listen. Which can also be sorta dangerous
Moving on
And you arent being pinged in.
you chose to come in this area of the server and interact with it
I mean, the serious discussion channel is separate for a reason?
it is an abhorrent point of view that is being allowed to stay
The shock value was the point
like say that bill up there
Eh. It's more.
Where it's relevant, shit is happening
(the lawmakers that is)
You can switch off a ping when quoting/replying to a person, like I have here in this message.
And they had sorta specifically said about 3 times that they didn't want to be pinged in >.>
so I can't read that article now
cuz I can't turn off the cookies
Man visiting US sites is a pain
One of tje times I was driving, I nearly drove into a ditch because I lost focus
Indeed. I will have to drive soon tho unfortunately
It's very all or nothing
So I can't really do *anything* else except drive
Its a spectrum, the way it expresses in me is hyperfocus
It's just. Annoying. And with ADHD it requires so much focus
I mean, if its regular commute, I'd really rather not drive myself
Very sad
It was taken over by actual predators to justify their behaviour, by the looks of it
But using the term pedophilia as an all encompassing term for all these predatory behaviours sorta muddies the water.
On some level, I actually like the fact that they are unironically trying to rebrand as 'Minor Attracted Person', it firmly puts them in the predator category. They are putting neon signs on their head saying 'we are not mentally ill, we are just assholes and predators'
That applies even amongst relationships between adults
That you are attracted to someone doesn't justify action
You do not act on attraction to children, period. It is a hard line that should never be crossed, regardless of how physically attractive you may find a person. Simple.
I actually have thoughts on this.
There is a weird grey area between pedophilia the mental illness and pedophilia as its defined now.
The mental illness is someone attracted to pre-pubescent children.
The current perception includes predatory behaviour directed at minors who are not pre-pubescent.
And that just... Allows the platform to stay. Where they go 'but it's biology'.
Biology doesn't change that you are predating on someone in a position of lower power.
But like. Cars are still needed, especially if you are not transporting just yourself
Even with public transport, people use cars like. Just not as often
That's.... Very few places.
Eh. I don't think I agree with that, it is a heavy instrument and should be treated as such
Not Dublin tho
I live in one of the larger cities
I mean, Ireland in general is not urban
Uhhh South-ish?
That's South
Republic
Like, in the North part
I would say UK or north Ireland if I were there
Republic
I am in Ireland rn and lived in India most of my life.
India is just shit. But it does have amazing public transport connectivity, at least in the southern parts of the country.
Irish roads are... Weird. But that's not really a factor in my disomfort. I simply see it as a waste of time, inefficient and the amount of infrastructure and space required to maintain a car intensive system is just stupidly high.
And it is not needed in urban agglomerations.
Did china have communist principles after mao?
Because of History. Taiwan, for all intents and purposes, never was a separate country from china, it was the last bastion of the losing side of their civil war, supported by the US as 'supporters of freedom'.
It is a point of pride. Additionally, Taiwan never formally seceded from china
One thing to understand my friend, you don't need to hate a particular group to be biased  against them.
That is a reallyt common misconception. That most harm comes from those who actively hate.
Those who actively hate are the instigators at best, the most harm comes from people acting based on flawed, bad assumptions. In this case, anything related to China.
Yes. The Hindu one is upright and with dots
There is nothing else to it
The part where it intersected with their duties has been duly addressed
It's none of people's business
It's just *weird*
Yeah me too
Like
The focus after the fact though
Like. They got fired for indiscretion on duty. What else do you need
And I am sorta weirded out by how much attention is on it
It's annoying
I am still very confused
They don't have the cookies opt out so I can't read them
Man I hate US sites
And you didn't
It's fine
Just explore what you like and don't like. And you may have to work against internalized biases against enjoying content deemed to be inappropriate for someone straight presenting
From personal experience with similar things:
That's fine and normal.
Also, if you want to explore this, don't think too hard about labels at this stage
Bruh
A lot of co-operative banks
The owner holds no stake after the houses are sold
Also all housing societies are co-operative
Especially for Dairy and Agriculture
You have a lot of them in India
It's called a cooperative
Expense, gold doesn't retain its shape well, etc.
Money is just the most easily visible
There are so many other dimensions of unequal power distribution that has negative effects on the world and society
Merely one that is largely motivated by profit
But that's not the only form of disproportionate influence
Are the rich specifically the problem? Or disproportionate influence they hold?
Called 1mg
We have an online pharmacy here in India
Like, it's great, it's an amazing step forward, but it's also something whose scope needs to be carefully managed
It's just. Not being done well, and not being looked at critically enough by people too enthusiastic about them
I personally feel that AI *can* be a useful tool....but current practices are not conducive to it
Which probably includes transphobia and homophobia
According to *our* values
'you don't have resources? So we will take up even more of your limited time and resources to "teach" you to parent'
Yeah
Fair enough.
It's unfortunately how high level politics works in India. It always amuses me when people seem to think Modi is different in that respect from other leaders
Unless 'purging' involves completely tearing down the existing system and starting ground up
Purges rarely help with it
To be corrupt that is
For the record, I am not promoting India over China, merely positing that the measures that Xi seems to be taking don't really seem to be targeted at addressing corruption or making it harder
It makes it sorta unreliable.
And I already said, higher level corruption still very much exists.
But like.
In the case of China, its at the point that it has to account for that corruption when reporting stuff like GDP figures
It's more nuanced than that
Not really
*blinks*
India is no paragon of virtue for the record
In a lot of ways 👀
It doesn't help with the higher level stuff, but it starts at that stage
And transparency. People can trace what goes where
But lower level corruption was addressed not by purging, but by accountability
India was and, to a large extent, is like that.
When a system is that way, purging does nothing to help
As it currently stands
China is the former
Whereas in others it's more, it happens cuz, yes, corruption happens in all systems
No, some systems *rely* on the corruption to get things done
Yeah. No.
There is corruption and there is systemic corruption
What's needed to address that, in the end, is accountability and transparency, which is not soemthing happening in China
Honestly, the problem, from what I know of it, is deeply systemically rooted in China, from the days of Mao. And it's not something that anyone has taken any serious effort to systemically change. Purging officials doesn't really address systemic corruption.
Impose a hard border in NI?
What exactly are they trying to do?
Hence why it seems 'pro-russia' when it's more like 'this isn't our war, why tf are you trying to involve us'
The US and Europe haven't really provided friendly terms to India, now or in the past due to that stance
India is, as always, non-aligned
Would give europe a run for it's money in that regard
And very very varied
India is fuck all massive lol
Don't have many direct connections in the North
Mostly around the South of India
Tamil Nadu, lived in Maharashtra for years
Bihar*
I am personally not from Vihar
There are a lot of grants
Probably? Not sure
Often without understanding local contexts
Bihar Hiking?
Honestly, the US was far far worse than the USSR when it came to proselytising
A lot of old systems persist, with support from the government to protect vulnerable sections 9f society
Even now, farming land is protected under those laws for example
And because it wasn't working at that scale
It only shifted capitalist in 1991 because of Manmohan Singh's reforms
But no, a lot of socialist provisions in India's constitution predate any help from the USSR
Oh sorry misread that
And China never helped India
When the country formed
And honestly, it was *needed*
Nehru was strongly socialist
Not at all
No
Parts of that still remain in fact
It was very strongly socialist
Despite being the world's largest democracy
And India only switched to a capitalistic system relatively recently
They were very adamant not to fold under anyone just because they sorta agreed
Honestly, India is very.... Odd, diplomatically. Legacy of Nehru and the Nehru Family
So it keeps ticking on
It's mostly separate from governance
Mostly because of the bureaucratic system
It functions somehow
Like. It functions despite institutions, not because of
And honestly, India is a lot less... Hmmm
China could invest in them
I mean
We shall see
That was all us
But the rest? No
Pakistan? Yes
Not really in this case
Which leaves Bhutan and Nepal
Myanmar has always been frosty
Intervene*
Sri Lanka was a lost cause because of how Rajiv Gandhi decided to intervention
We helped create Bangladesh and fucked that up
India has no true allies on its borders. Its funny how we fucked all of them up
But also its complicated because of the US support and presence in Pakistan
China is too aggressive on India borders
Pretty much
Nor do they really want to tbh
The current government hasn't really done much to change the overall stance of India in that regard
Maybe
In the end, India *tries* not to be involved in armed conflict
But not much
A bit
Transitioning more to the French with the decline in Russia quality and geopolitical standing
Indian arms haven't yet progressed to that stage, we still buy heavily from the French and Russians
XD
The primary always is local, with the option to use English
Everyone is pretty ambivalent towards the British, so using their language doesn't really piss off people as long as its just secondary to the local language
Pretty much
Yep
It's useful for communicating without having t9 accept some other culture
People don't care for it
It's taught as a second language
Not everyone is fluent at English
I mean
So English serves as a common language even tho most people don't speak it very well
The independent identities are *strong*
Rebel*
Try to impose any one, the rest will revel
What would be the language of the EU?
It's like if the EU became one country
Barely a country
Well that's because India is like
The Indian identity exists only because of the British
In a lot of ways it's serves as a unifying language
No, it remains specifically becasue it's an external language
And eventually all the signs were changed to reqd only in Kanadda and English
Hindi*
Crossed out all the Hindu
Locals took umbrage to that
When they built the metro rail system, they had the signs in Kanadda, English and Hindi
Which is one of indias 5 metros
In Bangalore
Like, to put it in perspective
Yep
But that's because Uttar Pradesh and Bihar have ginormous populations
Hindi*
Technically hindu
Its different in every state
Where?
To the point that several states in the south don't teach hindi at all in schools
States just said fuck you
An example: the central government tried to impose hindi as a national language on all states in the 90s
And depends on what is being talked about
There is a hierarchy, but it's hideously complicated
It's pretty bad yeah
It's odd. There is federal oversight, but in specific areas
I think I've talked about this before, but even in the current parliament, with Modi's absolute majority, about 200 out of 543 seats are held by state parties
State governments are incredibly powerful
Each state has a completely different language, and local governments run on those languages
Whereas in India it never really even diminished
There are efforts to revive it and maintain it
Sorta like Ireland actually
Mmh from what I know of South Africa, local languages and cultures barely survived, mostly taken over by invaders.
It survives, but it sorta doesn't have enough people to properly maintain it
Hence its discussed more
America has disproportionate influence and its influence has far reaching consequences in a way almost no country does.
Holy shit
I caught up to Vinland
Oh man
I needto watrch more of this season's anime
More isekai
nani
nice name you have
<:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
Homu chan
Dess!
Touma is good in the novels
hmm
lmao
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
second half was
the first half at least
well
of how good it could get
But Railgun S was the peak
Hmm I personally liked it a lot
is as good as sisters
The next railgun arc
It wasnt that bad tbh
so good
were just wew lad
the last few arcs of the OT LN
Man
yes
he was *scary* pre sisters
badly nerfed actually
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
he did get nerfed
Accelerator is one very good example
there sre some powers that just *broken*
Like
I love the science side powers tho
kek
Boooooo
Boo
Any more discussion will lead to LN spoilers tho
by Aleister
Designed that way actually
breaks their bodies from the inside out
Espers cant use magic
they arent
how magic and science are essesntially intertwined
Kamachi has been hinting at *something* for a long long time
and in the novels, Espers are...well
it depends on what beleifs power their magic
its just not as widely known as science
it has a system
the problem is, the stories are not *well known*
Actually, the stories they use are very real
like 0 exposure
I don't understand 99% of the christian stories
because its easier for me to understand
I love the science side stuff better
Index magic is really good tho
He is?
he got shafted in the anime
Hamazura was so good in the novels
LOL
And hamazura
Accel and Touma are the characters that actually stay consistent throughout
Touma has a lot of depth
and touma
mans mad
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
It is *all* the same author
yep
~~basically, kamachi has shit editors who care more for the money that index can make rather than making it a good, consistent story~~
its not completely consisten
its a side story
thats cuz railgun is a retcon
the novels go quite a bit into his head
Like
yeh
fair nuff
not at all
he isnt a blank slate in OT
he gets dev in OT too tho?
especially that later novels
Mhmm
sooo 25
I am still at NT3
wew lad
NTR
tbh
I dont want it to be
It could be
sure
LOL
Exactly
and is lesser without it
Railgun is only part of a larger universe
I heavily disagree
nah
And accel was *very* much manipulated
nani
wait
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
He didnt think them human
he was manipulated
he was
by the end of S3
<@!476058996315389953> he redeems himself pretty damn well actually
LOL
*never*
He never forgave himself
like
Accelerator get *really* good
he is actually the one most consistent character in the series
is all I can say
thats it
which is why I called you out on thay
You were making broad statements with not enough context <@!476058996315389953>
yes
its a series
yes
most of the sisters were killed in In House experiments
Except for about a couple of months
Actually they were in a vault
and is legitimately irritating
when I have much wider context
but its still not something I want to talk about
ik that
which did a shit adaptation of him
Because you are basing this on the anime
Please stop?
Carolnein
at all
like. He isnt really explored well in the anime
at least not around me
Please dont hate him?
me too
?
not generic no ur wrongs
proper arguments and stuff?
like
The books actually tell *why* touma thinks they are wrong?
even in OT
and well
Cypher
~~thats sorta sad?~~
I dunno, book version of him wasnt that bad
But it wasnt as scary
she literally *is* a little girl
sge is 14
you gorget
she was a little girl
in it
she grows a *lot*
thats why sisters is so important for her
no she cant
At that point?
especially by someone whom she considers weak
she hasnt been bested in a long time
some one besting her
no she was scared of what the pounch represneted
that was pre sisters
Well at that point of time she *was* a girl
like he only won because accel underestimated him and he *knows* it
not at all
and Touma didnt come away unscathed
Touma's power is rather uniquely suited to defeating opponents who are overly dependant on theirs
well
ah kk
you arent on the index server?
Cypher
wait
yes
Ages ago
and translated?
23rd NT novel
NT22 Reverse or summat
Of the next year?
NTR is in January?
8 months actually
it breaks my mind
yep
same
~~touma has many moments like that. in every novel in OT in fact~~
That it is
you have *issues* if you require 22 novels to *build up*
its bad writing
its just...not
Thats not a justification cypher
but ugh
it gets better
at least in OT
Its honestly sad how Kamachi creates these amazing chars and then just...sorta throws them away after each novel
Yes she does
and those were the best novels in that set
Index 3 was so rushed
Tanya is a good LN
so thats that
much like symphogear actually
I like it despite its flaws
Anyway
and well, Mikoto grows so much in NT is what I hear
doesnt mean she is not a teenager
its as simple as that
people with crushes do stupid things
cuz she is a girl with a crush
and almost impossible to break him out of it
its so sad
he legit believes he is unlovable
its hard to describe lol
and he actually is dense in a weird way.
she had that confidence in her power
she'd
because she knew shed win
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
and there are 100k+ verses
if translated fully
each couplet expands to about a page of text
*poetry*
that is, 6000 pages of poetry
the literal, unexpanded translation of the mahabarath is close to 6000 pages
heh this is nothing
just look at mob
they put effort into everything
Cuz its bones
Dafaq man
Accel was like
So good
In the novels
That fight tho
Lol
So haru looks prettier tho
Or thus
Should I buy this
Yep
Really made me go 👌
Treating it like a real relationship
Yeh
Just wow
Like
Nice stuff man
The last chapter
Who here is following kaguya Sama?
Sooo
So that means fine is salem
And the moon is shattered in rwby
They break the moon
Listen
Symphogear is just the past of RWBY
For symphogear
I have a head canon
~~isekai into fate~~
Is always better dess
More dess
;-;
No place for me
I can't isekai into it thi
Both sound awesome kek
Either
<@150426083831971840> you know what to do
Yes
it was weak
I just didnt like it much
I didnt skip the fate route
I mean, you are free to like the VN more, I just dont
Different choices along the route
They sorta are?
?
and the Zero anime was a masterpeice
I just loved the way everything was put together
well it is book based
heh
I still like the anime better
Eh
that would be weird yeh
LOL
mhmm
different opnions
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
I liked it better than the VN
Eh
Why must you hurt me so
:(
UBW was also good that way, the scene wasnt hot, it was *awkward*, exactly like how a meeting between virgins would be
They actually made it very well justified
Like hooah
Heaven's feel was *much* better
Like *why*
and had the most illogical and OOC Sex scene
Saber route was the most boring of the lot
I mostly disagree cuz I a) don't like the first route and b) don't like VNs in general
I will give it a try
worst of both worlds
It doesnt have the visual oomph of an anime/manga, nor does it have the depth of a novel
Tho I am pretty biased against VNs in general
Like it explored a little more but
I did read the VN and found it to be an inferior experience tbf
Ah well
Hooah
It animates all the battles and....well
You are legit missing out
Huh
<@455790470119817217> you havent watched ufotable fate?
Ikr
In for a ride, you are
The official ones at least
I felt like crying blood after reading them
Ugh the Index translations
Horrible
Really well done that
yeah Shinsekai Yori is also a novel
I intend to read it
The LN is good?
<:TsubasaDisgust:349013662775902209>
ikr
True lol
Shinsekai Yori was really good
I wish Japan made properly good novels tho. Like...properly constructed stories. Very few stories I have read from there are truly worthy of being called an amazing book
<:MikuPraise:585839808765493249>
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
I don't really disagree with you <@!99695384296701952> I just feel that the anime is the superior experience
Thats a more strict definiton than what I use
Okay
Huh
I never said it was
its not
Sure
I just didnt like it as much
I have played the VN reeee
or a manga
tbf I would have loved fate if it were a proper novel
That it is
he comes of as bland cuz of that
ah yeah
The deen fate was horrible
ufotable animated*
thats it
so I am not gonna complain
Wel symphogear got 5 seasons
no
huh
why is ame so sad
In for a ride you qrw
Oh！！
What are they watching?
its not flashy
I mean, there isnt much they could have done
You hate the anime...for being a faithful adaptation?
And the setup for the entire premise of the show is so brilliantly done
People don't look like caricatures of Japanese perceptions of people, they look like real fucking people and that is *so rare*
People look so fucking real in it
Firstly *wow* the art
Has anyone watched it?
I want to discuss the first few episodes of monster
That is some amazing animation
And yeah holy shit
Or something else?
Is that lupin the third?
;-;
Y'all mad
nothing really stood out ot me
this season
I am wathing...nothing
👍
Example?
It gave so very little for the anime to improve on
I'd say that shows how strong the manga is?
It's, by nature, a bit dry in fact
getting back to monster, as a non-fanatasy series with little to no interpretable art or action, I don't see how it can be improved upon in a visual medium
Ah ok
It is a pretty good adaptation from what I have seen?
Hmm?
Why do you think so?
I mean barring the 3 or 4 action scenes there is nothing exceptional in the animation of it
same as Vinland Actually
so its hard to improve on it
hmmm.
Monster is essentially grounded in reality
It is a *fantasy*
See I can see how houseki can be improved in a visual medium.
Yes
Houseki has action though?
from the chapters that I browsed through
it doesnt have interpretable art
It doesnt have dynamic moments
how so
to be an amazing anime adaptation
I am saying that monster doesnt even have the potential
The studio went above and beyond. That was a manga for which a visual adaptation had the potential to exceptional
That series had horrible art
Take mob for example
It didn't use anything that would need amazing animation
I am not sure that this a series that lends itself to an amazing adaptation because the manga itself was that good
Hmm
like '04?
And isnt it pretty old?
And the music was spot on, as was the VA
<@152896851660505088> I don't think there is much you can do otherwise tho, for monster. It isnt a visual spectacle

More isekai
The Mangaka is.... Wew lad
I started reading mushoku tensei manga
"imagine if monogatari and Yuri on ice had a persona flavoured frog baby conceived anally in Bollywood"
Sec
By gigguk
Had the most brilliant description
Sarazanmai
The second anime
they are basically manipulating the capitalist system to their absolute advantage
This is not at all good
*everywhere*
China is basically playing the big bulli
wait wut
it would easily be an 8+
~~still only brought it down to 7.14~~
<:GWmythicalHyperREEEE:373159924487684106>
Nothing in the show warrants it
21.9% 1 star?
wtf
Like
why isnt that an 8+
Oh yeah
?
That I agree with
I see megumin I upvote
and Tatami Galaxy
I want to watch ping pong again
Thus, an 8.5
FMA isn't really exceptional in that regard
Or Mob
example: Ping Pong
sure, I am saying there are shows that are bith stylistically brilliant and brilliantly executed
no real points of divergence
Like
FMA:B
It had one of the most *complete* stories
(I mean, it is the point since we are hearing the MCs thpughts)
Wouldnt be able to read fast enough to keep up
Wouldnt have been able to follow with subs LOL
gdi they talk so *fast* tho
which I want to watch again
Tatami Galaxy was a brilliant show
Nor really stylistically new or creative
animation is not really all that amazing
an 8.5 at best
Which *is* a good show but no 10 imo
~~not as hyped as FMA:B~~
Woah AOTs3 is 9.07?
<:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
Still at nt5
I have heard
~~it's lowkey sad that the only really developed fem char ox Misaka upto the point that I have read and that's only because of the manga~~
Misaki
Cuz the arc is pretty good
I just hope that it follows the manga faithfully
We have second best girl this season
Calm down
RAILGUN T HYPE BOIS
Do you mean.... Dess?
Yeh
But it just suddenly switched to action hype for no rhyme and reason, discarding the relevance of all previously built up chars
I*
U was prepping for a dark drama with action
They just suddenly changed tune
Like
The beggining and the ending were completely disassociated with each other
It's more like
I wouldn't call it sour
Sour...
Dafaq bro
You did all that.... For *this* ending?
Like
It's one of my biggest sources of salt
Whiiich they sorta threw out after that
The first 18 episodes was very careful world building
Like till the ep with the ||earths history||
After which It suddenly just got weird af
Or 18
Till ep 17
Tbh franxx was p good
Actually
Calm down
Railgun T HYPE is real
Railgun manga is excellent
XD
For the amazing story that it was
My favourite is and forever will be railgun sisters
Remember this?
To all of you who have watched railgun
https://youtu.be/Dprjunc5xPM
But yeah, I tend to disassociate them
He also played Sherlock
Yeh
It took me 5 years to actually remember rdj's name
So I don't recognize VAs or even actors irl
I have a habit of disassociating characters from the people that play them
Railgun T for me
;-;
I cried
It is
When learning japanese hurts you ™️
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
Sissy is so completely divergent in tone that it gives me whiplash to read
it is a ridiculously over-formal form of address
The term Onee-sama is not a term of endearment
no
umm
Ahhh
That is such a horrible mistranslation of the term Onee-sama that it physically hurts me
the second one
<:TsubasaDisgust:349013662775902209>
Oh fuck it has sissy
it focuses only on Kuroko and the Railgun gang and not the larger index wide effects of it
But ddoesn't have the plot depth
It is the one suffering of Misaka fic that is actually good
<:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
Oh that first one
out of curiosity
Which one was it?
that's his schtick
who refuse to acknowledge the fact that *yes* Touma is very much a trump card that breaks all the rules
The only ones I have seen are by.....well idiots who think Touma is a wuss and Mikoto didn't need him to save her and stop the experiment
<:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
They don't like seeing her hurt
way too much
There hasnt been any story in the fandom like this because...well everyone loves Misaka
Now I need to write it out
he may even end up actively suicidal
Accel won't have as dramatic a change of heart
She won't be a naive teen crushing on her saviour
Misaka will descend to far far darkr depths
But the biggest change is the impacts on Accel And Misaka
Touma just conveniently saved him the need to step in and do it himslef
He needs the Misaka Network, and he needs them across the world
Because, they are important to Aliester
The Sisters will still live
Thing is
Well
And even if he does, he won't stay with her
I don't even know if I can finagle a reason for accelerator saving LO
Without that....lots of stuff is just....not going to be the same
but *Touma* stopping it made huge huge changes to all of those involved
The Project, of course, was never going to be completed
Especially given just how *important* the sisters themsleves are
Butterfly indeed
Yes
;-;
The pain
never comes across the experiment
He never goes searching for the clone that left him with the cat
Started to write a railgun fic in which Touma doesnt save Mikoto
I just hurt myself a little
Das okay
~~or both?~~
an actual devil or some cute tsun girl?
the devil's riddle?
and destroy the day's data
time to DL
the books had a different focus anyway
I've heard good things
I wanted to watch it
Good
Good or bad?
She will be happy that the anime slimmed her down LOL
AAAAA Misaki hype
girls tho, are A-rank
could be worse
well he sint all that bad imo
~~heresy~~
Miku is just 👌
I have to agree
no
:yumiyan
yep
Debating putting up a yuriko pfp lol
Kirei's VA was godly tho
LMAO
Not spoiled enpough
Omfg
That final series of fights
Esp s2
Good*
Mob is orgasmically goof
<@354402389282783235> ooooohhh yes
Lucky Star was brillaint lol but the humor is very much japanese
but the sort of "I am tired and just wanna fucking unwind" type anime
its nice I guess
So......yeah
its very very SoL
Hmmm
Well Mirai Nikki was meh imo
Again taht is
I still want to watch youjouhan shinwa taikei
That I absolutely loved
I really don't know, there were so many brilliant ass shows
My fav from this decade...
The story is just so much more *complete*
B follows the og manga ending
and Touma...well the anime really didn't do him justice sadly
That legit hurts
he has his one thing
like, no power trips
I found that really appealing
In a world of such amazing powers
He never gets an upgrade
;-;
and Kuroko gets fewer moments
One if my favourite arcs in anime
hooah
and S2 is....
ep5-6 is where that season's plot starts
Also....you really should continue railgun
Oh right
HYPE
Railgun T in 9 days
damn was it heavy handed woth the emotions
to catch up to the 2 seasons I missed
Rewatching AoT S1
Like at NT4, there is still stuff from OT that's unexplained
small tiny stuff
Not stuff like Touma's powers
and allows far too many inconsistencies
He leaves far too many details open ended
Basically?
he just does
He doesn't save people for rewards, or to get closer to them, nor does he expect it
Not every charcter plays a major part, and that's how touma is
And that, really, is excusable
Thats one of the many things
He leaves so much open ended
Its just so *sad*
and he allows the details to fall through the cracks
This is LOTR levels of sheer breadth
Like
Such wide scope
So many *interesting* characters
Like it could be so much more
and its *sad*
Index is thoroughly mediocre
On an objective scale of literary quality
And they are shit
he needs someone to tell him, no, this sucks, rewrite it
He pumps out literal shit at times
And slowed the fuck down
I *really* wish the man got a good editor/beta
Touma isn't one of them
I have a lot of problems with Kamachi's works
Anyway
HE certainly isn't the worst protag
Wait what
?????
Glad I didn't follow
so many threads
Well S2 remedies that
👌
The sheer dynamics of animating 3D Movement is just
The Sheer sakuga of AoT S1
Damn
A literal translation would be better LOL
The Japanese title is better
Huh
oh
What is the official trans?
Like its the literal translation lol
The Japanese title is equally stupid
is the title
that
I am scared of getting huert, so I dont see whats wrong in dumoing all my points in defnse
I've been hearing good stuff about it
is confirmed for *two* seasons?.
that shit
wait
and they explored the world rather than the character being op
I mean, sure, rimuru was op, but in a fun way
no idea
the last one that felt original in some way was slime
gonna fall into the same story line somehow
But yeah isekai
LOL
HYPE
RAILGUN T IN 2 DAYS
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
Cant be worse than Sissy
LMAO
The language is actually pretty simple surprisingly
XD
Which is why chihayafuru is best watched raw
Like if there was a decent streaming service for subbed anime, I would pay for it
I'd much rather buy good stuff
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
How are fansubs better than official subs 90% of the time
And why are there only 2 (well 3 if you count netflix) services thay stream anime internationally
Where is CR based at?
lmfao
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
Its not as bad as the summary for Railgun T
Anyway
So they don't know english
that is replacing every word with an english equivalent
thats not even translation'
That...is a bad translation
The lit. translation is "I am scared of getting hurt, so I don't think it's wrong to put all my points in defense"
Well its semi accurate?
which is...
I don't want to get hurt, So I will max out my defense
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
Its the complete opposite of the intended tone
Sissy is....
Like at least bonjour is the same tone
for Onee-sama
since we are doing the manga and shit in between too
will probably take a few more months till we reach 22R
NT7 just got done in #reread
Hmm
Kamachi would have put out a new novel
By the time we finish reread
Razorhead was right
good lord
Oh the new series
calm down
also lesser than a day for Railgun T
👀
<:ShiraBean:661294258795446326>
railgun T ep1 was good
Railgun T
calm down
10 minutes to air
why are you looking so deep into it
literally
MHA is meant for children
Them crunchy Subs came in like a wrecking ball
I thought I had escaped from it
God it makes me cringe everytime
<@122219992358846468> i feel you
I loved sisters noise because it was super appropriate
Huh
The anime originals were.... Yeah
Also that prompt lol
Gah
Upsetting
But yeah the crunchy Subs are...
Out*
Gjm is put already tho
<:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
when no one is talking about railgun
Ninjit
That scene changed the way I looked at toothbrushes forever
Heh
But definitely a really nice show
Also pretty hyped so take that into account for what it's worth
It's pretty good
The visuals on this were brilliant
CRYIN MY LIFE
Nice coincidence
Damn 99.9 came up on my Playlist
Lmao
Mob psycho 100 ending at 101
Also that's a nice thought lol
Okay
Ahh
That's hard
11 chapters over 12 eps?
A rarity in this age
Damn mob will be actually complete lol
Just about
Can they even make 12 eps?
Not much left to adapt
Huh
High key salty about it
I mean they even heavily hinted LAC
Or Russia
Well liberal arts city
Like hoover dam was it good
Sisters was just 👌
Also lol
Like I feel that it could have hit much higher levels of hype if it weren't for that arc
True
Lol
Railgun S og arc was depressingly mediocre
Sadly
I have to agree
Lol she did
The general shtick for index plots I'd always something moving in the shadows
Like... She works weird
And is barely justifiable within the framework of academy city
Meme villain
Well
And therestina was...
Too weirdly attached to erii
Uiharu was ooc
S1 was... Bad too
Ouch
That bad?
Really?
Kimiuso was nice
It takes time tho Sadly
Muse Asia
XD
To Aru majutsu no railgun
Ikr
Kagaku and majutsi?
Like the sub was just wrong
No that's what she says in jap
And cr just... Didn't Translate it
And she is like "Oh thats the bot she is all tsun tsun with"
Where mizuzu is plotting with saten and uiharu
There is this line
Like legit just wrong
Vadly
They mistramslated
Disregarding my beef with the usage of the term sissy as a translation for one-Sama there are so many mistakes
And am like *but why*
Cuz I sometimes don't get the raws fully
Like I usually watch both
It's baad
Or wait for gjm
Just watch raw tbh
Badly
For railgun T
It makes me cry
<@203444794737950720> the Subs... Are so bad
hush you
and made it more real
good
They could have given a food justification
like...
It makes it super inferior
but really weak
the author retcons a reason later
Properly that is
is not justified
Well the hatred
Clearly rady has never played RPGs
with not enough explanation
But they over did the hatred
It started well
I mean
Ugh
Tate no yuusha was....
And shitty net
Cuz better quality
But I usually torrent anyway
But muse Asia
Not railgun
It's available in my region
I just watch the og
Eh
But wh
Millhi is rich
Id that 7DS
*so much craopy isekai*
But ugh
It sounds interesting
I need to see
Hmm
But someone is suggesting it to me
Like I am severely put off by the entire genre at the mo
What differentiates LH from SAO?
> when youtube has better animation than a studio
Barely
7DS seems to suggest so
Which gave a perspective as to how a relationship between the two would be very unhealthy
There was this really nice shinji-Asuka story
Hmm
He understands what he is being asked to do far to well
Which is also his downfall
He is *smart*
He is being asked to shoulder a responsibility he understands and is bloody terrified of
Anyway, imo only kids believe tht shinji is a pussy
Lmao
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
That's the unit 01
Wait
The og animilf
~~even tho I agree~~
Them be fighting words
He is bloody brave for getting past his complexes
Also, shinji is not a pussy
/s
There is no fight
Asuka is best girl
Lol
You are basing your entire opinion on approx one hour of  air time in a side story of a series that has 45 novels, 4 other seasons of anime and 4 side manga.
One hour which doesn't even explain the wider universe that is index, toumas unique postioj within it and the sheer density of events that take place in that time period.
Then I request that you don't express it around me. Or at the very least, pipe it down a little.
OK, you don't like the character, you don't need to bring it up every time he is mentioned.
With zero context
It's like hating Maria, because you only saw her start a horrible sequence of event in G
(your hatred has been rather vehement, which is why I bring it up. And well the reasonings really stem from a lack of context wrt him)
I just said having so little context, it's really uncalled for (in my opinion)
Fair
Make no mistake, Misaka Mikoto would have died if it were not for him, because there are forces much larger than him or her in play
And just *what* Touma saved her from, which was much larger than just accelerator and sisters
His motivations and his thought process
You have close to zero context wrt his actions
Having only watched railgun, your opinion on Touma is really not appreciated
Carolnein
Uhhh
I do wish kamachi gave a better base for toumas attitude tho
Lol
Lmao
https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13463312/1/There-is-No-Paradise
~~hey you can read my most recent one~~
Yep yep
Even tho they are essentially the same as magicians when I thought about it
And all
Stuff like why esoers can't use magic
But usually not very specific
Which sometimes need better understanding of certain mechanics
I know significant spoilers because I try to write fics
Adaptive as all hell
Manipulator
Puppet master
I get little to no time these days tbh
#soon
*huh*
That sounds *interesting*
But not many spoilers so it's good
I hear good things about the arc regarding ||othinus||
;-;
Still
Nt4
Buuut based on what I hear, it wouldn't be possible
Oh evil Touma would be awesome
At least railgun T is hyoe
Ah well
😩
I shall stop
Sorry
Right right
It boggles the mind
Like
I did not attack, I asked them to understand that the opinion is based on an *extremely* limited perspective
Sorry
Anyway I shall stop
And I am allowed to express disapproval of it
His motivations don't have sufficient base
His character is not given sufficient background for example
Like at least have legit reasons
Sorry
It irritates me a lot
Sigh
Also <@476058996315389953> i apologise for attacking you over that.

I still believe you Should read the novels or at least watch more of the anime before forming an opinion on him. (I get equally irritated with LN readers who hate on Mikoto because for a long Time, she is just portrayed as violent tsundere who keeps beating up Touma because of embarrassment. It's a horrible dismissal of a character based on limited portrayal)
Dess
But I will discuss this one day with you
I have to sleep
Ehhj
I wonder if I should change my name to it's normal
Yes I know
I am not clinking that spoiler
He sees himself?
😱 😱 😱 😱 😱 😱
Are you implying what I think you are implying????
OHH
Oh
The memory loss is convenient
Ik ik
Mhmm
But at this point that's what it comes across as
Read*
I shall red more
We shall see
Aren't toumas too?
He wishes to save everyone.
They are yeah
It's similar to shirou, but Shiro us reasoning is far more... Well justified in universe
Like goes to the roots and does it well
It's shtick is that it's a very well done battle shonen
Well
But eh there is much that people miss out on on a daily basis so...
You're missing out
Lmao
Lol
Senjougahara is top tier waifu material
heh
Lmao
Tamanegi apparently means egg
In a side note
Knowing hee story
I feel sad for Misaki
I notoced that scene
Heh
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
No u
It was the biggest disappointment tbh
Until it wasn't
Franxx was great
Everyone else has shit taste
But my taste is the best taste
Great*
Hey gay is greay
My nose is forever blocked5
The pollen allergies are a mood
<:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
Half
I mean there are *some* cases where people legit over react, but not nearly as much as it presented as
And from what I see, people who call others SJWs are the ones who are far *far* more likely to misrepresent the views presented to them to make it look as non-sensical as possible, in many cases ignoring the wider context of the statement
It more like a counter reaction to excessive far right reactions to change
What even is an sjw?
funi full of sjws wut?
Why is porn anime?
They probably underestimated just how much it was porn and were agonizing over it since ep 1 before finally deciding to pull it
It's upto them
So they just pulled it, that's fine
Over it?
Was there some sort of uproar?
Chickening out has little to do with it
They didn't like it, and thus they removed it
Not really
It was there right from the get go lol
Not like it was hiding
But yeah, should have looked a little more before releasing dubs
For different reasons, but R nevertheless
Vinland is also rated R
Well it's not like there are degrees for R-rated
Ahh
It's more or less porn
I wouldn't call it dumb tbh
The memes be the best lol
His tastes are similar to mine (actually he is quite a bit more forgiving)
Hmm hmm that's alright
He usually makes it very clear that it's a personal view
Hey I liked that joke (and he has clearly not watched it), so
Lmao
(lowkey curious as to why you stopped tbh)
Heh he is great
Oh man
Netflix has like zero presence here
Lol
¯\\_(ツ)\_/¯
They decided to pull it and aren't sharing the full reasons, and they totally can
It's pointless tbh, since we don't really know what happened
Hmm hmm
It does to them, not so much to us
Does it really matter?
It may have been an internal issue
Sure maybe
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
Wait
I am you
Wait mo
Because you are me <@203444794737950720>
And he doesn't go out of his way to piss off people and is genuinely just nice in a way I appreciate
And he says enough truly thoughtful stuff to keep me engaged
But others may not
I personally do find it funny
People have different senses of humor
That's alright
Different types of good fights
Like the entire me ha genre breakdown he did
When he is serious, he says some really thoughtful stuff
He does say a lot of good stuff
Anyway
I am fine with it
His opinion is not absolute so
Hmm hmm
So it keeps my attention
Gigguk usually has more focus and his content is more well thought out
It's his style and he Should stick to it
Sure
Which is something I don't enjoy very much
He has a rambling, thoughts out there style
But it put me off of him pretty badly
I don't remember now
Like there was this vid of his where he was getting super salty over hentai I think?
How do I put it?
He gets... Salty
I don't like anime man much
Nt5
Yeh true
;-;
I haven't watched it yet
NOOOOOOO
No
Sorry about the spam
And thats all I have

And then suddenly she is with him in hawaii
And was like 'you don't have to face this alone'
End of NT2 Mikoto ran into touma
Wrt Mikoto
Why
Where
How
Like NT3 was like wuh?
Like shoehorned in
Mikoto was sorta forced into prominence tbh
Hmm
I love Shaft animation
Shaft
Am aware
Let's hope it turns out better than the seven deadly sins and their seven deadly frames of animation
Railgun T animation is going to go down the toilet
Fuck
Well
<:KirikaSob:674720015047720961>
No railgun today
~~symphogear is better~~
Is it good?
Like holy *shit*
That's why the ufotable fate is so fucking godly
The VN is not very dynamic
Ik
Lol
Fuck mw
||assasin vs lancer battle chase||
Like holy *fuck*
Like the action scenes of the HF movies
Can't wait for movie 3
Ikr
I am getting chills just thinking about it
Oh god fate zero is orgasmically goid
And heavens feel
And then the man has zero
Deet the deen
<:yamero:255877561601490954>

Misaki is bae
Heh
<@!203444794737950720> why were you right
😓
S3 cannot really be watched without the context Index S1 provides
....
but you sorta need Index s1 for Railgun S2
Well you do you
LOL
~~and railgun is better~~
Closest to chronological without being confusing
Railgun S1, Index S1, Railgun S2, Index S2, Index S3, Accel, Railgun S3
i beleive you rady
of course rady
y
2019 was especially packed in that respect
But there is a lot if really giid stuff
Which is fair
Well he didn't say most, he said a lot
<:seigi:303271863683907584>
It shows he *can* be a good writer.... If he tried
NT8-10 especially
Cuz it is legitimately is one of the peaks of kamachi's writing
You should read the next few novels fantasy
Lol
Genesis testament yeah
I think?
And now GT 2 is coming out?
NT has 23 novels
One*
You dropped it just before ine of the peaks fanatasy
And I say that as a massive reader if books
Honestly wouldn't reccomend the novels. Unless you have a streak of masochism
Uhh
I
Uhhh
I rate the manga higher tbh
The railgun manga and the index novels are... On par?
Otherwise, not really
Index is a good starting point if you started with the novels tbh
It just isn't that great
I *know* people will drop index
Read the books even further on
I watched index years later
Before I ever even knew that index existed
Honestly? I watched railgun first
I would tell you to read the books, but I legitimately cannot rec them in good conscience
Sigh
And well
Index is just a horribly flawed adaptation
<:SEIGI:405539944212201472>
the science goes from bad to worse
As someone who has read the novels
and science is just half of the universe
it gives me an apoplexy
the science is...so bad at times
the magic side of Index is far better explored
but that honestly is...sad
true...in part
and so many references exist to Index in Railgun
😓
But you really can't skip index for railgun S3
that I agree
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
But as an anime I just feel that the index anime are a horrible entry point and won't keep most invested
Oh <@87512939107450880> ny fav parts of the entirety of the raildex universe are NT8-10, OT2, OT16 and OT19-22
And actually did more than correct grammatical mistakes
If kamachi's editors did their job
Index could have been a global classic
Yeah no
Anyway
It kills me to see the mediocrity it chooses to wallow in
I wish kamachi had better editors
Also the first ep was so great
Lol
The visuals of OP1 were just too good
👀
<:Ruby_Cry:661198742099329035>
Maes hughes
Oh gdi
> They cut railgun on such cliffhanger
<@203444794737950720> ikr
Lmao
During the sisters saga
I actually started writing a fic in which Touma never saved Mikoto
This is a good adaptation of a good arc
Mikoto would be too if it weren't for Touma
Misaki is messed up in a lot of ways
||Dolly|| was one part which added on
If you intend to follow index I won't spoil
And, obliquely, why she lowkey hates mikoto
Damn NT11 and Biohacker reveal a bit more about Misaki
Indeed
Because mental control is natural to her
She isn't doing anything wrong
However from her pov, from her messed up perspective
As you should
I actually dunno if you watch index
Do you think you will get deeper into index?
A lighter shade than most
Like everyone in AC, she is grey
But she isn't really a *bad* person
There is more to it tho
It is
Not only because she can't read her
And she does really hate her
<@205859030051061769> there are a lot of reasons misaki hates mikoto
Where Misaka is a badass
The one part
You know what sucks
Yeah
She appears in nearly every volume
Like a *lot*
She becomes a lot more relevant in NT
In OT
Misaka was least relevant
Tbh dud
They made BR even more of a cluster fuck than it already was
It was bad
Anime does a horrible job of portraying the details
Man i will never get over noukan amd his cigar
AAA was dope af
Still at 13
And they all make *sense*
He elaborate on what systems arw used to design each spell
Anime skips all the explanation that kamachi does
Like I said
It isn't that random
Superior*
He is just superiors
Because he is a saint
Acqua wins
Because it just *does not* work that way
In the index novels
God science shenanigans have triggered me so hard
When its the exact opposite
Makes ot seem arbitrary
The anime skips all of that
Explain all tye magic
The books
That's the thing dud
Hmm
Railgun is a better adaptation of its source
Tbh
If you don't like index as a series its fine
Yesh
Railgun T is paused
More than a week
No
Next ep is hype af
<:yumiyan:230841435857879040>
I feel you dud
||nt2 will be a white screen of text||
NT anime will be good
<:yumiyan:230841435857879040>
They sorta cucked us mikotofags real hard
In the novel
She fucking plays with missiles
And basically included every other pointless bit
In thw anime
They cut it out
<:CarolTheFuck:617036187319795722>
I just hope they air the next episode and stop
monies
air time is expensive
its not something that can be done at a later time
<:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
S4 of index that is
it has 3 of the worst volumes of NT
But I doubt it will be
I hope S4 is as good as this
<:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
but the episodes have all been good
production schedule is fucking shit up
Hey its a good arc
One more
but the season has been hype af so far
corona is fucking up their schedule
<@!205859030051061769> new episode after 2 weeks
More or less?
Isn't it full h?
That ain't gonna happen anytime soon
> when covid is over
Well railgun hasnt ever done that thankfully
<:pepehands:588063076029431829>
<:yumiyan:230841435857879040>
yeah a 7 year gap does that
booo
anyway, pacing shouldnt be a problem for DR
miscounted
ahh sorry
16-25 will be dream ranker
This arc will end on the next episode
and they have 10 eps
DR can fit in 8-10 eps easy
Its much shorter than this
Fairly easily?
no recaps
The re aired some episodes
<:Thonk:679386937697501205>
What recap episodes?
and the next arc is much shorter
There was like a 3 min recap
because thats the end of the current arc
But kaguya-sama has been consistently great at developing its characters
It will even if you have
I mean
If you haven't, this season will be a treat
Have you read the manga?
~~twist.moe~~
Shes just adorkable
Villianess is great
Or sarazanmai?
Do I want to watch Gleipnir?
Lol
Left
Plus assorted manga
Nt22 and 22r, and gt1
Maybe
So we are maybe going to read gt2 in reread
AAA
Lmao
But it's been busy
Started it months ago
I have been stuck at NT20 for a fair bit tbh
LOL

Like, just whom are you calling a crayfish hmmmmmm??
Isn't she saying "Whom are you calling a crayfish"
.....Why do the subs sound off ;-;
The new subs..... is this rght? she says "Dare ga Zarigami oniyai datte?"
Nothing much, Miku washing dishes and bikki helping out
The new one
