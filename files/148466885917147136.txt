Someone already posted the attack animation earlier, I think you're good
Very carefully. ~~That's a plain lie.~~

Seriously, though, imagining her doing her big blade attack with this thing, or the one where she spins her bike and slashes in all directions, I imagine that would probably push Kiriya's tolerance for motion sickness to the limit
Akiko would probably have some words with Tsubasa if she ever made off with Accel's bike form, heh
Alas, it's over 14 years old now
I do wish I could have gotten that one that I posted, the Honda DN-01

You could use the Events feature to schedule things like birthdays or special releases or something, right? I feel like that may be a good idea, too, though I admit I don't know/remember what level the server needs to be for that function.
Pops up underneath the <#371105434771390465> channel, then you can pop it away into the archives once it's all done
Oh, also, reading on some of the suggestions above... Perhaps you could utilise the Thread feature for watchalongs?
I feel that the only reason I don't post in <#447132690349555712> more, personally, is that I feel like I would inevitably turn it into a huge infodump, and it would probably look like I took over the whole channel... heh
I'd hope so, cause I have a few of my own that I'd like to share while I'm here <:TamaRun:756516046201946122>
Yo! On recommendation from a fellow Symphogear fan in another server ~~with half my motivation to join being the emotes they were using in response to a previous conversation~~, I'm here! Though with all that being said, I do have other reasons to be here, haha. I hope we can get along!

Been a while since someone here said hi. So hi to all you new peeps!
The idea is to dart before things necessitate a longer (or permanent) break, haha.
And wanted to also talk about some of the stuff I found there. In any case, hi! Again.
My reputation for foolish decisions precedes me, I think. I came here again partially because I needed to fill the time while sifting through a Blu-ray BOX I just opened...
A good welcome to you! Hope you enjoy your time here.
I'm surprised some people keep count! I usually don't
GENJURO DATTO?!
Complete that, then you're onto the final season, XV
Ah, up to AXZ. Well, that's good - you're well past the halfway point
Just gotta be careful if you accidentally walk into a discussion about events you've not seen.
Dang, lmao
average miku fan vs average shem-ha enjoyers
You're certainly committed to that, if nothing else
In any case, enough of me gushing about how much I love this project. I'll let the music speak for itself another time. Time to head to bed
The result is the music and character project, DENONBU
What do you get when you mix Bandai Namco Entertainment, the electronic dance music scene, Mika Pikazo character design, and a cast that's 1/4 DEARSTAGE, 1/4 NIJISANJI and 1/2 seiyuu to round it out?
Guess this is the best I could do. https://www.ilca.co.jp/works/common-work/img/DEN-ON-BU/1.png
sadly there's not a lot of artwork which features all twelve original character designs at once on an image
This here is the key visual for DENONBU 1st LIVE -Make Waves-, which like the above art I posted earlier features the characters in their LIVE outfits
It *should,* cause it's a music project https://twitter.com/denonbu/status/1454285871608336384
... with the exception of the Shibuya Area, who tend to not want to change clothes compared to the rest of the characters
Also to be fair, this isn't their usual outfit
I was just posting this with the intention to plug the franchise this key visual comes from (and its upcoming 2nd LIVE this Saturday, which this visual is for)
... I didn't expect a response at all, let alone that quickly, I admit
If *any* of you recognise this or the characters in it, lemme hug you real quick <:ReinaCute:905055806985211914>
It's okay if you don't, though, cause that's exactly why I'm posting it here and now
Before I knock myself out... Lemme share this real quick. https://twitter.com/_kiato/status/1481462116410605578?s=20&t=q3jEWdFDKKIfjlfYFLcdXw
Image so powerful it transformed Miku into SD *and changed her clothes,* then back
It's probably the way the eyes look. So much of the signature look of Symphogear started with G and only got more consistent over time, I daresay, so the way that the season 1 key art and animation looks by comparison can be a sort-of reminder of where they once came from. Personally, I think that's something that can be acknowledged for any series that has some sort of art style change over time, even if you are a relative newcomer to a franchise.

(Take it from a person who began really digging into Gundam after a bout of anger that led me to leave a convention and spend the rest of the day at home, and subsequently discovering all of its various timelines after digging deeper.)
I assume this is related to a particular XDU event. All I can recall of this is that it's the same stuff they're wearing on the cover of the second XDU character album
tfw you don't know if it's edge or xv
and then they scrap it in Symphogear Super in favour of Gungnir Blue

After a while, Hibiki's inheritance from Kanade rings in my mind when seeing the shock of you people hoping that it didn't happen
O...kay. Not what I expected to see in my first few hours in this server.
On the eve of anniversary celebrations, too...
The way I saw it, these were literally the only thoughts that were circling through my head upon hearing the news
Anything I could possibly say about this situation would probably be shallow and inappropriate, seeming as I literally joined the server the *day* the news first broke over here, but if I were to use a Symphogear analogy, it'd be to inherit their contributions and not give up on life
Which would have been really bad cause today was practical assessments and we were supposed to be roleplaying in different scenarios to simulate a hospitality environment and test our response to different cultures
And, well, in this case it wasn't that I ran out of energy, moreso that I would not have enough when coming in today if I pushed myself to get down all the notes I needed to catch up in the course
And it makes me feel even worse because I know that the events that transpired leading up to this all began when I struggled to get out of bed this time last week, solely from my own sleep issues
The misinterpretation was from one part of the email where I wrote that I was sending it at 3AM (wanting to make a quick quip about how I was already losing precious rest time), to which they thought I was *gaming* until 3AM (which this time wasn't the case at all)
For the record, the week prior I had been overcome with a huge amount of fatigue which made me miss one of my training sessions, which was why I was playing catch-up this week
and I noted in that email that I had lost enough sleep as it is, so I was not about to risk even more
As a result of how slow I was going, eventually it was getting really late
Yeah, there is some missing context there. Basically, I was trying to explain in my email that, after finishing up with gaming for that day, I went ahead to catch up with my studies - albeit at a sluggish pace
See, normally you wouldn't see me talk so often on Discord at this time because I would have been in the middle of the course. But as you can see here, things have fallen through.
Needless to say, the events that transpired for me this morning left a hilariously bitter taste in my mouth.
And you know what's most ironic? At this point in the course, we were studying about social and cultural sensitivity, part of which also talks about communication barriers!
Come the next morning, and my email has been misinterpreted in a reply from said support worker, and I got so angry from it that I decide then and there that I would not continue the course.
Well, long story short, some mishaps relating to a lack of self care and the subsequent catchup I was attempting to do led me to make an email to my trainer and support worker, explaining that for the sake of my own health I would prioritise sleep to recuperate - I had already lost enough of it as is, and I could not go on any further.
Some of you may have seen in <#336297387863703552> that I talked about a course I was in on occasion.
IDK if what I'm about to rant about is appropriate for this channel, but... I need to vent somewhere.
I. Am. LIVID right now.
In any case, I think I'm done venting. Thanks to whoever came by and heard me out. I just needed to get these off my chest to make sure I wasn't about to punch my wardrobe later.
It just makes me go down a mental spiral knowing that much of what happened now is largely on me for various reasons
What makes me most upset is that I was really enjoying the course until then, and already had to restart it once prior because of circumstances beyond my control (I became a close contact for COVID-19 thanks to my sister who caught it, and I had to miss out on some very important practical assessments thanks to that)
It honestly just gets worse and worse the further I go back to see what the catalysts were for the events that happened, but I've already said plenty on that
One choice of poor words - perhaps on both ends - ended any motivation I had for this course
Cause if something like that upsets me mentally, then THAT is a huge mental barrier that is much harder to overcome than any of my daily impulses
It may seem counter-intuitive to some of you, but if I'm gonna try and change something about myself, I'm not gonna lie about what's going on with myself. I just wish the miscommunication didn't happen.
I mostly stay transparent about things like this because I know it's my lifestyle choices, and I want to keep myself in check
It was simply the way they replied to me after I sent the email that made me upset
Well, I guess I was trying to be transparent, heh. Mind you, that alone was not what made me upset
the only time I ever put there was the time I had decided to send the email, which was 3 AM
I did say I had commenced doing my studies after I had finished gaming, though I was never specific on what time
I keep saying I would have been fine if it weren't for the misinterpretation, but... Every time I repeat this to myself, I question it more. Would I really be fine? I'm not sure at this point.
I know that feeling all too well, heh
I knew I was the one at fault for getting myself into a situation like this
To be honest, I was gonna be fine, had that reply not happened
Think I may have simply forgotten that, heh
Which paid off, *many* years later, when she got her literal dream role of Jolyne Cujoh
Gotta get your start somewhere, really. I imagine Kira Buckland was also like that, too
I know of another example I can think of that is exactly like that, though I don't remember the name of said persona (and will refrain from mentioning the name of the guy behind it)
I don't know or remember exactly which name between LeeandLie and AmaLee is the one for her vtuber persona, which is important as a lot of content creators who later become vtubers sometimes like to keep those separate
so there's a part of me which has this gap in information wondering how she got from there to Marin
What honestly made this strange for me is that, having not kept up with her activities but hearing about her all the time, I - like most of you, probably - would have mostly known about her because of second-hand information, or recommendations on YouTube that show just how many anime song covers she's done over the years (and also given English lyrics to)
The gap between her debut as a vtuber and the announcement of being the English voice of Marin Kitagawa wasn't that long, all things considered
and her sheer mommy energy's got people flustered in collabs, lmao
To be fair, it was a more recent thing that happened
yes, I did do exactly that
then why the hell am I watching Gundam Hathaway without watching something very important to the title character's backstory
and so on...
What the hell is that claim that Kazami keeps making at the beginning
why does he keep pushing people away
like why the hell is Hiroto a depressed and isolated ace pilot
I guess, but at the same time, it's unavoidable that you *will* have to know a bunch, or none of the story beats going on in GBD:R will make any sense
Ah, for the original GBD, right. If I may suggest, at least get to Episode 13. You'll see some shit there.
it took *Gundam Unicorn's own scriptwriter* to flip it on its head for the sequel
You know what *really* sucks about this? No matter how you view it, if you wanna watch GBD:R, the original GBD is required reading
Now, I wasn't one of the *huge* detractors of the series like the majority seemed to be, but I know how hard it can be to comprehend what the hell is going on in GBD and wonder what the hell the point of all of it was
I have almost no doubt in my mind that this was Obari as heck
(but I admit, I don't know who actually animated this scene)

You know that the team at SUNRISE BEYOND are the GOAT with shots like this
Which episode, out of curiosity?
Plus, I can't stop gushing about Core Gundam
That, alongside the plot developments of Gundam Build Divers Re:RISE in general, are why that series is my favourite of the Gundam Build Series - even above the much-loved Gundam Build Fighters
Say what you will about the original series, but at least ||the legacy of the previous series is built upon|| in its sequel, and ||you even get a showdown between the current protagonists and basically EVERYONE from the previous series in a grand episode from the late stages of Season 2||
In a sense, this is probably why I like the universe of Gundam Build Divers better
The only time you see it? ||In a hobby magazine, where Build Strike Galaxy Cosmos and Kamiki Burning Gundam finally meet for a photoshoot.||
Here's the real kicker: ||the promised battle between Sei Iori and Sekai Kamiki, it never happens - not even after the Extra Battle Project||
things like the Core Gundam, 00 Raiser, and more than likely also some of the MAILeS from AMAIM Warrior at the Borderline/Kyoukai Senki (part 2 of which begins in April, as I just found out)
I imagine this is one reason why he gets to design a lot of alternate universe mechanics for the franchise - his designs are almost always *full* of gimmicks from the outset that can be replicated in Gunpla pretty easily
Specifically in this case, I'm talking about how Kanetake Ebikawa firmly believes that Gundam cannot exist without Gunpla
And why?

Because certain mechanical designers take that philosophy to heart
At the same time, even a person like me can't help but think that sometimes
to the chagrin of many who are becoming increasingly annoyed at how high-heeled his designs are
Ippei Gyoubu be *flexing* in that series with his mechanical design
Have you *seen* the Moon Gundam?
Fair enough, heh
If we go into the lore, at least, it seems that the Silver Bullet Suppressor is remodelled from the one stored aboard the Magallanica. Would at least explain where it came from, and potentially what resources they would have had available
Mind you, I don't really know why they specifically chose to do it this way
You'd need to counterbalance that
Part of me wonders if it was them just having a load of spare Silver Bullet parts they could utilise
Also, the Beam Magnum itself *isn't* an ordinary beam rifle, not by a long shot
The Unicorn Gundam is not your average mobile suit project, that's for sure
Do you think Mineva's Neo Zeon faction even has that kind of money to spare...?
Do you mean how it needs the spare arms to fire off the Beam Magnum more than once?
https://tenor.com/boHUY.gif
And unfortunately, they're still up to
*[AoSTH Sonic voice]*
No good.
You *say* that, but there *is* a light novel sequel that was bundled with the Blu-ray release...
https://tenor.com/bG3Gm.gif
the Satellite Cannon
After War Gundam X marked the introduction of one of my favourite weapons in the entire franchise
I appreciate this, at least, from AWGX
Problem is, the Frost Brothers are still up to no good
Probably a large reason why it - and Turn A Gundam - were never dubbed in English
It's unfortunate, what happened to AWGX. Forcibly cut off before they had a chance to properly resolve things.
Going from the 90's era Gundam shows to something a decade or so older, it's kinda jarring for most people I'd say
Still, it kinda shows that they fucked up when they decided to *not* do After War Gundam X
much worse in animation quality, and thus, completely jarring
Arguably worse in the US, apparently, because they followed up Gundam Wing with... *the original*
Guess you kinda have a point there. They cut After War Gundam X short.
Why did they suddenly have to switch to Zeonic ripoffs...
It took Build Strike for me to appreciate Cosmic Era design a bit more, though even then, it made me realise that I only really liked the design of things that Kira Yamato was piloting
Not considering the character who built it (and his backstory), no
because I always felt like he was mostly just ripping himself off
I am generally not the biggest fan of Cosmic Era mechanical design, especially Kunio Okawara's work
I guess I never really felt that vibe from any of the designs myself... Funny, too, because Build is the only reason I like *anything* from Cosmic Era
You might need to, what with Cucuruz Doan's Island coming up... lol
I promised myself I would finish Gundam ZZ first before watching CCA
Only because I still haven't finished Gundam ZZ
In any case, think I gotta call it. I have stayed up for way more hours than I should have... and I have a live concert to watch tomorrow
~~some people like bad company, idk~~
Who knows, they may be rooting for them *regardless* of knowing that they aren't the good guys
He's likely to not work on another project again after this is done... or, perhaps this is the one thing he wanted to get done before his time was up. Both seem like reasons that he would choose to do a project like that now
When the time comes, I'll be watching that while sending Yasuhiko off with a salute
Said last project, as it turns out, is the upcoming *Mobile Suit Gundam: Cucuruz Doan's Island*
it's for that same reason why he considers it to be the only Gundam for him... Makes a lot of sense, since he did work on it
... well, I'm paraphrasing here, but this IIRC was what Yoshikazu Yasuhiko said about it, while also hinting at one last project he would be working on that was related to it
in the end, First Gundam was always about the little people in the war
You know what really gets me?
I hear the Federation's especially corrupt in Hathaway's Flash, though I can't comment on anything beyond what I've seen of the animated adaptation
If it's anything amusing, in the end, Syam Vist was more or less correct
||Nothing really did change in that regard, and hell, may have gotten even worse||
Not when the very reason for Zeon's rebellion was more or less thanks to them
I'm not really sure if I could believe the Earth Federation were ever firmly in the middle, personally... lmao
Eh, can't say I blame you
The moment you become self-aware of these things is the moment you realise the truth
TBH, I'm pretty simple, and I don't like to hate on things all that much. So perhaps I have a higher tolerance for certain things compared to others that would make those same people wonder if I even have any sort of taste at all
We'll be due for news for G-Witch pretty soon... Let's see if that holds true when the time comes
Pffff
When the time comes, Turn A shall reset everything
and we, as humans, shall repeat our mistakes time and time again of buying ever more Gunpla
Is that I personally consider it a representation of Sunrise's ambition to continue making new entries, and Bandai's ambition to continue profiting off of it
I think the funniest thing about the existence of Turn A, both as a mobile suit and as a series...
Is humanity doomed to repeat the same mistakes?
*Probably*
cause the status of her mortality is constantly reversed
Maybe we'll actually find out what the hell happened to Jun Kazama
but then all of a sudden there's *Leroy Smith*
So much of this is Tekken 3, oh my god
SUNRISE BEYOND has a ton of people who were part of G-Tekketsu, as well as GBD:R, on the team
You sure about that?
Sure, Bandai may be out there to get the big bucks for merch...
It's very odd to have a series which is explicitly said outright to be a collab between Bandai's hobby division and one of Sunrise's newest studios
The reason why I think it has *everything* to do with them is solely because of what kind of collaborative effort that Kyoukai Senki is
I admit, kinda sidestepping it a bit here, but still
rather than, well, the actual writing
Cause I guess that was the angle I was trying to go for with that statement
Is it too much to think about what their priorities may have been? On the side of the producers, I mean
that studio is all about hand-drawn animation, compared to some other branches of Sunrise
And, well, in regards to 3D... That's actually impossible for SUNRISE BEYOND
Mind you, I'm not saying that the story doesn't have issues, it's just that I'm trying to think that perhaps they put that to the wayside compared to the action.
What I'm trying to say is that they may be focusing a little *too much* on that point, moreso than most other series, because the articulation in particular is supposed to be the major selling point of the High Grades for this show, to the point where there is an entire gallery on the BANDAI SPIRITS special website for it dedicated solely to recreating shots from the anime with nearly the exact framing to show you that it is indeed possible
That is my point, though. The red flag is them putting perhaps a little too much focus on it. A double edged sword, in my opinion, as it means that when the action does happen, it is pretty spectacular, IMO. Then again, I personally didn't mind the way Kyoukai Senki was handled (aside from perhaps the more political undertones).

Man, IDK... This is probably a terrible take, but I like how a lot of the story is about the little people in the war, as it gives me vibes of First Gundam and White Base's journey, though the current format of a SUNRISE BEYOND work may mean that they won't have enough episodes for some of those plot points to sink in before moving onto the next one for some people.
And yet, they wanted to also do it in a sense of "What if this were built IRL?" so they had KEN OKUYAMA DESIGN on board to verify all the moving parts at an industrial level
At its core, one of the main goals was producing mechanical designs that could be translated over to model kits, with their articulation in particular being intact
Perhaps it was more evident that things may have been a bit strange for Kyoukai Senki when it was revealed from the get-go to be a collab between SUNRISE BEYOND and BANDAI SPIRITS
I recognise at least four of them - Hisako Kanemoto, M.A.O, Yuma Uchida and Yuhko Kaida - as I have seen works they were in before.

And for those who may be curious, Yuma Uchida is Maaya Uchida's younger brother!
a lot of Gundam fans seem to be very annoyed at him because he's sticking high heels on EVERYTHING
Like, take Ippei Gyoubu, an example I really love talking about
There's definitely a signature with several mechanical designers, it feels like
Ahahahaha, the Obari Ittoryu
THEN, you get to MG 1/100 Wing Gundam Zero EW Ver.Ka, the newer kit
because you have the original MG for Wing Zero EW, which is simply MG 1/100 Wing Gundam Zero EW
Yeah, funny story about that, this gets REALLY weird with Wing Zero in particular
Oh, you mean the Master Grade Ver.Ka stuff?
heck, you go look at Cucuruz Doan's Island, that's straight up his RX-78-02 straight out of Gundam THE ORIGIN
though I guess it doesn't help that some of the more popular depictions of classics like the RX-78-2 are directly based on his redesigns these days
I think I get what you mean by that, heh
if Katoki is attached to anything, it WILL be decal hell
also *decal hell*
that may be why they don't have their tendency to do CG stuff
Also, by technicality, Xebec was *closed*
Part of that may be because he's very heavily involved with the production process of Gunpla, more than most other mechanical designers are when working with Gundam
not that I don't enjoy them, but even as a fan, so many of his designs (and redesigns in MG Ver.Ka) are filled to the *brim* with it
dear *god,* are they filled with gimmicks
Sure, I can get why his shit sells, but
Correction: *Hajime Katoki* is arguably the bigger part of the problem, lmao
... then again, the other major reason is probably because *Unicorn Gundam is so complex, it took several years of Gunpla engineering to come up with the best version of it being fully transformable*
Gonna guess that's why a lot of the more cinematic works are being done with a lot of CG instead, haha
Definitely feels like we're missing out on the greater conflict at hand, heh
Think it may have been Masami Obari... If it wasn't that, then it would have been someone else in the behind the scenes special they put out before GBD:R Season 2 came out
I feel like the distinguishing thing about the Sunrise Beyond Gundam works is that it's specifically been stated to be hand-drawn, at least for Gundam Build, and though I'm probably treading over old ground by saying this, I wanted to do so because I'm trying to remember exactly who mentioned it
Righto. Let's just hope we get some info pretty soon, haha
I guess more or less, the idea of having all the hand-drawn focus go to Sunrise Beyond is more or less marked by how much of their staff are kinda carried over from that
Also, huh. I didn't realise this, but G-Tekketsu was originally done by Studio 3.
Dear god, though, I'm being reminded of how many franchises as well as studios are under the Sunrise banner
We'll have to see, haha.
So you're thinking they're likely to be on the staff of G-Witch?
I can't blame you for the guess in any case, but with all these unknowns, it could still be anything
The guess you had was more or less just running off of the more recent trend of new Gundam series, isn't it?
G-Witch will be interesting for sure, but... Did we even have a confirmed studio at all? We didn't, did we?
rather than being an animation in its own right/alongside the game it's being shown in
They will be airing the Urdr-Hunt part alongside G-Tekketsu SE, I've heard, and perhaps this is just petty of me, but I always considered Urdr-Hunt's animated segments to be part of the game from the beginning, since that is what they were originally created for
that's the whole draw of G-Tekketsu Special Edition, actually, because all the stuff we'll be seeing in it is more or less what we'll be seeing in the (still upcoming) mobage, Mobile Suit Gundam IRON-BLOODED ORPHANS G
Not alongside, it's literally part of the game itself
You think? Guess it wouldn't exactly surprise me, given that the other typical Gundam studios are busy doing other things (like Gundam Hathaway: Son of Bright)
and IIRC the staff from G-Tekketsu reunited under that studio for that purpose
G-Tekketsu Special Edition is SUNRISE BEYOND, I'm fairly sure, since it'll also feature Urdr-Hunt which they were responsible for in terms of animated cutscenes
Assuming SUNRISE BEYOND handles it, anyway. Sunrise - or rather, Bandai Namco Filmworks come April - has a ton of studios under its belt, responsible for various series
Either way, I don't mind being corrected in this regard, lol
Perhaps I am kinda grasping at straws here, but IDK. I just feel like it would be odd if something that was marked as "SUNRISE BEYOND √ó BANDAI SPIRITS" since its announcement wouldn't have some influence from the latter in some way
Both of them are primarily hand drawn, as far as I know, compared to things like the big Studio 1 UC stuff
Obari's current profile picture on Twitter is Terry Bogard, from the KOF XV animated short
He remembers his legacy
Oh, of course he would, haha
Apparently the redesign was spearheaded by Kunio Okawara, which I found pretty interesting considering considering that the primary influence seems to be in the colour scheme
The RX-93ff Nu Gundam, the real life statue of which is in Fukuoka as we speak
Here's the thing that's had *everyone* talking
And on the note of Nu Gundam designs... I assume you've already talked about it here, but since I'm on the subject https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/gundam/images/b/b9/RX-93ff_%CE%BD_Gundam_Front_CG.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20220314031840
Perhaps I'll take a look for it later.
Oh?
Ah, here we go!
https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/gundam/images/6/64/Nu_Gundam_Illust_Masami_Obari.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20190409011533
This is reminding me of the one time Masami Obari drew the Nu Gundam... One moment
Hold on, in response to Millhi? lol
How do you think the image came to be?
While the above I posted is less distinctive in terms of its shadows compared to, say, his artwork for the covers of G-Reco The Movie, I figured I'd post it because it also comes with a funny story, lmao
https://twitter.com/ippeigyoubu/status/1276336394156126208?s=20&t=JEXViankgdtZHpAJByibDw
I also wanted to post this on the note of Gyoubu, because I *love* his very cel-shaded style
I haven't seen much super robot stuff myself, perhaps I should fix that sometime, lol
he's responsible for designing the ILeS
I apologise if I do derail for a moment, but I wanted to go back to Ippei Gyoubu for a moment, because I remembered he's also a bit of a mascot designer https://twitter.com/ippeigyoubu/status/1476152919540269064?s=20&t=JEXViankgdtZHpAJByibDw
I think I do see part of his signature even back in the older designs, though. Seems that they all have curved points
Wow, what the heck, lmao
HOLY KIRIKA BLADES BATMAN
Oh? I'm kinda curious, though I'm mostly just going by what I observed of his designs (and also what some people ended up complaining about with stuff like Varguil, which is linked to Sazabi)
https://twitter.com/yanase_t/status/1286303661220487169?s=20&t=fErJVQkezQPrMou3gDFt5w Man, I really love his design for Gundam Aegis Knight
I wanna add to what Blockio said about favourite mecha designers by mentioning basically Ebikawa's partner in crime, Takayuki Yanase.
Dude did mechanical design for *Death Stranding!*
Additional accents, hmm...
Ippei Gyoubu = high heels, tron lines everywhere. Also has been reinterpreting a lot of UC as of late.
Naohiro Washio = *Curved legs.* I didn't realise it until later that things like the Gundam Thrones were the predecessor of how he would design things like Gundam Barbatos, and I bet you it was also entirely the reason why the Gundam Frames are shaped in the way that they were.
Kanetake Ebikawa = **Transparent parts EVERYWHERE!** Seriously, most kits with a design by him will contain them somewhere.
Oh? Well there you go
The Efreet Custom remains one of my favourite UC units
I feel like it's difficult for me to enjoy most monoeyes, which is unfortunate because there are some that are pretty kickass
I mentioned this before, but for whatever reason, I only really ever liked things that Kira was piloting when it came to Okawara design in Cosmic Era
And I think the complete opposite
I think Cosmic Era soured my perception of Okawara by a fuckton
BLESS
I definitely have a type for mecha design, lmao
Combined with my necessity for sleep, I think I'll call it at that. My apologies to anyone who jumps into this channel next and just finds a *wall* of Obariposting
https://twitter.com/G1_BARI/status/1351082186141794310?s=20&t=dByHRZkfejl_J8JZmGEG5Q Who'd have thought you could get an Obari Ittoryu with a *sniper rifle...*
https://twitter.com/G1_BARI/status/1469549308194492422?s=20&t=dByHRZkfejl_J8JZmGEG5Q
*BEARGGUY-SAN DESU*
Nah, I think you're right on this one. The *fun* part is finding out how old the image actually is, cause this was a 2021 repost I'd assume
https://twitter.com/G1_BARI/status/1473659793995108356?s=20&t=dByHRZkfejl_J8JZmGEG5Q Ah! Wonder how far back the original image dates.
... and speaking of, here's a montage https://twitter.com/G1_BARI/status/1483306897574817792?s=20&t=dByHRZkfejl_J8JZmGEG5Q
the goddamn Obari Ittoryu in Wooser
oh god, is this from Wooser https://twitter.com/G1_BARI/status/1484887739682082822?s=20&t=dByHRZkfejl_J8JZmGEG5Q
Barbatos Lupus Rex, and Gusion Rebake Full City... if I'm not mistaken in those head designs
Here's one he did for G-Tekketsu
Oh, woah, speaking of fun Obari drawings... https://twitter.com/G1_BARI/status/1498326128863371273?s=20&t=2FFLwk7UdonuGRYLjxfQWg
I think the funniest thing about going through Obari's Twitter is seeing if I'll come back to the tweet he made about the fact that he had to animate a Gundam *blushing*
Gotcha. I figured I'd post this here since I saw this while trying to find Nu Gundam drawings he did
https://twitter.com/G1_BARI/status/1502640492353241091?s=20&t=dByHRZkfejl_J8JZmGEG5Q By the way, is this the image you were talking about?
hence why it's the likely reason it serves as his current profile pic
basically, pretty much everyone realised that Obari drew Terry in the KOF XV short in exactly the same way as the OVA, a work he did back in 1994
The old Fatal Fury OVA
You know why I mentioned it, though, right?
Huh. Obari responsible for putting in a Silhouette Formula design into one of the Battlogue series https://twitter.com/G1_BARI/status/1504061675460128771?s=20&t=dByHRZkfejl_J8JZmGEG5Q
That sounds about right. For certain special animations, though, it will be unique.

I asked about this because the sheer amount of rendering prevented the Gundam Nouvelle from firing all of its funnels on the Nintendo Switch version, otherwise it would overload the system!
If anything, this is why SD GUNDAM BATTLE ALLIANCE is pretty notable, as it's the first SD Gundam game in a long time that isn't the outgoing SD GUNDAM ONLINE to actually use 3D models, IIRC
Beam/projectile effects, too? I do have to wonder.
And, well, I happen to own the game (G Gen Cross Rays) myself, too. It's the sheer amount of rendering which makes the Nintendo Switch version crash if you leave it on too long.
Oh, why am I shoehorning into that conversation? Cause I've actually talked about it before with others!
I think the other part of it is that you can't animate certain things accurately to the source material if you don't do it via video files, lol.
this is the very reason why I don't like to rank my favourites
Ah yeah, SFV Gill
https://tenor.com/beYH5.gif
Man, this is weird to think about, knowing both the source material as well as the manga having their own (and MAAAAAN I kinda wish they went with Shirow Miwa from the latter, lmao)
Apparently a media mix series originally
And then you have Glory of the Losers which is pretty damn bloody
Ever wondered why Busou Shinki, Frame Arms Girl and Megami Device all have simliar character designs for the majority of their kits? It's cause the same guy designed for all of those lines
... and also mecha
That's kinda the whole thing with Fumikane Shimada character design, I'd daresay
Concur with this... sadly...
That's probably Frozen Teardrop moreso than GoL, but eh
https://www.gundamkitscollection.com/2019/10/modeler-made-classic-gundam-0079-scenes.html
Well... Someone made a sculpture out of that - and many other off model frames of the anime
So I shared a particular shot from First Gundam before, that infamous shot from Cucuruz Doan's Island
I think that's a strange thing for me in particular, cause I tend to be on *their* side when it comes opinions on certain series and/or characters. I couldn't give you any specific examples off the top of my head, but for whatever reason when it comes to certain media like games and anime, stuff that's generally liked by Japan and disliked by the West is stuff that I'm into
I was gonna say, haha
Though to be fair, GoL was more or less material to tie in all the extra manga stuff they had to the events of the main series, and was published alongside Frozen Teardrop IIRC (to which it had several ties, of course)
... sorry, can't help it whenever I see Akira Ishida in the credits of anything
KIRAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Fair enough, haha
Just had to make sure cause I was like, "Hold on, neither Miyuki Sawashiro nor Fairouz Ai were in Cross Ange as far as I remember"
Okay, we got that cleared up, heh
To be fair, that was *my* first assumption, too
Ange as in...?
Next question I have, then. Ange?
Hold.
I ask cause as of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Stone Ocean, the role is in the hands of Fairouz Ai
Which one? The old one?
~~could simply have never said it in the first place~~
I'm **done** with that conversation tbh
outside of Gundam but still Sunrise, there's also Kyoukai Senki (which, between it, GBD:R and G-Tekketsu Urdr-Hunt, makes me think that hand-drawn animation is supposed to be SUNRISE BEYOND's specialty when it comes to mecha animation)
Mostly the Gundam Build Series in that case
In any case, I was mostly asking because for Gundam at least, I kinda get the sentiment and I kinda dont, when it comes to hand-drawn vs CG. Then again, perhaps I shouldn't use only Gundam to judge the way it typically is for mecha anime these days, since there's a lot of them out there... Still, Gundam's only really been relying on the CG to animate their mecha for Universal Century works, it feels like. At least to me.
Knight armor mecha, huh
Ah. Hmm...
That's not what I was asking, I was asking about *which series it is,* lmao
Everything if I don't know what it's referring to, lol
Come again?
A marked date, huh? Seems that Ruri Asano will be getting busy pretty soon
(for those wondering, she was the winner of the open audition to be the character Ecute for this season)
tbh I don't think I care much about who best girl is myself
*Spicy take.*
Did I end up ruining the image? <:TamaSmug:759367540228620288>
Oops
Kenichi Suzumura, I assume you guys are talking about (for Julius' voice)
You know he's also Shinn Asuka, right
IDK why but I always found it funny after it was pointed it out to me
Random thought, but you know what's funny about the Kira/Athrun fight? Athrun was planning to clamp Aegis to Strike and fire point blank, but he didn't have the energy for it.
Years and years later in Gundam Build Divers Re:RISE, Kazami succeeds where Athrun failed by pulling it off against Fake Nu Gundam with his Gundam Aegis Knight
I'm gonna head to bed now
but in any case, I digress
which is weird because the JP soundtrack is like
all hip hop for bosses and game over
and also US soundtrack inducing *nightmares*
JP soundtrack a banger, though
... I don't know if they'll do CD, personally
Biggs? lmao
Such a speedy advancement in technology was also only possible because it omitted the one thing that a true solar reactor had - the TD Blanket
They did not merely catch up in the 5 year gap between seasons, they were catching up before the operation that forced them into hiding
it was the very existence of the GN-X which forced Celestial Being on the back foot
and also, they were caught up to during the first season
That's the thing, though, their technology was leaked
That is also true. I didn't think to mention it since I wanted to illustrate their inherent flaws first
Still can't believe they got away with making ||Ryu's kamikaze sacrifice|| the Guntank ult
For those wondering, that is the shorthand of GUNDAM EVOLUTION, the upcoming Overwatch-style FPS featuring mobile suits in place of heroes
Maybe GUNEVO? lol
and especially the Sisquiede
Phoenix Gundam remains one of my favourites
I wish they would make proper HGs out of the G Gen original units
For anything that isn't Gather Beat, they sometimes call it "historical" titles, and until GGCR, they always covered UC and some extras from side stories
so named because the original Gather Beat was the first one, yes
G Generation titles which are crisis crossover type deals
I don't know if they will ever do a Gather Beat style entry ever again
GGCR is the antithesis of G Generation Genesis, heh
It isn't that big of a damage reduction once you got good enough units, lol
cause then they switch to the other by 0087
or e-pacs, I forget which one was in use back in U.C.0079
E-caps
Wooooooord. Especially since you can get them from the demo early on
(Edit: Truth be told I just wanted to speed towards 00 QAN[T] Full Saber)
There are numerous callbacks with other designs, like the 0 Gundam running out of GN Particles in a similar manner, and also the Earthree Gundam running low on energy (which should come as no surprise since they are both based on the RX-78-2)
Very early on, at least, when Amuro was still a novice. It's a well known trait of the Beam Rifle for this reason, right down to the capacity - 16 shots
I remember him a lot because he's voiced by Mitsuki Saiga
Arios, if only because it's relatively boring for me. That thing carried me early on in GGCR, though, cause I transferred an Abulhool and immediately made a Kyrios out of it as soon as I could
Somewhere like episode 34
Wonder if that was to do with the way Gundam 00 had to be split into seasons... Apparently Neil's demise was supposed to come later before the decision was made to split Gundam 00 into two seasons
Heh, won't lie when I say I love Exia as a design. Apparently the 00 QAN[T] head is supposed to call back to it, though obviously the rest of the MS is full crazy
my mans Kanetake Ebikawa can't visualise things the way he wanted to :((
Could be 26 if it is like GBD:R, lol
RX-78-2 Beam Rifle had a shot limit, Celestial Being MS were super specialised, Unicorn needed the protag to grow a spine before it became the overpowered terror it is infamous for...

That aside, if I'm being honest, I never really was a fan of the whole battery limitation myself. It just felt like a huge block compared to all other series I had seen.
My guess is a Naohiro Washio or Ippei Gyoubu design. It feels like it has elements of both of their styles to me, with the heels, the curves and especially the glowing lines for the Gyoubu style.
Aisha was another one that suffered such a fate (Vivian Hsu was her voice and likeness)
all other celebrity voice characters died in that show after a few episodes
Some say she got off much better because she went unvoiced as it meant she didn't have to die
basically, much like Takanori Nishikawa and his two characters
because she was involved with Gundam SEED with OP songs
Nami Tamaki
I mostly remember her because her game voice is Makiko Ohmoto, or Kirby if you prefer
Oh, you mean Shiho Hahnenfuss?
where she is one of the two pilots of the Amatsu Hana and later Amaterasu (though she will say the line with any Gold Frame)
Kazahana Azure, for example, despite still being very young as a playable unit in that game, will acknowledge the Gold Frame as a nod to her role in *Princess of the Sky*
Not gonna lie, GGCR remains a blast for me because of how many special lines there are if you put characters in certain units or situations
I always thought that Cosmic Era design had too much backpack for ny tastes
and one of the two pilots is supposed to be REALLY YOUNG
all for a single bisection
that thing uses Voiture Lumiere to zigzag through space at ridiculous speeds
God, that reminds me of the animation the Gold Frame Amaterasu has in GGCR
Providence Nix, I forgot about that one
OH, RIGHT
Dreadnought, Providence, Providence ZAKU, Legend...?
Nishikawa was basically in tears when GUNDAM SEED PROJECT ignited was announced, cause it meant the movie was finally happening
Takanori Nishikawa firmly believed in the Gundam SEED movie
tbh he's also a passionate person when it comes to Gundam SEED
You think? lmao
The new lore dump found on that release eventually also appears in the description of the unit in GGCR
basically, Heine Westenfluss' Destiny is hinted at existing somewhere in Cosmic Era in storage
but for this specific release (HG Cosmic Era), they have NEW lore just for that
Typically produced in limited numbers, this colour variation
So here is a somewhat egregious example
https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/gunplabuilders/images/a/a7/HGCE-Destiny-Gundam-Heine-box.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20190727025755
PFFFFFFF
And sometimes for some really weird units, too
It's when model kits are the source of a lot of info you wouldn't hear otherwise
You know the real issue with Gundam lore sometimes, on that note?
Not for everyone, though.
Also more or less the source of my infinite rambles.
Tends to happen when I have read up on so much info for a particular series that it just triggers impulses for me to find it again if the subject is brought up
Bad habit of mine, heh.
and they will even sacrifice their lives to protect that secret
so parts of the process were omitted even to CB engineers
the entire process was a zealously guarded secret
Actually, it goes further than that
compared to, yes, the centuries it originally took to make them
and by omitting it, they could mass produce those much easier
Basically, the GN Drive [T] omitted the one thing that causes a true GN Drive to operate indefinitely
(Wonder what's going on with the Netflix live action Gundam...)
(Wonder if anyone will understand what that one means...)
shoutouts to GBF Episode 8
Tag me with your best guesses on the G-Witch mecha designers
Well, I'm gonna catch some sleep... It's already nearly 10 AM. I really should stop distracting myself with things like this

building the nanoblocks was totally worth it though
LMAO FAIR POINT
Cause it's in GGCR as well, right?
I guess the twirl it does is a signature animation?
Definitely more of a Justice or Aegis guy when it comes to Athrun Zala units
Never was a fan of it myself
The one everyone mocks him for? That's Saviour Gundam, yes
It's seen early on in First Gundam, even, where Amuro has to carefully strike the enemy to not cause further damage to the colony
I mean, if you don't strike a part which is volatile, it is possible
"I represent the School of Master Asia... Wait, that's wrong, you idiot!"
they had to replace some stuff
It's cause the Duel was damaged, wasn't it?
if I like it, I like it, and that's good enough for me
I guess in terms of anime OP/ED, I treat them the same way as I do with a lot of music
On that note, I have a GUNDAM SONG COVERS 3 album I still need to rip...
Huh, took til 2017 until they were fully allowed to use the songs again, it seems
The guy who originally made the songs which would become the OPs to Zeta
Neil something was the guy's name, right...?
I forgot about that trivia
specifically, I'm thinking of Zeta's second OP, the song that launched Hiroko Moriguchi's career

and I guess you do have a point there, haha
I only disagree slightly if I turn back the clock a bit to some of the older OPs, though that may be because of their significance in other respects rather than being an icon in itself
Hmm... Guess I can see what you mean, somewhat
One that's an icon in its own right, I guess?
Certainly, those lyrics do stand out
My life I trade in for your pain
I think a large part of me accepting DAYBREAK'S BELL was because I also like Journey through the Decade
and I will always hail it as my favourite Gundam 00 opening
DAYBREAK'S BELL has to be the song that got me fully into alternative rock music
If we're gonna gush about mecha OP/ED... https://youtu.be/VUOgmg0RXrE
beatMARIO is one of those peeps who has done it in karaoke, funnily enough
Half the vtuber karaoke I have ever watched have this as a staple
https://open.spotify.com/track/0AiRpK3u9OeM37Wsdkk8eJ?si=ou174kvuSh6ziCUO257pNA&utm_source=copy-link This. Damn. Song.
Never seen it, never knew the meme until I asked about why vtubers sing it so much in karaoke
Oh god, Genesis of Aquarion
I'll probably end up as a dead cat from my own curiosity, though
Mind you, I still have a lot to catch up to when it comes to Gundam instalments, so who am I to judge ones I have not yet seen?
Would have been 30 odd years ago, right?
I mean, how are we to know how the dude felt back in the day?
Turn A itself didn't have a lot of death in it
but that is more or less why I was curious
Turn A was *after* he won the battle, not during
I do have to wonder how he eventually won his battle with depression...
I have to look it up again, but IIRC what I said earlier was basically what Tomino said about ||Katejina||
And what gets me is that one of the characters who didn't die? Apparently it's because being left alive in the state they were in at the end was worse than death
which is why it had so much death in it
Victory was peak Tomino depression arc apparently
(don't get me started on how much I love GN Sword variations, you'll never hear the end of it)
(yes I'm still awake)
Oh yeah... I forgot the GN Sword II existed. I usually remember the GN Sword III
Not the greatest foot to start off on, haha
It was my introduction to Kensho Ono
you know what really sucks about ARC-V for me?
... even if the reason I (initially) like it is for the meme, as is the case with KANA-BOON's Silhouette
I think many of my favourite units usually have some sort of powerup gimmick or transformation
I'm not the biggest MA fan myself
Psycho Gundam in G Gen, anyone?
cause GP01/GP01Fb and GP02A were designed by Shoji Kawamori
I do like it quite a bit myself, though I'm not sure if I'm as sold on it as I am the other Gundam Development Project units
GP03 Dendrobium. Comprised of the Dendrobium Orchis a massive weapons platform, and the GP03S Dendrobium Stamen as the actual unit.
Plus, there are curvy Gundams...
While I'm more of a Gundam-type fan myself, I can respect the passion for Zeon units, and the derivatives in other timelines
A LOT of people care about monoeyes. Seriously, one server I'm in is filled primarily with Zeonic fanatics
||Figures, haha. I just wanted to know since it's one of the signature moments of the Amuro-Char rivalry||
||Technically... Isn't there one sword fight at the end? Right before Char and Amuro hug, and also that's where Char gets poked in the head||
Some people speculate - or fear - that we might one day actually make a solar elevator system and have economic blocs like those in Gundam 00
I have never seen this series myself
Channel created in March...?
GBN Version 1.78 would like to know your location
the only thing I have seen of anything 08th MS Team related is a GIF of a Beam Saber being held with both manipulators to focus more power into it
You have to remember, the Titans existed long before many of those stories
You sure it was just to appease them...?
So what conversation led to this channel looking like current affair programmes showing security camera footage?
then you get the Robert Lee exposition on how a mobile suit and its weapons work, followed by the myth
cause it sounds like the sort of thing they might test
For whatever reason that sentence made Mythbusters come up into my mind, lmao
https://tenor.com/view/myth-busters-grant-imahara-totally-busted-busted-gif-5323147
Second this. Pick your poison on TV series or movie compliaton (and Re;surrection), as while most will recommend the former, the latter is what the upcoming *Z of the Recapture* will apparently follow up from
Gosick is a favourite of mine. IDK what else I would recommend beyond my myriad Gundam recs, though
Limited variant of something that released 12 years ago, too, lmao
https://tenor.com/view/kamen-rider-gaim-kamen-rider-baron-kumon-kaito-loser-gif-15923951
Dude still does the role, even, in things like this https://youtu.be/-pEsCFlUdac
I wonder if people even realise that Mikishin is Takumi Fujiwara
https://tenor.com/view/initial-d-takumi-bonk-gif-21995821
(to be fair, I do. A lot.)
... and, well, how can one forget how long he's been playing the role of Kojiro (James)
I ask as someone who has seen Initial D, where Mikishin was the protag
What do you mean, "he finally gets a main role"?
Wait, what?
Thought it'd be more like that. Well, uh... Can't say I share your enthusiasm, lol
And I seriously hope there will be, cause the manga events have gotten to the point where (MAJOR spoilers) ||Rena Sayama obtains an Ultraman Suit, specifically Ultraman Suit Marie||
Perhaps that can't be helped, though, with the story arc covered this time around. They are leaving it open for more down the line.
Blasted through ULTRAMAN Season 2. Enjoyed it, but was left wanting a bit more after realising *it's only 6 episodes long*
... so basically, when Clone Wars is about its own title
the sort of feeling that The LEGO Movie was going for, really
The studio behind it take a lot of inspiration from tokusatsu, from what I hear.
And agreed, this is anime of anime, if the presence of the Urobutcher, Hiroyuki Sawano and a Takanori Nishikawa opening didn't tip you off
My internet youth, more or less
Fair, fair. I might need a rewatch myself, eventually
Glad this was confirmed relatively quickly, haha. I got thrown the hell off when the sixth episode of Season 2 ended
Even then, movies pls
I would only do this to myself over a few years and not subject myself to binging it, dear god
The series was always about "the little people" according to Yasuhiko Yoshikazu, so all in all I don't think it was ever going to cover the full extent of the One Year War all on its own
The manga Dark Yugi would probably find a dangerous way to take advantage of the drugs against others, I reckon.
Ah yeah, 3DCG anime for the accompanying gacha. You'll probably find even more names you recognise
Mmm. Still a lengthy binge since it was still the era of 52-episode anime
I have been trying to resist a specific joke I wanted to make about the sheer amount of spoiler tags I see here every time
this tweet, which shows off Figure-rise Standard ULTRAMAN SUIT TARO, references the fact that one of the duo (Eiichi Shimizu) originally wanted the Ultraman form of Taro in the ULTRAMAN manga to just be the flaming man (referencing the original Taro's Ultra Dynamite), rather than suited up as the other Ultramen are
https://twitter.com/nadegata_circus/status/1516046780990779393?s=20&t=mJ_nvpbBvbsEuTaGtljRSw LMAO
which reminds me of that set of NieR:Automata figures which are absolutely insane
Does any other anime have something like this? A non-conventional order to read or watch a series in that isn't just release or continuity order, I mean
However... it did remind me of one thing, and that's something whose name I forget that was a specific way to watch Star Wars
This threw me off with how out of touch I am with anime, for the most part
So <@219228299115757588> posted this in <#336310266654490624> earlier... https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/336310266654490624/967901300199161906/unknown.png

This is probably more of a discussion for <#447132690349555712>, of course, but what even is nao up to these days?
I only really knew said eras existed cause I had found out about the vocalists at the time I got into Tokyo Mirage Sessions #FE and Neptunia, due to the involvement of Yoshino Nanjo and nao in those respective games
Go figure... I didn't have a fripSide childhood so I can't say I have much of an opinion on any of the eras
Tomohiro Shimoguchi, the publishers, the editor and Tsuburaya Productions thought otherwise, and a suit was created. Reportedly, after seeing the suit, Shimizu admitted they had a point.
Oh, speaking of, apparently the RX-93ff Nu Gundam officially opened not too long ago
say, Toru Furuya's Amuro Ray or Shuichi Ikeda's Char Aznable
Since I have been watching the Japanese audio track for a long while it's hard for me to go back on it, especially after hearing it in other Gundam media
I have never heard the dub of First Gundam myself. All I know is that some if not many of the voices change with either the movie version or sequel series Zeta Gundam
Seems this post goes into a ton of the details we do and don't know about the episode
https://www.reddit.com/r/HobbyDrama/comments/rmr8z3/gundam_mobile_suit_gundam_0079_the_infamous/
Also, it seems that the true reason Cucuruz Doan's Island was skipped was never truly stated
Well I can tell you I was not referring to the OYW itself with that sentence, heh
I posted the MV for it in <#447132690349555712> which is 6 hours fresh
the Gundam Goddess has many amazing songs under her belt, that's for sure.
and I'll be getting the LE for Ubugoe as well after seeing that it's a thing
I'm well aware, I bought all three of her GUNDAM SONG COVERS Limited Editions, haha
HIROKO MORIGUCHI THEME SOMG YAAAAAAAS
That's probably because most releases exclude it! It's famous for a lot of reasons, including its off model animation, its relative pointlessness to the overarching plot, and how word of mouth spreads about it to the point where sometimes Doan's Zaku II is playable as its own unit... sometimes with G Gundam's Hyper Mode added in!
Heads with two sensors resembling eyes, though not all of then are Gundams surprisingly
Monoeyes, which typically go to the big enemy faction
Visor/GM style sensors, which cover the whole face more or less
In general, I feel there are three distinct head types within Gundam
Some say the same about Gundam-types, heh
Think this one was Kanetake Ebikawa, same guy who des-WHAT IS THAT
the above is the EB-06 Graze, from G-Tekketsu (Mobile Suit Gundam IRON-BLOODED ORPHANS)
For whatever reason the big enemy faction will almost always have a monoeye in Gundam
While still keeping certain identifiers within them
I'm more appreciative of designs which go more original
https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/gundam/images/c/c3/Graze_HQ_front_lineart.png/revision/latest?cb=20160612023353
I'm no Zaku enthusiast, but man does CE butcher it for no good reason
UC Zakus are definitely better by design, IMO
For whatever reason, ZAFT decided to rip Zeon wholesale in C.E.73
Gundam SEED Destiny and Kunio Okawara's self plagiarism is why the only design I can stand in the Cosmic Era is Astray, and anything Kira pilots
I sorely wish they didn't just start to rip off UC
WORD.
Didn't realise the English dub had a different pronunciation for this one, haha
wait, never mind, it's right there on the page, CRAP
Actually, try guessing how this is pronounced https://gundam.fandom.com/wiki/ZGMF-600_GuAIZ
it, and its many future variants
And considering it's the big, mass production model for the Feddies, I guess it makes sense
but idk man
It's probably hard to pronounce "Gee-emm" for Japanese speakers
For example, GN-X = Jinx
you'll see that in some other timelines, too
GENE, GEEEEENE
Oh, you mean the all caps, pfff
Well, that is the official abbreviation, so that's just what I'll use, lol
I know that it's in GUNEVO as the resident sniper unit/Widowmaker
Ah yeah, GM Sniper II is a very popular GM variation for sure
Oh, GM Sniper?
https://tenor.com/view/kamille-bidan-z-gundam-zeta-gundam-kamille-bidan-thumbs-up-gif-15033412
Or what else even appeared in it?
Alex? Or Zaku F2?
Oh wow, looked it up, he's Bernard Wiseman in the dub for 0080
Wait, David Hayter?
0080 has time on its side, so I would imagine it would go better, haha
that's apparently when Moriguchi first performed Ubugoe, cause Fukuoka is her hometown
For the record, END, this is the thing that stands in life size, 1/1 scale at Fukuoka
Can't be helped, I don't think they want the Fin Funnels to become a safety hazard, lmao
PALE RIDERRRR
https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/gundam/images/b/b9/RX-93ff_%CE%BD_Gundam_Front_CG.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20220314031840
For the most part, it is the Nu Gundam, but with one important difference
True. And earlier I also mentioned the RX-93ff, which was actually more a consequence of balance issues
To clarify what I mean: 02 is the model name in Gundam THE ORIGIN, the F00 is the Moving Gundam at GUNDAM FACTORY YOKOHAMA, and the Industrial Design Ver. is also known as the G40, and was a special model kit
I was gonna say, all that I listed was alternate versions of the original, and NOT the MSV variations that came before or after it
All of these are alternate versions of the original, in different media and models
Does any of that make a lick of sense to you?
RX-78-2, RX-78-02, RX-78F00, RX-78-2 (Industrial Design Ver.)
The original Gundam is known by many names at this point
Well, what I mean by this is, like
And how some of them are separate entities for reasons
Things get really weird when you start realising how many versions of the RX-78 exist
I think the funny thing is that the upcoming film will be using Gundam the Origin's character and mecha designs
The original story of Gundam The Origin retells and expands on UC prior to and during the One Year War
Origin is certainly in a weird position in this regard, haha
apparently animation is canon, anything else isn't
Sunrise had a weird stance, actually
Ah, I see.
Trying to do chronological, huh?
I'm aiming to try and buy the kit of this thing for myself, on that note, but it's a bit hard to get it
Yeah, Unicorn is its own beast... lmao
I'll leave that out of context beyond "they milk this thing a lot"
also, this is the Unicorn... albeit a special version
https://tenor.com/view/unicorn-gundam-gundam-transformation-perfectibility-gif-20556971
Well, be glad it's getting a big dang movie, haha
The definition of "Gundam" changes depending on the timeline, and sometimes series, as far as I know
Mmm, though said mass production happens to be a Gundam cause that's how far UC has come at that point
Hexa was a commander unit, wasn't it?
Ah, right, Hexa. I have not seen Victory Gundam myself so I forgot
V-Dash, right?
A side effect of the kabuto motif
Ah yeah, from the series which used national stereotypes to design all their Gundams, lmao
Yep. It's no wonder Musha Gundam exists
That being said, it's always a curious thing to realise why the the original Gundam was designed the way it was
TBH, I don't like taking sides in the mobile suit head design department. I just like what I like
Except the one time he made a Gundam blush, maybe
Righto. Sounds intriguing
Wait, Obari designed a Huckbein/Exbein?
so it has a massive V overlaid on the XXX
Sadly I can't find a GIF of him from that time, the one I got was from Gokaiger which was Super Sentai's 35th
similar to Huckbein 30's head design
Whenever AkaRed appears, he always has a belt reflecting the anniversary year of Super Sentai. He appeared during the 30th with a belt that had the roman numeral XXX on it
https://tenor.com/view/aka-red-gokai-red-kaizoku-sentai-gokaiger-gokaiger-super-sentai-gif-21136466
Funny thing about Huckbein 30 is that all I could see with it was goddamn AkaRed
that is, the Temjin series from Virtual-On
Now I'm just being reminded of the fact that Katoki also designed another not!Gundam that was more functionally similar than visually similar
OH, RIGHT, IT DID HAVE THE BLADE ANTENNA
lmao
I only really understand it in the sense of "Oh, that is kind of a Gundam head" but not much else
I know Sotsu wasn't fully owned by em until then, though
or was it 2020? I don't remember exactly
Well, Gundam wasn't, not fully, until March last year
And now it's basically no issue at all now that all of it is under the same umbrella of BANDAI NAMCO Holdings
Yeah, it may have been just speculation, I don't really know anything myself
cause it was basically Katoki making a Gundam outside of Gundam
It reminded me just then that Banpresto once got sued for Huckbein
Actually, while I'm sitting here thinking about it... You know how we talked about the distinguishing elements of mobile suit faces?
Oh, garage kit. Different scale huh?
Is that the old or the new S Gundam kit?
Dear god, what the heck
It's a huge unit, after all
DEEP STRIKER, dear god.
The MG kit for this thing is massive!
Enjoyable talk, but I gotta go. Gonna spend some time at the mall now
~~No, the S in S Gundam does not stand for Sentinel like the series it comes from~~
Superior Gundam, or S Gundam for short. Very much a distinctive design
And the pilot needed the heck out of it because reportedly he was utter shite
ALICE?
https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/gundam/images/c/c1/Ms-08txexam.jpg/revision/latest
Speaking of The Blue Destiny, Efreet Custom remains one of my favourite monoeyes in the franchise
I was gonna say, yeah, EXAM tortures a captive Newtype soul, lol
EXAM System for Blue Destiny, then HADES for Pale Rider and Todestritter
(Fei-Yen HD in Super Robot Wars UX)
Wouldn't be the first time she's played her own Vocaloid, she once did so *as a Virtuaroid* in a 3DS instalment of Super Robot Wars
Fairly sure it's Saki Fujita with modulation, yeah
This is how you know they're serious when they cast the actual voice provider in the role, heh
Random civilians who *all happen to be Vocaloids what is this*
I expected someone to mention a Sforzando for whatever reason <:CarolYandere:424047704826707980>
sadge that I can't play any anime games over there
Alright... Off to the arcade, I think
I can see that, haha
References to that line (One! Next...) appear pretty regularly in things like game appearances
A bonus for TV version viewers: Amuro with the full destruction count
Movie version removes him counting up for every successful kill, IIRC
Truth be told I don't know what exactly that Obari did for G-Tekketsu, all I know is that he was involved with the series cause I saw a bunch of tweets from him that were sent during the 5th anniversary of the series
Damn if he doesn't make it look super fierce, though.
cause I can tell you, Barbatos is not his design
Or animation work, I think
The 0 Raiser. God I love Ebikawa mecha design
This, combined with Hiroko Moriguchi's joy at performing the theme song even though she's in her 50's now, are why I'm dead set at seeing the film
and Toru Furuya has mentioned that it may very well also be the last time he voices a 15 year old Amuro Ray
I may need to do a rewatch before Cucuruz Doan's Island drops, as it'll be Yasuhiko Yoshikazu's last ever work in Gundam and possibly of his career
God, this talk is reminding me of how long it has been since I last watched First Gundam
I meant in the sense of ||Amuro opening up the Gundam cockpit to take Sleggar in, assuming the pressure of space's vacuum hasn't already rendered him dead||
So you don't have an awkward TANK IN SPACE
Also, Guntank is replaced with a second Guncannon, right?
Yep. One of the things considered too Super Robot-like for Tomino and co
I'd have to rewatch this to know for sure what happened, but even still, ||I feel like opening the cockpit even for a moment would be tricky for a rescue||
Yeah, I am aware, haha. Still, I guess I'm that deep into Gundam to want to always prioritise the movies instead, cause that's what most future UC works do
||Which would probably make him vulnerable to attack, IMO||
Granted, I know your reasons and you're approaching the end, so it's a moot point to try and stop you now, lol
That's why I told you to watch the movies, lmao
This makes a lot more sense in the movie compilation, actually, cause ||Sleggar rams the Core Booster straight into it instead, killing him in the explosion of his craft||
||Moreover, does anyone want to be approaching the goddamn Big Zam to rescue one dude?||
I mean, ||when you're thrown out into the vacuum of space, you don't have much of a chance||
Dynasty Warriors: Gundam is one of the only times you will ever hear characters from Turn A Gundam dubbed
Not a lot of Gundam games receive an English dub, on that note...
Really is nothing like hearing a 15 year old Amuro say "Hitotsu! Tsugi..." in various games
Probably because you associated it more with comedy than space brains
In the movies, that flash is audible, using that sound
where Amuro has a white flash across his face
You would have seen it at the Battle of Side 6
the "Newtype flash" as some people call it
basically, due to further integration of the Newtype plot point, they added in this sound effect as they started to manifest late in the series
https://youtu.be/KlRxAIYy-WU
So about that lie I mentioned
It was the last work that featured the original voice of Sayla Mass, IIRC
Japanese audio track for a specific DVD release
Oh, also I'm slightly lying with the original audio
Yes and no. No because the original is more or less the same sound design as the 1979 TV broadcast, yes because there is an audio track from a 2000's era redub which also redid the sound design to be a LOT more modern sci-fi
That, and the fact that when these sounds are reused in later series, they remain familiar and consistent even with different timelines
Mmm. In the end, though, for me it's still gotta be the sub. That's what completes the experience for me, personally
The dubs would have the benefit of time, and maybe a less antiquated sound library to pull from
I mean, they were made in the late 1970's
https://youtu.be/kDQbu32cx1A
It's hard to not want to hear the iconic Beam Rifle sound effects and the like
sadly this also seems to affect the sound design
Oh, that is so deliciously Western, lmao
There really is an air about music like this which you can't really get if it were replaced, IMO
https://open.spotify.com/track/5kyACRekxmzoyLRUJnfNCg?si=faCTnrWHTrO5sibVLkuVrQ&utm_source=copy-link
I don't really know if I could accept music that isn't the OG, haha
Cause man do I have a soft spot for the old theme
I just want to ensure we get the full soundtrack to this in due time
Personally... https://youtu.be/1QcjvlpEeZw
and some of the original recordings were lost
Reportedly, not all the music was sent to the dub studio
Oh, huh, apparently there was an explanation for it
I see, I see.
Do you know if there's a clip of it? I'd be able to verify if it was dub only, if only so far as being completely unrecognisable to my ears compared to the OG score
Welp. It wasn't that 1979 original score?
so I imagine whoever would actually seriously do this would prepare first and foremost for that
But if you wanted to do that, you'd need the space, too
Really, the only big issue is if you want to display all of them with the same Core Gundam variation
Besides, Core Gundam II uses no less than 6 different armors itself
That doesn't matter all that much when the whole idea behind the Core Change gimmick allows you to combine anything you want
since they released standalone versions of the Core Gundam II in G-3 and Titans Colours
In a sense, anyway
Well, lucky for you, they got you covered
It's just what came with the Veetwo unit and was seen on the promotional shots
You don't specifically need the G-3 Colours for Veetwo.
I mean, what would you rather? That you keep rebuilding the Core Gundam over and over?
Long story short is ||I'm glad he went kaboom in the movie||
a bit counterintuitive to grab a human with an 18-metre mecha
Pffff
I dunno if Amuro could've grabbed him on time (and safely)
The reason for the Core Gundam's small size is actually revealed later in the series it appears in, but until the series is rotated back in, I won't bother with further details
and you can pin this mostly on the fact that Kanetake Ebikawa was responsible for this and the Asuno family Gundam
basically most of the fandom thought it was actually a Gundam AGE based machine, when in reality its base machine was the RX-78-2
Fun fact, even Toru Furuya was confused at the appearance of the Core Gundam
PFF-X7/E3 Earthree Gundam, for example, which is the configuration which also most resembles the OG Gundam the Core Gundam is based on
The concept behind this gimmick is basically, it can equip armor and weapons suited to any situation http://gundam-bd.net/mecha/02/pct_01.png
This image does not demonstrate it well, but this thing is SMALL
PFF-X7 Core Gundam
You've met the Core Fighter, now prepare to meet http://gundam-bd.net/mecha/01/pct_01.png
It is associated with the RX-78 in various ways, still. RX-78-1 Prototype Gundam seemed to use it in some games where the RX-78-2 doesn't
so for most of its appearances, it's video games
most source books seem to not mention it, and no other episode in the original series uses it
Gundam Fandom wiki points out, it's the most obscure weapon in the original Gundam's arsenal
Not sure... Hold on a sec
Yeeeeep, cause for that ult, that Core Fighter's fate - no matter if it's shot down or if it detonates - is to explode
Seriously, first time I saw that in the game's very first stream, I was like ||RYU NOOOOOOOO||
By the way, now you are aware of why its G-Maneuver in GUNEVO is what it is, right? <:Ver:704169051391524875>
It seems a bit ridiculous that they took a tank up into space, don't you think?

Nahhhh it'll be fine
Ah yeah, lmao
means they don't need to dupe their uploads for different languages
GBF Battlogue was actually the first series, IIRC, where GundamInfo used YouTube CC
All the Gundam Build Fighters uploads, with the exception of GBF Battlogue, all had hardsubs
The only notable exception is old Gundam Build series, at least one seriss of which will tend to remain on rotation for a long time
so basically anything you see on that channel is now up to the same standard
Luckily they fixed that not too long ago for that series, too
And even more recent series still had hardcoded subs, like G-Tekketsu
but it meant that for a good while, several shows would be noticeably lower in quality when rotated back in, like the original 00 upload
All the shows since 2017 use YouTube closed captions, rather than hardcoded subtitles on the video itself
https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLJV1h9xQ7Hx-K0KBk_LIQTodLCownpf8F
No more using the 360p uploads from 2012
IT IS A BRAND NEW UPLOAD
In fact, they rotated in Gundam 00 recently, and not just that
Yeah, they do
Just my luck... I was also gonna bring up one of the sounds I think is most satisfying from a recent Gundam show, and it's off the rotation for GundamInfo
The problem is that I can't really find a clip of where the sound plays in Gundam on YouTube, and I know the other clip I could get is literal endgame from Gundam Unicorn
I'm positive the sound is exactly the same between both of them.
We're gonna have to agree to disagree on this.
To which I reply: The only difference was the speed of the sound
https://youtu.be/FeRe9kiuf-0
It's just harder to tell with the background audio
It is DEFINITELY not a single sound...
Think it's longer, actually. Seems like it was slowed down by a tad.
basically, the sound is associated with heightened perception and awareness
https://youtu.be/WRWdaiYBS6o It's also used in DBZ
The Lacus Clyne ZAKU Warrior, yeah
Though... Why do you keep calling it Blaze? That's a specific Wizard Pack, isn't it?
The special site for MG 1/100 Wing Gundam Zero EW Ver.Ka shows the vast difference between it and the 2009 MG
the most obvious example being Wing Zero EW
Yeah, but MG has had a lot longer to develop, and if you go back there are still some stinkers compared to today's
and why older ones... aren't
this is why recent RGs are super good
That can also cause issues if the underlying frame turns out to not be so great in quality
Which shouldn't be surprising considering MG is harder to develop
I see, I see.
Gundam Fence? https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/gundam/images/7/74/Zabanya_Centered.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20100411201003
Don't. It was just an initiative that began the trend.
and Deathscythe Hell runners were spotted in Livelance Heaven
But it still does happen - Shenlong Gundam is at long last happening, for example
It doesn't happen as often these days because many of the MS that Gundam Build Series mecha are based on have kits in their own lines, or in HGUC
all those were born from what they were doing with GBF
HGAC Wing Gundam, HGCE Aile Strike Gubdam, HGAW Gundam X
it was tied to the "All Gundam Project" which began that same year
That is mostly because new HG kits for several machines in GBF didb't exist yet
GP Rase-Two-Ten being based on like, number 020-something of now over 200 HGUC releases
That's mostly the fault of being based on a HGUC that is much older than most others
Heh, I'm a fan of a bunch of them
Oh, people have for sure
From an economical standpoint, it's probably for the best that it doesn't come with the extra plastic for most people
Exactly my point.
To be fair, I think you're genuinely the first person who has pointed this out to me. Think I simply got used to the habit
to be honest, I still don't understand what <MODv> is supposed to indicate
With that being said, I don't blame anyone for getting confused with these sorts of titles
My bad.
I forgot about it, and then quickly searched it up
the stuff for Project [emU] is different
The track on the remix & rearrange soundtrack was *Inferno<MODv>*
That doesn't sound quite right
Wait, there was a remix album for PROMARE?
A social distancing rearrangement of Inferno, with the title indicating that it's actually a mashup of it and PROMARETHEME
This is an *amazing* rendition of the theme, done as part of Project„ÄêemU„Äë, a soundtrack revival project
https://youtu.be/c49zedQ1eNM THIS
Well, hold on a second, I got something related to that
PROMARETHEME?
Song titles in this score are like trying to read Kirika's attack cards
Honest to goodness request for you guys who have seen KILL la KILL, look up the original or complete soundtrack - they're both on Spotify, too
That I do know, I've listened to *Inferno* god knows how many times thanks to it being on one of his compilation albums
It reminds me, I want to see if I can find some of his earlier work, things like his earlier work on things like dramas
People started paying more attention to him in general after that series, for the reasons I had already mentioned above
considering my primary experience with his work has been in Gundam
Honestly, I had to keep constantly reminding myself that an animation with that specific kind of lightning pace and typically limited animation that's signature to a Trigger series had a *Hiroyuki Sawano score*
I see, I see.
Ah yes... I know that PSG's been talked about a lot, heh
bless that end-of-episode TOPDAD narration
It had been a while since I watched a Trigger anime... I forgot just how *lightning paced* they make their stuff
and yet it's got a goddamn *TeddyLoid ED* and a *really* catchy OP
... and every episode lasts no longer than 5 minutes each
An anniversary anime paying homage to their 5 year history ||that is also secretly the origin of one of their mascots, Trigger-chan||, go figure
I admit, though, I may have missed a thing or two because I was also grinding out Skywalker Saga while watching, lmao
And now the Space Patrol Luluco tribute episode focusing on it will make much more sense to me
add on an OP by those two? *Damn*
I already knew that Hiroyuki Sawano was in it, and coming off of *Attack on Titan* made it a lethal combination that skyrocketed his presence in the overseas world of anison, but
... and I also did not realise that there was both Eir Aoi and GARNiDELiA for OPs and EDs
Gotta say, I'm glad I finally did it
So I binged KILL LA KILL for the first time over two days
SAZABI ALSO HAS A LONGBOI FUNNEL
OH GOD
https://www.gundamkitscollection.com/2022/04/rx-93ff-nu-gundam-fights-sazabi-in-new.html
So if you plan to see the Moving Gundam, keep this in mind
From May 9 to July 15, a long-term maintenance will be performed at GUNDAM FACTORY YOKOHAMA, during which time the facility will be unavailable to visitors
Oh? https://twitter.com/gfy_official_/status/1510059445203582976?s=20&t=w9rUnMqxqeBcvW_5ttXtVA
By the end I was sort-of trying to look for it
and while it never happens as frequently in a single episode as it does in that one ever again, it still happens in many places in the series
especially when ||that was basically all that happened whenever Ryuko showed up to gatecrash the raid trip in the pursuit of Senketsu's pieces||
I got one more random thing to add about my KILL la KILL watch: I was starting to lose it a bit with the amount of times I'd hear this interrupt whatever music was on previously https://open.spotify.com/track/0wYHmiuHT2cLFJD3TI1LR0?si=503de161ae2245f9
Fandom is showing me images that suggest there *are* character designs from somewhere that's not G-Gen
Wait a second... https://gundam.fandom.com/wiki/Ryou_Roots
Yeah, he's about the only Sentinel character that actually has a design at all
Gundam Sentinel itself was a photo novel, wasn't it? So there isn't much visual representation of the characters in general
I wonder how many stickers have been on the side of that same piano, on that note... There's a Vist Foundation sticker in that suite, and a Mafty sticker in the M√∂bius video.
That being said, I'll cut myself off here - I can wonder that another day when I actually see another sticker that isn't just a Gundam related one
That being said, I'm no sound engineer, so I'm not sure how all that is actually supposed to work or if I'm right in my guess
The only thing I have to say about the Gundam Unicorn suite is that it seems like they had the sound equipment to record the instruments directly, there's wires going into every single instrument present - including Sawano's signature Yamaha grand piano
... very clearly modelled after *that* Alice
Indeed. If you watch the video the guy explains he modelled it himself
It certainly isn't the original recordings, that's for sure. And, yeah, it's pretty clearly not done in a single take
<@99695384296701952> I forgot about this! One of the engineers in the first episode 3D modelled ALICE to go with the S Gundam
So yeah, if anyone is interested in the journey of making the Gundam move (which, yes, also ends up going through the pandemic in the middle of it), start there
Oh, wait, never mind! They simply put subtitles on the GUNDAM CHANNEL upload and privated the GundamInfo upload! https://gundam-challenge.com/en/making/vol1.html
Gah, sadly I don't think the documentary series which details the construction of the Moving Gundam is up on the GundamInfo channel anymore
I probably still won't get to see it in person, sadly, but I'm happy for those who may yet get that chance
they gave us an extra year of the Moving Gundam, which is now set to close in March 2023
That's why it came as a huge surprise that it would not be closing down when they planned to, which was March 2022
Mmm, but keeping it open and active would probably cost a ton in maintenance
Which brings me to the other reason I wanted to make sure I had a physical copy available to watch at any time: Should the video ever disappear from the channel
I'd hope so, considering it's an 18m towering thing, heh
THE LAND IS CLOAKED IN DEEPEST BLUE
*And* get good drone shots
You've got *stupid* amounts of the biggest motors in Japan fitted into an 18 metre statue, and the lighting around it, and you have to coordinate those movements *with the orchestra*
To coordinate something like this... I think my brain would be fried just thinking about it for *one* song, but for a whole suite?
you can see the chaos of the setup at GFY, the musicians and vocalists everywhere (one of which, mizuki, actually takes the place of Mika Kobayashi in this suite for *EGO*)
Ah, it is on YouTube https://youtu.be/-1Ja_BEx4X0
There's also a behind the scenes video of this suite. I forget if it's on YouTube or not, it's definitely on the Hathaway Limited Edition BD though
I don't know if I've ever properly heard what it sounds like when the giant motors are moving, but regardless of how easy or hard it would have been to capture the performance unhindered, it's one hell of a setup
Filmed at GUNDAM FACTORY YOKOHAMA, in front of the RX-78F00 Gundam
The thing I love most about this suite is the cinematography. I don't think Project [emU] has ever had such a grandiose stage before or after this one
In fact, I was so desperate to make sure I had a version I could pop in and watch whenever I wanted that I preordered the Mobile Suit Gundam Hathaway BD as soon as I could (this suite is featured as one of the bonus contents)
My personal suite from Project [emU], naturally, is this one https://youtu.be/ir_PRErPnb0
All I remember about it is that Aoi Yuki's a giant in this one
I've never seen a minute of this anime myself, but here's one of the prime things that Project [emU] brings: Newly recorded suites of his works
Speaking of Project [emU]... Seems something new for it dropped a month ago https://youtu.be/Um1AoPM5LpE
Ah yeah, the whole "Newtype conversation" thing
And yet, the fandom cheers for them anyway because they're the underdogs.
They kinda always had that about em, being written basically as space Nazis from the get-go
Years later in a self parody series, her daughter Megumi Han would also take on the role
In Japan, she was voiced by Keiko Han
I always liked her cause of the legacy of her character behind the scenes
Ah yes... You have now met Lalah Sune at this point, haven't you
Ah yes, good ol' Akira Yasuda
The deep intricacies of Real Robot shows, huh
https://tenor.com/bmlFq.gif
little did I realise there was actually new things in the works (Z of the Recapture, specifically)
since, well, I had wanted to do so for a while
I went through the Code Geass compilation movies (as much as some would cringe at me saying and doing so) and Re;surrection a while back
for those wondering why that was my first thought, it's the most recent thing I had binged that featured him
Dangit, there's only one Charles zi Britannia GIF on Tenor
Oh, Wakamoto, huh?
Granted, it's Splash Mountain and not a rollercoaster...

Fittingly enough, Mikoto's given Raiden, since both of 'em have the ability to fire huge blasts of lightning forward
I think there were even comments from Hajime Katoki regarding this design
For those who aren't a fan of it, apparently there was also the option to play with its original counterpart from OT, BAL-Bados
BAL-RlooN, an Index-flavoured version of the BAL series Virtuaroids
The game version of the crossover also had *this* happen https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/to-aru-majutsu-no-index/images/e/e9/Index_%26_%22BAL-RlooN%22_%28Virtual-On_game%29.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20170825124736
My guess is that the author is also privy to that choice and its popularity
it's faster, more refined and with more mechanics than Operation Moongate (the original Cyber Troopers Virtual-On), and lacked the things that slowed all that gameplay down in Virtual-On FORCE
So why Oratorio Tangram? Easy - it's the most popular version of the series, and also the one players find the most competitive
Ah, apparently the novel was what was done first, and it commemorated Virtual-On's 20th anniversary in 2016
and it really showed in his choice of Virtuaroids for the games, because they were all from Oratorio Tangram
literally I think the author only did it cause it and Index were both celebrating anniversaries, or was it just Virtual-On? Either way, apparently he was a big fan of those games
but I don't remember much about it, neither the novel or its game adaptation
to be fair, I think that it actually ended in a time reset
all I know/remember about it is seeing it get *rekt* by Virtuaroids in the opening movie of *A Certain Magical Virtual-On*
which is why I'm pointing that one out since I do recognise it (edit: for those who don't get it, it's ||TOWER RECORDS|| in Shibuya
lmao ||Dungeon Records||
the early days of that
I think the amusing thing is that this fansub didn't catch "Hello, every*nyan*"
Ah yes, this. Basically patron saint of perfectly cut screams
... I dunno why I chose *this* GIF but
Of course, nobody should forget his arguably most famous role
More like, giant fucking flower in space
that looks like what happens at the end of Gundam 00 the Movie
It would look awfully strange, no?
Imagine someone looking behind them and seeing that motion
Gundam BGM? Fair enough to you there
you have things like Yugo Kanno, Yuki Hayashi, Hiroyuki Sawano and Kenji Kawai in more recent works
To be fair, compared to your usual Gundam fare, it can be a bit jarring
A bit of an acquired taste, for sure.
Or blues, if you're on Daryl's end
All I know about it? Freestyle jazz.
I admit, I have not yet fully seen December Sky and Bandit Flower myself
same with the fact that Gundam Wing changed its signature Gundams from one designer to another
The legacy of the original series and the differences between them is usually referenced in media outside the actual shows
to allow for creative freedoms like the differences between units named the same as another in the prime UC
Apparently it's some *alternate Universal Century*
Ah, Thunderbolt. That one is a very weird one in general for continuity
What were you watching?
after Graham Aker and Ricardo Fellini
The only other thing I could remember of Thunderbolt is that it is Yuichi Nakamura's third Gundam role
My point is, compared to a lot of those, Thunderbolt's BGM kinda screams at you that it's a whole different beast
Since I have never seen Gundam the Origin in its entirety, nor Advent of the Red Comet, I could not give you a solid answer for that series
I'm not sure on that, to be honest. Only the Thunderbolt movies have I heard with extra footage over its OVA counterpart for the more recent Gundam movie works
SUGIZO in particular got really heavily involved in Gundam around this time, where he spearheaded the 40th Anniversary album, and had his fellow LUNA SEA members band together for the theme song of said anniversary
https://youtu.be/GKnlf9ko-Gg
The only reason I would recommend watching that, personally? It has an *amazing* theme song by LUNA SEA
That version is Mobile Suit Gundam THE ORIGIN: Advent of the Red Comet
or 12, I don't recall exactly what
and the TV re-cut redistributes that into 13 episodes, IIRC
The original is six OVAs
For Mobile Suit Gundam THE ORIGIN, there are similarly two ways to watch that
though if nothing else, it gave us an AMAZING opening for Episode 18 of RE:0096
Some people are not exactly fans of how series are chopped up when OVAs are re-edited as TV episodes
and that is, a lot of UC these days are movies and feature length OVAs rather than TV series
There is a bit of an issue I find with that, though I admit it is based on the reception I have heard of Mobile Suit Gundam Unicorn RE:0096
Mobile Suit Gundam 0083 REBELLION
... and if you want, there is also a manga version
and the other is the movie compilation, called *Mobile Suit Gundam 0083: The Afterglow of Zeon*
One is the original, three part OVA release, *Mobile Suit Gundam 0083: Stardust Memory*
Plus, there are two versions of 0083 to watch
Depends on whether or not you wanna see a young Casval and Artesia suffer, or see Macross designed Gundams fire a nuke
It eventually grows up and becomes more serious, but it is difficult to reach that point without cringing hard
so it's a lot sillier in its first half
It's a hard watch on the first half, partially thanks to someone (think it was Tomino?) wanting to basically cleanse their palate after Zeta's ending
Or do you think the six part split will be enough of a breaker between instalments?
You sure? Origin OVA is the six parter while TV is the 13 parter
I think The Afterglow of Zeon has a bit of extra over its OVA counterpart?
THE EUROBEAT IS BACK
And now for something completely different. https://youtu.be/Xq_H1KEeObE
Not surprising when I know a few... interesting NSFW credits for certain voice actors, and a certain animator
Seems Alain's Charizard is retaining its Charizardite X
Mega Evolution vs. Gigantamax, maybe.
But idk, man
Maybe cause of Iris, who herself has a Dragonite. A very angry one.
Chances are if they did, it would be Premium Bandai
... dear god, though, I really hope I'm not confusing them for Digital Frontier, lmao
I guess that's why I don't see that many *Love Live!* specific credits on Anima's end
Wait, every single one? Huh.
https://tenor.com/bMMOH.gif
the studio that did Three Houses' cutscenes?
... and yes, uh
and suddenly the way the 3DCG cutscenes of *Tokyo Mirage Sessions #FE* looked made total sense to me
Searching them up led me to find out about their involvement with *Love Live!*
Who, amongst other things, have been responsible for making much of the 3DCG cutscenes for Fire Emblem since Fire Emblem Awakening (edit: with the exception of FE17/Three Houses, as I just found out, which was handled by Sanzigen Inc.)
If I remember correctly, that's all done by ANIMA Inc.
You know what I found funny about *Love Live!* and its CG?
and how its character design is super thirsty to the point where I really, really question what counts as a "pilot suit" in that universe
Of all things, this is reminding me of the small discussion I had a little while back about Super Robot Wars Cross Omega
Character differences between adaptations, huh...
https://tenor.com/view/who-gif-22556712
Basically, it's why 70% of my anime consumption over the last five years was nothing but Gundam
A general disinterest at being part of the greater anime community and preference for sticking to communities like this, and prioritising the gaming world over anime for the most part when it comes to upcoming works
In any case... I apologise for going all ramble mode about this, though I guess this does help to explain why I never really catch up with seasonal anime beyond a few things
So rather than engage in that sort of thing, I avoid those places entirely as a form of preventative measure. Better to not cross their path, basically.
cause the stress of it all would absolutely overwhelm me
and not on places like, say, Reddit or Twitter
so I prefer being called out for my trash taste in anime and games in communities like this
See, while this may not apply to everyone, for me it may be a bit difficult to back down from a fight if I go in too deep
But get the mob involved, and it'll just be too much for me, personally
Cause at least in the case of individuals, I can stomach the blow, or have a think about what they say
I mean, would you rather have individual peeps do that, or deal with crusaders that have an agenda?
It's the difference between an engaging conversation and the crowd whaling on you for going against the trend
But at least they'll have a somewhat more meaningful discussion about it, lol
I would rather not deal with that crowd at all than try to enjoy myself in a community which will judge your anime tastes on completely trivial matters for an agenda
If anything this solidifies why I would prefer not to join sites like those
Stuff like that, I guess?
the AoT and your Kimetsu or your Boku no ~~Pico~~ Hero
if only because I hab important meeting to get to in 8 hours
And I would rather not do that at this time of day
Makes me kinda curious as to what is and isn't highly rated... But at the same time, it is a rabbit hole I know will have no end once I fall off the edge
... then again, I don't really know what the collective on places like MAL or AniList think of Symphogear, so don't take my word for it
Hivemind.

You can flip it around and realise that communities like this are the place where one can talk with the other side of the hivemind.
*Yeah, fair enough.*
Given that my only experience with *Love Live!* is basically Yoshino Nanjo, the fact that Mu's were all present in a particular NIS title credited as their *Love Live!* characters, and the fact that they share a studio with basically the grandfather of Real Robot shows...
the framerate of character movement, in particular
Which may explain a **lot** about the way it looks
where I just found out that the cutscenes of 3H are actually done by the same company that does that
Yeah, I got interrupted in between the message it was supposed to go with
Oh huh. https://twitter.com/nadegata_circus/status/1489935999459561472?s=20&t=r_P8mpJbQPwK9JGWcE84mQ
Seems they went to visit GUNDAM SIDE-F and the RX-93ff
Oh, speaking of... https://twitter.com/nadegata_circus/status/1523134974685106176?s=20&t=r_P8mpJbQPwK9JGWcE84mQ
I'm not really all that familiar with them myself, but I thought I'd ask because they've drawn some real interesting mechanical designs
Are any of you familiar wth Nadegata Circus? Just out of curiosity.
there's no plural in this title
Also, isn't it "DRAGON BALL SUPER: SUPER HERO"?
Because *this* exists
https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dragonball/images/1/1b/20161114_2b.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20161114152021
I feel like that would sound super generic, and more confusing
It's the branding... It can't be helped, I feel
I'll send this outta context.

Maybe she's using an outdated Windows OS
they're basically total opposites
It still kinda throws me off that Reigen shares a voice with Cloud Strife
and Mob Psycho 100 III is on the horizon, isn't it?
That does remind me... I've yet to see Mob Psycho 100 II
I hear "Mob" and I see this instead
https://tenor.com/bMfLg.gif
Oh
Mob?
see Super Saiyan God Super Saiyan
and, well, they're already used to redundancy
long story short Dragon Ball branding is stupid
Is that a TOSHIBE brand monitor
https://tenor.com/view/ressha-sentai-to-qger-roll-call-team-super-sentai-sentai-gif-21944863
lmao, apparently they're credited with "Publicity Co-operation" in *Evangelion 3.0+1.0: Thrice Upon A Time* thanks to the Shinkalion/Evangelion crossover
Takara Tomy have some wild anime franchises
I don't pay much attention to them, personally, because I just don't pay much attention to reception in general. Sometimes I do, but I guess that's only once I see something that actually piques my interest first and foremost.
You can't account for all the whims of the creators...
The issue I find with this perspective is that there are things that can and will drag media down in the middle of production, not just with its basic premise.
and it had chat going ||\*blank* IS THE SEVENTH|| repeatedly (and carrying it to other shows afterwards)
But I watched that show for the first time through that marathon
I don't know if any of you were around for the massive Crunchyroll anime marathon on Twitch, so long ago...
I give Rokka: Braves of the Six Flowers a confusing/10
... actually, maybe one
I don't know if I do, if I'm being honest
Do I even have a rating standard for anime...?
it's only fair to share it with the class
Now, now, everyone likes a little bit of sauce

Second OP for NO GUNS LIFE, featuring Jean-Ken Johnny of MAN WITH A MISSION
Actually, on the note of *CRY* (the NHK OP mentioned earlier)... I think at this point in time, I listen more to the other half of the single it released with https://open.spotify.com/track/0BkkNBgnKwn9fc1MFoGJKI?si=c4ee943af120452f
and I was excited as hell about it when it was first released
I only know the NHK version differed because it had a brand new OP
I'm certain that that's the version that will be in the TV broadcast in Japan
Maybe get stomped by Matador for real this time (i.e. actually take the L and get a game over rather than closing and resetting)
In either case, I'll be dropping in bed now. Have no idea what to do when I wake up...
There's never been anything like this before or after, has there?
Also only as long as the length of the album, more or less.
Well, I probably should have explained I was gawking at the coincidence of them calling it... *daft*
BRUH
On that note, I'd love to see the full thing. I've only ever seen pieces of it that were uploaded as official music videos on YouTube
Looking at some of the behind-the-scenes of the production, I'm not about to argue, heh
But fair point to you regardless
It's almost cheating in that regard cause that's basically just a studio album, haha
Ah yeah... Interstella 5555, was that the name? I don't fully recall.
Thinking about it, I'm not sure if Sawano with space war might be the most fitting, haha
I see. I've not seen any of those examples.
Oh? You've got me curious, that's for sure.
Then again, that may be the bias from my Gundam experience showing
cause I swear, his style fits best with those types of shows, IMO
I have to wonder if Sawano is basically just the quintessential space epic soundtrack for anime now
guess that might not be so for the overseas release
Basically, the theatrical format is how Japan's been doing it
https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2022-04-06/crunchyroll-streams-legend-of-the-galactic-heroes-die-neue-these-season-3-anime-english-dub/.184425 Ah... That might explain it.
https://youtu.be/Cr-4jXQ2uMw
As far as I'm aware, yes. The three films were March 4, April 1 and May 13, 2022, apparently
What I'm reading up right now is that the third part literally just came out in Japanese theatres yesterday
Oh, is it literally running *right now?*
TV broadcast might have something else
Apparently that's actually the ED, cause it's a three-part film series first, and will be a 12-episode TV series later
Above: OP1
Below: NHK Ver. OP
But lemme tell you, having songs like this are great motivation for me to pick it up again

I got it started... but haven't moved very far
get into some space opera that isn't just mecha anime
Oh, Die Neue These? I've been meaning to watch that myself
And have that cycle be repeated until the end of time?
How about being launched into the sun, and forced to resurrect inside the core because you're a phoenix, only to die immediately again afterwards?
I guess what I mean to ask is, what makes him the middle of the road in the chart?
Wonder why Kamille Bidan is 50/50...
Death flags are to happy families like moths to a flame
I feel like I have watched enough anime to sadly accept this truth
That's the three OVAs connected together, actually
Surprise, they decided to do *both*
Unicorn struggling to break out of its own cage, rather than making its slow, iconic walk upon launch
Especially comparing these short animated moments to what their eventual animations would be in the actual films
Exploring all this behind-the-scenes stuff is a real treat, with that PV above being the most interesting thing I've seen in the bonuses thus far, I'd say
I can only imagine... It's been, like, 13 years since Episode 1 released?
This thing was *always* supposed to be anime
And trying to search it up led me there... and to an interesting revelation about the story itself. https://twitter.com/TomAznable/status/1069844337360596992?s=20&t=4uE9MYGlKIbhRfaWmjBYqw
If any of you are wondering what warranted this seemingly random post, well, I opened up my copy of *MOBILE SUIT GUNDAM UNICORN Blu-ray BOX Complete Edition,* and this very PV (the full version of it) was included in the extras of Episode 7 originally.
https://twitter.com/TomAznable/status/1069843005010530304?s=20&t=4uE9MYGlKIbhRfaWmjBYqw This is **raw.**
What do you mean, exactly?
Behold, a Build concept which blends two things which never actually happened in the stories: Gundlander, and Gundam 00 side stories
https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/gundam/images/3/3e/Valkylander_Dragon_Fusion_%28Front%29.png/revision/latest?cb=20191031120628
A little thing called Valkylander
cause outside all of that, the last SD thing I heard of?
I'm honestly not sure what else SD Gundam is doing these days, beyond G Generation, the now defunct Online, and the upcoming Battle Alliance
If I were to guess, probably because of a highly successful Gunpla line, and the fact that Heroes was a direct sequel to Sangoku Soketsuden, IIRC
Or do you mean, like, the animated stuff that came later (Brave Battle Warriors, Sangoku Soketsuden/Heroes)?
The original stories that SD Gundam BB Senshi itself has, do you mean?
SD Gundam is a *lot* more than that
Which is my point. I really hate that it has that association...
SD Gundam Force, the exploration into full CG Gundam that seemingly everyone remembers for whatever reason instead of just the concept of SD Gundam (which annoys me a lot, honestly)
You've got the old, self-parody stuff (plus a Wacky Racers parody they keep erasing from the collections)
There's a lot of different SD Gundam stuff, so the mood could change depending on what you actually watch
Well they certainly ain't the giant robos of the main series, that's for sure
... but not really
Mmm. Though I feel like that may as well have been a case of "It's just SD Gundam" at that point
Which I think is funny cause one of the characters' motivations is finding out *why* it's not being used for greater stuff
Gundam Build Real's an oddity for sure. It's aimed at a different kind of audience compared to other Gundam Build series
Gonna be a painful wait for October 2022, on that note...
's fair, Build isn't for everyone
I feel like design cohesion wouldn't have worked, not for a series whose very motto is "Gunpla is freedom"
This makes G-Reco the only major series that hasn't been seen in a Build Series thus far, custom or otherwise
It took until Gundam Build Divers Battlogue before G-Tekketsu was on the table, and naturally, people voted Barbatos Lupus Rex in at number one, *by far,* to appear in the animation
it's been long speculated that this was the reason we couldn't get a proper Gundam Frame in Gundam Build Divers
Reading up about the whole bit about Amazing Exia actually being an Exia R2 and how network agreements would prevent it from appearing right up until literally *days* before its debut episode ended up making me realise that this more than likely applied to every Gundam Build Series
Ah, the Voiture Lumiere...
Ah yeah... Fair point. My b.
Yep, it was very specifically Amazing Exia/Exia Dark Matter that got the higher-ups upset
I *still* love the trivia of the higher-ups at Sotsu-Sunrise getting angry because of how closely the mechanical designers had come to violating TV network agreements
I'd say that a lot of the reason it wasn't remembered as much as Gundam Build Fighters is that it was a one-off celebrating a Gunpla anniversary, before the novel concept of a Gunpla world takeover was made into a series people could dig into every week for 25 weeks
So it's kinda hard to find the origins of some of the SD Gundam Force characters
Rather disappointingly, this wiki really doesn't have a lot of information on the SD Gundam exclusives, like this one
Sorry to tag you one more time, but I just remembered... <@99695384296701952>
https://gundam.fandom.com/wiki/CAPG-78_Captain_Gundam
I've been putting UnChild in particular on loop, for its English versions of many songs from it. And I think it's made me realise... *Man, I just thought of many things I could be putting in my CDJapan bookmarks with this list of things I've been looping on Spotify.*
To close out this conversation, I think my excitement for my new package has really gotten me listening to Gundam Unicorn's vocal songs all over again
... Then again, considering some of the things from the older ones (that I haven't seen much of, mind), I should hope that it does crank the silliness up to eleven
I wonder how stupid could you get before it loops back around to being a novel concept, rather than a ridiculous farce
Which, on a related tangent, is something of a fun detail about Gunpla Battle Nexus Online's staff. For whatever reason, the head honchos in charge of managing this fictional game all prefer using SD Gundam Force characters as their Diver Look, with Game Master (aka ||Mr. Katsuragi||) favouring the form of... well, the SD Gundam Force version of Gun**Diver** https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/gundam/images/2/24/Game_Master_in_second_opening.png/revision/latest?cb=20180718075641
And this thing even shows up in GBD:R!
https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/gundam/images/f/fa/Gunpanzer-gbdr.png/revision/latest?cb=20200827154354
https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/gundam/images/4/42/Gunpanzer-gbdr2.png/revision/latest?cb=20200827154411
I admit, I think the only other reason I remember the fact that GunBike was a thing was because I know about what it was rebuilt into
The very first game ever made by Inti Creates, after their inception
I literally just remembered about that because my brain is sort-of hardwired to think of this first with the name "Gunbike" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_Power_Gunbike
Captain Gundam's former mentor, apparently
Wasn't that thing literally called GunBike, or...
That second one is a **deep** cut.
Benjamin V2 Gundam, and Edward Second V.

I haven't seen a minute of SDWH, but still can't believe they went with this
Then again, that's probably why SD GUNDAM WORLD HEROES was what it was...
That's fair enough, though considering it's been one of their most recurring themes, maybe it couldn't be helped when they were essentially rebooting it in the SD GUNDAM WORLD continuity
So I guess the takeaway from what I'm getting is that you aren't as enthused at the fact that they kept going for the Romance of the Three Kingdoms for inspiration?
Things like this do exist
https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/gundam/images/7/75/KnightUnicornDestroy.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20150103042624
Yeah, I was gonna say, like...
I'm not sure if I really get it all that much, given that it kinda just sounds to me like the sort of design that SD Gundam has been doing for several years
Right, so like... Expanding the original designs with a punch that only SD Gundam can provide? Or something like that...
Fair, fair. Suzuoki voiced him up until CCA, if I'm not mistaken.
Random thought for you Gundam peeps out there... What do you think of Ken Narita's performance as Bright Noa?
Me, I really, really enjoy his performance, and I think he's a fitting successor to the late Hirotaka Suzuoki. I've been rewatching Gundam Unicorn, as you might guess from some of my previous messages here, and doing so reminded me of the fact that Narita took over for the role starting with UC, continuing to voice him in all appearances since - including the upcoming Cucuruz Doan's Island, and presumably he'll also be there when Bright finally enters the story in the second Hathaway movie.
that alone just *sent* me
That one goddamn shot of it turning with animation then transitioning into a goddamn asset zoom-in
Indeed. And while I've never seen that specific anime before, that animation can tell me a lot about the era in which it came out
watching all those early 2000's anime every morning before going to school
The animation style alone is giving me nostalgic vibes for all the wrong reasons
This got me laughing and also reminded me of this https://youtu.be/DK_oUbPqaQ8
S stands for Shenshoujing
Too tempting to click on the screenshots
I must admit, this is diminishing my motivation to watch Nanoha myself
cause it would explain a lot - I've long harboured a suspicion that much of my reaction towards Gundam SEED and Gundam SEED Destiny are more along the lines of what Japan thinks of those series, rather than the overseas fans
Wonder if Japan loves the thing more than the west does
... then again, I have been rather public about how I don't like much in Cosmic Era outside of it, original Freedom and (Aile) Strike
lemme destroy those hopes right now by saying that I am one of those people who likes Strike Freedom, lol
If *that's* the excuse that the model kits end up running with, you know for sure that it's really dumb even in-universe
And this is friggin' model kit lore here
it's literally only like that to be a pair with Strike Freedom
Though the excuse for Infinite Justice having its silver PS Armor frame coating is, IMO, much dumber
Yeah, only cause the lore says they made up for the exposed frame by giving it a coating of Phase Shift Armor, heh
Really does emphasise the fact that several parts of the Strike Freedom's frame are exposed (sacrificing defensive ability for speed, last I remember)
So. Much. Gold.

The precious little cinnamon roll of this season, I guess?
Why did Ippei Gyoubu draw a Spinner Rodi saying "Shit" 5 years ago
oh my god https://twitter.com/ippeigyoubu/status/1527590325211975680?s=20&t=y-iUzr4fb7dZo1ZAFO6-WQ
I only know one thing about Valvrave aside from the hearsay: Its OP was a collab between T.M.Revolution and Nana Mizuki, and it's on one of the first few albums I ever imported from Japan, Nana Mizuki's *THE MUSEUM III*
Oh, Valvrave the Liberator, huh?
At least, as far as I remember, he was
Lancelot, as drawn by its original mechanical designer
Meanwhile, I'll post this on the note of AKIMAN https://twitter.com/akiman7/status/955455384512163842?t=HhvF8nvvlXCuFOhtnSqCAw&s=19
I am curious as well, won't lie.
It was through my rewatch of Code Geass (after repeatedly dropping it) that got me to realise that Akira Yasuda designed mecha for that, and not just G-Self
I know it, you know it, all people who have watched it to the end know it
Most of my memory of Code Geass right now is taken up by this song https://open.spotify.com/track/26yTRCX89Ur88Gzl7Dwdiv?si=1CRl9kCBTOKamKyvbxbQWA&utm_source=copy-link&context=spotify%3Aplaylist%3A37i9dQZF1DX05YNpFuDzLK
R2, huh? Welp
They still had pizza, yes, but no sponsorship, and less of the fanservice
Funny, cause I primarily watched the movies which didn't have either
Wonder if they'll have updates for Z of the Recapture this year...
Revenge as a plotline, sure, but what the heck defines a revenge fantasy in fictional media like anime?
Maybe? I don't know. I have absolutely no idea what is supposed to count as a revenge fantasy...
Is it bad that my exposure to "revenge fantasy" as a genre is mostly just hearsay of Goblin Slayer and Redo of Healer? Cause I feel like their own infamy may have irrevocably altered my perception a bit...
I guess I'm just more enthralled by stories closer to home, or in the realm of science fiction
That's not the thing that turns me away from the genre, though...
I guess I'm not much of a high fantasy guy in general
no I don't
There have been some that piqued my interest, but mostly of things I was already familiar with - the Splatoon manga, Kirby manga, and particularly, Mobile Suit Gundam: The Origin
I haven't really ever tried to read manga or light novels ever since becoming a weeb
So basically, people realised in this case?
In any case... I'll shut up before I delve into it further and mix myself up into territory I have clearly not yet tread
Lemme correct myself: Instead of heated debate, I should have said discourse
I just find the very concept of shipping unappealing in general, cause of the heated debate it comes with
I don't do ships for this reason
I only know Gundam Unicorn and that is 2D and 3D both... Wonder if there is a list of full CG anime
Geez, what 3DCG anime would have been a thing back then...?
Right...
Early 2000's?
and also JOBS IT so the protags get their time in the sub
Where the Vic Viper actually appears
Sky Girls...
Now I gotta rewatch *Expelled From Paradise* cause I need to see all these moments again
and for whatever reason the last known Gradius spinoff had character designs by the guy who did Sgt. Frog
To keep it anime related... There was a Salamander OVA once
I forget, does Angela remain that way once she returns to Eden to report on her findings?
You don't even know the half of it. It's got everything you could want in terms of horrifying lore in a sci-fi work
But I can ramble about R-Type and its batshit insane lore another time
Not exactly content, I'd say... More like, it's the requirement to be able to pilot the Ragnarok at all
cause for whatever reason, there is lore for a pilot in it which is a 23yo woman trapped in a 14yo body, piloting one of the strongest craft in the army
This reminds me of some of the horriffic rumours that surround things in the R-TYPE SHMUP series, lmao
IDK if it's the shading or the proportions, but it felt like XC3 chara design was different from XC2 and anything else I had seen from Saito up to now
Makes me wonder if there's anything Saito contributed to recently which is more comparable to the designs of XC3's new characters
Right down to their wardrobe choices.
On the plus side, I got the comparison image I wanted
https://i.redd.it/v1klc6vs1jh01.png
I should have known that Google would give me hornyposting if I tried to search her up...
seriously, what was her name again... All I remember was family name "Balzac"
You watch that, see the female protag and then you see where Xenoblade Chronicles 2's Mythra comes from
Also watched that, mostly thanks to Masatsugu Saito
... just on a side note, I mostly got my copy of that album for TESTAMENT -Aufwachen Form-
Its opening is *also* present on THE MUSEUM III
Already done that
It *did* seem to force Attack on Titan's games to be called "A.O.T." in Japan, though
In the other, you have SnK... or SNK Corporation
In one case, you have HnK... or Hokuto no Ken
Don't get me wrong, I *love* Land of the Lustrous... but I just realised abbreviating it annoys me just as much as people who abbreviate Attack on Titan to Shingeki no Kyojin
https://tenor.com/bemx7.gif
I have a huge issue with this abbreviation...
Ah, that is true... Neil Sedaka compared to Gackt
Maybe in different cultures...
Apparently there's gonna be some new animation cuts in this Special Edition...
Well, it's not exactly unheard of for Gundam to receive OVA or movie length recuts. Several series have had them - First Gundam, Gundam 00, Gundam SEED, G-Reco, the list goes on
covering a significant story arc all in one go
At least, that's how I imagine it would go
OVA recut style, making episodes into movies
and as part of it, they will also be slotting in Urdr-Hunt's animation somewhere in this SE
This version of the animation is what the upcoming Mobile Suit Gundam IRON-BLOODED ORPHANS G will be using for its animated cutscenes, last I remember
Mobile Suit Gundam IRON-BLOODED ORPHANS Special Edition, yes, which was IIRC announced at the 5th Anniversary event last year
MAN WITH A MISSION back again, with *Blaze*
just like the Code Geass rerun, we've got a brand new OP for G-Tekketsu Special Edition
https://youtu.be/rTamYmhLOaw Oh holy shit
<@527865934380138509> Also, to point out one more thing about Inori Minase... She's the voice of Carol Malus Dienheim in Symphogear, so you should be familiar with her in that respect
The N is important
Inori =/= Iori
That threw me off the first time I heard of Inorin, lol
AH YES... *Iori* Minase
Rem was her big breakout role
This alone should show you how popular Inori Minase is nowadays

Fairly sure that at this point in time, that shot of Terry is his current avatar on Twitter
Masami Obari seems to look back on it fondly enough to call straight back to it with the KOFXV animation he did

Humikane Shimada, the person responsible for giving birth to the mecha musume genre
Ah yes, one of the many machinations of this person https://twitter.com/humikane?t=gzBtcX-EFWKbaLjLK2k6bg&s=09
Random thoughts again: Thinking about how Unicorn Gundam is so popular, it infects some other series too - Liu Bei was turned into a Unicorn Gundam in *SD GUNDAM WORLD SANGOKU SOKETSUDEN*, and Gundam Helios of *Gundam Breaker Mobile/Gundam Breaker Battlogue* fame utilises Psycho-Frame as part of its new additions after Areus.

Yes, I like the Unicorn Gundam. It's probably very annoying to some of you at this point that I talk about it so often. Maybe I'm the definition of a Gundam simpleton?
Guess that may be starting to change, at least in the manga and LN side of things
They haven't really explored that sort of thing too much in anime, huh?
Simulcast in the planning. Just the news I needed to hear.
And speaking of... https://youtu.be/XLDVIwtBFx4
https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLJV1h9xQ7Hx-uvgik4inbN1ngrfMaSPkU And if you wish to watch it for yourself, here! GundamInfo's got you covered.
Long story short, the series happened to be rather ill-timed when it debuted.
I can't blame them for the decision, though. The Gunpla for that series were being manufactured in China, and, well, the series was their latest take on a classic piece of Chinese literature
Even a few seconds of the opening were altered to remove reference to the ongoing pandemic!
They altered the name of the virus from Yellow Zombie Virus to Etiolation Trinity, altered all the dialogue that referred to it to suit (including on the model kits!) and reuploaded the series, resuming from where they left off right before the sequel series was set to begin (SD GUNDAM WORLD HEROES)
I'm 100% serious with this. In fact, it took a long while before they finally released the last three episodes for this reason
Random: Thinking about the fact that the pandemic literally forced a hiatus on an SD Gundam series that adapted the Romance of the Three Kingdoms because the Yellow Turban Rebellion was portrayed as a virus
The cover for that edition was referenced in Gundam Build Divers Episode 19, which may also be a tribute to them cause one of its members had recently died (I forgot the name, though)
https://i.redd.it/460y952e1kny.jpg
https://i0.wp.com/www.gunpla101.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/linkin-park.png?resize=1024%2C872&ssl=1
With its shield looking like the album cover
a special Gundam GP01 "Zephyrantes" Full Burnern that came in a special edition of A Thousand Suns
https://gunpla.fandom.com/wiki/HGUC_RX-78GP01-Fb_Gundam_%22Zephyranthes%22_Full_Burnern_(Linkin_Park_Edition)
Yes, that was exactly it
Really comes full circle when you realise Linkin Park were featured on, if I'm not mistaken, the very first *Mobile Suit Gundam EXTREME VS* title
https://twitter.com/kel_roth/status/1531390090345435136?t=aCgIZlQN1--Ili8iyiMeqg&s=19
But the explanation suddenly makes a lot of sense
... seeming as I'm not watching this series at the moment, I didn't even pick up on that
Fair point there, haha
Or any analogue like G-Tube (which is what Gundam Build Divers Re:RISE did)
From the art style, I'd assume so... I don't know any other series with eyes like that
Ah yes... You're now entering deeper Newtype territory
PFFFFFF
Hiroko Moriguchi got to choose colours for three Gunpla special editions to go with GUNDAM SONG COVERS 3, for example
Or colour schemes chosen by whoever it is it's themed after
I imagine it is for this reason that many of the more recent comments on the music video for *Rage your dream* are about Keiji Fujiwara and his passing
Of course, the other major iconic moment is after the oft-memed Shingo EG6 crash
And ||one last time in Final Stage, during the epilogue showing the future of the cast after the Eight-Six's demise||
They use it again in Fourth Stage because they knew there wouldn't be any Initial D animation for a good while, so it served as a final farewell
And they knew it, too
And of course, we will never be receiving a new vocal song from those two again
Which is a bit sad since it probably means the chances of hearing this song in it will be much lower https://youtu.be/KoFSQeOAYz4
God... I'm just realising that by the time MF Ghost is airing, it will have been more than a decade since m.o.v.e disbanded
Back in Fourth Stage's time, you wouldn't have the faintest idea of who she was because she wasn't quite old enough to begin making a name for herself
Enough time had passed between them that they were able to cast Hayamin into one of the supporting roles
God, now I'm being reminded about the huge gap between Fourth Stage and Fifth Stage
One of the Sad Lonely Drivers is voiced by big block Gundam pilot
Kazuki Yao as well, which threw me the hell off after later realising he was Judau Ashta
Initial D: Battle Digest is basically Battle Stage but for the Legend films, and restores order to the Force by replacing the rock music with Eurobeat
That, thankfully, is why Battle Digest exists.
Yes he was.
cause all those were beyond the time of that torrent, I think
... well, when I say "literally everything", it doesn't include Battle Stage 3 (which is kinda crap anyway), the Legend films, or Battle Digest
Fair enough. Think the cat site does have a torrent containing literally everything up to Final Stage, so you could try using that if you wanna catch up before MF Ghost starts next year
I guess while I have your attention, did you respond at all to the recent MF Ghost PV?
https://tenor.com/view/initiald-shingo-gif-9855030
I GOT NO IMPRESSION
Though it was also a time before I began yo recognise names in the biz
Who, yes, like you, was one of if not the first time I heard Koyasu's voice in anything
The fact that he became DIO and was also Deadpool at one point threw me off precisely because of Ryosuke Takahashi
I can't believe it. I never thought I would encounter anyone with this view, but there you go.
https://tenor.com/bsYm1.gif
though in hindsight, it made me realise why several of the Dragon Ball YouTubers I was watching enjoy it so much
Mind you, I did not realise *any* of it had to do with the power of friendship and other shonen tropes
Arguably, I get far more out of my Amazon Prime subscription because I'm very, very constantly replaying Mythbusters, Top Gear and The Grand Tour on there
The most that I get out of my CR sub, funnily enough, is catching up on things that I *wanted* to watch back in the day but never bothered to, like GRANBELM
And most of the time, I just... don't end up watching much else, unless it is a series on there that I have already watched in the past
Case in point, most of the time I'm watching stuff on CR, it's usually Gundam or Symphogear. The only seasonal anime I'm watching right now is AMAIM Warrior at the Borderline, continuing from where I left off when I cancelled my Funimation sub
By no means in a malicious way... I just kinda don't bother with anime much of the time, unless it's a series or studio I really care about
... and a lot of the time I tend to avoid the hot seasonal stuff
I never really bothered with Demon Slayer just because I'm hardly into anime, I guess
Then I'd have to give myself a stern scolding later
Then again, I guess the fact that a CyberConnect2 game exists for it should have told me everything
... I thought it was more mature than that from what I had seen...
so I had zero idea that The Power of Friendship‚Ñ¢Ô∏è was involved at all
I have not seen a *minute* of Demon Slayer aside from a few things
Don't ask me, I have no idea how Shonen Jump works
that being said, I guess that would be the only thing they run in said magazine
Shonen as in the *genre,* not just the fact that it runs in a specific magazine
Is it seriously?
That isn't even a shonen, is it? So I think Chazo's point stands
Part 3: The Third Part
I would like a full keyboard, thanks. I'm not letting anyone pry my keycaps.
I mean, they cut down First Gundam to three movies...
which recently got dropped in their latest album, *Break and Cross the Walls II*
Also comes with a brand new MWAM opening, *Blaze*
It's a 9 episode recut, with new animation cuts apparently
What if Mobile Suit Gundam IRON-BLOODED ORPHANS Special Edition ends up changing some of the vocal songs used during some of the show's key moments?
I just had a bit of a random thought...
is that it has mobile suit design I actually *like* from CE
The only reason I have to disagree with that
I think my mind's being infected by the RX-78-02, which does have the decal on its chestplate in all of its appearances (Gundam The Origin and Cucuruz Doan's Island) as well as their respective model kits
... wait, no
Oh geez, the chestpiece of the RX-78-2, huh
The butterfly of death and rebirth, an eternal recurrence, and the perfect excuse for Bandai to keep milking it for all of time
I mean, if you go by Turn A Gundam, humanity is doomed to repeat itself in many a Gundam timeline
Thanks, Noboru Sogetsu
and the only timeline that even remotely has an Amuro-like is Anno Domini
See, the big problem with that is that **it's a completely different timeline**
Okay, I did not expect the drop of *Crossbone* plot
I forget if it actually gets destroyed or not, but wasn't the data from it used to produce some new mobile suits for the Federation afterw--
and this is one of those times, considering Lowe Guele's been voiced since like the mid 2000's
sometimes, trying to imagine some of the things I learn about for Gundam really gets my head going
Okay, **this** is news to me
Or what...
Wait, *that's* what 8 is?
This discussion's also reminding me of how much I *adore* the first ED for the series, which hands down is one of my favourite Gundam EDs of all https://open.spotify.com/track/6Ex1rZLSCmr7JfCRWyxJzR?si=75b16423807740f0
cause it was recent enough to end up incorporating ||Gundam SEED|| into the Black History
One of the stranger things I find about it is how one of the manga uses it
Needless to say, I think the higher ups didn't like the idea
Or at least, that's what I remember about the original plans for the Black History...
And while ultimately it is revealed that the Black History is ||a historical record of all of the Gundam series that came before it, showing humanity's conflicts repeating themselves eternally||, originally Tomino wanted it to be not just that, but *everything else he ever worked on*
For context to those who aren't aware, the Black History is one of the key plot points of Turn A Gundam
Geez, no wonder Tomino originally wanted Ideon to be part of the Black History
and that it may or may not have been the reason certain series he was involved in had a lot of death in it
I admit, I don't really know much else about the Tomino depression arc other than the fact that he left Gundam into the hands of other people (which gave birth to Mobile Fighter G Gundam, and the concept of alternate Gundam timelines in general)
A story that lasts all the way up until he beat his depression and made Turn A
It's kind of a long story, strangely enough
depression arc Tomino, hmm?
Thanks for once again torturing my vivid imagination, Mel
**EW**
I'm not sure if the retcons will be what you expect, if there are any
the story itself happens between the events of Season 1 and Season 2, so they will probably drop the Urdr-Hunt Special after the events of Season 1 are done
There's supposed to be something related to Urdr-Hunt, apparently, yes
where a guy gets isekai'd into being Yamcha
Dragon Ball kinda did the reverse of that
While Katoki's not the only mechanical designer in Gundam, far from it... Yeah, this is super out-there
oh wait, A New Translation happened
aren't you glad he's ||a vegetable|| now
... well, actually, I have one idea, it's cause I was viewing these specific BD boxes on CDJapan recently
I have no idea why I wanted to use *that* as my citation
According to the U.C. Chronicle... U.C.0153 https://st.cdjapan.co.jp/pictures/l/16/40/BCXA-1485.jpg?v=2
Unicorn was kinda the thing that got them to realise, "Oh, this shit's profitable"
Well, it took a long time before Sunrise even *thought* about making novel or manga to animation for Gundam
There's *so many Astray instalments*
And the insane thing... is that it's the most expansive side story in all of Gundam that isn't Universal Century
which has no less than... maybe four, *five* different designations
Honestly, it gets much worse with the grandaddy
https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/gundam/images/c/cd/BB_Senshi_207.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20151002054343
Bandai's been referring to it as the GP03D since *at least* the year 2000
OKAY, **NEVER MIND ME**
Wait, no, it isn't
Wonder if it's a 0083 REBELLION thing
Now I just need to find out where
Seems that somewhere, they *do* run with "GP03D" for the model number. Huh.
I'm checking something right now on the GP03's page
Wait, hold on a second...
Some cases annoy me, others don't
Though this is only really annoying to me because I'm a stickler for trying to stick to proper names whenever possible
Yes, that thing does have its own model number
... which is the GP03S
https://tenor.com/bGpFb.gif
heck, I think only the GP02A had a letter by default after the numbers
Orchis is important, yes, but it's not called "GP03D"
It's simply RX-78GP03 Dendrobium
it's just GP03, or GP03S if it's just the Gundam
I legit get annoyed at it being called "GP03D" because that's *not* its model number
I mean, why would I not? I've seen it, I'm hype for the next movie, fuck the haters
heck, I'm fairly sure the animation version of Xi-G doesn't have the traditional mouth vents
Compare it to Katoki's previous design for the Xi Gundam, they are *miles* apart
it looked less Katoki and more big bug eye, like the original Xi design
Honestly this is why I'm glad that Xi Gundam turned out like it did for the animation
and because he knows all of the Dragon Ball plot he can turn things around for Yamcha
which I guess means that whoever was running nukes in the Battle of Loum were either stupid or suicidal
Reading on the Wiki is mentioning that the armor and cooling are there to protect it from the explosion, though it could only do so at the edge of it
Hold on, which Zaku was that?
it's only in other material where it seems to use anything else other than the nuke, sabers and vulcans
GP02A was designed to do one thing, basically
GP02A is a **chonker**
and it's one of three made by Shoji Kawamori, *yaaaaaay*
Purely material for video games and MSV, more or less.
... and now the thing that's gonna nag at me is how GP01 and GP02 *don't* have a suffix that matches their codenames (Zephyrantes, Physalis)
https://gundam.fandom.com/wiki/RX-78GP04G_Gundam_%22Gerbera%22 Yep, it does
at least, if I'm remembering correctly, it does
Also, to be honest, this is also reminding me that GP04G... has a G in it
I'm aware. It's me getting on a tangent again cause I realise that it gets worse than GP03 for me, lol
The differences between the lineart, dear god
https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/gundam/images/7/78/RX78GP01_GundamZephyranthes_-_Front_View.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20121114193455
https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/gundam/images/8/86/Rx-78gp03s.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20201007135659
It's really unnatural to have that Katoki style blocky look with the GP02A's curves
This just looks so off to me compared to the original Physalis
https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/gundam/images/8/8d/RX-78GP02A_Gundam_GP02A_%28Type-MLRS%29_Front.png/revision/latest?cb=20220421063151
Oh god, this one's a Katoki design?
But that's just my conjecture.
so I guess maybe he imagined that you'd need the bulk because of it being close to a nuke
cause apparently he cares a *lot* about the mechanical details of things he designs
The only thing I could gather from reading stuff like that is that this is Shoji Kawamori's attention to detail at work
Reading about the lore of the GP02A on the wiki, apparently it was a matter of pilot safety for why the damn thing was so bulky... and this is despite the fact that the division who made the thing were basically all ex-Zeon
The hell do you mean? Anaheim existed basically *after* the OYW and then sells to all parties, like what
As much as I'd like to keep playing devil's advocate, tbh I can't really find an excuse other than "is Anaheim Electronics fully integrated yet"
get Bright to slap Amuro before he can morb
I mean, the Feddies *were* lagging behind in that regard, so idk
Hence Fullburnern for the name?
I doubt it will. Xi-G's whole schtick is looking like an impostor, hence the big eyes and the unusual head compared to Odysseus/Penelope. Colours may change, but who knows...
Anyway, think I should sleep...
so there's actually a chance of a G Generation style colour scheme for the new Xi-G as, say, Premium Bandai, in the future
Oh, that reminds me... I think some Gunpla nerds I talked to mentioned that the runners were moulded in a way that would allow particular parts to be reprinted in different colours in the future
and then did it again in the sequel
SEED, well it basically just copied the grandaddy twice over
Barbatos throughout all of its incarnations is a little more obviously traditional in its tricolours.
Exia, for example. You can hardly see the yellow parts on it.
And hell, as much as some designs try their darnedest to also avert it, there's almost always a hint of it somewhere
Thus, the iconic tricolour of the Gundam came to be
but then the higher-ups said "It needs some *colour* so it can *sell*"
cause Tomino really wanted to make sure you knew it was a military weapon
I find it kinda hilarious to think about, considering the Gundam (or Gunboy, I think that was what it was gonna be called) was supposed to be all white or all grey
I think the reason it doesn't is because it didn't have that in the novel
Like the G Generation/Gundam Fix Figuration design, huh?
Cause it truly feels unnatural and bulky
https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/gundam/images/1/11/Xi_gundam_anime_front_HQ.png/revision/latest?cb=20201112115233 Compare it with this, which I think is *brilliance*
I still think this is the most cursed Katoki redesign, personally, and I mentioned it earlier
https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/gundam/images/b/b3/Rx-105-ka.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20100425121052
Above: Shoji Kawamori. Decidedly old school, could easily fit in with things like Zeta Gundam.
Below: Hajime Katoki. If you've seen one, you've seen them all, I daresay, and if you've ever seen Gundam Wing you definitely have.
Cause it would help to explain why they look the way they do
Is there any credits on mechanical design for Shinkalion?
They wouldn't be the first line from them to have received animated treatment
Also, isn't it a Takara Tomy merch line?
Go figure, too, it's a special variant...
It's a Bandai Namco Pictures thing, so I guess they're allowed to do that, heh
Part of me wonders how, but the other part is telling me I probably won't like what I hear
Pfffff
I admit, I thought the comparison was to Konosuba and not the smapho one
so even that comparison is lost on me
I... don't really watch big anime
If I remember correctly, Hathaway included the dub when it went live on Netflix
Oh, wait... I just remembered one key thing in that regard
If we go by the way Hathaway was distributed... it could be a month or two before we receive confirmation of a streaming distribution
It could be a little while longer before they drop G-Doan on a place like Netflix, though at the same time, there is a lot of work to be done for G-Witch as well as the still-no-new-details Gundam live action
I'm kinda just going over a few things to put it into perspective of how I have typically seen them operate
Don't worry, I'm well aware of the motivations, lol
https://tenor.com/view/terry-bogard-king-of-fighters-xv-kof-xv-team-fatal-fury-gif-24669076
They did upload the teaser a while back, of course...
As of right now, it seems they don't have any streaming arrangements on Netflix or other places for G-Doan
Like, it was only recently that they dropped the G-Witch teaser on there
The promos generally only drop on GundamInfo once they confirm the arrangement, so fair enough I guess
For those curious, it's this one. https://open.spotify.com/track/1WuVlwQNx6SLxj5p5UWSZL?si=TLyQyYhTT7Kogq78-ZcCyw&utm_source=copy-link
Half the reason my eyes well up in tears when I watch Maidragon is because of this *one* specific song used in the series' most emotional moments
... hottest take I have ever heard
I usually just repeat anime as background noise while I do the other things
~~Redo of Healer~~
Makes me wonder, was the Netflix streaming version also like that?
Guess with all the chaos of the pandemic, and the multiple delays, it might have slipped through their minds
I feel like it can't be helped for something like that - after all, it was made for a theatre experience
Fair enough. The full theatre experience and all that.
If I'm reading the box for the Hathaway BD right... It lists Dolby Atmos, Linear PCM (Stereo), and Dolby Surround for audio
Hold on, where is my copy... I should be able to check this
Fair enough, I guess
So basically, an issue for those who can't afford such a setup?
Fair, I guess. Still, the majority of contents should be the same
Ah, for lighting and stuff?
Wait, did they? Is there a comparison?
I know for certain, the BD import of Hathaway is the same as the Theatre Limited Edition, just without the Hathaway novel and accompanying Audiobook CD
Like, I don't think there were any changes at all to the Hathaway BD
The way that Sunrise operates these days means that Gundam theatre releases are ready to go onto physical media, and the contents do not change much from their eventual public release
Highly doubt it'll be for fixes
and I bought the damn single for the theme song
Which annoys me as I want to watch it legit, be it streaming, BD or theatres, lol
The film is barely a week old in Japanese theatres
Wait, you mean you picked up the BD or what?

Also, if I'm not mistaken, that was actually for a challenge
I mean, half of what Camellia is doing these days is basically that. I would post some examples in <#447132690349555712>, but I need sleep
And he did THAT within one week
Admittedly... the latter DID once add his composition to something as simple as do-re-mi https://youtu.be/7Mat5FGboSc
and a slice of life anime does not need something as grandiose as Yuki Hayashi or Hiroyuki Sawano
Background music makes the mood
Not exactly becoming of a soldier trained since childhood...
~~also, EW designs over TV~~
cause then you get all of it in a properly coherent, complete version of the story
though, again, that's why I feel like I'd want to read GoL instead
At least it had the series writer on board
cause it's the piece of media which ties everything together
This is admittedly renewing my motivation to read Glory of the Losers
there is a reason for that
Hey, his fiance dieded
Which begs the question. Why the laugh in the first place? At least in my mind, it's the only explanation that works for something that is otherwise relatively out of character for Heero
... especially considering his backstory, as you see in flashbacks later on in the series and in Endless Waltz
Anyone who comes into Gundam Wing knowing Heero only as that personality surely has to wonder why he laughs a fuckton upon landing that Buster Rifle shot
hence why people speculate that it was those specific events that were the catalyst for the change in Heero's personality to become what we primarily know him for, which is stoic and rather cold for the most part
The weight that comes with ||being responsible for killing off a chance at peace and giving OZ the excuse to start a war|| weighs heavy, I'd imagine
cause the dude got hit with a hard dose of reality
After the events of *Scenario for Bloodshed,* Heero hardly ever smiles or laughs
https://youtu.be/R29g6YObKLE
The ONE time you can visibly see and audibly hear Hikaru Midorikawa laughing as Heero
What? Do you not recall Episode 1?
Dude despairs over it, and then has to live with that responsibility while trying to make things right
Fun fact, some people like to speculate that Heero Yuy stopped laughing and smiling in Gundam Wing because of a specific event that happens in the series ||where he accidentally kills a key peace figure in a false flag operation, and he has to live with the burden of bringing OZ to power||
... except for this
https://tenor.com/view/heero-yuy-gundam-wing-laughing-laugh-gif-20499486
Heero is as cold as ice
Not all of them whine, lmao
a lot of CBR posts here over the past day
so I guess in a sense, I see myself as the guinea pig
The premise of a female protag already has me intrigued, so I'm in - and even if it goes south, someone has to be there to document how far it goes, lol
I managed to do so for GBD and GBD:R, so I figure I may as well going forward
Honestly, I think a large part of me as a Gundam fan is being there for the simulcast
obligatory Aogami post
https://tenor.com/view/shin-megami-tensei-shin-megami-tensei5-smt-v-smt5-sad-gif-23763960
How is that *Shonen*
CROSS ANGE...?
October is when G-Witch begins, so the info is likely to go over the basic premise, introduce the cast, maybe give us the prologue episode
The other guy was definitely on AC, they list ACfA on their profile https://twitter.com/daily_core/status/1437464931213852674?s=20&t=gesvBJ0DmmoXCQp8wFEnew
Ah. Wonder why Block said it was Armored Core as fuck, then
Wouldn't surprise me, haha
I wonder if this is why people were believing or hinting at the fact that Beyond were involved in part with this series, cause I know for sure Kusumegi was working over there during GBD:R
https://i0.wp.com/www.gunpla101.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image22.png?resize=1200%2C675&ssl=1
For the record, these are the storyboards from what was a *last-minute cameo* that paid tribute to Nipako, the former mascot for the GodHand hobby company and their nippers
... and of all things, he was responsible for *this* https://twitter.com/megi_sin/status/1299240257041264640?s=20&t=cfv9w4zQRZ3WI3lffjvmeA
Perhaps most notably for me, he was chief mecha animator for Gundam Build Divers Re:RISE
Saw Kusumegi's name, knew I recognised it from somewhere https://www.sakugabooru.com/post/show/106467
That would explain why I came across Armored Core when searching the other name I didn't recognise https://twitter.com/inaba_koh/status/1537675845992558592?s=20&t=TfZ80D9PgOChGj0ZSBHnDg
Oh, they're Armored Core alumni?
A lot of the usual suspects in this list, and a couple of surprises (alongside the out-of-left-field JNTHED)
In any case, staff page for G-Witch lists these peeps as mechanical designers
I might be misremembering who I talked to about it, heh
This guy is the one responsible for Gundam Aerial
Okay, so ALL OUR GUESSES were wrong. <@99695384296701952> <@228659769404030976> <@272127150579122178>

<@782841825069236236> My apologies if you saw some sort of kitty cringe sticker earlier. I have no idea how I sent that but I did not mean to
Really? All I heard was that Sunrise Beyond were gearing up for something new, but others put the idea into our head that Beyond would be handling the next Gundam... Despite the fact that they were busy with AMAIM Warrior.
One month from now, I think.
That will be something
Code Geass scriptwriter...
Completely new timeline, huh...
I am beginning to think I confused myself about where I talked about it, heh
And also, according to the profile, they're also involved in Urusei Yatsura and Spriggan
Seeing the artwork they did is making me see how those aspects went into the design of Gundam Aerial
https://twitter.com/JNTHED/status/1519654260987731969?s=20&t=b3pJj_EX3IFfa5FdwMKt2Q Right?
Yeah, now that I see it, that teaser image for G-Witch makes a lot of sense to me now
Seeing this pinned tweet from the character designer... https://twitter.com/m_o_g_m_o_g_555/status/1340867406353219586?s=20&t=82H5BfUpxjHOSeoseHU0rg
I always called it "cute game dev"
Which mobage, even? Cause there are at least two
Then again, have they finished the anniversary rebroadcast of the TV series?
At the same time, the whereabouts of this series... have kinda disappeared into the aether since its announcement
Apparently, the upcoming Z of the Recapture will follow on from where Lelouch of the Re;surrection left off
Well, with the exception that apparently ||she is the one who delivers Lelouch's corpse to C.C.||, but in the grand scheme of things, that point probably won't matter as much compared to the other changes in the Code Geass movies
https://tenor.com/view/puchiko-anime-happy-di-gi-charat-nekomimi-gif-23459999
Sawashiro has been in a lot of stuff
But that is about all I know, other than the viral GIFs from the series
What it has that Symphogear does not... are movies
... probably the ZERO System
Wing Zero is 0w0 but it's got a third eye
XXXG-00W0 Wing Gundam Zero
It's not far off from its actual model number
Zee Zee Gundam
or Zed Zed Gundam
I usually see W0, but never Wing 0.
Tomino didn't want any of that shit
Well that's the fault of the sponsors right there, lmao
And turned into the most broken piece of shit by the end <:ShemHaTilt:729980149529051156>
Certainly higher on the supply cost in terms of the many armaments it used throughout the series, probably to convey that aspect of the Gundam that it is still a military weapon at the end of the day
I think that very battle showed signs of his awakening, if I'm not mistaken. It's more obvious in the movies because it plays the Newtype flash sound which would then be associated with Newtypes and/or heightened senses for all of time in anime
thematically it goes with Shia Kijima's attire during that special
Yep. It's a QAN[T] with cat ears.
Oh yeah, this configuration... Wasn't that an 00V Senki thing?
https://gundam.fandom.com/wiki/GNT-0000SHIA_Gundam_00_Shia_Qan%EF%BC%BBT%EF%BC%BD
It's a custom Gunpla from *Gundam Build Fighters Try ISLAND WARS*
where it basically uses Quantum Burst for a massive speed boost, compared to Setsuna in his original which was for the purpose of communication
Oh, wait... I'm thinking of the 00 SHIA QAN[T] with what I said just then
Apparently it's cause lining them up causes a massive speed boost
then the shield could shift to the rear for Quantum Burst
And yes, that's how they were mounted
they were 6 and 7, never mind me
Wait, no, I had that wrong
Curiously, the QAN[T]'s GN Drives apparently had the designations of 07 and 08
they lost three genuine solar reactors at the end of Season 2, with only the ones from Cherudim and Arios surviving (which would later be fitted to Zabanya and Harute)
Both of 00's drives were returned to their original mobile suits during the final battle of 00 Season 2, and destroyed in the ensuing fight
that's why the 00 QAN[T] didn't have the problem when its Twin Drive System was being made, as the drives it received were made from the outset to work with it (now that they knew the tech itself existed, of course, because Aeolia is a sneaky bastard like that)
It was a compatibility thing, I think
Wasn't it shortened to 6 months for 00 QAN[T]? (Albeit, only because they managed to reverse engineer the process.)
though you'd only know that because of MSV
so in a sense, I guess the RX-78-2 is more like a "completed" version of that instead
With that being said... There *was* a Prototype Gundam
Cost-effectiveness, materials, other aspects of the technology...
I'm not really a military person, but if I were to give any sort of guess, that is the angle that was being aimed for
I wonder what kind of angle we're supposed to be looking at, when it comes to the status of prototype mobile suits in the Gundam franchise
Cause the EAF were far, far behind initially with MS tech until Operation V became a thing
I mean, are they not testing a lot of technology with the Gundam itself?
According to some factoids I picked up recently, things such as turbos, rotary engines, turbines and more all made their debut at Le Mans
They do sometimes feature technology that's being tested for the first time, apparently
Le Mans Prototypes can be pretty friggin' powerful
I don't know.... https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/69/Porsche%2C_IAA_2017%2C_Frankfurt_%281Y7A2248%29.jpg
it was apparently going to be called "Super Freedom"
... and also, how much dumber its *prototype* name was
God, even though I love that thing, it's reminding me of how dumb that name is
~~if anything the RG is probably even better~~
only Unicorn of those three is an MGEX
I mean, she's mentioning Strike
of all those, though, Barbatos would probably be the best bet if it's MG
... okay, fair point there, lmao
Has me wondering, how many times has an actual Gunpla appeared in non-Gundam anime? I swore I recall another besides Birdie Wing
Seems pretty ungrateful for the *limited edition PG* she received, holy crap
She's just an idiot, not a villain... but I think I get why you say that
Oh **FUCK THAT CHICK**
we don't have an Akira Tachibana emote, sadly, but I'm talking about the fact that Rau Le Creuset shares a voice with him (Toshihiko Seki)
TOPDAD?
The fans still argue about it today
And a lot of vitriol
What's your issue with that?
Well, be glad that G-Witch is a thing now, eh?
Ah yeah, the SEM
<a:pkingLeave:922107082403119164> Whoops.
And the entirety of the Gundam AGE lineage was basically made to mirror Universal Century (with AGE-FX being Nu)
While I would say it's melee, the C-Funnels and Sword Bits are also like that...
That's more or less what I was getting at with my point above, albeit Barbatos Lupus Rex is probably the big exception to the rule because it's wired and there's only one
... which annoys me somewhat because it means we always lose the Sydney Opera House - and a good chunk of the area that surrounds it
... I just realised, paraphrasing myself I basically said "fuck Flay" earlier, but I realise ||that's what Kira Yamato did||
Though I guess equally, there's been many protags whose endgame doesn't involve them - Wing Zero, V2, God Gundam... Turn A is also just endgame for the franchise
Think about it - you have the Fin Funnels, the DRAGOONs, GN Sword Bits, C-Funnels, friggin' Funnels made from *shields,* and even the Tail Blade
Before I drop out for the night, I will say this: It does kinda beg the question, why does so much of Gundam main protagonist endgame get equipped specifically with some form of remote weaponry?
That basically was what Strike Freedom was relative to the Freedom, eh
I'm just going by what I observed
I get why you posted it here, though, cause anime figure
... mostly cause several of them make the majority of us hot & bothered, lmao
I think most people who talk or post about figures do it in <#407060923078017026>, actually
Tsunako's signature bottom right
Well, not as many transparent parts
Programming, I reckon
The thing with the RG System is that it's designed to permeate the Plavsky Particles throughout the entire Gunpla to increase its output, none of that was going through any weapons I don't think
The Absorb and Discharge Systems only came into play one more time after their opponents rendered it useless
so they kinda have to use the RG at that point
Yeah, but people figured out the Star Build Strike's gimmicks
Believe it or not, very often the only weapon they can use to finish off their opponents in the latter half of GBF is the Build Knuckle. For a guy who is also relatively good at close quarters combat outside of Gunpla Battle, I'd say the evolution of Star Burning to Build Burning totally makes sense.

Chances are, maybe things were gonna be added to it later, but the unit was sealed up alongside Sei's memories of Reiji by the end of his school years
Both GBF protag Gunpla get rekt in the finals, and have to be repaired at least once for the sendoff. Beyond that, Kamiki Burning gets off relatively okay during the Nielsen Labs Incident, and Build Strike Galaxy Cosmos... also gets rekt.
And the thing that has people most excited is that *they brought the Eurobeat back*
To explain that a bit further, the animation of MF Ghost is coming in 2023, and it's the sequel to Initial D like the original manga was
Some people think that they're getting back on the right track by restoring order to MF Ghost
There's so many angles to avex, heh
I admit, the only reason I remember this is because one of them is portrayed by former fripSide vocalist Yoshino Nanjo
Weren't Muse all played by pretty high-profile CVs? Not that I'm discarding the status of any of the other groups within the franchise, but
Well, I'm not exactly that well versed in LL as a franchise, so I can't really say much in that regard
Or at least, that's the vibe I'd get when you consider other long-runner idol franchises like THE IDOLM@STER
I mean it in the sense of, there will be a time when the older hands will be unable to continue playing their roles, whether or not they're willing
Because eventually, those peeps wanna move on to other things
The heck is this supposed to be? Themed concert, or Aquors isekai
Kamen Rider, since the Heisei generations, is one long-running example I know of - avex music provides their talent for the franchise
They permeate a lot of entertainment media in general, that I know
Wufei would probably have an aneurysm upon finding out that G-Witch exists
And then you have the most obvious, Shenlong, which is Chinese and apparently was based directly on Dragon Gundam
Sandrock was Arabian, fittingly enough
It was American, with clown motifs
Heavyarms was, oh my god
Ah, Deathscythe was European, with a coffin-like shield, a solid scythe and dragon-like ornaments
I'm trying to find the other motifs right now, but all of the main five were designed like this
and, most obviously, by a shared glowing gem on the chest
You can see it in its shape that it basically succeeds Shining and God
Wing, for example, was Japan themed
Which had an interesting birth to them, too - the Wing TV designs were all originally based on the same country motif that G Gundam had
Yep. All those times, a sneak preview of the succeeding series
Fun fact, an early version of Wing Gundam can be seen towards the end
There are times when I have to remind myself that Tomoe Tamiyasu isn't just an eroge CV
EVERYTHING is just Bandai Namco advertising
I should probably watch Birdie Wing myself
that's a fuckin' Toadstool Tour special shot right there, holy shit
Curious... I kinda want to know some examples, if you're willing to share
I mean, Gundam "shenanigans" used to be blocks of 50 episodes airing week after week (although mileage may vary due to executive meddling). Gundam 00 was the first time I'm aware of where their current format of 24~26 episodes per series began
Dude, though, imagine if Urdr-Hunt comprised the entirety of G-Tekketsu Special Edition Episode 5 (since there's 9 episodes total)
But will it be long enough to be its own thing, or not...?
Chances are we'll get Urdr-Hunt showing up in the middle of the Special Edition broadcast, since the story itself does take place between Season 1 and Season 2
In terms of how many minutes of animation we get and all that, I mean.
I know SUNRISE BEYOND created stuff for G-Tekketsu G that'll play as you progress through the Urdr-Hunt story. What I'm *not* sure on is how much of it there is.
it's just airing in some form alongside G-Tekketsu SP
The thing with Urdr-Hunt is that I'm not even sure if it's a full animation
Though more than anything, I just want to see Fukuda experience sweet release from the hell of his and his wife's creation
You and me both
You've never heard a more graceful song about the apocalypse in your life
The song that plays at the credits of both Turn A compilation films
and I remembered it was a thing because of this song https://open.spotify.com/track/3ZoYbnjWUpnbmGSLJknOQk?si=62fadcd729a6424d
Turn A was another one
Now that I'm thinking about it, there were a lot more than I thought, mostly brought to cinema via compilation film
And I feel like such an idiot, because it has some of my all-time favourite Gundam designs
I forgot about A Wakening of the Trailblazer
Oh fuck, you're right
... well, technically also Regild Century, too, with its movie compilations
If I'm remembering correctly, only After Colony with Gundam Wing Endless Waltz has received the cinema treatment outside of UC works
If the Gundam SEED movie ever does come out, then it'll be one of the few non-UC timelines to receive a cinematic release, too
To date, the only non-Universal Century timeline to receive the treatment.
But then you have Cosmic Era which got 50 episodes *and* a sequel season of also 50 episodes
Please, it'll probably just be Heine's Destiny. That thing still exists in the CE timeline
Oh yeah, that reminds me... I need to watch the whole thing so I can be caught up for when Ecute drops into the picture
So says the person with a Chloe Sakamata profile picture...
Okay, yeah, I can absolutely see why they'd cancel airing that right now
Oh **geez,** seriously?
I can only assume that something happened, though I guess whatever it is has been mentioned in <#336297840529899522> and not here
I'll see you all later.
Don't want to find myself fuming from subjects like this
... yeah, I think I need a break from the server
Then we're done talking.
**Have some tact.**
I don't remember a Nina having a Haro... I guess you meant Nena Trinity's evil Haro
Seems they do a lot of mocap work. And VR.
https://dynapix.jp/works/ If anyone's curious as to other things they've done, while yes, several of them have been mentioned already, I managed to find their site. So here's their works page.
Long story short, I think this acquisition means that it'll be more than just commissioned shorts... But that's my take, in any case.
So my guess is that the acquisition of this company is part of the big N's plan to expand their IPs beyond games, which was stated a while back in a press release. Nothing much until now had come out of it, aside from the Mario movie by Illumination (which is still in production at this point in time)
And Digital Frontier, who did most of the Smash trailers (albeit, likely because Bandai Namco was involved with development and they're basically BNEI's go-to guys for CG trailers, openings and even full CG films for IPs like Tekken)
Thinking of things like anima Inc. and Sanzigen, who did Fire Emblem CG for Three Houses and the corresponding Byleth reveal trailer in Smash Ultimate
At the same time, they've already relied on other animation studios for that, too
Well, either way, I'm not taking part aside from this
Feels like we've been down this path before... or it may be me imagining that this chat has at some point
Are we gonna get into this again?
Cause if so, that's enough to convince me
Well, does it have Humikane Shimada as character designer?
Yep. OP16 of the franchise, if I recall, and I'm thankful the memes exist that led me to find the full thing
... Admittedly, a bunch of that is to do with the fact that she was voiced by Mika Kanai, which as a Neptunia fan was rather amusing
And it contains perhaps one of my favourite female leads in Gundam, Tiffa Adill
But yeah, I'll concur with the others - it's one of my favourites despite that
Unfortunately cut off by budget and executive meddling, from what I can recall
||Take your children to work day||
I should note, there's been some sequel manga works for it since this time, though I'm not really sure which ones are canon... beyond perhaps NEXT PROLOGUE (which was included with one of its more recent Blu-ray releases)
Yep. Gundam Nouvelle, taking inspiration from both the Bertigo, and the manga-only Rasveht Beta which Carris Nautilus pilots in the later stages of Koichi Tokita's adaptation of Gundam X
Though, personally, I will always remember him for this https://open.spotify.com/track/2aYvLmRnTC528PxkoTAxsz?si=175fd8913f65447b
For those wondering, he's the guy you have to blame - or thank - for You Say Run
Oh god, is that Yuki Hayashi
That's certainly Ippei Gyoubu's art, my god
Original or HD Remaster?
I admit, I can't recall any songs off the top of my head by him, but I know the name well
Tis true, that
JAM Project, man!
So the newer NYAV Post English dub, is it? I admit, I have heard neither, but I have seen some opinions on them - and they seem to be divided. I don't know what to expect, personally, because I watched it with JP audio as usual.
I guess you already did the research, though, from the above conversation. You can see for yourself why it was a divisive dub.

Wonder if the Gundam SEED Destiny HD Remaster was as divisive for the dub or not? Took them a good while to get it out, I know that much.
Yeah, the NYAV Post dub was for the HD Remaster release. The original was by Ocean Productions way back in the early 2000's.
Just to explain briefly, MIKADO is basically one of, if not the biggest game centre in Japan. You can see them regularly streaming from multiple channels on YouTube, too
I haven't finished it or Dash yet, but I do like that series a lot because they have Yoko Shimomura as the composer, and also they enlisted the help of MIKADO GAME CENTER to record the gameplay footage for them
And of course, you have Hi-Score Girl as well
cause I notice the Alpha 2 border with Ryu/Akuma
... actually, thinking about it, that may have been recorded from the Street Fighter 30th Anniversary Collection, lmao
Hold the front page, that's literally Street Fighter Alpha 3 on screen there
This has to be the most Feddie post I have seen in a while, I swear
RIP
You can really see it in the official art of the trio from outside this anime
The person who designed the SEGA Hard Girls, or at least illustrated them, was the same person who originally drew Hatsune Miku
I'm kinda sad it's hard to see it, cause I would have loved to
Very few vestiges of the bygone era...
You saying that about the CGI, or the art style?
... well, perhaps that's not exactly relevant to characterisation, per se
which the mangaka seemed to know a lot about
Cause from what I hear, much of it documents arcade culture of the time
Wonder if that's partially because of the way it was originally written
Not surprising, really, considering it's the game that more or less brought all the main characters together
and then the translation on the video is probably from after
Subs maybe made before the single was out (i.e. so we could look at the official lyrics)
Didn't expect *this* when looking for this ED, haha
360 degree MV!!!
https://youtu.be/6gu4L9jkl-k WAIT
Or rather, it was a mistranslation the other way around (the romaji)
Apparently not.
Well, it *does* mention NASA conspiracies...
and the things that would have been relevant, or maybe not, back in the 80's and 90's
Probably to invoke the feelings of youth back at the time that this series takes place
And the mangaka of Hi Score Girl even designed a new mascot for them thanks to their partnership, which they use to this day
The hell is this "Arios Zeta"
Looking at it... I can't see anyone else other than Hajime Katoki having designed the original Huckebein
Thought I just had... It's pure conjecture here, of course, but what if the rights to not-a-gundam Huckebein weren't being disputed within the company, but with the original designers instead? An unlikely scenario, I figure, but that's the only other thing I could think of for why it didn't show up in a lot of SRW until recently.
But at the same time, it reduces the diversity
If you think about it, that cuts down on the amount of animations they need to do if they are pulling out all the stops with everything
Wonder if the issue is that animations are becoming too elaborate?
Ippei Gyoubu be like
Minovsky bullshit and all that.
Normal missiles **don't work** in the world of UC, though. At least, not homing.
I'm fairly sure both Penelope and Xi-G fire off a salvo of them during the climax of the first Hathaway film
You can see the Funnel Missiles in the damn trailers!
Huh?
A bit of a deep cut, huh? I can only assume they're known as "Arios guy" because of being responsible for Arios in the past?
Though unfortunately, we still haven't gotten further word on the not-dead movie...
Really, all that these sorts of conversations do for me is remind me that all I want is for Fukui to have his sweet release from everything
Cross Rays? Hello?
The only thing I know for certain, no matter which rumours are true or not, is that Gundam SEED and Gundam SEED Destiny are rather messy-- also no
Yes, Chiaki Morosawa was Harutoshi Fukui's wife, and together they were scriptwriter and director respectively for Gundam SEED and its sequel.
I'd pin it more on the (long since deceased) scriptwriter more than the director, personally, but that's about all I have to say about the direction that Cosmic Era went
Don't worry, you're not the one who brought it up
I would like to not participate any further if stuff that can't even be properly verified is gonna pollute the conversation
the rumours have entered the conversation
Oh shit, here we go
I can *kinda* get the Anti-Armor Shotgun cause I could explain it as energy pack powering up the railgun stuff, but the other way around? Where the fuck is the energy pack on that Gun Launcher that somehow makes a sniper out of the Beam Rifle it's attached to on the front?
Okay, NONE OF THIS MAKES ANY SENSE TO ME
What's the in-universe explanation for Buster Gundam's arsenal?
God, I just want to play Forza Horizon right now, but this conversation is making me curious
~~Then get the MGEX that's coming~~
Now I'm just remembering Verde Buster's animations in GGCR...
I personally like both Freedom and Strike Freedom, but then again, I've been rather clear in the past with how much I dislike most of Kunio Okawara's work done for Cosmic Era aside from Kira Yamato's mobile suits...
LMAO
Duality of man above
Dude's making a Shin Ultraman *and* Shin Kamen Rider
I was gonna say before you edited, do you even think Anno will ever step back to Evangelion at this rate? lol
To denote their revisions from the theatrical release, probably?
where did I get 3.33 from
Oh, 3.0+1.0, damnit
Or am I tripping for the Rebuild of Evangelion film progression
No, wasn't it 1.01, 2.22, 3.0 and then 3.33 as the final film?
Also, that meant that they (the Shinkalion production team) ended up as a sponsor for Evangelion 3.33, right?
Japanese culture moment?
Which is how I solidified my decision to watch the source material
GBF was also my gateway to the greater world, and at least for me, shows like that work to make me curious about what all the references are
I admittedly have less interest in it thanks to the absolute state of its rating on MAL or whatever
I should have watched sooner
Okay, nobody told me there was a Mick segment in FUUTO PI
Yoshimasa Hosoya's doing great as the new Shotaro, I gotta say
I mean, it can happen. If they disapprove of the end result, they may not like the idea of a continuation
All the present-day action has been out of suit thus far
Which I think is fine-ish cause we only *just* got to it, lol
... strangely enough, I can apply that very same property to many of the music videos of Tokyo Mirage Sessions #FE, since they (Nintendo & ATLUS) also cooperated with avex on that
That's what you get when you have Avex bringing in their dance coordinators
This is probably one of the more odd but also amusing instances of role reprisal I've seen
Also, huh. Apparently Mick's voice in Fuuto PI is Yasuhiro Takato, who ||also provided his vocals to the Smilodon Dopant|| back in W
I can never get over his narration and system voice
I'm glad they brought Fumihiko Tachiki back, though
I only say that because several of the CVs from that game who portrayed characters from Double return to reprise their roles for Fuuto PI
Also, I wonder if KAMEN RIDER: memory of heroez was really a test for the voices of the Double cast present within it? lol
Actually, I must ask on that note... Do they ever ||mention Begins Night itself in the manga version of FUUTO PI?||
since then they're left wondering, ||"When does the Narumi Detective Agency get their cat?" as said cat proceeds to *attack them*||
Could be a bit shocking for those who watch FUUTO PI first, followed by Kamen Rider Double
The fact that ||Mick used to belong to the Sonozaki Family and had a Gaia Memory of his own||
... you know, I think the funny thing is that ||I don't think Fuuto PI has made mention of that thus far||
I'll concur with the others. You can pick it up without knowing anything about the original series, at least from what's been released thus far. There's a ton of fanservice, though, so if you do find interest in the original, I'd highly recommend it - it's one of my favourite Rider series out there
IDEK what's going on since I mostly just watched the OG short from way back, haha
Now Netflix has picked it up, and they seem to be doing a hard reset, and appear to actually be going with some Season 2 plot... Or so I read.
So the OG short was already adapted, but for the longest time, it was stuck in dev hell after the first season, apparently. Then Season 2 got leaked but never officially released.
Oh, it seems there's actually been a bit of... strange history surrounding this new Bee and Puppycat
As a fan of the original short, I can dig this
It's always a different studio to... who was it? ShoPro? Anyway, the peeps who make AniPok√©
Cause it seems like they will always do so for special animations - whether it be special trailers like the one for B2W2 way back, or short series like Generations
They'd probably hire a different studio at that point, which I guess wasn't the case with that
*Fair enough, then.*
With a side order of booba?
literally, the only seasonal I'm watching right now is FUUTO PI, and that's cause it's Kamen Rider Double but anime
cute girls doing cute things
I'm not much of a seasonal anime kind of person, but even I can see why
and I realised, oh god, this went *all in* on responding to the now as Char
then I clicked on the profile, saw their front page
the other two messages in the thread are Char speaking, which threw me off for a moment
the damn thing really is as it says - Char tweets
Actually, on the note of the tweet that sparked this whole conversation
In either case, conjecture is all we can do until we see someone post the full details
The key people within the new merged studios may be more important than the general work of their previous studio, but that's just me
I wonder if staff themselves were shuffled around into different studios in general
Actually, on that note
at least, it seems that way judging by G-Witch's staff
If I were to guess, Studios 1, 3 and SUNRISE BEYOND are probably all together now
Wonder what it means for their in-betweens, though
Mmm.
You say that, but isn't there literally a picture of Char next to a picture of a character from Love Live as part of White Base's art pieces?
cause dear god, there's a stupid ton of studios within BNFW
I'd definitely like to see the specifics of the studio merges at some point, see if they grouped 'em together based on past works, current staff or whatever
That'd explain it
It's just no longer the company's name
And they haven't *removed* the name "Sunrise" entirely
Hold the phone, though, where even is the news articles mentioning the studios being merged?
I can get the case with some of 'em, but every studio within that building? Hmm.
Did they actually? Hmm...
fairly sure they moved just about everyone
And besides, they *all* moved into the new building
Is that really how you have to look at it?
the whole restructure with Bandai Namco Filmworks involved getting much of their animation talent into the same building
I mean, I'm not surprised that it happened
(Not to be confused with White Base from the Gundam franchise)
Huh. Guess that's what happens when y'all move into White Base
One being the fact that ||you have the series start to slide the scale from real robot to super robot towards the end||
Cross Ange is certainly curious, in more ways than one
Gotcha.
making it the goated ONE anime adaptation
which I hear was also doubly unfortunate because Mob Psycho 100 II was airing pretty close to it
I hear One Punch Man Season 2 was rather divisive
Wonder who'll be behind it
I won't even get to see this damn service until 2023
https://tenor.com/view/skill-issue-wangan-midnight-porsche-devil-z-blackbird-gif-26265944
It is for this reason why I am a Wangan Midnight loyalist more than I am an Initial D one
who basically singlehandedly ruined the reputation of the R33 when it came to the GT-R lineage
The former really comes to a head in this series, and the latter is mostly to do with Kozo Hoshino
IMO, some of Fourth Stage is the peak of Initial D for me. But at the same time, it highlights two things I really, really hate about the franchise - the author saying "fuck romance" and "the BCNR33 is a piece of shit"
What this conversation has made me realise is just how much of a love-hate relationship I have with Fourth Stage
Can't deny that, heh
~~though I don't like the underlying theme of YOU CAN'T GET LAID IF YOU RACE THE MOUNTAINS~~
... and yeah, for anyone who has not seen Initial D, believe it or not there is a lot of plot beyond the racing
Those three, though? Nope. Nada.
At least the majority of the rest make some sort of sense...
only to see him refer to "Ry" as his longtime rival
God, imagine the hell we would live in if you were to get up to the fucking Shinigami arc in Fifth Stage
For one of the most important characters in the entire story, a name like Ry is...
RY oh my lord
It has been so long, I don't remember any of the Tokyopop dub/IDAS names other than Tak and K.T.
I never even thought about that - a worse-than-4kids dub taking on the whole shebang with Natsuki
Now I am DOUBLY curious
OH GOD
It's little wonder why Funimation did a whole redub
So you'd hear things like Tak and K.T.
Fun fact, either the Initial D Arcade Stage games came up with nicknames for all the characters, or the Tokyopop dub introduced them, but either way, one was the origin and the other took them and used them
The library still exists, but given how long it has been, I wonder if they even still have them...
I used to borrow em all the time
They were part of a friggin' library, those DVDs
Localised opening and everything
I used to watch DVDs of the old Initial D dub, my god
I don't know if anyone in any server you're in is enough of a dick to try and do so deliberately towards someone who's holding off
Well, I only say that just out of caution, lol
and at the same time risk being spoiled by everyone else
Lycoreco game adaptation, the next stranding game from Kojima Productions
Is that Kojima talking about Lycoreco?
Wait
Yeah, I feel like there's definitely "eras" of animation, though this current one may be hard to top
Fairly sure Mitsuo Fukuda was also involved, so Ange is basically Cagali if she was voiced by Fate Testarossa
||SET UP!||
also, LMAO at the Hard-Boiled Delusion Diary for FUUTO PI E4
I do, because it's the one where ||Ange makes a new ally in another dimension||
Ah yeah, this one... I may rewatch Cross Ange just for this
looking like the Hacker or Agent class from 7TH DRAGON there
The worldbuilding for this series shows, particularly now that there is a different character to explain it all to as an audience surrogate, new to Fuuto City and the World of Double
That's actually something I really liked about Episode 4. Really reinforces the fact that FUUTO PI was written in a way so that even new fans could enjoy it without being alienated by required knowledge
Of all those anime, I've only seen three of them - Kemono Friends, Symphogear, and GOSICK
Either way, let's see what I got on there...
I was gonna ask, uh, is the bingo the 99% or the 1%
For those wondering why, I get easily upset at conversations like this. It's just a me thing, don't worry about it
I think this may be a good cue for me to leave...
And previously, they ran for 40-50 episodes uninterrupted, until Gundam 00 which had 2 seasons of 25
And a new season of the same series is about the same length
Long story short, most Gundam TV/ONA series these days are around 24-26 episodes long
Then does that mean most Gundam series are four seasons?
That doesn't sound good for longevity, heh
Oh dear
Probably also cause someone else might have already sniped G_Witch or it just can't be made into a handle because of it being too simple
Could be that, too, yeah
Think the M part at the end of the handle is supposed to be MBS...? But I'm not sure, lol
Even if we don't get to properly find out what the hell is going on, it'll alert people in the know
At the same time, they do have enough of an international presence that they will use a hashtag with all English letters
Greatest Lexus ever built, IMO
https://tenor.com/bKyCx.gif
Holy shit, that's a Lexus LFA
I don't care if it's in the original JP script or if it is Crunchyroll sub shenanigans, dude is fucking disgusting
Why the hell is he constantly going "suck my sword"?
which brings me to my question about the current arc
~~so how does NECO-ARC fit into all this~~
All I can tell is that it's TYPE-MOON copyright and that is definitely Archetype: Earth
Tsukihime, I think?
The world continues to change, and so do working conditions
As I said, probably a production/workflow thing that may or may not have been brought on by the pandemic
Funnily enough, on the note of splitting up a series into two, Gundam itself actually did this with Gundam Build Divers Re:RISE, but appropriately had story beats split into two seasons and called them as such (each season being 13 episodes, with a break in the middle... then several COVID related delays during Season 2)
And who knows, the ending of the first half may not be something they consider a fitting way to end a season
They just split it up because they can't work on all of it at once
Chances are, the season may have been planned out already
I reckon the major reason why seasons are divided into two parts these days is because of workload and/or restrictions
A "season" for a given anime greatly varies these days depending on the IP
If I'm being perfectly honest, I think it's dangerous for me to converse about GBF these days, heh
I dislike that sort of pettiness, personally, but fair enough
The worst series that was followed up with the best series, don't @ me
Though the series itself experienced quite a bit of issues before and during Season 2, thanks to it being the beginning of the pandemic
Cour+1 (13 episodes) for each individual season, totalling 26 episodes
By technicality, Gundam Build Divers Re:RISE was
You'll have to be careful, I reckon. If it's like any other Gundam series you're gonna be waiting a while before you can binge the whole thing at once, and even then there's likely to be a second season
https://tenor.com/btio2.gif
Koki Uchiyama about to put in a lotta work for next episode
Maybe? Rider Time: Kamen Rider Ryuki had a homosexual couple duking it out in the new Rider War...
You always had to in Gunpla Battle, IIRC
could be kickin' up the magma
It's a ground wave, not fire
Heh, wonder how you would have felt with GBD:R when it (MASSIVE spoilers) ||turned into real Gundam and had a colony laser annihilate an entire city||
Some absolutely crazy shots throughout
One bit that does remain consistent throughout all four series, though, is the animation
https://tenor.com/boRY0.gif
... and at the same time, also doesn't, when you see some of the crazy story beats that had never been explored in any other Gundam Build Series beforehand
That's why nobody was expecting it to be as good as it was, though when one realises they brought in the scriptwriter from the Gundam Unicorn OVAs for it, it made sense in hindsight
Trust me, there was a lot of that scepticism surrounding GBD:R when it was airing, too
Probably cause all of that came from the first series
and a contender to rival the original GBF, in my opinion (which to be honest, I place GBD:R above it)
The only other thing I can say is that its sequel series is *so much better*
It's polarising, that's for sure. I myself did not mind as much as many others did.
I mean, I liked the 3v3 format, personally, but I can't blame you for the character thing, lol
Damn, hope you enjoy waiting for about 2 years then
Even though I'm one of them
It's getting to the point where I'm starting to become disillusioned with how much people revere that series
https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/gundam/images/d/d0/Bw-ksee-novel.gif/revision/latest?cb=20101026080114 Novel design, for reference.
https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/gundam/images/b/b3/Rx-105-ka.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20100425121052 More than this?
... especially good in relation to the GFF design for this thing which is just... *eugh*
Mechanical detail and structure ~~ready for Gunpla engineering~~ by Hajime Katoki, overall design and staying true to the original thanks to Seiichi Nakatani
https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/gundam/images/1/11/Xi_gundam_anime_front_HQ.png/revision/latest?cb=20201112115233
tbh that's why I appreciate that Hathaway's design for Xi Gundam was done by two people
Katoki art from around the time of stuff like this is... homologous, that's for sure
We've never gotten a proper kit of the Perfect Gundam III, closest we can get is the Amazing Red Warrior from the HGBF line
More or less. And special shoulders.
Perfect Gundam III's just heavily evolved from the previous Perfect Gundams
Still based on the OG Gundam, I think
Mostly a Japanese thing, really, but I think they started to spread the G- abbreviations more overseas nowadays. Usually it's with the twitter handle and/or associated hashtags https://twitter.com/g_tekketsu?lang=en
Force of habit combined with being a stickler for the abbreviations, more or less
A lot of Gundam these days is abbreviated like this
like how Reconguista in G is "G-Reco"
as in "Tekketsu no Orphans"
G-Tekketsu = official abbreviation of IRON-BLOODED ORPHANS
Including the previous main series, G-Tekketsu
I imagine that G-Witch will be hand-drawn by the Beyond alumni for the most part because it's the way that Gundam TV series have been animated for a good while now, save for a few examples
I still need to finish it, but, uh, shit got real weird during the second part
I mean, I do, lol
Which explains a lot about why the staff have a lot of people from all over (names from Studio 1, Beyond and others within Sunrise)
Supposedly, the studios over at Bandai Namco Filmworks have actually been reorganised since the move into White Base
Well, don't blame those at Sunrise, blame the guy who composed it
PFFFFFFFF
Studio 1 of the former Sunrise did things such as Gundam Unicorn and Hathaway
I'm not sure if it's "company policy" more than it is just the way the studios prefer to animate their stuff
Rather than hand-drawing their mecha fights
Fair enough, though I was thinking moreso about how a lot of Gundam series these days have a lot of CG use
Studio 1, IIRC
That was an entirely different studio, though...
Cause that's the primary thing with all the Gundam Build series (and basically everything with SUNRISE BEYOND)
Is it the budget, or is it because the whole thing's hand-drawn?
Yep. The whole bit about ||not even realising everything was real to begin with||
It's just that Lucas Nemesis is the only one who has to worry about that in any significant capacity before the final battle because of the fact that his Gunpla consumed it at such a high rate
cause apparently Unicorn was *always* supposed to be anime
No shot, I reckon
Probably cause it's the "ple" from "people"
Now you've got me curious on some of the scenes with Ple Twelve in the Gundam Unicorn English dub to see how they went about it there
Seems like it's hard to clarify for sure... There seems to always be twelve of them in artwork, but searching up quickly does not point out for me whether or not they were the only ones
So it would have been past OVA Gundam Unicorn's beginning that we'd have known about the official romanisation of the name
But when I looked to see where this came from, I think it's from something that's been published since 2011
Hmm... You may be right. I can only guess they always intended for it to be "Elpeo Ple" but the localisation didn't catch it. I figured I may as well try and find out, cause I know this page exists https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/gundam/images/3/3c/Img_1216673_37920800_0.jpeg/revision/latest?cb=20120215124351
And now you know why Elpeo Ple is probably one of the first to really spread it through animation
Kinda makes me want to see if there are any publications which had it earlier
Not any time beforehand? Hmm.
Okay, uh... You probably don't want to know that, Aya
Didn't think I'd see a mention of--
*1979 Tomino would like to know your location*
https://i.ebayimg.com/images/g/cMwAAOSwQrpf5GD6/s-l500.jpg
The one Super Sentai series to take from Power Rangers, rather than the other way around
... and yes, you heard me right, **MegaZord**
These are MegaZord designs from Tokumei Sentai Go-Busters
I did not realise that he was actually responsible for *these*
https://s.yimg.com/aah/animebooks-com/yasuhiro-moriki-design-works-robot-and-hero-art-book-27.gif
Particularly from tokusatsu
I'm seeing some stuff I recognise from other places upon searching up his name (Yasuhiro Moriki, for those wondering)
A lot of his design work seems to be for other things, rather than Gundam
I can tell you right now, it's not Okawara
I mean, there are multiple "Gundam guys", lol
The shape of Xi-G in the Hathaway films sticks closer to this
popular special edition for every Gunpla kit of First Gundam, that one
or Char getting his own Gundam (which is where the RX-78/C.A. Casval's Gundam comes from)
things like the Titans forming *way* earlier
There's various things that can happen within them
latest and last was on PSP, if I'm not mistaken
and it's a strategy game series
For those wondering, it's the series known as *Mobile Suit Gundam: Gihren's Greed*
~~there is an entire game series about the lengths that mofo will go to, isn't there~~
As much as I'd like to find out, though, I think I'll head to bed now
I wonder how much the way I perceive the charter and its significance differs from everyone else
Well, have you *seen* the security systems at Maganallica?
Or something like that...
I mean, they did basically cut a deal with the Federation to enjoy status and wealth for nearly a century
Of course, I could just be talking out of my arse here, and I doubt we'll ever know for certain
Backstories included
I mean, fair enough, but like, I imagine a lot of the base stuff would remain the same
I will say, I mostly mentioned it cause I felt like if that's the way it was written back in the novel, there wasn't gonna be too much change IMO, knowing what the author wanted to do with the work
~~Think that has a better chance than Crossbone?~~
Whether or not the fans appreciate it...
Unicorn was what changed everything for Gundam novels and manga
Definitely atypical of most Gundam expanded universe works at the time, though
Mind you, I may be paraphrasing it weirdly, but if I'm not mistaken, it's something from the original author where he mentions that he made Gundam Unicorn with the intention to turn it into animation
I remember reading up about that a while back
Those who have seen the series will know that it is tied to the secondary gimmick of that kit (||Re:Rising Gundam||)
I do not remember if GBD:R also had it on the exact last episode, though I do know the episode prior was the time they *finally* released Gundam Aegis Knight, despite teasing it for the entire season (and having it appear in full since Episode 21)
Still, last episode, new merch
Crossbone Gundam Maoh, Kamiki Burning Gundam, AGE-II Magnum SV...
That's Gunpla for you, lol
You just never see any other than ||Hashmal|| outside of crossover titles (wheir their abilities have to be balanced for gameplay)
Not that I'm about to disagree with the concept, personally - I believe that enough sustained fire ||from beams|| would eventually wear down the Nanolaminate Armor paint
Wonder why that out of the blue? lol
Leopard Da Vinci, right?
And considering Gundam likes to kill off characters in a relationship on the regular, things could end up badly for one of the two anyway
She friggin' ||interfaced with a mobile suit at the age of four, took out several enemies using tech that took supercomputers or highly evolved spatial awareness to even control without even realising that she pulled the goddamn trigger, and did all this on a birthday which probably will scar her once the repressed memories resurface|| (G-Witch PROLOGUE spoilers)
Well, considering what she does in the prologue, I'm not sure if I would take a statement like this lightly...
God help us if it was western
At least it appears to be a Japanese production
ZERO? Oh god
Honestly, we don't know either. It's just a trait that carried over from Kamen Rider Double
and subsequently started imagining a Star Wars action RPG in that style
I won't lie, I got thrown the heck off by the name and thought it was a Tales Of game
Video versions tend to go for as long as this GIF, though
Usually cause it's cut off before it enters, haha
Cause it was a SUNRISE/LEVEL-5 collab, but that's the simplest explanation and it doesn't help, does it...
ngl, Advent: One-Winged Angel started playing in my head when I read that
Are there any instances where they actually use the synthesiser for speech? I only ask because I know that in SRW's case, Fei-Yen Type HD was Saki Fujita made to sound like her robotic self, not the other way around
It's literally exactly like with Fei-Yen Type HD in SRW UX
It wouldn't be right to have a Miku voiced by anyone other than Saki Fujita, lol
Which begs the question of why they didn't mention as such in the first place... lol
I dunno who that assistant was, but I know Hatsune Miku ain't it
I was gonna ask, too, I did not hear Aoi Yuki at all in that
Oh, Aoi Yuki? Well, there's a reason for that, innit
Which one?
It was sheer coincidence that I found out that Z of the Recapture is apparently going to be a thing... though it's been a good while since we heard anything about it
I didn't give a damn about what everyone else thought of it
I mostly wanted to watch the film trilogy just cause I wanted to watch the film trilogy
The ones I'm talking about are the movie compilation trilogy, which is then followed up by Lelouch of the Re;surrection
For Code Geass?
For me, this discussion begs the question I've been wondering ever since I finished the Code Geass movie quadrilogy, and that's how one might explain the upcoming Z of the Recapture if they didn't watch said films, though I admit I only say this because supposedly that upcoming sequel series is confirmed to take place after Re;surrection specifically
Granted, the in-between of what actually happens before we reach the beginning of the film is never explained in the film itself... which apparently involves Shirley recovering Lelouch's corpse and sending it to C.C., who then manages to restore his body but not his mind
Even if you try to pick up all the pieces just based on the synopsis and the differences you see in Re;surrection, that *one* change in Code Geass III is a huge divide in the story as it's the only reason Re;surrection happens in the first place
the end of the third film shows that compared to her TV self, C.C. doesn't accept Lelouch's fate
Which would beg the question of why the fuck is she trying to resurrect Lelouch in that film
She accepts Lelouch's death in the TV series and continues living without him
I don't have the time to argue about this
But whatever
How the hell do you explain C.C.'s motivation, though?
I mean, hey, I didn't pay too much attention to it. I only ever saw the films + Re;surrection cause I wanted to follow the continuity which led to the latter
There were some new cuts due to altered plot, but several of them remained the same between TV and movie IIRC
They did a thing for Pok√©mon not too long ago, I think
... which then spiralled into a conversation about Saki Fujita because we were confused earlier
Basically it was a brief discussion earlier in this channel, like yesterday or maybe the day before?
... to which I say, is that anything new in the industry?
Well, someone did mention it a little while back, but only to complain about how Aoi Yuki's everywhere, lol
tbh I already am
I should probably stop, anyway, because I feel like I'd get unnecessarily upset at this discussion
Well, shoot. I don't have access to any of the footage right now, so I can't check anyway...
I don't want to have to go through the entire series just to see what you're talking about
God, though
Even if they're only minor
No difference in the text? I feel like there had to have been
And... Uh...
If I'm being honest, I forgot that the footage was the point you were talking about above
Oh, hey, GAMERS. That's Broccoli's chain there
Got him into the spotlight, PlatinumGames back into the green, and for both became the most successful game they have ever done
How could he - and everyone else - not? The game literally saved his arse, and that of PlatinumGames
I'm glad they did that promotional with IMO one of NieR:Automata's greatest songs
Oh, that one has Ippei Gyobu written all over it
Ah, the good ol' "Happy Ending Override" trope
Given the apparent restructure of Bandai Namco Filmworks, I wouldn't be surprised if the season split is because of that
Go figure, though, with Thunderbolt... It has been an ONA, then a movie, and now TV compilation
It happened this way for Gundam Build Divers Re:RISE during its airing, so I cannot say I'm all that surprised
And... Well, I can't help but shed a tear at the end because of what the film represents. As Yasuhiko's final work, I gave him - and Toru Furuya's potential final performance as 16 year old Amuro Ray - one final salute, to thank them both for their work over the years bringing Gundam to life.
Though, despite what I may say about the plot being relatively low key... I think that's okay. As Director Yoshikazu Yasuhiko puts it, First Gundam was always about "the little people in the war", and I believe very thoroughly that this film encapsulates the spirit of the original anime throughout.
Man... This one hits me in the feels, maybe less for the plot and more for the nostalgia trip it takes me on, with nods to the events of First Gundam strewn about, particularly to the phantom episode the film adapts - in both obvious and more veiled instances.
Finished watching Mobile Suit Gundam: Cucuruz Doan's Island, a day after its Australian premiere
Honestly, I feel like this is better than if they would be forced to change it *after* disaster
I can't say I enjoy an Orwellian horror either, but when did it become the trendy thing to refer to it?
Is this the default response to any change of this nature these days?
I can let you know if it applies to me over here
Parts of Oceania, too
Especially if the delay happens to affect GUNDAM CHANNEL as well (which, while few and far between, has happened - and meant that the premiere for both was delayed by half or a full hour)
Doubt it. Also wouldn't be the first time it has happened to Gundam with a new series
That's how it normally works, anyway
Yeah, the website should be using the uploads from their own channel.
<@152896851660505088> Oh, I didn't realise the novel itself was released... I'm glad about that because I was wondering if we would ever get to see it
Dunno if they'll be as smart ||or as old in some cases|| compared to those from 00, but they seem to be capable of doing many different tasks
I will say, I appreciate this element of the series: Haros seem to be kinda like their Anno Domini counterparts
JNTHED bringing us the *goods*
G-Witch Episode 1 end slate ||https://twitter.com/G_Witch_M/status/1576488725801902080?s=20&t=HfXe8lVvB29_znw0e1IKrg||
... honestly, that revelation would explain a lot about why G-Witch has a female protag
next episode title seems to suggest ||talking about the GUND Format|| as far as I could tell
I'd say, personally, the pieces are there now. Probably room for more, but now that the series has officially begun, I'd say it's time to start seeing those threads tied together
Mmm, only so much you can do in 24 minutes of runtime
Well, did you watch the prologue? If I may ask
I don't give a damn if the only character in this entire OP is Suletta, this needs to be the OP
Bandai Namco Filmworks literally went through the effort to make it, I can't imagine they will waste it
At the same time, there's a clear gap where they can insert the series logo
Makes me kinda worried that they won't use the MV visuals for the OP proper once Episode 2 rolls around
Wonder if they do have an ED prepped, then
Ah, wait, I just read the katakana on the MV that says "opening theme"
Was it mentioned as the opening anywhere? I forget.
I personally think it'll stick; they have not yet announced an ED
Or do you think it's Episode 1 magic?
And do you think it'll actually be like that for the entire run? An ED?
I will say, the MV for The Blessing definitely seems like what I'd expect out of a YOASOBI video
cause their modus vivendi is "novel into music"
It makes me wonder about other OPs for anime that they have done, actually
I knew this cause it was mentioned when they revealed The Blessing for the first time, since without it, YOASOBI can't do their thing
This ain't a Sunrise Beyond series, that's for sure
Honestly, it felt like a lot of the 3DCG this episode was just this one MS, lmao
more importantly it's a Kanetake Ebikawa design
was *everywhere*
This thing
https://twitter.com/KANETAKE/status/1576489233639841793?s=20&t=AlghFrCQ-cJ7dkIcPAXeVw On the note of CG mecha
... one of them being the secondary protagonist
seems the main cast only has two non-pilots as of Episode 1
Agreed about the way it looks, though. The shading's fantastic and makes everything blend real well.
I could, but that's probably because I've got an eye for it, and I've seen enough of both works to be able to know
seeing some of that former Studio 1 style and the 3DCG associated with them mixed in with Beyond hand drawn moments
There's a hella mix of animation
TMS Entertainment, huh
(such as Riku Sanjo, due to his Kamen Rider work being some of my absolute favourite, Fuuto PI included)
unless it's someone whose work I committed to memory
I'm not very good with staff identification, heh
~~Loath as I am to promote the ones that are gatekeeping watching G-Witch for an otherwise completely unrelated reason~~
and making jokes, memes, comparisons and otherwise
Either way, basically everyone's going "this is Utena but Gundam"
Oh, right, Okouchi is the scriptwriter for G-Witch
I don't think Okouchi was the one who handled the Utena anime series
Basically, a lot of similarities, apparently. On top of that, the director of G-Witch apparently worked on light novels for Utena in the past
there's no two ways about it; ||Guel is visibly hurting from his behind||
Before I forget to mention it... I think the thing that really got me with G-Witch Episode 1 was the fact that ||Suletta delivered her slap to Guel's *butt*||
https://twitter.com/NGICHHR/status/1576532287503507456?s=20&t=wl1UYi15wRdJxhGqJRMfNg Emblem design
sticking it out with her, through a cursed existence
Which I guess is why the song's called "The Blessing"
I bring this up cause, my god, Ippei Gyoubu designs are ALWAYS full of detail
I find it kinda amusing that when you look at enough anime key art for mecha series, you start to pick out who designed what based entirely on the lineart
A face to the one-woman wail we've been hearing in the trailer, and now the end of Episode 1
https://twitter.com/takashi_ohmama/status/1576499461408247809?s=20&t=HfXe8lVvB29_znw0e1IKrg
lmao
Considering the LycoReco ED has become a meme in and of itself, this isn't surprising
Honestly I'm kinda waiting for this to happen, lmao
Spicy, spicy take... https://twitter.com/Gadyuka86F/status/1576516492836753409
Godspeed, Yoshikazu Yasuhiko...
... I should also secure my G-Doan BD soon
now to inevitably wait in pain for the G-Witch soundtrack (cause I want those one-woman wails)
I also got to see G-Doan last week
I'd love to see that myself, haha
I don't know if they'll be the same here, but I'd honestly bow to them too, knowing what they were capable of in Anno Domini (Gundam 00)
with Masatsugu Saito character design
(which admittedly is the biggest reason why I both watched it and remember it afterwards)
... yeah, seems Ebikawa's designing a lot of round bois for G-Witch, haha
That may be why it looks somewhat different from past Studio 1 works (as well as G-Doan)
a very Studio 1 way of doing it
it's used where it needs to be, and I think that's what matters
I mean, we don't need to point out *every* instance, lol
https://twitter.com/G_Witch_M/status/1576508687799054336?s=20&t=AlghFrCQ-cJ7dkIcPAXeVw Sadly, I don't know if we would have been able to see it (or where it even took place), but they did a thing after the first episode aired
Yep, that was 3DCG for sure
Makes sense, though I think I took note more of the times when it was hand drawn (which was during the duel)
I won't lie, by the way, the fact that they actually said "blade antenna" in the script makes me very happy
Limited, because it has a G-Witch logo base

There are two paths set before every individual. The left, the right...
It's a Gundam staple, almost, to have some sort of colony drop or colony laser that obliterates an entire city. I'd say the odds are in its favour, unless they are wanting to buck the trend. ||Even Gundam Build Divers Re:RISE had one when most thought a Build series never would!||
I think the Japanese title is actually "Suisei no Majo", but ye
https://tenor.com/view/mobilesuitgundamhathaway-gundam-hathawaynoa-gif-22200564
Just the tentative title, Son/Sun of Bright
Screw the haters, Turn A is one of my all time favourites
A unit from Cosmic Era shows up
Five, if you go with the manga version
Literally my first thoughts upon seeing its military application
I won't lie, I wince when looking at this because it got two key things wrong - the name of Advanced Generation, and that no Gundam Build series takes place in the same timeline as each other with the exception of sequels
Dang
cause that was the thought that came to my head, being a Build Fighters stan
Are people calling Suletta/Miorine the Tomato Chronicles
So, uh, random thought
No fucking idea. Never was a Naruto fan myself so I never read or watched it in any significant capacity, and the same goes for Boruto, really
I'm fairly sure that if any animation efforts are happening, they are squarely focused on that - outside of this special anniversary celebration
... and I say this knowing that Boruto is what's currently going on right now
The PV in question should also not be taken for any more than what it is, unless said otherwise
Searched it up, and it seems that in the Japanese context it primarily means "promotional video"
I thought PV stood for "promotional video", not preview
It isn't; Gundam Build Divers Re:RISE did two seasons of 13 episodes each (actually marking them as seasons rather than just "second cour")
... fair point, lmao
Honestly, though, what defines what is and isn't a Gundam... That's usually determined by the work or universe
I see, I see. From the reveal of the Gundam Lfrith mass production models, huh?
Just to clarify, series or units?
The third edit, you mean? Cause surely it wouldn't have been in the first edit
||Implied to be the case|| thanks to the novel, *Cradle of Stars,* and *The Blessing* whose lyrics are based on it
Girl went *full Qubeley on him*
I want to catch the Special Edition if I can
You could say that maybe they only had the resources for exactly 72, but IDK really. All we know is that the rare metal a Gundam Frame is made of is apparently pretty rare
Capitalising on the fear of the White Devil in that case, isn't it?
The ghosts of CE past
I personally just want to see Fukuda released from the chains of the series after so long
We had a bit of a discussion over here about that a few days ago, lmao
I'm probably of the very unpopular (in the west) opinion that Cosmic Era isn't as bad as everyone says it is
The wording of that announcement really gets me, actually, cause it means that the movie is well and truly in production - against all odds, really
Airing reruns of G-Witch, as well as Gundam SEED and Gundam SEED Destiny in the leadup to the new movie
There's also gonna be a Gundam Hour on BS11 in Japan
Yeah, that's what's running in between the two cours
I'd expect 25-26 episodes for both
Two cours, yes. This is the first one, and April will begin the second
Probably not for too long, since it's likely gonna be the central plot point for this cour
Righto...
Assuming the GundamInfo upload is up, anyhow
Definitely watch it. Even if you don't have Crunchyroll and don't sail on the seas, the GundamInfo YouTube channel does have the prologue on there
That's all I can say when it comes to protagonist units being destroyed
... I've been ready ever since the Last Shooting
It's basically how they did GBD:R when it was airing online
in prep for the new film
Oh, this is interesting. Apparently in between the first and second cours of G-Witch, BS11 is gonna not only air reruns of G-Witch, but reruns of Gundam SEED and Gundam SEED Destiny
Two, I think? One airing now, and the other airing next year I think?
my mans here talking sense
even the series where the main protagonist has a kill count of exactly 2 by the end of the series (for those wondering, ||Turn A||) has him threaten to *drop a nuke on the moon and obliterate a city with it*
and it's usually either that or a Colony Laser - or both - once per series
usually a colony drop means an entire city gets obliterated
Why are you sad? That's a *good* thing to not have
Probably no colony drop this season
~~Tragedy, as any Gundam veteran will tell you~~
A G-Witch sequel is far too early to think about, but fan reaction alone I think is a sign of what's to come
it really amazes me
He never once lost faith in the movie

and finally, T.M.Revolution back on his BS after so long
the legacy of his long dead wife
Honestly, I'm kinda wondering if there'll be ||a rebellion led by Elnora Samaya that her own daughter fights against|| (G-Witch)
Even goddamn GBD:R!
Okay. I have heard a LOT of rumours and speculation about Cosmic Era and its production, but *this* is news to me
why not cute girls going into despair
The planned region for GUNDAM.INFO's broadcast was Asia and parts of Oceania
I will admit, it's catchy to hear them say "E-X-A (IKUSA), SOIYA, SOIYA"
I didn't forget about it, though it's not exactly all that high for me - both for Gaim and for the Kamen Rider Girls

YES, THIS
No joke, that is what they were credited as for their contribution to the series, Gaim's OP *"JUST LIVE MORE"*
to Gaim no Kaze
Shonan no Kaze rebranded
Oh, and for Gaim
Oh, and some shit about a forbidden fruit ||which turns you into a space god||
Armour, fruits, and a jidaigeki aesthetic
This? THIS WAS HIS DOING
https://tenor.com/view/kamen-rider-gaim-gif-13480445
Not a cast member, he was the scriptwriter for Gaim
It was also one of the only "Rider War" kind of shows in the franchise, with a ton of Riders from the outset, before they became more common in recent years
Though I only bring this up because it seemed like several of the cast members, as well as Urobuchi himself, were fans of it back in the day
Alternatively, you could watch Kamen Rider Ryuki if you're looking for something a little more classic
That friend is cultured. Gaim's great
though the latter won't be here much longer
Gundam, Super Hero Time, and midnight Fuuto
G-Witch Sunday approaches
oh geez
cause the topic of Masami Obari came up
heck, I think in Gundam Build Divers: Battlogue, you see that
... yeah, you're right
and the shoutout to the Fatal Fury animation is just \*chef's kiss*
Well, it was directed by him, dunno who was actually drawing, but these all look great
... actually, speaking of humans drawn by Obari https://youtu.be/_3rzUgD53h4
(I apologise if that is something I shouldn't have said, but... I thought it couldn't be held back any longer)
OBARI PLEASE
OH MY FUCKING GOD, NOT EVEN THE MECHA ARE IMMUNE TO STIFF NIPPLES
Cause now I'm curious.
Though speaking of those character designs, what *do* they look like?
There is a question I would ask, but I feel that is better reserved for one of the NSFW channels, heh
True, I guess, but I feel like my personal association is mostly with those works, heh
This is reminding me of what I heard about the conversation that got him involved with Pop Team Epic
Apparently he was told to "Bari it up" (by bkub okawa himself, IIRC?) and he was confused as to what that even meant... but got to work anyway
I'd probably be outing myself by admitting that I know firsthand what this is like
Recreation of the slap but with Gunpla... and ||a certain G-Tekketsu moment||

What agenda do they have to say that?
so it should be up at around the same tine
CR should be simulcasting it, as is GUNDAM.INFO
Today, you mean, cause G-Witch is aired every Sunday in Japan. We're 3 hours away from Episode 2
All I can see is ||ulterior motives and a somewhat clever but mediocre disguise||
I have had these suspicions ever since reading the events of the novel (and what it means for the *other* sentient being in the family, ||Gundam Aerial itself||)
It'd probably be up to the GundamInfo or Crunchyroll channels to upload it officially
Most of their stuff is region locked to JP
Well, I get why, it's likely they were uploaded to GUNDAM CHANNEL
https://twitter.com/G_Witch_M/status/1579029650378035201?t=kV78zFMcaUliRjwIpy6GpA&s=19 Twitter has you covered, at least
Funny, considering Aerial is the most sentient mobile suit we have seen short of an SD Gundam World work
I personally just like the concept of the Satellite Cannon - and big boi beams - in general, which is why every time something like it appears in any other Gundam work, I'm always squeeing
I'm more partial to DREAMS, personally. https://open.spotify.com/track/1t4G4RpuTu4NDWNR2NcKP9?si=0b0e762a1f524e09
To be fair, that's *very* evident with Wataru Takagi's recent performances of him these days
so I can get why so many in the West dislike him usurping the role of protagonist once Terminal comes full force into the battle
Albeit, all of that development is more or less over and done with by the end of SEED
Perhaps it diminishes the value of a fight once he enters the battlefield, yes, but IDK. I think I like the dynamic it has when it comes to other characters reacting to him, cause there's a struggle in and of itself with being the best
... technically, Australia *is* on the East but I imagine most think like a West side person
I personally don't mind that aspect of him, though again, I'm probably talking from a perspective closer to how the east sees him
Lord knows what Chiaki Morosawa had planned for us with the movie before she bit the dust... Apparently the script for the movie went through over 100 drafts
<@145705908716961792> So, going off of what we were discussing in <#337805317276565525>, personally I think Jesus Yamato has two advantages: He was ||genetically engineered to be the best||, and his endgame MS in GSD has some precision weaponry tuned specifically for him (not that he wasn't already being ridiculously precise with Full Burst Mode in Freedom, anyhow...). Banagher, it takes some time - and a healthy dose of reality check - for him to truly become an ace. And it's UC... I don't think any amount of writing could have prevented any of the bloodshed on his hands, personally.
What do you think they should have been?
~~it's telling when Strike Freedom has one and they typically restrict its use in video games to special attacks~~
Guess the idea of a belly blaster doesn't really appeal to 'em
Alright, I'm gonna head off
~~oh yeah, ||Mobile Armor Hashmal|| also has a big beam, on that note~~
spoken like someone who grew up in Post Disaster, lmao
https://tenor.com/bLD8T.gif
Just about everything in Anno Domini, actually
with the X Cannon
They did a *dick joke*
I think the most hilarious use of this, actually, is Gundam Build Fighters: Battlogue, and the Gundam X Jumaoh
That is the Helios Sestet Cannon
Psycho Frame power, Freedom cannons on the *hips,* Double Satellite Cannon on the shoulders, and even the Palma Fiocina gets involved

it's why things like Gundam Helios are such appealing designs to me
Still, do you think the OG Crossbone could be done in one film?
... I guess, yeah, perhaps I should have worded that a bit better
Crossbone is a piece of media that I think has grown too big to be adapted in one go
or NANTOOOOOO
No more of his OOOOAAAAAAAA
Sadly, the real voice is dead
so they sorta just paired up everyone and called it a day
X was a weird one, too, cause they had to wrap up real quick once they ran out of budget
Which have traditionally been pretty bad
I admit... I may have been confusing it for Toei's treatment of female Kamen Riders
Oh, wait... Right. Jesus Yamato keeps on winning.
This is especially bad in one series which can be summed up as ||rivals from both sides of the war kill each others' girlfriends||
Yes. Especially if ||two characters are in a relationship; only Gundam Build series have ever gotten away with not shooting them down as permanently star-crossed lovers||
I'm personally betting on ||some deep, dark secret which truly brands her as a witch to explain why she can interface with Aerial to the degree she can, or her mother's plans coming to light. Both seem like situations for PTSD that puts her out of action for a while||
Applied to a weapon, instead of onto the unit
That reminds me of the I-Field Cannon, the signature armament of the Sisquiede
Everyone has their idea of a cool design. I personally like Strike Freedom even though the consensus is a preference for Freedom instead. Some like it understated, some like it overdesigned.
It all depends on what happens next, but at the same time, the institute and the colony it's in is very clearly a place of importance in this series
For me, even that's put into question with G-Witch
As a primary setting, yeah...
I dunno if I'd say the school setting is new, per se. The protagonist of Gundam Unicorn starts off as a student in Anaheim Electronics. What'll be different is if the majority of the first cours takes place in said school, in comparison to the past where a school setting didn't really stick for too long.
That is... pretty strange
So basically the polar opposite, huh
They're the ones responsible for giving us "Tak" in Initial D, aren't they
Explains why I've never seen them
Ah, I see.
and the main one we saw wields a Japanese sword by default
Cool design, BIG SWORDS
The model kits sold like wildfire
Astray sold
Can't even keep up with Aerial sales
Proof's in the pudding, and Nobel Gundam sold
Yeeeeeeep
Only through G Generation, basically
Ah yes, the Amatsu Hana
If G Gen is to be believed, Gold Frame Amaterasu can dual wield Tactical Arms, has Voiture Lumiere straight out of Stargazer, and once you fire a laser onto it, it becomes the fucking Road Runner and zips across space
Also, Gold Frame Amaterasu? STUPID, STUPID THING
from Gundam SEED Astray: Princess of the Sky
Or you could have the co-pilots of Gundam Astray Gold Frame Amaterasu
I think the lack of HGGW Gundam Aerial says everything
apparently he himself proposed the idea of a female protagonist at least once, but was shot down cause they thought it wouldn't sell
I saw an article that saw Koichi Tokita comment on G-Witch
Fair enough, I guess.
We're all in that same boat, since it's the first new TV series in 7 years
You think?
I admit, I feel kinda bad about setting your expectations, cause I don't like influencing people directly, heh
passionate discussions of anything are like this, I think...
I wonder. I truly do wonder. If they do adapt Crossbone... Will the result satisfy?
I think they planned for a trilogy?
I asked mainly cause Hathaway is straight up a film, I'm fairly sure
I'd put bets on OVA, personally. A lot of novels and manga are adapted that way in Gundam these days
compared to the original lineart
it turns out that other kits have it *too big*
but long story short
If you watch the video, you'll find out why
If any kit was gonna do it, it was gonna be a Ver.Ka
Locking mechanisms
Okay, so that's how they want to solve the issue
Can we *finally* get a Zeta Gundam Gunpla that *properly transforms and holds itself together?*
They are giving it a Ver.Ka
https://youtu.be/B5feJedg9FE
Actually, speaking of
It was designed without any regards for it becoming merch
It... really isn't supposed to be
and if I'm being honest, I wouldn't be surprised if all the horror stories about Zeta kits were true. That shit was *not* designed first and foremost to be a toy
At least it has the benefit of not being as crap as the OG Zeta MG was
Such small parts for a transforming structure will surely loosen up both modes at once if you repeatedly do it
Fair enough. I'd still be careful regardless - it is an RG, after all
But over 40 years of Gunpla engineering - and 20 on that specific line - surely has to make a difference over all the transformable Zeta Gundams that came before it
For me, this is probably why I will choose to get the MG Zeta Ver.Ka if I ever do get a Zeta Gundam as Gunpla - albeit, I'll probably wait until it has released to see if its transformation gimmick is all it's talked up to be
Or so, that's what I have heard, anyway.
You pretty much have to buy it twice if you want to display it in Waverider and MS, cause the moment you try to transform them repeatedly it all comes apart - literally
Just be prepared. That thing is fragile and was one of the earliest RGs, so it does not hold a candle to things like the Nu or Sazabi.
20 years of MG Ver.Ka, apparently, so that's why they're going for it. Guess it makes sense as well after they redid Wing Zero EW
Gotta get as much as they can out of the intro to ALL LOVES BLAZING
TBH I wouldn't be surprised if it was fully intentional, but they just never explained why before Morosawa bit the dust
Oh yeah, forgot about that. ||I honestly have no idea why that happens, other than Strike Freedom's Super DRAGOONs being tuned specifically for his use after Terminal stole it. I forget if spatial awareness assists in effective use of a DRAGOON unit that does not require it, though||
There's also only, like, two guys technically who are one and they're ||basically clones of the same mofo|| so what does that imply
I guess maybe I just prefer it when things look like they're properly coordinated
Maybe it's just cause I liked other Astray frames better? That may be it, really... It took me a while to get used to Exia Repair IV's brand new arm, too
IDK what it is exactly that just never jived with me for Amatsu
IDK, the Blitz arm just never vibed with me
tbh the thing I appreciate about the Amaterasu of all Gold Frames is that they finally made it symmetrical again
and the Amatsu Hana is a co-piloted machine
All I remember is that Princess of the Sky involves the main protags, one of which used to be Gai's assistant or whatever, are training to inherit the Sahaku fortune or something like that
His sister, yes
Basically, the co-pilots of Amatsu Hana are being trained to be Mina's successor
All I know is that there's some rare metal plot
Which is basically just a white Mina
Even compared to Lord Astray?
For context, a slightly older version of her is one of the actual pilots of Amatsu Hana, and later Amaterasu
Man... I wish there was a video showing Gold Frame Amaterasu with the pilot being Kazahana Azure
It zips by like it's Sonic the Hedgehog, and does all this for a single bisection on an enemy
Not sure if you'll say that if you see the full animation
VOITURE LUMIERE
TWO TACTICAL ARMS
LOOK AT THIS BS
https://tenor.com/view/astray-amaterasu-amaterasu-astray-gold-frame-gundam-seed-astray-seed-astray-gif-18522827
Is this where I'm thankful Princess of the Sky introduced just new Astrays instead?
people still want Gale Strike kits, though
Librarian Works machines are... weird
all I remember is the change everyone was fuming about where ||Blitz runs into the Schwert Gewehr from Strike, rather than Strike taking the swing||
cause I don't remember many if any errors
Maybe the fact I watched HD Remaster primarily is what affects my view on this
Huh...
It's cause ||Commander's true name is White||
I GET IT, OH MY GOD
Maybe not *coherent,* per se, cause sometimes I like the overdesigned shit
That explains where I recognised the voice.
I mean, this was the universe where the OP regularly featured gainaxing booba of some sort, Flay's in the first series in particular
In any case, off to bed with me
I still haven't finished Sangoku Soketsuden, so I'm quite behind considering how long ago Heroes finished
... and speaking of, I should finish SD Gundam World at some point
If nothing else, this shows you the unhealthy amount of time I have spent on said boards
Admittedly, now that I think about it, there aren't as many that specifically cite SDGF as the reason
Really, the long story short is that I'm being irrationally upset by the repetition of the same opinion of SD Gundam being posted every other topic on both those games' message boards on Steam
G Gen DS, maybe? Albeit, that was mostly cause it remade the entirety of the Monoeye Gundams story
If I'm not being clear enough with how I explain it, then I'm sorry. I'm not very good with summaries (but I'm sure you already knew that)
It's definitely one of those things I get unreasonably upset about for no good reason, heh
If I were to try and diagnose why I get annoyed at those comments, I think it's cause they think the story will be like those SD Gundam animated works, too
In what aspect, exactly?
Rather than the actual animated works or the stories of BB Senshi
I guess maybe it's just that my exposure to SD Gundam has primarily been G Gen and model kits?
Hmm, I'm not sure how to put this, really
Hold on a sec
SD Gundam is an art style, too
but that may be because I have immersed myself into a lot of G Gen
I feel like, for me personally, SD Gundam is much more than just those works
I sorta just abbreviate all the G-Gen games this way if I want to refer to specific entries - GGOW, GGG, GGNEO, stuff like that...
GGCR I have been using since prerelease, cause that's how the official site and social media in Japan abbreviates it
Yeah, apologies if that wasn't clear from the acronyms
That's the main reason it annoys me, really
I dunno if it's just because of who I have seen talk about it or not, or just because I have seen far too many people (troll or not) mention it on both GGCR and SDGBA's Steam boards, but it seems like several SD Gundam detractors always cite SD Gundam Force only (and call it dumb) when neither of those games are like that
The fact that SD Gundam Force is many peoples' first and only SD Gundam experience honestly annoys me, because it skews their perception of SD Gundam as a whole
And for many, was also their only Gundam exposure for a long time
^^^
I question a lot of this because some are obviously more well known than others, and I daresay should be above the surface of the iceberg... And some I wouldn't even put there at all
Kinda curious on some examples, I will admit. I sorta judge everything individually, but there tend to be traits I like that usually depend on the original designer more than anything
Not sure G-Witch would be better for it
That implies the existence of a Byleth-like entity
Why wings in particular?
Wings, though? I'm happy with its hip thrusters, personally
It's getting a bigger backpack next, probably
Yes, more than Freedom, even. It's an opinion I've shared multiple times and I don't care who thinks otherwise
Wish they used that more instead of literally making ZAFT Zeon 1.5
and the GINN
all of it was shit to me, except Kira's stuff
Thank you! I was trying to think of the video cause I haven't seen it but I knew someone did it
60FPS interpolation of a 30FPS opening just makes everything look jank
God, I **hate** those videos
The amount of visual effects on the logo alone are absolutely a prime source of YouTube compression torture
cause it's got the JP logo and the title of the song on the top corners, which I distinctly remember from the Twitter post
It appears that these uploads match the region locked ones posted to GUNDAM CHANNEL
Showing us the BD goods already, huh?
That is NOT the same
OI
Funnily enough, I think the quot&quot; "official" term - or rather, the one approved by Obari himself - is the "Obari Ittoryu"
Either that or 50, all I know is that it cuts two whole episodes out (and integrates some of the scenes from the recaps into other episodes)
making both series 48 episodes long, IIRC?
Cause they basically skip over them entirely in HD Remaster
Was it a recap episode?
Is it even a name in any real world language, I wonder?
Ah. Huh. Can't blame you, I guess, cause it's one letter off
I know the dude may be the literal jock of the cast, but still...
I've been meaning to ask that
Why are you calling him Gruel, by the way?
I was about to say "of course" before realising I was confusing her for Rie Tanaka (who made a name for herself as Lacus Clyne in 2003)
Aha.
... lemme guess, is it Sumipe
if only because my favourite Gundam thing is basically whenever an MS is equipped with a huge fuck you laser
That being said, I think I prefer the lightshow of beams more
Makes it kinda feel a little more... raw, I guess, when the majority of damage is basically done by crushing force and EXTREMELY LOUD sound effects on impact
I dunno if the kinetic weaponry is cooler to me, personally, but I will admit it is gritty and very different to what came before
Ah yes. Makes sense.
Passion for Tekkadan, Barbatos or some combo of those? Unsurprising in any case...
Except Kamille
That Tsubasa shade
DAMN
I wonder if Suletta has to always say "Aerial and I will never lose!" every time she gears up for battle
Thinking that slice of life doesn't exactly have a place on the silver screen? I don't really have an opinion one way or the other, but
Cause they've been doing that with a lot of films (one of which I saw, even)
Maybe they want to do an overseas theatrical release first?
Taking 'em a while to sort out the licensing/distribution? IDK
Ah.
Literally?
... Wat
but my bile fascination desires explanation
to be honest, half the weird names in Zeta Gundam flew over my head
KAMILLE IS A MAN'S NAME
I forgot about 86, lmao
Or rather, to what extent did all the changes BNG's reorganisation affect things
I kinda wonder, on that note, if the chaos of G-Witch staff is partially due to the circumstances of having moved into a new building during pre-production
VFX is definitely very important, for sure...
I assume you mean special effects
SFX? I curse how I mostly assume it means "sound effects"
Ah.
DoP?
This is just my opinion, but the level of effort that Bandai Namco Filmworks has put into G-Witch's look is basically theatrical quality
all the crazy shading and effects and shit, I mean
One thing I kinda do worry about with the quality of the animation is *why* they wanted it to look like that in the first place
Took a shower, now it is. Probably about 15 minutes ago if I were to guess
Probably won't be watching the episode 'til midnight where I am, cause I may as well do other stuff and just check later
Seems your first guess was closer to the truth
I haven't gotten myself a VPN yet, and while I would like one... other costs take priority for the time being
(for the record, no, I am not in the part of Oceania that GundamInfo's YT channel distributes the series to)
Wish I could catch it, but CR AIN'T UPDATING
Even though I know more than just Ebikawa and Yanase were involved
00 just has that look to it, I swear
Apparently the counterpart song for the single, Mercury, will also premiere soon
Last thing I'll post before eating, ED official music video dropped last night https://youtu.be/n-fKt6uyQZM
So you think the Heavy armour is a possible add-on after all?
Well, I guess I only say G-Tekketsu due to the fact that a lot of Ippei Gyoubu designs that he has drawn art of in this style were from there
Depends on if they wish to rerelease it with the colour variation, I guess.
oh geez, there is so much more art dump I haven't seen, I'll probably drop more later in <#336297674707828747>
https://twitter.com/ippeigyoubu/status/1584105779652485120?t=DnU_WEVm3OkCJfxjqrZP3A&s=19
the G-Tekketsu influence is real, I swear
This ad campaign
https://twitter.com/HobbySite/status/1584099809014726656?t=3pXoVoTWB5lC2yZ7Kob98g&s=19
Spelt "Wataru Inada" in some sites, from what I searched. Go figure
Ah, I see, credited as Wataru Inata
Hold, though, what did the English site credit him as? lol
https://twitter.com/inaba_koh/status/1584115815888015361?t=kyHGdDQC3l6ONdqKCf9zOg&s=19
Yep, it's Koh Inaba all right. Seems everyone was screaming "This is totally AC" when they saw it
But if you close your eyes...
(My apologies for the cluttered rambles, by the way. I cleaned it up a bit before leaving.)
Wait. Not quite what I thought for the heels... Never mind
https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/gundam/images/3/3b/%CE%9D-Zeon_Gundam_%28Front%29.png/revision/latest?cb=20190825075213
It has the Gyoubu high heels (which, yes, pissed people off again), and the shading style was deliberately made to look like it came out of a comic due to the nature of its pilot
Just had a random thought. The one design that DOES have all that, even in its anime key art, is Nu-Zeon Gundam
I think this is why I appreciate it when the main protagonist ends up getting their own Gundam designed by someone completely different from the norm, to help it stand out
Finding the balance can be difficult, between the Gunpla requirement and how people feel about various mechanical designers
Some do like the chunk, though
Same here tbh
I think it's mostly a thing associated with the way more recent designers have designed their stuff, rather than adhering to older looks
Indeed, heh
I sorta just came to expect that Gyoubu puts heels on many of his designs as a trait of his cause those are what I remembered more
Still, though, they ain't the Sazabi flats
Just checked the Astaroth myself, yeah. Flatter feet than I recalled
Kimaris Vidar, the Nu Gundam redesign, I'm sure I could come up with more. Think Astaroth, even
pissed off some fans for it
You sure about that? He added heels to a Sazabi prototype
That is an Ippei Gyoubu design in a nutshell
High heels, minimalist three-tone shading, and a hard-on for lining impossible on an actual model kit
That he do
Ye
Outside of that, yes, CR is the primary way
Asia and parts of Oceania, you can catch it on GundamInfo's official YT channel
They dropped an actual teaser for it, IIRC
I am 100% on that boat, tbh
IMO, basically a malevolent Quattro type
between her methods, and her appearance
I dunno, considering ||Elnora Samaya wants revenge on Delling|| I think I have every reason to believe she is a Char
Lady Prospera is the Char clone
also, TV Tropes just pointed out something rather important I didn't even think about
friggin' Natsuki Hanae, man
https://twitter.com/syou0069/status/1579029480869625857?s=20&t=cRPGTcWgelosbO7MVbRJ1A cho ninki seiyuu da
I guess I need to watch Macross Delta now, huh
It's the anime where Tails built a spaceship and called it the Tornado-X, isn't it?
so you get the fucking Hironobu Kageyama OP
The original Japanese version, at that
Might also be the availability of the voices, who knows
They'd have to have paid a lot of money for this, I'm sure
but holy shit
I meant about the animator stuff, not the voice actors, lol
I have reason to believe otherwise considering Millhi's comments... lol
which leads me to conclude: Chuchu's mouse hair is probably very hard to maintain because it'll be soft
Apparently it's as simple as this https://twitter.com/ebino_tobigeri/status/1584178970362187777?s=20&t=mOkwQHkuTuHSgm2rHAZ6Ag
Been seeing this posted in another server I'm in, lol
https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/335763997431300096/1026475147005280257/dorkr.gif
Honestly, fair enough
So you think Suletta's still top dog in that regard, huh?
I wonder if Chuchu's the biggest fountain of memes thus far for G-Witch
And just to clarify, what do you mean by folds?
What year was this?
With all that in mind, I'm gonna go to bed thinking about the amazing SennaRin opening for Conflict and Intrigue (dust)
Third film of *Intrigue* is in November, I think
Latest season of Die Neue These is still ongoing, so I'm sure there's time to catch up, haha
As of right now, I have found myself binging *Die Neue These* and have almost caught up to their current episodes for *Intrigue*
Gonna go to bed, but I wanted to get this question out of the way before I forgot. Anyone watch any version of Legend of the Galactic Heroes?
Curious as I am, I really must get to bed now
That... sounds like a loaded backstory
... which probably means a reprisal in the upcoming NieR:Automata Ver 1.1a, too
since Pascal is voiced by Aoi Yuki in the JP audio
https://tenor.com/view/who-asked-pascal-nier-nier-automata-gif-24118174
See, my first thought was...
Ah.
Cause I can think of at least one Aoi Yuki robot and it isn't an anime
???
I have never seen the new Berserk in any capacity other than... well, stuff like this
This one is even worse because it's fucking 3D, isn't it?
YES. EXACTLY LIKE THIS.
my memories of the turn of the millennium all coming back to me
it makes me feel like I'm watching anime in the morning before I go to school
fucking seriously, the way the characters slide around in that GIF
Ah, I thought you were referring to those early 2000's looking sliding animations
Finished G-Witch Episode 5, and, uh... ||We got some mysteries floating here||
And, uh, HOT DAMN
I assume ||Chainsaw Man||
but given their excitement
I don't even know what manga that's for
think this time around it's cause he was involved with outfit design?
he was doing a lot of character images for AMAIM Warrior at the Borderline, too
bless Ippei Gyoubu for all these images
Starting up G-Witch Episode 5... ||Holy shit, we got Cyber Newtype shit||
I wonder about the choice they will make when (NieR:Automata spoilers!) ||the Logic Virus hits and Pascal's village either gets cannibalised by other machine lifeforms or *takes their own life to prevent themselves from a less dignified death,* leading to the choice of ending Pascal himself or erasing his memories of the resulting trauma||, or if it will even happen this way at all
and here we are
I literally mentioned last night about Pascal being voiced by Aoi Yuki
SPEAK OF THE DEVIL lmao
GUNDAM DA
Granted, perhaps it's better posted in <#567740255273222175>...
The mobage preregistration is happening now
It appears that G-Tekketsu G is *finally* becoming a thing, like, for real now
I'm going through G-Witch's twitter to see what they've posted recently, and... https://twitter.com/g_tekketsu/status/1585957049984335872?s=20&t=67lMOOCNc5gP6glU5hihDQ
On another note, there is apparently an official clip account on TikTok for G-Witch. The sample they use to promote it, naturally, is the Chuchu Punch
https://twitter.com/G_Witch_M/status/1586264069677408257?s=20&t=67lMOOCNc5gP6glU5hihDQ
... perhaps I shouldn't say that when not concealing the tweet, though
Fair, fair, lol. Just wanted to keep the exact name under wraps just in case people *don't* like model kit spoilers
it appears that Chuchu's Demi Trainer will come with a little extra than what we've already seen. Just in case it shows up in today's episode I'll spoiler it, but it's ||a Beam Rifle||
Oh hey https://twitter.com/KANETAKE/status/1586549754984419328?s=20&t=67lMOOCNc5gP6glU5hihDQ
... and I soon realise that very few of them do <:NotLikeFist:689188869974786133>
immediately made me try to recall all of the recent anime I have seen with a jump in the OP
lmao, that first screenshot
Let's just hope ||he makes it to the end of the first cours at least||
If that does happen like you think it does, ||Biscuit is gonna die all over again|| (and tbh, I won't be surprised if it does happen that way)
The curse of ||Natsuki Hanae characters in Gundam||
There is only one flying blade antenna I have seen thus far, and that's the one attached to the SD Type form of Star Winning Gundam. That being said, it was used as a boomerang, rather than remote weaponry...
Kana Ichinose's performance is so precious
all I can recall is orange name and being a relative beginner to Gundam, and that I was here when that started
I think I might have confused you for END, on that note
Ah, I see. Fair enough
That they are, so **why'd they only use it in the last three episodes?!** I know we're rapidly approaching 30 years since then, but still...
I don't even know if I was a part of that conversation or not, wouldn't be surprised if I was though
Shin Sei approved boxart
https://i.redd.it/w22lneynn4t91.png
but man, is this song something special
I imagine they did it mostly because of how they divided up the OVAs to the TV format (which saw the end of OVA Episode 6 be the stinger for RE:0096 Episode 17, and immediately picked up on in the following episode)
but it wasn't originally an OP
This opening goes **in**
And then you have *this* https://youtu.be/VLDZO-dN_ls
Openings w/SFX are a special occasion, that's for certain
I distinctly remember hearing JUST FLY AWAY without the old school mecha movement sounds before the first verse
but they added those later once the tournament really kicked off (and most of the major players of the tournament were revealed)
I think when OP2 debuted for GBFT, it didn't initially have sound effects in the OP
one of the few examples I know of an evolving opening outside of this one was Gundam Build Fighters and its sequel series - both of them concealed certain mobile suits in the OPs until they were introduced properly (such as Star Winning Gundam's Real Mode transformation)
Not exactly a common thing with anime, really, and certainly not with Gundam for the most part
V2 makes it much smoother by actually having it light up, then cut to the thrust followed by an epic launch
it's a little awkward to look at the V1 version of OP2 to see Heero Yuy push forward on the levers, just to see Wing Zero light up
IMO, the differences between the cuts make the second version much better in terms of overall flow, and *especially* the money shot of Wing Zero at the beginning launching
In my honest opinion, the second version of the OP is better for more than just the beeps, and I'm honestly sad that it wasn't used for very long
Final two or three episodes, yes
~~for those curious, the beeps are that of the ZERO System~~
The amount of views is just over a 10:1 ratio on the beeps version
https://youtu.be/l18K9uLMKKk
https://youtu.be/ICOwBtm8L_s
So they later uploaded OP2 again (w/beeps)
cause apparently everyone remembers the second version of that OP, where said beeps were included
As for why, pretty much everyone was like "WHERE'S THE BEEPS"
On that note, an amusing upload of an OP that I've seen (fairly sure from them) is for Gundam Wing OP2, *RHYTHM EMOTION*
Maybe just based on when they recorded/uploaded the OP?
I wonder if it was done that way just to remind you what his former study was
Ah yes, the Colasour Chronicles. The thing I liked the most about it is that you even get a voice cameo for the one time where he doesn't appear physically ||and a voiced on-screen appearance in the final episode of GBD||
MULTIPLE acronyms, even
where, like fucking everything in Cosmic Era, it is an acronym
Every other instance is just OS screens
~~not that Delling can tell the difference~~
It's mostly there so the viewers know it is a Gundam
Also a fair point. They hardly use the term "Gundam" at all
Ah, that makes sense. The show where every nation had a Gundam.
Basically. The status of Gundam generally incites fear into the hearts of those who know of its exploits, cause it will develop a reputation somehow, through its pilot's abilities or that of the unit itself
Which one even was that?
Colasour the Immortal ||became Colasour the Extremely Lucky||
And the fact that he ||even survives the ELS invasion in 00 the Movie is a testament to his crazy luck in surviving situations where most would not||

Truly a Special character. ||Married man, survived every single encounter he ever had with the Gundams, and lived through an alien invasion!||
oh sick, I'm all about My Hero Academia /s
Fair enough, lmao
Their enthusiasm is over the top, and can alienate some
The nature may differ somewhat, but I feel like in the end fanatics of all types of fandoms evoke very similar behaviours
Some revere Rick & Morty as peak comedy, some revere Lelouch for being Lelouch
At the same time, I feel like both fanbases have their fanatics, one way or another
Memed to hell
I was gonna say, uh
I will say, this is solely because this is how the description of Rick & Morty and Code Geass being a power fantasy of some sort is working out in my head
or roughly the same, anyway
Then just illustrating different works of different genres which have that same thing
It's a bit hard to explain by text alone, but basically it's like... Say, you have the central thing they all have in common - a power fantasy, if you will
I don't mean an animation
More or less genres, yes, but I mean, like, a visual themed around a specific thing they all share in common
I only bring this up because for whatever reason, that is what appears in my head trying to process this conversation
I wonder, could you construct some absurd branching visual showing a theme, and then branching off into different shows that take that idea and add their own spin?
Only the memes
I have never seen Rick & Morty beyond clips, so I have zero idea of the premise
you guys put the idea of picklelouch into my head
great
I imagine some could absolutely misinterpret it to push an agenda, though
Exactly. As I said, closest, but not an actual encounter
Which I imagine is why we got Gundam THE ORIGIN, as well as his final work, G-Doan
Granted, it's cause he was there from the beginning, but Yoshikazu Yasuhiko says that the only Gundam for him is First Gundam
Closest encounter I have with a UC purist is, amusingly enough, one of the franchise's own creators
I thankfully have not encountered one who actually thinks this way
The only thing I hate about UC is gatekeepers who think Gundam should only be that
Thunderbolt goes past what the movies have covered, doesn't it?
and I swear that Gochiusa was one of those shows
I know, Rem, but there were other roles around that time, too
I *know* she is, I was just trying to remember if that was one of the roles that made her famous
Cause, like, wasn't she Chino in that show?
Isn't it one of the earliest works where Inori Minase made a name for herself?
I still need to continue Gochiusa, on that note
A lot of ~~cute-girls-doing-cute-things~~ slice of life anime seem to take place in such a setting, I'm not surprised one bit
(Anyways, sorry for the wall of text... I just wanted to get my two cents out there)
And who the fuck even knows what's going on with Project Ignited's as-of-yet unlaunched projects? (The movie and SEED mobage)
Production for G-Tekketsu G - which notably also has one of the earliest Sunrise Beyond works prior to the Bandai Namco Filmworks merger - was also hella delayed (edit: at least now, prereg has officially begun)
Hathaway, Gundam BDR, Sangoku Soketsuden, all these got delayed one way or another
And, I'll be honest, pretty much every recent Gundam work that has come out over the past 3 or 4 years has had some sort of issue hold it back somehow... So I sorta just shrug it off, even if that's not really a good thing to do
Especially for something that we can't really control on our end
As much as it is important to acknowledge issues as they come to light, I feel like worrying about it too much will just freak everyone out unnecessarily, but that's just my take in any case
And as for the whole production thing... Whatever is going on behind the scenes, it's not like anything much can be done to change what is already done, and I doubt we can change much about the plans right now
I assume some shit happened in this episode. Late in the series?
A far cry from the days of "He is a CHAR"
I would imagine that a lot of the English text that appears in recent instalments these days is their work
I need to commit that one guy's name to memory, but there is a person who has done most of the localisation/subtitle work for Gundam since joining Sunrise. All I remember is that he used to run one of the biggest Gundam fansites before then, so he knew what was up
English text has gotten a lot more prevalent over the last decade in Gundam works, or at least the quality has noticeably improved
Movie level effort, I daresay. That, or just coordinated localisation efforts. It reminds me of that news article you see of Mafty being the next Char on a tablet in Hathaway
Wufei alert
*OKAY THEN*
does she know
So basically, ||the whole post is Kurumi related in some fashion||
RIP
or some other decode
maybe trying to see if it's a goroawase message (like 963 = ku-ru-mi)
People are trying to decipher the second part, now that they realise this
apparently the first part is also present on the shirt of another character
Replies are scrambling to decipher this
I didn't even think about that, but damn, you're right
can we not with these
..........................
And you have Beerus and Frieza in Japan's dub of it
Also, go figure - apparently in the case of *Our Love is Stronger than a Golden Banana* it was actually DK's regular voice actor singing, not his usual singing voice
Do you think they should have gotten away with that back then, or were the connotations associated with that song these days just not widespread enough back then for people to look at it the way we do now?
... though tbh, that whole song is a bit sus
Even with the questionable lyrics of the one song
so who you hear singing is different to who you hear doing the dialogue
https://www.behindthevoiceactors.com/tv-shows/Donkey-Kong-Country/
If I'm not mistaken, there were separate singing voices for most characters in the original English dub
Cranky Kong I'm fairly sure is the first character to sing on the show - in the first episode's opening scene no less
https://www.behindthevoiceactors.com/tv-shows/Donkey-Kong-Country/japanese-cast/ You will find a surprisingly healthy amount of familiar names here
People have uploaded the JP dub to YouTube, too, so feel free to compare and contrast
Apparently the Japanese dub of the TV series of Donkey Kong Country was pretty popular over there
In that same JP dub, you hear Ryusei Nakao - most famous as Freeza-sama - take on the role of Cranky Kong
Fun fact, he voiced Donkey Kong once
Oh yeah, Koichi Yamadera
https://twitter.com/sao_anime/status/1588909002511065091?t=bMYR0Gv1RldWeGmKpI9PJA&s=19
Split seasons, now split cours, and also several major works in other timelines have become movies and OVAs instead of TV series
The franchise was kinda already going that direction, IMO, over time
We won't know until probably another half a year later
Whether or not it's definitive, that's up for speculation
Whatever happens, there will probably be some sort of conclusion at the end of its second cours
Mmm. In my case I think it's recency bias speaking
... and, well, also because GBD:R literally had a Season 2 (and the first split cours of a Gundam series I know)
Sure, sequels happen for Gundam Build series, but for the most part they don't feel like a "Season 2" of that world to me since they primarily follow a new set of protagonists
Indeed, 50 was the norm in the past. I guess I'm just used to the recent series and Builds that came out after G-Tekketsu so I'm used to a Gundam series which ends at 25 now
But I'd be happy to be proven wrong
I personally think that 25-26 is gonna be the new norm for Gundam
am I actually watching seasonal anime for once
Also, on a completely random note... holy shit
I can't shame people for being curious, personally
that I'm fairly sure one of us in this very server was just watching
to the point where there's a fucking anime about that shit
I mean, sometimes it's interesting to know *why* things are that way
Makes sense. All that certainly helps in being able to read all the credits each episode, heh
(I've been meaning to mention this for a solid two weeks now)
Certainly more than me, anyhow.
You'd probably be privy to that sort of thing if you were passionate enough to be a part of a fansub group
Just wanted to mention while you were here, Millhi... It took me a solid... 4 weeks of talking to you after G-Witch started to realise you're from YameteTometeSubs, and it made me realise why you were constantly speculating about the production process for the show
Oh, is it now? I guess I may have been slow on the uptake or just not thought about it until now ||due to the supposed similarities between Suletta and Elan, and the fortune, not really clicking with me in that sense until today's episode||
Crackpot theory for G-Witch, but... ||What if the original Ericht Samaya is actually already dead and her soul **powers Gundam Aerial,** while the one we see as Suletta Mercury is actually a clone of some sort and doesn't realise it?||
(A past Gundam role for Tsunematsu, for those who don't get it, from Gundam 00)
Let's hope she gets more relevance and importance compared to Marina Ismail, lmao

Add one to the list of G-Witch memes
While ||the real Elan stays out of sight for a while longer. I think E07 is too early for him to reveal himself||
I'm gonna guess that ||another clone will take the stage and set off some plot points which will eventually embroil the main cast into the behind the scenes of the corporate war|| (G-Witch E06)
YEP
That sums it up well
Though ||with the *real* Elan Ceres now in the picture, now we get to hear what I assume is Natsuki Hanae portraying a presumed jerkass in addition to an aloof clone||
What if there's some calendar fuckery regarding the planets they're all living on, lmao
FUCKING ||**GRILLED CORN**||
OH **NOOOOOOOO** (G-Witch Episode 6 spoilers!)
No need to rush it if you desire a break in the middle
You've got two whole weeks to catch up
That'd be a hella crackpot theory, but not entirely implausible. ||Makes me wonder if there are any other hidden names we can find in the references to *The Tempest*||
Maybe I can change that with bocchi
You'd think that'd be different for a person who probably likes music more than anime
I hardly watch any music-related anime aside from the ones I've already seen
Go figure, by the way
Ooh, I'm always down for behind-the-scenes for music
it'll also contain a BD, apparently
which will contain 14 songs, from what I hear
I will say, binging the first five episodes of BOCCHI THE ROCK!! has ignited a desire in me to purchase the upcoming album, *Kessoku Band*
and I binge watched it to the point where I found out that it's a current seasonal
For whatever reason, I had a totally random impulse to just start it up again recently after heading home from the ongoing festivals here where I live
... yep, that was definitely me and Ginei DNT when I started watching it
And all my other anime consumption has otherwise gone into binge watching anime that's already long past, or stuff I already watched in general
I'd probably have just stuck to G-Witch if I didn't pick up Ginei (after starting and dropping it a good while back), cause the only recent anime I was interested in beforehand were that and Fuuto PI, which has ended
Normally, I'm not a seasonal anime viewer. Something just caught my eye this time around, though, by pure coincidence I guess
*I left that part out intentionally*
Right now I actually have three series on my plate: G-Witch, BOCCHI THE ROCK!! (which I just started today go me) and Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These
Chances are ||she was likely working her way up the ladder of Shin Sei Corporation||
~~at least for me it means Bocchi and G-Witch will be at the same episode number by the time the latter resumes~~
Gonna have to ride that high for two weeks while we wait for the next episode
It's worth noting that ||even if Aerial's soul isn't actually Eri, she is treated like a daughter by Prospera Mercury/Elnora Samaya, who in turn is referred to as a mother in the Cradle Star novel||
I just realised something weird. Whether they knew it or not, ||Peil killing off No.4 meant that they inadvertently killed off perhaps the only character outside of Shin Sei that knows the true secret of Gundam Aerial, since it seems the data storm that burst from Aerial made him have a revelation. Whether or not they kept the data he experienced is up for question, but it seems like many people at Asticassia are now scrambling to analyse the data storm - so I'm sure the truth will start to unravel itself||
Hmm... Interesting point there. ||It reminded me that I'm fairly sure the 4yo Eri had blue permet data flow visible on her face, albeit still without any ill effects, and the 17yo Suletta has not displayed any of that, either. The closest we get are the trails from the Bit Staves, and the data storm explosion at the end of E06's duel. Otherwise, all the permet activation we see (when the MS glows) all comes from Aerial herself||
One more thing to consider for all you theorycrafters: ||It is said that certain functions of Gundam Aerial are tied to Suletta's vitals, which are one of the reasons why only she can utilise its full potential. Take that information how you will.||
Either ||she does not know how to, or that she naturally has sync with Aerial as such that she doesn't need it... yet.||
Note that ||Suletta has never once increased Permet score in any of her fights, and she could keep toe to toe with all her opponents thus far - albeit seemingly with some intervention in her fight against Elan and Pharact||
Even if it wasn't Gundam's biggest disaster, I can honestly see why they pushed themselves a bit for Re:RISE, and it thankfully worked out for them
Right in the midst of their Gundam 40th Anniversary push
It's a miracle that its sequel was as well received as it was, honestly
GBD wasn't well received by the majority
And in those 10 years, the arguably biggest Gundam flop happened within the last four
I am in shock that I didn't realise that the dodgeball episode of SPYxFAMILY had ||motherfucking Full Burst||
... before I go to bed
Plus, ||it's a Gundam - the main one for that side of Benerit Group at that||
I'm almost certain that ||we will see more Pharact in the future; Peil's probably building another model for their next clone to pilot||
I'd imagine, I'm only up to Episode 10 as of right now and I know the manga is still ongoing
**TOTAL ||SISCON|| OH GOD** (SPYxFAMILY E09)
literally that episode
Yuuuuuuuuup
So I finally started watching SPYxFAMILY, and for whatever reason, I'm hearing Yuri Briar's performance by Kensho Ono and I'm thinking "I reckon he'd make a good Amuro Ray with these inflections"
I was thinking about taking the piss out of that moment myself somehow
Were those both from the same season, or a S1/S2 comparison?
Righto...
also apparently a completely different eye* colour?
He has returned
https://twitter.com/machocal2/status/1588911074954608640?t=x1P_sSlfik1GVh0bgZVj6g&s=19
That reminds me, I need to search to see if there is an equivalent meme featuring ||either a beheaded Barbatos or the slash that destroyed Flauros, both from the Reginlaze Julia||
Weird but relevant question... ||Assuming the real Elan Ceres is voiced by Natsuki Hanae as No.4 was, do you think he, too, is destined for an eventual death? Or do you think that for once, one of his characters should be granted mercy in a Gundam series - be it the real Elan, or a future Enhanced Human whose face was stolen to become another one of his body doubles?||

I ask in relation to ||Biscuit from G-Tekketsu, who also bit the dust as a Hanae voiceover||
motherfucking Okouchi himself
Not just someone on staff
What would Gundam's rice fields be
Fuck, that meme has given me inspiration
||HYPER BURST, KANZEN KAIHOU||
I know what it *should* stand for right now, but to people like me, it means Complete Selection Modification and not Chainsaw Man
as a Kamen Rider fan, I must admit the abbreviation of CSM confuses the hell out of me
but basically it is now part of my routine to watch Social Anxiety Sunday, between that and G-Witch
Depending on timezone, could be a Saturday
If you do end up catching up, new episodes of *BOCCHI THE ROCK!* are dropped in the wee hours of the morning in Japan time on a Sunday, if I'm not mistaken
the MV has been reuploaded, with the English version of the song
I'm being redundant, but G-Witch fans, we have been blessed https://youtu.be/C7p1RIksKp8
Theories abound for G-Witch after its wham lines from the previous episode, and Tom Aznable's got some words to say in this thread... ||https://twitter.com/TomAznable/status/1589519479553536001?s=20&t=bzSRMK7kw2w24UfhheSpng||
that fucking Ryu smile
the source of everybody's dreams and nightmares
Wait, fucking Shinkiro? The same man who, years later, would make THIS? https://twitter.com/LilFormers/status/1366114565315002371?s=20&t=6ODaH-fOWMvFWkH_OAiBhQ
... I don't even know either of them so <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
It was a 4koma originally, wasn't it? Or so I heard
who even be the yamas
that's G-Witch
why not both
bocchi the rock truly is a seinen that appeals to me
wait what
and I can absolutely say, that is 100% Obari there
Okay, that other shot is much closer to what I thought it'd look like
That's a little... Hmm. Not sure how I feel about this
... I'm sorry, was that too much?
*Salami Ovaries*
Ooh buddy... Now I'm kinda curious
Certainly a lot better, I'll say that
I gotta go to bed, but I just wanted to throw my two cents in there
they look more Wing than Wing Zero EW does
it looks like it's gushing out torrents from its wings
imagining a DBZ fight but with mecha... yeah, HELL no, not even the craziest super robots are *that* fast
Oh? Zeta's on their upcoming lineup?
~~I know for certain, the people will look to exploit it for various custom Figure-rise~~
We all know the real reason
Must have been done to coincide with the release of The Blessing in English (the credits of which officially title the novel "Cradle Planet")
A very political episode, that one
So would Multiversus be the last time we ever hear his Batman voice?
Damn...
I reckon it's gonna be entirely to do with whether or not Rica Matsumoto's willing to continue
(It's Sirfetch'd, last I remember)
Someone's been thinking of JP Gardevoir, lmao
I think generally the actual reason is that they usually release volumes periodically? But idk
or so I heard anyway
that's generally where most vtuber posts go in this server
*RIP*
in Japan, I mean
Also, there are box sets for Macross Delta now
Isn't that cause of the file size of the actual video?
Was wondering if someone would notice, lmao. If you recognise 'em, hit me up at <#407060923078017026> later

I imported Hathaway and Unicorn, I'm fiiiiiine
those of you who have seen me post my CDJapan orders will probably already know, but I live in Australia, lol
it'd actually be a lot easier for me to import from Japan
For the record, I do not live in the US
I should fix that
I haven't checked Madman Entertainment in a good while, on that note...
Great... More stuff that is probably irrelevant to me because of my location, lmao
Ah.
Oh, there's a proper west release?
I mean, I will say, I'm probably going the foolish route for a first-timer cause I was intending on getting all the BDs
and I mean what I said - including the movies
I was thinking of watching Macross Delta in its entirety
Doing what they can to eliminate any unnecessary data while keeping the quality as high as it can be
That, my friend, is what they call optimisation
A full box set *generally* doesn't come until later, but it's been a while since Demon Slayer's animation was concluded, wasn't it?
All subtitled, at least.
Seems they also have the usual creditless OP/ED, and a bunch of the promotional material as well
Going to the site, I see... Illustration art card set, 26 episodes + 2 special episodes
Perhaps I don't have any right to speak, though, considering the Gundam Unicorn Complete Box I bought was the one that included a special Gunpla to go with it
I can only guess that they're also trying to cover the cost of either import or goods production within each box
How much moolah does that even put into the box?
And for those who may somehow be unaware, it's simply pronounced "spy family". Apparently it was a suggestion by... think it was an editor? Either way, a suggestion to make the title more appealing (a bit like HUNTER x HUNTER, which also omits the multiplication sign from its pronunciation and was also the reason for the suggestion)
Random, forbidden question. When you hear people talk about SPY x FAMILY, what do you think is worse - pronouncing it "SPY ecks FAMILY", "SPY cross FAMILY" or "SPY by FAMILY"?
Japan is in closer proximity to where I live, compared to the US
I wonder how costly it would be for me to import something from Right Stuf
Damn. Must have been a good deal for you, then
RIP
More power to you, haha
and why I chose to build my PC with a Blu-ray Disc drive
This is actually why I purchased a license for CyberLink PowerDVD
And as for imports, getting Japanese ones would simply be better for me compared to US ones, if I didn't have any other choices anyway
For me, I don't keep up too much with Madman Entertainment, Hanabee or any other anime publishers here in Australia so it's hard for me to come up with a proper comparison
Could also be a thing to do with where they are being manufactured, in terms of the variation in pricing I mean
Are there different types of Blu-ray Disc? Ones with more or less capacity?
Of course, the only caveat really would be if they have a dub or not between regions, but even then I imagine it shouldn't take much more space
I will admit, it's mostly conjecture on my end. I reckon it would be fun to explore this sort of thing at some point to see if any of that discussion above holds water or not.
Long before the decision to turn it into animation proper
There is some neat stuff in bonus discs 5-9, including the original animated teaser for the novels
I like exploring behind the scenes if I can, which is one reason I do not regret my purchase of the Gundam Unicorn BD Box Complete Edition
If it has the exact same content I would not be surprised if that is why (i.e. no resolution drops, nothing left out between regions)
I was obsessed with it back then - discovering the secret prompts on the menu, and spending more time watching the second disc over the first
It may stem from having a childhood dedicated to my 2-Disc Special Edition of Finding Nemo
Some people care a lot about the bonus content, I guess I'm one of those peeps
That's 14 discs worth of DigiPaks
Four discs each for Gundam Unicorn and the TV recut, five for bonuses, one special soundtrack
I did want to note... I take a look at something like my Unicorn Complete Box and it has a ridiculously high amount of discs, period. But boy, is it stacked. One set of discs is for the OVAs themselves, then bonuses begin with RE:0096, followed by what actually counts as bonus content to most
That sentence was about the Discotek Gear releases, but either way I feel like we may have lost track of the conversation a bit
Mmm, but still, they packed a LOT in there
It was to do with the bonus content, IIRC. Either way, different publishers have different approaches, too
hence why it was on my mind
I imagine cases like that are few and far between, but I seem to remember reading about it when they detailed Symphogear GX earlier this year
compared to its equivalent JP releases which have it all at high def
I was thinking about it relative to, say, the Symphogear Discotek releases which cut the resolution on some things to get it all to fit within as few discs as possible
High res, lots of bonus moolah and all that
For some others, they wait until the end instead
For some shows, anyway
I never properly finished it
I need to rewatch Pop Team Epic
Guess I'll be getting the Kessoku Band album and first Bocchi the Rock BD together
and I'm sure we all know this, cause Symphogear itself had 'em
okay, Bocchi the rock E6... ||STRONG KYOMU||
I must admit... I might also import the Blu-rays. They've got the series OST on 'em
Also. https://www.cdjapan.co.jp/product/SVWC-70613
Oh? Wonder how this one is expanded upon to fill the runtime
Which reminds me, I've yet to scout for it on CDJapan... Should fix that as I think of my next order on there
If I were to sum up how I feel about what we've heard thus far...

Long story short, I'm buying the Kessoku Band album when it comes out
they had to bring the music to life
For me, I guess one of the biggest appeals of the show is the fact that, since it's music related
whether it be conversations in a different place, rearrangement of events, or an expansion of inner thoughts
cause it means coming up with a bunch of new stuff to fill out the time properly
I get that, haha. I just think that that part in particular deserves credit
To produce a full length episode based on so few panels is insane
*One chapter.* One chapter was all of Episode 5.
which is why I immediately took a shine to it after I started
I feel like it's more appealing and relatable to a person like me
Ha! Guess that conversation came in handy, eh?
I don't recall what MAPPA are most famous for, or if I've seen any of their works
I'd have to give an honest thought to this to see if anything comes to mind, but as of right now, nothing does
**Damn**
Maybe just for FX Burst? Who knows?
Can anyone who has (unfortunately) seen the series back me up on this?
I've never seen Gundam AGE myself, but all I can tell is that RAAAAGH screams from Kio are a regular occurrence
hear that scream in the final attack here
https://youtu.be/f6tm4Q4DrDM
and the English equivalent is just an all-caps "AAARGH!" which doesn't indicate at all just how long that scream lasts
Thinking about Kio Asuno in SD Gundam G Generation Cross Rays and the text box in Japanese being just AAAAAAAAAAAAA but really long
Or give an idea of how long it should last
I imagine it's done that way so that they can engage precise timing for those vocals in whatever they're recording
Probably better understood in Japanese, honestly. Onomatopoeia can be written into the script directly, rather than just description like it maybe would be in most English scripts - at least, from what I've seen
just as English speakers say "meow", Japanese speakers say "nya"
If *that's* the case, it's just onomatopoeia
A whole 30 minutes of Kana Ichinose narration
Honestly, this is really helpful to pinpoint where it ties into the lyrics
Ah... They're all screenshots from the MV https://youtu.be/zjYUvN-LRrU
damn you, non-indicative wording
I guess it'd be Kana Ichinose as it'd make the most sense, but
They said "the voice actress", but... which one?
Wait, who's reading this aloud?
Pfffff
Seems like the break from regular G-Witch is definitely giving rise to some interesting side material and behind the scenes stuff
They moved networks for its TV broadcast
It's a sequel to one of the worst received Gundam series in recent history
I've said this before, but...
It's why GBD:R is such a miracle show, in hindsight
... I do wish they came with better timing, though
At the same time, though, I'm not seething with rage over its plot developments
That's arguably worse, I'd say, than something notorious for being bad
I'm probably one of the few who will tell you that I didn't mind how it went, though overall, a bit mid
Fighters, not Divers (for the above message)
I'm somewhat passionate over how I feel about the original Gundam Build Divers, for example
Admittedly, that list isn't exactly *large,* but
tbh, I feel like some of my responses to Gundam opinions may hit harder if it involves something I watched the simulcast for
that one shot of Uraven Gundam firing the Beam Shoot Rifle U7 from 3 different camera angles is still one of my favourite sakuga from the Gundam Build series
I will say, great fight, this one, definitely a highlight of the first series. And coincidentally, the same thing happens in Gundam Build Divers Re:RISE - Episode 18 is home to a high-stakes sniper shootout, followed by some big plot revelations over the next two episodes
His skills weren't lacking, it was his resolve and determination
As for Sei, it's his character development through the entire show
It's a bit of an endgame question, this one, as both are revealed in the final episode
I will say, I look back in hindsight at most of Try's battles more fondly because they're team-based, and the few times where it does go solo, it's for a good reason
The only thing it was missing, really, was swords and head vulcans, compared to God Gundam
Considering the dude's a martial artist and the entire Burning Gundam lineage was designed to be a homage to G Gundam...
I didn't consider it a "special moment", I considered it his main fighting style
And that's how they win pretty much the entirety of the second half of the show
Once all options are exhausted, it's RG System + Build Knuckle or nothing
Except it didn't
I find the appeal in both shows, personally, for different reasons
I find it interesting, this contrast between you two when it comes to GBF/GBFT
You know that can't be helped due to the lack of *anything* on the Burning Gundam lineage, right
No, what worked was the Meatbun Chronicles

So they decided, let's just make that *the entire show's relationships*
You can't deny it was also there to sell Gunpla and advertise all the new shit they were doing at the time, though
To be honest, if Gekko never finishes, I'd like to see Seere be detailed in G-Tekketsu MSV
Gundam Seere and stuff, right?
since, well, G-Tekketsu G is now in prereg (and G-Tekketsu SE aired)
I was gonna say, it's been quite a while since the radio silence was broken, heh
Is that entirely their fault, though?
They're almost certainly doing it so they can create new units for that game
G-Tekketsu G
I think I know the reason why, though
It took over 5 years, but MSV finally graced G-Tekketsu, huh?
OH GOD
Meanwhile, Birdie Wing got delayed to coincide with G-Witch's second cours...
Gimme ALL the beans
Power struggles, Darwinism, tensions between Earth and Space
the conspiracies to fly
time for the walls to crash down
now we get into real gundam
fucking knew it
next I see conversation about this, I'd like to ask you guys about how you feel about the actual mecha designs, lol
going from **RYUSEI-GO** to **LOVE ATTAAAAAAACK**
and it's such a contrast
fun fact, he shares his voice with Norba Shino
MAGEE
OH YEAH
hums INVOKE's chorus in one episode, does an end-of-episode narration exactly like in Gundam SEED in another
Also, she was previously Murrue Ramius in Gundam SEED, so references to that role are plenty
No, but she does make a pose referencing Sailor Moon in Episode 23
And it was NOT
***it says a fucking lot about how they won most of their fights***
which, given than it eventually became **all Build Knuckle...**
Designed to suit his fighting style, apparently
I mean, that's what Sei's father was
(I'm still awake, yes)
I mean, she does have Kotono Mitsuishi behind her voice...
I mean, it's a check to myself, too. I ramble on without prompt out of habits ~~that should not be copied~~
Should have gone to bed way earlier than I did
In any case, I'll stop rambling before I cover the entire chat in a wall of repeated gushing over this show
~~also, for me personally it introduced me to Spira Spica and I'll forever be grateful for it~~
Series was so epic, they even pushed out a final episode trailer
Perhaps the move to push it as a web series for its premiere may have also helped
Gundam Unicorn's scriptwriter was brought on, character development and ongoing plot lines were actually happening, and heck, for some it even vindicates the original cast of GBD
But somehow, it came together, beautifully
For a series that began in 2019 and continued - even as the pandemic was halting their progress in 2020 - you'd think that'd be a recipe for disaster, wouldn't you?
And on top of that, it was Gundam's first proper Isekai
this is 3 minutes 30 of Kana Ichinose
I freak out every time I see Mika Pikazo artwork
Wasn't just any writer, it was Fukuda's *wife,* Chiaki Morosawa
To be fair, while it may not be a "fix", that is already in the works
Unironically, I wonder what name they'd give such people if they existed in Ad Stella

Then again, they're already being labelled as witches... so idk
It helps to sell the first insert song of the series in Episode 5
OPs and EDs included
It's probably even funnier when you know that all the vocal songs sung in the show thus far are exactly this, since they are all performed in-universe by Kessoku Band (and likewise, feature Kita's CV Ikumi Hasegawa on vocals and Ryo's CV Saku Mizuno on back chorus), so it's all authentic
Maybe I'm more extroverted than I thought, considering I sit down at places like that on my lonesome on occasion just for the food
Would probably make more sense narratively for everything to come crashing down towards the end, rather than halfway through
I mean, the seeds have already been planted
but also it's supposedly ||"the end of their daily school lives"||
Concept art for Episode 7 was previewed in the special that they aired in place of an actual episode last week, and breaking news, ||both girls have one||
make a cursed custom with the limited YOASOBI stickers as well as the Aerial stickers

True, it did knock *her* out...
That isn't even the knockout punch, *weak*
The audio reading of said novel is on the Ayase / YOASOBI channel on YouTube
Probably not, but since it is just a reading of Cradle Planet by Kana Ichinose, you could just pull up the novel alongside
IDK, I kinda like the idea of ||AI is a crapshoot|| in Gundam since it's a change from ||your usual psychic bullshit||
... now that I think about it, this exact wording reminded me specifically of ||Marion Welch, the captive Newtype soul that powers the EXAM System||
We're only halfway through the first cours, and the only extra material we have to go by is Prologue, and Cradle Planet
We still don't have the full scope of that yet
What *is* the story the creators are making, though?
~~or is there a cutoff for you like The Game Awards~~
Cause if so, we've still got more songs to hear
Are there still anime to premiere with the remaining year?
Don't put drones into the hands of nobility who look on from high, please
if only because drone warfare is very much becoming a real thing in our reality
As much as all that is true, I can't help but be unsettled at the prospect of treating war as a game fought with naught but drone investments and ambitions of people who never join the front lines
... though I admit, perhaps I'm only saying this because I'm wondering just how deep down the rabbit hole it'll actually go once shit hits the fan, and I'm not quite sure if there's a clear answer on that
Things are being set in motion, I'd say, but I'm still not sure exactly *what* they will lead to ultimately
It's just me, really, but I personally think it's still too early to come to conclusions about the overall plot right now
You think? We still have roughly 18-20 episodes to go
I will say, that *is* pretty striking
But... I've probably already ranted about it before over here
By virtue of assuming that you mean the Kunio Okawara mechanical design, I have to disagree on that point
https://tenor.com/baqpD.gif
Thanks to Meer compatibility?
||Whatever the hell *that* means, it's probably coming with some revelations||
Mind you, one thing that I have not seen anyone mention (that I don't blame anyone for not realising) is that ||the HG Gundam Aerial kit has a sticker for red eyes||
I'll give my thoughts on the new G-Witch in about 14 hours, probably... hopefully I can get some sleep and finally do my overdue shopping in between now and then
perhaps I should actually watch FMA so I can feel more strongly (or not at all) about the constant references to that...
... but hey, it's a seinen, the demographic's likely in the know
as I said, today's digital world means that anime being on TV and jokes surrounding them may not be as well understood as it once was
'tis true
Fair enough. All this discussion over a ||fourth-wall break||, and all solely because I'm convinced that it'd be something that may be initially lost in translation if they didn't realise that
... also I'm fairly sure *the majority of the world outside of Japan can't watch simulcast anime on TV*
In today's digital world, perhaps that may not be as true as it once was
BOCCHI THE ROCK! E07: ||Oh god, this would have been TV broadcast, wouldn't it? The joke Nijika makes about Bocchi Time in this episode would make more sense there||
I'll catch that after I'm done with SPY x FAMILY then
oh, fuck, that's right, Bocchi drops at real dank hours where I am
SPY x FAMILY E20: ||Ceiling Anya is watching you cross-debate||
I've not seen much of the manga, if any, but given the way the anime depicts her, I can totally see why
On a random note, I read up that apparently, Anya Forger in SPY x FAMILY is looking increasingly more normal with her regular face in later volumes of the manga, because the author's a bit more focused into coming up with more ridiculous expressions for her to use outside of that
considering things like Great Days and Uragirimono no Requiem existed in previous parts for their finale arcs
Well, whatever happens, it'd probably be pretty disappointing if the same opening was used for the entirety, I'd say
usually with the plot hints hidden within - and also, sound effect opening on the final episode and all that
so I wouldn't be surprised if they actually had something different for the final episodes of Stone Ocean
I mean, finale arcs from Stardust Crusaders onwards tend to change the opening at least once
Wouldn't be surprised if it was also ||the same mechanical designer as the rest of Grassley Defense Systems||
I never really considered it from that angle, but it checks out. ||As far as I can tell, Shaddiq wants to really see how far Aerial can go||
The ones that ||show up in the opening as of Episode 7?||

I posted a link above which gives it *its official setting material* in Ad Stella
that's probably the big reason why it took a while before Miorine was featured on one, and I'm sure those of you who have seen G-Witch thus far will understand why
the "Fresh Tomato" flavour of Aerial snacks is actually a limited time flavour
also, as it turns out
I can absolutely see ||Suletta standing in the way of her mother's revenge, given time||
<https://twitter.com/YOASOBI_staff/status/1594246674242994176?s=20&t=WTG1F6PnswFOiueSYZdv6A> speaking of trends, ||YOASOBI Demi Trainer|| trending on Twitter
Even ||Guel's bro was suffering this time||
||Jeturk House takes another L because Miorine interfered||
lmao, holy shit, I didn't even think about that
Probably for that exact reason
... a piece of art I came across for this week's G-Witch episode that I just posted to <#336297674707828747> has made me realise ||Guel didn't show up **at all** this week||
https://discord.com/channels/336297387863703552/336297674707828747/1043870149872197662
according to it, ||the Demi Trainer owned by YOASOBI exists to explore possibilities with mobile suits beyond weapons||
they actually have some setting materials for this thing, if you'd like a lore reason as to ||why it's in the show|| (spoilered and embed gutted because it's related to G-Witch Episode 7) <https://www.gundam.info/news/video-music/01_9522.html>
also, holy shit
I have the YOASOBI Demi Trainer in my house right this moment
since my CDJapan order came in
you know, I just realised
Let's see, we got... ||real Elan's first interaction with the main cast, Vanadis is basically resurrected, and the truth of Aerial *and* Pharact's nature as a Gundam is finally spilled to Asticassia in front of basically everyone||
Worth the two week wait
*This* is the kind of stuff I'm in for with Gundam
Well then. Now *that* was an eventful episode of G-Witch.
LMAO THEY PUT ||THE YOASOBI DEMI TRAINER|| INTO THE PARTY
G-Witch E07 (now that it's out on CR): ||CHANGES TO THE OPENING||
Okay, so
I'm sure we wouldn't mind seeing more in <#336297674707828747>, lol
Still gets me that Mika Kanai is Tiffa's voice, considering I first heard it in Neptunia as Histoire
How do I know this? Cause I was scrolling past Kanetake Ebikawa's Twitter and saw him post a belated 15th Anniversary image
about 5 now
also, an excuse to talk about how the BD for Re:innovation (the stage play's sequel) is coming
it's a live drama
Thought so, but that isn't a stage play
Been meaning to fix that for a long time, actually, catching up on SSSS.GRIDMAN and SSSS.DYNAZENON
Oh... in hindsight, makes sense, but at the same time I guess I didn't get it on account of not having watched anything Gridman Universe - with the exception of some episodes of the original Gridman itself
Who?
Also, kerorira... No wonder they've been posting so much. It all makes sense now. https://twitter.com/kerorira1/status/1594434702584471552?s=20&t=XzbHGA2gEbyNZYlMvuI9Rg

about a third of them all seem to come from Sunrise anime

Long before talks of an animation would have even happened, perhaps
considering the guitar in use here is not Hitori Gotoh's usual Gibson 1957 Les Paul Custom
My personal guess is that this particular post predates the anime, by a long shot
(naturally, guitarhero follows the official account of the animation)
before it got revived recently thanks to the anime
Seems that the seldom tweets of our mysterious guitarhero handle were *very* few and far between, cause the gimmick was only seen for a little bit in 2019* (edit: 2009?! What the heck am I saying)
seems that the other particular of this account is that she's always looking for tapioca
I'm browsing through their tweets right now, and there's mentions of things like Summer Sonic (a Japanese music festival)
Whoever is responsible for this account is fucking awesome
**Yep**
wait no
Mecha anime bingo?
guitarhero *has been posting since 2019*
There we go
Maybe sending this might help https://vxtwitter.com/guitarhero_0221/status/1594289473495658497?s=20&t=Tn-nDsCYORac9Np6BguisQ

*kiite kudasai*
I have mo idea who made this meme originally, but when I saw it in another server, I had to share it
G-Witch E7: ||https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/380699210250584074/1044029814731984936/SPOILER_image.png||
I think it is lights every 2 hours once it's open, and then WALL-G movies in the evening
They have a schedule that you can see on its own website, IIRC
That'd explain it. Something ahead of the animation, then, that the series may not cover in this run (considering the 4koma is still ongoing and started in 2017)
I admit, I'm thinking of grabbing Macross Frontier at some point, too, cause the BD for Macross Delta: ABSOLUTE LIVE!!!!!! contains that extra Macross Frontier short film, too
So I'm good in terms of all the animation material for Delta, then?
(I admit, I decided to get it mostly because I saw there was only one copy left of each)
Could anyone familiar with it tell me if there's any particular things I may be missing? I mostly just got the two movies, and the main series itself, with this package
It'll be arriving at my house in due time
a little while back, I grabbed the entirety of Macross Delta
so, uh, I made a pretty big commitment
but in either case, fair enough
I didn't know which one they wanted to ask for, lol
Seems the best place to look is that URL
Thanks, BTR server!
poor Hamazi-sensei, lmao
https://twitter.com/hamazi__/status/1596541361523916800?s=20&t=JGlxSok56sg2fdG5o3cPQg Yep, even the author Aki Hamazi's freaking out over that
it's one of the few named songs from the manga, being brought to life
I already posted it in <#447132690349555712>
By the way, just wanna say, *kickass* song debut
Hold on, lemme ask
Apparently it's cause the story arc covered in this episode was the end of Volume 1 of the manga
everyone in the BTR server who was in the know were all like "next episode is kino episode" and I was like "wat"
which would be oddly appropriate given the whole ||Suletta/tomato|| thing at the beginning
I just wonder how people will react if we have a ||tomato in the mirror|| situation
I'm still hesitant to accept it as truth, since ||there's lies flying around as-is, what's to say there isn't more regarding the timeline itself||
But that's something that I think will only become clear when ||the beans are spilled to Suletta herself||
Noticeably, ||Suletta doesn't recognise the person on screen - the memory's probably buried far too deep for her to remember||
Also, this is the first time we've seen ||Vanadis Institute's true vision, isn't it? What they planned to use the GUND Format for||
And more importantly, the setups for new plot points
Just a less intense episode, after all the drama of Episodes 6 and 7 before it
To be honest, I don't feel like it was a small episode at all
gives the official debut of *That Band* a huge payoff, alongside the sakuga that goes with it
Helps to really sell the emotion and highlight the complications before the turnaround
And I very much agree with that, haha
Wow. What Kerorira mentions here is absolutely relevant now that Episode 8 just aired
||Had his face stolen there||
The origins of ||Gundam Lfrith are in and of itself shrouded in a bit of mystery. They've yet to explain why the young Eri in and of herself had such a sync with it||
And on that note... One key thing I really want to know about ||Vanadis is where the Lfrith prototype came from||
Though, I do kinda wonder, ||if one does subscribe to the idea of Suletta not being a young Eri, do you think that there are other ideas that people have come up with, other than the leading theory?||
Absolutely, there are visible gaps in the timeline, and inconsistencies...
I ask this because ||I want to know if there was something before the Vanadis Incident that served as the catalyst||
My question at this point is: ||What *does* Delling know about the Gundams, and what was his intention in eradicating them in the first place?||
this is probably gonna remain unresolved for a good half year
we're probably not gonna get answers to any of this until second cours
Whatever the case... I think one thing is clear
Hey, I'm not saying *I'm* the one who believes it
Wonder if anyone's used the "history is written by the winners" excuse yet?
I do have to wonder, though, how everything will go down between the fanbase if that theory turns out to be true
I'm mostly just making discussion for the sake of devil's advocate, really, and probably only have a very slight bias against the ||A-Eri-al|| theory
considering ||the possibility of the tomato in the mirror||
then again, that could go either way
Makes me wonder if someone's still not telling the truth here
you seem pretty set on that side of things, huh
All I can say is that there are certainly people who are *happy* that ||A-Eri-al|| theory has been given a blow this episode
I do wonder... What has the greater evidence for and against?
But as for why ||the GUND reaction happened||, that's anyone's guess
I mean, I reckon that's ammo more for ||Aerial being something beyond advanced AI and closer to achieving humanity - or violating rules of robotics, as it were||
And so ||the A-Eri-al|| theory starts to crumble
Fair point. I haven't watched it more or less since it came out, so I guess it just didn't cross my mind
even if they didn't, I feel like it would be on brand for an April Fool's
No, fansubs have seriously done this apparently
one of my favourites is ||crediting Aki Hamazi herself||
Fansubs are really having fun with this one, aren't they
In a sense, I guess it's like ||if you took Anaheim Electronics but made it the main plot of Gundam||
||Can't believe that Gundam and company drama are going hand in hand. Corporate takeovers, conspiracy between subsidiaries, ambitions for taking the head of the group and usurping their position...||
I feel like ||you pretty much could tell he'd oppose the protags at one point by the fact he is lined up to be the next head of Grassley Defense Systems, and is part of the Duelling Committee. Every other house has already taken a shot at Suletta and Aerial.||
A third and fourth have not been mentioned at all
First cours is on right now, second is in April
G-Witch is only two cours thus far
Or do you think that's still not quite evident?
Do we think we've gone far enough in G-Witch that we know what flavour of Okouchi we're getting?
in other words, there is a *very real chance* of having something like what Melua described above happen in G-Witch
... who is also the writer for this, mind
It does, but at the same time, they may very well keep Haruka Shiraishi for future consistency
Do you think it'll stick in the next cours? Yume Miyamoto being replaced by Haruka Shiraishi, I mean
Interestingly enough, the guy who replaced him would also then go on to be the official voice of Ramba Ral in other media, like SD Gundam G Generation Genesis or the VSTG Project developed Gundam games from 2016 onwards
Yep. I forget the names, but I know that in that show, Mr. Ral - who had been portrayed by his original voice from First Gundam - was replaced starting with Episode 6 due to similar circumstances
Dang, G-Witch got hit by this, huh? Sadly, not the first time this has happened in Gundam...
cause we were the first ones to get the New Nintendo 3DS
and nowhere else
in Australia
They did a whole Direct for a single console once
If anything, major Nintendo announcements will happen there in place of Direct
Plus... The Game Awards are approaching
Why? If they don't have game news to share, they don't need to do a Direct
Well, this is being said in hindsight, I'd say, though I can't blame you for thinking this
Earliest mention of the ||Bio-Sensor|| was apparently 1986
that resulted in ||developing a pseudo-Psycommu system called the Bio-Sensor, intended to assist in the control systems of the mobile suits it was installed in, like the Zeta Gundam and ZZ Gundam, allowing a Newtype to more easily interface with their mobile suit via mental commands||
Apparently it was a later retcon, but the whole thing with the ||Bio-Sensor|| is that ||due to being unable to keep track of everyone who worked on Psycommu tech, information about it leaked post-One Year War, and companies like Anaheim Electronics were then able to use that info to develop their own stuff||
so ||if there's something particularly upsetting that awakens within Kamille, for example, the Biosensor reacts and powers up the whole mobile suit||
the way it's explained from what I remember is ||it reacts to emotional states of Newtypes||
Yeah, uh, ||the Biosensor is pretty wack||
||THE BIOSENSOR SHIT||
OH, RIGHT
Was it ||the Waverider Crash||?
In relation to what? It's been a while so I haven't the faintest on what attack you're talking about
ORE WA MARIO DA
Holy shit
https://twitter.com/MON0EYE/status/1597722212139945984?t=nTlOtB2-jlSNRHnTwfD4pg&s=19
It's the real thing
https://tenor.com/view/zz-zeta-mecha-gundam-anime-gif-13038862
poor Judau, lmao
the very reason ZZ exists was to be a palate cleanser
even though Tomino wasn't happy with Zeta, heh
At least from hearsay, it seemed that Japan thought it was peak Gundam
Zeta got a lot of reaction back in the day, it felt like
manga instalments show that the events of ||ZZ|| do happen in various ways, such as ||an old Judau Ashta in Crossbone with a barely functioning ZZ Gundam, and Kamille working as a nurse past U.C.100||, but A New Translation says fuck all that
and alongside some other changes to the plot, means that ||the First Neo-Zeon War never happens||
||Kamille ends up recovering from Scirocco's final mind surge||
key point about A New Translation: ||This doesn't happen in that version||
Ah, so you finally reached ||the vegetable||
so he could just get those MS developed super quickly
apparently the explanation for why he switched MS so frequently was because he is fucking rich
... funnily enough, most of them are Scirocco's, it seems
Oh, referring to all the MS on their side
https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/gundam/images/9/97/Msz-008-wr.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20170206051951 Wave Rider Mode
ZII, transformation modelled after the Methuss
Cause I was about to ask you about this, on that note https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/gundam/images/2/2e/MSZ-008-front.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20140930183549
Are you talking about Titans Test Team stuff, or just main series/MSV stuff?
Asshimar is a goddamn horseshoe crab, lol
like The O?
took over 40 years of Gunpla engineering to make sure they could have a properly transforming version of the Zeta Gundam that wouldn't immediately become structurally weak from repeated transformation, heh
I just wish that they didn't forever curse the transformation to be as complicated as it was, lmao
Though on that note, I do really love the Zeta Gundam's actual design
... also, I was referring to the entirety of Zeta Gundam, not the MSZ-006 itself
Bit more your style? Fair enough
A lot of it is Kazumi Fujita's work
Zeta design? Pretty good.
I will say, on that note
... and considering I have a brand new TV now, I might have the proper excuse to actually watch them on a big screen
cause IIRC they all have English subtitles
tbh I'd like to get the U.C. Chronicle editions of the Universal Century works myself
See how I think about it now, compared to when I first watched it like 4 years ago
Talking about this at length makes me realise, I should probably rewatch it while it's on GundamInfo
which is why a lot of people were *pissed* at the time when ZZ came and initially started off much, much less serious
It's ironic that he wasn't happy with the way Zeta ended, because from what I hear, people *really* resonated with the story at the time
Tomino battling with depression at the time seemed to be part of why Zeta was the way it was
the Queen of Gundam music herself
thanks to Neil Sedaka, Moriguchi started her career
how could I forget that
Hiroko Moriguchi
... oh, wait
The mid-season upgrade, the full name and unit being said during the launch sequence, transforming MS... there's probably more, but those are the three that come to the top of my head right now
It introduced a lot of things that would become standard for Gundam in later instalments
and it had a *huge* impact, lemme tell you
mostly because I feel like I prioritise acknowledging the impact it had on the franchise more than anything else
And like a lot of things, I don't criticise it as harshly as perhaps I should
To be honest, I remember enjoying Zeta and seeing why people enjoyed it when I first watched it myself
what the rest of the world thought at the time, and now
whether or not Japan is still in agreement about it being peak Gundam
I wonder how people feel about Zeta these days, on that note
... though this only becomes truly evident when you see where the original Zeta ends and where ZZ picks up, as it almost entirely depends on one thing
the weirdest part about A New Translation is that ||the changes made to that version mean that the First Neo-Zeon War never happens||
well, since you're not gonna watch Gundam ZZ, I'll just say that ||you're about to reach the beginning of the First Neo-Zeon War||
sadly for fans of Kessoku Band, Ryo's been pushed out of the rankings
Nijika's the biggest winner this week, I'd say, gaining a ton of places
... rather, she - alongside Suletta - reentered the board thanks to G-Witch's return that week
I'll take a Super Mushroom... AND EAT IT
||Dude spent the entire First Neo-Zeon War recovering||
It would probably affect a lot of the interactions the two of them have, though, cause ||aren't most of them when he's still recovering from his vegetative state?||
Yuuuuuup. ||His existence is no better than a vegetable, as of this time. I think it's actually partially because of his encounter with Judau that he manages to recover, and becomes a nurse after the turn of the century if you believe what manga has to say about his fate||
I know, but ||at the same time, just one thing can have a ripple effect on events that are to occur later - if you assume the rest of it happens the same way, anyway||
or ||alert him about certain things that were to occur after the two meet up again||
The biggest problem I find with that theory is that ||Kamille wouldn't be able to give Judau the boost during the climax||
Though this mostly only matters in relation to ||Gundam Unicorn...||
Also, on that note, ||isn't Mineva Lao Zabi somewhere else entirely in A New Translation compared to Zeta?||
That's what I thought, yeah, cause ||Quattro Bajeena books it the fuck out of there with newfound scepticism of the world after his duel with Haman||
Things like ||the Second Neo-Zeon War, Judau being involved at all, Nu Gundam's development being a balance based on the data of all previous Gundams...||
Food for thought, on that note: They've never really gone beyond U.C. 0087 for A New Translation, but do you think the events we see in the main series could have occurred still? (And especially at the same timing.)
Four Murasame, for example, is voiced by Yukana in A New Translation IIRC
... then again, considering the voice changes at the time, that was another primary reason
I'm gonna have to see the appearances of things like Zeta Gundam in video games to compare them, but it'd probably explain why they always adapt it as A New Translation rather than the original
||She is, but I thought that the impetus for her to wage war in the name of Neo Zeon simply never occurred||
Huh. ||So Scirocco doesn't cause that immense feedback onto Kamille as his death throes||
Not quite the same thing, I know, but
I think the reason why people call it ||vegetable|| is because ||Kamille's status is a vegetative state|| at the end of Zeta
Now, though, it's come to the forefront as the premise and characters have been revealed
I posted it earlier, haha. It's been known about since the end of *hello, world 2022* and, until now it seems, has been worked on behind the scenes
The gap between *hello world 2022* and this PV's release has been so long, I completely forgot they announced that this project was even happening
https://youtu.be/lbmE9AwMJ-s
It seems that they are willing to address that point after how the last battle turned out
Whether or not he's the main protagonist remains to be seen, but...
THIS IS NOT A DRILL
**ASH IS CONTINUING HIS JOURNEY**
https://twitter.com/anipokefandom/status/1598201161659871232?s=46&t=64VkdoxqM4HUBAJ-ncP9fA
It's a JoJo tradition, why would they skip that?
Never had any doubt.
~~is it any wonder why people were annoyed that Bleach stole too many personnel in all fields~~
The importance of staff... Yeah, that definitely checks out
(They did it partially because the final episode was delayed due to COVID-19 and also last-minute additions, but still)
On a related tangent, have you ever seen any other show do a *final episode trailer?* https://youtu.be/deyzyRZ1huY
Made me curious if there were people like that for anime
and how some people wish to exclude things such as the story trailer for the sake of not being spoiled
Things like introducing the game (in progress), before delving deeper in later trailers, and then finally dropping the big story trailer right before release
Makes sense. The motivation to get an opinion on this sort of thing was because I sorta started thinking about it in the sense of how I see people treat video game promotion
Does it take only the first PV with characters & setting? A more story-focused PV? Perhaps prior recognition on other media? Or do you sometimes just jump in knowing nothing but the synopsis?
I do wonder, on that note... What does it take for you people to be interested in an anime?
Any particular story beats we can get probably won't be seen fully until a second PV next year
we're only scratching the surface, after all; the PV's primary purpose is the introduction of the world and characters
Can't say much until more details drop
I'll keep my expectations tempered, though
I can't blame you, heh
Wishful thinking, absolutely, but I think it'd be quite thought-provoking, personally, in a series with the name of one of the first proclaimed Vtubers in existence
I'm not so sure about that myself, personally, but it's probably because I'm hoping to see, say, inner motivations as to why people wanted to become a different self
I wonder how they'll play with the whole bit about becoming anyone who you want to be
In a sense, yes, but also because of the way it's framed
The premise seems intriguing, at least
Who knows?
it means people are noticing
I'm glad other people are posting it, lmao
https://twitter.com/G_Witch_M/status/1599267252137852928?s=20&t=14384AqBRdhZnBTqS37_cw Aerial's an ikemen?

G-Witch Twitter is now GUND-ARM Inc. social media
So, uh
a la *UNICORN*
I wonder if people will use *The Witch From Mercury* in memes
We got these two songs
But for the time being... https://lnk.to/g-witch-m
I wanna buy a physical version of the soundtrack, whenever that becomes a thing
YES. https://youtu.be/EZwdv8Vq0BQ
G-Witch Episode 9... ||Aerial has gone full Narrative||
I don't fully remember, but if I were to go by what I was told in the BTR Discord server, we might not see it in the show until a future season, if it ever happens
It depends on whether or not they will cover the particular scene in which they appear
the BTR anime Twitter even noted that scene from Slow Loop at least once
Yeah, apparently characters from the author's works tend to cameo in each other's works
Either directly or indirectly
On a related note, part of me wonders if the anime will at all cameo any other vtubers that exist as of the time of the animation
That's, of course, if such a character even exists in that anime
You've got a point there, heh. If they do, though, the important thing is the execution - the impact will be lessened if it's done badly.
||Guel may not get a choice in the matter because of how many L's he's taken in the first cours||
And I'm fairly certain that ||Guel's impending transfer is a part of those plans||
I think a big issue with that for me is ||Jeturk Heavy Machinery, particularly its CEO Vim Jeturk, have been basically doing nothing but oppose the Gundam in their ambition to become top dog of the Benerit Group||
As soon as it is announced, though, I'm on that shit
Probably not for the next month or two, though
It may drop in two parts, even, due to the split cours
but I imagine they will release it through BANDAI NAMCO Music Live, as SUNRISE Music did with other Gundam soundtracks
Assuming there exists one at all, anyway
And since the breed of long-runners is getting much less common, so too do opportunities to show off an anime festive episode
Actually, come to think of it, most series with a Christmas episode are either ones that run a long time, or are slice of life, aren't they?
say, like, Maidragon (which has featured it twice, I think, and New Year's also twice)
unless it's an adaptation which has some episodes that take place at that time
It's not exactly a common thing to have Christmas in anime, it feels like
I wasn't clear anyway
I got what you meant
Nah, it's k
just so we're clear on that
I will point out, Go-Busters is Super Sentai
and once it came around IRL, it was pretty late in the series so they had big plans for plot revelations and endgame for it
For context, END, Go-Busters' entire plot starts on Christmas Eve
THAT TOO
if it's anything like goddamn Go-Busters, baaaaaad shit is gonna happen that day
Think you're right. Wonder why I thought January...
one delay causing a ripple effect on G-Witch, lmao
DAMN YOU GOLF
But now first Cours pushes into January itself
Honestly, the two delays may explain why G-Witch second cours was pushed back to April, cause it was originally scheduled for January, wasn't it?
first golf, now TBS specials?
rather than ||Grilled Corn||
https://tenor.com/btio2.gif
Hopefully your birthday's more like...
... which means that the next episode is where we'll be hearing Haruka Shiraishi take up the role for the first time, isn't it?
Part of me wondered briefly if maybe Yume Miyamoto's sudden health issues were another reason they chose to hold back that episode, but there's no way to know for sure without trying to dig for information that clearly most of us shouldn't be concerned over (i.e. when they actually go in for the recording sessions); that being said, she managed to record up to Episode 9, long past the halfway point where we had the first schedule gap, so it's unlikely that this was the reason
I assume they're still going through R2?
Ah, that's still airing?
But in any case, I don't know the MBS/TBS schedule, and we're already past it
Ah, is that so? My only guess is that the consideration was taking into account other, perhaps more important programmes that needed to air after the golf was done, and that G-Witch was what needed to be axed to fit the schedule
oh no
~~don't you die on us now Millhi~~
I swore it was G-Witch, though...
Do you mean in the sense of an unexpected one? Well, no, I understand that they had to account for it... Or, hold on. Am I thinking of something else this season that got pushed back due to the golf?
It was more blue to me than the ReZEL was, lol (mostly in terms of deep blue, rather than the turquoise sort of colour that the ReZEL was)
This thing, or the other thing
https://tenor.com/z1Tm.gif
Or the Delta Plus?
Oh, the ReZEL?
Some of them are actually calls forward to Hathaway
There's a lot of curious MS in Unicorn itself
Congratulations, you just watched the origin of Bandai's biggest model kit money maker
She has now *twice* demonstrated the BTR Episode 4 scream outside of that recording session
https://vxtwitter.com/Zeroblade/status/1600461532357611520?s=20 *real life girl* making inhuman noises
~~also a lot of voting went into Kita that week because she was the only one of Kessoku Band to not be up there yet~~
As it stands, I think in terms of character change she's the least likely to undergo that, so interest probably remains steady for those who liked her and drops off for those who think she's stagnating
apparently later manga chapters expand on the person she's become, but we're unlikely to reach moments like that with the remaining three episodes
In general, she's sorta been through her life's story already
Barely, considering Ryo's reentry at position 10
And you're in a server that's centred around one of the biggest reasons for her success
I mean, that should tell you something about how popular she is
Before this channel turns into an erodoujin, I will mention we do have a thread for this week's episode so we don't clutter it up here
I lament that I can't yet see it
gonna have delling delay next week, lmao
Not much of the usual absurd animation this time around, but considering what's coming up, I don't think I mind
~~I find it hilarious that the first half of one particular episode of GBD:R was very evidently him because Episode 25 features a flashback as part of the script~~
That is true... Friggin' Fukuda, lmao
Since you're watching the original, you won't see either of those. Both cases IIRC are Aile Strike (Rouge) being replaced by a more elaborate backpack with hella gimmick for one particular fight in the series (that shows up in the eyecatches long before it shows up in animation)
particularly, each series featured a brand new MSV - Perfect Strike, and Strike Rouge Ootori
I see, I see. There's also changes beyond that in terms of different cuts and certain other things they introduced, too
As you might imagine, it didn't matter much to me personally since I watch in JP langauge track
I haven't really heard the opinions on the dubs myself, but it seems like I generally hear people prefer the original dub over the HD Remaster dub
If anyone does know, correct me if I'm wrong on the original dub studio for Gundam SEED
Think the original was Ocean Group? I know the HD Remaster is NYAV Post
Well, there's a warning about that, too - the dub *changes* between the TV version and the HD Remaster
Guess that's why you're breaking it up with Macross, though
4 parters if you watch Special Edition, or 48 episodes if you watch the HD Remaster
You'll wanna be careful with Gundam SEED and Gundam SEED Destiny - both are 50-episode watches
Just wanted to elaborate on this point a bit before I forgot. They have the Gustav Karl (retroactively referred to as the Type-13 upon the release of the Type-00 from Hathaway proper; as you might imagine from the wording, this MS first appeared in the novel version of Hathaway's Flash), and there's Funnel Missiles installed into the Kshatriya Repaired that shows up during Episode 7
Don't think he is, he says he's moving onto Cosmic Era next?
Such is the state of the industry...
Even if the end result looks amazing, it doesn't remove how much hell people go through to make it that way
It's not about that - it's about how they reach the end result
As Kyle said, most main protagonist Gundams are usually the latter.
But if that machine is completely bespoke, for example the Darilbalde, it'll simply be named without naming its pilot, since there's only one.
Guel's Dilanza, for example.
Generally that applies if it's a custom machine that's based on a mass-produced one
"MAPPA classic"
When looking back at the chat on the other server where that tweet was posted, someone else pretty much said the shorthand of what you did
My only guess is that they're just really disappointed that this probably could have been avoided - or at least lessened overall - since there's only a sole committee involved with the production, but the sounds of the tweet say that they barely meet deadlines despite that
Is that it? Is "Yes" the comment? lol
I have zero idea myself
https://twitter.com/sarcataclysmal/status/1601751588669771777 Anyone here got any commentary on this?
porkchop, lambchop
Oh, of course
And it's been the status quo ever since. It's a rare thing to see a protagonist Gundam unit without that colour scheme, and even things like Exia and F91 have traces of it somewhere on their body.
So its iconic tricolour of blue, yellow and red came to be, with the intent to appeal more to children, IIRC?
But even back during the creation of Gundam, the higher-ups were trying to market it
it was meant to be all white - a military tool
As iconic as it is, I think this is why he protested against the fact that the Gundam was turned into its iconic tricolour
The movie, I mean
It's supposed to, IIRC
Shit that would have taken us to <#336297840529899522>
I'll decline. I'd have gone on a rant about a world I still barely understand otherwise.
... there's something I would say in response to that, but I'm gonna cut myself off before I do
It's just business, at the end of the day
Anaheim have the monopoly on MS tech
Some people still debate that, for whatever reason...
Then again, the origin of GP04 Gerbera is in itself quite messy - unless you simply roll with G Gen
~~granted, it's the Gerbera Tetra but still~~
wdym, she already had one
https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/gundam/images/8/8b/Kirara_Profile_pic.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20131028163426
Not sure, but the entire fandom was memeing the shit out of it when ED3's visuals were first shown in Episode 9

He's also sort-of become Sunrise's go-to guy for U.C. cinematic music, having done so for Unicorn, Narrative and Hathaway
but he was apparently a hot composer before then in Japan, thanks to other works he did before he got his big anime break
Sawano is *everywhere* in anime thanks to AoT and KLK
and yes, this includes bringing out a human size version of the GN Long Blade and GN Short Blade
They even have props attached to them to simulate the weapons of the mobile suits, which are held and swung by the *stage actors* during combat
You should see the stage props they had for the cockpits, they are nuts
Very carefully.
A *musical* is surprising, but the idea of manga/anime turned theatre is not
Gundam 00, Persona, Death Note... All got turned into stage plays
So something like this is not as surprising as you might think
Theatre adaptations of Japanese media have been a thing for a long time
In any case, I'll head to bed
Cause let's be honest, his entire motivation for becoming Mafty was to bring down the system which caused such tragedy to occur in the first place
Eh, I have not yet seen CCA personally, but do you even think the dude will change much if he did?
It's *how* that affects things, if any, that we're on the lookout for
I mean, by the very nature of taking place after CCA and not Beltorchika's Children, you kinda already have an altered premise
Hopefully we get to see it in action in Son of Bright
Events, we will have to see. Odysseus exists, though, which was a G Gen change
Messer is divided into two (F01 is standard, F02 is a match for the novel), same with Gustav Karl (Type-0 is novel equivalent, Type-13 is a predecessor from Unicorn)
There already is, at least MS wise
*Someone's been watching it*
https://open.spotify.com/track/0JUdNScTFs37m9dFGC07qp?si=b5ac91ce1c594153
and then there's Build Divers Re:RISE...
So you never saw the Colony Laser moment of the series
That's what I'm saying, though. In a sense, you should have seen this coming - especially if you saw PROLOGUE
If you were expecting Gundam to not go dark, then you were looking in the wrong place, my dude
Aside from Build, expect at least one superweapon per series - or a big hunk of material falling to Earth
literally, straight up nukes, in addition to laser superweapons
Meanwhile, you have... what seem like endless nukes in Cosmic Era (Gundam SEED/SEED Destiny)
Memento Mori in Gundam 00 - A laser built on the Orbital Ring that can obliterate a city using solar power from the towers
After War Gundam X - the war in question was as if you had UC but nobody held back, and Earth is reduced to a wasteland for it
Almost every series in Gundam has a colony drop or colony laser happen, or something else that equates to a nuclear disaster. And lots of people die for it.
And if he does stop journeying, I feel like it's a fitting end to the journey
Ash will still journey on, I reckon, but the focus will finally shift away from him
unfortunately she does *not* have an identical twin with dead eyes
Now that you point it out, that basically is Lillie, lmao
that Latias one is not gonna make al ick of sense to anyone who hasn't seen the film, lmao
and that ain't her hair
I'd disagree with it being "bulk standard", personally, but fair enough, I guess?
I wanted to watch Heartcatch Pretty Cure myself
Right on time, I guess, cause episode 11 of 12 is to air in literally less than an hour in Japan
I should look up more Takanori Nishikawa voice roles, they're few and far between but they're usually pretty significant, wherever he shows up
Wait, which?
*Sigh...* Guess I'll have to concede this time. I'd prefer if you not mention them to me personally, though
...
Don't mention them directly, m8
not sure where to do so, though
YOASOBI stickers + Aerial snackfood stickers
cause then I could make the most cursed Gundam Aerial
I wish I could get Aerial Fresh Tomato, though
I mean, I *do* have the YOASOBI Demi-Trainer...
~~and if you can find them, Aerial's very hard to find because of how absurdly popular it is~~
even his motherfucking character from Thunderbolt Fantasy
so it accompanies him wherever he goes
The reason for it is simply because that's literally his favourite colour
Both have that same shade of orange
As well as Miguel Aiman's custom GINN?
Ever seen the colour on some of his albums?
Orange is just... Nishikawa's colour scheme
00's a pretty good choice, all things considered, haha
Ah yeah, that's right, you have Heine's Destiny as well
if you have him pilot the Destiny (or his personal unit, too), he'll actually have quotes about the Concluders
https://youtu.be/l3aTWNd_8Lg
There's some cool things about Heine in G Generation Cross Rays, actually
No guesses as to why the model number has "REVOLUTION" in it
each an elite pilot with a Destiny Gundam
Concluders, they were called
there's a whole lore about a group that was meant to be, but it never did because the war ended and Heine also bit the dust
supposedly tuned specifically for Heine himself, according to the lore on the HGCE model (and its recent appearance as DLC for GGCR)
basically just an orange Destiny
Typically a limited Gunpla model for each version of the Destiny, painted in Nishikawa's favourite orange
https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/gunplabuilders/images/a/a7/HGCE-Destiny-Gundam-Heine-box.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20190727025755
Full name: **ZGMF-X42S-REVOLUTION Destiny Gundam (Heine Westenfluss Custom)**
... yes, that *is* the full model number for his model
the ZGMF-X42S-REVOLUTION
I feel like his personal Destiny should be, if he himself isn't
Gundam SEED PROJECT ignited answered his call, after a long time
he'd apparently always tell fans "SEED isn't over yet!"
I dunno why, but whenever Nishikawa is mentioned I feel compelled to mention how he never, *ever* gave up on Gundam SEED
he's also faithful to Cosmic Era, to a crazy degree
sung a song for it and everything
he became Enterprise for an Azur Lane anniversary
this man has NO fucking hesitation, I swear
a reminder that he was once this
https://tenor.com/bs6IO.gif
goddamnit Nishikawa, lmao
That's what you meant
**OH**
At least, that is what I understand of manga title absurdity
Cause otherwise, how is it supposed to, without any hint of legacy behind it like Dragon Ball?
They dump everything about the series premise into the title so that it can appeal to you that way
Such is the way manga has to be marketed these days, it feels like
it'll be supervised by the author, that being said
and the movie's said to be an all original story, so nothing that exists in the manga right now (supposedly)
If anything, that'll probably be in Season 2
An original story for theatre, too...
I'll be down for that
Oh, well there you go.
you'll probably see it on Reddit or something eventually
I'm not sure if I wanna post the clip here, though, out of respect for the person who made it (and since it's not watermarked)
I will say, BTR server is ahead of you on that one, lol
been impossible since 1979, even
Bandai Try Not To Turn Key Object Into Merchandise Challenge (100% IMPOSSIBLE)
so things like this are kind-of an inevitability for merch-driven franchises
To be fair, too, they will appear in things like games and promotional material beyond their series
there are very few times where they've tried to conceal certain ones, though the only example I can recall is ||Re:Rising Gundam||, a special four-kit bundle, because it was to be revealed in the show the day the kit released
Merch will almost always spoil things *way* ahead of time
Such is the problem with both Gunpla and tokusatsu
... though with that being said, Yuri Lowenthal is a quite high amount of Peter Parkers over the years, particularly Marvel's Spider-Man by Insomniac for recent reprisals
I don't know if I'd count on Keaton or Lowenthal reprising their roles as their respective Spideys, personally, lol
Not all the time depending on what media you've seen. If you played MvC3, you'd have heard him there, too
that Holder shirt is pretty sick, not gonna lie
just so you wouldn't confuse it with the company responsible for Metal Slug, Fatal Fury, The King of Fighters, Psycho Soldier and so on
in fact I'm fairly sure that when they made Attack on Titan as a game, they had to call it A.O.T. and A.O.T. II even in Japan
I never liked abbreviating it to SNK because of... well, SNK Corporation existing
https://tenor.com/bOr35.gif
... snk?
**DAMN**
also, I just noticed HIDIVE is now available in my region. Wonder when that happened
Gonna be hard to top, huh?
Lasts until April, probably when they start the new cours...
I only say this cause IMO, Bokita shipping has gone a little outta hand...
though if I'm being honest, it's not all sunshine and rainbows over there, either
Makes me feel a little better about the fact that the western side of CSM fans on Twitter were trying their hardest to make BTR fans look bad
That is... a sharp contrast that I didn't expect
And yet the overseas fans seem to be treating it like a gift from God or smth
Damn, Japanese antis are really scathing about that point? I didn't realise this wasn't just limited to the guy with the Bocchi avatar that's inadvertently making the rest of that fanbase look worse than it is
CSW to avoid the main CSM crowd
... oh god, that's kinda hilarious, that last point you made
I get you there
that was the vibe I got from the entire Asuno lineage in their protagonist appearances
... probably because a lot of them WERE that young tbh
||remained a virgin until his death||
his entire life
apparently there's a whole buncha problems between the fam
No, that's what I mean
people are pretty savage, it feels like, when it comes to envisioning the alternative future where Flit Asuno married Yurin L'Ciel and lived a happier life than his current one at the time of the Asemu Arc
Height chart...
Oh wait

<@152896851660505088> So... Is this what you're talking about when it comes to the production hell of G-Witch? (Also CSM?) https://twitter.com/SFLSNZYN/status/1606351441165451264
5 volumes, too
Yeah, uh, we've got about ~60 chapters of Bocchi the Rock thus far
||What the fuck are you talking about? We've only gone through 21 chapters... There's a LOT more material, and Hamazi-sensei's also got ideas for what she wants to do in the future so the material will only grow||
***AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA*** ||https://youtu.be/1-o7fmQqSNg||
(Bocchi the Rock! Real PV)
so yeah, more or less 2017/2018
Right on the tail end of December 2017, according to what I see thus on the wiki
2017 at earliest, I think?
it was barely two years old by the time kerorira first brought it up to the future director, 2019
Wait, 2017? I don't even know if Bocchi the Rock existed back then, and if it did, it would have been pretty early into its serialisation
I'll not deny Bokita, but keep it within reason
Fair enough, heh. Honestly, I am mostly complaining because I wish for it to not reach those levels myself
~~actually the thing that annoys me most about Bokita is the fact that one of Yoshino Aoyama's (few) friends that she knew before working together on BTR was Ikumi Hasegawa, which only adds more fuel to the fire of Bokita shipping~~
I have not gone to the dark side to see just how far the fanart's been taken, personally
It was just the most notable example I could think of, tbh
edited into a kiss
where Kita goes in for a hug
Episode 5 edit scene in particular
them
https://twitter.com/kerorira1/status/1606590505357553664
Frankly, I know that ship has gone too far when people are editing in smooches between the two
This honestly does not help matters one bit, lmao
Ryo ain't right in the head, and she only realised it then
and also breaking the illusion in Episode 9, lmao
literally anything people could find in the show that was red and pink was being taken as a sign that the anime staff were shipping Bokita
but the search for any sign of Bokita went overboard during the last few episodes
I will say this to their credit: Part of it is because Kita attends the same school as Bocchi
more than the initial ship which got Kita to join Kessoku Band in the first place (Ryo-senpai)
cause there's a lot of Bocchi/Kita scenes in the anime
Not even the wars, just the insistence that something is there
Manga equivalent
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/926228463067729982/1056296730494238810/SPOILER_wow.jpg
I feel like I'm not surprised by the fact that one of the more prominent cases of harassment caused him to start blocking every Bozaro avatar he sees, cause it could absolutely be (mistakenly?) taken as hostile from a fellow seasonal anime which has overall been faring much better than the show he's directing
If I were him, I'd also probably have popped a vessel if I was dealing with that sort of harassment on a regular basis
honestly, it's no wonder he ended up blocking every Bocchi avatar he's come across
I know a lot of people were disappointed about the "Damn straight" moment, or at least it seemed that way when I heard
https://tenor.com/buFpZ.gif
meanwhile, we had to deal with this back in the 90's
that *incredibly intricate hand movement* to pop people like you're using the fucking Cyclops System
Oh, I've definitely seen examples of that
Guess I'll have to take a look at some clips again at some point, perhaps I'd look at it differently
Ah
Wait, for Bleach, or CSM? Just to clarify
... so basically, we are still not at a point where shit came crashing down?
Guess that's fair. I'm not the most discerning eye myself
Well, I'll have to see more for myself, I guess
Oh? lol
I mean, I can't deny how well it's animated, at least. I've not seen much from it, but it's not all rose-tinted glasses
I'm fairly sure the CSM fans will probably be rattled more than FMA:B fans will, tbh
It's definitely been hitting high evaluations everywhere after its finale
It hit 9.00 on MAL, from what I saw. I don't know how long that'll last, but...
in the original manga, apparently it's just Bocchi lying down while freaking out, and the subsequent attention-whore monster Bocchi Time segment doesn't have her be snapped out of it by the rest of Kessoku Band afterwards
things like glitchy Bocchi in Episode 4, for example
Admittedly, I only think this way cause in the case of Bozaro, several of its scenes were modified or expanded upon compared to the original 4koma
in terms of both direction and fan response to it
It's just hearsay on the side of CSM, admittedly, but it feels like Bocchi the Rock has been almost the complete opposite in several aspects to it
This kinda amazes me
Wonder how the western fans who are the complete opposite opinion feel about this
It's gotten to *that* point, huh?
Well ***damn***
Don't tell me the name of this GitHub is HIATUSxHIATUS
Wait, hiatus-hiatus in the URL?
more like krr bias, I swear
this ship legit gives me ulcers
No English publisher has picked up Bochiro, no
Bocchi moves forward, one step at a time, to face her own anxiety and problems
And unlike a lot of stories, the change is gradual and realistic
No pressure, haha. Take all the time you need - I can't recommend the series enough, after having watched it myself
Yep, that's the clip!

||All but stated that Hiroi's suffering from depression, yeah||
so you're saying that post-Kessoku Band Hitori Gotoh would have a *weaker* AT Field overall
oh GOD
Funny story, VOMS Project vtuber Pikamee said the exact same thing.

And take it from me personally: I can understand the sentiment. I watched anyway because it really does resonate with me positively, but I can understand how it may push buttons that you may not want to have pushed.

If anything, that double-edged sword is - at least IMO - a huge point as to why I think the series is great
but given they also dropped their self-titled album recently, we still have that to talk about
It's safe to say a lot of us are still trying to cope with the fact that it's over, lol
Needless to say, she was gushing pretty hard about the incredible opportunity to use Ajikan for the anime
If I were to guess, it's likely that Aki Hamazi chose this song to be Bocchi's character ED because it was the most fitting for her personality
and all the episode titles reference songs they've made
Shouldn't be surprising that it is an Ajikan song, though, because it's the author's all-time favourite band
Bocchi's character ED, the series' final ED, and the *only* cover on the entire album
This is also up there, too https://youtu.be/H7ZyZdqLb5Q?list=OLAK5uy_mNWkxcU6VC_aWOFnpqYha-J5UMzwbVlx4
One of the album original songs that was never used in the show itself, it is used during their recently dropped "real PV", which features a series montage of moments from Episode 1 all the way to Episode 12
My personal favourite of the *Kessoku Band* album is this song, *Flashbacker*
https://youtu.be/ecVnw_SiREQ?list=OLAK5uy_mNWkxcU6VC_aWOFnpqYha-J5UMzwbVlx4
(of course, that also goes for the first ED, which is Kita's ED)
basically, every song except for the character EDs will have Ikumi Hasegawa as Ikuyo Kita on vocals
https://tenor.com/b0fU7.gif
the song where Ikuyo Kita flips the bird (and Nijika Ijichi is on vocals)
Nani ga warui/What is wrong with
https://youtu.be/h1uTWpCySRo?list=OLAK5uy_mNWkxcU6VC_aWOFnpqYha-J5UMzwbVlx4
Oh wow, a new Aimer single as the OP, and amazarashi like the DLC for the ED?
Well, in this case, the game is the original work and the BNP animation is the adaptation, but yeah
I don't think I'd have heard all the OPs in the bracket
SOUVENIR is one of those songs you'd probably see analysed by someone who knows music theory, I'll be frank. I'd love to see someone break down that song and why the key is the way it is there
I like both songs equally, personally, but I've been finding myself drawn more to Mixed Nuts as of late cause I just *love* the instrumentation
Oh? You like SOUVENIR more than Mixed Nuts, huh?
Vengeance, damn

Such is the importance of knowing the names in the industry, heh
things that tend to even leak out into some other, *non-H* stuff he's done
and he did things
all I'm getting out of this conversation is a reminder that Masami Obari is a thing
and we're about to enter a *year of yuri anime*
it lives on, but as a brand instead of a company
... then again, of course, we kinda don't *have* a Sunrise anymore as a company thanks to the merger
no more reservations about referencing Gundam and Gunpla at their leisure after March 2020 (unless networks rights have anything to say, as usual)
I think the reason they're allowed to do that with non-Sunrise works now is because of the eventual full acquisition of Sotsu by Bandai Namco Group, haha
maybe one day we'll have a Love Live that's set in Fukuoka and we can see the SIDE-F version of Nu Gundam instead
where the Unicorn stands
at least one trip to Diver City Tokyo for certain
Was gonna say, they did that with Love Live, didn't they?
they're basically free to do that
cause they're all under the same parent company, lol
hence why I said Bandai Namco Filmworks instead, since they're all under that now
Was Birdie Wing a Sunrise series? I thought it was Bandai Namco Pictures
meaning that Bandai Namco Filmworks is fighting against itself
which is by Bandai Namco Pictures
specifically, Birdie Wing Season 2
No, it'll be *competing* against Golf
like, the full things
I'm probably just gonna do the insane thing and try to locate all the BD boxes themselves
cause of all the BGM you can only get in the JP BD releases
... tbh, I'm still having thoughts about getting the Japanese BDs myself, even though I have the character song box already
Ahahahahaha
The power of SauceNAO and all the other reverse searching tools
Me, I found it mostly because I wanted a place to talk about a series I love, especially after the realisation that "holy shit, it's the 10th anniversary this year" by sheer coincidence when I decided that I'd finally finish watching XV
I see, I see. Curious, haha
G-Witch in April:
https://tenor.com/view/kamen-rider-revice-meme-kamen-rider-boorjwazee-tokusatsu-gif-23683522
Bandai Namco Filmworks really be out there to compete against itself in April
and then it's gotta **air alongside golf**
oh yeah, one more Delling Delay before final ep of the cours
Maybe if you do plan a future trip to Japan, you could visit Diver City Tokyo and watch Unicorn light up
though I mostly only did so because one of those seasonals was, of course, big robo yuri
Seems like this year kinda did something to us both in terms of anime, if I'm being honest, cause this was the first time I've ever decided "I'm gonna watch seasonal anime *while it's relevant*"
To be fair, though, I myself only joined this server this year because I caught up on something I had long put off - watching Symphogear XV
**Damn.** Didn't realise you were *that* recent to Symphogear, haha
Cause if so, **damn**
Wait, did that also include Symphogear?
Most likely, yeah
Oh, really now? Already starting with ||Ending B||?
almost looks forced
that's a huge smile from chuchu there
https://youtu.be/96GDralVKOA This woman was **destined** to be Bocchi, dear god
Third, in this case
the first was during *Bocchi the Radio!* in an episode where Aoyama was also hosting entirely by herself
While it has been shared before, I always love this video because it was the *second* time she has demonstrated it
But you've already heard me say this exact point, so I'll cut myself off before repeating the whole thing again
I was a fighting game fan first before AoT became assimilated into the masses
the latter is why I always use AoT myself
Shingeki no Kyoshin... or SNK Corporation
IDK why I always bring that example up, but...
Would you say the same or not about AoT vs SnK?
this goddamn Eurobeat from *2007*
https://youtu.be/TcgixpZS6hQ actually this
https://youtu.be/CVTTn7Q1v64 Did I forget to post this here?
Wait, so you're saying...
https://open.spotify.com/track/4XScunWTatagh0YbAaDVck?si=2b58a3a82b7c4530
while there were many others who were gonna have a shot there, it seems like her mind was set on who the main protag would end up being just based on that, lmao
Actually, you know what gets me? Apparently, Aoyama was second to audition in the studio, and her delivery made Hamazi-sensei laugh
truly a real life bocchi
This is probably why she's so loopy, especially at the end part of the above clip, lmao
As you can see, it was all Bocchi Time this episode, as she was hosting alone this time around
The Bocchi the Radio episode in question... https://youtu.be/bCNwtnv-3Qk
https://youtu.be/ZDVAyVJQa9c From the latest Bocchi the Radio... Yoppi's despair really shows
tbh the only thing I've seen from Goblin Slayer aside from this and some occasional fanart was a compilation I came across which showed off the titular Slayer's Goblin total kill count in the anime
This scene, right?

they're Slow Loop's main characters
I don't have the image on me, but it's Eliza's keychains
perhaps I should have said "anime" instead of "animated"
's true, it really is just one frame...
By technicality, that is indeed correct - Kessoku Band's first animated appearance was for a single still frame at a school culture festival in Slow Loop
so the cameos carry over during their anime adaptations
As for why, it's apparently because they like to cameo in each other's respective works in the original manga format
Bozaro, naturally, paid the favour back to Slow Loop in its own Episode 10
well, good thing you're watching now cause there's a Bocchi the Rock cameo in Episode 10, lmao
Oh? Someone else watching sloop?
... I don't know if I'd go that far
and this isn't even getting into the actual production hell of the show itself
preproduction hell, corporate restructuring, golf(?) and holidays saying "fuck your anime timeslot"
someone wise once told me that Rent-A-Girlfriend is the only series in which you're wishing for your best girl to *lose* the shipping war
and I never usually participate, cause frankly I'm not really interested
most of the time I see conversation about it, it's in a different server from this (which isn't even anime centred) where it seems like every other conversation in their anime text channel is about it
This is honestly the most I've even talked about Kanokari to anyone, tbh
just cause they have such a hate-on for the plot (and possibly the author) that they just Stockholm Syndrome their way through it to see where it goes next
seems like most people I talk to who get into kanokari get into it for that specific reason
oh god krr pls
I was gonna say, is it because people who really care about anime are starting to get into that sort of business in those countries?
Wait, Ace Combat references?
I am SO thankful they didn't beat around the bush with that
It was only a matter of time, really
I feel like it'd be very surprising if a Gundam veteran didn't see this turn of events coming, honestly
Granted, it did start off lighter than a lot of other Gundam series did
Because they probably didn't know what they were getting into
... well, not really, lol
oh shit, NKODICE
AH YEAH, IT DID!
it put GBD:R on the level of the original Gundam Build Fighters for me
Sniper episode 18, some real high stakes ||- higher than any other Gundam Build before it because it turned into **real Gundam**||, and a ragtag bunch of misfits with some real character development which I enjoyed
A lot of that was fixed for me in GBD:R, *and then some*
Characters, also... Not exactly great depth to them
(Plus, not as much attachment to the risk of Gunpla being destroyed outright, because it didn't exist in most instances)
Me, I liked GBD, but always criticised the fact that it takes... a bit too long for the big, endgame threat to show itself, and it was a little more SOL compared to the ongoing stakes of the "wanna be a master" format of its alternate universe predecessor
Congratulations, you've stumped me with an opinion that was contrary to most others
Wow... This is an opinion I never thought I would come across.
~~now get 'em to watch tomatoes~~
I have yet to see it for myself, though
people have been singing praises of MagiRevo as a manga, so I can't say I'm entirely surprised?
lest they risk releasing multiple versions over generations
A console release will likely have to come at end of life for arcade
Team Try Fighters, a bunch of Narrative stuff, more Gundam Build in general...
as well as the NEXTREME Gundams
new burst types, new units, all that stuff
there is so much Gundam Build exclusive to arcade right now that people are hoping EXVS.2OB marks the time we get a console release of the game
Core Gundam is coming
Well, EXVS2 OverBoost is now a thing in the works
because everyone loved that moment as it was with Mai Fuchigami
go straight to Episode 13 to hear one Lauren Landa say TAXIIIIIII
I love how everyone had the same brain cell when the first season dub of GBD:R was uploaded to GundamInfo
also, dear god, speaking of GBD:R dub
much more effort put into it than the GBF English dub did
Gotcha. I would imagine you wouldn't want to draw a ridiculous amount of power, though, unless you wanted to melt your entire airframe
This is legit the first time I have ever heard of them add a life-size statue to a game
https://youtu.be/Z5D8lLNlSTw
Holy shit, get a load of this
THIS THING'S **PLAYABLE?!**
https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/gundam/images/c/c4/Ff-nu_XBoost.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20230105100719 WAIT
apparently, this also required a modification of the unit itself (hence the designation), where the Long Range Fin Funnel could connect directly to the Gundam's generator
That is how the Long Range Fin Funnel came to be, in-universe
apparently, due to the solitary firepower of the Fin Funnels being insufficient (despite being a revolutionary weapon capable of offense and defense), Anaheim Electronics proposed combining the Fin Funnel with the Hyper Mega Bazooka Launcher (yes, from the Hi-Nu!)
... random, but I just found out the RX-93ff Nu Gundam has actual lore
long story short, a superior being was closer to carbon-neutral mobile suit usage
created afterimages of his machine in the process
And yeah, Shinn tended to use Mirage Colloid with the Wings of Light very often, didn't he?
... basically going Extreme Blast Mode
I do ask, on that note... Despite "unlimited power", can MS powered by nuclear reactors use a huge amount of that power at once? (Without blowing up, anyway)
One could simply say that Shinn overdid it in terms of power consumption
specifically, they speculate that the prototype nature of Destiny may have caused its power reserves to be drained to critical
This one is something that not even the original site for GSD is able to answer, but they do offer a possibility
I don't think that's what the Hyper Deuterion Engine was... It was supposed to be basically combining the Deuterion Beam Energy Transfer System with an ultracompact nuclear reactor, resulting in superior power compared to previous nuclear-powered MS
episode 2 got delayed because part of it involved an assassination plot
Yeah, it was TEPPEN!!!!!!! (with more exclamation points than what I just typed)
In any case, I gotta catch some Z's
My knowledge obviously did not consider the scope of batteries much greater in capacity than the one that's currently in my Xbox Core Controller
It's mostly just, like... relative to what I knew of Cosmic Era technology
Not even model kit lore saves us
Mind you, the first unit deployed which used a HDE was Destiny... and we all know what that thing was supposed to be used for
I know it's Cosmic Era tech and all that, but fuck, man, it makes that shit sound WEAK
... I guess I'm just annoyed at using "battery" to describe it
Logically, I guess it makes sense - power storage (and the price to pay for lacking it) has been a plot point many a time in Gundam
I have never heard this consensus myself
It's a weird thing to say that the Hyper-Deuterion Engine is somehow a combo of nuke and beam transfer that's superior to both, and never show a beam transfer once... But there's no real choice, considering the only ship capable of sending those beams to such a unit is on the side of ZAFT
I did specify the HDE units...
Going by game appearances, anyway
but apparently they're rumoured to still be capable of it?
should be noted that they never actually seem to use the energy beam transfer in the show itself for any of the HDE units, IIRC
it's clearly more than just a fucking battery, though
https://tenor.com/bhiG1.gif
~~sorry, was reminded of Wangan Midnight Maximum Tune of all things...~~
and a battle you lose to dumb writing has no meaning
do you think the IP holders just looked at the proposition and went *ruh-roh*
... then again, is Norville's characterisation the least of their sins with *Velma?*
But I don't know if anyone's looking at Norville all that fondly in this show.
Shaggy's an affectionate nickname at this point, is it not?
... my point, though, is that that nickname don't exist in this adaptation
Does he even deserve to be called Shaggy when he's not really Shaggy?
also he isn't even called Shaggy, right?
think it's time for me to bounce before I get caught up in the catfight
I'm watching NieR:Automata Ver. 1.1a myself, though only one ep is out of course
also psychic bullshit once a series, in most of them
War is bad
Tomino's message warped
Feddies are a menace

That's my summary
If not, have I just gotten really bad at identifying the eyes? Cause I swear her hair wasn't that flat in shading...
Isn't that a Season 1 image of Tsubasa? lol
I feel like it's unlikely, as much I desperately want that to actually happen
probably Ending A/B for first cours, then Ending C/D/E for second
I realised pretty quick that they would not be able to wrap up the story in 12
Okay, I'm relieved about that cause I was thinking about the pace at which the story was advancing relative to the source material
I'm trying to find out who did the music for that OP, cause I'm wondering if it was anyone from MONACA
Either way, I guess I'll have to tide myself over with escalate on repeat
Do we know how many are planned, on that note?
Which'll be relatively soon, I guess
~~does anyone wanna take bets that the blame will be placed on COVID~~
Do we have the official word yet?
Time for NieR Re:broadcast, huh
<@152896851660505088> https://twitter.com/bgette0/status/1615998432459595777
Trust me, I've already seen so many people ask about it over in Bocchicord
<@404782531582623744> You'll be waiting until April/May to hear it
Vol. **5** Blu-Ray is the one that'll have it
The success should easily tell them that it's worth consideration, though
which, obviously, is not the case (unlike SPY x FAMILY for example)
they'd only have announced a Season 2 at the end of the series if they intended to do so from the start
The only prevention, really, is that it takes time and money to get these things going
I don't think they intended on the real-world circumstances making this episode name rather prophetic
**THE TITLE OF EPISODE 3**
https://twitter.com/NieR_A_ANIME/status/1616812870703915010?t=EOOaKPSy8D4Lo_3ujG5BJw&s=19 LMAO HOLY SHIT <@152896851660505088>
Makes me wonder how much percentage of the next season will somehow get delayed
So is COVID just turning the entire anime industry into hell on Earth?
We'll at the very least see one last performance from the definitive Batman come *Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League*
Maybe I should pick up Onimai at some point, but I've been kinda drained this week to do anything aside from my Forza dailies
I see, I see
Isn't that also the day Super Hero Time airs? Though I dunno if there was any other thing that indicated what they were referencing during that scene
... I still have yet to finish ZZ and watch CCA
First Gundam is the essential to understand most everything else in the UC, so yeah, I'd agree with that
... stuff like that
who cares what Gundam I watch first? It's much, much more than the old 80's anime it began from
Gatekeeping is just... *ugh* to me
I hate that I have been that person in the past, too
nobody likes that guy
That statement remains true, though - just *don't* be that guy
Pffffff
don't be that guy
why are you that guy
Well, it *was* a 4koma originally
so it's a lost Gundam Wing theme song, in spirit
but it is worth noting that it was composed with it in mind
That wasn't actually in any way tied to Frozen Teardrop, not officially anyway
Same energy

https://tenor.com/view/nana-wills-it-england-for-nana-listen-to-your-nana-gif-11297286
i.e. you just remove the layers and rearrange them as needed
I wonder if the engineering involves making it so that you *don't* need to find alternate parts
So this thing appears to be a parts swap type transformation, but engineered in a way that makes this process real quick
celebrating 40 years of Macross
High Grade 1/100 YF-19
there's a new High Grade, holy shit
Speaking of Macross... https://youtu.be/FAOZH0_nKvQ
At the very least, I'd hope that the engineering allows that process to be quick once you do have those parts
Oh, I think I see how this works. Yeah, I guess it is parts for the various transformations being swapped out

**DEN-ON-BU Part 2 - Prologue** *(Released 2022.3.20 @ 00:00)*
Download & Streaming: https://nex-tone.link/VVtnVZJj5
**IT'S TIME.**
Today on DENONBU: A 2nd LIVE debut marks the return of a previous music producer... and an omen of things to come.
https://twitter.com/denonbu/status/1505197401946042369?s=20&t=iVLj5GlsaaNFIKuwihLxvw
Held at PACIFICO Yokohama is **DEN-ON-BU 2nd LIVE -BREAK DOWN-,** the second live event for the music & character project by BANDAI NAMCO Entertainment! These are the links for overseas streaming tickets, which went live a week ago. You've seen me mention it a few times already in the server, and I regret that I wasn't able to plug it sooner due to how recently I decided to join the server, but if you are still somehow interested then feel free to follow the links!

Of course, I'll be watching... But what will happen over there?
https://twitter.com/denonbu/status/1502449298490871810
This was posted a while back... and the concert's first segment is in less than 12 hours. But regardless, I figure I would plug it anyway.
Now, to introduce the cast.
**Akiba Area - Sotokanda Bungei High School**
> Reina Hidaka ü§ñ (CV: Yuuka Shidomi) <:ReinaWow2:905055639431163924>, Kazune Shinonome üéÆ (CV: Miho Amane) <:KazuneFlustered:905055934064234568>, Futaba Kayano üé§ (CV: Sena Horikoshi) <:FutabaEh:905056012120240139>
**Harajuku Area - Jingumae Sando High School**

**Azabu Area - Minato Shirokane Girls High School**
> Tama Kurogane üòº (CV: Akina) <:TamaBattle:927928762677481542>, Aki Shirokane üí∞ (CV: Arisa Komiya) <:AkiBattle:927928804104601660>, Ginka Hajima üç¥ (CV: Azuki Shibuya) <:GinkaWave:905057034964205599>
**Shibuya Area - Teion International High School**
> Karin Houou üî• (CV: Kana Sukoya) <:KarinBlush:905057166191394817>, Mitsuki Seto ||(Real name: Mitsuki Hidaka)|| üåä (CV: Sister Claire) <:MitsukiBattle:927928784131338280>, Lucia Taiga ‚ö° (CV: Sara Hoshikawa) <:LuciaBattle:927928792108908604>

Yes, you read that right. There are vtubers in this cast! In fact, they actually set out to cast idols as one area (Akiba Area cast members are all under DEARSTAGE), and vtubers as another (Shibuya Area cast members are all from NIJISANJI, and DENONBU is actually one of the reasons Sukoya had to go on a 9 month streaming hiatus!), while rounding out the cast with voice actors for Harajuku and Azabu.

I do apologise if this is a somewhat large ramble taking up a lot of space. If it's not okay to do this, lemme know - I can get rather carried away if given the chance.
A brief introduction: DENONBU is a multimedia franchise by BANDAI NAMCO Entertainment that, in their words, is a music & character project. Taking place in a fictional near future where electronic dance music has taken over the world and DJ battles are judged by an AI reacting to the performance and the crowd, the main cast features 12 characters (at this time; that may change in the near future) that are split into Areas, each Area representing a style of EDM that is most frequent and/or popular in that district of Tokyo.
So, I mentioned DENONBU in some other channels before, and you've definitely seen me use emotes from it. But here, you will see what it's really about: The music!

Man, I love when I join a new server and it has a music channel, cause I go *ham* with it
https://youtu.be/duqb8xP3Ptk
Nearly two years of anticipation have led to this
I had a childhood with this game, my god
rather than full verses in one language, then switching to another
I usually like to use aLIEz as my example because of how fast the language keeps switching in the chorus
and somehow the lyrics connect together
aLIEz alone rapidfires Japanese, English and German in the chorus, sometimes as fast as a single word of each in a single line
She's long since moved on from her days working with Hiroyuki Sawano, but her lyricist work with him will always stand out to me for this reason
When I think about that statement, I think about Mika Kobayashi and the kinds of lyrics she writes

Ask Bandai Namco... and Monolithsoft.
Relevant considering I have begun doing so myself
Huh. Someone managed to find the song that was used in the teaser for *Mobile Suit Gundam: The Witch from Mercury* https://youtu.be/pIe_mp0kKoA
https://solidstatejapan.bandcamp.com/album/dr-neon
This song just makes me feel inspired and empowered

YOUKOSO
ATARASHII SEKAI E
It's sung by Yu-Na Fukinbara, who previously did *You're my perfect mirror,* the ED for Part 1
but I really like the new OP song
https://youtu.be/DsW7amhx9Lg Well, I forgot that AMAIM Warrior at the Borderline Part 2 had started and only just caught up with the episodes released thus far
https://youtu.be/XmoN0z9dPw0
Why chuchu?
The funny thing about this song? I discovered it not through the anime it was an opening for (Fire Force OP2), but because I was interested in a *different* song of theirs (REVOLUTION, the opening to MOBILE SUIT GUNDAM EXTREME VS.2)

I have forgotten exactly which one, but I will never forget that I was introduced to this music through a JonTron video which very briefly used it https://youtu.be/MiZnU41z868
but in either case, I don't really know the whole picture
The only reason I have to believe that they might not is the stipulation for why Monolithsoft accepted the Nintendo buyout
I wonder how they decide on songs like this, even, for things like Bandori or D4DJ, in terms of covers
It appears that it is a D4DJ thing
See, I wondered cause I thought you were talking about the actual author
Oh, THOSE segments
Bkub Okawa, huh?
I already posted this in <#337805317276565525> a little while back, but my god, I am *way* too obsessed with this song right now https://youtu.be/UK23wjuC1I4
Day by day, time slowly takes away the things we grew up with... Whether we realise it or not.
Oh, wow... Another legend leaves us, huh? <:ChrisPray:672578403156885504>

Did you know that Yuzo Koshiro has his own YouTube channel?

No? And don't know who he is? Well, fair enough, lol. I'll let his music - and his credentials, the likes of which include Streets of Rage, ActRaiser, Wangan Midnight and Etrian Odyssey - speak for themselves. (For the time being, anyway.)
https://youtu.be/AZaJHQSYw90
Yuzo Koshiro with a secret project?
https://youtu.be/w6tYPl2BvHw
Though I only realised this a few days after the package that contained my copy of the single came in the mail (which happened to be the day before the movie's release, in fact).
I am retreading ground here, I know, but I wanted to repost this song after realising that the film it's a theme song for is now out in Japanese theatres. https://youtu.be/XmoN0z9dPw0
https://vgmdb.net/album/80209 Probably not
What do you mean?
I assume when they say "Gun Fortress" they mean G.U.N.
so it's suggesting that the stage is just this massive fortress of guns
I like how it's not capitalised like it should be
Which honestly kinda amazes me because I had absolutely *no* idea where they were this entire time
I bring it up because I'm currently listening to Hiroko Moriguchi's version, featured on GUNDAM SONG COVERS 3 and actually featuring TM NETWORK themselves
<@99695384296701952> Thoughts on *BEYOND THE TIME ~Over the Moebius skies~?*
Ah yeah, a bunch of the recordings on *The Best of Crush 40: Super Sonic Songs* are altered compared to the originals... I think they are labelled as New Mix on the tracklist?
<@213645184125239317> https://youtu.be/D_Zy0p9MAxs
https://youtu.be/-ds4G0DzspI Lemme show you a little Hiroshi Okubo...
seriously, meme power is probably the big reason why that's the most popular song from the Atlus Sound Team on Spotify
One of these is not like the others
But MAN is it hype
https://youtu.be/nmv8HwUvc-k
I'm sure there is more to this song than this MV, cause you can hear it in some of the game's trailers
Ahahahaha
Well, if the big N have any plans to make a soundtrack for it, then that is no surprise
But for those who went to Horizon UK... It would be a McLaren Senna instead.
For those who listen to it on its own, perhaps you'd just think of an otherworldly kind of sound.
https://open.spotify.com/track/59wlTaYOL5tDUgXnbBQ3my?si=a7eecf7f91194af2 What do you see when you listen to this song?
It's been popular forever, really. Can you blame em?
"In the middle of the night... the pleasure's all mine."

DAILY DEMON VIDEO
https://youtu.be/7zO5LuLWQao I'm hoping that one day, I will be able to do the *perfect* run of The Goliath of Forza Horizon 5 to this song.
Alongside this, apparently also Pok√©mon Center/Evolution and Stack-Up/Gyromite
Searching for his name points out what it was, apparently it was Flat Zone 2 https://youtu.be/U6n2SKxdo0M
On a side note, those of you who play Grand Theft Auto V may have heard this on the radio stations in that game. I'd say they made a good choice with this one.
As much as I hate to admit being a millennial, I feel like many of my tastes are defined by that era - and that's mainly a result of listening to the radio so much while on the way to school. Songs like this would commonly play on repeat, both back when it first released, and long afterwards - and as a result, I always have nostalgia for songs released around the turn of the millennium such as this. Rediscovering them decades afterwards gives me vibes of a time that I felt like I never got to truly experience for myself back in the day.
https://youtu.be/mMfxI3r_LyA Today, lemme take you back to my childhood.
The annoying thing is that many of these only play *once* in the game during a specific Expedition, and as of right now have not yet been added to any of the game's radio stations. (Route 174 is on Hospital Records, Feels So Good is on Horizon Pulse, Live More is on Horizon XZ and Techtonic is on Horizon Bass Arena; the rest are Expedition-exclusive, or in the case of Encanto, cutscene and title screen)
https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLk1oqI8nVG6fKPKxEZTNlORCCDDeHAkBz If you wish, here's the full playlist of 9 exclusive songs!

Lemme cast your mind back to when you dropped into the volcano real quick
The sad part about it is that I think it was one of the last things Warren Wiebe did before taking his own life, but man, it really hits home
This OP is one of my favourites in the series, that's for sure
https://youtu.be/zJoBSUoZjpw Gonna casually drop this here
Instrumental openings in 2022... Well, IMO, this one works. Real well.
But this time, as the back chorus to Big Gadgets
Aya Kamiki w TAKUYA back at it again
https://open.spotify.com/track/5aYKgS47ItTuhE5xcEzHq3?si=830038ebdcd84a60 Fuuto PI's already off to a fantastic start with music like this
It's just a shame that most battles don't last that long, lmao
People are chumps to edit him out or skip over him during *Black tar* and also *Before my body is dry*
David Whitaker, man
This is of course conjecture, but this suggests a date of 2012.04.28 (April 28, 2012)
In this case, the song is "Z5 Mira" and the numbers left are 20120428
Decoding this song, you take the number(s) immediately in front of "z", and then take out all the other numbers
When you decode the title, you're left with what appears to be a date - take z5m20i12r04a28 for example
It is my belief that the various songs that start with "Z" actually have the dates they were recorded in their title
And in typical Sawano fashion, none of the non-vocal song titles make sense until you find out how to decode them
A bunch of familiar names with the vocal songs, too - mpi, Mika Kobayashi and David Whitaker to name a few
Yep. Xenoblade X's entire soundtrack was a Sawano work

Talk about two of the most hype fighting game main themes in recent memory, too. The King of Fighters XIV's main theme, *Follow Me!* is also included in this soundtrack, because as it turns out it's part of the physical KOF XV soundtrack as well! The song features in KOF XV as the theme of the Grand Finals in Story Mode.
I am **down**
Apparently, SNK dropped THE KING OF FIGHTERS XV ORIGINAL SOUNDTRACK on digital music services at the beginning of August
https://open.spotify.com/album/3zuWM9zQQzXU6KC8RInj5A?si=ZR-iaiE3TqKJ2ELsV4OtsQ So...
And there's a few other songs which similarly take old songs from First Gundam and update them
This song's from the Mobile Suit Gundam: Cucuruz Doan's Island film score

Been listening to this lately, thanks to Forza Horizon 5's Horizon XS selection.
Two inserts in 4 episodes, plus OP and ED
They are really going all-out on these inserts, holy shit
As I said, everyone who skips David Whitaker are *chumps*
Yuuuuuuuuup
the first half is battles on foot, the second half is battles when piloting the Skell
Also, fun fact, the original soundtrack version (which should be up there) is split into two in-game
Ah.
New Nana Mizuki, is it?

Ah yes, Kotono Mitsuishi.
I wonder just how upset Mick Gordon was about the mixing, heh
Very fitting choice in hindsight, due to their association with extreme sports
Actually, that very same game may have been responsible for Red Bull's popularity today
hence my response
For the record, an instrumental version of Firestarter was included in WipEout 2097
and on the other side, the WipEout modern https://open.spotify.com/track/3KAcuBkWEGd4hOKFRg98WC?si=FfixNK7XToe_y3bSGs1lfg&utm_source=copy-link
THE WIPEOUT CLASSIC
With limited channels - and not a single sound expansion chip - how does one make such *fire* music?
TIM. FOLLIN.
You weren't supposed to hear that. Pretend he said "nose up"!
Complete with gratuitous German on one song
Aimee Blackschleger, Cyua, Mika Kobayashi, mpi, they're all there
You see pretty much everyone shared between those soundtracks, actually
Indeed, David Whitaker was present in both KILL LA KILL and Xenoblade Chronicles X alongside Hiroyuki Sawano
Join the club, we got Yamaha pianos
Sharing this because I have been looping this all day https://youtu.be/gy0T0QmUV5s
It's got an English logo to boot
Commemorating 10 million views on YouTube of the MV
English version of The Blessing is coming in some form, it seems (originally set to release in the physical CD single for *Shukufuku,* which releases this Wednesday)
https://twitter.com/YOASOBI_staff/status/1588018457358237696?s=20&t=atpusqSRQEqb_TsyP9o8Jw Woah.
For those who don't know it from its digital album jacket, The Over is the theme for *Mobile Suit Gundam IRON-BLOODED ORPHANS Urdr-Hunt*
Making up the vocalist half of Re:End is voice actor kayto
Why do I think we should be talking about it in general, though? It's simple - the band formed to perform this song features Ryutaro Fujinaga of Elements Garden on composition
Not that it's unexpected, though; the theme song was first revealed *seven* months before preregistration finally started
I feel like this song went completely under the radar

Trippy MV <@331908049822547978>
Of all things, I have chosen *Wakiyo - Shenshoujing* as mine
So what's your spooky soundtrack gonna be for Halloween?
Yeah, you probably don't get *that* part of Knuckles rap back

I mean, it's sorta a tradition - there's a cover of an old song with "moon" in the name, and an actual theme song for the game (Mysterious Destiny, Tomorrow is Mine and Al Fine)
(A warning for all Bayonetta 3 players: Apparently, reading into the lyrics of this theme will provide you with out of context spoilers for the entire game!)
<:FineShocked:672430513025187840>
https://youtu.be/bwg58Ws6hOE
Apparently, rearranged by the original composer, no less
I see this and I raise you this https://youtu.be/TXrv1d2J7OE
And that song has just been brought to life, as of *BOCCHI THE ROCK!* Episode 8
For those wondering why that's significant, it's because „ÅÇ„ÅÆ„Éê„É≥„Éâ (That Band) is one of the few songs that's actually named in the original manga version of *BOCCHI THE ROCK!,* and not an original song created for the animation in the vein of songs like *Seishun Complex* and *Distortion!!!*

that's Nonon Jakuzure's outfit, isn't it?
... and on top of that, it was one of the songs that got remastered in XCDE
it's agreed that *Zanza the Divine* is one of Xenoblade's best songs
*Zanza the Divine,* my beloved
but I'll save that for later
There's also some interesting trivia behind *Zanarkand* as a theme
Huh... Does it not play at the beginning?

If you want a serious answer to that question, it's cause Triple-Q has been doing this for **years**
A lot of peeps were disappointed it wasn't a full transform (like Dragon Ball Legends had earlier this year with the LL Gohan Beast)
and you know what sucks about the one you just posted? BEAST GOHAN (ACTIVE SKILL)
and each time they have done so, they have failed, and soon after resume their music production
Context: For whatever reason, the Neko Hacker duo always retire from their music activities in order to prepare for the M-1 Grand Prix when it draws near
(or whenever it is that they usually do it...)
wonder if they'll have improved efforts to break out into comedy next April, lmao
and of course, the way it's supposed to sound like it's being played in a live house
there are subtle differences, like Kita's nervousness showing in the vocals
That being said, I feel like there's a proper reason for it - all of the LIVE version songs are actually completely different recordings to the studio recordings made for the album
Trust me, though, a lot of the people are echoing that same sentiment
That was a special improvisation suggested by one of the musicians, I think? And there *will* be a place where you can hear it in audio format - but we'll be waiting for BD Vol.4 before we can hear it
and also I don't really like the glorification of the Demi-fiend himself
it's not as badass as Forced Battle, for example
which honestly annoys me
