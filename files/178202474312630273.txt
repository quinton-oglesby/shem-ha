thoughts and prayers go out to anyone involved
My sister loved bleach but the only anime‚Äôs that are long that I have watched all of are pokemon and fairy tail
Oh no trust me I don‚Äôt <:LULW:561670474967547905>
its just the idea of watching so many episodes is so daunting but once i start i can't stop
i'm gonna have to watch demon slayer aren't i
she loved it though
only anime thing i have done with family is watch a silent voice with my mum
hopefully it works out
