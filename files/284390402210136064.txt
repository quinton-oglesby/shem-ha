30 minutes until the K-On! watch starts! Be very prepared!
Hi ho <@&458048859910832149>. It is I, Doctor Rakhi. It's been a week and a bit since those dammed old gods stole my memory. Thankfully, there seemed to be a good enough harvest of minds for them to not also take my arms. But these days I feel kinda lonely. What with having to reform many of the bonds I have apparently made. To alleviate that, I have three fresh new prompts which all *probably* have some kind of theme to them.
```
1.  Harem. I had a really weird dream where all of the Symphogear girls were in love with me and were all fighting eachother for my attention. It was a nightmare. The horror of that night is etched INTO MY SOUL. But enough about me, lets torment you! Write a story about how a character from Symphogear has to deal with a harem of girls (or all if your up to that levels of degeneracy).
2. Memory. Losing my memories made me think. How would the others react if they had also lost all of their memories? What part of them would stay the same?  Would Hibiki continue to have an almost primal gaze upon Miku whenever she entered the room? These are the questions I ask you. What if one or more characters lost an x amount of memories?
3. Time skips. In many of the stories I have read or seen, I find that a lot of them inbetween books or seasons or even movies there are time skips. What I ask of you is to write a tale of what things happen in those pockets of time lost to the readers eye.
```
The rules stay the same as before... Mostly. 2-4 pages but this time you have two weeks to submit any stories. There isn't exactly a limit on stories you can write so feel free to write as many as you want. I will enlist my helper to release any submitted prompts on the 25th, but you may continue sending prompts in until the 4th of March.
<@&458048859910832149>
Salutations authors, and welcome to the 9th round of writing prompts. Some of you have been assigned teams as per our previous announcement and so after I post this, I will be in a mad rush to contact all of you and make sure everyone knows who their partners are (Please give me some time <3). For those that didn't want to be paired, don't you worry! You are still freely allowed to participate and enter for the grand tradition of submitting prompts! Without further ado, here are your prompts:
```
1. Monster girls: Unleash the inner beasts and other beings within our characters. We are going beyond humanity and into something else... Write a story staring some lovely monster symphogear characters.
2. Time shift: Modern times are boring with their advanced technology and insane benefits. Lets go to the past! Write a story which is set in a previous era of time. From the cold war all the way down to caveman, everything is up for grabs!
3. Three's a crowd: This one is more a limitation but I know you brilliant writers will create something amazing with this. You may only have at max two named characters in your story. 
4. Blast from the past. Secrets: We all have secrets that we keep to ourselves. But what secrets do our cast carry, and how dreadful would it be were they to ever be exposed? Explore that in your story.
SPECIAL BONUS: If you so desire, you may use the prompts from round 8. They can be found a bit above this announcement for those who are interested. 
```
Everyone is limited to 2-6 pages of writing. However due to this lovely little experimentation, I will be granting additional time to refine and create your works. As such, the deadline will be the 16th of August.
Please contact me if you have any questions to anything regarding writing prompts. I respond to all of my DMs ❤️ 
I will see you all once the week embargo on prompts is over. Until then, enjoy writing!
<@&458048859910832149>
Welcome writers! Today I don't bring you what you are expecting. A new batch of prompts shall be brought to you all next week but today I bring to you something great. 

Symphogear has always told us that working together creates something amazing. In layman's terms, teamwork makes the dreamwork. That is why I announce to you all that the next weeks theme of prompts shall be...

```Duets```

I will compile everyone who is interested in a big list and randomly assign all of you who choose to participate a writing partner. What you do with your partner is entirely up to you. Whether it be sharing ideas or banding together to create one whole entry made by two, the choice shall be left to you! If you do enter a prompt written by two people, you are encouraged to come up with a team name <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>. You have no obligation to commit to working with whoever you are randomly assigned with, nor are you barred from entering next rounds prompts if you are not teamed up. 

From now until the 19th of this very month you have the chance to contact my DMs and express your participation in this project and you shall be marked down on the list. I will also be free to answer any questions which I fully expect will come from this announcement ❤️ . That will be the day I will release the next batch of prompts and begin round 9!

**Until then...**
<@&458048859910832149>
With the record breaking round 7 behind us, it is now time for the 8th instalment of Writing Prompts. Without any delay, here are the 4 prompts!
```
1. Employment: "Magical girl" is not something that looks good on your CV. Perhaps its time for a career change? With or without their trademark weapons, write our characters in a job of some kind!
2. Scars: The show has shown that our characters can take quite a beating. But every lash leaves its mark whether mental or physical. Describe those scars and their impact, and perhaps even overcoming them!
3. Unusual co-operation: If I have learned anything, is that you can't do anything alone. But that might lead you to ask for help from the strangest people. The cast have a diverse set of skill, perhaps one just so happens to have the right skill to assist an unknowing person...
4. Blast from the past. Atonement: The show only lightly touches upon what happens to the antagonists after their escapades. Perhaps you of writing skill can show us how punishment and atonement happens to these people? ```
The deadline is the 12th of July and will need 2-6 pages. Send the prompts to me in my DMs. In future writing prompts, I will be doing some research and finding a good word count limit to supplement those who like to go over the page :p. Until then, use good judgement. I am very honoured to be able to facilitate something as amazing as this for all of you and I will be glad to see everyone push to be better writers in the following months to come. 
Also, I am very much welcome to hear any future prompts you would like to see in the future. I swear I don't bite, so feel free to DM me!
<@&458048859910832149> 
It is time for round 7 of writing prompts!. Coincidentally it is also Tsubasa's bday which makes me feel bad that I didn't prepare anything for her. Perhaps you wonderful writers can write an eloquent story which she can enjoy reading when her festivities are over! Without any delay, here are the prompts:
```
1. Recast: Have you ever wondered what would happen if the Symphogears were the stars of a different show/game/movie? Write a prompt of what would happen if the Gears were the MC's of something other than Symphogear (Credit to Illi and Shemmy)
2. Gentle Repose: In between the chaos and hellish nightmares and fights that the characters have to face, there will always be a time to gather your thoughts. Even if it was just for a brief moment. Write a story about a small break in between stressful moments, whether it be inbetween a fight or across a season!
3. Vacation: Turns out working as a magic girl for a few years means you earn a lot of sick days. I suggest we use them! Tell us about how the gears go on holiday.
4. Blast from the Past. Sequels: There are a lot of fanfics in this growing community. And Writing Prompts has grown too. Perhaps you saw a tale and thought "I want to write what happens after that!" Take this prompt, and write up a sequel to a previous Prompt Submission or Fic! ```
The deadline is the 14th of June. DM them to me as a PDF or google doc when you are finished. Prompts need to be within 2-6 pages.  And I really do mean it this time, I do want people to try and exercise constraint within their writing as it is good practice. If you are having trouble with it, I would recommend posting the prompt as its own separate thing <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456> . There will be a one week grace period starting from now where I won't be posting any prompts that I receive, so keep that in mind if you want to do some polish!
React with some <:KirikaFish:688247618605940753> if you are thinking of submitting!
<@&458048859910832149>
Another week another round of prompts! We are on a roll with lots of participation, so here are some more prompts to inspire and motivate everyone!
```
1. FIGHT!: FIGHT FIGHT FIGHT FIGHT! We all like to watch spectacular fights! Write a story which is all about a fight involving Symphogear characters. Challenge yourself with this one!
2. Letter: We have so many great ways to keep in touch with eachother and convey all sorts of messages with letters. Write a letter written by a Symphogear cast member.
3. Future Sight: A Symphogear character has the knowledge of everything that happens in the future. From S1 to XV and everything in the middle. Write about how their actions and mindset changes with this knowledge.
4. Blast to the Past. Genre Shift: Symphogear conveys a lot of different themes in the 5 seasons of the show. But what if it was trying to portray something much different. Take a scene from the show and give it a new genre.```
Again the page limit will be 2-6 pages. The deadline will be an extra week, coming all to an end for the 17th of May. If there are any confusion or questions about the prompts, feel free to ping me so I can clarify :p. And as always, DM me your prompts and any help you require in suggestions for prompts. 
React with a <:TsubasaFish:689163064830066696> if you are excited and raring to write for writing prompts!
<@&458048859910832149> 
Greetings everyone. Since we have grown both as a server and a writing community with a record amount of prompt submissions, I have taken to asking around for advice to accommodate this surplus of talented individuals. The only person who responded to my emails was Todd Howard, who told me something about making it bigger.
So we have a new prompt option which shall come from the past. And here they are!
```
1. One Room: Set the scene, your characters find themselves in the training room. Now set this restriction onto your writing that it doesn't move away. Write a tale which does not transition to a different room/scene.
2. Odd pairings: The Symphogear cast is broad enough that there are characters that have had very minimal interactions. Tell a story about this odd pair and what they are doing together.
3. Original Characters (Credit to Illindus): Haven't you ever wanted to make your own Symphogear character?! Of course you have! Make such a character and write a story involving them.
4. Blast from the past (Memory): We are able to remember and forget many different things through our lives. What such things do you think the Symphogear characters remember and forget? Touch upon this in your prompt. 
```
I found that quite a few people were writing into 6 pages, so the page limit has been expanded to 2-6 pages. The deadline is the 19th of April, but I officially stop taking in submissions after I upload the last prompt I have received. And if you need any clarifications or me to answer any questions, feel free to ping or DM me.
If you are looking to write in for writing prompts, give me a <:TsubasaSmug:585839805737467920> reaction!
<@&458048859910832149>
Its that time for a new batch of Writing Prompts. Cutting the prompts back down to three, but everything else is business as usual! Getting right into it:
```
1. Gears Abroad: For whatever reason, our characters find themselves away from their native land of Japan. Write a story set in a place which is not Japan,
2. "I miss you": This is a phrase which I imagine our characters can utter quite a bit. Tell a tale which touches upon this theme of wanting someone you know to return.
3. Pranks: Mischief and mayhem are bound to happen with our cast, but who's pranking who? And what elaborate scheme do they have set? Write a story which features pranks.
```
The deadline is the 29th of March, with the page limit of 2-5. I don't mind if you go a little bit over, but please try and keep it constrained. If you have any queries or questions about anything I've said, please feel free to ping me or explode my DMs. Getting inspired or finding the right idea can be hard, so I am always willing to talk to someone and help them explore what they plan to write.
If you are thinking of submitting, react with a <:HibikiWow:614268629952757760>

Greetings writers, it is that time again for another season of Writing Prompts! To celebrate XDU's global release, this season will feature XDU prompts. And to make things even better, this week I present to you 4 prompts to choose from. For those who are unaware, writing prompts is where you have time to write out a 2-5 page short story following a prompt. Please send submissions to me, and I will anonymously upload them to the server so we may provide feedback. With that out of the way, here are the prompts:
```
1. Gjalahorn: The XDU based Artefact holds a great power within it. It has demonstrated the ability to pull people from other universes into our own, take the symphogears into new realities and even allow us to see the endless sea of alternate universes. Write a story where Gjalarhorn does any one of the things I just mentioned! (Credit to Illindus)
2. Invention: Elfnein has been shown to tinker away at all sorts of wonderous creations and inventions. Write a tale of such inventions, what it does and how the cast handle what was created.
3. Gaming: The world of video games is plentiful, and what better way to celebrate XDU being released than having a fic where our band of characters enjoy some good old video gaming! From Candy Crush to competitive Starcraft, write a story which involves videogaming.
4. Relics: Many XDU events are based around a mysterious artefact which conveniently provides an excuse for our characters to dress in funny ways. Perhaps you have your own relic which you would like to introduce. Write a story of a brand new relic causing pleasure/terror to the crew. ```
You have until the 8th of March to submit these. One clarification I would like to make as well is that the prompts are aimed to be very rough guidelines to which the story should be about. They should feel like stepping stones, not restrictions.
If you are even remotely interested in submitting, please react with a <:KanadeSmile:672455286392356884> !
<@&458048859910832149>
Hello again! I hope you writers have enjoyed your one week holiday because it is time for the second round of Writing Prompts. As last time, I will grant you all 2 weeks to write out a 2-5 page story which is based around one of three prompts. Or maybe do all three at once? I won't be stopping you. 
Here are your three prompts!
```
1. The Butterfly Effect: They say that if you went back in time and crushed a butterfly, the chain of events would end the world... or at the very least change reality. Make a small change in the plot of Symphogear and explore the new timeline.
2. SPORTS: With Miku recently taking up baseball on the server, S.O.N.G has taken up a sporting initiative. Write our characters playing some good old sports. (Note: Sports is whatever is considered sport. That does include sports from other fiction like Quidditch)
3. Heist: Turns out the reparations for destroying cities is too much and our crew needs to pull off a big score to get the cash. Whether it be a James Bond escapade or a Payday 2 bullet spree write a get rich quick scheme!
```
The deadline is the 16th of February. Shoot those prompts into my DMs once your done and I will upload them anonymously for all to give constructive feedback and unconstructive commentary. Feel free to throw questions to me in DMs or by pining me! I don't bite I promise.

And as a little something for me, if anyone is even thinking about writing for one of these, please react to this announcement with a <:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>!
<@&458048859910832149> 
Hello fellow writing enthusiasts plus aspiring authors. Have you felt a desire to get creative? Did you join this server and pick up this role, then be confused as to why it was seemingly unutilised? Do you miss the wacky stories we came up with months ago?
Well miss no more. I have decided that its time for another season of writing prompts for the masses. The rules are simple. You shall be given two weeks as well as the option of one of three prompts and will write a **2-5 page** story relating to it. You may submit as many as you'd like, although I would advice picking different prompts :3.

Here are your three prompts for the reboot season of WP:
```
1. Dreams. When humans sleep, the unconscious mind takes us to bizarre landscapes and weird scenarios. Write a story about a character's dreams, pleasant or nightmarish in nature.
2. Peace. After the wars and battles end, our characters would spend time for themselves. Write a story set in-between seasons or after XV about S.O.N.G and gang enjoying the quiet time.
3. Island Survival. Whether it be a clipped wing, a big ice berg or that pesky Gjallarhorn, the cast find themselves stuck on a body of land surrounded by sea. Write the tale of their time stuck. ```

The deadline for submission is the 25th of January. Please send any directly to my DMs! I will release prompts anonymously by the next day I get them, with the aim to release at the maximum of 1 submission per day. And remember to have fun!
If you wish to receive a ping from this role, head into <#448237561085952001> and type in dess_iam Writing Prompts and join in the discussion in <#357682999300718592>
<@&458048859910832149> 
May day! May day! It's the days of May! This month… nothing happens except labour day. Except PROMPTS! A new month means new prompts and boy have we got a bunch for you now.

**A New Perspective**: Ever wonder what the old lady at Flower was seeing when the world went to hell and back? I don’t but I like seeing things from fresh eyes! Write a story about a scene from our beloved show but seen from a whole new perspective!
**Scars:** The show has shown that our characters can take quite a beating. But every lash leaves its mark whether mental or physical. Describe those scars and their impact, and perhaps even overcoming them!
**A Work Day**: There's the bell! Whether it's party of their SONG (or adversary there-of) job, something more mundane, or something altogether out there, write a bit about a average work day for any of our characters.
**How We Remember:** It was not yesterday you wrote me a lovely story about how I was incredible. That’s how I'm choosing to remember that anyway. Write a story where the cast remember some of the things that have happened to them, how accurate they actually are being left to your discretion.

To submit a prompt, simply DM a document to either <@284390402210136064>, <@186660127825330177>, <@279341087494242304>, and/or <@445783190976856065>. Prompts should be 2-6 page (~3,000 words) PDFs and we will start daily posting them in <#357682999300718592> in a weeks time. The deadline for this months submissions is May 31st. Any other questions should also be directed to us. Good luck and, for those with allergies, stay healthy!
Hello <@&458048859910832149> 

Welcome to 2022. Yes im a little late. Lets just say i was recovering from my bday. But enough about me we have an important announcement to make.

For January and February we wont be hosting any new prompts.  A lil holiday for us to regain some creative prompts juices.

If you wish to send any prompts to us during this time, feel free to use any prior prompts we’ve posted (let us know what you used) and we can throw that up in our iconic anonymous style. In March, we shall return and hopefully with a bang!

Until then, thats us signing off for winter. See yall then!
<@&458048859910832149> 
Hello flesh beings! It is that time of year. The first of every month where we cart out to you some PROMPTS. We do like writing here and once you can escape the horrors of the season feel free to sit down and write out some 2-6 page stories! Speaking of...
```
1. Creation: For some reason I am thinking a lot about Jesus Christ. He was created one could say on the 25th. He was also a carpenter who created chairs probably. He also created Christianity, in a way. Yep, that's the theme of this prompt. Write out something that involves a creation.
2. Swap: Speaking of the 25th, I hear a tradition of performing a swap is very common. More commonly people swap items, but anything can be swapped if you add enough magic to it! Write a story containing some kinda swap, be it a gift or even bodies!
3. Empty: This is for all you who are brain empty after spending time with family. Or those of you who loot dangerous dungeons just to find the treasure chamber is empty. There's definitely a correlation... right? Write a story where something or someone is empty or being emptied!
4. Blast from the past, Christmas: Back in my day we celebrated this holiday called Christmas. Some fat dude broke into peoples houses and stole the credit for some people buying presents for others. Oh and Jesus was born or something. Write a story set during or is about Christmas!
```
2-6 pages, deadline is 31st of december (yep im dealing with you all on my bday as well unfortunately) , send it to <@!284390402210136064> <@!279341087494242304> <@!445783190976856065> <@!186660127825330177>  
If you have ideas for future writing prompts or even projects feel free to let us know. Other than that, happy writing.
<@&458048859910832149> Hello my fellow LGBTs and also not that peeps. Its that time for corporate pride themed prompts! And by that I mean I am gonna invoke the feelings of pride month while having the prompts be already determined days ago and doesn't benefit from the rainbow. With that out of the way:
```
Disguise: AMONGUS. Yall feel me when I say that when someone turns out to be an impostor is kinda cringe right? Like when that cool girl in pink glasses turned out to be an angry teenage girl throwing sharp yo-yos? And who knows what other wacky hi-jinks that have happened related to any form of disguises for our crew. Write some stories involving disguises.
A grand proposal: I love you. Except you, Solo, Nuker and Shemmy. And because it's in announcements that makes it a grand proposal! Write a story containing a spectacle for what is just a proposal (they don't have to just be marriage ones).
The beach: its hot. the planet is dying and plastic fills our shores. But we don't care about that it's sunny and the sand has all sorts of lovely adventures! Write a fic about the gang at the beach!
Pride: I LIED WE HAVE PRIDE WOOOOOOOOOOOOO! As many of us meticulously speculate, many of our favourite singing magical girls are also lesbian, ace and all sorts of different layers of the LGBTQ+ spectrum. Write a story in where our characters find their pride or even just discovering the truths about themselves
```
Prompts are submitted to <@!284390402210136064> <@!279341087494242304> <@!186660127825330177> and <@!445783190976856065> .They need to be 2-6 page PDFs and we will start daily posting them in <#357682999300718592> in a weeks time.

<@&458048859910832149>

Good morning. Gosh I ain't seen y'all for years!

So look I had my bday yesterday and also Christmas happened and so the team is currently suffering from something ill just call post 2020 syndrome. So what better thing to do than to look back at 2020 by allowing any 2020 prompt to be the prompt for this month. That's right!

**ANY 2020 PROMPT**

You may be asking "But how can I access all of these prompts there's so many?" Well you see I thought ahead. In the google drive folder which is pinned in fancontent you can find a folder called prompt 15 which will contain all of the previous 14 rounds of prompts!
 
Whats that? You are lazy?!

Fine here's a link: <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1d5QEnuAiKD9MC5Fnj4eUK_zXqtChEZ9M4aViB1ZIhss/edit?usp=sharing>

Just mark down what your prompt is at the top of the page. Speaking of pages, you have 2-6 pages! Prompt deadline will be the 31st of January. Crossovers and poetry and working together are all fine to do as well, as they were things that were done in the past. Send prompts to me, Solo and Shemmy. With that, see you all next month!
<@&458048859910832149>
Happy H<:pumpkin:761277042552471562>lloween! Wait dammit I'm a day or two late. Whatever, here's some anticipated November prompts.
```
1. Children: Did you know that November is around the time a lot of babies are born? Those babies grow up and become little gremlins that insane people have to try and deal with. Write about our cast dealing with their own goblins, or perhaps of a time where they themselves were chaotic bastards.
2. Diary: Having a recollection of everything you did in a day is very helpful for maintaining a memory. Especially when your job is as traumatic as a magic girl. Write a sneak preview of someone's diary or a story which involves someone's personal book.
3. Unfit for work: Miku would be quite the excellent chef for a busy restaurant. But perfection is BORING. Hibiki working the stoves of a place she is unqualified for is what I live for. Tell us all a tale of a Symphogear doing a job, work or a task which they are inept at.
4. Apocalypse: So many times the crew have saved the world from being turned into a Mad Max style hellhole. But I suppose we don't get to see what life would be like for our cast under any sorts of world ending disasters now do we? Write up an apocalypse of some kind ravaging the world and our cast dealing with either the threat or the aftermath.
```
The deadline shall be on the 29th of November. And the page limit is still 2-6 pages. Yes you all get an extra week. Yes we are giving it because we want a prompt round for December. But also woo an extra week to procrastinate!
I know a lot of you struggle to get that pen or keyboard to paper so I would like to remind people that yes my DMs are in fact open to talk to you in regards to writing. In fact, I also so happened to have ~~enslaved~~ hired two very rad assistants who can help you out too! Shemmy and Solopy if you didn't catch on.


... There ain't anything more. Have a productive November!
<@&458048859910832149> 
Hey nerds. Totally not late. And totally not **SQUEEING OVER 21 INDIVIDUAL SUBMISSIONS.** With that out of the way, lets get cracking with the show. In celebration of the month of Halloween, we have some ***SPOOOOOOOOOOOOOKY*** prompts to serve up.
```
1. Nightmares: My favourite horror movie is none of them cause frack being scared. However, what dark thoughts dwell in the deep subconscious of our characters? When we are unconscious we are at our most vulnerable, what might the girls see in their darkest dreams? Write a tale featuring some sort of bad dream.
2. Nightlife: Watching movie with the gals at night. Hitting up the club, going trick or treating, getting up to pranks and mischief. These are the many wonders of life. All sorts of things happen at night! What do the characters do, I ask your keyboard?
3. Imprisonment: Alcatraz Island is commonly thought to be a very spooky place according to popular fiction. So is being locked in confined spaces. Popular fiction can't be wrong! Go write something about our girls being trapped somewhere or imprisoned where they do not wish to be.
4. Costumes: What is a masquerade without the masks. What is life if not for characters drawn in spooky costumes. Live that reality out, with Writing!
```
Prompts are 2-6 pages AND/OR under 3,000 words. One or the other will work. We will be picky if you fiddle around super hard with fonts and margins so please be mindful of those who struggle to read. The deadline is the spooky day of Halloween which is naturally the inspiration for all these prompts and something to keep in mind. With that out of the way, Have fun writing from me and the prompz gangz. We are looking for names please help
In addition to the new batch of prompts, we also have for you a challenge! 

In accordance with popular demand, we're bringing back the writing prompt that netted more submissions than ever!

```Crossover!

There's nothing quite like mixing and matching several of our favourite series together into one big package, seeing the various characters interact and marvel at each others' strengths! Whether it is characters meeting, or a total recast of Symphogear's cast into another setting, the possibilities are endless! Popular or obscure, all are welcome! ```

The challenge is, of course, to incorporate the crossover element into the submissions you write. This is a **completely optional** challenge, and if you do not wish to participate in it, you don't have to! If you do, when you submit, be sure to say which series you have crossed with. It will be spoiler tagged when the submission is revealed to the public.

We've had a lot of fun with the crossover prompt in the past, so we hope that you have as much fun with it now! Good luck to all writers, and we eagerly await your ideas!
<@&458048859910832149> 
Heya! Tonight on the stage, the maestro presents to you all something new! It is something much more than that. It is the hope all of you hold to create and paint this world a wonderful place. *Also yes it's new prompts and a new theme*
First off the Prompts:
```
1. AU tomfoolery: I wrote this prompt out before we got the whole new Edgebikki thing, but I still believe we need more interactions with the established AU worlds from XDU or ANY AU. Write us a tale of our cast of protagonists interacting with them.
2. Foreign Lands: When you enter a new country or land, there is often a large cultural and language barrier one faces. For globe and dimension trotting magic girls, this barrier can be overcome... Right? Explore our protagonists breaking through or being stopped by a language or cultural barrier from lands they aren't familiar with.
3. Crackshipping: Yes. I went there. Although perhaps the name is being too harsh. We all know the conventional ships that Symphogear has, but what about the love for the more unconventional Tsubasa and Kirika. Or Shirabe and Hibiki. Or Chris and a plate of fancy cheese! Write a tale featuring such unconventional ships inside them.
4. Creative Usages: God the things I would do with Airgetlahm. I would win a lot of arm wrestling tournaments and maybe even do some extreme kickflips on a skateboard. What do you mean they were build for combat?! Write a story where the infinite possibilities of the Symphogear unlock to new horizons, useful or not. Or perhaps you find a use already in the show for something brand new?
```
The same deadlines and limits apply. Prompts are due to be submitted on the 4th of October. If you need an extension, please let me know before the deadline reaches so that I may work a plan out. In addition, I am proud to announce Shemmy (Lucky Pineapple) and Solopy567 as people you can also send prompts too! Although preferably sent to me as they are but mere assistants. There's more...
<@&458048859910832149>
pe'el everyone! Yes I did google Klingon to introduce everyone to BRAND NEW PROMPTS (clap clap clap)
No special theme for this week, we are just going back to some good old 4 prompts. Speaking of which, here they are!
```
1. Unintended Consequences: Gosh don't you hate it when you accidentally spill 5 cups of coffee onto this nerd who was just "in the way" and then 5 years down the line they are choking you out with some weird gizmo? Me neither. I never suffer consequences. But how about our cast of characters? Write about something happening to our cast which was an unintentional result of their actions.
2. Childhood: Ah children... Look I have nothing to say about this give me a break. Write a story featuring either the symphogears having their own spawn or the characters themselves being children themselves. And no, teenagers aren't children in this context.
3. Spirits and Occult: Are ghosts real? I mean if you ask Serena or Saint Germain or Kanade or Carol they wont reply to you because only symphogear and relic users can see other symphogear and relic users... probably. But something lies beyond the normal world. But what exactly is there? Write a story about the spirits and ghosts of the symphogear world interacting with our cast. Or perhaps you would like to write about the great beyond and delve deeper into why such spooky phenomenon's exist.....
4. All roads lead to Rome: Writing is hard. So lets make it harder. Write a story where the starting and ending sentences are the same. If you struggle to achieve this, just remember. Writing is hard.
```
The prompts will be due on the 13th of September. I understand that September will be a difficult time for everyone (me included) so I will be a little bit more lenient with extensions. You have 2-6 pages to write your story and once it is done send them to me directly. 
Other than that... Have fun writing and remember I am open to answer any questions you have relating to the prompts!
We cant stand around waiting to die
Got to take a chance
Sorry comrade
I vote to Lynch Lucifer
With that being said
And human behaviour alone
We have human behaviour to analyse who kills whom
Ok then
Nah
I wonder if dess rolls work here...
Hmm
Nobody is silent?
So that makes 5 of us?
AYE if you are here
Ok
Yet
...lets not
Can we lynch fine?
We basically lynch at random
So
This is pure blues vs blacks
So from what ive gathered
Trafic indeed
I think Shirabe is dead
The bell tolls
<:ElfneinDrowning:336656417035517952>
yes
might as wel take on the persona of a sniper
well if we are getting into characters....
this hamlet is bloody quiet
this town is... pretty quiet
a well aimed bullet in a skull is pretty painless
if you think about it
i mean...
something like that anyway
so all of us can turn traitor off the bat
**moshi moshi**
moshi moshi
**moshi moshi**
Whatever, i die with a smile on my face
:p
Like i was goinf to have a happy end there anyway
And yes that means three for me
None for lucifer anymore
We have two people on deaths door

Fine finds fun in describing their death
We have a dead body
I mean
So
Guess he


Lost the duel <:MariaSunglasses:336656798687690752>

I did vote for Homura, but the majority had basically passed

***MOSHI MOSHI***
To claim you were the doctor on whoever we tried to kill
I want you
If nobody dies
Apparently not
Do i need to explain what a doctor does?
I expect there to be a cop and a doctor
Lets talk strategy
Two gun nuts vs a bunch of top deckers
Of course
Misery loves company
Rakhi probably top decks hearthstone cards to murder her new duellists
Lets see
Well this game is probably going to be mega hard
Ooof
Moshi moshi
And more
Less arrogance
You play it how you can
The die is cast
Then <@!191005638212452352>
Sorry, am i allowed to speak here during the day Fine?
Lilly isnt
Lucy is inno
To see what they would say
You were quirt
Claim someone is mafia and someone else is inno
This is a risky play
Hmm
Go for it
They tear eachother apart
You need to counter
But if someone claims
Up to you
How you do it
You must
Counter claim cop
Homura
Blue eyes vs Deathwinf
We go for him
Yes
Wait
The one that isnt pats
For the other duelist
Lets go
Hmmmm
I believe in the gamblers fallacy
No
Who do you think is the cop?
Most likely
Fine is killing one of us
If we fail to kill this round
Is the cop
Who
The question is
I say snipe as in play deathwing on the fucker
Cop
The coo
I nean
We need to snipe the doctor
So scrmz is most likely on themselves
Well
The moment has passed, oh well
Lets pull it off
3 in a row is nutty
Luck
Good
If i die homura
Btw
Yes
And Madoka
For the glory of Hearthstone
We shall be executing scrmz
Fine
I agree
....
Scrmz
But
And he will know not to push hard
Pats is a bad liar
Scrmz or a duelist
Hmm
Whats ur thoughts homura
Personally we should kill the yugioh duelists with hearthstone cards
Hope they miss it?
If its a sniper... then we cry
Our weapons means we will kill with guns most likely
Some of us cant live in an infinite time loop
Assumptions are how i play out this game and hope to win
Hmmm
Rip
I shoot Scrmz
Before i am lynched?
Can i kill myself
If this fails
Touche
Who do you like the most?
Fine
Hmmmmmmmm
Hmmmmmm
Maddeninf
How
Or tails
Heads
Couldnt see the list of names
For some reason
Lucifer
The one who isnt lily or scrmz
I kill
So
Lily is mafia
Day 3
Day 2 i found doc was doc
Day 1 found cop
I promised a gambit
Then
Now
SUBARSHI
GREAT
GOOD
Will you out me by saying the two coos shouls be in contact with eachother
If i say im a cop and im second
I need to know this
Also
If you tell me
I promise a fun gambit
Chop chop
Yes
<@456226577798135808> what are the numbers?
I might need to pit myself with someone
If i sway them I could possibly win
Who is The easiest egg to crack in this
Urgh...
I an playing too weak
Scrmz is onto me
At a bad time
So the inspectors report reveals Yami is innocent
I work well with a foil, abiet an evil one
Mind if i speak to you this moonlit night
Urgh
You would know that more than anybody Finè
Pawns not actinf
Make these pics emote thingies
I have suggest
Also a thing explaining why I and kerrik and saki and rukia are green
I would def say tho that a little something to what yall do like “subbing group” be nice
Hey this be suggestion box not provide solutions box
Custodian is staff roles, easy there
I was thinking this bc when people say hi in introductions, they usually clash into like 2-3 people who arent coloured white
I also know where you got the name, be nice if new people also knew what they were
Would new people know?
I mean i know
Although perhaps there could be something explaining what Yamete is?
Im blind
Perhaps its a case of explaining the different roles just like how you explained <#419319372797050880>
Like look at R and you know hes an autoscorer and what autoscorers do bc you read the rules
So ive noticed looking at the rules that Yametetomete colour roles arent really explained unlike the other ones
Thats just a specific pic of ver tho snook, also animated gifs would need nitro
I had in mind something else
Sort of
xth suggestion:
The Kirika shocked while screaming “death” in the OVAs isnt an emote. Make it so
xth suggestion, make this into emote thingy
Yuri plz
If you do that also edit the bots message to encourage new users to make an introduction
✔️ try to summon yugioh in the suggestion-box
To summon the unstoppable Yurixodia
we need but three more to assemble the pieces
<@!127644949884698624>
Would this chat be slightly more welcoming to newer people if there was a chat dedicated to letting newcomers make an introduction?
:marianeesan:
Serena swan song jam face should also be emote
I have second suggest


Girls Frontline
and beatmap sharing
group osu play
i am not hearing a no
an osu group would be cool
OSU
Civ
i recommended raidcall because the anime sings discord uses that for their monthly karaoke
I know that theres some russian software called “Raidcall” which works pretty good. Lets you play audio from the computer and sing at the same time
we weaponise moe
"to be aware of"
what was your thoughts on putting an explanation on why some peeps are green?
~~revival of ping for pics?~~
Near future oooh
wait crap this is just a ploy to make me actually take a role colour
secret mod discussions lul
are you ok?
?
could we make shirabes pink more... pink?
Suggestion: remove all mods except for R and make the only mod role “DictatoR”
sadly I dont
So until my birthday <:HibikiPadoru:516438720082346004>
Its part of what makes Hibiki
Including the whole fragment inside your chest bit?
Does this turn you into Hibiki?
Hi I am totally Rakhi, can I suggest that we add more Hibiki to the server?
<#357682999300718592> *was* nsfw, so maybe it could be made back into that
Wouldnt get that here
Modding apathy is definitely something
Like Madoka Magica somewhat follows similar themes of magic girl but those kinds of servers tend to be big and popular. Ive found the bigger they are the lax the rules can be
Not the show
It will depend on the server
Well going a bit on track
I would never go as far as to call her any slurs though, and im 100% certain that there are people in the anime community who would go that far
I mean dont get me wrong I absolutely adore and love tail red more then any of those aliens could
Its just.. the average i find
Not to blame everyone mind you
You are making solid points but yea the anime community as a whole is *slightly* transphobic
The general anime community arent the best with gender swaps and characters not presenting as their birth gender
*is* there a twintails discord? I can imagine why partnering with them would be tricky considering the average anime viewer on discord
Alice has worked hard to build something pretty slick here and it would be a bit counter intuitive to partner with a discord which is... less controlled if you would
I can speak from personal experience that it will depend on the discord and how its moderated
Twintails
Would have to ask kro and alice. Both of whom are on this server <:charlotteSmile:361619541048033280>
Thats my proposal, partnership with that
<:GarieWink:336657101273169921>
3HZ
Listen i did some scouting and i *think* the server might be om
Saki do some scouting!
Why not thr 3HZ discord
Saki knows why <3
<a:PapikaRun:408911073991983104> <a:CoconaRun:408911025363222538>
Meta i suggested it cause alice is admin in that discord
I think kro would possibly be ok with that :D
Alice <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
Why dont we collab with the Studio 3HZ discord
The edgy kids on different discords you mean?
I think marooned is older than you
This place is pretty cool
I dont hold much hope in people these days :s
My main concern is weebs can be transphobes
Im imagining alice as like a diplomatic envoy
Well i think at the end of the day, its gonna depend on both the server owners/moderators. Cause they would have to initiate it, not the users imo
But yea, Lava in your mind what does a partnership look like?
No real risk of that
Exactly. Symphogear and Rider are distinct enough that jt wouldn’t really happen
The two servers would have their roots
Because at the end of the day
I dont think that would happe
In your mind, what is it
What would a cooperation or something even entail is something
That lasted under a month
Saki used to be the only american in the infamous ping for pics era
More than you think
~~still only one euro mod~~
<:elfneingrin:548682658662711297> didnt come out too right but thanks <@177109369228361728> <3
Shit, she did. Sorry bout that
But yea we should probably change the server icon for reals tho
we should probably change the server icon
whats the colour look like?
Ill take your entire stock
||bikkinom||
Has the server considered an art channel which is dedicated for more high frequency dumps of pictures? It seems theres a demand for it and the only reason it isnt more seen in <#336297674707828747> is because it would overload shirabe
Not keeping track just had that thought
Ngl no i didnt
<:blobshrug:618588054881435703> kinda wish I thought about this a bit before then :s
Well another way to look at it is if its based around discussion about the most recent released episode. That might also include people who are rewatching through youtube
I dunno how many this is but with Symphogear coming to youtube and being released slowly on that should there be a channel for those people that come from there to perhaps discuss the show without encountering spoilers?
Seeing that the server has grown quite a bit to the point that there can be enough people where discussion about mundane things can happen in multiple chats, would it perhaps be time for a second general chat?
im for chris showing stuff with mic in hand
i was staring at that for like 5 minutes <:JunkoPTSD:536066739495239681>
and blind as fuck
im a fuckin idiot
dam
could we have a tabletop role for those interested in playing boardgames together on Tabletop sim or something similar?
should we perhaps have a dedicated xdu channel category where other xdu related channels can be added, such as a channel for rolls or a channel for xdu based announcements?
<:blural_eyes:671130807867408404>
~~i just dunno whomst we be so we just go by this~~
like almost certainly "Emily" is not the person who is always speaking here
for systems to represent who is currently speaking pluralkit allows them to visually show that with a different name and pfp to indicate who is speaking
<:ShirabeCry:671887081026617345>
we have everything covered that you would need an nsfw chat for here. If you need to discuss something which is nsfw in nature but is serious it goes in serious discussion. if its art or horny it should go in nsfw. having an nsfw general chat would be mainly used for being horny shouldnt really be done in this server anyway tbh. a kinda thing you take to dms or your own server
right but theres servers that should have a general nsfw channel. a public anime server is not one of those
which is a bit too niche
unless you are proposing an nsfw fancontent
the nsfw chat would do fine for that
plus minors as well
Ah bless
So I’ve been meaning to ask but what’s happening with the bots? I have tremendously bad memory but i seem to recall something about there being limited time on their lease or something?
<:ShirabePlease:724034356192215081>
We still have animated slots rady
There was an events based role
Fuck everyone we need to hit tier 4 or else!
why dont you mix kiri green and shirabe pink and ask for that to be your role colour
rady
but perhaps having a more consistency with naming schemes such as with <a:BikkiPowerDab:688190074219003996> being with bikki and then other emotes being <:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616> hibiki
if i could make an emote suggestion, not about any proposed new ones
For all the extra emotes
I feel like at some point this server is gonna need an emote server
~~also live shitposting is the dumping ground for anything that overflows from general~~
Cooking with Kerrik and other stuff did their kinda series on making their own dishes in that channel
Convention if anything
<a:AquaPadoru:631565095457259551> something like this probably
Maybe just make the padoru’s animated
Maybe have it more harder to trigger?
I mean people say yeet naturally
<:LeiurFlashy:674522617989955595>
discord is borked
Wouldnt it make sense if the heads are heads
Might be worth explaining shem-ha somewhere in like rules or something case people get confused
I think maybe having a whole nother set of optional roles if people want to engage with it might be nice?
<@!99695384296701952> for the nsfw changes could we maybe get an update to that in the channel desc as well as <#739277869124943964> ?
Would need a gage on how many people would actually be interested in participating i guess
As one of the people who requested the role, i can definitely see the advantage of what… sussus suggested
Secret plans
Usually melua and gang have their own wild plans for April fool’s day iirc no?
Its as if we are all reasonable people
How do you think i got my names
Anime girls be like roll a d100 and thats their name
Well no channels but like spam bots can still join the server and flood users with dms no?
And matt ur my equal not just because im an anarchist and don’t believe in hierarchies
Have ideas you bloody dork
<:bonk:815820855367696436> no self deprecation in suggestions
😎
For every one of me theres 10 weirdos who are weirdo weebs
My take is id rather not have the server public
well all or nothing as one gambling bloke would say
ah i see what you mean
we post the prompts the order we get them roughly a week after we announce them
we dont really do birthday writing prompts
like it sounds mean but theres much less complains if someone posts over another persons fanart
writing prompts is the wedge really cause its something which necessitates a lot of conversation due to its nature
Could just leave writing prompts in threads, that way with birthdays you can have the channel flooded with peoples different fanarts and whatnot
Welcome, edible food product!
We have good welcomes to people

I should’ve told you i wasnt gonna do fanart posts until i returned

Oh can you just give me that power without a role?
I mean i was also referring to anime club president
Ping for pics and that jazz

We’ve already watched madoka
<#371105434771390465>
Dont mean to derail the convo, but would this convo be more suited elsewhere?
Since you say you aint watched gear fully yet...
General is very general
Anime club is for discussion of anime ~~to my mild annoyance~~
Same with non Symphogear spoilers 
Live shitposting is for talking about stuff live or for shitposting so expect Symphogear stuff.
Id say ignore every other channel.
Again, welcome comrade <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>

https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11598302/1/My-lesbian-life-with-Monster-Girls-Monster-Yurisume
<@!127644949884698624> would you like to read a fanfic about monster musume but the human is a lesbian girl and theres no harem?
something else
not in anime
i dont remember where
ive heard of this idea before...
Need to grind hard raids for super rare mats <:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
Raid salt chat lets go
Another raid another zero giga crystals
<@!103638500657606656> i need that fuckin last one, the giga melody crystal or whatever
Hopefully the fucking mat i need drops so i can get lvl 70 dr jii
Nixe
Just posted it :p
If you help i will send you good vibes
Can someone help with my red raid?
Friend code is 938168898
Iirc i think i still have space <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
if anyone helps my red raid i will provide them double the good vibes compared to last time
i put up a hard red raid btw
im not an expert on it
you can lvl up the skill
so global reaction to hard raids is hacks <:TsubasaSmug:585839805737467920>
whats that quote where when people get confronted with hard games, they try to exploit the game and push it to its limits to counteract it
<:LMFAO:473670835748601858>
pay money bitch if you want more slots
Ill come back when I figure that answer out
Thats a very good question
Ill start some raids just for u bby
Don’t you know Pokelabo said not to cheat
LMAO
Sanic did you fuckin survive the bans?
Well my raids are up and tagged if u want to use them <:GarieWink:336657101273169921>
:p
Actually its 4am probably shouldn’t
Where tf is my GZs 💢
Nice
Shit i guess they cant tell you to not cheat
Wow taking the easy mode i see
You know theres rewards in them
Disturbance to the game more like
Sanics gonna get a japanese letter through their mailbox
In game announcements
I opened up a blue and red hard raid if people wana jump in on those
I might be there for sanic raids :p
here wouldnt work
oh derp this is raids not pulls
Or the long name

Dr jii
Then I literally have 2 mlb dr jii
Well i need one more drjii
So my plan is to run 2 70drjii and 70 mega deth

Dam i tried so hard

im doing a green carol now
Oooo
Even took out the autoscorers by myself
I brought all the event rice 🙃
Just burn rice what could go wrong <:pepega:504408080285564948>
Same :p
Sanic raids for int ?
I don’t make it wave 30 <:yuri_dab:418833805277790210>
Me but for my xd jii
She’s fragile as fuck
Although tbf i have a fuckin 54 revive jii
Other than the revive jii *goals*
*sadly she wont help my grind for LU Dr Jii*
Doing these raids to LU xd jii and make things much faster
xd
Also the weakest add is the one that does the least cc
The less i see of elemental nova the better
Nah just ice it
e z
i almost killed the top one
i have a green carol that i need killed xd
I KNOW
time to bully normal carol raids till i can LU shirabe
I think i got the order wrong
i dont have enough tho <:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
cais ur friends fill up quick :p
before they fixed raids i think i got to like round 2k ish with my Dr Jii
I think i used to have a pic of Hibiki staring down that snake thing from AXZ a while back, but I changed it up
More then they already think that of me anyway
Something cool and actiony i guess? I don't want people thinking I'm perverted or anything!
I'm scared but I'll answer you nonetheless
Have any of you guys got fanart that would work really well as a phone wallpaper? The ones i have saved don't make the cut
TIL
I imagine someone else has better ones

Sort of ish?
This one is Chris with background Hibiki as well


I found it
I looked at my own collection, i swear i had at least one but i guess not..
Pesky rules and regulations, stopping true yuri from being shown to the masses!
There is probably bacon related Yuri out there SOMEWHERE right?
It was actually bacon but lets say Yuri did it 😉
Oh trust me I'm already a secret non-muslim in a muslim family God has long since dammed me
Tis an unhealthy hobby of mine
Also i have long since gone past the point of sorting
I dont have one, I'm using my phone for this
Also its just adding to the 1000+ anime related photos saved onto my phone
Although what is lewd is another question :p
I dont take the lewd ones
Its really low
I know
Not really, ive already gone back like a month of this chats history and downloaded like around 100 pictures
I see you don't put your trust in Tsubasa to steal Maria away
Tomosato
Ooh now im curious, do you have any photos that ship the two S.O.N.G bridge members, Fuji and Tomato
Thats fine
Is this a situation where I have to say stop for you to stop? Because in that case keep going!
I wasn’t expecting such a literal interpretation
I’m a believer of the phrase “when you think you’ve hit rock  bottom, life throws you a shovel”
Mainly how the anime handled her “conquest”
I’m partial to the tsundere
Swoon
Its on my buy list
I got that

I too watched it recently
Is that Grisaia?
Damm, i really love the “girls doing moves” art
Seeing him with a neck beard looks weird
Is that pic depicting Kirika’s SS during s4?
I figured as much
This is sort of the thing im going for
That one isnt what i had in mind, but it looks interesting I suppose
Is that Hibiki as Eviee?
Oh that kinda stuff is fine too
I have like two, i was hoping to expand that portion of my collection
Can people hit me up with cat girl symphogear users?
Its marking your property

Most likely a subreddit of some kind
<@99158582326497280> my friend sent me that one, no idea where he got it from
W-w-wrong place?






Would thou like more?










Ill throw what fluffy yuri i have on me



Hepta and a half conversion? Gungnir got greyed out bc of the fools stone backfire
Semi-perfect yuri mode till im told otherwise
They gray one
NH
I know i said unified Biki but is there an actual name for that forme or can we just dub it almost perfect yuri forme
Do we have art of Golden Biki and Unified Biki?
I see
Niice
Because it’s now my birthday, can I get some sweet gear art?
So im going to guess there isnt a s4 version of the “how much i enjoyed symphogear” graph?
I think that version was just its now 3d
I mean im not sure how one would do s4 but there has to be a version right?
Is there a version of this with S4?
Don’t even look like Yuuji even bothered with a coffin
They give her a smaller grave in the game?
If theres art for that i shudder to imagine the art for Suou’s backstory
Michiru’s arc was one of my favourites from the anime
I figured as much
No problem
This all stemmed from me asking for raptor girls
Kazama?!
Also that xray pic makes more sense being read left to right
Thats great and really cute
So whats the plot of this, it similar to Musume where dude gets a monster girl dumped on him?
Lol
Anime adaptation when?
Yeah wheres the yuri
Wow
The dino raptors
Its a raptor girl
But instead of cats
Sort of like cat girls
Yes?
Does art of Raptor girls exist?
Hell yeah thanks fam
Wait is there art of Elfnein and Carol doing the fusion dance?
Im not 100% certain tho
https://touch.pixiv.net/member_illust.php?mode=medium&illust_id=57479770 i believe it is this comrade
I did some digging
Hoo boy
Its Kay and Darjeeling tho
Heres my avatar bc ima change it now
Roseship.......

f
Rin is God

They are also of varying lewdness
I do have like nearly 2000 pics
I dunno if i can spam kawaii pics while also being in a newspaper meeting
I dunno?
Im at school
Im not complaining but still
I KNOW RIGHT?
Fuck it, you got any sympho girls being symphogay then?
Ok then, anybody have the gif of Tsubasa cutting that battlestar in half with the heavenly dragon wrath?
Any of you have the gif of Megumin slapping Yun Yun’s Yun Yuns?
Thanks!
Have you guys got pictures sort of like this, with Girls doing gear moves?
Man is it weird that i want Tsubasa pics now?
Very
Actually i dont
Shoulda left it at sii
Yeah
Thanks joe-sempai
Hearthstone died for this
I shall save all of them
Just unload your gifs onto me Joe
Thats an amazing fucking name
Oh my god
You gotta kirika vs god beam?
I need a new logo for my whatsapp group chat
Any of you have a good pic of all 6 gear users?
I feel like ive accidentally dived into a scary world of military animes and guns
Im adding stuff to my list but its sunday and i dont have time to start anything new
Is there any modern military animes?
Like i feel dirty about how little elfnein x carol i have
I have that and the fusion dance
I have a really small amount of Elfnein x Carol
Its as if they were one
I mean they are very close now
She can’t handle her caffeine
Sharo from GochiUsa



Thanks baby
This is my 2000th photo
No gen punching heavens wrath
“Maria-neesan”?
How bout Serena?
Like just post them and when i wake up ima downlaod ALL of them!
Oh no, i have sustained severe injuries! Chris is too kawaiiiiii
Ginmie like 5 minutes to save these all
Dakka always helps
Guns > tiddies
Rifles are an art form in of itself
In the scope of things, yes they are
Sounds like a good cuddle pillow
Took me a while bc huge melons applies to a huge chunk of the cast
Oh the giant
Which one was Tio, been a while since ive seen musume





I shall return some in the process
Thank for fluffy art
Theres like god knows how many tanks in the oorai team alone
Man ive actually forgotten that Yukari was the loader
Is that fluffy x popteamepic?
Was Hannah flat?
This is why Finè tried to blow up the moon
So im fine!
I cant do sign language
So if it goes any lower would that mean an integer overflow would occur?
I had a negative interest in science
Pfff, those arent REAL numbers
im scared
WHAT IS ALGEBRA IF NOT WORDED NUMBERS? IF THERE ARE NO NUMBERS THERE ARE NO ALGEBRA!
Theres no numbers! Its just algebra!
I didn’t see baby serena
Who’s the middle girl?
I mearly collect pics, sources is another thing entirely

I only have some of this collection, not all of them



Plenty gay
Well its on my list, ill get round to it
Whats it referencing?
If i was at school and a teacher saw that last one I wouldn’t see my phone for a week
Should be fine thanks
“Sfw art”
Wait shit theres 2 yuris!
I have those yuri
Indeed you did
I think you did, but ive basically used all of them up
Preferably Symphogear, but anime be fine
A new phone background
I wana new phone background, can yall provide?


P U R I F I C A T I O N

This is amazing
Gnite
Also don’t dump pics on me cause I should’ve slept an hour ago
That be a good lock screen
Im disappointed in my lack of Tsubasa pics
I was looking at the wrong place
Ah
Did i not say pantsu?
Currently i have Dapper Tsubasa and Edgebiki
Kiri on a pole is a really nice pic but pantsu so probably wont use that as a background
And break and lunch is more or less free game for phone use
We can use phones in lessons to look shit up if we need to, but otherwise don’t text in class and ur fine
Dam
I was looking for phone backgrounds
And also would have a talking to
Flesbians


Rukia i need basas, you got any more?
My brain says Kanade and Serena
Yay more basa
What a grave ship

Wasnt my fault
I already re did the megu binge
All ive got left is hunting through fucktons of subreddits
This chat however was 10% of what was missing <:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
Right ive successfully gone back through the chat to save all the pics ive lost
Well embark in few hours
I am enbark on brave adventure by scrolling all the way up to December, savinf photos alonf the way!
This is my life rn, slowly trying to rebuild
For some strange reason when i  try to go back around end December time on this chat i cant look at photos
This was my autism outlet
Really really bad rn
I hate this kinda depressing feeling bc it only really goes away with time
Ima try to cover up my losses when i wake up...
Fuck i dont even have my avatar photo anymore
Ive lost a solid 2 months of photos
And the backup didnt work
Well 1,000 of those have just fucked into the wind
So you know how i said i have around 2,500 ish photos?
But i wanted to see more Miu
Feels like Maika
Its been an hour wheres the dump?

The lich
Wiz
Megumin arc hype
Not to mention whats gonna be in s3
Some really cool scenes were left out in s1 and 2
Is so good
You read the LN <@!245359314980569100> ?
Same with me
I get you
Its a pretty good character comedy show
What do u think of the succubus shop from Konosuba?
I mean Kanade is deep inside Biki
Cat gears in XDU when?
Sort of like marmite?
git gud?
https://takelessons.com/live/japanese/japanese-honorifics-z05
My 3000 are unsorted
...Ry-Sama.....
How big is ur collection Ry?
The problem with having 3000ish pics is that im not sure what ive already saved
<:MariaBliss:336657061209309184>
Tsubasa deep inside Maria
she coughs out, blood bubbling in her throat
The airheads edge is as sharp as ever

Its not symetrical AAAAAAHHHH
Thats not Honoka’s dad
Nico > Yohane
Love live sunshine anyway
Heres some love live

Mio

The Nephilim really bit off more than it can chew

https://i.imgur.com/c0oCTaq.gif this has many applicable uses

if its like that ill give it a shot
not the show content part
as in the recomending part
oh so sorta like symphogear?
whatever it is?

isnt that purple?
the internet
Grave of the Fireflies is a yuri anime too
DBZ is a yuri anime
reminds me of that girl from Student Council's discression who kept shipping the protag and another dude that she made
Marilyn Monroe...
sort of like how Popteamepic just exists as a thing?
Thats my belief
They gay they just dont know it
I got guys but i aint got yaoi
/r/lizthelich

/r/wholesomeyuri is a great place
Miu and Mideri
Kaho has the cook, Manager has... well HAS is a strong word....
i dont think there would be that many yuri ships in this show

im looking through my collection rn for any yuri blend s
my fav is def pharamercy








that was a portion of the Mio i got


















Mugi is good too

I think of myself as a quality over quantity collector anyway ^^
Like since start of September
Well ive been collecting for a while
Here is your ping pic
Thing about my collection is that i have a specific taste
That was plus 80 ish?
ill make the zip tomorrow if my internet is better
with small spikes to 200 kb
8 kb a sec
urgh its fucking up....

im not satisfied with my pronunciation in DS to record myself just yet
although im learning Dangerous Sunshine and Radiant Force in my spare time
im doing it as part of /r/anime sings
ive got the end of the month to learn pop team epics op
ive been neglecting my singing practice whoops
my computer is being an arse however rn
well as soon as my computer starts downloading the files off my phone ill prep that zip
the bosslady knows where we all live

EMBRACE IT ALL
EMBRACE THE YURI SOLO
isnt there a pic of all the symphogear girls wearing beautiful spy glasses?
both are valid answers
Spy Glasses
<#336297808221044736>
NSFW channel

Wouldn’t the hands be Gen?
omg YES
i see
and you use some website which you go onto using your phone or pc to join the game
i plan to stream the screen using youtube
best answer is voted by everyone else
then the two answers are compared
2 players get same prompt
you write funny answer
well players are given a funny prompt
check <#336300750248476693> for time
its a game thing which you dont need to own but can still participate
That looks like ignite and dragon
Kerrik
Might i ask you if you are joining in for the Symphogear Quiplash?
Might i ask you if you are joining in for the Symphogear Quiplash?
Lol
i still cant view it <:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
just my provider being a right tosser
im a brit
it sometimes spikes to 100 for a brief second before going back to the bare minimum
8.0 kbps
this wifi is 4th world grade
well thats actually unfair to the computer
my computer is so slow those images you sent hadnt loaded in the time it took for me to get my phone and look at it through discord
the fuck am I doing the daily thing on the subreddit when this guy is selling coke when i got weed?
question then
my collection number could probably be reduced by 10 because im not good at remembering if i have duplicates or not
>sorting
whoops
thats what i end up doing lol
<:TsubasaYareYare:407397617451139073> why go to Pixiv when others can do it for you
The collection stands at 3,566, lets see how much hibimiku will increase this
that was WFC
oh yeah
as it uploads to my drive
you gotta wait 30 minutes
right
i did throw in the chrisxtsubasa ones tho
bc kerrik literally just did those ones
oh btw i didnt include the cat pics which kerrik posted like earlier today
i barely reached 100
just need to stick it to google drive
although it probably pales to what Kerrik has
well ill dump my basa pics then
Cat girl zwei wing is good
Yeah thats the one
The link to the first image isnt working for me
<@!127644949884698624> here be gooooooood yuri
On the plus side i can still do pings

I am contempt in lying down and being sad till tomorrow!
Let me do that tomorrow
Errr whoops
Kerrik are you a brit?
no? the Hibimiku dump...
finds? that was all from Kerrik's dump
+200 ish
<:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
^^
most of those pics came from this chats past
nice
thats it?
<:HibikiGold:370774300883419136>
i put anything which had basa in it
if theres anything in that which you dont already own i will be suprised
https://drive.google.com/open?id=1xtlQRqie-ZRFfBptYNSIbNVmkZ9XNjZc
that would be a worser nightmare
what if biki came to your home and set fire to everything you owned?
Chris's hair is the custodians
the cat girl one not yours Kerrik
reminds me ever so slightly of Lily's work

Don’t think they any good iOS vpns
I would try with a vpn but i dont got one
The website one dont
That one works
Maybe Theresa has implemented her internet blocks
I think its just danbooru doesn’t work for me :/
Sadness that link doesnt work for me
Het
Het?
Vore?
Dikkie?
Also boss the other place is scary they dont believe in gay gears
Boss heres some gay here too
Harem basa?
“sfw”
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>

<@!127644949884698624> can there be more then one ping for pic person?
bunny hibimiku is super cute

And now im home

I am in class
Did you temporarily give me a role then pinged me?

Also what happens if i have a role and the role is pinged?
If i pinged myself would i have to post a pic?
?
Why I asked others
I am curious
And Chris
The sword is just too cute
Putin then marries David Cameron
“They ruined my gay girls”
Putin launches nuke at Japan
Makes your burning of Tokyo look like a sparkler
yami comes in with a steel chair
I could understand if it wasn’t Symphogear... but when it comes to the show theres far too much implicit gayness
Anybody know why that chris chap dislikes me?
While im here
And shipping
“They wana stick their dicks in their waifus”
My non-anime friend put it out simply
That kinda stuff
HFY, DnDgreentext, Talesfromretail
I browse the creative writing/ story stuff
I lurk heavy
It depends where you go
Assemble the pieces
By drawing cards?
I thought you vould never ask
sorry
memoria
fuckin
thats from the OVA no?


I need this
Plz kerrik
Not chris and dess
Basa and dess
Btw i ask for basa and dess bc I think they’ve spoken to eachother the least
I enjoyed the Biki and Jii thing you did

Yami goes and Solo tries to fill in the void

“Pinger”




neko kanade tho

<@!263983345669505025> how much Kanade you packing?

my one regret in life is not being able to roll dapper basa memoria
i have an unexplicable urge to rewatch Tanya now...
Sure
<@!263983345669505025> Gib Lieur, make it flashy
Leiur is great
Hell maybe Joe and gang are working on 2016
Oh 2016? Hell if i know

Aoi i believe groped a still picture of Chris
Ask Joe bout it
I think Yamete is on it
And you have to talk to other people bout live stuff bc i didnt go
CD soon
So id imagine CD soon
Full ver was done at the live

(That I know)
All dem girls
I save all
Isnt that only Symphogear stuff?
No need to add fuel to the fire that is high functioning autism
No thanks i want to TRY and be prod
I don’t go on Pixiv
(And the other one but this ones a bit better)
My Symphogear source is this discord
Lol
Around 600 of my photos came from you
>competition
Then all the stuff you dump
I typically get 10-20 a day
No im trying to figure out your pace compared to mine
How much do you say you get a day?
Ill do it when i go on the computer
Yep


Alright my image thing is shattered....


Theres a flaw


Hmmmg

Wait hold on


I watched the 2016 live, wasnt subbed but pretty cool
I mean
/s
whats a kingdom hearts

Shinku
but thats a tale for nsfw
i mean if im gonna figure out fetish i should probably first figure out what the fuck i am :p

the rest are fucked to a degree
i have one friend i consider "sane"
hoo boy

whoops i linked the wrong vid :p
i was on the fence but he kicked me off it
i love this blokes vid bc it changed my mind
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrBH3IYRjaw
i mean i believe rn Sun and Moon are getting into the whole "plot" stuff
thats an understatment
Ashs lowest was when he failed to defeat basic gym leaders in Unova
i refuse to believe that Ry
i dunno, i think ash taking out darkrai and latios MIGHT beat out Ash-Greninja
as a kid watching it, i was hoping after darkrai would be like 5 magikarp
i would pick Tobias over Alain any day
PTSD intensifies
serena is like my fav goofball helpless romantic
it was pretty good, but Serena tho
mmm
and that was some BEAUT battle
they did the whole come back to Kanto
it isnt a contest
Black and White
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
Sun and Moon >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
and is currently watching sun and moon
Ry as someone who binge watched Black and White
the league didnt happen
did ash jobbing throw you off?
THE worst
like
unova is the worst pokemon series ive watched
so much better then unova
that was pretty damm good
not XY?
>Lillie
best girl is Ash get real
its quite comfortably made its transition to a school anime
i dont think that at all
the thing that replaced pokemon was Symphogear
yall are nothing to the first anime my autistic brain got severly addicted to
NEW DUB EPISODES BYE
oh yeah speaking of pokemon
i know what it is
<:GenjuurouThumbsUp:336657189475188740>

Brock is so buff his nipples have been absorbed into him
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Bp1f88_LWg

If you plan to dump photos, no more then 50 images. Any more and you should consider another method rather than Discord, like Google Drive.
lets say something like...
im going back to my role of general general
with a large amount of tank girls
i just smuggled into his market for a small moment
Kerrik is the mass market quantity person anyway
but theres pics missing from that
also there exists a zip of my entire collection
ive zipped up basas from my collection and sent that to pats
already did that
good evening
well
good morning
no way was any of them pornographic
i got all of them from /r/awwnime
fair
too excessive?
what would you consider what i did then?
i understand

yeah i was considering doing that but hindsight is a bitch
<@255412045933969408> heres GuP art comrade
we have lots of art
that wasnt all of them because some failed
sorry
be careful what you wish for










NICE
tess

<@!127644949884698624> put Sakimori in the ping for pics group

Yukari is Asian

i was already laughing at the ridiculousness of the situation but when she pulled that out i had to pause to give myself a laugh break
all the things that make yukari great. Immense backpack, trumpet, WW2 era grenade... WAIT
<#336297674707828747>
I was only looking for a new avatar
Meh

<@!263983345669505025> grats on 10k
Its You’s bday from lovelive sunshine so send You pics
I was thinking “wfc is drunk”
the thing is they all have the same eye colour so i feel hair also could have been switched too
bc Kanade is shy and Chris is not shy
ah
crossover it is
oh i thought it was girls in different hair styles
eyeing it

Nadeshiko is giving the scarf to rin, but sayin we gon play when we get home
Never mind i misread the translation
Shimarin is meowing
Nadeshiko is saying you get the scarf back when we get home
This is mega gay
Keerik you know when you reach 20k im giving you an updated ver of my collection, hopefully minus any duplicates I already sent
Doesn’t really have a sorting method
The collection is on a phone
Bc I didn’t give it to you out of laziness
That’s the bits you aren’t seeing
Increase that number by like 1000 ish
Kek


You have megumins
In anycase
And then proceed to keep them unsorted
Im sayin any sorting you did would be sorting i would need to do
They are
So you basically did all the sorting i wanted?
I would download this only bc you sorted this for me <:GarieWink:336657101273169921>
I give a present for 10k and you give chunks of it to the world
Oof
(I mean its basically my gigantic pile of konosuba, yuru camp and k-on art)
Man writing AU Hibiki and Miku are gon be fun



i know
Not really sfw but I’ll save it anyway
Oh whoops

why did you pull out a pic from the meme folder
better question
ok
when on earth did your collection of pics become memes?

Thanks joe
I’m looking for the source so i wouldnt know, joe
<@255412045933969408> did you by chance send me this and if so you have a source for it?

especially since it would be sorted on my computer and not my phone
its far too late for me to start sorting now
yea
They just go into the main part
They dont go in the 2018 folder
Any new photos i download
And my phone things a pic of the silence i doenloaded was from 2011
Because it downloaded and sorted based on date
Have 1 image in them
3 of those folders

Gib source Shirabe
<@&425667771699822614> I’m currently unavailable to do daily fanart, so might i bother to to cover for today and potentially tomorrow?
I should watch RWBY
But yang didnt die in ep1 so I presume kanade is still kanabae?

on a subconscious level
i was aware of the dupes

question
with nearly 100 images on my folder screen at once

<@256945399338631168> i found something

GAH G KIRIKA WHERE THE HELL ARE YOU

Rude
You saying kiri is a mutt?
Gnite
Kerrik do you have germain x kirika?
Or germain x anyone
None of these are chris x basa
If it wasnt for the whole chat log thing I would’ve had no idea what happened that night
Yeah i think i got it now bc its much earlier and thus my brain is actually absorbing stuff
You have to work twice as hard now
Kerrr
~~now how else am i gonna build up a cult of pic people~~
Ok i think I understand now
Oooh
My attention span is a little short
She wants in so whenever that happens
Also with lily
If outside wants to be ping for pics he can
Yeah so saki

My fav pic is too far up
A real surprise would be non gear art

You should go for it tho
I dunno scrmz, you probably would look good in twin tails
Yes?
Err
Twintails are cute
Id rather be her


But its nice caring about how you look
Although for me it was like “i dont care about myself and how i appear”
Yeh i used to be like that too
Just gotta find a solid hair stylist
See if you could straighten it?
Oof

No pantsu
<@!263983345669505025> this is sfw!
<@!263983345669505025> hit me with a serena
Im calling the police
<:MariaShock:423196877354303498>
Feels weird saying it now but being referred to as female feels really good still
See kerrik delivers
Or how im not looking for tiddies
Collars/leashes can be sfw
<@!263983345669505025> new request, collars/leashes
I will be there laughing at those falling
When twin tails rise up to destroy human civilisation
Tail red has an ideology worth fighting for!
I know that, I’m mainly a twintails fan because thats how i show my gratitude to Twintails
Hair?
The subreddit one run bu trans people and tje otjer one
Where i wouldve found there was 2
If i found it before Symphogear I probably wouldnt be here because I would’ve tried to find a twintails discord
But yeah twintails the anime is great
High risk high reward!
They would find the real world crushing
Just dont tell soji that
But my twintails option?
Now my actual opinion of them is too much effoet
And if you hold twintails close to your heart you can do anything to defend your love for them
Twintails are the best female attribute by far.
Its twintails
Twintails appeal isnt fanservice
🇬🇧
Well im a switch so what does that make me?
Had more than pointless ass shot
Twintails are more sexier
Not really no?
I actually rewatched ep 1 today
Ill have you know Sojis love for twintails makes her a massive creep /s
Its fanservice done right
No outside plz
Until i do it for <#371105434771390465>?
Do you want to wait
~~i wish i was her~~
Oh yea
I can call kriisa a good girl all i want but if she does it to me its a trip to prison
Scrmz has nitro so
Any yall have food fantasy art?

Gameplay doesnt appeal to me
I kinda dont wana get peach beach splash tho
Maybe ill get it then
Oh?
My computer is a bit crap
Feelsbad
I was looking on the psn store if they had bon appetit but it looks like Vita only
I like how in the game the stories they had was either “im mute!” or “my grandfather stole my body to assault my friends!”
Next game marriage scene plz
**YES**
<:MikuBliss:336657233712513024>
Its either Ryona, Homura or maskless Murky
Hmmm
Hard....
Game play wise or character wise
The line i have is *very* random
It passed the line of too lewd for me to save
I did
The amount of bikini stuff...
I need more kagura art of girls looking powerful not lewd with barely any clothes on



Oh no me and scrzms are in sync again
She has a cold
Uncultured shipper
Its yuiazu
<@!263983345669505025> some nice germain thanks

*yes*
*ive actually had tempura soba and it was... average*
She tried to become tempura soba
Shes the professional masochist
I mean do it and ill look at them later maybe
Sounds like a Ryona thing
Ryona is very the lewd
It was a battle similar to Bon Appetit
But what if
Wonder who would win between Daidouji and Hibiki








Seems to be pretty precise combo based tho
Haven’t played her enough

Kerrik always means right, just sometimes you can end up being too cautious that you make mistakes

Let ne recheck the serious discussion article thing i send
I remember there was a better ending for the homo bit
Nothing else
Yea kerrik only speaks American
IIRC, Scandinavian languages are pretty gendered no?
<:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
Shes a mod what you expect
It makes us sound very powerful
Can they say the big gay tho
The big gay
Kerrik as my right of someone who is just an individual and you shouldnt take as a representative of anything, let alone the LGBTQ+ community
Outside why is she so sucky to play as


Cant we just call all gay people the big gay?
we need to show these neppers that gears are superior
ok kerrik, spam symphogear
why the hell is nep in the channel topic 👀
wait





*yuri campers yay*

She was like 40 and I basically was like “sure lets just finish the last 10
Mostly just because i leveled her so much when i was doing her shinobi story
I got level 50 for kafuru
Oh yea

Extreme mitsu

When you put it like that I realise im a fuckin idiot
<@!102691114762371072> question for the future. Should all the art this beauty of a woman does for me go here or somewhere else?
~~maybe i should pay to be drawn in a Symphogear~~
Who would be so narcissistic to post drawings of themselves
Kerrik by the nature that im posting those here i must be on some levels smug
Gah double pings!
<@106861977086779392> and <@483865763837378561> you can both have this <3

Or maybe Germains outfit
Now I need to pay to be drawn in a Symphogear <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
So yea I made the Christmas one my lock and home screen
Also i think my next glasses frame is gonna be red :P
Maybe I should make both my lock and home screen the Christmas one :D
Mm
Or this full body of me
What do i make my home screen for my phone, the Christmas full body of me
Guys i have somewhat weird question

Shirabe and kirika are the twins
Looks like bikki is the harem girl
Kanade is the prince

<@!263983345669505025> do you have the symphogears doing persona 5 all out attack cards?

Oh xen you wana see my sort of fluff where my pfp comes from?
Its the shemmy pfp


Fluf
Well you are aware its a slur now
TL;dr gender is a fuck and anime accidentally helps give fuel to the Tr*p people <:sadcowboy:510303995215085569>
As far as i know they don’t throw bones at exploring that
Anime do be like that
Def GNC
But ive seen some stuff to say maybe NB/gender non-conforming
Especially considering Astolfo’s character is very much “heehoo i look feminine” from what ive read
I mean speculation on a character’s gender identity from a media which isnt the most knowledgeable about the idea of gender identifies is big oof
You have a jojo section?
Wife’s using her as a pfp so we match now

They share
As a piece of media
I mean solo chainsaw man seems right up your alley as well
Plus from a panel in the manga as well
Well its the collar and the attempted art style which sells it to me being chainsaw man inspired
Not a person

free me
~~if someone is stupid enough to want to sort through my images to find all the cute gay art tho~~
but err i know ive got quite a few images that likely just dont exist anymore
i want to at some point purge all the images i have
anyway
yes
look horny trans girl mentality is unquestionable ikxi ok
i save whatever gets me saying goals or mood
i dont just save symphogear
help me
of just images
im nearly 50k
i mean
im nearly 48k
i got to 5k images in it
was actually years ago
the last time i tried to sort the lewds
i dont even want to imagine looking through it
and now its gotten so big
i just save images for stimming
48,557 unsorted images

Valid
You say that but I don’t wana white wash myself if that makes sense
Except one thing im dealing with is the struggle of being brown and feeling like a lot of the aesthetics that i want fitting more with white girls
Unironically what i want to rock with irl
Maybe next time I’ll actually invest in punk rakhi
I should fuckin get more done of me
3_skip <@!331908049822547978> whatdoyaknow I actually have a sketch of me smirking wowzers
Dats some really detailed undergear
Finé
P5 is very much a game which co-opts anarchist imagery to say “the way to change society is to get rid of the specific individual causing the problems rather than changing society as a whole”
Its also homophobic and transphobic but you know that kinda gets pushed by the wayside when you cant even treat women right
And does the shit anime trope of “oppsie man accident oogle her”
Like how Anns character arx is about fighting a teacher who wants to abuse his position to abuse his pupils in… nsfw ways

And the game sexualises her with her catsuit outfit
The persona series is really good if you dont think too hard about certain things
Unironically I believe the cat is an incel
Incel cat

Theory
Where do I discuss something which is both something from steel ball run of jojos but also has spoilers concerning Symphogear
Post that shit here
<3
<@!290431224596660224> as a professional geetah player do you wana give it a listen?
Ill try and listen to it when i get the time
<#336310266654490624>
Why does that remind me of kirika’s zesshou
They sang in space
In OG
Like <:sweatguy:250068649488941076>
Casually lifting shirabe up for attacks
Why is kirika so gay
so DMjii
and Jiiiiiii
its Dark Magician
they are the gayest
*again*
and its actually DMJII that get fucked hard
is a red herring
all this forshadowing
what if
The one bikki saved
Remember the rocket scientists from GX?
That girl is gonna become relevant again.
how does it feel to be outdone by XDU
solo whats darker your fic or the wedding dresses
oh god solo
thats *mostly* right
and kirika gets shivers because its the cringy letter she wrote
in the OVA's they reference that they found some kinda letter
to shirabe but then discarded
that she wrote
she sings about a letter
in kirkas b side
ah
you mean jiii?
which one
<@185949743321579520> hell in GX they stole some linker from the medical room
**SHIRABE IS GONNA BE IN DANGER NOT MIKU**
"FINE I FOUND YOU"
AND IS LIKE
AND LOOKS AT SHIRABE
WAKES UP
IF THE PILLARMAN
WHAT
WAIT
in G Shirabe almost died
<@!81815015224516608> GAMBARE!
11/10
But personally
Objectively speaking Symphogear isnt the best show
Im pretty sure the only reason im here is a severe case of stockholm syndrome ^_^
Symphogear is good?
Episode 9
Listen you all are fools to believe the miku foreshadowing when it’s actually DMJii who are in danger!
Theres gonna be an elaborate puzzle and they are gonna get fucked
*ITS FORESHADOWING*
These girls didnt get good education
Because its supposed to be summer
She thought it would be warm
Bikki isnt smart
Kaneko wills it
Climate change is all finés fault
So... since kadingir
Like “most recent years”
Heck
Was i the only one who thougt elfnein meant the moon fucked shit up?
And another fucko SHOT IT
Cause some fucko dragged it a lil closer
Also I believe that was a reference to the moon fucking up the climate no?
Why
?
We bout to start suffering tho
Probably
Hey Symphogear made me change in a pretty radical way do that’s pretty dope
Thats why half life 3 will be crap if it comes out
Nothing can ever match what you hype something up to be
Could it be the wait?
Because i know solo disliked the axz ending so much he wrote the best fanfic ever
Dunk, is the reason you dislike Symphogear because of how the writing and meat of the show is, or because you personally dont enjoy it
~~miku~~
Zababa transformation?
Oh you mean the og gear transformation?
We aint seen the rest
So is the heart appearing behind bikki’s transformation indicating that they basically have alcha-gears now
Ends with both of them zesshouing
Miku shirabe duet
Are you able to sue kaneko if he steals your ideas
*my Sunshine*
Miku is gonna be the one who called the noise to attack the concert
*the old die first*
chris basa maria are the older ones
oh no
Hibibasa or kiribasa
the corpse is gonna look right at shirabe
<:blobaww:493931884087214081>
||rip shirabe||
||Just by saying that I'd be home soon, I was hurting you. I didn't even give you the chance to be the one to protect me||
Yeah but its Symphogear how much of the song is actually gonna get played
Has anybody translated bikki’s b-side? Was that not released with bikkis album?
Is this targeted bullying
Just realised tsubasas thousand tears didnt get an attack card
Cause i feel like thats what they wanted <a:MichaNod:493803314593660958> to be but failed
So which one is the vampire one
||they played the same music too fuckin hell||
This feels like the gayest season
Turns out there was more season 1 callbacks than I thought
That was sarcasm
||hey Symphogear wont jump to darkness too quickly right?||
Millhi knows me best <3
A link will do
Does anyone have a link to kirikas transformation?
They been stalking
The OP implies
But also
What gave you that impression
Spoiler tagging cause meta is literally watching the ep rn now btw :p
I mean they know about ||the concert||
Fuck i can actually see that happening tho
Miku is gonna use it to fist hibiki
Yes you do its the pullarmun
Inb4 xv kneecaps my sunshine on the suffering scale
Theres more episodes coming up tho
Oh solo
And oh lord im not gonna be prepared for it
Its gonna be a scary fall
I can see the dip
Symphogear is like a rollercoaster
Something about being a sword makes you mentally unstable
Also rip tsubasas mental state
Rip miku
THOSE FUCKERS POINTED  A GUN ON ELFNEIN
WHEN DID HIBIKI BECOME A FUCKING STAND USER
That they knew about fudous plans
Whos not to say
It’s probably not gonna be effective considering they have to pull back and deal with the people that hired the trip
I mean we’re getting the setup to extreme suffering
If swords cant sing how can she use her gear <:Thinkki:514552069563088896>
That bikki tease was beautiful
Maybe her one is *dark and edgy*
Still havent seen basas transformation
What the show might do is flex a golden form every episode
Chris is shooting rockets and suddenly shes imbued with the power of love shots
Are in the other gears
What if cag and prelati
Wait
you think bikki just took their powers?
What if shirabe saves basa
As in fuck the risks everyone *dies*
You know fudou has put a gun against the precious deck rats... maybe she breaks out of her rut violently
Or a deck rat
Whos not to say they aint gonna shoot elfnein
Elfnein has a gun to her head
Even jf they didnt
Did they even make a report tho
carol help
Right next Saturday is gonna be rough
Oh righty yeah there’s literally no song orders
Abuse nep
Miku has been alone for a long while
But they cant go against fudou cause that means to surrender or die
Well fudou probably plans to sacrifice them
What did Shirabe actually say?
And bikki murders adam
But that doesn’t make sense tho cause ver helps maria
If ver was the snake
Wait
He landed into gear universe
When kars shot into space
What if
Sanviento
Whats his name...
JoJo was bad guys this whole time
Until im told otherwise
That corpse is a pillarman
Listen
Serena was alive this entire time and turned into tiki to fuck adam
Maria was fucking adam behind everyones back confirmed
Adam
I mean it could be maria is the only perceptive one
Thats a fucking massive mistranslation
Btw did any of us figure out whatbhat weird song was?
No
Lul
Doesnt make me any less of a gear fan
All i got is a ps4
I aint gonna stream illegal anime on my damm phone
... maybe not be gatekeepy
How hard can it be?
I mean also they haven’t released all of AXZ which is interesting
How is... Symphogear a MHA ripoff tho
Evil yohane will probably be sacrificed for fudous plans
Symphogear is suffering
And elfnein will drink her blood and become evilyohane2
See you fools dont get it mikus going to actually be not alived
<:Thinkki2:514552069550637066>
Also i swear ive seen somewhere about Tsubasa burning down a city...
The XV live would be a little awkward if a va whos character died had to come sing no?
You know forgive me if im a bit slow on this
do not throw
theres more bodies
what if
elfnein goes
if carols body goes
"i have no idea who any of you are but why is there so much gay tension between yall"
elfneins gon be like "the fuck is a miku"
how does alchemy work
remind me
oh memories eh?
More leiur was good tho
Thus i don’t think she’s getting out of the chateau alive
Carolnein has the knowledge which would rapidly speed up the plot due to knowledge
Im betting shes dead by ep8
And how long will carol last before she die
Is it carol or adult elfnein
So the question is
while also learning what love is
i mean elfnein couldve done that
And knocked up Maria’s mum
Ver is a custodian
Hibiki’s fist is a nuke
Fudou has ver in chains
The spirits of the past protect you
“Died”
Dr ver died in the chateau
Oh god oh fuck
Why wouldnt fudou be even stronger than him
Gen is strong as fuck
Yoooo i think we sleeping on something
Confirmed ver is coming back yall
Is the next ep gonna be called metanoia then
Miku got my sunshine’d
Symphogear is suffering
Hea gonna come back to *die immediately*
Shirabe is beat up, untransforms and dies via asphyxiation
Gears on the moon?
We still have the space expedition
YO WAIT
The Symphogears had this
They launched a fuckin nuke
I think america deserves it lmao
When is the Americans gonna nuke
Mind control? Bah, you fool! My mind is already owned by Kanade!
Like Chris
Basa does a double betrayal
What if
Its up to the severely depressed and demoralised S.O.N.G, Elfnein with her stand Genocide and Genocide, and maybe hopefully Finé
Interrupting whatever ritual is gonna end miku apparently
A god from *a* machine
Hibiki
soo
What even is 15min
Whats not to say hibiki is still gonna be connected to miku
And also something something balal
So they are gayer than we thought
Also... hibiki had a dream where miku went away...
Miku will probably be comatose
Probably after xv finishes airing
Listen the og emote makers are... i think only alice is barely here? Who knows
She was peekin her head up
It was from the swimsuit episode of gx
Thanks elfnein
The reason the god slayer works is people put their faith in the spear to kill a god
Errr, the implication is gods gather their power *from* faith
Shem-ha will gather some
What is a god without followers
Shirabe was the first to come to mind
Look
Its this one
But if theres any season for death
I actually really like shirabe
I dont
Kaneko has said many things
Arent they gonna do another movie tho
What is a god slayer but a god with extra steps
Something something madoka
Wrong ed
Yuri good end I have little hopes
Shirabe is a descendant of finé
Shem-ha is a god
Gods are said to create life
What if it was fine all along
Who is shirabe
Especially on her deathbed
Shirabe would believe anything
To shirabe
Finé’s word... that she died
We only have her word for it
Who even said finé died
Yeah no shit
Symphoscience
Listen
Your removing the registers to find it
You arent deleting it
When you delete something off a computer
Well
Not physically no
Well... i mean
Her corpse is in Shirabe
Shem-ha in shinais xdd
Xv shinais
Oh god
Yeah
As fuck
Is edgy
Magical girl asuka
Or beserk
Is hibiki gonna despair
Thats... a good question
And also invent a hyper beserk
You just need to burn all of tokyo
*hibiki was never seen again*
Hibiki: i must go now, my wife needs me
Hes a hack playing the harp with our fucking heart strings
Rather than winning and then losing
With the gears losing then winning
Even ep1 changed the formula slightly
Has... anything this season been following the sympho trend?
Hence being called xv
Its ep12 degree of good
Shenha fell asleep
After going beserk because of fine
Sentient relic might nake sense
Its he
How do we know
Well
Who tf is the guy at the start
But then
Shem-ha is also adam’s warning
Gods are beyond gender lets go Japan
Can you... chill
Bikki is.. naïve
I mean thats likely
Hibiki isnt immune to divine power
Double also
As in punching through the divine power
Was hibiki
What if the trigger to awakening
Wait
What if shem-ha was sending unwanted dick pics and enki wanted a permanent block
We have 5 episodes left
And fucked up
Yeah what if he just shot the moon
Who knows why the birthplace of the gods survived
Athens eh?
Brexit was probably why the uk isnt part of the dark continent in this universe
Well actually
The dark continent
Somewhere in europe?
Where did carol even come from
Speaking of carols dad
Would carol’s dad even died
Without the curse
Well actt
It must be a fucking intense piece of jewellery then
Well
Enki is in kirika
Inb4
Could just be proto-sapians
But any ideas for other locations?
I imagine europe and the moon
The question is tho, where else will gear go
Would explain why he was bleeding out
Welcome
<:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592> is suffering
is there a place to find all of the xdu comics for xv?
its time for one of them to die now
shirabe and kirika have done their part
🌝
always about the dess that girl
this it just seems "oh fuck were in damger, its time for our NO U machines!"
with ignite they stabbed themselves
just when they feel like it?
right but whats the activation trigger
how does amalgam even work
i have question
ah right
oof
inb4 oxygen deprivation
SHIT THE MOON IS ACTUALLY A SPACE STATION THO
*Thats no moon...*
*Kadingir intensifies*
i see only one solution
if the earth is now red
shes been playing too much red dead 2
its just a very big revolver
<:AiPTSD:528750139071004672> theres two episodes left
they could do duet to fight shemha and then chris does a dess in axz
wait
to fight vanessa
so chris bikki duet
Cause you stopped writing <:chi_dab:388832384558170112>
<@!263983345669505025> TASKETE
Fanfics are cursed
But you need to create good to counteract evil!
So solo when is dark end my sunshine xv edition?
Oh right speaking of shirabe
He extinguished it
He gave the accelerant and when the fire burned him
In gx and axz more specifically
Later on
Im saying
No
Ver with the shenshoujing
What is it with Symphogear and trying to redeem the unredeemable
I was thinking ver made it a Symphogear
Ok
Ahh
Fine didnt make the shenshoujing Symphogear right?
Wait wait wait
And well chris bikki didnt even happen
For tsumari they just went back to a G song
If you have shira kira songs you have a zababa duet
The zababa duet is a given
Hell what new songs did they use for their duets for xv anyway
Last i played FM was still viable
Admittedly i am being drip fed information whenever i glance at xdu
Its just the unisons iirc
As far as i know they dont even have shirakira duet cards
They already have amalgam
Why should they
Implying they even will
But they dont make substance
Swimsuits make good art
Nor is it what i want
XDU isnt cannon
~~also denying us a bikki chris duet~~
Hey chris got to basically solo vanessa <:mmLol:361540629563703296>
Yeah
Thats the expectation
Is not a great contribution
That
Which was to be expected tbh
Other than take elza out of action
What did they really do in xv
And also kirika
10 seconds
For like
Have a thought about who you are paring against
Again....
Sorry i just now got the weird idea that everything we’ve written is suddenly out to kill us
Hey solo can you beat up xd miku?
Kinda random... but yes. Superman would probably sweep hard
Limited time offee
If anyone gets the reference of my XD card they get one whole fanart
I was gonna go University of Lincoln but car crash soo
Also omg its midnight
*my waifu becomes real!*
Whoops i can act very off so maybe not that one
After you hit max level with a card can you no longer get that card?
**search again**
Krypto
Kiri is the face, Chris gives it face
With Chris-senpai
Also i swear Kiricoins unintentionally sounds like a crypto currency that she would *totally start*
Ono
~~update <#336297587802112011>~~
If anime club wasnt kinda... in the state it is in now would i have gotten crypto for running that?
Is that so?
~~does fanart posts count as a ways to earn crypto~~
Oh good!
So 75 gems every day, is that pretty much all the gems users will get?
On a scale of 1 to XDU how gacha hell is this gonna be
I see
Whats the levels for?
Ara?
*im learning*
Ok cool
So with that bot did you like build it and test it on another server and all you had to do then was invite it to another server?
Maybe Maria hates you or something
I got xdrive Shirabe
Chapter two of maintenance is a myth
Its ok
Stuff. Releasing chapters would probably earn some cryptos
I shouldnt have spent the starting 500
Whats the plans for memorias?
The answer was Death on Two Legs by Queen
An area they are both knowledgeable about
Saki or scrmz might get my reference more
Im using that as my thumbs up emoji here
<:Kiricoin:495336831978569759>
Was it from scratch or?
But it mustve been the funnest two days no?
Oh
How long did it take you?
I can see why
It is not a futurama reference
It is not just twintails
dess_give -5 latooni bug testing justincase
hold on
how do you do that?
How many deathrattles *did* you draw though
Picture
Choussei i need source for your pfp
shhh we arent supposed to talk about how Scrmz is a european trojan horse to invade this server and claim it for europe
kerrik help the mods are weird
go make ur coffee saki
you should get money for hosting WP
:hug:
thats really dum
Lead arms and Red Sniper is the same card
rv_mycardlist
oh wait hold on i need to check this
save coins till kanade gacha
Who’s getting a solo donation 👀
Dess_give number, name, reason
Its dess_give iirc
Taxes
will it be 1:1 conversion?
so id imagine the design in mind was specific girl tokens buy their respective girls
well theres hibiki tokens and tsubasa tokens for example
would we be able to trade tokens in for kiricoin?
Aaah bright mode my eyes!
Listen i like bike basa but **god**
I got 2 of the same max awakened card in a row
dess_give 50 <@!314877106825854977> ❤️❤️❤️
Will the tradition of no carol continue with RV?
~~maintenance coins~~
Wao
Is that the largest transaction in the history of Kiricoin?
Wao
But apparently there be plans so you can also make universal tokens
Yup
i was appealing to our sense of comradery?
but i wasnt guilt tripping you?
Alla til mig?
Hey kerrik remember ping for pics 👀
ara ara
how
wow kerrik you have a lot..
rv_mycardlist
So for example if i do something to show you my cards
The gacha produces cards from xdu
You get 75 coins a day and extra coins for doing stuff in the community
You spend coins spining on the gacha here
You get 500 coins and are registered in the system iirc
So if you do rv_signup
Feature pending though
the tokens will eventually let us buy specific cards
Helium
Thus bikki coin is just how you divide kiricoin
Bikki coins are bronze
Kiri coins are gold
Pff

<:ShirabeStare:336659688236122113>
~~its actually to kriisa but shhhh~~
🙏
everyone send your prayers to maria bot
Fight on Maria bot!
Its fine :p
For starters id say spin like 5 times on the grand opening gacha
Did that answer everything <@87512939107450880> ?
You can check the money you have with dess_$
Each card you get you get to give a name
No way to make coins until tomorrow <:NotLikePapika:284132078054932480>
My last spin for the year and i gooot.
A bikki token and a 2nd maria which I won’t know what it is until its max awoken
i think the announcement is broken
The xmas gears arent good for my heart
And im more addicted to that cause spins and claims are much more frequent, if also very competitive :p
While this was gone i ended up addicted to a completely different discord waifu gacha game :s
rv_mycardlist
<:madogay:528661966202339338>
melua dont distract her *too* much
actually is an option to see how many tokens we have on the table?
x2 tokens lets go
Or does a mod only include monetary powers?
So do you still have powers over the bots even though you dont have mod powers?
Well we should test it
<@!102691114762371072> is there a way to search for all of your kirikas or all of your finés or something
Should it say Prae token? Or is it supposed to be Prelati token?
Ok ill blow my money then
Any plans for alcha swimsuits? <a:eyesshaking:563824776766816262>
rats
Is the alcha swimsuits in too?
Oh
I need to wake up
Derp
Oh right
<@!102691114762371072> can kiri handle 72 rolls?
That looks nice
Ooh
Yes both that and yank laughs make a good combo
Thats the word
Commonwealth
Like AH
I meant to say
See you have british and American comedy behind you no?
Once i get a pc, im actually tempted to try and have more jackbox stuff
Just too funny
There was that and writing prompts too
I actually had headspace then :/
Iirc you once monatised winning in jackbox... gosh that was like months ago
Oh thats automatic huh
Oh is there also plans for more things to gain dess coin?
But? <:TsubasaPeek:623246193002151938>
<@!102691114762371072> would it be possible to see how many tokens we have while you implement the usage of it? Ive been curious as to how many dupes I’ve gotten
first time in a long time i rolled and got mainly new cards <:potatobless:530552695900340245>
rv_tokenHelp
rv_help
Ooh
Is there a way to use reactions to turn the pages of your list?
Also
<@!102691114762371072> is there a way to sort your card list to like “show me only my shirabe”?
so 20 pulls would mean 4 extra
every 5 pulls = 1 extra pull

Kiricoin *is* real money
Excuse me im pretty sure theres some European law which means you have to tell us gacha rates.
Wait is it even European?
No it was China...
Wait wasn’t it only if they cost money?

If you scroll up
How gay?

<@!127644949884698624> you got some good stuff with the Girls Und Panzer girls?
I dunno what Ver sees in you
Who would’ve thought a giant shaped letter R would miss a sneaky pun?
I saw it
woah really? Who woulfa thought entertainment is a poor educator?!
Walks away
Im set for porn thanks to Alice
A lot get education of sex through porn...
Sucks as sex
My man!
Meh
So it went swimmingly it seems?
If you dont mind me asking, how did your transition go Alice?
It would be not safe for work topics
Don’t mind me i have just realised
If you don’t mind me saying alice, i see this less as an nsfw-discussion chat but more topics that are a bit too serious for a casual chat in general chat
Yet i fell madly in love with her so whos the fool?
Stuff like “whats the point”
Ah one of them just falls to despair bc dyphoria
I think im a little scared bc i have 2 mates who are also trans (i aint told them) and they aren’t exactly going through happy times
What with school and all
Even if it turns out I am, i doubt I will have the time to continue caring this much about my body
<:GenjuurouThumbsUp:336657189475188740>
Well i have an appointment on Monday to talk to someone and see if im trans or not
Tank porn?
That system is installed in every tank
When a tank is incapacitated it pops out a white flag
And the rounds fired are regulated too
First of all the tanks are given EXTRA THICC armour
Well there’s safety measures
Who needs punching when you can drift a world war 2 era tank?

Welcome to GuP
Duce Anchovy
Anchovy
We should ise that to watch Kokoro connect!
You know how we have tjat doki doki anime club?
Hey i got an idea
Im sad Kokoro connect will never get s2 but its a great show with thought provoking stuff
One of which has andoraphobia
And theres 3 girls 2 boys
And they are quite random
Because the 5 people have body swaps
But the whole body and identity
Not the gender construct part
Didnt this SORTA come up in kokoro connect?
Humans are bloody facinating  things
I see!
From what I remember Gender Fluid is where your gender changes up. Im probably very wrong but that’s what you are here for to explain it!
I might not have experience with that but i can say proud of ya for coming out here
Go ahead!
You sure you think you can handle the emotional problems of a 17 year old most likely trans autistic teen?
❤
This stuffs actual philosophy
See this shit is more deep then my own problems
Maybe so huh
Life sure takes an interesting path
I love how an anime about gay girls fighting Eldritch abominations brought me here
Ok Hibiki
And i think ive made peace with the fact that i wont regret the choices i made, life is such that time spent doing so really isnt worth it
Yeah even I have sage advice from time to time!
The main thing i wana do is get away from this asian family
Thats... really insightful alice, thanks
Yeah i can see that
A referral to someone who isnt a GP
I have successfully taken the first step
Ahhh, Dereban
I’ve been meaning to rewatch it
So Alice would you do the doki doki anime club does Kokoro Connect?
Somewhere near London
For whatever reason...
Im always up for saying hi to anyone if yall pop by St Albans
And the french
Racists
Theres only two kinds of people i hate
rather an alive mate then a dead one tho
perhaps
i mean ive just dealt with a lot of talking down friends over text
true
you too?
Why would you look at that you have discord open!
How the hell do people manage that?
Its scary because I think I went the reverse of autism yesterday
Ever just scream internally “the fuck am i doing?!”
I was a bit off the mark
Ah
i am now
i have stolen yall and added it to my vocabulary
“And another thing!” They said, trying to make a point hours after the argument had passed.
So guys works if you’re both in the same mindset
I use guys as a group pronoun and have offended someone in that group because of that
All languages are shite
You have very serious discussions at 1am Rukia
On the plus side i have an appointment in april
also i feel kinda invalidated by the fact that i don't really feel much about my genitals... ive mostly felt apathy or just practical desires for that
i have come to a self conclusion that i may be very bouncy around with how i feel about my gender
this will be a fun article
Ooh boy ive been assigned to write about Gender Fluidity
If it turns out i am trans, i laugh a lot at man, man
Just got to call and make an appointment
On the plus side I got a response letter
Hell kinda evolutionary trait is having the human brain have confusion to the point of distress towards their gender?
Gah human brains are so goddam messy
One point im horny for the one I love and now i feel weird about doing stuff with them even though we already did stuff
I feel like my brain is constantly contracting itself
Goddam love and brain chemistry
My head is a tad messy rn
fingers crossed science is working the heck outta it
for now
what does Oorai do again, i cant remember
Im simplifying the process in my brain bc writing out they gonna help me out figure out my brain seemed a little clunky
I know that
Bc i feel like im bouncing back and forth between “eh” and “eeeeeeh”
I’m honestly thinking that im gender fluid at this point
Not gonna change that now
I aint cared in a long ass time
Not like i care
Again i smile that if it does turn out im trans, you used “man”
16th april is my date for “knowing a bit more”
Well ive got some of it off my chest
Ive been behaving a little erratic recently
You never realise that you feel like this till you analyse how you been behaving recently
But now I’m at a point where im forcing myself to relax and play games, because the alternative is just lying in bed listening to music all day
Thought this feeling would fade when my school holidays started
I’m not really sure
Gah, my head feels like a pressure gage which is close to blowing up
thats gonna be fun...
well tomorrow is my appointment
Hasn’t really been a cause that I know of
Physically and emotionally
Ive felt very... exhausted today
Thats gaymaths
2+2=4
Which also includes kanade into the mix
Meanwhile i believe in harem master basa
Chrisxbasa vs tsumaria?
No exceptions
Because all ships are lesbian ships
Queen can refer to the monarch or Freddy
I mean
*no wonder we voted leave*
With English we don’t assign gender to items. Europeans tho...
Dipstick is as offensive as you make it love
Kerrik is dipstick till he makes the post
I avoid it by calling everyone either comrade, mate, or boss
That makes me feel a whole lot better actually
Is that something you too faced, <@!127644949884698624> ?
Also if we getting nsfw here i do masturbate and that also leaves me conflicted, especially when i do get aroused
At one side I can’t deny that a lot of my fantasies are me turning into a girl and I find it really comforting looking at girls clothing. I once managed to wear some before I was even aware of what trans is and I felt really good about it. And I know it wasn’t something sexual either
But on the other hand i feel.. i dunno. Scared maybe? I think I’ve reached a point where I basically didn’t really care about myself as a person, but rather saw myself as a thing which exists. Its only recently that’s changing and that also includes accepting the feelings i have and had in the past
especially since my mind has been going pretty fritzy with thought and doubt and all that lovely balls of emotions which come from this
my life motto has been just roll with whatever comes your way, having to deal with something like this is a little scary
And im 17, and strongly doubt im the youngest here too
how old are you Joe?
how old are you zio?
after i said american she explained that the processes were different for each country. I told her i already understood that
unsure
nice! i shall spout that out if it ever comes up again
<@!127644949884698624> how old are you?
so for the future...
but ive got to do parts on my own too
yea
suitable that when my life gets a little more calm, my life goes "time to not be calm, we got shit to solve"
i imagine i am just *terrified* like mad about everything rn
i think if i asked real deep down into my heart, i would rather say girl then man
almost said yank as well....
caught off guard
"and do you know how old she is?"
and alice was trans
i basically told her that i told alice and yall
"have you spoken to anyone about this?"
also the session i had itself had some fun moments
so im being referred to a specialist place in london
ive mentally calmed down a bit
Well they’ve clearly shown how much throw think of you so shouldn’t be any more reason to do anything extra for them
Is the person myself and the person going to sleep also myself?

And technically kerrik has some too
I have a lot of keions
Yes
I was already corrupted
Lol, alice corrupting me
Alice could always ban me but thats the extent of any punishment I would get
I don’t even have a license yet rats
Oh lul
Wah?
Im not a yank, if i can fuck i can post lewds of anime girls
Co-optional podcast led me to food wars
He brought me into tabletop gaming
https://www.reddit.com/r/cynicalbritofficial/comments/8g4eoj/official_totalbiscuits_future/
Doesn’t make being not productive any less fun. I’m no stranger to endurance fights and I don’t plan on drowning soon
I know
Not much I can do except ride this wave
Well i was right. Feel pretty low rn
Hard when I feel like im swimming a violent river
But I have a bad feeling about the upcoming weeks
I applied for work and they might want me to start tomorrow
Struggled to get out of bed today and now im paranoid i might be bedridden for a bit
To further add to my blue mood is my cough is getting a little bit worse... fun
I wana ask ghost, what part of your personality do you feel needs to change?
what can i do to change
if not
do i want to live like this
asking yourself
and what you want to change
analysing what you do
If i am to give a serious answer
Superb!
Then she actually had a baby
The most recent one was 2 hours bc dooger was expecting
Mans fought it fucking hard tho
a few months now
yes
I think perhaps theres a bit of me that wants to go “embrace it!” But a bit of me is holding me and saying “don’t you want to remain in the happy place you were? Go back to that ignorance! You’ve seen the mental torment 2nd hand!”
And both of them hate eachother for eachothers actions
Theres two versions of me, when im aroused and when I’m not
Now I’m in a different mental turnoil
That was a few months ago
And I’m feeling good for the first time
I get out of a stage where my mental health was basically a hole in the ground, where I *may* have repressed memories because of these events
But right now i feel as if something thats been chipping away at my mind for a very long time is making ever so slight cracks
I know i am going to hopefully go to therapy of some kind
I literally cant do anything about it right now
What can i do about it?
But then i had an epiphany
I reassure myself that these feelings are true
Lot of severe doubting
I’ve basically been in mental turmoil for like a few hours now
I think I understand how my trans friends felt to an extent
Thanks a lot mate
See you in a bit
I’ll be there to set up the k-on watch but im gonna use this time and now to have a little bit of a breakdown
Thanks
<@!263983345669505025> if ur free can you make the fanart post?
Today
K-on
Actually
Good work
Progress is made with every death of the old generation
No shit?
A new president might actually make the soft power stronger than when trump entered office
But heres the thing
And how trump was damaging Americas power
I wrote an article about “Soft Power”
Denying the Iran nuclear deal?
But also very liberal
For this context, they are communist
Politically
The other one is the most left person i know
Two are trans themselves
Btw, I didn’t even know being trans was a possibility during October
That’s probably me
Yeah that
It turns out one of them thought i was trans since October and didn’t try to directly ask bc something about “eggs”
<@!127644949884698624> so i came out to my close friends...
Definitely feel a bit like that, my happy moments are bursts
thats mainly when i looked at all my past thoughts and behaviours and was like "i might want to be a girl"
but
lets say roughly the start of this year
If you can
Just bring that to work
Well i know what i shall buy next
Redbubble?
I was thinking Symphogear pendant
Have you considered wearing anime merch?
Also
Rukia is closer to me than Yori is
If it wasnt for the fact I don’t actually know how I would go to Scotland I think id come to where you are and give you a hug
Does she still think that?
Whats up mate
Wasn’t it May pushing to ban encryption?
Something came out saying that
Isnt it that we wont be able to own houses?
Which is horrific
The problem is in the housing market in the UK
Yori if they did that prices would jack up
Fandoms
Based on where we are
Every community has its cancerous section
It’s nothing i can include in my calculations, so its not worth considering
But I cannot dwell on what i cannot control
Perhaps without Balal I would’ve figured out i was trans earlier than I thought
We all cursed souls at heart
NP
Better to ask the way than to go astray
And you can’t worry about how she will react
She will listen
You need to gather that courage to be able to say your piece
Well ya boi struggles to form what he wants to say
You watch a Silent Voice?
Thats why i like compulsive voting
So i aint seen the vid, but i will say the main thing ive taken from life is that there will usually be a case by case basis for many things
I know this is an analogy but ifeel you would just pull both levers
Imo
There is many layers and interpretations
This is America is sort of like fine art
How common is transgenderism?
Saki we should hug
More public hugging
I mean if they id as a girl they a girl
I misunderstood the phrase completely then
Oh
Well I would think most people think others are like them until told otherwise most of the time anyway
Ah
Hetro... that mean the straight peeps are the norm thingy?
He yelled at the mod to stfu bc ur annoying before blocking them
Then the mod removed it and called them out for their constant reminder that they aren’t trying to get banned
They posted an extremely lewd pic on rhe general chat
So they were muted for an hour
Irs kicking back off
Oooooh
Tryhard
Wait bwen?
Right ima sleep, wake up and be cripplingly depressed like i have been for a few days! Wish me luck on my dreams!
That style
Edgelord
Afterward they really were testing people’s patience
In anycase I think you would’ve banned then even if you ignored the whole trap thing
And i swear theres like a sorta popular song about a Transylvania transvestite r something like that
Anything prior to the 90d is old fashioned to me lul
Ah tragically they have settled down but for a while he was testing the patience of people around him
Not been involved other than explaining to him what transsexual and transgender are bc the bloke thought they were interchangeable
Btw ive just been watching this
I mean i would be fine if they used it for an anime character, s good chunk of peeps do that anyway. The sod used it ti describe a cross dresser
First
This shits good
I need popcorn
The fire more or less started with the T word and their horrible usage of it
But a fire just happened in the konosuba discord and im waiting on this troll figure tobget banned
I want to sleep
Like for example
And the other who’s depressed about having those instincts
One who just wants to give in to instincts
I def feel like theres two sides of me
Well I’m like mega attracted to a trans friend, and my tempo and attraction has been fucking with my head
Right
Were they by chance trans girls?
During this stage i am at, did tou by chance have any romantic attachments?
Oh alice
Gender reassignment surgery
My year group has been a pretty large amount of “I don’t care what you sre, if u a cunt u a cunt”
But mainly they just dislike the person from what ive gathered
The only problem i could see is that there was someone who was “trans” but in reality was just garnering attention and thus damaged that reputation
Most of these people are accepting anyway
What you think of my plan alice tho
Bye
I’m sleeping now I should a slept like 2 hours ago
Make things a whole lot simpler
Turn into ones and zeroes
Soon we shall reach the state where being human wont matter
I don’t think I would necessarily care about being called pronouns, I think i have such dis attachment from names that i cant answer what i wana be called till i gain that attachment back
Use whatever you wish
I’m not sure
I dunno
For me...
Alice is female
But they have fun drama
These people I probably won’t stay in contact with after a levels
Ye
People i sorta know
You aren’t my sorta friends
No you are my friends
Violently confronting this
What might be good is coming out to my sorta friends
I think
What level have i trancended where i am basically sure im trans but im still an egg
Unlikely
I don’t know anymore
Or am i in denial
Wait
See —> me rn
The feminist who gave me the bright idea of sexuality as a spectrum inadvertently turned my cogs into thinking gender was also a spectrum
Good night
Force me into this
We shoukd do this more
Ahg its fsr too late
At the very least i can come out before her
I didn’t have thoughts bout it till like February
See my girlfriend guessed i was trans in October time
So basically like me?
Are you trans female?
Miku night i ask about you?
Why must i do this noe
Holy shit its 2 am
I think i can cross off masturbation
Well i have a mental checklist of doubts
I’m not sure if my brain is restistjnf bc its scared or because im tired
Using your dick to masturbate doesn’t mean you aren’t trans you dipstick
Ok i gotta shout this at myself
Hmm
But i still masturbate tho
Thanks alice
This is what i used to basically get to the mental point i am at now in terms of sm i trans ir not
I then used her for science by doing that again to confirm my hypothesis
Well look, she sucked my dick snd that caused immense depressive pain after we finished
I have done some of the dirty things
And I forgot completely
You did
I mean i want to do *dirty* things with her but im not some christian who wants repentance for thoughts
I don’t think its envy i am feeling
I think
With
I was the one who asked, and the one who was excited at the time
I declined, and I didn’t really have much reason to
Infact i had an opportunity to go to her house today for pretty much most of the day today
I just don’t know
I get to a point where im literally in her bed kissing and then my brain just goes “get the fuck out of here right now” and I’m down
Thats not the first time either
Like an hour or two after
Yeah I didn’t even know i was feeling super down until she asked me about it
She confessed to me
Well she was certainly returning the kisses
But afterwards i felt like super down
Recently me and her had a solid hour alone in a classroom
I think after my first two periods I’m gonna go home and say something along the lines of “my coughs getting a bit too much for me”
I think once I used anger of my situation to throw myself into OSu
It’s frustrating
I want to Yui
Yes
Might be both
Although I think i can just tag that as high functioning autism at this point
And I became both very self conscious and reckless at the same time
People are on edge
The atmosphere has changed
Something i feel happened on Tuesday. Something invisible
School is at a weird spot for me rn
The next best thing
What im feeling is what i think what the depressed mind tries to aim for if it cant make you suicidal
I had a sort of picture in my head but thinking about it that would be more suitable to suicidal thoughts
As in just done
Feel... tired
Password is “miku”
Should be locked
Ibu2009
Search for my name
That means you are the same level as me
Thats good
How many stars is hard again?
Well want to do some tag team stuff?
What a coincidence im jumping into OSU rn
Yori you doing anything?
Right then
The only thing I can get myself to do is watch YouTube videos
Is there such a thing as being too depressed to be depressed
Thats gonna be good for so many people tho
I don’t particularly want children so cool
I don’t intend to return
I had my bout with suicidal thoughts
Coughing is a megaphor for suicide?
It’s better now but im still coughing
A week ago i was waking up coughing hard and feeling the pain of coughing hard
Like choking bad coughs
I’ve had a cough for a few weeks now, on meds but it can still seem pretty bad
The waiting time would be around 14 months and the place only does people under 18
So I gotta make a referral to an adult service
Got a letter back about the referral
So in 17 rn
Well then
Humans are more patient than we let on
<:ShirabePout:336656831978012712> intensifies
For wisdom isn’t gained without failure
The wisest people are always hypocrites
So because everthing is a lie, i have no limits
Psychologically speaking, that was my “true” self
If I did that I would be under tables humming loudly
Thats bad advice for me tho lul
Good or bad
Which means you don’t take any criticism
Which can warp the masks you wear
A mixture of Persona, music and being emotional made me just think of this
I can make assumptions to how people see me
But the third mask i know nothing about
The mask i show to my mother and close friends is my “real” mask
However
I would tell my distant family that im not trans
Ill use a real example
And the mask which everyone sees
The mask we don’t show to others
The one we show to others
We all have three masks
But thinking about it
They say people can be two faced
I feel as if you told me you joined the start of this year i would believe you
When did you join Yori?
Infact it seems to be going
Its not choking me now
I am on meds
I hve
So im pretty out of sync in terms of singing
Like a monthish
My outlets been silenced for a while bc of my cough
I think it comes from Autism
Or whatever the fuck this weird thing i can do is
Tonight is the night to hyper focus
But alas, the night is not for singing
Im pretty sure people are lying to me when they say im a good singer
The musicians fury manifest through the cry of vocals, the scream of strings. A frustration burned as the hearts anguish beats a violent drumming to the mind bleeding
I can just mentally pump all of these emotions with music
I’m glad im a Music fan
Urhg, thinking about it i feel my IRL connections are either stagnating or regressing
The teacher in charge
*editor*
Well
The editor for my news paper
Im seeing too much of “shutting down and lashing out” or as i prefer to call it ostrich in sand while screaming
I can’t say that some of these “the world looks a bit bleaker” comes out of nowhere though
I think its a mix of both.
The general mood of the world has dipped
And that my mood tanking has degraded my mood reading ability, making the world seem more drab
Although its having the unfortunate effect of effecting this depressive mood
The autistic part of me is screaming bloody mary at this, but that bits always wrong
Lot of change
If this place was an anime, we going through a new arc
So two things then
thats probably why my trousers keep falling dow
oh shit
I self insert my own gods
Agnotism seems correct
Likr my cousins sisters dog walkers grandchildren heard this
The verse about 72 virgins was absurdly far away from ya bou
For example
The problem with religious books is that some sources aren’t exactly the most reliable. In the Qu’ran I believe each verse if you will has a validity based on how close the writer was to Mohamed
where being trans is much *much* more open
in a society
this is a debate really our children should have, for they will be able to hopefully live
or it falls out of service for eternity
all words eventually become absorbed into humanities lexicon
or two
give it a generation
blitzkrieg
i mean
just be gender neutral in all languages
or the word they
we gotta go light spectrum
nah
it is both rooted to eachother
Language and society are interchangable
ill glass you yori
people are cunts
rukia why use universal language, when we have the word "thick"
this was when i went to another town
but i live in a large asian population
i have seen a bit of racism
wasnt it that rates of depression are going up, but what that really means is more people are speaking out that they are depressed?
i mean, we are starting to actually care about ourselves in a way
society is changing to accommodate that
each person is different
well i have had slurs used against me, but the only time i personally found them offensive was when they were directed at me out of malice. However i dont speak for the entirety of Bangladeshi-British people in England
haggis drinking nessie
i think he might be white
his face is his ava
i mean
not rukia
i was thinking of Yori
i believe we call that privilege, the fact that being white kinda removes a fuckload of slurs
hick
we have slurs for white people no
in the same vein that i would use Yank
when i use Jap, i imagine it as in the context of a british grenadeer
that is also inherantly racist
you know how i hate the french and want to retake the colonies?
dont get me started
im tired

europe has no reason to give a shit about us when we leave
america...
america is
the japs said they wont trade with us
forget any economical damage
brexit is probably gonna cost us 52 bil on the *divorce*
£350 mil to the NHS anyone?
im talking about the liars at the top
i dont have a strong enough word alice for these absolute tossers
lying two faced shitheads
cuntsticks
fuckheads
wankers
fueled by many things
we were just racist to eachother
kids are cunts anyway
see, my extended family
some muslims are shit bc they are shit people rather than they are muslim
I understand mate
I may change back
I’ll experiment with this for now
but its my nicnkame because its a shortening of my real name, ibrahim
ibu is a middle name of mine
i mean
coming up with a new name is hard
perhaps a detatchment from this name i have used for so long might help in the long run
however
techniques you can apply on others could never be used on your own, especially if you are aware of them
the problem lies when you are too smart for its own good
the human brain is thickle and easy to manipulate
wait now
this
well im trying something new
this is revenge for when i attacked someone for touching my food without permission
gah, high functioning autism why
im more scared of what i want out of it
oh my mates wouldnt care at all
probably why its taken me this long to muster that courage to talk to the tier 2
a little part of me i think is scared to move forwar
tell that to my brain
*i know*
i think honestly im still in doubt
i myself didnt realise it was a posibility until like start of this year ish
i believe i mentioned that one of them knew i was trans in october time
my tier one friends include 2 trans people and another bloke
no
still aint come out to my 2nd tier friends... should really do that
you seem well versed in this subject
Latooni, might i ask more about you?
i wont be allegible for a child trans clinic, and ima have to seek an adult one
but since im 17 and it will take quite a few months for a referal
oh yeah dunno if i said
do i live in the moment or do i live in the eternal pain if that makes sense
where my internal struggle of arousal and depression will be large
if i dont win, im going to my gfs
i have a feeling if i win they expect me to stay the entire day
tomorrow i learn if i won the election
i am emotionally petered out
i have always regarded jap as the same as brit or yank
wow
some of these brexiteers probably voted for her too lul
didnt thatcher close the mines down
Empire <:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
a lot of countries dont
in anycase, they dont wana deal with our shit
Alice is my senior in more ways than one, i shall be taking many a good advice from you about life
My sex life isn’t that traumatising right?
Pair*
The best I can do is this secret pain of girls underwear and pink socks
Asian family
Oh I wouldn’t  be able to do that
Her panties are really tight and they are only “helping”
I said at the start lul
Found a new kink
I found a subreddit called NSFWTiedtogether
I want so bad
And now im wearing her panties
Hell seeing my girl in my *coat* makes me all kinds of doki doki
Just go full on and get a collar which ties to another collar
I don’t dedicate your love life alice
lul
That way you can’t separate
Put yourself in Glitchs shirt
Idea alice
Carefully
2 years
Just give me like
Ill be down for sharing the love
And wrap their legs around you bc you started flicking their sensitive nipples
But the daki dont kiss back
But i cant lie on top of my 2d gf kissing her till we both have to stop because we are dehydrated
my gf is 3d tho
But my gf isnt with me
But now I’m in a state of perpetual horniness so I didn’t win
Well first time I’ve done that and not orgasmed, and now my brain isn’t actually in “everything is hell” mode
I think using my mouth to pleasure my gf bc her nipples are getting sensitive counts as sex
Well time for some super inappropriate serious discussion time
Want to buy all the clothes
I want to be independent sooner
The text begins to blur and fade
What direction we are going
No real way of knowing
Alice is a dirty criminal
Nice
I have a very good falsetto apparently
Maybe ive accidentally voice trained myself
Wait shit
I don’t think i would change my voice, i love singing far too much
I think i have inherited the whole sex = sleepy stuff from alice
I am absurdly tired right now
Trans girl?
Not much leeway for trans people to really come out tbh there, from what i gathered trans people arent a big fan of voices
The other server I’m mainly active in is a singing one
The server owner is trans
For starters
Well
I think a little bit on the inside, i was like “if i got a gear i could be a singing girl”
Shame she was such a shite teacher
Infact one of my many former music teachers was a trans woman
Mainly my age
Theres a whole lotta trans people in the area im in iirc
Even if you don’t remember this convo, you can look back at it
Probably a bit of A and B alice
One memory that stands out was maybe a few years ago where he threatened to hit me and i stood my ground
My dad was almost certainly abusive to me in some form
And she is good *now*, but there was a time where theres a gaping hole and i know thats bc ive reprssed it
But overall it was a lot of my mother
My brothers probably latched on to me
I didn’t exactly have a father figure growing up
Thinking about it
You would unconsciously recoil from him iirc
Some things can’t be forgotten sadly
I don’t have headphones on me
Sadly my father is still crawling around so i get to see his mug sometimes
Ah that must be great
I can guess but people can be liars
and i have no idea what i really lost
A lot of mine is repression
I don’t remember jack prior to year 9
Blanks in their memory club woo
Jeez
Go sleep
Yori how the hell are you awake?
The only thing chemistry has taught me is that if you drink or use drugs drink water bc you dehydrate
Thats what the water is for
Any other dish costs real moni
Bc i work there
Yea but i got the katsu for free
Chicken Katsu curry is ok, shame its a curry but what can ya do
Its not bad actually
I work at a sushi bar place
I have work
I do genuinely need to sleep
Look ima actually go now
Ur high
Thanks Alice
Im getting cookie dough after my shift
*cookie dough*
I am firm in my belief that if it were not for my asian family basically having rice as a staple for dinner, i would weigh like a fuckton more
Rice is both filling and low carbs
With pizza the killer is the breading
Depends what you get
They aint west asians but they will do
They do alrighr rice stuff
Any chinese places nearby then?
Hand eat that plate
Mix that shit in
Get a fried egg
Cook some rice up
Egg rice
Protein
Rice?
I have mixed feelings on whether i want them to go or not
Side note before i go, i dont think the taste of my gfs nips are going away anytime soon
I shall bid you adieu, for the night is deep and my brain yearns for rest
She was just munchin away
Like i was like “np girl do your thing
And i *understood*
She blanked me completely
I saw her recently
My half sister is a lower functioning autistic person
Humans are far too weird
The ultimate deduction made by any autistic person
Humans are weird
Fair
I see
What show is that then?
If that’s true you look mega cute girl
I don’t
I would love to wear leggings but I’m in the wrong household
The woman’s section on amazon has been helpful to say the least
At least I got a ton of cute socks
And my shirt collection leaves something to be desired
Having 2 pairs of indoor trousers, one which is too loose around rhe waste and the other shows off my hairy legs isnt great
When im also trying to save cash to buy clothes
I need to make some time (and money) for it
As nice as hair being ripped off is
Leg and arm waxing seems nice
Even then there was a lot of hair
Thats why i only shaved the large amount of hair above my genitals
Are you worried about cutting your genitals by chance?
Operation?
“Urgh too much effort”
As in mendoksai
Not psychical pain
I wana shave my genital hair, but its a pain
How old are you?
“Oh, why is it you strongly dislike your body hair, and hate looking at the mirror”
“Why is it that your escapist fantasy in your mind is basically an ideal and desired version of you, where you are female”
Tis only recently where things have sorta calmed down that i am able to look at my heart
Like my life was stable enough to accept trans in the first place
Maybe i did know subconsciously but I rejected it
I never really imagined myself saying I wasn’t trans if that makes sense
Well if I can’t lie i would speak the truth from the heart
One reoccurring thought was an idea of forced honesty to figure out if i was trans or not
In hindsight it was pretty obvious
Perks and flaws
Is that necessary good though?
I suppose I’ve gotten better at accepting i am trans
I don’t even know what to say to myself
Really I should vent this stuff to a therapist. No dis to yall but I don’t feel its a “discord vent” topic that comes up
Pretty perverse and pretty cowardly:/
I’m pretty perverse, and I dunno if that’s good or bad
Ive come to a slightly jarring.. epiphany if you would
Horray for being simultaneously tired, aroused and depressed at the same time
I mean mentally
Are you ok
Now double dikki hotdogging miku...
Yeah futa with a dude and girl isnt for me
Its a nice educational experience
Rambling is life
Also don’t worry bout it
See I thought i was put off with futa but as it turns out im ok with some types
<:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
They were just outplayed
That sounds a little hilarious
3:40
But its ::40
I would ask now
My moms told me before but I’ve not remembered it
I’ve been meaning to muster the courage to ask my mom if she knows what I would have been called had i been born female
Im not sure
I’ve never cared but I might want to care
Funny i wasnt at all fussed about others and what they would prefer being called, yet i am conflicted myself on what i want to be called
Shes always gonna be a girl in my eyes, thats all i care bout anyway
Be more accurate to call her a trans girl rn tbh
Well she wouldn’t have given it to me if she wasn’t
Going deep here
Using serious discussion to ts fullest
Its true im getting mega excited wearing my gfs underwear with her permission. But it isn’t wrong that i am
Well this was sudden and yet also helpful in a way too
The truth can be wrong
Like a child who’s too honest
The male reproductive system
Hell even now I dream about doing anal with her, even though I know that would make me uncomfortable
And when she’s not here i miss her a lot
I used to doubt I was trans because i was mega excited around her
As love tends to do
It messes a bit with your emotions
My gf
I love her, dunno where it began or what exactly I love about her but im basically slutty for her in a way
Love is complicated
Right well I’m gonna try to sleep but I imagine my perversion shall keep me awake
I immediately hate the thumbnail...
R has the missing letter
Headpat
Good work kerik
You got dis, daijobu
It flows better for me because im British
Cooking skills? Seems like a really bizarre thing to “””joke””” about
Well either they get their heads out of their arses or they stick tk their ignorant ways. At least for the more irl people
People that are that toxic don’t deserve to be in your life
Good
How close friends are you to these people
i feel like i dont vent enough but in reality i vent probably quite a bit
ive always been a huge advocate of venting
All I’m really doing is venting my frustration about things i cant do anything about
Time is a bastard of a mistress though
Time is a bastard of a mistress though
That is my plan
And there are probably those that would support me
Head down, false smiles
I know how to play the game
Family is a weird subject
I might have to abandon my plans on going to Exceter bc its close to a distant family house tbh
But i need to go to one far away from home
I might get my chance when i go to uni
Yeah its a hard to advise situation
What comes of it?
And even if i fully know i am trans
Just like i am not sure i am trans *still*
Now im not sure
And i was fine with that when i made the deal
And my mom, while she knows, doesnt want me to rush things till after therapy
Asian family
And dressing more feminine might as well be coming out
To everyone
I was talking about rhe absolute shitshow it would be if i came out now
Sadly what makes me happy short term and what makes me happy long term are different
Eh, whats another year of repression anywah
*yamerooooo*
Im being attacked by memes help

My asian nan who makes a fuckton of rice dishes uses a rice cooker
i actually hate showers tbh but ill live
hate baths
i always shower
yeah taking a bath and just... *sitting* would be nice
I wouldn’t know unless you said
Im not a yank
Do you have to stay in comtact with your dad?
Me too love
You go girl
I hope you go with it too
That’s pretty suitable
Not having the motivation to do stuff isn’t
I mean autism is fine
Not helped that autism makes me really prone to overload
Its fuel to the fire
Surprisingly I don’t think my mental plight comes from being trans, unless depression comes from that
I think im done
If i was richer I would be eating this off
I’m pushing myself to do the things I love bc my will is being sapped
It’s frustrating
And not sleep tired
I think im tired
Perhaps but i have no idea what
And today i was struggling to focus in class
I mean ive been feeling pretty damm empty these past few days
I dunno whether to feel elated or depressed that the only thing stopping me from having a severe breakdown today was music
i think not knowing might be ok as long as they get it when you explain
but shes accepting at least
feel like there might be some trouble with me mom
Thats the garbage
I wana say good luck but from what ive heard sleep paralysis sucks
Last time i play drawful late
Bc in my dream i wanted to open my eyes to see something in my dream
At like 5
I woke up 2 hours aho
You might find this interesting then
And I can flex what little knowledge i remember
I’m not gonna study it further but music is fun
I did music gcse and while I wasn’t good at it I dont regret taking it
CS
And I kinda hate it now
Im not pursuing it
And thats helped quite a bit
But ive had to think that people think just as i do
And I thought about how I would argue with them
Like I’ve realised ive thought that people who have really dumb opposing views such as gun control and such are very one dimentional
Mine included
The mind is fascinating to pick apart
I do kinda regret picking cs over psychology
Fighting for a long time
Perhaps that reflects how i see my mind
My fantasy involves a woman who does a lot of fighting
Hmm. I’ve just realised something
I get ya
I still find it a little funny that the minute my life starts settling is when it starts up again
Well good thing I’ve spent a short time of my life actually sorta good
Which is fine i guess
Best i can do now is moan
And im quite limited to what i can do. Realisation and accepting i am trans also comes with realising that ive got a while to get to therapy and asian families are not the kinda thing i want to gather attention from
Im accepting i have an issue
I’m not addressing the core issue
Even if im valid
But its gonna take a while to get help
Browsed egg_irl and I’m more certain im trans
The more I awaken the more pronounced my grievances are
I’m feeling a little shit rn in terms of gender
Ill do that but probably another day
Trippy is camping so ive mentally crossed them off already
But some amount of communication would be appreciated. Yori and saki are fine but I remember more people interested
I get that
Im seriously contemplating dropping tge k-on watch
The k-on no show hurts more than I thought
I had one when i was moderately young
Egc or whatever its called?
Have you ever been involved in a sleep test thingy?
:hug:
What happened
Errrr
I think the best i can do is just say these are the things i struggle with a lot
I’m always not gonna be 100% what is autism and what is just something else
Im not sitting under a desk humming loudly, but i am feeling a little bad
Yea so short story is im tapped...
Bc i wanted to know what sort of things mentioning im autistic would entail
I then followed that up
High functioning at that
I also mentioned I was autistic
Apart from mentioning in that i was trans
Or started it
Today we did out UCAS stuff
I have quite a few choices in mind
Picking out my future in terms of Uni is a little overwhelming it seems
I was stress overwhelmed in my GCSE’s, but this feels different
If it makes sense, autistic overwhelmed
This feeling of being overwhelmed
Well im feeling something I haven’t felt in a long time now
Hi
what is cheesecake factory?
That sounds good
how are you feeling right now?
This is why I recruited you for ping for pics!
u are smart
That might be smarter
Up the count to 2 <:GarieWink:336657101273169921>
See thats what the (f) is for
Im a trans girl
Only got asked bout it once in Valk
I did (f) to get people to get that I prefer being referred to as female
Well doing (f) has been somewhat successful
I probably wont use that bc my tags still ibu
Aah i see
Is that the MtF symbol then?
Whats the trans icon?
When i get tired I get very imperialistic
**what you say scot?**
^_^
Hadrians wall that is
The wall just got 10 feet higher
Only 2 people make what i would say “goofs”
People are getting it faster it seems
The whole using the female gender sign in my name
<@!263983345669505025> you are a massive genius
you in the k-on watch?
and awake as from a pleasant dream
go bed Yori
is ok
Amazon is very local
ooo
was it you that mentioned you wouldn't be here for tomorrow k-on saki? or was that pats?
in america
for cake stuff
is that like a branded shop
I wana grow my hair out but im under pressure to trim it at the minimum
Cause my usual nickname is a little misleading
It isn’t for me
I did it bc it started to hurt a little with male pronouns with people who sorta knew
Up to you girl
Probably wont change either
Gnite
Im gonna go and sleep
Man cant wait till therapy starts for me
Don’t force yourself
Autistic coloured kid
Woulda hated me
It got repressed alongside a whole buncha shit
I wouldnt know
Mine wasnt as shitshowy as to have racial discrimination (waaay too many asians for that) but outside school life was apparently fun!
Which stem from frilly panties
Late night rants are somewhat productive it seems
I feel like ive uncovered some repressed thoughts
The parents prepare to fling shit
They tell their parents
My main reason for not coming out to my sorta close friends in school bc it would probably eventually reach the conservative beaten asian kids in my year
It would be hard to not bump into an asian in this town
Sorta
Even though he had basically fucked off to another country after the divorce and came back with a wife
And thought that my dad should be the one to take care of us
Said percentage stirred shit in my family because i wasn’t acting muslim enough apparently
Like 80% of the asians in this area
Shes nice but she is stubborn in her mindset
Thats a bleak thought
Its a little depressing that if I want to be more open in my house i would have to wait for my nan to die
Good god fuckin asians...
Even more so cause asians
Hmm, if I ever have a death wish I could come out to my dad
Its strange having something be close AND really far away
I felt giddy bc I thought about frilly underwear, then reality smacked me with waiting a year or 2
I have to get their first
I will most likely have to stay in the closet until I get to uni
I’ve gotta take things at small steps, but i wana dream too
Im bouncing between hopefulness and hopelessness at the same time
^_^
Then i was corrupted
When I joined the server I wasn’t at all thinking I could be trans
Time moves fast...
Means ive done well to be a part of this place
Im happy you think ive been here longer than you thought
Wow
You actually never told me the incident you just said you had kicked someone
I wasn’t told it was at valk
Same day i got this phone pretty much
I joined like 5 days before last year ended
That was before my time
You were in Discord in your Heart bc you had briefly held mod power to kick someone
Yea
Been here longer than me
Wfc
Whose?
Uniiii
I have a feelings that just being poor tho
I’ve never really had a room just for me...
Emphasis on *when you’re ready*
Such as a part of her was in basa and bikki, perhaps a part of her is in you too
Thats cool
Im at work so i cant be depressed 🤷‍♀️
Some believe otherwise
We had Rukia
Well
Maybe less
My collection was like 1,250 ish
*remember a time before both ping for pics and daily fanart posts?*
A month ir two ago yori
Either i misread or you been her since july last year
What month is 7?
As in nov 17?
When did you join?
Wfc you been here a loooong ass time
Victoria too
See i know remember kerrik came after me
Its joke
We have more trans girls?
🤔
If we being serious not all peeps are trans
Het people masturbate
Think about it
Im not gonna be able to het therapy till like a year let alone HRT
I like how we have trans people at different stages too
Death right?
🤔
Death > cancer because errrr
I just did what wfc did
Fuck
<:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
Alice has built a trans girl harem
I feel like I would
It’s something i have to think about
I’m not actually sure what in would want to be called in the future....
Bc ive kept it as is for now
Was recently asked about my name by my trans friend
this place has grown a metric shit ton in like 6 months
Need to eat subway
No more discord and walk
Man cant wait to get home and talk more!
Its been lingering since yesterday
So the reason I wasn’t able to do k-on today is because my mental tempo has been derailed massively by... frilly panties
<:Germain:421434126856486912> anons
I need to talk to them about my cough and also about the whole autism thing
I can’t wait to see my gp again
Because i would need that extra support
Im probably gonna be getting extra money (that i will need) for disability in uni
Especially with new things
Face to face im timid AF
As much as i ooze confidence online
she did tell me when i came out that she knew it would be absolutely detrimental if she shunned me because i came out
i kinda needed to talk to her so i could get help
it seems so
the only person who knows the truth is my mom
lying?
Ive spent my life lying to my family even before i realised i was trans
Hopefully full 4
Naturally im picking one thats far away
Bc im picking out unis rn
I feel scared thinking i have to plan 4 years of my life
Its still a daunting task
I get that
My 4 years of uni will probably be the year I transition the most
Cutting away from my family will be much harder than i think
Ive had a little bit of a daunting thought
flower in weeb
Her name is bomb to me
I wouldn’t have thought it otherwise
Well you just reminded me Hana is D.Vas real name
I actually asked my mom what she would have called me if i was a girl, but she had no idea
Well this place better be ready to hold the megabytes of depressed rants in the future
Maybe it did a number on my mental endurance? But even still
Work was mega quiet
I did get home from work and basically lie in bed for 3 hours without changing
The start of i imagine many cases of my mind just being depressed....
?
Its something i desire and yet is far away
Daijobu
Goddam yanks
Yep
We having a fun Politics discussion?
And mix that with dysphoria
One mental stereotype of trans people i had was a girl who was interested in other girls but wanted to be male in that relation
Queer was “not fussy” correct? That far too simple of description?
I dont want to suggest anything by saying this, but i felt like this for quite a while
If you chase two rabbits, you’ll lose them both
The joke has flown over me... sorry
I *have* a girl dick
?
I can tell bc i sometimes have strong cravings for dick like a fuckin girl from hentai
Im bi
Is ok saki
Ill assume you
Is ok i read it wrong
In serious discussion <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
I may have met an unproportional amount of trans people in my life but I typically don’t assume someones shit unless they say, till then i dont care
How on earth does that work?
Should i out myself to my school friends by wearing a trans pride shirt?
Liking the colour pink/wanting to support an entire group of people is cool
Ofc you’re allowed
Bruh
The NHS has taken such a brutal beating that it might not be able to recover
The government is incompetent and also corrupt at the same time
So 10000% worse
Anarch capitalist
Yeah
Without any deal
Where in the span of a day, EU law suddenly no longer applies
Trump may be scary, but we have a deadline for when our country could actually nose dive off a cliff
Its like democrats and republicans both agreeing abortion is bad
It doesn’t look good when the opposition and the governing party both shared the same stance on brexit
Basically
Just had to hide it
Hes always been *for* brexit
No
I support him because hes not theresa may
Corbyn is pro brexit alyx
Trans exclusionary radical feminists
Democrats in your country is our “tory scum” right wing party
My beliefs and situation is quite different to you yanks
Im a brit
It just so happens that book had little on trans stuff
Well this feminist friend isnt a TERF
Im just centre left
Said feminist friend is also an anarcho communist
Ah
Ancom?
Hey ghost i feel tje same and im trans myself!
Didnt have much on Trans jargon
My openly feminist friend had a dictionary for feminist words
Ah, so something im gonna have to be doing for like a year
Stealth?
I swear you came out after seeing trans discussion here?
Sure...?
Here at least
But what specifically caused everyone to come out?
I love looking at how things start
Shes Brazillian iirc
<@!183785454447886346>
I’ve learned a lot
Tiny Miku too
Teacher
However you all do share one word
Vi is a comrade
Alyx is too... new for me to say anything
Alice is boss to me
Gottem
*mum*
I hate kids
To each your own
Huh...
To sway you to believe in our own ideals
Thats what leaders are for
Not everyone has to be a politician
Nah im imperialistic for british memes
Me
Duh
If everything is the british empire then nothing acts as a boarder
There are no borders on the british empire
I say british colonies
You say america
**empire**
But im interested in one thing
Sorry alyx
If i run for PM support me plz thanks
Im going into politics
My only concern is if the NHS will survive
I wouldn’t be able to afford private
Its fine, i knew what i had signed up for when I went through the NHS
Alyx im waiting a year for *therapy*
***boris johnson***
I mean alice IS the owner
Being warm is good
Im crying rn bc i feel... warm
<@!175163984197058560> thanks for inviting me
*look how far we’ve come*
Goof luck
Daijobu
Its 10;30 pm here
Yeesh
What time is it for you yanks
Im blind
Alyx is from Savannah?
Saki why
Wait so we are shooting up Alyx’s home?
I cant take a screenshot long
Oh shit he finished
Some of the people in it ar
The thing is the server isnt *bad*
Thats what started this
And 2.
1. Some people don’t share the same opinion
Poor DL
Might i add
Have fun!
Take your time sweetheart
Jesus its been 15 minutes
Im loaded with bias and shitposting desire
I would ask .o0 if you actually wana know whats going on
Its gonna be something along tje lines of “you are just getting offended”
I wouldn’t be suprised lol
Im excited to see what ~~bile~~ comes out
Xaxas has been typing for about 5 mins now
Maybe you should join, read the drama and leave <:Ver:336656981144109066>
Its the members
Size isnt even the problem here
Yea...
Don’t bother?
Fun
That can be also read as read the serious discussion on valk
<@!127644949884698624> i can see why you made your own server
Probably why they havent joined here <:GarieWink:336657101273169921>
By the three main people i will just mentally consider the transphobes
The facepalm count has gone to three
Lat explained it better
Apparently I *might* face some of that in terms of getting hormones
I see
I mean what is gate keeping
Sorry
So gate keeping then?
Only myself tho
Tbf i used to be that *to myself*
The sit in the other discord summed up
Truscum?
Its a really weird feeling
For me i know its shitty and toxic but i cant pin down why alice
Fair
And when you have goofed you have been really good about it
The decency to even step back and say i goofed is rare
Btw wfc, this is why i would never say you are an arsehole
*clearly*
You see its fine bc i have a dick and am not on hormones
Should i... copy the wall of text here?
And i agree with what you say Lat
Fair
One paragraph takes up my phone screen
Saki, did you just leave valk?
having a lazy day is why my days been shite
oh yeah my days been absolutely shite
FIREWORKS ARE FUN WOO
Although moot point now
<@!127644949884698624> i have suddenly been reminded that I actually talked to Newtype one on one just after being called an sjw
A good example is yametetomete
There are people who are both part of here and valk
The thing is when you leave it announces it
If you can recognise that its out of line then you can see why i came over here
Naturally
Yes
Well first time i blocked someone
Im happy for you
Horray!
I have school now and I burned my data playing hearthstone so I shall be back in like... 6 hours ish
Word for word
By the way that is the entire quote
Which part
Perhaps you missed “shut up sjw” as the first reply to me talking
Im fine for arguing people but im not gonna argue for someone whos basically dismissed everything i will say in the future because of my views on a completely different topic
The reason i said i was done because when i tried to join in he told me to shut up
Its too hot here
At the moment i feel like shit not wanting to fuck
*why i blocked someone in a nutshell*
This was a fun read: https://effectiviology.com/ad-hominem-fallacy/
I like knowing you pats
Rude
Albeit its fanta
I am right now
Which they arent
Unless the people in power are ready to surrender the world to damnation
Because we arent gonna press the button
Not really
Not peace
Why do you think i said peacekeeping
Peacekeeping
I cant fire a gun
I would rather debates
I like optimistic nihilism
Nihilism then
And i would be against it even if I disagreed witj nazis
And it breeds opposition
And also this thought process thing is dependent on who enforces it
I mean this would have to be a case by case thing, because i can think of different arguments where two different and valid opinions exist
As a kid, i had some pretty dumb thoughts tho
Send a funny message
Amd desires
It personifies my mood
Arigato
In my school we were super diverse, so instead of being cunts to eachother because of race, we found very mundane things to be cunts to eachotjer about
See i feel better already... fucking LLENN
And also MHA
Im just gonna force myself to watch ggo and sleep
I think its a case of just a lot of things have built up
And also so much more
I... dunno. It’s just a little overwhelming
Well i feel a little better
Mentally i feel drained
Ive been feeling... sick and not just physically
In other servers i stop engaging in a current debate of serious discussion because it got out of hand. This is the first time i stopped engaging because i was no where near smart enough for the topic
But enough to matter
Well not 100%
Would band humans together
I think aliens in general
Honestly forget alien attack
Peacekeeping makes money
For other countries
Peace keepingf
Like i said
Now we fight with cash
In that regards we have major peace in our time
And ive forgotten most of it at this point
Look dreams are weird
Then i woke up and came here
But he wasn’t at the seminar
And for some reason solo was involved because i knew deep down in the dream that he would sacrifice himself based off f misinformation about two other people that were in that seminar thinf
So like apparently 2 of my irl friends were very sick and needed to go to this clinic
Her main goal was to try and spread massive misinformation so we would bring ourselves in to her for an “examination” thing
Err so the woman... what was she trying to sell to is
But some people from here were there and i somehow both represented them and didnt
Most of my irl people i know were there
By an absolute nut job lady
Then there was this presentation
But the family aspect soon fucked of
It started with me and my family going to the supermarket to visit the swimming pool for the day
Ill write as much as i can before i forget it
Solo was involved
I had a really interesting dream
Because i know many a situation where that honestly should’ve applied to myself in hindsight. I’m not good with *social* so im prone to just flat out failing common sense stuff. I wouldn’t want anyone to think i was stupid for failing to understand, just foolish
I disagree with the stupidity part
Is that rhe actual quote?
Dont attribute malice to what could be considered ignorance. This quotes basically what i live by
yanks are american dogs
to me anyway
see that isnt a slur
you would have to intentionally use a slur against me
daijobu, i am very hard to piss off
i usually just post the traps are Girls And Youshouldrespectthem picture
Thats good
Because in this dream you would’ve been the same age as me
Then dm it
Post it again
Havent you posted your face before?
Hold on
I think you just *were*
Any more remembering would prob have to come from me actually speaking and letting my unconcious midn cough it up
Nah, the moments passed at this point
And there was two
I remember *purple*
The dream has long passed but i wouldnt put it past me to say either lily or illi was involved in some way
Its hard to describe because it doesnt make sense
But most of that was based on the cognition of “you are going to die because of misinformation”
But i did have a rough mental image of you because i had to think about you
I never physically saw you
You... didnt have an image
yeah they would be crossing the american-canadian border
I’ll try
Urgh I’m probably not doing ok but ill stick around. If it becomes too stressful being here again ill just leave for a longer duration
I suppose you could say that was “first hint”?
See I always thought it was a little out the blue you leaving valk
I do plan to leave if i am exposed to transphobia again
I mean theres other reasons too
And i need him for programming stuff
Chicken is there
Ah i will in a bit
I left both the Symphogear discords because that was and still is one of the things my autism latched onto
Trying to manage the negative aspects of my autism. Its been triggering more and it was becoming very stressful. Tbh i was planning on going away for a week but i *hope* im somewhat ready now
I read up, i can actually explain why I left for a bit
Id imagine in the future not more trans people will turn up considering they let TERFs interrupt
It was ok till TERFs basically
This was handed out by protestors who basically did a little stoppage of London Pride

It is pretty disheartening that i share a discord with people with *questionable* views
Nothing more
One thing i will say tho, there are two reasons i am rejoining valk, some people and fanart
I actually kinda need an invite link to Valk but my phone is 2% so ill join it when i get home
Most of the people here are  yanks
Hell
But the old are scared of this sudden “i can speak to some cunt in Japan and call him hitler”
Because my generation consumes a lot of foreign stuff so we are pretty world tolerabt
All i know is my generation and the ones behind me are the ones who are gonna suffer from this
you have a nice boss
im happy for you
<:GenjuurouThumbsUp:336657189475188740>
becuase if they havent, then simply telling them no thanks should be fine
do you feel as if they have tried to rebuild that trust was broken when she snooped on your email?
they have a history of wanting to snoop on you?
im not fully sure what your family situation is, but they wont mind if you say no thanks is the assumption i am making correct?
then say you are doing something like that already
like a mental system perhaps
may i suggest saying you have your own way to keep passwords secure
and also for something like passwords
Paranoia against your own family is fine, you are a human after all
have they asked you?
Welcome to the UK
Btw the police did nothing about them lying in front of the parade
Something something donald trump
The collapse basically started at the top ye
Yeh but the romans fell bc they were too integrated /s
Brexit didnt help, it basically hit hard a message of “well nationalism is cool” globally
Then society collapses as people reach mass unemployment
Businesses will see the value of automation as it will become cheaper than humans
Give it time
Still have that bloke blocked
Ah ok
Or were those seperate things
That was during that like 2 ish day of argument no?
Hell in the UK people fell into Benefit traps where they couldn’t get a job because they would lose the money they needed to make it through the month
I was there too
Valk
*just need to stop being lazy*
*anyone can get out of poverty if they work hard enough*
Why do you still wear that hat?

Because.
Why did you buy that hat?

To win an election
Kerrik you know i have very simple excuses if i get asked questions which is actually just “im trans”
*what little they know*
At least give pics of the jacket
So did you buy a new jacket Kriisa?
I can see that already
Yori is lookin good
Need to have a selfie exhibition to verify everyone being cute af
Kriisa is probably mega cute rn but keeping it for herself
Woah wat
Need pics to verify the cuteness
Watch me
Become the twin tails
Kriisa join us
Known as TERFs
Me and vi are gonna fight eldric abominations
I must follow in my mentors footsteps and become the twin tails
Rukia showed me the path of twintails
I wana be the Twintails
So whats ya trans girls plans for hair styles
Wb
Hey Kriisa
It would’ve come up when we saw her mostly naked in s1
Soon I shall become miku niku
I don’t wana be top dad tho
<:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
Trust me I tried
As in harder to orgasm
It just becomes harder
Basically
Apparently on hrt your dick becomes softer amongst other things and i cant wait for that
Prepare dem tiddies
I know you lurk here
I need to mush my face in my gfs tiddies
Still would mush my face into rhe chest
Im going to slap those cags like Megumin did to Yunyun
I would want Germain
Look I would happily become bikki with relic cancer if it meant i was a girl
Kriisa hasn’t spoken here in a while so i can safely presume she is taking tons of selfies of her cuteness to spread to us
My phone knows
Its hrt
One of the recommended words
I like how if i put in ht
*het*hens
That probably rolls off the tongue better
Not het
You mean
Im mega gay
My brain just needs to realise that its bloody unhappy right now. Accept it and then also accept that you can fix it by transitioning with hormones and other stuff
Im glad to know when i hit massive doubt i can always regress back to depression. The sad thing is i could actually see myself doing that
Those massive dickheads
Fuck children
Guess its kinda redundant getting a vasectomy now
Oh yeah... i was thinking of getting that a few years ago because i knew i didnt want kids
God bless america...
wew thats fast
That gif isnt even from twin tails plz
Give me like.... 6 years
Im just gonna listen to music and.... exist
Didn’t work
Ill try listening to bark at the moob
Continue fighting these bouta everytime they hit
I don’t want to drown but what do i do? What can i do?
I’m scared I’ll reach my limit and can’t kick anymore to stay afloat
I thought i was certain at this point but I suppose bloody not brain
Oh yeah and I’m having massive spikes of douvt
But now im just lying here. Cant use the energy to get up, just mentally battered and wanting to cry to let it out but can’t
I used to cry so much before
Even though ive hit a massive low point basically just on a biological whim
Physically
I can’t cry
Just cause i may be fine with autism being used as a slur doesnt mean others are
Thing is tho, its dependant on the person
Today is a day of little spoons and im more or less out
Indeed
Ur german
*yet*
We arent banned are we?
Well
Or the fancy older way of saying it
Hard r n word for example
Some words have too much baggage to reclaim
Because implying someone who just looks feminine is a trap is also pretty bad because it implies anyone who looks feminine is just a “trap” imo
What would you say is *correct usage*?
Basically, contexr
Or describing someone as a trap
Ive used the word trap to explain it, but id be banned if i used it to alice for example
This isnt a complete ban on thw word, context bloody matters
More denying trans people even exist
Especially with traps are gays added to it as well
Which is wrong on a whole bunch of levels
It is saying 1. I an not trans i am a dude 2. That i am intentionally lying about my gender to trick men and 3. I am scum for doing so
Ok so let me explain what trap actually means
Yes, but calling me a trap is not
I mean thats for different reasons, leaving the empire
Gay?
Try calling a trans person a trap and see what happens
Especially when used against trans people
I was thinking of trap actually
Mainly thinking about the T slur
Some words are hyper overused no matter how much i give a shit bout it
Meanwhile im here just sorting business cards bc im making a “here are job agencies” thing
Like 15 people ish apparently came in but rhe person that was supposed to see them wasnt in
This place is as stable as the uk government
The job centre is on edge
So derailment time
Wake the hell up
i can easily play a tsundere or a calm and collected psychopath
yes but being transgender isnt a personality trait
or a white person playing an asian person
i believe in this day and age we would have problems with a white character playing a black person
the movie iirc
the amount of pressure for her to do so, no wonder she did
https://mobile.twitter.com/MagsVisaggs/status/1017751018950578177 this is a pretty fun read
We always open
Understandable
In Education atm?
I see
How old are you btw?
I do wish i could go to canada and hug you
Any helper worth their dough will find that you are able to make decisions
Same
High functioning?
Are they planning to send you to like a “no more trans” camp thing?
If their response is anger then no wonder you arent prepared
Have you told them you arent prepared to transition yet then?
^
Was there a particular cause?
Ok then
What is up my friend
And unless you count a promise to hug when we meet irl theres also no cost
~~cells at work discord is an emote server~~
Isnt it from tje cells at work discord?
try live shitposting?
I have to escape from asian family does that count
Wait who’s the two?
More money means move away faster
“We don’t live alone. We are members of one body. We are responsible for each other. And I tell you that the time will soon come when, if men will not learn that lesson, then they will be taught it in fire and blood and anguish. Good night”
She became our GM. Clearly that is a stressful job and we influenced her into that!
👀
More me is a horrible person
We are a horrible influence but for a different reason
Im taking a shot in the dark, but its as if shes somehow like “well shit she realised something without knowing anything about herself. Clearly i should know better then her, if i didnt notice then it doesnt count.”
Yup
It appeals to my feeling of singing away my problems. Technically blowing them up while singing is singing them away
I think I may have found the reason I love gear so much
The blood of the covenant is thicker then the waters of the womb
What about your other family
I feel mad and depressed, but good is okay too..
Good news though. Ive actually cried for the first time in weeks
Actually i dont want to offend actual cunts by comparing them to these low life scum
Fuck these asian cunts tho
You mean the army
Something about anime and maybe this anime brings us all together
They say that birds flock together
Oh shit the convo I had with my mom today was in the car too..., cars are scary
Hug
BARK at the moon is my favourite song of Symphogear period
A mic will do
I see
I imagine you have some kind of recording setup
Just a hobby thing
No money
/r/animesings?
They say turning your hobbies into a career is what turns a fun hobby into hard work
If you ever have more questions scrmz just hit us up
I mean we went to scrmz is an egg
Tbf i aint seen evangellion
Konosuba
CS is stressful
You go girl
<@!175163984197058560> 🥚
🥚
~~girl dicks are better~~
You sleep with Kro?
Trainee mod
How did that come bout
Also
I don’t remember talking to you day one
Well it took a while no?
Scrmz i should buy you like a trans bracelet thing to celebrate you coming here
~~and live in his country~~
Aww i wana meet kerrik and hug him
Pretty sure our relationship started with me being the Ritsu
Ive known you for a pretty short time span, but im glad ive had such an impact
Heck...
Tis why i dont pay it much thought
It would drive me mad
But i cant really think about how i was razors edge from offing myself
I wouldnt be alive if things went differently
I mean mines more significant
You just gotta deal with the cards you draw
I’ve subscribed to the thought process of its very pointless to think of what could have
They are bigger than chris
>3 days
They grow up so fast
Time is fast
Damm i knew Kriisa before ***i*** knew i was trans
You burst in
Then
Do voice training to sound more feminine
No no even better scrmz
Id kick em out myself
No thanks
They dont want some white boi coming in
Asian family
It comes with a pop filter
So i can record good
Im looking into getting like a £120 mic
But thats not <#336297840529899522> stuff
Oh fucking shit i just remembered something
We are actually pretty close to eachother
In a game of hearthstone
Ima beat them up
We gonna tho solo
Nah
And we hated eachother ever since
Yeh someday you and i just talked
Well steering it back into what we were talking bout
Probably not?
And also the “i would transition if i could become a gear”
I pinged you for the trans egg emoji
Only they can find out
Who knows
I was mod for 1 minute
Actually
~~scrmz got modded faster at Konosuba then i did here~~
We all have our burdens but bring them to this refuge of the mind and soul
“Give me your tired, your poor,
Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free,
The wretched refuse of your teeming shore.
Send these, the homeless, tempest-tossed to me,
I lift my lamp beside the golden door!”
And this probably describes this place
Anyway i found an old quote i saved
Scrmz is also underage
I know a lot of things
Listen love
Yes
Bad dragon 🤔
^
horray
🤞
next year
Never having to see them again hopefully
I suppose you are contempt with leaving that family hopefully forever
Preach sister
Aww
Morning
About Kriisa?
Ooh
I think if i had any artistic talent i would draw Alice holding a golden lamp
Meatspin or you spin me round?
I’m hopelessly trying not to think much bout the future right now
I’m not sure if its the right time to go “hey mum my new name is Rakhi”
See i *did* ask my mum to name me
Although it sounds appealing to be called Rakhi and have to answer me or *me*
Maybe if Rakhi dies/loses her memories id consider it
I dunno
Although this name if I chose it will probably be temporary
It has
The tabletop thing you watched
My own fuckin character
You know who else is named Rakhi?
Rakhi
There is only one name that’s done that. A name made from broken parts of a different language
“What name has not left my thoughts then?” I asked myself
As i was walking home one day i was thinking of names
I’ve had a lot of thoughts these few days
I mean nobody here exactly disagrees. Thats a fun read tho
when ignorance turns into malice it tends to happen
So wait did they take screenshots of here or they just name dropping people they dislike
*and they are jealous*
They have amazing fashion sense!
Calling us out?
They said most of this shit *without being prompted*
But iirc
Poes law in full effect
I know
https://youtu.be/QkXeMoBPSDk speaking of guns
*squint*
Sounds like a right punisher
Family is a fun thing
The name thing im... weary of I suppose
Bad puns aside
And say “im shooting with Sakimori”
I could call the gun the sentinel
Maybe I should have specced that instead of a shotgun
Huh
Isnt it also the Kriisa Vector?
How am i gonna kidnap you in the middle of town *during market day*
The short story is i learned how to lie to people
Sorry
The whisper was anonymous and hit all the roles
There was 3 “bulletproof” (can survive one bulletshot during the day), 1 Jailer, 1 Spy (Mafia who can whisper certain roles during the day) and 1 agent (Villager who can whisper certain roles during the day
There was this scenario which really tested myself
I also played a fuckton of epicmafia
A year paranoid your friends could be cylons can do that
I’m self taught
Game psychology and game theory is fun
Us v ai
We should play civ 5 together
Interesting question
Depends on the person and their medical stuff
Not all at once
Maybe pills too
Mostly
Patches or injections
Depends
Gib plz
Wheres mine
Thanks family
There’s a heavy amount of tension in my house right now
If you dont know maybe your colleagues do
Also colleagues
Its a case of then “ill get back to you on that” or even doing their own research infront of you
I mean a GP probably doesn’t know everything. Hell my GP searched up on the database my symptoms for a recent checkup i went to
Spoons are what i can do a day
Youtube vids is the zero spoon entertainment thing rn
I would love to but my energy to do stuff is sapped so i can barely even do stuff I enjoy
I probably need to sleep, typically time is a good way to pass depressive moods but these are getting more and more common
Thanks everyone
It hurts to wake up sometimes so why would i study? It sucks
And yet I don’t have the energy to put that smart to use
So nobody told me life was gonna be this way.... a girl stuck in a dudes body with a shitty childhood which has been mostly repressed. Autism so I struggle to understand the world and inadvertently piss people off and the intelligence to watch all this burn infront of me and go “its bad, what can I even do but shout into the void”
A mixture of feeling like nothing and feeling like shit
I’m a ball of chaotic but foggy emotions right now
time to spend tomorrow with my head pretty much down the entire day
Im trying my best to restrain myself from buying the trans thigh highs
You devilish girl
Kiriisa why i mucho wanto now
I just checked striped stockings
Show example
Striped stockings?
Wolf why
I really want to spend the cash I just got on thigh highs now
Thigh highs are more sock
*yes*
I dont want to take my knee high socks off even though im inside and its sorta warm because i feel really feminine right now
God my mood jumps fast doesnt it
Ala why it took me very long to accept im trans
It may not even be the second time you are thinking of the topic
Like binary first though then suddenly second thought
I wouldn’t take it literally tho
:hug: spend time to think about the words
Nothing can work for everyone
All advice depends on the individual no?
Do remember that we all human
A transphobic person wouldn’t actually see it as transphobia nor would they feel bad
Think of it like this
?
And more fun
Bc that seems easier
I actually want to cosplay as Megumin first
Legit
But ill suck it up because when i get to uni i can explode into a proper trans girl
Since im going through the NHS I’ll probably face some gatekeeping
I need to ask if i have been put on the adult waiting list
Shit that reminds me
<:MikuBliss:336657233712513024>
Zenbu
More knee highs
More socks
Underwear
Shirts
Shoes
Skirts
Waxing
Also that list is pathetically small
God i wish asian family all suddenly turned into supportive accepting family
Money works really well as a solo for that album
Just need to start playing Money by pink floyd
Well i starting talking here feeling very feminine and now im feeling very feminine AND resisting the urge to spend
Like danny devito in that one Always Sunny episode
Smoooth
I dont care about pain. Dysphoria is more painful
Id pay for arm and leg hair wax
Theres some places nearby in town that do waxing
If d rather just wax it all
I can only imagine how cute you look while skating wolf
It was really hard. I might need to buy another razor because mine got a little bit lore dull
For only my left leg
I shaved like up to my ankle
It’s been favourited for a looong time for me
*found*

Then why is she allowed to be typing?
Join us in *the pit*
<@!102691114762371072> i keep seeing “shirabe.exe is typing” but nothing happens. Is that supposed to happen?
The army is
Better start stockpiling
So a massive pit
UK
Ono
Miku we should meet <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
And also i dont want to be outted
I need the monies
Plz
No scrmz
You cant hide the thigh highs as easily
No rakhi think logically
It is but one of my many wild dreams
Aaaaah the thigh highs are soo tempting to buy
Eris is a shit bot then
Oof
Specially in shitposting
Btw some people there do use the t slur and im very conflicted on that. Just so you know
I believe i came into konosuba with the trans symbol
Waay before actually
Did you know i realised i was trans at the start of this year?
Well scrmz time is paradoxically short and long
I should do that as a costume for when i am in last days of year 13
That seems like a neat isea
Bye
Well time to fight newly found dysphoria with Twintails
PE4 is a reference
B-baka
Thats why yori transitioned into complimenting me
<:ChrisEmbarassed:336656400472080386>
*its actually PE4*
Thats a touchy topic 😆
Im asian
I’m imagining how my classmates would react if i came out to everyone with a megumin cosplay
I would gladly donate what beard growth i have to you
Question. Do you present as female when you arent skating or is this only for skating kinda thing?
Already though im thinking ive been getting remarks from family that my hair is long/too long
Might be the shampoo i use maybe
Even after a decent brushing its really knotty
I need to go to a barbers ive never been to and ask for advice about my hair
And repeat that for 3-4 years
I dont care bout the job thing. Im seeing a year where i get to study a course i love AND get to transition as well
Thats when i will reach peak rakhi
Tights are the end game for me
Socks are best
Knee high socks

My nails gather a lot of muck underneith
Scrmz if you ever wana talk we here for u
Pay money probably
They are all over the place
I need to fix my nails as well
Dunno
A bit better?
Gender and sexuality arent the same
Yeah about to say
No gusta sex?
Id imagine a collar would fail to fit you if it isnt the right size
Do you want to *own* cat girls?
Does it count if i started programming but absolutely hate it?
Kerrik is too much of a sweetheart to hurt me intentionally. If he does hurt me i can always just tell him that
And other related meme subreddits
And /r/egg_irl
Try looking at /r/traaa
Kerrik you are an absolute sweetheart
Especially since this is stuff id be wearing at home
I dont wana go toooo crazy
I will be with my mum
Dresses me gusta
Why clown shoes tho
Where ill be able to dress however the fuck id like
Which i can hopefully live in
I was cleaning a house
I wasnt in my house all day in knee highs
Its not that bad
Sadness
Well the time has come to actually take tr lnee highs off
I actually dont know your irl name scrmz because im a lazy git
👀 everyone calm for a bit
No no its ok
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
Bitch we set up ping for pics!
Me?
Tsubasa kazanari
One day ima ammend my name and make my middle name ibu
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
Shes legally changing it to that
Her name is saki
Dead name
Taking memes from traaa kerrik?
Find the thing you feel comfortable saying “i am this”
But thats what ive seen
Typically cis people dont really struggle with gender identity, at least not for a long period of time
As long as you are happy me lovely
Out of curiosity?
Ox have you ever browed /r/egg_irl?
Yuri empress alice
Yuri queen alice
Thats what i did at first
Call boss “yuri girl”
Scrmz seems like a very neutral name so i like it
👀
What made you think i was a trans girl alice
See i did feel off when i told you my irl name scrmz but its ok because you basically just called me ibu the entire time
^
Sauna whore
Gottem
I trust your gut
And no i wont call you that ill call you scrmz bc you said yourself you felt off when you said ur irl name
From what you’ve described this doesn’t really feel like the source of the discomfort of the name tho...
Kerrik hush you
Would you feel better if you had a different name by chance?
What part of it didnt feel right?
What else is confusing you
We always welcome to talk love
Agnotism?
Less memes rn Kerrik
What happened
Makes it sound like shes a commie
More cogs to the machine
It would be easier to keep to yourself in a bigger town no?
Although they are most likely just crushes
That might explain why im attracted to a lot of people here
But last time i did that i repressed being trans sooo
When in doubt i use autism as a scapegoat
I dunno where i get it from
Im very flirty
?
Babies steps
Go there
Kerrik has a house
Ill date anything which compliments me enough for me to be attracted
Short
And
Long
Time is paradoxically
In 10-15 years time i may be able to meet and skate with you
You are more important
Im getting dejavu
Why not both?
That sounds hot
Oh hey fellow switch!
Ah so me around family?
Remind me what is stealth?
You two are really cute
I wont win this race tho...
Skirts are great
<:ShirabeEmbarassed:336657288477671436>
Something like this?
This is a result I got from google
...maybe, hopefully
And at least there i can be a girl at home
On the plus side i should be moving into a different place by end of summer holiday hopefully
Urgh, only clothes i have left rn are pretty masc
Bit then you cant look at the one you love
Kerrik we are being kept in the dark!
If you say my name twice does that mean you didn’t say my name?
My new name doesnt mean i am an old sniper who works with a bunch of children fighting noise
Kerrik I have some shocking news for you
But nothing beats winter snuggles
I mean you can still cuddle and it’s alright
Oh my
Summer is too hot?
Summer is too hot
Winter cuddles are good
Cuddles are always good
Sex and gender are separate
Is something else
Society
You maybe for a long time
But you are leaving tuem hopefully forever so screw em anyway
I honestly would just record them acting like cunts and show said company afterwards
It wouldn’t placate family like she thinks it would
Something my mum suggested was come out to family and then do nothing for a year. I shot that down hard
And looking to go for America
Since i want to go for a study abroad year
Me meeting you could be half of 10 years
Not just us as people
God knows what the future holds
10+ years is my way of saying if i ever meet you the next day better have some skates
Well I’ve figured out specifically why I feel really shitty now, things I have little control over
My existence for a year basically...
With dysphoria just gotta ride it...
I feel kinda shitty rn so ima go lie down, have fun everyones!
It just feels *off* whenever i get referred to as “the man”. Thr wordt part is ive basically become a father figure for my brothers and i dunno how to feel about that
Kinda hurts a lot thinking about it now and that mentality is stuck around me
I basically grew up with the whole “oldest boy” and “first boy”
Skirts are really nice and i cant wait to wear one in the future
Lat is what ur thinking similar to the story on the right?
Gah why the fuck my egg shell have to crack now
This open oppressive life im in right now
Right now it’s something I have to do to escape
Also please don’t I really don’t like CS enough to understand what I would be seeing
That sounds snarky for some reason
Thanks everyone
At least I can not dip into heavy mental breakdowns when I struggle further with my project in the future
Thats good to know
...ok
I don’t want to really be discussing this project right now though...
Room booking system
That sounds like shit ima have to learn
UI?
When im just absolutely overloaded with my problems crushing me like a shit storm avalanche the last thing on my mind is CS, something i deeply regret taking
It’s easier said than done
Theres no session to fix
I haven’t started it
And I’ve been so demotivated to even start
But I need to learn more python for that
A lot of computer science course work basically
I have a lot I need to do
I don’t even know how to feel about that
Apparently it’s quite obvious since last week my co-worker guessed i was autistic almost immediately
Sometimes im scared to speak because I know all too well Autism makes it so I can just not read a situation
Scared of it hurting even more
Im scared of waiting. Scared of what can happen though
It hurts and I have to wait
At least I have the willpower to get that out
Maybe the depression is worse than I thought
I think I’m starting to hit fatigue on life
For starters i know actual cunts and you arent even close to them
Well believe what you want but i care for you deeply
Anyone who says otherwise is a cunt
Comrade, you are damm well allowed to have problems
I kinda just want to turn into jelly rn
I think it was made obvious from the start of this vent that im in a bit of bad mood
Yes
I’m in that kinda mood
I wouldn’t hesitate to kill them
She dum
<:TsubasaYareYare:407397617451139073>
With your experience you could actually probably work with TEFL in the UK iirc
You mentioned it before
“Friends”
Ah sorry
Like I would actually send that screengrab to any trans friends that your mother has. I understand if you don’t want to deal with that fallout though
Tell you what though she seems pretty determined to lose contact with her daughter forever
Exactly
Wow saki it looks like your mother knows everything about your brain and stuff and what you feel to a teen /s
Your voice is so good it triggered your narc mum
If it’s feeling like too much on your shoulder please at the minimum vent your frustration here love
Gooood
What’s your date you plan to leave?
Yup
Google?
Depends on the state?
Make sure you’ve packed before you start operation sayonara
That’s amazing
Oh yeah i sang that for karaoke
👌
Ringo
It looks good though
You fought for yuri girl?
Im going to name my child Aegis
I mean its my character in kriisas campaign
And my name came from the void
Its only lewd if scrmz makes it
I *am* going to his place
I don’t mind if it’s you
Its fi
Nowadays less common but I still do it sometimes
When im nervous I try and touch everything about an object
Yes
I think its clothing although I did just discover this
Mm
Its more materials
Thats not my thing
Eh...
I never thought it could be something autistic related but that makes parts of my life make more sense
Huh
Stimming?
I’ve had an urge to buy a ton of socks but with different feels to them
Is there a word for a fetish about different materials and wearing them?
<3
They may also give medication
And you will be expected most likely to get help to find the cause of the anxiety if one exists
Or talk with you themselves
Will refer you to a therapist probably
Your go
<3 I send you my love
I dunno scrmz, have *you* heard of friends with benefits?
Bitch thats why I asked *you* to say it
Nah might as well tell em
Shouldn’t be too long
You wana explain it?
I dunno if I should tell them the actual what’s our relationship right now scrmz
:p
<:ShirabeEmbarassed:336657288477671436>
Saki has given her blessing for us two
Oof poor scrmz can’t handle this
Legal age in uk is 16 <:GarieWink:336657101273169921>
I guess im trying to rationalise it because it’s pretty irrational
When i feel like a drain plug has touched me I’ve felt like ive been shot with a massive burst of negative stimulation
Plugs?
I think i could describe my phobia like that...
Hmm
<@99695384296701952> you mentioned about stimming, but is there such a thing as the reverse?
We all woke enough to realise gender is too much hassle to be caught up on so express yourself how you want
Hey skating is cool
I may have to stay in the closet while in uni and im obviously fighting to not do that. But im a selfless creature and I don’t want to send my mum to the dogs of crappy judgemental family just because i wished to be who i was
Yea
I feel like a pretty big mess but it’s hard to write what specifically
But it doesn’t feel new. I’ve been out to myself for a few months and I’ve done a lot but also so little at the same time because of circumstances. Its frustrating as hell
With how much I’ve been thinking about underwear recently I feel less like a girl wanting to express herself and more of a pervert
Horray for being both dysphoric and aroused...
She wants to know about the other person and what ive done
My gf has another girl and shes told me “you can see other people i just want deets” but maybe others will be different
As long as everyone is ok with it?
Anyway thanks a lot lat
I was comfortable enough accepting sexuality wasn’t binary, accepting gender as non binary wasn’t hard
I understand that gender is like a spectrum, but putting myself on that spectrum is the harder part
With NB stuff I think im pretty comfortable with calling myself a girl because my brain can comprehend that if that makes sense. Or rather my brain making sense of it
Im pretty sure I called myself ace because I didn’t see myself as the male in relationships
I know
I thought for a long time i was asexual but my gf seducing me and also questioning my gender made me not think that
Wait what do you mean by more than a girl tho?
Good to know my hearts back to doing that
The fact that my heart... did something when you said sister gives me some hope
I’ve been feeling pretty black i guess all day now...
I think the worst thing about this is that it’s probably low chances of happening and almost worst case scenario but its hard not to think about right now
In the cost of having nowhere to go back to
Self love
if someone looks at trailers and goes "well that game looks fun ima buy it", they prob gon buy it and play it. all kinda factors could affect that but different peeps have how much stuff affects them
^
i dunno, that apology has a lot of different ways to read it
Starting to think 13k saved pics of anime girls was another unhealthy coping mechanism
Then what i could best describe as IGNITE module hit my heart
And i shouted in my mind “do you want to be called a girl?!”
I was in bed
Poor me had 14 days after their birthday before they got plunged into a world of the highest and lowest they’ve ever been
14 January
I figured out when there was the first crack on my egg
That always feels like unhealthy escapism
I have a bloody world in my head where im a woman
That was delaying this tho
I did
Then I just exist
Until im not depressed
Get positive responses which don’t hit me because I can’t feel
All I can do is vent
Its maddening
Of feeling like this on and off
A year maybe
Probably won’t be for a long time
I’m not on hrt
But it’s the few things that give me joy
Well masturbating daily probably isn’t good either
Just depressed at later dates
Nothing’s changed
I come back to vent about the same thing
Im a mess
Im not tho
I feel like im seeking attention
Ugh I don’t even know what im feeling right now
I know not to drink
This keeps happening
I tried abstinence but that hurt as well
Porn just provides a shitty solution to dysphoria
Im scared if i start alcohol ill depend on it
Cuz human brains suck
It hurts a lot
Why am I a girl....
But ive been using it to battle my dysphoria
I kinda dont like it
Its why im conflicted
I didn’t buy GTA:V, my brothers did
I have a ps4
Micro transactions
Well im actually contemplating giving money to rockstar for GTA:O
Maybe theres a reason i love bikki so much
Having all the noise go away is liberating
Hugging sounds really nice... when i hug my mind typically becomes empty
I don’t like going outside no thanks
Kerrik me and scrmz has already met up
That means a lot scrmz
And it leads into another, longer loading screen
But theres a bug which may reset the progress
That would be me
That would be a few months
It didnt break
That was cracks in my egg
That was actually like 3 hours ago there’s probably waaaay more pins on that board
Something i saw in town
Prius are the hybrid car things
I see...
Meanwhile i live 4 minutes away from a supermarket
Even if I dont have chainsaw for hands?
All cute girls have chainsaw for hands
Hand nail
Manicure is just nails no?
Rest those fingers by playing Cook Serve Delicious <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
As i was taking the picture a pretty old lady was next to me basically following the whole disagree with first three agree with last one
A few hours later

So i checked it again
Apologies, guess im using the wrong word?
US Senator John McCain dies aged 81 http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-45312217
yes but gun culture still exists
probably isnt going to happen under trump
humanity is moving pretty fast
and would you say australias gun culture was at the same size as Americas?
:hug:
i think incentivised is if you used something as a bonus for them rejoining choir
ooooh
how so?
well you are in the same situation as my girlfriend so im pretty sure you are doing well <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
:hug:
oh nevermind i think ive used the wrong word
but its gonna depend on the relationship
i deal with my jealousy with competitiveness
but other than that
still stuff with cute girl
yea about to say
Im a politics girl
Scrmz did yea
Im going Exeter too so I’ll say hi too maybe
The boat licence can go a long way, hell maybe in uni somewhere
Like the driving licence you could honestly put way back in your mind
Best advice i can give
Try and take it one task at a timr
Well i can probably help you out with looking at uni courses maybe
:hug:
And im guessing the course contents are far too similar to make heads or tails over which one to pick?
The UCAS application allows you to select up to 5 unis
How many are you going to visit?
Yeah booking the open days can be pretty stressful
Ive had people tell me that they are *intimidated* by him
Urgh hes not a fun person in school anyway
So i cut that out
But mostly because interacting with people became a massive pain
I have been half doing that
Oh boy wont it be a pretty thing
But its not gonna be pretty
I probably will
Uses a terrabyte storage thing to hold beatles stuff
Owns a fuckton of vinyl
Hes a music junkie
Thats how I describe him lul
He also brings up times where he tries to show me a meme and i ignore him.

Because im working on a project in class
Something he wouldn’t have gottwn
The meme was woke prog rock memes
This is him saying i blanked him because i once shared memes to my woke prog rock music friend rather than him in CS
Top tier quotes
Gomenasorry kriisa!
So ask her
But I didn’t have it anymore
I told him it was Kriisa who gave it to me
He asked me for it
Thats my fault sorry
Oh
*sits on chair backwards* tell me more
Did he actually
Woah what
If hes made an alt and lurking here (which I wouldn’t be surprised if he did do that) i would rather he see constructive commenta
If hes made an alt and lurking here (which I wouldn’t be surprised if he did do that) i would rather he see constructive commenta
I don’t particularly mind for this
No no i get it
Err why not both saki, multitask?
I let people come to me rather than talk to them these days cause im dead inside
Fuckin bitch i told you go speak to me if you wana talk
“(I am) Trying to fix our friendship” in context to me not talking to him
If you dont mind me ima vent a bit more
Im very tempting to let him throw himself off the cliff and pick it up from there. I was already sick of having to pull him away from the edge
And i cant be asked to do that
Id show some screenshots but id have to cross out some names
If he did we would have this conversation about someone who is a fucking cunt not a “friend”
Only used my nickname
He didn’t gender at all
Like because she had the gaul to explain my actions he starting going “oh [me] is such a saint fuck off with that”
Throughout the entire thing he kept twisting my girls comments into completely different things
That was my assessment looking at him back then and i sure as hell stand by it
Where he would have probably offed himself
He was banging on about me threatening him. I was getting him to seek some bloody help for once and not run back home
He strongly has it in me for being a “hypocrite”
*and if your lurking here well done you can read*
I have the fortune of knowing him IRL
Remember Vali?
Well a lot of this was talking behind my back, as in this *lovely person* ranted about me to my girlfriend
I never thought G Shirabe would ever happen to me but well here i am
One of my “friends” is a shit
But i did get to look at my issues
I don’t really like either
I argued a tiny bit against her and her main thing was she has boobs and i dont have a supportive family
She said my issues outweigh her own
My girl made a point in the screenshots i saw which woke me up a little bit I guess
But ive had worser thoughts last waaay longer
I have had thoughts about that in the past
I would probably be killed if i tried to fight hik
Ah he’s actually pretty strong so
I for one wont be a part of that help anymore
He’s mentally ill and im pretty sure he isn’t getting enough help
Looks for hate to validate the hate he thinks he gets
Sounds like something he does
Another reason I don’t wana do CS (minor one tbh) is hes in that class
Hopefully 1 year
Pretty sure that was the reason he was banned here
Ah yea. Well thinking about it maybe he is somewhat of an attention whor
I’ve not heard the word pathetic used to describe him before
Nice
:hug: thats gotta suck
Headpat
Its me in the present who hurts
Im always fine in the future
Right now kind words bounce off but afterwards in the future I’m fine
Ive kinda just sat and stewed in this shitty mood
Nothing is 24h here anyway
I was planning too
I don’t
I don’t wana get stabbed
AM
Its 12:22
My girlfriend has recently been calling me a catgirl and agreed when I accused her of taming me. I felt happy but now for some reason all that joy i had not just from that but today kinda just went
For some reason i feel.... really shit all of a sudden
Ooh
Skating too?
Maybe _thats_ why i absolutely loved the knee highs scrmz brought me. Eternal hugs
Hopefully wont be too messy
Ye
Realised my family sucks?
Which kinda just makes me a bit more sad rn bc i have to lie in the first place
My plans were already lie to them
I cant ignore that
They arent common but they do exist
I wouldn’t call them an ally to put it lightly
No no lat this person i would not want them to know i was trans
Hell as i was leaving tje bloody house my nan had a go at me for having long hair and telling me go get a haircut
But it will cost
I will
As she’s realised what my wristband is
She was also asking my cousin who told me all this if i was trans
I probably have more limited space in buying clothes than I thought because one of my aunts was being very judgemental behind my back because 1. My hair is long and 2. **i wear pink**
And they look cute, and i know especially on her
Meanwhile she is currently shopping for school clothes
So basically it’s something i sorta wear while im at hers
I did buy something but id have to hold it at hers
Yea...
Clothes shopping with my gf is.... interesting
Lots of clothes i would love to buy but cant yet because of a whole buncha reasons
Carefully
Yay, gatekeeping!
Casual late night flirting?
I have a drawing to live upto
Same
Actually less sad if i get accommodation for thar
I dont think politics has a foundation year sadly
But my business teacher was much like “this is most likely gonna change so dw”
It does
I do feel deflated a bit, but i know im still gonna work hard and apply for unis if that grade goes up or down
While i dont know what my end game predicted grades actually are, i know at the moment i have a C
You never know
Try to apply anyway
See my school is sorta doing the same thing as yours but mine actually dont care about it too much
are you 18 now scrmz?
Have 1-2 pipedreams, have 2-3 achievable unis and have a worse case scenario uni
Keep shooting until you hit
Its like tankery
I like the Sayori advice
Yup
Some
Is politics a popular course?
O ye
?
If will be lucky if i get B for that
I wana say i could beat that ABB but im doin CS
An extra year without home
Well for starters unbottling some emotions maybe even here or just somewhere would be healthy
I never would have thought the words I once used to comfort my now gf could be given to me rn
Im kinda scared looking back and wondering how i managed to take so many mental blows
But i just played out venting right now as i was thinking about what to type
I have a lot to vent i think
I wouldnt put it past my country
Hopefully
Relatively yea
Ironic perhaps that time is the thing that has demotivated me the most
So my Extended Project which is worth half an a-level is getting traction for me. I get to research time travel in fiction, write an essay about what i found and write a novella using what i found.
Just have to not think about the massive glass ceiling about me which is cracking under the weight of 40 grand pianos
Good news tho im slightly less depressed than i was before
Probably
Nah its fine wrestling is just mega gay anyway
When their music plays
Where the wrestlers come from
It makes sense to me...
Can be pretty damm unexpected
Love is very much like a steel chair behind you when you look at the entrance ramp
Did lyssa provide that?
I don’t feel as if I have a cute personality or feel cute in general
See I blush a little but I don’t really believe you
I have a little bit of a problem with people telling me im cute because I don’t believe them
One is all
Is that too much to ask for kami-samaa
I want to be all the keionbus
If 1st isnt Ui...
She is nicknamed Azunyan
Azusa fron K-On
And be white
And learn japanese
Let me get cat ears
No harm in being the Azunyan of the group
Lots o uni societies
One of my more favourite jokes by a brit panel show when trump was elected “yes... they broke through the rubber padded ceiling”
I mean ive heard it before
No no we’re talking about glass and ceilings not bridges
I dont see the problem here
Well if the ceiling breaks the pianos crush me
Yea she wants to put her own internet restrictions
Most likely yes
Clothes i had before are just too big now
Dunno how
I’ve surprisingly lost weight over the few months
More fat for boobs maybe?
Thats how I gained weight
It will probably be quite a while before the music stops ringing loudly inside me
Don’t think my young self was thinking about that when they binge read books they liked
When i get home it would be so beneficial for myself to review or revise the lessons i had today but i come home and just crash
Everyone has been telling me im smart as I’ve been growing up because I’ve done well in stuff younger than most, but I feel as if im constantly hitting a brick wall with my motivation being sapped
I’m getting stressed at the start of the school day by starting work. Not exactly a good sign
I thought it was just one blob
Oh well then i have the depressing part and also the anxious part. Good to know
Today the main thing ive done was hum the evil ladys theme from KLK
Cause when i was young and not getting therapy for autism I used to hum extremely loudly in order to drown out the world when i was anxious
Well good news I fully know im depressed right now but bad news I don’t know what of my many problems is the main factor
Perhaps that is a sign of how mature you look rather than agw
I’ve heard
Sorry if this is slightly deraily but i really find it fascinating that you teach in other countries.it seems like a really interesting thing that you can say you do
Some mean ass students
Well good to know we both cant ^_^
I cant fully express my emotions about it, I think because i felt multiple
But... it was a surreal experience
And she kept saying that she was going to give it to me when i grew suitable tits of my own
I think it’s because of my chest that wearing my gfs bra was kinda alien
Unless you think this is hieroglyphs 👀
Thank you zio, they express my pain well
I didn’t know something could hurt so much but feel so good
I tried a bra on yesterday, long story short me and my girlfriend are both perverted
What better time to vent something than at work!
Its frustrating
It hurts
I have a mountain ahead of me and im struggling to climb the hills
I mean i *had* a crush on him for a reason id imagine
Im glad I have a place to vent but it’s getting harder to do so for many reasons
Less learned and more I didn’t off myself
I did that before and almost died for it
I know
Im slowly losing ways to do that
Why life pain
Im not a girl pain and I feel horrible pain
Its emotional pain in general
I’ve dumped my emotional pain here for god knows how long, im surprised people still have words to say
At what point is it too much
I have a surprising amount of mental anguish that i dump here
My heart kinda feels half empty and half pained now
Down days suck
But thanks
I wish
On the plus side I’m less depressed now just puzzled, curious and slightly worried
Which is mixed with love, depression and while that was going on being called cute and stuf
Its like a massive sludge of emotions...
Like there may be a long german word for the emotion
Maybe its chest dysphoria, just highlighted hard..
I think
Both
So thats fun..
So ive spent like 1 or 2 days thinking about it and im no closer to what on earth i felt when i tried that bra on
I mean i see you as very mature so at the minimum id imagine its a factor
Its always hard waking up
Im gonna try and sleep
Urgh
Until you are an empty shell
Depression is a cancer which saps away at the good things
Why i liked the other prides way more
London pride comes to mind
Humans are weird AF
Soo tribalism?
But you always seem genuine and kind
Maybe its wrong
Its how i see it

Twas an interesting top comment read
Although tbf a lot of cis people would probably find the role outdated and a tad bit sexist
You know looking back me hating a lot about my “role as a male in this culture” nakes a lot of sense
I wanted to do them but i had a lot of social barriers stopping me from doing that
In my culture there is a thing called Mendhi, which is where they apply some brown paint on your hands
People have been, well *talking* cause my nails were long
Its multi purpose
I fo
So thats nice
She’s giving me the push i wish I could give myself
No painted nails but so they basically are done up nails and appeasing the **fuck heads who should stop giving a shit about how i act**
I mean my mum is basically pushing me to get a manicure
Urgh I thought since its been a while i was out of my bout but its still hooked onto me
With my gf we just call eachother the big trans
Oh so they are a trans guy?
Best if they dont
Person
Vali
👀
Kerrik i get a small sense of dejavu when you say that...
Same
No fault on the people that went, but dam them security and stuff dropped da ball
I feel bad when i get jealous of the yanks who get hormones faster and with less gatekeeping
God knows what Brexit will do as well
Money wise anyway i may come out of this emotionally broken
But hey at least its free...
No wonder suicide rates for trans people are high here...
The second one is where they dish out the hormones
Oh i did a tad bit of research and im waiting an extra 12 months for hormones...... they do thr first assessment and then the second one
But they typically want people to socially transition first
I know i want the tiddies
And all of this fora first session which most likely will be assessing if i am trans
There is a large chance that this waiting period is just a waiting list for a 6-month waiting list though
So i can be in therapy probably by next December
The waiting period is still 18-24 months
I was referred around June
Oh yeah i got an update on my GIC referral
Legally yes
Hello
Its kinda frustrating being unmotivated to do work i kinda need to do
Welcome to the land of the living
Whatever that useful thing may be I strongly doubt if it is helpful *for me*
What i needed was therapy *a few months ago*
Id have to go a bit more far away to attend some support group which does not really solve my problem
Im pretty sure the only one in this area is for 18 under as well
At least not until ive been exiled from my family
It seems pointless to join a support group like that
So if i ever feel like im depressed  because i dont have tits i can join a group of people who also dont havr tits
But on the bright side the person on the phone gave me a list of trans support groups in the area
Even if Corbyn becomes PM in the near future I strongly doubt he would be on the rush to make these institutions better
Ive heard a lot of different options and i kinda wana hear more
What is your opinion on Brett Kavanaugh and the Ford accusation?
So question for everyone
Hopefully thats some good news then
Wfc omg :hug: are you feeling ok?
Technically it was late night but good jawb wobbles
:hug:
Contact them *then* call the police
Contact the police?
Apparently one way of cheating is using your brain and remembering potential answers which may come up in the exam
Aagh fuck words
I keep thinking of worse case scenarios that can happen rn and I don’t wana take the risk of them being true because of what im saying and the consequences of saying words
I’m gonna try and sleep
Even now im extremely anxious asking for *advise*
I have a major problem asking for help
I... think ive just realised something about myself
About what I posted a bit above?
Weird timing and I feel bad for asking this but do you have any advice for me?
Happy birthday
Am I worrying too much about what people think or do I not worry enough
Presuming this isn’t just me going batshit crazy and blaming it *on* autism
Why now is autism hitting me harder than usual
Words suck why cant we just mash brains together to understand eachother
Being ill has put my brain on overdrive.... so ive become more anxious about interacting with people again
We here to talk mate
:huggu:
Just vote in your midterms
Hell if you do like this vote
If you don’t like this then vote
So any yanks lurking and reading, yall should vote
Soo... Justice Brett Kavanaugh
For the extremely lazy here are the tweets
Wait how the hell are you awake
Ah
This isn’t a marital problem?
Urgh im not prepared for today
Large chance “Vali” is gon come up to me today and ask why i have been “avoiding” him recently
If you can find any hindu people i know that the ones ive met had some solid vegetarian food
Im gon be a mess when hormones hit me
Im already somewhat empathetic
One thing ive found that was common for my friends on hormones is that they are more empathetic
Estrogen changes your behaviour
Ive had an epiphany of sorts
Shout at me to work maybe
Its 99% school work
But im not stressed about work work
Im applying for another
Even though I’ve told myself you can do this work tomorrow after school not now because its night im still a bit stressed about it
Life is too exhausting sometimes
Stress from work is getting to me
White, male and young
No no theres like a stereotype specific demographic that falls for this
Is there a name for that demographic that falls for that kinda shit?
For someone who aspires to be a politician somewhat, i feel im pretty shite with words
Hard to put into words
It’s my perspective on life i suppose.
Its never really late tho
Better “late” than never
Im trying not to think too hard bout my future. I need good grades to get into uni so I can at least socially transition without the threat of being kicked out.
But school is so hard to focus on, and i know part of that is depression stemming from dysphoria
Saki you’re a precious friend
My body is that of a girl trapped in a guys body
My mind is that of a girl
E makes it more believable
Alice same
Id rather be on E
Weighing the pros and cons
I don’t feel as if its a negative right now, more an observation ive made just mow
I may go back to the sobbing mess i was prior to puberty
Or just in general feel sad but dont cry
Considering how often i tear up
Productivity report: i did most of a small af essay...
Tell you what im gonna be shagged for the exams if i can barely do a 25 mark question in like 2-3 hours
Yes but it isn’t completed. I’m not exactly going to be praised for barely done homework because the expectation was... well *homework*
The problem is speed
That is actually what I just did
It cuts deeper than I think if I believe ive done something to hurt or annoy someone by accident
And how people react to what I say or what i do and what they think
One thing ive talked little about is my paranoia about everything I do
I think ive exhausted advice now.  Part of me thinks I post here for attention anyway
I feel like I’m drowning and the only thing I can do is wait for the water level to drop
The cycle of struggling to work and being stressed about lack of work done
I feel like a massive mess...
"She is like a chess player who only has the king left - all she can do is move one square at a time until she is check-mated." 
Loyal Ministers describe Theresa and her standing especially with EU negotiations
well looks like they are gonna stick to good old genitals...
"Any dispute about one’s sex would have to be clarified using genetic testing." from the article
ah ok that makes sense
sorry if i got anything wrong, trying to understand how they can try and do this
but what law are they targeting exactly into how that is being implemented?
im being reminded of no child left behind
so a bit curious, this kind of decision involves only the executive no?
we gon have to see where this leads...
"And if our human rights laws stop us from doing it, we will change the laws so we can do it. "
Theresa May about tackling Terrorism
no gender laws in mars
so how does this interact with how at a state things are ruled versus how it is ruled federally?
i try not to, but honestly a lot of that is just me wishing "just be idiots dont be people who are absolute cunts"
aaah
so that means if you've had *the surgery* the administration hurts itself in the confusion
I had to condense it into one
Two pages?
Yeah its a bit like that
Why not?
When i get home, i can dig up mine?
Thats a problem with who defines assault weapon no?
In America at least the idea was to stop “the tyranny of the majority”
Thats more a criticism of first past the post and the electoral college
Thats a bit more like it
Yes but it doesn’t mean you should automatically assume its true though
The judicial review isnt in the constitution no?
Im going to presume that wasn’t just being sarcastic
That sounds correct if I remember what ive learned correctly
oh nvm, anyway im listening
sit a while and listen
Im confused
Thanks for that
Ah
And then tbe house needs the other one
If it starts feom the states its either 3/4 or 2/3
Like for example
Isnt it 3/4 where it starts and 2/3 elsewhere?
Thats the tyranny of the majority being prevented
It is what ive formed my thoughts on it while studying it in my class
Some amendments basically going back on what previous amendments did
With a constitution that was intended to be changed often but instead has survived this entire time with 27 amendments
Think of a country founded in order to prevent the tyranny of both the mass as well as to prevent dictator esque power similar to the king
The right wing leader won in Brazil no?
About the US specifically tho
A quote I remember hearing a lot
“All politics is local”
or maybe the mods are divided in what to do
they also talked about how they had lost a lot of people due to said people using slurs and stuff
their solution was to give me a role which would completely block out the channel dedicated to shitposting and off topic chatter. in general the server structure makes it so that any non gup discussion happens there
ooh
the t slur and then kinda double downed on that really kinda disgusting meme after i said can you not
cant place my finger on it
i got a sense of dejavu though when one of the mods messaged me after i left
i figured 🤷 
i got my fanart though so whatever. still kinda sucks
some i am personally sensitive to
allowing the use of slurs
the GuP subreddit discord is a bust, heads up for the future i suppose
The argument was that it was a time of war
so something came up in my politics and i wanted to hear some different perspectives if i could.
Schenck v. United States: Basically a man was arrested for handing literature opposing the draft, stating that the 13th ammendment has a direct conflict with the draft, specifically involuntary servitude.
The supreme court ruled that because he did this at a time of war, his speech posed a clear and present danger that congress had a right to prevent. 
A famous quote from this is as follows:
```The most stringent protection of free speech would not protect a man in falsely shouting fire in a theatre and causing a panic. [...] The question in every case is whether the words used are used in such circumstances and are of such a nature as to create a clear and present danger that they will bring about the substantive evils that Congress has a right to prevent.```
Our class was asked how we personally felt about the issue, and it brought up the topic of both national service and free speech. What do you think about the ruling?
I don’t think ive been careful and mindful in the past. For all I know im just recklessly screeching my pains out again and again
I’ve done this before already. How many more times can I before people just run out of things to say
I feel paranoid that I’ve tried the patience and good will of everyone around me. I feel shit for all of the worries I carry every day with school to just waking up. I’m starting to feel as if I’ve reverted back a bit because I’m asking myself why am I even saying anything to here or to anywhere. Attention? I’m scared if that answer is yes
I thought cooling off for a bit would improve my mental health but nothings changed
So just being outside can just exhaust me
Work was 3 and a half hours of me on my phone
I felt exhausted coming home after work
I think its just a lot of things crashing on me right now
I don’t really know which is probably the worst part
Well I suddenly feel like massive shit. Thats fun
.... i think ive unpacked something I didn’t know i had
Im somewhat sad that i kinda didn’t really get to enjoy much out of my childhood because I had to spend a large portion of it acting mature
Although it shall be an extremely stressful road to take... goddam conservative asians
Hopefully soon I will become dependent on E so🤞
One thing you need to know is you need to participate too.
My mental fortifications just get weaker and weaker
Do I keep walking until im too battered to even speak up of my burdens and pains
I have to let it pass because all I can do is vent, and im starting to be fatigued even doing that
And waiting hurts
I want to get out of this pit of an extremely low mood, but all I can do is wait
How does sleep have an effect?
Blind eye, sorry
People kinda forgot that people like Chris Brown kinda almost killed someone. The public in general are somewhat forgetful
Nice
How long have they been growing
I’ll hopefully book my appointment tomorrow so hype for the private sector!
Ara <:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
Im hoping to get at least basa myself :p
I know ^_^
Like on the futch scale sword?
Nice!
Oooo
But yeah i send you hugs
Like the most valid reason at a base level is “I don’t want to live there anymore”
So what do yall think about “i only just disagree that you are gay”
And also i can get some advice or something at least if im doing it here
I want to vent it out a bit so i dont go to sleep bottling it
My sleep cycle has been a mess recently
Its 11:50
Sorry if this seems jumbly
And I speak mainly about extended family, but that shitstorm still targets my close family
And shes no stranger to family harassing her
My mum currently isnt financially independent due to a lot of bad luck
And I sadly don’t have the luxury of being as selfish as I want to be
Currently I’m living with family
And throughout all of this I might get exposed anyway
I might get to uni and I won’t be able to medically transition privately
Maybe I fail to get into uni and im stuck for another year of having to pretend to be something im disgusted to be
It *might* get better for ne
Im so tired of being beaten mentally and being caged up
Its a path i never asked to walk
Ahead of me is a long, treacherous path which might not even have payoff
Theres a lot of them, and taking one out will do damage to me
My somewhat weird friend put it in the metaphor as hooks in my body, this bloody family
My mental health would at the minimum be a bit better with hormones
Can’t take hormones right now if I could because family
I need good grades for that, but im slipping cause of my mental health
My one route of escape is uni
Thats why im somewhat despair if that makes sense
Hell I haven’t come out. I know they aren’t going to be great
Thank you new blood <<33
Despair is the word im looking for
So yea for reasons listed above and way more I feel kinda mega shit now
One weird quote was that I had to “accept my family’s interpretation of the quoran”
God forbid i say for example interpret it in my own way
Im tempted to “keep ties” with them out of spite and let them hang from their own rope
I have lessened confidence that any of my family will be open to me being trans
Because a person is more than gay and stuff, but as long as they aren’t doing the gay around us
I got a bit of that
Omg that saki tho
But they wont “show hatred”
But yeah the underlining message is that they have gay friends and would be friends with them, but their religious beliefs forbid gay sex
“First of all, theres no scientific evidence that anyone is born gay”
Spicy quote
God it’s finally over
The idea that they wont believe us *if* we are gay but if we were in hospital they would come and help us
I am just supporting my cousin in this
They believe gay sex is forbidden but they are saying that they can still be friends and accept gay people
Me and my cousin vs the old generation
Sorry, im kind of in the middle of a somewhat heated family debate
I mean im autistic
Apparently hes a shit councillor at that too
No it was council
Or was it MP
But his dad I believe ran for the council here
Not really
Im hoping he doesn’t remember im trans because he could do serious damahe to me if he leaks that to my family
Then again maybe he does still think of me as a dude
I believe he still uses male pronouns for me but thats fine because im not fully out in school
And I am *not* comfortable telling him hes a toxic prick
But he is determined for an answer from me as to why I dont speak to him anymore
Basically why I don’t speak to him anymore
Although I wouldn’t be surprised if he said he hates Symphogear now out of hatred of me
He watches anime in general
Regretfully I wasn’t there for it
Oh yea he got *banned*
He is, in my opinion, the epitomy of everything that is wrong in asian islamic culture right now. A sexist, homophobic wanker who thinks hes above everything
He was banned
Ah yes you are newer. Vali is an irl friend of mine who joined here
A good friend of mine who is quite confrontational kinda went up to him today and was like “bitch why you be like this nobody likes you”
He was apparently making enemies this very morning, calling someone “lower class scum”
He tried to gaslight the other people mentioned before while i was sitting *at the table with the other person* and now im home because its probably gonna escalate and I do not have the emotional energy for that
So update on irl Vali.
On Thursday apparently he called me a faggot when referring to me to other people
Honestly if I had to pick Ver or Vali...
By upping his shit talking about me game
Well Vali has successfully driven away his *last* “friend” at school
Haha ive never done that befor
That one was more grieving i feel
That did a number on me
I had a minor scare a while ago when like i lost 3,000
Pretty sure my addictive nature and this are related
Fanart yea
Don’t even know if it’s healthy or unhealthy
Only a year in I realised there was a reason I was saving anime girls onto my phone
God... its been like 2 years since I’ve started this thing
<:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
Huh, I thought it was mainly romantic
Unless you were referring to the Phantom Thieves, were you not saying I am after you romantically?
The heart is an organ associated with romance
*girl after my own heart*
Also kerrik *ara ara*
Exactly
With some extremely rare exceptions
Although tbh i have it muted anyway cause i dont save lewds as principle
No wfc, im not allowed to *speak* in the nsfw channel
When its 2019 im 18
17
Hes pissed off the wrong people
Things have been somewhat accelerated
Vali has gone full abuser tactics of gaslighting and denial that hes done anything wrong.
It would work if my friends weren’t **fucking morons like he thinks they are**
Wasnt this the same say you joined?
Hana you heard me, the saki egg crack story :D
Also sketch I am like... way more experienced then i give myself credit I think
Hana tell us the story about how you smashed sakis egg
She loved both of us too muxh and we both were like sure whatever
My girlfriend who is in this discord has another girl
I am in a Poly relationship
Yes
I believe Hana thew your egg at a wall or something
I was somewhat there
Yes
I then accidentally came out myself while doing it
Like i was also telling the school my gf was trans because she told me “i know I can’t do it can you”
Don’t get me wrong though, coming out was hard
No we dont, norenche is new
What saki said
Yea
I was never in doubt that they had my back if that makes sense
Ill be honest I never thought of that at all
Like I got quite a lot of fashion advice which is nice
Oh the whole trans thing? I mean I had already told most if not all of the people in this tale
But yea like im just a nervous wreck cause things happened
And a3 is way closer friends to me then he is to Vali
Nor my gf’s gf
Like for example I knew my gf wasnt going to be manipulated to hate me
They’ve had my back from the very beginning
Eh
I knew they would, but still
I know
The storming in part was mentally embellished after talking to a3 but everything else is true



With permission from my friend who’s better with words, here is the recent events happening to me summed up
Everyone kinda hates him now. Before it was just “urgh ok” but now its pure we dont like you
Hope he is IP banned lets put it that way
But yeah I imagine this vali thing will get worse
Im not attacking the writing just the person if that makes sense
But i strongly hate Ver
He is an amazinf character yes
But i would rather spend hours with him then Vali
I *hate* Ver (as a person)
*kyouko* said hi to me thats how okd
But dam... 1 year on this discord in like a month
Thats how I get in a loootta trouble
When I speak IRL i use quite a lot of slang because in my brain if it makes sense to me it makes sense period
Im having a mental conundrum that ive been here more than saki
While I took a small server vacation
Then lat got modded
Cause you did some shit posts
You were a storm coming in saki :p
That was nice
I remember Rukia giving me a looot of art
I joined end of December
God its been nearly a year I spent here
Zolg! I wonder if he’s still active
Past me was a fuckin idiot
But I remember when my gf came out i asked her a lot about her dysphoria because (i know in hindsight) that I wanted to see if i was dysphoric
I don’t even properly remember how my egg cracked
Gomenasorry
Was all of Vali’s comments purged?
Something about chromosomes?
Vali was saying transphobic shit on here
Saki apparently
Tldr basically
Vali is.... toxic former frend
So yea vali is a big poop head and i want tits please thanks
Pretty sure this is the most lgbtq+ mod team for a general anime discord :p
No idea actually
And now Hana lurks, waiting for more eggs to crack
About right
And then *she speedran transitioning*
But in any case
Sorry, i didnt realise thats what you were doing
<@!102691114762371072> i didnt mean to disregard whats happened in America but im talkin about the UK and how we could possibly end up with no deal brexit and you brought up America. Like I know its bad in America but its also not exactly shiny in uk either
So now she has a minority in parliament
The DUP nut jobs who were keeping the government in a majority stopped backing May
She is hanging on her job out of *spite*
Parliament unilaterally condemned it
3 weeks ago
May revealed her brexit plan
This is i feel much worse
No no no
THINGS KEEP GETTING MORE FUCKED
WEVE BEEN FUCKED FOR 3 WEEKS NOW
**its fucked**
Apocalyptically...
No no
Absolutely catastrophically....
Whats the word
Saki. Parliament is... hmm
Things broke down like 2 weeks ago
https://youtu.be/dVbC0jASJYA
Nice video i watched about the UK 2017 election
*which I haven’t started at all*
I was thinking “but she will be in my novella”
My novella
Shit
Although last I remember shes unconscious in a  bed having lost a game of hot potato with a grenade sooo
That sniper better fucking suck it up
Ever since I stole my tabletop characters name I never looked back
Yuup
ibu = mom in Indonesian
Suure
My dead nickname is apparently the Indonesian name for mother
Don’t know if ive ever mentioned this buuut
Night!
Well you are like 7-8 hours behind me
Ah yea time zones
Was it really Christmas eve?!
Can someone check when I joined
Oh yea sorry saki
You mean kro?
Wonder what Valk is like now
Zesshoued her
She’s dead now
Ok im gonna sleep tho, i cant do politics at 1 am
Filibuster my favourite
Unless it was relevant
But never in parliament would you ever get something like someone using debate time on a bill to talk about their constituents
Especially like with the house
A non neutral speaker is interesting to see in Congress tho
I can get that sentiment, but I think theres a reason that pork barreling and ear marking trend existed or exists to this day
Its like if John Burkow, speaker of the house, and his merry men who honestly i dont even think have names chose what was debated
Its not the entire legislative body. Its the majority who has the committee seats
Like hell if a bill isnt given the time to be debated even
Listen, the house of lords cant kill a bill by *ignoring it*
Congress is haram 🐖
And also learned about pork barrelling
and that was his contribution to the debate
HE HAD A PROP OF HIS PICTURE
Like how he was a great guy
Like some congressman spent his minute of talkin time speaking about a cop
And we watched like a debate on a finance bill or something
Good lord... 90% of bills get killed off
In the US
Or rather how law making works
Btw I learned how Congress works today
Rep get more senators seats
Mid term results is dems took the house
Mid terms?
Which Labour basically managed to pass most if not all of their amendments to
That was I believe finances
I just want to lie in bed and fade away right now
3-4
10 December they start
Pre Public Exams
And I’ve basically bunked the rest of this day because its too much
I have PPEs before that
Why does my life have to be like this
I’m so tired of feeling both numb and feeling like absolute shit sometimes
Because my family is extremely unlikely to be supportive
I have to pick out which uni I go too and *then* get good enough grades that I can pass the exams
Most likely I may have to wait until September for hormones because stopping and starting is obviously bad but also the risk of being caught out
He’s only part of the jigsaw which is making my mood tank
Vali seems to want me to admit that to him or something
I mean we don’t interact anyway these days
Its just a big mess of shit that’s been building up
It’s not just that though
Vali is someone in my school year and in my CS classes
Thinking about the future sucks. Thinking as a whole sucks. Everything is more complicated then it needs to be
Hour later and I feel like a massive mess
Who thinks that driving everyone away from him is “a win”
Even if he claims to not be aggressive and violent, I don’t feel comfortable with someone who called me a faggot
Vali man...
The appointment went ok. Sadly im an anxious wreck for other reasons
“GenderGP” is the private hormones service in the uk
Basically the stepping stones for hormones for me
Gp is short for doctor in uk
Bout to make my first phone appointment with the private gender gp people
The sooner I get into uni is the sooner i can leave this shitty household and start medically transitioning
Im in a low enough state that I don’t think I would mind if it was your place to say or not
No, but its too late to change it
Cs is extremely hard for me and I hate it
Cs business and politics
I was gonna do politics at uni
Stuff like the computer science project i was trying to work on
Its hard enough I can barely focus on work outside of lessons
The problem with working hard now is that every day it’s been getting harder and harder to do so
The outside world is scary enough as is
Ill stick with tabletop
My first CS and part time Business teacher was horrendous. The second one is ok but i think the class is just done with CS because of teacher one
The physics he did teach us I don’t think was even in the exam board
“Curation” or something like that
His 3rd lesson he started doing a really bad English lesson
I once had a physics teacher who most likely lied about his skills as a physics teacher
Ah the joys of teachers
Thats why we gotta be better then suck \o/
People do indeed suck
hoo boy
Hmm, larping might be interesting if I could voice train
The criticism isn’t the underwear looks a bit odd, its that there be camel toes for some reason
See what I mean gamer. The use of sjw is to attempt and portray valid criticism as something loud and toxic
Knowing pubg it would be core to the guns working
Now thats a fun title...
The thing is with that is people will say that even if the response is justified
Depends on the circumstances
Sure there are fascist that are in the right wing but most them just conservatives or centrists
Like calling anything remotely right wing fascist
I still have fond memories of being called an SJW for calling someone out for victim blaming a rape victim. SJW isnt a group at this point. Its something to dismiss opinions you disagree with
Thats why people think its loud
People keep saying its loud
Also that
Yes but don’t associate the loud minority with the entire group
Its a boogieman
Ive faced more transphobes than i have “sjw”
Its hyped up like mad but i think realistically
Im not exactly sold on the “sjw” being a bigger thing then it actually is
Hoo boy
99% of trans peeps are just gonna say “im actually this could you use that instead” rather than getting mad. We have too much depression to fight beyond that
Wish I learned more than de nada
I love Spanish
Which is why you can’t bend time
Yea, he’s getting mixed up with sex and gender
He cant lie and say hes 20 applying for life insurance
Hell something for him, life insurance
A smug prick who instead of actually understanding trans people, decides to equate it to age.
Not enough “ for point
His “point” is “people can’t change their gender just as I can’t change my age” 
Walnut he is
Both of the political parties kinda want to leave
Remain has no leader
And these days the argument is that its un democratic to against the i initial referendum results
On the left and the right
Some of these people genuinely still think that Brexit is a good idea
The worst part is not all of these leave voters are racist
We’ve had 2 years to destruct pretty much most if not all “benefits” that leaving the EU will bring ua
I imagine not anymore
Why tho? Why even bother
And now that I am aware, im questioning the devs if they are adding in stuff like this rather than making their game playable
I bet I could go out with tits and female presenting clothes and still get dead named
Everything kinda sucks
Its fine, just gah
Yea im not sure whether im mentality feeling better or worse
<@106861977086779392> im not a man
Honestly im not sure whats worse the sexism id face if i was born an asian woman or the anguish i feel right now
Why wasnt i born a girl ima like beat up god whenever i meet the twat
Urgh speaking of body dysphoria i hate myself
They dream of scotland?
Cant have body dysphoria if you don’t have a body
Look just put me in a robot ok i can dream forever
Multi track serious discussion is amazing
Being found in contempt is **huge**
She must release all of it to parliament
Until then, may **cannot** withhold any of the legal advice she had
Next week
Brexit: Full legal advice to be published after contempt vote http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-46446694
Im gonna.. go play Skyrim and listen to music
I don’t even know if I will be on hormones during my a levels or not
But thats UCAS for you. I need to figure out what university i go to so i know what grades i need to aim to achieve
I’m currently mentally havjng a break down about the far far future and right now
I cant think backup plans right now
But I’ve struggled extremely hard to focus outside of lessons so I’ve not been able to study pretty much at all for the mock exams next week
Means I have to do well in exams
My exit strategy is make it to University
<@99695384296701952> its a bit more than that. Self discovery is a large part of it yes but also in terms of just my way of thinking
If I get exposed as 
>bi
>trans
>not muslim
>in a relationship with a trans girl
to my family that would suck a lot
I would call them extremely poisonous vines
I wouldn’t call these thorn bushes
Its remarkable how little I think that one slip up could have the potential to completely change my life and not likely in a good way
Im always scared that something is going to push me in though
Ive already seen the bottom. I don’t exactly want to visit there again
Thats fair
If it were possible we would perpetually cuddle
My gf is biased tho, she and I love eachother to shit
Like i think my mind has expanded more this year than any other year
This year has been so much
And ofc im going to be stuck with a joystick for a very long time considering the circumstances
My girlfriend likes to tell me that my body physique is pretty feminine but honestly I don’t understand what she sees in me
Every time I look down i see a fuckton of body hair which I can’t shave on the off chance someone in my family notices
My eyebrows are thick as shit and almost make a monobrow but I really doubt ill be able to shape them without drawing attention to myself
Currently I look boyish as much as i hate it. My hair is long enough that some cunts in my family are trying to “tease me for looking female” while not being long enough to do anything with it and still looking make
I see
I wasn’t talking about my past, i was thinking about how we are likely heading towards cliff edge brexit because of some bruised egos
Doubt ill be able to move as easily if this country decides to actually set itself on fire
I could technically be a year on hormones if i started the process now privately. Next year is my *first nhs appointment*
NHS for hormones is an actual depressing joke
Privately
At least i can *maybe* start hormones in 4 months
If they mention family bring up the more intimate details about making a family
With that, i think ideas flow more, even with the whole hiveminds that happen
Like i can talk to yanks from separate coasts, someone from south africa, some europeans and some asians in one vc if i pushed it
We kinda live in a world we’re *extremely* connected around the world
However it’s important to note a few things
As things are going to get worse for us before they get better. The climates still *dying* and tensions in the world seem to be bubbling up more and more
In the grand scheme of things, there is this world rule that things get worse before they get better
However individually that will kinda suck for us
*do you hear the people sing?*
<@!246146781832806401> if this person was interested in you, they wouldn’t care how you look. I think honestly just like ask for her number. You actin so negative when you aint even heard what she thinks ya kno?
Because it will be <:GenjuurouThumbsUp:336657189475188740>
Aww wfc i jusr wana like hug you and say its gonna be daijobu
I expect that of a 5 year old
I can’t fathom *throwing up* at someone
Unless it was a coincidence that she was simultaneously sick just after you confessed, she twas a bit of a but
When she threw up because you had the audacity to show your interest in her
Forgive me if i have trouble believing you
She let her mask slip, and you got to see the demon behind it
like that girl would have never made you happy
I think with that you gotta think positive
Sounds like you dodged a bullet
I can’t really speak much since my gf basically confessed while I was planning on keeping it to myself
If she says no, it means you can move on e z
Super sensei wfc <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
Isn’t your job interacting with students?
You just have to explain how i hit you up ^_^
If i ever come to japan i will def hit you up
Hey, you have us at the very least
Depends on the court, although that looks like a firm cant pardon
Basically this scenario would most likely trigger a constitutional crisis
Notice how Europe is the dark continent but the UK is fine in Symphogear?
<@456226577798135808> i think you’re on to something
LiZ HeLp
And lets be honest theres no leave voter calling for a peoples vote.
Thats the argument it is
There is a genuine argument against a second referendum. That it would be un democratic due to the first elections result
You mean lack thereof syn :D
She effectively has a 200 mp government
I mean like I said she would in another circumstance resign from this
Yes
So we may get a vote of no confidence
In *any* other circumstances the PM would resign. Those results are very bad for a sitting pm to have
Theresa May survives confidence vote http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-46547246
Might end up with a parliamentary no confidence vote :p
Theresa May to face vote of no confidence from Tory MPs http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-46535739
May got 4 less
She resigned
Thatcher in her leadership challenge received 204 votes
Just for context by the way
Except the UK think they the stronger ones
EU negotiations in a nutshell
And with a hard brexit we have 3 world powers looking to make us theirs
Thats what I told him
My recently tory convert friend thinks that the uk will *possibly* come out better after brexit and that if we stopped the process now we would be “the EUs bitch”
Too many people are putting their head in the sand of the consequences of this
It will me a miracle if we even get a say on the deal
That its going against the will of the people
Too many people believe that its in democratic
As much as I want it to
This is the argument that is presented and is why I strongly doubt a peoples vote will ever come into fruition
I didnt *literally mean reroll*
About how voting isnt a random process
I... know?
I don’t agree with this, im just pointing out the arguments people I know make
But you are falling into the territory of “rolling until you get the result you wanted”
Indeed
how were they able to do that?
As in hormones or social transition?
Would a credit/debit card with contactless survive a washing machine
Or has it changes over
Aren’t you still in the lame duck period?
Yup
Better the tories are divided then all hack at a figure head
They all swing to may
If he lashes out against may or marginalise Labour leave voters
And politically, corbyn i think has made an ok play
I strongly doubt we get mays deal
It is unlikely we will get an opposition government before we hard brexit anyway
Because they don’t understand how this works
I saw people on /r/uk said they would vote lib dem. They mean good but i also want to throttle them
Well theres no alternative
But god im a little sick of seeing that pop up every time j speak up about the campaign
Im not denying they lied
But yea remain lied too so its fine
Beyond shady as fuck
Shady as fuxk
Thats
I saw an article recently about how we still arent fully sure who funded the brexit campaign
And had way more impact
Im sorry but one campaign lied *way worse*
It was hazy at the start due to the massive amount of lies from the leave campaign
^
sleep is hard
Would I still be dating my gf if I told her I loved her 2 months before she told me
Then going through my own discovery on who I am
Would I be the same girl if i was told on January 1st that i am a trans girl
Which events are the ones that are resl
After that... is what you remember even real?
Knowing what people could turn into, do you let them stay that course and let things resolve as they should? Or do you risk changing what you remember
It feels heavy. Like yea I can do some stuff earlier but at what cost to myself and to others
I think if you told me at the beginning of this year that I was both trans and going out with the trans girl I know I would be in disbelief. But at the same time... i dunno its a really weird feeling
I think id do that to everyone I know
I dunno... id ask if you believe me for starters
If i was thrown back
I would dm you the minute I could
Saki I would be perfectly honest
Like theres a layer to this irrational fear im feeling rn
I wonder a bit if it’s deeper than that
And yet... I can’t sleep
It seems so weird to be this scared of something that would probably never happen
What if i do the whole year again and it repeats again
Like by telling someone I change events that happen and thus I end up going from slightly knowing what will happen to not knowing
Would anyone believe me if I told them? Even if they did, repeating am entire year seems hellish
I have this.... wouldn’t call it a nightmare cause im not asleep but a reoccurring thought which scares me.
What if i fall asleep December 31st and wake up Jan 1st 2018
No real way to check without spending cash :/
If you need to take a break take a break
Quite a bit
I would
Its pretty dam useful
I think being able to analyse and break down situations and problems like that is a talent of its own
Ill try
Ive never been good at that
And homework... well
I’m really bad at going through what i went though in class
Its weird. I can only really focus on learning when im in class
Its just i find it extremely hard to focus on work these days
See i know that
I wish i had the work ethic to do that
Ditto
<a:dAnce:398454583170695209>
On the opposite side of speed running im actually somewhat close to a year of me realising i was trans
Just phrasing it horribly
Im pushing it, but maybe they are thinking the decision to be out?
So about them lgbtq rights ey?
It is your feelings. We have no right to judge what course you take
At the end of the day
We can’t really speak for you. All we can say is that the server would feel more quiet and that i believe all of us would miss you
The server will definitely feel a bit more... empty with your absence
Or calling cops fat pigs
Like going to a black community and shouting hard r n word
*iT hUrTs mEe*
This place cracked a large part of my egg so gay is good
:////
“Its not even proven people are born gay”
Legit
And that is one of my distant uncles
He claims to be “friends with gay people”
But also
Imagine this guy
See
Cause id love to know when it comes to me and my family
And by who?
Do their opinions ever change
That guy
It makes me wondee
That sounds cool
I broke out of my egg by sacrificing goats
Sad thing is he will probably find *somewhere* which will facilitate him
Be against gay cause religion but also waifu the mc cause <:MichaWhat:336657148627124225>
That guy pretty much epitomises my family
FPTP is a joke
right now, it would be a bit more problematic
when the nation was basically rebuilding itself
i think starting back up made more sense after something like world war two
something which has been unfairly imo beaten up quite badly
the thing is how would we even fix something like the nhs
during that parts of it was privatising parts
and because of that its gotten into a mess it is now
the thing is with the nhs is that the tories have been quietly defunding it for about... 9 years lets say
sure im getting less money but at least if i get stabbed or something im not losing cash cause of that
well personally i think that money isnt going to waste. especially for something like healthcare
i think soon we are gonna see a bat to the left
politics is always pinging back and forth to a degree
https://twitter.com/britainelects/status/1080895066275831809
was gonna listen to more music and write but i ended up watching all of this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91_5OOmK1TQ
from trains to trans
mind if i derail slightly <:smug:469593451973967872>
they stop giving a shit about quality and care more about making money
its what happens when they run for profit
nationalise the rail <:jezza:317651257223282691>
Not just that. Might cause some gatekeeping
^
Theres a weird air of gatekeeping
Its not just waiting times
Thing is with the uk
I dunooo
And then i wait for an appointment
I think it means I send some stuff i need to sign to them
<:NotLikePapika:284132078054932480> aaaaaaaaaa
A whole 11 months before I thought i would
Ive been accepted to thr nhs gender identity clinic
Just got a letter today
Ahabrhais fea
watch these elected officials shout like monkeys when someone is trying to speak
pmqs are <:Omegalul:518767109346558002>
oh yea interuptions can be common
its amazing
i need to watch/listen to more debates
basically the debate is hilarious for someone like me
should i copy paste more interesting stuff from this debate or naaah
weird.. that got sent out of order
yea you *cannot* refer to someone as just their name
you cannot say *theresa may*
the mp from st albans, the prime minister
or the honourable lady
while calling someone the honourable gentleman
but yea parliament itself is just finding the polite way to basically verbally shit on someone
you know i got that video after i watched *contrapoints*
that was former snp mp Ahmed-Sheikh
'' "I welcome the debate today and the thoughtful contributions that have been made so far. Addressing inequality wherever it lies, benefits us all, and we must not be hypocritical in that regard. If we believe in equality, it must be equality for everybody. So I do take issue with the hon. Member for Shipley, who voted consistently against equal gay rights and against laws to promote equality and human rights. I note that today he has watered down his comments from last year somewhat. He said today, “I want to be very clear that I do not believe there is actually an issue between men and women and that people try to be politically correct.” Last year, he said:

“I do not believe there is actually an issue between men and women. Often, problems are stirred up by those who might be described as militant feminists and the politically correct males who sometimes pander to them.”

He added:

“One of the most depressing things to happen recently was the introduction of the Select Committee on Women and Equalities.”—[Official Report, 19 November 2015; Vol. 602, c. 242WH.]

What a disservice to this Parliament. As if that was not enough, on Second Reading of the Equality and Diversity (Reform) Bill in 2011, he said:

“It is a massive step towards inequality for men, and the poor souls just let the women walk all over them. They do not appear to care what will happen to them.”—[Official Report, 21 October 2011; Vol. 533, c. 1195.]

At the international conference on men’s issues in 2016, he talked about

“equality but only when it suits”.

In that respect, I say to him, “Right back at you.” ''
id be in awe
if i was in the viewing gallery
and expressed distaste when issues concerning womens rights are brought up
this person has voted against gay rights
another mp points out
later on
the person who raised the motion is Philip Davies of the constituency of Shiply. He is a tory
https://hansard.parliament.uk/Commons/2016-11-17/debates/A15D6059-16D9-4143-917A-076A51A71482/InternationalMen%E2%80%99SDay
sorry ill link it, but be warned it is *very* boring
jeesus christ i can *feel* this debate being hot and stuff. and im only reading the transcript
all i could find was a debate in 2017 in the commons
sorry had a bit of a search
depends what the committee was called
if it was a committee then there would probably be an achive on the parliament website
no
and for me right now, i can for sure feel the pains of mental health in the nhs
call it what it is, i think thats basically what ive become now
how would this affect trans people
these days now im usually one issue
i think over the two years ive done politics, ive kinda morphed quite a lot
Into hyper computer sim
Im more a dyson sphere kinda gal
I can be what i want
Put me in a computer
Like “what if x was to do this?!” kinda fears
And they use similar arguments to shut down conversation
That these are the kinds of people who way back then would argue against desegregation
I remember hearing a point on it which is somewhat relevant
Quick question, anybody see the video I linked a day or two ago?
Bi people get some hate too gor some reason
Hatred is weird
They want people on their side. Just not *those* people

Make a Symphogear
Burn the terfs

Give you some comfort hugs
Heck i dont mind using my future national train card to go say hi to you
You have all of us for thr next 3 years
Cause it will
I wish i had met up with you so i could hug you and say it will be ok
For me
Can you close the window
Like. Heck I basically realised i was trans here
Sketch biig mood
Gnite
Guess ill shelve dysphoria for when I wake up
I just wana be a girl
And it hurts
But i cant release that gay
I feel soooo... gay
Stop my brain from being depressed
I should
Its 4 am and im working 12-6
Why was I born lime this <:BikkiSad:391790930967134208>
They kinda hyped it up
I was autistic so when I showed i was smart in primary school
Happened to me I think
why wouldnt you be allowed to say it here?
Why is feeling valid hard sometimes
That’s too much
And also tiddies
Cats and cows come off as submissive to me
Cow girls
Mechanical brain is good
Yea be a cat girl
In vr I can be soft and squish
Fuckin transphobes
I know how that feels
Being human makes me tired
Like my reaction to school is internal screaming and strong anxiety about my lack of productivity
We can control somewhat how we act tho
I don’t think we as humans get to control what and how we feel personally
If it wasnt for discord I would have turned completely insane. This is my best outlet to express who i truly am
Still stuck with body hair I can’t shave lest my family find out
Until then my life is gonna trudge along, no different to months ago and it not changing any time soon
I have an appointment next week with my doctor which will involve me signing consent forms to send to the GIC
Oh yea rakhi i know your sick and feel nauseous but you know looking at that anime girl more closely I think we are sexually attracted to her. What do you mean you only wanted to wear their outfit?! Well tough shit I already deployed the horny drugs so suck it up
I really can’t wait for the day my sex drive has less of a grasp on my life
<a:Hug:530477382142787594> we all listenin to you mate
Maybe they think its worser then it actually is?
But you also still use it
You know if you told a black person that they are n word you aint exactly walking away 100%
If he knows that much, why say it in the first place
Cauae hed get beaten up
Like, the fuck is going on in your head
I never get people who are openly racist like that
But she really hates black people
You’d think she would know about racism
Like born in Bangladesh asian
Someone who is asian
See weird thing is my nan is also pretty racist
Thats genius
get some rest <a:Hug:530477382142787594>
what happened
You know just cause im studying politics doesn’t mean I’ll have to actually do politics after uni
It could make 200% more and I wouldn’t care
Idc, CS isn’t my thing
Aim for a C in CS
Politics at uni
I stumbled on it and I can’t get out till a few months
I was never on the path
Pff
<a:Hug:530477382142787594>
You mean dxd lite?
He just thinks that its not bad if you use it around the people your using derogatory language about
He knows its racist
People are dumb
And im a terrorist <:waturr:286761153630044160>

Well vote of no confidence soon
The left discord im in are for brexit, but for their own reason
But sure
Its not like its a binary system where if you say capitalism bad you are automatically communist <:yayakaShrug:286284426541924352>
Where money is worth more than lives
We can say modern day capitalism as practiced right now is pretty not good
*capitalism*
Thats what archaeologists look back to when they see what the absolute shit went wrong
The root of the problem is education and the media I think
But yea.... people suck
Theres an anarcho communist and also (used to be) one really right person
Oh for sure
And not in a healthy way
A person i know in my politics class has recently bitten down the tory pill
Yep
*but its #undemocratic*
MPs voting on the brexit deal right now
Yeeeet
We can take back our fishing
Fishing
There is a left wing brexit because the EU is neo liberal
Theres stances which are leave will kick the immigrants out
And all of those 3 have different elements depending on how much research youve put in
Theres leaving but not really
Theres complete leaving
Theres remaining
Trump will just have to McDelivery
So the math *roughly* adds up to a, whoda thunk it, a majority
Want a tory government
Surprisingly
And the tories
Thats a fact of political life in the UK
DUP hate labour more than tories
She survive the VoNC?
definitely if we go no deal
maybe if the british people give a shit there will be riots
but yea brexit is bad
i find talking about politics in general im more constrained
you can go much more ham here
considering the topic *is* politics
plus
no reason to clog up general with heavy political discussion
yea but it needs to happen
As little as that sounds
Pretty similar to what happened with saki weeks ago. We don’t know much f anything so all we can say is... we are here?
Well we cant exactly offer much of anything except our ears
Are they doing that here?
Well im sure they had their own reasons for departing. Whatever they were. 
Have you tried reporting this harrassment to discord themselves or nah?
They are targeting you because of how the server is structured as a save haven or something different?

What will become of me, of someone who has endured this much and finally reaches the end.
When it hurts so much and the pain doesn’t have an end in sight
Im so tired of hurting
But ontop of that i also get to be born in the wrong body. In a poor family which meant I had to grow up fast. In a family which has a hardon for tradition which is why they spend their time loudly slinging shit at eachother with little care for what damage they cause in the process
My life has been a barrage of pain mixed with false moments of sanctuary. I don’t know what specific issue it is but I have a really dam hard time accepting help and asking for it because I don’t want to be a burden. Maybe it’s trust issues. I feel as if i ever expose my heart out it will get hurt. Which isn’t supported by the fact that my heart is sensitive enough to begin with
Kinda like rn
It hits harder in the night when i lie down and try to sleep
Not in this mindset no
Its like a vile cauldron of dark emotions swirling deep in my soul, deep within the confines of my mind and consciousness
I’m... not even fully sure how much of this mood is dysphoria
How long can I keep going like this feasibly
I want this sinking feeling of despair to just go away for once
And today is no different :(
I’ve been feeling pretty depressed recently
And almost killed 4 people
The project grew sentience
R never abandoned it
👀
I see that thing R was working on
Hmm... revolutionary is the right word I think
But a year here has been
I dunno if ive ever talked about this
I dunno
Spread communism in general?
I think people asked for it to be changed cause it felt weird to talk politics in nsfw discussion
At some point it was general chat and below it nsfw discussion
I know that much
No it wasnt always serious discussion
It was just art
Fuck right we havent always had an sfw and nsfw art channel
*its only been a year* <:NotLikePapika:284132078054932480>
I mean this place was changed *from* nsfw discussion
Wait
This place was changed to nsfw discussion
No no I remember
I think I remember when I joined and this place was called nsfw discussion was where you talked about this no?

Gah its just so much things thats been building up in my head
Many things are getting to me probably
Not being in a girls body is getting to me
Horray for waking up and feeling extremely depressed
I feel like I’ve earned that right
The last thing I want when I’m already in so much angst is more angst. Im allowed to be selfish like that no?
Hes like year 9
When I feel such extreme empathy for others
I can’t exactly control it
Caring too much isn’t
Caring is good
It cuts deep
And it hurts
But my heart still cares
I know this
It hurts cause I know it’s wrong. On a psychological level
Then she went on her usual “other people play on the play station longer than you, when (...) happens im cutting down your play time , if this happens again im throwing the ps4 out the window”
And part of my soul just cries hearing that, because I don’t exactly like guilting someone like that
And she was telling him off for over reacting. One thing that stuck to me was “what if we had to call an ambulance” if he had an asthma attack
The youngest has asthma problems
Something she just says things that I think go too far
I told her why and she gets pretty mad at youngest
He’s crying a lot, so mum asks what’s happening
Few minutes later my mum shouts at me to come down
He didn’t answer so I told him to stop playing and put the PlayStation back on rest mode
So i grilled him a bit, asking him firmly why he was playing on it even though I asked him not to
When we got home he was playing on it, and the update wasn’t close to being done
I told the youngest brother to leave the ps4 on rest mode so it could update some games
So i was clearing my old house today with my middle brother and mum
To a painful extent
I want to turn this part of me off that cares so much about other people
It hurts
I’m too empathetic
Those shit slinging cunts
Cause honestly fuck the asian community here
Any fallback I get my mum also gets
My mum is fine but she can only do so much
My gf’s family is ok but I wouldn’t lean on them for support
I’m aware
Who acts confused why a girl is called deadname
I’d love to be comatosed and wake up with new memories of someone who’s extremely perceptive
When I get into a car, I hope someone is dumb enough to crash
Part of me wishes I don’t wake up
Every day when I fall asleep
I would be losing probably 95% of my family
They would be too busy struggling to understand why I’m not muslim
I know damm well they won’t ever use my pronouns
They have many reasons to “not approve of me”
It’s scary to think that I am one misspoken words away from being rejected and orchestrated by my family
When most of me is desperately clinging to the hope that once I get on hormones I can use that to help push myself to be more healthy
Part of me is scared that I’ll start hormones and not like the results
I wish I could tell myself that and it would believe it
I know
Pretty much
I hate it
Which is dumb
More recently I’ve been getting thoughts about how im not trans cause im not dysphoric enough
And they are being stingy the cunts
I can change it’s just i need magic juice from the government
... I think you and I have different problems
That’s probably 80% of my depression
Id love to kick the door down to get hormones but that isn’t gonna happen for a while
Considering my deadline is a week and the only thing my bot can do is barely greet someone when prompted
I have a computer science coursework which just lets me view how dumb i am
Can’t do much about it cause the reason is I wasn’t born with an abundance of E flowing through my body to give be tits
Im depressed I know that
An empty husk of a body walking forward
Im barely living
Deep down im just tired of marching forward
It’s daunting to even try and vent about it because then I have to figure out what exactly is my problems
I feel a lot worse now. That’s always good
They are my tormentors
The consequences of my actions facing infront of me
My soul feels tormented by countless demons and I struggle to walk forward knowing more demons await me
I have to turn parts of my brain off to do that
That might be why im scared sometimes to accept help and things people offer me
I don’t expect favours. Im scared of thr part of me that does
Im hopefully gonna use that space to hormones it ip
If i dont fuck up my exams
Goin to uni in September

More or less
No rewards for being a “good” person
Asian community
Uk
Doesn’t help i find it so hard to ask help for stuff
It affects me **so much**
It feels like I have a x100 multiplier when i do someone harm in a way
I don’t exactly want that either
Till I can’t feel fuck all
Or have I got to suffer more for that
I was told it was but i don’t believe them
And im not fully sure if it’s correctly done
Its draining
And i have to figure out how im wording that
I know ive felt a bit pained while coding cause i have to take screenshots of everything I do and describe what im doing
Its just extremely fuckin fustrating
I took the weekend off from work. I know now that I shouldn’t have bothered
But... life got in its way
Like... ive been really busy all week. Initially i set monday aside and was planning on spending the rest of the week on working on i
Toast did
Being depressed doesn’t feel like a valid reason for not completing it
any other person probably could have done it
I cant help but be
Considering I spent today working on it and made very little progress to my extreme frustration which im trying to not let to me
Speaking of school mine starts back up tomorrow. And im gonna have to build up the confidence to tell my CS teacher that im can’t work on the project.
Cause i was reading “advanced” books
Like I remember the school was amazed about my reading skill
I feel like it wasn’t the greatest thing to put it lightly
Is it bad for me to bitch about me being considered really smart when I was young?
#transmenaremen
And FtM are traitors or something :s
I was reminded of her terf video so i was like “might as well”
Same
https://youtu.be/AQPWI7cEJGs oh yea contra points exists
Hmm whats the best way to describe them over than dogs
Terfs being terfs
Uk has a terf problem :s
These kinds of articles don’t exactly clear up the misunderstanding
A lot of people have an out dated view on trans people:s
Also this is not an uncommon view on the uk depressingly
Its a governers opinion posted as an article on the bbc website
Uk sucks http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-47359692
A lot of my love and heart belongs here because yall are super amazing people
Yall are really nice thank you a lot
For spouting some extremely toxic shit
They got banned
It is someone i know irl and joined here
Nah
I have no idea what he is talking about here
Listen your reaction is similar to mine
This is about how close I am to discord people
According to vali thats whats happening <:yayakaShrug:286284426541924352>
The two gems

A narcissist cuntbag
God what a fuck head
And also now my autism is apparently a get out of jail free card
“Trump card”
The way he phrased knowing im trans
Apparently i had laughed at him when he was banned here
He then also forgot a massive argument between him and ny gf where he went far enough that my gf ended up cutting
Why i was absolutely paranoid of him when he was acting a bit cuntish
And he wonders why they started being concerned for me
But he won’t because “he wont sink to my level”
That he knows he could **end my fucking life by outing me**
This fuckstick admitted to saying to some of my friends
Because you and i are close but not him and i so im a horrible person
<@!263983345669505025> apparently we are steam library sharing now
Fucking cuntbag had a bit of a vent at my gf last night
Urgh fuck vali
You have proof shes bein a shit
How they gon defend against that
Evidence of her being shit to you?
Sparkle means good. I can see where you are coming from. Problem comes when you aren’t raised by “parents” though
<a:aaaaaaaaa:399430015164481537>
i have an appointment with the GIC
got a letter
this day is good now
dont even know who valistiri is <:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
<3
*hey kerrik wana share steam libraries?*
I dont know what he went by
vali lucifer i think
I know that too well
If no deal is gonna be the outcome after wards
Why should they even bother with an extension
What the current government wants is a no deal to brexit which also has EU bonuses
Im gon be honest. Even if the EU wants a deal, they know it’s extremely unlikely
1. No fucking way they giving us 2 additional years let alone more then that
2. How the tories used that time was an absolute fucking disgrace
Fuxk we would’ve had more because we could trigger article 50 later
Of two bloody years
We had a long brexit deadline
I.. err would like to get off the mister bones wild ride
412 to 202
Extend the brexit deadline says parliament
Bet a fiver this lass is anti lgbt
Right now its a loophole used to prevent reasonable gun control in the name of the second amendment
I am aware of that. As it stands right now is the problem
Which is why we have to interpret the amendment
I know how its used now
I know why it was made
Right to bear arms is a pretty nice loophole
In its original state not really
Fix that constitution maybe
Maybe a nuclear reboot :s
Wouldn’t know where to start
Theres a lot of problems with America
Clearly that bit failed
To teach consumers to look for high quality stuff and whats worth money to them
I remember one of the things he argued for was consumer education
Hes on the £20 note
There was a philosopher who i sort of liked
I also see a weird argument that the sub prime mortgages that caused the financial crash in 2008 was “crony capitalism”
That was funny
Although misguided. Saw one argue segregation would have ended without government intervention
But they are surprisingly consistent
I really dont like them
American libertarians are an interesting bunch...
Thats my take of true economic freedom that we saw <:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
I remember listening to an explanation about non intervention in businesses and thinking “so this philosophy wouldn’t interfere with slavery as it is a profitable thing”
So a fuckton of teachers are in unions
Or say your pay gets frozen
Get that legal aid and stuff
But why wouldn’t you
You don’t reallt have to tho
Cause its extremely helpful
In the UK you are encouraged to join a union if you teach
Not enough regulation or failure to regulate is pretty shite though
And anti union from what ive gathered
Its quite privatisation
Or laizze faire government :s
I learned a bit about classical liberalism today
Speaking of ideology
No deal brexit could possibly kill her due to insulin shortages <:smug:469593451973967872>
May seems like shed rather die then give up the PM
Im glad you two have much optimism in our current government and the EU themselves

Its not great when a nutter shouts you out prior to mass murder
Probably
Christchurch shootings: 49 dead in New Zealand mosque attacks http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-47578798
40 ish?
Whats the deathtoll for NZ then
I mean total collapse
To big to fail was a jab at the us :D
Imagine that
America is too big to fail
Because you are actively facilitating the conditions needed for a crash
You are a danger to othwr drivers by driving 30 on te motorway
With cars speeding past you
So imagine going fucking 30 on the motor way
Yes
The motor way here has a speed linit of 60 ish iirc
Or around the speed limit anyway
Go at the speed limit, don’t be an obstacle to other drivers
I thought it was
That in itself is reckless driving no?
Yori are you talking about people driving like say 10mph on like a 40mph road?
https://youtu.be/yCxqdhZkxCo this be a super nice video
Not to mention my gf basically paid for the most recent ones because she wanted to
I don’t think im planning to get any more in the foreseeable future
Commissions are a bit different to what i was talking about
I got really dysphoric just now looking at some anchovy art
Im really starting to doubt the healthiness of saving anime fanart like this
https://mobile.twitter.com/BBCBreaking/status/1110958427692564481?s=09
https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-47725529
https://youtu.be/yCxqdhZkxCo <@!99522502811717632> this is thr vid i was talking about
because the centrist position for that topic is complex ofc
in even such centrist hive issues like "do trans peope exist and deserve rights."
and "centrist"
worst part is one of these people is a mod
ironically if they had watched the video a lot of their ""points"" would have zero weight
this is where they got peak offended
and transphobia
theres a really great video by philosophy tube which looks at the philosophy of trans people
\o/
but as soon as thats done ima fuckin yeet my ass outta that shithole
i would love to leave but theres something i must do first
these people in the past have called me a hypocrite because i said "yikes" to someone suggesting a straight pride day
the meme i posted was about how "normal awareness day" and something similar is toxic as shit
oh i feel like these people are transphobic but dont like being called transphobic xD
theres a server im on who has been getting *a little* quite offended by some of the trans related memes ive been posting there
happy trans awareness day!
i managed to offend people by posting trans memes wooo
Hes... hot
Philosophy tube is amazing. Ive discoverd him recently
https://youtu.be/Vr-ZeToI4R8 relevant video
Why cant my school be like this :f
Girls in suits 👀
It is definitely a step beyond they don’t exist. A step for the better or worse is another matter xd
I don’t think any of us were saying yuri and yaoi wasn’t fetishised. Something something citrus something something sakura trixk
Thats why fan service works well
Sex is marketable
Lily is a revolution <:LilyHeart:512705101731987478>
I’ve mainly seen it used to men presenting as female. Like wearing feminine clothes and stuff
Then we get to Lily who is like “i died of a heart attack induced from shock after seeing facial hair on my face grow” and the added caveat of <:KoutarouCool:505159133121609728> shouting “why do you fuckers even care shes a girl start practicing you walnuts”
Then you get a character who’s undeniably trans right?
And theres a lot of characters where the punchline is “but they have the peeenis”
But the thing is with that show is that there is a lot of ways to interpret haruhi’s dad and what they are doing 
Are they trans? Crossdressing? Coping with loss? A creep?
Sadly all of these are possible because the show doesn’t dwell on it and treats it more as a comedic point
The vic bloke who got accused of all that sexual harassment stuff  was voice acting tamaki and used those two words
Double fun fact
Wasn’t the greatest of rewatches
And straight up used both “transsexual” and “tranny”
Which by the way, funfact I watched dub
Haruhi’s “dad” from ouran highschool host club
I remember the first character i saw which had elements of being trans
It will probably stay that way
Unless we see ferris get her moment in the anime
You think maybe theres a problem with people using the word trap to describe trans people especially in the anime community is cause of the “trans” characters we get in animr
Coming back a bit to the original topic we were discussing
Supportive of trans people as long as its not inside their own circle
:d
So basically me coming out as trans is bad because that means im not religious enough
My asian family has told me and my cousin that “they are fine with gay people but their religion dictates that is forbidden and sinful so they aren’t accepting in a way”
I thought you meant your au pairs dad wasnt ok with *you* being bi
I just reread it
Oh ok
Cate your au pair?
Love, I already shout out my fustrations here <:CoconaSmile:535946981890064394>
You have a mom?!
*aaaaa*
Speaking of exams
I have exams to pass before them
But thats a few months away
I will explode in pink
Oh yeah when i go uni
Dammed conservative asian family
Gah i wish I could dress more freely now <:waturr:286761153630044160>
https://www.politico.com/story/2019/04/05/trump-withdraws-ice-director-pick-ron-vitiello-1259551
If you aren’t affected its easier not to care
Tryin to read gender bender trash and its filled with “oh im a trap” and i just go 🤦
I feel like this manga translators took... *liberties* with words
Japanese doesn’t have the word trap right
Bigotry?
I genuinely wouldnt be surprised if in the news we heard May just lost her absolute shit
Well its a british knife
This time she is gonna bring a fucking knife to her “meeting” with corbyn
Wobbles you don’t understand
Ive heard bloom into you was very good
Hideri is a character who spends time in and out of work presenting female.
Their character is mostly based on the premise “but Hideri has peenis” and that leads to wacky situations like going towards a female bathroom in public but being stopped and told to go to the male one instead
Hideri from blend s is Lily lite
I didn’t know the discord server was locked <:KoutaroSmug:515285332493729835>
And i go hyper yikes
But you get to people who take it into “no lily is actually just wants to be cute they are actually a boy”
They don’t dwell on it
Missing it is fine
Yea thats the thing
Lowering minimum wage wouldn’t reduce prices
Cause i think we all agree *fuck terfs*
That is her completely misunderstanding me

Whenever i regret leaving i want to remind myself of *this*
So fuck them
Apparently that was too fucking anecdotal and i shouldn’t read tok mucj into the joke
Someone said “you wont suck my dick cause you straight? You homophobic.”
I will presume in a joking manner but I replied “well doesnt work for me :D”
<:dab:532336272673603587> i just left a server in a fit of blind sjw rage :p
Im sure you would know
Whats tougher than concentration camps
And all i want to do is just live my life happily. I don’t think thats too selfish of me to ask no?
And if i choose wrong there will be severe consequences
That I don’t have any good options. Only varying degrees of bad
It really feels like the walls are closing in
Its why i still have an irrational phobia of touching plugs and drains
I get something and i stick to it religiously
I’ve always understood that for me Autism makes it so that i find it hard to branch out into newer things if that makes sense
The most scariest thing for me
I don’t think a study break is an option either. I won’t be free otherwise
But it hurts a lot to do that when im already struggling so much with dysphoria sometimes
I know
Which will definitely be hard.
My mum wants me to try and focus on my studies
I feel like a selfish brat sometimes asking for something like “i wana transiston” when I know it’s this hard
It would be much harder to be independent if i drop out
I really don’t want to
Of knowing im trans but being unable to do anything
3-4 years away
And the best time I will 100% be able to do that is after uni
I know
My grandmother won’t understand. And with everything happening with her I wouldn’t be surprised if me coming out tips her over the edge
But i cant stop thinking about it
Unlikely
Worst case scenario for me is they somehow successfully drag me to Saudi or something after I come out
Im scared to do so
Sometimes i wonder why i bother. Why I even bother to fight.
Living as the gender i wasn’t assigned at birth is just too fucking hard
All I really want is to live my life the way I want to. It’s depressing that it would be extremely naïve of me to assume i could do so in the first place
*fucking asian family making my life more complicated than it has to*
And I don’t think in a great way
feel like my life is gonna very radically change
ok thans. i meant labiaplasty im just a derp
I know its quite personal, but what were you thinking and what made you pick vaginoplasty over laipioplasty
Like having a risk to have to have your prostate be pushed back in
Im at this sort of information dump presentation thingy and they talking about trans fem surgery and all of that
<@!127644949884698624> you got a vaginoplasty correct?
https://youtu.be/aivko6RPQ8o uk is *fuuun*
Also theres a pretty nice video by philosophy tube about brexit
https://youtu.be/_gbDAvK42yA <@256945399338631168>
Although most people in this circle voted remain because they brexit they want is very different from a right wing brexit
I believe a socialist view of brexit is that it is severing ties away from a neo liberal system.
Like being denied any healthcare
Theres also just flat out discrimination
Whats up?
Yikes?
Yes im not the best person to imply that ive had a loving and caring family ^_^
How your raised really means fuck all
<:what:434168653215301632> love and caring family has nothing to do with this?
I dont think unwanted physical *sexual* contact is “kindness and loving”
It looks bad if you do
You don’t speak out against them
I mean its co-workers
Thats a topic for another time lets not get into that
I remember when people compared vic to the shield hero <:Omegalul:518767109346558002>
Werent there people like the voice of Goku?
My edgelord cuntbag i know once jumped into a convo i was having with another girl about how citrus was kinda meh
He had heard the word citrus and just blurted right in like “if you like citrus you  cant talk shit about goblin slayer” 
We were all like <:what:434168653215301632>
Dunkek I don’t know why you thought i was arguing women shouldn’t be vilified cause I mainly focused on raph xd
Super edgelord
Manga is just constant gore and rape iirc
...
Oh boy goblin slayer...
And about goblin slayer
I read the manga i know
I personally feel she never had free will
“Adopt” is not the correct word. Purchase is literally what he does
Dunkek. The problem isnt “promoting”
Legally its his name now i guess
And thus the protagonist is vilified by the world
Of which the monarchy is involved
Is the protagonist is a victim of a massive false rape accusation
The main premise
Weird...
The king doesn’t give a shit about the slave part
Errr... i said it was a lie
I had that same problem with the manga
The show focuses on nao in a really weird way
There is no real love for these characters. What i mean is rooting for anyone is kinda shitty. Like a good example of this is when the king tries to yoink raph.
Yes he’s being extremely biased against nao and yes he doesn’t actually give a shit about the slave thing just wants to fuck him over.
But what hes doing effectively is morally right in the eyes of the other heroes. Cause slavery is such a disgusting act.
Spear hero less so but hes a rapist lets not even think about him
I can see why he did it. But its still a case of massive shittery
Ever just enslave a child
^
Especially when these false accusations get lots of attention
It may seem like that if, like i shamefully have done in my dark past, look for false accusations all the time and ignore cases when accusations actually go through
That be wise
Gosh i dunno if theres a right way to say it but being trans is weird sometimes
O
Ashley is still gone right?
I did the exact same thing as you nara <:huggo:532336272740581377>
<#371105434771390465> if we shifting to wholesome stuff
Until you just made that comparison
I completely forgot about that
The manga oh boy
Wait hana WAIT XD
🤔
Cried in my girlfriends arms at her house yesterday
Like down down
Ive felt pretty... down
And ive done the brilliant and wise move of bunking school today
And life has decided to mess me up emotionally today
So... my exams are coming up
I feel like there must be some bread tube video on religion and how necessary it is today :p
I have my own belief about he afterlife
Agnostic might not be right tho... its weird
Im agnostic and a bacon lovin whore
If its just you and me in london
Depending on whos asking and who in with determes who I believe
So in a way i am :d
<@!188714906143424513> no, but my family is
So the verse about 72 virgins was something like “my grandpas brothers babysitter heard Mohamed say this”
Every verse has a level of “legitimacy”
Fun fact
And the holy book is people writing what he said
Cause Mohamed was told all the stuff thats written in the holy book :p
Sadly that wouldnt work for islan
What a lul moment that dork
Like personally i feel like my nan not accepting me for “culture” or “religion” is fucking disgusting
Am I wrong to be really mad at my family because they wouldnt accept me btw?
What grandfather
I lost hope with my family when mu nan gave me massive shits about my hair being too long xd
Or the rest of my family
Its depressing to think that my nan only loves me because i have neglected to tell her a few things
The “love” of family is quite shitty sometimes
Or extremely irrelevant maybe
Sorry im taking my time to vent this out :p
Which ive started again
Same with new vegas
And now i would happily take my gta characters life. Id accept the criminal stuff and fear of death
Spent another 100k making my car the trans pride colours
I spent $100k gta money on tons of clothes
Like gta online
Video games have also made me quite dysphoric
But it definitely hurts a lot being scared wearing clothes i feel comfortable
I dunno
Maybe im really scared about being valid
I remember looking around and being paranoid at people thinking i look weird or creepy
But one thing I remember is seeing people that were asian and being really paranoid
I went out yesterday in my gfs clothes. In watford so no chance of bumping into anyone i know
And the being asian
And the terfs
First one
Being trans is suffering? That probably sums up most of it
Im not sure what i can say
I wasnt able to talk about it with my gf
And right now thinking about it, its scary how that has built up
But it was a flurry of a bunch of stuff which had been building up
And its not like anything specific was wrong
sorry bit of dark humour
Pink triangle if you were gay?
So if anything capitalism is to blame <:soviet:280046671935569920>
I speculate that the main reason for these censorship from sony is just 2020 tokyo is coming up and japan doesn’t wana risk it
Ironically these censorship of games seem to be appeasing the right wing conservatives rather than any “radical sjws”
As it turns out theres more right wing conservatives in government than any kind of “radical sjw”
When will we get non binary binary code <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
With sketch his uncle is just a massive cunt :s
Nara do you mean why homophobia?
New servers knows immediately whom i be
I play on hard mode on discord
In many months
I havent spoken on discord
~~my tutorial must be much longer~~
Cough cough
6-12 months
After my exams im probably gonna get more into tabletop. Turns out roleplaying helps a lot for some strange reason
Speedrunning transition
I swear we laughed at someone drawinrg anger eyebrows on roll20
Got a name and a fun character muse out of that
Tabletop was fun
That came from tabletop
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
<:NotLikePapika:284132078054932480>
I asked for that to be made an emote
Oh fuck
<:TsubasaYareYare:407397617451139073>
Flashback to when we had one mod ^_^
Revolution eh?
And fera
Hey nara ^_^
The faces i see today barely resemble who i saw back then :d
People come and go
25,715
24k or something
Now its like
My collection was barely 1k back then
^_^
I pinged rukia for image spam
When i joined here
Cough cough conservatives
Hell compassion for others is something people lack in general sometimes
Their beliefs overtake their compassion for others
They see it as immoral

You poor sod
Oh rakhi

Leak?
Oh?
2 days after i had my first kiss...
I did it too... good times
*or else*
So make sure to add yourself to be a part of that history
See nara this place has so much history that even i dont know it all ^_^
Right... more things that happened
<a:NadePrideRave:520606120654405632>
I mean what
Homura is goals
Sadly
I was busy
I remember hana just bringing a fucking hammer
I mean
I don’t mean anything by it?
Err... it was interesting because it was interesting?
Watching saki crack was interesting
It made me a bit toxic i feel in ways
A while to get out of that eggshell
God it took me
🐣
Shy chick
Oh

<@!127644949884698624>
Oh god I remember when in year 6 i got really mad i wasnt red riding hold and instead the wolf

Ive followed a chunnibyo set of rules. If someone came to me and said they were from my future
^
How do i time travel i need to shake my past self violently and break it to her more... persuasively
Oh god i was such a fucking egg
Will you continue crossdressing?
Would you like to hear a vali update?
Oh right saki
<a:Hug:530477382142787594>
Oh fuck me... vali
Transposting
And <@!263983345669505025> gets bonus for making it better
Oh right i claim i started the whole trans icon in pfp thing
And I probably wont get out of it till this December
Last summer
Since...
Ive been on the waiting list
Not to mention
Im petrified of gate keeping
In the uk
I was kinda like “im trans but god fuck me thats so bad rn”
At this point

Thats what egg rakhi did
Something something jim sterling
Me español señorita no es buena <:sataniaCry:399429942171009044>
¡Ah, me habla un poco español!
She has to
Yes
Tbf to her she is rightly paranoid about family:d
When i say probably it’s because im not sure if she thinks its a phase or something i can just turn off for a bit to focus on other stuff
And she is quite reluctant for stuff like me wearing feminine clothes at our house. We’ve had to move out of our nan cause.... things lets say
Basically she wants me to medically transition after uni because of family and how they will be massive cunts about it. Currently i *hopefully* start uni in October
Oh right you weren’t here for me saying this
Ye
A bit
To my mum via text
I came out a year ago ish
Ive had a pretty liberal upbringing
Well she isn’t exactly conservative and all too faithful compared to everyone else
I still dont 100% know what my mum thinks
I texted my mum. It probably worked out
America please
https://www.thedailybeast.com/state-department-to-lgbt-married-couples-your-out-of-wedlock-kids-arent-citizens
I figured that, but its still susceptible to domestic and foreign intervention
Could go the opposite direction
Theres a chance communism exists
First past the post at it again
Revolutionary mogg
As funny an image that is
It could be mogg rising up
And who says it would be something like a socialist revolution anyway
Well one unfortunate symptom of a really bad economy can be spikes in racism
Any of you seen a video called “alt right playbook: we go high, you go low”?
Thats the problem
The logic is that in their mind lgbt people are *not* capable of raising children
if you're going down better take what you can down with you
all of these disgusting laws being passed and i cant even remember what was the catalyst for all of this

RIP in piece British Steel
Meanwhile in the UK
As slow and painful as that was
Hell I basically cracked here
Ive spent a year here and in that time have spent god knows how long ranting about all my emotional woes
Could be exam stress could be family stess hey I haven’t thought about dysphoria in a while could even be that
Ah, too much...
Or maybe im just exaggerating it... i feel fucky
I feel like my entire psyche is fragile glass ready to shatter
https://youtu.be/dVbC0jASJYA good video about the 2017 election
And the tories didnt
When Labour had a budgeted manifesto explaining how they planned to make all the money they wanted to make policies
The phrase was coined in the 2017 election
But we can *literally* see this happening
Ive talked to people that don’t believe me when i say this, like im saying a conspiracy theory
Also bleeding out the nhs btw
<@256945399338631168>
Thats fair
Its impossible to ask *you* to support changing her
Your mum seems like a lost cause because the effort to change her is radically high
But some people need others to put that effort in. I wouldn’t have realised i was trans if i hadnt had people help me
In terms of change... people *can* change....
I feel like that can be true in most circumstances
I mean you are allowed to say you dont want to interact with this person anymore
https://mobile.twitter.com/kelseyellison/status/1132010240944353281
The trend seems to be with an early life section they will just say “they are assigned —— at birth”
Im finding a whole lot of no dead names
Im looking at people articles which are on thr list of transgender people
So its like saying the conservatives are in complete control because they have the most seats
Fun fact the remain party have a higher portion of seats
Pffff brexit party having power

You dont owe these people anything
I wish parenting classes were more accessible
Got it, just found it relevant to the discussion. Wont happen again
Im 18

You’re younger than I thought :p
Nara how old are you?
<:huggo:532336272740581377>
Emotional abuse is rough. I should know first hand

The corporate shilling?
You’re... green and not sketch anymore:p
How would i know?
...
Aaaah
Are you british?
Ukip is a hole in the ground now
Conservatives got absolutely wipes
So greens, lib dems, that sorta stuff
Got more seats overall
That parties that advocate for a more remain/cancel brexit thing
So they got the most seats but the thing is overall
Nigel farage wants free eu money again it seems by doing nothing
Which is UKIP but worse id say
The prominent party was ofc the Brexit Party
Turnout was just as low as usual
The results of the EU Parliament election was... interesting
The last UK general election was a hung parliament which was resolved with a supply and demand deal with the DUP to make the conservatives rule
Last election was actually the EU Parliament election
Ok

Didnt this whole thing really start because of that fuckin terf in Parliament
Thats the mood i got from when i read what he said for the first time
He was pandering to the people that think being gay is the bad bad :s
Thanks tory scum
I just love our mental health in the NHS
“These immigrants aren’t integrating!!!”
“Let’s stop english classes to stop immigrants from integrating!”
Or as in studying English literature and english classs native english speakers tend to take
English as in learning english?
This happened in the UK?
I think they stole their flag from Change UK
Piers morgan and Donald Trump talk about the LGBTQ+ community. The most cursed statement ive ever said and yet its *happening right now*
Currently im at my nans house because my nan *insisted* i visit today
That was if i existed in a vaccum.
And i can hold that for maybe 15-30 minutes
The thing with destressing like that is it takes around an hour or two of that to regain any chance of me being able to absorb anything i revise
I canr just do nothing all day today when my exam is tomorrow
But then what do i do
Yori today I spend 15 minutes revising and then 2 hours doing nothing because my brain wouldnt be able to absorb anything else
All this mental crisising is absorbing my revision time
I feel empty when i think about anything after the exam
Ive lost all my passion to do anything and im scared that ive lost it for good
In general these exams have fucked my brain so hard
I know but i do actually want to go to UEA surprisingly
Although I probably dodged a bullet with that considering apparently our history teacher is *oof*
Because i liked ICT and my plans went down the drain when i couldnt take history
Its a 3 year course?
I have no clue
HND?
The only passion i  have is politics so im hoping to do that
A cs tomorrow and political ideologies on Thursday
2 more
In a closet unable to get out
But that would mean i get to spend another year
I mean there’s probably resitting options
I might get ACC or BCC <:SakiPTSD:529387422136664065>
And personally and looking at unofficial mark schemes
Well i need BBB or ABC
August 15th is a level result day and the pessimist in me forcasts a spike in self harm and attempted suicides
These a levels feel like absolute hell...
To a degree I feel as if my worries about the exams being extremely stressful snd emotionally draining isnt as valid but *god* me going to university and having a chance to get a job that would give me the opportunity to escape the void of this stupid family is dependent on my performance in three subjects
Well META with that wording i find a lot of people find me saying “im a lass” is pushing things onto them :d
We can share. He can probably share too
Olly is my husbando
Thats a very “yer dad” transphobia xD
I don’t like the idea of the middle ground defining if fighting for trans rights is radical or not
And also who’s defining a radical feminist as well.. someone from the far right sees radical feminism as people who fight for gay or trans rigts
Trans person: i hate my existence
Terf: i also hate your existence 
Trans person: fuck you i love myself now go die in a fire
Nothing motivates me to stop hating myself more than a bigot saying they hate me
I mean calling someone an egg to them is a bit self defeating
Egg is a term for trans person who doesnt know it
Woooo
Ans it will likely never come up in the anime
Infact I actually spoke to an idiot who thought they weren’t trans and just “wanted to be cute”
Transphobes *tried* to claim lily as a tr*p
<:TsubasaSmug:585839805737467920>
Cough cough tsubasa
Thug has racial implications?
Bikini armour
The pedal next to the accelerator
I feel like a looot of people would do that tho
I mean i too would play vr as a girl for perverse sexual reasons
Viper you bitch you said what i didnt wana say :p
Mixed with an extremely large void of self \o/
My identity is a spiral of pain and suffering of mass confusion
I also did that a lot, the not giving out my gender :p
As well as calling yourself an egg
But who on earth would do that <:BikkiNervous:514954426088423424>
Cough cough the t word
Huh.... ive always associated thugs with large strong scary men like bouncers
Well thats conservatism for ya
Well the argument im making is that the lgbt choice thing doesnt work because they dont wana be stoned or arrested in 3rd world countries, or be kicked out of their home and live homeless due to beig gay or trans
Also if people could choose to be gay that means they would also choose to risk death, discrimination and distaste from their own family
It doesn’t have to
I dont feel as if its a reason to dislike Contra tho. Lot of deep discussion to be had about what even makes us *us* i suppose <:MeguShrug:586122984637595658>
And they felt it was more accurate to describe themselves as a person who went from performing manhood (albeit extremely unhappily and wishing to stop so) with performing womanhood
That they didnt feel like they identified with that kinda philosophy
I remember it coming up in one of their videos
The alternative philosophy is that an individual is always their preferred gender but didnt realise
Which... is debatable
Contrapoints takes the philosophy that the act f being trans is more of a “i used to perform as a male, but i now perform as a girl”
Im not just saying that because they are hot leftists
As well as a lot of contrapoints
Philosophy tubes video on transphobia is really dope
Hence why punch terfs exists
Why would a terf be willing to speak to me and accept that i exist
A neo nazi isnt gonna be open to me speaking about how i have an attraction to marx
Also thats working on the assumption that the person you are speaking to is giving you the time of day
Cant put our head in the sand on that
It shouldn’t be, but it is
I can see a lot of reasons for that. A large chunk of it can be bigotry or transphobia but there is such thing as a genital preference i feel. Just dont let genitals define a persons gender <:yayakaShrug:286284426541924352>

While your at it please deal with **the actual concentration camps you have in your country for immigrants**
Thanks america very cool

Graham or something
Cough cough that massive fucking terf i can barely remember the name of now
Well that happens
Guardian
This is the kinda *enlightened centrism* ive encountered sometimes :p

The mental health of people taking a levels right now is disgustingly volatile
Edexcel launches investigation after A-level maths paper leaked online https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-48646188
Us politics is the biggest shitshow ive ever studied
Yeah don’t worry bout it too much
I do want to say “it hasnt reached the level of which nazi concentration camps reached” is not an acceptable argument. Japanese internment camps was disgusting. ICE concentration camps is disgusting.
https://mobile.twitter.com/ecmclaughlin/status/1139192167501484033
Is because of this
Anyway the reason I brought up US concentration camps
This child
You either have backbenchers sucking off the government or loud jeering
PMQ is a shitshow
Commons is extremely fun xD
**on a debate about the budget**
Like thr first guy brought out a picture of a cop and said “yes hes a lovely chap” and that was it
Most of the people used their time to shill out someone in their constituency
It took half an hour for someone to actually talk about the bikl
In class we watched a small section of a congressional debate on **the budget**
UK government is weird. US Goverment is comical on how... messed up it can be
Ive studied us and uk politics i know my shit 😎
As bad as boris Johnson is, he isnt a reality show host who has disgusting views
You have actual concentration camps
No American politics is pretty bad
Errr
Imagine spending 2 years literally doing nothing
Nor would he have been 3 years ago
Right now, corbyn isnt gonna be seen as viable
Thats the thing tho
That’s ignoring the fact that Labout itself is not unified on brexit either
If he shows a way out, it would be dammed to hell
He doesn’t really have to right now. The initiative for a brexit deal isn’t currently on him. Its on the tories
Showing a brexit stance gives conservatives something big for them to jump on corbyn about
When the enemy is busy shooting themselves
Why play your cards and let your enemies claw at you
Well i think of it like this
Well then i dunno <:yayakaShrug:286284426541924352> 
I happen to quite like corbyn and im blessed with memory to know what a lib dem is capable of doing so my votes quite easy
Unless you are allergic to ballot papers :D
I mean there’s really no harm in voting
People at the end of the day back down and realise their vote needs to go to a major party
Eu and local elections are not great reflections on voting on a national leel
I dont think so
People are getting sick of conservative rule
Its very likely labour would win
Which means those 4 got more votes than he did
Leaving javid, cunt, gove and bj
He was eliminated 5th
He failed spectacularly
Pfff
Rn its jeremy cunt and bj in the race
Gove dropped out
Sort of like *donald trump*
Bojo is in trouble for a lot of things
So how many of you fellow brit bongs excited for **Prime minister Boris Johnson**
https://twitter.com/morganmpage/status/1142787346917679105

Oh speaking of shapiro

Oh boy nara you have no idea
4 years of harassment, brigading and spreading its racist views and it is finally being put down like the dog it is

Its definitely not a good introduction to a show

I mean if you want to analyse IT Crowd
Glad I didn’t get into it tho
Felt kinda.... off
I never really got into IT crowd
The usual transphobic garbage of “indoctrination”
By “expressing concerns” about trans people and trans charities
Tried to stop it
This made the lotto money uncertain
Graham used mumsnet to brigade the lotto who planned to give a large charity fund to Mermaids, a trans support charity
Its “feminists” who don’t believe trans people exist
Well
Do you know what TERFs are?
“It wasnt that hot thus climate change isnt real”
Thats actually one of the comments i saw
https://youtu.be/RLqXkYrdmjY this video is becoming relevant again

I know jesus
hottest month recorded *so far*

They would only do that when the walls come crashing down
The republican party is more than willing to kick trump off his chair and pin it all on him
But it starts the process of documenting all the fucked up shit trump has been doing
I don’t care if it worked or not
Id love if the Democrats actually had balls and tried to impeach trump
State over country
Thats America for you
Pork
https://youtu.be/_gbDAvK42yA this is a good video
You get the working class voting Tories so that they can slash the nhs
You get people voting Leave when it is detrimental to them
And everyone thinks they know best
Thats a flaw with representive democracy. Everyone cannot be informed. 
*because you have to ask everyone who is informing them*
Whats the point of seeing what the opposition willdo
If you live in a safe seat
If the system is broken and everyone isthe same, whats the point of doing research
Thats a byproduct of the two party system
If its biden or harris well *another 4 years wooo*
Depends on who yhe democrat candidate is
Funnily enough, I believe trump has already had at *least* one scandal which makes watergate look like a fucking handbag fight

Mind if i ask what particularly are you feeling bout?
:s
dess_define Imposter Syndrome
Lemmie err
Imposter syndrome iirc
Like “I don’t ice skate every week thus im not a real ice skater”
Obviously that line of thinking can apply to a whole range of things
Sorry, when you said that brief description my brain immediately went to my own experience with that
Took a while to work through that
So maybe an example would’ve been “i have doubts on having genital surgery, thus im not trans and calling myself trans would be wrong”
And calling myself trans would be offensive to “actual” trans people
Or that certain things meant I couldn’t possibly be trans
I used to think that my dysphoria wasnt strong enough tk say im trans
So for a period of time
Ah the “im not trans enough to be trans”. Thats what i had for myself
I doubt that
Oh letd be honest
I understand it
Its a dark and twisted love
You’ve gotta keep fighting. Giving them the satisfaction isn’t worth it
Yeah because you have the “capacity” to sin
Because who wants a sinner in their family
As long as they arent in your family
Geh, thats the same crap my family try and preach. Be gay but *being gay is bad*
Yeah theres like 5-6 different screenshots

Im shooketh
Woah
Youve seen people?
I know in the uk theres a weird distinction between “white” and other kinds of white such as polish
Depends on what you call white tho
Whoda thunk it
Poor white people need money
And i have zero spice tolerance
Im asian
Stereotypes are bullshit anyway
Break past the barrier of monster and villains and you find humans
One day ill send this to this person and see what they think then
```I must confess that over the past few years I have been gravely disappointed with the white moderate. I have almost reached the regrettable conclusion that the Negro's great stumbling block in his stride toward freedom is not the White Citizen's Counciler or the Ku Klux Klanner, but the white moderate, who is more devoted to 'order' than to justice; who prefers a negative peace which is the absence of tension to a positive peace which is the presence of justice```
Lemmie see if i can find it hol on
They remind me so much of a certain quote MLK said about “the white moderates”
And seemed annoyed when i said you cant put an extended time table on peoples rights to exist
Had someone i know who genuinely thinks that trans rights should start from education
Speaking of education (sorry random rant about a friend time)
If i can give you some voting advice, vote for someone who doesnt plan to let the current system of oppression stand longer than it already has
I look at america these days and i find it hard not to be disheartened at humanity as a whole
I don’t think i would ever go to America in the next 10 maybe 20 years.
Its not a great place for someone like me
Nixon would be rolling in his grave
I mean you have someone who was caught on tape saying how he would actually molest women
Iirc the gamergate crowd somewhat flocked to trump as well
Zero political experience******
He was the prime outsider
Lets hear what he has to say
Look its *donald trump*
And the media loved to give trump attention
Vs a *woah brand new outsider who says carazy stuff*
A washington insider, lots of political experience
The prime thing to take from it was that clinton was probably the worst person to run against trump however
But theres a lot of reasons why trump won over her
Rather “im more left than trump yall”
She wasnt much of a left candidate at all
I take offence at the neoliberal side of her
Well personally
And field a candidate similar to clinton
And that is if the democrats forget everything they learned in 2016
There is a possibility that trump gets a second term
We have a democrat speaker of the house whos more than willing to suck up to trump and the camps he continues to allow to operate
Creepy old biden aint gon do jack shit against trump, nor would he change much if he wins
Because nobody wlse would stand against trump
I believe a candidate that leans more left is required
If america has any chance of not continuing to sink to such a disgusting state it is right now what with trump trying to erase trans rights and literal fucking concentration camps in the country
But definitely a majority
Well not all antifa action is young people
Saw a tale bout a descendent of Jewish partisans getting arrested for blocking the road to an ICE camp for example
Milkshaking fascists is a good example of youth action. Same with fucking with ICE camps
Founding fathers deliberately created a system not fully democratic
Tbh it never did
Well do you understand *why* standards of living is so poor
And in some countries all whining is silenced
With “young people whining”
That doesn’t have the negative you think america has
Like i cant really think of a single country
Which countries tho?
Such the same as the feeling of suffering
Joy is a complicated emotion
I don’t think so
Well if all else fails theres always direct action against ICE concentration camps <:GarieWink:336657101273169921>
*didnt see bernie drop out tr race*

In the UK less of the time its mistakes
Knowingly creating fake stories to drum up fear and hatred is disgusting and happens often
Why on earth would i ever implement a law like that and *not* required the apology
Well.... i mean
That apologies would be required to be put in place the same size of the original piece
Because our main source of news is the papers

But hey

Director Yasushiro Takemoto was confirmed to be dead

Question is who and the length
Without question theres gonna be anime airing delays
Now, definitely
I dont think an animation studio requires **guards**
You telling me someone who set fire to a building with the intent to kill is delusional?
Sooo
Well the word for “rip off” has many meanings
Oh and ishidate
Out of this list, only ishihara is confirmed to be safe iirc
Its the biggest mass attack in modern japanese history
Ah replace the 17 and 7
17 confirmed dead, 7 who have no life signs (not declared dead by a doctor), 10 gravely injured, 6 with moderate injuries and 20 with minor injuries
~~i know they also dont like trans people~~
Jokes on them if i hit on a guy its straight <:MariaSunglasses:336656798687690752>

Btw on the topic of America fuck regan
Heard that one somewhere
Ah, “problematic genes”
*certain people* that doesn’t sound good
I feel like god is but many explanations for the big bang and that’s dope
I mean believing that god created the universe is acceptable imo. I mean we have zero idea what caused the big bang
Everyone is free...
Just some people are more free than others
And it is the states right to allow that school to exist
Its the individuals right to own that school

My opinion right now is in a state of flux
I found this tweet and wanted to see what yall thought of what contra was saying
No

And i cant spoiler tag images so better put it here to be safe
I mean... its art related to the kyoani tragedy

Is the digital stuff too big or complicated to back up?
Thats what i was thinking
Question, what kind of work would be lost? Like physically stuff or like all the computer stuff they had are completely gone?
And ideally id also implement a large arrays of socialist policies. Practically well...
I mean. Ideally yeah
*i linked the long video for a reason* <:VanirSmug:537040907506286592>

Legalisation puts sex work under state control
I would decriminalise it
I wouldnt legalise sex work
Personally im very pro sex work but the problem is the reason why many people have to rely on it to feed themselves
https://youtu.be/1DZfUzxZ2VU
Do i have a video for you!
Im talking about sex work
For their money
Oh i dont mean in that way
But chasers can also have good monie
A relationship with someone who literally only wants you because you are a girl with a dick is not a healthy relationship
So he gets to realise how fucked up he is
See what id rather prefer is that he gets sentenced to life in jail in a rehabilitate prison
Beating someone with a stick doesnt deter people. It only fuels their anger
Effective at punishment sure
I know this guy is the absolute worst but fuck me the japanese prison system sucks ass
*japanese prison system sounds like hell anyway*
No matter the motive, i still prefer him tk be locked up forever
Projecting the successful people of the past onto modern day society doesnt hold much weight
Holy shit
Oh no im only one of those things <:NotLikePapika:284132078054932480>
Someone else already made that joke
A quote from a different discord

```now begins a new golden age of vaguely competent-but-deliberate malice. ```
Hope not
Man i love the UK
Who plans to use a process to bypass parliament entirely in order to secure a no deal brexit
What greater irony is it to leave the un democratic EU under a PM who was not voted in democratically
But the longer it goes on, the longer the people that may vote for him will be broken from the delusion
Obviously he doesnt care
As he was not voted in by the people
The thing is, until an election is actually called his legitimacy as PM will always be brought into question
Coward
Which is why he probably wont do it
Call an election coward

Re: the pope and trans people
Thats cool and all but have you ever hated the hoarding of wealth so much you burst into a market and raise hell
Since we’re talking about the bible can we talk about how Jesus was a radical leftist
Question. Are all of those passages from the new testament?

nah fuck that red rock
at least let me get on estrogen before we blow up the rock
doomsaying aside, what is the implications of this
<a:RinWhat:411187672699109388>
well its either a new deal or a new arms race
like its obsession with getting both sides to an argument leading to terfs getting a paragraph on trans rights articles or climate change denial
yeah most of the time its pretty true, just sometimes they have a bit of a "lets be bad" moments
how much do you like enlightened centrism?
depends
well
its just another thousand on the thousand we already have effectively is what im getting at
well they were getting to a point of being able to invade the japanese mainland
The problem isnt *just* the die hard loyalists
I honestly struggle to see how people remain supportive of trump and his hateful politics after all this time. I feel like ignorance after all this time is unacceptable at this point
There is also sightings of fucking immigration officers at the scene of the shooting
https://mobile.twitter.com/atrupar/status/1157803228530188289
https://youtu.be/BmjB7TUroyE re:police training (i just wana shill this video)
I was listening to a leftist who is pro gun in a rural america. His view is that you’ll find on the left that gunownerhip is a tool. On the right, gun ownership is a status symbol
Completely separate from the toxic ideology and belief in their fucking hearts
Its facinating to see the media and conservatives try and declare this shooter as a “lone wolf, mentally ill” individual
I don’t remember obama supporters committing atrocities because of extreme fear of immigration
I don’t remember obama rallys having chants of “send them home”
By the way. Border patrols being there already doesnt mean much to me. The democrats are barely different to republicans as well as thr fact that republicans are taking it to 11
Nowhere close
We arent there yet
*nobody* wants to launch a nuke
When i say launch a nuke i mean a more modern “end the world” nuke
The closest humanity has ever been to launching a nuke is the cuban missile crisis. A situation where each side was *convinced* the other was literally going to launch their mukes
*nobody* wants to launch the first nuke
Launching the first nuke means a nuke is launched in response
Mutually assured destruction
Fig... do you know what MADD is
Its the slimey pricks who stand behind him for financial gain. Because their fear rhetoric against anything left will drive them to support trump
Listen if theres no Mexicans to shoot everything will be fine <:pepega:504408080285564948>
Maybe a better example, the one i was thinking of, if federal law becomes that doctors can legally deny trans people care or if trans people are legally written out of existence via laws making gender tied to birth genitals
Its really up to fed whether it actually enforces their law if its different to state law. Weed is a good example
Its very short hand
And terrorists are known for not being picky where they shoot
But federal law encompasses all
Yeah

Japanese culture doesn’t glorify guns as a status symbol
Errr, because Japanese and American culture is so different
https://youtu.be/NovuyaBMkBc
I haven’t really thought about this till i watched this vid but, a lot of proposed gun control reform seems pretty flimsy...
Clearly they don’t know the *fear* of neutral B Joker
And that one is way more severe and provable than the idea that games can be violent
You think a company like EA would sit there and let the blows come if the government tries to enforce restrictions? They’ve already pushed back hard on their accusations that they are running casinos
They can lobby against dumb laws like that
They make big money
Video games will be fine
Its not like things are gonna happen until they get worse. Which is depressing because it’s tremendously bad already
Im just... well i wouldnt say shocked but more disappointed at the internet for blowing up about reactions to the shootings rather than motive and reasons it happened
Its extremely obvious that video games dont cause violence
Calling these scum brownshirts is not much of  a stretch
And its been extremely damm successful
I believe fox news deliberately blamed video games as a way to get people outraged about the wrong reason
El paso, walmart
These shootings were committed by white nationalists who were spoonfed a toxic rhetoric by a disturbingly horrible president. I see less on how trump and fascism is on the rise as an influencer of mass shooters and more about how the government is after videogames
I feel like the massive internet outrage over video game violence is not a mistake
Probably

Hold on ill embed that
But they are not owed that
Maybe tell them to cease contacting you considering they have decided to attempt action using discord to target you
I would suggest blocking this person
This person has been rude, manipulative and acted in a disgusting manner towards you
I need to empathise. You owe this person nothing. You are within your rights to drop him
<@!302063351767498752> the same guy who posted lolis and threatened your server?
And thus to “pander” to yhis group would be to achnowledge its existence and the problems they face
Because one is a minority group which is oppressed
Yheres like 3 people in the convo
To call it pandering is a but wrong
You used the wrong word
Also yes that’s quite big
<@189146272865845248> if i can assertion this correctly, the clip shown was a good example of trans representation but there are other forms of media which portray trans people in a cheap attempt to drag a trans audience in. Pandering might be a little wrong for that word wise
You see why i asked now :p
This current government would be using mass surveillance to target trans people for example
But one thing that needs to be understood is that laws regarding surveillance targets minorities much more
No
Are you a white straight cis male?
I should ask
These white nationalist attacks are a great example of stochastic terrorism
Well... mental health is only part of the issue
Nor is lashing out on us
Nobody knows how to reply
Yikes
Well not everything
A depressing joke
Ah uk welfare is a joke :s
The end goal of capitalism is to always generate growth
Its like “crony capitalism”
Excessive capitalism is a bit of a meme tbh
And they are currently using them to commit atrocities
Uk and us sell a looooot of guns to saudi arabia
Cough cough yemen
Theres always a sign, its just hard to see sometimes
Well more and more people need to be aware of the crisis points shooters undertake prior
Well proposed gun control reform anyway
A good chunk of gun control reform these days disproportionately target minorities owning guns
Or maybe 5 terms down we get a worser reagan in office
Maybe this current president will decide whole heartedness is blindly following his every word
Who defines whole heartedness
Or if the truth is too taxing
Being ignorant is fine as long as you are willing to learn imo
Theres ignorance and theres putting your head in the sand
Yes
Also, i would definitely classify these attacks as terrorism
Because they get replaced by selfish people
Thats the reality of being a minority <:sadcowboy:510303995215085569>
~~btw i recommenced breadtube to everyone~~
Ah i getcha
Antifa is pretty radical in todays society and im pretty pro that
Well that id less agree
Ancap is cursed

Hyper yikes
YIKES
Anarco capitalism is cursed
Dystopian
Because pure capitalism would be hell
The new deal
Hey yall you remember the CIA fuckin up socialist countries?
Not to mention centrism as a whole really just leans towards the right as it aims to maintain the status quo if it cans
Not everything is a bit right yeah
In terms of voting
We didnt balance out equality between genders
Wheras my ideal is just a more elaborate ubi :3
Run by a dictatorial society
Yeah but matrix is dystopian
I will ara ara you all into the red banner

It happened quite literally in my girlfriends arms
Not a clue
Had my first ever anxiety attack today
So
Why claim to be a trans woman. They could claim to be a cis woman or even a trans man.
The second problem is
The main problem is failing to see them as women in the first place
Something racist once is... putting it absurdly lightly
Yeah if i didnt do that I would’ve thought solo was a danger to society

So how many people here are aware of whats happening in Kashmir?
Some actions are so horrible that hiding behind the “it was right at the time” is not valid
Columbus is scum
Im picturing someone unironically using both of these as genuine arguments as debate against socialism and capitalism
Forgive me if i didnt read extremely deeply into their words beyond a basic “heres an example to roast both socialism AND capitalism!”
That’s some enlightened centrist shit if ive ever seen it

Where defenders of him were boldly claiming him to be the shield hero
Most clearly seen during the Vic allegations
And so people will draw upon it and reflect it within society

But on the topic of shield hero

I mean you’re free vent about relationships woes. I feel like i did that before i realised “wait i wana fuck this girl thats why i keep wanting to hug her bad”
Welcome to serious discussion
The human brain is quite complex and tsundere about telling you exactly what its thinking
~~challenge~~
So any dick just to be clear
No shame in that, genitals preferences exist
And also whose dick
Or would you, if presented, suck dick again
Like did you think “well that was... ok never again tho”
I mean i was referring to enjoyment rather than taste :p
Would you do that more?
Was it enjoyable?
Right
Fuckin a girl with a dick is no different than fuckin a girl with vagina in terms of sexuality
Not to mention usage
Dicks under hormones become much different to guy dicks
Well genitals are all bullshit anyway
Would you like vaginas on a trans man?
Unless you want to date men
I think

Who’s probably _worse_
He gets replaced by someone in his party
Lets do say that he gets assassinated just like that
If anything you would make the situation worse
Except you wouldnt
That implies he is not as smart as humans, which is a dangerous assumption to make
Thinking of him as a dog is a mistake

Trump believes himself
Boris is smart
British trump is a little innacurate
Boris
Conventionally, she doesnt say no yo anything
The queen can only say yes
I hope so too
Especially since we’re kinda poorer now because we’ve had to make very fun payments in order to get yo where I am noe
No idea what to say
I need to tell my mum
Physically anyway

A meme thats gone too far
Brexit party is... a meme
The greens are... small
Lib dems are proving themselves to be “id rather suck tory dick again than save the country with corbyn”
But i feel like other parties are kinda just... centre, centre right ish
Well luckily for me i got pushed more left so corbyn is a pretty comfortable vote for me to make
Where were the “good guys with a gun” in Texas? I feel like of all the states the southern ones who have been pushing for good guy with a gun kinda stuff would have... good guys with guns?

Gosh unless those kinds of laws dont actually work makes you think

impeachment is not a British thing
Its undeniable that he does have a fascist alt right fan base. Where do you think this backlash is coming from?
Well when you present two extremes ofc its very obvious
*implying that a good chunk of those subs even watch his shit*
Unless you somehow believe me saying hes built up a fascist following means every single one of his subscribers
Since i fail to see where i somehow declared most of pewdiepie’s fanbase alt right
If you could just politely point to where exactly i did that
Wow...
Are you actually suggesting i called every single one of his subscribers alt right fashies?
?
TW: lot of anti-semetism
Some lovely reactions to all of this in youtube comments!
http://imgur.com/a/s3DFQ1N
If he really wants to separate from that he’s gotta actually commit
Well hes built up a community of fascist fans
This made the alt right fuckos mad as hell
He donated some money to the Anti Defamatory League which has a mission statement of being against anti-semetism
Depends where you stand politically
Im looking at his subreddit, where the pinned post telling people to shut up about conspiracies of pewdiepie being blackmailed is filled with comments saying “its baad the charity is baaaaad why did you doo thiiis”
But this is baby steps
And its good that he’s starting to make a pusback against them with gestures like this
If it turned out he only had 1 million alt right fans, thats still 1 million even if he has 100 million subscribers
We are talking about someone who has millions of fana
But dont put words in my mouth for that to suggest all of his subs are alt right
Especially if the church holds homophobia
Yeah if they think autism is a disease i dont place much faith in them being understanding with crossdressers
Stay safe
one of the people i play in dnd came out like that
probably
cowboy movies
it was facinating to study them
southern states are wack
and preserving the union is a funny word for beating up rebels
"states rights" in this context would be a dog whistle for slavery xD
it was majority about slavery
well it was about slavery i guess
hmmm
the american civil war?
I imagine the right wing hatred for brown people outweigh the polish hatred for ukranians then no?
does that we include yourself or are you just talking about polish people?
?
some questionable wording
well thats good to know
if neoliberalism has fucked your country why not try blame the brown people fleeing from hell!
AfD for example
the migrant crisis gave prominace to a lot of the far right european parties
Lodz is a better example

we do have they/them i guess
y'all is gender neutral :3
or that they drive down wages
heard a lot of "these immigrants dont integrate"
well i find that a lot of the reasons that people say "oh its not about race its about x" is actually more tied to race than they think
Nobody is saying he is
If thats the case why did he even say he was donating to them?

For some reason i dont think his young viewer base and closeted fascists got that message
You dont upload the fiverr video and edit it by accident
Well the stuff pewds have done isn’t exactly “slip ups”
You could maybe argue the heated gamer moment but that just raises the question of why was that in his lexicon
And the people think people are genuinely saying that are delusional about how radicalisation actually works on youtube
Ok im back from crying about life what did i miss
Doesn’t really help an actual egg... being very blatant about how you think they are trans
Well that same person sounds extremely enthusiastic :s
With that i think its just homophobia, as if being gay is “nor normal” and thus “bad”
Choosing to play girls... ive only ever heard that as a reason to be trans
I remember seeing a good few nazi cartoons and assorted propaganda around the time
I know right my wit is wasted
I used something called exaggeration
Not to mention you can’t leave your frankly low paying job while taking all this unpaid overtime nor speak out for better work hours because you are literally relying on this job to eat and sleep in a home

On a game that sold extremely well
To save money
So that very same staff gets fired
Just for it to sell not nearly enough as they want it to
Ah you’re right! I just love playing video games such as red dead redemption 2 made with labour that makes gulags look like holiday camps
That’s capitalism for ya
Because they don’t earn more than the previous years
Combined with the fact that companies such as EA and Activision are actually considered to be *failing* by shareholders
Its inhumane
To sell actual gambling to kids
Treating devs like slaves
Its the video games industry
If there was ever a great example of capitalism sucking ass
Surprise mechanics was said in uk parliament of all places
And they lobby fucking hard for it to remain the same way
A lot
They do
You dont have to feel
Its frankly a much more disturbing story than something like the hot coffee controversy. Imagine telling a parent “BE WARNED ABOUT THE FOOTBALL GAME”
They watched their parent enter the details just so they could buy more
Story in the uk about kids who sank their parents credit cards on fifa packs
Parents can only do so much on that front. Lootboxes are an amazing example for that
Did i see some horse shoe theory?
they always have, its just theyve specified its also a non binary pronoun
Our brexit party is the ukip base jumping ship :s
Boris would sink this country into the ground just to make as much cash as possible
Im saying this as someone who doesn’t even really believe something like the eu can be reformed but we arent leaving in the right way
Might as well just reform the eu from the inside as best you can
At this point labour is more  we want a deal that isnt dogshit, but other than that remaining is better than no deal
sooo yeah she is homophobic
well she believes that a straight relationship is superior to a homosexual one
Well not today anyway
But i find that I don’t really want them to happen too
Ah that happens a lot for me. Hoping a car veers wrong
It was almost... wanting a reason why it wouldn’t be all bad
Most of my philosophy on the afterlife came from bleak times in my life
I don’t think humans are meant to dwell on our own mortalities so much. Especially when we have the cancer that is depression which twists our brain
Death itself is a strange concept for us
Well whats the saying go
You die twice. One is when your heart stops. The other is when your name is said for the last time
Like a soul
Unless you also believe there is something unmeasurable within our selves
But really if you aren’t particularly religious like me, there isn’t gonna be anything after our brain activity goes away
A theory that came in my head was that death would be like an eternal dream, with all the pros and cons of that
But i have a pretty decent number of good places on discord so thats dope
So i can bail quicker
My name is just to bait out when places arent so great
Reddit isn’t exactly the best for trans people

The yikes of our times
A disturbingly large amount of presidents have committed crimes. Not like jaywalking crime either
Re: impeachment 
It actually does serve a purpose if your goal isnt to actually impeach the president.
The senate wont ever try the president for a crime. They will however have to defend his ass when a laundry list of his crimes are exposed
I thought you were leaving
I believe the last half hour or so is evidence against that
Hence

CBT
You literally started this because you wanted to leave the server. I see no reason why CBT *isnt* relevant for you
Well... clearly you havent
I recommend CBT. You can refer yourself to a gp for that, they’ll give you a number for it or even refer you themselves
There’s also anino which is quite small
Is that... not valk?
Theres like 5 gear servers now iirc
Depends on the server
Thatcher is our reagan
Think of reagan
Well theres a lot of absolutely scummy and horrible people who said they would actually do what they would do if they held power
I mean thatchers grave is a gender neutral toilet
As well as Iraq
Austerity is a good jumping off point
Oh yes every bastard responsible for the deaths caused by Austerity
Id love to see everyone be held accountable but such is life :s
The republicans currently just hide behind trump, and when shit hits the fan they have a perfect scapegoat
Because trump stops becoming useful
Just remember that when they actually do seperate away from trump, its because they have a replacement
But when he becomes a liability they’ll kick the chair away
They’ll push and defend trump when it suits them
Intelligent but spineless and speaks to their morality
Barely touch it
Certainly the media im consuming
We aren’t hearing much about whats happened in Haiti
And while alt right is on the rise it isnt civil war numbers
Conservatives arent gonna die for hi
Which wouldn’t be that many
They protect the constitution in theory. An impeached president is not exactly someone fit constitutionally
Not all southern governors are hyper trump people
Not enough for a civil war
But
I mean I imagine the really radicalised chuds might do something
<:Omegalul:518767109346558002>
I wouldn’t be that surprised tbh
Like modern civil war?
America or uk?
Neo liberalism for you
Us law students are having a blast
I mean american politics is about to enter a quite lovely time
Its the tory-lite option
They would sooner align themselves with the Liberal Democrats, a party most famous for selling out students during their coalition government
Years of media lies and other bullshit makes people thing Corbyn is the spawn of satan :s
A lot of people would rather bite their lips and bear through boris then even consider handing government over to Corbyn
Whether they will or not is another matter
Key word being *could*
The fact that they both hated the power of the majority and also the power of the crown explains why the constitution is constructed in a particular way as well
Well with the founding fathers, the fact they owned slaves gives context to the 3/5ths section
Right but its what you do with those views
Like if we go further back
Yes but we can understand all he wants why he was a racist fuck towards the indians. Doesn’t exactly change that he would’ve happily killed a fuckton of them if he could
Segregation *supposed to have anyway* ended with my grandparents generation for the people in the us
Hell
Yori i think you can when it would be my parents and grandparents who literally knew the us President as reagan tho. Its not all that long ago
Not reagan
Thats nixon
Watergate...
As a gay trans, i am morally obligated to hate reagan <:dabqua:412357887122472961>
But yeah sorry going back to thatcher and reagan
Yeah
I think its just a washing machine and drier that they have
See i dont yeet it all in <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
You sure?
But i have a lot of clothes, underwear and a towel
Well i dont have anything purely white
Or separate it
And i dunno if i just yeet it all in
I have a basket filled with clothes
Well
I need to figure out how to do laundry
But im not in the mood to debate anarchy sorry
Well the argument is the state shouldnt hold a monopoly on anything. For example the use of violence
Yes
Im ancom at heart but with the uk im just quite socialist instead
Its not like Thatcher didn’t know what she was doing
~~austerity~~
So its just “lets give rich people more money!”
And then the money trickles down <:pepega:504408080285564948>
Its the dumbest political idea. You give money to the high percentage of wealthy people
Trickle down economics was a mistake
When she died “ding dong the witch is dead” was the number 1 song played
Yes theres a fuckton to actually learn
Hyper neoliberalism which set the country back years
Comments such like TW ||41% off? You’d have to Be suicidal not to buy!||
People in comments and reviews are... taking it a step further

Rally racing or even drag racing is also a hobby too
A ban on something like AR-15s would shift people to just go to even more dangerous shit. Stuff like homemade and such.
The ethics of even owning a firearm is debatable. Security, for personal use in training. A gun range can be therapeutic to people
But america’s problem is too big
I don’t think police should even have guns <:dabqua:412357887122472961>
You shouldn’t be armed then
An accident is when you are in a shootout and accidentally hit a passerby
Also the “manslaughter” argument only works when you believe that you can accidentally walk into someones house *as a police officer who is armed* and end the situation with one person dead and trying to cover it up
Theres an issue where the American justice system is harsh and unforgiving... if you are not a white person
Which brought them to shoot in the first place
Sure guns were the murder weapons. But behind the gun is a disgusting ideology
El paso and vegas
But there is a sense of politics in there too
I mean radicalised in a sense to commit a shooting
Looking at why people get radicalised to perform acts of terror is a great place to start too
Especially when “governments trying to take away liberties” is part of why they were initially allowed guns
Its much simpler to target gun culture and reinforce more healthier gun ownership than it is to remove all guns
And thats a lot of presidential terms
40 years is a long time to bunker down
But you are talking about drugs
You dont get a dirty needle epidemic if you can trade dirty needles out
You wont get the spice epidemic if weed is not a crime to smoke
I would personally just decriminalise most
Drugs aren’t dangerous when you aren’t stigmatised to take them unhealthily
Imagine if trump decided to “control” the gun situation
But slippery slope
Take control is a.. i hate this term
And the thing is you cant just think we can remove all the guns in America. That just simply isn’t possible
Like having to own a safe
A lot of “proposed changes” to fix gun control by democrats and such would backfire and hurt minorities owning guns mainly
Hes kinda been the one to change my mind on the issue
Ive been watching far too much of a breadtuber from america called Beau of the Fifth
Youd also need everyone to consent to that
Its a disgustingly large number
Its impossible to keep track of the firearms in the us
Especially with the war on drugs
You dont keep things the way they are
So you make sure it doesn’t go underground as much as you can
Some americans think homosexuality is a mental illness
“Mentally ill” is a loaded term
Can easily mark Black People as irresponsable gun owners
Depends on whos doing the check
Background checks can be more harmful than you think
Yes but guns can (and already have far too much already) go into the public sphere
Which is a great example of a bad gun owner
Who... for some reason allows a kid to know how to access their guns
we see they get their guns most of the time from a family member or close friend
When we see cases of school shooters
As long as you take your precautions
There isnt harm however in just going to a range and shooting some targets
Flexing ur gun just is bad
Another part is that its a very private thing that you use. You see a lot of the NRA folk who flex their guns as a status symbol
I believe the black panthers for example had armed people protecting certain parts of communities
Part of it is the idea that the state shouldn’t be fully depended upon
Well ive only been convinced by a leftist more recently by it so ill try and explain it the best i can
~~leftist discussion is just a side bonus~~
I do recommend beau of the fifth tho somethings charming about a rural american. I dunno what
Anyway i need to bounce have fun
Many of those school shooters should not have ever gotten their hands on a gun
That female officer shouldn’t have been armed for example
I’ve kinda felt like right to bear arms doesn’t mean right to bear them irresponsibility and recklessly
The constitution is wack anyway
And i got a leftist perspective too :s
Took me a fuckin long ass time
Its hard to really even try to *understand* american gun culture as a non american tbh
Now
The other was him standing behind red colours with the Kremlin behind him. His name behind him in fuckin soviet font
One of them was him in a suit
Is 2 pictures of jeremy corbyn
The example i have in my head rn
How you can tell a story
Yeah
But i also have a history and philosophy section
Like rn we are studying narratives in my politic section
So it’s actually more philosophy with a bit of politics
My course name is politics, philosophy and ethics
Nah it’s actually quite fun to learn
*which is why i took it for my uni degree!*
Politics is a draining subject to talk about for me
Went on chapo trap house apparently for an interview
And hes in even primer position
Most recent for me is Bernie recovered
Or politically
In general?
To get no deal
Our pm has literally said he will *break the law*
Indeed
I think im the only brit here who wants leftwing brexit followed by remain followed by nothing else go back to step 1 plz
Too busy with brexit
Admittedly im not exactly keeping up to date with it
From what I understand of India, is that a nationalist party has been making some... fun decisions
*too many*
Like lib dems actually have mps
Except when they dont
And the other parties make farting noises
I mean in the uk theres 2 major parties
<:chi_dab:388832384558170112>
Well we would love to have someone from Kashmir explain but the region got blacked out
I hear india are doing quite... horrible things these days
What country are you from subra?
Something Something trans people Something something gay people something something anyone who isnt japanese per say
<:rollsafe:324679764709212160>
If we are a warzone
Cant pull us in
As a brit, its climate change and brexit
Do you agree with the hashtag?
I still dont see the relevance of those two points
Why... are you concerned about that #
Thats an... extremely random and specific inquiry
?
https://youtu.be/ll8zGaWhofU
Fuck the company stuff, on youtube using Lgbtq language can get your videos demonetised.
And i mean left wing
He is a prominent leftist politician
Both of them are telling some kind of story
Really want that chinese market...
And the player gets no prize money AND a 1 year ban
The casters were *fired*
There is blood on these people’s hands who implemented this disgusting system
When they clearly werent
Or dying because they were assessed to be fit for qork
More tales of people dying not getting their money in time
Dead dead
Yes
I know of a tale of someone who was *dead* to be assessed as fit to work
And how to describe conditions to people who assess them
The paper looks like advice for people coming in
Its mainly where people go for welfare
Department for work and pensions
Kiryu is my dad now

Games like fifa dont need gambling mechanics
I don’t think thats fully true either
Imagine warning parents not to trust a football sports game
Its a fuckin football game
Fifa
For example
I dont think it’s entirely on yhe parents to handle predatory gambling mechanics
They tried to enter a synagogue but they couldn’t get in so shot at bystanders
An alt-right terrorist killed 2 people in Germany
In bleaker news
Kibler is a *very* proficient voice in the HS community btw
oh shit we talking politics and human nature 👀
that is an absurdly pessimistic view
then why have the biggest school shooters in america have performed their attacks to an extend where people were suprised that it was them
they would maximise victims
why would they
they wouldnt give much warning
if someone was to actually shoot up your school
you are isolating yourself
you arent protecting yourself
I can barely speak english let alone Japanese
just go on the streets and ask people on the streets to buy your mix tape
in regards to working
I wouldn't want to live in Japan personally. The culture is quite... toxic for my mindset
to say this and a school shooting is equal is absurd
a school shooting is much more complex
this is just a weird ass.. i dont even know im not dipping my toes in it
that is a massive reach of two different kinds of hatreds
wow
a game of chess is a violent game if you want to be semantic. two people competing with 1 victor
because it has violence
that doesnt mean everything is bad
discussion holds violence
every single form of politics legitimises some kind of violence towards others in a certain way.
because its such a broad temr
and also you need to accept you can never escape violence
humans wouldnt be around
if that was really the case
human nature being violent is wack
dunk seriously
To launch a nuke in the first place you need some screws loose
Nukes dont kill unless a nuke kills basically
Its toxic for yourself
<:TsubasaYareYare:407397617451139073> please avoid hyper extremes
But now they cant do shit
So if i told my psychologist im trans when i was 16 I would be outed for example
That means in terms of a parent/child relation
Thats not selling privacy
Its called a nuke
Pfff
....
So you’re essentially asking is if your self made bomb idea will ever be produced by the us military...
You... need to explain what tf a lemon bomb even is
What?

Fun fact about that though most of the cases of voter fraud were old people. *and also politicians*
Its disenfranchisement
Voter fraud isn’t the problem they are tackling
In the uk, our leading party is trying to make having an id required to vote
We can probably stop the damage we are doing now. That would help a lot
Theres sewage dumping fucktons of toxic crap into a river.
The solution isnt to build a clean water filter dam
Its fucking that toxic pump up
Technology isn’t gonna turn around climate change
^
And has like 50 states with different ways they do shit
America is big
See
Can barely see into tomorrow rn let alone years down the line
Soon being... god knows when
Im trans and will change my name soon
**stopping voter fraud**
Now why on earth would someone like me just change their name like that
Unless you get your name changed
Passport here is valid for 10 years
Kurwa kurwa kurwa
Is that how i say hello?
The lass who did my pfp is polish
Ooh
What country are you?
Just let the poor uni students, the unemployed and the ones who are suffering from the disgusting tory policies to not have the ability to vote out the scumbags in charge  <:pepega:504408080285564948>
In the uk a new passport is about £75.50 ish
So you’ve set a financial barrier
You wish to prove someone is who they say they are but make id expensive
And not even talking about the cost
I recall a story where you need id to vote
But the place to get an id opened once a month *sometimes*
Especially southern states
Oh yeah america is fuckinf ugly with that
Whenever someone talks about “stopping voter fraud” its a dog whistle for limiting voters
Its not like you can walk into my ballot location and say hey im emily im voting now
Then ya vote
You take that and say hey lemmie vote
Is everyone gets sent in the post their ballot location and a vote letter thinf
Also how votinf works here rn
The DWP xD
But the government has been famous for thinking dead people are in fact alive
Youd think that
Single digit
And also those numbers are quite literally
Which isnt an id thing, its a lazy thing
Most of the identity forms of voter fraud come from people who are *dead* getting to vote
When it *really* isnt a problem
So imagine having to bring your passport just to vote
We don’t have a national id
Enough to rig an election
On mass
Bruh
Who the hell has the motivational energy to fuckin pretend to be someone else at a ballot
Why tf would you
Yes
Living that spoon free life
Nah im actually Emotional Wreck <:dabqua:412357887122472961>
Last i checked my name isnt saki....

Oh god what if my name is saki help wfc
Why are you asking saki?
Why... did you even ask this tho
~~kashmir~~
Unless you hate protestors
Why tf would you stop at blinding
But ya know
It does a bit more than blinding
You kinda missed that discussion
Stuffing a box with votes is a pretty outdated idea of voter fraud imo. These days the bigger problem is just people not getting to vote at all and gerrymandering
I mean
The reason you have the millions of people is a prevention for a fraud
And much more risky
Ah so its an expensive pencil i see
Fuck knows what it did
If i press a button on a machine
If i mark an x on a ballot i know I physically marked x on that ballot. And that it goes into a sealed box
How is the vote counted
Where is it logged
How and where does it register a vote
Implying the button press even does what its supposed to
What does it do with the the button press
https://youtu.be/w3_0x6oaDmI
Oof
And watch me break it
In this scenario
Errr... what kinda electronic ballot box are you even using?
Thanks call of duty
That’s perhaps a little too much paranoia for a random gunshot noise
Already posted that
Democracy 3 doesn’t have forced diversity thus its an apolitical game
I’ll just play my non political games like metal gear

From what ive heard the story is “usa and uk good. Russia and “bad terrorists” are bad”
Its valid to be a 1 issue voter
Conspiracy hat but I believe thats why they delayed saying when the extension is up till
The eu rn will be quite unhappy with corbyn as pm
But ive felt we could reform the eu on the inside anyway
Forcing austerity on a country bad

Military is a good point
And society rn isnt capable of answering that moral question
Moral question too
There will be non athletes who will want to participate too
>widespread 
>not enough
Pick one
That is a dumb generalisation for the sake of this argument
Would allow them to perform with people with no such legs
I don’t believe athletes are delusional to think that legs that make them run as fast as cars
What do you expect when you get robot legs
Look
But not if its sex change stuff
You have a paralympics system
Sports is easy
Can those in jobs requiring this even allow such a surgery as being mandatory? What if you cant afford it
Can those humans go run about easily with a killing spree
Those humans are objectively better than a normal human
So you can carry more
Improved arms
Lets say
Even if its minor shit
*its what i do* <:dab:532336272673603587>
I dont think a capitalist frame work would function with cybernetics. The disparity would be too severe between those who can access it and those who cannot
well... what kinda upgrades we talking about? How accessible will these upgrades be
Depends on how it’s implemented
UKIP had sargon of akkad all you need to know bout that
Lib democrats are just “tory policies are nice lets do most of these but pretend we do social progression!”
Left wing politics helps trans people who are struggling
In the uk, Corbyn is te best for trans rights
Im unaware anything is happening at all... mind telling us where you getting this?
I wouldn’t want anybody I know to know i am a depressed trans
There are valid reasons for anonymity
They have megaphones
I could always start my 10 part video essay on why part 3 is ass and get harassed and yelled at by asshats <:mmLol:361540629563703296>
Trans jojo collab lets go
Yes
I was watching the jojo done really fast (btw the creator of that actually came out as trans on YouTube) and i loved how their part 3 had literally no mention of anne
Remember anne?
Its nice to go from part 3 to part 6
*and also fucking dickheads who hate women*
I imagine a lot of the bandwagon hate on part 6 is from a lot of people who haven’t seem it
Part of the reason part 6 has questionable quality is because the people above araki forced him to go “gays bad no more” so he quickly finished the part and jumped ship
Araki: makes a lesbian relationship 
Asshats: you cant do that
Araki: makes a trans relationship instead
Ooh
Sorry how did we get from over sexualised women to the me too movement
?
Personally im all for milking otakus for blood if they feel like an uzaki pic could entice them
Their argument is a little flawed imo but they arent saying “boobs bad”
I don’t think they had troubles with the boobs... its what they are attached to
You saying theres a problem with the pope saying transgenders are the spawn of satan? Who’da thunk it
Organised religion or religion in general?
If solo said his pronouns were he/him, bigots would assume he is automatically the big trans
Related meme
So imagine in the modern day saying “we need to mark trans people so we know whos trans”
The yellow stars to mark Jews
They used pink triangles to mark the lgbt
The nazis
I recently saw the guardian here have a fuckin article saying “we need trans id”
No need to be gatekeepy on what constitutes a christian no?
Rad lord
Whats in your head when you picture rad fems tho subra?
Radical centrism
Reactionary is probably a better word :p
Believed in the gays but they are a sin
Gosh I remember when one of those people actually joined the server tho
*fuckin terfs*
Or denying the trans part
Indeed
Which is actually believing in god
So it takes some values from a religion but not the core tenant
Christian values but not christian what i mean
Ah so you’re trying to say an absence in the faith of god would be christian values?
Theres no real christian
Both of those are “christians”
<@472513526393602059> yes but you’re trying to speak for all of christianity as a whole as a gatekeeping authority when i dont feel it is. Like hell protestants vs catholics
<@!203444794737950720> this part
Well i said we shouldn’t be too gatekeepy and you kinda pinged back saying “but its not like that”
I pinged rady cause i was confused about what they meant by homosexual relationships
I was replying to subra
I feel like i have... lost where we are in the convo
Theres a different between saying how it is vs how we should be. Im saying how we should be not “oh but its not like this”
<@!203444794737950720> homosexual relationships?
Also imagine unironically saying they are virtue signallers
Imagine spending more time calling out cis saying “donky kong trans rights” over an actual trans med
No

Related meme on the current state of UK politics. Or alternative title
Its been 2 days and this is how bad the conservatives have fucked up
What are you talking about ofcourse there is some kind of middle ground that can be achieved. Liberal democrats in the uk <:pepega:504408080285564948>
/s
That is why i aim to take the middle ground in every single internet argument
||megumins mother forces megumin asleep with magic, locks the door on sleeping megumin and kazuma in megus room in an attempt to have kazuma effectively daterape her||
Spoilers again and also trigger warning
Hell
The entire party are unsympathisable  and yet people are able to waifu the girls
But people are sympathising with him
Kazuma is an asshole
Now the problem is actually with the show in general
||the main bad of the movie is a crimera with big tiddies. Kazuma is like “uwu hot i wana smash” and the main bad also wana smash i believe. By the end of the final encounter, the main bad presses their... what the hell is that part called. The hips? Presses the hips into kazuma and kazuma feels a bulge. Kazuma then has the trans panic of running the fuck away in fear and screaming to kill the main bad. The main bad themselves don’t particularly identify as anything iirc and are just a mish mash of different humanoids. They don’t particularly care much for gender from what i recall from the LN|| spoilers for the konosuba movie
Ok let me spoilers first
Since trans people don’t really constitute the media
In general
But also that really isnt a good take anyway
I need to write spoiler stuff first
Geh give me a moment
Well
No
Oh yeah
How is... a page and a half of a horrible death not *deep*
Imaginary ones.... media is not something which purely exists in fiction
Internet AoC is 18
Megumin is indeed 14
Yes
As in haha kazuma got....
God fuck i dont even want to say that fucking dumb as bricks slur
Its played as a joke
It doesnt send out that kazuma is actually an asshole for using something that actually gets trans people killed and that hes a bigot
But what message does that scene send out
*although* spoilers for the LN ||considering the megukazu ship yikes||
The content of the hearts of the author are for them to know
With media there tends to be what the author thinks it means and what it actually means
Doubt those people will be too nice to trans people
People think the fucking “true gender equality thing” was good justification for stealing women’s underwear and drop kicking them
Hell
And the problem is not all people will not see kazuma in the wrong
To answer your original question Dunk, yes it kinda uses a literal trans panic scenario
<:TsubasaYareYare:407397617451139073> that doesnt excuse anything that was portrayed nor how its being presented
Essentially yeah. Compare Konosuba to something like Always sunnt
The character needs to be seriously unredeemable and unsympathisable
When a show presents asshole characters, there is one thing that needs to be established
Now
It sends off bad vibes
So for the age to be shifted down
The WN featured Megumin at 18 iirc
...
The age was the main problem. Im pretty sure i said that
Is s4 good
But was there more?
I know one of the villains is transfem and one of tbe pussycatdolls is transmasc
To this topic of the differences of reality and fiction
Related video
https://youtu.be/AxV8gAGmbtk
Hold on I might actually have a relevant video
“Just a story” is not a valid excuse. Writing a story where the main protagonist is freaked out about trans girls doesnt make it not transphobic for example just because in the universe it would make sense
It is ignorant to believe that fiction and reality are completely detatched. They are both capable of influencing another
So?
Fiction and reality are not so easily divided btw
I mean goinf back on point to the original point of discussion, konosuba and the trans panic scene
Its still going on
History my ass
UK its 16

Bolivian President
There is already reports as well of leftists being targeted by the military
Considering the level of US involvement it’s highly likely its CIA backed too
In more grim news, Eve Morales was essentially overthrown by a military coup
“Asked him to resign” 
Yeah the head of the military didn’t just “politely” ask did he
Thats a pretty blind take on british politics rn
Yeah I wouldn’t say that
Tories deserve the guillotine at this point
For me just interacting with people can spend spoons even if i replenish spoons as well. Most days its a loss
I mean the theory has a lot of room for personal interpretations
Have you heard the term “spoons”?
Labour by far
You’ve made that very clear
Yeah thats a valid point saki. 
If i may clarify voting is a little important cause depending on where you live it can be either a kinda protest or it could turn the tides of the election.
The tories are scum in that regards
No shit
Yeaj
The tories?
Its borderline propoganda
Saying generic statements means jack
Failed at what
Who
...
But what
And are you gonna let them make you feel like that
It fails when voters decide their votes dont count
I too just feel like abolishing all sense of democracy to establish a monarchy
No you just *feel* it
Yikes
So might i give you a suggestion. Read the party manifestos and decide which you feel is better for the country
Do you really want another 5 years of Boris
The important part is policy
Every party with have someone like that
Yes... welcome to politics
Thats cool and all but I don’t get why a very dead party means you are extremely disengaged in the current politics
And who do you plan on voting
So why labour
They had no power nor any chance of gaining it
I mean...
Imagine thinking ukip has ever been a successful party
Pff
Also i hope you don’t plan to vote Lib Dem. because the yellow tories are probably one of the more scummiest in the uk rn
How so
Why do you say the labour party might i ask
The rich have only gotten richer
Like fuck
The nhs has been starved
Homelessness and poverty has only risen
Also its easy to blame the eu for a lot of the problems that have been caused by 18 years of conservatives in power
Communist states arent famous for forcing austerity onto countries
Do you know what a communist state is?
What
Err
You planning on voting conservative?
Canada is pretty neoliberal rn which is fun
Yeah
Yori my fellow Englishman
*bRiTiSh*
Not worth it
Just leave it yori
... which was done by Atlee
Yeah ok ima peace out
...
Do you have a source on that?
Also thats a very questionable claim
That doesn’t make the lib dems any good
Right now im ignoring the horrendous reprecussions of brexit
But you don’t want to vote the pro brexit parties
So you want brexit done fast
...
Don’t think you want to vote boris
That... isnt a great thought process to have

Basically

Not to rag on him but a comedian is not the best for political news and learning your points and opinions
You watch a lot of Russell Howard...
Not gonna let billionaires ruin this country
Labour isnt gonna starve the NHS
Beyond that
No
Leave or remain
That is what the second referendum is
...
Labour policy is second referendum
In stopping brexit
Then why not work with Labour
Yeah
Keep in mind the tories get first try
Also lib dems are tory lite
But hasnt ruled out a tory one
But no for real. Jo had utterly ruled out coalition with Labour
Yeah 2010 was a myth <a:mmGold:393926007649861632>
That is the lib dem existence right now
Bahah thats where your wrong kiddo
Which is dont vote for lord buckethead sadly unless hes running in bojos constituency only
You have to implement some level of tactical voting
Unless you live in Brighton
Green party pff
Its not about the chance it’s about flexing on the snp
Flex on them
Vote labour anyway
I mean
Feelsbad
Yeah
Most likely labour unless you want Boris again
Ill dm it hold on
Other then the one i just linked
I could have a good video on the topic
Aand if i might
I studied it for a year and im still not fully educated on it
Its absurdly complicated
Theres a lot of “reasons”
By every right of that word
Run by cunts
And misinformation by the uk media
About nationalism
An essay
Its
https://youtu.be/dVbC0jASJYA relevant video about the 2017 election and the runup to that. Nice reflection on politics back then tbh
I used to be a liberal
Politics is wack let me tell ya
*looks at the first year in politics at uni*
I sort of know my politics
Or for an ancap perhaps regulation is their problem
So police is the states control on violence for example
Anarchism is against state having any kind of monopoly on something is how I understand it
Its the idea of communes
Its a big societal change
Is hard to fully understand due to it being quite radical
I believe
The rational with ancom
Well
Uhuh ok
I say im ancom but im mostly socialist
Look could be an ancap xD
Ah k
Anarco communist right?
Or in laymans terms
Imagine any kind of attempted left wing government without american intervention
🤤
Well imagine cuba without the embargo
For a country that was embargoed by america
I mean cuba did pretty fine
Just say socialist then surprise them later on <:rollsafe:324679764709212160>
Mood
:3
A fellow commie i see
A fellow ancom i see
I guessed
Nor do they stand a chance of getting a majority
I put that in quote marks because the way they’ve voted don’t exactly show that
Which is a bit worse then a referendum in your view no?
But beyond that. Liberal democrat “policy if they win” is utterly cancel brexit anyway
The problem was that leave means a lot of things
Yes but not everyone who voted leave voted for boris johnson to turn the country into purgatory
The government is just giving them the chance to speak
Its the people
But... its not the government saying no
And if you really believe that then why would you vote for anyone but the tories. They are gonna “honour” the referendum
That... is what the second vote is for
*fun fact 75% of reporting on labour is falsified or untrue*
Yikes
Which was
And that trans rights came slowly
Tory voter who thought thatcher was good
I had a friend like that
*fiscally conservative but socially liberal* <:pepega:504408080285564948>
And a vote for the lib dem here rn is a roundabout way to vote tory
I mean in the uk the “centre” party is the lib dems
I feel like the centrist dislike comes from american “moderates”
<:romcom:627597926872383499>
Better than politiscales
Is what i remembered
8 values
Hold on
There might be a better one
I think politiscales is pretty good today
Compass isnt the most accurate
That was stupid of Young Emily
Bit more easy to consume
What i got from that site
Sorta why I recommended 8 values btw
*having 29p in my account for the unforeseeable future is not doing my head good*
Ah i have to get exploited i see
Fuck thats good
How do i get such thing
Money? What on earth is that
On the brighter side Labours manifesto for trans people is pretty good
Just as labour still has blairites, so too do there exist terfs in Parliament <:sadcowboy:510303995215085569>
Hard to define it so easily
Politics encompasses a fuckton of things in our lives
Pretty much
I kinda see Bernie Sanders having a similar score
I imagine you trying it would yield a different result
Im near the bottom
And the bottom refers to anarchy
The top refers to utter authoritarianism
If you think about the political compas
Because im really extreme?

Like should it have a monopoly on violence
That axis essentially means how much power should a state have
Im pretty extreme
Well
If you answered it honestly you’d probably be in that ballpark at least depending on what you said

Capitalism is a bitch
Same could be said about the parents with that <:sadcowboy:510303995215085569>
People get that knowledge at different rates then others
Never said you did say that
Kids are brighter then they seem. All i wana say on that
Im mentally mature... for a plethora of shitty reasons
Depends on the kids
I mean
I think personally you need to have kids understand what they are doing and the separation of reality and fiction. Never really paid attention to the gta plot anyway, just spammed cheats and went wack on everything
<:mugi_peek:396854508149276672> i grew up playing GTA and cod. Had that young uncle who let us play

I only know of the existence of Hindi and Urdhu
Hi yes where do i get that <:soviet:280046671935569920> emote
So theres countless others that are unreported
I asked and it was mainly names that have been recorded through either media or report
In America, about 56 trans people have lost their lives. That number is just the people who were reported
There was so many Brazilians
I only put up 3 names. Pitielle and Soren from Brazil and Bayley from America
Suicide is part of those on the wall
I went to a trans day of remembrance service. Every post-it note is a trans person killed...
Is he like the only moderator?
Using the community?
Like there are people just named Symphogear characters and act like them
And also they are really horny and rp a lot
The amino server has maybe... >50 people
2 years now
God... ive been here like
One day im gonna write a history book about this bloody server xD
And also alice made the server because valk people were being shitty
Part of that is why the server was founded. Alice was <:transper:573433864731492362> and thus having the owner be trans attracted the more lgbtq Symphogear fans in
Lets say i aint been called a sjw for calling out a rape victim blamer here
Rady every server is gonna say they are the best server xD
Or valk isn’t growing
Must’ve had a purge
One such being an invite to valk
So you had “join /r/Symphogear” and then a tab for “other stuff”
Before both invite links got axed
If that makes sense
The invite on the subreddit was more prominent to this place than to valk
For a period of time
A non factor
The amino is...
Sorry, don’t mean to pry
Wait so how was hana part of alice being bad?
Complicated history aand
Did she ask *you* out?
Like
Oh
Wait how was hana involved with th-
The dagger of the big trans
Alice was a part of it but wasn’t it mainly Hana?
And also nothing screams eggy emily then asking a trans person what being trans feels because you might feel something similar
Because reading her dysphoria hit me a lot
Alice was actually part of how i realised i was trans
Oh lul. Some say hes still joining that server calling for the death of people
<:TsubasaYareYare:407397617451139073>
Oh shit that was wikias fault?
Oh right yes there *was* a godless period on this server where the only moderator was Glitch and there was no bots at all
As in on this server
Oh is that why i dont see luci all that much anymore...
I don’t bother
I ofc remember kerrik joining
Huh
I actually remember maya joining...
Kanade
I believe the only person here active whos been here longer is wfc? Might be someone else
It sucks
Welcome
Yep
I noticed i joined days before cast did <a:potatorave:524613674988732426>
But yeah
End of 2017

*im sorry*
I remember seeing solo post on the subreddit and thinking “shit he should come join here”
Help ive been here too long
<a:AiMegaPTSD:535178742386130945>
Couple of WEEKS?!
Aand how long have you been here if you dont mind me asking?
If they are even here still
I would advise against pinging them...
Ive actually had that discussion in my politics seminar today <a:NadePrideRave:520606120654405632>
Its a different world certainly
That crappy shit that requires us to present for 2 years
Bit cut out, but they are also reforming the gender recognition act

There was an attempt to label Corbyn an antisemite because he pronounced Epstein in a more German way

Its easy to see that when the media predominantly speaks negatively about literally everything he does while giving very minor criticism to the cunts up top rn
You can only smear corbyn so much
And the tories have had 2 years to show just how fucking shit they are
The tories didn’t exactly get a majority did they
You say lost
And if they try, they risk bringing the entire labour party down with him
If Corbyn wins this they are gonna have a real hard time removing him
Yeah but that doesnt mean the entirety of labour is gonna suddenly be tory lite
Snp is scottish
Lib dems are tory lite
All the other parties look like pathetic jam
Im hoping labour is able to steal this election from these tory scums tbh

Thats great for you but I’ll personally just stick to <:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616> cause that way i aint using something tainted with what stands for my oppression

Man dog whistles are fun arent they
That just gives me frenzone vibes

I’m pretty mistrustful of most if not all forms of the pepe stuff.

Other than that when i see pepes i usually get more cautious on what someone is saying
I don’t really have a better replacement for <:pepega:504408080285564948> at the moment
I personally feel its the first one
I can’t think of a server off the top of my head that shouldn’t have been quarantined. Other than Chapo maybe but honestly we deserve that
I didn’t realise that when i went in that sub they require a politscales test to see how pure a marxist i am
Facebook and those boomers
Certainly.
The internet is also a great way to radicalise people in the opposite direction
I don’t remember where i read this exactly but in france advertising for a role such as a waiter requires you to put (f) because the word for waiter and waitress are hard coded gendered so they specified they were in general looking for any waiters
And languages where times for different things is looser can physically mean that their interpretation of what times for things are to be different
On a more basic level a language which has hard coded gendered language would perceive objects in gendered roles
Which is also much more significant considering languages can shape how we think about the world
All languages except one are vanishing
So? Just because it is doesnt mean its current the best language that exists right now
Herrs something about United language 
Why do we automatically think its English thats gonna survive this language snap
Just be careful that cops dont find it and use it as an excuse to lock you up

I feel like there’s key differences with schizophrenia and plurality
Honestly theres a pride flag (<:pluralheart:647071041704820756> ) and a large set of specific terminology im trying to learn
So theres can be a disassociate understanding of who in a system of people is actually in control
One way ive seen it described is how 2 controllers are plugged into a game and both people are doing the same inputs. But perhaps at one point there’s a conflict and usually instead of there being a struggle only one input goes through because only one of them controls the bodu
Plurality is in horrible laymans terms because I am not exactly an expert in explaining something im not feeling is the existence of more than one in the body
Its extensive
Because it’s something kind of connected to trauma ive learned. Or rather it can be
So I’ve been learning more about plurality

Spells great for me
History doesnt justify blacking out the area and causing atrocities
I mean kashmir was good enough for me to say that a fascist is in power
Oh right indian politics
Also what discussed do you have when you crack down on protesters. I don’t really think telling the HK people that going back to the negotiation table with the government about the extradition bill will be all that helpful tbh. In that situation the debate isnt “come up with an alternative to the bill that lets china suck out any hk person”
Its we dont want this bill at all
Perhaps the reason why people think the government is out against muslims is because Kashmir has been blacked out and horrible disgusting shit is being committed by the government in there
https://youtu.be/0eHqQcKDoq8
Theres a different between “intent” and what they really want
Throwing tear gas in a University is disgusting
You aren’t addressing the main point of this bill. Or rather how its directly targeting muslims in India as well as denying muslims coming in. Not to mention how the state police are cracking down hard on dissent
The solution is not having  a barbaric law be passed
I highly doubt that this was unintentional
Do you recognise the problem with the current bill?
??

Hell in the south they recently purged a bunch of voters from their system
Minorities are part of that “hard to get id” group
^
If you want voter id you need to make id more accessable. But the people advocating for voter id are the same people who limit government spending
Sadly not
For me it would cost about £70-80 to renew my passport. Thats a lot for poor people who live mouth in hand. Its a brilliant way to make sure the poor cant vote
Also really NK is pretty low on the priority list tbh. It would do america much good if it focused on the starving kids in its own country than in a dictatorship
Not to mention he isn’t the only us diplomat
Just impeached
He hasn’t been removed
Trump is still in office?
Err

Nice
Shes been a terf a loooong time
Its not exactly new news
Perhaps the people of Myanmar would like to know why they couldn’t immigrate into India. Maybe they *should* give it a wide berth if they arent gonna be treated any better
And?
That really doesn’t mean too much. There are so many different reasons you immigrate from one country to another
It completely doesn’t include muslims on that list
https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/12/13/indias-new-law-may-leave-millions-muslims-without-citizenship/
Neutrality is an absurd thing to ask for an article. Articles are inherently biased.
And yeah searching for multiple sources is the point
https://twitter.com/dmmaus/status/1208238045159284742?s=19
Why repeat the exact same topic with the exact same “people are panicking but im not because i know its just a test”
Then why bring up how you aren’t panicking unlike the rest of the people
I don’t think fig brought it up because of anxiety
Not like we’ve had this discussion before
Then why do you keep bringing it up
Cough cough bbc
Not even mentioning the fact that a neutral article never exists cause an author chooses what is being included
Im sure those bastards would want that at kiwi place
For the sake of argument lets say kiwi farm is filled with disgusting and horrible people.
What reason should anyone present a “neutral” presentation on the place
Well head honcho claims all the praise right? <:Ver:336656981144109066>

I just wana say
I’ve had my ups and downs in this place. I’ve seen a lot of people come and go, faces and convos I probably won’t all remember and i wana say that this server has probably been one of the most revolutionary places for me.
I’ve learned a lot about myself, and im glad I get to speak to some great friends here.

Yeah well brexit isnt gonna help it
Capitalism is fun isnt it
Recession is soon to come
They cant exactly blame labour for the body bags that will pile up
Theres only so much fear mongering you can do when the horrors of what has become can only be blamed on the failings of yourself
Also i dont think corbyn socialism has exactly failed. I just think a fuckton of poor people are gonna die before the people wake up
America is unique in that regard
Bernie has a more grassroots surge
You can only do so much when 75% of the media reports on you are utter lies
Bernies failures will be the Democrats

we've already seen this with the treatment of the kurds
so what didnt help was assassinating a general (turning him into a martyr) and essentially throwing petrol into the fire
so that the younger generations werent gonna be that invested in the conflict
was that de-escalation had been going on for quite a while
essentially what it boiled down to

Although considering that ur white ud probably just come off as jokey tbh
Yeah I wouldn’t ask my doc if my meds had a reaction to an illegal druh
Its good to research your meds specially over someone blanket like don’t mix med and hard drugs
Like quite more
Weed however is milder then something like cocaine
Might i also add that mixing meds with hard drugs is certainly bad
You might want to elaborate on those sources
~~its called the UK rady~~
its umbrella for both sexuality and gender identity
kinda?
well..
i know its kinda like lesbian where the word used to mean a weak uninteresting woman but now means.. well lesbians
i think it depends on how old you are
as well seen in history queer is used to mark the i guess understanding? so like queer history and queer philosophy
a lot of people do use queer as a way of identification
its complicated
It can kinda seep into media
Well Japan is a weird country i find politically

Can’t imagine there was much governing during the world war 2 period
Youtube is a great place to get radicalised
I wouldn’t say thats a bad thing so but i can see it
Its called conservatism for a reason :p
Its significantly higher frequency with the right i find
Projection
Sjws ruining the world is comical
To have something queer focused isn’t normalised in society yet so when they see the 1/10 they flip their shit if its popular
The main reason people actually complain about crap like this is because it isnt “normal”
I can tell you first hand its exhausting and taxing
Basically yeah
Well just so you know it isnt ur duty to drag him out of that hole
Especially if they might still be in contact with this person
People do deserve to know that this person was grooming minors
That lasts a week
Then halt all discussion about it except foe maybe a special channel
The victims have a right to privacy to recover and heal.
Doubt the mod team give a shit about that bit tho
Even if it seems obvious
You shouldn’t name *anyone*
Err
Then i see nothing wrong
Did you name any victims?
Grooming?
I didnt say that
There is still quite valid criticism to the abusive miku being a shitty thing

Derp i meant benefits vastly outweigh the risks
Where they’ve heard or read some loose bit where they say blockers are the devils drug when in reality the risk vastly outweigh the benefits
Yeah thats where a lot of anti blocker stuff can come from
Blockers are just pressing pause on puberty
If you don’t, you drive someone closer to suicide and severe depression
If you do, theres a very small risk of bone density when you are like elderly
Try and compare the two sides. A tale where you use blockers and one where you dont
It really isnt
At the end of the day you gotta try building a life where you feel at least comfortable i feel. Societal expectations are wack, only self ones are somewhat important and even then it’s important to know that not every day you can work on them

we will have a reason
not all of them
well
the effects wont be seen immedietly
weve taken a dark path downwards
right now
<a:crabrave:671495509185134612>
UK is no longer in the EU anymore
F
like not every musician has perfect pitch for example nor do all who have perfect pitch are sucessful
but its not exactly a requirement
it helps
not to mention an ear for pitch isnt that necessary
some things will take time
a whole lot of things
a lot of things
and we have left now
and he has pushed through a very shite deal with the eu
and so boris johnson is essentially quite powerful
so the tories won quite comfortably
you kinda lose a lot of ground
including the fucking greens
and when literally every party takes fucking jabs at you
and also when your brexit policy is weakened by pressure from parties to be centrist
thick people too
sadly if you lie enough times and call a man anti semetic for about 2 years some people start thinking its true
and then called a snap election
failed
who tried to pass a deal
and **BORIS FUCKING JOHNSON** became the prime minister
so she quit
so it didnt pass
on what the fuck they want from the eu
the tory party is dividied
but like i said
and so she put it through parliament
at some point may had to sign a deal
but alas
typical tory stuff
that kinda stuff
doing horrible shit to poor people
so may spent a few years basically fucking about
and also paid them a fuckton of cash for this deal to hapen
a unionist northern irish party which is reminisent of the republican party in america
and was forced to make a sort of coalition deal with the DUP
where she lost her majority in parliament
right before she called a snap election
who promised not to call a snap election
and the firey mess of being the PM was handed to may
resigned
david cameron who swore he would not resign if the result was leave
in anycase
its a lot of the rural areas which are leave hotspots
scotland is utterly a remain area
looking at it region wise
this was nationally by the wau
kinda lead to a 52% majority to leave the european union
and also how perhaps the human rights codes that all eu members follow are a bit too stopping us from spying on our citizens and treating some of them like shit
some parts of the eus stance on immigration being too lax (cough cough refugee crisis) and how men in brussels control the uk
or perhaps more shitty wise
or the EU has regulations on bananas!!!!
crap like by voting leave we get fishing rights over our seas
combined with the fact that the then labour leader Corbyn received very little coverage on his campaign for remain and a good chunk of media focus was on partially the tory infighting but also spreading lovely delicious lies
the campaign fought was kinda bleh and the tory infighting was astounding
despite advocating for a remain position
for david cameron
sadly
the tory party had been split with those kinda neo lib/one nation tory types who loved the eu and the more right wing nationalist side which hated the eu
and 2
the tories were losing votes to UKIP, a far right nationalist party which wanted to directly leave the EU immedietly
the reason was becaues 1
he promised in 2015 that he would hold a referendum on the membership of the eu
in 2016 a referendum was held because the current conservative prime minister, David Cameron was having a bit of trouble
long anser
nationalism, lies and the 1% using the media to spread a fuckton of lies so they can profit from a massive political decision
short answer
hoo boy
theres plenty reasons to leave the eu. shame the far right nationalists got their reason to leave
not in general
as in within that demographic
lmao
a good chunk of those who voted leave are actually dead
infact
top tier boomer dying
this is like
well hes not that wanted anymore lmao
who the hell do these immigrants think they are
wait till you hear he also wants fucking *fair wages*
took it from me
but some pesky polish guy who works for a fucking dime
i wanted to be a strawberry picker
or that EU migrants make up a fuckton of the hard labour work
what do you mean EU nurses are helpful to our hospitals
implying they can retire
<:LMFAO:473670835748601858>
the bbc was called out by boris for being too bias FOR labour
after the tories won
the bbc who was absurdly bias towards the tories this election
and also by controlling the media hard they make it much harder for labour to win next time
yea but they are killing the poor people that would vote labour
just fuck my shit up
i just love austerity
id laugh tears of blood if we needed a german bailout
lmao
recessions are a lil bit wack anyway
but also
so is the uk
i mean
oh yeah i cant travel to europe freely anymore
are gone
so that means all the nice benefits we got from the eu
because like i said we are to the eu to what brazil is
kinda not
but also
we technically have more control over our country
funding for the nhs is being sucked away
food bank usage is at an all time high
people are literally starving while being declared fit for work while having no arms or legs
our benefits system is actually mudering people
money is being sucked away from public funding
austerity
^^^^
but its gonna be much easier
its been for years under the tories
is getting privatised
our nhs
err
america is muscling to force the uk into a shit trade deal
and that body count will continue to rise higher and higher
a lot of poor people are dead
some things will be seen easier
?
or at the very least is demonstratably fucked over by super deligates
but do i bloody hope bernie gets the nomination
i mean i hate to have hope when the deck is rigged as fuck
like weimar germany had fucking concentration camps
well that depends when you consider the start of concentration camps in the first place
*still*
i mean america literally has concentration camps in its borders
wtf i love neoliberalism now <:LMFAO:473670835748601858>
humans dont have long memory span
coughs in poland
the rise of far right parties in the eu parliament is a pretty big yike
<:LMFAO:473670835748601858>
wtf i love fascism now
well im in overdraft as well because that student loan doesnt cover shit
hell rn im in debt
:d
i am super likely percentage wise to die
sadlt
give it time
but ill settle with a democratic revolution
the uk is a fucking monarchy for gods sake
well duh
there aint no way centrists go "wow labour sure is bad huh"
so that way next election
part of me wants this country to fucking fall
see
its absurdly old and confusing
you round up a buncha people in a local area and they all have a bit of a debate and then a count happens
instead of asking people who tf they gonna vote for via ballot like NORMAL PEOPLE
essentially
because apparently disturbing levels of bigotry is significantly better than the scary left
man i love that the country recognised that boris and the tories are absolute cunts but yet still gave them the majority
https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/feb/03/political-journalists-boycott-no-10-briefing-after-reporter-ban
which prompted a journalist walk out
the government then tried to ban media outlets from a government briefing which was related
now things get depressingly worse
https://twitter.com/BBCPolitics/status/1224391573917650945?s=20#
https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-51364047
which extended prison sentences and also made sentences longer
in about 20 minutes
the government rushed through an anti-terror bill
in response
there was a terror attack yesterday in london. cops shot the suspect, some people got stabbed
so err holy fuck some draconian shit happened in the uk
Like their track record
Well consistency is pretty good id say in terms of policy
Another 4 years for minorities to suffer rn is 4 years too much i say
dont worry "i kiss my granddaugters on the fucking lips" biden will surely beat trump lets try and horrifically fail to rig the election against bernie
you can tell democracy is doing well when you use "names in a hat" and coin tosses

do a no game no life and land on its sides
and a coin toss
lets pick the candidate through a hat draw
because america wanted an old as fuck voting system instead of something normal
essentially delegations

being evil and being incompetent are two sides of the same coin
welcome to us politics
... hes losing in the popular vote
i think hes now trying to claim it doesnt matter about the deligate count because the popular vote is what matters!
boldly claimed he had won iowa
pete before any votes were even released
also
whos CEO was very vocal about their support of pete
by a company called Shadow Inc
hilariously
it was developed
because the attempt was quite sloppy and failed
except the people are also very stupid
basically yes
or any form of app
and also the vote has historically never used said app until now
said candidate is supiciously gaining a lot of traction within this region
<@!263983345669505025> the tallying was done by an app which was suspiciously funded by one of the candidates
*lets give him more money for ICE*
trump dunked on
epic own
*and also approve and sign his military plans*
yas queen rip those papers

*dab white boy dab*
Despite having little of his own
Mitt dabbing on trump to show he has principles
Urgh
its shocking how incompetent this is
if your gonna change sander votes to something else surely you would pick someone actually relevant?

we have a history of being opressed
i see it as part memorian to LGBTQ history
its strange how "british" culture adores IT crowd i tell ya
and a weird creepy view on women too
with extremely disgusting views on trans people
far away from left as you could probably get
hes like
i thought "wait are you really trying to call him a communist?"
and also its serious discussion wasnt expecting a joke lmao
no it was quite funny im just an idiot
off to the gulag i go <:sadcowboy:510303995215085569>
dam im a failure of a leftist
oh
i dont see how communism comes into play here

<3
Long as you feel safe
i think his analysis is pretty on point
https://twitter.com/ChrisKPH/status/1226902668578377733
if anyone is looking for interesting uk political analysis
why wont women sleep with me <:angery:671129788479700994>
haha woman dumb cant understand us NERDS
its the kind of basic premise which we mock big bang theory for
some of the jokes are quite yikes
watching it...
which is why when you raise minimum wage you do more than just that
cause capitalism is a fun thing
because they sure as shit wont stay stagnant
what do you think will happen to prices
right so say you gave everyone a bit extra money
but also he has a critical policy flaw. his ubi plan just flatout doesnt work the way he thinks it will
i think part of it is sidelining
if i was american i would vote bernie
the media glanced at UBI and recognised the flaws and moved on to their neoliberal masters
and also he is doing quite horribly rn
but his plans are flawed
he means well
and if ur a tory you rent it out for a much higher price or you just use it once every few months or something
sure doesnt
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
and having to sell that is shitty af
but i know a lot of people form attachments to homes
like i dont want to speak for your mum
right but there might be other things that you dont see
i dont think society is great when we say to poor people you arent allowed to keep it because the price is too high.
theres a psychology to this which is beyond "oh but if i buy this then ill be a bit in the red"
thats *why* poor people buy luxury items
thats insane
humans arent slaves to just working all day
and?
because the xbox one means you dont want to slit your wrists when you go home after a shitty day at work
a very werid example
i dont know people who buy cars on shoestring budgets... they are more concerned with food money tbh
implying first of all you would even get the job
and commuting is additional costs ontop of what you are doing
moving is extremely expensive
i know there was a  lot of boomer mentallity with people who say "if the poor wanted to live they shouldnt buy phones lmao"
not really looking at *why* you buy a phone in the first place
i know for a lot of people prices are just that high
thats... not really looking at why people are living like that
but thats not accounting the area where you live, the landlord you get
sure you might be able to live in a "cheap" house which fits in your price range
with bias that maths cant compensate for
lifes a fucky mess
becaues life isnt numbers
it really isnt a case of looking at numbers
theres also lots of other factors that will affect living on minimum and a living wage
because the invisible free hand market of ideas thingy bob doesnt like it when that happens
You need to stop this
Ok seriously
clickbait thats the word
the video title is like this on purpose btw
do not paint a great picture of him
and his actions
but the message of what he says
the content of his heart is for only him to know in what he actually believes
there is a consistency in his fuckups
it continues to be relevant
https://youtu.be/GjNILjFters this video was made around the time where pewdiepie got really mad at the media for reporting on pewdiepie being shitty
he paid people to hold up a sign saying "death to all jews"
on twitter he followed lots of alt right people
of stuff
theres a lot
and a swedish nazi
doing it "for the meme" still gets petes audience to consume a transphobe
both are equally bad
https://twitter.com/VoiceoverPete/status/1058468646593462272
And vocal tones are important as well
Body language tells a lot
You can get away with a fuckton more online
Interaction on the internet and interaction irl are two different things btw
And if you are doing this *because* you want the fights I strongly advise you talk to your therapist about this
Digital self harm is still self harm
And please reflect on what the fuck you are doing
It clearly isnt healthy
Leave the valk server and don’t go back to it
From that my educated guess would be Liberal
https://www.politiscales.net
The best way i know is either politiscales or 8scales
There’s slightly better ways but political leaning is absurdly complex
Political compasses arent the *best* way to measure where you lean
because
no no
imagine if bloomberg won as a republican in 2016
heres the thing
and so are american liberals
democrats are a bit touchy when it comes to bernie
you see
and honestly Trump has so much ammo if Bernie gets robbed from rigged delegates, missing and extremely delayed votes, corruption in electronic voting and not to mention if the super delegates decide to not back bernie
its very hard to miss what the Democrats are doing to try and throw the nomination away from Bernie
https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/1229767823595012096?s=21 when you agree with the man you hate the most
no shit PCs are pretty damm important
*this PC isnt working for me thus I should stop using computers ever*
ok can you comprehend the leap of logic you just made
but if starmer wins the american equivalent would be Trump vs Pete or someone similar
not yet
Corbyn was what we got when we tried to go left. Media and party gunning him down
well ever since tony blair Labour has been divided on if it wanted to be a neolib group or an actual left group
essentially what it boiled down to is "if you thought labour lost because of socialism, vote Starmer. If you thought they lost because of Brexit, vote RLB"
and i think its one of the best ones out there
i posted a while ago an analysis from a tory mp on the labour leadership elections rn
considering the tory landslide
maybe a bit more tbh
right now the national mood is still kinda 50/50
complicated
its
not to mention the country is headed towards a financial disaster
but we wont get shit
we can kick up a fuss on what we want
the eu holds all the cards in the deal making rn
i mean id rather not beat around the bush on how we *aquired* these artifacts
i dont check in on bbc too much ngl
yeah the shit we stole
i dont recall one existing tbh
i dunno
like Greece for example
oh apparently we are gonna be giving back some of the shit we stole from other EU countries
considering Labour might make Blair 2 their new leader
british politics just fills me with dread
also its much easier to look at american politics rn
full disclosure, my political view is bernie is a step in the right direction
which is yikes
like reagan republican
not to mention shes been a republican most of her life
i never liked her anyway, just seemed as a shitty lite version of bernie
<a:potatotrashcan:437900359206174720>
oh boy
and pete...
because dropping out will likely take her base to bernie
but she hasnt dropped out yet
yeah warren has sunken hard
if she wins the primaries its a question of what trump will *not* use against her
my favourite native american... oh wait
the same story is true with warren
so he will try and suck away as many voters as he can
bloomberg is only running because bernie is running and doesnt want him to win
exactly
they are interchangable
with bloomberg and trump
no
you see the problem?
his comments on race and basically anything lgbtq is disgusting
but also
i mean bloomberg for starters is on Epsteins black book
so actually this would make more sense if it went like this
trump has actually been a democrat longer than bloomberg
they are accepting bloomberg
trump would just run as a democrat just as bloomberg is doing
why you get so many police shootings in america
not all police are fully trained
^
When bad laws come into place which infringe upon basic human rights for minorities, it has been the police call to enforce the rules
thats why the term "acab" exists, especially in a country such as america. When you make the call to the police as someone who is vulnerable to police violence then you are effectively rolling the dice on a "good cop" 

for minorities its *safer* to generalise because it can keep them alive. Especially when there are so many bad cops
im just tryin to explain it in a way i think sub would understand a bit better
oh im not targeting you at all brown :p
and their coworkers are implicit in the system which creates that environment, despite perhaps not holding the same shitty views
if the cop makes a mistake and kills someone they are dead and the cop will likely keep their job.
one way you can frame it
see this is why i just say im a socialist and hope my grand kids call me a right wing fuckwit
thats good old fascism for ya
im confused
did you answer your own question nevis?
democracy doesnt really exist in todays world
but i dont hear much good from the indian police force either
i dont want to speak too strongly about another country i dont live in
you are complicit
if you arent actively doing it
thats the problem
if you are a minority, everyone in the police *are* the enemy
its the thinking which the white elites have
doesnt add anything to the convo
saying thats just life
right but that sounds really dismissive of the problems that is being faced with minorities who face fear and potential death
many things will be better than what we have now
well the reason it needs to change is because it is evil?
you'll get a whole range of answers depending on the leanings of whoever you ask
depends on who you ask
well thats political philosophy right there
especially one we have now
which cannot exist with a police force
cause the system is evil
very much so
the state
or in a better word
yes
the police have stood with the oppressors
from what i would say is more modern history
and he was. in the sense that black civil rights was dangerous to the white supremacy in america
who deemed Martin Luther King a dangerous threat to America
lets not even get into the FBI
this is just batons in hand police too
since police raids on gay bars in the USA made people scared to be alive
since police back their buddies who gun down innocent kids
since police defended fascist marches in the UK during hitlers uprising
its been this bad a long time
resolution is not going to happen
is to enforce a systematically oppressive system
their job
well heres the thing
why should the police even have a monopoly on violence
*cause i study philosophy i can act pretentious now :3*
on the topic of violence actually
so a revolution
reporting a police officer does very little. not just in restoring community trust but also the police force itself will likely do little
not in the way i believe you are imagining it
not effectively
its not a system you can really reform either
could you maybe... calm down?
"investigate"
thats certainly one way to look at it
my brain is a bit too small for anything much further than that
thats the extreme of pursuing justice for the sake of vengeance or something similar
to have the murderer executed
devils advocate its the purest form of justice to say a murder victims family
so like stuff like the death penalty?
oh you mean the argument of justice vs reform?
oo
a red hat?
thats just in general tho
i try and make it my personal policy to answer questions to people who actually want to know
i mean im always open to answer questions :p
just as clarity sexuality and gender are separate spectrums of wacky :p
bi is cool
cis male/cis female/cisgendered is typically how it goes
yes you would be using the word right
or you think as in you arent sure if you are cis?
you think as in you dont know if you are using the word right
so identifying as the gender you were assigned at birth
cisgender
yeah
i was dumb enough to think i was still cis then lmao
what a callback
i remember joining here cause i just finished axz xd
actually axz ended around that december iirc
you get pinged
when you join
and forgetting those who probably left silently to lurk and never returned

:3
rady please check my join date
i think matt is just a curious child
nevis not that long tho
iirc cypher is been here a while
each gen you cut some fluff
but still a lot offluff
gen 2 was best cause it had kanto AND the new region and NEW pokemon
like gen 1 was best... but all the horrible bugs that game had, the weird system in general would be quite a bit jarring to a more modern player
id argue that unova was better
but pokemon as a thing with what people find best will always evolve due to the unnecessary parts being cut out each gen
late 2017
twas a dark period
at one point we had glitch as the only mod
probably?

Hold on a sec I think i have a decent video which explains it
I see someone missed a long discussion :p
I think there maybe be a reason he doesn’t denounce them?
Similar to how out own uk government refused to denounce an aide’s comments on Eugenics
Basically yeah thanks matt
He’s always brushing at the problem without fully getting to the meat of it
John Oliver is pretty lib ngl
And dont come back. 
Digital self harm is still self harm
Please actually do that this time
I said that last time too
Yes
Why are you still there again?
Thats one way to look at it, but its always gonna be hard to see what’s actually going on with someone
I guess honestly id just judge them based on how they behave. Certainly making your whole personality around self diagnosed neurodivergence isnt the most great thing, but I don’t fully see the problem with saying you are self diagnosed in the bio
I know theres a lot of recommendations in the autistic community to self diagnose as an adult in the uk because getting any kind of legal recognition of it is dreadful to say the least. At the very least it helps with interactions with people if you feel like you are neurodivergent
Thats true but i guess the way im seeing it is im self diagnosing this cause i really want help with this and it certainly helps if I mention to my doc “i feel like i have this because of this”
Well i do thing self diagnoses can be quite important in places where mental health services are drastically slow
:p
and watch some of Philosophy tubes older stuff
very easily skip contra points
if you want more substance id recommend someone like Shawn or Three Arrows
hes a good stepping point
its informative but i do wish there was more to it

make them scared to tell the truth
its how you keep the media in check
immedietly after the election, after countless BBC bias which painted labour as horrible, Boris Johnson called out the BBC for "anti-tory bias"
BBC is very much tory at this point
btw this is why i like looking at literally any other countries politics rather than my own

not sure complete anarchism can work on the grand scale but i can see it in smaller scales
i mean i can understand both of them. certainly havent thought about the first one till now
i dont mean that though... not really sure how id put it
what isnt opening up about your own ideology without being challenged <:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
im just trying to figure out what flavour of anarchism you actually are
i dont see how that is condemnation for all of university
Although tbf theres a lot of asian run shops here anyway cause of the immigration boom a while ago
Just come to england lmao have british stolen indian food
yeah cyberpunk is almost ancap which isnt really anarchist its just hyper capitalism
your version consists of the deaths of billions to establish a purely flat heirarchy which is wack
anarchism has a lot of flavours
there is no general anarchy mate
anprim is pretty yikes ngl

Ouch
The face his husband made
Fundamentally political ideology is complicated as fuck
Usually why i try to recommend either politiscales or 8 axes but it can only do so much
Ive seen compasses which put hitler directly middle top which is <:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
Politics is so much more complex than 2 axes of “left right” and “authoritarianism and libertarianism”
Political compass is kinda crap
Volcel police where
Executed for being too lib
Either on Twitter or the news cant remember
Some lib cried about how bernies plans involved rounding everyone up into central park to be executed
I hope everyone is prepared for central park <:TsubasaSmug:585839805737467920>
Im all for black panther esque minority groups arming themselves when shit goes south
but still
not like the nuts are thinking about that
regulation can be a double edged sword attacking minorities that own guns thats the problem
Which isnt good

> Not so much why would democrats let him start from their arm
In the eyes of the democrats, anything is better than bernie
you have to understand how messy american politics is
well
bloomberg is just trump painted blue
no
nah bloomberg will fight to the bitter end
because US politics is always <:blobpopcorn:558279430406012932>
its the democrat primary nominations
also btw polls suggest that pete voters second choice is actually Bernie
Starmer?
right of warren iirc
... i actually forgot
shes like
klobbs is a woman
or are you thinking of bloomberg
buttigeg?
klobb is klobb
super tuesday will be very interesting to watch
meanwhile Bernie is projected to win in Klobbs AND warrens state
which is to be expected considering the amount of cash hes been spending in there
bidens only gains we can see have been SC

If they want they could utterly blank us
The EU holds all the cards
Now
The reason why its taken so long is because before pushing the button we had the upper hand in negotiations
Now the EU and UK work out what their future relationship looks like
The UK has pushed the button
We are in a transition period
i dont fully remember, plus hopefully when i go to poland i will have at least a bit of tiddy so it should help
ive taken a break to looking at the us elections
too depressing rn
recently
ill be honest ive not looked into uk politics
the cunts
tories = conservative party
it would be a legal nightmare
well
i imagine they will scrounge up some crappy laws
considering the tories have a majority tho
and the next day all of those laws no longer apply
no deal is where one day we are in the eu following eu law
essentially
<:TooruShrug:384340862743871498>
my plan for no deal brexit is actually to coincidentally visit poland and just so happen to be there when no deal happens
it would put a bit of a damper on our hopeful plans when i visit her <:mmLol:361540629563703296>
she isnt in the anti lgbtq zone
probably?
well considering she runs an anime shop and plans to study abroad in japan
shes the gal who does my commissions too
iirc
i have a friend who lives somewhere near lodz
i actually really want to go to poland
poland seems fun
biden vs trump
what will the two senile old men say
even "blue dog" democrats which are democrats who run conservative policies because thats how they have to compete in southern states
from neolibs to socialists like omar
the democrat is home to pretty much all of "left" politics
because of the two party system as well
at least a while ago anyway
in the uk
the conservative party for example
keep in mind that "democrat" is just left of republicans. Many right wing parties in europe would have policies which are quite similar to what americans today call the democrat party
they dont think they are... i hope
yes
<:dab:532336272673603587>
which is why they are running trump esque candidates
Trump is better than bernie
in their mind
too soon?
plurality means as a whole i am a whole lot of things <:yuri_dab:418833805277790210>
saki you know a supermarket in the uk is actually selling that combo as a sandwich
LGBTQIA+ is what i am able to remember in my head
Belgum
And the disgusting universal credit inevitably goes mask off with its plans to slowly kill off the poor
When the nhs is melted into private firms
The uk will be a great case study on how fucked late stage capitalism is
https://twitter.com/PippaCrerar/status/1234020269343363072?s=20
Oh and **weighing the risk of production vs people dying from the corona virus**
And they are what I imagine spending that time eating popcorn watching our governments mental breakdown
The eu have plenty of time
Or who knows
Or a forced customs union border between NI and Ireland
We might see stuff like gibraltar going to spain
Before i jumped off the looking at uk politics bus, i saw that the uk would have to give up some artefacts that the brits stole to countries like greece
identify i find is more of a gender expression kind of thing
when only one of us is a horny thot and the rest of us are kinda ace
he was memed heavily during the rewatch
Just cause you cant do it doesn’t mean others cant
But to keep things short you’ll be fine
I did it a different way cause well dysphoria is a bitxh
Oh hey i have that problem too
biden
cough cough
thats also a very funny joke
to job to trump once more
and now its her turn
hillary as vp and biden has to drop off due to dementia
the real star of the show is obama calling up an emergency beat bernie meeting telling all the moderates to fall behind biden
good one hilary
thats a very funny joke
LMAO
**clinton as vp**
oh god
inb4 biden ends up becoming illegible for ....
we saw that in super tuesday
warren isnt dropping out to leech bernie votes
but i feel like thats whats being set up
you say that
biden with warren vp
hes the left wing compromise
and hell bernie isnt even that left wing
unless we get a collapse
right but i feel like in the long run we wont be getting someone like bernie again
heres the thing about biden. if he wins not much is gonna change for the country
sadly bloomberg people will just sweep to biden
thatcher is FUCKING DEAD WOOO
i cant wait till these tories take us back to the good old days of the british empire. casually revoke independence from india and yeet it back to the stone age lets go
fucking cunts
thanks british empire
considering the history of it
India is a fun casestudy
well thats one thing, obama has a lot of Christian Valuestm and the black community has always had a base of Christianity within them which is why you end up with a lot of conservative black voters
ah
voting base don religion i guess sub?
i think the word is identity politics or something?
its appearing progressive even if their policies speak the opposite
the kind of people that would vote pete because hes gay and the kind of people that vote obama because he is black are a problem
or a pete voter
not to mention i dont recall calling you a white liberal or an enemy of lgbtq+
ive seen my fair share of it and thats the way ive always described it
whiskey please
well rn theres a yuni strike
and where i live in brighton actually had a confirmed case of corona
dam we didnt even have that
ah yes a fellow nihilist
nevis i keep forgetting to ask but are you a brit too?
yeah
i mean
its the white liberal mindset
why wont the racist black people vote pete blacks must be homophobic
hes gay guys
its why people like pete
in the UK, the conservative party were the ones who legalised gay marriage. That in no way means that they are progressive in LGBT rights however
1. half the tories fuckin voted against it
2. its a great way to score brownie points.
as well as the expansion of the surveillance state which Bush left behind
not to mention btw ICE was developed under Obamas time
https://youtu.be/MAbab8aP4_A
theres also this which happened at the end of obamas term
but yeah obama will be hard to remember in the years to come in terms of what he did
and never did
theres also guantanamo bay which he totally promised to close
which trump tore apart
only real note worthy thing was obama care really
hell even got a bigger kill count than bush did
he continued the war in the middle east
which left a bitter taste in many peoples mouth
who ran as a progressive
centrist
most the reason biden is getting a portion of the black vote is specifically because he was running with obama
he will
cough cough
Cut out any future lgbtq people from being made
So maybe just make x racial group infertile in the future
Removing undesirable traits

when is your next GE if you dont mind me asking
things are a bit bleak
im just saying in the present moment
no i dont doubt you
there was deaths and mosques burning down
i mean aand india just had its krystalnacht
and now rising sinophobia problem thanks to corona
britain has a really bad islamophobia problem
if you look brown you are automatically a muslim terrorist <:pepega:504408080285564948>
in the modern day
UK it doesnt really matter all that much
i remember there was a bit of a nightmare cause JFK was Catholic
america has its layers of christianity baked into its government
but some countries less so
certainly indian politics
Would you trust the next government
Would you trust your government right now with it
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
How would you like a world where people dont come out autistic
And also removing traits *is* medical
Well thats less nukes and more uranium
does not mean they deserve that power
just because billionaire hold a fuckton of power
power != the right to have power
Because if corporations really did the maximum of what they wanted we would see a strip back of workers rights so tremendous it makes slavery look like heaven
Or what you see in most dystopias
Btw corporations making all the decisions is an ancaps wetdream
Thats how it is, but what about how it should be

<a:vigneHighFive:621477148166848512>
it works
if you arent the working class
or the weird option of no they shouldnt even bother with their "charity"
do you agree that society should be like this or that its not enough
like
well im trying to figure out where you even stand first of all
:p
thats a good place to start
im not sure what point you are arguing
it just looks big
yes but when they are doing it, the money they are giving is equivalent to me dropping pennies to a homeless man
cough cough musk cough cough gates
yeah liberals do eat that shit up
billionaires running charities is not how society should be run. especially if you consider the wealth disparity that they have
wheese
just because money can do that doesnt mean that it should tho

its naïve to think that happy employees means maximum profit
outsource to china where worker rights are non extinct
<:pepega:504408080285564948> nah fam
amazon very freely gets away with paying the minimum of tax while exploiting its workers with dirt pay
relevant video i like a lot
https://youtu.be/axN8ppre-mU
dont see why we should be accepting things the way they are
i think we should be less focusing on how to move up wealth and more on the societal issue of why there is such a disgusting gap between the two
i mean i for one enjoy licking boots <:dab:532336272673603587>
neither of those are exactly the most possible things to do for the average working class person whos making ends meet
just another word to mean smart...
thats nice and all but the world portrays a very different picture of whats happening
so i struggle to see how society is "working"
hell i have first hand experience of my family being trapped in poverty
your experience may vary
you survive
you dont become rich by flipping burgers all day
not everyone can
thats what he thinks hes saying but hes sweeping at a lot of people because hes defending the system which is keepoing much MORE people down
or people who just cant find *A* job
i also wonder why perhaps someone "isnt working"
<a:thinkingintensifies:671496797650288660>
hmm i wonder why you might struggle to get out of bed
are you sure oh my lord
this propoganda is something which every country has
...
ah indirectly calling the poor lazy i see
<:meguPuke:238539036619177985>
im going to guess laziness is somehow involved in this
and also france?
it is an incredibly small number
Carlos you are looking at maybe 0.01% of people
the propoganda is the same just changing the target
ive heard it about britain by some extremely racist conservatives :d
are you talking about... welfare?
the existence of "lazy" people is a non factor
britain has been really wack lately with its own welfare so the stories are endless
yeah sorry about that cy
the problem is the government and society
not at all
but the problem isnt lazy people
that is a sadly common tale for welfare systems
if your first reaction upon hearing someone is on welfare is "lazy" then the propoganda has worked
even if you think that it does pick and choose
it doesnt discriminate
thats why its a dehumanising and dangerous mindset
*and also kill off the poor*
all in an effort to hunt down and stop "lazy people"
where people who are dead and dying are being declared fit for work
of following through with punishing "lazy" people
hell if you want to really see the end result of this argument carlos, the UK is a great example
there is no magic "get all the people who are abusing the system" while also helping all the poor button though
the mentality is what keeps actual proper change from being done to actually help people
im sure that you do believe that, but the propoganda which you are sprouting is something which advocates for suc hthing
theres nothing in the rules about having bad takes, especially since we are all kinda just taking his arguments apart
biden is like a big fork in your gut
trump is like a machete in your gut
yeah they tend not to go mask off for a reason
https://twitter.com/BenjaminNorton/status/1235578625027698691
Also getting treatment as well is kinda hard
One black district had **one** voting machine
Also you don’t get the day off nor are you protected if you go vite
If biden is able to utterly rob the nomination from bernie a few things will happen
A lot of people will be radicalised to the left
Biden will be utterly destroyed in debates
Liberals will blame bernie supporters for not voting for trump lite

Also michigan is fun

its something funny where the tories who have spent years bleeding out the NHS are now having to oversee a pandemic which threatens its main voterbase

Well
So the idea that two people get together just to raise a kid together?

the way you said it makes it seem like your parents are just blaming "anger" on something simple like what food you eat
yeah theres a significant difference between a doctor told you and your parents told you who said the doctor told you
the way you phrased it seemed like your parents were the one who told you
"I'm not supposed to eat gluten or milk products because it apparently makes me really angry" holy shit what?
15 right?
lectric is like
https://youtu.be/fefu33e8O-0
from the convo in general chat about trans healthcare, if anyone is interested, i found a really nice video from an american doctor about how he tries to run his own clinic the best he can

Mcdonalds in the uk are all being closed down nationwide
also the article kinda looks at how marx is a great jumping off point to educate kids
teen vogue going off the walls here
https://twitter.com/TeenVogue/status/1241115549628850178
It gets more attention to show “degenerate furries grooming kids” than “grooming kids”
I don’t think its a problem unique to furries but they stand out
I think you’ll find that furries are also radically extreme in political spectrums that i find which can rub people off. Its also sadly a good place for grooming ive noticed in some areas just because of people exploring themselves finding themselves in not too good places
And investing in stock is just gambling for the middle class/rich i find. Not many people will have income *to* do that
I mean numbers in the UK are already projected to go lower then 1929 levels of bad
And even then their black hearts are focused on saving the economy
And these cunts who have told the public constantly to not trust experts, to not trust anyone who isnt british and to uphold English valued are now having to forcefully undo all of that propoganda just so the country doesn’t have a crisis worse than Italys
Because the tories have been hanging the nhs and bleeding it try to slowly sell it off
A british junior doctor ive been watching has recently said that “we are getting more support for the nhs now then we have ever had in the last 7 years”
Its been dead for ages
Politicians who campaigned for leave are surprised that the public aren’t listening to experts
I read a satire headline recently which is a bit of a depressing analysis on what might be happening with the public
And theres still shady cunts who are ignoring all of that, telling their staff to come in anyway despite not being necessary
So much so that lockdown is being enforced
Not to mention huge swathes of the population utterly ignoring any kind of government advice
Nhs staff being evicted from their own houses because they might catch corona
Its sabotage
Nhs staff being mugged at knifepoint for their ids cause nhs staff can access shops earlier
Had a gang of 5 people drill ambulance tires on cctv
The British people have been acting like fucking savage animals recently

its taken him about a week to go from "well its looking like business as usual" to "im starting to see some covid-19 cases, nothing too major" to his most recent video which was... kinda heart tearing despite him saying not much on what hes seen
if anyone has been watching Dr Hope like i know someone has said they did
it really do be like that
actually i think rat is a better word

inb4 dmed a gore vid
And i dont see how its any better because it wasn’t actually gore
Im sad i dont have the vocabulary on me right now to express how abhorrent it is
Its an absolute disgusting prank
What does that tell you
Ok if any mod did this in this server its not a question of if they would be banned but how fast
What if it actually was gore?
What, were you gonna personally watch it to find out?
... you had every right to suspect it was gore
So you’ve left the server rightv
Thats disgusting behaviour
So you’ve banned him right?
Exactly
Thats... still kinda absolutely dicky

and how little will people remember history
what remains is how much damage will be done
as sad as whats happening in india is right now I expected this when Kashmir had their lights taken out
It was a sign of things to come
We dont want muslims in the country
was ultimately
Right but what the government is trying to tell the public and the media with that bill
i think its visible now that it wasnt ever about "but they can go to muslim countries" it was about sending a message
i hope you've changed your mind btw on just how bad that refugee bill that blocked muslims really was
as it turns out propaganda to make the working class divided based on religion and race is a great power move especially if you want to eradicate one of the religions
its been getting worse for a really long time. it takes time to breed this sentiment into the people
and its just more visible now
and also while part of the blame will lie on this islamic organisation the main issue isnt "this group behaved badly" but the government has fostered islamophobia in india
the ruling party has the ability to crack down on disgusting islamophobia in the media. the fact that it exists in culture says something about the government
in india
yeah
I saw a story of muslims being told to leave a public hospital to go to a private one which resulted in a death

Its hard to actually keep with the reality of today when absolutely disgusting shit like this is something i *expect*
🙃
You hear much about the prisoners?
I imagine the dead in NY are being covered up to an extent
Is lagging behind hard
The death rate keep in mind
More people have died from Corona than they have from 9/11 I saw
Well who knows what way they would’ve gone huh
Those lower income areas that weren’t able to vote due to a variety of different reasons
Well we can tell that based on those that were actually able to vote
🤔 indeed i do wonder that
Its just a more convenient form of voter supression for them
They were forced to keep it going by the dnc
States did try and shut it down
Wow not even the dnc are forcing primaries to go through anyway despite a pandemic?
To say otherwise is a bit absurd at this point given everything the dnc has done
I mean yeah... cause thats what happened
He doesn’t have to insinuate
And also a great example of just how bad the dnc have fucked up
And here we see trump cheering for the democats willingness to let him serve another 4 years
I mean ultimately i don’t really see america lasting 8-12 years of right wing politica
The supreme court can always be changed. The limits on the sc only having 9 people is convention
Never said i was
Nobody is fine with it
They’ve set up Iran nice and well
There’s rumours that america is planning an invasion of Venezuela
I mean thats a fact. America has it all
Concentration camps
Insanely heavy propaganda
A government willing to fight stupid wars
Historians will look back at this time the same way we look at nazi germany prior to world war 2
But im not fully convinced
A lot of blood will be shed and i hope people wake up to realise why its happening
Cant believe i have to say that when there’s concentration camps in America
Or before it caves in to the extremities of fascism
How long can society stand to be fucked before it breaks apart
His chances are slim
We are presumimg that biden can even beat trump btw
America wont survive 4 years of nothing to minor harm then 4-8 years of more republicans
Ofc but long term voting in biden will be locking out someone like bernie or someone whos even more left wing than him
the american healthcare system is far too cursed <:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>

dont see why your preference is something you need to justify
i am bewildered to see why it isnt unless you harbour a deep resentment of women
that is perfectly valid
how the fuck is that sexist
what?!
wh
Id just like to swing back a little bit and say that long waiting lists under the nhs is a problem due to a highly capitalist political party slowly privatising the crown jewel which has been finding it pretty easy to severely neglect areas such as mental health. They have the money to pay for it as well as the means to pay for it considering the disturbing amount of both tax evasion and tax exceptions big businesses and billionaires get under the tories but surprise surprise tories dont want that
Turns out by defunding the nhs and bleeding it dry means you can’t make *everything* free
Yeah what the nhs covers depends a lot
Repeating the manta is pretty important
Because you don’t wana half arse it
Debunking pragerU takes much more effort and research than what they put into their vids
Two major political parties is surprisingly not enough to represent the entire country
Especially America
One major problem is the countries themselves

Trump ceasing funding to WHO
Especially since trans people have been around for much longer than the internet
You might see or know a lot of trans women who like anime but that doesn’t mean that its predominantly that
I see a lot of asian people thus the conclusion is there is a majority of asian people in the UK
right but the way you are saying it makes it seem like both sides are responsible for the violence which happened. so the muslim and hindis are both responsible for the massive spikes of increased violence against muslims commited by hindi nationalists
blaming both sides for the violence
"there was so much violence was because both sides propagated bad info"
they are not exactly comparable
im not a big fan of both siding this
right but in a country which is basically waiting for the spark to light all of that islamophobic sentiment, you really think a bill which contains a block of muslim refugees is *not* gonna do something?
I wouldnt exactly take modis word on the bill
especially to the people eager to express their islamophobic sentiments
its the phrasing that was certainly sent around
is Kashmir and the blocking muslim refugees bill
the really big incidents which reached a more global spotlight i would say
indian islamophobia is something which takes time to foster
Yes i know
needing people to sit down, shut up and believe what they are told
thats what makes a majority for these people
its never a majority. its people who actually believe his fascist doctrine , people who have brought into propoganda, and people who are just following orders
its more apt to say that hes fanning the flames i suppose
a lot of mosques have been burned down
modi is the ignition which is lighting the fuel
the police in india have turned a blind eye to a disturbing amount of violence against indians. one such case was a university which was basically raided by the public and the police stood back and let it happen
Trump doesnt have to be islamophobic every day for his racism to affect america
one thing to note as well more recently with Modi, he has been riling up anti-islamic sentiment with propoganda and how hes been acting
because its just *so* great to see nazi germany 2, indian boogaloo
but i know bits and pieces of indian politics
sub is the indian
I am a bangladeshi-british
I am not an indian
So just to clarify
<:TransHeart:615586390377365535>
well iirc he was very injury prone
vince hasnt learned much from Benoit and Punk
but thats unlikely
well hopefully he gets fucking treated like a human now that he has a title
~~i mean both of those matches were infinite finisher matches~~
oh im mixing things up whoops
he was always gonna fight golberg
oh drew was the rumble winner
Like for example Roman Reigns supposed to fight Brock Lesnar for the championship, but for obvious reasons he cant expose himeslf
but at the same time a lot of the story lines they have been setting up have been cut off and beaten down purely because some wrestlers are super vulnerable
so the acting portion has been increased
well due to having no audience and all being in the same place they are basically able to do multiple cuts as well as use ad breaks to reposition and sort everything out
but i imagine they are bleeding money out
wrestlemania with no audience was surreal at least
which is good because the way they treat their employees is disturbing
thankfully a lot more competitors are popping up to fight WWE
was it NXT people or did he release like proper main roster WWE wrestlers?
which had very minimal government intervention
which is no matter what we think, the end result was that there was a spike of islamophobic violence
we can spend a long time arguing this, but i think we should try and bring it back to what we were talking about
sorry, dont mean to imply that you did say that
its not justification for increased violence against the muslim populus
sure they are acting dumb
its like with the whole muslim group acting dumb
so the exact same severity as that meme portrays?
I wouldnt call an image from what i would wager money was made in a chan bord research
ok ima dip then
you are underaged no?
i just wana clarify
also
porn is entirely subjective because if you really wana push the boundaries, masturbating to a picture of your SO is pornography
porn bad its a sin
right
or is it masturbation fucks your brain
having sex fucks your brain?
To where I can do the bare minimum to survive
Whatever executive function I had was scorched off of me
Not even sure if i am already a husk or if the vultures of my torment pick at the bones of whats left of me
Now I know that i was just hoping for that to happen. Because the alternative was to survive and fear for the next time I lose chunks of myself
Every time i break I fear it will be the last. That I’ll just turn into a depressing goo and dissolve away into a husk
My brains a fucking champ with the amount of shit its repressed, the countless number of times its forced itself to just detatch from reality to save itself and even glue back whats left after mental breakdown after mental breakdown
Its disturbing just how well the brain is able to just block out the things that would drive one insane many times over
I imagine its not the most welcoming place of lgbt people
~~wow rude~~
<@504069701911969803> oh yeah the labour leaks thats some funny shite

Burnout is harsh and sometimes the best advice is just to ride it out
/s
but yes those RL friendships were way more important than the friends made online
meanwhile the toxic people i meet online i block
one of whom was pretty toxic to me
the rest of them turned out to be assholes
i am still only friends with 3 and i mainly talk to them online
of all the friends i made in highschool
i mean if i may use an example
> there is one best way to do everything
the trans community would strongly disagree on that
i mean its all gonna depend on you and how you like friendships. guess what
theres only one way to find that out and it isnt by only listening to the one bit of advice you were given and taking that as the doctrine for right and wrong

I feel like by now you should have realised that not everything your parents says is actually worth anything
As depressing as that sounds
Like this is mild tbh
Best thing you can do is show his fans that hes a dick... altho weebs have a tenancy of not caring
You are but one number
Btw it really isnt worth disliking all of his vids
But who is he tho
Who is this again?
https://youtu.be/nxeB2AXIG3E good video about the topic if you want
going back to the article, the depressing thing is that trans youth healthcare is already tremendously miserable due to NHS cuts and defunding from the tory government anyway
both are bad, ones just extremely racist
yeah are we talking death penalties for heavy war crimes or death penalties for being inconvenient for white people
or at the very least before the real gay liberation campaigns
before stonewall trans and gay people were kinda lumped together i found reading stuff back then
if that makes sense
im thinking more of how feminist groups kinda move in waves to achieve the rights they should have. like i think the abortion argument in the uk is non existent compared to the terf position
sorry i phrased it kinda bad
try being the key word
wheras in the UK we try to pretend we have a sense of decorum
because its much easier to go "i think they are abominations" than to use feminist language for example
i think its why america dont have that much terfs
dont need to dog whistle bigotry like that
i cant imagine india has much of a massive feminist group much less any form of terf group
its a term used for transphobes who use feminist language to protest against trans rights
trans exclusionary radical feminists
UK terfs probably celebrating that the party of bigots is catering to them
https://www.gaystarnews.com/article/uk-launches-unprecedented-attack-on-trans-rights-will-ban-transition-before-18/ <:sadcowboy:510303995215085569>
i mean in a way they are playing to a heteronormative society rather than allowing themselves to openly express gayness
see i had someone explain this in a super easy way but ive forgotten it
dont really remember tbh
yeah
he was a democrat primary candidate
but a good public example is someone like Pete Buttigieg
not to say all of course
cis gay men in more modern times have often basically become the "token gay" which are "accepted" in society
http://chng.it/ZRGrpxnMKw
Did you by chance read it?
Oh i posted that yesterday
<:disgust:606954297665650688>
So why would that data even matter if for the sake of argument you smoked weed and literally nothing happened
> what if I say fuck it and smoke weed and then some new data comes out that smoking any amount of weed causes hearing loss

No study or research data in the world can 100% predict what anything will do to you, let alone weed
Well with regards to the uk it depends on how white you are tbh
https://youtu.be/VPX2fWgoiyg
<:mugi_peek:396854508149276672> im throwing my one bit of thingy in the GS discourse with a pretty long video i watched which it is much more worse than just a rape scene
weirdly my girlfriend was trans and also said she was a lesbian and was also madly in love with me didnt tip me off to the fact that i was a girl <:LilyPTSD:536167110309838848>
although my journey to "i might be trans" to "ok im a trans girl" was long and rough because F
i like to imagine if i came here much earlier i probably wouldve realised i was trans earlier
> Like I actively resisted realizing I was bi until very recently because a lot of the LGBT people I met during high school and college were really judgmental. I think if I had met people like you guys before I would have realized much sooner.
<:huggo:532336272740581377>
i see...
(unrelated but why are you "!!"?)
truscum is another word for it because they are scum
so that is the process of taking drugs to cause permanent change to the body
HRT is hormone replacement therapy
if you dont snip the 🍆 you arent a trans woman
so one more radical example is surgery
trans medicalists are people who believe that there is some form of "medical" requirement to be considered trans
another example is men infiltrating lesbian and women spaces
one example is the idea of "Lesbian Erasure"
so TERFs are transphobes who use feminist language to "debunk" the trans people
Lesbian TERFs, Trans Transmedicalists and so on
sadly even within the LGBTQ+ community you will have that hierarchy of oppression <:sadcowboy:510303995215085569>
with lgbt people do you mean like the spectrum of the lgbt community or were you meeting like a predominantly amount of x
or rather very modern
one thing id like to throw in is that the evolution of trans language is really new
which is deeply fascinating to discover
theres someone who extremely loves gear, really loves the music which resonates with impactful scenes, really likes tsubasa and was likely the person who joined the server too and is possibly someone who wants to be a symphogear user too
listening to a lot of symphogear music more recently has actually given me some insight on that actually
because being in a kinda blended/disassociated blob of confusion is unfun
altho i guess at the same time we are like using a lot of our brain power to figure out whomst we are
better to find what you find comfortable with and working towards that than trying to pin it down
yeah
its crazy how my life has gone from "wow im neurodivergant i need to work out who and what i am" to "what is my sexuality i need to work out who and what i am" to gender to the very persons we be <:AiPTSD:528750139071004672>
if we wana fuck we will fuck
its just
has flipped back and forth between so many different things that we stopped bothering
the one girl thats actually properly invested into sex things
but also like
one reason is that its not just mine its ours and thats fun to deal with
i dont really like to pin down my current sexuality
nowadays im like sexuality is whatever it rolls to be lmao but now back then it was just "wait but the idea of sex makes me uncomfortable does that mean im ace?"
i actually had a problem where i focused too much on my sexuality over my gender
p og
at that point i was just repressing everything because i was mostly there in figuring that yes im trans but i cant do shit about it till now
we had like two other people try to explain actual like lgbtq+ things but like
and sexist as fuck
super weird
it was
yeah
we had a speaker who came in all like "girls have spaghett brains boys have waffle brain"
we had some fucking bad takes
and even then
we didnt really touch lgbtq till fuckin A levels tbh
i mean even in the UK our sex ed was just... safe sex
americans dont have fun with sex ed i hear
political compass subreddit is super up and down i see
doubt
err
up-down is state or "freedom" or that area, where left-right is economics
as much as i hate it, the political compass is actually good at showing the differences
anarcho capitalists
i meant
sorry
because theres some weirdos who are anarcho communists
> aka a society without any arbitrary system of class
not really anarchism but it can be. its a different spectrum the idea of state vs no state and the idea of hierarchy and class
this line of thinking sounds extremely victim blamey
all violence is not equal
"which is why I don't like talking to leftists because they usually don't understand this and think they can make everything a fucking utopia."
thats a very conservative/right wing mindset there
Well if you equate every single life as equal push that to the extremity because theres a big difference between 5 random people vs 5 young minorities
In this situation is it better for the kids to die and not endanger everyone or do you try and save the kids
You have a gun
6 transphobes are armed with machetes and are about to murder 5 trans kids.
Let me take your example and change it up
to be more specific its Utilitarianism
sadly i do not understand polish, mind explainin a bit more
?
https://freedomhouse.org/report/nations-transit/2020/dropping-democratic-facade <@!203444794737950720>
whats depressing is that theres gonna be people whos gonna bat for it just like they batted for Shield hero, Goblin Slayer and countless other super problematic shows
making shield hero look like a fuckin botched firework
i was told about this months ago
oh boy
or something?
the healer one?
oh was that
which one is that
you know despite reading quite a lot of komi i remember fuck all about it
the best representation i feel which was pretty big was Zombielandsaga in more recent memory
the big ones off the top of my head was Steins gate ||protagonist constantly saying "but hes a guy"|| and re;zero ||with "felix" in the anime being portrayed as the stereotypical tr*p character||
oh going back quite a bit, <@!213645184125239317> the reason why i kinda said that the list of things that do the whole "trans but they arent" is disturbingly long. i binge through a lot of mangas so i find its common to find the "but gasp they are a guy with a PP the horror" in fantasy stuff
there was the whole scene with ||kazuma trying to sleep next to megumin in her room||
weirdly enough that was only one of the really horrible shit in the movie as well
<:huggo:532336272740581377>
god i cant even begin to imagine being trans and going into the ks movie blind
" konosuba is either the funniest thing ever or the most offensive thing in existence based on your personal views and taste." If your sense of comedy finds "heehoo girl has penis and protagonist is freaking out about it" funny i feel like theres a deeper problem than if the show was funny or not xd
So everyone in harry potter
Ive been feeling that since Super Tuesday
and because of that technicality the show uses that as a moral justification for his actions
he ends up with more slave kids
nah instead not only do they get the slave mark on her again
it cant decide what it wants
while also trying to portray him as an anti-hero
the show really wants to you see that
even if shes all googley eyes with nao
especially since just by being a slave, Raph has no way to consent to anything that she has to go through
if you are gonna have your character do evil stuff you should commit to it rather try heavily to justify it
> In kaifuku you’re supposed to cheer on the mc
i mean that kinda portrayal was why i think shield hero is utter trash. I remember watching the scene where the monarchy was like "today we are gonna take away your child slave you have" and the shows trying to make it out like they are being absolutely unforgivable. Instead of perhaps realising having a child slave and raising her to fight for you is pretty yikes
was terraformars the really racist anime?
i mean the better option is to not have it be adapted in the first place tbh
i fear the day that re:monsters gets adapted
k
slaves so he can fight and save the world!!
he does some bad but its all to do good
?
that is... not at all what we are saying at all
again that is irrelevant
just because its fiction does not absolve it of any of the problems it has
sadly as that sentence is
not could. was
remember when that vic guy was accused of being a creep and a lot of weebs started calling him the shield hero?
https://youtu.be/AxV8gAGmbtk relevant video about this i feel
the world of the show is fictional. with that, the control of what is presented is in the authors hand
thats why the show is bad
it isnt but the show really wants you to believe it is
slavery? thats fine because he saved a dying girl and she wants to be a slave anyway and he doesnt treat her bad at all
nothing in fiction exists until the writer makes it so. the world was created in such a way to make the shield hero as justifiable in their actions as possible
theres no moral ambiguity portrayed in the show with his actions. he is in the right and everyone is in the wrong
if naofumi really didnt want it he shouldn't have done so. it just sets up a thing way down the line where if you want to be part of naofumis loli slave harem group you need to sell your fucking freedom away
if you accept that a show can have a positive take away, whats hard to accept about a show having a negative take away
if the show was a dumb shonen then it shouldnt have had the impact it did in terms of the vic case
and how its portrayed in the show is something thats also created
was created
the world which accomidates what he has done
his decisions were made by the author
again. that means nothing. he was put in that situation by the author
or were you supposed to sympathise with the princess trying to steal away raphtalia
i mean especially so since the world is so cartoonishly evil towards the shield hero
i fail to see how me being in the contrived example which the show puts nao in is anyway relevant to what we are talking about
it wants you to be on the heros side
because ofc it would
well the show justifies it in its own way
throwing sand in peoples eyes as a battle tactic and owning child slaves to fight for you are not proportional
because as rephrehensible as ver is, he is not portrayed as the progaonist hero
but thats probably a convo for another time
and kept with it in AXZ and XV
oh yeah very much so
he is the shield hero after all
is ver somehow more complex than naofumi?
nobody ever said that was good
the rest is just justification for being written that way
naofumi and raphtalia are not real people. at all. these ideas of "what if it was stockholm syndrome" doesnt matter at all in this convo because she doesnt actually exist but is a fictitious person being directed by another person. if raphtalia wanted to be a free girl and naofumi wanted to not be a slave owner its not on *them* to do so its on the *author*
i wouldnt potray naofumi as the hero and i wouldnt potray the child slave as someone who wants to fuck naofumi because he saved me and hes so cool
i was gonna use the term racism but i thought bigot would make more sense
i didnt expect to have to explain it
i really was just... using a word
then also made an "apology" video which tried to label a lot of the critism they recieved as "well they could be trans people or nazis pretending to be trans people who really knows" and then quadruple downing on Buck actually being a good person
then doubled down when people pointed out how bad of a person Buck was
the reason why a lot of trans spaces dislike her was because she promoted and featured a very well known transmedicalist named Buck Angel
in a very theatrical way
and contrapoints is a fairly large trans youtuber who makes videos about political topics
so people on the autistic spectrum for example
abelism is being bigoted towards disabled people
but i felt i should post that thread there just so it might reach someone who can see a new perspective on contra
public anime servers arent the most constructive place to have discourse lmao
i mean i think this is the first time something like this kind of topic has been brought up in quite a while
and especially since she wont really be called out on it due to her size
it just sucks having what people perceive as a big trans voice for the community is really harmful too
ableism and in general bigotry has no political boundaries
https://twitter.com/ifeelthewind/status/1259724955626938368?s=20
because at the end of the day its also a philosophical question of what you believe
thats just one of many ways to think about politics
so despite me being probably more left wing than corbyn, i would likely vote for him for example
so its just which candidate would you idealy vote for
knowing exactly where you are politically matters much less if you still believe in the electoral system
but even beyond that
the best i know was the 8scales or the politiscales test
its just finding out what you like
well compasses and tests arent accurate ways to determine political ideology really
if you are in latin america your worst enemy is the CIA
communism is a very divisive subject
probably not?
at the end of the day, we are all just trying to explore our own identities and who we are in this harsh world
at this point theres a shit ton of misinformation being flung around
*if* you get to it
well
going back to her, if you think shes a weird person it can take away from her actual point once you get to it
because the association of weird is in the same roots as bad in the mind
thinking something as weird has a bad connotation to it
ive seen people describe my own plurality as weird so forgive me if im sensitive about that
you dont hear her point first. you hear why her point should be invalid
cause whats happened is a wildfire of misinformation
ive seen people genuinely believe that her message was we should ban and remove all vc from games
capital G Gamers don't really want a conversation about how games can be more accessible and how VC can be a barrier to that
lets avoid words like weird to describe what they do cause i dont think we have much ground to judge another person and their actions
she eats grass
shes a deer
shes antagonistic
instead we are talking about
the whole attacking her has pretty much worked btw. nobody really is talking bout her point about accessibility in games
the real Gamer keemstar edging on his seat looking for the next Gamergate to happen
beyond that is just character assassination
or to be more specific, tried but flubbed a message about how VC is a barrier for people in gaming
and spoke up about Gamers
i think it was also partly cause shes trans?
from what ive seen of what you said it almost sounds like he has tremendously bad intentions
hope yall are doing ok kaiyo
content warning
i said could <:GarieWink:336657101273169921>
:p
i feel like a lot of trans people could tell you, myself included, that our own minds and bodies are a confusing mess
the human psyche is absurdly complex
this is just more fuel to the fire
i mean we are calling them creepy already based on previous knowledge of their character
is this the creepy friend or someone else
a normal picture of you
just like
what kind of pic
ok i think i need to ask this but
Any amount of transphobia is disgusting
a subreddit that claims to make its home for all but in reality is very accommodating to the far right
what subs are they if you dont mind me asking
Because we dont get someone left of biden after he wins
The courts either move further right or dont move and then when trump 2 gets elected, they move further right
What will biden do when republicans do the exact same thing they did with obama and refuse to hold a vote
No he will throw in the middle of the ground justice which will ultimately do nothing except agree with what the conservative justiciary will do anyway because biden has no spine to actually do something radical about the court system
What by electing a moderate?
How is biden going to change that?
Courts are irrelevant at this point
What he will do is lay the foundation for trumps replacement to repeat 2012
We are working on the assumption that biden will actually do anything substantial to undo anything trump has done
Which is pretty unacceptable tbh
He isn’t trump by the most barest of margins
Except this time will be much worse for them
Trump campaign tweets arent the greatest source for info but one thing for sure is they are already capitalising on Biden alienating black voters
Oh right i heard about that
Huh
Oh you in his constituency?
Id love to have a proper convo with corbyn one day. Just like talk about stuff
On the topic of black support
Bout as pathetic as democrats tbh
Also lib dems is a political party in the uk
Why did you say the same word twice
God those replies are cursed
As well as democrats forcing primaries to stay open during covid
That just says the percentage that was old, nothing about the turn out of young people?
I know a friend of mine in michigan who was queuing for an hour trying to vote. During school time
Primaries in general have less voter turn out. Not to mention there was a bit of a covid thing happening
Also, young people did turn out to vote for bernie?
What has joe done to appeal to young pe
Let alone my own
Not with joes attitude
A lot of young people aren’t gonna be turning out to vote Joe fucking Biden now are they
I dont follow that logic
No they did not
That was uncalled for
Please do
We cant just rewind back to 2012
And the person who beats Biden will be much worse than Trump
I mean the long term with Biden is after his first term, the republicans run someone who will quite easily wipe the floor with a moderate democrat who will do nothing
Cause ultimately id rather build a better foundation for other people than myself in the short term
When faced with such a disgusting option I prefer to think long term
For starters im seriously not convinced biden is “keeping it the same”
To boil it down to just “keeping it the same vs getting worse”
Its much more complicated than that
Harm reduction?
It will be significantly harder to try and have a bernie like candidate against a democrat who’s incumbent
Did you not see the effort americans put in towards Bernie?!
Feel like this sums up my feelings on this topic but with young people replacing black
It’s disturbing how blatant voter suppression can be in America
Especially if you live in a southern state
Double make sure
Like forget “liberatarian” Notch is a fullblown alt-right nazi
Most Gamers dont even touch that shit
You missed the QAnon conspiracy theorist part
That said I wouldn’t vote the implied “yes i like notch” button in a poll just because of spite of the person who ran it? Like no shit they wanted to gather attention to it. Its surprisingly not common knowledge how much of an ass notch actually is
Notch being transphobic is actually not even the most horrible fucked up thing about him all things considered
digital self harm is still self harm
you can see that because democrats who control the legislative branch of the US quite happily sign off on a significant proportion of trumps bills
discussion can only go so far i think. If your opposition party is for example people like the Republican party you are extremely unlikely to achieve a good form of compromise to achieve political goals
but that in comparison america has it tremendously worse
cough cough hungary cough cough refugee crisis
not to say that europe doesnt have its share of problems with the right
the american political overton window is extreme degrees of right further than what is seen in europe
if they called themselves nazis, people would realise they are full of absolute shite
the right change their language to hide what they really are
neo-nazis essentially
and i see you repeat that same sort of rhetoric that i saw this one thing about this group and now im suddenly conflicted about an entire group of people. exactly how it works
Lectric using that as justification for doing horrible things to trans people is what extremely transphobic people do. They take a small number of trans people who act maliciously and use that as their basis for an all out attack. No shit they are horrible people, but the problem comes from people using that extremely small minority of people as justification for trans people bad
Ive heard good things bout trauma therapists
<:trans_hug:513029326002847745>
And even *then* MLK was subject to a lot of violence. Fuck even assassinated
Not to say the black panthers didn’t do any good, i mean fuck they did a fuckton for black communities. But force a white liberal who’s accepting of the status quo of segregation and tell them to choose between mlk and malcom x
On the topic of violence, one can argue that the reason MLK was quite successful can be because of more radical groups such as the Black Panthers
At this point its less ignorance. Its not like its been a short period of time for BLM to make a rise
Yuck
What are you talking about MLK waved a magic wand and racism stopped existinr
Im somehow missing the time period where I thought he was actually dead and it was not being reported
Joe “every day a new disaster I shall make” Biden
i thought you were gonna stop going on 4chan?
Where are you even getting this from?

Absolutely fucking rude please dont put words in my mouth
Im sure Mr Target isnt wiping his tears with the money he has lost
There is no room for similarities between a big ass chain like target compared to a small black business
???
In response to peaceful protests being met with tear gas from the police, the protesters got more violent
Forgive me, i was just going off the video rather than anything else
it shows the attitude of the cops where a reporter gets arrested before an officer who committed a cruel act of murder
who was quite quickly released afterwards because the idiots in charge released they made a massive cockup
it was a single black reporter who was arrested on tv
frankly its disturbing that its only now twitter is showing teeth against him
twitter knows this and trump knows this but trump *needs* twitter
executive orders dont have *that* much power
Peaceful protest either leads to change or it escalates.
It escalated. Because it didn’t work
Civility stops when you boldly claim i am just anti white
Enjoy being bitter by yourself
Out of here
Sorry im done go fuck yourself that was disgusting
Fuck ofd
Scared for their fucking lives cause one of theirs keeps getting murdered
You ever stop to think how perhaps...
THATS HOW THE BLACK COMMUNITY IS CURRENTLY FEELING ABOUT THE COPS RIGHT NOW
Is that the black gas mask dude or a new one mel?
Are we back to square one?
Not even to mention legal slavery with the war on drugs and the black prison population
Its been a disturbingly short time without segregation or slavery
Oh yeah the scars of slavery are far from even be being healed
The worst part is from what ive heard is they’ve been charged with Manslaughter
If you want a modern example of peaceful protest not working
You might want to tell Jews living in Nazi Germany how that went for them
Depressingly, even if they arrested him for 2nd degree murder (or possibly even first degree given the nature of the case) he would likely walk free
I think the better term is Voluntary Manslaughter. Not too familiar with america but thats what im reading
Except those that the police have caused significant harm too
It was a special Target too which focused heavily on “loss prevention” no?
Iirc i saw that a lot of the looted supplies is being distributed across the community
I understand
No its ok
Your system member said they were going for trauma therapy right?
Yeah i know that feeling all too well
No I understand that
Whats up Meiyi?
Its good that you are able to speak and share your feelings, even if they feel so overwhelming that you have to numb them
Are you the only drinker?
are you thinking about the milkshaking of prominent far right figures?
terrorists are easier to justify police intervention such as spying. thus the conservative governments been quite happy to get their enemies listed as threats to the state
the uk is very cursed

one of the few events where people are even allowed to express themselves
theres also the thing where a lot of pride events happen around this month
i dont think christmas is that good of a comparison because one is quite a lot more commodified than the other. pride helps at least bring awareness to LGBTQ+ suffering i feel
well theres criticism to be made about the corporatisation of pride month but i dont feel like thats the argument you are making...
Because straight people aren’t treated the same
Straight pride is what every month is

Id take any risk of DIY over taking my life or waiting an eternity on the NHS. Lot of trans peeps, not just in the uk, make that call cause life kinda sucks :(
The main thing thats changed is the scale. Black people still fighting to just be equal and still getting shot, arrested, beaten down, and gassed for wanting such
And fuck for all he did he got shot and the fascists just had to do a racism less in the open
We look back at those times a bit less for what they really were. Angry black man and his mob triggering more radical call for change
Yes
During the time he was alive, he had a 75% disapproval rate in the country
Fun fact about MLK tho
Maybe those elections get held off
Which is to say anything goes
https://twitter.com/brett_mcgurk/status/1267662905383596032?s=19
Sanders had resigned himself behind Biden. At the end of the day he believes in the system which I feel is what got him in the end
Now its just a depressing reminder that all of this chaos is leading to either a trump dictatorship or a biden presidency
I lowkey miss when Biden was gatekeeping black people and having white people defend how those comments were just jokes
i mainly wanted the video from the tweet, not the tweet itself
i think theres a bigger problem of teaching police to shoot somewhere else which still has a decent fatality rate over addressing the main concern people have that police are shooting and killing people in the first place

..
A society where you are born and you are told because of a certain trait you are born with (lets say primary sex organ) you are a garfield fan
One way ive had it explain is with the garfield analogy
no u
i mean yeah but you hang out with a lot of queer folk :3
i mean if you are comfortable with your gender identity its very valid to find it uncomfortable if someone questions it when you are sure yourself
Im onto them its a garfield conspiracy
But being a “man” is the same level as being a “garfield fan” 
Its subjective what it means but society wants to push one way to do so.
Garfield is just an example you can appropriate
Even the very nature of gendered colours
I mean fuck a lot of women fashion today is what masculine manly men wore way back when
Cultures had tremendously different ideas on “masculine” or “feminine” traits
Gender is just what we present to society
People with dicks must love garfield
Well you would get backlash from society because you have to be a garfield fan
Or perhaps its fridays that deserve the most hate
But what if you aint a garfield fan? Maybe you think ravioli is superior
And are encouraged to bully dogs or whatever stuff garfield does
So you must hate mondays and love lasagna
Ill spoiler tag it cause some distressing pics

<@!263983345669505025> funny you say that because I recently found something related to sweden just recently
Me and my fiancee are both plural and are quite confident to diagnose ourselves with CPTSD
I know it varies quite a lot from system to system but my understanding of how systems develop is slightly based in trauma
Apolitical
I play apolitical games like Metal Gear Solid
> *nothing* in Call of Duty, Battlefield, or any movie is not  made without express approval from the US military
That would explain the highway of death revisionism huh
Drugs interact differently with the body it turns out and there hasn’t been enough studies I feel
Some people have a small smoke and have drug based psychosis which might not go away. Some people take a fuckton and turn out perfectly fine
> I've heard doing weed before 25 causes serious mental growth issues
<:itvaries:625803433060073473>
Apparently John Olivers vid about police recently is pretty good too
Those 4 have certainly been charged but the police brutality never ended. Infact the protests that led to them being arrested alone had severe amounts of police brutality and injustices  <:sadcowboy:510303995215085569>
I see you too watched John Olivers video about Police?
Marxism is when you draw big tiddied girls wearing a rainbow
and that means he has an audience for his hateful rhetoric
well hes got a lot of attention now
theres valid critisism to be made about how lesbian and gay relationships in anime are often portrayed unhealthy or just tokenistic. but i doubt thats the point hes making
they were fine with it when it was just in the back of their minds, only implied and not developed beyond small scenes
as soon as the gay is made more obvious they have to then confront the fact that they dont find healthy gay relationships comfortable
Same root here. All countries are bad!
Kinda like saying all lives matter
And it just reads as deflecting us criticism
Theres is truth to that statement that America would technically be better but its a super low bar and a bad comparison
Climate change coming in with the steel chair

Dope
I just think about mundane shit
Well its kinda late, but like just make your brain occupied
Yeah it do be like that
*just switch lul*
They say meditation is the first step to hypnotisation. You could hypnotise yourself to have moments of having empty thoughts. Altho do be quite careful about that
Has meditation worked on you?
i need to win an argument i know lets just tell my opponent to kys
you cant have a society tolerant of all speech because that means you are tolerant to intolerant views
the paradox of tolerance
and on the surface level its "oh no shutting down their speech is bad you have to let them have their opinion all voices are heard" but the nazis had no respect for this and only used it to push forward their exclusionary ideology
demanding that the nazis have their say at the table
a good part of how facism spread in Weimar germany was using the republics idea of giving free speech to everyone to their own advantage

Communism is that funny thing which America replaces with fascism for financial profit
<:sadcowboy:510303995215085569> sorry you had to deal with that
Therapy might be better for that
Like with trauma?
1 am and havent done my hormones is bad word Emily time lmao
Truthful perhaps
Its about letting your brain enter an almost extremely disassociate state which makes you more... i guess the word is open?
Its like a level above that
If you have ever tried meditation
Like go shoot up some place for example
You can’t really force someone to do something they dont want to do
But hypnosis is not like anime and shit
Just cause of how my mind works
Learned enough to realise it might be really unsafe for me to try
Just an interest
Nonk
I can do the best to what i know
Was someone born of pure ignorance and lived an ignorant life someone who was alive
Something that came up a lot during my first year of my course was what did it really mean to be a human
<:trans_hug:513029326002847745>
I hope it works out for ya too
And studying plurality is a lil juicy
Its why i got into politics
Ive always had that feeling that I should do *something* to at least make the world a little better
Heck maybe ill do a philosophy paper on it <:smug:462285929768550400>
Meiyi ill happily volunteer
Or is there another reason
But then is the reason we split was because that task was so overbearing that it caused a split
I imagine if we were single I as a single individual would have to carry that
Cause for me I have someone who carries my emotional baggage
Like is the involvement of a second being in your mind substitution for what your mental capacity could handle?
But the question is if you were single minded would that even be something that you could do anyway
Sorry im a philosophy dork
Utilitarian?
And it made me kinda think more about well what tf even is an individual
Because I think its why when i dabbled in hypnosis myself it wasn’t as effective
But it was interesting to hear that
And it requires quite a bit of deprogramming to solve really
And other toxic stuff
As in files which would try to develop an alter which is stationary and doesn’t do anything
But the way i heard was a super toxic negative way
That it can sort of lead to alters being made
That in the hypnosis community
I know
What is this bingo
And because im a fucking dorky ass philosophy nerd
And what I thought where my mental moods was entirely different people with different enjoyments
Turns out thats Hailey
My fiancee is plural and i noticed myself that at moments i acted very... childlike and innocent
A few months ago
Thanks dad ❤️
We just dont change our name because we have absolutely no idea whomst we are at any time
Cy you know that we are plural too right?
<:trans_hug:513029326002847745>
No offence to you kerrik but you sound like a very well meaning boomer learning about these new fangled things and being cool with it <3
Trauma based systems letsago <a:AiRave:519386849823948803>
Same
Was lucky I figured out i was trans
My brain isn’t exactly the most stable of places
Yup
<:HibikiDab:688190074395164696>
At this point i think im just a median system
Feel like its less identity and more is
https://morethanone.info/
*i am a fucking lightweight*
Granted i did have a little too many edibles
So we could kinda mingle
Cause it kinda tore apart the barrier for us
Weed helped a lot
Oh right
Fuck i was literally bout to say something but forgot it
Like listening to bikki songs
And its usually symphogear related
I get bouts of just pure genki
Yes
And/or is actually just Hibiki
60% sure we have a girl who wants to be a symphogear user
Just what we believe their passions to be
I dont have names or really much of anything
For you that would have been the writing girl
Oh sorry im mixing people up
Anyone?
Sooo
I was severely depressed
Good question lmao
The rest not that big of weebs?
The human psyche and the brain matter dictating it is depressingly malleable
It can always be a depressing case of a plural system where one passes away <:sadcowboy:510303995215085569>
Ive heard it to happen
I did get that impression from voy
Ok sorry
Romantically
As in
Two in one bayonet. Does that mean voy and you are together?
I do have a question if thats ok ten
I had a bit of a crisis on who the consciousness part was... that took a long time to deal with
Meiyi I might’ve asked your system before but i feel like i probably should ask again. Do yall know of any ways that we can like better develop communication?
Ooh thats neat
Oof i get how that feels meiyi <a:Hug:530477382142787594>
I was diagnosed as high functioning but now its whatever the fuck cause my brain cant function wooooo

Welcome
Autism gang <a:AiRave:519386849823948803>
Good thing i need that anyway
Gay rights even
Heck
Lots o people are against trans rights
I feel like ive only said it here today
But yeah Meiyi did i ever tell you abott the weed before?
I feel like i might’ve switched a lot in this convo....
Its like a video game and everyones got their dirty fucking hands on the controller
We are just all blurred
Most of the time Cy
Well
Ah ok
Is aria here? Hard to see blocked messages for me
Oh sub i dont get too many chances to ask people this but whats your feelings on stuff like synthetic meat
Sorry you have to deal with that asshat sub
Its not sensitible but *egg him*
To put it super simply
I guess
Brain palaces sorta
Just remember they dont deserve ur time sub
Dam
Its just a comfort thing. A very loud comfort thing that shoots guns
The favourite item of any small child
The snom
Ah yes
<:trans_hug:513029326002847745>
Looking forward to the 4 years of neoliberalism
Or rather joe bidens VP
And the only salvation to the fascism america has today is *joe biden*
As america is suffering its consequences of oppression
Now the president is using nazi dog whistles which are almost fog horn in nathre
You know i remember an ancient time where joe biden was basically non existent for a few weeks
Its called mask off rady
https://mobile.twitter.com/IGD_News/status/1273445459374170112
~~ovo is also how chickens go owo~~
Well rad where do you get that cow muscle
Part of that is because of Hinduism in India if my school taught me anything
I remember reading your mcdonalds has much more vegetarian options
India is quite a vegetarian place no?
I mean for me at least
Its just pricey
Theres vegan and vegetarian burgers already
Rady you can do that anyway
And im hoping its the way forward
Ive seen a lot of plant meat and stuff around here
Sorry, I didn’t mean to start anything
Well she made one of our system members like quite dangerously furious so its for safety if anything
And when brexit hits it will all come down
And the covid death rate is skyrocketing as the nhs is struggling
And tensions between the classes is extreme
Boris is barely our PM
I do feel like a collapse is due for the UK
War on drugs do be like that tho
Please dont shoot my dingy kerrik
<:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
Id love to go to kerrik land as well
New Zealand is pretty good
As if they aren’t already
Im excited for the poor to be murdered on masse
But it should be done at the end of this year
Brexit will never be done lmao
But the problem i have is im a brown trans girl and scotland has some racism problems if my scot friend is to believe
I need to do that before brexit lmao
Scotland isnt a bad call
Rady you of all pe know thats a bad idea
Cuba is lovely i hear. Would totally love to go one day
Yes
<:sadcowboy:510303995215085569>
I mean canada looks nice cause its got good pr. you dont wana hear what shit theyve done to their indigenous
Or the civil war when trump refused to bow peacefully
Children is a good buzz word for conservatives
Protect the children by funding the police <a:mmGold:393926007649861632>
Not kids
Its about control
God remember the Panama Papers?
Which would have totally stopped me from browing nhentai <:mmLol:361540629563703296>
She wanted to enact porn licenses
Theresa “snoopers charter” May
Fucking *may*
I barely managed to get used to May
Ive rebound
God you know how cursed saying prime minister boris Johnson is?
Beyond that, the tories themselves aren united
There must be a reason he cant be sacked. Maybe im stretching but i just dont feel certain
I mean despite his little tremendous cockup Cummings is still around no?
McCarthyism was a shit <:sadcowboy:510303995215085569>
He has disturbingly little sway
Despite having a majority
Nevis you are making the assumption its boris who has the keys
And corbyn was the victim of political assassinations from the media and his own party
I dont think we can survive more years of neoliberalism under Starmer
Reminder thats just reported cases
I mean lockdown is already being eased up in states
Im saying when it hits not now lmao
The second corona wave will be blamed on protesters
Mark my words
Be a minority in America
Heavy black incarceration go brr
War on drugs go brrr
Except in the case of imprisonment
The voices of the naive shouting all lives matter get cut down with gunfire and they look around and see that they chant with the monsters of society
Harder to pretend its not an issue
It was hard enough already as was but its getting even harder to maintain what i would describe as a liberal stance on the issue that America never really gave up on slavery and nobody has really done anything about it
Theres a spark in the forest and the response was napalming it to stop the spread
The US is just 50 countries pretending to be 1 after all
But its connected because we see in the US on a local level that change could haplen
Well the discussion was about riots and stuff no?
And its biting them in the ass
They’ve brought way too much into their own propoganda about themselves
And we are seeing that hit them because they are losing morale
I think what we have seen in the us is that the police are very good at digging their own graves
<:mmLol:361540629563703296>
Dont worry im sure joe biden will do something about that
Wait till climate change walks through the door
We already got heavy nazi dogwhistles from the current government
Wouldn’t count it out
2020 is a very interesting year
Especially since its hard to keep track of the deaths for the poor
Actual case numbers will be quite higher
Not all system members can be friendly
I mean if it was a communist rebellion it would be more equaler share time of fronting time no?
If you want to believe the human has a soul, you can say that the soul of a plural system is either fragmented or holds multiple souls. The original is complicated as something that inform can be lost due to severe traumatic events. In my case, it certainly feels like a case where as far as we can remember we can age ourselves but as a whole who knows who was first due to crippling memory problems which a fuckton of pluralism faces
This is my area of expertise <:MariaWave:497982081909915658>
Brits at the time felt like they were better at treating black people in the uk compared to the yanks but it was an attitude of “treating your tools with respect” <:disgust:606954297665650688>
Its been around since world war 2
<:BlobTransHeart:550787093736194068>
Systems in a nutshell
Yall are vcing?
Theres some which heavily exploit trauma as a means to harm the body
I mean a cloned Emily would be trans. Or come out a cis girl?
If we cloned a plural person, would they develop the system if exposed to a different environment
Heres an interesting question haru
Would it be murder if they never developed(?)
Would a plural system like mine and harus still develop with a different environment
I think whoever asked that question was saying something like
That means i just think about the science not know the science <:mmLol:361540629563703296>
Im a philosopher
Look im no scientist rady
It depends on the biological process
Im not sure what you are asking
I mean im open online? Less so irl
But thats just more the method if anything
The only question would be if the cloning process itself create a cis female body
Same with sexuality
Transness isn’t something you develop
I would
How do you live when every day is a dice roll on if you want to do nothing but eternally scream into the void
How do you flee home when you have no proper education and no job due to your cptsd
Who can’t even heal because any progress they make is shut down and reversed by their circumstances
How do you help someone when they live deep in the heart of their suffering and may never get the chance to escape for years
I understand *that*
The feeling where all of her hope has been snuffed out and she lives only because of us
I understand her hopelessness that she feels
The scariest feeling of understanding exactly what your fiancee is feeling because you feel the same way.
Oof
Even if it doesn’t seem like much
But remember that you are helping
I know what you mean
You are
Yeah
Sometimes the best thing you can do if you are able to do so is just listen
The dark days are the most bleak
I feel ya sub
Far left ideology and infighting name a more iconic duo
I mean far left wing ideology during that time period was more a case of did ya like stalin or did you like the abolishing of the state
~~the og tankie gang~~
There was that failed communist uprising which was stamped out with help of a far right wing group I remember
There was a lot of communists in Germany at that time. Some of them ended up on the wrong end of a knife or gun tho
Nothing like reading something marked ass a triggered and being surprised when you get triggered
My stupid ass should really start taking trigger warnings more seriously
My nan thinks all black people are both Jamaican and horrible, Depression is just a fabrication and well gay and trans people...
Trust me <:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
I get ya
Is ok
Sorry I didn’t mean to aim that at you sub
I know a lot of those parents are very much like “well we just don’t understand” and use that as their justification to never change
Not understanding isnt an excuse
Is absuse
I mean denying your own childs mental health issue
Asian parents being abusive is a meme with depressing truth to it sometimes
Are you able to provide them with temporary sanctuary?
kinda undermined with the fact that people could opt out
UK sex ed was very hit and miss for me
xd
entitlement to sex isnt good
how consent became a problem? id say toxic masculinity is a good starting point
what media a child consumes can affect it
societal influence of masculinity and femininity can be toxic sometimes
i think thats why its good to hammer home consent
society is kinda weird
cant save when ur hand to mouth
im gonna be fucked the moment cash stops coming in
we have swathes of people swarming beaches
unemployment is gonna rise
at at time like this
mums being made redundant
depressingly statistically im gonna get hit mega hard by this
trump has essentially undid any form of progress made in the middle east
i mean hell
Iran do be looking juicy tho
for starmer to spend his term to do his shit of making passive movements towards progress
i just dont see where we have the time
well
the only difference is that the people are sick of that shit
we are just gonna get a repeat of what happened last time. just replace the word Blair with Starmer
i saw a study that said 90% of the uk public doesnt want chlorinated chicken entering their market from the US. and yet we have voters who blindly voted for our food standards to be ripped apart by the current government who despite having a large majority seems absurdly shakey
in the UK it seems as if we are fated to head the way of America. one of the last remaining prominent left wing politicians in the shadow cabinet, RLB, was sacked due to "anti-semetism"

What RLB did was tweet in support of an article which had a sentence talking about Israel's involvement in training police in America the techniques which were the ones used to kill George Floyd. This on top of a leaked Labour report which documented the extreme level of infighting with the centre/centre-right wing of Labour undermining Corbyn by any means necessary and revealing that the Anti-Semitism scandal which plagued Corbyn being quite thoroughly undermined by the revelation that more than half of anti-Semitism complaints had come from a single person leads me to think that UK politics is somewhat doomed.
Im thinking this fashy quiz is bad actually
Cough cough bengal famine
Some of the questions are “do you want this very reasonable thing or **the worst thing ever cause thats what leftists want**
<:MikuDelete:661660028410920990>

What if this led to JK Rowling being suspended too haha just kidding...
Unless <:ovo:718759351686529044>
Hes made it his crusade to post almost 24/7 about how trans people are bad
Severe transphobe in the UK. Tried to get funding removed for a trans charity that supports kids. Also quite a bigot in the department for really the entire LGBTQ+ community
<:pogfish:685972553499803664>
Mega “TERF” in the UK
I need to share this wonderful news
Source?
Rest in piss
Pogchamp
Problem is the donalds been quite literally dead for months. They’ve all migrated. There was a time and place to ban it and it was at the peak of their vile toxicity
Even CTH users
But nobody’s really losing tears about it from what ive seen
CTH got itself quarantined by having most of their posts about killing slave owners. It was inevitable it got banned considering its a very good “hey we also removed some left wing subs for being bad see we are fair”
And then use that to... say what they want
A heavy amount of UK terfs argue that “we cant say what we want because the trans community make this a violent debate”
I mean both sides of the trans debate are violent is the form of enlightened centrism which is dominant in the UK because it gives justification for not speaking to trans voices about community issues
<a:mmGold:393926007649861632>

/r/Jailbait was one of the most popular subreddits and was only removed due to severe media attention
If there’s anything thats short and can tell you what the problems of reddit are
Which are mods which are in control of a tremendously large amount of subreddits and use that power to basically be not fun people
One major problem reddit has is power moderators
Consume product turned into heavy bigoted dog whistling
It became depressing unironic once the nazis rolled in
Gamers rise up
Its just that they banned a ghost town and a meme thorn in Spez’s side
> So basically reddit banned both a meaningless left-wing and meaningless right-wing sub? Go figure.
Tbf to reddit its actually done a lot to banning a fuckton of right winger subs
The subreddit and the podcast aren’t closely associated
Amongst other things
But the subreddit was a left wing meme subreddit
Its a podcast
barring that, i would probably say second place sweden or finland
new zealand sounds like the better place in terms of language barrier and being a trans person
new zealand
But we’ve always been in survival mode; theres no luxury for things like long term memories there
The past will mean something when im stable enough to make something out of it
Its what happens when a human spend all 19 of its years in an environment where they don’t feel comfortable or safe
The past is whatever my traumatised little brain managed to retain like a scavenger keeping scraps. A good chunk of time its a tormented because the brain likes to highlight its own failures. I know a lot of people have a lot more clearer memories of their past but its hard to convey just how much of mine is just a vapid blur.
Ive been lowkey keeping up on everything about what’s happening in smash and the one takeaway I got was that this was inevitable
> and I hope to god that none of you are currently in such a situation
haha who would ever be in that
Communities are sick and tired of it and are speaking up. Pro Wrestling, smash and probably more i dont know off the top of my head
Im noticing a trend
She had extreme asthma and went out to expose herself?
> In the sense that, it was carefully applied to make sure it disadvantages marginalised populations most
Only time NRA was pro gun control was when the black panthers were walkinf the streets armed
What you are saying is true but is ignoring the whole culture we have at large. Its hard to even speak up and believe the horrible shit that’s happened to you let alone prove stuff. Not to mention people are actually listening right now. Legal action in the past wouldn’t have helped because it wouldn’t have gone anywhere as depressing as that sounds. Now is a more than perfect time to do so because victims are actually feeling like for once they can speak up against their abusers
I don’t think the problem was legal action and more the smash community had a fuckton of disgusting people with a lot of power
This all is just bans as well right? Has any legal action been taken?
<@203444794737950720> help whats happening and yall ok?
One of my favourite jokes is “all these refugees coming in here, taking our polish immigrants jobs!”

Rady is Polish
Well someone did. Covid did
Our PM was quoted for blaming care home workers are at fault for the corona spreading in care homes
Uk and usa being scumbag countries name a more iconic duo
Lovely
Could covid mutate in a hotspot country like the usa?
no motivation to even do stuff
i understand it
a fuckton

no i get that
Rady you should move to the us at this point

whats it saying

Fun fact
For the fellow UK peeps out there exhausted by everything happening in the world
> So you’re in kind of a flux of system members kind of phasing in and out?
Very good way of phrasing it
Im just scared of who will be remaining afterwards
I know we will probably get through this
In the span of a month or two, the progress we’ve made on the mountain of recovery we have been climbing has been almost entirely reset by being violently shoved off it
And the mental suffering each of us are enduring isn’t something we can all cope with evenly
And not knowing who’s still there
But its scary snapping out of an extremely long disassociate episode
I know
Its like if elfnein was burning carol to keep going
You don’t mean mallice
Its ok we are understanding
We will burn ourselves out of our entire mental supply just to push forward
We’ve engraved a super egalitarian nature within ourselves unintentionally
Fade away being my kind way of phrasing it
Which means people fade away
Yeah
So we spent a lot of time heavily disassociated and burning lots of mental fortitude just to maintain ourselves
It’s because we aren’t in a safe position most of the time. We’re at our home which is a tremendous source of trauma for all of us
No name, they arent verbal but they are NB and also ace
We’ve recently identified one more
Theres a girl in our system called Hailey. Shes very easily identifiable because she speaks differently and is quite childish in nature
Like i guess just identifying ourselves
Some of us are... fading
But i know one thing that’s really hampering us super hard
And i dunno if we’ve reached anywhere
So ive been trying to think about my own plurality for quite a while now
In our moments where we have whatever semblance of a grip in reality
We’ve barely noticed before
Why would we
But id be lying
Id like to have faith
Its a muted response
None of us can really ever fully comprehend all the horrible shit going on rn and in the past
||she described an indescribable amount of suffering and internal death||
I think the reason I aint heard is related to what i last remember her saying
I timed that quite wrong eh?
I haven’t heard from a while from the gal who’s probably holding a big much of the trauma we have
TIL
I thought it was someone who was deliberately harmful to other system members
Labels are just convenient ways to explain things in my experience
I am a budding depressed philosopher. Yes thats the exact title ima take dont @ me
Hell some countries still regard transness as mental illnesses
Prosecutors?
We’d jump infront of trolleys to save the rest of our asses
This kinda young fantasy was how we engraved in ourselves hyper egalitarianism
And i speak weird and cryptic so no shit
Better to escape in our imagination than deal with the harsh reality
Yeah
‘Twas plurality
To put a very long and embarrassing story short
To assist them
Would become a module inside a powerful entities head
It was my escape fantasy once i passed away
Why I think that is because i “came up” with the idea many years ago as a small kid
Ive probably been plural for a very long portion of my life
Easy to pick that skill up when weakness is punished
If theres one thing we all can do, is act well
Im 90% autopilot and 10% sorting out the shit that we’ve made
Just that I don’t have enough time for anything useful
Not to say i use that time wisely
It just really happens
Don’t ever have the time for taking out
But it’s only really in hindsight we can even identify it
Thats why bardy girl and lesbian biker cool girls are terms we use :p
Ironically i keep forgetting it
Ive been recommended actually many times to keep daily notes during the day
We’re a mushy incoherent blob
We cant tell
One of us is a badass lesbian girl but is she also the girl who super loves music
Its a double oof because its super hard to keep track of everyone. We just have loose threads of identity points
Its depressing as fuck to live in a state of intense repression and disassociation
We’ve been strong enough to even reach this point. Im scared to ever remember what we’ve lost as a whole to stand now
Thank you
Altho its actually a bit worse cause we all have to act as one
They are stuck forever suffering
What happens to the human psyche when it has to overcome the disturbing revelation that even death wouldn’t be an escape from their perpetual torment
I wish i could let go
Im sick of spending so much time in a state where im barely hanging om
We’re spiralling and feel isolated. *yay*
Gosh we aren’t gonna be doing well tonight huh
It’s horrifying to think about
Or when we are safe with our wife
Which is to say rarely
Is it about censorship?

Its hard to play catch up from dead days <:sadcowboy:510303995215085569>
Survive tho is very debatable
I certainly live
“Just don’t think about it”
Nah clearly what the solution is to get over it and work harder that will solve depression <:MillaarcDone:689395768980668416>

the nazis didnt advertise themselves as national socialists because they believed in socialism or anything. it was cause it gets them seats and powers xd
left wing policies are very popular so dont be surprised when right wingers adopt that rhetoric to get elected
But theres a lot of ways one can react and behave when stumbling into something
Maybe im bias in my experiences but love is more a think you stumble into
currently i wouldnt suggest trying to meet people physically
i mean
But you are 23 no?
Rady this may sound rude
Plus trauma
I mean my situation is im horribly depressed and my wife is just too far away sometimes
Cough cough covid
If you feel like you cant pursue something romantic at the moment, you need to accept that to some degree until it changes. Whether it be your change when you are ready or when circumstances change
One thing as well is ya gotta to some degree accept when things dont happen whether it be your inability to act or circumstances
Social anxiety is a bitch sometimes
Relationships don’t fall on peoples laps and stay that way. You don’t become friends with people here without speaking to them
But again there is an element of actually doing something.
Maybe im naive but I don’t think going out of your way to do something you are uncomfortable with will lead to a relationship you want to pursue. If a dealbreaker is clubbing or facebook accounts then i think the efforts are better utilised
Im gonna leave this convo. Few of our system members are pretty triggered from this
Treatment isnt the same as outright curing it. The reason why im having quite a disgusting reaction right now is because i know quite well the disturbing nature of how “curing” neurodivergency is
Phrasing
I see it equivalent to having a stop being trans cure
It would be akin to ripping apart our established personality
That would be scary as fuck
Id hope not
Brains don’t handle that
No point worrying bout the worst case scenarios
Believe in that confidence
To recruit young gamers
And stream on twitch

you cant have a second wave if the first wave never goes away
i really dont trust our current government to do both of those points well
and more specifically who against
how much will the lockdown actually be enforced
the tories right now want to desperately make sure their ass is covered when shit inevitably hits the fan again
turns out when prominent government officials treat quarantine like piss and the tories want everyone to act like theres nothing wrong the population acts in response
the british public isnt taking covid very seriously
It will be funny if he tries anything. And maybe depressing if we see what impact it may have globally
Back to business as normal
Nobody currently wants trump. Biden is far enough to the right that republicans are finding him more palatable than outright fashies
The UK is doing a UK thinf
With US betrayal of Kurds and essentially handing control to Turkey, Iran and Russia
The middle east situation has been quite thoroughly escalated by trump as well
Well America faces a big question
Just how serious is trumps threats to undermine democracy
America looks posed to either continue facist or go back to the system which bred  fascism within its own borders
Poland and Hungary come to mind
We are still seeing the fallout of the refugee crisis and rhe rise of fascism across the world
I don’t fully trust that
Which sucks a bit cause overall society is a lil bit stacked against that
It depends on the people i feel
What about the rest of the system if you don’t mind me asking
does your school have like a support kinda system in place?
in a derogative way?
<3
i have high functioning autism so same
thats a yikes ngl
well if any one of those three react negatively towards this kind of news
but i would at least mention to your gp what you are feeling
it can be
getting an official diagnosis can help a lot
have you looked into talking into your gp
but a lot of the time they require diagnosis letters xd
in the uk theres quite a bit of support governments and educational institutions offer which i know greatly benefit people on the spectrum
or even just people who arent teachers but do support stuff
does your year group have a support teacher individual
lemmie clarify
what about your year group?
uk schools are weird
Rady im in the same boat dont do this to me
But tbh I attributed it to polishness
I’ve seen that
Rady would you say you are someone who either writes a fuckton at once or barely writes anything over a period of time?
Obsessiveness isnt *inherently* bad
God that was 4 years ago <a:AiMegaPTSD:535178742386130945>
Cough cough pence
Theres a disturbing amount of religious nutters in trumps ear that seem to have a creepy christian belief concerning Israels importance in the apocalypse
Its a trump move
These past 4 years have been so long I forgot that trump actually moved the embassy in the region

Maybe she doesn’t wana talk to you about whats up?
And once its ingrained you may consciously or unconsciously associate that kinda shitty language in the real world
Try explaining to someone outside of anime
Oh and the occasional mods gay because who doesn’t love a bit of casual homophobia to prove your point that your favourite slur isn’t actually bad
I did spend a few days watching the fire that has become of animemes but theres only so much you can watch of 15k+ upvoted posts saying “we should ban x word its offensive to y” over and over again
But they’ve said their strategy has been to let the fire burn itself out
The only criticism i have with the sub mod team is that they really need to hammer it down
Like holy fuck the transphobes came out of the woodworks to spin any justification to keep saying it
Gone too far
People whining about how they cant use their emotional support slur anymore
Apparently tens of thousands of people can read how it’s deeply offensive and still get mad anyway
At least you have learned
Its disgusting and unhealthy behaviour that needs to be stamped out
And look at the result. Ive seen people on that sub make comparisons to 1984, countless petitions to ban a word because it will offend x, as well as a lot of calling the mods gay
The mods at the sub must have been told lots of times that their rule 5 of “no transphobia and homophobia ” was just silly when they allowed such language to fester
Its a transphobic slur with deep homophobia ridden into it
Its always been a concern
Its their emotional support slur they cant imagine parting with it
I have something related to that
My faith in the animemes community was limited. I think at this point the people left aren’t there out of ignorance but malice now
Fun times
I remember when people tried to spin Lily from ZLS as not trans
I mean a significant portion of the server if not the entirety is flooded with “waaaa mods banned the word”
Because it implies dception
Yes but significantly more malicious meaning and intent to it
I mean a word that requires you to think being gay is bad is going to be fuckin horrible. Thats just the stepping stone tho of the term
I mean transphobia is pretty nsfw if you think about it in a way
I mean from what ive seen the trans mod who frontlined the changes has resigned
How so
I mean its very easy to convert someone who really hates not being able to say their transphobic slur into a full on transphobe
A lot of far right peeps as well as transphobes are capitalising on this ban panic and using it to spread their crappy thoughts. That’s something ive seen a bit of in that sub
Ok....?
Manbearpig
Well yeah but it doesn’t help heavily glorifying it
So libertarians

Online radicalisation is real and can be effective
im excited for the law and order vice president during this very well timed era of the usa
oof
I saw something about the government stepping down
Romani is the more less slur term used in the uk
The context of which it was used was a much more broad sense to describe what is just essentially something middle eastern. As if it was the correct term for that entire culture of clothing which is very wrong
It doesn’t matter that in a specific rare scenario you actually encounter the right culture its the right word
Because i dunno what sources your reading but i can speak as someone who lives here and has even had the chance to meet the traveller community it is absolutely a slur
I must ask if you are uk or not
When we have systems that have been birthed from psychologically preying on those with gambling issues or literal children the gaming industry is quite fucked
I dont feel we should be living in a world where we would require “good” gambling mechanics which teenagers and people looking to escape the world need to interact with
I think he’s alive?
And she also kinda fucked with his chances of recovery
Apparently he went on a mega only beef diet or something cause of her
Shes more... not good
Iirc he was comatose due to his daughter
Im super not looking forward to **more austerity**
I feel like commonwealth politics is pretty fucky
Had a socialist leaning friend who fell pretty hard for Starmer. So far they have been quite heavily regretting that decision
~~whats the difference~~
Like he isn’t purging anything left of Blair out of the party
<a:mmGold:393926007649861632>
Im sure Starmer will do something to help

The cishet are at it again
And he’s mainly doing it cause of the china bad portion of his base
That’s pretty old news no?
Ive personally given up on it for the time being just cause we are so disassociated most of the time we can’t even communicate inwards
it is
||and after a while it gets into school shooter glorification fucky stuff too so overall it is just a very unfun thing to watch||
but essentially ||the MC kills herself and she essentially gets her revenge at the 13 different people that played in her choosing to die via letters||
ill tag what im about to say as its pretty shitty
suicide revenge stuff
or paradise PD
“Institutional racism and sexism against men and white people” excuse me what?
Reading a bit up about it it seemed more like the controversy was about the potential number of civilians who were either forced or part of refugees in the convoy
yes but the rules were quite more set in stone afterwards
the geneva convention was something created after world war 2 no?
... is retreating soldiers valid people to even attack?
iirc the map in the campaign was sniping in a mainly abandoned city hill vantage point then escaping a gas attack
even if you learn that it was actually americans you might imagine it as less bad than it was due to its depiction in the game
i mean you could argue its a two layer badness
especially given the demographic of capital g Gamers
i find it super hard to even believe that this person wasnt accidentally chosen too
and i have to imagine either there is a tremendous amount of ignorance within the people making the decisions right now or there is actual thought put into revisionism and glorification of some very horrible people
i would not at all be surprised for the highway of death thing that they were told to do this by american military "experts" in order to portray themselves as more of saints
there is already a lot of right wingers cheering about this because its essentially giving clout to a bunch of people ready to be sucked into disgusting ideology
without real context as to his absolutely disgusting views
it makes people curious as to who he is
this is the same company which revised history to say the highway of death was caused by russians
https://twitter.com/elhammar/status/1296797004945862662?s=20
To say anything but that is deeply disingenuous of what it is right now
I just want to say for the record that Cultural Marxism is a nazi conspiracy theory which began with blaming jews for the erosion of western society, evolving into the next scare mongering of womens rights, minority rights, ect ect
I agree. Which is why when we say you are sprouting alt right ideas it has power and truth to it
I mean i can say im a leftist all i want but ngl unironically saying alt right talking points severely puts that in the doubt....
&nd tamao is danish. And why alt right buzzword dog whistles are bad should be a bit obvious
Ah right that does happen
When did this topic shift all of a sudden
Hold on a second. What was exactly so wrong with Believe Women is what i want to know
Thats one way to put it
I mean when did we have to start saying our words so the nice old white people dont misunderstand us
The people jumping at this misunderstanding already dont give a shit about black lives
I mean we can have a stage if you want. Maybe you might accidentally hook someone with all those alt right talking points
And its extremely not fair for the concept of democracy itself that people deciding to vote green wasn’t good
The thing giving bush the win wasnt yhe green spoiler but the SC stopping the recount
If you really really desperately need to blame people for these business suffering short term losses, look at why the people are mad
Especially since blaming the protestors for them essentially speaking out about not wanting to be fucking murdered by a dice roll when the police are called is a very unfun thing to put it lightly
Especially when we *know* far right groups involve themselves into these protests either as counter protestors or bad actors
Especially when we *know* police plant aggregators in these things
I mean the real big thing is conflating every protestor to be responsible for everyone else’s actions as well
To... just go back to being peaceful
Who’ve been shot at and gassed by their own police force for peaceful protests
You want a group of a mish mash of all sorts of different peoplr
Did we just not *just now* talk why the protests escalated?
They have all this military gear that they have to use *somrwhere*
Maybe the problem isnt how they are protesting but actually it is the issue thats harming the community
I mean also peaceful protest was doing pretty well up until the point where police used tear gas and rubber bullets on them
What city are you in
For example americas overton window is very right wing
The political spectrum that exists in the country
fuck andy ngo IS that guy
he got thrown a milkshake on him and claimed it was filled with concrete and that he had brain damage
which he then used to spread a fuckton of antifa fear mongering and general conservative misinformation
> Oh, both people who died were confirmed pedophiles.
and also you really went there huh
isnt andy ngo the guy who is quite well known for falsely known for lying about this shit
it was that white terrorist bloke iirc
would you perhaps like to source that?
We aint even that close all things considered
Shit has to get *bad* for that to happen
I mean worrying about the US falling is the same kinda fear people had about soviet nuke strikes tbh
Cause the way i see it is a case of politics for the establishment being shifted quite a bit to the right with centre/centre right politics taking centre stage
But i put more odds on biden winning on the pure principle that at the end of the day i see moderates who ran away from clinton flocking back
I say possibly because I genuinely have little faith in starmer winning
What do yall think about the future with President Biden and possibly also PM Starmer and how that will impact global politics
So the lib dems got it
Is the liberals in AU like the lib dems?
Oof
You could argue that the reason that’s happening is because the stress of entering the workplace causes people’s engagement in politics to drop heavily
Older than like 20 ish
I think theres a layer of i guess people like 5 ish years older who got radicalised by the right wing
Its ironic where the countries bomb the fuck out of syria and other areas in the region and then go “no we cant handle the *consequence* of that”
I feel like that and the refugee crisis led to a more surge in right wing politics in th EU
God the EU referendum was a pretty big fuck huh
In my town at least it was predominantly PoC wearing masks and big crowds of unmasked white people
I was walking in my town. Didnt meet a single white person who wore a mask or social distanced
communism and capitalism is just economics
politically im probably just at the level of corbyn
altho this is just the colour of my heart anyway
no real changes since the last time i did this
so you would be much more for reforming than abolish
i mean im all down for abolishing women and men as social constructs tbh
Anarchism is a good name
The ones that were very surprised when boris got into power and all the racists “suddenly” voted blue

well leafy was still a pretty toxic channel but yes there really should have been done by youtube to handle this and the fact that they havent is appalling

My youngest brother is very likely gone if he catches this

Today she dragged me to do a big £60 shop and was quite offended when i mustered up all the courage I could that she should maybe sanitise the fuckin shit she touches
Which is a disturb amount of the population
Its exposing all of the people who would be incompetent in all the zombie fiction
I think Corona is an excellent litmus test to figure out if the people you know deserve to perish for being selfish twats

Just a bit misleading
Im confused about you saying it isnt about politics... because some youtubers made videos?
Reactionaries are a very reliable pr market
They got kneely boy for an ad and right wingers got fucking crazy. It gave them a fuckton of free publicity and attention
Honestly this reminds me of the thing that... i think it was Nike did?
And froth at the mouth at the opportunity
Or if reactionaries didnt blow up like fucking crazy
To hammer home just how uncomfortable it is
You’re gonna find scenes that will make you uncomfortable because thats the intent
I guarantee it
You arent gonna watch the film and watch a 2 hour CP
It wouldnt be shown period
If it had nudity it would not be on netflix at all
~~people have had enough of experts~~
Perhaps there is a correlation
I wonder why...
For a complex movie
Especially if its going for the “sexualisation of kids very fucking bad society wtf” message
I would imagine its very easy to take clips from the film and spin it into something else

Was that not what that conservative you posted the tweet from was *just* doing?
Has anyone here actually gone to have seen cuties?

You get the positive pr of making a vague good message gesture and the good pr from people publicly spreading your brand name for free
I remember the days when twitter was filled with right wingers burning shoes and razors
When ur a kid it can help quite a bit. I know a lot of kids who felt like they weren’t worthless after getting into Percy
And harry itself is very... blegh in comparison
Now i know that rick kinda attracted me with that idea that disabilities are powers in the right circumstances
Rick riordan was always significantly better. Never understood why people hyped up harry so much as well cause it was hard to get into
Its hard not to feel depressed when the options are masks off fascism or the very thing that brought it to relevance
For taking the position of “lets just kneecap people like we did in 97”
Id also like to give a shoutout to my homie Starmer
I feel like if anyone genuinely believes in the conservative party they are either a tremendous bigot who is beyond redemption or is depressingly naive
And fuck me is **legislating past international law** some kinda comedy bit a few years ago
I remember a quote from the writers of The Thick of It who said that they had to stop writing their show because reality kept writing it for them
I feel like in the UK we’ve reached a point where the absurd has just gone so over the top that ive just utterly lost the ability to take it all seriously
Like sure im sure Starmer would... well nobody has a clue but at least he wouldn’t actively drive the country in the ground for profit
Well that requires people to even acknowledge they are even workers in the first place
Well enough without exploitation
There are very little governments in the world I would even trust to achieve that
If the product isn’t available, a black market will rise up to sell it at more unsafer and higher prices
I know one thing that happens is that people use illegal immigration to escape their home country (for any number of reasons valid or not), do prostitution work to pay off the fees, get caught and then just sent straight back home to where there is tremendous danger waiting for them
If its illegal, its impossible to consent because the law has said you cant. Which is a bit wack
https://youtu.be/1DZfUzxZ2VU related but a kinda long video that ive been parroting points from
Its not tackling the “these workers deserve rights” its just hurting the people who use it as valid employment
Prostitution is just emblematic of a larger societal problem. Nobody really wants to tackle *why* some women feel as if they require sex work to earn money. They just think punishment is whats needed to stamp it out
I dont recall swedens method working the greatest for them, its just slightly better than what they already had
That is if you are even a prostitute and not caught under anti prostitution law
You don’t exactly have labour rights cause ur job is considered a crime
Well the thing with pimps is that when what you are doing is illegal you cant exactly call out for help for anyone
Decriminalisation of prostitution is much better anyway

~~biden also buys you more time to flee the country uwu~~
a depressing number of people will be fine with "change" which isnt change
they have to do *something* or face their political death
democrats are in a very volatile situation and if they win and do nothing they may just straight up lose the voter base forever
which is why its dependant on individuals taking a big heavy wrench to his kneecaps and making him enact change or else
if i may jump back to biden stuff. I think a lot of the push to change we are gonna see will have to be when biden is actually in office or whoever replaces him
they arent to the same level degree of caring as we are
the average voter doesnt care
which will generate political apathy
i believe every single one has broken the geneva convention if i remember correctly
all american presidents are war criminals <:YumiPoint:688429724103344164>
US politics
it was probably the most establishment candidate when the entire country had 8 years of a disappointing establishment candidate vs someone who was "gonna drain the swamp"
people were saying that in 2016, it didnt stop being true
*which btw is very powerful in the US*
i dont think anyone voting third party expects much more than local representation
thats a very big assumption on a LOT of people who are considering third party this cycle
they dont want to vote for the worse path
thats why they arent voting trump
theres a lot of people who are seeing the climate burn and the country dying and saying "no i dont think biden is going to fix anything about that in time"

and so far you havent made much of a convincing argument to anyone considering third to abandon that principle other than "you will make trump win"
thats also assuming everyone who voted green would end up voting clinton if green wasnt an option anymore as well
shaming someone to such a degree isnt an affective strategy
me who voted labour in the one green seat in the UK because the green leader rubbed me off super badly
sometimes you just have to vote on your conscience
im gonna dip but be civll and no more using shame as an argument <:MariaWave:497982081909915658>
our system elects their leader based on how many MPs they get
so they voted the softer tory instead
st albans is a fuckin right wing shithole that got sick of our worthless tory
St Albans is ran by some Lib Dem
Brighton is ran by Caroline Lucas, a Green MP

*would be a shame if someone spilled a labour report about how centre right labour members worked to actively work against labour very hard*
2019 was centrists doing what they do and siding with *boris fucking johnson* over unifying any centre left ideas with Corbyn
When you spend a debate with a morally reprehensible tory bashing on labour like it was the anti christ it leaves a mark on ya
To give you an indication
Well Lank i voted Labour in the *single* green constituency
At this point, Brexit is happening. Its just a question of how painful it is
No surprise when Boris walks in more or less uncontested with his entire ideology with a comfortable majority
I remember quite well during 2019 that everyone was at Corbyns throat for his everything
Funny thing about the lib dems is they were doing a lot of good work for the tories by spreading a lot of lies about how they were “beating labour and people needed to vote them to beat the tories” when in reality they were doing this in seats where they were quite far down the votes
Nah look i voted brexit so we could go to *the good old days* of when we were tremendous oppressors
To remind parliament of what could happen if they really wana push it
its depressing that i made a good fucking call like that
<a:mmGold:393926007649861632>
was the neighbours white?
Also the segment on cancel culture
Totally not an attempt to butcher education so people dont wise up on the fucking disgusting nature of modern day politics
This is the installation of “british values” into those terrorist kids
British values is a dog whistle
Theres also this lovely portion
https://twitter.com/Ciara87C/status/1309977019061592064?s=19
Are we leaving stuff to the invisible free hand of the market?
Like the taking the states right thing very literally and not as the dog whistle it was for anti-desegregation
Libertarians definitely give off an ancap vibe every time i have looked at thek
And by anarchist i mean anarchist not anarcho-capitalism
So like an anarchist sense?
Although it speaks more about the overton window when the most left wing viable candidate was centre left
It doesn’t help that libertarian in the american context is right wing
Would they also have the right... to not vote?
I would much rather people vote for their heart
Theres arguments to be made with people not voting for president due to ideological differences and i am not going to exactly blame them for it
By all means vote for your mind though
I thought it was generally assumed that the libertarian was what you voted if you weren’t a fan of republicans and greens if you weren’t a fan of democrats
Slight mentally damaging jabs

it sounds like you feel as if the very idea of identifying makes someone lesser than yourself tbh
the funny thing about america is that the federal level can easily be told to fuck off from the state level
The systems in place of the constitution were more or less designed to prevent a monarchy from ever taking place. sure you may get tyranny but nothing as drastic as a king

We dont have to do America bad which must equal China is good
Handing Hawaii to China sounds like the wildest tankie wet dream and will totally not lead to something crazy like a full on purging of the more ethnic cultures of it
Bruh
Its not a thing you do in a night or two
How long do you think a civil war even lasts
And you want a civil war but dont wana fight it??
Violent revolution is code black, shit hits the fan
You want a civil war
Just cause you fucking say it’s illegal doesnt mean america will fuck off from it
Youll have to fight for it
Hawaii is in America
To kill
To fight
That means to die
Dont you want a civil war?
Are you prepared for a second civil war or do you just want it
You know basic militia tactics?
You know how to operate a firearm?
Are you ready for all of that blood that will come from that
With **everything** he has done in the past 4 years
Please explain to me how hilary fucking clinton can fuck this up just as bad as donald trump did
You sound like you don’t know anything about how the democrats actually operate
So when you say they are the same
She would have done tremendously better than trump
Then by that fucking merit alone
That hilary clinton is a fashie
Do you honestly believe
No fucking shit she did
I will be honest with you on that
Then you don’t understand how the game works
Lets not parrot that kinda speak maybe
Also i swear clintons would have done it just as bad is what right wingers are saying to justify that they voted and will continue to vote a fascist
Absolute moron
Politically?
He’s confident that what hes doing is right and hes got quite a lot of advisors in his backpocket for all sorts of plays sure
Because even hillary clinton would not defund the fucking pandemic research and funding
That doesn’t mean he is also a tremendous moron too
Yes he’s corrupt as fuck
Also theres some important clarifications to make when talking about trump
Japan has far greater claim to Hawaii than China does
about american covid response
or the bit that came before that
it came up from a take of China should just take Hawaii because of how bad america has handled the pandemic
If i call them savages, that must mean i dont have to listen to them!
> They would be targeted in the event of civil war by groups that take the opportunity to carry out such persecutions
Proud boys, stand back, stand by
You sound like you demand the respect without earning it. Like how you want a civil war without participating in it like you’ll just suddenly win
Literally a brown trans anarchist in the UK who wants the queen gone but i must be secretly a monarchist
Yeah i dont kiss american boots i deep throat russian and chinese boots
Ngl tankie is kinda cringe
Cause i need to say absolutely fuck the UK. Might be fucked in terms of getting hormones cause of UK media
Can i derail the convo with something else
Proud boys, stand back stand by
i just think all that effort to shout at those people can be ivnested elsewhere
theres always going to be people who have been burned out and unenthusiastic about the system and how it works. and they arent always owed to vote blue even if it does affect them
guilt doesnt work
i just want to say there will always be people who vote with their consciousness and blaming them isnt gonna help at all
didnt harris recently say that she would be ok with all that fracking
Lets be real here biden isnt gonna lose from the kanye protest voters
Hell in anime we have justification for murder just as which we have so in real lifr such as self defence.

What justification do you have irl for CP
That’ll save em
Im depressingly expecting the kid to be doxxed by now
Which features its share of minor depicted girls being sexualised
Considering the topic is about really anime
No point saying “but this piece of different media does it”
I mean... i do? But thats not really what we are talking about as well
Sadly people will
Especially if its something controversial like sexualisation of fictional minord
Not much a problem tbh
Which was somewhat laughed at

<@!476058996315389953>  nobody is even saying that???
Like by the very nature of it affecting *you* means it has an effect to reality
There is always going to be an element of fiction bleeding into reality and it’s something you have to accept
<:Thinkki2:514552069550637066> i mean our very own suffer fics can evoke a powerful sense of emotion and harm just from killing or harming characters
its never too late
which can be explained with the hormones in a body being off balanced
but your body feels very comfortable because it doesn't match that. not in a sense of you arent ripped to shreds but theres a fundamental wrong in your body
your soul is that of a man
ya want a more masc body
you dont want that
and while thats pretty valid
you've been given a body which could be considered pretty nb
you can also think of it like this matt
with what you are describing
it really sounds like you arent having enough T in your body
like i want to state im no doc but
intersex is pretty valid matt
like how much would you kill for a heavier male puberty matt
well i would say that something like what sounds like a lack of testosterone in your body is something pretty drastic
human bodies are fuckin stupid
yeah
that was really it
and they found out their chromosones were XY or something
like i remember a story of a cis girl who lived their live very fem
sometimes birth be wacky
like to its fundamental level and how it does shit
its more to do with your body
and its as common as red hair as well
intersex is like a pretty biological portion of it iirc
body dysphoria is dysphoria matt
i mean
if he gets a deal his base which he has built to be uninformed fashies would drop him hard
hes still a fucking cuntish moron
even if he does capitulate
covid sweeping through tories who cheerfully and happily voted for their leader to abandon them in the cold
famine as the people starve with abundances unreachable to the lowest rungs of society
would we not have every horseman visitng our country?
if the troubles reignite
and the fact that they are very likely to just walk away thinking that they did good for their country
the ungodly amount of suffering which is marked firmly in the bloody hands of the conservative party
could not come close to how much contempt i have for him
any insult i could dare come up for boris
honestly
~~boris~~
where the UK goes through some apocalyptic shit due to some timeline changes
im lowkey reminded of a dr who episode called Turn Left
gosh
but
ill probably repress all of this soon
haha
i hope i dont die
as our country crumples under all of the cracks its made itself
at least we made a few indivudals more disgustingly wealthier
we have a few months before we basically ignite all of that in napalm
ontop of a public health crisis which has basically hamemered hard on the working class due to the piss shit management of it all
our hospitals are overworked and paid little
our welfare system is now marking people quite literally for dead
the tory government for the past 10 years under the name of neo liberalism has been siphoning away our ability to take care of those who need it
well i mean in the sense that i cant escape really
im just gonna have to survive and hope shit works out
my passports expired and i dont have the cash to really replace it
like biden is a turd but hes something
because theres a bit of hope in there
i feel oddly envious of america when i look at it sometimes
because internally they thing trumps fucked
and theres been reports from number 10 that they are just abandoning that on mass and trying to kiss up to biden
a lot of boris's trade strategy was "well trump will totally trade with us! ~~we love chlorinated chicken~~"
i dont find much if any political hope within the uk
boris's strategy seems to be lets just ignore the EU and hoping that they will just sit down and shut up when they ignore it all
we've been at this standstill for months at this point
but like
its been pushed back another month
Today the brexit negotiation deadline was supposed to be reach (dejavu?)
its just the beginning to restoring what was lost
voting biden is not where politics ends
biden is not at all immune to criticism or anything just because he is running against a fascist. if you cant hold his ass accountable for his fuckups then you are reopening the door for all those nasty plagues that came in 4 years ago to come back stronger than ever
look at the cunts up top
dont kick down
because they wanted to run THE establishment candidate against DONALD TRUMP
and again if you dont like that tough shit. sorry to say but you arent achieving anything by guilting them. they arent going to suddenly change sides.

again. its not their fault they arent motivated to abandon their policies to vote for a scumbag. its on biden for those lost votes and its on biden and the democratic establishment if they lose what could have very easily been the most winnable election possible
its shitty when you are asking people, especially marginalised people who know very well whats going on to abandon their principles on politics to vote for someone who is highly likely to do nothing. maybe their lives will get significantly worse under trump but the principles and politics someone holds is very much still valid. if we are to say that they are not then we have very much strayed away from pretending to be a democracy
dont trust that you will foster the same conditions that will potentially generate a worser trump
especially when those very people
by saying "im not like the fashie on the other side"
you cant run a political campaign to motivate people to vote for you
biden has that cross to bear to attract people
its not because people didnt vote for him
if biden loses
like you arent going to do anything but get self satisfaction (?) by using blame tactics on someone whos motivated enough to vote green in this election or 2020
i feel like its disingenuous to blame nader for the failing gore has of not capturing votes from that certain demographic. also blaming someone for voting green is a big oof imo
have you mentioend these kinda thoughts to the doctors and people taking care of ya?
Because its like driving a car off a fucking mountain into a spiky ravine
What it originally was is “cliff edge brexit”
I hate they the narrative has shifted the name of no deal to what it is now
https://news.sky.com/story/brexit-michel-barnier-told-to-stay-home-after-boris-johnson-says-eu-abandoned-free-trade-deal-12105527 can i get some bass boosted screaming for boris telling everyone to get ready for no deal
Just feels like at the moment if i want something i need to be worse before i can get better
I may have to go private with getting therapy help myself
Haha this country is fun
https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/oct/18/police-999-callouts-to-people-suffering-mental-health-crises-soars
im not saying what your feeling isnt right or isnt valid. im saying that you need to be able to process them without being harmful
or they will harm yourself and other people
you cant let these feelings foster inside you without processing them properly
we are all but humans
i would for sure recommend talking to the doctors and people treating you about this
which gets fuckin weirder when we are switchy or blurrt
when it comes to other people most of us can do stuff but wouldnt be comfortable with ourselfs
the self
but that horny stuff means like
however theres one of us who handles all of the horny stuff
or dont really care that much
a good chunk of us are ace
in my system
and being horny a lot is from what i remember very typical from this male body i was given before i started cyberhacking it with estrogen
well sexuality is a fuck. i stopped trying to label it when i started thinking that part of me was NB
I cant tell if you are bitterly sarcastic or genuine but in both cases <:BlobNBheart:702533957291474964>
How bout the EU? Or is that too late
i can speak english dont worry im a professional
i find it very very ironic that they can be short hand be called the piss party
dam being worse than the us libertarians <:oof:625762392525111296>
or is that some other party
pis is the fashies right?
Because if it was about the economy you can just do the American approach
Or saving the economy
Stopping the pandemic killing people
Ask yourself what is your priority in your heart
Especially landlords
People are heartless enough to do so
Literally being kicked out of your home because your work kicked you out cause of covid can help either spread a deadly virus or just kill someone from bad times
Well cut down on why people actually need to move is a good first step in dealing with a pandemic
What im getting from this convo is that for some reason its really hard to stop your citizens dying and protect the invisible free hand of the market place from smashing up businesses and peoples livelyhoods
But yeah tax increase on the working class and middle class seems kinda oof
That would require enforcing laws on the wealthy
Tax fraud on the poor is a dog whistle i swear
Tax fraud on the wealthy mind you
Just as effective
Is just crack down on that tax fraud
Funny enough one thing you can do
Eu country: hey can we take out some debt to stop a pandemic ruining our businesses
EU: haha that’s really funny
~~bigger taxes on the rich~~
Ideally any businesses affected would be protected as they got destroyed by a pandemic

Funny how they get utterly fucked under the systems they are in
Health or coin
One is just less dead
There’s always going to be an economic loss whether it be from people dying or lockdown restrictions
Boost *the economy*
Everyone eat in on restaurants
Reopen early says the uk
To protect the economy
Cause they didn’t want to break away from their economic system
A middle ground would require compromises on the capitalist system lots of countries operate
something something internet maintenence day
people revolting?
internal political crisis?
like just
how would china fall in this kind of situation
rather than a federal level
maybe ammend it so that states can decide
then you can preserve the sanctity of marriage
maybe skip some steps and break apart the rights of abortion
you have to first completely erode the rights of trans people
gay marriage is certainly hard but not impossible
you work backwards slowly
slipped his mind
mustve
he hasnt got a name ready
rushed in to lock it in place
because shes a political tool to erode away the rights of people in the country
whos not being put there because shes at all qualified for her lifetime job
a great endorsement from biden to a fucking rat going to the SC
it really is
but
you sound sarcastic
<a:mmGold:393926007649861632>
biden said this upcoming SC appointee is not a bad person
fascism
Its a brave thing to do
Fuck you even recognise your own boundaries and mental states to respectfully let people know ur feelin kinda poopy
Honestly people can go through such rough shit and end up like a super decent person and you are defo one of them
I do genuinely feel its true when i say you be like wholesome noises
But also
And yeah its good to be aware and contextualise some of the bad thoughts you have and in so proud of you
You are a super valuable friend
But you have quite literally pulled me out of some very dark spots matt
I know its hard to feel it sometimes
<@84811738653929472> just wana tell that voice sayin that you are an imposter that its a fuckin bitch ass punk and ill fight it in a mcdonalds car park
Because if you continue to support the mask off demon running the country then I have no words for you other than curse words tbh
Its the disgusting shit like this why I don’t think I can ever really... I guess be civil to anyone who says they are a tory supporter today
Infact they voted tories even fuckin harder
People don’t give a shit
The mask slipped off years ago
This isnt new shit

And i would be very surprised tbh if trump winning caused a mass scale riot in a major city
Rioting is much more than people breaking into peoples houses and looting
the problem with american gun problem is with conservative gun worship to “make a man” combined with toxic masculinity surrounding thet
Trump has a 10% chance of winning *assuming he plays by the rules*
whatever advice you want isnt gonna be easily obtainable venting in a public anime server
biden doing something about trump like arresting him
lol
isnt arizona called for?
I always thought it was middle right but geography is wack
Lots of working class voters
Theres also the rust belt somewhere in that middle
yes
to the EU
also me leaving the uk is much much harder too if i ever wana do that
legal immigration is now much much harder

Harris is a cop
you need to kill the competitors
if you want the most amount of money
but at the same time
with how things work, competition tends to generate growth and progress
Also with how capitalism works a Pizza hut (for example) could set up near a local pizza shop and just out capitalism them with monopoly stuff. Buying local supply, offering cheaper prices all sorts of shit
https://twitter.com/dozingdreamers/status/1325618436999962629
kurdish abandoned
to put it lightly
trumps foreign policies in regards to the war is probably horrible
jeez where to begin
that
bush is a scumbag but he isnt the same level we see in trump
youve fucked up
when **bush** can do better
it could have been much lower had trump acted like a leader and not a grifter
there really isnt much to say about accomplishments that compare to 200k + dead because of how badly you fucked up an international health crisis
"Proud boys, stand back and stand by"
or do you actually agree with what he is saying
has he or has he not done bad shit that justifies being "slandered" as you call it
...
its only very recently twitter has upped their game
hes been running wild on twitter for more than 4 years very much fine
censoring trump was not what lead to his popularity
do you know what the paradox of tolerance is?
typically when a new social media markets itself as pro free speech its servicing the people that managed to get banned off twitter or facebook for having abhorrent views that shouldnt be tolerated
>censored
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
well this started with them promoting everyone to join parler as it is "pro free speech"
especially since the source you listed is from a right wing news outlet and you have said that you only trust those and claim that centre or left wing outlets are spreading fake news about trump
right but you seem to be gunning far much more for "the left" of america rather than the right wing.
oh my
"Google is suppressing Breitbart results of voter fraud"
before you start making claims that the US election had enough voter fraud that it would have had a substancial impact on the election
show me actual evidence
show me it
no evidence
again
claiming fraud with no evidence
because its flimsy
legal efforts have been also shut down hard in certain areas from what i remember
theres something quite horrible about him
almost as if
any claims trump will try to make that he has won will at the moment cause one of the biggest riots in the history of the US as people are moving as fast as they can to run the fuck away from trump
we moved past that
we arent at the stage of bush vs gore
as well as missile bombing iran
and again trump pulling out of the middle east to abandon kurds to be ravaged by turkey
nowhere
is comparing the calibre of bullet that enters your skull
right but comparing bush and trump tbh
^^^
but china backing democrats is auto true huh
so russia backing trump is fake news
there we go
im sorry to say you dont know what you are talking about when you talk about the middle eastern wars
if you dont understand how bad that is
need i say more than abandoning your kurdish allies
a very fuckin bad comparison for you to make considering trump has sexual assault cases laid against him and witnesses were ignored
that is
ok
> You're deluded if you think China is your friend...
130k is a good motivator to say whatever the fuck to get more of that
Ill talk about it later :p
I saw the assault weapon ban be brought up
> come to think about it it is kind of suspicious how all the leftists i know who are against gun control fetishize guns so much
Id be against american modern gun control under biden because its measures will likely do harm to poor people instead of addressing the problem
Fuck the bbc
Repossession
I feel like trump himself isnt the scary part
its trumpism and that far right culture hes fostered in the country which will be seen if biden doesnt do his job and abandons more and more people to that side of politics
the convo isnt about a vaccine tho
About military being used for policing
Whats that famous quote
Im sure sending military police will not be abused at all by the authorities if they had the power to do so
https://twitter.com/NewDay/status/1328319845012824065

he doesnt have neolibs breathing down his fucking neck
<a:mmGold:393926007649861632>
dont worry forensic starmer has been doing just that
its quite thoroughly engrained
when we know that for his entire time as a PM the neo lib portion had been actively sabotaging corbyn and his chances of winning
also nevis its a bit.... bleh to tell *corbyn* to let things go under the water
🤞

a fuckin lad
the labour candidate for that seat too was fuckin poggers too
thats why i voted red in their safe seat :p
greens here suck ass
but yeah
she got really fuckin pissed at corbyn cause "hE sToLe oUr pLaNs!"
and caroline was like "whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa?"
the labour bloke was like "i actually talked to the people around here and landlords in the area are fucking ghouls"
she spent so much of her time ragging on labour and corbyn
and she was a bastard
because i physically attended a debate with the green leader
i voted labour in brighton and hove
like actively gunning for lib dem votes
and by siphoning i dont mean the spoiler effect
funny fact was a large part of 2019 was lib dems siphoning labour voters hard

the media worked very hard to make people scared to back corbyn up
they said they are winning in this area why would they lie
you just dont believe
that wouldnt happen at all
no
lib dem surge <a:mmGold:393926007649861632>
it would be fucking funny tho
rat cunt bastard
fuck starmer
like honestly
and wish for starmer to flop hard at the polls
i get really accelerationist/doomery
sometimes
<:wheeze:732740233363456110>
he did it with RLB
he almost did it with corbyn
and hes been purging out the lefter parts of the party
something like laser weaponry is just a drop on the ocean in that regards
the UK is already trying to ignore international law in regards to brexit

https://twitter.com/JayHulmePoet/status/1328994210599628801?s=20 i think i did this right. A decently sized twitter thread about trans life in the UK

Tw: transphobia
we had a... certain indivdual come in and try and advertise it maybe a month ago
THAT MEANS THOSE SSNS GOT LEAKED GODS
that something like parler would end up being the home of such horrible people like far right grifters looking to play on a platform that wont ban them for spreading utter conspiracies or racist ideology
im flabergasted
i dont really see them much as something to look forward to
obviously i dont have much interest in F1 driving but id apply it to any of the deepest loves of my life and i wouldnt exactly call anyone whos an expert at RPGs as a hero i would look up to
i mean aspects like good at driving and good at being rich and also giving away lots of money while still being rich
i mainly look up to my gf as shes all of my ideals for a good person :p
because often times who they are and who they really are can be quite different
i dont really do worshiping or looking up to heroes
<:sadcowboy:510303995215085569> rip the irony of it
lmao
oh i thought rags was metaphorical not literal
where rags came in
im just confused
ware they in the tweets?
rags?
the ultimate grift <a:mmGold:393926007649861632>
which makes things very ironic that the site was not secure
parler was quite obviously conservatives trying to bitch and spread their bullshit where they wont be banned
in anycase
oh til
dont think he came back for some reason
he was kicked i believe
matt please my soul
to get an idea of what they were like they called shemmy an sjw
thank you boris very cool
https://twitter.com/labourdoorstep_/status/1331935215963545600
(so america)
in certain backwater parts of america
so
you get why trap is such a horrible word
plus if you know anything about the idea of the trans panic clause in america
knowing the root you can understand the intent
Admiral Akbar if you recall?
which is simultaneously transphobic and also homophobic cause it implies having a dick must automatically mean gay and that is automatically bad with 4chan
the term came from star wars episode 6
it does if you are filled with vile bigotry
in the same branch as you didnt commit vehicular manslaughter because someone shot your car
its considered a valid defence
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxeB2AXIG3E this video doesnt stop being relevant btw if yall want more about the topic
shemmy might wana spoiler tag a bit of that
they all moved to QAnon so dont worry bout it
one of the grand wizards of the KKK (A mega racist basically) tweeted traps are gay or some crap like that
speaking of the KKK
||There has been legal precedent where if you are for example a man and you murder a trans women that your defence can be that you didnt know and when you prepared to fuck them and noticed a dick you had such a gamer moment you commit a homicide and thats why you arent guilty of anything. ||
Trying to ban guns in the sense of america (or what democrats have tried to do in the past with very limited success) ignores the main issue of toxic masculinity
America has more of a gun problem than just amount. The culture surrounding guns is far more toxic and harmful than just pure numbers at this point
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BxvxbZGjlv4> a really cool vid from a rural leftist youtuber i like talking about guns as a whole in america if yall are interested
I wasnt linking his video to prove the point "the rest of the world has just as much murder?
Also i just wana say
The thing is with hrt (so estrogen and T) is that you really should be using them as an adult
No no
I remember reading a statement from a 70 year old queer brit who started to feel scared to trust *fellow gays* because we have publicly black lesbian terfs calling trans people a cult
uk has just gone super turbo terf recently and it’s concerned living here tbh

Yeah I shouldn’t be oppression olympics’ing this. Sorry
Thats also true
Maybe why i feel its marginally better is because i feel like the whole us healthcare system is so fucked that it feels like a slightly less bitter pill to swallow compared to NHS vs trans healthcare
Right but at least if you have the money you can get something. In the UK having the money isn’t inherently good because our private sector for trans healthcare is shoddy
I dont see you ever facing a 2+ years waiting list just to get your foot in the door
My understanding of the US system is that its somewhat better
Its just access which is where uk takes the shit hat of hell world for trans people
Absolute blast those peeps
I mean i knew people starting at ages 50+
Hrt is also this kinda thing where you can start pretty much whenever in your life
So in my case im taking anti androgens to stop the nasty men shit and estrogen for tits and other things
Replacement
Until you can decide whether you would like to start hrt
Like the scare about kids doing irreprable damage to their body (which is what agab puberty is tbh) goes away when puberty blockers is literally hitting pause on it
Blockers also give kids time
Would you perhaps have considered puberty blockers?
The psychological and physical impact is tremendous and studied
The wrong puberty needs to be recognised in this discussion as severe bodily harm i feel
Very much

I love how in p5 its shown that the police and justice system is deeply fucked and that the solution is getting rid of like one or two guys and everything will be fine <a:mmGold:393926007649861632>
It handles trans people like dogshit
Unless you mean to argue that the cases where morgana gets absurdly creepy horny over “ann-dono” was influencing to his character arc
P5 doesn’t benefit from it
That way nobody has to be objectified in the first place
I mean I think you can also just not sexually objectify the sexual assault survivor
We dont need to strive for equality in the dumpsters
Makoto wants to be a cop. Nuff said about that
Her heroic speech is done by the male instead
Haru has problems with a patriarchal society dominating her every action and shackling her

So she gets snubbed by a sexual assault case waiting to happen in the form of the male cat mascot
Like holy fuck you have your first female character suffer sexual abuse from a bastard and you give her a latex cat suit in battle and all the guys leer at her like shes candy
God p5 rubbed me off the wrong way once i looked at it more critically
*here’s hoping my PIP application gets through fine*
Like the biggest possible strain on both
It’s depressing how the tories have defunded the nhs and the welfare state and then this happens
Probably cause it was shown that it just caused more covid cases
Turns out killing off your populous is fucking bad for spending
The fuck do you mean secret

Im not looking forward to having to live in it
Britain is a failed state
Realistically it’s about 24 ish% of the british population that voted to leave
That wasn’t everyone who could vote
Mind you
52/48
Everyone knows what the results would be
They aint been playing for 4 years
Cliffs edge brexit
With no deal
We are genuinely leaving the EU very fuckin soon
God fuck this stupid island
Its just
Im very well aware
I know
They weren’t stopped
A tremendous amount of people packed into trains to go north
So when tier 4 was suddenly hit
Tory officials constantly ignoring their own governments rules have degraded trust in lockdown and stuff
Very much so
It isn’t here
And we voted **boris fucking johnson** because of a cacophony of misinformation and propaganda that was flimsily held together
Jeremy corbyn
Our one out
I think historians will look back at this point and feel utterly confused
Theres a dangerous pandemic thats just mutated to be more infectious and our PM has constantly made it perfectly clear that hes a fuckup who only cares about disaster capitalism for his friends rather than caring about the people he was elected to give a shit about
Like it’s starting to make thatcher look like she was a dent in the system
I find it depressing that the tories managed to bathe themselves in more fucking blood than before
Shite

fuck the bbc
Hope you understand thats what ive been trying to say?
That’s really rude
A free market doesn’t have regulation. Nothing at all to hinder capitalism or businesses
Or even forming together to “generate more profit”
Because nothings stopping the big company from dicking hard on smaller ones
Monopolies is what happens in a free market
The end goal as it were
The current system *is* unrestricted capitalism
Dunno bout you but when you say free market my mind is thinking of “unrestricted capitalism”
That’s happening cause of the free market. Nothings exactly stopping these bastards from doing that rn because they have the freedom to deprive others of literally life saving medicine for profit
I find it highly depressing that for more than a decade we have looked at the US system and gone “yes fuck the nhs we want that lets build towards that!”
Not really cause it would just cost more
NHS before you decide that defunding it to siphon money to rich people is great for the people
Neurodivergents are getting a bit more fucked hard in the uk and me being politically aware of that and transphobia means nothing because im not a one woman army. Barely the strength of a woman <:ElfneinTrip:688025973932687377>
Im far too fucked internally to provide anything more than shitposting online.
Mood
Absolutely no preparation
We’ve known this would happen for **years**
Like we have tremendously long ass lorry queues
You know that the past 5-10 years has been a contest between the two to see who can dick their own country down the hardest
“Small”
And by sacrificing that small population we produce “better” standards for the rest
And its great until you realise that a large portion if not all of our capitalist society is build on the foundry of underpaid sweatshops which sane people would call slavery
Utilitarianism is great until you get to the city of omelas
<a:a_:782873833270542346>
My bad
Ah i saw utilitarianism and got far too excited
Some of you all might be interested in something called “The Survival Lottery” if yall on this topic of organs and the ethicalness of it all i suppose
Oof missed the utilitarian debate i see
Well maybe but its worth checking with your doc
Cunts
Its a very straight person joke of mocking your kids for showing affection at a young age even if it’s innocent

Dats how you dont have your kids ever come out to ya
Oof
Like that can happen for cis people
see why i was suggesting some like checking hormone levels was because I wouldn’t be surprised if matt was just not getting enough T and needs a lil bit more
Trust me. It can still hurt
It’s disrespectful. Like trying to deny someone their own identity ya know?
Cis or not
Ur a guy and it sucks being misgendered
Aint a stupid reason at all
But it’s important too

The goblins are but a pest and a minor inconvenience. And are also extremely dangerous and will rape and kill anything in its way. So much so that babies are automatically marked for death as there is no possible redemption. The only solution is genocide
Its something you see in white supremest ideology. Other races being genetically or inherently evil or inferior
Races being inherently evil or bad
Im a lass
The fact that it was lore in the first place is damming to this whole bloody notion of races which comes from a racist root and is pretty shit for fiction
Mate that aint the point
Also tashas also has an entire chapter where racial scores are just do whatever
Its been removed via eratta
We aren’t even touching how black elves are lore wise considered very evil and horrible people and the few that are good are like chaotic neutral at best ish

TW rape
the problem with shield hero is first the whole false rape accusation leading to the incel story of women bad get revenge by calling her bitch or whatever
i mean i read the manga and also the first few episodes of shield hero
i mean it feels like a shield hero situation tbh
and it is portrayed and presented to make the protagonist look very justified and correct in his actions
tw rape
||girls rape the fuck out of this healer person because they can get xp or something

he gets another chance to do everything over again so what he does is go back to that situation just to rape all the girls back after it||
from what i remember reading about the plot which ill spoiler tag for the sake of everyone reading
A common dangerous enemy who is numerous and needs to be exterminated at all cost, and yet can be easily killed and destroyed with minimal effort if society put effort into it
Might be better to recontextualise it as it borrows language and ideas of race used a lot by white supremest ideology to demean “the enemy” 

The common example is Jewish people as nazi Germany gave us good example of propaganda but you can also apply the same mindset and language to american blacks
and it really just gets worse
ive read far enough of the manga to basically reach where id say s2 would end
that is unfortunately applying good writing into something that is more shallow than you think. it would be smart if it was really an unreliable narrator sort of thing but it really isnt
same way we will probably get a ton of villainess isekai adaptations thanks to bakarina being animated
redo is just capitalising on that market
cough cough vic
if you think more about the whole slavery aspect then you stop wanting to hate the other 3 heroes
its shallow because if you dig deeper the revenge porn boner is cut off from logic
who are presented as antagonistic for *being against slavery and believing a rape accusation when they hear one*
like the other three heroes
also when they blow their load with the princess getting their whole revenge thing they just make it so that theres more people to pick on the shield hero
raphtalia is a child in an adults body
while exclusively recruiting children who fall in love with him
and then the fact that the dude is marketed as a good slave owner

nobody is immune to media and how it influences people. to a certain level watching that show and going "huh i think i can stomach the rest of the show" says a lot about ones character. for starters it shows that you can watch redo and not be so appalled and disgusted that something was even created

the fact that im even under a private care thingy in the first place telling an nhs doctor about it is painful
side tangent but the current doctor i had basically clamped up on being supportive of me using a certain private gender care place and wants me to spend what would be a fuckton of cash just to switch to another different place
its those kinds of questions and the doctor be like "well i guess you are probably trans. lets talk about getting you some drugs
"well you see i liked to dress up like a gorl"
imagine waiting fucking 26 years to figure out if you are trans
essentially a "are you trans" test

Humans are fascinating in that they will always find a way to make exceptions to the rule
Its alright matt. Trust that the very fact you are trying to understand nakes you far less of a bad person you think you are
Pronouns are just how we like to be preferred in a comfortable way. Akin to a name if you think about it
I think i get that logic
Yeah
I do not have a gender. Simply do not refer to me
We operate on the language which is not accommodating after all
I think its called gender abolitionism or something
*whether or not gender roles and expectations like male and female itself should be a thing is another debate entirely*
You are very much trying to learn
Idiots don’t try to learn me thinks
I know how that feels but do remember that it can be both a blessing and a curse. Ive found that for me to be the case at least
“The wisest person knows that they know nothing”
Whicu is the exact opposite of stupidity
Nah its okay matt this was a good convo we all probably learned a lot
If we had no concept of gender and it was scrubbed from everyones memory then it would cease to exist as people would gravitate less towards sticking to “gender” and just be who they want to be. Thats the gender abolitionist route anyways
That scans
Yeah
What does it really mean for me to say im a girl
We cram a **lot** of things into just one word
What your soul thinks and feels
Its such a raw personal thing what you are fundamentally
Ultimately gender is how you identify and want the world to see. You could make the argument that a cis male who one day works out and the other day decides to i dunno not work out i guess would be their expression of gender changing but ultimately that wouldn’t change who they identify as and what they are comfortable with unless they would explicitly find that shift to be so significant to them that they do infact ask for different pronouns and present their gender identity differently
Is that not still toxic culture?
*the main problem really is the toxic masculinity culture surrounded by guns*
Well it would make sense to actually target specific things rather than say a word and then go “well its this this and this”
Don’t know if this was said but i saw it being discussed. Isnt the term assauly weapon fundamentally non existent in a fire arm sense?
Its worth soul searching just to try and visualise what you want and understand if thats who you really are. Hard to imagine that when you’ve probably never felt comfortable in your own body but the best thing you can do is aim towards something like that

and the cycle continues
cruelty begets cruelty
its pretty easy to generate support if your enemy shoots up a mosque for example
or shoots children 
or uses white phosphorus
it certainly doesnt help. like its much easier to radicalise people if they are being brutally oppressed
but thats what it feels like is going on
not saying that is whats going on
if that makes sense
what im trying to say is that it feels like a lot of civilians are stuck between a rock and a hard place and at least the rocks "stopping" the hard place
i dont mean to imply that their motives are exactly pure
like it seems like hamas gathers a lot of palestinian support and attention from the fact that Israeli very much doesnt treat palestinians right to put it lightly
i also feel like you could stop a massive amount of the support hamas has from palestinians by not pushing them back into a wall between accepting death and eradication from a state thats been bombing and evicting them for quite a long while but thats my two cents about it
i feel like theres a very very thin line for the isreli government from removing hamas to wiping out palestinians like they have been doing for quite a while. id be more willing to trust an international community doing so as long as eyes are very very much on the process to make sure even more bloodshed is at least prevented as much
🙃
https://twitter.com/mlothianmclean/status/1393123865451241472?s=19
so when palestinians are brutally murdered by airstrikes because hamas may have been hiding in that population does that mean they are justified in striking back in the very state that commited those atrocities?
no i havent but that doesnt make my argument invalid
so fucking what? does that make murdering them justified?
nor are any form of non-combatants
children arent terrorists
like i said. we arent getting anyway by denying warcrimes commited
both palestinian AND Israeli civilians
the militaries and governments behind these can honestly fuck themselves cause its the civilians that are being fucked by it
we arent getting anywhere by denying it
and if you werent aware my original statement was that because both the idf and hamas are out atrocitying eachother its making it easier to radicalise people and continue the cycle of violence
both unintentionally AND intentionally
???
i mean if kids throw rocks at your truck and you respond by shooting them down then your a big piece of shit
there are incidents in which it has been done on purpose
not collateral damage... which is still really fucking bad mind you
im talking about incidents where IDF are actively firing upon children
i think we can both agree on that
thats far too painfully simple of what is the entire conflict
no point really pretending that any of this violence can be justified because of the many many many steps and violence taken in the past to get to this point. at this point its just perpetuating the cycle of revenge, vioence and bloodshed which will be felt more on civilian populations
thats very simple governmenting
you dont get one without the other
dont see why you wana try rehashing that
i feel like we already had this discussion about peoples personal experiences
please dont dare to assume i believe it is in any way the fault of any civilian currently getting absolutely fucked by this situation. thats probably the most offensive thing i can imagine
no i am not. i am saying that the military which is a branch of the government is at fault
this is mind you just looking at cases where the idf "accidentally" kill a bunch of civilians. there are still plenty and plenty of incidents where the idf have actively harmed and damaged civilian populations. not even because they are hamas but because they were palestinian
is that the hill you want to be on?
so blood for blood
nobody is saying do nothing
as it turns out doing what you do to palestinians makes the situation much much worse
personally im pro not denying atrocities and dressing them up more fancy then they actually are in the first place
so kill them first?
i felt as if these kinds of actions would lead to radicalisation
thats what i originally said

Changing minds and spreading awareness is minor in the grand scheme of an entire political system and power which has worked a long time now to make people dependent on the very thing keeping them down
Its also kinda really easy to just feel really hopeless. There’s only so much one can do
<@127848372131463168> bit backtracking but if i can add that ive personally seen that for anyone thats left enough to actually give a shit about the countless evils being done constantly in the world that it just gets incredibly exhausting
Oh no god forbid bad things happen to minorities i wonder who would *ever* let that happen
Bur be hat doesn’t address fuck all about *why* people dont trust cops

You either die a hero or live live long enough to become a villain. And by die i mean either fired or “accidentally killed” by your colleagues
Like you are arguing acab isnt true because well *my* coppers are good they dont shoot people and that’s missing the point if anything
Cypher im very glad your police system is as good as you claim to be but that doesn’t really address much about even why acab is a popular slogan with some of the most vulnerable people. Its not because they are being brainwashed ill tell ya. It comes from real desperate fear of an institution that typically does not care about them

or you know get into isekai animes
kids growing up fantasising that they are actually a super special wizard rather than living in a shitty society which is very cruel and unfair
a lot of times these kinds of things act as a way to express something that they would have never been able to before
with queer people
right but theres an extra layer i feel
it sucks that a lot of queer people end up getting quite attached to influential shitty people. seen it enough times and it feels rough every time xd
and also further reinforces to anyone deep in that train that everyone is out to get him and that hes right
gets people talking about him
it gets more painful when you get a queer person who ends up defending someone who has dogshit cringe views

hows starmer doing in the polls lately then cause i am quite certain hes been quite behind boris for like most of the pandemic
i wonder how much of that is people being murdered by pure evil
thats funny
lmao

how much did it raise tho
the answer is he **fucking rose**
with what you know
like the past year or so
how hard do you think boris fell in the polls with everythings thats going on <@!379337518371307522>
hes unpopular and a neoliberal wanker
starmer is a wet rag
and that they have enough political sway behind them that it aint changing any time soon
and that they have enough numbers and powers in politics to fuck us over
but terf island also comes from the fact that the island is riddled with terfs
yeah thats cause we are fuckin based

and keep in mind this is just whats already existing that we bloody fucking know of
iirc astrovenica or whatever its spelt like is only around 60% effective with two doses
plus the new variant is able to tear through some of the vaccines used
the icing on the cake will be if italy wins hard

Like take a look outside a window near you if possible. Even a picture sent over onlime wont fully be able to capture that unique experience of actually being there
Like i can’t really ever convey how im lying down in my bed over online nor could any of you convey what you doing on your own device to have this conversation
We all have actual lives outside of discord
Its much worse on a platform like this i fear just because of how global it is
I like to imagine we live in relatively safe lives but all sorts of things could happen. Accidents or personal stuff or even just drifting away. And like that a face you spoke to is gone
Yall are just faces and names on a discord channel. People come and go.

One day and you may never know it shall be the last time you speak to anyone here
I have something else to add with all this talk of morality and shit

Plus also as it turns out pissing off all of your unions who fund you and also actively telling people to leave labour means less cash in the coffer **imagine my surprise**
Whatever your stance is, its being used as a justification to remove more lefty individuals from the party to make it more neoliberal
While there are antisemetic actors in labour, theres also people who talk about palestine in a positive light
Antisemetic cases in this context is talking about how the current labour party is doing a big ol purge on the more lefty parts of labour
This… is not that related to keir starmers labour being short on cash
When corbyn left labour was quite solidly in the green if thats what you are asking?
The wha?

I mean theres a decent article attached to the title if that helps written by someone who works on psychology
https://humanparts.medium.com/amp/p/3af27e312d01?__twitter_impression=true thought some people would like to read this :)
yes but the fact that they transitioned means that a good chunk of that behaviour will be used by absolute wankers to push back trans rights. its a depressing situation
gonna be way easier for lawmakers to deflect on the bad trans bad than it will be to let that focus on the fact that its allowed in the first place
i mean the tweet you just posted i believe misgenders the topic at hand as why this is even being discussed no?
yay i hope this wont lead to any form of transphobic rhetoric
👏 more 👏 bi 👏 sexual predators 👏

if they believe iraq had them im sure theyd believe a virus had em
just tell the us government that covid has weapons of mass destruction lmao
Ive personally heard and seen a lot of disturbing things in regards to vaush
<:twisted:753068684150308864>
talking about this masterpost
one thing ill say is that when i brought this up on a different place i got called a tankie which i found very odd
cw a lot of disturbing stuff ||https://www.reddit.com/r/Enough_Vaush_Spam/comments/ou0d2u/vaush_has_a_very_disturbing_preoccupation_with/||
the only problem was that the place i found it was a subreddit called enough vaush spam soo like i have to recognise theres an obvious bias but i do believe that what i read was an actual thing
i kinda regret doing so because it wasnt a comfortable read
cause i ended up researching the person cause i saw that he was controversial to say the least and i wanted to see exactly what it was about
sorry had to leave for a bit but i just had like my 2 cents i wanted to add about the whole vaush thing cause i dont think i ever elaborated on what i meant by creepy stuff
i watched an nb youtuber who i trust their content enough of that went over the whole video and the quote i brought out was just the tip of the iceberg tbh
that thank you melua
about people on twitter telling her buck is a cunt
sorry wording bad
on twitter
i wana add that quote is from people telling her about how buck angel is a cunt
...
i wouldnt even say video essays
i mean according to contra you cant tell between a trans girl with an anime avatar and a a nazi pretending to be a trans girl with an anime avatar <:LMFAO:473670835748601858>
^_^
gonna join NIP even tho im gonna be living in brighton
or really the extent of the harm that ended up happening to the nb community or even people she ended up naming in her cancelling video
the one thing ive learned talking to people about whats happened with contrapoints is that not a lot of people actually know what happened. not a lot of people know that she tweeted after the video came out publicly naming buck angel and giving a lil thanks for that. or that shes ever actually recognised that buck is a cuntbag arsehole in the first place
her verson of events are in the video titled cancelled
and it sucks a lot cause i dont really see how it'll get better
its a very internet thing
intentionally or not
the lgbtq+ community is understandably hurting for people to look up to and that leads to people who will happily abuse that for their own purposes
ive reached a point to where i persoally kinda feel bad for people who are hardcore stans for people like vaush and stuff because i personally feel as if its a manipulative parasocial relationship
the british wit catches yet another victim
twas a joke
and a liberal centrist <a:mmGold:393926007649861632>
not even recognise hes a harmful abusive sack of shit
it became platforming their ideas when she went on the record to defend him
buck angel
and thats personally kinda led me to feel like theres an almost culture of sorts of people who "stan" people even if they end up doing harmful things. cough cough contrapoints for example
these days im glad i just stopped i guess the right word is hero worshiping "breadtube" because ive had to recognise that my political activism doesnt begin and end with watching a youtuber
i figured they did considering i got called one when i brought this to attention but i didnt know *why*
I think when you understand JKs politics you can see it bleed into what she writes and has written
Unless your media is about to democratically elect a socialist government that aint happening <:LMFAO:473670835748601858>
its a powerful place here
one thing this server does is either change people for the better or leave them condemmed to be forever ignorant and inable to grow me feels
Still logs of me being a fUCKING moron about it in this very channel lmao
This server was and still is also wildly trans as fuck
<:romcom:627597926872383499>
*plus im barely a system im like 1.5 people at this point*
Ill just pretend i was the first to satisfy my narcissism <:Dab:518292370492489739>
I knew about ourselves but wasnt public about it till you did so really
Funny how this server quickly became a really nice hotspot for plural systems too
Like melua ^_^
But theres still plenty o people who’ve stuck around all these years
From then? Like barely anyone from what I remember. I think cast and lone are two nice blokes whove been here a while. I think mel joined few months after me but other than that i can’t remember many more faces sadly
Weird reading all this convo considering ive been here since December 2017. So many yall are new faces
No its his Child/daughter/som rady
the painful part is even if america wants to remobilise into the region, they arent gonna find anyone willing to help them considering how theyve dealt with interpreters and those literally risking their lives to help them out
ah ok thanks kat
but i havent been keeping much if any track about whats going on in the middle east. whats happened to ISIL
hey this is a stupid question
Perhaps its asking for first responses and people are blaming bush for not adequately dealing with the taliban
He never was lmao
I barely remember the video because its very… produced and doesnt hold my attention well
I just wana know what because im curious
I can easily understand that there’s problems with it
I mean
Sorry if this is really ignorant but what kinda problems did that video have? I mainly ask cause its like the only reference point i have on anything rbwy media related
Bad wolf was purely a s1 thing and from what I remember they kinda wrote thinking this was gonna be the only season they had

Turns out dr who was what the british public needed in 2005
Thats great but not many people can watch 4 hour videos and thats valid
Valid
If thats true it wasnt changing ur mind its lying about being a fan at the time when you weren’t
If true:
<:LMFAO:473670835748601858>
I was under the impression poland is currently very right wing
Like maybe leaving thr house
Its a benefit for those who struggle with a lot of stuff thst makes their life difficult
Personal independent payment
And not just pure fashies but also conservatives happy to betray their country
I feel like what left wing we have in the uk are outbumbered by enough fashies
That’s always the danger eh
And the letter they sent back indicated they didnt read anything about me and just said i was capable
I got declined pip
Funny enough i can’t imagine there are that many that have even been accepted into it with the government shafting people into getting the money they need
Universal credits is our benefits system for the unaware
I mean i saw in the news that universal credits is being cut 80 quid

Surpisingly you might learn that neurodivergent people are both bad at explaining and also understanding a lot of the time
Thats okay
That means you work
You need money to feed yourself and have shelter
You can’t really avoid what the world wants you to do at all tho is what im saying
No doubt its a bitch to live with and be in but that doesn’t deny the fact that if given an actual chance by the world we live in i would be insanely productive 

Just not in the way society wants
Well thats a small compass of people that don’t really understand much about autism tbh
Could be wrong
I think the word is eugenics
Imagine that but just killing it before it starts
People literally started poisoning themselves and their children because they’ve been fed enough propaganda that autism is bad and horrible
Oh that’s another thing.
Im scared for when we develop the technology to either detect or remove autism from the womb
Because that’s disgusting im not accepted when we have the resources for it
Thats not my fault, thats the society we are in for not accommodating for it
Even if it means I physically am incapable of doing certain tasks
Take away my autism, you’d take away my very personality and thats on the ethical level of murder imo
And i think me getting hyper focused on an anime I can personally say is made bad is one of them lmao
Neurodivergency is definitely more common with niche kinda places
I just wish i had the support. But unfortunately hyper capitalist society doesn’t accept neurodivergency
I wouldn’t not have it. The person i would be without it is like if you tore my soul out

I studied politics for my a levels so i know the British political history roughly from 45 onwards
1945 brought about attlee who was one of the key figures in the foundation of the nhs
I jest but if you rightfully considered blair a right cunt of a pm politically, then we haven’t had a left politician for a very long time
1945 <a:defaultline:651459548019949618>
That implies that there was a state at some point in the last 20 years we had a clue
I take offence you say anymore
Theres a thing called the male gaze. From what I remember its where we have media made from men and that can influence how the cameras are shot for example
Do people even know who he was today?
Not letting fashies and such have a space to spread their hate speech. Anything from being removed from social medias to having milkshakes thrown at them to prevent their public speeches
Well not wrong all of the time
Its not wrong to enjoy but it’s important to know why for example it can be a bit toxic to have
Or most anime
Me writing underaged girls for anime and sexualising them at every chance i can

Is there an option to just.. silently leave?
Otherwise you’ll have to identify why you are uncomfortable and if its solvable
If you feel like its something ya can’t really ever become comfortable in there again
I guess hand the reigns to someone else and leave?
Just checmed YouTube, fine on my end
https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-58780465
That’s roughly what i was thinking too
Nope
Again it’s not as simple for me to say only black people should write black people
Its less about maliciousness (i doubt many of those who do so are acting with bad intentions), its just how cultures have interacted with the “white” people. Its a messy and complicated thing to talk about how media… be i guess. And personally id rather a cishet white author looking to write hispanic coded people to think more about if they want to be the one to tell that story on their behalf I suppose
A part of it could be the writers doing it in the first place if that helps. I certainly wouldn’t feel that great about white people writing hispanic speech like that

Yeah except showing pride gets you into severe trouble

Its the people who get the update day 1
Yeah they do
If i may ask, what is *new* for windows 11 because so far it seems like an os upgrade for the sake of having one

Im not joking

Labour opposition leader keith starmer actually tried a lorry exam

Cypher this is the country where a tory mp bitches about not being paid enough

While voting consistently to slash benefits for the vulnerable
Okay boomer
Rady u should defo watch the two vids me and fenny linked ^_^
We should demand better than accept lootboxes in games at all
Despite one leading to the other directly
Tougher pill to swallow capitalism being bad than lootboxes are bad
The latest way to swindle vulnerable people out of their cash for the rich ceos to not pay taxes on their blood money
You’ll end up with capitalism “breeding innovation”
I mean follow the gacha lootbox thread up the chain enough
Oo yeah thats a good one too
I mean they’ve basically been covering all this for years now
Fyi they nb
https://youtu.be/7S-DGTBZU14 this video of theirs continues to be relevant
Fenny do you by chance watch James Stephanie Sterling?

But also I think thats not the point anyway
Im like not good at explaining stuff so forgive me if I probably almost definitely forget and undersell the celebration
So you’d probably be getting around 15 ds out of the 50 required for a pull
Ontop of everything else i should add
And i believe they power creep a lot because its a fully pve game so its not like anybody cares
For like a month for the 350 million download celebration every day they gave out 1/5th of a full gacha pull
I still splash cash on it
Super generous
Hell i play dokkan
Actually spent cash on it after getting to the slow down grind stuff
Once played a game bonkers ago called food fantasy or something
Especially for neurodivergent idiots like me
Gacha being free to try can arguably be even more ethically questionable
Depression quest from what i recall did depression as a game mechanic decency enough funny that
Slot machines but the presentations different
Like gacha or lootboxes

Atheism is a religion, I believe that was the easiest way to set those people off
I prefer the term groomed cause it sometimes really feels as if these shite ideologies can creep in from bad influences
I mean imo a simple example I think of is not putting up with hate speech stuff
Theres definitely ways to reduce the harm “bad people” can do
The tldr was that these kinds of places attract people that end up being quite vulnerable to right wing radicalisation especially if moderators aren’t prepared to deal with people “in the community”
Theres a video series ive watched who did a video on this sorta problem that exists with these kinds of online spaces

Makes it doubley shite discord, twitter and reddit are hyper accelerating to crypto crap especially since a small minority of absolute fucking cunts are pushing iy
Crap people trying to speedrun an ancap society
Because i could see someone could easily replace how clunky it was
Yeah but i never thought that about skype in the first place
I feel like discord has gotten youtube big
We’d all lose out on those social connections
People arent just gonna stop using discord or Twitter or anything
*and more depressing that a good chunk of us are apathetic because it’s exhausting*
Especially since I think most people can just feel that a very small minority of tech head cuntbags are pushing these decisions
Makes us feel like the world is just accelerating to hyper capitalism
Its a depressing situation i guess seeing more and more companies just invest energy into it
Minimal in the sense that not enough can organise and coordinate i guess
At least it feels to minimal anyway
And what working class folk actually care are too minimal
I dont feel the middle class are all that fussed about it
Rich wankers
I don’t know what that means

Well the problem is inherently that the end goal is deregulation to make more profit. To regulate capitalism to the point where a powerful individual/corporation with a lot of financial sway you essentially have something borderline socialist anyways
I enjoy that as much as it feels like we are memeing its probably for me at least the more comprehensible way i can even effectively communicate gender
<:huggo:532336272740581377>
Oh also i dont mean to dogpile you matt i just saw that and wanted to contribute
Its like a void that screeches out with she/they pronouns
Also the big problem is that when you use the reply feature it automatically selects to ping them unless you turn that off
Used to indicate i was a trans women but err genders a fuck so i just say trans
I indicate im trans in my name
Me
<:MikuDelete:661660028410920990>
I think a direct ping bypasses a lot of that I believe
Very smart me
Which comes with different social… word thingy about norms
Maybe part of it is how… global we all are
it isnt human nature to be selfish tho?
thus
and people with more money have more votes and influence
regulation means less money
you cant talk a lot about these issues *without* addressing the giant capitalist elephant in the room i find
the systems working as intended
id call it capitalism
ah so they should produce in china because it will cost less
them being big businesses
i mean i think its just them making an investment in chinese production
say for example india
https://novaramedia.com/2021/10/27/is-china-the-worlds-worst-climate-culprit/ ayyy i found it
i believe china has a tremendous amount of hydro and wind power
and also have invested tremendously into hydro power
plus they have a population of a billion
tremendous shifting of production to china means china produces more
yeah, thats the big thing
i remember reading an article that i for the life of me cant find but it was looking at how china ends up so high on these lists
going back to climate change
and im not angry at you either, i just want you to understand that what you are proposing sucks balls and isnt really fast enough i think
im speaking personally cy because this shit affects me and thats unavoidable
ill teach the young whats right by not letting them suffer the same hell i had to by changing the system
its what i was thinking about talkin to the high school bloke
whats that mlk quote
which is false
no you are just saying that nothing will fundamentally change until the young people actually get on it
im fighting to sort it now
im not gonna just give up and say "the next generation will sort it"
because thats what i said to this person i knew
along with the rest of my generation
so i should just suffer
im currently getting my hormones from a legal grey area
because im dying without support
teach the new generation
basically what you are suggesting now
they said that for trans rights to be accepted in society what we needed to do was educate the young and *they* would push that change
i had a person i knew in high school i think is the american term
that line of argument
sorry cy you just reminded me of something
sounds like evil communism you cant do that lank
having a leader doesnt mean there is selfishness in a society tho?
perhaps that will shift the brains of people to be a bit more selfish
Capitalism
say
a culture which encourages a system where theres a hierarchy
well the key word there nevis is culture no?
i dont think they were cy
ah cool
who said i did?
it was heavy then for me
i was saying that in the sense that my generation got this education cy
we are teaching the young (the ones we can and are allowed to, and that doesnt guarantee they will recieve meaninful power in the future due to how our current system works) about climate change
Double jeopardy iirc
Cant be charged for the same crime twice
Its setting a dangerous precedent

Imagine my surprise
Centrist rag paper guardian strikes again
Say for example some people here *outraged* at the suggestion 6yo voting
Its the extreme just to make certain people mad that they suggested it
6yo voting is such a nothing argument
I haven’t talked much about starmer and the stuff ive seen cause it’s depressing to kinda look at the crap boris is doing and then to look to the other side of the bench to see keith has his head stuck in a bin
Pro business *really* wanted to kill an Alpaca vs pro business peppa pig enjoyer yeah my options are incredible
Pro business or pro business

https://mobile.twitter.com/stefan_boscia/status/1462527504997048326
I know, im just conpounding what you said iski
6yo is just the extreme
Yall be seeing the 6yo part and not the part where young people,whos lives are literally being fucked over by an older generation banking the planet away, have no political representation
Good luck doing that while trying to compete with corporations and being successful enough to actually make it
Imagine if the state funded public transit better
Rady i hope you know thats a shite argument?
Seems like an argument against this system rather than assisted suicide as a whole tho?
arguably worse than dying from a chronic life threat because at least you can go out knowing yourself
i wouldnt want to wish upon anyone anything like Alzheimer
I think if you shout at a distant cougar itd be intimidated if anything
Humans usually scream out some coherent word, typically help
Thats not even me saying capitalism bad that’s literally what i learned in my classes
Its investor culture to specifically demand short term profits because that means their cut of pay gets higher
figured
i believe they are someone who (and please correct me if im getting details wrong i dont understand it well) have an nft creating thingy?
and i imagine they are making a lot more money then i could ever hope to achieve if i tried getting in now
ubisoft, discord and reddit, all sorts ive seen kinda milking that cow as hard as they can
like big companies jumping on it too as well
very much feels like the only people really benefiting from this are the mega wealthy and those exceedingly lucky
Cause ya know, gotta privatise everything 

Even Rail!
I know in the uk, its been a plan for our right wing government to underfund it to shite and use the fact that its failing due to a lack of funds to further remove funds
That definitely scans, but i cant confirm it cause I genuinely can’t remember which is parody which came true and genuine fact
But hey at least Keith Starmer is totally a socialist and not secretly wanking to a Blair body pillow when nobody is looking
Neoliberal brainworms at its finest
Gotta love a leader who invites thatcher into 10 Downing Street
*america* didnt privatise rail and blair thought he could do it himself
Clearly you havent been blair pilled
The tories have no real plans for something like that

Like I can understand taking strategic points like airports
So question for like the more military ish people here

What is modern doctrine on attacking and defending in an age where civilians are able to track troop movement and also disrupt through cyber warfare

Oh <@!87512939107450880> you’ll like this.

Same twat un ironically sprouts shit like hes not a racist and then say stuff like “british officers dont bitch and moan like Italian officers”
Targeting specifically russian people rather than the nation
Im far too uninformed and too depressed to really care much. I just know that ive been dealing with a racist stepdad whos been sprouting literal nazi propaganda about travellers, and ive just so happened to hear similar ish narratives some more of the scumfucky people ive had to unfortunately deal with in my life
<:grill:705273992042512427>
Do you mean the war? Or something specific
Which situation
Real “its not racism because they are bad” moment
<:LMFAO:473670835748601858>
Gonna own the russian government by further alienating the russian citizens and blaming all russian people as if they are responsible
Psychopathic shit here
Im not too tuned into american news stuff, how do they handle british royalty?
It also explains why when BJs councillor at the time (money budget man) was announcing his budget, the BBC presented it as if he was **superman**
Funny enough i believe the bbcs main political writer, Laura kurensberg (i butchered her last name) was i believe found to be a massive boris johnson simp to put it in words that make my brain laugh
Wheras fox news for example is a different beast
And as a brit i can more argue that the bbc is much more of a state shithole
They also platform flat earthers and climate change deniers
Outlets like fox news i could probably blame almost single-handedly for American conservatives being pro russia
In british media we just got a lot of racism when meghan shit happened
Huh
Until I can volunteer (im disabled probably not anytime soon) I imagine ideas are the best I feel I’ll be able to do <:sadcowboy:510303995215085569>

Hey you are a writer and a symphogear one at that surely you are familiar with a hate box ^_^
As a response they fired trans netflix employees who protested it
Dave chappelle
<:pepega:504408080285564948>
Ah yes I remember now this translator defended this by saying its more accurate to our times to say left wing extremists
…
At the bare minimum this one is
And Netflix is a shite company who stans transphobia
I don’t exactly remember or care cause they are a shite translator
Iirc they were anti vax or something similar to that extent
~~and is also kinda unhinged on twitter~~
Is that the Netflix translation? My understanding was the problem was the translator deliberately changed lines referencing a terrorist attack to left wing antifa terrorism
Wankers like John Barrowman getting national tv saying that cancel culture ruined his life while his accusers get harassed and shut out of the conversation
My fundamental issue with cancel culture is it is whatever boogeyman you want it to mean
False accusations and likes have existed long before the term cancel culture became a thing. Not that rapists and predators have said that accusations have used the cancel culture bandwagon to gain sympathy. Forgive me if the fact that the minority of times of false accusations dont warm me up to the notion that people who openly criticise poor famous people who will still get employment by the end of the day
and its bad because errr stop calling me mean things see the left is bad
cancel culture is when minorities call you out for your dogshit cunt views
instead of receiving the bootlicking of the BBC
imagine if she actually couldnt get any form of publicity or support for her dogshit views
god i fucking wish she was cancelled like she bitches about
Same way people like vic can be “cancelled” and still get paid
My understanding of the cancelling is that it ruins someones life so much that its irrecoverable
Okay but he hasn’t been cancelled tho?
Ignoring the whole “changing a line to be left wing extremism is telling of which american news network you at least subscribe to enough to parrot in translation work”
Also hold on id bet money that guys still getting translation pay so hows he been cancelled?
Also lower unemployment by forcing workers to build the autobahn
One thing I remember from my GCSEs was that workers were given funky amounts of labour rights in weird parts. Like I know tying with volkswagen there was schemes for worker holidays which iirc was a grift
Maybe losing Destiny hit him harder than I thought
Hasan giving me vaush “actually jews did disproportionately hold banking power in nazi germany” vibes
I always find it funny thinking about actual liberals and my… dislike of them to put it one way
Because its liberalism the term being used I’m imagining its right wingers
I wonder what kinda liberalism
Threads get archived, plus a prompt discussion wouldn’t last longer than a day considering it’s usually a daily thing
Just adding my two cents
Prompts are quite often the victim of being silenced by a new discussion which leads to people backtracking the convo.
This is also working on the assumption the limit doesn’t increase in *3 years*
Ive done something with my life
If im doing prompts in 3 years
Thats 3 years
1000 days
I can see the implementation in my mind quite clearly
I was thinking a thread for each prompt post
Channel bloat can be a real problem
I think we can easily do daily
Thats a compromise which we probably don’t need to make

if only it were actually easy to leave ones country xd
bingo?
sounds complicated lank im just gonna call it an idiot tax and blame poor people for having false hope
Because they are arguing that kim jong is the god king he thinks he is
But tankies make said conversation almost impossible to have on good faith
That has nuance to it
See the really worst part
But i don’t deepthroat putin as a response
Don’t get me wrong the US sucks fucking hard
Also tankies are pro russia in the current war because they tend to be pro any country ever if it’s against the US
But china is state capitalist and stanning it as comminism is just factually incorrect
Tankies like to pretend they are lefties at least
If we using that…. Not really cause they bootlick authoritarian regimes
Well
A “leftist” who stans modern day china and the soviet union
Tankie moment <:sadcowboy:510303995215085569>
One can easily argue the ussr would be better than the current system and *also* understand the ussr has flaws too
Them and *nazbols*
More just conspiracy theories on the left but tankies are kinda the big market for that
I recently watched a really nice long video about this kinda group of people
<:americaburns:345277403557527566>
Its also somewhat understandable if you are fully aware the US have done absolutely horrid things. It makes it easier to believe conspiracy theories
I don’t feel I am being a doomer in saying that the trends point downhill
There comes a point where things become so disastrous in a country that things utterly collapse. And im scared to find out *where* exactly that line will be for Britain because as much as i try and remain ignorant about uk news, these kinda stories always pop up and they sound worser with each month
*On Monday, a huge survey of nursing staff showed eight out of 10 reporting that their last shift had had insufficient nurses to look after patients safely and effectively. In other words, staffing levels in today’s NHS are so low as to put patients in danger. At the weekend, sick and injured people at major hospitals in Devon were waiting more than 15 hours to be seen in A&E.*
Its an opinion peace but theres one thing id like to bring the attention to
https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jun/10/britain-political-housing-health
Or as id like to say, americanising our healthcare system
It’ll start being more normal when our government really goes mega hard on privatisation of whatever infrastructure they haven’t hacked to bits
I don’t personally think this proposal is close to being whats perfect or even approaching what id personally think would be a full solution thats effective but my point is that after being barraged with dogshit takes of “just ban the ar15” thrown at me, i like to see at least something resembling actually tackling the issue being done
Its so much easier to tackle… why people shoot people up to this extent
But just like saying ban the ar15, it misses the point
Its nice to have an endgoal of disarm all of america
Which is the issue i have when the main issue is the spree of mass shooters
Sure, but that won’t change the logistics of it all
No i dont
Like perhaps a good example, cops “missing” weapon possessions due to similar politics or nepotism or just personally finding it unjust
Not even to mention the countless cases of human bias and prejudice that would go into that colossal undertaking
It does though? I cant even pretend to entertain it a possible solution just purely on the number of firearms in the us
It also misses the point
I find it unfeasible on a purely logistical perspective
To elaborate, i was trying to talk about the people in the replies who felt their endgoal was banning guns. I felt it was clear enough that this shouldn’t be the endgoal but the ban on dv people holding guns is much more significant than one would think id say
The brain rot of the liberals in the replies saying “this aint enough”. Some people genuinely think banning a gun which is circulated in the high millions is a more effective solution than stopping the key mass shooter demographic from being armed at all
I think the utopian endgoal is no guns but I don’t find that particularly helpful to think about when thinking of what to do now
If you waved a magic wand and disarmed everyone, there wouldn’t be school shootings to this degree
Theres lots of what id call fairly decent arguments for not removing guns but like

You have to accept guns play a part in this
Knives less so
Guns are efficient tools at murder
I don’t find veganism arguments holding up without some anti-capitalism spice
Id be vegan if i had the economic means for it, but one extra person wont make a significant difference as compared to factory farming and the extreme inbalance of food distribution in the workd
Love and attraction to others is like that quote about plans. You have one till it punches you in the face
I personally dont put much stock in labels. I find it a really poor way to actually explain complicated things such as gender and sexuality
I studied American politics for my second year of my A levels course
I know
Keeping certain people in power
Its doing its job
And they have numbers
Push the people enough the people will push back
Something like that
Well yeah

Lot of people see voting as the end of politics
There will always be states that are blue enough that banning abortions is political suicide
That aint the point tho
I just wana say in response to this

Discord works with cops try not to break TOS in a public anime server
Its why states rights was a dog whistle for continuing segregation during the… I forget which decade it started but i wana say 60s
Time has proven if you dont enforce the states to do things, they will continue to do horrible shit
Pro life till you come out the womb
https://twitter.com/amylunews/status/1540342811291164675
Reminder that discord works with cops, don’t tempt the discord tos with inflammatory comments calling for certain… violent choices
Theres a big demand for people who have dogshit world views to be represented legally, and higher education tends to make people less likely to hold dogshit views
Im very certain id be thrown into grippy sock prison and lobotomised & sterilised and im not fully sure for which reason
Id argue abolishing them without putting a replacement to actually treat and care for those who are troubled like that is bad sure, but asylums have historically been a fucked thing to put it one way
I dont see how ending asylums ruined america?
That’s certainly one element of it. If you remember the kavanaugh hearings, thomas was the prelude to that

My goddam asian mum warned me about Romani
And its extremely severe
Because oh its all true
But romani is treated as acceptable racism
We everywhere <:LMFAO:473670835748601858>
In the uk, statistically white working types will have to work with muslims which helps
Muslim racism is something i feel is at least to some extent viewed as extremist shit enough that we can recognise it for what it is
So they are supposed to shut up and starve?
The state not allowing them to work or rent/buy housinf
Baffling how people don’t understand the endpoint of all the dogshit things we do to the romani is putting another triangle on them
The argument didnt wnd when i told them that the romani had their own triangle
I know stories of Americans being absolutely bewildered by traveller racism because to them they couldn’t tell the difference
I remember having a circular argument with a fuckwit who wanted these people to “integrate”

But absolutely hated “those g slurs” being near him cause oh well they are all thieves and such
They dont trust Western European society and they have been proven right again and again
I don’t blame the oppressed for generations upon generations of oppression acting out sometimes
Cy dont
No
Support psuedo extermination of these people
With the same fucking breath
I have seen people understand the structure of racism in Muslim cultures and believe that it’s individuals and not them as a whole
The worst of european racism isn’t muslim

Its Romani/travellers imo

Isnt that the point of a lot of these legal battles? To appeal to the SC and make a dogshit ruling

If you overload the public with all these things, it tends to be the case the mass can only hold onto one thing at a time
Damn, only minecraft youtube I actually cared about <:AU_oof:746032396373065809>
A lot of pro-life people think that there will be exemptions that will be judged. If you told pro lifers that overturning roe v wade would hit arthritis medication they would simultaneously hold the belief that these exemptions to a blanket ban would exist, as well as arguing it would be for the greater good as long as it “saves lives”

The word systemic doesn’t exist in the dictionary in that regard
to get back on track with uk politics
all the gods are cunts to some extent
depends on your source material
dont fuck with me im a nerd
Hades is the god of death
i dont think i will have words for how much blood is in the hands of Rishi and Sajid
one is a micrometer higher
i mean to say of the bottom of the barrel i am scraping
i dont mean to say one is better than the other
well entertaining and hopeful at times
but at least it was
oh uk politics was always *depressing*
and us politics to be a depressing state of affairs
i found uk politics to be a trainwreck that kept on crashing constantly
see as someone who studied uk and us politics at the same time
that implies there was loyalty to begin with
i wouldnt call it backstabbing
so easily spinned to be on boris
all of the hate about everything thats going on
and honestly
die hard tories are sick of it
boris isnt winning the next leadership challenge
as much as id rather they did hold out, the government would actually collapse faster if they did
if that happens, i doubt they can hold the party together without throwing out a GE
Rishi and Sajid are prime candiates for a leadership challenge
from what i recall

Boris had a latest scandal involving putting someone in a high position in goverment *knowing* that there had been allegations of groping men. The reason its become a scandal is because they repeated the allegations in the position they got

Rishi Sunak and Sajid David are the current architechs of murdering the NHS, the economy and poor people. They have stuck by cuntbag boris because they all thrive on the blood of the working class *allegedly*.

The fact that they've resigned means the writing has been painted in permanent marker for Boris Johnson as Prime Minister
Press the pay button and in 1 hour your payment is declined for being too small
I think the better question is if it is an effective punishment since that is the tale behind him.

He can be optimistic all he wants, id argue the hell is only worsened with ignorance
And make the line go up
To fill Elon Musks bank account
The article (and capitalism as a whole) makes the basis that if people have the threat of hunger looming over them, they will continue to be productive
Something something workers of the world unite
The cunt makes a point about how “well wouldn’t these people be slaves for working for food” 

One of the many things you’ll learn is that if you dont work you die. What a healthy fucking system to live under.
Capitalist brain rot in a nut shell
If we dont hold people with the threat of **death by starvation**, nobody will clean the toilets waaaah
How detached do you have to be from basic empathy that you come to that conclusion
Actually deranged what the fuck?

“Hungry people are more productive”

Fun fact. We can end world hunger with the resources we have right now. They aren’t being distributed evenly. Actually ghoulish to think hunger is good because its good for the fucking **economy**
and biden pre-emptively purged anyone adjacent to bernie

but i know enough about american judges and the system as a whole there to know that giving them the final say is a very bad idea
im not gonna pretend the jury system is perfect
to argue against a system in a country that you dont know, using your own admission
because judges would have snap killed them
without the jury system, a lot of escaped slaves would have gone back to the planation or executed
certainly not to what i posted
please dont talk about italy, because that isnt at all relevant to *this*
and they abuse that shit hard
hell, even with the jury system, judges have a lot of power in judicial cases
i dont trust them to judge against criminal cases
you know its conservative judges whove pushed hard for anti abortion and ripping up lgbtq+ rights
you know how many racist and sexist judges exist in the south?
yeah i wouldnt rather have that
considering what the alternative would be
and... this is the fault of the jury system?
so this will cause a mistrial
and nobody noticed till now
its cause some guy who conveniently had a last name as someone who was supposed to be there just sat on the jurers thingy
didnt even lemmie finish why this shits comming back
wha?
one of the jurors wasnt supposed to be there
you fuckers are sick of depp vs herd dominating the news space, opening the doors for some spicy sexism and shitty takes?

You can notice the contradiction when their silence about lgbtq+ voices being silenced is deafening
Hes just a transphobe
“Centrist” tim pool
I definitely see it as that at least
It does feel a bit of a false comparison. The video suggests that the large quantity of the industry encourages a culture of pedo crap. I dont think game of thrones can be called upon to be accused of encouraging a culture of anything but fantasy tbh
From my experience, Japan is on a significantly larger scale
Depicting actual children at least
Or just actual children, like the examples used in the video
Or is involved in anime circles
Theres not exactly a kind way to describe lolicon to someone who doesn’t watch anime
Literally a blink and you’ll miss it snippet of symphogear in a bit of journalism trying to explain to non anime consuming brain rot people that *people create and consume kids getting assaulted* so ya know
This one is
This one’s not real unfortunately
Omg what qatar is an extremely homophobic country???????
There is a massive contradiction between wanting free speech yet banning anti fascists
The contradictions are either the point or negligible
And pointing them out, while helpful for us, isn’t helpful against those who hold these dogshit views
There exists many contradictions in conservative/fashy/right wing ideology
Helpful for you to know

Whichever party wins, it doesn’t feel like things are gonna get better for trans people

Side note, the right have identified they can trip up keith by asking about trans people because as a centrist cuntbag he doesn’t actually care and so hesitates whenever hes asked about it

The best time to do it was yesterday. The second best time is right now
Had someone i knew in what most yall would call high school I believe who thought that (among a lot of other dumb shit) that trans people in the uk just need to wait for the right time
One thing id throw onto that is the attitude that slow progress is an acceptable pace. It isn’t
We as society haven’t even got down something basic like is stealing bread when you are starving bad
Modern society isn’t prepared for the ethical questions ai presents
People are too unflinchingly not questioning core injustices in the society in which we operate. I don’t exactly find it a sound defence to go well that’s how it is when we are talking about ideas for the future
My original point was that morals be dammed when people are starving but we really just be like “but its not right to steal food because the capitalists will punish the workers” and not question why the workers are getting punished for this

I was gonna say that the lords could do with a bit of pruning of lords cause of the recent pms just stuffing it with their mates
Cause stinky labour is just removing proud British heritage
Overall though British people as a whole are resistant to something like changing the house of lords
Getting rid of the crap peerage system
I think reforming it is a good idea tho
But its also been one of the only thing  coming close to slowing down tory legislation
Generally I dislike it
It’s complicated
Keith moment <:suffering:783574844226142258>
And centrists you are desperately trying to appeal to are more likely to think “nono this new tory leader is better”
You’ve already pissed off leftists by screwing over unions and not supporting strikes (and purging anything left of you)
Its such a wild thing, from the person deeply afraid of looking like corbin having the only radical proposal be something so radical he might as well have said hes gonna behead the monarchy to centrists
If anything, I think people can use hes bipolar or mentally ill to not at all challenge the crap he sprouts
One thing ill say about Kanye

While clearly he’s disturbed in many ways, Bipolar alone doesn’t turn you into a nazi. One could argue he’s just unfiltered.

I saw an article about this person recently. I know this might be a bit controversial but I don’t know if *social media* was the leading factor considering how the parents talked seemed as if they were completely unaware of who their child was or anything like that.

I know that a community like that actually tends to discourage actually ending your life most of the time and that also crushing that means to cope doesn’t fix the problems, you either die from the stress of it or be forced to cope. Obviously i don’t know these parents but they feel like they would be like my parents if i died like that. 

Clearly something triggered her and it was too much, but im not fully convinced that it was her making posts about how she’s depressed hurt her
Its also kinda what ive been saying for a while
The last paragraph or two really hammer it home

Good article on ai art as a whole tbh

Cant imagine why <:suffering:783574844226142258>
Skipped mentioning tiktok
More he thinks hes Tony Stark
Wow I can’t believe all of us collectively botted
He never has
Nope
debt collectors can be quite scary for the lower classes, and part of me do hopes that he gets to feel that same level of fear as someone who has spent most of his life making people scared of the worser off in life
his house, his cars, whatever intellectual properties
he has a lot of assets which will probably be seized in order to pay as much of it off
I don’t know why some people just give us *ammo* to bully them <a:MichaNod:493803314593660958>
So you either just have blinding amounts of optimism or fall into a depression (like our economy)
I think in the uk theres two minds at work. The minds of people, willful or not, who have kept themselves incredibly ignorant of the state of whats going on and just let things play out (or for some get extremely angry about trans people or refugees)

Then theres a whole other side who’s desperately trying to fight back but it feels like an endless struggle
Nobody can stop the Labour party winning next election, and the name of that nobody is Kier Starmer
There was a really funny joke from a comedy series i was watching
We having our winter of discontent 2 and it feels like the entire country is in a lull as goes even further beyond a shithole
I think the uk runs on Copium
Bengal famine comes to mind
I remember in my history seminar for uni our seminar tutor having to just have a brief aside to just especially let us all know Churchill was extremely racist *for his time*
Labour is supposedly our left wing opposition
https://twitter.com/SaulStaniforth/status/1604393935958429699
Oh btw since im here, the uk is a shithole
Empires <:twisted:753068684150308864>
You drop a penny in the history of time and the uk wouldve tried to invade the ussr
Holidays mainly refer to the time tho? Like its a Christmas holiday cause a lot of shits on holiday around this time December (like school)
Ill continue to do so as the army guns me down cause im protesting with NHS workers
I forever will slightly tease my leftist mate who got a bit swindled by Keiths rhetoric
I hope its clear btw, a lot of the opposition the uk had towards germany wasnt because they were nazis, more just they were conquering others and that was interference with what the uk would like to do, which is to keep that empire goin
I mean thats less a plan and more the end goal of fascism as a whole. Mass extermination while constantly changing the goal posts
Or even potentially a joint strike action against the ussr even
Basically right up until like Poland, we know Hitlers mindset was that the UK would hopefully stay out because of ideological reasons
Should be a way to get past paywall

She will be the minister for Domestic violence and safeguarding
So if Labour wins
It’s indicative of what the opposition would be like and do, if elected
The opposition, in this case Labour, have shadow ministers that run counter to whatever the main party does
Okay its not *official* but its official

Nobody can stop Labour from winning the next election, and that nobody is named Keir Starmer
Shelter is a basic necessity after all
Like homelessness
Squatting is one of those things where i feel like the issue is a much larger societal issue at play that would solve it
Cancel culture is when “what I don’t know why im being cancelled i only made the one string of extremely racist and transphobic comments free speech!” And they continue to have careers after that
Too late I’ve reported you to the cancel police
I mean it’s simple. If someone takes the time to understand what republicans are doing, and still vote for them than it speaks for what they are willing to vote for, their personal agreements about it or not no?
Even if you aren’t a political race like mine for example, its gonna be what you earn and what laws you follow and how your fellow human is being treated
Politics is everything in our modern lives is the problem
The enemy of the republican party
Theres a lot to learn and talk about
Like a lot of people make the choice to just tune out and not listen or something to that tune and thats a shame
Politics sucks as a convo but it’s important to have
And a vote for republican is an endorsement of the policies they fight for, even if its not something you necessarily believe in. Like a republican voters gotta contend with the fact that its a party which is stripping away abortion rights
If hes not, then the community sends the message its fine with people like that
Ban him or mute him or whatever really
The best thing you can do is deplatform this dweeb if you have the power

Buut
Nothing to share since the issue is that you cant win this argument
But with suburbs, closest place is like a half hour drive or something and thats mind boggling
It would take me a quick trainride to take me into two different towns where i live, plus where i am theres a big forest and a few different corner shops
It feels bizarre knowing that for a good chunk of people in america, they dont have easy access to, a loooot of places without a car
Combined with how living spaces are designed
Ive found america to be quite deeply scared of public transport in a lot of situations

If he ignores it
Drop evidence
I mean the best way is this
While you are uniquely privileged to be able to try and engage with him, doing so in a public space attracts an audience who may swing his way

Hey wales is a lot closer to me than Scotland is :)
https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-politics-64228256
That stuff plus more
If you are familiar with something like matt covilles strongholds and followers
Massive outrage, followed by a nothing apology by WotC filled with outright fabrications
All because you used bits and pieces of whats sort of the open source of dnd
It was a new form of the ogl, which would not only remove a lot of the previous protections, but retroactively remove the protections from previous works
Recently, a leaked document which people were being asked to sign was revealed
It allows people to produce homebrew content for 5e without having to officially pay royalties and likes, but they cant use specific phrases and all sorts of generous stuff to encourage homebrew stuff
So theres this thing called the OGL
Maybe races dont need to determine stats :)
I heard a looot more voices calling this a step forward and something good and interesting rather than this take so 🤷🏽‍♀️

Keith starmer Labour in one sentence
**and the year has only started**
https://twitter.com/jrc1921/status/1614559429328011264
Heres a small thread of highlights
Starmer saying that 16s can’t decide their own gender is kinda the epitome of uk politics atm really
https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-64279654
One could argue that the goal is more planting the seed in Scottish people that they will threaten the union to stop Scotland doing even what they are allowed to do. Less about trans rights which is funny
I mean Scotlands plan has been if England blocks this, we have justification to try leaving
Read the comments to instantly die
We do be triggering a constitutional crisis to own trans people
Left presenting but ultimately quite right wing/centrist
For you americans i think the equivalent is Bill Clinton?
Not to mention, shes a self admitted blairite
Plus, shes rich enough that she has as much influence in parliament as any other rich person might
She gave the movement a toooon of fire to stay substanted
Jkr is a big terf figure especially in the uk
<:LMFAO:473670835748601858>
Shallow nothingness
And only because it will win votes, not because they have an opinion
Nothings more the epitome of fence sitting than going from a firm stance to “eeehhhh we want to just end *all* conflicts”
Thats just funny
https://www.jewishnews.co.uk/labour-could-drop-palestine-recognition-commitment-from-general-election-manifesto/
Corbyns not a labour mp anymore
Corbyn himself even
And the unions
He purged a lot of corbyns wing
And sunak isnt liz truss so thats alright!
Everyone sees through what keith is and he is so utterly uninspiring that biden would look like a superstar in comparison
Its not like America where trump is irrecoverably a cunt and most “sane people” can agree on that
The base keith is aiming for doesn’t exist
The only people voting are the people who are being held at gunpoint to do so
“Nothing can stop Labour from winning next election, and the name of that nothing is Kier Starmer”
It’s called transphobia <:twisted:753068684150308864>
https://twitter.com/LeftieStats/status/1615424214810431506?s=20
Thats the cold hard fact of it
Blocking access kills us
Im talking about facts about how trans healthcare works
Waiting lists and restrictions likr “only people aged 16” can change their gender doesn’t help confused teens. It makes it harder for teens to get help in the first place
If I hadn’t gone private to get hrt, i would not be here right now. My gender identity was figured out by the first 6 months on thst waiting list
The waiting list was an example of a failing of trans care because of this attitude of “wait to be sure”
Okay then, maybe next time it would be worth engaging with whats being said by some trans people here :)
Restrictions to who can apply for these services about their gender will significantly hurt more trans people than “confused teens” following a “a trend”
Sorry i dont trust your doctors on the news, ive heard this rhetoric before and its not one with great intentions, if they mean to or not
Helping confused teens figure out their gender, or helping confused teens realise its actually a fad?
The uk have also had their fair share of doctors talk about how theres a trans epidemic and so many people have regretted it!

They drown out the actual doctors who actually give a shit
As it turns out, if you combine a growing understanding and knowledge of these things with a higher chance of societal acceptance, you get more visible trans people
It also doesn’t mean you completely fuck over trans people because some teens see it trendy
And the first appointment is asking questions
In the uk where this is being talked about, the wait list is so long that I only just got my first appointment after *4 years* of waiting
And the regret rate is abysmally low
😬pretty sure the data shown is that those sorts of “trans trenders” are such a small amount that its not worth talking about
https://twitter.com/pinknews/status/1616085770846044160
Funnily enough there is literally more trans people here talking to you than the single regret case
Thats one way to call it I suppose
Dejavu
So they got one case of regret snd go “we need to make it harder for people to get to us to get care, because of all those trending teens!” Thats what i have understood you to have said since thats what you replied to initially
Especially if you have an agenda about the spooky trans people transing peoples genders
And then like 5000 interviews with trans people saying it was very good
One interview about the lady who regretted it
If you wanted a comparison for that tv
That voice tends to be amplified over the thousands of voices who transitioned and are perfectly happy with it
You physically cant have the surgery iirc until that point anyway
You can’t have surgery until like 18 or later iirc
It’s putting a pause on puberty, which is usually accompanied with talking therapies to figure things out
Anything in particular thats started to make you feel like that?
Enough of the populous still believe capitalism is the solution over molotovs
Don’t think this country is prepared for our public health system to be fucked beyond relief tbh 😬
Every time I think of looking at British politics and news, I see shit like tory chairman sacked cause it was made public information he weren’t payin his taxes, and that thousands of cops were discovered to be under investigation for sexual misconduct, that so many industries are going on strike its almost general strike levels and the nhs is at a cataclysmically bad state due to tory cuts

All ill see in the uk mainstream media outlets is the mugshots of 5 American cops and Ukraine
Just because of a grievance with a story trope
I personally wouldn’t want to contribute to algorithms run off the work of humans to replace them

Tory’s gonna tory
Cough cough covid
Ive seen far too many neolibs dunk on corbyns bad ukraine takes. And while I certainly agree they are bad takes i also think that corbyn would also… consult others before making a decision on stuff?

I find its less about faith in humanity and more the understanding that the cockroaches at the top have their own self preservation at the top of priorities
It’s inherently influenced by the world and what shapes it
Actually one of the first things i learned at university studying this *was* that art is political.
Thats a story id love to read, magical girls realising the greatest threat to thr world was capitalism all along

All this online discourse and stuff for a triple a game that looks utterly mid with game breaking bugs and in a world fantasised by a terf
Absolutely fascinated with this article
https://www.thegamer.com/bullying-streamers-hogwarts-legacy-harry-potter-trans/
unless ofc being allies is just for the positives of what that entails rather than... actually being an ally
<:BRUH:763130510796652605>
i imagined something a lot worse
when i was told bullies left her crying
its people who want to desperately to enjoy it they will come up with whatever excuse rather than skip out on paying cash to this shit
slip in a little "alt-left"
if your response is "why are people bullying me for not putting the trolley back wtf"
its the shopping trolley problem

the most ethical thing to do is put the trolley back in the rack. its not illegal to not to do it but its the right thing to do
the usual i suppose
big streamers get very mild bullying and trans people get a fuckton of harassment for hurting their poor dear streamers how could you make them cry they just wana play a game
streamers arent your friends
character being the key word
mid harry potter game
of all the things to die on the hill for
why stan for this game lmao
i just think
doesnt it have absurd anti piracy measures on pc?
why pirate a mid shitty game in a shitty mid setting
there are better things to pirate tho lmao
it also is what shaped what we see of the right wing online these days
oh also women and PoC people
that might be why
gamergate is a boogyman used to harass people who hold marginally left wing views
politics bad (politics is codeword for minorities in videogames)
moved on to other words
it turns out people caught onto that
SJW which is also a nonsense term used to just harass minorities while pretending their views are just too extreme

Especially if you align yourself and support literal nazi’s to further said goal
Extermination is the goal and the means to it is to make trans peoples lives as miserable as possible beforehand, perhaps by using your platform to spread terf shit so trans people spend their life uncomfortable in hiding perhaps?

Postal workers, nurses, ambulance drivers and a few more are also sporadically striking

Somewhat related, but i learned that the controversial take Corbyn had about ukrane was that hes unhappy its had to lead to this and he wished there was something that could’ve been done to stop it was the ghist of what I gathered from looking into it a bit
Bold take: lank has opinions???

Ah
<@456226577798135808> can you announce new link?

You need to let me in?
No
Cypher what u doing now?
I am miku on the bike

Then click “i wana host alone”
On the home screen there should be something on the left called “My Room”

i had power and in that brief period i called a crusade on constantinople

Had to restart the app so i could actually act like an autoscorer
My short lived life as an autoscorer
Ill see if hosting works on my end
So perhaps it will be good Saturday too
Today
My internet was surprisingly good
Indeed
We did 5-10 without you
Err

With that said
I’m dying

LET US BEGIN
oh rip saki

So for catch up session

Thats really good
Cavalry
Food wars?
DxD?
I did both
But the anime was still dope
Fair
World god only knows?
Have you seen
Good
Have you seen Konosuba?
If i may make a suggestion
Yori
How far will a degree in politics take  me?
I want to leave this country
Actually some of them have google fiber
We arent yanks
Hey now
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
Yori brexit means brexit
England is bad
Tripp and Shirabe are Yanks
Yes
Are you not east coast ish?
Wa
Shes an east coast yank
It should be suitable to the current anime watching bc memes
<@!127644949884698624>
Tbf tis a poor name
:p
~~it was mega dead before i organised the k-on watch~~
Thats what this channel is for
Probably finish s1 and then sleep
We finished ep 10, and today at 11 BST we continue
The k-on watch
React to this with some maria if ur hype/actually gonna be there
K-on today
Everyone hype?
Thats whats left
11-12-13-14
I don’t remember
Last 6 iirc

Ooooooooooh
?
I would be down doing karaoke
I should figure out how to set up raid call stuff
That’s certainly a way to do an announcement
Well
<@!127644949884698624> can you announce that this Saturdays k-on watch will start at s2 and people are expected to catch themselves up?
Oh well
Shit ive realised that we dont get ballpoint pen together
We start s2 next week
Everyone finish s1 of K-on
I set homework
So instead of the rewatch
Right
I was gonna do an hour reminder
Yeah
Also heres ur pic
So unless someone else is able to host
And my pc isnt turning on
So... my power just came back
Im wiggling gay catnip at azunyan
Or to put it in another way
The least i can do is feed you the gay
I understand
They also tamed her with food and other cat stuff. Like wiggling catnip while the other two mega petted them
Yui *sorta* kidnaps Azunyan, gives her a nickname and hugs her a fuckton
Well
Thats fair
But cocoa is the best siscon

Azunyan
Cough cough
And music :p
You in?
Well k-on in 2 hours
We plan on leaving when the contract expires
Cursed british internet
Brah i cant even get on firefox let alone rabb.it

16kbps a second
i havent brought it yet out of laziness
its worth tho
thats fair mate
lul
if i go to sleep at 1am

im practicing my singing
ill begin room prep in like 15 minutes
who said scotlands building the wall 🇬🇧
and make the irish pay for it
rebuild hadrians wall
bc scotland has no internet
and yet yori is more or less blind
Because we all know ep one is where it turns into fortnite anyway
About what happens in particular episoded
Like even hints
In anycase id like that to remain so
The madoka watch is happening bc someone has gone completely unspoiled
No
Well are you planning to join us for the impromptu madoka watch?
This be an organising chat lul
<#377148557796442134>
Oh
I’m even more lost
thats the bad news
it was a little bit annoying typing my email in
fuckin yanks WHY IS YOUR @ AT 2
the keyboard is also american
bad news
turns out whatever rabb.it is on, probably heavy drugs, it means that the browser is american
we dont have to use kissanime anymore
good news
so i found some good news and bad news
right well ima sit in vc

yes...
btw thats PM you nerds
Also american fast food = McDonald’s
Nah i may have pissed the presiding teacher
Its lunch and i want american fast food
But enough about that
Also i may or may not be getting kicked out my school newspaper
For me
School ends at 3
<@&448228101089132544> 7:30 BST we finish off Madoka
7:30
And we start at... hmm
I’m still at school
Soon
We gon do Madoka tomorrow
Why?

Lul
If you get the mobile app...
I still haven’t mentally accepted you are staff for some reason
<@!127644949884698624> https://lets.rabb.it/0OUxgTPD6M announce that or whatever
I have to install chrome...
Tomorrow is k-on
<@&448228101089132544> we doing anything today/ want to do something today?
TnM?
would thou like to do some k-on to finish the night?
moshi moshi, saki?
<@!127644949884698624>
https://lets.rabb.it/nLXsmxEEbN
everything should be daijobu no
ok new link
https://lets.rabb.it/Axxm25rEbN
<@!102691114762371072> halp
never mind im gonna leave at 8, so my plan is set the room up and then you fuckers can press play :p
oh good ill pop to the shops then
whenever yori kicks up and says he has food holla so i can start then
Naturally, your current state is lewd pirates
<@&448228101089132544> i may have jumped the gun when I decided to cancel Madoka today. It may start later than usual but I think i would be able to squeeze out the last 2 episodes of Madoka today if you’re still interested. Updates on time soon-ish
Tomorrow maybe
Not enough space
Btw anime club pres sounds like an amazing and also befitting title
Just bc im the anime club pres doesnt mean i have to attend every session
You are more than welcome to use rabb.it yourself
But
For reasons more suited to <#336297840529899522>
So no Madoka today
TitS?
watch k-on today?
want to
<@!102691114762371072> will you be here for saturdays k-on watch?
nani

b a k a
<@!102691114762371072> are you not a part of the animeclub role?
<@&448228101089132544> https://lets.rabb.it/E6PUy7yX9M
ok well ill open the room for now but we start when u come
good
if he aint here we aint doing madoka bois
<@256945399338631168> you here?
i dont know whats a spoiler and whats not
are we doing spoilers here now?
staff party hype
need one of gen hugging chris
headpat
boi
oh
i watched it illegall
it helps that you yanks have madoka on Crunchyroll AND Netflix
and i find out if i want to pursue other stuff
i mean for me i cried like a lot during my madoka watch
into this world
we could conclude that Madoka is an alright introduction
you know what sorta vibes im getting from this convo
i believe we were doing something else
i have not seen Yuyuyu
would madoka work better given 25 episodes?
considering out of the many many time loops which homura went through, many of the same things happened
Madoka is a testament to how fate will keep playing its card until it wins
i knew there was pain
in a way
same with me
lul
in <#377148557796442134>
you can talk about it
we have not seen the third movie yet
keep spoilers limited to the main season
that is alices fault not my own
daijobu
DDLC?
just memes?
what is with the May contain existential horror part?
Saki momentarily became an autoscorer
thumbsup
ill change it when we have a set date for watching movie 3
put N/A because its a little bit random on when we watch it
how does the new desc addition look
ect madoka :p
it'll let me update this desc a bit more freely as well, i can add times and any new shit we end up watching on a whim
i should kick myself from this chat already
shouldve pmed alice that
an example i am thinking of is no using the name of Yui's guitar until it comes up in the show
my def is dont talk about jack in future episodes at all
i would say ability to manage this places chat stuff in terms of spoilers, but im not sure if i would do it by your definition of spoilers or my own
ah i think i follow you now
i mean in <#336300750248476693>
should i be able to make announcements to put up rabbit links?
go do that
would it be fair to make me anime club president, that is until i am murdered by a brutal coup
:/
oh wow
just make me anime club president, and lemmie edit the desc of this channel
no matter the show
thats the level of spoilers i avoid
and it seemed nobody did
i was hoping nobody would spoil azusa
for example
because i love the thrill of going into stuff blind
i take a hard stance on all spoilers
ok well personally
im meaning the currently watching part
also technically we are watching K-On!! now
i would personally put it in the channel description
11 BST as usual
and will you be there tomorrow
Saki how much k-on have you watched
moving the convo slightly more on topic of this channel
<@&448228101089132544> opening the room early, but we will still start k-on in 20 minutes https://lets.rabb.it/3m59vMnafN
no as in i am in no way mentally prepared for existing but the show shall go on
yes and no
<@&448228101089132544> ETA 40 Minutes for K-On!!
Thats when i finished gx
Wait sorry
I started when ep 2 just aired
17th July will be my year anniversary of watching Gear
2 cour being 25 ep?
well i know whats after k-on now :p
i would play through it even if you aint seen the show
the beatmap for LosLosLos is pretty damm good
yes
have you watched Tanya?
i have like a fuckton of songs
i mean
that is me right now
:p
want to play OSU?
also i like the whole they got an actual deaf girl to do the deaf girls voice
and they deserve to be looked at
a silent voice has stunning visuals
muy bueno
on netflix
english dub
rewatch it
rabbit is yankie
so i wont be able to do that
a silent voice is only available in UK netflix iirc
oh shit i just realised something
most elaborate VPN lul
im tempted to use rabb.it to watch stuff i wouldn't be able to
ill leave the may contain but keep it relevant to the main series we are watching
what is the mugi one
bah
halp
geh
beh
I want to see them bois actually work on the music
If you want to organise rebellion <@256945399338631168> be my guest
I’m taking a small haitus while i clear my mind up
Not sure
.ru doesnt
Some kissanime sites work
Is GuP an idol anime
Pretty derby has idol elements
Love live is alright
A serious answer
Symphogear
We only watched 2 episodes on the account of me feeling physically and mentally weak. Also i am considering re evaluating the time for the K-On!! watch so look out for that in the future
https://lets.rabb.it/qcxLjKFbfN
we are starting now, here is a freshlink just because rabb.it can be weird sometimes
we listening to the season one character songs
*the suggestion box is completely empty other than my entry*
Geh, yanks
I made a clarification just now, for future reference :p
<@174440042289168384> theres like 2 ongoing shows for the anime club why you put down like 5-6
and now i wait

<@&448228101089132544> I have created a spreadsheet which will allow you to enter what times you are free as well as suggest animes to watch in the future. Click on the link and put your times in. https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1sjtR00KutKF-7BBo8unIU_DbUnvGrBs7Nf89cb6vPm8/edit?usp=sharing
thats HOW FUCKIN SLOW MY INTERNET IS JEEZUS CHRIST
im still in that mo btw
im chuffed
theres quite a lot more active people here now
longer than usual moment my internet seems to be having an aneurism
give me a moment
ive just had an amazing idea
you know
it thinks im american
if we use rabbit
we should shout out prefered dates first
the rest you crazy foreigners i dunno
so is Yori
i am BST
is rebellion on Netflix?
also regarding when to watch madoka movie three... I shall leave that at the hands of Yori as he is the blind watcher
<@256945399338631168> <@292451539136806913> <@!102691114762371072> <@!388516680742993933> and anyone else in <@&448228101089132544> who is interested in the k-on watch.
It seems that Saturday at 11 isn't a great time since there is low turnout. I will move the k-on watch to a much better time, but i need your inputs on what times are better for you. I would use when2meet but it might be better to shout your times at me to figure out when exactly i should do the k-on watch. (And yes i know saki is hiking somewhere so he wont be able to respond immediately)
although you have reminded me i should do something about the k-on watch
no idea what that is
In a different order
Ive seen a different list of that
Yes and you wonder why i aint started it. Bc its long with many seasons and has a weird watch order depending on who you are
Boi...
Isnt she from the monogatari series?
Unless im remembering wron
Dont know where to start
I havent watched fate for similar reasons
>hasnt seen the anime
Read my name

<@!188714906143424513> the red box is to show the cutoff between people and the suggestion box
i see
how on earth does pripri have 6 movies?
wait
ah
i can see from the top to 35 easilly
weird...
how far are you zoomed in?
put your name where the supporters is
also if you would watch it
below the red line
Ash greninja > shitty charizard
No
~~ignoring the finals for the league~~
Ash in XY is betrer then red
Boi we wont skip a single episode
If we watching Pokemon XY
We ain’t watching all of DBZ or Pokemon
Then no point
Ok yea if ira loony
Is monogatari on the suggestion box then?
***SKIP POKEMON BLACK AND WHITE ANIME***
This has been a PSA from someone who has *seen suffering*
And we see little of that
Her game personally was much better
Iris looks cute, but her personality is a jagged knive
Skipping nothing
I know because i binged watched all of it
There is *nothing* redeeming about it
Black and white is absolute trash in all regards
*trust me*
Skip it
Nor finish it
Dont start it
So is s1 of Sun and Moon
XY is on Netflix
Black and white was pretty dope, especially the whole removing the TM limitation
Oh games
He went straight to Kalos
Ash skipped that place
What are you talking about
Gen 5 doesnt exist
Im getting dejavu to my friend who is adamant that Symphogear is not only absolute trash but they don’t understand how anybody could enjoy it
Some people have strong biases when it comes to pokemon and they are very hard to break out of
Btw that ash greninja beat a mega sceptile in the leauge as well
And fairy
Gardevoir is psychic
The hell you talkin bout
Water vs grass?
Time to go back to P5 bye
Yori this is ash vs the region champ
https://youtu.be/rpqVM4QS5qU
*still salty*
Now however, ash-greninja < hacked charizard
<#371105434771390465>
I hope this place hasn’t accidentally killed <#377148557796442134> for talking about animes and such
Its seperate from both the game and anime
Pokemon does have a manga
And have this place serve as anime discussion?
Saki, would it be better to rename <#377148557796442134> to something like spoiler chat?
Hmm
just waiting on shirabe then
trippy dont work for nothin
duh
are you that unpredictable in terms of time?
dragon why havent you put your times down?
i salute you, comrade trippy
oof
8pm bst still
how does thursday sound then
also check pinned
British summer time
<@256945399338631168> does Wednesday 8pm bst sound good?
i dont mind doing it lets say Wednesday
yes
<@292451539136806913> , <@!388516680742993933> can i get your times in the pinned spreadsheet? i wana see when i should do k-on watch
<@!188714906143424513> boi we arent currently watching JJBA why u put it in the spreadsheet :/
(its as if the time is in the chats description)
same
it was moved
tomorrow
<@&448228101089132544> 
I've had a looksie at the spreadsheet and i have found a much more suitable time to watch K-on. We will resume the K-on watch at Saturday 5PM EST, which is 10PM BST. We will begin from Season 2 episode one, so if you haven't yet seen s1, then do so. If you have watched past s2 ep1.... tough love
:Appropriate K-On! emote:
its thursday
no
yes
super gay
Comic Girls AOTY

ok makes sense now
oh you have put your times
i dunno ur times shirabe
i might as well do this now while i still have the mental energy to do stuff
and saki is patrolling the mojave
as he is part of the hms aint seen k-on
ive rewatched the dancing transformation scene at least 10 times

lyrics of never gonan give you up are more suitable than i thought
there you are
ah
yori where are you
<@&448228101089132544> https://lets.rabb.it/K6pLufwTyN
opening
ooh aggretsuko
<@&448228101089132544> annoying ping reminder that Madoka Rebellion is today in 2h 20 minutes
done

you wish it was
its 9:18PM here
what time is it for you rn alice?
(as if i became anime club pres to do that)
Flip flappers started ok
eh...
s2*
s1 ep 1
saturday k-on
yes
but thats unlikely
and thats more or less it for the series except for a potential concept thing which *theoretically* could be turned into a movie
yes
uncultured swine hasnt seen GuP movie
also saki
we have to do k-on!! first
GuP rewatch will be a while
yes
i might do 2 series at the same time
hmm
after k-on
then im yellow
<@449062815534153748>
<@449062815534153748>
people not attending is fine but i would kinda like to know if you arent attending
if the discussions dont go anywhere im not gonna do anime club stuff anymore
ill let people know this now
/not here
considering there has been radio silence from everyone except you and saki on why you would be late
but is this time we agreed on possible or not
discussion for later not now
yes
well if nobody is here by :10 im calling today off
https://lets.rabb.it/h2c8l4lmCN
well its certainly reassuring that the k-on watch is now and nobody is here....
links gonna be dead for a mo, need to reset the room
well good to know that nobody has joined the room...
<@&448228101089132544> https://lets.rabb.it/icHKmURlCN
Room opening now, starting soon
and put money in the bank the day after that bc banks are closed sunday
just need to get paid tomorrow
*checkmate*
well soon ill get an azunyan
*my mugi is bigger than yours*
Yui is your family <:GarieWink:336657101273169921>
even if im ill or mega depressed, ill hand the job to someone else
it should always be the same time
for the future saki
oof
**go buy food tho**
you have +40 minutes technically
from the start of k-on!! yea
<@&448228101089132544> K-On!! 30 minutes
is the other k-on?
its pinned
i still dont really have a MAL
my memory is bogshite
well september ish time
you know i only started watching anime in september
last year is a long ass time
lul
i wont remember konosuba
then when i look at what to do next
*how bout you put it in the suggestion box*
iirc
bc the crunchyroll ver cuts a scene out
rabb.it using Masterani.me
get on it
btw im using rabb.it for this unless you two have any better ideas
bc its 👌
i feel like we would want to go back to it
rather than the shows chronological order
i shall instead do the watch in order of release
after being informed
mind you dming me the mild spoilers bc i cant remember them rn
there will be newbies
And i shall do the anzio ova in between the series, unless the public demands elsewise
Like i said, ill consider when exactly after tomorrows k-on session
<@&448228101089132544> The K-On!! watch shall take place the time time which is in this channels description tomorrow. Let me know if you won't be able to attend ~~please~~. Also, after that I shall consider whether I should do a GuP watch that runs parallel to the K-On watch in a way. If you would be interested in a GuP watch react with <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720> and ill put that into consideration when i decide when to run it!
Maybe ill do two ongoings at the same time
Cool
Chris did you put your times in the spreadsheet?
Yup
Figure out who’s here for Saturday
I’ll ping anime club later
Well the shall go on
After k-on
Daijobu

Theres other people i have to enquire on whether they are still part of the k-on watch
Didn’t know how much I needed this
I love
First i seen that shinai chris pic
Saved
Normies who cant be in two Symphogear discords
Lol
Other than you and joe?
Chris do you know if anyone in valk is down for a GuP watch?
As in pics of kirika
Looks like ill sort out GuP watch... tomorrow
up to anime club voters
i can also just do gup
i can do GuP ontop of k-on
option 1 is continue with k-on
ll abstain bc whatever course this ship runs in i shall lead it to it
rip
i wont be able to be here this saturday so i hope yall have your shit sorted out when im not around
<@&448228101089132544> so did the k-on watch actually... happen?
Another host person is required then
I believe ad block is used in rabb.it rooms
Masterani.me works well
No
Yes
Ep1
<@&448228101089132544> So i know its like an hour till it starts but can someone else take over hosting? I wont be able to do today for reasons which solely belong in <#336297840529899522> . I'll let you decide between you who will be hosting. I shall be lying down
Ping me 2 hours before we start ima chill and not sleep
Well make yourself anime club role, and perhaps on the off chance you are free you can jump in?
Random hours?
Ah
Check pinned
Yes
<@!175163984197058560> would you be interested in an upcoming GuP watch?
~~and katrushya~~
it does not promote glorious leader me
fun is banned
like fascist strict
just so you know i run a strict spoilers policy
im looking at cytube
Here u jojo nerds
https://twitter.com/YonkouProd/status/1009701351138267137
Needs to be a dess version
I saw a rare sparkle
<@&448228101089132544> Announcement time! We have elected to stop the K-On season 2 watch in order to start something new! And by ways of democracy this new thing shall be Girls und Panzer! My proposed time will be 5PM BST (which is midnight for <@!138488296736030720> , 12PM EDT and 9AM PDT.) Now I recognise that this time will be problematic for multiple people, so I am willing to run an additional watch of the show on the same day for those who are unable to attend. We will start... next week because I am off this saturday :P. If you are unable to come to saturday's session please tell me so i can plan for when i shall do the second session! *Right back to OSU*
I immediately got more karma posting to /r/awwnime than /r/Symphogear
I wish...
<:GarieWink:336657101273169921>
Doesn’t stop me from posting fanart
Why dont *you* post it to the subreddit
Its not fanart
Im on my phone
Some time in the future i gotta update the channel description

thank you for your contribution shirabe
<@&448228101089132544> https://lets.rabb.it/CDMBZgMRaO This is the room to watch Girls und Panzer!
OK im set
if you need someone to blame blame crunchyroll
right minor delays
gah fuckin crunchy roll i shall EAT YOUR CHILDREN
i will have to restart my computer, brb
ywa
we wana use crunchyroll or kissanime/other "illegal" alternative
ok before we start
Hour and ive just left work HYPE
<@&448228101089132544> reminder that GuP watch starts in two hours!
That an anime?
For you and me joe
It would be 5 pm
I need to check
I think we said sat or sunday
Not now lul
<@!138488296736030720> since it’s midnight for you i think how many episodes we watch is dependent on how long you want to stay awake
We watch as many episodes a week as we can until we are all sick of existing
Im hesitant to allow GuP discussion here when we are starting it this weekend
Maho would like to speak to you elsewhere thanks
Bang
>Moe
>tanks
Il do it when I get home
And gotta leave for school in like... 30 mins
<@!81815015224516608> we need the gif of Stug girls, Volley girls and first years
<@&448228101089132544> https://lets.rabb.it/Qlcvn8cumO
what episode are we on?
we will be on time
actually not too bad
Before the movie maybe
In one go
Mighr as well watch all of them
Ok cool
Or is it just “THESE ARE TANKS AAA”
<@!81815015224516608> does Yukari’s tank corner be spoilers for the show? I cant remember
Good too, ive had some idea for what other watches to do simultaneously, ill talk more after GuP happens
Horray i can actually see when watches are from my phone
Possibly like 10 minutes late
Todaya GuP watch will probably happen, but i might be a little late, after work i gotta hit the bank and check out some clothes
i wish i was azunyan
That includes Anzio and Yukari’s tank corner
I think me and joe came to the conclusion we will watch all of the main series then any OVAs
We watched 3 episodes
yeah take care of them first
pats not being here is throwing me off
i just redid the math
is ok
theres... less people than i thought
is joe joining or is he busy?

~~shit gotta finish KLK fast then~~
So i was delayed fucking with em
Scrmz is watching ngnl
What is a sora?
Kissanime?
Ive been suddenly called out for something important, can someone else host for today?
Re:creators had a great recap episode
Did yall watch ep 11-12?
Should be
Tomorrow is Friday
GuP is Saturday
Nothings on tomorrow iirc
Nothing like Symphogears
The OVAs are OVAs
Absolutely amazing
Is amazing
The movie
Theres a movie
eh
what about it?
i am
C O M F
Nico best girl but sure
Inadvertently cancelled due to lack of host apparently
Type kissanime
From there
You can go to goofle
Ima pretend to go sleep again, hope that answered your question <@297542051057238017>
If that doesnt work masterani.me
Kissanime
.ru doesnt work
Whatever comes up on a google search
You have to do Keionbu
For example K-On doesnt work
searches based off the japanese name
The first one that comes up
*whats the servers policy on the T word*
Well done
Its fine platelet chan will help you ~~drink yourself to death because of fuckery~~
Empty the bottle when you cant adequately explain the misunderstanding
Take a shot when a misunderstanding happens
~~the b is uehara~~
Take out the b
Bromance
*they are such good comrades too*
But fate keeps pushing aguri and armano together
Ghost you just do those ship like that for yuri didnt you
Ill be the judge of that as ~~very retired~~ anime club pres
It should be
Btw scrmz im the same with feeling stuff
*oh shit i just remembered the school thought uehara and armano was a thing early on*
Gaymers where the pentagram gets even more fucked
~~if we ever watch stuff together again~~
Interesting new thing
https://getmetastream.com/
Bread wobbles is bulli me
As in i forgo their names for it
I call teachers “miss”...
calm down
I don’t know how to feel about you calling me miss
Sleep is for the weak
Bitch go do it now
By far
We defeated the demon king is the best
Good
You check out Konosuba fanfics?
A
Konosuba?
Me but the crushes turned out to be “i want to be you”
For gear or the unknown one
Na you aint finished it
Keionbu?
Symphogear?
*of animes that made me feel*
Although at that point the list was Pokemon, K-on and Symphogear
I think i was around that same level when i was reaching time spent watching anime that you reached
But yea gamers is great and im trying to get my non weeb friend who loves british cringe comedy to watch it
Joking aside i would rather be called Rakhi
*for now*
Who is ibu
btw just because anzio happens chronologically before kuro fight doesnt mean im the happy with spoilers
then we wait for the heatdeath of the universe for Finale to finish
then most likely the movie
OVAs will be after kuro fight
nyet
just because it seems obvious if it happens later im not the happy
i run the ship extremely tightly
as i have no other power
if you break these laws i will be very cross
so anything beyond the neet team getting hit is off limits
i decree that from now on no spoilers beyond the beginning of Oorai vs kuomorimine
i run a tight spoiler ship
have you seen GuP before?
<@&448228101089132544> How many of you would be interested in restarting the GuP watch? React to this comment if you would be. We would be starting from episode 11 (or whenever Oorai vs Kuromorimine starts)
Need to catch up and finish that tol
Ay p5 was pretty solid tho
Still thinking of when to do GuP but i will also specially announce that after we finish up GuP we will start a Yuru Camp rewatch to keep ourselves comf over the cold December months
http://isekai-quartet.com/ 
Re:creators just became real
Was that deleted?
One of the earliest jokes in the show was executed brilliantly
But keep your eyes on this channel
Multiple sessions because yall are all over the place
I will be organising times then
So like 8-9 people say yay
How i get my play station to play ir
If i torrenr keionbu and put it on a usb stick
Yo real question
K-on is for sure on bluray
Yuru camp is out on bluray no? Or am I mistaken
So just s2 or s2 and movie?
I see
The initial thing was rumours?
LUCKY GIRL

<@&448228101089132544> Its the revival most of you have been waiting for! We will continue the GuP from episode 11 at Saturday, 5PM BST. If you can't make that time, please react with <:ShirabePout:336656831978012712> so I can figure out when to host the second watch. If you can make it for then, give me some <:Germain:421434126856486912> and I will see you then. We will be using Rabbit on the day.

<@&448228101089132544> Tomorrow's GuP Der Film watch will instead take place next week due to some personal issues regarding time and some *i sing at karaoke tomorrow and that has slightly higher priority*. We will resume der film next week and after that for sure i believe we will move on completely from GuP **and to the next exciting thing!**
err.. can i make the announcement now or the discussion still going on?
it ok if i make a quick announcement to animeclub?
Nana wills it
Like kyaa fuckin bark at the moon
Ooh that makes things much simpler in terms of music OOMPH

Lava you seen ep2 s1 of gear :p
In Symphogear tho... hooo

Like when i was watching love live only one song ever stuck to me
Music is good
Most likely
Thats half an hour early!
So an hour delay would be 6
We usually start at 5 our time
We turning into das finale ep2
Looks like another week delay then?
<@&448228101089132544> ^

Kirito js made bland to be self insert-y as possible imo
Rewatch GGO:A
We should
Fuuxk
I lost my shit personally
Ever like Kabedon a taller girl to confess you love another person?
Oh yea *that kabedon*
See LLENN kinda builds a harem if you push it hard
The guy who wrote this knew his shit about guns
*an Anti-tank rifle*
No. Not just a sniper
The light sabre thing and how some girls got a sniper
Its fine here
And in LL slight yuri bait
I would say i didnt get the sense of glorification but over the top exaggeration
I mean like the shows themselves (like for example LL) are quite unrealistic in terms of “every girl wants to be us also there is a stark lack of men and we can become biijg with just us 9” dunno how it can be taken seriously at all
Although I don’t think personally an idol show has to show how fucked up the industry is..
I see
I don’t know what akb is
Err ok...
Like cause im idol trash
I mean i have other reasons for watching it
From what i heard, the characters were doing that and then the manager went ham on the girls for being dicks
Think me needs to watch zombie land saga

But i wasnt the biggest fan of bebop in the first place tbh
I need to watch bebop the movie
God i wish i could find more of the GGO:A LN
My favourite 5/10 anime
calm down
Now now, nagisa was a loner back then
I’ve heard of this yaoi fanfic before
Cute rascal boi
And didnt realise I forgot this place until *days after that*
I actually watched it with my gf
so i wont ping anime club for this but i have realised i have completely forgotten that we were supposed to watch the GuP movie.
Now my question for everyone is shall we still do this or give up and we can move on. Maybe do something else i dunno
Uma musume is an anime advertising a mobile game which isnt out yet no?
That did happen
Oh yea
Gamers! isn’t exactly a harem anime
https://www.reddit.com/r/GIRLSundPANZER/comments/ad4l3g/i_wanna_rewatch_the_series_dub_in_this_format_xd/

<@!98541382393688064> glad to see you too are enjoying mouso
Its on point that I forget his name. Aqua did
The gram sword user
And whats his faxe
Like the person who built the destroyer
Like with Konosuba theres tons of people who were isekai’d and they are all shitty people xD
I remember some isekais touching on this
Did you watch a show called that time i became a neet gamer or something like that
Hmm
You’ve talked bout her before
<:ChiakiGun:416168057988186122>
Wow i wana beat your social anxiety up

to do an animeclub watch of that
im tempted
https://myanimelist.net/anime/24705/Ore_Twintail_ni_Narimasu
Twintails? :p
Let me see if i can rec uou something different
That
Give me a sec

What time is it for you now?
Im hype bout this now
If i get the time i will ping anime club today with some kinda plan
xd
More people dont even know this is for watching shows together
Some people dont even know this used to be called doki doki anime club
Not everyone checks all the channels anyway
But its better to be notified when something is goin down
Nic i do it too :D
*maybe i should get the power to give roles* <:ChitoseSmug:466044614005227542>
Maybe get the anime club role
<3
Heck that sounds trash but my kinda thing xD
I know a way to organise times and stuff for multiple people
Let me get home so i can organise it
Nic if i did a twintails watch would you be interested?
Im really tempted to do a twintails watch now
Seems.... interesting
Do you ever love twintails so much that you can draw power from them
Well nic
What is date a live about?
Symphogear is weaponised music
Twintails is weaponised fetishes
Sorry you wana call it “I wana be the twintails”?
I have a recent pic of the gear... but its a commission of me :s
“I wana be the twintails”
Twintails?
Hmmm
Where on earth were you during th madoka watch?
Oh Haruhi
Haru?
Remains to be seen
So everyone has to bust the good lesbian out of their chains

Ill do the schedule tomorrow xd
We shall talk later
Go sleep
We would be using rabb.it too
Ye
Oof
I mean dont have to be in vc if thats a concern
Get more people hyped up and make plans for it
Also i wouldnt say this Saturday. Probably the next one
At 8 am?
It works out
And anyone in Bangladesh sleeps
While the americans eat dinner and watch twintails
While i eat dinner and watch twintails
You can eat breakfast and watch twintails
Saturday is great
Exactly
I have the courtesy of organising things a week in advance
No <a:sayakamad:528661574144229388>
~~and the americans can take 3pm or suck it~~
I would love to do 7am ish for me but thats only possible during holidays for me :s
Dont need to be functional we watching twintails
We might have something
If like 8 or 9 is ok with you
But yea
Saki isnt a bot <a:sayakamad:528661574144229388>
Kiri bot isnt here
Nyet
Is morning good for you to watch stuff :3
Hold on
Hmm
Have a good sleep
;-;
:s
It didnt sound memey
So a puppet of homura
No memories of what led her to their decision
This madoka had no memories
Not really
That madoka didnt realise they wished their liberty and life away in order to sage so many lives
The thing is homuras conversation with madoka wasnt with a complete madoka
But it doesn’t make them correct
You dont go through years of a time loop without losing some parts of your sanity
Homuras actions are understandable
All homura did was throw the pieces in the air
Look madokas universe was a smashed vase
She did sorta fuck up the universe
It is an opinion though
Rip
The music and dances <:MikuDrool:432328579318153236>
I really like the magical quartet sequence
Otherwise known as vore the universe
This is a palace
Wait shit this is *my* palace?!
**YOU ARE ALL MY PALACE NOW**
I always mentally divide up the film into three separate discoveries or revelations
This is a place where Madoka spoilers are allowed because we’ve watched the film :3
Probably when you were in camp <:BikkiNervous:514954426088423424>
wait....
good thing im only paying monthy
<a:eyesshaking:563824776766816262>
And to a degree restaurant to another world
Also re:creators
Magical trans
<@!302063351767498752> another two more is magical trans and catulus syndrome
The first two I already said tho <:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
My perfect girlfriend is good
Tonikaku kawaii is great. Maid-san in my house is also great
I binge read far far too many isekai mangas
Its an auto biography of a japanese girl going to taiwan to get grs
I discovered this really recently
https://mangarock.com/manga/mrs-serie-100431783
<@!302063351767498752> if you haven’t already you should really read the manga i just linked
https://mangarock.com/manga/mrs-serie-100299848 new chapter hype
<@!302063351767498752> add “yurikon” to the list of mangas you should read
The reason why i saw it be described as an incels wet dream is everything leading up to it. A false rape accusation which ruins a mans life ending with the girl being torturrd severely and “getting what she deserved”
It is a piece of media which we consume
Heres the thing though yori. The show doesn’t exist in the vaccum of the world.
Oh god was that the most yikes thing ive ever read
Out of curiosity i checked the /r/anime thread
Like pretty detailed electric torture?
Torturing the princess?
And I thought that scene was bad enough in the manga when i read it
A good description i heard of the more recent episode involving the evil princess girl was “an incels wetdream”
Not even mentioning Raphtalia, the opposite of the 500 year old loli trope but with the added slavery crest because what actually *is* free will anyway
And also the fact that it doesn’t exist in a vaccum and so a plotline which involves a false rape accusation empowers fucking idiots to start trusting rape accusations less. *cough cough vic cough cough*
My biggest gripe with shield hero *and also why i dropped it hard* is that the show really loves to portray him as... a hero.
When in reality he is just the lesser of two evils imo
*did somebody say shield hero?!*
The reason why the princess is so conniving and manipulative is because every character is written to have had their iq divided by 3.
Like fuck me in the manga its much worse because characters start *regressing*
And please try not to put words in my mouth. There is a proper way to do something like this. Fuck we can look at Goblin Slayer to see another prime example of how you *dont* jam in rape into your anime
Hand grenades
Listem
YES
And tetsu remains the brother i wish i had
Mogumo is my spirit animal
Best chapter imo
https://mangarock.com/manga/mrs-serie-100299848
This is a spoiler zone...
Last i recall
I mean
They give a small mention with the heroes going “bruh you did *slavery*” but the scene is focused on “they are TAKING the RACOON”
I knew i would hate this show when they portrayed raphtalia being taken away from protag as a pure “those BASTARDS” sort of thing
The other heroes agree not because it makes sense but because narratively everyone needs to be against the protag for the story to flow
She was also written to basically hate the protag on the principle of “well hes the protag fuck his life”
She was written to be like that
Yeah but he still gave into the “lets just do an absurdly petty and horrible thing as vengeance” and also just to prove she deserves it im gonna write it so she has zero redeemable qualities
You could be the child in the body of an adult.
Or better yet the actual loli
Could be worse
It just reeked so hard of an incel power fantasy it pushed me back hard :s
The manga is just ahead of the anime
<@202444817043685386> i watched the anime too
Please picture this:
A woman in power who is doing everything she can to utterly make the protags life a living hell because of (oh wait she doesn’t really have a reason does she other than assholery) and causes this guy to be vilified by everyone in society leading him to delve into slavery in order to actually achieve a companion which ends up naturally falling in love with him despite him only seeing her as a child.

And as a beautiful revenge story id actually expect from reddit, this princess finally gets what she deserved by being *branded as a slave and having her name changed to bitch*
As someone whos had the displeasure to read the manga
https://twitter.com/shieldheroanime/status/1168256434926014465
Shield hero, or as ive now started to refer to it, Re:incel
I was about to mention that
They just dont get him
So those dammed heroes dont wana work with him
The author still wants the protag to be the underdog
Despite being on top
For dumb reasons
Other than to cause tension
So why do they hate him for petty reasons
Everything she said was proven to be a lie
Look
Actually one of the biggest yikes in media ive ever seen
Its the dumbest shit
Dont use that name
Please
Then again not like they ever bring up “hey you are lugging around what is basically a child harem with slavery magic wtf dude”
I mean on a legal sense yes
I know
The *big sigh* false rape allegation is resolved. Same with the crimes he committed
The first arc resolves all that
They still have zero reason to hate protag other than “wow he grinded fUCK him shield bad”
Yeah cause they were written to still hate him because that drives tension. Cause the main antagonising force was given what americans would call a constitutional violation
They still hate his fuckin ass
Pffff
<@!99695384296701952> whats the ruling on spoilers here?
wait really?
anyway shield hero more like re:incel xd
oh i only saw your bit derp
<@!237964037898502144> its worse. it got s2 AND s3
Its kinda hard to describe but its really good
So the plot is haru was dragged along with the typical harem isekai protag into another world
Like the nice guy hero is a shit head cause hes a “nice guy” kinda person
Its very dismantling of isekai tropes
I found the first chapter and it was very good
Haru is a sex worker in another world or something like that
There’s something which ive been is extremely good and i need to find a place to read
Speaking of ln isekai
Im hype now
The best one
OH YEAH WE GETTING BAKA VILLAINESS
That is super generic
And apparently its also crap anime ver too
Manga wise cheat was the worst
I have
It was cg no?
If they mess it up ill be super sad with life
Im waiting on re:sword
Theres arifu, the retry and the cheat magician
Which of the 3 isekais are the worst this season
They are alright
Isekai gold
Arent we getting dumb villainess too?
I fell in love with the show even more when i was told “LLENN is off her rocks thats why she hallucinated her gun talking to her”
P CHAAAN
Wait
I had to check episode discussions just to see what i missed
You need to rely on the ln. A lot of stuff is without context without it imo. Reddit is a blessing for that front
For the anime
See
In time for the horrible animation episodes xD
I also accidentally dropped overlord
I will never return to that crap
I dropped re zero
Fuckin WEAK
Tf?
Who hadnt seen tanya?
The world war junkie
Really l?!
Like for example by proving she is knowledgeable about the world she thinks shes showing shes a loyal soldier but the other person thinks **holy fuck this is a monster**
Tanya is always filled with the irony that Tanya thinks she knows what shes doing but her actions have the opposite effect
Shield has quite little substance. I honestly cant see how those characters would blend too well with characters from konosuba and re:zero. Like subaru is still chipper despite his life going through a wood chipper. Tanya and ains are dark humour and konosuba is the star. Shield hero is just edgy for the sake of edginess
She’s useful
When it comes to her goddess abilities
Ay aqua can holy curse break all the fucking SLAVE BRANDS
🤢 shield hero characters
Ferris <:dabqua:412357887122472961>
But i say its an incel fantasy because of the narrative it was portraying of a big scary evil woman (who at that point was being evil to nao for no reason other than to be an evil person) and her getting her comeuppance
Its... long and complicated
Hoo boy thats a discussion i dont have the time for
It was incel fantasy tbh. I skimmed those chapters
At that point
Ram I think
IQ got me somewhat interested with the red haired one
I never.. really got hooked by any of the girls
DoNt tUrN iNtO a mUrDerEr
But when is the anime
Ofc it will
You read manga
I mean
Yes
When is baka otome
Literally a world of magic
Just heal lul
And?
For emi
The ice
Its a dildo
And never will
I probably haven’t met them
Oh
The one who saved subaru at the start?
The clown?
Who was betelgeuse again?
Its a known name
Its not a real list it doesnt have i wana be the twintails
you are aware of how cursed this is
if anyone has read the manga
https://twitter.com/AIR_News01/status/1234196269716795393
data squad
thats what it was called when i watched it
which clicked way more in my head
and i saw data squad instead
i googled savers
see
with their phone thingies
i just remember their dorky ass transformations
look i dont remember much of it
looking at the poster
it might have been savers
ok
i liked the transformation scene so much more tho
the lemonades if you will
the lemonade nades
OH
Madoka?
?
and navy
i just control the army
but shes the boss
**I am the Commander in Chief now**
the general general takes the role of admiral of these high seas
the navy only grows
yep

guess im doing this instead
i mean i was gonna do World God only Knows after k-on rewatch
Youjo Senki
**brah**

best part of being the general general is getting others to google for me
ah

why does that name ring a bell
so i can do a cover
i should find a rasputin instrumental

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rW5_jVTZPZ0
oh fuck ive listened to Go Cry Go so much that my brain is starting to tune it out a bit
?
" I've never seen it (and probably will never watch it), but my boyfriend loves it, and he kinda forced me to listen to this (and I fell in love with it... oh well)."
from the desc.
"My PC was just colonised"
"If ISIS heard this they'd be shitting themselves"
"When a french guy insults you"
ah the comments section
https://youtu.be/PGrxHO-B2TY
nyet

<@!102691114762371072> what GuP song should i listen to rn?
something about k-on music makes it stand out from the other anime songs imo
this song is LIT
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpR1m3AaWlc
One of them is bark at the moon was played through chris’s gear
I have many different theories about the songs which play in the show
The Symphogear bgm becomes much more powerful when you hear that they are songs sung my gear users
Barring mikus zesshou
Its my fav gear song
The xdrive one gave me chills tho
I see
11 is Bark at the moon
And also biki beserk
12 is Symphogear
also some people aint ever heard Gekkou no Ken
ooh that will be a little bit tricky
im checking rn if i can put it in my range well
as in

**FLIGHT FEATHERS**
and i might do dark oblivion
ive already got dangerous sunshine
more than 5
you know how many gear songs exist?
im a little dissapointed none of you immedietly went for a symphogear song
im making a list of songs im doing hold on
i see
where is it from again?

i think ive heard it meme vids
ah that sounds familiar...
i found a youtube comment on the Sakkijarven Polkka which is great
"""Stalin gets a message, that says "1 tank that looks like to be a mix of BT-7 and KV-2, is dominating the battlefield." Stalin replies with "Use radio mines." New message "Its playing song with the radio that destroyed every radio mine." Stalin replies with " Use heavy Artillery Shells. " New message " Now its going without tracks. " Stalin starts crying """

I can’t actually see the black cards
Perhaps we should borrow some black cards
Hard thinking of sort of open ended questions
Well anyone else got any bright ideas?
Thats a good one
“Unlikely way Dr Ver returns in Season 5”
Spend some more time on it tomorrow
Ill keep this up for like half an hour maybe
I feel you man
Ive made zero progress :p
Yeh
So come on down to jackbox.tv and enter the code XWBT and enter some Symphogear Quiplash prompts!
Well i just tried with my phone, its just a screen that says enter a prompt
Im tempted to give the room code out, bc anyone in the room can just enter prompts. No real need to see the screen for that right?
For Quiplash 2 you can make a custom game with home-made questions, and I need ideas for Symphogear related Quiplash questions
How many of you guys are familiar with the Jackbox Party Pack, more specifically Quiplash?
Ditto
Wow, the delay isnt even that bad, a few seconds off
https://jackboxgames.com/2016/11/02/how-to-write-a-good-quiplash-prompt/ ive been hsing this as a mental guideline
You know how Quiplash works?
Quiplash prompts
Yeah
https://youtu.be/y8WNjKeBMFE
Hold on
Im starting the broadcast
You know thinking about it i can probably get the ps4 to stream the screen to Youtube
The code is FYEZ
I think we on round 3 of the Symphogear Quiplash “come join a jackbox room and enter prompts” thing now?
I’ll work on this stuff Monday cause ima be busy with my bday, I encourage you all to think of great prompts!
34 prompts out of 64, thanks guys
So PLENTY
Well as much fun as you can have with a fuck over your friends game
Have fun guys!
Well i can see the prompt you entered Zio
Damm
I believe you can also see the prompts which have already been entered as well
Jackbox.TV and the room code is GEEW and try to come up with Symphogear related Quiplash prompts with me!
So you how how i was doing things yesterday symphohear Quiplash? Well Im doing it again
I mean when I finish this I could always try streaming from the PS4 some Quiplash
And more people are welcome to join and chip in with prompts
I shall continue this tomorrow
Right
Quiplash needs open-ended questions, and CaH has less freedom in that regard
Thats what im doing
Im changing the wording up, but other then that my brain is working hard now!
Thanks R-Senpai!
Like Chitose but less nose bleed and more every line you utter I imagine in a very tsundere esque tone
I’m finding it very hard NOT to ship Edgeworth and Phoenix
I’m playing through ace attorney bc if i do so my friend will watch Symphogear
Ok im convinced, but Moira is the one that runs like Naruto
Proof?
I never got any of the old gods, my pity timer gave me dragonlord
Damm, i dont even got n’zoth
Why not run deathwing /s
And DK
I havent got Umbra or cube, i got skull for free
Wait i dont think i even added any cubes...
Anyway now i gotta look foward to climbing ladder with shitty cube lock
Oh god fuck Flummox
I took candle with double deathrattle + Wax Rager combo
Hunter
I have one more class to go and i will have beat the dungeon with all 9 classes
Brode the game director
How much you pay Brode for that?
Hoo boy man constant consegration destroyed me one time
You meet a lot of Pathmaker Hamm?
I met the discard dude and he just destroyed me bc he had deathwing
Strangely, as the last boss i keep bumping into King Toggswaggle
Nah, whenever you cast a spell he draws a card which costs 1 mana
Your plan suddenly turns into burn mill
It sucks when you build a spell mage and you face that stage 2 trogg dude
Turn 2 with 3 8/8s and the guy is supposed to bring out big stuff by turn 3
And the first passive i got was your spells cost 1 less
I have like 5 Unstable Evolutions in my dungeon run deck
Man Hearthstone can be disgusting sometimes
It’s hard to be creative
So thats 64
56/64, and im stumped
Whenever you procrastinate hard enough to think of one 😉
You can always shout ideas at me
Zio you joining in or just watching from afar?
49/64 woo
Unless you are just Finè bc in that case what did you expect
I mean i’m probably the youngest here so dont feel down Zio
Rip
By like a few month
Hibiki is currently older then me...
You’re kohai prompt just made me realise
For Switch too no?
Gumshoe x Maya then

Oh i have to do this while also trying my hardest to stop shipping them together
Anyways i have to defend Edgeworth, gonna be a tricky one bc i cant see what wright is planning in the slightest, which is definitely worse then “he could be doing this but thats soo off”
Even tho thats a thing the game suggests
And also im not a fan of just pressing statements until i get the correct answer
High functioning autism really impairs my ability to understand what the shit Wright is trying to do
Honestly not been the biggest fan of the AA series
GX will get him lubed up for a s4 run
He’s not the kinda person to leave something unfinished
For every 1 I complete its a season that he watches
I brought the trilogy
Y u do dis to me wfc
Oh man now i really want to play MC2
I’ve been broke more or less so I haven’t been able to buy a replacement for a year now

Mmmm

Leak from Japan from what i was told by a comrade
Rumour has it that paradise will come to ps4 on March ish
Although WWE is fun ish
I actually use the ps4 more as an anime device then gaming
Get on my level with my own desktop!
Fuckin knew it...
What’s February?
I’d totally buy this series if I wasn’t both poor AND out of a computer
Aah
Rb3 the name of the anime?
Is the anime any good by chance?
Even harder when i get a pc
Well my wallets gonna cry a fuckton more when i buy mega and cyber
I see
Or is it a case where only some
But my question was could i buy a good chunk of this Nep stuff from PlayStation Store?
So is most/all these games on PSN?
Ah
Mhw?
I see
Alolan? As in the Pokemon Region?
Low plat is an intense place on console
Oh god that comp match took off 3 years of my life

My bro who was watching said a cop got lucky and pushed me off
One time i did that i went for a piss and 5 mins later i was arrested
Yup
My only danger was losing the cops before the correcr time passed
My loop was the first maps motorway
The ai is beautifully exploitable
30 minutes with level 5-6 heat
Did you ever finish that last challenge milestone?
I actually used a Lambo for cops
I dunno cars
The mishibitsu thingy
For NSF i beat razor with Earls car
Ah good memories with that

Konami is a small indie company
I played a lotta carbon and MW tho
Never managed to play it
Personally i kinda wish i got my hands on underground 2
Best part about that first map loop was that one of tje turns led into the donut pursuit breaker
That sounds like an intense as hell gamr

and also whats the name
right what religious symbol am i using
aztecs are south of that new barb city
babylon got one of their cities taken by barbs
but its 3 tiles away from my capital
i could have a city with 6 fish tiles
hnnng
i would actually be stealing from mongolia lol
i cant explore south of babylon
sort of
if i want to reach them i would have to go through mongolia AND babylon
theres a big ass fuckin mountain range is between me and austria

I sometimes watch my bro play
Does knowing OF siege count?
Sakimori thats me tho
damm
make necessary tweaks when you can
i mean if its homebrew just homebrew some of your own improvements to it
huh
<@153716766898388993> is the Symphogear Tabletop thing your doing based off a particular system or is it its own system?
encounters are gonna be resolved in who survives the explosions
i already have 2,400 hand grenades
i mean
question is which one
hmm, when Megumin dies in my CoC campaign, i should make a symphogear character next
she was pretty good, good damage output
i believe on a whim i made a level 12 fighter and based it off Tsubasa
the d6 aspect reminded me of that
Pokemon Tabletop United?
wait you heard of something called PTU?
rukia you having fun with shudderwock?
indeed
imagine angry miku not angry at biki
and biki is scared of miku angry
yea but considering miku loves biki

i dunno
*spam x harder*
the two legendaries i got was face collector and prince liam
10 minute animations
i see
ive never personally owned the DS franchise, but it doesnt seem like my kinda game
well i made a new deck which strives to maximise tess value
whats a suitable name for thief rogue?
oooh
how on earth did you get emeriss?
wait
i dont know bout you, but when i actually play tess in my decks i usually get houndmaster shaw so im curious how the quartet battle will work
you hype for monster hunt?
did he concede?
oof
hearthstone maybe?
https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/8dp61o/ben_brode_leaving_blizzard/?ref=share&ref_source=link goodbye brode
Thanks
<@!127644949884698624> you know what date is the monster hunt for HS?
Disgusting
Discord in class
Is Symphogear a mecha show?
dont even have the hero card
i think i have 1 UI
yeah i dont have the dust nor collection to play spiteful
i played tess for tempo
i face aggro rogue
then im like fuck it ill play thief tess rogue
the minute i run cubelock i face hyper aggro pally and hunter
how far you get climbing then?
lol
Hoooly shite Toki vs Toki was intense
Monster Hunt
I played wraith off of mana bind
First treasure i got was first spell you cast in a turn recasts itself
I was in the time loop till i managed to draw an extra card giving me lethal with blingtron
But cards you draw are consistent
Rng is still rng
Toki for example can restart her turn as a hero power
4 new classes with new hero powers and treasures fight off Hagetha
No the newest thing now
As toki i put myself in a timeloop with Beardo
<@!127644949884698624> WITCHWOOD WOOOOO
Shoulda spent my hall of fame dust on baku pally
Lul
Went better than I thought

OH SHIT YIP WHY DID YOU DROP MAJORDOMO
Ive been following that game for a while and its amazing
Yo! Monster Prom is out!
He fucked me up bc my hand was really really bad
His heropower is 0mana autocast draw a weapon from your deck
He starts off with Kingsbane
Tess nemesis is Captain Shivers
Ok

Fatigue druid, meet Jades fucko
Well it looks like im going into jade
It also heals me
I want to say first one
Yes
Deal 1 to each minion that is summoned by enemy
Or
End of turn heal 2 for all friendly characters
Ok deep question
Rip
Alice who u fighting?
See you in 9 years
Oh shit sun Tess v Shutterwock
Didnt even need to rewind
There was a very scary moment where she dropped an 18/18 and i had to pray that a randomly fired firelands portal hit it so it would die
Mega windfury but it kills the minion at the end of the turn
Btw the only time infinite toki used her hero power was on a babbling book
But i lost to 2nd boss bc she couldnt fight the board
Yeah she makes good combos i agree




Im struggling a bit with tess, her kits a little underwhelming
Rats
Thats tess’s nemesis then?
Ooh
Is echo a treasure?
Holy shit that’s disgusting
Beat it first try
I love it
Makes him sound like a victorian wanker
Shaw has that posh accent going for him
Didnt get any jade shurikens
Goddam tracker
Urgh i dont have the motivation to lose to mill druid with my Kingsbane deck
*thats no giant*
Why drop bigger minions when you can summon an even larger man
Thats a pretty good point
Im tempted to go summoning sceptre bc i like dropping big minions
When i tried it before it felt really weak
Is double hero power and 1 mana good for tess even?
Right time to play Tess
Rag is a good card
Turns out
Nah i won without getting one of those
Lets brutalise those fuckers
Thinking bout it godfrey runs like a lot of patrons
Second dragonfire round or entrenchment?
Hmm
Lul
and hypnotist murdered me with topdeck :/
i havent seen final fight AT ALL so
i have dragonfire rounds
minion
spawns second cannon
Tuskarr Raider or Reinforcements?
hmm
oh i get you now
strike bucket?
thanks
<@!127644949884698624> you got any experience with the cannon class for monster hunt?
G I A N T S
Dunno who im disliking more, Tracker or Cannons
WHY

Beardo is a more fun version of that
oh yeah i should actually beat hagatha at some point
Whoever made this mod however forgot to turn off the tank music
I found a l4D2 mod which replaces the concert music with Symphogear
Well I brought P5 Ultimate edition
But no call to arms
I have both pally legendaries this expention
Glass...knight....
Horray witchwood legendary!
I mean theres a gup tank fighting game
But that means I can download girls und gunzer
Well had to uninstall HS
Didn’t work for me so I uninstalled
I think my fav side story in P5 is Ikesugi and the fact a girl is stalking her to Yandere levels
I wasnt expecting the homeroom teacher to be a maid
Holy shite
I think it might’ve actually just been a gamemode
Same
Ima actually look at bf4 maps
Was not rhe one i was thinking of damm...
Ah that one
Near my late stages with the ps3 and playing bf4 played a lot of.... Metro
It was surprisingly active on the PS3
Naturally with the whole tower thing but there was like a particular period where i was playing specific maps a lot
BF4 had some interesting moments for me
Ah
You have a ps4?
Operation metro best map tho
I played bf3 a lot but I don’t remember the guns from that
Then i became reznov and shifted to PPSH rushing
That was around the time i was actually good at sniping
I have used the Mosin to claim countless lives of nazi scum in CoD
Ironically I understand XDU more than i do Girls front line
Apparently the 416
Ended up with what is apparently the best AR in the game
Was trying to get Mosin Nagant
32 GB switch at CEX is like £240
You check CEX?
You lookin at the wrong places
PSP hackin a different ball game
I know
Is FTL on the switch?
I already wanted Pokken switch and Odessy
I want one a lot
Aww
Thats fair
But it looks fukin dope
I haven’t had the chance to see the entire list of backwards games
The new xbox with its backwards compatibility
I say this bc Microsoft has been doing some sick things recently
Why is it i feel Microsoft has taken Sony into a back alley and brutally beaten it to death with a baseball bat
yep
dont need to
get that
P5
and OSU/civ on the computer
ill just stick to Hearthstone on my phone and OW and P5 on the ps4
ill gun for the doctor then
oh goo
if they are 12, im7
i can accept that
thats fine
they gay with eachother
im selling the game
can i fuck the twins
i just beat up Madarame
P5 has been fun
but i dont own god of war
The game is gonna not be listed soon
Yes
the school council pres and the onee-san interrogating me are related
HOLY
In that situation
The DMs south african, anothers austrian and 2 are yanks
We playin on roll20
An M1 Abrams tank shell iirc does either 25 or 65 d6
Whats 36x8?
You know
So at most i can throw knives
I have no skills other than the throwing skill
As befitting of megumin
I started speaking japanese and the DM, who isn’t much an anime fan, rolled a dice to see if one of my nades triggered
A deadmans switch triggere
On te event of my death
I made a deal with the dm
Btw
36 hand grenades yes
I carry 36 of those
If you take half your health in one go you have to make a roll to maintain consciousness
The person with the most health in the party has 15 hp
Just to give a comparison
I believe they each do 8d6
They have a lot of very powerful hand grenades
In call of ctullhu, i made a megumin esque character
Awwe
The paladin wants to be the daughter of Helm
Summer time im gonna have a session. Ima be first time DM and they are first time players
Oh we talkin dnd?
The number of hand grenades on her person is one thing
Megumin doesnt plan on living forever
Yea
CoC 6th ed
Yea
Anyway i would love to actually be a player for dnd
/find cover
They have a turn to run
Most likely
They have plenty of time to ***run the fuck away***
Everyone dies but die less harder
It woukd be max like 30 d6 ish
Btw all the nade damage wont stack up on my death the dm said
Same as thunderbolt in DnD5e
The nades do 8d6
I have 36 hand grenades
Bc
You would throw the map out
Im also encountering net decks at rank 18 so thats cool
Most the games i win but i cant be asked to deal with rope
Climbing is a mental chore at my rank
Ive never hit 10 let alone legend lul
How is HS then?
Yes
You sound like you are describing someone like Keemstar rather than TB
Whether you like him or not, he is someone who deserves respect
Look up
shit man
Wait wha
segregationalists in yankieville
see
history does not look kindly to those who stood in the way of change
and there will come a time where this decision will be reversed
they stand on the wrong side of history
well know this
i thought they didnt
did they flag witcher 3?
`like dis`
` this thingy
<@&448731309896892417> any yall nerds want to play multiplayer?
And also radio work too
He has done a lot in regards to blizzard, as a starcraft presenter
His video on Warframe gave it such a massive boon, it probably would not be as big as it was if he didnt make a vid on it
A lot of promotion of quality in games and good games journalism
As for what TB has done which is so significant...
Fuck those people
Wow
He’s had cancer for 4 ish years now, im struggling to believe he would wish it upon others
I once crashwd my PS4 with the super mininuke launcher with an endless mag
***Temporus***
Horray got a legendary off a kobolds pack
P5?
Well actually overwatch has gold weapons
Play overwatch, you can get men too
http://www.summonanevenlargerman.com

Death
*Ryuji please*
I didn’t expect us to ACTUALLY go to hawaii
Wait
<:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
Makoto was actually the girl i was gonna go for
I cant pick Yusuke tho
Walk with makoto or walk with makoto while slightly considering walking with Ryuji
ooh
JOKER CHECK THAT MESSAGE PLEASE
Obv later on it wont matter
Ye
At low levels with a new game
Imo
Morg got the short straw for outfits
But that let me beat down fuckers with just basic attacks
Admittedly by accident
At level like 3 i had messiah piccaro
Well think of it like this
E z
Butler costumes
Eee
For the cheap
I got all the dlc
I have Messiah Picaro
Glad they weren’t the traitors
Oh ok
You wanker
Better not be best girls
Twin fighting?
Woah woah woah

Oh shit please dont say people think the phantom thieves did that
Rip
Good timing
Oh lul
This principal is fat
One day
<@449062815534153748>
Saki is a monster
Well our protag saki just seems to have mad top decking powers
Lul
Well sorta super powers
“Saki” is an anime about lesbians playing Mahjong
Have you been watching “Saki”, Saki?
One of them used the fact that i was working and also rushing a singing project out to overtake me the git
Who also want to play on the ps4
But i have brothers

<@&448910257364795412> anybody who was dumb enough to give themselves this role want to play together?
is glitter moth odd or even?
Whats up with fallout 76?
P5 is fun
“Your most recent crime. A calling card addressed to me”
OH SHIT SOOOON
“Where did you learn to shoot a gun?!”

Meanwhile in the past
“Hey kid teach me how to shoot in this game plz”
VI will be a clusterfuck on launch
Bc Skyrim made the dough and people are quick to forget
I see
You know, perhaps a GFL role is in order
After GuP then
Bc i kinda wana watch it with you so you can explain this art
Saki have you watched “Saki”?
thats why you pick easy curve beasts rather than big ass combo shit first
I got golden Leper gnome so mine was worse
<@!127644949884698624> what 4 golden commons and gold rare did you get?
Tempting
Do I turn into a gay girl with super powers?
Why should i
You can still use gender neutral
I mean
I was gonna say the same thing lul
just tech to nukes
or
so this fights being fought on my land
i have open borders with both countries
however my empire stands between them
i paid syria to DoW the dutch
bc i have gatling guns and they have composite bowman
i have elected to not kill the dutch
amiright?
Right shall i invade the dutch or the syrians?
<@&448731309896892417> anybody want to play civ together?
You should play Persona 5 at some point WFC, i feel you would like that
I liked tim ribbing him with some of the failed glitches he did
You ever see the vid of the psychonaught speedrunner who did a run with 90% of the people that worked on thr gamr behind him?
to full health
the imps respawn upon death
yes
yes, and takes damage no?
you then defile
the second is at 2
the first imp is at 1 health
defile turn 2
mortal coil turn 1
no?
alice you can do it turn 2 what u talking about?
its more fun with godfrey tho
<@!127644949884698624> *This will be a mercy killing*
Yay.....
Got kingsbane
wow is free?
The header parts are Hex
my second try he coined another imp
where i didnt draw defile or godfrey
by turn 2 for me he had 2 imps on the board my first try
ye
the bloke has a fuckton of imps in his deck
defile does 1 to all minions
one at 1 health and one at two health
yes but theres 2 imps in this situation
so its constantly 2 1 or 1 2
Thats the Daily mail
Boi bbc isnt the uk fox news
I decided to instead build evenlock
See smart people save their 3,200 dust for the upcoming expansion
my point is why not make a gfl role?
you know there are probably more GFL players here than XDU
bestest girl
I feel it a lot in this game
And i blitzed a good scote at thr last lap
And i won because the AI matched my shitty scores
But purposely went slow
Then i tried it again
Making it impossible
And the AI went faster
The fastest i could actually go
I went at it full speed
So theres a race formst which is like a circuit but you have to set a fastest time around it
Yes
Fuckin rubber banding is disgustingly bad in it
Ive been playing that recently cause i got it cheap
Nobody here play NSF reboot fron 2015?
I should really get bloody nitro
Nice
Saki thats a cute emote where u get it from
Basically yep
if ferris can do it i can too
*im not at that stage yet*
you embraced the ferris image memes faster than i thought
<:HibiMiku:432007202136391690>
but... not the :huggo: emote
id do the hug emote but i dont have nitro
<@!127644949884698624> did you see the boomsday project announement
the new HS expansion
Vibrators and drugs
and also the quests for the scientific project game mode thing
i probably will
yes
i dont get paid till sunday rip
i see
so how much is the pre order in terms of amazon coins?
ye ye
its not preordering iirc you get it
btw alice
amazon coin prices might go down
isnt the amazon prime dayu coming soon?
wait wait
Civ 5 is very single player
Civ 5
but
omega defender is 2/6 taunt iirc
for example
they have an additional effect
omega is if you play these when you have 10 mana
and the omega cards
"magnetic"
legendary spells
theres a lot of things
and thats the only omega thing we've seen
8 mana 24/12 in stats
yeee
~~this took waaay too long~~
Just OTKed heroic big bad wolf e z

yes but it will be 1000% better in wild
its a fun thing for wild
too bad the mech expantion rotated 2 cycles ago
check out the initial "EXPANTION" vid
nope
i didnt have the card on me
and you pay 4 mana for it
its a 12/6
if you play it at 10 mana
<@138131889142628352> welcome to hearthstone
Im gonna have to use an emulator
sane
“Avoided tax to buy game packs”
Both would end my career as a politician if this came out
<:ElfneinDrowning:336656417035517952>
Unless the amazon app is lying to me
Well then i would lose cash if i used amazon coins then
Ah
Scrmz did you say that 10,000 couns were £70?
I highly suspect i will have no cash for Tuesday thanks to HS
Save it for the food
time to take a loan
Become a 🐳
A lot
But £20 is debt owed to me
I technically have £50 on me
Actually
Yes
I have £30 <:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
And to get 10000 coins would be £79.99
It would be 8000 couns
Figured it our
How much is the hearthstone preorder in amazon coins?
SHE POLYMOPHED IT THE WANKER
Happy midsummer fire festival

... SHIT i need to email them
hopefully in summer ill get a better job
sorry
so ive talked myself into it and i just now talked myself out of it
is premium a one off payment?
i see
what deck tracker do you use?
ive just realised i gotta pay for another month of Netflix if i want that...
i need to see what money i end up with
delaying that preorder by a week is disgusting for me
like
also that money is dipping into my preorder purchase
i probably wouldve said "ill pay half if we can share it"
if i went to the bank today rather than tomorrow
hmmm
im probably gonna actually try climbing when the next expansion rolls out
yes
guess they had no idea what i was capable of
as i smited them
i faced an even rogue once, i was absolutely facinated
otherwise ill just run quest warrior again :p
hopefully the preorder gives me enough dust to keep a relevant deck
to the point where i would be better off playing control lock
so it would be pretty watered down
i was gonna make even shaman but i dont have any of those legendary elementals
need to see what more cards come out
fingers crossed evenlock will still be relevant otherwise im shagged
me before i crafted Gen
and i shall test out my recording capabilities
ZENBU
in HS
scrmz want to fight?
some people ran millhouse for call to arms
apaprently in pre nerf even pally
except blackrock
i think i actually brought all dem adventures
ive been playing since old gods but even then ive got a moderate collection i would say
i only just got majordomo
not all of us are rich
listen
up to you
our future legendary v legendary deck will be hunter vs warlock?
so scrmz what your saying is
but who knows in the future
hes alright but he cant really fit in any decks right now
hes very much a "see how the boomsday project goes" legendary
Shaw?
*We have turned our curse into our strength*
🤔
oof
When we get evolve bakc lul
then play quest warrior
>at @ british people
<:ElfneinDrowning:336656417035517952>
Will aggro find the mech/magnetic package good enough to drop Kele or Baku
The 1/5 mech looks interesting
So the 5/5 mech looks like filler
And draws a beast, dragon and murlock
Taunt and 4/6
I was memeing, ashmore currently sucks and i cant really dust her incase she becomes good
7 mana 6/6 draw Zilliax
Im really glad i unpacked Ashmore
Means it survives more
The brain can act very excited when it thinks it knows what its reading
What little there is
I mean amgam was a emem anyway
That was 3 mana
Praise be mecha- cthun
<@!102691114762371072>
<@290431224596660224> she tried to fucking ping you
i already see mally druid being tier 1
lets see the rest of this set though
i mean i would be running double blood razor
you are dead to aggro by turn 5 for this to be that impactful and even then you are tanking health damage for this
and then your opponent just plays around it
too much cost
eh...
what on earth is gonna be Druids legendary spell tho
fair
ramp into naturalise into UI
biology project is nutty
and they added the new ramp stuff too
ahoKA
<@!127644949884698624> did you craft mally druid?

Druid legendary is actually disgusting

The hearthstone youtube
youtube

Legendary minion
*welcome to the grand tournament champion*

Odd mech pally,
Mein gott

The last thing standing in my path
I killed Malchezaar heroic
Hey wait
Cube priest
Ooh
*we be taking candle, thats kobold way*
Usually i do
Ew
*i know who you are*
But it adds plus 1 to cthun for exery spell casted
Nobody remembers
Thats wild now
Scrmz
Interesting...
I mean Baku otk
Nah
You mean OTK hunter?
Thats the ONLY way
Like me
Unless you play meme rogue
Control
And they all die to shudderwock
Lotta control
But yea
I watched his vid too <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
Ok *trump* calm down
Town crier and darius and stuff?
Do you think the rush package will make its way into Warrior?
The ancient one?
*gruul*
As golden
But is it as good
This will be fine
Where Yogg was good
This is a game
*but it can beat deathwing!*
At 10 mana you dont want summon 3 yetis unless ur in arena
For 1 more mana
Its yeti stata
And on curve
You’d want to play it on curve
Isnt a great 10 drop
**the dream**
9/10 x 3
Enemy instantly concedwa
Play
Cho hits this
Then
Hanchow
Get unstable into the goons boss
Play yogg in wild
You never dream?
Good for Arena
*handbuff*
It would be like dopplegangster?
Omega medic is great
By far
With the toki
Ill end you
Dont you insult my waifu Toki
Huh
Theres a difference between played and summoned
At the end of the turn?
All your deathrattles die
If thats on tje board
Does that basically mean
Sure
I GOT THE HEROIC CARDBACK
I BEAT CHESS
Odd priest vs thief rogue
This game is gonna be a clown fiesta
Odd priest?
What the fuck?
Oh yeah
Maybe the legendary spell and minion will be spell damage focused
Maybe in aluneth
Cinderstorm but its 2 cards and has a 2/1 body?
But its super week aoe
Its good maybe if you get a few taunts
Not really worth it
And deathrattle taunt?
Eggs maybe?
You are doing it wrong
If it isnt
The quest is done by turn 6 ish
Im not seeing its use
I can hear it now
Outside... that connection is something that makes so much sense in hindsight
I havent fought the twins
I finished it
I know Skull = Okabe
Any other gear connections i should know?
Aww that’s adorable
Isnt Fox <:Ver:336656981144109066> ?
I was also surprised
Yes
Panther is <:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
She is Hibiki
Ok
Aaah
Not Navi?
Isnt Futabas name Oracle?
And the main thing is neither of those tokens have tribes
See the 2/2 that summons an 8/8 has a shitty requirement for it no?
I think you would put it in a dr boom deck. When your hand has a lot of high cost mechs pumping out 3 is pretty good
12 minutes
I found out the full version of God only knows op 3 has an OSU map
I thought it was 3 random *mechs*
I just reread boomship
They’ll have no idea what I’m capable of
Go infinite tess
I would however
I just saw trumps vid. I wouldnt use the legendary spell to go to fatigue
I might dust kingsbane for the dust to get 2 espionage
I dont have quest
Thief and Pogo
Shit theres 2 meme rogues
Im poor
I might be able to actually run Sprint in my decks
Thats some *good shit*
Holy shit
So the 2/2 deathrattle burge is in the pool
Eggs
Too many deathrattles
The potion thing rotated out rip
Perfect for meme thief
Well it is discover so who knows
What happens if she gets Sherazin?
I do the middle line
Ive purposely made the last two cards in my hand and deck tess and shadowstep
Listen you dont get to tell me how greedy i can play my meme thief rogue
Blink fox gives random cards
Like its gonna see ANY other play
Cant wait to play this on my tess
Anybody play food fantasy?
If tutor 4 cards to make your decks more consistent is an Epic spell what on earth is gonna be the legendary spell?
Azalina, togwaggle, aviana, kun
That druid card draw gonna be disgusting in wild
have you not seen the video im referencing?
same tier as weasel tunneller
gruul is the best card in the game
win the game immediately
stick missile launcher to gruul
make gruul a mech
what else do you need to do?
you are the highest rank ever
AND ITS COLD
winter is here
i dream of electric HELLSHEEP
im ready to meme the fuck outta it
https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/92tujm/its_a_cheaper_sprint_that_tutors/
Hold up time
Im a massive HS nerd so i know my shit
Like ice fishing
By the same principle you can play tutor cards when your deck doesnt have the cards
Yes
Meme game is strong

~~discolock~~
Be great in zoo for a refil card
Lets go zoo

Get into food fantasy?
Have we even seen druids legendary spell?
Mecha cthun was a meme
Is the plan for druid to have too many OP cards?
Surely blizzard knows that these cards are disgustingly good?
3 mana mecha cthun
9-7
Wait
Fuck twig just have a 3 mana mally/hadrinox
The fuck
What
What the fuck
https://youtu.be/GPAsYTzi-iI
that means you dont know the best deck to climb to rank 25 (the highest rank in the game btw), rogue blood of THE ANCIENT ONE
Hey after actual communication like adults i have knocked that off
Don’t worry my memes are mega dead
@disguisedtoast
Maybe it depends on deathrattle trigger order/whos turn it is?
So a draw
What happens when two mecha cthuns Kill eachother and the conditions are met?
wait
I play to fuck around and have fun
I dont play to win, my main deck is meme thief rogue
Its about sending a message
Its not about it being good
You laugh at me now but my mecha cthun pally is gonna wipe you
Clearly you play this in mecha cthun warlock
Thats why i crossed it out
Well its a tech card so if magnetic mechs become common enough will people even run this over silence?
Oh my
Mod fight
Was supposed to log in today and finish the quests i have
Shit the fire festival ended
On 5 mana copy of 5/5 for priest
That would actually be real power creep tho
Fairs
<@!127644949884698624> will you build mecha cthun pally?
The illuminati matching up are really cute
Scrmz does it beat legendary v legendary?
Suddenly a third duelist
That would be interesting
mad scientists is common no?
no other sets?
just un'goro?
wtf?
unless even *that* has been locked out
go for the old sludge belcher
no
make a wild card?
oof
if you use share a deck
...ok?
When is boomsday project out?
Can you discover this with glyth?
Kill them on turn 3 kappa
We need a mass purify
silencing the game right now
I don’t think they’ve printed any more charge cards
Soulthief, togg, aviana, kun all get drawn by *the sprint that tutors*
The big wild deck is toggwaggle tho
Both are wild
Nope
But this expansion seems to be make mally druid mega great
Because just play cube
Shudderwock didnt start good
How good is druid spell
I mean what can be more broken then the druid cards?
The hidden gens
Complete the deck puzzles
We aint seen too many cards yet no?
Its 400 dust
Good off build a beast?
So its basically a hunter legendary
For hunter secrets
They have tess
They have 2/3 draw a secret
And mage isnt running this
Not all classes have secrets so its basically a hunter/mage/rogue/pally card
This is neutral as well
Secret pally is good because you drew AND played them
well thats a very extreme version but yes thats roughly how i speak
i wasnt saying golden monkey is a finisher
thats why i worded it like that?
back in the day
some control warriors did
this is a finisher in the same way golden monkey is a finisher
im still recording im just resting my throat
im not
e Z
then play this spell
have deck full of wisps
see you could double blood lust OR fuck em with legendaries
yup
electra
play wild and turn them into patches
or even better
ez
turn dem 1/1 with rush into deathwings
<@290431224596660224>  we can do REAL legendary v legendary now
Thats if you hit the tirion
But you also have an 8 mana secret in your hand
I mean yes you have 1 mana tirion
Its a paladin card
Why i rank it flat draw 2
It can also possibly result in the opposite
Draw 2
Sorry
I think it would be better to see this as draw 4
Interesting...
I faced a lot of odd pally in the rank im at
I saw it happen last expansion
At this point people are playing strange decks to wait foe the expansion
1 mana destroy all 1/5 or 2/6 taunts
Damm persona LET JOKER BE THE YAOI GOD
Yosuke is the best boi and i wish I could’ve dated him
Rogue was apparently going to get deathrattle shudderwock
It is if *a* minion dies
7 mana 7/7 if you control 3 minions with 7 health deal 7 damage to all enemy characters
Make star aligner great again
Revealed a while ago
What was the third palace again?



#notmyjoker

What games you play on ps4?
<@!173112001684439040> you have ps4?
Time to watch all these vids
Tyrande alive?
You very casually mentioned “oh yeah malfurion ded”
Anyway thats a fuckload of death
Ah i see
Or am i misremembering
Argus... isnt he the Leader of the legion?
So backtrack a bit
Garrosh: I will be remembered as the worst horde warchief
Sylvanas: Hold my beer
I wonder why
Story
Whats been happening in WoW with Legion and stuff

Jesus fucking christ that was a bit easy
Only card i needed was druid DK
Ive just crafted mecha cthun otk
The loss was something which I could’ve won had i an extra turn so
Im 2-1 with mecha cthun druid
I think it would fail
You mean prince 3?
Twig is added consistency
Biology project has been pretty good for me
You can also use it with wild pyro for extra mana that turn
It gets you faster to your combo
Allows for large card draw turns
Its good with auctionerr
Been using just floop instead
Im not running it since i dont have it
<@!196360095485919232> does your ver run druid legendary spell?
Time to reach 1,000 with mecha cthun
Oh shit im on 999 hearthstone wins
I just realised i have BOTH priest legendaries LUL
Make a deck with as many legendaries as possible
<@!196360095485919232> fight me

Don’t really need twig or prince 3 righ？
I might only need mallygos for mally druid ork
Thinking about it
Thats really cool
My silence tech has been replaced by.... Ironfur grizzly
FUCK ive made a huge mistake
Ah thats what felt wrong
That token deck... kalimos and storm the two cards i dont have
What the nani desu
Jesus phone

I threw together a zoolock deck, could you eval?
I got a golden electra and im considering dusting her
Yea
I dunno when i was playing token shaman i didnt feel electra was really necessary, maybe i was just building it pretty wrong
Ah i see...
Token shaman
Can you give a decklist bc I think i made mine a bit poorly
What decks is she used in
How is electra doing?
Id need to update my evenlock deck with boomsday cards but im not sure what to remove and what to add
Do i go Mecha cthun or evenlock for brawlnasium
Hmm
Trying to figure out just how necessary The Solarium is
<@!127644949884698624> do you play a lot of zoo lock?
I see...
Whats /g/ then?
Omg im right
Videogames? <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
Whats /v/ then?
Thats how warlock does it tho
Then hunters mark and arcane shot
Galvanisers
You can make mecha’cthun in pretty much all classes but the good ones are the three classes mentioned tbh
I think the only viable ones are druid priest and warlock
Oh yeah i forgot it discounts!
You need hand discounts no?
Oh yeah
Wait how does priest do it?
