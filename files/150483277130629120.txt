And probably most of symphogear. Whoops
Because I was blackout drunk for 2
True for me sometimes. I had to watch madoka like 3 times at least
Close enough

Needs her teddy
I also vaguely remember a couple of OVAs with hikari being a huge baby
Pretty gay
This is in the regular series?
Probably should watch it sober next time
The whole series is a bit fuzzy in my head even though I watched the recap movie right before the new one
If the show had been like that it would have been even more awesome though
where you can just spend your entire life chilling out to the cicada vibes
only if they weren't also spaced out by the non non biyori vibes
reimi just spacing and and using the motion of herself walking to lick her ice cream for her without expending extra effort from her mouth
yeah that episode was really good. lots of character development and another good musical scene
People eat that shit up for breakfast all day every day though. Would be a good anime candidate
The fact that we are in a position to be complaining about yuri harems is a testament to the growing power of yuri
Could have been a better show if they didn't try to make it be the Japanese anime adaptation of borderlands but not very funny
New black rock shooter is still pretty gay
yuri truly is life
i love low budget episodes.
