Made some cocktails

Tea(didn't have another fancy bottle, i'll try to get one tomorrow) - Demerara - Grenadine - Orgeat
*my floor is very clean i'll have you know*

I made some Syrups as a Present
Grenadine - came out meh still useable but missing something, couldn't get my hands on pomegranate molasses and rose water so there is room for future improvements
Orgeat/Almond Syrup - came out quit well, didn't have almond extract on hand but managed to substitute it
Rich Brown Sugar Syrup - came out good but also the most simple of them, does it's job well
Earl Grey Syrup - this was the winner of the batch, tastes amazing but only made a small amount for testing and now regret it, should have made more
thinking about maybe a swimming pool or blue hawaii/hawaiien
not quite sure what i'll use this for but i have it and can make more...

Made some Croissants myself and fooled around a bit, 
Top left 2 are just plain chocolate so i have something to eat in case of fuck ups 
Top Right corner is with a Kinder Joy filling
Bottom Left is a Baileys Croissant and it's fucking amazing
Bottom Middle is with Blueberrries
Bottom Right is with Almond Brittle

something like that sounds right
<:HibikiAwe:688397678572339230>
recently watched qualidea code, show was alright, nothing great but enjoyable, ended up liking the characters more than i expected 
Maihimie Tenkawa is basically Admiral Bikki with a Sword so that was great

This Weeks Adachi to Shimamura Episode ||AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH not enoguh Adachi||
Yo is that mothertrucking Genesis Testament Talk i see? <:oddonePog:771872809290825748>
would agree on that
indeed
also ||rip oniguma <:ShirabeCry:671887081026617345> ||
I'm aware but it stood out this chapter imo
overall pretty well written imo
everything seemed connected and it wasn't hard to follow even when swapping rapidly between characters
yea
also finding out how filthy rich her family actually is
also interesting to see kuroko coming into closer contact with the dark side
i'm curious about accelerators upcoming actions
just a romantic passing trough <:KirikaPog:605209108827734017>
kamachi was really ruthless this volume
||highly doubt that hamazura is actually gonna die üëÄ ||

World Trigger ||didn't jin lose the black trigger in a competition or so?||
MAN
i'm confused
a american M67 grenade requires 3-5kg of force to be pulled
pretty hard

i remember being quite dissapointed
BRUH - Promised Neverland Manga/Anime spoiler
||i guess they just completely got rid of yugo which implies that they may also skip the goldy pond arc? üëÄ WTF||
Man, Konami is the best <:KirikaPog:605209108827734017>
time to watch the new world trigger episode and pretend i know what's going up
i think they were somewhat "static"
lots of screaming to overpower stuff.....*i think*
barely remember the action scenes
uhhhh
pretty enjoyable overall 
*though it has been some time since then
üçÜ
*also the tan waifu*
looks pretty but story is nothing outstanding imo
ost was pretty <:KirikaPog:605209108827734017>
i watched it
oh hey i've seen art from that artist before
Cause Iris seems to be cultured
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I like how those bowls were sold out after that episode aired
also ||ai waving the penlights was hecking cute||
Finished, interesting episode really good music and sound imo
||So i assume the Homeroom  Teacher that visits Ai from time to time is Momoe's Brother/Father or so|| ü§î
BRUH
this Wonder Egg Episode starts rough already
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
||not getting to see the showdown vs lewis is a big loss||
*Mister* and Goldy Pond are a shame
production just seems all kinds of fucked
also next week is a recap episode
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
ep3>4 ||ominous "Help" on the wall completely forgotten||
ep4>5 ||Isabella gets a opportunity and joins the hunt for the children, ep5 starts and there has been a year timeskip with nothing happening||
and the cliffhangers from  episode 3 and 4 have been completely ignored pretty much
episodes 3, 4 and 5 started really slow and then ended in a cliffhanger
episodes 1-3 were kind of alright even though they were already a bit rushed
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
damn
promised neverland pacing is utterly fucked
I assume it fleshes out sakura's demise
OP and Claudias Song that played during the showdown vs odin were quite good
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
i was gonna say something about a episode
*but then i remembered that it was a Strike Witches Episode and not Sigururi*
what a weird episode
i was going trough the episodes in my head and i just went over that
overall i was pretty pleased with it
in my head i was like "eh this isn't that good"  but man it got me emotional
is that sigururi i see <:KirikaPog:605209108827734017>
*This Weeks Jujutsu Episode was really great* <:KirikaPog:605209108827734017>
kind of
maybe as "hozuki's coolheadedness"?
Hoozuki no Reitetsu
depends
you wanna get pumped up or relaxed?
clear head
Damn, Neiru's backstory
Oh so Momoe is ||the Teachers Niece||
It's egg time
i'm probably gonna rewatch it fully once it's finished *unless it's like super depressing*
i'm just wondering if ||that's all just a red herring, if it just seems that way cause we see him from ai's perspective or if it really just that obvious||
That shot ||with sensei talking to ai/drawing the picture of her seemed pretty ominous with Ai's face being out of frame most of the time||
~~das my fetish~~
EP6 postponed due to the Earthquake
damn, that's a huge ||cock||
started watching little witch academia, instantly sold
But he doesn't, there is a episode later ||where they are in a cabin in the woods and they get close to doing it but he says they should do it the proper way and wait until after marriage or so||
as you can clearly see
*i'm not over it*
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>

Yuru Camp ||best pairing Rin + Sakura <:KirikaPog:605209108827734017> ||
this is gonna be a trainwreck
Promised Neverland ||looks like they actually just skipped to the last arc|| <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
also ED is called "Koe" so "Voice" which is pretty on-point for this Season
The ED too <:KirikaPog:605209108827734017>
<:KirikaPog:605209108827734017>
oh yeah today *should* be the next World Trigger Episode iirc
i missed the opportunity to say *Eggcellent*
shit
man what an episode, excellent music choices imo
oh no....||YOROKOBE ~~SHOUNEN~~ SHOUJO||
it's egg time
which is super weird <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
German Sasuke is being pronounced as SaSUKE
but that is usually fixed by backtracking a bit
Following the story isn't hard imo
though i do admit sometime(especially in some recent chapters) it's hard to tell what just happened and who did what on a purely visually basis

God Damn Heaven's Feel III was so good
that ||Rider vs Saber|| Fight was just 6 minutes of straight sakuga action and Four Rings as OST perfectly accented it
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
i wouldn't say that summer wars was outstanding but it was enjoyable and had heart

Dub <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
yeah nvm
just like with yasuke
they actively had a hand in production iirc
iirc netflix is to blame for this <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
final mashiro no oto episode made me so mad <:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
that 86 episode left me so blue balled
well vivy was quite the ride
slightly
i mean
Daiwa Scarlet from the Game/Anime Uma Musume
"What do you mean they want an actual episode for the last one? but jimmy already rendered it on the ps2 and we all planned vacations..."
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
art sites and looking for proper tags
also that's Mihono Bourbon, she has a arc in Season 2 of the anime
think it's based on something like this
can't find a video of the horse doing the pose irl <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
<@!318271286184771587> https://youtu.be/LFiNdkt5634?t=92
it's based on a standing pose *some horses* can do iirc
that's not really a cat pose
*i was thinking for 30 seconds straight: "wait who was with phos at that time?"* <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
WEP Final ||well that was a dissapointing mess||
that half minute of just awkwardly eating a churro
wtf my broken system absuing spider can't be this cute
i think i read like 1-2 chapters when that was all there was
<:ChrisHappy:660870796696223744>
Okinawa Aquarium Yuri Bait's first episode was pretty nice
This is getting out of hand, now there is 3(?) of them
well gotta work now... <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
*less competitors*
also helps that the blonde guy seems to be gay too
indeed
just 2 friends, nothing to see here
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
time to watch that episode of okinawa aquarium lesbians(hopefully)
seems like ||kai has a crush on kukuru i guess
the blonde dude seems a bit gay
i like the parallel of the red boots and the heels-
*damn the last scene just played where kukuru jumps onto fuuka* <:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>  ||
<:HibikiThink:688429715362414641>

iirc ||corazon or a saint exploited that near the final of NT||
i also like how it ||introduced another weakness for accelerator cause now there is a "path" to be attacked by magic||
I don't think i've read it
<:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
Railgun always gets the better anime
ngl misaka with the ||AAA|| was pretty metal, almost as metal as Touma GT2 ||letting saint germain use magic with his body against anna||
lmao
http://whl4u.jp/wh34/gallery/og_gallery_en_20211002.png
who is that character in the top left?
Aquatope
||i like how fuuka and kukuru are basically a married couple now||
Aquatope ||is that a new challenger aproaching? üëÄ
Kaoru is cute ||
Shiroi Suna ||OH SHIT SHE GOT A BRAT
that was unexpected||
only 650 bucks too
DAMN
Aquatope ||Lesbian Aquarium workers massaging eachother <:MikuLewd:336656493606862868> ||
LMAO this aquatope episode ||umi-yan's costume got me good||
where is NT and GT?
aaaaaaaaaaah ||it hurts so much, this feels bad *but it can only go up from here r-right?||
Aquatope ||suddenly there is marriage on the table <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720> i hope the first wedding at tingarla is gonna be kukuru and fuuka||
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah the buildup in 86
and another break <:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025> it probably takes them the whole week to just render the legion <:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
i came here for wholesome aquarium lesbians not for ||penguins getting hurt <:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025> ||
https://youtu.be/n9WTWU97iXA ü§î
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Shiroi Suna ||there better be a barefoot wedding by the end of this after dropping the "white sand" and with the ED being what it is||
||i kind of wish they got to this plot point faster, not cause i feel like it dragged on but rather cause i wanna see more of where this is going and i doubt we'll get a 2nd season||
What a lewd way to end the Shiroi Suna episode
<:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
i'm someone that uses the whole range of 1-10 and not just "8-10 for the good stuff and 1-3 for the bad stuff"
aquatope ||expected a bit more but overall still pleased, solid 6/10||
thx
<:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
Revue Movie where?
anyway gtg takte care of some business
i just thought about....*aquiring* the PDFs so i can read on my phone during breaks at work
6/7 work week <:NotLikeFist:689188869974786133>
Yes but i haven't read since i finished GT3
*though luckily i feel like there isn't that much stuff i want to watch*
<:KirikaPog:605209108827734017>
oh boy time to try and keep up with 3 shows and fail miserably cause i got too much work
just finished watching the revue movie and what a watch it was....
this shall suffice for now
yeah
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
i was like "i didn't see the greyscale art on the side, i feel like i would have noticed"
hmmm
The Color Pages
OH
<:HibikiSad:738234648509022368>
but fanart based on LN scenes rarely happens
and now i badly want fanart of those scenes
well small spoiler for the volume ||the whole gang was in the hospital and Shokuhou tried to sneak into Kamijous Room with just a Baby Doll on and noticed that he's gone so she went back to the room that she is sharing with Misaka and they had a small physical fight which Misaka ended up winning, now she is watching TV while sitting on top of Shokuhou in her Baby Doll||
||like misaka and shokuhou riding the vibrating AAA together <:MikuLewd:336656493606862868> ||
also these scenes from the novel need proper fanart
this is like what the 3rd or 4th time now?
<@!87512939107450880> getting around to reading Index GT 4(i'm quarantined cause everyone in my family except me got the rona <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720> ) ||Styil vs Kamijou back yet again?
and Misaka dominating Shokuhou in Bed <:MikuLewd:336656493606862868> ||
he has to be running on fumes at this point
like bruh
a little bit more than halfway trough but fun so far
lots of interesting points set up for later i assume so looking forward to those
but man touma needs to catch a proper break soon he just got out of the hospital AFTER SNEAKING OUT OF THE HOSPITAL TO FIGHT THE MOST STRAINING FIGHT FOR HIM YET
Index GT4 ||yo dion fortune became the pope <:KirikaPog:605209108827734017>  ||
the ending theme still lives rent free in my head
<:KirikaPog:605209108827734017>
KnY that ||visual effect festival in the last clash between uzui and gyutaro||
whenever we get to that point
and the followup for that
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I can't wait to get crushed by *Manga* ||Shinobu vs Doma||
well
<:MichaLaugh:816901827349184513>
I CAN'T
<@!87512939107450880> HOLY FUCK THIS PART IS SO GOOD Index ||the debate in the white house where roberto traps his vize with the name of miss grocery and they fucking pull out shotguns in the white house||
man of culture
<@!87512939107450880> i apparently stopped right before on of the best parts ||The President and the Vize duelling with Shotguns but Fencing Style|| holy fuck this volume keeps on giving also i too like || Segggs|| <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
also ||without the frog doc touma would look so fucked up, scars all over the place and just a ~~walking~~ crawling misery||
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
<@!87512939107450880> god Index GT Volume 4 is so good ||the inofficial rematch of misaka vs accelerator, biker mom grabbing her shotgun to support these cute girls(which i assume will end in a bunch of people showing up screaming "MURICA FUCK YEAH" while blasting R&C a new one) and that scene "Not even a simple Yacht is enought to block these?" Othinus: "One of these is like 30 Million" Kamijou: "Fuck it, i hope they blast them all to smithereens"||
<:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
<@!87512939107450880> oh dayum....||brown skinned pantyhose wearing milf has been added to the harem||
from "pew pew i fire my railgun" to NT9 ||"I can add layers to the world and change it"|| and now we ended up at GT5 ||"see those possible lifeforms LIGHTYEARS AWAY FROM US? this small adorable loli just thought them into existence"||
also the scale is getting a bit out of hand
<@!87512939107450880> GT5 already starts out....interesting ||also bruh 2nd loli focus in a row, though this one apparently can fuck shit up real good if she wants to||
Wakarimasu
i usually read while i'm walking to work
ah that's pretty much where i stopped ||kamijou crying about his groceries after the prison train hit them||
uhhh where is my phone
||it has been mentioned multiple times so far in this volume that touma is currently hella broke and that the ATMs only start on the 4th of january again and then one transition chapter was like "these people from operation Handcuffs are worth that much money if you capture them, 10% if you just take part"||
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
oh yeah i do wonder if he gets in on some of that bounty hunting action
*though i'd assume he just takes care of them cause he runs into them and some other goons pick them up after that*
<@!87512939107450880> LMAO ||fking touma, the train he's in get fucking dunked, he gets yeeted to a whole another part of it and the only thing he complains about is his groceries ONE DAY AFTER HE GOT FUCKED UP DEALING WITH THE MESS IN LA, can't catch a fucking break+||
seems like i accidently stumbled upon a classified document
<@!87512939107450880> lmao touma going full ||i'll murder those fucks from the prison train grab their bounties and build a house out of chicken <:ChrisAngry:336656958272700417> ||
üëÄ
wait
that isn't season 3?
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
a lot probably would *especially if they did it like GBF and just add a official EN translation* but i guess they assume it wouldn't have a western market cause it's "too japanese" just like the Yakuza Game set in the Sengoku Period or so
i wouldn't mind if she sticked around or comes over to the "light side"
<@!87512939107450880> <:MikuLewd:336656493606862868> ||youen is quite the....character, giving touma her first kiss ~~as she gives him some weird mixture after applying maggots to his wound||
<@!87512939107450880> AAAAAAAAAAAAH ||i knew something was fucked up when touma got the 10k and also cause that is a long volume with 200 pages and things were going too smoothly, also lmao that they use what i called out as a actual point in that touma is now fucked up after the real train crash and holy shit the pain, reading this actually hurts||
Index GT5
ara ara energy is strong with the right one
*I want Mondaiji Brotherhood*
yes, classroom of the elite 2
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
when the AoT Episode has a Graphic Content Warning
<@!87512939107450880> just got to the part in GT5 where ||touma gets his guts blasted and saves youen, damn my boy is getting fucked up, i wonder if he's gonna stay in the hospital for longer after all this and we'll focus on accelerator or if hamazura wakes up and we'll follow him cause damn touma is getting trashed recently||
yooooo
god i love this volume
<@!87512939107450880> Kamijou Touma fighting a ||electric ghost with the power of ~~friendship~~ duct tape and extreme violence||
Gojo's face when ||he's going "EH? souma-oniichan?"|| lol
I saw the densest material on earth being posted üëÄ
<@!87512939107450880> finished the volume today man what a ride ||touma got that milf number on speed dial damn, touma and hamazura squaring up and getting ready to beat an elderly electric ghost with nothing but fists and a wooden mallet *and then they do nothing and get their kill stolen by kazakiri, alice was about expected, risako keeping her distance from ladybird cause she's still scared and sodate keeping his distance from ladybird cause he's horny also lmao at the scene where kihara dog bites aleister||
is this the prelude to dr. stone irl üëÄ
One Piece Manga ||Chad CP0 guy defeats Apoo, XDrake, and Izou, kills the MC, doesn't elaborate further, dies ||

i also like the comparison we got in NT9 ||That Magic and other stuff works like filters over a light and imagine breaker tears trough those filters to let the "true light/color" of the world show trough again||
*i just meant don't introduce me to a good channel that i want to binge 10 minutes before i have to go to work*
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>

Also Frolaytia is hot

*i haven't watched anything aside from 2 memes, pls be patient with me*
what show?
*also am i really gonna potentially watch a show just for the implied gay cutes*
oof https://twitter.com/MangaMoguraRE/status/1613818596475420674
guess i could always just tell them to watch mob psycho...
yea i know the premise and wasn't sure how raunchy it is but some people said to me that they can't think about any sus scenes
just told them(mother and littler 12 year old sister) to watch yuru camp for now
<:thinkguin:449379824692363282>
oh yea Kobayashi....
i'm thinking about Barakamon and Sweetness & Lightning
maybe Kakushigoto? but i'm not sure how lewd that one is
family focused slice of life i guess
anyone know a anime like Spy x Family, my mother finished watching it(lol) and wants more
<:ChisatoHmmm:995995095511859230>
<:wellshit:356783007488540672>
i also think it's not good but i didn't get asked for a good anime
BRUH I CAN'T
i got a call from my mom asking me about shows that are similiar to elfen lied
"uhhhhh- Why?!"
"there is this woman in my facebook group that's searching for something like that, she hypes elfen lied and chobits"
man i feel like i'm tripping....
