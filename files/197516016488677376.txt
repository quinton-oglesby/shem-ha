Huh, I'm not seeing it.
I've put up a carol as well
Yeah, it just came up
Jacky, not seeing yours. Also, 9point, you wouldn't happen to have an open follower slot?
I've still got some if you want me to open one
Yeah
Well, there is FGO, but its not really as necessary as it is here.
The guarantee was great, no way I was gonna be able to pull all 6 copies with my luck alone.
<@!480222275879305227> Red should be open now
Pretty sure I still have a carol up
cool, thanks Haz
yep. Took me most of the day, was worth it though, I think.
Rip
Looks like he is, he  seems to be clearing some of mine.
No, they don't appear to be. doesn't hurt to have them out though.
I'll put one out too.
Yep, 200 seems pretty low for the drop rates here
Hey, at least you've got most of the mats you need. I've got nothing but what I've gotten tonight courtesy of Teemo
True, the mats are just a matter of time
I’ve still got a ways to go on XD Hibiki.
I blame the desire sensor
Teemo deserves it, with the work they've put in
Most of the hackers seem to be taking a break, as far as I can tell. Its either people with good units or death by a thousand cuts right now
you're still one away, right?
Didn't find either of those two, but I found another one under half as well.
Found Accelerates, I'll see if I can find the power one after, that's probably the only one I can really do effectively
no luck here either
The latter
Thanks, added you
I’d take a shot at it, but you seem to be out of follower space.
Who opened this one? I can see what I can do, but I can’t guarantee much.
Agreed
Still a pity, I do need those drops from carol.
Ah, nice!
Ah, did I miss teemo doing carol? I’ve been driving for the last couple of hours.
Who put it up? I’m not seeing it.
I’ve got all of mine as well, if you guys want me to put mine up. Has someone already put one up?
Well, teemo seems to be lurking in this chat sometimes, as we discovered last night.
Thanks, added you.
<@!123525331343769600> you’re out of follower spaces as well, I was going to try and add you.
<@!291510486837624832> There usually are plenty of lurkers on larger discords. Usually I’m one of them,
It’s at this point that the raids go from actual raids to “how many bosses can you poke before teemo gets to them?”
Nice. I’ve had absolutely zero luck with getting any.
Anyone still have any blues they haven’t run?
Getting closer though!
I’m out of green carols
Nah, I’ve fiddled with it a bunch, still no dice. I’ll restart the game real quick.
Huh, not getting yours either. I’ve done cow’s though.
Yep
Yeah, I’ve added you, lucky, don’t think you’ve added me, if that has any affect on it.
Strange, I’m still not seeing lucky’s.
Not that I can see. I should have you added.
I don’t suppose anyone’s still got anymore green carols? I’ve just about hit half of the giga miracle crystals I need.
Oof, <@!140931012061298688> your list seems to be full again.
Haz, you’re Hazzy in game, right? I’m pretty sure I see your body raid, but can’t find your carol.
Ah, makes sense.
I can see several others, but I can’t see some of my friends raids.
God, I can’t find your carol either, Haz. The game just does not want me to tag her.
Cool, sent a request your way!
<@157710301779722240> I don’t think I’ve added you. What’s your ID?
Ugh, game please! I just want to tag bosses!
I’ll try and get some more damage in, but I’ve got to crash early tonight, gotta be up early tomorrow.
Top is, bottom isn’t.
<@!140931012061298688> damn, that’s gotta be frustrating!
Plus, I haven’t been seeing as many green carols around anyways.
I’m getting close, but green carol’s adds are a pain.
Oh yeah, duh. I’ll go ahead and add you.
<@284390402210136064> I don’t think I have you added, what is your ID?
I’ll give it a shot too, red is one I can do decently well at.
Yeah, haven’t found it either.
Anyone still working on green carols? That’s the only one I still need at the moment, and it’s not one of the ones I’m not really able to clear effectively.
That’s it
I only have one copy of red three star Shirabe and one copy of blue three star Shirabe.
God, the burn is killer for me since the game won’t give me any burnbasa or other healers.
All I’m missing for XD Hibiki is 7 Giga Miracle Crystals.
It do be like that.
Sounds good.
Iroha was going to start one, I think. if he hasn’t then I can get one going again.
<@455462883929751602> just keep at it, I’ve run at least somewhere between 15-30 so far, and I’ve only got 10.
I’ll jump in, it takes me a while to deal with the adds but I’ll see what I can contribute.
Woo! Only 5 more to go!
Try it now
Sure thing, give me just a sec
God, bottom add is SO close to being dead. The raid should be a lot easier after that.
God, it’s so frustrating, I haven’t pulled any healers so the adds just go to town on my units.
I’ve got a green carol going, haven’t had much luck so far.
Ah yeah, that will probably help. I’ve been working on one but I haven’t had much luck.
Same here, I don’t have any good dex units to really clear them, and they’re the worst part of the raid.
Anyone still working on green carol? I’m still trying to pick up some more giga miracle crystals.
We’ve gotta learn to clear raids on our own, can’t rely on teemo to clear everything for us.
More carols = more chances at giga miracles
<@157710301779722240> have you started the raid yet? If not, Angela also has one we could go for.
I’ve got 2 more as well, so we should have plenty to go around.
Most my damage comes from XD bikki, so it all tends to go to the taunt one.
I’ll take a stab at it as well.
She works wonders on the adds
Hmmm
Sanic still going or are we back to standard clears?
Man, that’s lucky! I still need 4 more.
Dunno. Also I cleared out my followers a bit.
<@!157710301779722240> It should be up now.
On another note, I’m starting to try and clear another green carol, anyone else feeling up to it?
Yeah, there are plenty out already.
I just need 2 more, game please
Jesus, that’s a lot of giga miracles. I didn’t even get any!
<@!120363283151585280> no, my IGN is also Wayfarer.
Yep, seems to be the case
I don’t believe I’ve added you, let me do that real quick.
Ah, ok. I can’t really tell, too many people have carols open.
We working on HDK’s carol now?
Ok, I’ll see if I can help with that first.
That in his red carol?
Until she gives me what I want, yes.
<@115964144120758280> did you end up getting the giga miracles you needed from green carol? Spicedog’s green carol’s top add is dead and the bottom is at half health.
I thought you already had one open?
Wrong person, never mind
Oh wait.
Damn, you cleared that fast. I was gonna try to hop in.
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
No Giga miracles again...
Haha, same here. She denied me healing twice in a row.
That works too, I suppose.
He’s on the discord, I don’t want to ping him but I think he’s got his ID on his nickname.
Kartis’ carol has both adds down if anyone else wants to join in on it.
Jesus guys, let some of us have some too!
Who’s carol is next, if we’re going for another?
same here
yep, probably
I've just started favoriting everyone that I add from discord, so I can tell the difference
Haha
Mine should be good
Yep, still working on it.
Makes sense, she’s counterattack based
Time for more carol farming all week
Oh god, 5 star looks like a XD unit.
https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&nv=1&rurl=translate.google.com&sl=auto&sp=nmt4&tl=en&u=https://symphogearxd.gamewith.jp/article/show/61034&usg=ALkJrhgyzMZyBH22H3x-Jamj8nJI0QL28A
The 5 star is technique
Blue
I’ll gladly take it, it’s a guaranteed MLB
Agreed
This should be the 4star welfare
https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&nv=1&rurl=translate.google.com&sl=auto&sp=nmt4&tl=en&u=https://symphogearxd.gamewith.jp/article/show/61033&usg=ALkJrhjiJLUlxrS6Vt9kCx-z_dskWQx-xg
It’s just one 5star Kanade this time around
I think so, and she gets a super awakening later. Regardless, I’m gonna try and MLB her anyways.
There’s a 3 star as well.
Well, going by the event in JP, there’s a 4 star welfare and the 5 star from the gacha.
Unfortunately, I think it’s her and Tsubasa in this event banner.
Well, we should only be getting a few of her gears this time around.
She’s supposed to be in the next event though, I think.
<@!120363283151585280> you and me both
and I still don't have any more Giga miracles
made it just in time for Sanic
that's dedication
Should be, if the ones for current units are any indication
LU for who?
I'm saving what I have to pull for kanade, so that I can minimize the damage to my wallet.
He's got one fewer then my total from that one screenshot as well
See, its the desire sensor
Jesus, wow
<:VanessaCracked:639136452600397829>
I have been running green carols ***all day,*** and the game still won't give me the damn giga miracles
I blame the desire sensor
ugh, all these carols and I still don't have the Giga Miracles I need
oof
https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&rurl=translate.google.com&sl=auto&sp=nmt4&tl=en&u=https://symphogearxd.gamewith.jp/article/show/61034&usg=ALkJrhiqwWpb3_iQYES3XZdDYdg47evG8A
yeah just a sec
I just hope it's single 5star banners, although I doubt it
She should be in the zwei wing event, which was the first one in JP, so it should be coming around pretty soon, if what I've heard is correct
TBH, I should probably just wait on using the giga miracles, since the kanade that's coming I think is the XD version, so its gonna need them too
I've tagged yours already, I believe
I've got one up right now, slowly working on it when I get the chance. Her adds are such a pain.
anyone working on a green carol currently? I'm about to start working on one.
I can finally LU my XD bikki
Finally!
<:KanadeSmile:672455286392356884>

Dead
The only reason I last a decently long amount in raids is because Chris is resistant to green carol’s damage and XD Bikki has a lot of health.
Nope! <:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
This is all I have for Tsubasa and Jii.
Haha yeah, but kanade is coming out soon, so I’m waiting.
Yeah, it’s part of why I’ve had some trouble with raids so far.
I’ve got none that I can level above 30, remember? I’ve just got them in the back so they can maybe heal whoever is still alive on the front line when they get in before they get one or two shot.

Man, I’ve hardly scratched the adds in my green carol after 6 or 7 attempts, and point already has one dead and the other one half dead after two attempts.
That’s not teemo, as far as I’m aware, at least.
No, teemo has another account with a similar name.
ah yeah, looks that way
nice!
I can put up one as well, just give me a sec.
nice
?

Working on some guys tech.
Gonna let my cp replenish for just a bit and I’ll take another stab at it.
The filters seem to work fine, but it seems finicky on if it finds the raids.
That one and Nep’s are the only two I’ve managed to find aside from the ones I’ve tagged already.
Yeah, just found that one.
Ah, is that what it does?
Yeah, the raid filtering seems pretty finicky most of the time.
Nope, not so far.
I’m not seeing that one. Is it someone from here?
Who’s?
Yep, those should be the three
Yep
Oh damn
Haha, understandable, if I use my rice the way I used it yesterday, I’ll be out before the end of the day.
I’m out of class for the rest of the day, if y’all are going to take a stab at whittling one down, let me know and I’ll try and help.
XD bikki can get at least 40k with 3cp, as long as she doesn’t get stunned the whole time.
Especially now that she’s LU to 70.
I hit them when I don’t have any other raids I want to do and have full cp. XD bikki tears through that boss.
I just did yesterday. She hasn’t been leveled to 70 yet, but the extra attacks make for a big damage increase.
So time shouldn’t be too much of an issue.
Green carol isn’t hard to deal with once the adds are down, since everyone has the free power Chris.
Sounds good, I’ll take a shot at it when I get some more cp back.. Are both the adds still up?
No need to ping them
Yes
That seems low to me.
Yep
Yep. The 5star kanade from this event is an XD unit.
Or at lease use that one as my main. But TBH XD bikki was a good start.
Although, If I would have known XD kanade was coming so soon, I would have made a bunch more alts and not rolled on them so I could do that.
Haha. But I want them on my main tho.
Of course, the 5star kanade coming up is an XD unit too, so if I’m lucky enough to get enough to MLB, I’m gonna have to collect them again. <:Ver:336656981144109066>
Finally got the 15 I needed to MLB XD Bikki.
Probably. I’ve been keeping an eye on the green carol raids, trying to get more giga miracles.
I was so frustrated
I only got one out of all afternoon yesterday.
Lol, when was this? I’m pretty sure I would have remembered if I was there too.
And nice drops, Nep!
<@!124052248144642050>  No, why would they do that? That would be too convenient.
No, he’s not on my list. Took me a bunch of refreshing to find him though.
I’ve got a couple up.
Speak of the devil

<:KanadeSmile:672455286392356884>
Cool, I’ll get on it.
Ping me when the adds on ship’s free carol are down/almost down.
On a related note, this red is about dead if anyone wants to tag or finish it off.
Haha
Is sanic still going or is it safe to put the game down again?
I’ve got raids I can post as well. I think I’ve got open spots as well.
If you get the chance, technique.
Well yeah, but I’m including raids in late game.
Lol, LU isn’t really needed for most stuff, just really late endgame stuff like high ranking pvp and such. It’s almost overkill in a lot of stuff.
Pretty sure I saw sanic post one where he got like 11 last night.
I’m back, so I can pt up anything needed as well.
Like I mentioned, green carol's adds are the worst part of fighting her, she herself is fairly easy to clear since everyone has the free chris, who deals with her pretty well.
yep, although randoms are still a bit inconsistent, but its like that in any game.
but Spicedog is right, for the most part randoms won't actually contribute unless they see that you've taken a decent chunk off and are actually trying to clear it. Asking here is the best way to get help.
<@107532017809260544> Mostly. Its a lot easier to find your raid if we add you to our follow list, so if you get the chance put your ID in your name or keep it on hand so we can add you.
dead now
Iroha's green carol at 36k for anyone that wants to tag it
ah, found it
not seeing yours either Kaelinn
god, still can't find it. I'm gonna add you Kaelinn and try and find yours
Yeah, its really finicky sometimes, which is irritating
yeah I have you added
let me make sure I have you added, I think I do though
<@!98283721718763520> I'm not seeing your raid. its a power, right?
I can't see sanic clearing anymore, so I'll jump on your P, accelerate
If sanic doesn't clear it, I'll jump on it. That's one I can do really well.
it's open
I can open a heart if you need another.
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
I'm putting one up right now
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
You don’t need to LU your units if you have no units
I’ve got one last technique up as well.
<:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
rip
Eh, never hurts to try and get more giga miracles
not yet, its about halfway, I just started another
pretty sure that's someone from here
cool! I'm out of CP atm, I'll see what I can do when it regenerates a bit
I decided to reroll for XD Bikki which came on the same patch that they fixed it, so I had to start from scratch.
yep, that is correct. That's how people started getting 70 really quick at the start
I'm waiting for the Kanade banner to unleash my whale side.
The beginning of that raid is the hardest part, its easy once the adds go down
Nice!
Aren’t they red when you’re mutual followers?
Yeah, the raid menu is still a little buggy, sometimes it gives out and just stops refreshing when you hit the button.
No dice, still not getting any new raids. Had this problem a couple of nights ago as well.
Alrighty, I'll give it a try
Uh oh, I think the raid menu has given out on me, its giving me the same people repeatedly.
the usual then?
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
Did you get anything good though?
<@!107532017809260544> yeah it tends to do that
get anything good?
oh wow, this whole time?
ah, ok
<:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
Well that might explain it.
Hey <@!107532017809260544>, if you get the chance, mind checking to make sure your green carol is still up/open and seeing if you can clear out some of the randoms following you?
any of y'all find karu's green carol? I haven't found it yet.
got one giga miracle from that chris, its something. <:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
Can't remember if his nickname here is the same as his IGN though
we still have karu's to work on as well, I think
isn't that the kill bonus?
I think it is, I had this a couple of nights ago too, and it was fixed when I got on the next day.
Nah, tried that too
It fixed itself after a while last time, I’ll just crash for now and see if it’s fixed by tomorrow.
<:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
No dice with refreshing the list after restarting the phone either.
Huh, haven’t tried restarting the phone. It’s worth a shot.
<@!301227758678179840> Define full reset. I’ve tried running another raid to get it to refresh the list and restarting the app.
Guess the game is telling me to go to bed
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
It won’t load Haz’s either
I tried running another raid to get it to refresh, still no luck.
I would try and help clear it too... if I could find it! <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
Multiple people can get that one.
^
Been working on that one. Just killed the top add, bottom is about 2/3.
Oh, duh
I don’t believe I’m familiar with that one.
It’s super expensive to buy more then one, though, maybe two if you’re really unlucky. The points only last until the end of that particular gacha as well, I’m pretty sure, so you can’t save them.
Yep. You get points each time you roll, and you can buy copies of the units from that gacha. Not how you’d want to get all of them, but it can help you get the last one.
JP XDU has a gacha points shop that lets you buy the units if you roll the gacha enough, right? I wonder when they’ll add that in global.
Yep, people actually sell accounts in some gachas, FGO I know has some of that going on.
Haha, yeah, but that would mean less money for them when we’re rolling for units.
<@!292700103544930315> Sanic has been clearing his following and follower lists whenever he gets off.
Anyone working on clearing technique raids at the moment?
Well, I don’t think worrying about bans is an immediate issue, it’s unlikely they were anticipating it since it happened in the first place and hasn’t been dealt with yet. But that doesn’t mean it won’t happen, we’ll probably have to wait and see what they do in the next patch.
Haha, true
I believe in you!
of course, that all depends on if she comes home... <:Ver:336656981144109066>
<:KanadeSmile:672455286392356884>
One more and I’ll be ready to MLB Kanade when she gets here.
Got 14 now
dead now
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
roll both as in MLB both?
Hopefully they will have some kind of guarentee
Dunno, we're gonna have to find out
I wish they weren't, I'm gonna end up pulling all Tsubasa
They are
I'm going to be whaling for Kanade, so good luck to you!
ah, thats my bad then
That's Tsubasa, not Kanade
pretty sure she's technique, not heart
Probably just about what everyone else will need except technique
Trying to collect mats for XD Kanade, I can just *feel* myself setting myself up for disappointment. <:Ver:336656981144109066>
shhhhh
Poor guy really wants to clear this technique. Anyone else free to give him a hand?
I'm aiming for her, hopefully I'll be able to get her MLB.
Well, the XD Kanade coming out soon is technique, so there will probably be a bunch of people able to do body raids a lot better when she drops.
oof. Keep an eye out for sanic and teemo. They might be your best bet.
my XD Bikki is what pulls me through most raids.
Most people don't have many good technique units yet and most people's good units are intelligence.
oof, you're gonna have a hard time finding people who can do effectively on those.
<:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
Dunno, doesn't quite make sense to me either.
can't you still see raids under the 60 minute mark if you're mutual friends with that person?
TBH what you really need for Green Carol is dex units to deal with the heart adds. As I said before, carol herself is a pushover, the adds make the fight hard.
Sent a follow your way, I’ll try and get on your green carol.
<@!253913016142135297> hate to bug you again, but your follower list is full. Whenever you get a chance you might want to see about clearing some randoms off.
Yeah, sure thing, I’ll give it a shot in just a sec.
Alright, I’ll go ahead and add you. Later if you get the chance you should add it into your nickname on this discord, it’s easier then having to find it every time someone asks, it’s not needed though.
<@253913016142135297> what’s your game ID? It’s a lot easier to find it if we can follow you, more so if you follow us back.
I don’t have any good dex units though, so it might take a bit. Where’s Iroha when you need him?
I’ll see if I can help out with it. The the adds in green carol’s raid are the hard part, carol herself is a pushover once they’re gone.
It should be coming around fairly soon, if not while AoT is up, probably almost immediately after.
There is a intelligence Kanade 4star wellfare. the XD Kanade is gonna be in the banner with XD Basa
Giga rainbow and giga power shouldn’t be be too hard, plenty of people have good LU’d blues, so red bosses rarely last long.
Then join us in bullying green carol for them.
Started working on this green carol, if anyone else wants to lend a hand. Top add is down.
I thought it went out to everyone at 4 hours and stopped showing at 1 hour remaining.
I blame the finicky raid filtering system.
Shouldn’t be, if it’s still 3 hours
Is anyone currently working on clearing a green carol? If not I’m probably going to start one in a bit.
Her damage and DPS increase for free Chris makes for a lot of damage
Haha, the only reason I can do anything with them is because of XD Bikki
I'll probably put up another green carol in just a bit.
just keep at it, you'll get there
Oof, no giga miracles. I just need one more
nah, he's talking about your name, not your ID.
<@!140931012061298688> have you tried adding them? their ID should be just a bit up in this channel.
second add is just about dead
first add is down on tonynho's green carol
<@!253913016142135297> I’ll give it a shot after my cp regenerates.
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>

HDK’s green carol is at 83k
FM is a chris gear
Fierce Maiden, right?
if you've got that many copies of her though, might as well build her. She is a 5star, so she'll be good for a while, and there is only one other body 5star out that I'm aware of.
XD Bikki and AoT Bikki are both int, and both are widely used in PvP.
yep
I’ve managed to kill the top add on HDK’s green carol. Bottom should hopefully be down soon.
Nice, got the one last giga miracle I needed.
Second add is almost dead as well.
The first one goes down quick because of her taunt though.
haha, it be like that sometimes.
First add is down.
Green carol raid is up.
oof
and I've got no copies to MLB them with.
Lol, I've got none, the only two I have are the two three star Jiis.
Lol yep, there you are!
Gonna have to remember that for next time.
<:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
For some reason the top of my lists is all Chris.
Well, hindsight is 20/20. And yours didn’t show up too high on my list for some reason.
Huh, yeah that would have been a good idea too.
Although I’m sure luck also is a factor, my XD Bikki was going to town with crits.
I should, yes
I had roughly the same, just about all of my damage came from MLB XD Bikki and two MLB free Chris.
Pretty sure I managed the same. She’s got a lot of damage output.
Agreed. I'd mind it much less if I didn't have to go clear out randoms every time someone tries to add me.
I just added you, been clearing the following list of my old account. It's such a pain that the follower list has limited slots.
I’ve still got the Bikki account saved elsewhere, but I don’t plan to really do much with it once I finish getting what I need to MLB Kanade.
Just about. Just need to get some more stones to finish rolling. I just need one more, I’ll be able to get the last one from the 10th 10pull.
It also helped that I had absolutely nothing else good on that account besides XD Bikki.
<@!120363283151585280> I decided that between an MLB Bikki and an MLB Kanade, I wanted Kanade more, so I rerolled again.
<@!120363283151585280> I can take a shot at doing some damage, but your follower list is full.
I would trade you all of them for one more Kanade if we could do that.
Haha
I've gotten three of her so far
Ah yes, fun times
We do have people from a number of different countries here.
Well, depends on your time zone.
At least the silence is manageable.
God I hate red carol. That burn is horrible.
It’s similar with ignite, all of those need red carol’s crystals.
Yep
Nah, I’m talking about green carol’s heart adds.
That’s gonna be fun for me now, since Kanade is technique...
It’s the miracle alchemist (green carol) specifically.
<@!96113323279421440> I’ve burned through the story missions for the first two seasons, so I’ve still got plenty of free stones. I’ll probably spend if it gets close to the end of the banner and I don’t have the last one.
The person that made GZ rate up in this banner should be dragged out and shot.
I’m on the 12th of the 10 pulls currently,  and I’ve gotten 5 Kanade, 1 Basa, and 4 GZ.
Thanks, I’m probably gonna need it.
Nice! I may need your help with those once I get my last copy of Kanade.
Starting a technique raid and green Carol raid if anyone wants to lend a hand.
probably, I think that's most likely.
Seriously, what is that even supposed to mean.
Nah, its *totally* fine, you're just gonna *"contacted by us individually."*
Yeah, go for it
Try it now
Yeah, sure thing. I just cleaned my follower list out a couple of hours ago, fun how quick it fills back up.
Figured I could go ahead and try to work on it a bit.
It's already up.
Just wait, he's got his own way of doing things.
No, Sanic is a hacker who regularly helps with raids.
Of course, if Sanic is going to be here soon, I might as well wait.
well, you're not alone on that. Got none either.
works for me
I'm gonna hang out until tech, but I'll probably run after that, I've got something to take care of. I was able to make a bit of time for Sanic raids though.
so 19 is the magic number now, right?
make that 17, I didn't realize we did another roll call for a bit.
Yellow/ green carol for me. I just need enough for Kanade.
Alright, I've gotta run, but good luck to the rest of you!
Might as well. Int right now?
Am back for a bit. Who is doing what now?
Not seeing this one.
So it’s 18 now or did we figure out who is missing?
Not seeing it, I don't believe I have you added right now.
Still need just about all of the miracle mats. <:KanadeBleh:672455306059579392>
Working on that one right now. I should have enough tech mats after that one is done.
I've gotten 0, so you're ahead of me.
I saw that one too, managed to get the hunt bonus as well.
Oof, probably no hunt bonus for me then I suppose.
I still need to add him again, I guess I'll keep refreshing until I get it.
<@!291510486837624832> Still working on that green carol?
You can start leveling them after you get them LU'd to 6star, I think.
Ah, his skills
?
I've got another green carol open, I think point's is still up though.
<@!291510486837624832> What is your ID again? I need to add you again.
Yep, I was on that one. Was a bit too high for me to get the hunt bonus though.
Can't do much with the adds though, since Kanade is tech.
I went ahead and started one.
Anyone still working on green carol? I'm looking at starting one if there isn't already one up.
I’ll try and make a dent in your raid, but I’m gonna have to crash after because it’s very late where I am and I need sleep.
Cool, sent you a request.
Yeah, no problem, just whenever you get the chance.
Angela, when you get the chance, can you clear up your friend list a bit?
<:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
At least I'm getting Giga Miracles finally, so I can't complain.
Lol, I'm slowly working on chipping health away and then Point waltzes back in and flattens it.
Got 5 giga miracles from it! <:KanadeSmile:672455286392356884>
No, Point's Green carol
Starting up a green carol if anyone wants to join in.
I’ll trade you for some regular miracle crystals.
Oof. Makes sense though.
I’ve consistently either gotten nothing or the mega ones.
I’ve cleared all of my normal green carol’s already, I only got 8. <:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
I figured it would be the giga miracle crystals I wouldn’t be able to get, not the regular ones.
Oh shoot, we doing raids?
Starting to work on another green carol. The regular miracle crystals are about all I still need.
I’d be surprised if it *wasn’t* an emulator.
Nah, you do have point though.
let me know when you end up doing regular green carol raids, I'll join you if we're finished here.
<@193933390775320586> You can get regular miracle crystals from normal green carol as well, unless you're me. <:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
Probably a good idea to do another head count
I've done my three, the three from my old account, and any ones I could find open.
I've already done all my 3 today.
Yep
This game doesn't want to give me regular miracle crystals. It's all I still need. <:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
nah, he's not gonna jump in until pinks, so go at 10.
It's honestly incredibly amusing how organized this got.
I'm going to pass on this one, going to take care of something else, <@!193933390775320586> ping me if you're running regular carols and I'll try and help out.
That's probably a good idea, getting new headcount whenever you switch to a new attribute is probably the best idea.
I'll probably head out after these body raids.
Cool, I’ll add you back, gonna crash afterwards though. I need to fix my sleep schedule before I end up becoming nocturnal.
No, not that I’m aware of.
On another note, really happy we got another Kanade song. Backlog resolve is pretty good.
If I had realized Kanade was going to be here so soon after the AoT event I wouldn’t have even bothered rerolling for Bikki.
If I had really invested in the other account I would have stuck with it. But the only reason I had an MLB Bikki on that one was because of rerolling too. <:Ver:336656981144109066>
Yep. I came to the conclusion that I wasn’t gonna be able to pull enough copies of Kanade on the other account without spending an amount of money I was not willing to spend at once. I decided I wanted MLB Kanade over MLB Bikki, regardless of whether or not Bikki is better. I do play most of my gacha games for waifu factor first and foremost, after all.
Not sure how many I went through, but there was a fair amount.
Not sure. I usually had 3 or 4 of them going at the same time, I was running a macro to run the tutorial and through a number of the early missions, and I would restart them if I didn’t pull at least two Kanades in the first five or six rolls besides the guaranteed one.
And yes, I was going for her, so I was glad to finally get the last copy I needed to MLB her.
I have been. All afternoon. <:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
I just need the normal miracle crystals. The game is only giving me the mega and giga ones.
Game please. I just need the normal ones. Stop giving me the other ones. <:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>

If they weren't already
Both adds should be down now.
Second add should be dead after I finish this run.
Unfortunately, that is probably the case.
Yep, 70 XD Bikki does good damage. I've been using my old account's Bikki to kill the adds on my green carols since they tear through Kanade and the rest of my team right now.
is it? someone must have gotten it after I jumped in.
One add on my green carol should be down fairly soon if anyone else wants to jump in.
Since she's a 3star, she's got low stats and doesn't get much from LU, so the only reason she's used is solely for here skill that ignores defense, but she looses that when you LU her. You make up for her low stats with the stat increase cards and memoria.
That's correct, she looses the ignore defense, which is her big selling point.
No, don't LU her at all.
TBH, for me its more of that it just cuts down on time.
I've been running carols all day, and I'm still missing the regular giga crystals I need for Kanade. <:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
Nice!
Oh boy
Started another green carol though.
Not that I'm aware of atm.
Only 14 more now!<:Ver:336656981144109066>
Finally!
Also, adds down
Should be open now
Sure thing
After I get XD Kanade to 70 I might be able to do at least some decent damage to the body boss, but that burn is still going to destroy her.
Adds on my green carol are almost down.
For actual raids its basically just dogpile the bosses.
^
<:KanadeSmile:672455286392356884>

Yep. The one I still don’t have. <:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
Yep, that’s actually mostly why.
True. There’s also AoT Basa, I suppose, but most people already have her LU’d.
They should drop from the power raid and red carol.
She shouldn’t, I don’t think. Probably relic.
I thought I saw another one last night?
Haven’t they already?
