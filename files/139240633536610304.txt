i dont usualy draw symphogear but when i do its really random

someone randomly prompted at me to draw this:
should do something crazy
draw her getting water during a handstand while fighting someone with a katana taped to her feet

who else has katanas for legs and does a handstand while fighting - glass of water sure why not
O kk :p
