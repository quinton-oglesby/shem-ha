Behold the Grenadier Reload

Because it’s not an “LN genre”
I bet there’s a LN adaptation you’ve seen and didn’t even know at the time
Power fantasies are always going to be popular, which is why most LNs that get adapted are in a few niche genres
Good stuff
Or her Endless Waltz moment at the end of season 1
Also if we’re on  the topic of traced moves from mech shows, idk if any of you have seen Chris’ Gundam Wing cosplay sessions
And more than you know are getter references
An homage is an homage, serious or not. It became popularized because Masami Obari always puts it in his shows
It’s still a good look
It sounds kind of trite but giving it time and distance helps a lot in my experience
Sounds like relationship anxiety. It sucks, but it’s not uncommon after a breakup. The hard part is that it’s often not a specific fear but a vague sense of unease.
Anyway, this obviously all adds up to the unavoidable truth that we need a new Getter Robo anime
I’m not making a value judgement, just saying the reasons for renewal/cancellation/whatever are a lot more opaque now
So there’s a lot of money flowing into shows before they even start airing that would normally come from merch
And foreign investment is also much bigger - CR, Netflix, and other companies are joining production committees more and more often
Overseas markets are way bigger now than when a lot of the conventional wisdom about merch and sales was formed
I have no explanation for the existence of W’Z though, it seems difficult to justify even as a music publishing promotional show
I was thinking of HaoLiners
I must have gotten them confused with another studio, my bad
Definitely one of the ugliest anime of all time, really groundbreaking ugliness from Hand Shakers
Afaik Hand Shakers is a GoHands production, which is a Chinese production company. Japanese market sales aren’t the whole story there.
Did it have production problems in its original run that give the studio good reason to try the concept again? (This one should be especially familiar)
The characters don’t have names, just archetypes. that’s the definition of generic
It doesn’t matter if no one will watch it
Complaining about deus ex machina in a Symphogear discord  is hilarious
Dumb music joke incoming
