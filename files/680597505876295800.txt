well guys im going to bed, see ya tomorrow üôÇ Good night
isnt that just the burn debuff?
you mean the bottom right one?
<:KirikaApproval:586957465552158720>
yep
that i cant do actually, i know SANIC was doing it, he must be using something different then me
but things like fire or poison can still kill
you can basically change your dmg and your defense
mmm i never tried cause i dont wanna fuk with rankings but sure i dont see why not
if you wanna add some last minute raid i can do it before i go
im just finishing the last 2 raids and going to bed lol
