Oh yeah it also has a lot of yuri


machikado is a goldmine of gifs
or "My neighbor is a demon girl"
She's Shamiko from Machikado Mazoku
but a lot of people make that mistake
nope
Also this gif makes me smile

I’ll go now
I’m sorry
ELFTWENTIES
You can call her
More cute anime *girls*

Oh, she seems cute <:Ver:336656981144109066>

the first time I heard that line I was drinking something
**LISTEN TO ME SL&T!**

<@!263983345669505025> thanks! For all the pics
Perfect

Damn
Hololive is virtual youtubers right?

<@!231025503643893770> i’ve seen that character before, where is she from?
Nexto Generations
Borubiki

And I’m a FIFA semipro player
I am probably the person that makes the most fun of FIFA
Monogata- I mean Seishun buta yarou
For example with my favorite anime of all time
It’s fun making fun of stuff you like sometimes
I do that sometimes as well
One thing I appreciate of Gear is that is has for the most part easy to remember names

The character I feel is very similar to Basa is Sagiri Ameno from Yugari sou no Yuuna san
Not all blue haired characters look like Basa
maybe she's sick of so many versions of that image

Imma steal the uzaki pokemon trainer pic
is that MF Genju Mercury

IIIIIII DON'T WANNA DIIIEEEEEEE
everything is a reference to the big bang
it started with the big bang
Kill la kill is nsfw
Jojo is inspired by fist of the north star
technically
Shirabe's is gorgeus
we should get Yuru Yuri eye catchers for Symphogear
*Looking good Joker*
I WANT TO SEE THAT^
Ok but why yes? Hahah
Why is Ver x Ogawa a thing?
He says he wants charm point
So it’s my fault
But then I realized I literally said Kirika and Shirabe
I was going to say Maria isn’t a bonus
Thank you!
It’s very hard to look for them in the chat history
Someone has the transformations for kirika and shirabe S1 style?
The mexican president literally just went and signed some shit
The alamo wasn’t even a fight
Lol “fought”?
Like a normal girl who hasn’t lost an arm, found her father who abandoned her after years and had her lover brainwashed and be forced to fight her twice
She looks so pure an innocent
Have some S1 Biki
We need art for Ignited Miku
elfu-9
a lot of genocide today
Try to guess^ is that Chihaya or Tsubasa?
Same empty thoughts
they also didn't include Akira
I did this in minecraft

EA-Sha

Change my mind
B-Sha should’ve been EA-Sha
Indeed

is there fanart of all the girls using gungnir?
<:thats_hot:651252050172182529>

Looking cute as always

<@!199928870810419200> <@!171395487247630336>
Of course


But the pixiv link just sends me to the home page
Nah nah i meant the girls who they were
But the bot doesn’t help
I actually posted it here to know the source haha
Muni has the Chainsawcat
Some blood in this pic
I’ll do that
Where can I find it?
It seems interesting
What’s that?
Not even doubled
I have no idea why americans are allowed to have guns in their cars
Gun possession should be reserved for household only
Can I ask something about the emotes real quick?
Try to open more
Don’t worry
We all do that
I don’t think that’s the case
It’s because they have fun with you
It’s not out of pity
I can assure you, your friends keep you around for a reason
Those comments are exactly what sometimes make people don’t want to share stuff with others
And stop being so negative dude
Maybe you have more in common with them than you think
You could talk to your friends about what you like more
You could try learning more about what your friends talk about
It just means you are in the wrong group
No
It doesn’t exist
That has NOTHING interesting about him
In this entire world
There isn’t a single person
Ok stop right there
Maybe you haven’t found that group yet
And I eventually found a group that liked both of those things
I love anime and sports
You could try learning more about the topic they’re talking about
If you are not comfortable there, there’s nothing wrong on seeking what makes you feel better
And does happen sometimes
That can happen
Maybe you are in the wrong group of people
I said that because of what i was gonna say next
Yeah no
There will be topics you care about less
Is because there are things you will find more and less interesting
The reason you can’t please everybody
I’ll rewatched all SG soon anyway
...i don’t remmeber him tbh
<:TonyEyeRoll:580561912513691679> <- who’s this guy?
^another example
and I start playing with my shoelases
no phone, no computer, no nothing
I've been completely isolated
I just find stuff to get distracted with
but even if I get off discord
gladly I have nothing due atm
not what's happening right now
^example
(Example): I have a homework due in 10 minutes
it's just not happening
Lately it's been harder and harder to concentrate on stuff
he'll give you waaaay better advice that we ever could
go to a doctor
yes, that's how adolescence works
and as far as I know, the police are investigating the accounts of the admins
it got taken down
I am ashamed of my country sometimes
it had over 5k members!
"Share experiences and tips on how to sexually harass women in subways and buses"
that dedicated itself to and i quote:
there was a facebook group here in mexico (gladly it got taken down)
still, I would recommend searching for expert help
i have no experience with it at all
dysphoria I wouldn't know
yes it is
And of an expert
It’s best to seek the advice of your parents
But if you’re underaged
It doesn’t sound like a problem tbh
It shouldn’t, you should seek profesional help
But it doesn’t sound right
I guess you could ask someone more knowledgeable than me
That in any way is a symptom of being impotent... I think
You’re underaged?
As soon as possible
And have some analysis
You should go to an expert
I mean
They say as soon as they hit stores they run out
While someone with the username Reaper-kun is writing
You say that
It’s the first time I see people here using masks
But people are definitely scared
Luckily for us it has barely appeared in Latin America
They were literally taking the jugs out of the clerk’s hands
People here went nuts for water and alcohol
don't let your mind trick you
you can always use me
if you want a bad life example
that hasn't been able to graduate
i am a 25 year old
hahaha
you aready have the problem figured out
you'll get there
don't force it
and a little bit higher
then go a little bit higher
talk to one person
start small
don't go like: I wanna have 100 friends!
have a small objective
to get your mind use to it
you have to do stuff little by little
it's all in the mind
trust me, I'm an expert in the subject
it doesn't matter how much others push
if you don't want to change
even then
you are not gonna have people around to push you all the time
you should be the one pushing yourself
you need no one to push you
To be honest
why not?
well you've identified the problem
we humans tend to overthink and feel alone, even when accompanied
it's like that to a lot of people don't worry
sounds like a good pay off
how much time left till you finish?
is your "to do" list in order?
have you eaten yet?
hmm
same as me
what time is it for you?
it depends
i commend you
and put it down
normally I read 2 paragraphs
of course i have problems with picking up books and reading
again... can't concentrate
i've never been much of a reader tbh
could be
<:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
Exactly
i wish someone on FIFA just destroyed me 5-0
that's the most fun tbh
it actually feels kinda sad when you reach the point where 99% of the playerbase can't beat you anymore
and the other guy online just forfeited
mostly cause I got 5-0 fairly quickly
and I wasn't even completing the matches
nobody was even close to beating me
and it felt awful
i went 35-0-0 online a while ago
I would've dropped fifa on the spot
nah
the guy that won was the one that beat me
maybe that would've been me
they did invite the guy that won the whole thing to plenty of international tournaments
internationals I guess
if that makes any sense
it would've kinda sucked to be champion on my first try
it made me realize I could get even better
and I enjoyed losing
which in FIFA is **A LOT**
I lost 5-1
then in the semifinals
FIFA 19 to be exact
FIFA
I was a rookie and I reached the semifinals fairly easy
I was actually kinda dissapointed
and I got to the semifinals
it was my first time participating
one year ago I participated in a national tournament of a video game
but
weird example
exactly
there would be no point in them
if achievements were easy to... well... achieve
so that achievements feel better
it has to be that way
attitude can only take you so far
not just attitude
and effort!
your future depends on what yo decide to do with it
it's an opportunity
it's not a gamble
some people call it a gamble
it's an opportunity
to death
*hugs* god
god they can truly be dangerous
any more than that
anime and video games are great as a distraction
quite the opposite
but that won't give you happiness or fullfilment
I sometimes (most of the time) just want to ignore everything and play video games and watch anime
Yup
Small goals
or go for a walk
you can go to your pharmacy and buy some thing for your stomach
i don't like politics either
usa are happy with trump
it doesn't really matter who wins the democratic race tbh
Pepsi tastes too sweet imo
Coca Cola
it's the main contribuitor to my obbesity
yes it is!
i actually feel ill when I don't drink it
yeah
i have an addiction...
ah yes! you see
and then another 2 bottles of 1 liter in my room
there's 5 liters already
so i drank it all by myself
turns out my family was not home
then bougth another 3 liters for my whole family
i bought 3 regular bottles in school
hmm
no i didn't
and i ended up vomiting
i ended up drinking 7 liters of coke in one day
due to some circumpstances
i remember one time
To dess or nor to dess?
yet
don't die
will you survive?
so i'm fine
i ate not so long ago
i am right in the middle
how long till you get home?
what i mean is
i don't think the public has 0 power
oh don't get me wrong
so having these big companies call the shots makes sense for both parts
I mean when you think about it, big companies don't want to have laws passed down that interfere with their economy, and of course the country don't want these big companies to go or to not make money for the state anymore
that could be all show for all we know
and the people with power in the states are the ones that choose the next president
I am one of those people that think that public votes don't matter
if you ask me
i'll be honest
i am not 100% uninformed
sadly
80% of voters are like me
because
it is
as if I was the first person to make an uninformed opinion
I can't?
politics are not my speciality
as i said
i'm wrong
MAYBE
but I think Hilary had more supporters than the new candidates have
Trump might lose
It's not secure of course
out of the last 5 presidents only one didn't last the 8 years
i mostly meant recently
but conservatives are still a majority
liberals are more vocal
and they are a majority
conservative people are happy with trump
ok i'll make myself clearer
it only happens if something like watergate happens
but is very rare for a president to not get 8 years in charge
is it hard? of course!
you can make it work
my father is one of them
I have seen several examples of people that were on the working class and now they are succesfull
yes and no
but the basis for it is lies
it works, it is functional (most of the times)
but because of lies
I think society "works"
in summary
hm
when people actually agree with me it feels weird
i got used to being attacked in this server haha
neither do I tbh
but again, it makes sense to do charity
I'm sure a lot of people do charity cause they do feel that it's helping
*not everyone of course*
for people to look up to them
they give a small part of something that they really don't need anymore
but again, it makes sense
1. Cause they don't have a need for it anymore
2. Because that gives them status
and give money
that's when billionaires start to run charities
even Chris is confused
all that is as powerful and sometimes more than money
calling shots, secrets of state, relationships
it's not even money
but the intellectual employees do have an environment that keeps them "happy"
maybe the labour work they don't care
they do need to have happy employees
and for that
they just want to maximize profit
but I don't 100% believe they are "evil"
i think they call they shots to be honest, that's something I truly believe
through their actions
but here in mexico there are a lot of people that choose to be poor
maybe in other countries that's true
yes and no
again
through their actions
for a lack of a better word "choose" to be poor
here in mexico there are many people that....
he has many good points
but
it¡s awful
yes and no
hmmm
the difference in mentality between a poor person and a rich person
Where Marco Antonio Regil a very famous mexican starts explaining
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASM2O8D3hiQ
but it's in spanish
very relevant
i also remembered a video
the starting line is much closer to the finish
yes
of course if your parent have money
you must start sometwhere
<:MariaWhat:672245553920344080>
a cleaver person will invite the head of a big company to dinner
a smart person will work all night to get 100 on a test
you can be smart but not cleaver
not quite
"Cleaver"
i meant more lilke
i didn't mean smart
sorry
and who to be
knowing where to be
it's more about being smart
specially in my country
that's true
but you do need a bit of luck
i'd say it is mostly effort
I have my father as an example
as I say before
i am optimistic
it does require a bit of luck
it's not always effort
i do admit
that's true
but it is possible
they do deserve a better quality of life
food for their family
a better house
and they deserve better life
and big ones
I do think it has issues
i am not defending it
exactly
doesn't make the effort to get a job
someone who doesn'r work at all
but "no one deserves to be poor" is just a lie
they really do
and they deserve a better life
yes
and do nothing
someone that decides to not get off the bed
i mean someone lazy
i do not mean someone sick
taking my words out of contexr
again
never get up bed
not a single day
if you never work
can you back that statement?
are you sure?
i am just emphazizing that this is the way it is in my country
i've seen it
and it's not something that was said to me
but this is the way a lot of people **IN MEXICO** that are poor think
I've **NEVER** generalize that this is the way all people think
I am not saying this is how all people think
It's not something they said to me
I have seen it!
But it is true!
2. Look for a "miracle" to come. In the form of the lottery or someone giving money to them just because.
1. Blame the government, 100% of the time!
that a poor person does 3 things (here in mexico, I can't stretch that enough)
he explains
For example
maybe it's not as bad as here
*i've heard*
France I've heard it happens too
because that's how my fucking country is!
that's why I've been saying MEXICO a lot
that's what I'm telling you
here isn't!
here it happens a lot
you can't deny the fact that there are  people actively choosing to not have a job and receive compensation for it
but there has to be a better way to reward people actually working
yes we shouldn't
people that decide not to work ever
only lazy people
I mean lazy people!
Illindus I'm sick of you making me sound like I mean everyone
yes!
there is no reason
they choose not to work!
do you think that is ok?
and still get compensation from the government?
of people that don't work at all
doesn't france have a severe problem?
I never saidthat 
> believe that *most poor people deserve to be poor,* 
<@!99695384296701952>
exactly
because I know them
but I know there are lazy people
i do not think that welfare is lazy people
tbh
and I don't have an answer
yes I know
which actually hurts
a couple of them are my fucking uncles
cause I know a lot of people who do that
yes, what cypher said
it's heart breaking
i can only imagine what not having food would feel like
I don't wish that to anyone
i do not think that poor people should have a shitty lives
I can't promise I will change the way I think tho
I'm sorry if my view is very different to yours
kick me out
but by all means
giving him advice
and i stayed 2 whole hours here
there was this guy going through shit
what have I said?
people taking my points out of context
that's what I'm talking about
i never said that
no it's not
people here abuse the system to take money that should be going into infrastructure, other people that actually need the welfare and help
easy point
i'm talking about the whole system
specifically
not talking about welfare
again
yes i know
that is possible here
and abuse the system to live comfortably
it is on people that are perfectly able to work but decide not to
it is not on people not getting a job despite their efforts
that's my problem
EXACTLY!
that scalated
welfare was just an example
i know
yes
but, guess whaaat most people that did, never worked
you would by the action and have a very high position where you could work and earn a lot of money
which is the company that used to have the monopoly on gasoline here in mexico
you could buy an action to work in pemex
that's the closest thing
yeah
action?
in spanish is a plaza
idk how to say it in english
until just recently you could "buy"
there are other ways people have abused the system
also the fact that at least here the problem on lazy people is not just on welfare
all I can say is that I do care about people, I do care about well being and I do want this world to be better
you can think that tbh, I'm not going to even try to stop you
I don't know if you people think I'm some kind of evil person
i do believe in this conversation people have taken my statements out of context a lot
i am not even going to respond to that
Mexico
I can only talk about experiences in mine
again, i don't know how it works in your country
it happened like 20 years ago
but that didn't happen recently
today he is old, so it makes sense, I get that
since then he just gave up and decided to live on welfare
as far I know they used to have a very big company that got shut down from a bad decision
What do you mean?
I know
> And humans as usual being too selfish to give a damn or do things right
<@!468591607332208641> I am talking about this
if it's benefitial to them but hurts others, they don't care
people mostly think of themselves
same, see you later
i don't have any data at the moment
but I do know it is a problem
and I'm sorry about it
yes I don't have all the data
instead of staying here and defend my points
don't you think it isn't easier for me to just leave the group?
you're taking my words out of context
politics are not my speciality
I said
never said that
while making my homework
or tryint to
and i am still holding my ground
you're 4 against me
first of all
i am getting tired of this
seriosly
ok stop it
it made them money without having to go there to work
because
that is also a problem
like in the Pemex example I just told you about
there are other ways people have been abusing the system here
not entirely on welfare
again
i have not
that money could be invested in other things
but it does take a toll on the economy
not ruining
i'm saying
no
that i'm refering to a very specific group of people
cause I have claimed time and time again
in fact I do
i know what I'm saying is bold
stop making my arguments sound worse
I AM NOT HATING ON POOR PEOPLE!
that decide to not do anything with their lives
I'm refering to a veeeery small percentage of people
not even close to a majority or a substantial amount
again, not refering to everyone
you can't live your life doing nothing
they you do deserve what's coming to you
if you don't do anything with your life, if you don't contribute or decide downright not to do anything with your life
this all sparked because someone said that no one deserved to be poor, to which I disagree (and still do)
i wish I had
to be honest
i do not
but it should go to people who actually need it
that's stupid
i'm not saying we should get rif of welfare
I'll refrain myself of talking about a topic I don't know much about
And I do hope welfare evolves even more that it can help people not to just survive
I just want to clarify, I am not against poor people, I do not want them to live in the awful conditions that they do, and I'm not against welfare at all, I know it helps millions around the world.
I do admit I don't know all there is to know about the matter and I apologize, I do know people that abuse the systems here in Mexico but I do believe they are an insane minority, but gladly that seems to be happening less these days. And I am sorry about what I've said, it is very rare for me to apologize, but I do admit I need to read more about the subject, as I stated I am not very much into politics but I do have some opinions, maybe they are very wrong but I'll read more about it in the future.
i dont' want to make any more stupid statements
i am reading tho
and i'm sorry if i offended anyone
i'm sorry i said something so bold
i'm sorry i don't have the data to back my claims
ah yes, because I can't make that conection
i never said I wanted people to die
poor isn't the same as death now is it?
i was not but ok
and I am working on something else atm
you do realize you're going 4 or 5 against me?
and I am trying to give my honest opinion on the matter
i joined this server to talk about an anime no one of my friends even knows about
i just can't anymore
Can I just admit defeat?
I would me a monster
i will never be against that
i am not against helping them
i am not againt poor people
against welfare
I am not!
I repeat
i am not
That one is just disgusting
But that one
You know I don’t get offended easily
Yeah
You don’t
Trust me!
You don’t wqnt to know
It is going to cause a shit storm the size of Kazakhztan
I can’t imagine how everyone will react when the Kaifuku anime comes out
That one i think went a little too far
||With the female ogres||
The only part of konosuba movie which made me feel uncomfortable was|| the whole rape scene||
Naofumi didn’t want
And raphtalia is marked a second time because she wanted
He also uses that
And since in that world technically slavery is permmited
He’s just going to use any means necesary to get his goal
I don’t think that Naofumi is evil
Never read it
Don’t read it
A revenge anime
But it is a less evil
Yeah it’s not a good thing
She would’ve died in that cage otherwise
At least naofumi treats raphtalia much better than the way she was living before
Everyone on kaifuku is a terrible person
It doesn’t work
When he’s a horrible human being
In kaifuku you’re supposed to cheer on the mc
At least reviewers had the decency of accepting that the main characters were assholes and perverts
In the first 3 episodes of the manga
Kaifuku has: ||rape, domestic abuse, torture, mutilation, torture rape, brainwashing and drugging||
Tbh
I am still doubting it
Then square it
Multiply by goblin slayer first episode
Remember the last episode of school days?
Compred to reviwers
Kaifuku is a monster
Hahaha no
Hopefully
Most tv stations will drop it instantly
It really can’t be adapted
Nobody knows
It’s a revenge anime
You don’t want to know
Trust me
So that it doesn’t appear everywhere
At least make it a hentai
But if you need to addapt it
Yes of course
And you’d have to actively look for it in order to watch it
That way at least it wouldn’t appear on normal tv broadcast
At least they could’ve made it a hentai
Is 100% vomiting
Kaifuku
But i didn’t get offended
And goblin i thought it was bad
Shield hero i thought was ok
I didnmt mind those shows
You can use me as a measurement
Or as morally correct
And naofumi is never presented as a great guy
That’s your own fault
That’s not star wars fault
And start shooting people
If you watch star wars
It should be treated as fiction
It’s fiction
I don’t like to think of shows as political speech
Maybe i shoudl’ve released her
Maybe this is what raphtalia wants
When they take raphtalia away he asks himself
and he knows he’s not a good guy
Naofumi does doubt his actions at times
But it’s common sense to understand **it’s fiction**
You can see controversial topics in fiction
Yeah me too
Exactly
But that’s going to be done by this people with other media anyway
Yeah I guess it could be used to deny alegations
That’s stupid
Of course I am not going to go out and imitate Naofumi’s actions
I think you can enjoy it
And should not be taken as a role for you to imitate
If you understand that the show is a work of fiction
Exactly
To us, of course he did
In regards to the world of the show, Naofumi did nothing wrong
We also need to think of the show in the context of the world it presented
But it’s definetely less bad
It’s not fine
As i said before
So he managed to free much more people from slavery
And then she asked her owner to help her free her people and he accepted
Like her brothers and sistes
But i think raphtalia would very much prefer that to die on a cage
It’s not a good thing
As I said
I mean yeah
And not be controversial?
To tackle it
How would you make it
For example child labor
If you want to write about a cautionary tale about a heavy issue
And authors would not be allowed to tell their story as they want it
That could hinder on freedom of speech
But if you took that to face value and started not tackling issues due to some viewers having wrong takeaways
But I think we as viewers are smart enough to decide “oh that’s good” and “oh that’s bad”
Of course
You can have takeaways from any show
Dragon Ball? Naruto? Bleach?
Yeah I should do the same
It’s just a dumb shonen
Well maybe it can be taken as a cautionary tale
And he had to make a decision on the spot
It was just naofumi was put in an awful situation
Yeah I agree
There were many other options
It isn’t
You need allies
Because you’re desperate
Maybe you’d at least give it a thought
But if you were in his position
Morally correct? No of course not
Again
That’s the justification
And much rather prefer to have someone that can’t backstab him
The justification is that naofumi will not trust teammates anymore
Even if he’s attacked for it
I am saying he will use any means necesary
It was just an example
But you wouldn’t see that as a honorable strategy
Allowed? Yes
What I got of the show is that naofumi is the type of guy that will throw sand at your eyes
I enjoy it as a dumb power fantasy or shonen show
I agree
Yes
Fine tried to drop the moon on earth at the end
None of the sympho villains are redeemable
I’ve said this before
Ver is mostly just delusional
“Was I a hero?”
“Yes, the worst kind”
Even Maria kinda forgives him
Gear kinda wants you to forgive ver at the end
I mean
Also don’t own slaves
Is that it doesn’t matter how deep you get, you can always pull through
If you can take any good thing from shield hero
I think the show is a power fantasy that says: “this person was screwed over by everyone but managed to pull through”
That’s a good thing
Not everyone will think the same way
And that’s ok
I don’t think we’ll agree here tbh
The author is a woman?
And here in the west
We have a different morality now
Exactly
Raphtalia could’ve just stayed
It was dumb
Yes i agree
But the fact is that raphtalia decided to stay
Call it stockolm syndrom if you want
Naofumi tried to free raphtalia
He tried to do it
You would see heroes as heroes and villains as villains
Because i am acting like this bad guy
I should change
You cannot be like: oh i am being a bad person right now
If you don’t humanize the villain at least a little
And nowadays people say those villains aren’t realistic at all
They made stories that showed problems being tackled in a pretty cartoony way by a villain
That’s exactly what Disney did back in the 50’s
No prob
Shouldn’t this be in <#336310266654490624>
Because as a beast it has no sense of right and wrong
The only morally correct villain was the nephillim
You know what?
I said “as much wrong@
And I personally didn’t see her muchas a villain
The only “villain” that didn’t do **AS** many things wrong as the others was Nattasja
<:FineShocked:672430513025187840>
Helloooooo dictatorship, how are you doing?
Mexican president: "Either you are a supporter of this new regimen, or you are a supporter of corruption"
I know I am not the best guy around, but I am sure at least one person should like me
I am tired of failed relationships
But i am tired
Probably
*almost*
It’s almost like I don’t want to kill myself rn
The girl that one week ago told me she loved me and she wanted to marry me just told me she started dating someone else
I can’t keep trying forever
Turns out I was asking for too much
My life is a fucking joke but at least I thought one person cared about me
I don’t even know I want to try anymore
What future can I have?
The most useless thing of all time
It is the only thing I apparently have
Football knowledge?
What do I have?
I am 26 years old, I am still in college I can’t date shit
I am tired
Everytime I try dating someone it is like I have to do the whole work
I haven’t had a girlfriend in 5 years
Show me a more depressive image, I’ll wait

The mexican people responded by covering the walls with the names of women that have been killed and there has been no punishment whatsoever for the killer, also by projecting the message "Un violador no será gobernador" at the building, which translated means "A rapist won't be governor"
So the president decided to barricade himself
Also the fact that in the first half of 2020 the country registered more than 2000 femicides.
A candidate for governor in the state of Guerrero in Mexico called Félix Salgado Macedonio has been accused of violence and rape against two women, one of them even accuses him of death threats. One of the two accusations "*expired*" so to speak because this would've happened back in 1998.  The candidate was questioned about the accusations against the candidate and he responded "*Ya chole*" which basically means "*Stop asking me, you're annoying*". The candidate **OF COURSE** is part of the political party that the president founded back in 2011. So "Palacio Nacional" which is where the mexican president resides has prepared a wall in case any protests arise tomorrow at "International Women's Day".
*Context:*
Meanwhile in Mexico's government headquarters:
The only country in the world where the politicians give the middle finger to the people and they applaud
Welcome to Mexico
**FUNIMATION DOESN’T LIKE THIS JOKE**
Poundcake*
then bunny girl senpai tried to pull the same one on us
*haruhi vietnam flashbacks*
PLS NO
No, too easy
Is that a mf...?


I’ll take a pic when I arrive to my apartment
We have very similar interests
I see you’re a man of 🇲🇽 as well
With Chisaki in the cover
There’s another one of Yuuna
Specially if your favorite character is Kazuma
<:MariaWhat:672245553920344080>
The Konosuba movie is amazing
Ah don’t worry Jin gets karma’d a lot
But I love both
In the manga I think Meimei is the one that gets the more character development
In the anime Miyubi is fantastic
I learned that if the character is working it’s because it is a prodigy that graduated at the age of fetus
14
<:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
Me an expert who just saw this week’s episode of Murenase:
The teacher: Who knows what a beluga is?
AMATEURS
Himuro should be higher
You mean Barasu

I am #teamram
Not even kidding
She’s one of the best characters
I wanted them to show more of Chloe!
Ranka is kind of forgotten sometimes by the author
Idk if in reverse harems the same happens
And considering in harems tje focus seems to be the girls
And Jojo
*Shonen*
And DBZ
And Naruto
And MHA
Except in Jojo
Females in anime > males in anime
And Asirpa is?
And why was she more influential and important than Zero Two?
Who tf is Asirpa?
Considering who was nominated
But not even a nomination
Tbh Mai blows her out of the water in every way
I don’t get all the fuzz about zero two either
It’s literally Mai and 5 other girls nobody cared about
No Zero Two, no Violet Evergarden, no Rikka Takarada
What were Crunchyroll smoking in 2018?
I just realized this but
I’m mostly talking about the rest
Anzu is a good choice
Saki is
Lily isn’t even the best girl in zombie land saga
Spot the casual
yes it was
and expected... the show
watched the first ep of bunny girl senpai
NOBODY
they're not
you don't expect deep story or likable characters
demon lord, hotd and dxd you go specifically for lewd
How not to summon a demon lord
because that's a show that you go FOR lewd
i sometimes forget symphogear has senki seishou at the beginning
tbh
there's an episode where a monster appears that can disolve clothes
i've seen way lewder
meh
I couldn't become a hero so I reluctantly decided to get a job
my fav title for any anime is:
kono subarashi sekai something
i never refer to nanatsu no taizai as seven deadly sins
some names are easier to me to remember in jp
they all have jp names i think
i am getting drstroyed
correct
sometimes is Mrs Dess
sometimes it's the US army girl
but it switches from time to time between Chris and Kirika
and at that time I was certain Chris was my #1 girl
i had to choose only one SG girl
because I decided to do only one waifu per anime
and also
she's great
so Nao Tomori is not added
i made it before watching charlotte
it's not updated
i made a my top 10 waifus
not so long ago
i remembered
*in my pants*
i like kurousagi the most tho
more than kirito sure
kinda
hmmm
he's like a blonde kirito
because rn
i want to see that
god
and animate the ending
to pick up the world god only knows
anyone
is to someone
what I want
it made me cry hard
Cause the movie is as good as the Kaede arc
did you like Bunny Girl Senpai?
but
not to spoil anything
not even 12
only 10 eps
the worst part is
i just finished watching it!
it's my fav anime of all time
and now i want a bunny girl to stomp in me and sandwich my face with her legs
until i watched bunny girl senpai
with normal fetishes
i used to be a normal guy
quite literally
but he would destroy you in bed
i think Maria would be the best wife
to be completely honest
i don't think they are straight tbh
i would've included Rio Futaba too
if i added more girls per franchise
and the other half Gears <:KirikaSmug:607742561414676517>
*100 POINTS*
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
in terms of comedy
Nichijou > Konosuba
unpopular opinion
and everybody forgets she exist
Also she dies
Me: my waifu can turn invisible! And never turn visible again!
Guy 1: My waifu is Zero Two, she can pilot a giant robot!
Guy 2: My waifu is hestia! She is a goddess!!
Guy 3: My waifu is Kurimi! You are already dead.
Imagine if your main waifus all fought with each other!
he was the first big bad guy I admired big time
madara is there mostly cause of nostalgia
i will admit
to #3 or 4
kazuma went WAAAAAAAAAAY up
and since I watched the konosuba movie
but since I made it
found my top 10 males too

6 is Strongheim from Jojo part 2
BBBBBBBAKA MONO GA!!!!
because technically she's a videogame character first
i didn't know if I should add Makoto
she's sexy af
<:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
Evil magician Lieselotte Sherlocke
since I made it kirika replaced Chris and ranked up to 5th, tsugumi went to 4th and Utaha got down to 6th

found the list
wait
oh
an anime that has no magic, no supernatural stuff, no crazy hairstyles
what is the most 'normal' anime?
but imagine we irl had magic
yes, imagine that show
i meant fantasy
sorry
would it be considered sci-fi?
and there was a show about a normal life without magic
if magic existed
I always wondered
~~*I already know how it ends*~~
And Your lie in april
It seems very fun so far
(I have only seen the first 2 eps of each)
I will marathon an anime today, Your Lie in April or Steins Gate? Which would you choose?
how would you name it?
If "Another" had a sequel
Me: Hatzune, Nakano or Kohinata?
Other person: I love Miku!
(I mean the second season)
My fav OP is the one of Nisekoi:
Ah I see you are a man of Mai-san as well
I don’t like bunny girl senpai’s op that much
Nah
Aww
?
Best anime op
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
and the last song was Keijo!!!!!
i was tying in the last song
i kept playing the anime songs quiz game
without the ptsd
like hibiki
happy go lucky?
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
cause japanese schools force kids to dye it black again
it would still not be normal
and if they were hair dyes
unless those are hair dyes...
and Ami
Toradora has Minori
<:TsubasaSmug:585839805737467920>
and she has purple hair there too
where they show that girl as a little kid
Ithink there's a scene
they just HAD to add a girl with purple hair
Saekano is almost normal
Captain Tsubasa is bs too
i haven't seen it yet
Kuroko definetely is not normal
I mean
Ahiru no sora?
maybe Free or some other sports anime?
me neither
K On could happen irl
K-On
maybe some thing like
And the school doesn’t seem to care
Marika never switches uniforms from her past school
I just realized this but the school in Nisekoi is a little too lenient with the uniform regulations

The doctor: An image can’t cure depression.
Me an intellectual:
in the middle
there's a white square
no

mid 1999
1999
lemme double check
yeah the drawings aged awfuly
i watch some bits on YT every now and then
you're right
yeah sorry Ikki
behind Victor
because at the start of S2 they clearly stated that he was the #2 best Medabot fighter
even if metabee never lost
at the end if I remember correctly Niki was declared as loser of that match
and refused to die
metabee received like 5 attacks while being on 1 HP
Metabee vs Warbandit
I remember very clearly the last fight
yeah I don't remember much of S2 either
he did sometimes

he turned into a car
that's cool
Season 2
Season 1
where something called the Killabots appeared
there was a second season
from the Killabots season
the metabee is from the second season right?
Nice
It was a nightmare to build

I got Arcbeetle
Oh you got Rokusho? I wanted it
I had a couple
There were model toys with interchangeable parts
i've never seen fate
that's me when in my anime server they start talking about fate
for liking both anime and sports
I d know I am the weird one
oh don't worry
but when it's something so close to me like football, idk it takes more time to me to get into the bs
this server is about powersuits that work on singing
i can accept anime bullshit
i mean
that's like 3 reds

when I said elbowing I meant this
but just left him on a warning!
he saw it, that's why he called the foul
And I'm like: What do you mean foul you stupid fucking ref!!! That's a red card!
FOUL!
and the ref is like
i remember this one ep where a defender just elbowed oliver in the face
exactly
i don't think there was a single yellow card in all of captain tsubasa
and it doesn't feel right
then you see a bunch of anime bullshit thrown in
you like the sport
it might happen to you what captain tsubasa did for me
but againt
it gets good
haven't watched haykyu yet
i like kuroko
you have to be in the mood to watch them
there's a new one called ahiru no sora
called Area no kishi
actually there's one show that kinda follows it a lot
hahahah
that was a foul! how was that not offside! where is the ref? red card! wtf! you can't jump on top of the goal that's illegal!
watching captain tsubasa with me is me yelling:
but I hate football anime
I love football and I love anime
funny thing
i haven't watched that one actually
maybe because football
here in mexico it's very big
but everyone was like, wtf I don't know this show
everyone knows that song
and I was like, oh free one
Dragon Screamer came
last time I played the OP quiz game
i thought the whole world loved that show
I had no idea Captain Tsubasa was a mid known show at best
cause we got some weird shows dubbed here
i have no idea how they choose to dub shows in spanish here
if anything it's nostalgic
Elected when?
And sometimes she makes me a bit uncomfortable
Sometimes
She’s funny
...enthusiastic
She is
Yup
here i guess
yup
there's a girl that when she eats chocolate she starts kissing everyone
they do them to themselves tbh
sorry siscon
but she wasn't shown
her being a lolicon is stated since ep 1
ah no
her sister just appeared in the ep I saw last

i love akarin

i hope
but yuru yuri will fix me
Your lie in april will break me
that's why i am watching both
i am ready
i know how it ends
oh yeah I'm also watching Yuru Yuri and Your Lie in April
might as well
Toaru refers to Index, Railgun and Accelerator
Toaru is index
haha
end me already
Toaru is technically 7 seasons
Steins Gate, Assassination Classroom, Toaru, Hunter Hunter and Date A Live
first I need to finish...
i will watch madoka eventually
I know it only looks cutesy
i do know the general gist of madoka tho
i have madoka on my queue
i didn't know that
oh i see
but couldn't get passed ep 2
i tried with zero

I bought a MF Beyblade
Why do I not remember this?
Wtf
There’s no sound
Nope I can’t play through my phone
I’ll go there and use my phone tho
Already entering
And decided not to have one ever again
He lost his original one
OH SHIT I FORGOT ABOUT THE PRROT
He was a rogue medabot
Which was supposed to be the weakest of them all
There was a dog with a monkey medal
Kinda
Metabee wasn’t even close to beating him
Victor was crazy strong
And Victor
No shit people didn’t like S2
I didn’t know that!
He wasn’t there?!
And suddenly new robots appear that can’t be damaged by medabots at all not even by the Medaforce?
Ikki and Metabee are the world’s second best
Yeah S2 was kinda garbage
I actually enjoyed Yuragi-sou Yuuna-san more than I probably should’ve
I do
Would you recommend to love ru instead?
Nope
Why would she be electrocuted?
Oh, no
I am happy so far
My little collection
Even if he is by far the weakest
Gentle is to many one of the better villains in MHA
Hahahahahah she actually spoiled medabots

It’s beautiful



Shirabe loves football anime
Seishirou Tsugumi from Nisekoi
Yup
There is an anime convention going on my city
Should we take this to <#336310266654490624> ?
You poor little being
HA HA HA
I guess it was the dog girl one

And the... dog girl? One
The one that comes out in July
Yes
Which kirika figure?
Hell even in ebay
Amiami
One day
<:MariaNo:672658725986762764>
...that never got a figure because...
There’s also a xdu tsubasa bunny girl image
I prefer her on red
Yeah she’s more embarrassed than anything
Oh! I didn’t know about the white one
She’s on red, pink and black right?
Nice
Because that’s the color I think of when I think Chris
I guess I’d prefer her on red
Hmm anyone really
I am waiting to see if a Chris bunny girl figure pops up
And of course because I love Symphogear and bunny girls
Thanks
It hardly counts as a collection
I only own those 4
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
And make you into IDOLS!
Im gonna revive you
I know!
What are we gonna do with them?
Now we have two corpses
Oh nice
Yep thanks!<:TsubasaSmug:585839805737467920>
Thanks anyway
If I had to get one figure of Kirika I prefer the one that will be launched in July
Brain off anime is great
So of course I am a bit biased
Also my favorite anime of all time came in 2018
But I do think this season started without a big anime
Yeah that’s true
2020 started mediocre
2018 was an amazing year for anime
But it was fun
I saw it expecting me to hate it
I admit
Hopefully
But it needed a but more character development for the other girls
I liked it
Is that how Zombieland Saga came to be?!
Is there something you like to tell us?
Shirabe
> I buy these two corpses
@Shirabe.exe#2409
Don’t count on it
It was hilarious
And lands on her paws
So Jin just throws her off the cliff
Where in the sports festival they have an event where you had to scale down a mountain
She had a scene written off the anime in the manga
Specially in the anime
They underutilize her
90% of the time I forget she’s even there
Hitomi is just forgettable
But she also has some good scenes
Ranka can be annoying
Mm
*Female*
Hitomi literally has 1 personality trait
Hitomi
The author gets waaaay too invested in mating methods for animals
I liked seton enough to read the whole manga
I don’t know what to say
<@!238855496797257729> Panda best girl
Arata
Not dense protagonist?!
Trinity seven has a...
Hahaha
Trinity Seven
I was just about to say
One of my biggest guilty pleasure is a stupid harem show
I do like stupid harems shows tho
Hmm
I haven’t seen infinite stratos
Does that outfit also has the ability to *almost* show panties but never do?
I’ve seen that pic before don’t worry
Kurousagi ❤️
I love that op
But just 10 eps <:TsubasaIgnite:672861877407318047>
Which I liked a lot
Mondaiji Tachi
I saw an old isekai this year
Darling
Along with the Kaede arc
The movie is the best part imo
Specially the movie
I loved that show
Bunny girl senpai
Speaking of hate session
But I prefered it over S2
S3 of overlord was kinda meh
Then immediately dropped it
I only watched one ep of Classroom of the elite
Maybe I was a bit unfair
I’ve dropped a show after 1 ep
I also got really uncomfortable with Wataten
I couldn’t get passed ep 5
God I hate that show
For me it’s Gamers!
What’s the anime you’ve hated the most?
Hey, was the sun always black?
Was when arata was like
But what gave me chills about TS
That op is great
~~ichika best girl, hahahhhahha ok no~~
The manga really doesn’t like Itsuki
For me I was Nino > Miku > Yotsuba > Ichika > Itsuki
She’s not the worst imo
She’s ok
I meean I liked her fine
She was the only one that none of us liked
She didn’t
Me and my 4 friends were all different teams in quints
And it even led to my first waifu wars with friends
It definetely got me interested
The anime of quints is good
Oh
Even the ending of the manga?
Isekai quintuplet
Quints made Bokuben look like a masterpiece
It’s the clearest example of rushed ending i have ever seen
The ending sucks
I love how no one is excited about Quints S2 anymore
I like the second one tho
I also hate S1 danmachi’s op with a passion
~~cause it’s boring af~~
Don’t @ me
Danmachi is overrated
Because I’m starting to get really tired
Is anyone enjoying the latest chapters of Kanojo Okarishimasu?
i had a good time
it was fun
me too
solid 7/10
it had some cool scenes
yeah
when he teaches the class about  syllables in enchantments that was really cool
the magic *punch*
but yeah there are some memorable scenes
those are... out there
considering *the uniforms*
but it's not as much as you'd think
there's definetely fan servirce
like trinity seven
I thought it was gonna be all over the place
i actually expected MORE fanservice
if they don't get too intense
but i've come to accept them
ah yes that also
I am like NOOOOOOO!!!
but everytime they are like, ok plot time
the main 4 are fun to watch
and sistine is fun to watch her interactions with glenn
re=l (the blue haired one) had the only deep story
I guess I liked it... but more so I liked the interactions between characters, the story was never there
but the story is without a doubt one of the most generic and boring I have ever seen, it never throws curve balls or surprises
The characters are actually likable and memorable (the main ones at least)
Putting the designs on the side (which is harder to do that it sounds)
Tbh I don't know how to rate this series

No prob
Konosuba: Legend of Crimson comes March 25th to Crunchyroll
Good night Cypher
<:CarolSmug:617040484111745027>
Mai Sakurajima, Nao Tomori and Akari Akaza
A pic of 3 of my favorite waifus

<:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
+ Citrus
Kill la Kill + Power Rangers + Idol shows = Symphogear
Pls don’t steal
These are my fully original characters
I’ll do the same then
<:HibikiScreech:633468460030230548>


Wawawawait
Wait
Wait
I too know how it ends
your lie in april sadly *Pun intended*
a lot of people are recommending me monogatari
since bunny girl senpai is my favorite anime of all time
i might end up watching two at the same time
Your lie in april, Date a live, To Love Ru, Toaru, Assassination Classroom, Monogatari
Which anime would you recommend? I am between these 6

“The octopus is even grading our tests while moving at Mach 20”
I’m loving it
It’s 100% my type of humor
I was right to choose Assassination Classroom
10/10 easy
i finished the first season of Assassination Classroom
From Assassination Classroom
It was Koro-sensei
Naaaah I’m just messing with you <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
It doesn’t matter if the water is clear or dirty, every fish can grow beautiful if it keeps swimming forward.
-Confucius
And I just saw this
I am catching up with the manga rn
<:KirikaCheer:689614085402525830>
I don’t need to know japanese to know what that means
I read 2020-10 and TV

Oh god, I thought Komi-san anime was announced

Me after every year:
*Time gives you experience and makes you wiser*
I just want to give Gungnir to Kanade Tachibana from Angel Beats to see what happens
the wielders of Gungnir in Symphogear are "Kanade" and as Tsubasa calls her "Tachibana"
I wonder
i remember every single episode every plot threat, every character from the class, the world building was great
i am in episode 21
Your lie or Assassination?
like Your lie in april <:MariaWhat:672245553920344080>
so i'll watch something to not cry
I know I am gonna cry a lot
after this
in 2 episodes
to happy again
to I wanna murder koro-sensei
Happy
she goes from
i think that could've been longer
but... only 2 episodes for her whole backstory?
i like kaede too
I'd finish
if i had no homework
yes I am
episode 21 of Season 2
> There is also that girl with green hair
<@!203444794737950720> kayano
Tsundere Sniper it is!
...huh...

I guess there's no one who will...
Bitch sensei is cool and all but she isn't best girl just quite. Kayano was wasted potential
Assassination Classroom is cool and all, but it needs a best girl.
and 22 S1
and I'm almost crying
i will wait a bit for another harem
i just finished dal
i'll go for toaru first
you know what?
which one should i watch first? to love ru or toaru?
I am finished with assassination classroom, your lie in apri and date a live
i am halfway through my dreaded 6
Jsut because I enjoy waaay to much OP’s that are like a mini episode
OP I will love
So I will call this a good move
and it took me 2 days to reach ep 17 of Steins Gate
It took me also a month to reach ep 5 of Toaru
in my queue
I switched Toaru with Steins Gate
Hmm I will give it a shot
Is “little witch academia” good?
it's really hard to take Khun seriously when you like football
but the first 2 eps are very ecchi
and yes the show tones down
now tbh i watched up to ep 10 since i made that comment
truly Kanade Suzutsuki is a different beast all together
but i've never seen ecchi as... **ECCHI** as in Mayo Chiki
Magical Senpai, Nande Koko ni sensei ga, monster musume, yuragi-sou no yuuna-san, trinity seven
I've seen ecchi
Kaguya-Osama: Love is War
I'll start
Add, remove or change 1 letter of an anime to ruin it
"I came here because you love catgirls more than anyone!"
but imagine this happening to you
Ok this anime's concept is fun and all
<:ShirabeAwe:698939825113268306>
she just really enjoys karaoke
hhahaha it turns out she didn't need to sing all this time
Shirabe's gear is actually a Tail Gear?!
does that mean that
wait...
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Also the battle suit is called Tail Gear
Waaay ahead of you

it's the main reason I love Teekyu so much
I like insanity in anime
which I like
it usually means insane anime
but if it has a low score
i know
I could either love or hate this anime
which doesn't answer anything to me
again it has a 6.6 on MAL
it sounds like the worst and best anime of all time
It's called Ore, Twintail ni Narimasu
I just found the anime with possibly the worst and also best sinopsis for any anime ever
even thought it's korean
but Tower of God is fair game?
also I can't add avatar the last airbender nor the castlevania anime that was made in america
these are also mcdonalds commercials

when i saw it i immediately bought 10 quarter pounders
10/10

I can also score Interstellar 5555
where do I draw the line?
I added the Shellter music video
If i saw the trailer can I add this to my MAL? hahahah
apparently you can score fake trailers now

no prob, I have other ways
?
is it con CR
what was the name again?
we were done, don't worry haha
no please do
which i'm sure will be the villain
there's also the president
he just *STARES HANDSOMELY*
he hasn't done anything yet tho
yeah the brother of the girl with the white hair
nicol
wait
ah no
is he the president?
and give me some space vibes
get off my face vibes
but he gives me some...
Keith is nice
but he's fun
i don't really like his design
haha he's called Alan btw
Piano boy is fun
Geordo can die in a fire for all i care
and we are all straight
believe it or not it is sparking in some of my anime circle of friends discussions about Best boy
i am really enjoying it
i want to see it as it comes out in the anime
pls don't spoil me
i mean yeah I guess it's not really reverse because she has both sides of love interests
because it is a good show
where i am in fact enjoying the male love interests
with my next life as a villainess it took me 2 episodes to realize i was watching a reverse harem show
because it does feel like in shows like yuru yuri and citrus they feel the need to make every single character gay
i'd like to see gay couples in regular anime
as i said in the other channel
Just gear, i haven't watched madoka yet, twintails and kill la kill
it's such an obscure show
because i can't imagine starting your fandom with symphogear
i just said what i said
it's a great show
at least you got to it eventuallu
Spoilers for Naruto shippiden: Like for example ||how Tobi was Obito, or how Kakashi would be hokage before Naruto||
we did predict a couple of things that ended up happening
it's fun
with naruto, i went online, talked with friends, discussed, theorized
but i never was like: oh i need to discuss about it with everyone!
because yeah i watched the og beyblade when i was young
"This show is great! I want to learn more about it!"
i mostly meant the first anime you were like:
original yugioh?
She's all like: "Do you really think your speed will increase by just removing some measly ankle weights?"
this one for example
https://tenor.com/view/rock-lee-anime-naruto-take-off-weights-gif-12719553
there are some moments of the show I still scream like a fangirl
cause that's the anime i grew up with
i love watching naruto fights on youtube
something similar happens to me
one day i'll watch doraemon
nice
but i mean the first anime you ever became a fan of
that can be
~~don't say symphogear, nobody will believe you~~
what was the anime where you start being an anime fan?
Bakarina*
you didnd't like it?
i've just heard of kampfer
i haven't seen any of those
the ova for bokutachi came out already?
it's meant to be for laughs i'm sure, but it comes out uncomfortable
but chinatsu... assaults her in one point
but she's the only character that's not seen having romantic feelings for another girl
she loves her friends
the main character (Akari) is very clearly not homosexual
with a character named chinatsu (the pink haired one)
but it can get a tiny bit uncomfortable at times
that's why it's written like this: yuri **Y U R I**
yuru yuri is 100% yuri
it's just cute girls do cute things
harukana receive i don't think it's meant to be yuri
specially the last episode
i hated that show tbh
if you really want yuri you can watch yuru yuri
the last match between harukana and eclair was amazing tho
harukana is not yuri tbh
specially because haruka and kanata are cousins haha
ah yes definetely
but a girl actually confesses to another girl
kinda subtext
ms vampire too
asteroid in love is definetely yuri
~~keijo is the best anime ever tho~~


Shamiko is a machine of gifs


Specially because the mc is the best thing ever
Machikado is fun





i'll start
and ask the people you haven't watched it to try to make a sinopsis for it
you send 5 random pics from an obscure anime you've seen
i thought about a fun game to play
At all
But tbh, it’s not good
Another very gay show is Sakura’s trick
and everybody is like
then only i respond to a song
like we'll be playing anime music quiz
in case i could offend somebody
i won't say the rest of that phrase
hello pot, I'm cattle
tell me about it
or Anyatsu
even they call it assclass
i'm in the discord server
nah
I saw all assclass (obviously)
i'd just get a kaguya figure from DAL
have you ever gotten or at least really wanted a figure of a character from a show you have never watched?
<:TsubasaSmug:585839805737467920>
Tekyuu is... an experience
Tekyuu is not an anime
(Tekyuu btw)
one of my favorite stupid anime of all time doesn't even have one review on youtube in english <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
even if you don't know the name of every student in assclass, you at least know all of them by face
of course it's an amazing show with very well written characters
that's why I specified "popular"
he literally said "I feel I watch a show nobody knows about (refering to assclass)"
colourstar
that second part wasn't needed I just wanted to add it
as a guy who has a koro-sensei pfp i can tell you: "AssClass is very popular, even some normies watch it, and it's my second favorite anime of all time"
at least some
i think we're all into some obscure shows
yeah we're in a server from a show which international released game lasted 3 months
Botan, best girl
it's great
WTF IS ANNE HAPPY?!
i don't mind those
i'd give strike witches a try but... the sinopsis doesn't make it look very promising
you just mentioned the anime i was talking about when i said "i want a figure of an anime I haven't seen" <@!220063850316169217>
but stupid in the best of ways
it's one of the most stupid anime i have ever seen
I laughed a lot tbh
Keijo is what happens when you give your perverted writer full creative freedom
(but the internet did)
(my friends didn't hate it)
Keijo
So precious

of course she is
yeh
I couldn't become a hero so I reluctantly decided to get a job
For example:
you need an anime that has a title the size of a paragraph
if you really want obscure
it also has 2 spinoffs
but you can binge watch the whole series in a day
yeah more or less 130
it doesn't give you even a second to rest
and in those 2 minutes it goes at 500 km/h
every episode lasts 2 minutes
Drug inducing
some people would argue gear is yuri bait
in my opinion
you shouldn't put a show off because it does or doesn't have yuri
i mean
i immediately put it on
when i read the sinopsis for twintails
i sometimes go with sinopsis
~~Jojo is anime too~~
When i hear the title "the with hunter" the last thing I expected was waifus
0/10
If it's set in Mexico, why is the sky blue and not sepia yellow?
https://tenor.com/view/speedy-gonzales-gif-7531016
Title in spanish because arriba arriba andale andale ajua
oh...
why is the title in spanish?
those look like adult swim characters
<@!457268466429329429> if you want a good beginner anime for your friends, Death Note is usually a good place to start
because that lynette bishop's figure is the best thing ever
i'll give it a try eventually i'm sure
i've dealt with fanservice shows before
the only heterosexual thing in gear is Tiki
(Gear is yuri, there's no debate)
specially for Reina's character
nah, romance is important in hibike
if it's a selling point and then it doesn't deliver you have a right to be mad
and the other one has octopus hair
but one of the yuri baits has a crush on her male teacher so...
i also see a lot of people saying they don't like hibiki euphonium because of the yuri bait
~~Season 2 never~~ <:SakutaSmug:655558829852983299>
||for BGS they don't kiss at all||
they juist don't show it
I think they kiss
for hibiki and miku
THAT ONE HURT, A LOT
but it's ok! Spoilers for Bunny girl senpai: ||It's not like there's another show that also didn't deliver on a final chapter kiss when the fandom wanted it so badly HEY WAIT A MINUTE!!!||
but since it's original...
so then the animators would have no choice
and in there they kissed
it would've been better if gear had a source materia
it's all marketing
except to keep selling biki figures
there was no reason not to
they've already shown a gay kiss in the anime
it is so they can keep marketing biki
they should've tbh
yeah i know it's VEEEEEEEEEEEERY unlikely
some people would argue they could just be friends
yeah but until they say "we're dating now"
Trinity Seven ❤️
one of my favorite shows of all time is a trashy show
i love trashy shows
^
but it is strike as in a work strike
which is also strike witches
to Huelga de Brujas
so it translated Strike Witches
ebay automatically translates the article names
hahahahhahahah
true
or i could pay 20 dollars more on ebay to get it new
i found it at that price preowned at amiami
1/8
no wait you're right
lemme double check
i think it's 1/6
Did I stutter? <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
it's roughly 70 dollars
Should I buy? And if yes, should I watch Strike Witches?
I think it's heavily implied
it has 2 heterosexual things
also genjurou being in love with Ryouko
~~maybe that's why the fandom hates her~~
Chuck Norris has counted to infinity twice
Chuck Norris once killed to stones with one bird
That time i got isekaid to another world **AS** a truck
what about
My life in a nutshell

How does Interstellar 5555 still hold up?
yeah but I didn't differenciated it as the title name
you just made my plan to watch longer
thanks
which anime it is?
I think I’ve seen the pink haired girl before
Bakarina is in a platonic relationship with not dying

The perfect harem protagonist doesn’t exis-
God I forgot what a fantastic song “something about us” was
Animationwise
I thought of hidive ~~since that's my only other option~~
haha
yeah the other option is just stream illegaly
Is Hidive a good option?
Here in Mexico we have very limited options
I want to get a secondary anime streaming service
https://youtu.be/AzbIe1lo-yU
i was right!
no yes
the one where a demon lord Arata from another demension attacked
is that the same movie?
no wait
and another one where a Arata from a different dimmension...
and Lilith is kidnapped
one where arata and Lilith and Arata had a kid
no it was definetely 2
was is one or two?
no wait
yup
both movies
again
if i want a harem battleschool anime i just watch trinity seven
not... very... appealing
the sinopsis they gave me was...
i havent watched that
i'm not even joking, he's amazing haha
where the mc outstages all of the girls
that's the only harem i know
unless you're watching god only knows
you watch them for the love interests
you don't really watch harems for the mc's tbh
again... regular harem protag
i don't think it's really fair
it's like hating prince zuko because half his face is burned
it's not there because she wants too
haha it's just a scar
but the difference is that this time it's a girl
but when you get down to it, it's a pretty regular harem protagonist
she's fun to watch
I like Catarina
woops i just realized i had them backwards
The first season of this show is **A W F U L**

This is mine
What's your biggest anime unpopular opinion?
I absolutely love Gear Maria’s voice, she has my favorite voice
Hahaha
Not gear Maria
I mean Villainess Maria
Oh
I don’t like Maria’s voice at all
have a nice meal
go on
haha
the principal
biblia
yeah that's who i meant
as strong as a demon lord?
isn't biblia like
that's my problem with yui
she doesn't do much in the anime
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
arata and lilith have unprotected hand holding and make a baby
the first movie is definetely better
just a heads up
yeah
according to this 2019
like it needs to be
dead center of the harem
Liese
hahaha
also i just spoiled the main villain of the movie

both are on CR
Trinity Seven Movie 2: Heaven's Library to Crimson Lord
there are two movies
well slice of life stuff can be interesting
but the anime had to stop
i guess the plot was about to kick in
it is definitely character driven
not a lot happens
yeah the problem with the show imo is that it is a bit uneventfull
this part was cute tbh
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QIJ4dUPuBz8
not true
she's the main reason I love Hatoko as much as i do
also Yumeko from kakegurui and Haqua from god only knows
I just learned she also plays Emi from Your lie in april
I can imagine the people recording it stood up and starting bowing to her
but i recommend watching the whole thing
Here is the scene in case you want to see it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHd3xfDzTg8
but the rest is great too
that scene is easily the best part of the whole thing
It is rather good tbh

one of the best scenes I have seen in any anime
yup
it's fun
However soon they find that they are not the only people with special abilities
A group of friends suddenly receive superpowers, but they soon realize there is no crisis, or enemies to fight, so they mostly use their powers to fuck around
she's from a Trigger anime called "When Supernatural battles become commonplace" or "Inou battle wa Nichijou"
And so I decided to spam her a bit
Today I got reminded of best girl Hatoko

But he’s the least interesting Jojo out of the bunch
He’s fine
I mean
Hmm
Jojo?
Which makes it the worse to think she was in love with one of the worst mc’s i’ve ever seen
That I accept was good
But Karen is the one thing
I hate Gamers! with a passion
Karen Tendou
In case you were wondering about a character i like from a show I hate
Oh
Even if she was overpowered a couple of times
I liked Asuka’s power
I’ll admit i haven’t read the LN
At least in the anime she did not show off her powers that much
The character You
You as in
That’s You
Nah
Clocktower
They blew out a blocktower
But never quite
You can almost see her panties
In general
I’ve had kurousagi for like 1 week
I switch it every 2 weeks or so
I’ve liked characters from shows I dropped
Hmm
Tell me a character you like from an anime you hate
God
But I know you don’t mean log
I don’t know the show
I mean
Haha i know
Noragami?
**D A T A B A S E**
The best she did was not die to the ice monster
In fact, in every single fight she has gone down in a couple of hits
And hasn’t defeated a single foe
She’s been saved like 7 times in 3 episodes
Cecily
Nah
You have done **NOTHING**
Hmm no, you’re right
You have...
Nooo that’s not true! you have...
And I’m like
I haven’t accomplished anything
I can’t do anything
The main girl is like
So I won’t care of spoilers
The show is not good
Meh
I guess that was a spoiler but mej
I am not ashamed
Which is the one thing that’s making me continue tbh
Except for uncensored boobs
You are not getting anything new
If you’ve watched other fantasy shows
Yeah
Fantasy show
Yeah
Hahha
It is not that good
I am currently seeing the sacred blacksmith
What about the anime fate/stay night?
Which the fans liked more
Yeah but the game has a different ending
For the real ending
Then jump into the game
Where you watch the anime until ep 24
I will treat it as toradora
<:ShirabeSob:701475635025019000>
But i will put it on the late side of my queue
I might give it another tru
Some tell me Zero, others tell me vn others Fate Stay Night
Every person tells me something different
Idk where to start tho
Size is the reason I’ll never watch fate
I think I have to update a couple of my MAL ratings
It was from a seasonal anime vid
But it wasn’t the fate vid
I can’t remember the exact cid
It wasn’t in the fate video
Then I saw it was real...
When I heared there was a cooking fate I thought gigguk was just joking haha
I am already in the worst fandom possible
I am a football fan...
So I never judge a work because of it’s fandom
Every fandom can be annoying if it’s big enough
I’ll get to that when I get to that
You know what?
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
I sometimes skip part 1 on rewatches ngl
But part 2 is amazing
Part 1 isn’t that bad
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Exactly
And ends part 1
After it moves to Part 2
Jojo gets good at ep 10
I just said it because
Haha no
Sounds like Jojo
Ah so Jojo then
From the trailers durarara looks fun
These are the animes I will see next
• Akame ga Kill
• Amagi Brilliant Park
• Durarara!!
• Girls und Panzer
• Is the order a rabbit?
• K-on
• Little Witch Academia
• Log Horizon
• Madoka Magica
• Noragami
• Sakura-sou ni pet na Kanojo
• Strike Witches
Pun intended
It is bery stupid
So far it hasn’t dissapointed there
Renai boukun seemed like very stupid fun
Said the Hunter x hunter fanbase
I’m sure I’ll give it a 6/10 or a 7/10 at most
It is kinda bad
~~Don’t look at my gear ratings~~
If anyone wants to judge my shit taste
This is my list
https://myanimelist.net/animelist/CarlosGLara13?status=1
It droped faster than the value of the mexican peso
Happen
*that*
As soon as
When I saw that I was glued to the tv
The whole plan Light conducts midway
The second half can burn in hell
I’m sorry, the first half is just too good
I rated death note a 9/10
That was the only anime i dropped in ep 1
Except Classroom of the elite
I always give the shows 2-3 eps to see if they grab me
I see
So it doesn’t have 1 main character?
I am reading you Solo
Because it was also featured on a dead or alive game
I thought it was a real thing
Yeah, that’s why it ended with them graduating
**SPLAAAAASH IN MY PEE**
How tf did it fail?!
Making merchandise for keijo should be as easy as signing the pay check
Renai Boukun is one of them
There are a lot of shows that work best with brain turned off
I do prefer Keijo
For shit show trash anime that’s very enjoyable
Oh sorry
That crams like 200 jokes in those 2 minutes
Tekyuu is a 2 minute show
Tekyuu is a masterpiece
You mispelled Keijo
But the quality is definetely there
Yeah taste is subjective
I said one of the best
That IS one of the great ones
Yeah I agree
When people say, FMAB is one the best
But it is a very interesting story
I don’t think it’s one of the best
Steins gate so far is very good
It definetely helped the platform
So that people would watch it more
I am sure crunchyroll told him to shit on sao
Talk to you tomorrow
I will sleep now
<:DONE:602895899022065674>
I also need to finish the anime i have on hold
Cause the author can give them personalities
They are usually more developed than the main ones
I do like me some side characters
~~no, just jojo~~
But people told me it gets better
It got me bored
I watched the first 5 episodes
<:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
Oh yeah I am also going to watch to love ru
And on the next episode, more SOL funny stuff
I can’t think of many animes that had an episode like ep 7 of Charlotte
But it is a roller coaster of emotions
Charlotte ending was rushed yes
Bunny girl senpai made me cry hard
It was rushed tbh
I found my list
I thought you were talking about nekopara haha
“I like big boobs and small boobs. I like all boobs as long as they are attached to a cute girl”
I wish more harem mc’s were at least half as chad as him
Arata is great haha
Actually the thing I liked about trinity seven was Arata
And I stand by that choice
In my top 10 fav anime I put Trinity Seven haha
I know my taste is shit
I am the complete opposite haha
I never gave bakemonogatari a rating
I just realized
Alright*
And I forgot about it
I just watched ep 1
I never cared for SAO
Cya
Ok now is sleep time
<:ShiraBean:661294258795446326>
But a very enjoyable one
Yup
Hahah
It makes absolutely no difference
You can definitely watch Nichijou in random clips
<@202444817043685386>
To be perfectly honest
Oh and
Bgs was Fall 18
Sheild was Winter 19
It was literally the next season
Specially because it came just as bgs ended
It feels kinda weird to have Sakuta be the mc in a power isekai
Both
I know
Ah yes
Yes I have
~~basically~~
Both in games and in real life
He is the god of conquest
Again, the main reason for it is the mc
<@202444817043685386> god only knows is my fav harem by far
Yeah a 24 episode run would’ve made it better
I wonder what the inspiration for that was
So Brave Witches takes place in a place called Petersburg in Orusia
and eclair are sisters
they are cousins tho
but people are making it out to be like S1-4 are Cinderella Fucking Nine while XV is FMAB
it is better
I don't think XV is that much better than the first 4 seasons tbh
i guess some people enjoyed it unironically
Interspieces Reviewers btw
it barely makes it into the top 1000 anime of all time on MAL
7.74
no wait
i think it is on 7.2 rn
oh it got fixed
NO VRV! YOU WATCH KEIJO!
I would be like
because VRV is implying I have not seen it yet 20 times
I would be too
**USUALLY**
and anything above 8.2 is pretty much great
7.8-8.2 is very good
7.5-7.8 is good
7.2-7.5 is ok
7-7.2 is kinda trashy
6.9 and below is bad
So I learned that usually
most of the shows on MAL are on a range from 7 to 8
it is still trash
and as much as I enjoy Keijo unironically
Keijo has a 7.13
anything below 7 is usually bad on MAL
it's enjoyable at times
you know, for a 6.9 on MAL, I expected Strike Witches (Brave actually, because that's the one on crunchyroll)  to be much worse
<:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
tbh if I saw a wedding ep of hibiki and miku i would buy 3 sexy pillowcases
but the highers ups won't risk it
and i'm sure in japan too
here in the west straight people watch yuri shows
it's more an issue of japanese people still being kinda iffy to the whole lgbt community
bunny girl senpai
my fav anime of all time is a SOL
is not an excuse for being boring
being a SOL
and no
nothing is really happening
but anytime they are not kissing
i mean sure the kiss scenes are nice
just 2 times for me
it's boring
more than trash
And Sakura Trick has a 7.06
one of the girls likes the sister of the protagonist a little bit too much
not much, but a bit
Brave Witches has a bit of Yuri actually
but it is not that much better imo
XV is the best season
yeah but it has a better rating of about like .5
it's amazing
i am just saying when brave witches goes 3d for it's action sequences it kinda looks like honkai impact
yes
brave witches
nah
it looks like honkai impact
when it goes 3d
the anime i am watching rn
no i mean
damn this Honkai Impact 3rd animation budget <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I’ve been meaning to watch that
this last arc is kinda amazing
is ending on a pretty great note tbh
a 100% full ecchi, no questions asked, absolutely fanservice manga in this case Yuragi-sou no Yuuna-san
meanwhile...
but the mangaka really wants us to hate the mc
but it started kinda strong
i know it was never an amazing series
rental girlfriend
Should’ve been the name of the series tbh
i'd bet that's where a lot of people dropped jojo
**JESUS**
but the baby part
the dog part, it happens usually
**THAT SCENE IS GLUED TO MY MIND**
**I HAVEN'T FORGIVEN YOU, JOJO**
No mom, I prefer this one about the guy who kills dogs, ruins the life of his brother and then turns into a vampire and forces a mother to eat her baby
watch this show instead about a guy who lost a leg, an arm, and his brother to pretty much god to bring back their zombified dead mother
here! son
**HOW IS MY KID GOING TO WATCH 2 GIRLS KISSING?!?!**
cause in my mind they eventually got together but couldn't include it in the cannon because
it didn't bother me in gear
~~and what's the drawback?~~
half of them are
Lynette Bishop
but i really liked her design
i don't even remember how I stumbled with her
i started watching it cause I really like the design of one of the girls in strike witches
they did mentioned someone by that name
i will finish today and then go to sleep
i am currently in ep 11 of brave
i will watch strike next
i see
isn't there another anime in the franchise tho?
even with the kinda predictable story
it was a very fun time
and I do!
to see if I would like this
i just wanted an introduction
i am sure i will too
i started with brave cause this is the only one on crunchyroll
not yet
so i'll give them that
and this anime is kinda old
i know
the flight scenes are ok
their mouths in cgi are attrocious
oh boy...
but when the show stops and still uses cgi for them talking
when they're flying it isn't that bad
this is what i was refering too when I said this thing had Honkai Impact 3rd animation
it is a good watch
if you can get behind your eyes bleeding every time cgi is used
but for the most part no
and some undertones
some characters
yeah it looks attrocious

i mean
but it's a fun watch
the story is a bit generic yeah
except for the CGI which is abysmal
there's no way in hell this is a 6.84
I'm about to finish Brave Witches
And didn’t **FINNISH**
Maybe they were running out of time
But then they just gave up midway and just left Helsinki as Helsinki
They went through the trouble of changing St. Petersburg, Novingrad and Petrovsk

She learns to fight despite her weakness and they teach her evassion manouvers so that she can get close to the enemy and attack from there
They didn’t try to be like **BUT ACTUALLY SHE HAD THE MOST MAGIC ALL THIS TIME BUT IT WAS HIDDEN!!!**
And they kept it all the way through
(The fact that she has barely magic at all)
I loved the fact that they established Hikari’s weakness pretty early on
hmm apparently not
he dounds like geenjurou
is the general Geenjurou?

and the other two girls are just
Hikari jumps off the train and goes into the woods
lol
they mentioned there were special cases
ah yes
when they become adults they lose it
girls
Hikari of the see, what is your wisdom?
or do I just accept it and shut up?
do they ever explain why they grow ears and tail?
yeah I got that much
I see
or her **HEROIC DEEDS** are just flashbacks?
does Takami appear in Strike Witches?
but i am not wrong
hahaha that sounds wrong
you get used to dog cruelty in jojo
I will start a new series
but
ok i shouldn't do this
what's next? the demon sword of ihop unlimited pancakes?
the demon sword of corrosion...
i mostly like anime where they do something I haven't seen before
probably
and actually use them as swords
it is rare to see anime where they use swords
i liked the fight scenes
yeah at times it is enjoyable
just bored me a little
it didn't insult me
it's... fine
that's this anime least of problems tbj
hahaha
because it has boobs?
she looks like she can grab her whole waist with her hands
That waist does not look healthy at all
Do you want some bread? Some potatoes?
Oh wow Cecily you ok?
which is sad because the actions scenes are not that bad tbh
the story kinda lost me a little bit tbh
i am really struggling to finish sacred blacksmith
WTF HAHAHAHAHHA IS THE RABBIT VOICED BY MF DIO?!
And i’ve watched Hinako Note
It has the moest anime opening i’ve ever heard
Oh wow
I went ahead and also started Gachuumon
**D A T A B A S E**
i really just want tonikaku cawaii not to be pushed back
i already like Akatsuki
<:saaad:591387558617940188>
i hope i finish the anime before s3
why is database listed as op 2 in amq
there's ssomething i don't get tho
and the show is already 500% lifting glasses
it¡s the first episode
and I wanna know what's so special about the **D A T A B A S E**
it feels like the one i was putting off the most
i chose log horizon
hmm
Is the order a rabbit?
Log Horizon
Akame ga Kill!
or Durarara?
help me decide
it has a mahou shoujo ep
I mean
and discuss his live thoughts as he watched ep 10
I got to experience a friend of mine go through Saekano
I don't even know what the question was
tho
they are both a **NO**
i think blood related cousins is more creepy than adopted sisters tbh...
do you really want yuri when you consider they are cousins?
it's like harukana receive
the main couple are sisters
how can it NOT be incesty?
i mean
Just watch it from a free source
You're a Pirate, Harry
Time to watch Bodacious Space Pirates
ep 11 made me cry more

i had to pause the episode
||god, the part where he said: If god would grant me one wish, I'd wish I could be your child again in another time||
||the one with the soldier who wrote a letter to his parents and lover before dying||
this and ep 11 broke me


that is not even an opinion
ah yes
i know a lot of fans didn't like the ending
like
crontroversial in what regard?
hmm
tbh
but I like Charlotte more
I like Angel Beats
hmm
> Yuripee could step on me any day
<@!454822882045067298> ^^^


or Nana from Area No Kishi (I'll send a pic because I know none of you will know about this last one)
Lilith from Trinity Seven
Yurippe from Angel Beats
i am between 3
I had to google her
I didn't know Sawako
no personality involved whatsoever
what is in your opinion the cutest girl in anime, designwise
I am confused, intriged, disgusted ~~and turned on~~ at the same time

https://tenor.com/view/maoy%c5%abma%c5%8dy%c5%absha-demon-king-look-at-me-averted-eyes-not-looking-gif-16528460

the answer is:
do i like the song as much
the question is
i can include it
even if only a couple of eps
but now that i've seen log horizon
because those are reserved for openings of anime i've watched
but i couldn't include it in my top 10 openings of all time
i already liked database
first of all
Imma steal that
**D A T A B A S E**
and don't forget the most important part
and Maoyu is politics
now i undeerstand why people call this **ECONOMICS: THE ANIME**
TIME FOR MORE **D A T A B A S  E ,  D A T A B A S E**

YOU ARE MAKING IT TOO EASY FOR ME
COME THE FUCK ON

<:ShirabeStare:582381430915596289>
Chiaki from Bodocious Space Pirates looks like an older angrier jii
of any anime
My favorite episode of all time
Episode 7
I'm just going to say one thing
without spoiling anything
may I prepare you for something?
they crammed in like 5 episodes into one
that is a fact
That’s almost half the season she took to decide on what she should’ve decided back in episode 2!
5 episodes?! For the first bodacious space pirates arc
Song, visuals, animation
In every eay
But it is an amazing OP
I tried to think on a reason to not put Joujou Yuujou as #1
Cya
Maybe that’s why I am actually not bad
<:AstoSmug:588708219229175809>
Because the second one is usually liked more
THE FIRST NORAGAMI OP?!
Also I thought people were going to be like
When I reached my top 5 it was insanely difficult for me
But I like Voracity and Go Cry Go more
I mean its still great
And yes, actually Clattanoia is my least fav Overlord OP
Rally go round from Nisekoi I like mostly because of the visuals
These are not entirely based on music
It grew on me
And also the dorky dance they do
I like the second op the most 1 because the song rocks of course
In that order
Comedy, harem, **D A T A B A S E**, harem, music, JOJO, Shonen school? I think, shonen, isekai and shonen
<:KirikaShout:607741871703457812>
salt come to me

done
it's definitely my fav hype type op
Joujou Yuujou from Nichijou
Database from Log Horizon
God only Knows from Kami Nomi
Soundscape from Hibike! Euphonium 2
Rally go Round from Nisekoi:
I have:
they are pretty much all #1
but the moment i talk about 1-5
(10-6)
i already have the bottom 5 sorted out
<a:HibikiOraOra:582365734097780746>
i don't know how to order the top 5
i can't haha
and it's way too hard
i am trying to make my top 10 anime op's
The anomalies represent less than .5% and as such could be refered to as noise
She is
I made this very scientific graph
Or Nana Mizuku op’s
I bet it doesn’t even have yuri, mecha, magical girls or songs
A factory machinery that works on songs?
What is that
Symphogear?
Figured
I’ll keep you updated as i watch
If you want a gay show, yamada kun has this literally in the very first ep
I also reached the middle of the first season of Log Horizon
True
Yamada kisses the other dude like twice an episode
It wasn’t really bait <@279341087494242304>

Rak
It's like my other favorite character from Tower of God
they are both princesses and that's it
can't you see the similarities?
But can’t tell the difference between two of the main characters of that show
When you are the company producer of a show

Yes it is
But now I have the pair
The Ram is on the other city

You are acting like killing Danny was the only cruel thing he did
And killed his father
Scar his girlfriend
He makes everyone hate him
He destroys Jonathan’s life
He’s supposed to be an asshole that gets destroyed in every chance he gets
He is not supposed to be sympathetic
He’s an asshole
Again
Dio gets destroyed both in phantom blood and stardust crusaders
He only revives to die again
Dio gets his ass kicked like 5 times!
And every character who does it gets it’s comeupance very quickly
But it’s never portrayed like a good thing
Yes, there is anime cruelty in jojo
Like it’s supposed to be
Iggy dies because of his wounds
Vanilla ice barely does a thing to iggy in the 2013 version
And you probably watched the original version
The dog was trying to kill him tho
Which makes it the more hilarious when you see the localized names that need to get around issues
So you get some very obvious band name drops like Red Hot Chilli Pepper
The villains and stands are named after bands
Yes basically
To me at least
But it’s very enjoyable
It’s a bit dated yes
Again, written in the 80’s
He’s fun
I really enjoy him
Hahaha best Jojo
Jojo vs Kars
Jojo vs Eisidisi
Cesar vs Wamuu
The tactics, the fights, the style
But starting part 2 it gets fantastic
I’ll give you that
Hard to digest
Phantom blood is a bit...
Again
Ah yes I hate that scene too
Of course it’s a bit dated
Tbf it was written in the 80’s
I really like it
And I still liked it
I saw a little girl get her heart ripped off by a vampire in gear
It is a good time tho
If you drop every anime that has a morally wrong character
I mean
<a:TsubasaBroken:663625017191432192>
Don’t @ me
Jojo is great
<:MikuLewd:336656493606862868> <:MikuLewd:336656493606862868> <:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
It’s actually amazing
I loves the last match in harukana receive
I don’t remember having too much comedy tbh
And aren’t just broken ~~unless you’re giorno~~
The new abilities have explanations too
And when they did introduce power creeps in part 4 and 5
Yeah
It tends to do that
I know that jojo turns away a lot of people
Because i know you’ll never do
I won’t recommend you give it another try
I’m sorry you didn’t like it
It’s weird in an enjoyable way
But in my opinion
It’s a weird show
The characters are very enjoyable to many people
The world is enjoyable to many people
If i’m not mistaken is the 2nd most popular in japan
Just like it has humans dying
Yes it has animals dying
It’s wrong
But saying that it isn’t more than pet cruelty
I also don’t like a lot of popular shows
If you don’t like it that’s fine
And people are still enjoying it today
The fact is that is the second most succesful manga ever
But it’s not a fact
I can respect that
That’s your opinion
I mean
You are intrigued to now what style or what stupid thing will happen next
But since the world is wacky
It never is
It’s not meant to be realistic
Cause jojo characters don’t act normal
If you put Jojo characters on a real setting it would look weird
It’s not meant to be realistic
It is a wacky world
Wouldn’t it make more sense to have the world be over the top too?
If the characters are over the top
Why?
He uses the abilities they already have to figure out a way the protagonist would win
And be like; “here is a new attack i suddenly have”
Characters don’t just power up for the next fight
He has things written down
So anything can happen next
It is never planned
In my opinion
That’s why Jojo is enjoyable to me
And when he feels like the story is over, he switches cast
So he can be as over the top as he wants
He has absolytely no restrictions in his work
It’s a fun way to write
And does not have anything planned
He is making the story as he goes along
That’s why the Araki forgot is a popular jojo meme
Pointing out his fuck ups in the story
Fans also enjoy that
He has fun writing the story
But it’s never portrayed like that in Jojo
That’s not right
Of course if it’s portrayed in a good way
Maybe cruel stuff doesn’t bother me as much
But not Dio
If you really want a sympathetic villain, Jojo has them
Again, not sympathetic
And acts like jojo
That looks like nisekoi
It’s bunny girl senpai
I say
I don’t know what to think about monogatari
Part 5 isn’t very comical tbh
I am very spoiled tho haha
I am in the middle of reading SBR
It is a very weird show
Jojo is not for everyone
It is not very common to see a character from a previous part appear in the next
Characters in Jojo switch from generation to generation
Roberto E O Speedwagon
Not just the setting
Yeah the characters in part 6 also feel weak to me
In part 6 we see at most 7 or 8 different rooms
A small town is much bigger than a prison
Wuuu... Adventure I guess
The entirety of part 6 is set on a prison
Jojo’s bizarre **ADVENTURE**
Think sbout it
I mean
I don’t care much for part 6
Hahaha the fans get worked up for the most silly reasons
Jojo part 5 will suck! Giorno’s suit isn’t pink! It’s blue!
Hahaha i heard people saying
Dude you are telling that to the dude that un ironically loves keijo
I love part 5
It didn’t live to the expectations
Cause prt 6 sucks
Why do you think we fans aren’t invested in the part 6 adaotation?
We do expect a lot from jojo
Well not the animation itself
The animation for nisekoi is insane tho
Also a song about staplers as the opening
I swe
Alternate placing
Ah
Kizumonogatari twice?
Wait
People tell me to go emision wise
I am just going to start to watch Nise
I have just watched bake btw
I am also done with the first
 **D A T A B A S E**
Shiroe = Best dad
<a:curryakatsuki:669928905531981855>



Ok time to watch princess connect
I can't understand the love for her one bit
Toga is definetely my most hated character
there is none
including her personality
because all of her is invisible
way more than you can imagine
I love Mai
also
hahaha i didn't include i don't know them for a reason
better



but i did it

it took me 2 hours
I did it
cause there isn't another image that looks like her
i guess that's gamme
is this her?

but i can't find narberal gamma
haha
i actually ranked them all
i finished
i am close to finishing
for example shalltear and albedo
hahahah
also there's a jojo
but i know more than i was expecting tbh
yeah i am putting a lot in i don't know
hahaha
see you in 6 hours
it looks fun
imma do it
for a tier list
700 CHARACTERS
HOLY FUCKING SHAIT
https://tiermaker.com/create/haremandecchi-club-83792
did they really play florence football?
oh god
i respect your tastes
<:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
i'm just not saying it
there is no but
i'm not saying you're wrong
also mai only B+ tier
who TF puts Ichigo at Waifu rank?
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
<@!278860841485598720> you wanted me to bash on shit tastes?
but only 3 girls from nisekoi
**EVERY** character from trinity seven is there
also it's clear the creator liked some shows more than others
you are bound to make mistakes
700 characters
i mean
but i love shoko nishimiya so it's fine
also a silent voice
ok i guess it can **TECHNICALLY** count as harem
steins gate is there...
then again
so maybe that's why
harem and ecchi
it says ecchi
well
that one is a surprise
but no gamers either
and i am very happy it wasn't there
actually
Joseph Joestar and Leleuch because IDK tbh
ruka urushibara, Astolfo and Felix Argoylle because you know exactly why
only 5 haha
**GOD**
i dropped wataten in ep 6
the girl that is obsessed with her?
and Toga because **NO**
Mia-nee because she is an actual pedophile
Ayano is just very unlikable
Moeka has no personality and also ||kills Mayuri every time because **reasons**||
the invisible girl because, god please do something! you're invisible! you should be more interesting
Both kill la kill villains because ||rape||
Mei ||let her whole class die||
Itsuki, even the creator of quints doesn't like her, why should I?
and she instantly is **ALL MEN ARE PERVERTS**
Ao is just an asshole that doesn't trust guys because **ONE MALE** she knows is a pervert
these are the only trash characters for me
he's trolling
> TBH I just put any popular character I don't explicitly like into that category because why not :ChrisKek:
<@!278860841485598720> ^
no 7 witches from yamada-kun
No Akatsuki from Log Horizon
again, the harem is like 6 girls
only 3 girls from Yuragi sou
even tho the harem is like 6 girls
only 3 girls from Nisekoi
also Ayano but no Nagisa from Hanebado
and they just give you Asuka
Asuka vs Rei is one of the biggest waifu wars ever
but as far as i know
i haven't watched eva
**NO REI**
i can understand that
not even gridman
also i can add ayano from hanebado and ao-chan but I not Seishirou Tsugumi?!
kaguya has a yandere face
senjougahara is kind of a yandere
<:senjogahara:697945326434123836> Yuri science
1/2 fps?
what is this
you¡ll get the same enjoyment
just youtube the kissing scenes
it's obvious that 90% of the budget went to animating the kissing scenes
it's boring tbh
i tried
or at least
yup
<:HibikiShock:336656371611074580>
how much would that one cost?!
it isn't even available on ebay <:YumiPanic:688429717174354012>
<:ShirabeSob:701475635025019000>
Do a list of all the figures you want and realize you can't afford any
how to feel poor:
it's a pretty box ngl
she let zero two take the whole show
she's getting it from me too
but i respect them
i don't understand them
And dragon ball
Naruto
Which boost my day count by a lot
Also I have both Narutos
It’s still not bad at all
Imma ‘bout to hit 100 days
“But Catarina is so dense she doesn’t seem to notice” should be the name of the anime
I watch what I want depending on my mood
I don’t discriminate any genre
And on the second half the plot finally kicks in
I mean yeah, normally in an ecchi the first half or so it’s dedicated to well... ecchi
Even if it’s kiiiiiiinda ripping off steins gate
The last arc of Yuragi-sou is a very clear example
Some ecchi anime and manga have been actually great
From what i know it’s a very edgy show
I haven’t seen it
No clue
From what I’ve heard it’s just edge
When a villain in an anime says: “your attack is too weak to hurt me” but the opening is already playing in the background
One of buggs bunny’s best friends
She came back and everyone was like ||oh yeah! You exist...||
They also forgot about ||Annie until the last 3 chapters||
<:akarin_shrug:703903840759709707>
But it gets confusing
I mean it’s not impossible to understand
And S4 will be a mess because ||everyone betrays everyone and there will be more than 2 sides||
||Eren will die, he can’t survive the whole thing||

also Kaede Hondo will be voicing the dragon
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
and main girl will be voiced by Aoi Yuuki
then I ckeck
YEEEIIIIH
And I am like
then i found out it is getting an anime
And I was like yeih
i started reading a manga called "I've been killing slimes for 300 years and I accidentally reached max lv"
HOLY CRAP
<:TsubasaBliss:672861879000891432>
And that goal in 2012
Such a good player for Manchester City
I love Khun Aguero

Mari-chaaaaaan
A-kariiiiiiiiin
<:ShirabeSob:701475635025019000> <:ShirabeSob:701475635025019000> <:ShirabeSob:701475635025019000>
Akarin, Nao Tomori and Mai Sakurajima
Turn invisible
3 of my favorite waifus have the same power
The time travel episode
This episode was so good


She’s so precious
Akarin is my fav character from Yuru Yuri
> A-karin <3
<@274279989506211841>  HAAAAAAAAAAI
TOSHINOU KYOUKOOOOOOO!!!!!!
This girl
Actually most people think she is mute
She’s almost mute
She doesn’t even make sounds
And she does talk but on .01% volume
Where the president also has a voice actress
Or like in yuru yuri
I see
Wait the dullahan has a voice?
Beast
Ah yes
He does?
||Warhammer, Female, Colossal, Cargo||
Which titans ||Eren doesn’t have?||
Hahahaha
> It's either Kobayashi, Jojo, Gabriel Dropout, MHA, Love is War, Senko san, Konosuba or some other FOTM show
<@226789636989517824>  wait, two of those things are not like the others
And it’s also a memefest
It is fun
https://tenor.com/view/anime-girl-embarrassing-anime-girl-embarrased-gif-16416623
i wanted more from her
tbh she's kinda bland
except kanata
true
Claire best girl btw
Eclair vs Harukana was amazing
https://tenor.com/view/anime-yay-ass-slap-harukana-receive-scored-apoint-gif-12515918

Big tittied monster

Why not both?
^best girl


Have you seen new game?
Hmm
and Bible Shippuden
Bible
yes
i thought you were talking about the byble
ah
S2 is not as good
old testament ends with ||jesus dying||
can you send me the link via dm?
> :nisekoiOhayou:
<@!278860841485598720> i want that emote
Nisekoi in a nutshell
> are we getting boruble soon then
<@!145705908716961792> of course, but it will suck
https://vimeo.com/141441950
Vimeo: Sure thing lad! Hell, have them HD
Youtube: NO! YOU CANNOT HAVE YURU YURI OP'S HERE WHAT ARE YOU CRAZY?!
A silent voice is miles better
The second one is a mess
The first part I really like
It feels like 2 different movies
That much
I don’t really like your name
One of the most controversials I have
Oh yeah!
I won’t
<:CarolYandere:424047704826707980>
GX is my fav season
Oh yeah
But she can’t save the whole show
I kinda like Hestia
I don’t like Danmachi at all
People normally hate that season
Date a Live 3 is my fav season
Hmm
As for controversial opinions...
That part I am not joking
It is very entertaining trash
But!
It is trash
I always call keijo the best thing ever
I am joking don’t worry
Fmab is much better than fma 2003 tbh
No anime is even close to being as perfect as keijo
That is a masterpiece
Except Keijo
Haha
You can give it any rating you want
I mean
The mc is a chad and I enjoy him way too much
“I love big boobs, but I also love small boobs. I love all boobs as long as they are attached to a cute girl”
Trinity Seven has my single favorite line in any anime ever
Bot on MAL i rated T7 a 8/10
Every single time
Yeah Trinity Seven
<:senjogahara:697945326434123836>
Or Trinity Seven
If I had to watch that
Buuuuuut
Of course FMA Brotherhood is fantastic and I’ll rate it 10/10 anywhere
To me there’s a difference between the best and my favorite
Ah i see
I liked Inou battle

When they have literally only made 7 anime?
How is trigger so popular?
God I love Akane
Something else...
Gridman’s ending is...
<:akarin_shrug:703903840759709707>
LOOK AT THIS PIC! IT’S ADORABLE!
She’s so goddamn precious
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
Don’t @ me
Akarin is the best character in Yuru Yuri
~~same~~
And by the end, she knows every single one of them and spends time with them and has fun
Her whole class is afraid of her
At first she’s an outcast
You can see it in her relationship with her classmates
And yes she grows, I’ve had this discussion with many people
I love how she grows
The only anime I’ve ever given a 1/10

Ah, in case someone likes this anime
<:taigaAngry:562636924032909312>
And I love her
People here don’t like Taiga Aisaka
Oh yeah
But I don’t like the mc
Pancreas is also very good
Neither
Nande koko ni sensei ga?’s manga is actually good
Which you used to bully?
Do you have a relationship with a deaf girl?
I mean...
Body switching
And because of your name, people ignored a silent voice
Because they came out very close to each other
Yoyo!
And I rewatch it every so often
But I enjoyed it a lot
Becaude it’s my fav anime of all time
Maybe i am biased
I agree haha
Ok that part is bullshit
Ah yes
Mai doesn’t have big boobs
Utaha from Saekano and Yumiko from Grisaia are gahara ripoffs
She’s nothing like gahara
I don’t get why peoplr call Mai a gahara ripoff
BGS characters are better imo
I am going to disagree with you there
You were so close to getting to the good part
Episode 10 and 11 are the best episodes of violet
Episode 10: Mother
Episode 11: Soldier
The saddest violet evergarden episode is Ep 11, not Ep 10
Last hot take before going to sleep
It’s amazing
Bunny girl senpai is bakemonogatari but much better
Hot take
<:TsubasaSmug:585839805737467920>
I want news on tonikaku cawaii
Manga readers: ah... yes... thanks... i guess
Birburg studio: and also Quints Season 2!
Everyone: yeeey!!
Every studio: Hey guys this is what’s coming to 2021!!!
Any news on the 300 years slime anime?
<:saaad:591387558617940188>
You qre going to make me join every single one of those servers
Stop showing me emotes that I want
Hahhaha
Lank
And question the second one
I’ll keep the first one
This should be the name of the show

But i ended up binging it
I thought i was going to hate it
Kake is great
At least she’s fun to watch
Then obsess with Yumeko Yabami
Why do people like Himiko Toga?!
Ok for real serious question
Lewd
<:ShirabeSleep:691497302535176302>
Talk to you later
Imma sleep now
Like senryu shoujo
Don’t disappoint me
Come on uzaki
NICE
Next?
Which season is uzaki?
it's good
it goes by demon slayer logic
and the hero's name is Hero
hahaha
also her name is actually maou
big boobs aside
but she's actually a great character
that is one reason yes haha
the economic talk is great tbh
i think there are like 3 action scenes in the whole anime at most
> ah
> and it wasnt interspersed with action scenes here and there?
<@!95698695701397504> not really
and a lot of people find them boring
Real Answer: Because it is a politics and economics anime
that's a spoiler
<:senjogahara:697945326434123836>
She also Hibiki's her maid at one point


And then she evolves into Demon King at lv 32
at level 16
everybody knows Satania evolves into Shamiko
don't be silly
even the people that hate MHA say that the villains are the best part
but it is good
that's why everybody has their favorite
i think MHA has a very wide selection of villains
and you have the not really evil villain = gentle
you have the only revenge type villain = dabi
you have the anihero that wants the greater good by doing evil = stain
it has the villain that starts off unlikable but has a tragic backstory and you sympathize with them = shigaraki
it has the evil just for the sake of being evil villain = all for one
and hear me out
is My hero academia
(and hear me out on this)
one shonen that I know that has many different kinds of villains
who just keeps growing with every season
Like Vegeta
there are exceptions tho
and the creator has little ideas for the character afterwards
normally when a character changes, their character arcs are done
that's very rarely done
which is sadly what happens post G to Maria
the character in question pretty much becomes a background character
and if the character is not killed
yeah but when that happens, usually their arc ends
she grows a lot through out the whole story
That's the reason I like Taiga so much
As long as he’s threatening
Idk, sometimes just an asshole can work
Like Frieza or Hisoka
In shonen you can get away with a villain being evil just because he feels like it
Yes, but in some kind of stories it is more important than others
Shamiko - Shadow Mistress Yuuko
haha
i sometimes forget her name is not actually shamiko
**GANBARE SHAMIKO**
of Maoyu or Machikado?

Here have some Shamiko
i've heard of worst reasons to develop a fetish, don't worry
mostly politics and barely any action
it's just
it's mostly about the action and the techniques used
or the development
it's not really about the story
because that's not what dragon ball is about
if goku suddenly had an existential crisis, people would hate it
it has some great fights that people still watch on repeat today
i think DBZ is good on it's own
it is a great movie
<@!238855496797257729> I get you
it's just chaos
kid buu isn't even a character
there are people that like stain, people that like shigaraki, people that like gentle
you misspelled Gaara
because they are meant to be blank slates for you to fantazise being him
shonen main characters are not good
ah I see
revived his grandfather yet?
hasn't goku
why
...
even if a light one
yeah the freeza saga had a story
with the guillotine
specially at the first bet in S2
kakegurui in my opinion works as kind of a thriller
he didn't just *PUFF* power up
and you saw the struggles he had while making it better
but then he went on to making it even more devastating
I loved how Naruto trained to master a technique as powerful as the rasengan
and how those techniques work in battle
a good chunk of people watch shonen also to see how they develop new techniques
it's not only fight scenes
and also
but that has nothing to do with why i like kakegurui haha
i have
or vegeta fight
rhey specifically want to watch goku fight
people don't want to watch just fighting
which is what DBZ does
not if you make the characters likable
haikyu, kuroko no basket
most sports anime are also shonen
*There's no escaping banana, prepare to die*


i haven't watched the broly movie yet
oh yeah I forgot in english he is beerus
*I trained a whole year yesterday*
yeah
to mastering a technique Bills can't in a season
he went from barely being able to touch Bills
but idk
he did
and suddenly he is now stronger than him
he just changes hair colors
because every time a being more powerful than goku appears
Except that DBZ and DBS completely neglets this message
Goku: YOU CAN POWER UP?!?!?! GO AHEAD!!! PLEASE
Freeza be like: I will kill everyone you love as soon as I power up
of simple needs
goku is a simple man
yup
<:SakutaSmug:655558829852983299>
15 years old be like: I will become the king of youtubers! It doesn't matter if right now I only have 5 subscribers! If I trust myself and my friends I can become the next pewdiepie
Friendship + Justice + Underdogs
yes they do
From Link aaaaaaaaall the way to Deku
but it's a gimmick that has worked since the 80's
yes it's a gimmick
yes it sucks haha
oh yeah sakura, of course i'll marry you
and be like
cause then you can put yourself in his place
that's why they have no personality
Yes
~~Dead game~~
But why is the first season you recommend to me the ONA?!
I found out Nyarko-san is on the platform and I was like neat! I haven’t seen this
Dammit crunchyroll!
<:MariaSmile:688836869550768233>
and suddenly Rias starts talking and I'm like:
I started watching High School DxD
It’s fun but I’m guessing it’s going to be a bit dated
For the first time
I started watching DxD
Ok it is kinda fun
I guarantee it
It’s not fun
I thought you were saying that the girl was called Toradora
Hahaha
Because I saw that you were saying ah toradora she’s an ass
Nah in general
Yeah
You do know she’s not called Toradora right?
Dora the Hypno Toad
~~just that not from your eyes~~
You’ll cry alright
You’re welcome
That sexy, sexy voice
When you start watching High School DxD and Rias starts talking
And I am the one who hosts it
And dxd won the poll for group watch
I am a mod on another server
I need to watch high school dxd
I think it would be an overload of ecchi
But if I watch to love ru and high school dxd
I need to watch to love ru
i mean what?
I see you are a man of Grisaia as well
ah
Hibiki was right all this time
sadistic
i just need to explain to nino, hasuki and utaha that there are witches, spirits and elfs
and yes I am very bored
after I saw in the store a Build your own beer 6 pack sign
just something I made in my boredom
Here have fun, I limited myself to harems but you can pick whatever the hell you want
Because Mikasa in spanish is “my house”
Mikasa is more weird to me

but I much prefer him to the typical dense harem mc
really I do
I get why people don't like Issei
How many nazi salutes

Nah, it can’t be
Is that a... OMG IS THAT A...??!!!

In my mind the dude from Oresuki pops up
When you say Sun chan
<:ShirabeCheer:671887003414954005> <:ShirabeWink:672661604319363103> <:ShirabeAwe:698939825113268306> <:ShiraBean:661294258795446326>
**SHIRABE SHIRABE SHIRABE SHIRABE**

...then again it is an ecchi, and if MAL has thought me anything it’s that **ALL ECCHI IS BAD**
But ep 1 was pretty damn great and creative
I am judging very quickly because I have only watched ep 1
This is one of those shows I can’t understand having below 7 on MAL
I didn’t know Kirby’s anime had another season

(and an anime)
it's a game
i think Yumiko is rock bottom
actually scratch that
sometimes
but she can be funny
she's definitely rock bottom of the main harem
she's not as bad as I expected her to be at first
i am too harsh on Makina

when I say typical oniii-chan character I am refering to characters like this:
yeah
with the same goddamn voice every single time
for not being the typical "Oniiiiiiii-chan" character
extra points
hey
~~And it was painfull~~
The only time I tried watching an imouto anime was Umaru-chan
~~Other than Grisaia~~
Tbh
I’ve not seen imouto harems
I can ignore the incest stuff, but is it at least fun?
How bad is Oreimo really?
She’s more wild than Tobiichi Origami
Scratch that
God

And
?
Isn’t she just...
Hmmmmmmmm
Cause it makes me want to stop to see if I recognize sometjing
I hate it when animes do these

Anyway
Fine
It would be an incomplete reference
Sadly
You cannot quote it without the nazi salute
I mean
Just to quote this?
Have jojo fans made
The “sons of bitches” and “gay horse” OP’s anime
Nyarko-san
This anime wants a lawsuit

At least from this season
But it is kind of a guilty pleasure of mine
With horrendous CGI
It’s the same generic isekai
For example the 8th son
Some shows I get the low score even if I like them
So far
But I think it is a solid 8/10 for me
I mean I am not going to give it a 10/10
Yeah
But they all leave even a little of impact imo
Some episodes are kinda stupid I’ll give you that
Is it just because it’s ecchi?
The show is really creative with the abilities
Why is myriad colors under 7 on MAL?!
I need to watch that show
<:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
But saying it’s objectively better
Liking it more it’s fine
Even tho she’s more bisexual than lesbian
With Kanbaru
Bakemonogatari does the LGBT representation good imo
And VERY heavily leaning on girl on girl
That’s why LGBT is reserved for moe shows
No one is mad I think
Nah
They still see homosexuality as tabboo
And Japan is far more conservative than the west
Japan makes anime for japanese audiences
Exactly
To me it would make the community seem more natural
I’d prefer to have LGBT characters on a non LGBT show


Ah I know now what myriad colors reminds me off
They sure kid him a lot
<:MillaarcSmile:672845884135833610>
^in case you didn’t get the joke

Millarc would make old Quetzalcoatl cry tears of joy
How much time did you spent making that pun?
Got to work more on it
Oh, your pun was a bit SOLOPY there
So I gave it a 7/10
But it was just the ending
I despised the quints manga ending
YOU DIDN’T LIKE ONE ELEMENT!!! WHY IS IT A 1/10!!
And I’m like
1/10
The art is great, the characters are great, the music it’s fantastic, but I didn’t like the story
But some reviews I see on MAL are:
Yeah
They managed to make Nao Tomori’s power even shittier

Every time she's on screen my eyes instantly glue to the screen
Kanade is so much fun


Me:
Everyone watching Mayo Chiki: GOOOOOD KONOE IS SU CUTE! I LOVE HEEEEER

No, it reminds me specially of Inou Battle
But the main lead and the voice acting are amazing
The story and some characters are just ok
8.5/10 from me for Yamada-kun and the seven witches
thanks!
haha
sorry
i did it on powerpoint
as the geah representative
originally i had chris
but post G they are very fun to watch
ah, yes i agree as villains both don't work
when?
but a little less than the rest
I still love her
same as you
my least fav from the core 6 is probably Shirabe
oww
what about dessgirl?
ultimately I chose to include them because those games are very anime like
yeah I was debating myself if I would put videogames
but I don't mind pushy girls if they're fun
i know a lot of people don't
I love Haruhi

Got bored, made this
maybe all the gears would make it in
if it was a top 100
<:TsubasaAngry:692141154531016765>
i mostly have too much freee time
hahaha
yeah you can do that too
for the images just make sure they are all vertical and select cut to form
i guess you can have this if you want a template

hmm
me?
barely
but i don't think she'd make the cut
damn I forgot Akane
<a:TsubasaBroken:663625017191432192>
and I was like
i remember the first time kakashi tried to use kamui on deidara
we are old indeed
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFRfbctNXhU
wanna hear what nostalgia sounds like?
but I really like Diver too
but sillhouete is still my fav
it might sound generic
i mean
I love that OP
And I started taking out
One per show
Here, first I chose every girl I liked a lot in anime
than saying "the best"
it's more fun
also using "my" or "favorite"
tbh
it's a fun time
Chris, Rio Futaba, Eriri Sawamura, Miko Iino
if I could do multiple probably Chris would also get in the top 20
one per show
for the top waifus, both
or their personalities clicked with me
either they were integral to a show I loved
it's mostly the characters I fell the most in love with
Tsugumi could, Kirika, Liesse, Kurousagi, Origami, Annette, Sistine, Hatoko, Yunyun and probably Taiga
nah, most of the top 20 would kill me irl
and at the same time I chose a couple of waifus i knew for a fact were top tier
and started to take out girls i didn't like as much
i first nominated every girl I liked from every anime from mal
she's my spirit animal
and I love her so much
she will have an anime this year
she's a manga only character
oh
<:ElfneinSmug:688236836891656246>
you're the first person that first goes for my editing effort and maybe then goes to rate my shit taste
Also a weapon for mass destruction
But goddamn she’s vicious
I like her
Well <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
And Maple
Steph was also my fav from NGNL
She’s great
Oh nice! Kaga!
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
Violet evergarden from which series?
Jsut tag me
I’ll see it when I wake up
Perfect
I thought I was the only one on the group that watched Anima Yell
<:ShirabeStare:582381430915596289>
you can't make this shit up

Remember that time Shirabe became a space pirate?
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
i remember when I made that tier list with 700 waifus
damn
cause they would be plastic
the autoscorers wouldn't be waifus neither
and i thought you were refering to steven universe
you said gems
oh
I haven’t even watched IS
Hahaha
<:senjogahara:697945326434123836>
Dense harem protagonists
Like
There are better ones
But tbh
I like him
Gen is good
No gear there
Sadly
I am planning on doing top 20 male characters today
Not with a character based anime that I love so much
I couldn’t
But Kirika is so much fun when she’s on screen
I am considering that
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
~~just wait for S2~~
Don’t worry then!
I don’t think my opinion woulf be the same
But if Carol also had 4 seasons
I think I like Kirika a bit more
~~Just like rick and morty?~~
And my fav villain
It’s my fav main girl
For me it’s very tough
<:TsubasaAngry:692141154531016765>
Do I like Kirika or Carol more?
I didn’t even consider
Actually
That’s why I changed it
<:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
> But rias is just so loving and caring. She won me over
<@238855496797257729>  she’s sexier Maria
And another girl like Koneko
There’s a blue haired girl
I’ve seen the ed’s
So far
I am very much inclined for Akeno
But from dxd
Ascendance, Princess Principal, DxD (every season but the first one), and Chihayafuru are on my plan to watch
So many shows I have to watcj
And when she was alone she was like “I DON’T KNOW WTF AM I DOING HELP”
I loved that she only pretended to be in control
I liked Mii tbh
I haven’t watched SAO either
I was joking btw
Jajajhaha
Kirito best mc
<:SakutaSmug:655558829852983299>
That’s what makes it magical
His magic punch is a kick
Glen is the chadest of them all
Glen Raddars
And the legend
You reminded me or Rokudenashi
Ohhh
I prefer Arata
I’ve watxhed the first season
I haven’t seen it
Are the real harem MVP’s
Those two
Also Keima Katsuragi
Trinity Seven
Arata defo goes in my top 20 male characters
~~except if your name is Arata~~
It’s not supposed to be about the mc
It’s a harem
I mean
I’ve watched shit before
Mej
I mean, he is *the coolest*
To put or not to put Sakamoto in best male characters?
Bye bye
I’ll go to sleep now
You wish, get out of here
Slyfer red?
Maybe Kaiba was like
In a trash can somewhere
No kaiba product should be that weak!
Find whoever design that bottle and fire him!
*Crushes bottle*
It should’ve been called Kaiba-oh
He owned that movie
Kaiba is the reason the movie was so good
I think I’m done nominating
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
To tell us to watch something
And then someone comes to the symphogear server
When we pester everyone with the watch symphogear meme
<:SakutaSmug:655558829852983299>
Then I watched Ass Class
My last top 10 list had Keima at #1
He might be my #21
I thought about Rintarou
My top 20 male characters in anime

I still need to make my top 10 eds
And i am currently making top 10 male characters
Last week I made top 10 ops
I love making these top 10’s
No problem
i just need to cut 10
for best male I nominated 30
huh
is from "actually i am"?
the number 6 girl
oh
wholesome, character based comedies with yuri undertones
i mean, when you watch those shows you know exactly what you're getting
yeah doga kobo shows are good
oh
who?

i wish there still were group watches
i can't it seems
hmm
i see
why don't we have group watch here?
question
**A LOT**
...sucked
The first ep of the kancolle anime
Wow ngl
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
Set in WW1
~~and girls und panzer~~
Am I the only one that really wants a collab between KanColle and Strike Witches?
Notphogear
I shall call it
I just need one of the two idols in that concert to die and we’ll be all set
The base of operations is literally below the school
Monsters that turn into black dust when they die, a concert, mc sleeping in class and being called out by teacher, and weapon based mahoushoujo, yuri?
First ep:
Me: oh what’s this show? Battle girl highschool?
I didn’t know you could reincarnate in other anime
Goddamit Finè

<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
Maybe in this one it **WILL** have to be beef
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
It will be very hard for me to take this anime seriously
The friends call the mc “Miki”
Oh that’s just perfect
She’s the green mahoushoujo with a big ass scythe in this one
This one’s Aoi Yuki

Oh-
Celestial suits-
Ah
While in crunchy it’s listed as battle girl highschool
Also, the title card says Battle girl project
The main difference is that is looks a bit more moe and it has like 15 sympho- i mean wield- i mean use- i mean- fighters
Now if only they have a supersaiyan form in the last ep
These are Genjuunot and Ryuclone
How to get away with ripoff
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Notbasa is also edgy
Dammit
Yeah
I said earlier
Battle Girl Highschool
And Notrika
Notbasa
Yoshika had an insane amount of magic but no training whatsoever
Hikari had previous training but little magic
ok so Yoshika is reverse Hikari
Yeah welcome aboard
Only used the strike gear once
No battle experience
No questions asked
They just accepted her on the team
Oh and
Even the other girls are calling her on her bullshit
And Miyafuji is all like, ah yes, second nature, whatevs
And she had a very hard time using the strike gear in a battle for the very first time
In Brave Witches, Hikari had a lot of previous training from school
She had never even seen a Strike gear before!
Or at least skirts
**W E A R  P A N T S**
**P A N T S**
Also, this girls don’t know what pants are
The op for strike witches is not as good as brave
Ok first impression
Now we just need a mahoushoujo where they fight by playing instruments
I can’t believe it’s actually happening
YES!!!!!! YESSSS!!!! I wanted this to be a thing so bad!

time for more SymphNOTgear
ok
Strike Witches: "Huh, turns out I was a lesbian all this time..."
We are just making fun of the fact that she has the same name as the log horizon mc
Yes we know
Is the guy in my pfp
Kei Shirogane
And assclass
Violet in ep 11
Only 2 animes made me cry
It’s Shaft style blending in very good with the story
I mean
Bunny girl senpai
It certainly worked that way for me
Maybe
And being inspired by monogatari is not necessarily a bad thing
But the majority of people I have met really do
I get you don’t like it
Imo
Bunny girl is great
Oh, it’s a .5 chapter
Because I’m pretty sure that’s from the doujin
Meanwhile Kitsu:
MAL REVIEWS ARE THE WORST!!!!

The op is fantastic
It has showed for me before
That I have watched
Wait
Done
Sounds good
Hmm
What’s it about?
But not mecha
Gimme boomer
<@279341087494242304> help me boomer
God
110 chapters?!
Considered an OVA?!
Is 110 chapters
HOW THE FUCK
And mexha
Hahahah
110 chaptees
I can’t find it with those letters
Added both to plan to watch
That’s easy
Another 6 episodes
I can do that in a day
Only 6 episodes?
~~but no gundam~~
Recommend me boomer shows
Instead of making fun of me
<:AstoSmug:588708219229175809>
I love it
I started watching Kaichou wa maid-sama
tl;dr
Those are all 80’s and 90’s
Well yeah
So i watched a lot of Saint Seiya, DBZ, Captain Tsubasa, Inuyasha and Rurouni Kenshin growing up
Cause Mexico started dubbing those shows when I was a kid
I actually watched a lot of boomer
Shut up <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Pre 2010
I decided to watch a couple of boomer shows
Since you guys say I just watch zoomer
it's a 9.5
FMA is not exactly a 10 to me
i wish I could give .5's on MAL
but at the same time with my left is impossible
i can do it with my right hand no problem
that twirl is not possible
i swear
https://tenor.com/view/top-chuunibyou-anime-kawaii-rolling-gif-17274733
MAL
this is my MLA
https://myanimelist.net/animelist/CarlosGLara13?status=2
It’s very stupid
Turn your brain off and enjoy comedies
But it is one of those
And not many people here have seen it
Is Asobi Asobase
That I love
One comedy show
#watchsymphogear
But I still have 300 animes in MAL
I am not an expert in any way
I mean
I guess I can suggest something?
Usui and Misa are great
Which maid-sama definitely has
I love romance anime that have a great dynamic between the two leads
Kaichou wa maid-sama
Nope
But it doesn’t look dated
It looks old because of the art style
I love the style so much
I am loving this fucking anime
GODDAMIT
Also
That one and Jojo
It might be the only other anime set in mexico ever
I’ll try it
I thought that was set in Argentina
Witch hunter?
I don’t remember watching the movie tho
One of those was Trigun
A bunch of 90’s shows were dubbed in Mexico
As I said
Yeah
I might learn it in guitar
Like Rennai Boukun
And I think I will have to drop some shows that I actually don’t care about enough to finish
And stop starting new shows
The first thing I have to do is finish the shows I’m watching rn
And my rewatch of Gear but I am in ep 4 of XV so I’m almost done there
Plus Strike Witches, Nyaruko-san, New Game!!  and Kaicho wa Maid Sama, that I’m watching atm
Akame Ga Kill
Blood Lad
Fruits Basket
Girls Und Panzer
K-On
Little Witch Academia
Madoka Magica
Noragami
Oregairu
Sakurako no Pet
Seto no Hanayome
Sora no Otoshimono

 And every Monogatari that’s not Bake
Those are not shows that I have on PTW
Those are only the shows I have On Hold
And I left my blu rays of steins gate in the other city
I know! But the whole stupid covid thing started
On hold shows that I actually want to finish:
Amagi Brilliant Park
Anohana
Code Geass
Death Parade
Durarara
Hunter x Hunter
Kekkai Sensen
Log Horizon
New Game
One Punch Man
Re:Creators
Sakamoto Desu Ga?
Slime Anime
Steins; Gate
To Love Ru
Vinland Saga
Yojo Senki
<:DONE:602895899022065674>
I haven’t even started with Noragami
I have so many anime on hold and on ptw
Cypher giving Mondaiji Tachi a 10/10
example of good opinions
I like Keijo as much as I liked Haruhi Suzumiya
according to kitsu
what kind of options are those?!
like a lot
like
meh
and awful
it gives you 4 options!
for ratings
KITSU IS THE WORST!
i will make an anilist tomorrow
can you import MAL lists?
nope it didn't

Me:
Hey what are you drinking?
From which I am only interested in 2
For CR
Only 5 new anime
from which I have 5

In the original Beyblade there were a total of 7 Dragoons
that's my bad
i don't know why i posted it in anime club

I get reminded of The World God Only Knows and Chihiro
Damn when I see this image
No, you're fucking not
False alarme#
That’s the OVA
Oh no wait
For now I’ll put ep 22
It’s called egoistic poriomania
The episode 25 i can’t find on MAL
Has 25 episodes
The blu ray
Huh...
Rintarou Okabe be like
just returned Moeka to the past via his fist
Okabe
god
then i will look for that chapter online
i see
is the alternative version in the blu ray?
if i am watching the blu rays?
anyone here knows how to watch steins gate?
hmm
does Irregular at magic high school meet this criteria?
i want to watch a trashy but entertaining show
All the way to college graduates
From what I understand they have middle schoolers
They have a very wide age span
And I don’t think they will be
At least not as far as I have seen
They are not a group
They are all individual idols
That’s the name of the production company
Nah
...wait a second
Idol Tsubasa...

It also has a tsubasa
I didn’t expect it to be a documentary
I can tell right away
She’s gonna be my favorite

it is a crybitch movie
i liked it a lot
and still watch idolnaster
continue kinmoza
i'll instead
know what?
fuck that
irregular has 26 episodes
change of plans
no wait
and idolmaster for ido
irregular for trashy
i think i'll go idolnaster and irregular
or rather trashy
i want to watch something shitty
keep in minf
ok, Idolmaster, irregular at magic school, endro or girly air force
i think i'd rather idolmaster
> i also wanted to give idol shows a chance
<@!453836798796234762> between Idolmaster and Love Live
(it's easier for me)
but tbh i want to watch something on crunchy
i thought about that
hmm
> Patient Hero is a great brain off watch
<@!165030821353226240> you mean cautious hero?
i also wanted to give idol shows a chance
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJfg39WkMvE&t=24s
well that and
it's the best thing the internet has ever made
it's a sin if you don't
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQmEERvqq70
you know what this mash up reminds me off?
i am seeing the second one
yeah?
The Tsubasa clone^

and she kinda sounds like Maria
she hangs around the tsubasa clone a lot
i mean
I call her Diet Saint-Germain
i am trying an idol show for the first time
the last one is Assclass
the first 3 pics i sent Idolmaster

I know that fucking classroom

<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
WEARS GREEN!?!?!?!
AIRHEAD
BLONDE AND GREEN EYES

like metallica's some kind of monster movie
i thought it was going to be a documentary on this struggling idol agency
i loved episode 1
yeah I guessed that was the case
that was very interesting
like a documentary into idols
but i wish the rest of the anime was like ep 1
it's not bad
i am in ep 6 of idolmaster
if you told me trigger made this in their spare time just for the lolz and accidentaly it got leaked i would believe you
the guy that animates this is very talented
no joke
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tbwx9mv9q34
Don’t @ me
But brave witches is better
I am watching it atm
I like strike witches
Me during the entirety of episode 8 of Idolm@ster

I am sleepy
I haven’t slept
Good question...
It gets kind of ridiculous ngl
Also the mom is bigger than Uzaki
Blame the mom for the ecchi factor haha
Because she likes to imagine all sorts of fantasies with the mc
Actually it’s Uzaki’s mom that bring the most ecchi scenes
And there’s far less ecchi than you’d think
It actually gets kinda wholesome
I read the manga since like 1 year ago
Her *other* selling point?
You mean appart from
I like her smug faces
<:ShiraBean:661294258795446326>
And it would be wrong of me to force mine into you
You’re entitled to your own opinion
That’s fine
WELL YOU KNOW WHAT?!?!
and use it every day
instead of getting mad, she would laugh her ass off
knowing her
i want the second shirt for a friend
same here haha
**SUPER HUGE**
<:TsubasaIgnite:672861877407318047>
idolmaster is being a very pleasant surprise for me
tl;dr
welp
hmm
only to binge the whole thing in a couple of days?
"there's no way i'm liking this anime"
have you ever thought to yourself
https://tenor.com/view/demichan-wa-kataritai-interviews-with-monster-girls-hikari-takanashi-anime-teehee-gif-7568771
demi-chan is a very wholesome anime
<:ShirabeSleep:691497302535176302>
Sleep now
Life’s a mess
8 am
I’ll come@back with an answer when I wake up
At all
I didn’t like Oregairu...
...so
unless your name is naruto or my hero academia
Meh, I’m used to that at this point
I saw a couple of vids, it looked funny
Is blood lad good?
faust's japanese voice...
wait
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
he lost the other 40%
60% a boy
or at least
he's a boy
it's funny, the action and creativity during fights is great
fmab is amazing tbh
i think i just spoiled you
oh damn
and i'm like... that's wrath
and then Bradley appeared and Ed was like: "GREED!!!"
specially because i saw conqueror of shambala by accident
but i do know about the changes
i still need to watch it
^FMA called
it would be weird if it wasn't creepy
just look at faust's design
i mean
downright the best fight in the whole series

it sounds like a pokemon opening
we got oversoul
damn
they used Oversoul?
at least they're keeping the old op
damn
and meliodas is going to play nasa
tonikaku cawaii is getting an anime, that's all I care about
https://tenor.com/view/family-guy-peter-griffin-he-said-it-he-said-gif-5286270
i loved the shaman king voices in spanish
i hope that shit gets dubbed in spanish
~~except komi-san anime~~
anything's possible
they are remaking shaman king
everything now can be remade
also it's the 2020's
everyone thought it was dead
after how many years?
~~except bleach~~
let's be honest
unless you're a shonen
no
i barely remember she exists

and i'm in episode 18
because so far she's had the least amount of development
is Haruka supposed to be like a main girl or...?
btw
she's literally tsubasa

we talking even more idol sord
she deserves more screentime
thank god
she has a spinoff?
i heard it is way worse than the originla
but she ended up only having girl fans
she became an idol to use girly stuff like dresses and such
she's fun
> never heard of Makoto
<@!237964037898502144> the tomboy girl
Don’t @ me
Best girls in Idolm@ster
Nah the voice
This anime also has Maria

Because she’s even more idoly sword
Potential meme
~~he's right you know~~
https://tenor.com/view/sonic-knuckles-twerk-dancing-random-gif-14760590
just look at her
i mean
<:Ver:704169051391524875> 
<:dio2:671387943423967248> 
<:dio3:671387986730156039> 
<:dio4:671389448692563969>
symphogear should've had more fine
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
from the start
i fooled you all
hot take i have never seen symphogear
symphogear has waaaaaaay more singing than idolmaster
and if you saw "symphogear isn't an idol show"
are the only two idol shows i need
symphogear and idolmaster
it's probably me
if the name suonds like a meme
hello
i've never watched love live
i would respond you

AND HER 400 CLONES?!
don't you like senjougahara?
what do you mean?
that's love live
ah no wait
don't spoil cinderella girls for me
wait no
> btw AMQ ping me after you're done with episode 20 and I'll link you a good video <:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
<@!139432096023183360> i'll do

~~so is hachikuji~~
^
<:Hachikuji:707818036152762369>
^best girl from monogatari
https://tenor.com/view/mayoi-hachikuji-monogatari-series-anime-gif-13897881
is it weird when somebody asks you what your best girl of a show is, and your best girl is actually the loli?
and anime in general
i hate idol shows
no
<:senjogahara:697945326434123836>
i don't wanna
but she just appears in 2 seasons
they mention her every season
Tbh
You can skip it
I mean
You didn’t like Golden Wind?
I’m too lazy to switch
<:rage:651253812329316382>
https://myanimelist.net/animelist/CarlosGLara13?status=1
Wanna talk trash list?
Also
But the second part suuuuuuucks
A 11/10
That’s incredible!
If it was just part 1
I voted Death Note a 9/10
Also
You can rate anything whatever you want
Nah I’m kidding
but first half is great
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
Death Note with 6
second problem
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
Toaru with 10
first problem
can i judge you harshly?
Closely followed by Koro-sensei
<:MaiOfCulture:655558829668433930>
Mai is my favorite character in any anime of all time
Hahah
Who is yukino?
I was like
She is nothing like Senjo
At most she’s discount Yukino
Nah
<:ShirabeCry:671887081026617345>
Mai goddess
^
<:MaiPeek:655558829412712498>
You haven’t watched my goddess and her anime?
<@!87512939107450880>
Wait!
I’ll need to rewatch it
I don’t remember that anime very well
Yes!

This one
Nah that’s oregairu
That title has a shorter name but I forgot what it was
Oh you dropped my mental choices are interfering with my long ass anime name
Good call
Oh you also dropped Gamers
<:misaki:727794325529821194>
My girl Misaki
<:DONE:602895899022065674>
Kaicho wa maid sama dropped
NOOOOO
Let’s see what you dropped
It can’t be bad
They gave something to koro sensei
No no wait
And Chris in SSS
Then Tsubasa in A
I only put Biki at B
But it has symphogear
The main trio only
Also it has symphogear
But it’s a fun mistake
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
And I found one with 1500 waifus
There are tier lists for waifus
You’ve seen the waifu tierlists?
Wanna know what I did yesterday?
Suddenly it was pink
Oh jojo did the same with  Giorno’s suit
I blame the mexican education system
God if I had koro sensei as a teacher I would be an astronout by now
Look at who didn’t make it!

Wait look at this shit!
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Shiota Nagisa is in the wrong category
Is a tragedy
Tomori Nao only 184 votes
I saw her
Oh bi wait
She won once?
That means..?
Since zero two is not there
Wait
Because she’s actually a wife
She wins automatically
I have the best waifu of 2020 right here
Whenever I see people say Himiko Toga is their fav character I cry a little
People will mostly vote for trashy popular characters
People like trash

Of course people will ask how!
HOW!!????
FUCKING HACHIMAN WON?!
HACHIMAN?!
OMFG
You said far right you dingus!
From Angel Beats
Kanade Tachibana
HOOOW?!
She was the last character to make it
Haruhi qualified in dead last
Is Shirabe a yoyo reference?!
Is that what Shirabe uses to attack?
What’s a jojo?
<a:KaedeLoudButFast:655558699321917471>
Kaedeeeeee and Senjoooooo
Persia, Ram, Holo, Kumiko, Nagato Yuki!
Who tf is Chitanda Eru?
But Mai is simply unmatched to me
I like both
I’m kinda sad Mai lost to Kaguya
Mai lost
Oh damn
Issei is the embodiment of “i’m a simple man”
Mexicans prefer Issei over Touma
I’d say
Hell
Mexicans don’t watch toaru that mych
That’s very weird
> I prefer xenovia
<@238855496797257729>  earth-chan
I prefer Akeno tbh
We would also overvote ecchi stuff, so Rias Gremory and stuff
Mexico would overvote anything dragon ball related
I expect Mexico to overvote Goku
Seriously?
Dr Ver is less of a jerk than he is
Seriously I don’t
I don’t get why people like Hachiman
You described it exactly as it is
<:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
> Whos hachiman
<@238855496797257729>  the mc from oregairu
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
The best girl of this show is a guy
Then the kno is what makes her bad
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
Just kidding, Yui is much better than Yukino bye
I’ll go without making much sound...
Yep?
There we go
It is weird that people call me AMQ
I will change my name back tbh
Night
But thanks
I don’t think it can be considered night anymore
It’s 8:22
I will sleep now
But at least Kanade won
Haruhi is way too low
Specially if your name is Leon
They are all very top tier
People have very little appreciation for Boarding School Juliet girls
The girl from Kyouka
Oh
for the love of god, please someone put on pants in this show
BUT WHY THE NURSES?!
ok I get why the witches don't wear pants, to use their powers they need to get into witch form which has a tail that would get in the way if they wore pants...
9.5/10
I felt very happy watching it
...I loved it tbh
Finished with Idolmaster
0:12 camafaliseetowachoin so much
I can understand them better if they actually speaked japanese
I have no idea what they were saying
> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zP3QpCdyIw4
<@!226789636989517824>
Noooo Haruka <:saaad:591387558617940188>
And I love it
It’s insane
The one with the wedding dress
But I still really like ep 8
It’s vwry nice
That was beautiful
<@139432096023183360> i’m done with episode 20
My friend told me it was shokugeki no soma
it's like if Kirika and Carol had a baby
Grown up Kirika
Wuuu Maria episode
he is well aware
it's not like he doesn't know that he is hurting people
he tries to solve problems by hurting others and making himself to be a common enemy to everybody
**IMMEDIATE** yugioh reference

started watching blood lad
AKA, he’s not helping people, he just likes playing the victim
> <@453836798796234762> Really? I wouldn't consider someone who would purposefully fuck themselves over for the benefit of others to be a jerk.
<@!195044406343106560>  self sacrifice is only a temporary solution for things that literally solves nothing but creating a common enemy, when they common threat is gone problems will undoubtedly arise again. What Hachiman creates is a false sense of peace. Not even considering the people that care about him and his well being and that he’s hurting by constantly putting himself in the line of fire
But I got kinda bored
I need to finish Kinmoza
the CG in Strike isn't nearly as bad
also why does Brave have awful CG?
Sanya appears in Brave
yes it does
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
i already watched brave so...
i mean
brave is after S1 and 2
hmm i was wrong
I might be wrong
i thought brave was in between S1 and 2
and then S2?
then brave witches
so it's strike witches then the movie
i have a lot of pending animovies from shows I've watched
i think i'll easily reach the end of SW before the next season starts
was much harder to use
which if I understand correctly
and she did use Chidori
and abuse the ability she did have
she just learned to work around her weakness
and Hikari never got "good"
> Yoshika isn't really worst worst ||outside of the endings|| I just loved watching Hikari's struggle to be good, rather than Yoshika being great by default
<@!106866895076003840> this^
~~her bunny girl figure actually has her own ears~~

the best part about shirley
> Charlotte was my first Dakimakura <:HibikiWhoops:585839808115507222>
<@!189146272865845248> wise choice
the~~ fanservice queen~~
My other girl
<:MariaScared:672584661125431299>
> yeah they arent pantless :BikkiKappa:
<@!152896851660505088> ah, that's a big NONO
My girl, the sniper
~~it's almost like they ripped off their own mc~~
Hikari is great
> I prefer it over original almost entirely because it has such a better protag
<@!106866895076003840> 100% YES
i actually like brave witches a lot
> It might be one of the newer spinoffs
<@!99695384296701952> it's from S1 actually
Are you ready?
I am ready
I swear I hear
is it really that?
are my 3 favorites
Miki, Chihaya and Makoto
<:KirikaSmug:607742561414676517>
I am, yes
I liked Miki waaaaay too much
also
"i'm ready, i'm a lady"
for Ready the CR subtitles in the start of the song are:
also the crunchyroll subtitles SUCK
<:KirikaPog:605209108827734017>
And I was like
but then they started saying 3, 2, 1!!!
at first i didn't quite ||noticed the transition||
i really liked when they ||combined both ops for the last song||
i also started cinderella girls
i didn't know that
and catch up to S3
maybe tomorrow I'll finish Oregairu S2
all season 1's
Idolmaster, Noragami and Strike Witches
i finished 3 anime today that i had started
Exacto
In the lack of pants?
<:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
This figure has the right idea
S1? Wow the version I watched really looked like crap
That’s S2 right?
I think that’s shirley
Shirley?
~~i wanted to see Lyne’s melons~~
What a ripoff
The version I saw was censored
Wait
||why make it 1 minute long?||
Thet semifinal in particular was meant to be one of the highlighst of the tournament
There are ways that you can make a one sided battle last more than it seems
Ar at least give more time to the fight
I could’ve lived without it
Is it just me or the latest ep of GOH kinda sucked?
I am too!
Lyne is a treasure
i am tired of seeing anime use the seven deadly sins for every anime
nah i mean
> oh fuck me we're about to have another instance of anime getting Tarot extremely wrong aren't we
<@!155150213445582850> ~~at least it's not the seven deadly sins~~
<#336297808221044736>
but it's in S2
i found the uncensored boobs in strike witches
oh wow!

Miyafuyi: Take me with you!
Sakamoto: NO!
Miyafuyi: Please...
Sakamoto: oh ok
**IMMEDIATELY** the OP is much better than the first
started S2 of SW
imma start S2
speaking of SW
> Are you finally going to stop pestering the poor girl now?
<@155150213445582850>  **N O **
also we're in anime channel
we have berserk biki
<:HibikiPing:688397678421344268>
we have dying tsubasa^
we have mental breakdown carol <:CarolYandere:424047704826707980>
we have other emotes about horrible things in symphogear
i mean
<:senjogahara:697945326434123836>
in a good way
Keijo is ass
it really is
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
"keijo is the best anime of all time"
like if i say
i use the ver emote when i troll in general
it has much less hachiman
Oregairu 2 is a big improvement so far from the first season imo
we should switch back the conversation to anime tbh
there are plenty of smug type emotes
you take out that emote, and people will use another one
but we use the emote for stuff that's not toxic
that the emote is not the problem
Melua already agreed
i mean
^like this one
<:HibikiSmug:672655850518609940>
or use other similar emotes
i like yui, I like the writting sometimes
and there are some things of oregairu that I do like
nah I was planning on watching oregairu anyway
because surely there has to be something there
you still wanna watch it
and you hate it
OVER AND OVER AGAIN
IT'S LIKE YOUR FAVORITE ANIME OF ALL TIME
but when people say
yeah I know
but i am starting to get it more
i still don't really like it...
i thought it was a genre
oh i see
what is urobutcher?
cute girls do cute things doesn't always = gay
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
but a girl does confess to another one in that anime tho
implicit gay
that's the main concept of Dragon maid
i mean
but i can't remember
i think there is..
is there yuri in school live?
it's implicit yuri
there's that^
one girl confesses
cute girls doing cute things
Asteroid in love
yeah asteroid as well
but i bet they have at least one character that questions their sexuality
i haven't seen k on or lucky star
dragon's maid, hinako note, yuru yuri, anne happy
which is most of the time tbh^
BLASPHEMY
ON STRIKE WITCHES?!?!?!'
PANTS?!?!
what's this?!
Incidentally i just finished S2 yesterday
Have fun watching
I thought it was stuff mentioned but not very well explained
Ok sorry go ahead
Except Yoshika
Actually they were
Specially the mc
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I actually like Brave Witches more than Strike
I’m just confirming it for you
But there are others
Ah yes
> are there other Witch units that we've never heard about in other places?
<@155150213445582850>  that’s the whole plot of the spinoff *Brave Witches*
I’d read the hell out of Boarding School Hasuki
We don’t need 40 more chapters
Just end the series right here
Yuri of the season?

next season
This looks like Keijo and Dumbell nan kilo moteru had a baby
...you have my attention
https://myanimelist.net/anime/41783/Iwa_Kakeru__Sport_Climbing_Girls

Over 99% is good to buy
Just check the reviews
I could probably find it a bit cheaper
I love lil’ all Akarin almost as much as her sister
I want it a lot
I do
Yuru Yuri, Hajimaru Yooo
Haaaaaai
NOOO GO AWAY! MY WALLET CAN’T HANDLE THAT

Also Minori:
Minori: I want to be the next Shiroe!

because that last episode reminded me why i dropped the manga to begin with
am i the only one who's dropping kanokari?

how about this one

good one!

try to guess the anime based on the youtube comments
it's time for everyone's favorite game!
Violet looks nice
I fall in love with that story
Maybe you wouldn’t but I definitely do
But if it’s better than Hibike 2 i’m hyped
I haven’t seen that yet
Specially because one of the main plot points was one of the supposedly “yuri” characters having a crush on her teacher
Tbh I didn’t get that many yuri undertones from hibike
Except for the fact that Hibike Euphonium 2 is the best thing Kyoani ever produced
The bestest of friends
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
They are just very good friends
I should watch hibike again
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
Just like Miku and Hibiki are just very good friends
Embrace it
Accept it
Moe = (almost all the time) yuri
It just won’t happen
Is like asking for a shonen that has good waifus
Asking for a moe with no yuri
I told you a thousand times
All that topped with good’ol yuri
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
The ara ara has small boobs
The kuudere is not cool all the time
The dere is not happy
This anime takes the stereotypes and flips them over without you even noticing
She’s so precious even tho she sucks at everything
Damn I just wanna hug Kaos so badly
**KAOS**
I mean...
**GANBARE SHAMIKO**
The mc is giving me depression haha
i like how the most innocent of girls draws hentai
i just started comic girls
speaking of cute girls doing cute things

^wataten
yup
I’m going to hell for that joke
<:SakutaSmug:655558829852983299>
Kyoani also burned and crashed so
I mean
You look like you’re rating your own comments
Why do yoj and lank have stars tho?
I need to finish it
David productions?
Trigger?
Teekyuu is fucking fantastic because of the shitty animation
They are a shitty company, and because of that when they made teekyuu it was goddamn fantastic
<:rage:651253812329316382>
Also did Berserk 2016
Like for example the same people who did teekyuu
God gives and god takes
I think it’s meant to be that way
Oh
Trigger?
It burns
The colors...
That rarely happens
I like all of the girls equally in this show
Damn
Again imo
But with no story
Violet looks amazing
But I can’t deny that it is great art
A little too colorful for my taste
But the rest is just...
Tryly masterpieces
Episode 10 and 11 are works of art
But 60% of the anime is very forgettable imo
2) Rally go round - Nisekoi:
1) Youjou Yujou - Nichujou
Lemme see if i can remember them
I can’t find the image
I love that op
Lemme see if i can find the image
I once did a top 10 ops
<:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
I get it wrong every time
I can never seem to remember the opening for how not to summon a demon lord
But forgetable ops
I can remember bad openings
The worst are not the bad openings
But i hate it
It’s wasy
Danmachi Op1
God that opening **SUCKS**
Totsugeki Rock is one
There are a couple of naruto shippuden ops that i absolutely dispise
Outside of random ops that only go for one ep?
Sorry
KOHANE
I think was that girls name
Hotahe
That’s from anima yell
Wait that’s not Kaos
~~that’s why i’m so good at amq~~
It doesn’t matter how bad they are
I never skip openings
Yeah with the black box it mostly just looks like fire

And the nuns who are burning get censored
Half of the screen goes black
Then maybe it was ep 3 onwards
I think...
Ep 2 onwards the ed is censored
That’t why the ed in ep 1 is different from the rwst
Rigjt between ep 1 and 2
Yup
||nagisa won the final with a fucked up knee||
||you’re going to hate the mom big time||
But be ready
You’ll just have to watch it
By the last match definitely yes
I mean... kinda
||Oh her mom is a piece of shit||
(The rival)
Nagisa is very cool tho
Has one of the worst mcs i’ve seen
Hanebado
I just love op 1 a lil bit more
Both are fucking fantastic
Because everyone loves hey kids
I thought you meant why op 1 instead of op 2?
When you said what?
No clue
Yeah

I have no clue haha
Maybe it translates...?
I swear the wiki for noragami said the first op was called that
Really?
The first one
**NO**
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
What?
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720> <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Testament over every single one
Everyone knows the real OP is Apple
Vitalization ain’t even an OP
I think it was something like that
10) Overnight appointment- Noragami
9) God only knows - anime of the same name
8) Testament - Geah
7) Voracity - Overlord III

<:SakutaThinking:655558830117355560>
I think a book is the person that makes food
> Ill take your word for it since i stopped at sistergatari
Incestgatari
The odd and unorthodox voyages of a lineage of people that share the nickname Jojo
That’s bizarre
In an adventure
But it’s always a Jojo so...
Jojo changes protag like it changes underwear
But Taiga is
That kuroko himself is not the protagonist
You can make a very strong argument
In kuroko no basuke
Yeah there are a couple of shows that do this
In overlord ainz is very much the protagonist
The antagonist will always be the character that goes against the protag
If the story keeps following him/her
Only because a protagonist turns evil it doesn’t mean it’s not the protagonist anymore
Antagonist and protagonist can’t really switch places that easily
Tbh
Hmm
Or any anime?
Hmm sports anime?
Hahahahah
She looks like fucking momo

The one with the cute eyes is the mc
Yeah
The girl with the **I WILL FUCKING END YOU** look on her face
^big spoilers for hanebado
You mean kinkshame the animation?
Twintail?
It feels insanely easy to watch
I am liking it
But no... she just hates it because ||the season is very romantic and she wants a boyfriend||
I started the christmas episode and one of the girls was like “i hate christmas” and i was already ready for some “my brother died on christmas” or “my parents are so busy they never spent christmas with me” backstory
Wanna know what I am liking about Comic Girls? It doesn’t have bullshit unnecessary drama just for the sake of it
Dess hijacking other shows like it’s no one’s business
Me, an intellectual:
The computer teacher: “No you can’t listen to gifs, they have no audio”
It feels like S2’s ending is perfect
I really want the story to end there
And man
I just finished yesterday new game!!
Haha
<:SerenaDizzy:736605371912945736>
Adding more stuff would be pushing it
This is the perfect ending
Like
Damn I hope there **ISN’T** more
Have you ever finished an anime and think to yourself
From Comic girls
If that isn’t meta, I don’t know what is
Kaos just ripped off the very anime she’s in
Precious ❤️
Goddamn
So...
Also she’s a huge anime nerd
Showing how she lives her daily life
It’s just a story about a cute vampire girl and her fangirl
There’s not really any plot tbh
It’s very “cute girls doing cute things”
Hmmm
Karma looks so fucking weird in the manga
Time to watch Sket Dance
My cuties

potential meme
i refuse to believe that's not how this anime got made

-oh man remember when we were kids? and we used to do imaginary fights? and we said things like "no you can't kill me because i am immortal, and also i can reflect attacks, and also I am super powerful, and also i am super fast" man... those were weird times
-yeah... weird...
*4 years later*
Araragi... Yomiko-san!
Now I want Miki and Kirika fan art
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720> <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720> <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Airhead? Sings? Blonde? Green clothes? Medium to big boobs?? Speech impediment??? **SCYTHE?????**
i am watching it as we speak

there are no other girls
she's the only girl
what do you mean best girl?
what is this anime? hahahahahahaha i love it

Don't believe me? Look at the amazing results
Step 2: You now have a girlfriend

Step 1:
how to get a girlfriend
I don’t even need the other 2
One line **PUM** best girl
It was absolutely immediate
I **IMMEDIATELY** love Himeko
Rn I just started Kokoro Connect
I need to watch fruits basket

The perfect smile doesn't exi-

Tactic number 2 for getting a girlfriend:
right first
Kokoro Connect is one of the best animes i’ve watched this year
Welp...
i will give him that
he is a much likable guy in S2
he gets better
that's my main problem with subaru
he is self centered
he tries
at least he does stuff
BUT
subaru is also pretty unlikable
kazuya is an absolutely horrible mc
but this is "SIMP: The Manga/Animation"
i'm sorry
i really do
i hate using this word
but i got pretty far
and also dumped it
i read most of the manga
it's not worth it
trust me

https://tenor.com/view/saika-trap-stare-cute-blink-anime-gif-17172435
Saika is best ~~girl~~ tho
she has all the likability that her brother doesn't have
Perfection
Komachi is
Komachi is
true
wish me luck
i will very much power through this series
the best parts of oregairu are when they give the spotlight to the side characters
goddamit, watching oregairu is actually hurting me
i am very much on Yui's team
if it's between the two
yeah
but that's really a slap on the face of mai
i sometimes call yukino "lesser mai"
damn
i forget she's there half of the time
and she's done **LITERALLY NOTHING**
so far i've seen 18 episodes of oregairu
please can a Yukino fan tell me why do you like her?
but...
i get it
and everyone can have their very own waifu
everyone is entitled to their own opinnion
Yeah that episode sucked
The wedding ep?
It’s pretty much Dragon Ball with Stands
Koroko Connect: ||Iori is a bitch to everyone||
or as I like to call it
also i am watching now kokoro connect: michi random
It’s the legendary Mewthree
Wtf hahahaha
*kachi kachi kachi kachi kachi kachi kachi*
ah
what is miru tights even about?
chihayafuru is a sports anime?
Sadly they’re in a trash manga/anime
Kanokari girls are fine
For real this time haha
I will sleep now
Probably
And a lot of hydrogen
But to be a star she’d need waaaaay more mass
What’s so wrong with that
She wants to be a star
She will also have all your social media passwords
But knowing her
Yes
or Rachel from Tower of god?
would you choose Mami from Kanokari
to choose 1 girl
if you **HAD**
which one would you choose?
if you had to show one of them to your parents
i think i'll watch either haganai or IS
hmm
i think i'm actually like 4 chapters behind
the manga is actually ending kinda epic
it's amazing
i am caught up with the manga
of course I have
absolute duo i saw ep 1 and it kinda bored me
i will add it to my PTW
i've seen that eye patch girl before
which of those you'd say is the most: "it's literally nothing but ecchi, no plot at all"?
i am between Infinite Stratos, Haganai or Absolute Duo
i want to watch a trashy ecchi show
haganai
at the very least it's a psp this time around
Noragami S3 never
i need to watch that as well
ah yes i forgot about sora no otoshimono
i wanted some ecchi
now i will watch ep 1 of haganai
not by a longshot
i can tell he ain't as bad as kazuya
from just ep 1
ah that explains it
is your hair doing that?
how

downright to the Tohka???
so far it looks like a ripoff of date a live
i think i can put up with most mc's
i put up with almost 150 manga chapters of kazuya
time to find out why people call this the worst thing ever
ok
that was some good trash
i wish i could reexperience monmusu
i'll watch ep 1 of both then
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
other than obvious answer
why does the last ep op has sfx? hahaha
haganai thinks it's jojo or what?
that **CAN'T** be a coincidence
because that show also has a nun character named maria takayama
did "i want you to make a disgusted face and show me your panties" stole a character from hagarai?
did...
wait a second
https://tenor.com/view/sabagebu-anime-punch-hit-head-gif-16853383
<:Gun:721558976298483783>
did somebody say sabegebu?
also no purple hair anymore
I think fuutarou unlocked ultra instinct or something

Wtf?
my shildhood
hell, the logo spoils it too
that's true
I love that the cover pretty much spoils the ending of S1
Make a sequel!
<:ShirabeWink:672661604319363103>
You haven’t seen the avatar live action then
<:lul:318546359143759904>
No, I want angelina jolie as chris
~~Live action geah when?~~
Please tell me they sing “i’m a pirate”
I think...
And Yukako...
That’s supposed to be Angelo
Oh...
1...?
Umm....
It’d be easier to count the good live action anime movies
Since rotten tomatoes gave ‘cuties’ a 90%
Idk what to think about critics lately
I thought the last ones flopped
God
Even the last ones?
Transformers was a big hit there
How bad do you have to be to fail in china?
Mulan even failed in China apprently
Serves them right
And the anime improves
At least from what i’ve heard sakurasou’s LN is garbage
Not always true
Danmachi is the most meh thing i’ve ever saw
Except for the minotaur scene
S1 i don’t remember shit
But I remember more stuff from S2
Both are
I just hate one less
But I hate both
I much prefer s2 than s1
Danmachi was ever good?
And then give Amane 4 episodes for some reason
That’s what happens when you try to cram 30 hours worth of routes into a single 24 minute episode
Yumiko and Sachi’s route got destroyed in the anime
VN >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Anime
In that case
The grisaia anime is garbage I’ll tell you that much
i want to see what he does next
learn from him
i kinda want to study him
ichika is so clueless
that it turns out to be fun
but it's so trainwreck-y
and it is...
i expected a train wreck
infinite stratos is kinda fun... tbh
i can't believe i'm saying this but...
-me, after dropping kanokari
"dropping a show it's not a sign of weakness, but a sign of self respect"
and tonikaku cawaii
strike witches 3 ❤️
of "uniforms are optional"
I see this anime follows Nisekoi logic
ah...
i'm going to love her
if she's even remotely like seishirou tsugumi from nisekoi
through youtube
i got spoiled on charlotte
(the other one... i don't remember her name)
and the typical tsundere
the typical princess character (cecilia=
so far i've only met 2
5-6 <-perfect number for harem members
from the OP i can figure out that the harem is 5 girls
i need to know the full harem first
i have not decided on my favorite yet
there's some here and there...

this is **EXACTLY** what I was looking for
remember when i said i wanted a trashy ecchi harem?
3
ichika: everyone in this school is so nice...
Orimura kuuuuun ❤️ let's go eat together!!! ❤️
issei loves everything that has boobs
read Maga-Tsuki for some good ol' polygamy
to seem cool
i just say i do
neither do i
i also have all 291 episodes of DBZ
60 series of 12 episodes each
or...
naruto + shippuden is 720 episodes
you saw them...
it's my question...
why don't you add those...?
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
but i did watch it all tho
indeed
but the rest of the world does
true
and idolmaster
and haganai
and mayo chiki


but i have seen Nisekoi
good try charlotte

i am now one with the cosmos

it seems i have ascended
No one in anime seems to be able to realize a girl is a girl in anime if they’re wearing pants
And that’s girls using pants
I just realized a new best way to hide your identity in anime
Better than superman glasses
and likable
interesting
but arata is you know...
I can’t stop watching
now I know
thank you GuP

What would happen if they gave Toshinou Kyouko a motherfucking **TANK**?
I always wanted to know
you know...
or maybe the mangaka just doesn't want it to be an anime?
i do wonder why studios don't pick up komi tho
i didn't know that
ah I see
what is the difference between OVA and ONA
i always wanted to ask
isn't that the premise of "i want you to make a disgusted face and bla bl abla"

yeah
it made me doubt
but they sound so different
which makes sense...
yeah it took me waaaay too long to realize Neptune and Purple heart have the same voice actress
hmm doesn't seem like it
(neptunia)
is purple heart Maria?
wait
also I am loving Uzume
since Uzume goes from her voice to orange heart voice every other scene
but it makes sense when you hear Uzume and orange heart
i thought maybe they switched it up
JUST LIVING IN THE DATABASE
♥️
WESTIA "YOU CAN HAVE THE PLEASURE TO RESIDE IN THE BOTTOM OF MY HEEL FOR 2 SECONDS, BE GREATFUL PEASANT" CHARTREUX
he doesn't seem all that... normal
what is Otto...?
i am watching it as we speak

Next week on: “Things I did not expect to hear today”
<:CulturedShiroe:671059805623812116>
and called it Lag Horizon
with horrible servers
what if we made an online mmorpg
guys...
**HITS BLUNT**
you have never played a round where my list comes out often
HA!
force of yuri > force of gravity
that:
which leads me to believe
https://tenor.com/view/anime-funny-anime-logic-gif-8850971
the only part i enjoyed was the huge middle finger to physics in ep 2
for 12 episodes
"LOOK AT THESE GIRLS KISSING! AREN'T THEY VERY GAY? LOOK AT THEM KISSING!"
sakura trick is just
https://tenor.com/view/anime-windy-cute-stare-gif-16884119
but are they thiccer than...
you had me at cute anime girls
if that'ts the case then it's ok
that's when i have a problem
(aka sakura trick)
but if the WHOOOOOOOOOOOOLE point is that they're gay
i don't have a problem with the gay
that's the complete opposite of subtle
are they really called yuyu and riri?
It feels like 1000
But god knows
It’s just 12 episodes
Watch all of gamers
I don’t watch anime tho
720 episodes
Watch all of Naruto
**dthe**
<:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
which I guess is a fantastic anime if you have a "muscular girls" fetish
we also have Iwakakeru
but instead of bamboo we have truck kun
that part is obvious
it's based on kaguya's story
i mean
we still don't know
it is still the big take away question for manga readers
and it still hasn't been adressed
but we're 125 chapters into the manga
there's a subplot about ||Tsukasa being an alien probably||
it's just the daily life of a new couple that suddenly got married
don't expect plot or anything resembling that
it's all just wholesome stuff
hmm
then they get to know each other
first they get married
It's a romance backwards
you forgot tonikaku cawaii
thanks crunchyroll
i'd hear myself talk instead of Hachiman
if i wanted to hear a sarcastic, depressing, gave up on life guy talk for 30 minutes
i don't care, Sakuta is miles better
and yes I know Sakuta was inspired by Hachiman
poor man's Sakuta from BGS
dear god no
symphogear and girls und panzer
and in the strike witches discord server they talk about symphogear all the time
I've seen more than once people here talking about strike witches
something weird that i've noticed it's that there are a couple of shows that share a lot of the fanbase
never
I guess not
~~and it's not kaguya~~
one of them is trash

also wow, Kurumi vs Nezuko
but Eriri is one of my favorites as well
of course i'm voting Mai
i mean

AGAINST EACH OTHER
TWO OF MY FAVORITE WAIFUS
NOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!
NOOOOOO
hell i'd take Nariyuki over Fuutarou
HOW IS FUUTAROU NOMINATED FOR ANYTHING?!?!?
also
Reina vs Nao would be lit
it'd be closer
if it was Reina...
damn
you mean kumiko oumae?
by kumiko
wait
I'M SO FUCKING ON THIS!!!!!
TOMORI NAO IS IN THIS?!?!?!
he's so hot because he wants to kill himself
that never happens cypher
WHAT?! are you implying that mexicans like to upvote to no end stuff they like so that they swey votes into their favor?
BUT **MASSIVE** in latinamerica
Inuyasha is one of those shows that's big in the world
oh trust me
thanks
found it
what's it called?
i didn't know that was a thing
what sequel!?
why is Inuyasha suddenly popular again?
also
almost as many as the 100000000 Sakuras
there's like 5000000 different Kaguya's in anime
you don't know Kaguya?
I can't choose

have i been rpesented with such a hard question before
never in my life
the movie is so good

unpopular opinion
nah she's just flat
Azusa is going to be voiced by Aoi Yuuki
also Biki will be the mc here
<@!676272618839605249> Animegataris
It looks very fun
Just ep 2
But sometimes they say a title that is like 3 animes combined
I think i’m getting like 50% of the references
Yup
It’s good to know some anime still follow it
I call this the **HARUHI LAW**
sure have a good day!
and Daewi and Mira are not that interesting imo
and Goku and Jin have very little outside of random shonen protag
yeah you change a couple of things and boom new character, but that doesn't mean we can't point out the similarities
idk if the original tale of son goku is depicted like that tbh
but they're also not very bright
and get really mad when they attack their friends
and they're both heavy eaters
even tho they're based on the same thing
the Goku in High School DxD feels different
i really doubt Mori didn't take **HEAVY** inspiration from DBZ Goku
there's no difference between their characters
But Goku...
...you do realize Jin Mori is just Goku right?
seeing your favorite battles animated
I guess you could enjoy this fine
i guess if you were already a fan of the manhwa
this was me the entire time
it feels more like the writters were like: "what is a plot?"
but in GOH's case
I feel sometimes an anime is like "where's the plot?"
in my opinion at least
which is superb
but GOH's only good point is the animation
probably
and I want my time back
It's one of the absolute worst anime I've seen all year
I finally finished GOH
Hayasaka
same
https://tenor.com/view/hikikomori-keijo-anime-gif-9371235
and i'd watch it a 4th
I have watched Keijo 3 times now
yup
than being average
sometimes it's better to be awful
sounds about right
yup
i usually like her archetype
but I enjoy Ryuu
yeah danmachi is incredibly bland
the first op for danmachi is actually the worst thing ever
another pokemon?
https://tenor.com/view/pokemon-decidueye-gif-17990473
(Decidueye)
but they act quite similar
Ryuu and Hayasaka not only look similar
nah
probably the only good thing about danmachi
Ryuu from danmachi
Better Hayasaka

It’s a shitpost more than it is an anime
Popuko has 51 different voice actors
https://myanimelist.net/character/148256/Popuko
the moment you realize
i probably did tbh haha
I posted my basa figure here?
Hahaha that’s why I said it waa not hard to guess

But it is a figure
If it was a symphogear figure i would posy it in the symphogear chat
It’s easier than you think
Guess what I bought
the drums are fucking great tho
the animation looks a bit weird but the song is very good
I like the drums a lot
let me hear the OP i like shonen OPs
hmm
you think?
but david production fixed it
with cgi even worse than brave witches
and it looked like shit
i remembered when the op for road to berlin came out
but a great ed
iwakakeru has a meh OP
shows or OP's?
i have heard it an unhealthy amount of times
SW:RtB's OP is by fav witches OP so far
i don't think it fits the show
this is just a "me" thing
i know it's loved by many
actually the op is the one thing i didn't like
thankfully it actually is a good adaptation
when the tonikaku anime was announced I was hyped af and told people to watch it
he was fun
except Rak
tbh I couldn't care less for the characters in TOG
<:smart:638489064009629697>
so that people stopped asking for them
made horrible anime adaptations
the anime industry took webtoons
i mean... kinda... you just have to erase every other romcom from existence
that rent a girlfriend was the best romcom of the generation
i remember when the crunchyroll youtube channel said in a post
and the manga gets incredibly repetitive
it's a shit show
love that anime
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
<:simp:772812589234126879>
i heard if you watched 2 eps of kanokari in a row you develop sakuya syndrome
you madman
<:MaiOfCulture:655558829668433930>
R8 my level of simp
Yeah that’s ~~Tinri~~

My evidence:
My theory: Green Scythe = Best Girl
does deku also grow a tail?
i'd be concerned if he didn't
tru




i just realized strike witches ripped off MHA


the final 2 episodes
o got confused
the ending of the show
no i meant
not the ending song
i mean how the show ends
the ending is a mess tho
very catchy
Haruhi

she truly is a pup
https://tenor.com/view/one-piece-swim-strike-witches-gif-13187103
and that's when it hit me
she doesn't have animal e-
hey that figure is wrong

i was like
hahah
and i just noticed this
i have been watching witches for half a year
the black bangs are supposed to be erica's animal ears...
every character in this anime grows animal ears and tail when they use their magic power
I JUST GOT WHAT'S HAPPENING
**wait wait wait wait wait**
wait
wait
when she uses her strike unit she grows animal ears and a tail
actually the second pose is wrong
nope
**FUCK YOU**


OH I KNOW LET'S CHECK THE NENDO!
it changes based on whatever the hell the artists feels at that particular time


**YES**


Strike Witches:
Me: What is Erica Hartmann's haircolor?

I mean it is, but it’s clearly the wrong manga
Because the first one is not on my manga app
I@will look into those two tomorrow
Nope
But I also wanted a more light hearted yuri
It’s interesting
I will continue this ine
I didn’t expect the urban legend monsters tbh
I’ll check it out
<:rage:651253812329316382> <:rage:651253812329316382> <:rage:651253812329316382>
THE FIRST CHAPTWR HAS 92 PAGES
No clue hahah

Is that the one?
I found isekai picnic
I don’t think I have
Gimme some yuri manga
I am in the mood for yuri

This anime summarized in one sentence:
this show is gay
the other one is gay
one is gay
in owari no seraph there's two characters:
Always has been
Tonikaku kawaii
I jsut didn’t expect it to happen in the anime
They name drop in the manga too
This is usually the part where they change the name to Street Brawler

Actually a product placement
I call this
**THIS IS WINTER 21?!?!?!**

CHRIST!!!

This made me laugh a lot for some reason

I am loving it so far
Shirobako is great
Damn
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
<:Mio:647868305356619786>
~~**THIS JOKE HAS NEVER BEEN DONE BEFORE**~~

But I’ve seen people say she’s the worst of the anglerfish team
I mean, which gup girl doesn’t?
Very underrated
But I never see people talking:
I see people talk Katyusha, Maho, Kei (which I don’t blame them), Miho, Anchovy, Alice, Yukari

So far yeah
Tatenashi is not in S1
Only because Tatenashi exists
Season 2 so far to me it’s a 4/10
a perfectly respectable 6/10
it was...fine
also S1 wasn't completely awful
i am sort of a masochist
<:EricaSmug2_Boost:599506383561555988>
i want my money back
but she doesn't save the season
that Tatenashi is probably the best of the harem
I will give credit
the writing is awful
it is
i watched infinite stratos 2 to see if it really was worse than a lobotomy
And I want to see if that’s the case buuuuut I need to watch everything prior
I am watching it because even people who hate SAO say Alicization is pretty good
Or the plot points
It’s not like I am watching SAO for the plot twist
<:AstoSmug:588708219229175809> Says who?
and remembering the dialogues of the abridged is hilarious
it's even funnier because this show takes itself too seriously
i can't watch SAO without making SAO abridged references

help
WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING HERE?!

Ngl, some parts of log horizon were really boring
Fuck that
Except One piece
And I’m mostly watching sao because I decided to give some classics a shot
Because abridged
Everything from the first game is already been spoiled for me
So far, it’s been good
I have just seen 2 episodes
It’s not like I have never seen an anime with one
I can deal with boring mc’s tbh
So far my only problem is that it seems like it’s taking itself way to seriously
GGO and the other things
If I happen to like it then I would watch the other stuff
S2 and then alicization
I might do that
also why do i feel this episode was incredibly rushed?
The patron saint of prostitues
oh god...
i hit 300 completed

i forgot to say it
also!
and youtube
4kids*
they were both so close to abridge it all
both series ended on the last part
it feels bad
but damn
it's more of a health thing with little kuriboh
but YGOTAS has been dormant for 2 years
and little kuriboh has not confirmed it
it is confirmed
yeah
*looks at TFS and LK*
at least they keep abridging
it will be like this all the way to the second game
GODDAMIT
**WE MUST SAVE MY FAMILY**
i might give it a read
if the source material is good, I might check it out
"Evassiness" type magic is something i've never seen in other anime
were pretty unique
the magic types they presented
i will admit
but!
the anime begs you to do so
how could you not?
when the mc started fighting a dude with a giant ass sword with a wooden kendo one and it wasn't breaking and it was also making metal on metal sound effects I was like "ok brain switched off"
Episode 2: 
-You wanna join our school?
-No... yes
yup
i won't blame you hahaha
it is a "turn your brain off" kind of anime
it's called Mahou Sensou
and I ended up liking it...
also I started watching an anime that has a 6.0 on MAL
but it ended up giving me endless 8 flashbacks
i know they did that to show you how they were learning
to me the problem is that they showed too many failed attempts
i know they wanted you to feel that you were in the raid with Shiroe and the rest
the raid battle to me was kinda boring
Sounds like all out war
damn
But I am guessing the next arc will be about them looking for a way to get back home
I am an anime only
I don’t know what comes next tbh
Probably the band wanted more money
I know
<:saaad:591387558617940188>
But it won’t have database
<:villain:591645521412882442>
E
S
A
B
A
T
A
D
I would have to watch it all
I much rather have OG producer
So far, i don’t agree
Quit then! Nobody will miss you. Rin is the only good part about CG anyway
“Oh no my first concert was only mildly successful, I will quit!”
God what a crybaby Mio is
I’ll watch until ep 10
It’s not good
<:DONE:602895899022065674>
I can’t with Cinderella Girls
<:DONE:602895899022065674>
I can’t... it’s too funny
Heeeeeey T-dawg, what is up in this... hishouse?
You have the absolute **WORST** fake guitar playing I have ever seen ever
Congrats BanG dream
And I reaaaaaaaaaaaly don’t like Mio after ep 6
The rest ones I don’t care about
Anastasia and Rin are cute
Ranko seems like lesser Takane
Take a shot
But everytime they say kirakira
Bandori
And not just in their concerts
In the fact that it looks like a Wii U game
The thing I am more scared about in S2 is the animation
I can’t wait
<:EricaSmug2_Boost:599506383561555988>
What about S2?
Not bad tbh, I hear it gets really good in S3
I wanted to watch an idol show and Cinderella Girls was boring af
Tfw you have a singular tooth in the middle of your mouth

Yeah... in pokemon there’s a fish that evolves into an octopus
Wait a sec, SONG wants to know my location
What if symphogear is the missing link between CG and Bandori?
Sure why not
<:MaiOfCulture:655558829668433930>
Makes too much sense


The one thing I wqnt to know is why characters in bandori all have Geass eyes
It is
^fr tho, my eyes

High school dxd hero? <:EricaSmug2_Boost:599506383561555988>
Oregairu?
I will start it as soon as I finish S2
If I look at it as if it was a PS3 game things get better
I’m just not used to it
It isn’t
Which should be harder to do in 3D
They have a lot of personality and funny expressions
Even if they’re fully CGI
But I got to admit
So i’ll have to adjust
Which I’m not
S2 looks weird if you’re not used to full CGI anime
That^
And this is what happens when I’m awake at 6 am
<:EricaSmug2_Boost:599506383561555988>
Since god sent jesus to basically another world
Technically the bible has isekai elements
Everything is an isekai if you try hard enough
<:nepsmug:574386228548599838>
Also digimon is an isekai
Pokemon can never be this metal
Look at this shit

Pokemon can’t
Also digimon can devolve
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
Digital monsters?
Are you saying that they are like
“Agu agu! Agumon!!!”
Fucking agumon
Hahahaha

Rokka is cute ngl
**JESUS FUCKING CHRIST**

The wedding dress episode
It felt like when I watched the original idolmaster episode 8
The anime went from 0 to 1000 in an episode
HHW is just insane
It’s idol bands
I am having fun so far
And thanks!
It does
On ep 5 of S2
And here I am
Which I was missing 3 eps
And planned just to finish S1
I woke up at 3 am
I think people don’t like it because the focus is not really on PopiPa as much
So far the other groups are great
One shot everytime they say kirakira
<:EricaSmug2_Boost:599506383561555988>
I’ll do the drinking game
If i ever rewatch this anime
It’s fucking nutz and I love it
Why do people hate this season?!
This episode alone was better than anything in S1
<:rage:651253812329316382>
And Kaoru was Joker
**YES**
<:rage:651253812329316382>
What the fuck even was this episode?
I did not want them to literally go into Shido’s palace

Hahahahahahaha
I was just joking
Fuck
WAIT NO
Huh, it seems PopiPa are getting a change of heart

I am really liking this group
I have no idea what just happened but I kinda liked it

Tae makes me laugh too much tbh

If it wasn’t for Tae and Arisa, Rokka would probably be my fav girl
<:ShemHaTilt:729980149529051156>
And the writing is still on par with porn
Fate started as porn so...
I mean
<:SakutaSmug:655558829852983299>
Supposedly it will just have 16 eps
Tfw the manga ends after the anime supposedly
If Michelle ever leaves, Misaki could replace her

<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>

I suck at derivatives
I like half calc <:rage:651253812329316382>
Derivation is a nightmare
At least more fun than derivation
True
Alternatively it could also mean that the show gets unnecessarily complicated and not fun at all
Maybe the integrals are there to symbolize that they are adding varibles in the story
I like your explanation more
Even tho many anime have done that bullshit lately
That or... Bibury just tought it look cute and wanted it to look “original” instead of just using the number 2
<:EricaSmug2_Boost:599506383561555988>
It is a metaphor for the quints were all Itsuki at first and by integrating them you start to get variations in regards to x, and if you derivate them you eventually reach the singularity that is Itsuki

Which answer besides the double integration of the original equation in regards to the variable of choice (which in the next example will be x) will also add a Cx + D
It’s a double integral
Another one for my evergrowing Rem figure collection

by using a pic of a vegetable
calls emilia shit
But yeah medabots
I thought it was called Medarot in japan
Medarot
<:EricaSmug2_Boost:599506383561555988>
I am going to bed before the shit storm arrives
Oh god what have i done
aren't figures just expensive and fragile toys?
but beyblade for example?
maybe not figures
every anime is a commercial for something else i swear
i can't wait for hello happy world to make the next yuru yuri op
nice
♻️
a song made in an anime is used as an OP for an unrelated anime?
Sacred world is the OP for Assault Lily?
wait wtf
🇴 2️⃣

*leaves*
**symphogear was made to sell disks**
<:MaiSmug:655558829949583364>
I’m going to bed
Also I wasn’t lying haha
They were fun
They also later made toys with interchangeable parts
my life is both
<:SakutaSmug:655558829852983299>
shall i tell you my life story then?
<:PareoThink:672351031023239191>
Sad ~~Shirabe~~ Pareo
Happy ~~Shirabe~~ Pareo
Remember that time Hibiki was loli Hitler?
Remember that time Yukari from GuP was an idol?
Remember the time Shirabe was a keyboard player for the band that did the Assault Lily Bouquet op?
<:ShirabeStare:582381430915596289>

<:ShirabeMad:688188118087499792>
i think
gear
hahaha
oh
roughly 16
lemme check
hmm
haha
Bang Dream
Shirabe, stay in your anime


at least imo
god no
imagine thinking Kanokari is better than Tomozaki kun
god


**PANZER VOOOOOR**
sorrry I had class
yeh
oh wow it's almost as it was a very predictable anime
yeah
if fanservice was good or bad
and only one thing
because they disagreed on one thing
and he dumps her in the same episode
gamers
Tomozaki grew in one episode what Hachiman grew in 3 seasons
~~but done right~~
Tomozaki reminds me of Hachiman
he's just awful all around
nah
who just complains every episode until he gets the girl somehow
https://tenor.com/view/isshiki-iroha-oregairu-hikigaya-hachiman-snafu-my-teen-romantic-comedy-gif-6161074
unlike:
i will do today
i've yet to watch that
it has some funny lines here and there
but imo it's nowhere near as bad as Kanokari
not great
i think tomozaki is fine enough
i didn't watch any of these except Eikouzen which i dropped

gimme a sec
Me: I've literally watched 0 of these shows...
Crunchyroll: Here are your nominees for best anime of the year!
yeh
you know... the only actual couple on the nominees
I voted Tsukasa-Nasa
the Jin Mori vs Park Il Pyo is like the **ONLY** amazing scene from GOH
i voted bakarina for best girl

and they didn't even include the best fight
the **ONE** category where I was going to vote GOH

The fact that you could make a nomination solely on best anime of winter 2021
it's literally my opinion
it's not wrong
is beastars good?
https://tenor.com/view/ken-jeong-community-too-small-to-read-read-reading-gif-5494204
and this is the last one

so i am voting for the actual couple
One i didn't watch (beastars)
One is from another season (kaguya)
In another one the dude hates her (in spectre)
And the other two are ships

it wasn't that good
yesterday is the only show i've watched from best drama
i didn't watch it




why is princess connect there?
yeah wtf?
^the only thing I think GOH could win


so i can't really vote
^i don't watch en dubs




**AND GUESS WHAT**
but she's a simp magnet
i agree
Chizuru is going to win anyway


if MHA deserves one award this year it's best villain
and Overhaul is my fav MHA villain
i didn't watch dorohedoro
Two of these aren't really antagonists

he was so over the top it was actually amaznig
Anos was fun ngl

Nor do i know anyone that has
I’ve never had amnesia before
Good question
Ah yes because amnesia makes you forget how to human
In a teenager’s body
He was a fetus
Not even a baby
But he was literally a baby
I know
I dropped it halfway into ep 1
I couldn’t stand the mc at all
Idk why princess connect is as popular as it is
And as such you can’t give two shits if they win or lose
Is that the fighting is always between two characters you know nothing about
The thing about GOH
Like with me and the ending of the quints manga
At least you can laugh at how bad it is
At least you’ll remember it
It’s better to be god awful than not interesting tbh
<:KirikaCry:674720015047720961>
More dess inside
<a:KirikaHyperFish:726644338309726218>
What about this fish?
Make me <:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
The whole Grimlock episodes for example
There’s a couple of things that unironically the abridged did better
I gotta say
As i’m watching SAO
Because you only care about the animation and the figh scenes
It’s better to watch it that wqy
Yeah
They introduced too much stuff near the end that just made everything confusing
I felt the same as when i watched the second season of owari no seraph
I didn’t know who was fighting who
I understoon nothing by the end
Yeah
Yeah i’ve heard that
I don’t even want to bother with manwha adaptations at this point
Yeah it was the most disappointing
Really sums up last year perfectly
And it would look better than the nominations of all of 2020
If you did
It’s not satisfactory if you didn’t read the manga
Oh
But wait
You wanna make him go through that torture?
Wanna be spoiled? Or nah?
...hopefully
Maybe the anime will have an original ending
I know
Huge bruh moment
Yeah
Shhh
Marge: Sorry force of habit, Ichika nooo!!!
Araragi: What did I do?
Araragi no!!!
Haha I was quoting the abridged
**WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU’RE DOING?!**

No Plankton
U is for U and Meeee
And F is for the friends you do stuff together
Tengen Popa Nurren Lagan
<:SerenaDizzy:736605371912945736>
<:noU:671609448166326303>
<:EricaSmug2_Boost:599506383561555988>
Not the full on genre
I would at least say gear needs idol tags
Gear is the reason i said idol-ish
Symphogear?
I will eventually
<:MikuJoy:738234684655403110>
Weird how i’ve seen 3-ish idol anime but not the most popular one
I haven’t seen love live yet
<@207452640886521859>
Let’s try it...
*Irina*
And i’m halfway through CG
Then the og IM@S
I’ve seen bandori full
I haven’t seen love live yet
You got me into D4DJ
Thanks bandori
Which apparently it’s a subgenre for some reason
But I also want to watch cute girls from mobile games do music 100% in CGI
I also need to watch Jujutsu Kaizen
It’s like i’m reading the source material after i enjoyed the anime so much
<:MaiOfCulture:655558829668433930>
For watching the abridged first?
Horny jail time
<a:ShirabeBonk:801207951645605958>
Where they literally have sex?
Not one scene earlier
<:MikuDelete:661660028410920990>
Before it ended
It was already dead
I hope so
The worst manga ending imo has to be nanatsu no taizai
<:nepsmug:574386228548599838>
The second worst manga ending i’ve read
<:SakutaSmug:655558829852983299>
It’s even worse
Re zero season 2 if Garfiel didn’t exist
Re zero season 2
Yup
I’ve seen some of the girls in the mudae and they look nice
Is it good?
<:KirikaCry:674720015047720961>
i'm sorry
af
boring...
it's...

Done
i got a mistake
wait

and 2 spinoffs
9 actually
but in those 2 minutes they include 24 min episodes worth of content
it's 2 minutes per episode
https://tenor.com/view/anime-teekyuu-pervert-gif-10023320
^
It's more like CGDLSD
Teekyuu isn't CGDCT
https://tenor.com/view/anime-jumping-boing-bounces-lewd-gif-13037122
it's dumbell's older shittier brother
Anitore
hahaha
the other one
no
there's the training anime haha
OH FUCK THIS HAHAHAHAH

also there's k-on
but it has enough male characters to make me doubt
it's mostly a female cast
i have doubts
Nichijou...
Symphogear is not really CGDCT
K-on is the original CGDCT
since D4DJ is already here
this list was made recently
those are CBDGS
unless they're male idols
yup, pretty much
pretty much every idol show is CGDCT

indeed
Episode 7 of Charlotte is a masterpiece tho
^Spoilers for Assclass
And the other scene is ||Koro sensei's death||
when the soldier says: ||"Father, mother. If god could grant me a wish. I want to be reborn as your son again"||
Episode 11 of Violet Evergarden
only 2 scenes in anime can make me cry every single time without fail
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfCuQpRxgWE&ab_channel=CrunchyrollCollection
the laptop scene
ep 10
https://tenor.com/view/smug-kay-kaykay-anime-kou-gif-13859196
i like Hajime and Kou more
3rd best
best girl
unpopular opinion
https://tenor.com/view/hajime-shinoda-new-game-grumpy-pouty-anime-gif-12504725
https://tenor.com/view/hifumi-new-game-anime-gif-6062473
THIS
it's fun!
i'd say either New Game, K-On or Gabriel Dropout would be the best CGDCT anime
if i had to be completely objective
...i am listening...
it absolutely is
i haven't seen that one
i actually thought you were gonna point out Keijo's placement haha
it felt like nothing ever happened that made me remember
but i can't remember a lot of stuff from Koisuru
except some bits of character development for Monroe-senpai
they were never challanged
and i didn't feel like the characters in Koisuru had to change in any way
but if you compare the characters at the beginning and at the end of a SOL they should've grown in some way
it seems like nothing happens
SOLs are fun
bad excuse
imo it's the most forgettable CGDCT i've ever seen
ever
but nothing happened
maybe i was too harsh
is the clannad VN good?
we all do
don't forget, alive
also alive
Jun, there's 1 chapter left...
ok we should wrap up in 4 more chapters
Jun Maeda is always like
when a ||bunch of characters suddenly were like: K-BYE||
i was more talking about the parts before
and then the last episodes happen
Angel Beats and Charlotte are so close to being perfect
My 2nd fav girl in any anime
https://tenor.com/view/charlotte-nao-tomori-anime-happy-dance-gif-14046315
is probably one of my fav scenes in anime of all time
this scene
then it goes downhill for the rest of the show
the hardest and saddest first 10 minutes to watch in any anime
kotoura san
https://tenor.com/view/jon-tron-what-what-the-fuck-wtf-surprised-gif-4633333
then the last 4 minutes of ep 1 are like:
Idoly Pride's first 20 minutes are kinda meh
I advise you to ignore them
You will see sequels to that game
Either that or get into your steam account and play Grisaia no Kajitsu
And the girls are great too
The best harem mc bar none
My fav harem is God only knows
But the anime does nothing with them
Date a live has fun girls
And the girls are not good enough to compensate
IS has an abysmal mc
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
But it’s definitely not for the whole family
Dxd has a good mc and top girls
But has a piece of wood as mc
Saekano has great girls
But only medium to good girls
Trinity Seven has a great mc
Seriously... Rin... you're not fooling anyone
Kotono Nagase...
I meaaaaaan...
Rin Shibuy-
They made me hate the shy archetype as a whole
Like Hinata Hyuga
Onodera is one of those characters who’s whole personality is “shy”
She’s my worst girl from that series
Not a fan
Ew
I respect your choices
As long as you are not team Onodera
In the anime she sucks
...IN THE MANGA
Marika is also fun

And also kill you very easily
She can make you blush

Za blush

**TSUGUMI YOU BEAUTIFUL BEAUTIFUL BEING**
Hey one of my fav girls of all time comes from Nisekoi
Re L yeah
Rumia i don’t think...
But nah
Re=L
Maybe
Or I guess
No prob
It is very clear who the only love interest is
Rokudenashi is not really a harem tbh
You’ve watched a good amount of harem fantasy shows
**IF**
Misfit of demon king academy is very fun
Specially for a harem
S3 is art
That doesn’t make it any less harem
She’s like if Laura Bodewig was 500% more fun and 800% more thirsty

And best girl Oboro
Indeed
The anime didn’t do it justice
Boarding School Juliet
As for manga
Yamada kun is a great time
Yamada kun!
I forgot
Fuck
OH!
Specially because I absolutely despise Hachiman
<:MaiOfCulture:655558829668433930>
So that’s ok
The thing is, it did Minogatari and Oregairu better imo
I have no problem admiting Rascal copied Monogatari and Oregairu
<:MaiSmug:655558829949583364>
Normiemonogatari > Regular monogatari
<:SakutaSmug:655558829852983299>
Seishun Buta Yarou
Btw
Minori
And Taiga is the absolute best example of one
A lot of people hate aggresive tsunderes
More than Toradora
They hate Taiga
Well
But I love it
Everyone hates toradora
Mayo chiki is the closest thing
If you want to see Tsugumi’s route
Mayo Chiki is also good
Grisaia no Kajitsu exists
Again
But that’s cause I hate all the kanokari girls except for Mini
Same reason why i can’t stand Sumi in kanokari
Besides
But it’s faaaaar from my immediate plan to watch
Maybe one day

That by the end of the series you were either team miku or team nino
It was no secret
After a certain arc that will be adapted in the anime
There’s a reason she went from most hated to having as big of a fanbase as Miku
I’d say wait for the end of the season
Haha
Nino?
Which of the 5?
Gtg, sleepy time
I haven’t seen oreimo
With the obligatory archetypes
It’s easy to follow but still does the harem formula
I think quints is a great beginner harem series
We like different things
And if we go only by S2 the winner should be my girl
So that should leave S2 to decide a winner
And I doubt it’s going to get a s3
It’s almost confirmed that it will have an original ending
Actually for that reason I have high hopes for Quints
It loses traction **INSANELY** fast
That’s what happenss when a harem ends
It’s not gonna happen
Ywah i know

And best girl Leon Inugami
Boarding School Juliet
So i can get best girl animated
BSJ needs at least one more season
Cachi cachi cachi cachi cachi cachi

I like Hikari
Mej
It’s been in my PTW since forever
I need to watch that show

A chuunibyo dullahan
Indeed
My girl

Culture

You want culture??
And Chisaki of course

I have a soft spot for Hibari tbh
(If you read the manga)
Who are also cousins
In yuragi’s case you have 2 tsunderes
But the sequels are good enough that it’s fine
I will admit that this season is 95% sequels
Guess you’re unpopular now
But oh no, you lost in smash to this dude
Like: “oh hey you are very popular, all the girls love you”
Jaku chara however is very weird how smash bros is apparently the most important thing ever
If the main characters have enough chemistry
Sometimes a good romance can be light in regards to drama
I like it
Meh
Jaku-chara is fun if you want a more light hearted Oregairu
I need to finish D4DJ
Meh
Is that McHitler?
I am also enjoying Jaku-chara
And Horiyima
Winter 21 is all about the seasonals
I don’t even think there were more than 12 anime
What tf were you watching last season?
And i gave up on nanatsu
Non non biyori
And that’s only because I didn’t watch slime
I’m watching 11 seasonals
This season is fucking insane
World Witches: Take Off
Yes
<:SakutaSmug:655558829852983299>
But it’s not trash
It’s trashy
Indeed. I am looking forward to everything this season. Promised Neverland so far yeah little has occured
nah it sounds like another VA
yeah but i don't play JP
i need to youtube this
With that voice?
You want her to voice a loli?
Only Yukari could laugh that dorky
That’s Yukari
Yup
I heard Maya’s voice and i was like
It’s like also in Bang dream
And you’re just like “yup, that’s Maria”
**OI RAN!!**
<:TomoeReally:688954887806910577>
And Tomoe from Bang Dream
<:thats_hot:651252050172182529>
❤️❤️❤️
Who is just
But she also voices Diana Cavendish
<:HinaHigh:684601998481293445>
...so they can’t all be winners
And Houki Shinonono
And Rias Gremory
No U
after seeing that many spiders?
Youtube: OK HERE! LET ME FILL UP YOUR FEED WITH GIANT FUCKING SPIDERS!
me: no... i am aracnophobic...
Youtube: WHAT WAS THAT? YOU WANNA SEE VIDEOS ABOUT FUCKING GIANT ASS TARANTULAS???
me: ok let's at least watch the op for the spider anime, maybe it's good
<:thats_hot:651252050172182529>
https://tenor.com/view/villian-in-glasses-gif-18084561
Miyamura is slowly but surely turning into Shiroe

i think she's the same va
now that i hear it like that
kinda...?
hmm
you'll see...
but still an angel
an angel that escaped from Initial D
is an angel ❤️
and the main character Aoi Miyamori
It's one of my favorite anime of all time
it is!
i could be wrong
but imo at least it in part follows the formula
true
it is not 100% a CGDCT
you can find a lot of similarities between CGDCT and shirobako
not necesarilly imo
how does that sound?
between Wotakoi and New Game
Shirobako is like a middle ground
more than it does New Game
and it reminds me a lot to Wotakoi
of course it also has Drama
most f the main characters are girls
at least in part
but i'll argue it **IS** CGDCT
indeed
there's guys
it's mostly CGDCT
specially because it's one of the only 15 shows in MAL that i've given a 10/10
i recommend it a lot
who just can't get an opportunity in the industry
specially with one of the main 5 girls
there's a bit of depression
but with a little more "oh cruel reality"
it's new game but with anime
yeah basically
in the movie they're all in their mid 20's
also it's one of the only CGDCT anime I know where they're not in highschool
maybe in a cute anime dances compilation
that scene is Shirobako
https://tenor.com/view/shirobako-anime-girl-silly-dancing-gif-17536570
have you ever seen this dance?
it's an anime about making anime
Shirobako
noooope
Cute girls doing anime
CGDCT
the first is Maho from D4DJ
Misa from Shirobako

I knew that Maho looked familiar...
<:HinaHigh:684601998481293445>
**PLANE**
...
It was not bad but it was very
I watched the first ep
FlugzeugMädchen
Planegirls
To complete the triforce
We really need tank girls
She’s represented by Dess
I’m surprised Kirika isn’t represented with sunflowers
Actually
Also Oresuki
~~they all are, every single deredere in existence is represented by sunflowers~~
That’s what i’m talking about
There we go!

Oh and a sunflower as hair ornament
And she’s good to go
Like Himawari
She only needs a more fitting name
Honoka looks like the default character when you pick “Deredere”
Kaicho
So that we have girls und panzer **UND PANZERMÄDCHEN**
When do we get girls that are tanks
But not the movie
I knew about the ova
It has a movie?
Better
**MUCH**
Much
Haifuri is better...
I am watching both at the same time actually
**UUUUUMMMMM**

My mom: what you doin?
Me: oh you know, whatching an anime about boats.
My mom: oh great, but where are the boats?
Me: ...
Of course

Do we have car girls?
Or less
0.1M?
But at which concentration?
even at low concentrations it's dangerous
Sulfuric acid is pretty much poison
senku said it himself
i mean
It will be fun
I’ll have to see what di I do these year for my thesis
I’d rather headache than burns
I mean
Good ol’ death

From the first second she was on screen
Yeah I absolutely loved her

But this:
It’s been long since I found a girl I saw and I immediately fall in love with her
Big boobs Himeko noooo
Yeah
And redhead
Twintails
Did you say...
And some even both
hinata won best boy
but she can
i don't know about it
and Horimiya
and have better candidates
the fact that we could have a best anime of 2021 so far
so it's steampunk part 7 jojo
it makes **ZERO** sense
then why did Hinata win best boy?!
if their logic is "because it's a season 2"
also why wasn't re zero nominated?
what the fuck is appare ranman?
no one was really talking about any of the nominees
and apart from a little bit of jujutsu kaisen
i watched none of the nominated shows
i wouldn't know
*Now pretend to care*
Jujutsu kaisen wins best anime of 2020
same
Female Issei*
if only the animation didn't make my eyes bleed
it's alright
please
BRAVE witches
Hikari's sister from Brave Witches
i know you were expecting that joke
and yes
https://tenor.com/view/brave-witches-strike-witches-gif-19510192
*WICHI*
yep
also we'll have OP witch Bikki
oh man i love the manga of this
in haikyuu's 4th season
I can see what Seijaku Muhai no Bahamut ripped off
It was alright
I watched the first ep of Chivalry of the Failed Knight
How many batmans do you need?
**S O R D**, Akeno, Kaiba and Yukiko for me
it makes the same amount of sense with or without context
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GM1mUEIn9c&ab_channel=Aen97
and it's a fucking pun

teekyuu unironically had one of the first mexican characters i ever saw in anime
exactly
episode 101
the episode where they go to see other clubs
season 9 episode 5
found it
A teekyuu movie would be the lenght of an regular episode
there are some episodes that i think are downright hilarious
and people think Pop team epic is weird
https://tenor.com/view/anime-teekyuu-pervert-gif-10023320
also 2 spin offs
so you're cultured now
Keijo is the best thing ever
It doesn’t have as much ecchi as you might think
Weirdly enough
Indeed
Because that’s how it works
There’s also a technique where one girl pulls her bathing suit all the way up to get speed of light
and america was like: "SAY NO MORE!!!"
yeah, the creators basically said "yeah do whatever you want with it, we don't care"
adn you don't know if it's a meme or real
you see that gif
ghost stories is oen show that
https://tenor.com/view/cute-happy-scooby-snack-ghost-stories-anime-gif-14322474
or ghost stories
this is the gif i was looking for
https://tenor.com/view/assassination-classroom-nagisa-gif-5787011
https://tenor.com/view/nagisa-assassination-classroom-anime-anime-smile-anime-grin-gif-19221356
it also has best girl
The moment when you have a character literally refered as "Bitch sensei" and you're like "yeah ok that makes sense"
https://tenor.com/view/anime-manga-assassination-classroom-irina-bitch-sensei-gif-19236445
this^
I completely recomend it if you want to watch something that consistently gets better with each chapter
Assclass is my 2nd fav anime of all time
You’re deciding what to watch?
hearing someone call another person "Sakura-**SAN**" (for example) sounds weird in english and spanish
i'd say newer dubs are **TOO** faithful for my taste
actually
they just changed the name of the town
at least naruto was fairly faithful
"Hello my name is Jimmy Hero, and I study at the Hero School, and with the help of my teacher Super-Muscle I will become the greatest hero of them all!"
imagine if they still did that
Imagine people telling you Tyson Granger is actually called Takao Kinomiya
And even the dubbed once became more faithful
Anime in the original language more common
With the passing years dubs became less common
Yeah
Metabee could turn into a car in S2 for some reason
Then it stopped midway
S2 started
I think the same happned with medabots actually
And that’s the most we got in mexico
Then that thing happened
I remember they ended it in the semifinals
Nice
And that’s it
I just remember the mc’s bdman got destroyed
Why did it never finished?
Yeah what happened to bdaman?
indeed
i've never watched metal or burst
(i mean the og btw)
suddenly Tyson is on the floor in one scene
and that one is censored too
youtube is uploading beyblade dubs one chapter ever 2 days
that's adorable
she literally voices Victini
but i doubt Hinata could stand a chance against Sasori either
I know that Pain is much stronger than Sasori
and Sakura actually took down a member of Akatsuki
Hinata's best fight was against Pain and she barely stood a chance
i don't get people that say Hinata did more than Sakura to be honest
i don't detect **S O R D**
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmNa8SWGm4A&ab_channel=JuRIHaNAlphA
yeah she's Hinata
and I couldn't
because i went back to Naruto and tried to hear Tsubasa in Hinata
for Nana actually I think she does a fine job at VA
but for Tomoe they just picked Maria again
which it's mostly fairly unknown voice actors
it also happened in Bang dream
everytime I was like "why is maria stripping?"
i couldn't take Rias Gremory seriously
it also happens with Maria's VA
yeah
it specially applies to Dio
i can't take them seriously
that when i hear their voice in another role
some people are so fantastic for a role
you know what's distracting?
if someone says "it's the biggest anime of the last decade" i wouldn't disagree tbh
at least you have to consider it one of the biggest no doubt
it's probably the biggest of the last decade
since the manga is ending in 2 more chapters
nah, another 12 episodes will do
but it's impossible for them to cover all the manga at this pace
they haven't announced it
also there's gonna be part 2
S4 would've started with at least 3 whole episodes on political talk
if the anime was truly faithful
the manga is worse
||oh no wait you're not. You're dead||
Sasha are you feeling ok?

shit
it doesn't help that the drawings are...
yeah
i need to see videos on experts of AoT to explain each manga chapter to me
the manga was always confusing to me
Attack on titan's anime is much better than the manga
believe it or not
sometimes the anime is better than the source material
same thing with anime itself
some english voice actors are better than the original
https://tenor.com/view/diana-cavendish-gif-19545787
best girl
which in fact **IS**
oh yeah she's Diana there
https://tenor.com/view/houki-shinonono-infinite-stratos-gif-18789542
she also voices Infinite Stratos' worst girl
so it's another "Dio" kind of situation for me
i'd like Maria's VA if it wasn't for the fact that she speaks the same in every role
and somehow I hate sports anime
That's why I am a fan of both sports an anime
Can you buy merch of it?
Embarrassment? What's that?
so it's not like my parents don't know
My bunny girl figures are on full display on top of my furniture
that's cause you've never searched for Gardevoire on Danbooru
Fanservice... have enough clothes to not be hentai but don't have enough to be considered PG 13
so I guess just be partially naked?
Also you get more powerful the more naked you are, but being completely naked makes you less powerful... somehow
But humans can also be clothes sometimes
You: IT'S EDUCATIONAL MOM! I LEARNED THAT HUMANS ARE HUMANS AND CLOTHES ARE CLOTHES!!!
Mom: WHAT ARE YOU WATCHING?!?!?!?
there's not much to explain tbh
I just think SBY did what does series did first better
and i'll be the first to admit SBY ripped off Oregairu and Bakemonogatari to make the anime
it did remind me of SBY
but when it's all of them, you can see why that would be a problem
I can like an anime while hating one or 2 main characters
the side characters are plenty of fun tho
none of the 4
I don't like the main characters
and the opposite is also true (as you know already coff coff Oregairu)
I have found plenty of shows that people hate that I love and hold dear to me
While I do think that MAL and those sites do give you a general idea about the quality of the anime you are about to watch
Watching the show
because it basically kickstarted a whole genre
maybe also put SAO on the possibilities
Girl with Neko >>>> Neko girl



Hot take:
Meat mecha
Me when I think mecha:
Other people when they think mecha:
even if it has *THAT* scene
Nisemonogatari I rated a 9/10
It felt a bit boring tbh
i tried ep 1 of Endro
but imo 5 is reserved to mediocre shows that made me bored
You would think giving these shows a 5 would be fair
but Masou Gakuen is...
it's memeable
Symphogear actually has talent and effort
but they're just rip offs of other better girls
i mean they do
meh
does it really?
but does it tho?
IT DESERVES A 1 OR A 2 DON'T GET ME WRONG
Because I have no idea what rate I should give Masou Gakuen HxH
how do you judge an anime that you hated and also kinda loved at the same time?
https://tenor.com/view/baby-shark-shark-dance-shark-week-gif-13619725
ON IT
and how you can power a robot using it
It is about doggy style
that's the word
S H I T
yeah the ending is...
aren't robots in Darling also organic?
at least Ichika makes me laugh sometimes because of how stupid he is
and much worse than Ichika
Houki is absolutely horrible
https://tenor.com/view/houki-shinonono-infinite-stratos-gif-18789548
I do believe there's a character there that's worse
Ichika is my second least favorite character in Infinite Stratos
🇾 🇪 🇸
god i wish
Misfit is amazing tho
I see
i want to see it
is arifureta bad?
yeah
Ararararagi
If i did the stuff he does with other girls and I had a gf I would lose my head
It also has an mc that can get away with pretty much doing anything he wants with other girls even if he has a girlfriend
the culture scene
ah yes
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
If you watch Twintail and feel offended I have bad news for you
twintail is the one show i know that got away pretty much with making fun of its fans
she says her name like twice
not even the mc because everyone just calls her Captain
Tbh i don't remember any of their names
https://tenor.com/view/nope-nope-nope-high-school-fleet-haifuri-run-away-gif-15989507
When you are actually doing what you said you could do:
https://tenor.com/view/high-school-fleet-ship-control-captain-gif-5480814
What you say you are able to do in your resume:
same
<:saaad:591387558617940188>
Haifuri S1 ~~and only~~
that's the best part tho
KC also has the superior OP
Kantai Collection and Azur Lane
true
idk some people are like "crazy concept" 0/10
can you say Girls und Panzer is objectively bad?
https://tenor.com/view/trinity-seven-arata-dragon-gif-15919897
tho my number 1 guilty pleasure of all time is Trinity Seven
which you can't do in youtube
In daily motion you can find all Yuru Yuri op's and ed's
but he indeed had no name
and it was just a joke
i know that's not his real name
nah
at least that's not as bad as his name:
and I am not even kidding
there's at least 2 german football clubs in that name
https://tenor.com/view/anime-minna-strike-witches-cry-sad-gif-17048028
because every german girl in military moe is called Mina
oh the german girl was called Mina
Downright to the boxcutter knife

Which is also the reason why Yumiko straight up looks like a Senjougahara clone
Oh that one makes sense, since the illustrator for Grisaia is the same illustrator for Monogatari
Nah, azur lane

oh wait
Such an original character
https://tenor.com/view/poyo-kirbo-funny-smirk-gif-18914410
also Maria what do you think you're doing?
what? don't you like waiting for half a year to actually watch an anime?
<:HinaHigh:748403493873647678>
except for the fact that strike witches received a S3 10 years later
devil would surprise me



Get the whole family in here!
why stop at Ryuko and Shadow tho?
si usas modismos no puede usar gooogle translate

https://tenor.com/view/seiya-gif-20096620
nice
hey that's my fav Overlord op
i just remmebered Maho also T poses there
also i'm not saying d4dj is bad
hahaha
just look at the thumbnail
actually
1:24
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jESQyxjhzb8&ab_channel=CrunchyrollCollection
haha
it sounds like baccano s2
i was gonna say
yeah
damn that BEM OP is lit
that's absolutely the best part
they fucking assert dominance in the op hahaha
look at 0:48 in the nanatsu op
also
but this season fucking sucks
i mean all the nanatsu openings are quite good tbh
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwNdhISi1W8&ab_channel=RedDay
only because that adaptation can rot in hell for all I care but I will keep the song
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DD3wSwOX7CY&ab_channel=TenshiSubs
I'll say this one:
the fact that i've heard **MUCH** weirder should concern me
<:TsubasaYareYare:407397617451139073>
What is this? Gravity, the anime adaptation?
sure
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRJyYfAq2tk
i'll start
Share awful anime that have great openings
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAOWmgeKvxE&ab_channel=TeamKanBin
but it doesn't fit the show
it's not a bad song
same thing with the op for tonikawa
but it doesn't fit imo
it's not bad
and it's my fav anime of all time
i never have
I don't like kimi no sei
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBsROW-KT5A&ab_channel=Kiranime
i'll make a controversial opinion
yup
tbh
i forgot this one existed
ah
but the op is boring
the show is one of my favorites ever
to me it's the opposite
100% always skipped the op for this one
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByMrJy5p7q8&ab_channel=CrunchyrollCollection
great anime with god awful ops
ok now the opposite
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
but that's the only thing that's better
S2's OP is actually better than the first one imo
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRwcGr8yTws&ab_channel=AniMelody%E2%80%93AnimeMusic
i need to catch up
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFkhNSQXYyE&ab_channel=AnixHQ
people tellme  the same about this series
haven't seen it
i like it more than the first one
IS 2 op is not bad tbh
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DL23LwC0Fs&ab_channel=AlexGonzalez
wait...
it's like if they gave S4 of attack on titan to the animation studio that did teekyuu
that seems like an enourmous leap
how the fuck did that studio went from hensuki to DAL 4?
hensuki
not grisaia
not nanatsu
that's the one you decided to argue?
<:HinaHigh:748403493873647678>
this song is good tbh
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vs4CJ1blJc&ab_channel=Funimation
you mean they want to ride their brother
and by ride
this op is kinda nice
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_DIqplrohhg&list=PLLt2AjHUS_CG0394XXYDqdMnsonSols8O&index=3&ab_channel=LiveLikeanAnimeLife
it's a "see how many references you can spot" kinda anime
it's just references
meh
the anime is quite bad tho
**SONS OF BITCHES**
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yose5jKIIVY&ab_channel=OnamiGames
**NOTHING HAPPENS**
s3 is just...
and s2 is not bad either
it actually was kinda interesting
i liked the first season
in that season the animation and the plot just take a shit
but yeah i agree
or the gup movie
my fav animovie is probably a silent voice
this is one of my fav ed's of all time
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASG8J3b46wQ&ab_channel=NuttiizEi
by girls und panzer
How to be overshadowed hard by your own ed
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ES06Fkkl8ac
i've watched it 3 times
tbh
a silent voice is my fav movie
from all of those
you don't like koe no katachi?
but it's **MUCH MUCH MUCH MUCH MUCH MUCH** worse than the other 3
I don't hate this op
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KS9UfmCFn_Y
the movie is fantascti
isn't that the same band that made BNHA op 2?
actually
i expect that opening from something like BNHA
at all
doesn't fit
just the second  one a little bit more
i like both
i like that one more than the first one
damn
this is that on drugs
remember what i said about an op not fitting the anime?
at all
i don't like chase
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWXZT_x3xi0&ab_channel=Anicrad
but the whole part where this op is trash too so it fits
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17QwzxR81XQ&ab_channel=JabneelSousa
hahaah
death note op 2
fucking
oh
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMccKCGxfe8&ab_channel=jeffreywarf
because crazy noisy bizarre town is just a rip off of uptown funk
well i shouldn't critisize songs based on that logic
but it's too similar to sk8er boi
it's not a bad song
and they sound the same hahaa
yeah
hahahaha
try playing Sk8er boi from avril lavigne over it
the fucking avril lavigne op?
have you forgotten
this is a scene taken out of context of sabagebu

yeah
it is one of the most insane anime i've ever watched

yes

too boring
https://myanimelist.net/anime/20709/Sabage-bu
do you want to watch a show about a girl that joins a club about **GUNS** that has a platypus as a mascot?
ok then
osake wa fuufu is bad
yeah
here you go
https://myanimelist.net/anime/35484/Osake_wa_Fuufu_ni_Natte_kara
man i want to watch a show about a wife that just gets drunk every single day
haev you ever thought to yourself
https://tenor.com/view/araragi-koyomi-koyomi-araragi-bakemonogatari-crawl-wiggle-gif-6935563
and on the next scene:
oh it's a movie
d frag?
the main couple actually had a lot of chemistry
even if everyone was just kissing each other
I really like Yamada-kun
apart from (obvious answer)
regarding romance anime
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9McvtkfCyRM&ab_channel=AnimeFall2016Ver.1
oh and this one
which is easily one of my 5 favorite op's of all time
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-HPhUy5Awk&ab_channel=FavAnimeCom
well except for:
actually there are not many anime in my 10/10 that I like the ops all that much
<:SakutaSmug:655558829852983299>
Persona 5 also has akiba
but it's funnier to think the phantom thieves and love live share a universe
i know that's the reason

I know that entrance

wait a fucking second
this is one of the most overdramatic falls i have ever seen

but that's not as funny
They are called the same too
where the football national team literally has 2 guys with the last name "Corona"
ah yes mexico
Don't do kids, drugs
Indeed

Can’t send gifs
She’s nice
Same
She cute ngl
Almost done with lobu laibu s1
<:TsubasaYareYare:407397617451139073>
That’s not gonna happen
But with no app for my tv
i **WOULD** give funi my money
But they won’t
If they merge their licenses and offer one service, that’d be nice
Because they blame the country all the time
So fuck them
And there’s still no app
Funimation has been available in Mexico for 5 months now
oh that one
i am afraid to ask what the p word is
hide it from twittter
oh no a small girl with big boobs
**BUSHIROAD**
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
But it’s on the lower end of sympho op’s tbh
I mean I like synchrogazer
<:DONE:602895899022065674>
But why synchrogazer tho
I want this inyected
Why am i just learning about this?

wait wtf?
Ok so Honoka is center so she will be the only Gene Simmons

To get this joke
The fact that i’ve watched enough japanese shit

Yugioh became ghost stories
Looks at “Fire however designed that bottle!!”
Because they realized that sells more
And now they dub it little kuribih style
Tomboy idol Yukari is right there!
Now if only we could have pasupare cover GuP
I do
<:HinaWink:748403585557200917>
<:TsuguLove:748445831010713630>
Is that an emote of Tsugumoney?
and Bandori is more about the rivalry and a collection of bands, more than just focusing on one band
more than the girls itself
and how it operates
Idolmaster is more of the idol industry
but I don't regret watching Love Live
sadly I have to say I liked Bandori and Idolmaster (the original) more
Overall...
So they weren’t supposed to have a lot of screen time
I had to understand that it was not the same format
Yeah
But maybe that’s just me being spoiled by Bandori
If I could I guess I would’ve liked to know more abour A-Rise
There’s still a lot of enjoyment
Yeah
**COUGH COUGH** Hanayo and Rin
Less than enough screen time...
Some get...
And you get to love each and every girl
It felt great when they actually ||succeded in their goal of winning love live||
Yeah same
Really?
But S2 is great!
S1 is kinda meh
I gotta say
Except for the movie
I have finished Love Live
so i think it's going to be summer or fall
even mal only says 2021
https://tenor.com/view/akane-shinjo-anime-ssss-gridman-cute-computer-gif-17789536
Dynazenon
it's basically a law at this point
and it wouldn't be a music anime if they didn't reference kiss in some way shape or form
they wanted a change in style
It's S2 ep 6
Lobu Laibu
Maki: You're not the boss of me
if only i was sawa-chan-sensei
true
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>

Tea time members bully each other with cake
<:SerenaDizzy:736605371912945736>
also Azusa was the mature one
K-on did a lot of things backwards...
...
also having Ritsu as president
and also having Mio as Romeo and Ritsu as Juliet
giving lead to yui and azusa rhythm
I forgot k-on did things backwards
https://tenor.com/view/mio-akiyama-mio-akiyama-kon-sad-gif-5889431
rice bowl
ah yes
<:MaiSmug:655558829949583364>
you can always change that
but still
i know tea time's songs aren't that hard
that seriously makes no sense
Why was Azusa rhythm
that one i am sure
also Moca plays lead
in guitar
i am saying Azusa was absolutely better than Yui
i am not saying a lead guitarist can't be a singer
yes you can
How does that make any sense?!?
WHYYYYYY
THE FUCK!?!??!
Yui was the lead guitarist!?
wait Azusa played rhythm?
IN WHAT WORLD WAS AZUSA THE RHYTHM GUITARIST?!?!

yeah Zombieland wins by  a whole planet
if we're going by Producer-san
but it lacked memorable girls
Zombieland was nice
i keep forgetting i watched zombieland
ah yes
but you do get to know all the girls even more
Idolmaster the first season is amazing, the cast is even bigger than love live
There's a main band, but the anime makes sure you get to know the other 5
Kaiba had to use a super advanced computer to build it and they expect us to do it by ourselves?
They finally made an anime about FC Barcelona
Sad soccer you say
<:SaayaThink:748405808718544936>
Tho I tend to judge football anime harshly
Straight to my PTW
Nice
What’s girls playing soccer?
To be honest
But right now tbe MHA manga is actually kinda great
The next season starts slow
for good measure
<:stoopid:626018841276710925>
and slime taoshite
i made a pretty generic list with the most popular stuff haha
glad to know, the community cares more about a loli with boobs than an anime about a literal rapist
for some **FUCKING** reason!
but doens't give a fuck about kaifuku
Because twitter will fucking bash Iruru and Uzaki chan
watching the shitstorm nagatoro will make on twitter
i am going to have fun
i will watch MHA, Demon Lord, Shaman King, Nagatoro, ZLS 2, Megalobox 2, and Slime Toashite


i deserver to watch stupid shit
because after the last 2 weeks
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-VBnmsXiOw&ab_channel=B%C3%BCn
(So no gear)
(It has to be a popular one)
Name a super hyped anime that absolutely deserves the praise it receives
and it's no wonder why people usually start there
it definitely works for a first idol anime a lot
after finishing love live I can say
<:HinaHigh:748403493873647678>
because in ep 120 something things get good
like how poeople tell me to go back to boruto
<:TsubasaDisgust:349013662775902209>
<:HinaHigh:748403493873647678>
the guide is one google search away tho
If you use a guide to skip the filler it is worth the watch
Naruto if you remove the filler is fun to watch
and I absolutely agree
High School DxD is sometimes called the King of ecchi
and Death Note... if we ignore the second part
Angel Beats is super good
yeah S1 was fun
i still need to watch gurren lagan
Is little witch academia that popular tho?
Another good popular anime is FMAB
So you’re saying the joke was a*head* of it’s time


https://rr.noordstar.me/seishunbutayarou-season--announcement-f79a1ac1
but you can just watch this gif and get the same enjoyment
this scene was cool
https://tenor.com/view/boruto-naruto-konohamaru-fight-prank-gif-8198162
other than **ONE** cool scene with Konohamaru
and i can't remember **SHIT** about it
i watched 90 episodes
everyone did
which is hilarious and helps me to make fun of both TPN2 ***AND*** Boruto
the only thing TPN2 can brag about is that it has 0.01 more points than Boruto on MAL
while the drop between TPN and its sequel was 2.83
the drop in points between Naruto Shippuden and Boruto is just a 2.38
for comparison
oh yeah
**ZURA!**
i just never updated it to dropped
then i gave up
i was caught up until ep 4
nah
**JESUS CHRIST**

speaking of ||wanting out||
Boruto feels like Naruto's last couple of arcs before it moved to shippuden
i was not paying much attention and accidentaly got Hanamaru and You confused
this is embarasing
ok
oh shit
Hanamaru is my favorite character in Sunshine
i certainly did not
Basically:
Hanamaru and Yohane S
Riko and Mari A
Ruby, Dia and Chika B
You C
Kanan D
damn this quality image

it goes a bit like this imo
she's mostly the fanservice of the group
and that's about it
is the best friend of Mari
and she...
she... dives...
but at least she had an episode
You is also pretty forgettable
and so far Kanan has had **NOTHING**
I am in Season 2 episode 4 of Sunshine
I just assumed she was just there in the background the entire time
She has moments?

no prob not haha
Kasumi you blood thirsty vampire
Kasumi is Millaarc?!
<@!199928870810419200>
wait a fucking minute
Me:
1 minute into Gurren Lagan


i meant the spin off shows
not the special episodes
ah no
perfect!
ah yes, don't forget the side stories
if you don't play fifa a lot yeah, pretty much all fifas are the same with kit and squad updates
yup, sounds about right
you can get through all the 9 seasons in like 4 hours haha
perfect!
since I didn't buy fifa 21
was haha
also yes, i am a fifa semi pro player
indeed
Welcome to the club haha

And yet here it is

I did not expect to get another Rem fig today
Welp
...that won't be me tho
somebody would have to count them
but the video goes faster
But dess has more chapters

Kirika’s **DESS**
What happens more?
<@!199928870810419200> <@!207452640886521859>


Or a Saori nendo
But I want it as much as the other 2
The Mako is much more expensive tho

And I am between a Kongou, a Mako and a Yukina figure
What the fuck should I get as an auto present moment
I am currently in a
Nico Nico Fire
Who could forget her catchphrase?
I don’t think you see the issue
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>

Yeah

I'm loving Nijigasaki already

Did 300 year slime just made a “omae wa mo shindeiru” joke?
The mannerisms, the voice and grace of a woman
She is the idol equivalent of that kid that lost in video games and was like “K BYE!!! I’M TAKING MY XBOX WITH ME”
How do people like her?! She is literally the worst!
This is the second fucking time Mio leaves NGS
Episode 20 of CG
Did she also build a robo waifu?
This 30 second parody is better than anything kanokari ever did
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28vZZFaFIzk&ab_channel=Sakurano-Chan
There's good **thing** in it
...
the OP
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRwcGr8yTws&ab_channel=AniMelody%E2%80%93AnimeMusic
there's good things in it
I think people are being too hard on Promised neverland 2
<:HinaHigh:748403493873647678>
This doesn’t feel like Love Live at all ngl
And gets adopted by Love Live for some reason
Nijigasaki is what happens when Idolmaster and Symphogear have a kid
<:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
And i don’t mean that as an insult
This show is **GGGAAAAYYY**
Currently on ep 11 of Nijigasaki
And in the exact next scene
The dude is sometimes the coolest
Somebody wanted to make an anime which consisted of 100% shitpost
I am convinced
This is actually the worst thing ever
WHAT THE FUCK?!
Not in a good way
No
It’s horrible
The romcom where the childhood friend won’t lose
Also “Osamake”
Why is his plan of “revenge” still in play?
The dude pretty much already won
What the fuck is happening...?
I can already tell this will end poorly
Specially it it gets worse
I don’t know if I can take it
God so far it’s worse than rent a girlfriend
I’m about to drop it on ep 2
Yup
<:KirikaSparkle:698939825876631714> <:KirikaSparkle:698939825876631714> <:KirikaSparkle:698939825876631714>
Twinrabe
Twin Shirabes
What the fuck is Shirabe doing there?!

Also...
Don’t you hate it when your 40 year old high school classmates want to kick your ass?
This one should be 1/6
Probably for a 1/4 scale of very high quality
It’s roughly 80 dollars
<:HinaHigh:748403493873647678>
Pesos
I neeeeeeeeed it

But then they do it anyway
And then they don’t do it
Oh they’re going to do this old cliche
Ane you’re like
It does a scene
It’s like
It’s the entirety of Australia last year
It’s not a dumpster fire
Or do I hate it so much I absolutely hate it
I don’t even know if I hate it so much i kinda like it
This is like combining Masamune’s revenge, Rent a Girlfriend, Saekano and Oregairu
With... results
Into one
It’s like a computer took every harem and tried to combine it
Yeah exactly
It’s not even consistently bad
And immediately being almost as bad as rent a girlfriend
It fluctuates too much between most being as good as bunny girl
His personality does a 180 every other scene
He’s worse than Kazuya

you know i was actually wondering, where is the little sister character?
stranger danger
REEEEED FLAG
RED FLAG

https://tenor.com/view/lewd-trinity-seven-anime-sign-gif-7407062
<:KaoruHakanai:748459600428400684>
indeed
i have a trinity seven i have to read
now if you'll excuse me
You people and your degenerate shows
it'll make me respect your work a little bit
might as well burn the entire forest while you're at it
if you wanna do a dumpster fire
give us the harem ending
please
in fact
you know at this point I am expecting the harem ending
https://tenor.com/view/jontron-jon-jaffari-jontron2-gif-7573585
Ayumu is not great tbh
the only weak part about niji is their Honoclone
https://tenor.com/view/sifas-karin-asaka-love-live-gif-20304557
Karin is also fantastic
indeed
https://tenor.com/view/perfect-dream-project-setsuna-yuki-love-live-nijigasaki-anime-gif-16338106
Niji S2 makes me happy because I get to see more of best girl
or a Sunshine girl
and depending on my mood my best girl in the whole LL franchise is a Niji girl
it's still good tho
it feels way more like an Idolmaster with a school setting
it does feel **VERY** different from the other love lives
so there's a lot of stuff i don't know
(i'm still new to love live)
oh i see
it feels weird that they haven't finished niji and they are already starting a new love live tho
NICE
and the new love live is set for 2021?
NICE!
really?
maybe Shirabe
idk exactly who would sing it
or does this song absolutely has a symphogear feel to it?
is it just me
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40E9Lhx7DfE&ab_channel=AwAdUwU
Ranko you beautiful, wonderful being of darkness


it looks way better than I thought it would ngl
but not actually show lesbians
japanese just like to tease lesbians
probably not
that's the fucking FIFA anthem
my priorities be like:
that actually makes more sense
and in a harem that's kind of a problem
but my fav character is definitely Arata
she's my fav of that harem
i mean I like Liesse
i will read it
he overshadows every trinity seven
funny enough i think arata's weak point is that he's too good for his harem
i need to read the manga
<:MaiOfCulture:655558829668433930>
he's my favorite pervert
he's fucking amazing haha
i ended up making the top 10 best guys too

those are great
i remember now
yeah
the dude who
oh
tbh
idk who those are
1. Koro-Sensei
2. Keima Katsuragi
3. Joseph Joestar
only the top 3 remain the same everytime
the top 10 husbandos changes a lot depending on my mood
but i haven't updated that one
i also have a top 10 husbandos if you will
https://tenor.com/view/anime-bakemonogatari-monogatari-hachikuji-mayoi-gif-18737627
although from monogatari, my fav has to be Hachikuji
we both have a gear, nisekoi, himeko from kokoro connect and dxd
but shows
not particularly girls
we do sheare a lof of shows in common
<:MaiOfCulture:655558829668433930>
i also see Himeko Inaba
but good choice nevertheless
i am more of a Reina man myself
Nice choice
Kumiko Oumae?
<:HinaHigh:748403493873647678>
i put Amane not for the grisaia anime that's for sure
i mean
no other girl even comes close to Mai for me
that one is absolutely no trouble for me haha
got bored, decided to update this
i have to read the manga
either way
thanks
that won't fit with the nanomedicine i am studying rn
i'm good
<:NanamiUwU:756325401533612132>
i see...
and mahou?
but magic king is maou?
isn't magic "mahou"?
maou and mahou
and they were right
afaik yes

Kongou of the sea tell us your wisdom
They already reached Pecora?
(i didn't say it the other way around because this is a symphogear server)
idk, the face, the smirk, looks a lot like fine to me
what kind of fine is this
i do wonder

it's so racist, I love it
WHAT THE FUCK?!??!?! HAHAHAHAHAH THAT'S AMAZING
i will watch it as soon as i'm done with this week
Damn
even more than the last episodes?

<:NanamiDerp:814622021752979456>
<:MaiSmug:655558829949583364>
i can think of a few reasons
what one event does to you
damn
i expected either kaosato or arisumi
really?
the most popular ship in the whole franchise is kaosato
i can bet my ass
as someone who is part of the community
<:HinaPiola:843669687091200009>
one of those is illegal
but i bet 80% of them involve kaoru in some way
haha nah
<:MocaBread:839731023653896214>
i read the manga
worse
<:TsuguLove:748445831010713630>
did i meantion she's my best girl? hahaha

i do call her Shadow the hedgehog instead of HH-chan

Sonic the hedgehog*
Arguably bang dream’s biggest meme

Today was a good day

Oh I thought it was the other way around
Or niji 2?
The new Love live
What’s coming first?
Wait <@!199928870810419200>

Niji has the best girl ever tho
Indeed
I hadn’t noticed
Oh damn you’re right
But at least she’s funny
Emilia is just a tsundere

Yeah
Chiho is very sweet
Speaking of second girlfriends being cute af
Trashier than Domestic Girlfriend
Top tier trash
It’s amazing
And with s2 coming why not
It seems like a great time tbh
Yeh
I fucking lost count
Mcdonalds ripoff number

BURNING LOOOOOOOOOOVE
She’s… she’s…
I was wondering why I liked Chiho’s voice so much
Oh my god
…feelings for Maou, which makes her even cuter
She also has some massive
I like her
Yeah she’s very sweet

Almost done with the anime

They don’t like the anime
People like the game
The only reason senku has to rebuild civilization is because of the petrification
BUT IT’S A HUGE ONE!
It is imjust one point
5000 years
Petrification
Again
The petrification really is scifi
Buuuut
It is
Symphogear also doesn’t really make that much of an attempt to explain shit
^ that
So it’s not scifi
Quirks in my hero academia are just magic goes brrrrrr
Magic but the show tries to explain how it works using science
I see scifi as
The girls in madoka ||turning into witches are them riding their mecha||
Passable doesn’t equal enjoyable
And that’s: Trash
Infinite stratos is only one genre
Not mecha
Battle suit
<:KanonCry:750283030983213148>
But I know nothing of mecha
We apparently switched to mecha now
Yes
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Attack on titan is bio mecha
Change my mind
Battlesuit is not mecha
Since psychology is a science
<:MaiOfCulture:655558829668433930>
Seishun buta yarou is a scifi
Is one of sith vs jedi
But the story being told
Of course
There are characters that are not from either
Yes really
Jedi and sith represent at least 95% of the movies
You do realize
And the androids
I guess the artificial limbs count
But they sure don’t mention it in the movies
I am sure the extended universe explains how they work
Brrrrrr
It’s literally just stone, handle
Have you seen how the light sabers are created?
Than in the whole 9 movies of star wars
I’ve seen more science in a weak episode of game theory
Is there even science in star wars?
A lot actually
Steins gate has scifi
Mahou shoujo is girls who transform to fight evil
Do they pay you?
<:HinaWink:748403585557200917>
You get angry if you want
Because i won’t change my statement
Then do!
And why do you care?
<:HinaHigh:748403493873647678>
Why do people get angry of what others think?
Ok first of all
<:HinaHigh:748403493873647678>
They have all the elements of one
Yes
They are very clearly mahou shoujo
<:HinaHigh:748403493873647678>
They are mahou shoujos tho
And consoles have metal
But they are consoles
Nepu is mahou shoujo
Not mecha
Battle suit
Azur lane and kancolle are mecha?!
Wait a fuck
Psychological anime
<:MaiOfCulture:655558829668433930>
Because Persona is also Scifi
Have a Setsuna Joker

Here
Let’s all calm down
The other 3 are the same in their normal form and hdd form
It’s just the planeptune goddesses
(Except for her and iris heart)
Since the other goddesses make it clear than changing personalities is not really a think
I am pretty sure nepu is just acting tbh
Just like sailor moon was irl named whatever the fucked (i never watched the show)
They are girls that can transform into stronger forms to fight
Simply
What they are or transform into is irrelevant in this case
So…?
<:HinaHigh:748403493873647678>
To fight evil
Transforms
Do they
Are they girls who transform to fight evil?
<:HinaHigh:748403493873647678>
Sounds a lot like a mahoushoujo to me
Transformation, fight evil, get weapon, can use superpowerful attacks, have finishers
Neptunia follows a lot of them tho
They can’t all do the same
Of course different shows will do different things to stand out
I mean that’s just going into technical stuff
<:HinaHigh:748403493873647678>
Wat how?!
So strike witches is mahou shoujo
It’s in the name
Magical girls are shows about girls using magic? Would you agree?
Nepu vs Deathpool death battle when?
<:okitacry:755166016006389891>
But I wanna argue
But that doesn’t mean there aren’t
So i can’t think of examples rn
It’s 5 in the morning and you know i am not the biggest fan of mahoushoujos
But not always
That’s just one of the things mahoushoujos usually have
Only because they don’t “learn how to use their powers” doesn’t mean it’s not part of the genre
The cpu’s already can
The sisters have to learn how to transform
<:HinaHigh:748403493873647678>
And i’m sure nepu is the same
But she’s still a mahoushoujo
Momo already controls her powers 100%
If you look at machikado
I mean
We certainly live in a society
But redo of healer gets a S2
So this gets cancelled
Christ
<:rage:651253812329316382>

And Rui Yashio from Bang Dream is supposed to be 15
Nico is 17
but then i remember that
normally when i see a meme of anime logic regarding age is two or one girl that looks a different age because of some supernatural thing going on
And I love it for it
Kanojo mo kanojo is fucking awful

I should also finish megalobox 2

I am watching kanojo mo kanojo
In terms of not idol or cute girls stuff
They finally got Honoka right
Ngl you can start nijigasaki whenever
I had forgotten how Yugi beat Pegasus

Yeah she’s the “Oh no she’s brain damaged” of Niji

There won’t be a new episode this week right?
That would be fun
That would be a great inspiration
Oh I get it like Asuna Yuki from SAO
Maybe one inspired by the name of the protagonist of an isekai
Yeah
I wished she was also a school idol
Nana second best girl
Setsuna best girl
Everyone uses funny words at first, you understand nothing it’s not fun and you will never use it to communicate with your family
Idol hell is like learning a new language <:MaiOfCulture:655558829668433930>

We are too underdeveloped as a species

Nana probably wants the club dead

But it doesn’t go as well with the theme of the show

I just said Ayumu is checking out Yuu’s charm point in the OP
It was AKeupho
I didn’t promise the gay
<a:SetsunaShake:631576958915837953>
<:setsunapout:859914383656353792>
<:setsunahappy:859914436273635368>
Since Yu ||is cannonicaly us||
I approve of this decision
She is absolutely checking her out
Ha you wish
Same
You have 3 weeks

<:KirikaCry:674720015047720961>
(With other characters of course)
Dw i do the same joke all the time
I know nothing about gundam
I had no idea
Oh I see
Kinda looks like dess
I don’t like gundam hahaha i don’t get it sorry
**YES**

It’s awful when that happens
We get you dw
What the fuck even is a shrew
The concept didn’t really spoke to me
I’ll probably never see it
The last i heard of it was around episode 7
I was gonna say
I heard people were really liking it
What happened?
I thought people were over exaggerating
This is some next level fanservice
**JESUS CHRIST**
Started HOTD
I’d say depending on the scene symphogear goes from yuribait to actual yuri in some scenes
At the very least that part is very explicit
In bang dream specially, you can make an argument that Rimi and Himari are very much in love with Kaoru
Would you consider love live and bang dream yuri?
We do get ||a kiss between girls|| after all
Everyone on girlfriend girlfriend already has massive mental damage
~~they are but that’s besides the point~~
Lesbians
*watches episode 2* “there it is! That’s what was missing”
Me: *watches non non biyori episode 1* “it’s a nice show, very chill very cute, but I think it’s missing something to truly be a cute girls doing cute things anime”
Ah yes… Chika Takami… the most sexualized character of all time



Me: of course! Look how cute she is
Her: Really?!
Me: I love you!
And Ryouko

Is this seiyuu obligated by contract to always play the aggressive tomboy?
https://tenor.com/view/inaba-himeko-himeko-inaba-inaba-himeko-kokoro-connect-gif-18429892
I recognize that delinquent attitude and smug, violent, tomboy voice anywhere
Wait a second

<@!199928870810419200>

Wait it’s all lolis?
I thought she was yeeted of the manga

When Setsuna Yuki already exists to show us **PEEK** cooking skills
To think there could be a show about cooking
Started watching Shokugeki no souma for the lolz
I can confirm
Kirika, Toshinou Kyouko, Kotori Minami and Ranko Kanzaki right there
I found where all the budget went
**JESUS CHRIST**

But then I took a look at the seiyuus
It looked like the budget is close to 0
I started watching an insane anime which reminded me a lot of Teekyuu called Ai-Mai-Mi
As “I can’t believe it’s not Tsubasa”
<:MaiOfCulture:655558829668433930>
Which is always a plus
Also music girls has mai sakurajima

Specially this scene, it made me laugh
But it is fun at times
Music girls.. it’s way more generic
Wake up girls made me feel uncomfortable
Somewhere
There has to be a hidden gem here
I am looking into crunchy
I have not
And episode 2 is the most uncomfortable thing i’ve ever watched
And the last 2 minutes a shady producer was already looking for a way to make a quick buck sexualizing them
And it was panty shot after panty shot
Then 2 minutes where it suddenly became strike witches
It began with 20 minutes of boredom
I also watched one called wake up girls
They all suck
I’m just looking at some idol anime on crunchy
Music girls


Tsubasa School Idol
Tsubasa professional idol 2
<:HinaPiola:843669687091200009>
Did she just call her own sister “lovable pet like girl”?
Just give us one streamin platform with both libraries
They’ve been fusing for 1 year now!
Is she playing a genki mc?
He wants to be the next yugioh protagonsit
Non non biyori?
Oh no… not amogus
This shit it too funny hahahahha
https://tenor.com/view/dance-seaweed-method-acting-the-disastrous-life-of-saiki-k-saiki-gif-16823924
On today’s episode of: “I’m obsessed with this anime”
i want to see chika and bandori duking it out

another completely different is adding straight up hagumi
one thing is looking samy
it's just laziness
so if it's craft egg then it's not plagiarism
for good measure
and add some idolmaster on the left
as you would
then bandori chika as center
and less saturated Hagumi
little Rinko
Yohako
does that mean they had to put hagumi, rinko and ako?
<:AyaJii:585567196344877087>
sue yourself
they are straight up recolors of other shows characters
look at the characters
<:TaeBlank:748439496013643817>
can love live, idolmaster and bandori sue?
this is straight up plagiarism
this is plagiarism

ummm...
||and who are also one girl but two||
He cares for his parents more than anything
But he’s still a family man
And it absolutely takes him zero effort
He changes everyone’s perseption and cognition on life itself
Or like Saiki K where he just wants to live a happy life but on the side he also changes the world itself to fit him
That one might’ve actually hurt him a little
The most damage anos received throughout the series was the massive disappointment of seeing how far has his race had fallen
He was more like: “oh please come and kill me go right ahead i’ll just stay here and take it, give it your best shot”
Anos didn’t seemed annoyed at all
Not even annoyance
Collateral damage…
He was more of…
Enemy implies there was a threat to Anos
They acknowledge how unfair all his powers are
And they play it as a comedy
I mean it is a comedy
Actually yes tbh
The dude is the anime equivalent of you on elementary school being like “my finger can destroy the world, I am indestructible, nothing can touch me and trap cards don’t work on me”
The dude can’t die even when he’s killed
Also one of the most broken characters in anime history
The protagonist of “The misfit of demon kind academy”
Same
While Saiki and Anos just give reality the middle finger on a daily basis
The debates going on between goku and superman on who’s stronger
Anos: did you really think being impossible would make it not possible?
Logic: anos you can’t do that, that’s impossible
Just si i can pay extra for vrv
Also i’d have to pay extra for a vpn
And people have pointed out that crunchy is quick to ban vpn users
vrv isn’t available here
As long as I get both catalogues i’m happy
I don’t care if the price is a bit more of what I pay rn
Anyway i’m done giving them money until they merge
When they are owned by the same company now
There’s no point in having two different services with two different catalogues
But forget about the dub
The dub of sunshine is actually funny
There’s absolutely no point in having two separate services
The merge needs to happen…
It’s not like they have no dubs for other shows
But you couldn’t license the english dub?
I know how licenses work
No
<:CarolWhat:688191203040034831>
Then why is sunshine still on the platform?!
Or the english dub?
And why not sunshine the movie?
Why do you have Sunshine but not any other love live?
Why would I ever want to start watching Index and Railgun from season 3?
Of having only certain seasons of anime
Also i’m tired of CR’s bullshit
<:ChrisOi:586551700987576330>
I think i’ve supported the industry enough for now
I’ve had premium for over a year now
Indeed
The movie isn’t on CR
So it shouldn’t take long
Both have 3 seasons of 12
The only two long shows I want to finish from crunchyroll are bungo stray dogs and non non biyori
Rn the two anime i am watching are on netflix anyway
And then drop the premium
I might do a marathon and finish all the anime on crunchy i want to finish
No that show about aqours x bandori on ice
No that show about the girl that sees undead
No komi san
<:ChrisBored:672575526346424351>
But this time there’s also no quantity
There’s no quality as always
But this season it has like 4 new shows
So it licenses a bunch of shows nobody wants to watch each season
But crunchyroll at least tends to favor quantity over quality
It does
I think i’ll drop my premium for a few months until they merge with funimatuon
There’s nothing on simulcast!
Mostly because goooooodait crunchyroll is a desert rn
I might start watching it
Girls who draw power from music to fight grotesque alien like creatures?

I didn’t even know those had an anime
Or at least commision a studio to make a zelda anime
Nintendo is the one that need it’s own studio
How is that the same character??
But season 1 Yoppi looks like this:
I get that season 2 wanted to tweek the designs to give the girls more individually because quite frankly they were kinda hard to tell apart in season 1
<:ChrisShock:620077681484103680> <:ChrisShock:620077681484103680> <:ChrisShock:620077681484103680>
And I’m like “THAT’S YOPPI?!?!?!”
Then they say “Yoppi hi!”
And I’m like “oh nice a new girl”
Starting wake up girls S2 and I see this girl:

Bandori fans: nah, not really
Regocnize me now?

And yes, i know it sounds painful
So bang ice
It is made by craft egg
But the second half got boring outside of Sumire’s ep
It had the potential to be the best
But superstar is not the best love live
Unpopular opinion maybe
Oh gee I wonder ||if this school is in danger of closing down||
<:HinaHigh:748403493873647678>
But it did try to be LL
Sunshine is by far my fav love live haha
Can anyone name a girl from arise outside of tsubasa?
Without looking it up
Even if they’re friends
In saint snow there was rivalry
Nah
They’re more like… side groups
Sunnypa and Arise aren’t rivals tbh
1 Make idol group
2 School is closing
3 Lose to SS
4 Come back
5 Win love live
6 Save school 
7||…save school?||
8||SAVE SCHOOL!!!||
9||FFS!!||
<:HinaHigh:748403493873647678>
Because the precure designer was busy
Liella ||can’t beat sunnypa cause there needs to be a S2||
||not even in the end||
The problem never really goes away
That’s what I like about sunshine
||died but not really don’t worry||
Because honoka ||died||
(Pulled out)
Where muse lost
But muse also introduced it and got rid of it at the end of s1
https://tenor.com/view/the-idolmaster-cinderella-girls-idolmaster-cinderella-girls-cinderella-girls-gif-5213505
Because Ranko is in it
Not entirely
But the original im@s is amazing
Im@s CG was kinda boring
(Idc if they’re called R3birth, i’m not calling them that)
S2 presenting Monster Girls
Hell i’m half expecting ||niji s2 to be like “hey girls, guess what’s closing down!”||
<:hayasaka:770511026298028072>
NOW
Get rid of her
Kotori still doesn’t exist
Touche
Nozomi in the manga has no peesonality
For Umi reasons
https://tenor.com/view/nico-yazawa-love-live-anime-pout-sulky-gif-9115185
In the anime she’s a gremlin
And mature
Nico in the manga is much more calm and collected
And I don’t care for either
~~She’s rin but better~~
<:LuluSmile:762816861653696513>
I like trash girls sometimes
Mikan
When i first watched LL
I did not expect her to be that way
And i love her for that
Full of herself
Annoying
Nico is…
<:RinaSus:835187356642181150>
I got bad news for you
Can you guess my fav muse girl? Hahahah
Hanayo imo is the most boring LL girl
And didn’t care for the first years
I loved the third years
Which was the opposite for me in Muse
The third years are the weak part imo
But good comic relief
They’re comic relief
https://tenor.com/view/love-live-angry-smile-tantrum-cute-gif-16362322
Specially Yoshiko and Maru
The first years are my fav part abour Sunshine
You even forgot she existed didn’t you???
<:HinaHigh:748403493873647678>
You’s cousin?
What you didn’t like…
||Ruby betrayed aqours and created Saint Aqours Snow||
S1 ep 1 is probably my fav love live episode
<:ElsaWhat:689195325621141505>
Also let’s never speak of the first 2 episodes of the anime
WUG Zoo explains it better
<:AdamScream:688241618356404224>
Why does Yoshino look like that?!
What the sh$t is that?!
Ow come on don’t exagerr-ooooowwww
No no
Actually let’s not
<:chisatolol:774138056168308776>
Let’s talk wake up girls
Indeed
That’s talent
Without fully closing her mouth
She also said “zura”
Hahahaha

<:LuluSmile:762816861653696513>
Just buy 2
<:CarolSmug:617040484111745027>
Maru and Yoshiko exist tho
But no one is great
…
They’re all good
That’s the thing
Kanon is also good
And that’s all I can say about it
Sumire and Keke are good…
The thing that brings down superstar for me is the fact that when I think about it. There wasn’t a girl that I lked as much as Yoshiko, Nico, Maru and Setsu in Superstar
Kasumi in the game is great
Kasumi in the anime is kinda boring
True
Or maybe muse over superstar
Sunshine and Superstar
I have it rhe other way around haha
But Setsu saves it
I do agree
<:NanamiDerp:814622021752979456>
Are you implying something?
I will flood this channel with setsu
If it switxhes to niji
Yanderepyon^
<a:ayumutposeshake:690574212863098931>
Unless it’s Yuu
I don’t think they’ve ever showed it
Who makes the costumes in niji?
I still need to finish zombieland
Wug, music girls
I’ve tried other idol shows after watching the main 3
<:setsunapout:859914383656353792>
I know it did
Just remembering it
I feel dirty
<:whatpeko:762491622331514968>
Never
Ye
<:ChrisOi:586551700987576330>
The seasonals:
Crunchyroll: Don't cancel your subscription! You're gonna miss the seasonals!
checks out
Lemme check with the legal system real quick...

also this is peak manga dialogue:
also how dare you show me bunny girl and not invite me?
most of them*
but it's worth it
you'll lose a few braincells
<:hayasaka:770511026298028072>
*very adviced
it's the only show that let's you watch 9 seasons in an afternoon
https://tenor.com/view/teekyuu-kemono-friends-oshawott-tsukasa-hiiragi-wolfyuchu-gif-22095185
i love my teekyuu
https://tenor.com/view/ai-mai-mi-japanese-japanese-anime-anime-manga-gif-5685521
ai mai mi is very similar to teekyu
this is insanity


i have 2 shows for you
you want the essence of insanity?
https://tenor.com/view/saiki-saiki-k-saiki-kusuo-gif-22970488
so...
but i've watched it this year
it's not from this year
anime of the year was Saiki K
maybe i just really like the soundtrack
but it wasn't stuff from this year
i've watched a lot of good shit this year
and it just fucking began
probably the best one i've watched all year is Takt Op
...i don't even think it is a romance
best romance
at least
i have
"**FUCK NO!!**"
and i'm like...
where everyone is like "anime of the year contender"
Higehiro is the one tho
but nothing memorable for me
there was some amazing anime
but nothing i saw this year is going to stick with me as one of the best i've watched
i felt that it was a year with pretty well done anime
maybe i didn't feel it
<:ElsaWhat:689195325621141505>
it is an opinion
it is not
but there was nothing amazing in 2021
i watched other shows
i only cared for dr stone 2
people are just pretending it's amazing because it's a liiiiiittle better than the rest of the year
this season is not even that good
i am not paying 5 dollars a month to watch aquatope
Some other show
But maybe one day
Oh not eromanga sensei
Tbh, you can sometimes find a gem in anime that people consider “bad”
Mercylessly
It’s good if only to watch a mahou shoujo fucking torturing her companion pet
And that’s the plot of the show
There’s another show that’s only 4 minutes an episode that’s called something like “I am a magical girl but when I transform i’m in a swimsuit”
I did not expect an angry af third year with an inferiority complex
I was ready for that when she finally appeared in the show
So I thought she was going to be very cutesy and super optimistic
I only knew her from the random gifs and such
Tbh Nico genuinely surprised me
You can tell because she says so herself
She’s the greatest idol in the world of course
But you get the idea
It differs a bit
Actually no
The actual op in this song is from 1:00 to 1:30
Which makes each episode 2:30 minutes long
Oh and season 9 also has an ending
Then 1:30 minutes of show
It’s 30 seconds of the opening
The opening is 1/4 of the content
There’s at least 50 jokes per episode
(Minus a 30 second opening mind you)
In those 2 minutes
Lots of them
Basically 1 season is the equivalent of 1 episode of a regular anime
12 episodes per season
2 minutes per episode
Mirika in the manga goes between being extremely annoying to kinda cute depending on the arc
Ah now that isna problem
New characters just kept popping off out of nowhere
And it didn’t grab me
I watched 6 episods
Then there’s the problem
Ah
72 episodes for 22 volumes can be done
That’s not super rushed tbh…
What do you mean?
Because of my taste in anime
A lot of people tell me to watch Railgun first
Specially toaru
Or at least give them another chance
I should finish some shows i have on “dropped”
I couldn’t get passed ep 2 of Kanojo Okarishimasu
At least you completed them
<:EricaSmug:804831657433104384>
Imagine watching trashy shows that rely only on fanservice
<:ShirabeWink:781967160166580235>
<:ElfneinSmug:688236836891656246>
I only watch shows after haruhi
<:KanonSmug:748400274594332724>
Late  90’s
Ew
<:hayasaka:770511026298028072>
And oregairu…
Some other day i’ll go back to toaru
Anyway i’ll go to sleep
<:KanadeBleh:672455306059579392>
It’s not that good
…
Welp
I genuinely didn’t know that!
||this a sequel to your name?!||
WAIT
<:chisatolol:774138056168308776>
And i’m not even talking about the Aqua in the background
This reference is so obvious that even I got it

And it will in **NO WAY** make me cry
I’m sure it will be very happy
Time to watch “weathering with you”
<:CarolPout:617039564313198602>
The police chasing Hodaka for half a movie
What did the movie decide to focus on?
All of that is amazing
The heaven is very interesting
Hina’s power is very interesting
…not as much
…the story telling?
All of those are amazing
The audio mixing
The visuals
The soundtrack
That’s at least 60% of C.C. character
How dare they?
Me: “OOOOOOOOOOHHHHH!”
*season 2. Starts*
Me: “oh come on you’re exaggerating. Yes there’s a lot of pizza but it never says it’s pizza hut”
Old time CG fans: “oh haha funny code geass is a pizza hut ad”
at least Ikki vs Victor
damn now i want to see medabots again

yugioh wouldn't be the same without you
thank you 4kids
damn 4kids really giving us hours and hours of family friendly entertainment
<:ChrisPray:672578403156885504>
0/10
that's not the one piece rap
What madness is this?
A harem anime where both main girls have the same hair color?
That’s just straight up a redead from ocarina of time

The anime actually toned it down
<:chisatolol:774138056168308776>
There’s even more ecchi in the manga wtf
This’ll be fuuun
Oh nice the unnecessary ecchi is in the manga too
I’ll add it to my library
But i can’t stop watching
It should suck hard
Mieruko is unironically good and i don’t know why
The show about the girl seeing ghosts with unnecessary ecchi is better and i’m not even joking
It didn’t really hook me
I’ve only watched ep 1-2
I have no clue
And that’s where the comparison ends really
I mean they both use music to fight
Nah
Everyone knows it’s red or golden hair tsundere and blue or white girl kuudere, or a black or purple haired senpai
It is still good… but i’d rather the story ended with the anime
The movie is kinda unnecessary
…EXCEPT!
I will say it is absolutely amazing and very worthy of being held in the highest of regards
I finished Code Geass
Ah also
Before moving into ultimate
I’ll finish the original first
This first episode was an absolute masterpiece
I don’t really care much for spoilers
BUT
I already watched the abridged
||oh crap…||
The face Anderson made when he told Integra ||he cut off alucard’s head, and then she asked was like “pfff is that all?”||
The original
Yup
The first episode is fire
DAAAAAMN
https://tenor.com/view/alucard-approves-gif-5420176
Time to watch some mofocking vaaaampiiiires
Symphogear invented lesbians
||bitches|| love cannons
Every character when they’re on screen vs when Seras is on screen
https://tenor.com/view/kaos-comic-girls-anime-kawaii-shiver-gif-11828258
Most protect
Kaosu is baby
I already watched it
Jokes on you
<:AyaJii:585567196344877087>
This time around i want to watch everything that’s regarded as “best of all time” anime
The first half of the year i craved idol anime
Yeah but i’m talking about the order i watched them
Those are the only vampire anime i’ve watched hahahaha
Keep in mind
Now hellsing
Then owar no seraph
First jojo
<:AyaJii:585567196344877087>
HOW MANY VAMPIRES DOES DIO’S SEIYUU VOICES?!
ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME??
Almost forgot about Villeta
I like
If the girl in the military moe speaks english
I am a simple man
Best girl
<:Shirley:804831513891831829>
Even Shirley who could just be a love interest and nothing more has a lot of development
It just speaks greatly of the other girls
But even “the weakest” is quite interesting in some ways
Nunally is definitely the weakest in terms of character
Kallen, CC, Cornelia, even Euphemia and Nunally are all very interesting
Both in character development and in actual force
An anime with a lot of action with MANY (not just one) very strong females
Nice job code geass
Also
I realized there was stuff changed
Yeah since i saw that ||shirley was still alive||
I know
The urge they have to kill the other, it’s not even about “i have to kill him” it’s more like “oh god i want to stab him so bad”
Everytime they are on screen you can feel the respect, the hate but most of all
Jesus they have so much chemistry
People when discussing anime rivalries don’t talk enough about Alucard vs Alexander Arnold
Every other yuri anime is inspired by gear
And then making abridged Kaiba look sane by comparison
DSOD is basically abridged Kaiba becoming canon
but damn netflix has no quantity
normally quality over quantity is obviously good
but aside from those it doesn't have a lot of volume
it has a lot of long shows that could be regarded as genre defining
and at the same time very few
netflix has a lot of anime to offer
but no
i thought maaaaaaaybe i just thought that
"this looks just like the abridged"
when i was watching i thought
very easy 10/10
i watched ultimate
anyway
it was just when I saw *10 episodes* for Ultimate and 13 episodes for the original that I realized
everywhere in netflix it says "Hellsing"
and i've never until just now checked the differences between both versions
never says "Ultimate"
I watched it on netflix, where it just says hellsing, the damn show also says Hellsing
(Before you say anything let me explain)
i watched hellsing ultimate
it appears i didn't watch hellsing
ok so
I need to first find where to watch
Ultimate might just straight up kill me
The 2006 is already a goddamn masterpiece
I mean
You said this was the **bad** version?
😳
I have finished hellsing
just how strong was him in his prime?
the dude is a beast in his almost 70's
another thing from hellsing i never see in top 10's is when they talk about top 10 most powerful humans they never mention Walter
How is the abridged version of the major less over the top than the real deal?
I only know Polpo and Itachi

Random idea for a comedy anime:
Yup
is mieruko chan
awwwww shit

<:hayasaka:770511026298028072> <:hayasaka:770511026298028072> <:hayasaka:770511026298028072>
Is that the anime about your mom?
Heavy object?
She’s all like “oh! What’s this elevator?? Huh? A giraffe? Ok. Hey why is Hikari fighting? Why is Junna fighting? Why am I fighting? Oh I won… I guess!
Karen is just rolling with it
It has basically explained NOTHING yet
I have only watched the first 3 episodes
(Revue Starlight)
This show is surprisingly fun

Red flags: The character
She has more outfits than Barbie
Rem is almost on Miku’s level at this point
Or maybe it’s the fact that in figures Rem wears anything BUT a maid uniform nowadays
Which is the weeb equivalent of making a FIFA game and calling it “Football Edition”
And they called it “Maid version”
They announced a Rem figure…

Throwback to when crunchyroll said:
When your friend finally agrees to give Kancolle/Azur Lane a try:
Then why do we call manga from korea “manwha”?
We can only make comics
<:HibikiEager:407398049531559937>
We’re not japanese
We can’t
I just wish it was a manga
That plot has potential
Ngl
Rival:
MC: I won’t lose either!
Rival: I won’t lose!
Just to be safe
Sure but in <#336297808221044736>
They’re bigger than her head
Damn!!!
I don’t know that one actualky
At least one of them had to be flat
…oh well

Tomo-
Maria, Rias, Mio, Tio
Just the way it HAD to be
Voiced by Maria
https://tenor.com/view/darkness-kono-suba-anime-blush-heavily-breathing-gif-13932463
…and by “darkness” I mean:
Arifureta has the legendary “Dragon of Darkness”
Oh nice
If Gear or Revue Starlight
I have a hard time deciding on which show is gayer

Also the petite show has a laughing track
Where was that in the anime?
In the game Maya is able to eat mountains of food
Something else
I wanted to know more about them
But appart from girlfriends and rivals
When your acting is so good it manages to fool the acting teacher

They did have my fav scene in the entire season
Tbh
I wanted to see more of them
But Claudine only ever has a relationship with one girl ever
Maybe only except Claudine
But it does feel like Karen has something going on with most of the girls
For example Ayumu and Emma
In love live and such where the cast is big enough, i find it hard to believe there’s much relationship with some of the girls
It feels like she has a well developed relationship with all the girls
I mean
And on rehearsal she can’t say any word over 4 syllables
But everyone in the show and game is always like “you… you are different… what makes you so good?”
I mean the one thing i don’t like about her is that she doesn’t seem to do anything that special
I really liked Karen
This is a rare instance where i think the genki mc is one of the best girls
Banana is the only one that ||was able to beat Maya one on one, and arguably she did it countless times||
I mean
The game is pretty fun
But hey
i'll give it an 8/10
specially from maya and claudine, since they barely had screentime and i feel like ||the second to final fight would've been much more significant|| if they gave them more stuff to do, or at least one chapter dedicated to their relationship
but i felt like i wanted more specially from the other 7 girls
i know that the ending is supposed to mimick the actual "starlight" play
but the ending is a bit underwhelming
and it has a lot of moments that will stick with me
the show is pretty great
ngl
welp i've finished revue starlight
98% shakespeare quotes
1% songs
1% girls fighting
Revue starlight
<:HibikiThink:688429715362414641>
so many questions
does the jiraffe travel to different countries?
<:CarolShock:730816714345938956>
but wait, the revue stage is physical as far as I'm understanding
or if it's the same jiraffe and it just speaks every goddamn language
now i'm wondering if this is a different jiraffe
GREAT
100 points to Karen
ok this face is actually very precious

it's not too big, but it has quality to it
Nana and her harem
What is this? iKaren?

Welcome to the nhentai channel

~~i know that’s why it’s never really a twist~~
It comes off as propaganda tbh
While most of their population is buddist
Also, it also doesn’t help that anime always portrays **THE CATHOLIC** church as evil in anime
But it’s been done so much by now that it lost me
At first sure, seeing the leader of the church as the ultimate baddie was cool
https://tenor.com/view/pee-panicking-what-terrified-gif-15348578
Fantasy/isekai fans when they find out the church is actually evil for the 554th consecutive show:
Actually…
Nanatsu no taizai… the less we talk about that ending the better
No ending
One piece?
The mangaka has little power to stop it
If the studio says “go on with the story”
Even then
They keep going forever
<:NanamiDerp:814622021752979456>
Shonen’s don’t have endings
That’s the best part
Once you kill 1 of something, killing 1000 seems essy
It’s the problem with shonen
Attack on titan went to shit as soon as they hit ||Marley||
Shirobako, comic girls and new game explain a lot of their respective industries
My dress up darling hasn’t yet, but later it goes into a lot of detail on how to do cosplay
They go into a lot of detail on muscles, equipment and such
Iwa kakeru and Dumbell nan kilo definitely do
~~it’s all k-on with some adjustments here and there~~
~~the moe genre isn’t as varied as we think~~
Puraore
Tho there was potential there
And the rival band
Except for the “obscure” part
I think i actually described k-on more than love live
Except for point 4
It’s genius, you combine cute anime girls with tutorial youtube videos
Basically:
• Find something very obscure not many people know about
• Explain it in a lot of detail every time you can and use the proper names for everything
• Random mc who knew nothing about that specific thing but she has a talent for it
• The club has to be about to close down due to lack of members
• Introduce rival group of another school that are the top of the country at that specific thing (even tho that thing is so obscure at most the whole country would have like 5 teams)
With cosplay
But forward into the story my dress up darling dives very deep in the “tutorial” genre
I think this isn’t a spoiler tho
But i guess that same plot works in plenty of shows
I was actually talking about iwa kakeru
Then the girl miraculously has something that makes her op at this thing she didn’t even know existed 5 minutes ago
“Oh welcome! I’m glad you came to our club, the president was just about to close because of lack of students”
Basically the shows that start:
“Oh? What’s this? The box chess club?”
Iwa kakeru too
Then yes
Do they give you tips and rules on how to camp?
Sounen desu ga, hibike euphonium, shirobako
Like dumbell nan kilo, my dress up darling, new game
You know, the anime where the show wants you to learn more about something specific
How come there’s no “Tutorial” anime subgenre?

Harem fans when they supported a random background girl to win the harem and she ended up losing:
<:AlphaSmile:904916969176842240>
Domestic girlfriend’s ending
||senpai ending?||
Yuragi sou? No
Bokuben? No
Quints? No
Tell me one harem that ended great
<:DONE:602895899022065674>
The whole industry
It’s more like
It’s not that shonen’s have shit endings
To be completely fair…
Now to be fair
<:NanamiDerp:814622021752979456>
||half?||
I know how it ends
Hahaha beat you to it
<:NanamiDerp:814622021752979456>
High school dxd ending
Kinda…
Kinda had a good ending???
https://tenor.com/view/bey-blade-gif-5082072
Speaking of… let’s say a different kind of shonen
And it’s being read by less than 0 people
Nanatsu is doing that too
Were you refering to shingeki or fairy tail?
Not even exaggerating
He’s a great villain now
Specially shigaraki
Definitely better than everything else so far
The manga rn is very good actually
I will say keeo going with MHA
Oh…

One is a calming ahow about mahjong
<:AlphaSmile:904916969176842240>
I bet Germany once said that too
**TANKS**
Sports…
I’m guessing my top genre is comedy
And then export the list
I will update my mal
It has a lot of idol elements
Tbh
It kinda is
I mean…
Yeah but im too lazy to switch at this point

All i can watch for stats is this
Ah that explains it
In mal?
Also where do you check those stats?
In which case they go a lot
Unless it’s abandoned
They barely go to school
Monogatari is almost in all of them
Each jojo part has it’s own ending
You really have to look at each part individually
I don’t think jojo is going to have 1 ending
And because jojo is very chaotic, you can almost end it anywhere
Because araki ends the story when he feels like it
The mangaka just grew tired of it i think
So it wasn’t because of poor sales
And the manga was doing great!
It needed at least 2 more volumes
Suddenly we were at the endgame
<:Whatson:765435872891764779>
It ended too soon
Which rather than ending too late
And then there’s quintuplets
And they jjst keep going for 50 more chapters
Because they usually have a perfectly good ending in sight
Or rather when
Japanese don’t know how to finish their stories
**GAS GAS GAS**
https://tenor.com/view/anime-girls-und-panzer-tank-mika-bt42-gif-15974870
Either way
I haven’t watched chihayafuru haha
I got confused
Well that
Maybe because of the knife
…dreaming girl psychological?
“I yes i was the togepi”

…lost his head
You might say he…
It’s the anime from which Maware Setsugetsuka came from, it is the ending
Also if any of you play bandori
And a more bri’ish references than Jojo
But with robots
Imagine Chivalry of a failed knight
Yesterday i finished Unbreakable machine doll
But she’s very good
It’s the only gif of her
But in revue
Basically Yukina
https://tenor.com/view/starira-akira-yukishiro-akira-revue-starlight-revstar-gif-24125012
I wanted to see Akira
Come on!
Does it include ||the other schools?||
…well it had to start somewhere
It started in bandori 2 and…
D4DJ is the culmination of kraftoegu perfecting it’s CGI
Sometimes not even that haha
Anime nowadays only needs to be mildly successful to get another season
It will get a S2
#trynottocrychallange
https://youtu.be/vHyv7cJRvYE
But it got less and less interesting as it went on
To me super star started great
They don’t fit the rest of the girls
Well they really didn’t do that good a job tbh
Maybe later
~~i couldn’t tell~~
And like her character dearly
I’m sure they’ll all respect her a lot
Lanzhu
*loving*
I can’t wait to see the community that only watches the anime…
Love Live, now with 50% more precure
I had to google liella’s rival team’s name haha
But no rival group in love live is good tbh
They’re the best rival team sure
<:NanamiDerp:814622021752979456>
Imagine caring about the rival groups
All eyes on Maru and Yoshiko
Just ignore the shitty movie
It’s kinda forgettable
I can’t remember much about liella tbh
I love sunshine
Not for me tbh
At least in my opinion
It’s not that good
Ideal superstar experience
Just watch Sumire’s ep
Not worth it
Laughs in:

I still need to watch the movie

**I AM HOOKED**
But after seeing the premise
At first this anime didn’t seem all too appealing
You know
It’s citrus
Citrus

That or domestic no kanojo
FISHING EDITION
It’s citrus

Oh boy!!!
That also works
“You know how schools already use sailor uniforms?”
Or
“What if instead of boat girls, they were girls on boats?”
Either:
Haifuri was born by either one of two thought processes
the new bandori is off the HOOK
The double lenght cord stayed
It’s a super obscure reference
So that way he managed to get x12 the speed
And he spinned while launching for an extra x3
Then jumped for an extra x2 multiplier
So he made his cord twice as long
Kenny told him he needed his blade to be 12 times faster than Carlos’ for him to win
Yes, but he actually used that technique to beat the first bad guy in the show
It’s a reference to episode 1 of the original beyblade, on how Tyson beat Carlos
<:HinaHigh:748403493873647678> <:HinaHigh:748403493873647678> <:HinaHigh:748403493873647678>

Just put a couple more gears in the launcher
Finally started yuki yuuna
<:AyaJii:585567196344877087>
He’s not wrong

<:NanamiUwU:756325401533612132>
More Nanami
I knew they were going to give us this instead of Bandori 4
I fucking knew it!
More than any other seasonal waifu
However she’s **FUCKING EVERYWHERE!!!**
Her smile is precious
Just a relationship between a girl that has volume set to 1 and a boy that overthinks waaaaaay too much
There’s nothing lewd, nothing risky
The show is just wholesome all the way
This is what i’ve been waiting the whole past season


she's just the most fun character
not as a waifu
and NO!
my fav from DAL

The 3rd part of das finale
Now for animovies i need to watch
-EVA fans
But idk exactly what it was
I am sure i watched something extremely well made
Idk what to give to the revue starlight movie
Because if I can’t
To a movie where I understood **NOTHING**?!
Can I give a 10 or a 9/10
<:Whatson:765435872891764779>
Because idolmaster is mostly a harem show
That can only end poorly
This anime has a very serious case of “gender bend fetish”
But with high school dxd
https://tenor.com/view/twgok-katsuragi-keima-keima-kaminomi-the-world-god-only-knows-gif-19635086
For perverts
So it’s the world god only knows
Don’t know it
Does he have any other work?
Nice
It’s called “Miss Kuroitsu from the monster development department”
I just found another one that’s also dumb fun
I like dumb fun anime
I wish it continued tbh
It’s one of those shows that you just don’t have to analyze
It had infinite merch potential
I still don’t understand how that happened
Keijo is the anime you see when you’ve given up in life
I don’t think keijo is anyone’s taste
<:AyaJii:585567196344877087>
If I did that I’d give Keijo a 10/10
But at the same time
Yes
There’s already gifs
Yes!

Octopus head
The dissappearance of Kumiko Suzumiya
And the shirobako movie!
And the saekano movie
The show in general gets a 7/10 it’s enjoyable
I finished this show
It actually felt like i was watching a girl that was very passionate about her work, but also wanted to climb up the executive ladder
She’s amazing she has a ton of personality
||Shizu||
||now i get what kanade fans feel||
<:DONE:602895899022065674>

Episode 8
I began watching the slime anime
She has a lot of personality
Kuroitsu herself is amazing
Even then
It’s very good, I’m sure if I watched Tokusatsu i’d like it even more
Easily the best part of the show
Miss Kuroitsu herself? 128719/10
https://tenor.com/view/squidward-oh-no-hes-hot-shaking-spongebob-squarepants-gif-17307856

It’s been a while since i watched a reverse harem and-
I’ll watch fruits basket instead
Which is why i am not watching it
This whole first episode is nothing but explaining!
Jesus christ stop!!!!

Why does this anime start with so much exposition?!
Jesus christ will all this be on the final test?

With a last minute bycicle kick goal at the 93’ minute
That has every single match end 4-3
Instead of something like captain tsubasa
And is realistic
But the way they play football (soccer) makes sense
The main general plot is bullshit
There is a show called Area no kishi
Not in serious issues sports anime
But these usually come in comedies
I am fine with anime logic in sports shows
And into the green
Goes flying
Hits a rake that was randomly on the course
I mean the mc hits a ball that passes precisely between two train wagons
When it clearly has bullshit golf logic
The fact that it is so serious

Speaking of namco
Suddenly gundam

Sure…
Wii sports reference…
There are many ways to start your golf anime
it's just another CGDCT
it's nothing more than that
yeah
i mean
it's not that uncommon
a lot of moes have fan service
…Just like I like them
A very by the books moe, very simple that adds absolutely **NOTHING** to the genre
RPG Real State
The return of the gif queen

Holy shit it’s today??
which i'm doing rn
it actually made me wanna rewatch new game haha
i felt like it was a combination between gochiuusa and new game
In everything you just said
I feel the exact opposite
Immediate drop for me then

I know of more epic words in harem anime
We are instead focusing on the voice acting team
But instead of focusing on the art team
It really looks like New Game
I am always up for a CGDCT
Meh why not
VN?
We have a winner



We will see the wheel creating an anime where cute girls…
Today on the cute girls doing cute things roulette!
Here they sing to cure
Also healer girl is symphogear but backwards
Maybe they can pull something out their sleeve
There’s still 11 more episodes left
Yet
Some of the girls are not developed in the slightest
But yeah
Yeah I get that, but a large cast isn’t necessarily a bad thing and i’d argue some of the girls don’t need that big an introduction since they are based on archetypes you probably already know by this point if you’re watching this anime
Because i already have 13
Which i think will be the last seasonal i’ll watch
Time to check out healer girl
But you really can’t go wrong with Chuunibyo girls
Also her

I really like her
Watch out for Yukina Minato 2.0 over here

Because Aharen san exists
Maybe it’s not my favorite…
It reminds me a lot of Shirobako
How does it have 6.43 on MAL is beyond me

I think i’ve found my fav anime of the year so far
Shouldn’t season 2 exist by now?
That’s just bofuri

No wait that’s every isekai ever
“I was a loser until I got transported to another world and now i have a harem and bullshit powers for some reason”
Arifureta in a nutshell
“I went to another world but instead of an ability the goddess mugged me and sent me buck naked to that world, now I seek vengeance”
I dropped that one
<:NanamiDerp:814622021752979456>
Anime itself is an isekai
Anything can be an isekai if you try hard enough
It’s not interesting at all
But we barely see the other world
Since Tohru does live in another world and she uses portals
I mean i guess it counts
<:DONE:602895899022065674>
All I can find online is people saying the best reverse isekai is dragon maid
Gate?
They bring a fantasy world to new york so i’d say yes
Is kekkai sensen a reverse isekai?
https://tenor.com/view/thumbs-up-klaus-kekkai-sensen-gif-13930752
God bless his soul
Except Klaus
In 24 episodes i never really cared for Leo or Libra or anything regarding the main cast
I love the world
…the main plot sucked tho
The world they created was fucking fantastic
And that one had one of the best world building i’ve ever seen in any show
I just finished kekkai sensen
<:AyaJii:585567196344877087>
That’s why most suck
But in otome isekais the mc already knows all about the game they’re transported to
Half the point of isekais is the mc exploring a new world he doesn’t know
Are otome isekais the best options for isekai?
damn, the new season of ai mai mi looks fire

Ok this episode was kinda nice tbf
If this weeks episode of Shikimori is not good again I’m dropping it
120 USD
I got mine from a local store
<:chisatolol:774138056168308776>
The duality of healer girl in a single eye catcher

With the azur flash pose
I also have the tsubasa figma
But her visual novel design
I love the fact that it’s not her anime look
Which is a plastic that can be see through
Something like polyethilene
My guess is that a thermoplastic was used to make it
<:chisatolol:774138056168308776>
It’s just a swimsuit
You do realize her default look is a bunny suit right?
Had to pay extra customs taxes but it was worth it

You were saying?

Just when you thought MAL ratings couldn’t get any worse

Yup
…absolutely

Shikimori? No
Aharen? No
Yor? No
Girl of the season?
Shirabain’t
I have that problem with nendos actually
Yep that’s a great price
That’ll look great
Please hahaha
Be in the same universe?
And Miss Kuroitsu
Love after world domination
Man can
Ah I see

You want to watch an anituber that’s not focused on anime?
And not really to their opinions
And only pay attention to their jokes
Hmm i follow some anitubers, but i mainly use them as background noise
Crunchyroll be like: “watch symphogear! Now is the time to start watching it… on season 5 of 5”
Gigguk be like:
<:HinaHigh:748403493873647678>
And i’m like: “yeah that’s what happens when you start from season 5”
I tried to watch symphogear, but i didn’t understand it, suddenly these 6 girls were fighting a giant robot in antartica

damn

thank you very much

Nice
Who the fuck took out the guy with the Darkrai and the Latios?
that's not shioriko!
she discovers Setsuna's identity by accident and when she finds out she's all like "hey dw president, you're doing a good job, keep at it!"
word by word
anime shioriko does **LITERALLY** the exact opposite of that
She trusted her own ideology so hard that she rejected Setsuna's way so hard she forced a new election so that she could take the power from her and install her way of thinking
she discovered Setsuna's true identity by her own deduction and cleaverness, not by Ayumu randomly spitting out the truth at the right moment
they ruined what what was a pretty interesting character hard
fr
fuck anime Shioriko
man
can I rant?
It is trust me
21% gay
So like 99% of all manga
In cuckoos they’re treating like shit a dude that can beat their asses both in a fight and in academics
So i’m sure there would be a couple of assholes that would treat shirogane poorly only because he is from a poor household
Because shuuchin only has the elite of the country
And shuuchin actually has more of a reason to do so
Imagine if they did that to Shirogane in Kaguya sama haha
Only because he’s poor
When the dude is actually pretty fucking smart, strong, and good looking
They started doing the “gotta make fun of the mc” cliche
It feels like worse Nisekoi
I don’t see it tbh
No thank you
But everything around her…
Shikimori herself was pretty great
Already dropped two shows, Shikimori and Pair of cucoos
Miku’s **HIBIKI**:

Ah! I see you also attended Setsuna Yuki’s school for the culinary gifted
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibu_aoDrgTk
i know all about russian cuisine don't worry

Every update fixes something only to break something else
As a fifa player i can assure you mapls would be shit if new game online was developed by EA
Bufuri is funny tho
That’s the entire plot
Integral of a function where 
x -> 100
99.99999999999
Can’t wait for the new opening
<:Whatson:765435872891764779>
Did he finally reach over 1%
Why is he here?
Will the universe be ok?
Ummmmmmmm…..

Hmm true
Found him
Hahaha i just noticed chris
He is more of a “I want to be the protagonist” kind of guy
Which most of the times causes problems for everybody
Just very full of himself
But he’s not really evil
But i do think kaiba is seen as an evil force in the ygo universe
I am mostly joking
Yeah i know
The manga
2012-2016
Yeah
I think 2014
Idk if this list was made before assclass ended
Absolutely
The yellow circle
…but he’s not… a good person
He is by far my fav character in any form of media
I love koro sensei
Koro sensei also caused most of the issues in assclass
By that logic
And even he didn’t really cause any deaths (at least not directly)
I’d say Pegasus was far more deserving of pain
So a rich asshole that caused inconveniences is more deserving of pain than a serial killer?
Who fires people too quickly
Kaiba is just an asshole
Kaiba is 50/35
Koro sensei is 40/35
…||koro sensei killed hundreds||
How is kaiba more derserving of pain than koro sensei
https://tenor.com/view/konosuba-yunyun-birthday-cake-happy-birhtday-gif-15623182
She has done nothing wrong
Why is Yunyun a 35 on deserved?
Oh come on
Found him
Good
Where they put Okabe?
Speaking of witnessing deaths of loved ones
Gaara at least suffers more than Trunks
But Gaara did go through a lot
Yeah I know and I understand that
Gaara is by far the character that suffered the most in Naruto
Specially his father
Everyone tried to kill him while he was an infant
Gaara is close to 100
**FUCK OFF**
**GAARA IS NOT A 75 ON SUFFERING**
…
At least a 30 on the X
His father tho…
5/55
He trusted Dio **WAAAAAAAY TOO MUCH**
Jonathan deserved it a lil’ bit
Ok… hot take

It got a bit too high on the conversation
Let me repost it
I haven’t seen Toaru
I guess because it seems he did “All for Japan”
Yeah maybe
Current
Lelouche deserved to be higher on the “how much he deserved”
…the worst of them all
He died a hero
Should’ve suffered more
He will just be forgotten
As a hero or a villain
When ver suffers the most is when geenjurou tells him he isn’t getting any recognition
He never truly suffers a lot
Which by pure luck i chose ver
I’d put her around 90:50
And a bit higher in deserving
She would be much higher on suffering atm
Yeah we didn’t have Toga’s full backstory yet
We didn’t have the full scope of what Toga did in her past
Because i’m sure when this list came out
And i’m glad
She’s at the very least a 40
Himiko Toga is not a 10 on suffering anymore
At least at this point in the manga
But all he can feel is being killed forever
And is conscious
At least Diavolo feels something
That Kars eventually stopped thinking
The anime says
Or being forced to live deaths for the rest of time?
Being launched into space while you’re inmortal?
Which “death” is worse?
Hmm
I just noticed Yamcha hahaha
It’s more on his promotion team
But it’s not really his fault entirely…
He does suffer specially in his pride
I say mr satan is perfect
Is because of something he did in the first place
Most of the time Vegeta suffers
Vegeta is perfect tho
Specially him since he killed hundreds of thousands
Shinigami world
Apparently he had to suffer deaths for the rest of time in the shinifaminworld
80:30
But more deserving than Light Yagami?
I hate Ver as much as the next guy
Shokugeki no healer
Just animate more russian food
<:DONE:602895899022065674>
And just play the op at the end like they did
They could’ve left the ed out
Yeah it felt kinda out of place
Ummm did Healer girl mix up it’s op and it’s ending this week?
...i have no idea what the fuck did i watch
i just finished ep 7 of elaina
well
Elaina whenever she finds a new town
At least wait for your show to end first
Eve, no going Turbo

Speaking of birdie wing
**the world is actually very fucked up**
As she discovers the one undeniable truth
Watch Elaina embarc on a journey to discover the world!
Imagine how many content warnings ep 3 of FMAB would need
This one is just a crazy girl
Meh, i’ve seen much worse
I just finished it
Yeah ep 9
it felt like an acid trip


https://tenor.com/view/johntron-i-have-several-questions-gif-9543284
Me:
After credits scene occurs*
Watching birdie wing: “damn this is an amazing match! I can’t wait for next week’s episode”

Look at how much drip Hanamaru, Dia and Kanan have
Shield hero is trash
Nah. That’s just in the manga so far
I thought she was going to be a generic no personality villain
Vipere is also fun
Rose might be one of my fav characters ever
Just gonna say
Not gonna spoil it
I think you should’ve ommited the OP for this episode tbh…
Ep 8 of Birdie wing starts:
**DEATH, DEATH, DESPAIR, HOLY SHIT, WHAT THE FUCK?!, AAAHH!!!** *Venus Line! Venus Line!*
Indeed
Remember, the only way you can be truly evil in anime is by being head of a church
…
His goal is to enslave the world
He’s very clearly the bad guy
That doesn’t make him not a villain
And does stuff with that goal in mind
He actively wants to take over the world
And kills them
He sets traps for heroes to fall into
No he’s not haha
Ainz is actually very evil
Overlord?
It actually ended kinda hype with ||2 sets of heroes from different worlds about to go to war with each other to save their own world||
**AND THEN A TURTLE ATTACKED AND IT ALL WENT TO SHIT**
And it had potential
It was interesting in season 1
And the viewer is like “of course i’m awesome”
Also so that the harem of girls can be like “oh wow you’re awesome i’m so in love with you”
And it’s made that way because you’re supposed to imagine yourself as the hero
Who have all the personality of an empty box
I mean consider the fact that isekai has protagonsits like Kirito and Rimuru
Both of which are not in isekai
Or a dude who was born with an ability that seems worthless but then he discovers it’s actually amazing
In isekai it’s mostly a dude who’s overpowered and discovers ways to abuse the world’s power system
Not in isekai at least
Even if it was underhanded
And just did whatever it took to win
It felt like he cared little for rules or power
He was actually interesting
They ripped Naofomi out of every single ounce of personality he had
A yoyo hero
A punch hero
We have a sword hero
That symphogear needs a “Shield hero”
I got myself stuck thinking
Maybe a fantasy moe…
Before every anime wanted to “subvert our expectations”
Maybe a 90’s one
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
~~Like Ver~~
He is a true hero
https://tenor.com/view/anime-stroheim-death-of-stroheim-gif-18513082
<:AyaJii:585567196344877087>
Remember, in Jojo the nazis are the good guys
Which… i don’t blame them
So for them the catholic church is always evil
And the majority of the country is buddhist
I mean… japan is not without some propaganda
Angel nep
<:hayasaka:770511026298028072> <:hayasaka:770511026298028072> <:hayasaka:770511026298028072>

This show is progressively getting gayer by the episode

Birdie Wing 9:
Girl: I don't understand english i'm sorry.
Eve: Oh let me speak japanese then.
Girl: Wait you speak japanese?
Eve: Huh... apparently I do...
Nice
<:AlphaSmile:904916969176842240>
Even RPG Real State?
How to kill your very own Anya
Season 2 already had an ending to the whole story!
What the fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuck

You could do more Haruhi
But you could
I wouldn’t tbh
Sure you could adapt that…
There’s also a manga of Azusa, Ui and the other girls that join later
K-on should be finished as well
canon Chika neso
ummmmmmmm

Me every 5 seconds:
No one:

**WAKARIMASU**
Perfect
https://tenor.com/view/teekyuu-kemono-friends-oshawott-tsukasa-hiiragi-wolfyuchu-gif-22095185
I prefer the real Studio Mappa magnum opus
https://tenor.com/view/chainsaw-man-gif-23116626
It’s abysmal
Oh and on the MAL page it started recommending me School Days as a “You may also like”
I’ll just say this is probably the worst finale i’ve seen to anything ever
I really do not feel comfortable explaining what happens in the ep

Let’s just say ep 12 of season 2 starts like this:
Well…
That sounds like the worst thing ever let’s do it
You know I always wanted my kaguya + dr stone anime to have a Goblin Slayer type last episode
https://tenor.com/view/jon-tron-what-what-the-fuck-wtf-surprised-gif-4633333
Finished s2 of science fell in love
i think i rather watch that one
but i really wanna know what's the relationship between this teacher and that student
i know i should be paying attention to lipxlip and suzumi's story
catching up with heroines run the show

The puppet!
**YOSHINON!**
No, not Yoshino…
Yoshinon has been more important to the overall plot
At this point
<:HinaHigh:748403493873647678>
As soon as she leaves the one scene you give her every 8 episodes you forget she even exists
Stop trying to make Mana important
Also fuck off DAL
PS2 graphics
Nice!
<a:ChrisOOO:744677270765043874>
OMFG THE OBVIOUS TWIST VILLAIN WAS ACTUALLY AN OBVIOUS TWIST VILLAIN
Heroines run the show spoilers
Hellooooo nesoberis

Thaaaaat’s racist
Best girl
Female Shido
Oh wait, I remember now
Who’s this supposed to be?

Watching DAL 4
And the last episode was so bad, I had to put it here
And I only finished it because it felt pretty generic until the last episode
I only finished one of them
The worst 3 shows I saw in Spring 2022
Yeah… sounds about right mirai nikki + arifureta
And… arifureta
Or… campione?
It’s mirai nikki + high school dxd
Ah I see
Time to watch engage kiss
Nice
New yuribait?
**WAKARANAI**
And the supporting cast is basically non existent
But the dude in Shikimori isn’t small and fragile, he’s a literal baby, who can’t even defend against the wind blowing the other way he’s walking
I have no problem on having a romcom about a girl that’s strong and takes care of a small and fragile boy, I love Hitomi-chan’s manga
Or battlesuits?
Are symphogears exoskeletons?
…yes, the genre is that baren
I said the best of them all
She’s there…
I mean she rarely appears, she could be written off the show and little would change but

It has exoskeleton armor
Oh! Date a live
I got nothing
Shingeki muhai no bahamut???
…
There are cool exoskeleton anime like
Oh come on don’t say that
That’s like going from Infinite Stratos to Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood hahaha
I think i gave up in ep 5
Also discount rina chan board
The USA after korean kids change some components on their pc
Points for actually making me laugh out loud
Human beings all over the world be like
The hero chapter
And that’s how this was born
“Ok gentlemen we need an idea for a new anime! I hear you!”

“I want a football anime!”

“No no! Those always fail! Let’s make a basketball anime!”

“Nah… you already have the big two… what about a volleyball anime?”

“And compete with Haikyuu?! Are you mad?! Let’s make a baseball anime instead!”

“No! You all promised our next project was going to be an idol show!”

“Gentlemen… gentlemen… please… calm down… I think you are all correct!”
There’s a football/baseball/basketball/volleyball/idol show
God this season is dry
It’s from this season
It’s literally called “Parallel world pharmacy”
It’s literally Musoku tensei but worse in every way
I standed… 15 minutes!
It’s already boring me to the point of making me fall asleep
3 minutes into “another world pharmacy”
She took down Sasori at the beginning of Shippuden
But she can definitely fight
She just cries a lot
She’s not as useless as people say
Yes btw
Sakura Haruno from Naruto
**LITERALLY THE TWO STRONGEST NINJAS IN THE WHOLE SHOW**
People call her useless because she’s not as strong as Naruto and Sasuke
Physically there’s no stronger Kunoichi
Blu, Mac, Frankie, Wildo, Eduardo, Coco, Madam Foster
Mr Herriman
Just checked
Wasn’t he just called Mr Hare?

You know what that means!
Oh no! The mc of this idol show decided to train all night for a final coming up instead of resting
At this point this anime has more sports than your typical Mario + Sonic at the Olympics video game
They added badminton and handball
This season of captain tsubasa looks weird

Maybe it was Bloo

I finished Shaman King 2021
<:despair:768014009831915540>
Either for a game or a manga
90% of all anime is just an ad
The moment you realize
But it sometimes felt like the anime went on fastforward
Mainly Hao
Overall some things are better than in the original
It’s Mari Bros
give us hitomi chan anime
goddamit
Either that or Quints’ Merch staff sucked
**BACK IN MY DAY** figures weren’t released until season 2
They’re dropping then quickly lately
Rip my wallet
I got bored and made a top 100 because i started reading “100 girl harem”
Some people like to make top 10 waifus
…i seriously doubt that tbh
Back in January they said that S2 was gonna air in 2022

I decided to start collecting the manga of the shield monster
Ah yes, BanG BanG
<:HinaHigh:748403493873647678>
Also the fact that in a baseball team there’s 9 players
Cinderella 9?
https://tenor.com/view/ssbu-joker-persona5-gun-neutral-special-gif-15650650
Add Chisato to Smash
“In my next game there will be an enemy just like chisato, beautiful, deadly and bullets won’t work on it”
Could you present him, his life, where he lives and all about him in a full paragraph please?
I don’t know him
Do you think the script just had:
-oh.. oh. Oh!
-oh…
-oh… OH!
-oh?
What were the dialogues here?!

The timeline where Tsubiki is canon
But better than those
At all
It’s not good…
Girlfriend girlfriend is definitely better than Aho girl and Mangaka san to Assistant san
That’s just Kekkai Sensen

<:CarolSmug:617040484111745027>
Be more specific next time
This show has gay
Hey you wanted gay
And Yoshi
I think Mika is confirmed gay at this point
~~even then it’s much better than the 80% of his son~~
At least 40%
Oh for sure
Maybe they can squeeze 700 episodes out of his story
Yooooo they finally giving Boruto’s father his own anime
Sega: Sir our publicity stunt worked. Everyone is talking about our hideous Sonic model in the movie and therefore is a hit.

Mario: …i can do that too
You are expecting yuri vibes unless it’s idolmaster
I mean it’s idols
It’s already fun in the first 5 minutes
Just started the haifuri OVA
Comic girls tho?
And it was just ok
Yeah but hitoribocchi was also that
I went in expecting a generic band anime
Why is the first episode of Bocchi the Rock so fantastic?!
Yeah… it’s fucking awesome
Watched ep 1 of CSM
Same energy
https://tenor.com/view/kaos-comic-girls-anime-kawaii-shiver-gif-11828258
Peak social anxiety
And now i’m watching a show about maids killing each other

Did an anime manage to be weirder than pop team epic this season?
How in the blessed name of Yoko Hikasa
<:chisatolol:774138056168308776>
And the seiyuus every 1
They change the artstyle every 2 scenes
**IN THEIR FIRST EPISODE**
Just Maid wars and Chainsawman have at least 100 bodies combined
How big is the body count this season so far
I am curious
I call it Maidoka Magika

I love her already

Props to them for not using Pokemon Hot / Pokemon Cold yet
Bandori predicted the newest pokemon games

Huh
Did I jump between multiverses?
Nothing about that sentence sounds like it belongs together
**WHAT EVEN IS THIS SENTENCE?!**
https://tenor.com/view/sour-lemon-poputepipikku-lick-pop-team-epic-gif-16566362
For a shitpost anime
At the very least they lost that day of recording just to do 3 lines of dialogues
However, if Cue! Is any indication of how the world of seiyuus work
Also i don’t expect each seiyuu to spend more than half an hour on each of their lines
I find it amusing
35 of them being male and 35 of them female
And none of them have pages on MAL with 70 seiyuus listed for a single character
I have seen other anime shitposts like ai mai mii
<:AyaJii:585567196344877087>
Just plenty of seiyuus for the same 2 girls
Pop team epic doesn’t need many characters
<:HibikiSmug:672655850518609940>
They’re trying to compete with pop team epic
Oh how cute
<:ChrisEnraged:423196924368388105>

Imagine drinking coffee and turning into Mari Ohara

For her not apparently
Bocchi emotes

Gochiusa out of context
She knows that anything under 5k pieces is not worth it
Cocoa knows her puzzles!

You know what that means!
It seems i have arrived to the ed for Gochiusa season 2

Jesus season 2 of Kancolle starts dark
The eyes of a girl that has seen most of her friends die
The eyes of a girl that has hopes and dreams
Politics but no Maoyuu
If so yes
Is this where the lights are rainbow?

Odaiba is beautiful

This is Setsuna’s POV

Bocchi the **HOLY FUCK**
Koumei*
I had so much fun with it
Not even kidding
I’d put those two and also birdie wing
but at the end of the day, both are character driven shows... Lyco has better characters overall
it took me a long time to decide on my AOTY between Lyco and Boch
that first ep of akiba maid wars was amazing
because jesus christ that fight was amazing
i also had Katana vs Chainsaw
I also had the Shimokitazawa Tsuchinoko as candidate for best scene
My best in anime this 2022
Koharu out of context
So bocchi didn’t appear first in bocchi
Yup, idk why i put it on hold back then
Is bocchi gay?
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
Sakura Trick S2 when?
Because of the insane fans that’ll be like “WHAT NO!!! SHE CAN’T BE GAY! SHE’S IN LOVE WITH ME!”
They risk losing sales if they come out and explicitly calling them gfs
And i also know it’s because #Japan
Yeah i know
Because otherwise I get more lesbian energy from any given line from Kaoru Seta
Not “very good friends who like each other very much”
Call them actual girlfriends
I really want them to make it more explicit
And bloom into you
Maybe i’ll watch adachi
At least sympho has a kiss
Symphogear is more actual yuri than birdie wing
I really doubt it got many viewers at all
If people didn’t watch it here in the sympho server
Imma be real with you
Birdie wing is yuri bait
https://tenor.com/view/kanan-matsuura-love-live-anime-no-cute-gif-17789980
I’ll add those
Not yuri bait
Is there an actual yuri show that’s not trash?
“How cute you are. You really thought I was gonna kiss you?”
Also the gif is in spanish for some reason haha
“My wife had sex with another chick! Thank you god!”
To quote Peter Griffin…

Yuri ntr
I see no leaps in logic
<a:ChrisShifty:744677308631089162>
~~isn’t wanting your best girl to hook up with another guy (anime mc) kinda ntr?~~
It’s very clearly not just a “i look up to her”
Because Kita is very explicitly in love with Ryou
The anime, not the character
This is a factual statement
I swear to christ if she’s a painter…
<:HinaHigh:748403493873647678>

And she’s called Mahiru Shiina…
So she looks like this

There’s 2 now
No wait!
There’s only 1
**NO!!!**
Then watch the movies
<:HinaHigh:748403493873647678>
Or just watch Trinity Seven
Is just like infinite stratos
That one
UNDEFEATED BAHAMUT CHRONICLES!
Fuck what was the name of that anime
What’s this anime called? The one that’s infinite stratos but with a guy that has never won a match, but also never lost
Ah… i see what you want now
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
Infinite stratos also has 2 seasons
I mean i can’t blame you
Or what about testament of a new sister devil?
The absolute most delicious junk
Teekyuu is like… the best big mac in the world
The best trash
https://tenor.com/view/ramen-anime-food-noodles-eat-gif-7359396
Or if you want trash that’s not harem or ecchi
<:haaHaakyan:827996718754693171>
And that’s all it had
Bad trash: The 8th son are you kidding me
Good trash: The hidden dungeon only I can enter
Because those 2 are completely different genres
https://youtu.be/Zq0e8zaS3aE
Pretty trashy
There’s also Noucome
I gotta make that perfectly clear
(Some stories)
There’s an anime called One Room… which ngl i enjoyed more than I probably should’ve

We’ve watched way too much trash guys
There’s also Murenase
Or for fast trash you can watch “ao-chan can’t study”
But Mayo Chiki is actually kinda wholesome
There’s Mayo Chiki
If you want more “retro trash”
And absolutely lost interest
I got to the part where they started filming a commercial
This one
Too trashy for me
I couldn’t stand that one

Strike the blood?
The only thing i am liking about this anime is the fact the mc’s favorite spell is making others slip
<:haaHaakyan:827996718754693171> <:haaHaakyan:827996718754693171> <:haaHaakyan:827996718754693171>

So it makes you weak to like 5 types for the tradeoff of resisting 3
If the people in this world have 2 or 3 affinities it makes you double as weak to every other affinity
Who would buy this coat?!

There’s also an anime called Renai Boukun
The scene makes no sense in context either so don’t even bother
https://tenor.com/view/ai-mai-mi-japanese-japanese-anime-anime-manga-gif-5685437
There’s also Ai mai mii
So true

<:haaHaakyan:827996718754693171>
This isn’t the wichis
Or what about a show about magic girls with engines in their feet and no pants?
<:ayawoe:899797632644440064>
But it has sexual harassment
Is yuru yuri trash?
But at least she gets blue archive ost
Umm….. hi Mugi, how are you?
Found best girl
Her **BLOODLUST AND BRUTALITY**
It’s good to see back Maple and her most charming feature
Ah yes Bofuri season 2
For some reason I am liking this a lot

Kirbocchi The Rock
Kirbocchi

One of the scenes ever
If you want a more deep story with real drama, you actually get that in the manga but it’s muuuuuch later in the story
At least that’s my opinion
So they do compliment each other well as a couple
And Tsukasa has no real skills with handmade stuff. While Nasa can make a rocket by dismantling a microwave
Nasa has 0 knowledgeable on pop culture, while Tsukasa gulps anime and video game like it’s water
And vicebersa
Basically Nasa is great at things Tsukasa is awful at
I like both Tsukasa and Nasa a lot. Of course the manga dwells deeper in their characters but they complement each other nicely
It’s the first manga I ever read without an anime
I like tonikawa tbh
Get maried in chapter 2, then figure things out as you go
Even chader Tonikaku Kawaii
Anime 102: Literally the last chapter. Do 24 pages of him saying “I Love You” and then do a fast forward to their wedding
As much as all of us wish it did
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
That hasn’t stopped rent a gf
They need at least 250 chapters for them to end up together
I know how these work
It’s a romance story
Suzu:

Ayakashi triangle
Onimai
Reborn to master the blade
I also count being reincarnated into a girl
If I had a dollar for each anime where a male turns into a girl this season i’d have 3 dollars. Which isn’t a lot but it’s weird there’s 3 airing at the same time
Feels like a reboot of Muse
It’s… fine
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
Then you’ve watched 1/4
Or half as in half of s1?
Half as in all of s1

Plenty, yes
Just with a much better Honoka
That explains the godly animation on the ed for some reason
Yes! For example, our interest for the show!
Kancolle - We gonna make this a very dark season!! A lot of deaths!
I might drop it at this point
3rd delay
…
Why do I hear: “**BOOOOOOSTOOO FIYAAAAAAAAHHHH!!!!!!!! FULL POWAAAAHHHH!!!!**”
They always want to surprise everyone (sometimes for the worse)
But nintendo absolutely **DESPISES** doing what you think they’ll do
That’s what we’re all expecting at this point
I mean
Nintendo needs to start their NCU
After the first Smash movie
The twist is, this is the actual dub and not littlekuriboh
I’m glad we got this one
It’s not that common for mc’s to actually have a personality
Ignis
Best… girl?

<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
Sawman
A cerfitied W for the 3 people ever that shipped Kirika and Elfnein
Then this girl is proof that Kirika doesn’t end up with Shirabe, but with Carol
Shirabe genes, too stronk
Bang Dream
Love after world domination
D4DJ
Oh we did that but with Keijo
<a:KitaPanic:1045506241536999544>
But my “On Hold” list is unending
Same, I paused at ep 4
This is where they live
And of course
Shirabe
Rainbow Shirabe
Streamer Shirabe
Space Pirate Shirabe
Sentai Shirabe

I do wonder how truly big is the Shiraverse

https://tenor.com/view/shirobako-aoi-miyamori-sad-crying-curry-gif-21935579
Stop pretending you’re still in high school
Aoi, you’re 27

So it must come from Kirika
And we’re sure she didn’t get that from Shirabe
~~masochism~~
Is voice hereditary?
Shirabe genes too stronk
She’s gonna hijack every moe series
Someone stop this woman!

Jesus christ
Relatable moments*
Because my mind immediately related both ganes
I made a false connection
I know
Yes
So I added a third collab there that never happened
Both collabed recently with SIF
You know what happened?
You’re right
This image doesn’t even have School idol festival who also died a year latee

<:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
Apparently every gacha that makes a collab with Persona dies 1 year later
It received the Persona treatment
It won’t soon
Gotta learn a thing or two from Shirabest girl
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
None of his children look like him at all
How weak are Lelouche’s genes?
Y’know what i haven’t seen?
Manga writers are running out of ideas
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
Too short
As a man
What if she was reincarnated into a mariarchy?
Isekai and fantasy is very much targeted towards males
It’s not marketable
That’s the main issue
Yeah no one does
Also you risk “losing a marketable waifu”
Other than ||futanari but that doesn’t count||
I’ve never seen one of girl to guy tbh
And it’s great
There’s one on emission rn
Exactly
**THAT DOESN’T SEEM TO EXIST FOR SOME REASON!**
But what about… a girl being reincarnated as a man?
I’ve seen reincarnated as a slime, as a wizard, as a vending machine
~~probably lesbians~~
Pink hair, blue eyes
And then maybe just speed it up a bit
But if you added a bit of eurobeat, you’d get a pretty great sympho trio song
https://youtu.be/04kMy7HhWtQ
Maybe it’s just me
Finally Chisato has a neural special
If you ever feel useless just remember Maple’s guild has another shielder
The real Girls und Planes

It treats the reader as if we’re **UNBORN** years old

How to know if the manga you’re about to start reading is bad:

i may raise some hate here but...
Shikimori herself is good, but the rest of the cast I hated with a passion
Even at mid, shikimori literally asks you to forgive a whole anime because of one girl
K on has a movie
You sure?
Shikimori on the same level as Healer Girl?
but every show from 2022 is there
i edited the categories tho
https://tiermaker.com/create/all-anime-of-2022-424928
sure
imo
AoT is still a good show, just **INSANELY** overhyped
there's no point in judging both cours in different entries
also i judged all of spy x family in 1 entry
I still want to know where to watch these subtitles
