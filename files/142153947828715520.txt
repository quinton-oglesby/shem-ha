i hope its total bait and switch and they're asking for help like elfnein at the beginning of GX
sorry :X
who are they talking to , standing still transformed all together, smiling
theres 1 part in the PV that has me like ??
oh i couldnt remember what episode it was exactly but lol its the thumbnail for ep 5 on CR
miku plays the piano in gx
so if anyone's wondering what  they're doing in an icy/snowy place, maybe it's antarctica? the real life version of the book Adam is reading in AxZ 5 is about an ancient civilization based there. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fingerprints_of_the_Gods
So did Chris ever fire the sniper mode that she sets up but the ship goes invisible b4 she can fire in G? Thought i heard it was used in axz but if it was i totally missed it.
time to book a flight to japan real quick, just to have to wait for episode 2 for like 4 weeks lol https://twitter.com/SYMPHOGEAR/status/1138690584267218944
like it was made this month and uses the XV art. stop giving me hope you'll get axz and xv... but like why randomly make it now and use the new key art if you're not gonna get them ahh T_T
that french CR twitter for symphogear keeps irking me
"All loves blazing" "just for you" hibimiku is strong
https://twitter.com/SYMPHOGEAR/status/1139458645907763201
-prays for XV with AXZ as a bonus- <:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
the CR page for the summer simulcasts is up/has started https://www.crunchyroll.com/anime-news/2019/06/17-1/crunchyroll-announces-summer-2019-anime-lineup
I hope its in halves kinda  like axia no kaze with the first half being a pretty normal cover of happy birthday then goes into new and cool kirika guitar birthday stuff.
15 days? i got 13 days 23 hours
like when was Carol's revealed
anyone know/remember if GX always had 8 character CDs announced?
Ive been wanting to make a decent custodian pun for so long xD
Yeah the custodians revolt because chris's bday made such a mess and theyre the ones that have to mop and clean up all the trash.
ah i meant just googling the name and it saying the "did you mean" as immature girl buttocks
lol google  translated shirabe's first song as "immature girl buttocks"
holy shit
5
well idk if XV was actually confirmed as 1 cour yet or not but this tweet confirms it is pretty much https://twitter.com/SYMPHOGEAR/status/1145673599598002176
And nah. They expire after 3 months so if u waited it mighta not workd
Axz probably wont be. XV youll be 1  week behind if free only
Subscribers get 1 to give out every month i think
One of those 48 hour passes?
look at the french and portugese version tho
the english version of it like never updates
? maria starting in london and referencing alexandria?
i hope after XV they remake S1 as a movie except they actually die at the end, then 2nd generation / new characters
'95
o its the same year
i mean fingerprints of god predates eva i think?
24 hours
or was it actually confirmed/said somewhere else
what info made gave the idea that it was in winter? previous time jumps between seasons + the snowy battle scene in the PV?
if its a flashback to something other chars do (the new illuminati trio)/ the previous summer, thatd be like concurrent with GX I think? weird
its thought to be winter because AXZ ends in mid september and its supposedly a couple months at most after
a casket surfacing after centuries? symphogear=jojo again lol
i think
depends where you are. most of the world its saturday afternoon/night
for CR
28-30 hours

true. i heard exterminate was supposed to be final attack in GX but it was changed. though that never specified aufwachen
i will cry if we randomly get an exterminate aufwachen form in XV
metanoia aufwachen 2nd to final
naw, nijiro no flugel final fight music
kinda, AxZ subs being good doesnt mean anything tho, but if axz is bad XV probably will be too
but no eps yet for axz ðŸ˜¦
ooo the slots for axz and xv are up
Maybe they watched some western movies lol
would you say FinÃ©'s hair is kinda Omega shaped?
so if that guy at the start is Enki then is FinÃ© actually Ninhursag / the equivalent?
the name Final Commander makes me worried for <:GenjuurouThumbsUp:336657189475188740>  ðŸ˜¦
it was called Last Ignition for a reason
2pm est
Itll be cool if the G trio get the S1 style part
Holy shit wtf ahhhh
The OP and ED callbacks are amazimg
remember that little factoid about Metanoia being Ai no Tame backwards?  https://youtu.be/RzWTaKs7aaE lol
oh... i kinda just realized maybe this ep is 'why' Tsubasa's CD is last when its usually pretty early
Ah.. seems kinda funny that the govt can just show up and arrest them then lol, though i guess they werent under water
Is the base still the sub?
So is Fudou JP government? Or did govt arrest SONG because Fudous affiliated with them and is a shithead or something?
Im starting to think Fudou is an super asshole but isn't totally evil / just a villain
We have a new most ridiculous attack card yay
time for cooking yumi & co to come in and cook some beef stroganoff to help unpossess miku
What do people think the chance of SSJ amalgam is?
Ah ok
Thought they just said 'that person is long since dead' or something like that
Vanessa is the one that made Ssj faust robe? Is that in the show/ keywords?
This sounds familiar https://twitter.com/Daily_Express/status/1171303917935878144?s=09
Ver Adam and Fudo are the only male villains i think
yeah it'll be rushed, but i'd also be disappointed if they just defeat/kill her normally
and team up with shemha/miku to stop yggdrasiil
i think they'll friend shem ha
hanasaku yuuki duet should be on one too, probably vol 2
Shinais hopefully will be a thing too
Live 2020 the last?
Like did we ever get a 'translation' of the zesshou
Im dumb does hajimari no babel have the zesshou or just the chants in it?
But yeah, maybe Fine and Balal being in the zesshou and the zesshou being in the OG language will be relevant
Im glad at least s1 is going to get a bd release in the west. Hopefully all 5 tho.
7.75 years T-T
Axz is glorious break iirc and gx is hibikis G song
Only G and XV
Soo... i just realized seiten galaxy cross has a really similar line to the XV tagline
Has live 2020 been confirmed officially?
Hmm you sure? Would make sense after kanades death. I thought the whole making 7 symphogears for this purpose thing didnt fit because 2 gungnirs but if she made another one after kanades was destroyed but before Bikki itd make sense
Does it say anywhere how long before G Maria got gungnir/ when it was made?
