They're all a qt tbh
Holy crap, we're just having a whole Symphofall right now

<@263983345669505025> definitely understand that, I'll be looking forward to it in the meantime
Anything with Hibiki, I just need more Hibiki pics, parameters are no holds barred, Bikkifall is a go
Born ready
For Hibiki, I definitely am willing for that, plus I have the storage space <@263983345669505025>
If he posts it again later I'd just save it a second time lol
This is too good, I'm loving this

I'm a new guy here, I only know what <@102691114762371072> told me
<:MikuBliss:336657233712513024>
If you got more, I'm all for it
My sd card probably hates me, but it's so well worth
Can do
<@263983345669505025> I'll always want more lol, but you can go as long as you want, stop whenever you want, but this is great
Oof I see more bikki, time to spam download again

I'll move it over, it can be seen as lewd the more I look at it
The low bitrate drives me nuts, but it's something for now
I like it too, but it's hard for me to come up with an well worded explanation of how I feel about it as the OP
I do have to agree with Chossei that it doesn't really feel like a symphogear song, but when a HQ version comes out I'm definitely getting it and cranking it
And definitely agree on your take of it, still a banger though <@209896097026408449>
OP LEAK

Really good, but gets me WAY too wired
Ugh cold brew
Yes, this is absolutely serious
Walk outside, fire up the grill, gonna make me some burgers. 

Walk inside, 30 seconds to grab some garbage to bring out to the can

>downpour outta fuckin nowhere

Me:
I woke up to seeing this shitshow on Twitter, what a gold mine
It'll most likely die soon, they're using flash animation
I see that pun and I'm both disgusted, and entertained
Welp, I guess I can't be in hell anymore
"So Satan, did it hurt when you fell from grace?"

Satan: "Gtfo"
YEET
Shhhhhh don't tell them that, you'll make them tell you that you're going to hell

(Not you, OP person)
But jesus christ that shit from people pisses me off
Ahhhh ok lol
I'm just going by what the bible legitimately says, if I'm using their argument, might as well take it from their own views, know what I mean?

Or is that directed at OP of that post?
Jfc I fucking hate people that call themselves followers of Christianity but then say you can't be one if you're LGBT.

My rant here, let me know what you think of this stance.

<@102691114762371072> I think that's true all based on how extreme it can go. Some galaxy brains of course overreact, but regular brains typically know when it's going full on extremist
Took me longer than it should have
I'm glad I got away from stereotyping everyone into those impressions
Absolutely
Hell there was a time I was under the same negative assumptions because of the media, took me some time but I woke up (StAy WoKe YoOoOoOoOo)

It's always the extreme minority unfortunately
<:MikuBliss:336657233712513024>
<@175163984197058560> ah ok
<@302063351767498752> now that I know what to search for, I'm seeing it
<@302063351767498752> ahhh ok, I think I'm following, been doing some googling but nothing hard was showing up
I know polyamory isn't my thing and I'd probably be taken aback a bit.
The other question is if the bf is alright with you talking to her as well
I feel if that's the case, you'll probably be alright. But that's something I'd personally say something about sooner than later
<@175163984197058560> yikes, that's a tough thing to make a call on
Call me ignorant, but I'm unaware of said Tom Macdonald argument.
<@302063351767498752> ok...I'm a straight white cis male but you don't see me crying, because I don't speak out my ass like that guy lol
<@183785454447886346> feelsbadman.jpg
Meanwhile here I am still captain of team forever alone lmao
<@284390402210136064> I couldn't help it lol
<@246678192360783872> kinda ironic with  your username tbh lol
Woah, it's lit in here
Real talk here now, there was a point in my life where I wasn't exactly accepting of the transgender community, it just didn't seem right. But holy shit I would NEVER have harmed someone for it even at that time.
I'm just so used to cursing the engineers being a mechanic lmao
That's what I meant tbh
Engineers: "Sounds like a great and futuristic idea"

Normal people: "What the fuck are you thinking"
<@102691114762371072> thank you for clarifying <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
<@102691114762371072> gotcha
I just don't want to ever say the wrong thing
I take it like an actual trap anime character would be acceptable, but as a more insulting shot wouldn't be, correct?
So legitimate question on that end  <@102691114762371072>
^not wrong
I see nothing wrong with dating a trans woman aside from that (and sorry about that)
Take me for example here, I wouldn't be against dating a trans woman, however, (the way I see it) my future of wanting to have kids wouldn't be able to happen naturally. 

Love is love to me, but there are other factors that would make me look for a naturally born woman before that.
Every time I see something like that said or even in the news it disgusted me and still does
And that is a hill I will die on
Cookie dough a besto
Honestly I don't remember where I got it
Jfc get out
And then this is me regularly now, just replace kink
I used to say the same thing until I realized the things that clicked me off in short notice
It may take a while for you to realize something's a fetish, but you'll notice a certain thing will click
^^
The past is the past, but I'll always regret how I used to be towards the gay community all because of one person.
<@284390402210136064> and how true that is, something I finally got past not so long ago
That's back to what I said earlier, some people are able to just brush past it, whatever made you able to do it is irrelevant, the fact remains there are those that aren't as capable of brushing the bullshit off.
And typically I can brush little things off, but just a few insults changed the game immediately and has had me fucked up the past week
Me the other day; at work, show customer how they jacked up the brakes on their car, told them what we had to do. This guy starts yelling, ok fine, then personal insults start firing my way, and it was over from there.
It would be GREAT if words didn't hurt anyone. But some people are more emotionally impacted by things said that they hold either dear to them or may be lost on. It may not hurt you for example, but something that doesn't hurt you, could put someone over the breaking point
Wait, it *isn't* 

Fuck
It can be used as a shorthand, however, 100% of the time that term will be insulting.
Big agree with Saki
To be fair, *most* black people I regularly talk to don't have a problem with the term "black people" but some do prefer "people of color". But I can guarantee saying "blacks" will give you some nice words in response
Or should be...
Hence I'm always asking for more info on things I'm not too educated on when it comes to this topic, perks of having an open mind I guess? <a:ElfneinDoIt:493803070409670657>
