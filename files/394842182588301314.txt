Oh hell yeah Gundam people
That was pretty dumb
I forgot he did that one thing near the end
Though you're right, he didn't really do anything that offensively annoying in Tomino's original quadrilogy
I think I like Hathaway because of the movie
Its really good
Hell yeah
Characters, while doing completely routine things, will just like trip up and stuff at completely random moments.

 
It happens often enough to where its a pattern, but like not so heavily that you expect it all the time.
I think its just because Tomino's brand of slapstick humour is really funny to me
I feel like ZZ gets a lot of hate for its tonal shift, but for whatever reason I don't really mind
I think if I were to rank Gundam things, 0080, Zeta and ZZ would be top 3
Though I did drink a fair bit while watching that
The ones on Whitebase drove me up the wall while watching the original show
I think Al was like the least annoying Gundam child for me lol
Really loved it
No downsides
Series was just perfect for me
0080: War in the Pocket
Zeta is like my second fav Gundam series
Oh nice, enjoy

I'm more a Torres guy myself, but love Astonage to
Looks like my kinda thing
Need to watch sCRYed

Yeah, I just picked up ep 6 and uh
I imagine it gets a lot more interesting later though just based on what's being alluded to...
Just finished episode 5, so far its pretty solid
Started watching Yuuki Yuuna yesterday because of the collab
Cuz some are just recaps too
Literally I was trying to work out what came next and the titles made it so confusing what was what
TBH, season 1 does just work on its own, so I won't be too annoyed if I don't enjoy them
Ahhhh I see
Like 4 eps
The first section feels quite standard
And some light novels (Though I'm not so much an LN guy)
I know there's a prequel and a sequel
I just got done with season 1 now
It got a lot better

Me with this franchise after Season 1

I might just consider stopping then, cuz I really don't like franchise bloat
I think the concepts kinda rad, and I love the Mobile Suits and animation style
Is AGE Bad? Ive only ever heard good things about it nowadays
But its just a very tired trope I feel
I mean, I kinda get it for older films
And then you can kinda use that to drive commentary on real world issues
I don't really like forbidden love stories unless their is like some kinda grounded in reality reason they can't
They invested so much money into that and it didn't take off like the hoped
I think this has something to do with AGE TBH
The artist deffo I'm pretty sure is tied  to KoF but yeah
My bad, a friend told me about this
One of the most cursed official Gundam images ever was drawn by the guy who made THE HARDEST image of all time
KoF artist drew that
