endless 8 is split in chrono and s2 is even better than s1 that way 
so watch chrono
||yes but Rebellion ending is negative because Homura does all this without Madoka's  agreement.  Madoka doesn't have free will in Homura's world as she forgot what happened and is being manipulated||
Madoka Rebellion: || Homura wants to be together with Madoka. She doesn't want Madoka to be away and fight for the world.  i agree that she thinks that her own love might be twisted but she doesn't think that she doesn't deserve happiness.  Her happiness is being together with Madoka in peace. that's what she was fighting for all this time in a maze to achieve||
this
interesting interpretation
But I personally loved everything

heartwarming and sweet
Madoka is a cute magical girl show
~lul~
more than that
release date still not announced afaik
wonder what route will the  new movie take
fair
lol wut
anyway nice discussion 
i understand what you mean or feel but i just feel differently
||just to make clear, i am not saying Homura deserved Madoka or Madoka's love, but she deserved to be together with Madoka and be happy with her. The fact is that Madoka wants the same - she wants to be together with everyone but she had no other choice to destroy all the witches in entire history
Homura is wrong to remove Madoka's free will in the end tho||
|| Homura did what Madoka did + brought her back. she just removed her free will.  which is why it is considered a bad ending.  if Homura just gives Madoka her free will then everyone will live happily ever after. 
Nobody is saying that what Homura did was right.   You are just completely disregarding Homura.
" If the only way for homura to be happy was to be with madoka, and madoka didn't want it, yeah, no, she shouldn't get to be happy." - the fact is that Madoka wants to be together with Homura and everyone else  but she had to sacrifice herself.   in Homura's world both can be happy if Homura just stops controlling Madoka.   Nobody is saying that Rebellion has a happy ending. i just said i prefer it more cuz at least Homura is happy in that world, while in TV ending neither of them were||
this is like 3 different viewpoints clashing moment lmao
|| so you are basically saying that Homura should not be happy ever even tho she suffered all this time to be together with Madoka  and Madoka should be a sacrifice for everyone else to be happy while she herself stops to exist in everyone's memory
which basically means that neither Homura and Madoka should be happy|| 
gg logic that is
|| she doesn't own Homura anything at all... except the fact that everyone is still alive thanks to her time travel and the fact that Madoka wouldn't be able to turn into powerful goddess if not for Homura's time travel being focused on her(hence Madoka gained all this power to become a god like being through her wish).  Sure Madoka might not feel the same way but fact still remains that Homura wanted Madoka to be happy but decided to remove her free will in Rebellion, while Madoka wanted Homura to be happy but didn't consider the fact that Homura would never be happy without her being by her side||
||it's cuz Madoka doesn't want Homura to be forgotten too||
i realized we have this channel - <#377148557796442134>
i personally loved Rebellion ending and thought it was better than TV 
so i wouldn't mind if it never continued
yes
ye good idea
||still different. Madoka had to sacrifice herself, cuz that was the most obvious and correct choice, while Homura keeps Madoka trapped in her world.  i do agree that they are both selfish selflessness and they both want good for each other but in those cases are different||
Fuck Deku
Kageki shoujo ep 4: ||stuff with stalker dude was wholesome and funny||
