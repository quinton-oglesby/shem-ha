on Ao3 I'm ApocalypticMagicalBarty
nope
I'm gonna read more of it at some point then definitely
I've really been enjoying My Sunshine btw, I haven't read it in a bit but its real good stuff!
Thank you!
ðŸ˜­
I love all of them so much
yeah I'm really deep into Sympho fandom now so I'm probably gonna stay
but its nice to be here~
I've been here before but I used to be kinda daunted by bigger servers so I left
Ello!
absolute arrogance
Fudou's whole "Songs can't save the world" thing
I mean that would explain why Murakumo didn't activate lol
~~also did you mean a harp~~
the attention to detail is ridiculous
damn
omg that was loud
more like we get a callback to s1 where Miku, Chris and Maria all kill Shem-ha and then die while delivering the finishing blow but while Hibiki, Tsubasa, Kirika, Shirabe and everyone else are mourning them they show up alive and well <:CarolSmug:617040484111745027>
Then everyone sings Apple and phonic gain is harnessed through Humanity as a terminal it summons the override program, then they all get Amalgam X-Drive forms and sing their final battle song...then Carol dissects the world with the Chateau to purge it of Shem-ha's influence
we get a Chris Amalgam and then Hibiki sings Kimi Dake ni to Miku, which gives her the courage to take back control of her body from Shem-ha
Shem-ha says songs can't touch her, so X-Drive and the Geahs battle songs don't work
this is perfect
oh ok I've got it
but you think it might be Apple instead?
I would still prefer that Hibiki sings Kimi Dake ni to get Miku back though
yeah that works
since it totally didn't when she was in her cocoon
like what if summoning X-Drive just won't work against her
its the thing that just came to mind but yes there's way more
lol
are the words from the Zesshou chants in unified language
though I am curious about one thing
absolutely
yessss
we'll never see her sing herself ~~just like Fine~~
she acts like she's above it
Shem-ha wouldn't use song
that's exactly what it is I think
~~so what's Airgetlam gonna do~~
I actually didn't even think about that
tbh
totally see that happen
I could
you know
but we haven't seen that in like 2 episodes *and* Fudou's no longer around to operate it
and then there's that direct feedback device
ehhhhh I'm not so sure about that? But I can't remember what Vanessa said the fragments of SSJ were being used for
concerning
which is
oh yeah
if they break it off of her they can probably get her back
basically the bracelet had Shem-ha trapped in it and Shem-ha went into her body from it
Miku's body has been cleansed of sin so divine power can easily manifest in her
she counts as one in my view though, either way
she has enough personality traits that meet the qualification for a yandere in spades but I don't like whittling characters down to archetypes
lool the yandere hate ~~Miku is also one y'know~~
~~and when have Sympho finales not been rushed~~
we already know almost everything anyway
tbh all they really have to do is explain everything in ep 1 and why Fine's back in the OP, there isn't really much else left beyond beating Shem-ha and having the final battle
who's hating on Enki's bishonen energy smh
Which is just Miku singing about how much she loves Hibiki in every universe and will never stop being by her side
It's meant to be a response to Eiai Promise
Kimi Dake ni is already basically a love confession
I'm not getting my hopes up
yeah
god I wish
oh if only we could get a kiss
~~what was wrong with what I said~~
I kinda doubt Noble Red will get a song
But I wouldn't mind being wrong
So I doubt it'll be a duet
Though the song is supposed to be a response to Eiai Promise
YESSSSSSS
As long as we get Kimi Dake ni too
Because I don't know where its gonna fit
Yeah they should but it'll probably be a Live or BD bonus tbh
<@430961740268699653>

Millaarc is Aimi (Kasumi from BanG Dream!), Elsa is Ichinose Kana
Ofc it depends on what people find attractive ~~but I have the best taste so it doesn't matter~~ <:TsubasaSmug:585839805737467920>
And I swear I'm not biased
Maria is objectively the most attractive
Oh God yeah...it's extremely plausible isn't it
Boys don't know about her beef stroganoff ~~Miku does tho~~
Bikkiebooty best booty
true
<:HibiMikuCry:586026583870013455>
Songs are supposed to make people happy
why think about sad things
<a:MichaNod:493803314593660958>
thicc thighs save lives
a person of culture
ahhhh
~~ok but my boobs will never get that big~~ <:elfsad:579522266010877953>
~~except with tits~~
Goals or just...me
I can't fucking tell what Maria is to me
yes
Tsubasa's as well
what makes the whole package so perfect
her clumsiness is like
~~unless that's not what you meant~~
<:ChrisAngry:336656958272700417>
I FORBID IT
MIKU IS NOT GOING TO DISAPPEAR
NO
Yeah...
Oh yeah neither do I
So will they remove the "hidden name of God" from existence that way
Yeah but...that's still a heroic sacrifice
I wish
This really doesn't feel like the penultimate episode
Fuck
Ohhhh
Wow
>the screenshot of Yggdrasil on the website literally shakes when you touch it
It's literally the title of the series lmao
tbh
I could totally see that
like
AXZ or XV Drive?
then maybe it would be
the divine power in a sense
if their final power-up is like
and like
they're wearing Azoth Gears now
actually
I mean the final Amalgam form will probably be like X-Drive but maybe they'll call it something different
even if it was just the fucking ED for ep 13 I'd die
I'd die
and recorded
is it too much to ask that we finally get that fucking animated
you guys know how in the manga X-Drive is summoned through Hibiki and Miku singing Backlit Flugel together
aaaaaah ugh
will say nothing until after 2pm don't worry
well that's about what I expected
fuckin
watching the livestream now
With Gungnir and Airgetlam clasping hands made from all of their Geahs
It'll probably be like Vitalization tbh
Like what elements exactly
I love GotG Vol 2 so much
OH FUCK YES
yeah but...
no honestly there is
oh ok
and now I'm like
like when I was watching the RAW livestream I wondered who the fuck these people were
from the Keywords
we knew that
Hoshi no Shihaisha Anunnaki (the theme from AXZ that played when Tiki became the Divine Weapon) played exactly when I expected/wanted it to during XV though, so that's good.
~~but ew I'm so sick of them~~
we might get Commie tomorrow though
Commie and YameteTomete probably won't be out for a few days
yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeep
the best
Chris Amalgam looked like a butterfly and that's exactly what I expected
I guess they kinda can't right now
but like
kinda disappointed all of humanity didn't sing it
eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeh
they're not
or something I haven't memorized the meme
don't you want to fuck shit up
don't you want to get nuts
they won't
>that moment when Crunchyroll translates Marduk (the god of Babylon who defeated the water goddess Tiamat with the divine wind weapon Imhullu) as Murdock

official subs not even once
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V856p0yjfEA
like Fine was
she's fucking above that
she won't sing
breathing in space is nothing when you have the universal solvent
they're all wearing Azoth Geahs
like I'm fuckin irritated that Maria saving the Earth literally awakened an evil god
in general I actually think my biggest problem with this season is the nods to other seasons just don't feel like anything but cool setpieces and contradicting what we always knew
It bothers me that Shirabe never tried to talk to Tsubasa while Tsubasa was in her funk because like... Shirabe's arc in AXZ was about learning FROM Tsubasa that closing yourself off from other people is a bad thing, so you'd think that like Shirabe would have had at least one moment where she tried to remind Tsubasa of that.
a fuckin bottom
also Kirika birthday backstory never
honestly I'm annoyed at that
their AXZ arc means nothing now
Shirabe should've talked to Tsubasa
~~I'm still worried about Maria though~~
I don't really know why you expect any of the main 8 to bite it
man when this show couldn't even be assed to kill any of its characters except the ones who never tried to atone for their sins without fucking dying in the process
and oh
just give us Kimi Dake ni
unlikely
if so big rip
did Elfnein actually get her memories burnt
oh wait
that makes sense
oh right she didn't actually disable the Curse before she started the process
is it just more efficient?
why did they use computers vs. like the human brains
they're not gonna sing that twice
nah
honestly I don't really wanna think about next week right now
but ugh
hhhhhhhh
seven scales
there's seven planets
maybe Miku will end up fighting when Shem-ha is purged from her
I mean if any event were to get animated it probably **would** be Mikugeah
I would
and that's the whole thing, Shem-ha tells Miku that she *wanted* the override to happen
he isn't now
but Fudou was controlling that advice
Omggg
I'm not really against that
So
It was basically established the Illuminati had the rest
Ehhhhh
Yeah I know
But oh well
While the top dog Annunaki was in her body
Was being activated and donned by Miku
It would totally fit if one of the **Imperial Regalia**
Ikr
I mean the explanation for why it did makes sense
Yeah...
Then again I thought her Faust Robe was going to be the Yata no Kagami (another Beast Mirror) but Kaneko doesn't play by my rules
Guess not
I thought Shem-ha was gonna be Anu but
~~though I don't really want to see her in this universe tbh~~
Nor even Inanna/Ishtar
I was surprised Enlil or Nanna didn't show up
Yeah Enki and Shem-Ha totally suffice
That would be interesting I guess
Someone needs to force her to
She can't give up
She won't give up
Shem-Ha is just like Fine
The gods are gone
They were only ever using their technology
That wasn't really gonna happen tbh
Yep...
Especially since they never talked out her trauma.
It's fairly easy to see why Miku would relapse
After the Divine Power incident
People have had the misconception that after GX Miku stopped worrying about Hibiki and while that may be true to an extent
Which Hibiki then responds to with the song
This is why I think Miku needs to say all of that while trying to purge Shem-Ha from her body
Hmmmmm I do agree but
Did you not read the lyrics to that song
Uhhhh but she's not though
Only through song do they express their love
Yeah but that's just it
She's only called her "her sunshine" and said she saved her
Hibiki has never told Miku her feelings outright
Honestly this is why I think all we really need is to hear Kimi Dake ni in the finale
I didn't know that at the time
Makes sense
Ohhhh ok yeah
I did
~~God I love her newfound confidence~~
I think Elfnein even points out their nature in episode 1
But pretty much yeah what Raiden said
I still have them
I saw some sheets leaked like after AXZ ended
It felt like XV used them but maybe my memory blows
When they were first leaked
I remember seeing the sheets for the Azoth Geahs
They have the universal solvent now
No but she perfected them
The Relic gets converted into energy and reconstructed
And then Ver made one
But XV Keywords saying that only Ryouko could make a Symphogear
~~which can't be proven either way~~
At least as far as IRL lore goes
Though like I said there's supposed to be 99 others
Yeah. But like the one that FIS had was missing huge chunks
it'll be Tokyo MX again
doubtful
I like s1 more but yeah I'd say they're both pretty tied
It's a saga
Yeah totally
Fine and Carol are both pretty high ranking but Adam is literally perfect (which is his fatal flaw)
Cinematic parallels, both kino (spoilers for Yuuki Yuuna wa Yuusha de Aru season 2)
Yeah I've been doing that.
I've learned on the go at least
I just really fucking hate people yelling at me about something when I wasn't properly toldabout protocol or how to do different procedures or whatever
So I know its not against me
And my boss is just annoyed at her superiors for placing me in her care with minimal training and all of the other administrative nightmares
Work is frustrated with me because the company is super understaffed so they rushed me through the background check/clearance as quickly as they could and I have had to learn a lot on the go
What's this in response to?
Forgive my ranting lol
~~Also by fuck the New York Department of Education and/or Employment has some incredibly stupid fucking laws...it's like they're trying to shelter the children from...being responsible with their own money???~~
Otherwise I'll end up not doing it or just doing it wrong. 

No verbal shortcuts or non-sequiturs allowed. 

Just tell me flat out what you do/don't want, use goddamn nouns and adjectives instead of prepositions. 

They exist for a reason. *shrug*
A very common problem that people on the autistic spectrum have is needing people to be incredibly clear, specific and concise when making requests/inquisitions about that person. 

If you want something from me you need to be transparent and succinct about it.
It's just the tone that's completely terrible and unpleasant and that makes me not want to listen to them at all. 

And then they tell me I need to just bark back??? 

Well ok I guess, just be more specific with telling me my responsibilities so you don't have to yell at me.
Work today was pretty alright but I'm honestly a little fed up at people barking at me about doing something wrong/not doing it the way THEY want me to do it when their instructions aren't specific enough. 

I know they're trying to make my life easier but God calm your tits.
Oh and I just bought a pair of slip resistant work shoes (my very first pair of "women's" shoes!) so I'm extra ready for tomorrow!
Work today went much better tbh. 

I transferred to a different school and the cooks are so much nicer, my supervisor is working alongside me, and the task list is shorter and even more straightforward. 

I don't foresee any problems popping up going forward.
I've only ever been attracted to one of them but yeah I have tons of guy friends they cool
no offense real men of this server you're cool
anime men are better than real men so valid
people are impatient
well
nice
I've heard complaints that Kimetsu doesn't have *enough* world-building but that was for early on I think
and then I didn't keep up at all
I remember how hyped I was for it
I need to watch Granbelm...
tbh I think the super robot genre has kinda outlived itself
well I'd consider that magic/Super Robot but
ahhh
00 has no magic?
yeah makes sense to me
like I think NewTypes make Gundams Super Robot but G is like the only Super Robot Gundam series
but then again I'm not really well versed enough in mecha to say that some things are or aren't Super Robot
I usually equate Super Robot with "it has magical powers" usually from the machine itself
or nah
didn't Macross Frontier and Delta go Super
heard its one of the weirder Kawamoris out there
I haven't seen that
~~Koyama~~
ofc it is
oh right
is Darling really super though
Gridman isn't mecha
aside from Star Driver I can't think of any other major supers in the past decade we still talk about
well I guess its just
Reals ~~with magical girls piloting them~~ still have potential though
Where Ange gets bitten on her inner thigh by the snake while she's on the island with Tusk
A very specific one
I thought I was supposed to be taking it seriously
Cross Ange legit pissed me off but like
~~but I know I'll eventually hate watch the latter~~
Or Cross Ange
I pretty much couldn't finish Elfen Lied
Adultery unless its framed in a very specific context (one character is falling in love with their friend but is in an abusive relationship they're trying to get out of) or Fate/zero
But I try everything before I judge it ~~at least I try to~~
Well there are still some things that are super off limits to me
Who knows when I'll get to it though
So stuff like Godannar yeah sure why the heck not
I like a lot of things
I'm not particularly picky with my anime tbh
Makes sense
Ah yeah
But I appreciate the effort more than anything
A lot of shows do
I watched Vandread I can't talk
I kinda like wanted to dismiss it because too horny but
I should watch Godannar
would Gunbuster also qualify?
definitely
yes
but Evangelions are just biomechanical humanoids with 12,000 plates of armor and a battery pack lol
~~Because they're not actually robots?~~
But Malthusian theory is pretty bullshit tbh
~~hints notwithstanding~~
I'm more annoyed at the movies for not including some of his backstory from the comics
ok Ver
Titan is completely different than Earth
and what, his own planet is proof?
he is basically testing a hypothesis
and an abusive father
then again I think Thanos is just a complete idiot
~~its not even funny with Thanos~~
~~although I'm really not that far into Berserk so idk what his actual worldview is~~
pretty much
when will Berserk end so I can read it haha
I still say "X did nothing wrong" but only when there's plausible deniability, with Griffith there's fucking none he's a monster and I hate him
yeah but its garbage
its not funny nor clever
like he literally || raped || Casca and sacrificed his entire squadron
I can't in good consciousness get behind that Griffith did nothing wrong meme
context
but you know
because otherwise I'd be dead set against it
its just that one part really makes me conflicted
oh no I actually love Zero
basically anything that romanticizes cheating is off limits to me
I was being vague
yeah
<@297542051057238017> I mean I rationalize it like, the whole thing with Irisviel made him frustrated and Maiya had feelings for him but I dunno, he probably could've had some restraint
lol
but I'm not one for cheap memes like that
framing is everything to me
~~even though he shouldn't have and they should just spend time giving Irisviel more screentime instead~~
eh because Kiritsugu had his reasons
I rarely get angry or offended at anime but
but it wasn't a lot of fun to watch tbh
I was a fool back then
Yeah that's valid
~~and this time I know I'm being baited~~
That's just enough to bring me back
And that scene in episode 11 where she and Sala sing together while fighting in their mechs
But idk man that seiyuu cast
Just absolutely obscene
But its such an unnecessary fucking moment and I was already hating the show for how it framed the Prison rape and deaths
But because I **knew** that's where it was being led to
Not because it happened
And then he gets himself down from the tree she tied him to and he licks the poison out
~~I've heard the movie is not though~~
Nadesico is gooooooooooood
oh fuckin man has it happened
its happened though
well I have a lot of interests so I just don't come across media that's absolutely less appealing than watching paint dry easily
FGO yabai
lol
though if getting rid of all of Fate means getting rid of everything that's not ~~what I consider main timeline~~ except Extra I'm fine with that
<:CarolSmug:617040484111745027>
~~I love Fate~~
probably not
offend me ok yeah sure fuck you, but at least you're getting *some* reaction out of me
tbh the worst something could do is bore me
I try to not be one of them
some people don't know the difference
yeah valid
I used to be pretty picky
I don't like to dislike things but
was that in ep 13?
or wait what was that other moment where they threw nukes back at the ships that fired them
~~her fuckin final attack against Ronan's squadron reminds me of Symphogear AXZ's opening tbh~~
I liked Captain Marvel though but yeah its pretty average
I don't even wanna see Far From Home after what Disney and Sony did
but I won't lie my interest is basically gone aside from Thor and Guardians 3
~~I still like most of them~~
ie Japan
any population that reaches maximum capacity tends to dwindle
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lpglAlSris

Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah such a good fuckin OP
oh wait I've seen two episodes of Nadesico
that was my second choice lol
ah yeah
or is that something else
also the Mazinger parody show they watch
lol
Oh yeah that's amazing
YOU GET TO BURNING
also the OP slaps hard
I liked the first episode a lot
rip
I haven't finished it
