Or that
Where is catgirl waifu then
Tfw accusations of using cat meat for Chinese food still exist
That's nothing compared to here in PH
Isn't majority of the world racist to Chinese
~~Symphogear~~
oh well looks like the age of chaos will begin
i guess we'll have to go through proxy wars and WW3 before someone discovers Symphogear
Unless it's the northern part
Isn't Ireland already independent
Inb4 Ukraine takes Rostov and Belgorod by year end
eventually Russian civilians will be at the mercy of pissed off Ukrainians because of what their military did in Bucha
Rostov, Sevastopol and Belgorod by Christmas
anyway
everyone thinks the Russians are the Nazis now
Nagarno Karabakh Pt 3?
unfortunately it's not a cocktail
There's already rumors of brewing in Moscow
inb4 get conquered by Ukraine memes
who happen to be along with the Normans the dominant DNA stock of modern British
even if King Arthur was real he came from the Roman Britons who fought the Anglo-Saxons
(the fanatics don't count)
Blaming Russian and Chinese civilians for the sins of their politicians
Russophobia and Sinophobia is the norm now unfortunately
I doubt Yoon is a Russian plant considering that guy is a staunch US ally and hates N. Korea
Inb4 they say it's the Philippines
Payback for what the Russkies did to them
They don't need to care about their GDP
They're motivated by their hate against the USSR/Russian government and to an extent, its people
I'm calling it
Ukraine superpower by 2023
And Russia is just in Armenia for its own interests
Prominent Armenian genocide denialists
Unfortunately Erdogan and Aliyev are neo Ottomans
Armenia has the disadvantage this time since they're allied with Russia and the Azeris are backed by Turkey and NATO who now want to rely on their gas
it was built primarily to intercept 1960s gen Soviet bombers attacking US CVGs
main reason why America doesn't use them anymore
wouldn't want any spare parts end up being used against them
was just memeing lmao
They're salty their stealth Sukhois ||got owned by Tom Cruise||
Crimea is just important because of Sevastopol
Finland reclaiming Karelia
Oh wait i forgot another more important one
<:GermainCool:736523122324275309>
Poland retaking Moscow
Oh wait i forgot
Depends on
- Ukraine taking over the Caucasus
- China gunning for Siberia
- Japan reclaiming the Kuriles
That's just same shit, new face
Looks like Ukraine is going to capture less POWs after this
for some reason i got people spamming the Black and Tans song or Little Armalite
apparently when she bought the farm there were reports of Dublin's pubs being lively
been seeing lot of pro-Ireland memes popping up
oh sorry if that offended you guys
meanwhile Irish be like:
Aka Sevastopol
Strongest naval port in the area
Allows access to the Black Sea
<:MariaChuckle:672465496515411984>
And there's memes of Moscow becoming Ukrainian territory
Meanwhile Russia: *loses latest iteration of T-90M intact to Ukrainian forces*
Mountbatten?
it's Payday time
i thought they got kicked out of Kherson already
~~and cheating on his wife~~
i thought he was more of getting drunk and arguing politics
World War III?
Just a weeb
Nope
~~inb4 they get weaponized~~
I only wait for the day people find out magical girls are real
~~so they're pro genocide~~
Now this is below the belt
Well i doubt those from the units involved in Bucha and Izyum might get any quarter
i thought it was Myanmar or Cambodia
Japan in 1931
The last time they kicked out a nation for imperialism it led to a world war
that could only happen under either the following conditions
- a coup
- Ukraine taking over Moscow
- NATO declaring Article 5 and leading to WW3
well Zelensky already declared he'd only open negotiations if Putin gets replaced
No civilians spared
Like Ukraine should go in and make a scorched earth of Russian towns as payback
I've seen more extreme opinions than that
Or you know they can just take Rostov, Sevastopol and Belgorod to hammer in the the point
Darwin unleashed all of these
In their words, dropping the Geneva doesn't matter since "certain race = subhuman"
Like i saw a guy who says that payback for whatever China does should include ||flooding their villages and no quarter for their people||
what i mean the KMT becoming a cuck is allowing their state emblem to be appropriated by the DPP for its own agenda
no both are cringe
MUN just looked like hypocrisy to me anyway
wdym KMT has been a cuck even after WW2
and alienating an entire population to the point they want to become independent rather than be the last vestige of a free non-communist nation
imagine losing to a bunch of reds with captured Japanese/Russian weapons even with American weapons
doesn't help the KMT is a cuck
same as Putin
some "lost national glory or avenging whatever these Westerners and Japanese did to China for a hundred years"
won't work for Xi Jinping and his party
i am now one with the bushido
i hereby embrace my western Japanese blood
Yayoi's were part of the so called Bac Viet though
not actually SGean
PH actually
this is why i would rather dump that part of my blood and identify as Singaporean in the future
iirc calling a Japanese Chinese is the biggest insult to them
Fujian province
though very distinct from the Mandarins
mostly just one region
thinks Unit 731 was a necessity
even calls the mainlanders bugmen
the guy i shared about wanting to flood CN rivers earlier? He was from TW
well i see some random TW netizens wanting to go full scorched earth on CN
according to many far righters, they don't apparently
well good luck convincing the mainlanders that letting Taiwan off their sphere won't cause another century of humiliation
or whatever CPC is forcefeeding them
Red Guards wiped out many ancient Chinese texts/artifacts
by that logic Italy should own most of Europe
Cultural Revolution wiped out all the pre-1949 history
but first Taiwan needs to claim a foothold on the mainland to contest Siberia
Eastern Finland
tbh politics can be tiring, i really don't care, let those boomers screw each other if they want to
soon they will
on second thought it is now Eastern Finland
https://tenor.com/view/eve-wakamiya-wakamiya-eve-bang-dream-bandori-anime-gif-16563943
South Mongolia
yeah true
but there's always the accusations of CPC manipulation
then the far righters claimed the USSR loyalists and the Russian ultranationalists were one and the same
i guess r/poland has a similar amount of bloodlust
Probably US will kick China/Russia out before that happens
Why haven't the others considered kicking Russia out yet
got his ruble payout
he trying to start WW3
Surprised they didn't go further and blow up the entire bridge
Inb4 inter Slavic civil war 2023
Ghost Recon Wildlands time
oh my mistake
Monty Oum must be screaming up there on how the company he built is now being run to the ground
Ironically they hate Russians
wtf
Philippines
If that news broke out here i swear people here would go full racist
Do they even do that to mainland Chinese
And then my country's military still worships them
the only thing i need to know is
will he keep the world at peace or will he fan another war
As for Kanye, he's a loon who thinks people still like his music and just because an anime based their protag of him
Yet the Turkish/Azeris/almost every ultranat Turkic want them wiped out from this planet
Kardashians are Armenians, who are being persecuted by Turkey
Oh wait i forgot Kardashian and him are divorced
Ironic his wife came from a persecuted race
Peak maidenless behavior
Looks like WW3 is on the horizon
Ok i see
No wonder Grimes got tired of him
Has he really been a douche even before
Deflect criticism by saying he's better than North Korean occupation
Cult?

Meanwhile watching Amber Heard and Elon drama on Twitter
H3H3 joins Payday gang again
So Elon is a confirmed Nazi now
That means he's not yet one, at least
But the way he's handling Twitter is still concerning
Now we wait for the HIMARS fest in Crimea
i meant the NATO/Ukraine side
or sending in PMCs
Who have they been funding
Hmm that's something i never really heard before
Time for the people cheering for WW3 to get their wish
what's next
they provoke Finland for the nth time again?
did they just imply Stalin was a Nazi
this is the 2nd time it was invoked
nope
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
Reminder Elon used to date Amber Heard
sounds more like a whiny manchild to me
"Boohoo Grimes and my children left me and Amber chooses to torment Johnny than loving me back so i'm taking everyone down with me"
^
let me guess, suspect used an AR-15 type again
"free speech"
He's using the rainbow flag
Ironic for Andy to be a far righter and trying to identify as a LGBT at the same time
oh sorry didn't know you were from the North
would you guys accept the Ulsters if they were to unite as one one day
there's always one thing i wanted to ask about Ireland
According to America at least
Socialism's reputation has been muddied by Bolshevik leaning parties so hard it's hard to separate the two
an absolute monarchy with communist ideology
then there's North Korea
Even some socialist groups deny them
Aren't they more totalitarian
Maoists aren't socialists iirc
isn't that what they say
doesn't matter whether Democrat or Republican
as long the enemies of democracy get subjugated or either wiped out
Can it reach Moscow
assert dominance over the Novgorod
exactly
time to do one better
They should just let Ukraine reestablish the Kyivan Rus and assimilate Russia
This is the culmination of Operation Paperclip
The folly of being dependent on Russia for gas
World War III is upon us
Is Jokowi being influenced by hardline Islamists
https://twitter.com/UAWeapons/status/1600133489294118914?t=zlh-hn7FL-t2uKOmcPGmcQ&s=09
supporters of restoring the pre-1918 German Empire
Reichsburgers
so there's a chance the AR-18s are coming back alive again
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
It's either that or people memeing his recent closeness with Xi being taken to mean he's emulating mainland China
Iirc Sukarno was seen as pro-USSR/PRoC
1965, iirc
Primarily supported by US/UK because Malaysia/SG was threatened by Konfrontasi
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
Probably hope America conducts a regime change op
Or just actual ultranationalists in disguise
Or "liberals" who actually preach xenophobic rhetoric
But yeah seems like America/NATO prefers right wing populists rather than someone who's pro-communist/China/Russia/Iran
Wasn't he tied with the Moonies or something
Serbia claimed to be the successor state from 1992 to 2006
Idk why my country still worships that fluke
And also Douglas Macarthur
Not to mention antagonizing the Taiwanese to the point they don't want to be the ROC
Then again nobody blames Chiang Kai Shek for losing to Mao even with superior American firepower
Get blamed for their governments/everyone else wants to commit genocide on them
Chinese are like the Jews of Asia
Only recently have populists being gravitating towards Russia/China
If you don't ally with one, you're auto considered siding with the other
Unfortunately the world order is bipolar
Knowing Elon he gonna speedrun that
it's Mandarin
But that Tencent QQ AI art generator is sus for me
Pixiv is already full of NovelAI generations
Oh well time to cope with the heavily inflated local currency needed to commission artists
lmao looks like i missed out on the discussion here due to time zone issues
never knew it was this bad
a few hours ago i only saw this in the Blue Archive servers
Ratio'd
Mastodon is the competition to Twitter?
American tories: hate drugs, LGBTs but their ranks are full of them, cartels and pedos
i don't know why but i thought the Battle of the Bulge when i read that
Sorry for your loss
and yeah ironically here in PH they worship the guy so much for the amphibious landing in Leyte that led to the liberation from the Japanese
despite him causing the loss of it in the first place by not preemptively bombing the IJN airbases in Formosa despite receiving early intel of the bombing of Pearl
like yeah he gave the CPC the perfect excuse to intervene in Korea by advancing all the way to the Yalu that resulted in the stalemate today
and yeah Japan's right still champions war crime denialism so that doesn't make them any better than the KMT or the CPC
in retrospect Macarthur is to blame for the plethora of problems facing East Asia nowadays
and yeah blame Douglas Macarthur for handing over Formosa to the KMT without consulting the people there
Western Allies: *allies with the USSR against Germany, Italy and Japan*
also Western Allies: communism is the biggest threat to freedom and democracy
then you have those who ||want to unleash hell on the Russian civilian population||
but everyone else seems like they want the war to happen lmao
yeah
that's why it was baffling for Churchill to ally with Stalin despite clear knowledge of those very facts
Like how in Europe people are now glorifying Hitler and in Asia, you got people in Japan and even Korea and Formosa glorifying their past empire, and including their war crimes
Axis revisionism is on the rise these days
Churchill: I HATE BOLSHEVIKS
Also Churchill: *allies with USSR*
ironic many alt-rights nowadays think the Austrian moustache guy would have been a better ally
because apparently they don't <:Ver:704169051391524875>
i wish those Twitter/4ch armchair generals had the wisdom to comprehend that
Then they try to gaslight in their defense by saying anyone opposed would prefer mass murder under communism
Inb4 regime change
so they want to reestablish the Russian Empire of old
they only started to be tank-heavy by 1942
and even then we all know how the Pzkpfw V/VI fared
Andrew Tate
meanwhile Miles Yu is becoming trending
but yeah point still stands given the fact Engels and Saratov, being two of Russia's primary long range bomber bases are supposed to be some of the most heavily defended in terms of AD
oh Tu-141s
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
i don't think it counts as good when even repurposed Tu-141s are even punching through towards Engels and Saratov
it's been Ukraine's greatest weapon against Russian armor
Baykar would need that as concrete proof for PR
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
Does it jam with too much powder
Classic politician
Only hypes certain positions to suit his agenda
the main point is whether this is going to cause major spikes or not
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
Wait for them to deflect criticism by heightening the threat of communist China
Florida man strikes again
you know what i'd agree with that
And also that
Or at least have proper tutelage if they are slightly below it
This is why i advocate people to be of legal age before they start handling/using a firearm
Being also on the extreme side of the spectrum
But yeah reminders fascism is also a horrible choice
The house of Snake's VA was robbed
https://twitter.com/DavidBHayter/status/1613332183913230336?t=cpUqiKN1XFEw6QYwnE9E4g&s=09
And also Douglas Macarthur for handing over Formosa to the ROC despite the objections of the Formosans
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
Meanwhile me making jokes about Chiang Kai Shek being an idiot for losing to the then scarcely armed PLA even with lend lease American firepower
Tfw i missed most of the discussion
Yet when other nations' law enforcement does the same it immediately gets flagged as human rights violations
MAGA people?
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
some people i know were still hoping they did get deployed so some random Ukrainian dude with a Strela 2 could make history by shooting one down
iirc i heard they're mostly limited to firing ultra long range cruise missiles from within Russian airspace
iirc the Su-57 was built to counter the F-22 and F-35, not the other way around
at this rate we'll reach the point even classified Su-57 documents might get leaked
though yeah the F-16 in War Thunder is the old 1970s non-retrofitted A variant, which still didn't have the AMRAAM
~~maybe spies playing the game would get intel boons for their respective national intel agencies<:Ver:704169051391524875> ~~
the Challenger is understandable
but they were silent on the Chinese ammo since that could be used to their advantage
i wonder if Northern Ireland would follow
no wonder he's been blocking criticism by declaring sending MBTs to Ukraine
Big L
and Ukraine has their own tank factory in the form of Malyshev/KhPZ
With Russian units wantonly committing war crimes RoE is off the table
And yeah that video from Ukraine MoD about probably strikes reaching Moscow
They worked well against Russia's main bomber bases
Or getting ATACMs to bomb Crimea
More like coping their "state of the art" weapons are being wrecked
Because i see tons of people in other servers who want Ukraine to conquer Moscow and do things to civvies
When will NATO directly intervene
Would Wales and Northern Ireland also leave?
but in a way this is revisionist in nature
well someone intentionally thought of making it
Oh wait never mind i was mistaken
Oh wait they're politicians
So i.e. Labour just dumped their own principles?
bruh
but idk releasing a public patent of your "most advanced" fighter within view of intelligence agents of the country you're currently at war with seems like a totally dumb idea
This time it's the SU-57
Hmm I'm hearing rumors of another WT forum leak
https://thebulletin.org/2023/01/press-release-doomsday-clock-set-at-90-seconds-to-midnight/#post-heading
they identified the one responsible in Monterey Bay
though by slurs i mean this would attract the crowd that's long bred on Sinophobia and every Chinese person = CCP
1000% would shit on them for endangering the rabbit
if you mean the animal right advocates and anti-CN slurs that's about to head their way, yeah
So it's not as stealthier than most comparable NATO aircraft
Meanwhile Ukraine getting big Ws by getting both Abrams and Leopard 2s
https://apnews.com/article/iran-government-business-drones-2ea4c51f7be1e377b95d1fccc1c963ad
She should probably rename herself to JK Voldemort or something
but still lmao
the J-8B has been phased out in the PLAAF in favor of the newer F model though
That doesn't look like a way to make criminals comply
Weren't they pro-Democrat
tbh i thought the concept of FPSs on mobile was dumb
it's way harder to play an FPS on mobile
there's nasheeds though
iirc it was because to anti-Chinese racism in Malaysia
Iirc isn't he one of the extreme right Bumiputera fundamentalists
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
Good luck for him and his fanatics to face the HIMARS of SG's army
His face screams maidenless energy
Meanwhile more American bases are coming here
add the fact most of them think the CPC = every ethnic Chinese on the planet
it's been cancelled
easiest thing to confer from this is
WW3 is a sure thing pretty soon
Actually every world power government
Tbf there are also warmongering idiots in China's government
i'd rather see weaponized magical girls as a better option
https://twitter.com/KyivIndependent/status/1623575847771815936?t=kaAFQs0xvSkpYCSpI6IC1A&s=09
but yeah
i think this guy had some severe trust issues
it's not like any doctor/nurse inside the MRI room would attempt to do something to him
the bigger question on my mind is why the heck would he bring his own gun into a MRI
neoliberalism is just conservatism under a new name
and he did a lot of horrible stuff before becoming PM
i think it dated back to Churchill
Why won't they just start the World War already
Vietnam lmao
Though for some reason many ignore that last part and just declare the entire Chinese genome has to cease to exist alongside the CPC
There's always that quote Deng said in 1974
```If one day China should change her colour and turn into a superpower, if she too should play the tyrant in the world, and everywhere subject others to her bullying, aggression and exploitation, the people of the world should identify her as social-imperialism, expose it, oppose it and work together with the Chinese people to overthrow it.```
Part of their status quo strategy though
Then again they've been also discriminatory against the Austronesian Taiwanese
It's the KMT who's still claiming that on the basis on inheriting the Manchu claims
PRoC only claims Inner Mongolian which some claim should reunify with Mongolia proper
Same with the islands bordering the mainland despite them constantly advocating to drop those claims as proof of turning the ROC into ROF
Iirc the DPP has stopped backing that claim ever since they came back to power in 2016
Many of his faction are also embroiled in corruption also
Or expel their diplomats
Then there's that incident recently where a PLAN Coast Guard ship lasered a Coast Guard cutter here and everyone is like sever ties with China
Even with Xi and his band of hawks running the CPC now?
More so if the replacement would happen to be more ultranationalist than the CPC
But yeah even if TW wishes to be left alone that would be impossible unless the regime changes in China
A small amount of uyoku-leaning TW also
Not only Westerners
Which gives propaganda fuel to the CPC
There are netizens who claim Taiwan should amplify what Japan did in the past
I must be looking on the wrong side of the internet then
Well TW has been lusting for CN blood for as long i can remember
Or they could just lend lease weapons to Taiwan and let those two unleash bloodshed
It already happened in Russia
Then label ethnic Chinese = CPC and then install someone who'll turn out to be worse than the communists
Surprised they haven't considered selling/donating it to prospective allies
Meanwhile me who lives in the Philippines: <:Ver:704169051391524875>
Rules for thee but not for me mentality
apart from either Syria, NoKor, Iran or even China
then again nobody really trusts Russia anymore
inb4 Ukraine will just laugh that off
well there's the history of regarding everything American-made as superior even if it turns out to be junk
very easy to convince politicians here like saying "you can repel those pesky CN/PLANCG cutters with these"
for one Philippines
Vietnam
Taiwan
