Don't know where to talk about this one, but it seems like Milgram's second set of trials are gonna start in a few months
MAL ratings are strange
Gonna rewatch Violet Evergarden so I can enjoy the movie more
Suppose I'll look out for that too if I ever have the time or desire to rewatch the show
Yeah, can't argue there
Same here. Definitely planning to continue reading once I have more time
Finished up 86's first volume. Shin had a lot more personality that what I expected to see after watching the anime. Makes me wanna go and compare other LNs with their anime adaptations
Will check back on it again after a while
Sounds about right
So that's where the anime is right now. Might reach one of my favourite points in the manga in a few weeks
Purgatory in the form of a train
Ryota Suzuki's pretty good, damn
