i dunno i think it has potential?
for classic books, new book series, non-symphogear related fanfics
straight from the general chat
its a "books/written content" channel suggestion
(sorry if that's a long introduction btw)
Hello everyone! Took me like 3 months to find the discord link on reddit, but here i am at last! Another sympho enjoyer!
Symphogear accomplished what i though an impossible task, dethroning my "#1 anime for six years" (Carnival Phantasm) as early as episode 10 of G, and i've just fallen more and more in love with the series ever since
My experiences with the community on twitter have also been fantastic
Long story short, very happy to be here
is the "Manic Pixie Dream Girl" trope in effect if both characters in the relationship are each other's "Manic Pixie Dream Girl"?
Now she has 2
Now she gains +1 braincells!
EVEN MORE YIKES
well, he used to consider Tsubasa a failure for most of the show, maybe he wanted to create a new successor?
BIG yikes, i know
What do you think happened?
First fanart i've seen where Shirabe is so pissed off


smoke*
It means your attack didnt do sht
Also, never trust a big cloud of smone after an attack
https://archiveofourown.org/works/6474229 here's the fic in question
hello guys, i found this really funny symphogear fic 
here's a snippet of it
shame Model A is already taken in megaman canon tho
Model AN (Ame no Habakiri)
really neat discoveries, also only discoveries
Biometal Model I(Chaival)
i hoped to find more stuff when i searched "Kirby Symphogear"
oh no! Kirby absorbed Chris!
Tomoe looks so cute here
https://twitter.com/N_niyu/status/1512642777963642880?t=Y8fhVwJNONzUU-m5JZizYA&s=19 the best Shirabe artist (imo) has published his/her e-books for anyone interested

in Master Duel
side note: they're also a very competent (and cheap to make) tier 3/rouge deck
here's all the dragon girls of the archetype
yooo dragonmaids lets gooo
goth burger-eating gf
Caenis now competes with Mordred for "best tomboy"
on that note 
i just finished olympus and i can't <:ElfneinPalm:672430572961923092>

not sure if this goes here or in live shitposting, maybe it applies to both
oh no :0
Can't wait to see fanarts of 
THE PUNCH
Once its animated
he'd solo the coffin from XV ep 1
base Ogawa was super OP

ooh she's adorable here
it would be hilarious

yoo, Tomoe!

idol zenbu
outburst zenbu
classic zenbu
its been so long
Niyu posted new Shirabe art for the aniversary!

"JUST HOLD HANDS ALREADY!"
"Hibiki, did you hear something?"

(should've written "dessly" as of "deathly" smh)
Samurai Kirika of the Dess Quickdraw faces her biggest challenge yet!


And i dislike most tsunderes on principle (emphasis on most)
In my case i think is bc Mythra is a tsundere i think
Great
normal-proportioned Raikou, nice, never seen such a thing b4

(series is Etrian Odyssey)
Female Hound has around 80 fanarts, Female Dragoon not a single one
why does this absolute unit has no fanarts
Or the AXZ concer- wait a minute...
Good ending: its the GX concert, and nothing bad happens there (only right after)
-So you're sure this... movies can make me a better politician?
-Positive
Fox wife (but wholesome this time)
i'll be back
but i have an exam tomorrow
i wish i could share + search okki content
bot is dying
i dont now what that would do, but it would be neat
Zenbu Zenbu no Mi
honestly i first thought of one piece
inmediately after i thought:
<@331908049822547978>
nice



and last one

finally got her after months of saving so shotout to the indian queen
Another thing that Gungnir users have in common: screaming their lungs out at crane machines
Kirbikki
its probably one of Mirai multiverse variants lol
like taken from a defeated enemy
seeems like a piece of a helmet
no but seriously, feral rage screams add so much to the cool factor if done properly
who is simping harder rn, you or me?
what's not to love?
semi feral screams during her attacks
Chad vibe
Big and muscly
Her three looks (armor and bodysuit specially)
The accesories
Heterocromia
My utmost appreciation for whoever designed Barghest, really

well all Crypters have drip
(yes that's his name. Well, his fake name)
Scandinavia Peperoncino!
and by extension, miss on:
but since the lostbelts havent been adapted yet you'd be missing those
wait the gacha has adapted a couple of arcs
from "eh" to "great" adaptations
including the gacha?
Carnival Phantasm best series btw
ah dont worry is not complicated actually
why? i love the franchise, flaws and all, i dunno
in spanish, if you give me 5-10 minutes i'll make an english version
i have a powerpoint for that
worry* (goddamit)
dont you forry
for when you do 
she appears in Fate Apocrypha as (possibly) the best secondary character along with her Master
in FGO Camelot 1 and 2 (1 is not that great of an adaptation but 2 is neat)
its cool, u get what i mean
less raw, but still good
in a different way tho?
or alternatively good?
even better then
which is raw af if true
gorgeous indeed
also the edges of his/her scarf look like arrows, that's dope

Gilgamesh Caster <:MikuBliss:336657233712513024>

A classic
It was only a matter of time

Is it meant to be armor?
I like his heavy arms
yeah, she was rocking that Alter style
but Shemha, you can't have drip

This is new Shirabe art
By NIYU https://twitter.com/N_niyu/status/1539529272297410560?t=zjQHZIhuiD57bNg5rknxPw&s=19
RIP the alarm clock
She looks fine <:ShirabeCheer:671887003414954005>
Heterochromia is such a pretty effect
by the time i thought "damn, she is rlly cool, maybe top 5 servants of the lostbelts character wise and development wise"
i was out of SQ
Caenis appreciation
-shoulder tackle!
-but Hibiki, your gear has no armor on your shoulder!
-Heiki, hecchara! I saw it in action movies!

Secretary Pyra
imagine an adult Kirika ðŸ‘€
then again, if Kirika is younger she has the potential to surpass Chris there
Kirika being smug bc she's younger yet taller
small piece for the CCC rerun
got prime trilogy for the wii, got stuck at one part, said "i'll do it later"

yep, i just never noticed due to perspective, while Shirabe wheels were taller
Well, Kirika is not a fan of cold if XV1 is any indication so she probably wouldn't go skiing or snow boarding?

i think the WOBBLEWOBBLE was due to some rings around the rails in that level

She was my first 10/10/10 servant funnily enough, and my SR ticket choice
I then failed to get her to NP2 the following year, even with 350 sq spent

Carnival Phantasm had been undefeated for like 6 years
that was the episode that made Symphogear jump from #11 to #1 on my fav anime list
that final "ZETAI NI!"
but i mean
Rainbow Flower also is fcking peak
even if i prefer how it sounds in the show
the creepy vibes of Miku song are 10/10
before moving on to Gx
i played the G songs SO MUCH
(one season per month bc not a fan of binging, would rather process the "cliffhangers" and think about what might happen)
and here we are
loved it
watched one season per month
i discovered it in november of 2020, thanks to the "random sakuga account"
my, you're quite new; welcome!

watched only one ep, loved it
but got Better Call Saul on my head rn so i'll wait a couple of days before watching the rest
havent watched those

Also Yuuki Aoi made a great job with her and her summer form
She's rlly funny
<:MikuPraise:585839808765493249>
Okita!
That depends on the country
(in general, i dont know if in this server)
Lots of people are scared of clowns
Like clowns i guess
In case there is sth specific that could scare/disturb people
In sfw and nsfw, spoiler is often used for "content warnings"
In case sb on the server has insectophobia or sth like that?
CW: Insect (?)

https://twitter.com/mutukiriichi/status/1618203846324670464
then in the anime Lusamine is a cinnamon roll that makes her children cringe or sth like that and its great
i didnt simp for Lusamine until like five years later when i entered this server and some ppl convinced me
(havent played USM yet but heard about the story changes. On one hand, cool having a legendary as the villain, on the other, F for Lusamine)
only wish we could've fought it; i mean in BW2 we could fight not-pokemon on the cinema
between the scary faces, both battle themes, her story and the crazy fusion she pulls
Lusamine was insanely cool in SM

Sprights look genuinely cool
Kashiii <:HibikiGay:670494484701773845>
(its Lightning. that Aizen-esque mf is the real villain)
so who's the real villain?
still
he never got to see Topologina Nabee
oh, right, that
what did my boy do to you?
thats not fair
so i heard AI art is not allowed on this server
are there any TsubaOgawa fics by any chance?
maybe?
i mean alchemy is all about body modification so there's no need for training?

counting the incoming new one, whoever that is, that makes six presidents in the span of five years
aight, my country no longer has a president again
personally i think its too big, you can make threads
the curfew didnt even get to happen since the by-then president didnt have the support of the army and other sectors
unlike the other congress disolution we got 30 years ago
and now the situation should stabilize, the price of the dollar has already lowered a bit
also we got our first female president ever, so thats neat
ah, hello Matt
thankfully it seemed to resolve on the same day
"how about we buy pizza to the employees? Surely that would be worth it"

#1 best gastronomy in the world btw
Third-world country in southamerica
Peru
aaaand 30-days state of emergency apparently
honestly a story i'm writing
also dont rlly know a "medic forum/reddit" or sb who works on that area
aight, thx for the info
And give you a transfussion of the wrong blood type?
What happens if the medics get it wrong
So, since its meds related and blood related gonna ask here:
Feeling better
Thanks a lot everyone
yep, feels like its gonna like take the rest of my life, more as time goes on
how do you... handle it?
+ if i screw sth up i could get fired
and even then the course i'm taking is lowkey taxing on its project
and there are more hard courses in the near future + the thesis
like i kinda feel this is my last weekend where i'll be "free"
even if it is "preprofessional practices" which is less charge
specially doing work + studies as is expected of late university
ok so, not sure if the following qualifies as heavy
but i'm scared of finally starting to work
maybe is paranoia
as if, if i have to go through a dangerous area of the city in a bus or similar, i'm more wary of men than of women, always try to sneak at the pockets in case sth is shaped like a gun instead of a cellphone
so, is it technically sexist if i assume that most thiefs are male? Like in third world countries at least
for as long as i remember, whenever successful or failed assault attempts (on the streets, on banks, on small grocery stores) were reported on the news the burglars were always men
dayum
the top8 is OU
he's in the Ubers tier lololol}
noticed bc i was invited to a party rank of naruto ops-eds
and there were lik 7 endings with beachs
but like i mean
people run in openings all the time
but beaches seem to be ending-only territory
"animate what you know for ending sequences" is a more specific application of that i guess
well "write what you know" is a popular saying
forgot to type the thanks, my bad
thanks
it makes a lot of sense now
why do so many endings feature people running/walking on a beach?
and now that i'm sorta free from exams i can explore the server a bit more
due to time i've mostly interacted in one *other channel* with you folks
man i love discussing/talking about stuff
didnt know about that one
huh, neat
the sleepy dude with the cat?
or who i feel shine the most in ygo
there are some VAs who have only worked in yugioh i think
and as Hans and Ozymandias in Fate
honestly now i remember him for his role in SRW
still like him
but i can see how it's "not the same" anymore
true, he might be more memetic than imposing nowadays
the man goes WILD
get ready for when Zane Truesdale / Kaiser Ryo makes its duel debut
speaking of top tier VAs
so it kinda STOPS TIME for them
but the effect of the card skips the opponents turn
not exactly his ace monster
and ||Dio VA playing a card with THE WORLD on its name||
i mean season2 has the unintentional humor of "This place is reserved for whites"
yep, apparently the author of the DM manga didnt like how season 2 went and returned to work on GX in s3
be careful when playing card games people
ygo do be wild like that
btw on which part of GX are you?
also Yuma might grow on you, speaking from experience
voices and ost are much better in the jap dub
-sir that applies to half of dubs
-well its more noticeable in zexal
Zexal dub does not help it
and just spread those negative words all over the internet
like most people generalize it just like pokemon in "only the first season/the first generation was good" and never bother to give it a shot
especially bc of how its "mistreated" in the anime community
i dunno a have a HUGE soft spot for ygo
while having lots of charm in the execution
GX and Zexal both start with mostly episodic stuff
i've noticed subtle things to correct or reshaped tropes bc of comical (or not) reviews
honestly vids like these help me a lot in improving my writing on worldbuilding
like i honestly started watching Rakudai bc of this video
(as of speaking negatively of a show but with very good arguments)
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7NGHyQWbK5k
and negative wise:
in my case, positive wise: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIiX4TL2_vg
that channel is dope
or "wow this was even worse than i realised"
like those vids that made you realize "this show i loved was actually even better"
so, which is your favorite anime analysis video?
people assume, not just in anime, that more blood and deaths = more mature
read reprints and my first thought was "Air Neos" lol
look, cant really say since i didnt watch the show directly
but the vid makes some valid points
its how i learned to be more attentive of the director/producer than the studio
aw yeah, A1 is another can of semipolemic worms
thankfully the vid above has a segment on the studio and its practices
same, SAO Progressive is the author making great use of the og material
didnt SAO have the "fanservice in R-word scenes" issue? like 3 times?
before Goblin Slayer?
though maybe thats too polemic to discuss
thanks
instantly booked to favorites for when i'm done with this university semester
not the rescueable points
problem is, the isekais that came en masse after its popularity only copied the bad stuff
it had some sorta good things even
but some points still hold up hard
and a couple are justifiable in "by the time the novel was written, MMOs were still hypothethical and the numbers issue can be skimmed over"
yeah, some arguments get kinda on the nose
ALSO the "Mother Basement" vids about SAO
and... what the HFIL?
but i just discovered Ghost Stories
i thought the yugioh dubs since gx in general were the ones who strayed the most from its source material
Went to the main anime commercial center of my city (of my country, even) and no Symphogear merch either
damn, didnt know this anime rivalry went on for that long

why tho
huh... never thought about it like that
This joke is like 3 or 4 years old already but i love it
does anyone know when the pokemon anime comes back from hiatus?
weird that Tokyo Revengers keeps introducing new characters but i think this dude has potential
does anyone know when the pokemon anime is returning from hiatus?
almost spanish Adventure Time or spanish Kids Next Door level
one of the best dubs we've had in years
also, the spanish dub of Kaguya-sama is a 10/10
they put a lot of heart into the adaptation with the comedy bits
i mean, it cant be worse than american remakes
where can the new pokemon ep be seen?
Wow, i didnt see that coming
Or is the issue sth else?
I dont know what Teppen is
But with "Fire Force but worse" i'm gonna assume the issue is fanservice?
great, even more fundamented arguments against this
or i write some of my fics / some parts of my big crossover project in english rather than spanish
it has come to the point where sometimes when i talk alone i do so in english
sometimes with english subs or without subs
well i consume a lot of english concept
oh, thank you
<:ChrisWave:738169593574719568>
neat
yep, spanish is my main language, i'm from Peru
and sorry if i seemed rude here
aaaaaaahh it makes sense now, thank you
it starts in 35:45 hours?
ah wait i thought it was a mystpe but now i0m confused
ah yes, 55 o clock my favorite hour of the day
also on the spanish side of anitube, "Me Dicen Dai" is really funny
and Mother Basement is hit or miss but i feel like mostly hits
Explanation Point does GREAT content

years later, we did get Orion by itself as a servant, however:
(for example: Ishtar and Ereshkigal both using Rin body, Sitonai using Ilya's body)
Basically is Artemis with the "power level" of Orion
notable since every single other god/goddess servant has been a pseudoservant: it requires a human as a host
basically, since Artemis is in love with Orion, she "snuck up" during his summoning and took most of his  power, leaving Orion so weak that he takes the form of a small bear
If you have any more Fate questions feel free to ask me <:ChrisWave:738169593574719568>
Oops i was asleep
Well you got your answer anyways <:MikuPraise:585839808765493249>
"Chisato chikita"
(also Ogawa voices Jason apparently, good to know)
shared VA's
we should all do it together in the voice channel
*Hashire sori yo intensifies*
<:ChrisHappy:660870796696223744>
its coming

so, 24th huh?
Apollo really giving everyone the gift of prophecy
First the simspons, now ProZD
<:GermainCool:736523122324275309>
Contrary to popular belief, this wolundt be the first time female-furniture relationships have been shown on anime
So the new Makoto Shinkai movie features a love story between a girl and a chair (well, a boy trapped in a chair)
wait, KH is getting a show?
nah, just wanted to make that joke
Muzan doesn't convince me as a villain
i mean, "Demon King"? He is, at most...
a *smooth criminal*
then they both explode
Both: "NANI!"
Kenshiro: "Omae wa mo shindeiru"
Joseph: "Your next line is 'Omae wa mo shindeiru'"
Kenshiro manages to touch him
Joseph fights Kenshiro
so, classic Jojo/Fist of the Northstar joke, for no apparent reason:
Ressurrection is from the movies continuity
so it technically does not diminish R2's ending
R2 also happens to fall in the group of "shows whose supposed number of episodes was suddenly cut in half so they had to rush some parts"
yeah big pros and big cons
still love it tho
i mean some people might argue than the Code Geass movies solely bc there's no table scene
<:ChrisHappy:660870796696223744>
first arc can feel kinda slow, but i promise every single thing has payoff here
also feel free to DM me bc again, i adore this piece of art
so if i managed to pique your interest here is a link: https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/lulus-bizarre-rebellion-code-geass.270163/
could talk about it for hours but obviously that wouldn't be good manners in a public server
absolute 10/10, 20/10 even
there's the "if you have a geass and get a stand you get instakilled by the universe, except under very specific conditions like trapping your own mind in a paradox or sth in which case both evolve into a Requiem"
just to mention one thing
so she can channel Hamon through it!
C.C. gets to pilot a customized mech that has scarab fabric underneath its control interface and cables
the way the author connects the lore of each universe
the faction interactions, the fights
the Geass - Stand - Knightmare interactions
but OH BOY, i cannot understate how much of a masterpiece it is
now you might be thinking
*by artstyle alone they dont fit together!*
an outlandish crossover of Code Geass and Jojo's Bizarre Adventure
**Lulu's Bizarre Rebellion**
(on the internet, not mine, gotta clarify lol)
may i present you, good story enthusiasts
so, after seven years of publishment, my fav crossover fic of all time is complete!
lol, might finally watch one or two eps now that i'm exam free
this is the segway I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR
on that note, since i managed to mention CG here
i love faction mismashs
hell, the initial ||Kallen, Lloyd and Sayoko|| teamup was interesting
and i dunno, i love the cast
Resurrection has its flaws but it also gave me more Lloyd which is always appreciated
<:GermainCool:736523122324275309>
Literally goat anime
-he tanks even a full power punch with 1 HP
-uses Counter which uses twice the power
-gg ez?
can a Wobufett with Focus Sash solo Saitama?
Even temporary members like Lapras, Larvitar and Ambipom showed up
When Pikachu gets to see all the previous teams i felt something in my heart
but memes aside, my boy finally made it
unless Tobias shows up with Arceus lol
but after Better Call Saul, i have more faith in prequels/sequels
gotta say, not that convinced
ironically, Yuya probably does far more physical activity, seeing how Action Duels are
i hope you all enjoy it as much as i did
which is a lot
an example of the comedic strength this work boasts:
+Sasuke manages to be incredibly likeable
+hits "the stations of canon" in a way while simultaneously making some world-changing shifts through its run
+great character moments all around (for both epic and comedic effects)
+battles are splendid
to all the beautiful amazing people of the server, i present to you: the best Naruto/One Piece crossover fic https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11698245/1/Tales-From-The-Blue-Sea
now recommending a combination that has most definitely been tried out a lot before
sup, its me, the guy who recommended a Code Geass x Jojo fic once

after the whole batches situation some people werent that confident
and its glorious
Well i was slightly afraid it wouldn't happen because of the whole Netflix meddling
but Jojo Stone Ocean does have a special version of its final opening
again
the ship wars
... oh no
an experienced mentor-like figure
i feel his role will be like part 4 Jotaro, or maybe the "role" Yugi had in GX
But at least he showed up in two recent flashbacks/reminiscences
I mean the "i'll be back for you after i win the league" was a 4kids invented dialogue
9/10
It was a wonderful experience
Even with being spoiled of its ending a couple of years before the adaptation started airing
So i finally finished Jojo part 6

i was calling it PAPIRI for months!
wait its PARIPI Koumie?
but again thx for the concern
ah i meant emotionally, not physically lol
aslo, toldya: beautiful group <:MikuPraise:585839808765493249>
maybe/most likely next year
all things considered, it'll probably put it on "Plan to watch when i get better", because to keep with your metaphor the other "edge" of the "double edged sword"  is very compelling to me
still, i appreciate your concern over my own concern <:ChrisWave:738169593574719568>
like, i'm very empathic/sentimental over these things?
nah, its more on how some frames/dialogues i saw hit like too close to home
if that makes sense
the 'relatable' part of Bocchi kinda scares me away from watching it
so which first?
aight i'm gonna put my trust in this beautiful group
have yet to start Lycoris or Gundam G Witch (havent watched anything from this year besides one show, actually)
music was also nice
like shot composition and that
i personally rlly like the direction
we proyected each op (the first time, not per each round), then gave everyone 30 seconds to vote with emotes
then we trimmed it down from 67 to 64
yeah, a friend of mine competed in one of those twitter tournaments where everyone gives each op a score
so he gave me the excel file with the links
it may happen eventually, SxF is still very popular
also if the spoilers are subtle (Jojo ops) vs obvious (Fairy Tail ops)
(though opposite tones to the show like Watamote and Death Parade work too)
also the tone of the series or of the respective arc
but for me an opening is the whole package
songs, visuals, selling you the show
also, dunno how the others were voting
yeah, at first i was like "where is the chorus starting?" but then it grew on me
side note: draws decided by RNG were:
-Bocchi vs Kaguya
-Spy Family 1 vs Shingeki
-CSM vs Ousama Ranking
also we used the first version of the Jojo op, not the "power of the villain" version
interesting, i'd go with Love Live Nijigasaki or Pokemon (last one due to nostalgia admiteddly)
yeah its ops
if it had been the first op of spy family, would've voted for lyco instead
if it helps it was close, 5/6 when the timer ran out
(not screaming it, the show is called Teppen!! exclamation marks at all)
or another show
Comic Girls is, Teppen!!!?
she was the surprise of the tournament
ironically, Bocchi won its 2nd round (vs Kaguya opening) by a roulette as the votes were tied
but Bocchi still won by 0.02 decimals
no clue, according to the chat he wanted it to lose
made sure that most popular openings didnt clash that early
(Chris did not appear in any 2022 anime but i put it there anyways <:MikuGay:336656810788388864> )
https://bracketfights.com/create/torneo-openings-2022-12215/ if any of you want to give it a shot, here it is
and the final by notes of the participants
hello folks, made a bracket fight of openings of 2022 for an event of my anime university group
over 20 people voted, there were three encounters decided by roulette
<:ElfneinBullying:421432763078410241>
My b, i just received a 67 list and trimmed it to 64
First op debuted in october of 2021 and thus could not competr
The second one
(oh right,  CSM vs Ousama Ranking was also a tie and decided by roulette
i liked it but did not expect it to steamroll
ok this was great
have yet to see the visuals but the song alone is *legit*

the company executives atop it all, i mean
so honestly wouldnt surprise me coming from them
Disney already did with Treasure Planet
and they like cut TOH a season short due to ~~maybe homophobic~~ reasons
as of, "intentional" fuckup?
fuckup or intentional?
or not be spoiled?
just let people be surprised at the unlockable characters?
but personally i think leakers are rlly mean
not sure if it could be called a "leaking culture" like people say "cancel culture" these days
in this day and age, not surprised lol
also a part of me wants context of this lol
*comedy gold*
thats what watching "MHA Two Heroes" in spanish is like
ah also on spanish dubs
imagine Bakugo calling Todoroki "stop it, you Zuko clone!" on the big screen
and well, not a nice experience
i read some arcs bc a pal insisted "i cant judge solely on the premise/genre/bc it has fanservice"
so i said "aight bet"
But i was genuinely impressef watching some random clips in a compilation yesterday
I even love to hate it, as toxic as that may sound
Oh absolutely
Same with the spanish dub of some Jojo parts
From what i've heard, after the dub of the MHA movies was great
The dub of the show itself which came later was sorta dissapointing
Could be
Then again i emphasized comedy shows for a reason
And fcking *Rent a Girlfriend* goes from "100% unwatchable" to "it could actually make you laugh/have an ok time"
Kaguya-sama is somehow even better with spanish dub
Amazed at the quality of anime latam spanish dubs recently
For comedy shows, more specifically
Dont want to sound too polemic but also there are few ways to like voice a question on my head
So just to be sure
Is the word "overrated" banned on this channel or server?
Lelouch is implied to still be afraid of Schneizel
still find it hilarious that even in CodeMENT where at most one character is sane
if Paul was meant to represent competitive players,
Tobias was the representation of all of us kids who used the cheats option of our R4 to get x999 Rarecandies and Masterballs, and/or "hold L while walking to get a certain pokemon"
so very weird
but at the same time they made it so only Darkrai could use the move iirc
and was mostly changed due to Smeargle
his entire team was:
-Darkrai
-Latios
-Omnimon
-Exodia
-Landorus T with Life Orb
-an Alien X from Ben 10
for the memes
or sth crazy like that
this mf better show up in the last pokemon season with Arceus by his side
same! this and its remixes
(also it sorta gives me an excuse to post the song)
I'd go for Shirabe or Kirika making a cover of this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdq3_nf6p8&ab_channel=hunterdynamo
Think it belongs to the music channel so here it goes:
If you could get one of the gears to make a cover of an already existing song, which song and by which gear?
but they did
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVlgUimECoQ the yugioh DS games didnt need to go THIS HARD
this fcking *SLAPS*
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIJ3bQKN5R0&ab_channel=GoldenTurnip aight my b for never giving the Fairy Tail ost a check besides its main theme
ooh i had never considered a spooky soundtrack for Halloween
first thing that comes to mind: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-x4ttQioNw&ab_channel=SekutIViuley
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HMQQLodFY0&ab_channel=NoireSama thanks HonakoGreen for using banger OSTs in your budget setups
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvCsTca0uBc&ab_channel=Exrage this one is very catchy
or almost never, wasn't rlly convinced by Kalos music
at least the Pokemon OST is never a miss
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BXwbIkr6QU&ab_channel=Bliitzit this goes HARD
so here's Maya Fey theme
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EI4ArfPAJKs&ab_channel=169Tom my love for the AA franchise is back in full force after having been disconnected for a while
so i'll add "download a DS emulator for PC for this one game" to the eventual list
i think there was a translation patch, but my R4 can't run patches, it crashes
oh, right
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDuVT3wiFI8&ab_channel=OfficialVGM holy shit how did i forget this song existed?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BM5E7BGvMIA&ab_channel=RobertShapiro arcV soundtrack just does not miss
*chef's kiss*
OSTs from one game in the soundfont of another are just https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vs0NJ-3uNHE&t=49s&ab_channel=blivveries
just thought of a great 4v4 team sparring exercise
you know that feeling when you imagine a whole fight in your head with the right music?
maaan the nostalgia keeps flowing
(i was a kid ok? <:HibikiTsun:738234664656961556> )
i remember being fascinated with it as a kid
i even had a story in my head which was literally Spirit Tracks but with pokemon and warcraft mixed in
this merits a replay as soon as i get vacation
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5W_bFLwB0WY&ab_channel= Spirit Tracks rlly is my happy place
got a sudden wave of nostalgia today 
decided to pick a specific ost while i do my assignments
and, well
