hey, fellow Shinza enjoyer <:HibikiHi:336657249827028993>
applied for an online workshop
starting my amateur career as a furry writer
I'm starting a raid anyway, details soon
<@!114081181611458563> I don't see you when I refresh, I was just checking out of curiosity
I'm close to maxing Ignite Bikky's materials, I hope it won't take long with invites
I will probs do those C Power raids and tell people here about every single I start
once I unlock Bikky
XD Bikky should be good for those Carol Power Raids?
I won't push my luck, go get it people.

yes, level 60 Ignite Hibiki, let me screenshot
I mean, me
Kat
since I don't have high level Dexes
those guards are a pain
I too
<@!127991170201681920> I have Dex Carol raid opened up that Fifty Five joined too.
I opened last Dex Raid for today
I will keep Miku as second leader for  abit, but add back XD Bikky soon enough..
<@!76843888991535104> alright, freed up a slot.
I will remove a friend who quit the game
oh,
thanks
yeah
sure, I added you to help with that raid
I will open a third Dex Carol raid, then chim in for Five's if you open another.
<@!76843888991535104> your raid is done
ay, thanks
I challenged dex carol and someone clearly busted killed her in one attempt.
and yeah
I haven't tried her yet, but dex power is brutal for me even with that power team of mine unless Autoscorerrs are already out.
I dont bother with Dexes for the Dex Carol raids because my Dex team is the weakest part of my rooster.
do I need anytthing else than Intelligence for that raid
I will post the raids anyway
thanks for tip.
ah, Power Carol?
I feel the same about the prospect of grinding Intelligence Raid. My Body team is average at best, so I will post raids tomorrow in hopes of getting a help.
alright, 5 AP. Let's go.
alright, if you don't have luck this time, I plan to stay late today, so just let us know when you open another Raid.
how much?
yup, that's where I farm mine
honestly this Raid is my favorite one for a certain item, so I'm happy to help grind
alright, I will check in 30 minutes
537698430 for anyone interested
I will add you
ah, friends and followers?
<@!76843888991535104> trying to find it by refreshing, but it's not around for me.
I will get to 5 AP in 30 minutes

I have 60 lvl Kanade, 60 lvl XD Bikky and 60 lvl Shirabe for that type of Raid.
I have a decent team for that, so when AP regenerates and it's still around, I will lend a hand.
I will be opening a second
lol, someone one hit killed it before my AP regened to 5
alright, open
besides, I'm focusing on finishing the medal harvest, so I won't using refills
I may as well give back a bit cause I killstole my supply of crystals today
once I finish round 1, I will send invites to everyone
opening a hard miracle raid too, I will stock up a bit of miracle crystals just in case I max someone who needs them.

I have mats for my Giga Zeppelin Chris already, so if I get her again, it's 70 time.
but I will open them just in case for folks
I got everything I need from Carol Dex raid
anyway, I will focus this time on Power raids

in few hours I will be able to start open those raids again
opening the last Power Carol raid for "today"
it's Chris (because she's all from non-bought stones and free tickets, nearly maxed a T type and halfway maxed Ignite) > Hibiki (I managed to get Comet and Ignite to 56 with free rolls, bought stones for Ignite Festival, bought stones for XD) > Maria (decently limit broken Ignite and a single of Power five star >>>>>>>>> Kirika and Shirabe and Tsubasa
If I had to rate my luck for five stars
I just don't get their dupes to limit break, it's always a new card
just please no five star Kirika, Shirabe or Tsubasa when I roll a five star
one copy of Technique Chris and I will have a third maxed five star
both are decently limit broken, but I won't specifically fish for them since I have five stars that arre closer to maxing.
maybe I should buy Ignite Marie or Ignite Dex Chris next time Ignite festival hits
if I didn't save gold, I'd splurge and LU my 60 and 40 Body types, that's the only way for me to improve my Body team.
I will probs attempt again, as little as I can help
if I keep up my current rate of progress, I feel like I will have both five stars LU'd in few days at most.
üëç
<@!114081181611458563> it probably means I sent to everyone unless the message doesn't change depending whether it's everyone or friend only

or change in a middle
I swear I sent it to everyone, is there a way to check
maybe someone poached it already, need to check results
and I can't currently check I'm in a quest
I sent invites to everyone
now I just need money for XD one
I also poached a Power Carol raid in spare time and got those Int Mats I gunned for
it's open

didn't get Intelligence Crystals though of that raid, lol
and I will max Ignite Bikky too
I just need 4 Giga Magical Crystals
alright, opening another soon
I always get a Giga [insert something] when I just left a thing open before I go to bed.
that's honestly the best farming method in my experience
*gets Giga Magical Crystal from that raid that I opened before I went to bed*
*wakes up*
it's on
I will send invites once I get my ass kicked
started Power Carol Raid
she has impressive defense to me, but her attack makes me weep
for a Hexa Quest
but I only unlocked once a four star Kirika
yeah, I got a lot from the raid you helped to clear
I probably sit on heaps of Dex materials
probably dailies got you enough
for Bikky
but the point of this raid is to grab some Intelligence mats, lol
I'd LU Kanade and Shirabe
god, CC is getting me drained, i want to play some Star Sector with peace of mind, but I need... just... 30 medals...
I will take some time off tomorrow and take it easier
Power and Intelligence units are my best units, so once Scorers are out of picture, I do considerably better.
where i got Giga Miracle Crystal when I opened the game when I got some sleep
I did that with Miracle raid once
at worst I will gun for Contrib reward and maybe have luck
throwing in 60 level Body Hibiki, the rest are fodders
I have Shirabe, Kanade and XD Bikky at 60
I might set up Power Carol raid before sleep
alright, so
no luck for me this time, but I guess if I flow in too much cash, I will 70 that Dex Kirika
thanks
well, I spend 200 $ so far
well, it's progressing nicely, someone bonked it for 68K
if the first two players do more attempts, it will be probs killed quite soon
this one is promising to poach
I'd just do I Hard raid
I wish my Body team wasn't shit
some opportunic raid with 10K HP left I bonked with 3 AP
also the last raid gave me Giga Magic crystals once again
it's like 3 AM here lol
not sure if I will be able to help before I go to sleep
well, I found a raid whose owner dealt 110K on first attempt before I learned about that D Carol and P Carol.
<@!263392442345193472> so yeah, if you don't get mats you want, I'm around to open those Dexes just in case.
if Ruby runs out of Dex Carol attempts, I will put my Ignite to a test gladly and open more Dex Carols.
at least I avoided the curse of not dropping smaller Magic Crystals
got what I needed for Ignite
I did a Normal Carol
yeah, no point right now
I have uber shit team for Intelligence non-Carol raids, so I try my luck with Carol.
*drop
do they trop Giga Int Crystals though
I'm honestly cursed
apage, Giga Magic Crystals
noo... <:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
<@!125111495523565568> maybe post info that you open a raid here, probably more chance people will help
thanks
since it's the last raid of that type I could open, I'm not in particular rush about people assisting as fast as possible, but I will welcome even tiniest contribution tbh.
I started grinding it more to get the contribution award in worst case scenario and because I have AP
well, that raid is still open
I guess I will try to finish off Micha for Degurechaf's raid
so that's not worry
I have mats for five stars I'm closest to max limit break
I plan to unlock some Int four stars, maybe
those also drop Int mats, and I will deplete most of my Mega Int Crystals when I unlock XD Bikky
that's a thought, but I figured I'd stock up mats a bit, I didn't have all Giga Magic Crystals when I started my round of Hard P Carold raids too.
I have like 6 in total to grab
just mostly fishing for those lesser magic crystals for Ignite Bikky
last attempt for today
makes me wonder how much difference she will make alone for Power Carol raids with that jump
three more hours and I will have gold to LU XD Hibiki

now a second attempt
woohoo, I actually managed to hunt down the raid I opened, and got some Int stuff I needed.
usually the raids I join are at least bit faster
reporting that only because it progresses a bit slow compared to the usual
I also found this one
looks cleaner and larger
okay, just a test

okay, I don't care that much, but it makes those print screens smaller
ah
<@!76843888991535104> maybe you might get the Hunt reward if you attack it soon
Five's raid is 10K left
3 AP one, so I'm gonna switch to manual skills
I'm in
well, I'm in that raid, thanks.
alright, <@!127991170201681920> opened
thanks, I will start it
there's one I'm, 885 K HP left, two hours.
RNG doesn't like me üòÑ
I know, trying that with no luck
1) my team for that is abysmal 2) I'm aware it generates less interest than Carols 3) I'm out of P Carols attempts
Is there anyone willing to help if I start Intelligence Hard Raid
last Power Carol raid
round 2


opening them real soon, just let me finish the first attempt, game
I will soon, I'm just waiting for rollover
this time I'm playing it a bit more safe and gunning mostly for contribution reward
another found
especially the Hunt reward was pure trash from my POV, now I feel bad about trying my luck and snatching it from someone else
I got all rewards but challenge for that by starting an attempt before I went out to take out my plastic and glass trash so that recycling company could pick them up, but I got jinxed again and no Giga Ints <:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
actually 143K left now
close to finishing off by anyone who can sweep in at right moment
over two hours to finish, but honestly with few refills I could probably take it out on my own if there is zero interest from now on.
found this spot
the one I found, good night everyone
I found one at 110K left
I need some sleep, so I will just hit whichever raid has the least HP with 3 AP and hope it gets killed.
probably should AP 3 to get Contribution Reward
last Power Carol this day
why the P Carol raids I open for other people now keep spamming Giga Ints at me. RNG playing a cruel joke on me after that days long grind for Giga Ints.
I forgot I starteed this raid
opened for anyone interested
opened the third 30 minutes before rollover
I gave 500 HP worth of stat boosting enhancers to I type Jii 60 lvl 4 star, and she lasted longer.
I probably would've done a bit better if the boss didn't fixate enough on XD Bikky that she dropped out rather early

one 5 AP attempt, then I send invites, do some quests and return back for a second 5 AP attempt or maybe bonk one of these two above if they're still up.
setting up P Hard raid again, for anyone who needs Giga Power or Melody Crystals
I'm going to bed, so I'm leaving this softened Raid for people to grind.
I got her to 62 level with XP from 5 star quest and I already see the difference
whoa
I probably will soften it up with two attempts since I have 10 AP and then open it
Opening Power Raids at Hard soon
my net is back, I will do quests and try to help with that P raid
finally, just 20 minutes and I will farm gold quest
ayy

*second
opening third I hard
how much more?
almost forgot to inform people
which is the crab
she healed up XD Bikky and Ignite Bikky once from near death today, prolonging the battle.
Koito's level 70 burnheall Tsubasa helped me with Advent Battle today a lot, ngl.
and now P carol round
open
open for people
<@!676272618839605249> not trying to poach Dex Carols or you get jynxed with Dex materials?
I also rose from dealing measly 20K to P Carol to around 60-80K based on RNG.
I can give Shirabe and Kanade 10 more levels and Awaken the jii fully
I'm happy I'm nearly in hits for a million league.
bopping
I limit unlocked 4 star int jii, and if I want to limit unlock another 4 star, I will have to stock up (always keeping reserve for that five star I'm one copy away from mlbing)
I should start farming Melodies again
and D Carol round 1
Kanade is pretty fine as she is.
god, I wish I start making more dents. Tempted to LU my Jii to 70.
the last P carol from me
yeah, I have her for Protos too
I use Int Shirabe as my healer for now until I max burnheal Tsubasa or any better healer
and yeah, XD Biki helps buff my P team a lot for Protos
I don't get much out of that, but I like helping.
I'm giving my Int Jii this event's ATK and DEF boost enhancers
if 5 star Ignite Tsubasa is better than them at level 50, I will put her
my sub team is barely unlocked, honestly even levelling those 3 stars in a pinch will help
I can get deffo better I units, so it will just get better
just saying that Dex Carol raids are way more consistent in my direct experience
this time I pulled 40K, but I sometimes pull off 20-30K and sometimes get 80K when Misha is still around.
sometimes I get burned too much, sometimes I have way more luck
the P Carol sometimes frustrates me with how RNG it can get
I will do two 5 AP attempts, and then we will see how it goes further.
at least I will get some break from grinding rice, auto the raid and make some tea üòõ
I double checked and followed you now
ah, right
I keep refreshing so far
did you sent invites?
my sub team also has 46 Int Maria
so I wonder if it'd pay off to get her to 60
I have Miku at level 50
and another one? I have two slots for three stars to level
right
Int three star
advice, please: what's a decent three star to get to level 60
time to see how to spend my Giga Melodies
since I won't have Giga Zepellin Chris soon
but I love Raids and Battle Arena
not really, FGO didn't grip me the same way
just to get few more K of damage
now I'm obsessed with maximizing what I got
to think I originally came here just for characters
because I got her to level 60 for the first CC
but I have one Body that's better than my worse Ints
unironically running all ints would have been better
well, nope
in P Carol
I know, <@!368681228741640193> I want to target Garie more efficiently
then I just should get more stronger Ints instead
hmm
this one, I mean
will that Ver Memoria make a unit target autoscorers?
do scorers count as a boss?
if it works against Autoscorers, of course
max my Body four star Hibiki, give her that Memoria that targets other enemies than a boss
since I have finally Ignite Jii (Giga Zeppelin didn't carry the team much alone), I think of following plan:
is anyone interested in helping me with a Body raid later?
I will see how well it will go after maxing Kanade and Shirabe's level and giving Shirabe +99 to ATK and DEF.
hitting that Carol <@!279115815494877184>
I'm getting almost 1 millon per AP right now
I should try to do that with Power Raids soon
cool method
then we all unpause when everyone confirms they all joined and paused
I join and pause immediately
ok, I get it, I think
I didn't know it
since there's 2-3 of us
I will celebrate her birthday by LU that 60 level Dess
cool, I have you
<@!195044406343106560> you're Hanabi?
nope, I will check
hmm, I will stockpile, in case I have more luck with Dex Chris
<@!195044406343106560> Miracle drops Dex mats?
I don't need, but I will help along
I'll see how she compares to 50 level Ignite Basa, and replace her with Basa if Basa is obviously superior.
Black Gungnir Int
so if there's three star at level 60 who gets better than her...
I don't have much luck rolling her (I don't roll to roll her, ofc)
but kinda
and got my Hunt
I did
big carol
Cocoa, I think
paused
though I'm sure I follow you, just checked
I refresh and don't see
how close to the finish?
<@!195044406343106560> did you open it
anyone who needs P mats and/or Giga Melodies, just give me a holler when I stop farming gold rice
I will try to attack P Carol tomorrow
so Int Hard
I'm better at fighting Carol, but if Hanabi 99 % kills Int Hard boss, it will be no issue for us to get Hunt like yesterday.
I can farm Melodies by killing Power Hard without invites
Giga Int for me
ah
if it's Giga Int or something that can drop Giga Melody, I will need those.
<@!279115815494877184> I will help too, I just finished my quests
aha
I keep using her, but she never shows up outside that, weird
question for Koito, do you put Burnhealbasa on purpose as a leader during each Protos battle timeslot?
purged all AoTs who are not at level 70
<@!676272618839605249> should be enough, I emptied my list from inactives I found
I will empty soon
when I opened up free spaces, I had to open again for people here today because two Korean and one English speaking newbies snatched me.
same happened to me
lol
I will move onto opening raids to followers and friends, since I'm now confident I got good enough to kill some of bosses without going fully public
followed you, cocoa
<@!676272618839605249> may I add you? I noticed you've been joining some raids I opened.
so thanks
not Dex Gigas I wanted, but I'm not super stocked in Giga Hearts either
*Giga Hearts
I got Hearts
go to play search, add my ID
clearing my list now
I renamed myself to just put ID for everyone
<@!457268466429329429> first, do you want me to open some raids so you at leasst grab Participation? I will clear friend list from ~~Koreans with AoT units that I missed and people who ragequitted~~ people don't play much anymore and add you.
good night, I will raid more tomorrow if nox works as dandy as in the last few hours.
yeah, I should too soon
I need two Giga Ints to level my allheal jii for Int teams
who opens next?
I need those Giga Ints, two more
blessed
for example, Power Boss receives less damage from Special ATK
some bosses are resistant to certain types of damage
I'm sleepy, but I will at least try to wait until the raid's over, maybe I will somehow get a third 5 AP attempt.
once more to get 3 % contrib, so close
hopefully Participation reward will be lucky
as little as I can
I'm bonking
since we don't apparently do it like yesterday
why non-event Bodies so scarce
welfare Body when
I have four units
y
I cannot even run 6 Body part
Body Dess at 41
Body Chris I foolishly LU'd
Body Hibiki 60
I have Ignite Maria 52
he did
and then go into it and pause
so, do we wait for Hanabi to kill it almost off
thanks, golden rice
just to see how my 3 star 60 level Jii with all heal changes the equation
maybe later, but I'm not running out of storage yet
I try to avoid expanding storage
I'm stocking up on refillers in ADvent, but I'm doing too good to just buy them, so I consider grabbing some enhancers
you can farm events and Advent Battles for those
I replaced my 4 star maxed Shirabe healer with her by mistake
I added another Shirabe healer, but put her in wrong place while I phone played
I have some issues, I messed up my party comp
while I just need one Giga Zeppelin
and I got jynxed by five star I maxed this event
I keep getting cards that I don't own yet
don't worry, I have bad luck about five star tickets instead
to get at least one more copy
if not for corona, I'd bought some stones few days before the event ends.
I impulsed rolled her for a memento, got 4 copies, prepping for a rerun since I have great Mems for her.
I'd also hate myself this event for impulse rolling for Miku and Edgebiki if Miku didn't smile upon me.
I will open
my best Hard Raid
hmm, Power
(also I rolled Kanade five star and that Tsubasa during Kanade event because I gunned for Chris and didn't know CCs would add five star tickets. Another inefficient behavior on my part, so yeah, mistakes happen)
which one do you need
yeah, same
if I liked AoT, I'd probably roll because I had no clue about whether collabs reoccur or not.
keep them around for now, maybe. I don't blame you for rolling.
AoT is not going to reoccur
Bridge Gacha probably will reoccur, it has few times already
ahhhh
events that are not-colllabs reoccur
event only ones?
hmm, which one?
I wanted Ignite, X-Drive and TESTAMENT Bikky, so I paid to get final copies of the first two once I got them to like 56.
and of course she was one of three units I wanted to max so that's why I paid.
but I was under impression she wouldn't reoccur any soon after second banner, and bought to feel safer.
so maybe save stones for a banner you want, admittedly I got her to 54 level and bought stones to get other copies.
but her banners with guarantees have reoccured
well, she's not in the pool for those
she's pretty good right now
you've got XD Hibiki, plan to get more of her copies over time in banners?
Electech? <@!457268466429329429>
sometimes people grab me too fast
if you can't add me, just tell me
Menu>Friends
extra login bonus
since 24 dollars worth of stones over a month is nice deal for a price of 8 dollars is neat.
so I'm dolphining just on the genjuro boxes, 8 dollars a month.
and no one is recruiting until June in my field.
<@!368681228741640193> still waiting for quarantine bucks, I don't have job right now.
she's so close to max
it's frustrating to sit on 58 Chris since the Kanade event ended
Then I got two more copies and looked back at those five tickets and realzied that getting three copies of a new Ignite in five tickets is actually great.
I was pissed when I rolled Technique Shirabe because I felt the game taunted me because I prayed for a last copy of Technique Chris.
so the story is that
batteryu?
hopefully not four star ones
by burning five star tickets
I rolled her before 1.05 fiasco
my stronger five star Shirabe is Ignite Shirabe
that starter five star Shirabe, the first five star I rolled
she's still at level 50
also my starter was Dex Shirabe
<@!457268466429329429> opened the raid
I only fear Kirikas and Ignite Bikkys from now on
also, at least I left the cycle of "getting jynxed with new Tsubasas and Shirabes" by 5 star tickets
not garbo, but nothing impressive
my Heart team is average, correction.
I have great Int and Power teams, above average Technique teams... the rest is p. much garbo.
Kanade just died

700000 damage, my front team still lives
I wonder if I will hit more than 1 million HP after getting a secondary healer.
<@!457268466429329429> also please be patient, the P Hard is taking a while
because I hate idea of wasting a pull like that
I only do free daily pull religiously though
I forgot about free rolls and I'm now 6K
friend point gacha, I mean, since some three star servants were good.
the free gacha in FGO was way better
so I'm not burning her anymore
I only learned that yesterday
she increases the bond rate
the bond memo is flower shop lady
I will probably do that one refill, I have bought 10 today from Advent Battle
do your daily stuff, by the time I finish, I should kill majority for you.
I guess I will wait for you finishing that, if you're interested
I'm opening another
nothing I needed, but no biggie
I need Giga Melodies, 6 of them.
oh, I will check the rewards once I finish this arena battle
I though retreating just makes the attempt invalid
now I know
ahhh
if it's killed, I'm reopening it after I do Awakening mats farming soon
if I hit it more, I risk killing it probably
softened it to below 600K HP
I also pretty much want to keep CP in reserve to open a new raid immediately if RNG doesn't bless you.
okay, just using 3AP to soften it for you guys.
I can, but I could kill it on my own without a refill just by doing two 5 APs and then waiting some time for 5 AP.
I don't want to rob that from anyone either
but if it's not done by the time I reach 9 AP, I will hit unless you guys get a shot at hunt.
I'm not raiding again yet to let more people join potentially and because I need to do arena battles to do keep the streak.
yeah
and then 11 tickets = 110 medals for a copy of unit in such medal banners
since they count for medals
save those tickets for another medal banner like Ignite Fest <@!457268466429329429>
I won't be surprised if that Chris also gets stuck
I have luck for Chrises until it stops at 58, I bet.
and then her again in last CC 5 star ticket, I believe
I drew two Ignite Chrises
when I bought a ticket set for Ignite Festival to get stones for medals for last Ignite Bikky copy
she's only limit broken Dex five star I have
I have Ignite Chris at 54
lucky
and hope for Chris I need since she's in the pool
so I always spend them
they draw from the core pool of five stars
I will put Ignite Basa once I get her to 50
so I'm squeezing as much as I can
yeah, but my backrow team sucks
I hope she survives longer, she kinda dies too quickly to heal a second time
did a bit of event quests, got my 3 star Shirabe healer to 68 level
I should do second attempt for the second raid soon, I haven't send out invites yet.
are there other 3 star healers than the I and P jii?
I focus on healers right now
mostly because golden rice gave me lots of gold and I don't have songs to spend gold on
yeah, I'm only lb'd my 3s right now aside from few I did for CCs
could you explain the deal to Colour, I think you will do that better than me
well, when Kazusa sets up his raid, you and others will get occassion for Hunt reward
I can discern Hangul from Japanese and Chinese scripts, but I can't read it.
by Western I mostly mean the Latin Script, ofc.
though I noticed there are few people I don't think are here who nonetheless join my follower only raids, so I memorized them and won't delete them because they're active.
I just ran out of Western names who ain't here.
hey, Koreans of this Discord are welcome
this game is making me unintentionally racist
add me before Koreans find me
<@!140931012061298688> cleared three people
I'm opening it soon, I just need to get it almost dead
give her Memoria
but I'm in a middle of raid, have patience.
<@!140931012061298688> oh, yeah, a Korean grabbed me when Colour added me after clearing two spots.
or it's only Body Fierce Maiden?
does she also loses a lot from Unlocking?
there's Fierce Maiden Chris with Psych Atk who is Int
only feeding her low level Int enhancers
because I'm putting her in the I Hard team once get her from level 3 to 50
if I have to be jynxed
I want to be jinxed by Ignite Basa
I will see how getting that Shirabe from 60 to 68 will improve my output
to be on topic, I'm doing another attempt at raiding
I have bought support command box since the launch
I plan to buy monthly subscriptions for now

<@!140931012061298688> I have more than I need unless I get rich enough to whale.
I don't need Heart and Dex mats yet, so I will pass
raid almost finished
I also cut money I spend on e-books by borrowing from digital libraries
I'm a whale for Paradox Games
I was able to spend because I started buying less game DLCs
to be fair I also gas paid 200 $ and grinded the game madly because I have too much free time, due to COVID hitting.
I've been using Koito's
I want 70 Burnbasa from my Protos Advent team
honestly envious of that friend whom I helped around, and has mlb Burnbasa <:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
well, you're not the first person here who got help to gain mats for first 70, so don't worry.
I'd have to count, but maybe more than 7
48 and 58 are the worst
ooofff
still in 46 level limbo.
you reminded me how Burnhealbasa is one of those 4 stars I'd like to max, but haven't maxed yet.
and then mostly for INts and Ps
since I didn't really level up much 3 stars until now
I'd not be surprised if you have better teams than me at this point too for some raids
nope
for the last raid, I did two 5 APs and one 3 AP
5 CP is worth 2 3CPs, on paper
I think 5 CP is the most efficient for Hards
eh
damage matters only for contribution and to get to top 3 bracket for Highest Damage award
what's your id, I will add you after I finish this Battle Arena match
I can open a third Power Hard in such case.
<@!192432957946855424> you need Power Mats for the Tsubasa?
and went here ~~crying~~ for help
tbh I only learned how to raid properly after I got my two units partly-whaled
3 day constant grind for them...
I didn't have Giga Miracles and Giga Magic when I got my Ignite and XD Bikky to level 60 <:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
if you go for XD Bikky banners, you will need Giga Miracles for her
minmaxing the units you get is honestly addicting
since she heals two times now
getting Shirabe 3 star to near 70 indeed helped push few extra hundred thousands more than I expected
now if only pokelabrador was more grateful for my "continued support" <:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
it shouldn't take too long
okay, I will start raiding when I'm done with something outside the game
does cap get larger than 60 later on?
I wonder what the heck I will do when all follower and following spots will be occupied by people here <:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
<@!192432957946855424> added you and removed 4 spots for you
<@!368681228741640193> Rage Raid doesn't penalize non-Rage units?
I will add you and then clean up a spot for you
could you clean up a bit, if you can?
you have max followers tho, accel
Copy and Paste ate a digit
ah, it's me
<@!192432957946855424> did you typo the ID
got 5 Int Crystal
I think I burned all my RNG luck for today for that phone raid that I playedin the morning
but It's fun to help
ah well, worthless reward again
I will open when it's whittled down more
the first attempt, though.
I'm almost done with the raid
ahh, might not make it, but I will try
okay, I will whittle down my P Hard and use refills to help with the Tab raid if it's still around by the time I'm done.
we're just cranky at the company going too nuclear on a trio of  hackers, when just banning them would be enough.
but seriously, welcome
> Pokelabo spies
it seems my ISP had a hick up, since Discord malfunctioned at the same time a bit
I will start soon, had to restart game
my dog's a bit sick right now, so I have to give her meds.
I left it at 400K since I might have to take care of pets a bit.
<@!192432957946855424> OPen P Raid, 400K HP left, <@!457268466429329429> you can join too if you're not afk
so I decided to screw it, start using refills and open all Rages tonight for Melodies.
one of guys who wanted farm Melodies might not make it for Power
1-2 more attempts and the Power will be prepared for you <@!192432957946855424>
I need to catch some sleep
sent invite to friends and followers for that Raid
there's Rage boss I prepared for Colour (with 10K HP left) and I DM;d him if he is ready, but if he's afk for some reason, I will have to open it in hour right before I go to bed.
I'm confident now I can retreat in time before killing a raid boss, so I will just first whittle down bosses I can handle on my own and open them to people who need mats and Hunt reward.
and the P Jii is level 45, so she's fragile as fuck, and the best I can unlock her is 60 because I need Giga Melodies
even with poison healing jiis, the damage output swings wildly
the poison RNG is kinda annoying
mhm, I'd tap it too, but I'm grinding Rage Raid down for Colour
<@!127991170201681920> working on Tab's raid? It's 1 hour to the deadline, I noticed.
almost 400K on first try
I will replace 4 star Jii Int with that Jii with Poison Heal on second attempt
getting fucked by Poison RNG on Rage Raid, so dealing less damage than I expected
I'm back
yeah, he keeps using Gram Busters against XD Bikky, this run
so they had more time to use their healing powers again
yeah, AI targetted Bikky more and she can take it
RNG still keeps both my healers and XD Bikky alive
200
300K away from killing this attempt, still alive
works for me, I never equipped it
and gold cards count as Memoria
it boosts money gained from selling Memoria
and gold's an issue
mhm
did you did it with support tools and she's still below 58?
huh, I thought you mlb'd her
I cannot reliably soften P Carol as fast as P Raid, so I will just open this kind of Raid after first attempt
I can help, just prepping a raid for someone else first
mostly because I want to do Battle Arena, so I don't refill
I'm slowly killing Power
and even then, without getting to 70, Int Kanade did that for limited amount of turns
just XD Kanade I pulled, and Int event Kanade four star
at least in my rooster
so far
but they're few
and some units
I hoarded my dupe three stars for that purpose
also don't skill level anyone but a five star
since I emptied gold already from the shop
*golden riceballs
I started grinding XP and mats for three stars' because Koito's Bassa gave me so much gold through riceballs.
I just need to improve my team
(this is my first Dex raid)
yes, but I don't nearly as much as for P Boss, contrary to my expectations
I mean shock
the stun RNG throws off me
[8:33 PM] Hanabi (737,330,832): Wow I can hit the dex boss for 600k now on 5cp
so since I lost streak, I can just wait 2 hours to 5 BP and start over.
that'd already improve juggling
I wish the streak bonus was just, 2 hours maybe.
I can help Yamino, I lost my streak in Battle Arena, so I will refill raids
thanks, Hanabi
followed you
to followers?
I will bonk it again
I refresh and can't see you.
<@!87303126884847616> did you send invites?
sure
just more Giga Powers I'm overflowing with
you both probably gotHunt rewards
okay, sending invite
ready?

Power Hard
there's always a third try, I will open it
I hope you got useful stuff
ah, so we screwed up

<@!195044406343106560> you got Hunt
and just spend 3 AP to finish off quickly
I will retreat
your damage will still register
150K HP left, I paused
I missed your message
I'm in, should I retreat already
The usual retreat after reaching 20-10K HP left point
I will just play Battle Arena match to keep streak (or lose it, I guess, depends how I match up), and I will return to killing it.
<@!195044406343106560> cleared follower list
I will clear space as soon as this attempt ends.
but do you see me? I remember I follow you.
yeha
it's closer to 1/2 HP actually than 1/3
I will take a refill and try to kill it until I get it to 10-20K
opened it
I'm over 1/3 done killinig it.
<@!195044406343106560> I will open Power raid
[10:52 PM] Hanabi (737,330,832): Man I want giga powers but I can't hit the hard power raid for shit
[10:52 PM] Hanabi (737,330,832): Need phys attackers but my best attackers are spec <:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
My 70 Miku will get retired from my best Hearts role if I just roll single copy of Comet Spear to reach 58.
killed
okay
I just paused
<@!87303126884847616> do you need kill for that boss.
for Dex\
I will have to rebuild my team a bit, hmm.
that's a mistake, 11 rolls always have better chances than any single roll
infrequent for me, but not impossible
happened three times
for limit breaking
dupes = five star copies of stuff you already have
I will go help Yamino since I'm out of P Raids
got some Giga Melodies
yeah, go kill the boss
for you, I'm not doing the Hunt reward
pause and then wait for the other person
you know the drill
opened
I wait for Hanabi getting on phone.
click emote when you're ready for me to open
<@!195044406343106560> interested in Hunt reward for that, since you did previous Power Raid?
I'm trying for that thing with multiple people going in, pausing, and then unpausing once everyone's in.
I'm trying to make sure if you want still a P Raid or it's just for Colour.
hey, Hanabi, up for that too?
rip my streak
with 3 AP
Hanabi can take out that much I'm sure, but I will soften it a bit to 20-10K
I need to quickly do a match in Battle Arena and I will open to people
<@!195044406343106560> <@!457268466429329429> interested?
thankfully jobbed
I forgot I had a raid on
but still not mlb burnbasa <:TsubasaAngry:692141154531016765>
*out of
I got of long dr jii 46 hell before Miku event
did you make some progress on mats from that botched attempt?
I got Giga Melodies in first two raids today
there goes my raid streak
<@!457268466429329429> opened
I'm currently hoping I will get into top 300, I'm closer and closer
I will open it after I'm done with one Battle Arena match.
prepared a raid, who wants to grab it?
just fair warning I'm taking slower today since I'm grinding hexas too
sure, I will let you know when I'm ready
which?
huh, second raid, second portion of Giga Melodies
I have four star Chris at 44, 54 Ignite Chris, a Shirabe five star at 50, and that's all. Haven't touched Dex 3 stars yet.
I don't have any other Dex four star max limit broken
dunno, but my Dex team is weak enough that she will improve it
the only Kirika I got so leveled that much so far, I have used her for Shirabe Hexa.
and here's my belated  contribution to Kirika's birthday <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
more Giga Melodies
that was lucky one
ok, feel free to hop in while you can since I'm killing this one in few attempts
over 1 hour left when I found it, guy did 11K damage and no one else joined.
bonking some newbie's Raid right now I found out of sympathy.
got Hibiki to Skill 3 with Hex drops
I should be able to farm Powers a bit faster, at least
honestly raids are one of the joys of the game for me, since the feel of progression is a hell of a drug.
not that I need, 3 5 APs to kill that boss is reasonably good, but I want to see if I can do it in two.
anyway, at the moment the only way I can improve my Int team is 1) rolling more Ignite Basas 2) leveling that Int Chris 3 star since she has Phys
well, I plan to try to dolphin for her copies for purely subjective reasons
I opened Dex once, since I thought it'd be a breeze comparable to Power Hard, and it turned out I was wrong
same
I put her already.
I don't have any decent Special ATK card but 70 level four star P Hibiki
I need to rebuild my Dex Raid team, since I missed the memo about being resistant to Psych
beforehand I skipped out on Hunt, but I need 7 Giga Melodies agian to restock.
ok, so I'm free to unpause and kill it.
tell me when you are in, Hanabi
ahh
for Power Hard Raid? Blue.
<@!195044406343106560> opened
alright
deffo replacing Kanade's front row position if I get her to 70 or when she gets in overall better before reaching mlb.
added Basa to my Power Raid team, she should be decentish for a backrow.
I will wait until its close to expiration
ping me if you need it

who needs a Power Hard Hunt reward?
almost done killing raid
I guess I will try to build my Heart Team up before I build up T team
got only Fantasy Crystals
this one for example
are Heart Kirika four stars any decent for that boss
probably should LU those two mlb Heart Kirikas.
by suck, I mean my only leveled up chars that I put in hurry are welfare Miku and Comet Spear
<@!114081181611458563> man, my Heart team sucks so hard right now that I'm only for Participation reward.
I need to get my Deuteros team better, honestly
I have Tech mats for five star Chris, but not for four star Tsubasa
ah, I will drop if I manage too, middle in a battle arena match
I will never run out of Power mats because that Raid is one of my favorite Giga Melody spots
even at hefty exchange rate, just to do something with overabundance of rainbows.
I wish we could at least trade trashy mats that are too common into something like enhancers
got 7 Giga Melodies üëÄ
I forgot to pause the last Power Raid I opened
yeah, it is.
I should be able to swing twice without taking a refill and then I will refill
should I open or you plan to?
Autoscorers can be pain, but once I crack through, Carol gets damaged faster
<@!192432957946855424> yeah
I'm waiting for a rerun, it might be too risky to roll and get jynxed by Edgebikis in turn.
I got 58 Miku, but only hit guarantees for Edgebiki
while I rolled for Miku
which kind?
got all I need
killed it or died and trying again?
if you don't hunt it down, but can still attack again, we will unpause after you get in again
alright, we should wait for you
if you can clear it in this attempt, then we can unpause <@!192432957946855424>
so we wait for Accelzero?
paused
<@!195044406343106560> I'm in
fine, just let me go in first
opened a third and last P Carol
I will open another, refill and do a second attempt at Quartz's raid
got almost everything I needed from the Raid tapped by Cais
<@!449754840445353994> I can tap that one after I open Carol.
<@!192432957946855424> I can open two more Carols, so I just started the raid.
<@!127991170201681920> may I add you, then?
before I got a response I've opened several to the public, but I should have still at least one P Carol raid to open to followers.
Who's interested in helping a smol Carol raid?
I need some Int Mats
honestly Hibiki's backstory with a deadbeat father was relatable to me because I had a deadbeat father and my sister who is her Season 5 Age right now also has a deadbeat father.
not much, but they're her juniors
well, Hibiki is older
no Hibiki with Ame no Habakiri in a world where Tsubasa dies is a wasted potential
Akebono No Hikari artbook for Kaijiri has fantastic art, and I'm gonna drop a piece here, I guess.

what a shame Mikus aren't different across AUs that much
I don't ship the pairing, I just like idea of AU where there are identical twin Bikkys who develop different personalities and have clashing sibling dynamic.
https://www.deccanherald.com/entertainment/entertainment-news/identical-twin-brothers-marry-identical-twin-sisters-and-now-they-are-expecting-together-874057.html
like heard of such pairing where the children of those two couples are both genetic siblings and cousins.
stuff like identical twins marrying with identical twins happened IRL.

there was a recent string of native american threads with reading lists that weren't completely spammed, so I expanded my quarantine reading list
and for a while threads about Mezoamerica either got raided by /pol/ brigades or got spammed by some weird Incan supremacist who called everyone outside South America orangutans.
I'm a bit inconvenienced by /pol/ because I occassionally browse /his/ for the few percent threads that actually have good content
either it's full extreme right or full extreme left in case of /lefty pol/
<@!302063351767498752> well, /pol/ has been full extreme for a while

based on my current voting record in presidential elections, I just vote for my preferred candidate in the first round since no one can gain majority, then I vote for whoever isn't conservative.
I planned to vote social democrat in first presidential round and then liberal in the second, but I doubt COVID will go away by May 10. I'm very for delaying the elections in Poland.
we still haven't reversed the controversial changes to the justice system, and we're still getting fined by Brussels, though.
a chunk of conservatives rebelled against the changes, so the registered mail voting law that could potentially favor pro-conservative demographics didn't get through.
Poland's edging closer than USA imho, but currently there's a row in parliament over changes to elections, unlike in Hungary.

well, Tories are in such a position that while there are people in the party who would rather go to for American style healthcare, NHS has been a British institution since early 1950s, and repealing it would just tank Tory chances for foreseeable future, so not even Thatcher touched NHS in any other way than defunding it.
let's put it this way: while NHS is way more efficient and successful than universal healthcares in developing countries, there are universal healthcare systems in developed world, including single payers similar to NHS, that has outpaced it quite, so it could get better.
because I'm sure that'd be a fig leaf for defunding more.
NHS could use some efficiency increasing measures too, but not in this political climate
If a hospital is poorly managed, waiting lists will get too long.
Waiting lists exist so that that services that people need faster are prioritized, if the lists get too long, that's on the individual bureaucracy, not the model itself.
When I had a kidney stone, in contrast I got my stone removed after several hours. Same when I injured my finger so bad people thought I broke it, 3 hours of waiting.
I might be waiting months for prescriptions from psychologists or eye doctors, but that's part of the system when there's a high demand for specific service. Most of the time prescriptions last long enough in my case.
public option is honestly a good start, and waiting lists are a meme, honestly. They certainly don't apply to emergencies.
because the US private healthcare is a Byzantine mess
universal healthcare in USA would unironically lower the costs
and the income tax rates here are 18/36 % I believe. The higher bracket could have been higher, Forbes op-ed highlighted that we should probably raise it.
my country has actually lower debt to GDP ration than USA, last time I checked.
Knowing Better had decent introductionary video to how Byzantine American healthcare can get https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44mvkMqrW4U
not just because of the private nature of healthcare but because the regulations and rules are complicated as hell too.
Americans spend most per capita on healthcare
then maybe corpos would easier shoulder higher corporate taxes
if VAT got cut, maybe consumption would rise
at least directly
honestly corpos don't lose from VAT, it's the consumers who naturally are burdened
7-8 here
>4 %
the gov cut income tax by 2 % for all brackets, but VAT keeps rising slowly
now we're getting to 27 % territory closer and closer
<@!87512939107450880> I miss the time when we had 22 % VAT
I'd personally prefer more progressive tax rates, but cut VAT partly
one of higher millionaire numbers per capita
Also Scandinavian countries funnily enough have also pro-business policies while maintaining that high level of redistribution.
a multi-payer system could have been an option that reduces costs too as long as you curbed the problem with inability to negotiate prices. The fact that there are myriad different solutions that could really help just showcases how bad the problem got.
we used to have organized crime in 1990s and 2000s, but we busted it hard.

I probably will landslide re-election.
I managed to pass such sweeping reforms that New Jersey's economy is booming and I haven't used up the budget surplus for various requests from constituents fully. Progs told me to stop when I tried to give vocational training to homeless and blocked few last bills, but I passed all universal programs for schools and instituted free lunches and breakfasts. Didn't manage to cut gasoline tax and income tax for first two brackets, but GoP likes me for the effort. Managed to pass minimum wage increase by a dollar, and reduce drug sentences by 25 %. Now I'm seeking reelection, and GoP went from 40 % to 57 % support for me, and Dem support sits at 71 %.
I copied the platform of our liberals as much as I could, named this OC Donut Steal politician I generated Donald Trzaskowski, had him run from a New Jersey county that's 40 % Polish. Failed my first elections to a school board to Republican with massive money and exactly same platform, decided to give it a short and run for State House.

let me get a Gallup poll, they're one of most professional opinion pollsters
his real approval rates are becoming pretty abysmal
DC is very black, and very angry about Trump.
if somehow no one tried to evict him, the local people would've
and Washington DC's local authorities are one of most Dem administrations, so there won't be any leniency
if the Secret Service doesn't throw out his luggage outside the gate, then US Marshall has legal authority to evict him.
the most Trump can do in case of a loss is trying to not leave the White House.
Congress has the authority to delay elections, and both parties in the Congress don't want a delay.
It's impossible.
Republican establishment in Congress already protested the tweet about delaying elections, anywa.
because if he delays elections past the nomination date, his and Pence's term expires and Pelosi becomes President automatically
delaying elections would be just self own at this point
He has little chance of undermining it
a democratic China would've been ungovernable anyway without large degree of decentralization like in India.
because that was a city critical for their financial system, the Road and Belt just started falling apart because the external sanctions and internal actions of the puppet administration deprived China of HK's benefits.
annexing Hong Kong is honestly purely ego project of CCP
I think instead of one Hong Kong under The Pooh, we should let many smaller, free Hong Kongs bloom over the Earth.
someone's building a town from scratch for 50.000 Hong KOngers in Ireland.
there's been already things put to motion.
As for Hong Kong, we could just take in as many Hongkongers as we can.
I honestly one could even argue that Falklands War was relative win-win. Britain defended its citizens from annexation by a dictatorship, and a dictatorship embarassed itself so much that Argentina has been a democracy (albeit still quite flawed, the politics there still can get rather ugly, I heard) since then.
And so far Joe is well, Teflon Joe, no accusation made by Trump  has stuck to him so far, unlike to Hillary.
now he also has to perform really well to get those swing states that voted for him back then, and well, COVID is affecting the independent vote, so it won't be easy.
the model 538 used itself wasn't wrong, just Trump really nailed it.
Trump got as perfect performance as he could reasonably get in 2016.

If you're environmentalist in USA, supporting Greens means just wasting a vote. DSA win at very least elected some representatives to Congress as a part of Democrat Party.

From New Dealer side, I appreciate the emphasis on housing projects (major problem right now in much of the world) and the regulation of finances in form of Glass‚ÄìSteagall legislation which repeal got us eventually in 2008 mess. I like the tripartite collective bargaining as far as Christian Democrat stances are concerned.
In domestic policy, Rockefeller Republicans were typically moderate to center-right economically,[2] vehemently rejected conservatives like Barry Goldwater, and held beliefs in social policies that were often culturally liberal. They espoused government and private investments in environmentalism, healthcare, and higher education as necessities for a better society and economic growth in the tradition of Rockefeller. They were strong supporters of state colleges and universities, low tuition and large research budgets. They favored infrastructure improvements such as highway projects.

In general, Rockefeller Republicans opposed socialism and government ownership, though they supported some regulation of business. They typically favored New Deal programs and a social safety net and sought to run these programs more efficiently than the Democrats.[12] They were strong supporters of big business and Wall Street. Many Rockefeller Republicans were major figures in business, such as auto executive George W. Romney and investment banker C. Douglas Dillon. In fiscal policy, they favored balanced budgets and were not averse to raising taxes in order to achieve them. Connecticut Senator Prescott Bush once called for Congress to "raise the required revenues by approving whatever levels of taxation may be necessary".[13] A critical element was their support for labor unions and especially the building trades appreciated the heavy spending on infrastructure. In turn, the unions gave these politicians enough support to overcome the anti-union rural element in the Republican Party.
economically more liberal than anything we see in Reagan era GoP
his grandson was governor of New York
wrong Rockefeller
These days I'm honestly a hybrid of a New Dealer and Rockefellerian in the vein of Hamiltonian tradition/camp of American economics with some German ordoliberal characteristics.
Imagine how quickly deepest red states would (de iure) segregate their society if they were allowed to.
When Jo Jorgensen talks about turning USA into Switzerland I'm like <:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
and some individual cantons still can hold referenda what group of residents can get citizenship or not.
They started and finished introducing it in 1970-1990s.
Switzerland was very late about introducing female franchise.
Direct democracy doesn't have a good track record.
Admittedly I also have rather low tolerance for such shenanigans due to having underage sister and being bothered by a FSN forum pedophile about the fact.
bad marketing, the director being awfully bad at getting her message straight in interviews.
there's no child nudity, I believe, but lots of focus on breast and butt shots and such according to people I know who watched it
but the end product is sexualization of children to call out sexualization of children, and I'm sure people who sexualize children will unironically enjoy it, then.
supposedly it aims to be "disturbing" to "disturb" people about sexualization of childrne.
from what I gathered from reactions, The Cuties are pretty pedophilic for shock value, as expected of edgy French director.
and with social programs in place, most of street prostitution would probably disappear in favor of more expensive, professionalized courtesan model.
for any semblance of legal prostitution to work, they'd have to be self-registered, self-employed, regulated and scrutinized to the utmost to eliminate any sliver of doubt someone coerced them in some way.
Jail pimps, punish clients with fines, do job programs for prostitutes, who are often minorities and foreigners these days.
Prostitution also pays damn poorly unless it's some independent middle/upper society courtesan that doesn't call itself a prostitute anyway openly.
The laws on prostitution in Sweden make it illegal to buy sex, but not to sell the use of one's own body for such services. Procuring and operating a brothel remain illegal. The criminalisation of the purchase of sex, but not the selling of one's own body for sex, was unique when first enacted in Sweden in 1999. Since then, this "Nordic model" for sex trade legislation has been adopted in several other nations.
Sweden has been trying that approach.
IMHO investigate and punish, through civil and criminal penalties, the enablers, treat prostitutes as the victims of the system.
Legal prostitution still involves human trafficking, brothels should be cracked down on. What consenting adults do in their own bedrooms is one thing, organized sex work attracts pimps and grifters no matter if it's legal or not.
Libertarians: isolationism again, want to put everything into hands of free enterprise, wants to legalize prostitution and polygamy, even hardest drugs legal, some champion even 9th month abortions.
Greens: isolationism (cutting all arms sales just plays into China and Russia's hands), anti-nuclear (the most flexible alternative source of energy), neo-Jeffersonian ideas of decentralizing economy into co-op communes
I don't imagine putting hope for the change in the two third parties that consistently run on crankish platforms.

Didn't he for example appoint a businessman in pillow industry as consultant during the pandemic.
It's a way for Trump to try to deflect from honestly worse picks.
VPs meet a lot of people, and a businessman looking forward to hire a VP's son is also on the businessman in question.
the meme refers to how an ex-Sanders staffer and ex-Chapo host made their own show and their second podcast episode was basically inviting Chomsky and roasting him for his decision, proving they're privileged champagne socialists who can afford such implicit accelerationism since more four years of Trump won't really affect their life, and ideological purity points are more important to them.
tfw Bernie or Busters are now condemning *Chomsky* of being neoliberal just because he (and also Communist Party of USA) endorsed Biden against Trump.

just Kushner alone is worse nepotism.
https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/3/1/17053398/jared-kushner-scandals-russia-clearance-loans
cold take: Hunter Biden at worst might use his position after Biden's election to indulge himself more in drugs (and prolly get rehab finally), still less damaging to US admin compared to what Trump's son-in-law Kushner has done for example.
Also honestly, Biden is clearly deserving the moniker of Teflon Joe. GOP tried to pull worse allegations and failed, so they're desperate for emails.
He has been drilling Trump to get FDA approve his oleandrin treatment because aside from being a pillow company CEO, he sits on a board of pharmaceutic company that would benefit immensely from selling oleandrin.
and Trump helped him advertise his positions
note how GOP is working hard to undermine and rollback those achievements.
There's also don't ask don't tell policy repealed under Obama, his decision to abandon defense of Defense of Marriage Act which made it easier for judiciary to struck it down, new EPA regulations helping with carbon emissions, expansions of Pell Grants, and Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.
I've talked with people online who maintain that ACA helped them or their loved ones get better healthcare, so I'd not discount neither that achievement of Obama era, nor its possible expansion under Biden.
it's worth to keep Trump in your opinion over even some improvement, I guess.
Then Germany esque public option actually might be implemented, especially if Senate gets blue too.
If you want to stop Trump, he's not inevitable, people can mobilize in anger and vote him out.
80.000 votes across three states decided the victory.
it's 'funny' that he won barely
<@!278860841485598720> yet failed to fulfill what he planned under Second Bill of Rights.
<@!278860841485598720> it wasn't a revolution, FDR had to deal with conservative Supreme Court and opposition to some programs within his own party. He didn't wave a magic wand. He was contested and worked for passing the programs.
See how New Deal didn't pass all programs FDR envisioned, but the New Deal Coalition eventually followed it up with Great Society programs.
Gradualism can be highlighted in American history.
deadlock at worst vs Republicans tearing down the system further into corporate anarchy.
Greens not gonna ever landslide to do what you expect of them in one sweeping change, not in this current system.
I believe that would definitely help to elect more Greens at local and maybe also state level too while not giving Republicans more seats.
yeah, but gradualism is a thing you need to consider.
Ranked Choice Vote lets people vote on smaller parties while naming their second preference in case the candidate doesn't make it to victory. Your vote is transferred to the second choice in such case.
find out whom of Democratic candidates (It'll be miracle to find GOP one) in your state who supports Ranked Choice Vote. It already was implemented at state level in Maine. It's a first step towards possible federal implementation.
so, if you really want to change the system, there's a concrete thing you can help with.
You have to vote within the system unless there's Ranked Choice Vote to alleviate that problem.
Voting Green, again, is a wasted vote under current system.
I guess better a guy with oil industry ties than a guy supportive of environmentalism from 2000 Green POV.
Gore was better for environmentalism potentially than Nader ever was due to Nader having no chance.
Voting Green helped elect Bush, but people are not learning from Nader's folly.
It's basically voting Trump if you're in swing state.
Voting Green is a waste.
<@!278860841485598720> some sectors are lost cause, service industry is the future pretty much.
maybe it's some sign apoliticals don't treat PiS talk seriously
my mom started buying "LBGT" coloured stuff for some reason, and she's usually very grill pilled otherwise.
because pecunia non olet
I'm pretty sure the pro-life doctors who already refuse abortions due to "conscience clause" are grifters who do it in private clinics illegally.
the West is already pissed enough to cut funding from LBGT free zones.
good luck enforcing that abroad thing
the idiots think that they will totally rid of abortion as illegal abortions will spike up in reaction.
anyone, not looking forward toward crazies getting the abortion compromise struck
~~honestly we should go full FPTP and disefranchise conservatives~~
certainly better than our system where Sejm can do what they want to the Court with simple majority and a President.
maybe caveat that the two members should be invariably selected by opposition, tilts the balance way from sitting government.
should be at least somewhat more robust than the shitshow that PiS did
Full system: Supreme Court Judges are appointed by the President of Israel, from names submitted by the¬†Judicial Selection Committee, which is composed of nine members: three Supreme Court Judges (including the President of the Supreme Court), two¬†cabinet¬†ministers (one of them being the¬†Minister of Justice), two Knesset members, and two representatives of the¬†Israel Bar Association. Appointing Supreme Court Judges requires a majority of 7 of the 9 committee members, or two less than the number present at the meeting.
I'd like Israeli model for Supreme Court
woke: post-PiS government teargassing National Movement rallies
broke: PiS teargassing farmers
but yeah, Konfa should get cracked down on next, since they're unconstitutional blatantly by merely existing.
I'd be rather joining Germany than be under some lasseiz-fairoids with Nazi characteristics.
well, I'd be for secession in that case
we should feel no shame and no remorse about that.

I'm honestly for any result that will let us turn table on PiS and start arresting their politicians
though honestly wondering how much genuine support P2050 has and how much it's new party effect.
and KO I guess.
I think P2050 is doing that right now.

they cannot drain the electorate away anymore.
it's hilarious especially if the farmers are being upset right now

I honestly predict more people might be arsed to go to the polling stations if the anger remains until 2023 or if there are early elections.
maybe, the predicted turnout indicated by the poll was also pretty low
Do Rzeczy gave them 220 seats, and they're obviously as biased towards PiS as Fox News is towards Trump.
even the most pro-government pollsters in Poland indicate that PiS would lose majority if the elections were held today. <:HibikiSmug:672655850518609940>

CNN and other major media called PA for Biden
nah, it's still in interim tests, just has promising results
(don't look it up, though, if you don't.)
yeah, you know what industrial farms do to male chicks before they even grow adult.
nothing prevents honestly from stunning animals in least cruel way possible while still keeping the qualities Middle Eastern meat importers expect.
and religiously correct food are basic necessity for religious clients while mink fur is a luxurious good.
carries less risk of creating a pandemic
Poland exporting meat to Middle East is honestly more about profits since our Jewish and Muslim minorities are so tiny, but
but the very badly veiled attempt to dab on Islam and Judaism soured it for me.
if the bill also didn't include halal and kosher slaughter ban, I'd tentatively support it.
so they will resist any bills and solutions that will stop the money lining their pockets
there's üí∞
Poland is second largest mink fur exporter in the world
yeah, but money, rad, money
no doubt the farmers would go crying wojak about muh property rights, just like when hunters tried to shoot the diseased boars spreading the pig only disease.
but yeah, I'm relieved the mutation didn't happen here
even if that's standard procedure for killing fur animals and poultry in many countries.
though using gas chambers for minks was morbid optics.
Denmark didn't screw around
brace for COVID-20
because there's a mutated COVID virus among the minks (whiich already spread to 12 humans, so welp, at least they can say they tried)
basically Denmark mobilized the military to kill all 1 million minks with carbon monoxide.
but I'm sure in Poland the mink farm owners would resist such initiatives.
so there was no need for dispersing protesters
well, Denmark sent the miltiary to liquidate the farms, but people didn't resist.
I'd support sending military police to liquidate mink farms and beat up the resisting businessmen with batons if that helped preventing COVID-20.
I have no sympathy for the mink industry at all

because of rurals settling at surubs more and finding jobs.
my town surged from 20K people to 30K people in last decade.
the more my small town growns and modernizes, the more the need to keep animals for meat disappears around here, due to how supermarkets can supply you now with all you want.
now there's no need
I used to raise carps for Christmas
easier to shop nowadays outright
I still have the cages to keep rabbits at my garden shed, just you know, we have no reason to restart keeping them for meat
keep fancy rabbits as breeders to loan to other people and show them at displays
maybe that's not a bad plan for retirement
but the virus crashed that plan too.
the plan B was just keeping the adult ones as professional breeders for other people
I'd close down the farm operation because it wouldn't be sustainable anymore, but keep the survivors until they died of old age as pets.

next time anti-SJWs complain about Heimdall being black in Marvel, bring up that Thor could've been played by a dark skinned actor and be clearly mythologically accurate.
In the Prologue of Snorri Sturluson's Prose Edda, Memnon is cited as the father of the Germanic God Thor.

    Near the earth's centre was made that goodliest of homes and haunts that ever have been, which is called Troy, even that which we call Turkland. This abode was much more gloriously made than others, and fashioned with more skill of craftsmanship in manifold wise, both in luxury and in the wealth which was there in abundance. There were twelve kingdoms and one High King, and many sovereignties belonged to each kingdom; in the stronghold were twelve chieftains.

    These chieftains were in every manly part greatly above other men that have ever been in the world. One king among them was called M√∫n√≥n or Menn√≥n; and he was wedded to the daughter of the High King Priam, her who was called Tr√≥√°n; they had a child named Tr√≥r, whom we call Thor.[18]
In Greek mythology, Memnon (/Ààm…õmn…ôn/; Ancient Greek: ŒúŒ≠ŒºŒΩœâŒΩ) was an Ethiopian king and son of Tithonus and Eos. As a warrior he was considered to be almost Achilles' equal in skill. During the Trojan War, he brought an army to Troy's defense and killed Antilochus during a fierce battle. The death of Memnon echoes that of Hector, another defender of Troy whom Achilles also killed out of revenge for a fallen comrade, Patroclus.

After Memnon's death, Zeus was moved by Eos' tears and granted him immortality. Memnon's death is related at length in the lost epic Aethiopis, composed after The Iliad circa the 7th century BC. Quintus of Smyrna records Memnon's death in Posthomerica. His death is also described in Philostratus' Imagines.
Homer (c. 8th century BC) is the first to mention "Aethiopians" (Œë·º∞Œ∏ŒØŒøœÄŒµœÇ, Œë·º∞Œ∏ŒπŒøœÄ·øÜŒµœÇ), writing that they are to be found at the east and west extremities of the world, divided by the sea into "eastern" (at the sunrise) and "western" (at the sunset). In Book 1 of the Iliad, Thetis visits Olympus to meet Zeus, but the meeting is postponed, as Zeus and other gods are absent, visiting the land of the Aethiopians.

Hesiod (c. 8th century BC) speaks of Memnon as the "king of the Ethiopians."[7]
ah, no, Memnon was on the side of Troyans.
since there are references to Aethiopians on the side of Greeks, and Aethiopia was a blanket term for lands south to Egypt.
one of little know things is that there were black characters in Illiad if you research closely
Also Moses' wife was black, as a Cushite.
the stories about Queen Sheba and King Solomon have a grain of truth to them, even if the Bible probably actually meant southern Arabia (which traded with Abissynia and the Horn of Africa) rather than Abyssinian region itself.
very insensitive organization, to put it mildly, considering there are black Jews from Ethiopia and they must feel uncomfortable about BIs when they hear about them.
their religion has of course nothing to do with Judaism.
there's that sect called Black Israelites in USA who think Hitler did Holocaust to avenge "the real" Jews, the black people.

https://ballotpedia.org/Puerto_Rico_Statehood_Referendum_(2020) there's also finally a moral mandate for admitting Puerto Rico

the first thing Dems should do whenever they control both houses should be admitting Puerto Rico as a state pronto.

the war in Algieria was ugly no matter how you look at it, and sometimes you got situations like this, as my friend put it.
He basically wanted his cake (identified with Algieria as Frenchman) and eat it (wanted egalitarian Algieria within France despite zero will for that among both sides).
He had this utopian vision of Algieria as equal partner of France. Neither independence activists nor Pied-Noirs wanted this for their own reasons.
When the Algerian War began in 1954, Camus was confronted with a moral dilemma. He identified with the Pieds-Noirs such as his own parents and defended the French government's actions against the revolt. He argued the Algerian uprising was an integral part of the "new Arab imperialism" led by Egypt, and an "anti-Western" offensive orchestrated by Russia to "encircle Europe" and "isolate the United States".[68] Although favoring greater Algerian autonomy or even federation, though not full-scale independence, he believed the Pieds-Noirs and Arabs could co-exist. During the war, he advocated a civil truce that would spare the civilians. It was rejected by both sides who regarded it as foolish. Behind the scenes, he began working for imprisoned Algerians who faced the death penalty.[69] His position drew much criticism from the left who considered colonialism unacceptable. In their eyes, Camus was no longer the defender of the oppressed.[70]
both FLN and other Pied-Noirs disliked him for that.
the controversial stance of his is that he tried to be a neutral party in Algieria
not too my knowledge
that's why I prefer Camus
we don't have evidence he hurt any child, to my knowledge, but holy shit, that petition.
Michel Foucault argued that children are able to give consent to sexual relations, saying that assuming ‚Äúthat a child is incapable of explaining what happened and was incapable of giving his consent are two abuses that are intolerable, quite unacceptable.‚Äù[2] Foucault, Sartre, and newspapers such as Lib√©ration and Le Monde each defended the idea of child-adult sexual relationships.[3]
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_petition_against_age_of_consent_laws
one reason why I shit on him: he was a pedophile.
I guess it extra irks me because I see the same red flags about increasing deficit in my country.
SNP had all time they wanted to try to prepare Scotland to be more fiscally and economically independent, but didn't make any serious moves towards that goal.
there's difference between responsible Neokeynesian economics and basically overspending with tax transfers from England and unreliable oil revenue while trying to seek independence.
<@!278860841485598720> no, higher level of taxation than rest of UK don't mean much. Their relative deficit spending is higher, average Scot shoulders more debt than average English person, and Scottish economy experienced shrinking accompanied with higher deficit *before* COVID happened to the islands. And they would have to massively shrink that 7.2 % deficit spending to join EU, down to 3 % at least. Basically, Scottish economy is built on shaky ground, but the populists running SNP don't want to admit it to voters.
well, maybe it'd mean Germans and other fiscally responsible countries in EU could brownbeat them into normal policies before they Greek out.
chances are if this trend is long-term, Scotland would join PIGS eventually after joining EU.
and yet substantially higher deficits
https://www.ifs.org.uk/publications/14982 
NEW
[2:51 PM] Lankpants üêü‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ: Uhhh, Scotland's taxes are actually somewhat higher than England's already and it's not unlikely that they'd raise them on leaving the UK anyway.
I'm not against robust safety nets and welfare programs, just the tax paradigm like this scares me. I'm more of amp taxes to go along with spending person, enough said.
Sturgeon is either a grifter promising independence but not committed to it, or dangerous ideologue willing to go through with independence despite increasing reliance of Scotland on England.
SNP's tax policy is irresponsible, leading to greater deficits than rest of UK, decrease of onshore revenues and increased reliance on offshore transfers
they will be Argentina of Europe once they leave.
since they leech money for their irresponsible fiscal program from south England's tax transfers.
Scotland is a failed state to be too.
well, Rakhi, in idealized free market maybe that'd be true, but we live in far cruder reality.
Natural monopoly is outright a term in economics.
Monopolies honestly can form naturally without regulations <@!284390402210136064>
But the competitors are large too, and one giant tech probably will team up with others if new upstart company tries to get into their niche.
it's not like Google or Facebook don't have competitors.
<@!297554276539170826> I think oligopolies is a better word for the situation in some US industries, like tech giants.
maybe taking a third option, not necessarily modeled after Dutch, could work out as well.
and then there are unique systems like Dutch who moved from a sort of public option to rather strictly regulated system of private non-profit NGOs providing the healthcare.
Non-single payer public healthcare may work. It may work better because USA is not as unitary country as UK, and with the states having considerable power, probably countries like Germany are more of paragon for federal states when it comes to healthcare. Single payer to work in USA would require considerable more sacrifice from the society as a whole and more coordination, like in France.
I treat Medicare for all more like good branding, the details what works for America best are not gonna be simple. Otherwise there'd not be as many different healthcare systems as there are countries, including in the best performing ones.
rcv is a good improvement over pure FPTP.
closer we get to January and/or February, the closer we will be to setting final details.
Nothing is yet set in stone, so don't take my words as official.
I personally think I will disclose details of the charity drive when more details materialize, and maybe ask mods if I can promote it here. It will be about streaming videogames from VTM franchise as part of the donation drive, but the main organizer hasn't yet chosen the charity who will receive funds. But it will be either about food aid or medical aid, we're probably going with whichever has more international reach.
but there are people with plenty free time who just use t on Twitter arguments and grandstanding.
that's fine, people can be just worn down to not do anything else
Lost of such online activism favors ideological purism, engaging in jargon that just scares away people from policies they profess to promote, and clings too much to discussing what a group of 19th and 20th century philosophers with outdated economic theories mean (who could predict the de-industrializing and other aspect of post-industrial economics at the time), leading to circular firing squads like implying that the guy who wanted to do menial work was mentally unstable. Orwell was right that we should've focused on simple redeeming qualities of the left rather than throw around Marxist jargon around, invent newspeak, endlessly argue over newspeak, not engaging in electoral politics all the while. 

"When the ordinary person hears phrases like 'bourgeois ideology' and 'proletarian solidarity' and 'expropriation of the expropriators', he is not inspired by them, he is merely disgusted. Even the single word 'Comrade' has done its dirty little bit towards discrediting the Socialist movement. How many a waverer has halted on the brink, gone perhaps to some public meeting and watched self-conscious Socialists dutifully addressing one another as 'Comrade', and then slid away, disillusioned, into the nearest four-ale bar!"                                                                                                                                                                                                            As a social democrat, I'd not mind cooperating with a demsoc as long as they focused like Orwell on getting to the heart of the matter. Personally, I'm getting together with few more leftier people to do some charity drive. Not much in grand scale of things, but that's an action instead of discussing hypotheticals and cancelling each other over hypotheticals. That's my two cents.

supply-side economics, never once
and well, Reagan claimed to be fiscally conservative, but he inflated the debt and deficit massively in his first term.
FDR tried to balance budget while doing New Deal spending at the same time, for example.
Democrats have been consistently more thrifty about deficits than the Republicans since Reagan era.

at least though Taiwan sounded all alarms and handled it perfectly
overall the pandemic would've been better handled if China didn't silence whisteblowers in December.
I'm not saying their apocalyptic levels of pandemic, but the Chinese government hides and downplays negative news about it like it's a second nature to them. So we have to take them with grain of salt.
not better than Taiwan and Vietnam
also to be fair we don't know what state in China is, they actually disappeared people for criticism of their COVID response.
at least those who can afford it.
I think the real testament to Sputnik's viability as a vaccine is that Russians prefer to obtain other vaccines right now.
Sputnik reportedly caused few psychotic breakdowns in trials, Chinese vaccine efficacy is far below the 90 % (but so might be Oxford's).
it's still no Sputnik and no Chinese vaccine
the actual disadvantage of those two is their storage requirements.
Moderna and Pfizer got tested pretty thoroughly
no, Oxford one was the one with irregularities
but we have now vaccines with 95 % efficacy, and which milden symptoms if they fail.
I remember early estimations of late 2021
yeah, the vaccine developed faster than people expected
I specifically posted that tweet to explain so people don't panic about that bit of news too much.
so seasonal COVID? Eh, we will just live with that like with other seasonal flu strains.
Spanish flue mutated, as viri are prone to, into more infectious but milder variants.
note: this is a bit of dooming. We have precedence for a pandemic being with us for all time. All seasonal flu descends from Spanish flu.

though I joked yesterday that it means UK stopped existing and humanity put up mental filter to not notice the Brexit from this plane of reality.
I'm not criticizing UK here, just wondering what the lack of data means.
Poland has second largest mink farms in the world.
remember the panic over Denmark?
when a mink flu starts spreading, it might be on us.
I'm surprised it didn't originate in Poland, to be fair.
to my information they didn't interrupt vaccinations.
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/494680846813364227/796117616015048724/image0.png I wonder why UK data abruptly stops
but this pandemic is a different thing in comparison
the thing is, we barely bothered to test for AHN1
not as much asymptomatic as swine flu
everyone else is kinda figuring out how to vaccinate their populations.
Israel and Bahrain are the only countries right now who are far ahead others in that aspect.
it might be stopped in tracks if vaccinations get going for real.
we're not getting yet there as far as 2020 pandemic is concerned
11 to 21 % of population had asymptomatic and mild cases
we're lucky current pandemic is not as infectious
got infected at campus
I survived that one.
probably still not Kansas.
The pandemic is conventionally marked as having begun on 4 March 1918 with the recording of the case of Albert Gitchell, an army cook at Camp Funston in Kansas, United States, despite there likely having been cases before him.[27]
China was busy with its own internal strife, the rest of the world was busy with WW1, we get the name because Spain was the first to report openly, but the pandemic itself probably dates to 1916 or 1917.
yeah, I know, but sometimes wires cross and typo happens.
*Spanish flu
Governments at the time either had other things to worry about or suppressed information for morale.
the info I got on Swine flu is from Between Two World Wars, and I'm inclined to believe the theory that it might have originated somewhere in Russian Empire or Central Asia and then spread to China and Eastern Front and USA. We will likely never kknow tho.
but yeah, my stance is to distrust data from a totalitarian country that's literally trying to disappear a person who critiqued their COVID response, among many things he did say.
it's more likely it originated as pandemic in Eurasia than New World.
<@!278860841485598720> Kansas hypothesis is not very plausible.
and of course the Chinese authorities this December obstructed overseas scientists trying to research bats for the COVID links.
well, if Chinese banned the open air wet markets, we'd not be in this shit.

virus fears the flaming plunger.
the school didn't help at all me or my sister dealing with our disorders and bullying.
regulating banking professions is important, but I'm concerned with the future of my young relatives and children in general.
there are good teachers, but there's honestly too many shoddy and even outright bad teachers for my comfort to ignore that.
we should focus on actually bringing transparency and accountability instead of hiking wages and benefits unconditionally.
they're earning already comfortably (considering especially lower hours, more day offs and the rote learning nature of the Polish education), but their public union often protects bad apples as long as they have connections. Like my and my sister's nationalistic teacher who doesn't like Jews, to put it short.
Plus I feel nurses are one of those professions here who also tend to look at the bigger picture when protesting. I don't feel they'd just go "fuck you, got mine" after their demands got satisfied in entirety.
Poland has been hemorrhaging their nurses to West due to lower pay than their skills deserve for decades.
the nurse shortage is biting us in ass, honestly.
what I'd do to transfer some of their benefits to groups that actually put their life on line like nurses.
but more seriously, our teachers' union has tendency to see themselves as somehow still underdog group, but also protect teachers from repercussions.
we've got one spreader who tried to attend school anyway, of course mayor shut down the school (second time).
except in my HS üòõ
but you know, also it's pretty much distance learning here, teachers are not gonna spread the coof
if you were in my sister's highschool...
'ate coppers, 'ate teachers, 'ate celebs, luv nurses, luv my grandma, simple as.
of course teachers and cops would get vaccines because they have public sector unions championing for their privileges.
just I don't get the strategy of my country, it's pretty haphazard, looks like pretty much influenced by interest groups.
it's possible to have both worlds.
truth to be told, if you vaccinate people interacting with elderly often, you might as well vaccinate those elderly too.
yeah, I'm very ACAB
unless cops harassing grannies with LBGT flag last month counts as interaction <:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
we shouldn't throw the elderly to wolves in any way, and Lank, they're not vaccinating now, med workers aside, people who interact with elderly.
my granma is in her mid 80s.
but I'm not feeling good that those teachers might get vaccines faster than my granny
but at least she's learning at distance
I won't talk about what kind of disaster are my (and now my sister's) teachers are, because it'd take a while
~~I'm more upset that teachers and cops are getting vaccinated, I hate their unions' rhetoric, and behavior of many teachers and cops~~
but we're now taking time vaccinating teachers and cops
I mean, it's usually medical workers first or elderly people first
Poland has weird priorities about COVID
I just pray we don't fuck up ourselves
yeah
because of the new strain
Bongvirus/UKvirus, as people call it on Discord.
I've seen anti-UK rhetoric right now around the corner
this got out of hand on my part
I know
getting bombarded by lots of recent news of Xi cracking down on dissent, including on people who happened to criticize the response, has been making me twitchy.
<@!170641480791228417> I admit I got carried away

Both reformist and traditionalist camps are global in reach.
anyway, next Pope will be probably POC, but we should pray we get a reformist.
the irony that he's perfect embodiment of values of your average tradcath, but they will still dislike him if he becomes a Pope because of the skin color.
we better get that bishop of Manila as the next Pope, he's the closest thing to another Francis we can get. But we're in absolute mess if another strong potential contender, an African cardinal with very tradcath value, will get elected.
like, if there was someone else in Holy See than Francis, I bet nothing would've been done about that
tfw Vatican had to disband our diocese and put in temp administration because of that
tfw live in one of pedophile capitals of Poland
see how I'm blackpilled about this <:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
why all those whisteblowers about scandals in the Church are largely anonymous? They're afraid for their careers. And stuff like a prison warden getting disciplined for breaking law by releasing a shoplifter with severe mental disorder (practically a child) also sets example to not try to be stick out neck.
honestly similar pattern to how it's among cops and priests.
bad habits perpetuate, some more bright eyed teachers might eventually just lay low to not get into trouble and endanger their career, and so on.
it's just, you know, the whole institution of a teacher needs serious reforms and innovative approach rather than sticking to old ways and beign economically reductionist about it.
there's also the public union not helping at all.
<@!278860841485598720> it goes deeper, there's also the superindentent of education processing those complaints and not giving shit.
university tier grading scale
<@!203444794737950720> imagine 70 % to get a 3 grade, and 60 % to pass.
I was in the firing line, naturally
the worst teacher was the teacher of German language who tried to ground people based on her deranged stereotypes. Targetted punks, goths, metal fans, their 'normal' looking friends, and the daughter of her rival, and got away with shit like illegal grading scale.
and some of the students were more qualified to teach IT than him, considering they knew how to code things, for example.
like seriously, the guy got away with this because he was vice-principal.
some even got paid for jobs they had no right to do in saner environment, like the maths teacher teaching IT while being stuck in 1990s knowledge wise and punishing students for not using floppy disks.
lot of bad teachers I know kept their cozy jobs until retirement, without suffering any consequence.
I think focusing on material conditions of teachers foremost requires cleaning up the house first.

so it's basically a treasure trove leftover from the formation of planetary systems, untainted by being former part of any larger body
it's because it's not really your normal asteroid, but a planetesimal
theoretically it has some profitability margin even with current technology
Psyche might be the first asteroid that gets commercially mined
not to mention the prices of those elements just plummeting. Rare earths are not so rare, they are just relatively scarce and concentrated in the Earth;s crust.
And if West gains edge in that space race, China will be all <:AAAAAAAAAAAAAAA:687664684673007673> because they will lose their relative rare earth monopoly.
It's cheaper to bring asteroid resources to Mars and its orbit and then eject them towards Earth's orbit than operate entirely out of Earth.
seriously, once we figure easier, faster route to Mars, the asteroid mining will just become suddenly more profitable, Mars is a valuable hub for such projects. No need for trying to set up colony out of Musk's fever dream, just semi-permanent outpost creating cheap, strong chemical fuel out of Mars' soil and supplying extraction ships operating out of Mars.
you will still carry chemical fuel, but you will eject particles at higher impulse than chemical rockets.
a gamechanger for manned mission projects
imagine travelling to Mars four times faster
next generation of SMRs probably will mean safer nuclear powered ships.
SMRs have advantage of further safety measures and efficiency, and if fusion develops as large commercial plants first, they will still fill profitable niche.
for example, a businessman wants to build such plants in Poland. It'd take 2 years to develop them, but permission from a ministry is the main problem.
the biggest hurdle are the permissions, but Canada's pretty forward looking
it's very young, but promising industry
Canada is one of pioneers of the industry
the newer, smaller generation of nuclear reactors
If Biden goes for SMR as energy generation solution, Canada will benefit, just not the oil lobby
Canada's basically integrated to US economy, they will just grumble and get over it
realistically, Biden will say just some stern words and Trudeu cabinet will be like "okay, gramps <:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616> "

profit is a good motivation for some people to pursue their goals. I don't think I'd have a drive to do extra business on the side if I didn't get good monetary incentives.
there's nothing about socialism that makes it essential to fighting climate change. It's about switching to alternate technology. Any economic system can do it, depending on the will of politicians and interest groups.
I don't think for example Joe being very bold about use of soft power to go against fossil fuel industry is some socialism (despite what GOPers say).
Greta Thunberg is right that attempts to present socialism as the only alternative to climate change are counterproductive and rooted in 20th century ideological disputes
it's not matter of ideology
implying only capitalist economies can contribute to that
based on predictions already outdated by 1900
Marxists are like JWs predicting the end of the world every decade or so.
very <:doubt:591112084108869642> on capitalism destroying itself
worst case scenario won't happen already
It will be rough, but humanity's becoming increasingly more difficult to dislodge, bar stray asteroid impact that's less likely than people assume.
I became skeptical of predictions of incoming extinction and collapse of human civilization at hands of climate change, due to reading more on the topic.
There's distinct difference between post-Carter neoliberalism of American finance capitalism and the ordoliberalism of post-Adenauer germany.
Free market capitalist systems are as diverse as attempts at implementing socialism.
If you look at Japanese and German CEOs, they tend to be more qualified and more attached to a single company than average American CEO. It used to be like that in New Deal era too.
few companies started going back from stuffing boards with MBA people, Intel has been reinviting engineers to high positions of power.
what I pretty much want is going back to entrepreneurship being dominated by people in actual know rather than MBA failsons of old money families.
and the situation is already stabilizing somewhat, shares of the targetted companies are dropping to more expected levels
reminder that some hedge funds actually profited out of collapse of rivals
nah, some redditors won't destroy stock market
I will donate part of my earnings, if I hit it big this month, to underfunded exomoon and moon research group.
we will mine it, but as scientific experiment to learn its mineral components since it's a very old asteroid predating planetary formation.
with our level of technology, there's already theoretically one asteroid, Psyche, that might be already profitable to mine, the candidates will grow the cheaper space exploration gets.
and even one of those billion comets is a treasure trove
you know, there's also fact that people who oppose terraforming of Mars with argumentations of fixing Earth first don't talk about the fact that terraforming research isn't just one way.
that's the size of solar system for comparison
we barely scratched the surface of investigating oort cloud
oort cloud, kuiper belt
because it's rich in resoruces
we probably won't leave Solar System any soon
people underestimate how much useful junk there is within the whole freaking light year of its real size.
Solar System is *large*
mass killings of megafauna forced us to adopt agriculture and animal husbandry
<@!430379754190012426> actually we kinda did
All I'm honestly arguing that our ancestors with stone tools and rudimentary agriculture and some copper tools managed to persist similar chaotic weather patterns we will see this century, so humanity might figure out, with similar effort, way to mitigate those.
we've lived through that kind of climatic stuff with worse technology
more chaotic and frequent changes in short term climate
However, weather patterns might go back to late stone age's, just with warmer climate than colder one.
it assumes 300 years of complete inaction for climate change to bring us back to Eocene warming.
Silesian referendum was so fraught with electoral manipulations on both sides and the disinterest from British and French observers that they lead to three border wars. Fucking mess.
No concessions to Germany over Eastern territories, the lands they demanded had German minorities but weren't Germanized as they claimed. More oversight over plebiscites that were actually scheduled, those were a mess.
I don't know how my idea would've worked out, but I'd still maintain reparations, but let Germany unify with Austria (for benefit of both economies and because it was popular idea at the time), and set some framework for lessening reparations over time while reassuring the French and Belgians from the start, of course that depends on American being active in their efforts to reduce reparations through getgo.
But maybe it could've been handled in different way? Occupation of Ruhr just inflamed radicalization.
It was delicate issue, I think French and Belgians had some moral right to reparations (German occupation policy was devasting for their industry).
their impacts was actually lower than people assume, but they hurt the pride of politicians to the point that hyperinflation for example was self-infilcted economic disaster by economists in charge to try to avoid paying up to French (French just occupied Rurh instead). USA did a lot to try to lessen reparations because Germany was their economic partner.
There's also a myth surrounding the reperations hurting Germany.
And even then, he had to seize power through intimidation and extrajudicial violence and conning more plain nationalists rather than getting elected into power.
Germany wasn't in as terrible shape as popular history likes to believe, and by the time he assumed the office there were signs of recovery from the stumble of Great Depression. Nazis played a lot to the idea that Germany got stabbed in the back and should've totally won, as well rallying support against perceived "degeneracy" of society.
Hitler coming into power cannot be reduced to economic views.
They material gains were ends to their means, literally looting to fuel the further war against perceived ideological enemies rather than build up their economic position in long-term.
Take Nazis.
quite a lot of wars were over ideology though or irrational material interests.
all there's here is that Bolivian society had the most agenda in here.
Do we listen to Musk known for shitposting or look at actual political situation in Bolivia before and after the unrest that removed Evo
as of right now, it's unprofitable to mine without serious investment from foreign companies or domestic investment that the government cannot right now afford, so both Evo and Arce invited investment. Is the theory of coup for lithium even holding any water if both the corrupt guy against whom the unrest was directed at and his more clean successor have Western investment friendly trade policy?
the lithium stuff is also complicated
I'm fine with how stuff turned out.
the elections boiled down in the end to the most decent guy in then opposition vs the most decent guy in MAS.
Evo had legitimate corruption problems while his party had legitimately competent people. Part of opposition was pretty shit too and corrupt, while part of opposition had some chance at winning against MAS in fair elections.
Bolivia's situation is nuanced beyond Musk's idle shitposting.
more like military refusing to intervene against protesters, and then interim government squandered goodwill and got democratically removed.
who is continuing part of the policies with adjustments
the same party, just Evo is gone, and his smarter cabinet minister is now leader.
a coup where MAS under saner leadership got reelected.
the social democratic government with socialist paint already exports it to German companies
there's no need for coups in Bolivia
one decent asteroid mined would drive down rare earth prices ridiculously low

Oort cloud is so vast there might be even more planets there than we expect. (Planet X is mathematically confirmed, but a bitch to observe)

Guys fought for Red Army and didn't collaborate with incoming Wehrmacht, got deported to Siberia nevertheless by NKVD.
If there is one German minority I cannot accuse of complicity in Germany's crimes it's Wolga Germans for sure.
pro-unification sentiments of Danzigers contributed to the really ugly trade war between Poland and Germany which fanned things up until NSDAP took over there independently.
It was Slavic majority, not Polish majority, since there are indigenous Slavs to this region, but the city of Danzig/Gda≈Ñsk aside, which was majority German, there wasn't much dissent against Poland claiming that region in accordance to Versailles. Danzig got autonomy under League of Nations.
the whole Corridor issue is complicated.
Greater Poland was a majority Polish province of Germany with German minority and a history of discrimination by the government in Berlin since middle 19th century. Insurrection was inevitable, just happened at most opportune timing.
I'm talking about interwar
7:34 PM] Noi: the majority of East Germans were driven out by the Red Army
my own region stayed in Germany, but kicked out Germans fair and square through uprising (probably only Polish uprising that achieved 100 % goals), so it was a violent manifestation of local popular will.

He got mocked by African farmers whose routines he observed, exactly for jogging in the morning.
they simply get enough exercise from the chores and responsibilities they do, the idea of running for fun is crazy to them, as mentioned by a researcher who investigated that.
pre-modern people living in some pockets of the world that are not still fully modernized prefer sitting and crouching a lot
running for leisure is modern fad
Schleicher and Von Papen thought they'd have kept him in check despite giving him chancellorship and giving Goering power over Prussian police.

Nazis did have plurality and majority in few places, but weren't outright elected and subverted ther authorities with SA and other extralegal means.
I could just recommend you to read Evans trilogy, Weimar history is very complicated.
*ready to start typing how Nazis weren't elected democratically, but right leaning parts of Reichstag gave them rope they hanged them on*
anyway, Somalis are whom they are, the region used to be hub between Africa, Europe and Asia and might still become one again, it's exercise in pointlessness to try classify that nation into some one category.
African Americans and Somalis weren't classified as black but mixed.
Indians were white, for example.
had very narrow definition of black and very wide definition of white
My old geographical atlas which wasn't American
but I think USA should start flexing its soft power in terms of sponsoring education more
maybe
Somalis were classified as white, but also could claim black status as Africans.
some of those classifications in that table were pointless red tape
in the end, it's not a solution to draw *too complex* classifications.
often to distinguish booming developing countries like Botswana and Dominicana from those who are faring much worse.
<@!181831124958445568> if students are mostly from developing countries, then it's time for taking into account more precise socioeconomic factors. I believe there's also a difference between middle income countries and the least developed countries that's now becoming popular in the discourse.
by other factors I mean stuff like disabilities and so on that are not related to ethnic origin.
that'd cover majority of racial minorities anyway while saving paper work for tackling other factors.
I think it'd have been plain easy to just, when taking into account quotas of foreign students, just split people in those from developing countries and developed countries.
Pashtun from Pakistan crossing border to Afghanistan magically whitens by the decree of a university red tape enthusiast.
<@!173112001684439040> what got me about one Cali uni is how they drew a very complex system to determine whiteness, and one ethnic group split over two countries was white in one country and Asian in other.
But that'd require Brazilian establishment and society to lean towards that view, of course. Nothing such radical can be done without them.
we probably can't grow much food by restoring Amazon to its original glory, but we could reengineer Amazon to take advantage of its biological and genetical capital.
https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/pristine-untouched-amazonian-rainforest-was-actually-shaped-humans-180962378/
as far back as 11.000 years ago
there was agricultural method in Amazon basin that selectively cultivated enclaves of newly tamed plants without compromising majority of forest area.
is the fun fact it's partly man made by the pre-Columbian civilizations that used to flourish there
the cool thing about Amazon forest that proves human interference in rainforests is not necessarily brutal
anyway, there's no debate among environmentalists whether things has gone in worse direction, the debate is about short term and long term remedy
Even the Gaian camp of planetary scientists has been moving into more pessimistic view about the planet's capability to self regulate even in absence of human activity.
I didn't read him yet, but I read a good argument that nature left on its own is inherently Medean/agressively Darwinistic and prone to disturbances, and intelligent beings can try to reengineer the course of evolution to be less prone to natural and artificial anomalies.
I don't think Dryzek just means stripping Earth bare
not just cut back on emissions for example, but actively geoengineer them out of the system
active interference is our best solution
not passive one
didn't know somebody 'reused' that name in 1990s.
Prometheanism is a term popularized by the political theorist John Dryzek to describe an environmental orientation which perceives the Earth as a resource whose utility is determined primarily by human needs and interests and whose environmental problems are overcome through human innovation. The term was introduced in Dryzek's work, The Politics of the Earth: Environmental Discourses (1997).[1] In contrast with other environmental perspectives, Prometheanism prioritizes human interests and needs over those of ecosystems (as with deep ecology) or the individual needs of creatures (as in eco-feminism).

In his 1992 book Green Delusions: An Environmentalist Critique of Radical Environmentalism,[2] Martin Lewis offered one of the first systematic comparisons of how Promethean environmentalism differs from traditional Arcadian forms of environmentalism such as deep ecology.
someone making decisions saw the name Penobscot Expedition and concluded it was expedition against the tribe, not the British stationed by Penobscot Bay

hydro is potentially most dangerous, honestly
but that'd probably equalize/change if nuclear got built more often
just from smaller rate of accidents at sites
nuclear is still safer than renewable so far
(due to construction incidents, but funny thought)
apparently solar and wind has killed more people than nuclear on average

I enjoy the fact that on paper Breivik has amenities like Playstations that some people don't have, but he absolutely hates them because he hates the family friendly games like Rayman that they provide him.
same happened to few serial killers in Poland who served their 25 year sentences (they were sentenced when death penalty was abolished but lifetime wasn't introduced yet) and got locked up in asylums by an emergency bill.
but it'd have been better if they formalized lifetime imprisonment instead of detaining too dangerous people in asylums after their sentence is served.
we know Breivik won't see the freedom despite being sentenced for like 21 years
who sometimes have to go through loopholes
the real problem are countries without lifetime imprisonment
but overall, lifetime imprisonment is procedurally cheaper and can be actually reversed.
I'd maybe reserve it for special cases like obvious crimes against humanity before international courts.
but oh well, that ship sailed, we have worse issues to worry about like vaccine rollout

24. "The Philippines must be half-empty ‚Äî you're all here running the NHS," he told nurses at  Luton and Dunstable Hospital in 2013.]
21. "You look like you're ready for bed!" he told the President of Nigeria in 2003, who was dressed in traditional robes.
20. "So who's on drugs here?... He looks as if he's on drugs," he said of a 14-year-old boy while at a Bangladeshi youth club in 2002.
excuse me, it was native Austrialians
19. "Do you still throw spears at each other?" he asked a group of Indigenous Australians in 2002, while on a visit to Australia with the Queen.
15. "You managed not to get eaten then?" the Prince asked a British student who had been trekking in Papua New Guinea, in 1998.
12. "Aren't most of you descended from pirates?," he enquired to an islander while in the Cayman Islands in 1994.
8. "If it has four legs and it is not a chair, if it has two wings and flies but is not an aeroplane, and if it swims and it is not a submarine, the Cantonese will eat it." Again with the Chinese insults, when he addressed a World Wildlife Fund meeting in 1986.

Boredom and monotony of prison life can be a serious obstacle  to resocialization.
I don't remember anymore who and were talked about it on Discord, but I vaguely recall some prison employee who mentioned that well behaving prisoners with shorter sentences got rewarded with being allowed to play tabletop game sessions like DnD and that genuinely distracted them from more usual prison entertainment like indulging in alcohol and cigarettes and brawls and gambling.
for small time criminals honestly good entertainment can be incentive improving their morale
and his claims about being tortured of course always fall flat when you see his conditions. He's just mad they're not fulfilling his every whim and just give him basic but humanely decent living space with entertainment that doesn't appeal to his twisted mind.
that makes me feel he's actually punished, and the uproar over how neat his cell looks is a non-controversy, since he's not getting everything what he wants.
but the online public would always benefit from a good coverage
so maybe at faster pace
if he did it year by year, he'd do it until retirement at very old age.
I'm being ironic since World Wars had also weird, shifting alliances but can Indy cover Cold War after WW2 beyond just the missile crisis?

In the end Vietnamese put him under house arrest when they cut the Gordian knot by invading Cambodia
so tangled up
well, I mixed it up, Sihanouk was also backed by PRC
Vietnamese backed prince Sihanouk (again, monarchists ü§ù Marxist Leninists sometimes happens), while Chinese backed Pol Pot.
I mean, at that point Vietnamese and Chinese backed different horses in Cambodia.
Probably though the divorce between PRC and Vietnamese Socialist Republic was inevitable.
My polsci friend says that we probably have to thank Carter and Brzezi≈Ñski about Vietnamese pivot, aside from thanking Chinese ironically for doing the failed invasion. Brzezi≈Ñski had some role in stirring Deng's paranoia about Vietnam's loyalties to China, he told me.
Ideology doesn't matter that much, it's interests of countries.
Kuwait has been that on smaller scale, they were most pro-Soviet country (despite being monarchy) in MENA before Saddam embarked on his wild ride, they did a 180 degree about USA.
If we talk about Asia in general, nothing illustrates more how diplomacy is indeed complex and shifting subject than Vietnam going from communists the West tried to contain when they were North Vietnam to communists but *our* communists.
Japan compared to China is not capable of building outright spheres of influences with their stagnant demographics and economy, so they're better as distant, but involved broker, I think.
Japan has some self-interest in MENA stability, but if they want to promote more stability to help their trade and resource situation, that's not too bad.
https://asiasociety.org/asias-new-pivot/japan
As in, they are sending peacekeeping forces to try to keep the international \shipping going without major disruptions, I think
I'm not too informed, but doesn't Japan have increasingly active, but neutral route in the region?
I think USA diplomatic efforts though would look better if another party was brought to the table too.
There are moments of relative calm in the same month and then serious clashes.
The protests have never stopped so far, just continue with different intensity, flared up by incidents.
Iraqi society distrusts America but there's huge anti-Iran sentiment that puts wedge between current pro-Iran establishment and the opposition, I don't want to sound cynical, but patient, diplomatic approach and investing into civilian sector and NGOs on the ground could help stop Iran's ambitions about Iraqi political sphere.
because the sensible thing is switching into civilian investments and use of soft power.
it's not going to be less costly
I'm for prolonged withdrawal
yeah
I mean, Kurds pretty much made the Iraqi parliament call for withdrawal non-binding
I think the department of state already mentioned pouring money into Iraq.
we're gonna still maintain some presence among allies, we should switch into dollar diplomacy and ensure countries like Iraq are capable on standing on their feet financially.
I think that Iraqi Kurds and Kuwaiti would protest about that.
I will of course bite my words if drone strikes return to Obama and Trump era intensity, but so far there have been 2 drone strikes with large delays, and the second came after several rocket strikes at the embassy.
that's going to be refugee crisis overshadowing Syrian
It's better to do something before refugees started flowing in larger numbers, and given how Europe handled that and literally shifted right wing because of prejudices, I'm not optimistic about their prospects. USA increased refugees quota by almost 10, but that's not enough, Yemen's almost 30 million country where 80 % of population right now requires immediate humanitarian aid.
of course there's no damn guarantee rebel groups will just stop shooting each other, but international community might as well try to negotiate some ceasefire, because Yemen is a ticking bomb, the worst humanitarian disaster right now.
Cutting losses, bringing Houthis and other local sides of the civil war to some table is probably the best, but not the perfect option right now.
Yemen's unsalvageable at this point, just continued intervention by UAE and Saudis and other regional powers of MENA (I believe Iran is backing Houthis) is leading to stalemate.
Him and Blinken has some tapes about Kashiggoi, and has been phoning the King and Salman about terminating operations in Yemen.
Shifting to more soft power influence in Iraq, and right now blackmailing Saudis with shit compiled on them is pretty pog move.
I wish people looked behind sensationalism headlines more into the policy that's being formulated.
Biden even retaliated in Syria to not rattle the nest of full of pro-Iranian collab politico hornets in Iraq, and opted for a military supply line operated by Iranian proxy militia.
gee, one strike on purely military target after Iranians repeatedly attacked the embassy, and people already dooming about WW3.
At least those who haven't been delegated to chip factories already.

there are parallel authorities, honestly.
It was quite sudden, so I bet economists in Xi's circle are having headache at having possibly regear their plans in short notice to humor Pakistan.
their started demanding solar energy projects from China while China was already putting money in decade long coal plant investments in the country.
though their latest action of defying China was coincidentally good
they get away with being unreliable allies to everyone who tries to ally them
I don't like Pakistan, but I sort of I'm in awe of their audacity.
the precedessor of the current President, from the KMT party, did those rituals, but I cannot find the info whether the current President does them.
I need to check it, I'm curious.
One hand, I'd understand if the current President dropped it, she's not a Han by ethnicity and promotes cultural and religious pluralism, but on another hand Taiwan does preserve still lots of the older Chinese culture that suffered during Cultural Revolution back in the mainland.
I wonder btw though if the President of Taiwan still performs ritual roles that Presidents of Republic of China did after abolition of monarchy, or that practice was dropped by now.
Xi's imperialistic behavior (particularly in the sense of emulating older values of China) is unsurprising given his fascination with Confucian thought (given Dengist paint and remade into Xi Jinping Thought, of course). He is for all intents and purposes the Red Emperor of China more and more as he silences factionalism.
They won't stop investments that in their near neighborhood that generate losses because it plays into narrative similar to that of the old Middle Kingdom's, as China having tributaries that are supposed to be dependent on her and respectful towards her even if the reality is far from the image.
Road and Belt is pretty much also an ideological project rather than efficient initiative, considering China keeps pouring money into sinkholes like Pakistan.
Hence Sinicization projects are intensified and the economy increasingly nationalized into sort of market, yet state supervised economy with overbearing party control.
you know, also mechanization of agriculture would've helped with Chinese crawling problem with anemic middle class. Their long-term growth is sorta screwed if they don't develop their domestic demand enough, but Xi's approach to economy has been driven more by ideology than his precedessors.
India doing it is probably best counterexample to China, they're giant developing nation too.
I typed mechanization of cotton harvest into google, and got mentions of Germany and India implementing machines.
but by now that's no excuse.
I know cotton used to be one of most labor intensive crops and hard to mechanize
isn't cotton production usually mechanized by now.
After locking them up in "deradicalization centers", they started moving them around across the country
I will add that my country's strongman and Bibi started overtures despite the anti-Semitism on our government's part, so he clearly Bibi doesn't care about that unless it's campaigning issue.
my own town got only bombed *once* (on the first day of war, too) so everything to be discovered probably was already discovered.
To this day, new bunkers and new unexploded ordnance are being discovered by southern Baltic coast since the fighting there was pretty intense.
I live far from the coast, so I won't be likely gassed/poisoned by belated OG Nazi attack (and tbh the poor fish will take the brunt of the leak), but I'm a bit wary about vacationing there even if Baltic is my favorite spot.
And reminds me that if the WW2 chemical weapons lying on the floor of Baltic ever leak out, it will be completely on every authorities of countries by Baltic. <:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
The whole explosion fiasco is so frustrating because it was probably entirely preventable.
I think Lebanese authorities aren't too believable about environmental disasters after their capital got ransacked by sheer negligence.
Gazan authorities didn't point at anyone as far as I'm aware.
Lebanon accuses Israeli ship.
I think aside from Iran accusation, there are some investigation about another, supposedly Greek vessel, that are going on.
I don't know yet who is responsible (some people point to Iran), but it's pretty vile.

Some ship under Libyan banner, but not belonging to Libyans, spilled lots of tar into sea purposefully.

while Bibi of course keeps evading prison despite being supposedly trialled for political corruption.
Hamas runs Gaza as autocracy, Fatah has a corruption problem.
I don't like Bibi, and don't like Hamas and Fatah either, and support two state solution.

Basically Hideyoshi, one of the major warlords of Japan, wrote really ranty letter demanding tribute from Taiwan while he invaded Korea.

Koxinga himself was partly Japanese, and since he was wokou pirate, it's very likely he also brought Koreans and Japanese along to settle along with Chinese.

Taiwan is the origin of the seaborne Austronesian expansion whose descendant groups today include the majority of the ethnic groups of the Philippines, Micronesia, Indonesia, Malaysia, Brunei, East Timor, Madagascar, and Polynesia.
also original Austronesians at the same time.
And I believe there are still around the original natives, who are over 2 % of the population.
So there was also cultural difference between mainlander exiles and the Chinese who came there with Koxinga.
from what I gather there have been several waves of Chinese migration to Taiwan.
a book confirming you got medically examined and extempted from draft or got drafted in the past.
draft is yikes, but if I had better eyesight and not abysmal lung capacity I'd have volunteered for Navy.
but I had to procure my military draft book to rent a room at campus, it was one of relics of similar system to China's that hopefully got abolished by now.
speaking of such regulations, I don't know if the younger Poles here had to do this
I'd say not, not without drastic economic and political challenge that'd require China to loosen up its societal regulations.
the example is how changing your place of residence in China to get access to local education and welfare benefits is a pain in ass. Some governors do relax them to incentivize people settling in their provinces, but they never got abolished. Will the government be willing to abolish them to promote social mobility?
Their role as cheap manufacturer of goods is nearing the end as African economies get back on their feet, so obviously they'd have to work on moving to economies based on services and innovative industries, and that'd mean loosening up at least some regulations to promote the growth of middle class, but this might be seen as risk the party cannot afford.
As for what China could, but Xi might not want to do
Not saying that that will make it roaring economic tiger climbing back to #2 spot, but that'd definitely help overcome stagnation, particularly if coupled by incentives spurring innovation, because traditionalism of Japanese business about technology can be sometimes problem too.
Japan might get a second breath if the LDP truly overcomes barriers to significant immigration.
I mean, Road and Belt got quietly cancelled. In the end, though, the demographic change will jeopardize Chinese economy of scale in longer-term, but in short term and middle term it's the economic policies that will make or break Chinese prospects for sustained high economic growth.
for which he'll be partly to blame for, his economic policy is driven by ideology and desire to consolidate more power around himself and his loyalists rather than doing things increasing productivity.
China won't collapse, but Xi will have to say goodbye to more of his foreign imperialistic projects.
Bibi and Jarek are honestly a match made in hell, similar corruption and hipocrisy.
Neither Kaczynski, I remember campaign season headline in state TV that warned that libs will send child subsidies to Israel.
That's the risk with innovation.
still stuck at 19th century in the book though.
I'd look at East Asia and see if there are even analogies to begin with either of camps.
Originally Hamilton and Jefferson diverged on such economical policies like the question of banking, investment, free trade and so on, and the author argues that the two original camps gave way to successors competing with each other until Carter's and Reagan's Neojeffersonian policies gained dominance.
Namely, the author has interesting way of framing the two main schools within American economic thought as struggle between "Hamiltonian" and "Jeffersonian" attitude to development of economy.
I should finish Land of Promise, it has interesting points about American economy that maybe could reinforce or reevaluate some of my economic stances.
okay, I'm going to tag out for now since I want to drink finally.
<@!445783190976856065> I will honestly try to remember our discussion in 10 years and if this server still exists, I'd love to compare Bolivia and Cuba. Cuba is adopting the same system as China right now, officially. Bolivia is carving their own economic system with democratic institutions preserved. They're honestly another good test tube for how Chinese model compares against freer societies.
Xi and maybe his successor could single out oligarchs that don't toe party line like Jack Ma and pretend they're fighting the problem, just like Putin cracked down on oligarchs he had problem with, but loyalists weren't harmed in anti-corruption drives.
I honestly argue that increased reliance on SOEs while also tightening the control over society will lead to increased oligarchization of Chinese economy, which isn't good for innovation.
Unironically going away from SOEs to cooperatives similar to chaebols could improve on the system still, even if chaebol like conglomerates have their flaws too.
I don't think as long as China is so hostile in attitude towards independent initiative they will catch up with Taiwan in innovation. A thaw and loosened censorship could do wonders to make smaller and medium sized businessmen feel more encouraged to express criticism about economical policies and associate together to pool resources and collaborate.
I emphasized their dependence on imports of technology. I can find articles as late es early 2010s that emphasize that Taiwan struggles with innovation, but now Taiwan is lauded as one of leaders of new generation of IT technologies. Seems like undoing the authoritarian legacy of KMT and increased pluralization of society doesn't at least hamper this.
not really in case of Taiwan. Taiwan largely depended on importing technology from USA and Japan and producing it cheaper. This has been changing in 21st century when local startups started flourishing more and more.
but Chinese authorities don't have a political will to even entertain right now more moderate liberalising reforms to a hybrid regime.
they even stayed under very authoritarian system for decades
Taiwan is honestly our best way to compare a liberal democratic economy with Chinese economy.
plural societies do tend to lead right now when it comes to innovation. Taiwan's microchip industry and other advanced industries for example have comparative advantage over China. And Taiwan and China literally started both as agrarian societies post-independence.
Which is why I root so much for MAS and Bolivia now. If their Andean model succeeds, nobody could accuse people pointing to them as "neoliberals", since they're not orthodox economically, and preserved democratic institutions in the country yet.
It's not neoliberal bias to maintain that social mobility truly matters under regimes that actually allows innovative individuals and pluralism to come out of the top.
The social mobility under Xi applies only to those who are even more loyalist to the party than under his precedessors, since he's increasing his grip on the censorship.
He is himself a Red Prince who has been consolidating totalitarian power while paying lip service to such ideas. His anti-corruption drives never hit his faction, curiously.
It's another matter if you transition from middle income country to developed economy, you cannot disregard the private sector so casually in such case.
Its easy to achieve high growth when you start with agrarian society unless you fuck up majorly. Even planned economies managed to generate rather hight growth in such countries until 1960s.
Nor my country.
yeah, and they're not the norm in Europe.
And some regulations can be more detrimental than beneficial. China is not moving towards abolishing altogether regulations that interfere with welfare and education system by stiffening mobility of the workers from one province to another.
Yes, they are vehicle for corruption and inefficiency in long-run. Private sector is the backbone of innovative industry as we know it, and if China fixes its shortcomings about innovation, then we can talk.
Not in developed world.
It weaned off them gradually until Xi reversed the trend.
the problem are not regulations themselves, but their nature favoring SOEs over private initiative.
People like to juxtapose Nordic model against American model, but Nordic model is also dominated by private enterprise.
it's not mere standard regulatory moves, it's a pivot towards increased share of state owned companies in the economy and control based on political rather than economic rationale.
"In an October report, Julian Evans-Pritchard, an economist at the research firm Capital Economics, dubbed the self-sufficiency drive a ‚Äúlose-lose‚Äù for China‚Äôs economy, because it diverts resources from more productive purposes and forces firms to choose suppliers for political, not economic, reasons. ‚ÄúPursuing self-sufficiency may still be rational as a form of insurance against aggressive decoupling by the U.S. and its allies,‚Äù he wrote. ‚ÄúBut China‚Äôs economy would be better off if such insurance weren‚Äôt needed in the first place.‚Äù

Xi appears to be betting on the insurance, and that has huge implications for the incoming Biden administration. Clearly, Xi is preparing for protracted conflict between the world‚Äôs two largest economies by attempting to fireproof China from measures President-elect Joe Biden might use against him. Yet in doing so, he is also repositioning the Chinese economy in the world.

The U.S. supported Beijing‚Äôs economic reforms based on the hope that as China grew richer, everyone would benefit from its greater prosperity and security. But if Xi succeeds in replacing more of what China purchases from the world, he will also undermine the economic rationale for continued engagement with a brutal authoritarian regime. Xi thinks he is shielding China against isolation. He could instead be causing it."
"Xi‚Äôs refashioning of the economy has room to run. His government is preparing a ‚Äúcorporate social credit‚Äù system, paralleling one designed for Chinese citizens. In theory, it‚Äôs supposed to rein in polluters, tax cheats, and other corporate scoundrels. In practice, it‚Äôs seen as yet another state tool to intrude on private managers. Government bosses ‚Äúhave a strong sense that they are not controlling these guys enough,‚Äù Joerg Wuttke, the president of the European Union Chamber of Commerce in China, told me. All of this adds up to a grand experiment in the kind of state-directed development unseen since the days of Mao Zedong.

Classically trained economists frown upon Xi‚Äôs program. He‚Äôs ticking just about every box of what not to do to propel incomes and innovation. Yet we shouldn‚Äôt immediately dismiss his plans as doomed to fail. As a gargantuan market of 1.4 billion people, China can develop local companies of size and scope without bothering much with the outside world. (Ma‚Äôs Ant is a prime example.) If the program works, economists may have to rewrite their textbooks.

Yet the undertaking is fraught with risks. By favoring the state sector, Xi is funneling valuable money and talent to notoriously bloated and inefficient government enterprises instead of far more nimble and creative private firms. The negative effect shows up in miserably poor productivity‚Äîa disaster for an aging society still catching up with the richest nations‚Äîand mounting debt, now nearly three times the size of national output."
SOEs are increasingly dominating the economy at expense of private sector, in partial reversal of Deng's reforms.
"Things weren‚Äôt supposed to happen this way. Deng Xiaoping, one of Xi‚Äôs predecessors, who launched China‚Äôs now-famous pro-market reforms in the late 1970s, understood that the country was destitute because it was strangled by the Communist state and cut off from the world. Deng and his successors steadily lifted controls on private investment, trade, and foreign business. Unfettered by overbearing state planners, China‚Äôs entrepreneurial energies, mixed with imported capital and technology, unleashed an explosion of growth and wealth.

When Xi took power in 2012, he initially appeared to be following the by then well-trod road of reform. In late 2013, a Communist Party plenum issued an economic blueprint that had many economists and businesspeople convinced that big change was afoot. And change did come, just not the kind they expected.

Though Xi has occasionally implemented market reforms‚Äîthe financial sector has been opened more widely to foreign investors and firms, for instance‚Äîoverall, he has shown a preference for the very visible hand of the state. His administration has gushed financial aid to a wide range of high-tech industries, including microchips and electric cars. Nicholas Lardy, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, notes that state-owned enterprises are gobbling up a larger proportion of vital resources, such as bank loans, while the share of national output generated by private companies is no longer expanding as it once had. ‚ÄúThe surge of the private sector has come to end,‚Äù he told me."
no, Xi is undoing economic freedom with his reforms.
Productivity of China is decreasing as Xi hammers out new regulations, so eventually it will be harder to generate new growth.
It's not about just about services, it's also about building robust middle class that can channel its energies without fear of getting hammered like a nail that's sticking out.
it's pretty much a new challenge, and we have yet to figure out how to respond.
we cannot exactly take a hammer approach here. I'm not defending bitcoiners, but driving cryptocurrencies into underground will, as much as I have power fantasies about it out of frustration, just make them more appealing to black market.
Pragmatic regulation, which I'm for, will eventually be done probably.
because my video card is in demand.
I mean, situation got so bad that my PC's value increased over time rather than depreciated.
it's good short-term response
at least, TSMC and Samsung are investing in Arizona as of now.
Also nice to see that Korea and Taiwan turned things around enough that they're investing in lower wage US states now.
did I call it good innovation?
market segmentation, basically
but also developing products addressed at miners
but as for example of innovation that's detrimental being addressed by innovation, there's a move to fix the hardware shortage caused by cryptocurrencies by stiffling ability of regular products to mine crypto
And Jack Ma, if he truly was about to cause problems, isn't the only problem with Chinese financial system, but to be fair the potential problems I read about aren't peculiar to Chinese economy.
But rather than stiffle innovation sometimes it's actually good to fight innovation with innovation.

I'm glad my country keeps calm about AZ vaccine
it will end the nightmare faster than almost elsewhere
flaccid lockdown measures vs amazing vaccine rollout
funny how 2020 vs 2021 US pandemic response is like those crying doge vs muscular doge memes
USA and UK just blitzed the mainland Europe in rollout.
we also hold onto AstraZenecas
unironically my country just shoeshined everyone but Russia for vaccnes, and a Maryland company concluded contract with one of our companies in result
Europe should focus on getting more vaccines overseas than play protectionist games
secondly, such statements make us look even more bad
first, this matter should be up to invidual countries and companies
myth of smug Euro superiority shattered, for once and for all I hope
since Europe is lagging in vaccination rates <:kekw:783904540997976094>
also, this means basically banning exports to almost everyone

It's totally not some backroom deal between Germans and Russians to get richer.
Note how the same people who call for suspension of AZ almost immediately called for ordering Sputnik.
Why not just... make them optional
Like "these vaccines are potentially unsafe but you can have them only if you want them"
But of course that would greatly upset Von der Leyen's lobbyists
there should be no suspensions at all
since it can be store in above zero temperatures
AZ was the one that was meant to be easier to store than mRNA vaccines.

Tourette syndrom people don't string profanities coherently
On February 27, the Polish Tourette Syndrome Association released a press statement in which it said that obscenities used by people affected by coprolalia "are not substantively related to the content of their statements" and that "profanities uttered by people not affected by coprolalia are a symptom of a lack of personal culture, not Tourette's syndrome."[7]

I still have a feeling that he had a decade ahead of him if not for this.
I bet my grandpa would be dead by now, he'd be pushing 90s, but I'm still <:foreknowledge:568164223570542632> about that.
because his finger infection got worse in not entirely sterile conditions.
under the state administration it got bad enough that the hospital pretty much killed my grandap.
there is a funeral house just opposite to my hospital. Ironically probably have less demand now.
I believe some of minority shares are owned by the local pharmacists, few smaller clinics, and local undertakers.
Theoretically my hospital is private. It's a bit of legal mental gymnastics for some reason I probably don't understand entirely since I'm not a lawyer, but it's so private that majority of the shares is owned by a public entity of the municipality.
Parking lot, the helicopter airport and charging shops that set their business in properties that belonged to the city in the land around the hospital just altogether generate quite a lot of healthy revenue.
Our hospital still takes subsidies from authorities above it, but finding more means to generate local revenue was a lifesaver (quite literally even).
<@!430379754190012426> Financial reform, foremostly. Municipal government was in better position to generate revenue for the hospital's budget and get finances back to shape. Then things snowballed as more investment was possible.
my hospital was pretty flaccid, indebted and mediocre under national government's ownership, but turned a new leaf under municipal government.
Also there's a question whether a central government or local government should run specific utilities.
You have the right idea that some sectors are better off under governmental control, but I use natural monopolies and utilities as term to exactly refer to such sectors. Controlling sectors where healthy competition between producers can yield results can just lead to black market and unrest, just how my communist government fixed and controlled food prices, but black market for agricultural goods existed nonetheless. Mixed economy government is not exactly meant to run everything, but should be a third party that steps in directly where it's justified and serves as more distant arbiter, mediator and regulator for private sector. It's basically a question what should be a private and a public sector.
that's a mixed economy with government controlling natural monopolies (and going probably a bit more in your case, food isn't natural monopoly, water and power are)
that's not command economy
> The government also sets the price of public housing, another program I am very in support of. So why wouldn't I want to see this expanded at least to other things that are fundamental human rights in general, food, water, power, housing more widely just to name a few.
I don't see how switching for a system which is not just inflexible (planned economies have huge problem about getting economic data fast and respond to them appropriately fast), but also requires top to down authoritarian control over economy and creates black market is the way to go. That's like going from one bad extreme to another bad extreme.
price fixing also partly contributed to the unrest that made workers rally many times against the communist government.
that also affected my country negatively.
so you're advocating for planned economy of sorts? <:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
I dislike MMT because I don't think debt can be just treated so casually, I come from a country that got set back by massive deficit spending and loans.
it's a bad thing because gold standard makes response to depressions less flexible. Also like, we were talking about MMT earlier, right?
the inflation crisis that Nixon shock fought had nothing to do with this, the deregulation started under Carter, not Nixon.
that his successors returned to it was a mistake that got addressed eventually.
FDR suspended it for a reason.
<@!278860841485598720> actually wrong, abandoning gold standard helped wide scale government spending, because it gave way to more flexible monetary policy. These factors worked with synergy.
Since bitcoin's shares many negative characteristics of the gold backed currency with its limited supply.
we at least learned that non-fiat currency is worse, something bitcoiners are learning painfully.
yes, there can be more than one factor to the Great Depression, gold standard was one of many.
Countries which suspended gold standard helped their recovery.
yeah, free-floating currency have done better, we learned from Great Depression that one thing at least.

ywn be a student of the Musaeum getting into brawls with the most powerful man of your part of Roman Empire
Sometimes the group would wander the streets of Alexandria at night, with Antony and Cleopatra - and presumably also their followers - dressed in the simple clothes of slaves. Antony would behave rowdily, mocking passers-by and even looking into houses, while his lover is supposed to have watched. The disguises were unconvincing, but a lot of Alexandrians were happy to play along, replying to mockery with abuse of their own. A few were even willing to let Antony pick a fight with them and more than once he is supposed to have returned with bruises from these adventures. There was a long tradition of such displays by aristocrats and many Alexandrians were happy to indulge their queen and her Roman guests. They said that Antony only ever revealed the serious face of a tragic actor to his own countrymen, but with them showed the mask of a comic actor.
his father going full <:yeshoney:774031695728345088> when Julia threathened to unleash her wrath on the household slaves
Marcus Antonius was heavily in debt, not helped by a tendency to live beyond his means. His generosity was famous - Plutarch tells a story of a time when a friend asked to borrow money. Antonius did not have any to give, so instead summoned a slave to bring water in a particular silver bowl. He then poured out the water and gave the bowl to his friend. Only when Julia began questioning the household slaves about the vessel, threathening them with torture to extract the truth, did her husband meekly confess. Sallust, the historian and senator who knew and disliked Mark Antony, claimed that Antonius was 'born to squander money, and never cared until he had to'.
Mark Antony's mom tho:
Caesar had a bit more relatable teenagehood, he was famous for setting fashion trends for other teenagers. He was a dandy who got a Roman drip.

thought the part about his reign also has the teenage Alexander, who win his first border war at age of 16.
Philip takes up almost half of the book's wordspace, getting his due.
I'm reading a comprehensive biography of Philip and Alexander, released recently.
All because Philip was really good about thinking out of box and at diplomacy, he innovated the warfare by creating new weapons and tactics that his son later mastered.
but more seriously, Philip II of Macedon is secretly as impressive as his son, because he took Macedonia at its weakest in the history, besieged on four fronts, to a power that unified Greek world and was about to invade Persia.
Raiding on this scale was a fairly cheap method of making war and could be profitable, but in the meantime crews had to be paid. The same was true of soldiers, especially mercenaries and specialists. Philip spent as rapidly as he acquired new sources of income, lavishing rewards on his men and especially the Companions, entertaining on a grand scale and giving gifts and bribes to win friends and allies abroad. At times, no doubt especially in the early years, spending outstripped his means. On one occasion a crowd of angry soldiers confronted him over their arrears of back pay. Philip was exercising at the palace by wrestling with a man named Menegetes, who was presumably a foreign athlete. Sweating heavily and covered in dust, the king finished the bout and then ran towards the soldiers, saying. 'You are right, comrades, I have been practising with this barbarian in order to thank you properly for the credit you have extended to me!' Barging through them, he dived into a pool and swam up and down until the men got bored and wandered away none the wiser as to when they would actually be paid. In later years Philip was supposed to have been very fond of telling this story of how he had avoided paying his men yet still kept their loyalty.

they really didn't have much of care for the gender of lovers when they shamed other people for sexual behaviors they disliked.
Greeks also liked to rail on people they disliked about promiscuity, and Philip of Macedon's eight wives were mentioned readily along his royal pages Athenians suspected him of sleeping with.
Caesar wasn't ashamed about rumours that he slept with King of Bythinia because of the male-male nature of that rumour, it was seen as controversial because Caesar was the bottom in relationship.

there's non-zero chance the rebels might capture Macron and other dignitaries visiting there for state funeral, despite the warning from FACT.
anyone following Chad
<@!430379754190012426> oh yeah, teen pregnancies can be rough
we have criminal liability of 15 for felonies like murder/rape and so on.
if you can go to an adult prison for a light crime at age of 17, you're adult.
my country should either raise the age when you're fully liable for crimes, or make 17 year olds adults in all respects.
because that's when you become adult in our criminal code
IMO aoc in Poland, as well as voting age, should be 17
but I'm still fine with raising the AOC furthter
same
same here
we have 15 aoc with very heavy restrictions that basically makes it's impossible for buying your 15-18 gifts of any value.
almost all prefectures raised it to 18, so it's dead letter law
Japanese aoc of 13 is a myth
I think the world generally raises age of consent over time
and recently more and more people started coming out about thier childhood abuses, especially by their own relatives.
it's important, since back in 1970s there was very problematic petition by many French academiciaons to lower age of consent to 12-13.
now it's much easier to prosecute sexual offenders, also the age of consent for sex with relatives is 18 now.
well, from what I researched, the age of consent was still 15 in France on paper before the bill, but pretty vague in details.
still to low, I'd have it higher, but it's still a step
fucking finally, that's an issue that had been unadressed for decades

D.C. might be renamed Douglass Commonwealth if the statehood bill passes both houses
he's not yet there, but he's heading to, he has still room to change his mind
mayor = 25
provincial Sejms and anything lower = 18
Sejm = 21 Senate = 30
35, I'm 30.
since I got few years before I can run for Presidency
I still don't have full passive rights.
active = right to vote passive = right to run for an office
I think they shouldn't have passive election rights if they commit political crime.
Likewise, I support increasing the full criminal liability age to 18 as alternate solution. The voting age and full criminal liability age should be in sync or it's unfair to me.
Hence why I think that unless the age of full criminal liability is increased to 18, I will support the right of 17 year olds to vote.
anyway, my sole criterion for voting age is "Can you be liable for crimes? You should vote at that age when you are liable."
also you know, childhood's childhood, I wasn't political at all at age.

not saying they won't try some repressions again, but currently the whole pandemic issue distracts the gov.
genuinely was scared this would be followed by Russia tier anti-gay laws, but seems like the government decided to focus on owning straight women with anti-abortion laws and there's the coof too.
it's still pretty bad, since our government arrested once a gay artist for "offending religious feelings."
at some point in 1980s, our secret service rounded up majority of known gays, tortured them for a night, got some confessions for files, and the people still ofc didn't get reparations.
gays became the next scapegoat after my government deported the remaining Jews in almost entirety.
my country had massive pink scare.
my mother's sexual education book from People's Republic of Poland that she had warned children that gays are capitalist pedophiles and ~~Jews~~ cosmopolitans.
as I said, different, worse and more 'traditional' values
since my junior colleague had to repeat school year because he got arrested for a year for weed.
because our education system used to be socially conservative about such cases, well, even more.
if it was the high school during the communist era, she'd be kicked out.
since she decided to lament the end of the summer vacations by having unprotected sex with another teen on the last day of vacations.
my first year high school classmate entered our first grade pregnant and finished by giving the birth.
just embrace that there might not be meaning imposed by the larger universe and create your own meaning, as long as it's not at expense of others.
he believed that existence of humanity has no intrinsic meaning, but rejected nihilism because he was also a moralist, in the sense of believing in taking a stand against suffering of others.
but his ideas are pretty universal, I think.
politically, he was anti-Soviet communist like Orwell.
In practice, he did advocate for different treatment of imprisoned Algierian dissidents, so tried to some good with little influence he had. I just see him as a decent man wishing for impossible and who was torn by the conflict.
he advocated for French-Algierian federation, utopian idea that no wanted.
He was Pied Noir and associated with the settler culture of French in Algieria, but also wasn't entirely on board with French policies and tried to toe middle line while drawing criticism from both sides.
well, there's a controversy about Camus on both sides about ALgieria.
Camus hopefully either wouldn't sign this or died too early to become a villain.
while cons probably would defend them to death to own libs (which is ironic since those philosophers were way to the left, different country, different environment of politics)

the head of the province is a voivoda, and the head of the provincial Sejm is a marshall, but they don't have any power over military like governor in USA üòõ
and majority of population lives in the capital town, so de facto they're equal in power.
I live in a town that's also a head of the country, so we have both a burmistrz and a starosta
only starosta, the head of a county equivalent, is a Slavic name.
mayor is burmistrz
funny how majority of our local government offices are loanwords from German
shultheis/soltys is an optional head of a village, I don't think there are any special regulations about the age
vogts/w√≥jts are the executive offices of rural municipalities/larger villages
we call mayors of cities above 100.000+ Presidents
except for names
there's no legal difference from the point of election law between a mayor of 70 people village and a mayor of 1 million+ city of Warszawa.
since a mayor can have a lot of more practical power than MP to provincial parliament or even straight MP depending how large is the city in question.
it's a bit complex

that children will kill themselves to go to anime worlds
they are moral panicing
Popular isekai anime KonoSuba and That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime, as well as several others, have been banned on certain sites in Russia recently. The Russian court decided that the isekai (meaning "otherworld") titles "promote reincarnation beliefs" and show that "after death, there can be a more full and interesting life, free from control of one's parents."
https://news.knowyourmeme.com/news/russian-court-bans-isekai-anime-for-promoting-reincarnation-beliefs
for promoting beliefs in reincarnation
> On Monday, the Russian district court in Saint Petersburg banned a total of five anime titles, citing the federal Russian law for the protection of children from harmful information. The list of banned series includes isekai anime KonoSuba and That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime, comedy horror anime Zombie Land Saga, comedy romance Nekopara and harem anime Princess Lover!.
hey, Russia just banned KOnosuba.
basically TERF shit
heard r/yuri is pretty yikes
yuri hasn't had such clear split, though it's clear some works are targeted at men too while some more at homosexual and bisexual women.
while bara's the genre by homosexual men for homosexual men.
I think yaoi is more targeted at women in Japan
I'm mostly gay (I think I'm still attracted to women somewhat, but I'm definitely more gay than bi these days), but yaoi ain't a thing for me.
so I get what you're talking about
I actually read and own that manga
ah yes
because recently one of unrelated servers I'm in basically banned a guy for hitting on a minor who was into yaoi too very much.

and proved to have enough acumen at campaigning to be one of youngest Congresswomen in generation.
she's BA of economics and international relations, had to take up bartending because her father died of lung cancer and her mother was having financial troubles.
the fixation on "she's just bartender" is a thing that Reps like to talk about
and she had decades ahead of her, like Biden had when he was first elected.
let's remember that people like AOC are becoming more visible (and frankly more experienced in politics).
and the shift in general mood among Dems
that's definitely social spending happiest president since LBJ era.
GOPs in some server are literally tearing out their hair over 6 trillion bill mentioned in his address to the Congress.

He might have started the deregulation period, but Reagan did deregulation on different level

4500 people were meant to pass over anointed oil, and 13 were crushed in a stampede. it just sometimes takes overcrowding and a moment of panic for chaos to unfold.

unlike NIP
anyway, SNP at least has non-meme numbers of seats
eventually some will be net payers (to frustration of certain groups)
Eastern Europe
imagine if EE starts paying up a bit because Scots will suffer revenue crunch and will start as net receivers, swapping southern England for EU as chief source of offshore revenue.

but then renewables, yes
they've had a decade, that's not that short time in modern politics.
the fact that there's no meaningful progress to prepare for independence fiscally makes me wonder how serious SNP is about the idea, or do they just use the idea of independence as useful point of a programme to reap secessionist votes.
the current dependence on revenue from southern England means it'd be rougher waiting period than it should have been, SNP dropped the ball on that.
even *if* Spain does not block it, it will take years.
if someone thinks that rejoining EU is simple after secession, it's more complex than that

Scottish and English Saxons wary of the cunning 'Gaelic-Norse' oil baron warrior.
local SNP tacitly supportive, but suspicious that wily autonomists will milk both sides after getting their broader rights.
However, the motion to explore options for self-determination was actually formulated by three councillors associated with the Wir Shetland movement, which campaigns for more autonomy for the islands. Historically, Wir Shetland has demanded self-governing Crown Dependency status for Shetland, like the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man. However, the motion passed was worded to avoid a specific constitutional model. This allowed other councillors to support the move. This included Robbie McGregor, the SNP councillor, who said he supported the motion as long it was not interpreted as a ‚Äúback door‚Äù way of getting ‚Äúus into a relationship with what‚Äôs left of the UK after the Scottish independence referendum‚Äù.
I'm not saying independence since never any group in Shetlands wanted independence, just broad autonomy
Shetlands maybe in the future: hell yeah, let gets Manx status with the oil blackmail
SNP in 2014: oil will guarantee our smooth independence
might fight for similar status to other North Atlantic islands under Scandinavian countries
they resist SNP overtures as constituency, the old Home Rule movement might regain popularity again
The last president of USA that had actually dementia was Reagan, as an ex-president, and well, his mental faculties deteriorated so much he could only recognize his wife and handful of people.
I think the heaviest "accusation" I've read about Bush's malapropisms is that he's dyslexic, coming from Hitchens.
Also funny how GOP campaign machine latched on that idea that Biden has dementia, but no one suggested on part of Dems back in 2000s that Bush has also "dementia".
Add the age, and slips and speech mistakes happen more often too.
You can overcome it by therapy, but it's always there for the rest of your life in some form.
Biden does have neurogenic disorder, but that's the stutter he always have had.
I wish people stopped meming about Biden having allegedly dementia, it's plain wrong and probably coming from people who never had a relative with actual dementia.

you know, those calling for escalating further, but only from safe distance.
I'm also like annoyed by armchair supporters of further escalation
exactly
(they also don't give a shit about Israeli Arabs, since they bombed Nazareth, majority Arab town, few hours ago)
since Iran and Hamas mention "Arab traitors"
I'm anxious Emirates might be hit.
I think it won't be limited to Israel.
this might have been planned for a long while, and the fact that both Hamas and Iran are open about those rockets being made in Iran just cements it for me.
And still keep up firing barrages despite the counterstrikes?
Just how many rockets they stocked up on to pierce through Iron Dome?
Also it feels like it wasn't spontaneous at all.
I'm mixed on how Israel handles the Palestinian issues, but Hamas is escalating far faster and resorted to bombardment first.
their connection to Polish culture is few remnant traditions from early 19th century, but nobody's in position to deny their claim no matter how much time have passed.
my ethnicity is pretty uniform, but there's thousands of people in Haiti who are black, speak a dialect of Haitian French but call themselves Poles despite not speaking Polish for generations.
Even if there are black Jews and blonde blue eyed Palestinians.
Jews of course are uniformly white and Palestinians uniformly brown in view of some people.
And multilingual to some degree, though Yiddish and Ladino are experiencing gradual decline.
Jewish identity is multiracial since a long time.
there was never one single repatriation to Palestine, it's simplistic and wrong myth.
Also Sephardi Jews expelled by Spain partly settled in Ottoman empire, and hence partly in Palestine.
2) many MENA Jews migrated to Israel in wake of anti-semitic sentiments in 1940s+ MENA
1) there were Mizrahi around since centuries in Israel
yeah, like it flies over their head that
Silesian ethnicity went from non-existent to 800.000 people between 2001 and 2011 exactly because people could declare two ethnicities.
2011 census allowed to identify as two different ethnicities at once.
I will try to fulfill it online this weekend
the Jewish population officially skyrocketed in Poland when 2001 and 2011 censuses were taken because people stopped hiding their roots in fear of persecution. I wonder how's the census this year.
the bulk of Polish Jews that survived Shoah also left during the 1945-1948 and 1968. Warpac Europe was shitty place for them (and many more people).
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-cosmopolitan_campaign
some Israelis have USSR/Russia roots, but guess why many left USSR in first place.
I have few acquaintances who over these few days started repeating stuff like that Israel is a colonial project of white people or how those Jews who arrived after WW2 are secret Christians/Russians. They're left on political spectrum, but it's similar to that Ashkenazi are Khazars conspiracy theory.
also damn, I think I'm finally ready to burn bridges with few people, though I warmed up to that idea for months.

Israeli cabinet
densely populated region
I'm worried what kind of mess there will be if the cabinet approves ground operations in Gaza.
yeah, there have been waves.
she's also like 17, so I hope it's just being immature at that age, but again, I've seen more mature people at her age, so that's not too much of excuse.
I pity Dems who will have to deal with her at some party meetings, all southern liberals I know day to day are good people.
and of course go into politics, she always talks about doing some left wing politics in the future.
She plans to want to go to either Kentucky or Alabama, I recall.
She's Likud supporter de facto, but claims to be Zionist Labour supporter. Weird inconsistent person.
so much for useful advice.
I told her maybe she should learn Spanish too since that's useful there, but she got offended at me for some reason.
she now plans to move to Deep South.
I think if you immigrate to a country, you should at least learn the most popular language to be conversational, even if better if more languages, I believe Arabic and Russian would be good choices after learning Hebrew if you go to Israel.
Her other reason was not wanting to learn Hebrew.
so that's why I mean by armchair
there's a Jewish person from Canada elsewhere that I won't dox who pretty much copies nationalist arguments of Likud, but decided to do not aliyah once she learned she'd have to do military service.
because they have a right to know, ofc.
I blocked him and just passed DM screenshot to a person he gloated about blackmailing too.
to clarify, he supported those saturation air strikes, so fuck him.
I got threathened and clumsily blackmailed by Hamas supporter in DMs, what a "day"
at least according to the people from Lebanon who posted this there.
well, that's my source for the break ins I got. Just wanted to point that it's closer to spill into larger conflcit.
the local Lebanese claim it was Hezbollah volunteeers trying to break through
got this from Lebanese Discord

it wasn't any act of terror, of course, but the official state is so weak that basic inspections and precautions are a problem in their own capital.
it's really depressing, remember the explosion in Beirut?
but rather as a patchwork of feuding groups like interwar China
Lebanon de facto doesn't exist as a state
that means a war with South Lebanon
if Hezbollah hurls itself into the fray
pretty much people there are anxious justifiedly anxious about three rockets fired from Lebanon
The people there have very strict vetting and anti-doxx rules because that'd be dangerous for them to be revealed, especially since that's a server for Israelis and Lebanese to talk together.
I'm also in Lebanese Discord, it's pretty depressing.
Though Fatah's problem is different, they're also out to secure their own interests first from what I gathered over years.
I also don't think Hamas is representative for what Palestinians think because WB gets more interference into their matters than Gaza, yet Fatah is more moderate.
anyone leading peacekeeping efforts would have to be a third party not involved very much, to put it mildly, into the generations of conflict, but also strong enough to keep peace and invest into local institutions and economy.
that's why Japanese navy has been there for years to escort merchant ships, for example.
maybe if it ever comes to that despite odds, it'd be Japan participating, I've read how for a while their governments have been looking into helping stabilize the region to get goodwill for very pragmatic reasons.
that's why I exclude Israel and Egypt, and probably also USA should back out too.
that's why I'm also depressed about chances at the same moment.
and that's like.... very hard to sanction in this political climate.
And there's also problem that by international community I mean a peacekeeping force with official sanction, because anything else won't be seen as good due to the bad blood between Gazan and their Egyptians and Israeli neighbors.
And I'm aware this would still result in casualties on both sides since Hamas wouldn't go down gently, but I don't know what we can actually do if we just wait on and on. Certainly Gazans aren't able to overthrow a regime with massive foreign help, Iran would just help with "volunteers" and "advisors" to suppress any serioous anti-Hamas action from inside.
no, that this one in this case.
I basically think that as an international community we should try to remove Hamas and then basically pour massive civilian aid and effort to restore normalcy to civilians there. No "regime change" like in the Iraq and Afghanistan debacle, but actually honest effort like we helped Japanese and German civilians stand up on their own feet despite what their leadership did.
<@!476058996315389953> if I get banned from one place I've been for a long time, then I will have clear conscience, after days of witnessing bad takes about whole situation in your country and Gaza, I wrote up a really post about how I feel about Hamas and their backer and what they aim to do, and what I think should be done.
If Israel intelligence claims something, they might be actually right and not making false claims about killing those people.
They used to air raid their facilities decades ago.
their army has flaws and the last operation in 2014 isn't remembered fondly, but their most terrifying asset is their intelligence and counterintelligence. They were able to sabotage the centrifuges that Iran unveiled very fast, setting back their nuclear program for years, by hacking in and triggering explosion (with small explosives they put into centrifuges before Iran purchased them, programmed to respond to hack in).
Although al-Qassam Brigades did not reveal the names of the other leaders who were killed in this raid along with Issa, the Israeli army said that among the dead were Jomaa Tahla, commander of Hamas‚Äô cyber system and rocket audit project; Jamal al-Zibdeh, leader of the development project in the rocket production system; Kazem al-Khatib, commander of the engineering unit in the rocket production system; Sami Radwan, commander of the technical directorate in Hamas‚Äô military intelligence; and Walid Shamali, commander of the industrial equipment directorate in the military production system.
https://www.al-monitor.com/originals/2021/05/hamas-scrambles-learn-how-israel-killed-its-military-leaders-hiding-secret
but the rumours are rumours, I will post here the article about their command structure fraying.
Apparently Hamas is in shock how the hell Israel have sabotaged their secret comms, and some think they will quit because their leadership is at stake.
I also really want to know if the rumours of grudging ceasefire are true or not.
it's still also possible they weren't Hezbollah, I'm just relaying what that Lebanese communtiy Discord claims.
<@!246678192360783872>not when they actually were at point when Troubles were being concluded. Could've been even a different incarnation of IRA from those funded by those guys.
Unionists and Republicans aettled down into basically sort of unoffiicial powersharing agreement defusing tensions, Hamas has absolute power over their region only limited by how much MENA countries that are willing to aid them want to continue to do so.
it's comparing apples to oranges, the situation's and circumstances are different.
Neither IRA had massive overseas support from Ireland or other countries.
there's the problem, Hamas has incentive to cling on power and continue.
IRA weren't a de facto state controlling their own piece of land.
> What stopped the Troubles was negotiation. The only thing that can. Israel needs to be willing to negotiate with Palastine and Hamas or nothing will ever change.
Red Army won the war against Finland but after months and with disproportionate causalties (a thing that also hastened Hitler's decision probably to invade Stalin, because that was hailed as proof that Soviet Union was weak)
Also he still re-consolidated Red Army at the time
he even shipped rare earths and wheat and oil weeks before hostilities erupted
Stalin had this idea that he would wait for the capitalist and fascist world to bleed out each other, and the war between Britain and Germany wasn't concluded, which partly explains him getting blindsided.
very doubtful Hitler would win in France without Soviet fuel for his tanks
Hitler by his expansionism, Stalin by the realpolitik of enabling the leopard who then tried to eat his face
The honest answer: they both caused it spin away into such huge conflagration

Hamas and Fatah relations are bad enough that if Palestine was one coherent territory, there would have been a more serious civil war between them two (it already is a one, but more than hundreds of people would've died in such case)

the society in Israel is so polarized about Bibi that early elections have become regular occurrence.
ehhh, right now it's more complicated.
Russians failed to produce more than handful of prototypes, Chinese are still working to reduce heat signature but at least are stealthy at subsonic, we will see how Japanese do it. Anywya. Enough of geeking. Just will say F35 of Israel also happen to be very good version due to very good avionics and electronics. Moving along.
it's also like, only USA have been successful at developing supersonic stealth 5th gens so far, and that's second attempt. Mistakes were inevitable when trying to make even more multirole plane than F22
F35s are overkill though against minor powers, I will agree.
F35s aren't shit, I will fight on this hill.

the amount of rival and splitter IRAs is a bit overwhelming

If i can justify it, it'd be pretty different, but still beneficial for Soviet Union's interests, but if i can't, i will look for more outwardly dependent Korea.
Kekkonen was a Finnish politician who led the 'neutral' Finland but in fact he was subtly supported by Soviet Union and supportive of their foreign interests as sort of unspoken agreement that Soviets in such case wouldn't meddle in internal political system of Finland.
he ain't a Korean Kekkonen tho üòî
probably would be cool if I found pro-Soviet, vaguely left Korean politician in some obscure wikipedia search.
I have no idea for Korea, but I don't think Kim in power would make sense given Stalin officially props up a new Fengtian Clique, maybe it's also "Finlandized"
Japan still holds onto Taiwan and Jeju and Kuriles since Stalin's navy wouldn't be up for the task (and they're still authoritarian dictatorship, but this time with very defensive mindset), Chiang and Stalin's relation sour over Manchuria where he props up non-communist warlord that's officially part of China, but recreated Soviet Railway Authority calls lots of shots.
Showa Restorationists couping Japan and Hakunshinron put into full motion, reluctant, uneasy alliance between Chiang and Stalin to drive Japanese out, the war ends but becomes continental cold war.
I'm actually writing a timeline with a friend where Hitler was stopped early, but a war in different shape still happened and Soviet Union still fought.
probably not, he was unable to investigate the 1931 incident in his earlier career, which made him just go along more with military's decisions out of frustration.
Hirohito played the role, but he wasn't *active* motor for war
the IJA and IJN were main motors for the war
not him
WW2 for Asia definitely started in 1937 for good
because Japanese and German cooperation was token and non-existent

that book is especially worthy to recommend because as I'm going through preface, it's clear the author doesn't write with the view that in hindsight USSR had to collapse, reminds me of the last book I read, Goldsworthy's Philip and Alexander where A.G. writes with assumption that the both rulers' military successes weren't set in stone.
From /r/askhistorians
"The second edition of Ronald Suny's The Soviet Experiment: Russia, the USSR, and the Successor States is one of the better textbooks on Soviet history that covers multiple aspects of the USSR from its inception to its collapse. Alec Nove's An Economic History of the USSR, 1917-1991 is a brief and very accessible economic history that traces the course of economic developments within the planned economy. Geoffrey Hoskings's Rulers and Victims: The Russians in the Soviet Union examines the anomalous place ethnic Great Russians had within the USSR. Finally, Alexei Yurchak's Everything Was Forever Until It Was No More is an excellent window into the social life of the last Soviet years."

other backlog I plan to acquire in case you finish the book faster than me.
oh yeah, btw this is the book I'm starting with.
the book I read argued that both Jefferson and Hamilton still have influence on the American economic thought and practice, possibly more than any other figures.
though I've been always delaying that since I'm more interested in the practice first over theory, since why I'm reading for example comprehensive backlog on Soviet Union and People's Republic of Poland right now after reading more on economic history of USA.
it's The Capital that should be read, even if it's quite lengthy.
Also not Communist Manifesto
honestly, whether your economics are aligned in that or different way, reading both Smith and Marx should be recommended.

Adam Smith really, really detested landlords, his rhetoric was very aggressive on them
or in more edge case, Mao for example got inspired in youth also by Adam Smith.
Adam Smith for example influences both protectionists and free traders
Adam Smith, the guy people stereotype as ancap
like take Marx, his writings affected, influenced and produced such disparate movements like the Labour movement in UK and the Leninism in USSR.
so yeah, my advice is not to just read theories, read on the history of applying those theories. Nothing in vacuum.
ideology always clashes with reality and produces something different than initial expectations because just one guy writing a book cannot predict how policies will be formulated on basis on ideology written up by them generations after they died.
I'm generally skeptic about political theories explaining what x would do to achieve z

I don't remember if I pithced this book, but that's my groundwork for reading up in more detail about 1937-1945 CCP and Guomindang. Then I will try to find more respected books on both in earlier and later periods.
my source is more of a general synthesis of late Ming to 1990 history of China, but my image of Mao as a political savant who was absolutely great at organizing masses, staying in power and guerilla, but absolutely overreaching or being downright ignorant about lots of other things keeps being reinforced.
Without Zhou Enlai wrangling PLA to fight back Red Guards, Mao's overeager militias for example would've murdered the nuclear scientists working on H-bomb, and the staff and students of PLA's naval academy, as well destroy fledgling oil rigs in Northeast China.
To be honest part of senior cadres like Zhou Enlai, Liu Shaoqi and Deng Xiaoping were the reason why the country didn't crash worse than what actually happened.
Mao's logic was sometimes so tangled up that actually some things people accuse him of doing with premeditation, like alleged baiting of dissenters with Hundred Flowers campaign, was actually more of a result on doing things on fly to shut up circles in the party. Like in that case, he did it to make the moderate wing stop complaining in aftermath of Soviet thaw, got caught off guard by the negative attitudes of the society towards CCP, launched anti-Rightist campaign with retroactive claim that he totally did Hundred Flowers to bait reactionaries, we wouldn't know without records and accounts revealed later that he basically lied about whole circumstances to save face.
At almost the same time that the tenth congress was convening, a new mass campaign was launched, the ostensible target being no less a personage than Confucius himself, and the humanistic and conservative values that he represented. Scholars in China began to publish articles on Confucius that had clear implications for the Cultural Revolution, the bureaucracy, and the role of labor in society: Confucius was described as a representative of the declining slave-owning aristocracy who hated the emerging feudal landlords and their supporters, the legalist philosophers. Since in the context of economic and social development in the fifth century B.C. it was "progressive" to move from a slave-owning to a feudal society‚Äîas later it was progressive to move from feudalism to capitalism‚Äîobviously Confucius was a reactionary.
god, the mental gymnastics from a man who killed 1 million landlords but lionized legalist landlords.

praise for China's first emperor, the celebrated Qin Shihuang, who unified
all China under his rule in 221 B.C. Though Qin Shihuang had been vilified
in the past as an absolute tyrant who brought terrible suffering in the name
of centralized order, scholars in 1973 urged the people to praise him along
with the legalists who supported him. The scholars argued that even such
Draconian actions as his burning of the Confucian books and burying alive
of scholars had been necessary in order to consolidate the "dictatorship of
the landlord class."
I knew this meme for a while, but I connected dots after reading a book on Mao's reign in China.
actually pretty similar to what Han Chinese believed in, that the Greco-Roman civilization was the center of the civilization, and people to the north were basically strong, but inferior mentally, and Africans and Asians were smart, but lacked martial vigour and discipline.
less about skin color

Marx can be read in such a way that you can argue for building up market forces as part of transition on way to socialism. Because hey, he argued that capitalism is intermediary stage between feudalism and socialism, and that's how NEP was being justified by Lenin famously as a retreat from 'war communism'.
and by communist I meant Marxism in general, to clarify, not USSR.
it's a bit of semantics, I said most governments, so that covers most of political spectrum.
reading more on UBS, I don't feel like it's inherently capitalist or communist because most governments cover part of its proposal to different degrees (unless you're a libertarian Maine town about to be overrun by black bears because you don't even have police).
It's basically extra steps, and cannot avoid priming the pump with involvement of a national or federal government.
it has basic income component.
fuck, even the university who drafted the proposal doesn't go for pure UBS.
and not all local governments are equal in financial autonomy and accountability standards.
you can't avoid priming the pump.
"UBS startup requires some increase in real costs that need to be financed before the labour market effects that could reduce those costs are activated."
you'd have to pump money into local governments and held them accountable for spending it
implying basically UBS isn't also pumping money
hell, you could even argue it predates the industrial revolution.
citizen's dividend I'd argue is not intrinsically capitalist solution.
while UBI is also advocated by parties on the same spectrum of Corbynite era Labour.
UBS seems to be so irrelevant that had to actual search for it, and it's just something proposed by one college and endorsed by one party.

the line between the poor also blurs here, it's not like taxi drivers are very affluent. They are going against looters because they're losing jobs right now from lack of demand caused by riots.
they had a period of interunion warrs when they even lobbed hand grenades at rival taxi companies.
when you read about South African history in 1990s, they don't really screw around.
the aforementioned taxi driver unions
since the anti-looter side features black vigilante groups too.
Indian government alleges it's racial conflict, since Indian business owners had a shot out with looters, but it's clearly about poverty.
they have nothing really to lose, as one of arrested women claimed (she basically stole water)
I mean, when majority of people live now under absolute poverty line

but applying all prescriptions of the ecologic movement would beggar me.
I still managed to cut emissions that way.
I balance it with pragmatism.
my opinion: I will go only green insofar as it doesn't hurt me.
pretty pricey
taht those rent equipment services are kinda scam.
I'm also told by a Dutch native
my family owns a small truck and a large passenger car for their needs.
too small for my needs
if you live in countryside town, you need car regardless
or go shroom picking without car
I don't see myself carrying merchandise to selll in a bus
it should be rationalized, not owned by several towns with competing interests.
it should be decentralized decently. Top down rule from capital brings other messes.
companies =/= private
just, you know, the towns own it
it's public public transport
it's not private public transport
I remember some rich Romanian tried to richsplain me it's bad I use car, what I'm supposed to do if buses are less convenient?
but the bus system is a mess coordinated by joint companies owned by several towns.
yes, municipal railway
my town has decent railway, but shit bus system.
my friend understands if it was Manhattan (cars are genuine problem in that district), but there are people who want to mandate it for whole conglomeration.
it's also funny how some people in USA apparently go other direction, like my contact in the NYC Discord claims it's full of people who just want to outright ban cars.
Xi could mandate forced underconsumption of energy in some provinces this winter, due to coal import issues.
China probably has it easier to implement more mass transport relatively speaking, because it's both unitary state and has very tight control over public matters to the point it's arguably now veering to semi-totalitarianism under current direction.
people underappreciate the size of USA, tbh, sometimes.
so the advantage of more urbanised population can be counterweighted by the willingness of states to do some things and also the geographic scale by the way.
with states having more powers to aid or obstruct federal government
compared to Germany
well, but USA is a giant federation
thus the state system has to be taken into account
counterpoint: USA is a federation
[9:55 AM] Lankpants: It has a more urbanised population, which makes things like the implementation of mass public transport easier and reduces energy wastage due to distance.
Mars might have natural gas reserves, I see habitats powered by them and the wind energy
though I doubt we will ever ditch fossil fuels entirely until they become cost inefficient, even in space funnily enough.
coal reserves should be protected until it ever becomes cost-effective to produce organic compounds from coal that aren't burned up.
everything's improvement over coal as direct replacement
said plant burning up natural gas would still be improvement.
just ditch coal in its entirety
good natural gas based central heating minimises chances of death
yeah, got nearly killed by coal based central heating
I feel societal duty to minimise sulphur and carbon monoxide.
or rather the natural gas.
at least I'm sure LPG is better alternative to coal based central heating
I don't think LPG contributes to acid rain and other funky effects from sulphur in the air
brown coal plant fucks up environment more than just CO2
over electricity sourced from brown plant
I will take LPG
you know, even if the carbon emissions are smaller in such case
also brown coal has worrying content of sulphur, up even to 6 %
brown coal is tainted with so much contaminants that it unironically releases more radiation than the nuclear plants.
what
I have this gut feeling emissions would increase because electricity here sources still bulk of energy from a brown coal plant.
Like, if my town for example switched to electric transportation from the ever more popular LPG.
I need to get back to work, but public vs private transport dogmatism honestly imho creates more problems when applied at face value, then it solves.
it deposits the best around lunar equator, and the best spot for outposts is around both poles.
Moon tho doesn't offer anything we don't have except helium-3 which might be actually bitch to mine.
But for some services? Yeah, Moon is actually great.
Earth still beats many planetary bodies in terms of accessible resources, especially Moon.
lots of our sci-fi and futurology still has this unconscious bias from the era of human exploration and expansion that we will venture into space for raw resources and living space foremost.
boon for economy, unless someone has big brained idea of mining crypto on Moon.
computing would be more efficient in those craters permanently shielded from sun with plenty of ice as fuel.
and I don't joke about the services at all, even some science can be turned into profit.
just really small outposts
doesn't require personnel sci-fi envisions
I just argue that whatever we can do at Moon well
woke: Moon with service based economy
joke: mining the Moon
but more efficient to launch from Mars to Earth with Moon as stop, due to some orbital circumstances.
without Moon stop
it's more cost efficient apparently to launch stuff from LEO to Mars directly
Moon, according to calculations I've seen (I hope they're not out of date), only truly becomes economically viable if Mars becomes economically viable.
more efficient to mine from Earth, not certainly export product.
and import infrastructure for receiving stuff from belt and Mars
so the best way to use Moon is conducting science.
Moon would also require importing basically everything carbon and heavy metal related in bulk, since it's so depleted in those.
Moon has nothing good to offer other than helium-3 economically, but Mars would be able to export deuterium as fuel without economic losses, so Mars is better.
they will be Antarctican in nature i.e. scientific outposts
I'm still convinced that Moon and Venus colonies are a bit of fairytale thing.
yes, but Mars has better circumstances for that
it's why the soil is so poisonous
you're literally surrounded by rocket fuel source wherever you go on Mars
I mean
I mean, cheapness beats it already compared to alternatives generated from other Martian sources.
but it's still so abundant than it's better spot for chemical rockets
then Zubrin maybe did make some mistake
it's actually less promising than the title implies
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16A9QgqqUMI
but geothermic hot spots probably are a thing, with very minor volcanic activities compared to Earth's.
he doesn't think we should expect volcanic activity in same vein as on Earth
I watched podcast with the scientist who is revising calculations
since it probably had last volcanic activity within time scale of 5 million years, maybe smaller timescale.
scientists are revising assumptions about its geothermic activity
anyway
solid fuel rockets are cost-effective in Mars
but gives one of best specific impulses among rocket fuels we know.
that burns up in CO2
which is silicate equivalent of methane
with a bit of processing you can get silane
more efficient than hydrocarbons
the Martian soil is basically a rocket fuel
well, the soil is better
Also geothermal might be on table.
but well, in a pinch, assuming for some reasons uranium can't be shipped in appropriate quantities, it's a good source.
I think regardless, natural gas would be still a boon for Mars colony. Less need for importing hydrocarbons for organic industry.
because Mars has easier sourced deuterium
if deuterium fusion becomes a thing
of couse all our speculations go to trash
I'm not entirely sure how much Mars have uranium, but it has likely natural gas unless the methane is farted by bacteria.
we could build much larger wind plants to compensate.
gravity counteracts it
it has water
Mars is actually good for wind energy
not really
without crashing it
you can move in theory orbit by plinking a comet each 1000 year for millions of years around a planet
that could be only fixed with massive sun shades or moving the orbit (along with Earth's of course)
my point is whether Venus isn't already outside HZ for multicellural life.
I mean, the habitable zone ever moves outward, Venus is closer to Sun.
so who knows how much time limit Venus has after restoration, or if it hasn't already reached that point, which means we just restore the world for bacteria and humans living in protected habitats.
Earth will be uninhabitable for animals and plants due to the Sun brightening in 700 million years without becoming a hothouse melting metals.
Venus is well...
anyway, my main thesis is that Moon won't be industrial hub, but pretty much do things, science aside, that it can do better than Earthly counterparts in post-industrial societies or just what unique it can offer.
Tourist trap Moon is also eventually an option for lunar service economy, naturally.
Even less human labor than that.
well, that's maybe part of the science, but again, once we master that?
I think Moon actually could've been pretty much explored and administrated by robots due to lack of time lag, just keeping token staff in emergency, but otherwise Earthly engineers doing most of job.
having manned presence on Mars makes a bit more sense even if bulk of stuff done there will be done by robots, unless we want to trust AI to do the science.
Mars has better shot theoretically.
thousands maybe.
there's more interesting unique things you can do on Moon, we don't need to colonize it in millions or more for that.
I'm not obsessed, I'm just dismayed how people see Moon as resource hub while it's Earth's impoverished child in that department.
only resources
the human population will plateau naturally regardless, we won't be in need of living space.
the best question if we really need to do it.

plus I think as a country with native population of Byelarussians (USSR didn't annex the bit of Podlasie where Byelarussians are majority in current Poland) I think we have more responsibility than usual for expediting process for refugees.
Lukashenko basically killing domestic IT industry with internal sanctions, and the IT workers choosing going abroad, including to Poland. So maybe it's time for athletes?
I mean more like our Belarussian immigration doubled last year, so giving her residence permit or citizenship hardly should be out of place.
we should give her citizenship pronto

broadcasted illegally, lost bid for concession, the 1994 government raided them with SWAT teams, that didn't stop them
Polonia was actually Chad about it
since Polcast is owned by a guy from Milan
it changed hands to a different Italian though
The broadcast of common block in each of the station, received daily on VHS tapes, began each day at 16:15 and lasted till midnight. Time was filled with such productions like Japanese animated films, adventure and detective TV series (such as MacGyver, The A-Team), but first and foremost Argentinian soap operas such as Manuela, Maria, Stellina), but also movies and documentaries produced by the local communities. Remaining broadcast time was filled with either re-runs of Polonia 1, or stations' own productions. (local news, etc.). Exceptions happen from that general rule, while PTV Copernicus broadcast porn movies (in the morning hours).
Polonia 1 was sold to Polcast and now consists of lifestyle programming, teleshopping and pornography movies.

yeah
because they partly started private media (and anime) here
I need to check if Italians still own some private media
because EU isn't just one country
to me at least, because I'm not entirely either trusting of selling it to EU country. EU isn't as consistent about it as USA to me.
it remaining wholly in American hands is only guarantee of safety of the station
if they sell it, there's high risk it will go into hands of PiS loyalists
so there are pre-EU loopholes Americans can use to continue as usual, but I wouldn't put it past the gov to try to break those too

investments into the society should be sustainable instead of splurging everyone in one hurray because you live only once.
who will pay off mounting debts? Certainly not the politicos.
I thought we learned from 1970s here, but apparently not.
a welfare policy that squanders future of next generations is a bad policy.
my honest take anyway:
only then realized it works kinda like a bribe
remember that they initially only passed this because they assumed we will breed like rabbits for their trad vision of society.
my family will anyway stop receiving those bribes in few months because my sister's officially 18 very soon
we can add galloping inflation to the list of government's sins
maybe because it's better to save than consume
those bribes don't even work anymore, people now hoard them for savings instead of spending them, apparently
and I still got my disabled welfare under KO, so whatever
remember when national debt was at 30 %
I probably can underwrite my next PC as company purchase
that's why I evade those with loopholes
another consumption tax, ehh
the religious education class attendance is hovering around 1/3 right now in high schools
clearly people just don't want to go to churches, Jaros≈Çaw.
or even full time

yeah, because it has a post office inside, presumably
my neighbor had to fire part-timers who were willing to work on Sundays in order to desperately use the loopholes of owners being allowed to run shops on Sunday (which trads want to eliminate like other loopholes)
because whole close down shops shit barely affects supermarket revenue, it's the little people who get fucked.
we should bring back ZOMO, except its groceries owners armed with riot gear and beating up Catholic fundie blue collars.
SOlidarno≈õƒá after ousting Walesa be like: "We must close down all shops on Sunday because it's sin. You mean people won't attend a Latin mass rite like brainwashed lemmings if we prevent shopping?"
it's morbid irony that Solidarno≈õƒá now only cares about perpetuation of trad values in Poland, while OPPZ, originally a state union from 1980s, is taking the right side.
those who want to be bribed will screech about where is their 500+, those actually thinking rationally hopefully will recognize that ZUS is understaffed, overworked and byzantine nightmare.
but we will see true colors of society if that happens
I corrected to some, because I think only those ZUS takes care of will be halted if that happens
which will halt payment of some welfare for the time of the strike, but it's worth the try.
because the lower employees are overworked and underpaid
the civil service has been planning to go on strike eventually
after curbing hyperinflation
inflation
because we had traditionally very low
5 % inflation is actually concerning in Polish context
just, don't keep income taxes lower than in USA but consumption taxes overbearing, keep inflation in check so it doesn't eat away on what people gain, etc.
I'm not even against welfare even if I feel I've drifted right economically since my college years.

<@!203444794737950720> Do you think rad that Kukiz will have Lepper moment
Monarchy was the only symbol truly unifying the kingdom.
Afghanistan is not a nation, it's a confederacy of tribes and ethnicities.
And most importantly, he was pretty competent, the reason he was ousted in first place is because he had to take health trip to Italy.
Zahir was a popular monarch representing to many people nostalgia for better times, especially since he was ousted by people who proceeded to start the decline of Afghanistan.
It was pretty clear what NATO and UN should've done, but they missed even that.
the moral here is that we should have either not enter Afghanistan or reinstate Zahir Shah.
Chinese evacuating that fast also sends the African strongmen a message "Oh, so Xi won't bail us out when insurrectionists in our countries ever gain upper hand."
There's some irony in Dengist wannabe client dictator getting btfo'd by Hoxhaist militia.
And they're basically evacuating the """""advisors"""""" they sent the guy because there are rumours, true or not, that Tigray militias are decapitating Chinese nationals they find.
The dictator they invested into as lynchpin of their Horn of Africa strategy is collapsing before world's eyes.
Also the five cent bots absolutely love pointing to Afghanistan because China's having their own foreign adventure blowing up into the face.
The problem Chinese have is that their 'wolf diplomacy' moments started finally making the neighboring region think whether they want to tie their interests with China.
when I use trains, I also think of how much time it will take
I'm both car and train boy.
it's one hour away tells me subjectively more than it's x kms away
wdym, hours and minutes are easier to grasp, tbh.
The difference though is that their military is actually competent because they've been forged in fires of war with Ethiopia, and cronyism and political favoritism haven't kicked in to the extent in other similar dictatorships.
It's possibly one of few countries that match or even exceed North Korea in terms of totalitarianism, Turkmenistan being the other contender.
Eritrea is damn overlooked by media.
because well, they have only limited resources, their m.o. is to just delay collapse enough they can buy time for bracing for Afar and Tigray tensions along their border, realpolitik baby.
And I think they will eventually plug the pull
Eritrean's dictatorship must be super smug now, their junta's "policing forces" is only competent fighting force on Ethiopia's side.
Ethiopian dictator was like. "Hmm, after receiving the Noble Peace Prize for making amends with Eritrea I will commit a genocide in Tigray, who will stop me?... Wait, no, oh god, oh fuck, stop routing my troops, noo, I beg you, unilateral ceasefire, no, Sudan, don't back them, I didn't mean the dam project, come on, Eritrea, please save me."
I meant the wannabes
because they emulated Xi's gamer moments rather than trying to continue detente with everyone around like someone inspired by Jiang Zemin.
Ethiopia tried to model itself more on China until it turned out they are fucking it up.
China serves as inspiration and morale boost to wannabes who think they can make it as easily. So far they often fuck up though, thank God.
Germany is a democracy, that doesn't stop them from sucking up to autocrats like Putin for economic benefits. Yet they're definitely more aligned with that philosophy of ruling.
I mean in the sense that they're going to be more aligned with democratic philosophy of ruling than the Chinese's model of chauvinistic authocratic politics.
A thing we didn't expect, and if somehow Taliban thaws that way, I will eat a tomato.
Sudan went from Talib tier in many ways to secularising semi-authoritarian state wanting to make amends with its past.
All things going well, they will be positive influence hopefully.
And I think Sudan is ultimately more on our side, because they're genuinely reforming to be better without fucking it up at every difficult milestone thus far.
because Sudan made itself a rational actor willing to flex more muscle there.
From academic perspective I'm more interested in Horn of Africa
We live in 'interesting' times.
just points more to my belief that exploiting Afghanistan's resources will be a Great Game China isn't necessarily bound to win or monopolize access to Afghanistan even in case of victory.
Also I wonder what India will do, they absolutely despise China, but also have tried to build relations there.
In Horn of Africa, they managed to make relations with assorted Somali factions colder by being too pushy, and backed the president of Ethiopia instead. Probably curse under the breath for backing all along less stable faction.
there won't be a large scale war as there hasn't been in ASEAN nor Horn of Africa, but I don't expect China to just charm everyone involved without fucking it up with some of sides.
And treading carefully is not what I expect much these days from 'wolf warriors'.
Considering Russia keeps their embassy there, it might signal even more China will have to share influence. And of course I mentioned Pakistan exactly because Pakistan is greedy about investments and attention too, they will have to tread carefully.
yeah, but they're going to be careful where they send technicians in
Any blunder discrediting him or his potential groomed successor gives more chance for dovier factions in China to reassert control over the central committee.
Xi thinks he is a hot shit, but he's intellectual inferior to Jiang Zemin and Hu Jintao era detentists.
Personally, let them have at it. Distracts them from Africa more.
Also if China wants to build sphere of influence there, good luck. Not just are they going to be torn between supporting Pakistan and Afghanistan, the other -stans are pretty on alert now, and they will have to court Russia too.
Pakistan wants to keep their Pashtun lands inside their own country and have been seeing Afghanistan as threat to their security since their very origins.
Pakistan's motive for supporting Taliban was to keep Afghanistan weak. They won't change this. The moment Taliban becomes too consolidated for Pakistan tastes, it's "good morning babe, time for another Pakistan backed insurrection group." hour.
And they are also currently weeding out Taliban in their own country (better late than never) because Taliban of Pakistan started blowing up Chinese technicians.
I talked with Pakistanis, the government's mood is generally of disappointment, because they wanted to drag this out.
And Pakistan will absolutely turn on them if they manage to keep things afloat.
yes, but there can be another one.
time for Pakistan to turn on them
Also if Taliban actually succeeds, well
I also pretty much expect Taliban to engage into civil war at first major misstep, since they're not exactly loved. It's more like many people are tired, and certainly many has been trying to flee them.
also they're still religious Sunni fanatics, that dogma might hamper them from not trying to poke Hazara around. Iran almost went to war with Talibs in 1990s, I say I will support Iran having their own try to distract Iran from their foreign adventurism elsewhere.
I don't believe a tiger can easily change their stripes.
I will believe when I see it, but they're certainly not guaranteed to be rational actors.
when Talibs were previously in power, they tried to yeet Hazara and local Tajiks
and calling Pashtuns a nation itself might be stretch, since they have their internal cultural subdivisions.
who are like 40 %
Pashtun Nationalists
my current question is whether Sudan as a backer of rebels will serve as moderating voice of the Marxists are not subject to pressure.
We don't know if Tigray-Oromo alliance (who surprisingly buried the hatchet against common enemy) wants to rule Ethiopia after kicking out the current government, or Ethiopia will proceed to Balkanize.
Keep watch closely on Ethiopia.
and we will have to nation build as international community in some manner in the future. Ethiopia is collapsing and I imagine the humanitarian toll will be staggering.
The *general* reason here is that UN and NATO should abandon strict dogmatism about Western liberal democratic patterns and install anyone who is popular yet reform minded. The shah was a figure more akin to semi-constitutional monarchs of Quwait and Morocco, yet this model would've worked the best out of options available in 2002.
Taiwan's morale is high, determined and they have been preparing for desperate defense since 1949
also oh boy, do I hate Afghanistan comparison.
if Xi thinks he can occupy Taiwan without Taiwan going full scorched earth on China, he's again proven to be one of dumbest Chinese leaders in history.

He also got caught by Taliban group who didn't know him from 4chan but didn't know what Wales was and let him out.
surely he was insane to begin with to go into Kabul, but he joined protecting other civilians, so certainly a good man.
Miles justifiably acquired assault rifle and joined in protecting the airport as auxiliary until he got evacuated
the new government discontinued that, but did nothing meaningful to prevent victimhood, and about over 5 thousands officials in the government and army were under suspicion of practing it.
what Taliban did in this case in 1990s was to ban it under penalty of death, but levy the capital punishment against the victims.
there's a thing among more traditional elements (but officially not under Taliban, but practice vs theory moment) where relations between older males and young men, even boys, is considered a-ok like in ancient Greece.
Bacha Bazi moment
because one of 4chan users was from Taliban and wanted to turn him into sex slave
the craziest part about it that Taliban tried to use 4chan to track him
very old story, older than many people here, because Taliban became a thing in mid 1990s.
the group that hosted the group that did 9/11, got defeated in conventional war, resurged more than a decade later and now seized majority of Afghanistan, including the capital.

it's for now Tajiks who form core of Panjshir Valley army, but Saleh's rhetoric is anti-Pakistani rather than for any ethnic group.
nature doesn't like vacuum
anyway, Twitter pundits who thought it was already over were wrong
I don't think that's enough to defeat Taliban in any timefrome other than very long, but from my realist perspective, it might occupy some of CSTO attention there and so less focus on Ukraine.
critical support for CSTO and India backed Tajiks giving Taliban some hell
also turns out the new President of remnant gov has also ties to Modi and Hindutva organizations
ex-ANA Tajik soldiers crossed the border with APCs and tanks
if my country got blatantly attacked like this on such scale, I'd also want some justice.
that's more than enough territory to declare a state if you beat off everyone having issue with that
doesn't seem much on first glance, but Nigeria is huge.
this was maximum BK territory
but I hope that was enough for now.
I can't possibly cover anything in full detail because it's a complex subject giving more learned people headaches
not to the point they used to be, but can't be dismissed
BH was on last ropes in 2019, but resurged
some affiliated groups like Boko Haram though are still potent as regular forces.
they're more similar to Al Quaeda than Taliban in many areas
so basically a terrorist group rather than a warlord group now, with different nature.
and is just informal collection of seperate groups using the name like a franchise

well, shame we don';t have nuclear weapons, screw non-profileration.
that wargame organized by PiS assumed we'd beat them off as if it was 1920 again
assuming no NATO involvement
yes
this is also why we should go full Robespierre on the government if they permanently damage relations with everyone, rad.
we're sitting by fucking Kaliningrad, we're dust without NATO help.
I don't want see my coutnry enslaved again by despots from Moscow.
if Taiwan falls and nothing happens to China, it will signal to other ambitious autocracies that you can attack countries guaranteed by USA without consequences, and it'd be grave thing for me.
I'm probabyl scared by this situation
it's a desperate move of desperate people about to lose everything, whenever it's discussed.
that's why it's called Samson Option
I guess Three Georges Dam operation would be unthinkable, but the situation would be unthinkable for Taiwan if it got to that.
the imperative is to make bait and MAD impossible, and scare them with pre-emptively scare with similar MAD in worst case scenario.
Taiwan is in no position
well, Chinese would try bait and MAD
"Sir, those helicopter destroyers who carry F-35 and are the size of carriers are just destroyers, what do you mean. F35 is a helicopter, don't you understand it's VTOL like them."
Japanese be like
there's reasonable chance Japanese on their own would be challenge for People's Liberation Navy
if USA and Japanese navy mobilize, there's no way China wins sea warfare to get to island basically
anyway, that grim scenario assumed Taiwan being alone, this scenario assumes Xi gets nuclear happy in worst case scenario because he cannot punch through Japanese and US navy to get into Taiwan.
and he'd just piss off the world into ending his regime.
I wonder if he's rational enough to realize that USA would take heavy beating from Chinese first strike, but not civilization crushing.
iether Xi would fuck off or go into history as potentially worse madman than the one who started WW2
war with Taiwan should mean war with USA and its allies
I will only feel at peace if we massively reinforce Taiwan
less than 100 Western soldiers died since 2014.
if Xi feels emboldened by Afghanistan debacle, than maybe we should've stayed even more years
also honestly, that makes me thing
Remember Taiwan, like South Korea, used to be authoritarian states who killed many in white terror, the reverse of progress under Xi just feels frustrating when I look at Taiwan.
Damn, I hate Xi Jingping so much I will keep repeating myself. Why CCP had to radicalize after some progress, other Chinese and partly Chinese states like Taiwan and Singapour are going the better direction consistently.
I'd even be okay with older CCP getting North Korea to disarm and take their nukes.
China actually would've been more reasonable actor under previous administration, did Hu Jintao and Jiang Zemin did the same shit as Xi? Nothing like this would be a topic under people like them.
but there are countries who don't need certainly nukes other than blackmail, like North Korea, because *no one* wants to attack North KOrea. Not even hawkiest South Koreans want to deal with the mess of reconstruction.
I think complete nuclear disarmament would lead to another World War
I'm saying MAD should be actually followed up on if someone ignores consequences. That's what keeps peace, unless Xi proves to be even more megalomaniacal madman than his wolf diplomacy approach shows him to be.
better than doing nothing, I also won't talk about bombing Nazis I guess since we won't agree.
yes, it's a Samson option for a reason, just final screw you, we're not going out with a whimper.
they'd anyway set up laogais in Taiwan and crush democracy and all progress gained by that small country.
because my country faced actualy existential threats at least two times.
mining international waters would've had worse impact
currently Chinese themselves closed down some ports due to delta, which is predicted to have global impact comparable to Evergreen getting stuck for long time.
mining the ports will make it already more costly for China than whatever profit they have from seizing Taiwan.
I don't think it will get to the stage of Taiwan targetting most vulnerable mainland land infrastructure with missiles.
only thing Taiwan could hurt CHina more in absolutely blackest scenario would be acquisition of nuclear weapons.
That's why they're stocking up on missile cruisers and leaking those ideas that Three Georges Dam is one of targets. They also have plan to mine the Chinese ports and paralysie global economy.
Taiwan's trying to look first like a poisonous animal, being colorful and threathening looking, but also have venom for the worst case situation.
I believe in Samsoning existential threats to a country when my country is about to lose. All those plans to breach the dam and make invasion a bloodbath for mainlanders are meant to give pause Chinese leadership about full-scale war, but if they get implemented, then I won't condemn Taiwan on following on their warning.

guy had already wealth that made him comfortably rich, but invested surplus into scamming monsters and taking high cuts from streamers.
and now he can pull plug since he grinded himself from being millionaires' son to a billionaire.
but also has lower moral restraints than average shady investor, in general, the minor problem of OF didn't phase him beyond just token gestures.
though as I said, he wasn't directly involved in the content, """"just"""" scammed horrible people.
OnlyFans has run into its own issues with underage performers. Since the site doesn‚Äôt independently verify its sex workers‚Äô ages, it‚Äôs fairly easy for people to lie. In late May, a BBC investigation revealed that a 14-year-old girl had been able to register an account as a performer on OnlyFans using her grandmother's passport. A senior police officer told the BBC that OnlyFans is ‚Äú[N]ot doing enough to put in place the safeguards that prevent children exploiting the opportunity to generate money, but also for children to be exploited." In response, OnlyFans issued a statement that it used ‚Äústate-of-the-art technology‚Äù and ‚Äúhuman monitoring‚Äù to try to prevent under-18s sharing content on the platform and it took the issue ‚Äúvery seriously.‚Äù

Signy Arnason, associate executive director of The Canadian Center for Child Protection, says her group often receives notifications about OnlyFans‚Äô models potentially being underage. She describes OnlyFans‚Äô efforts to protect underage performers as ‚Äúminimal.‚Äù OnlyFans has ‚Äúa moral and ethical responsibility to be doing better here,‚Äù she adds.
In 2003 and 2004, Amazon and Microsoft sued Radvinsky in U.S. district court in Seattle for alleged spam campaigns that used the Amazon name and Microsoft email tools to offer spam recipients ‚Äúfree money from the government‚Äù or links to adult websites. Radvinsky denied all allegations. The cases were settled out of court in 2005, and Radvinsky and his businesses were barred from using Amazon‚Äôs name in spam or using any of Microsoft‚Äôs email tools.
so if we give him benefit of doubt, he scammed horrible people, but also the fact he went for such scam rather than for more sfw one already says volumes about his attitude to life.
Instead, the sites appear to have been a way for Radvinsky to earn money by charging his partners (actual porn sites) for every click. Forbes, prohibited from accessing such imagery, asked the Internet Watch Foundation (IWF), a specialist group engaged in the removal of such content on the web, to look at archived webpages containing links advertising underage pornography. According to the IWF, none linked to illegal material.
on another hand
well, fuck, it's worse than I thought, not just 16 year olds but well, zoophile pandering stuff, I'd put it mildly.
What little else is known about Radvinsky is not flattering. Some twenty years ago, before Internet pornography was widely available for free, he ran a small empire of websites that advertised access to ‚Äúillegal‚Äù and ‚Äúhacked‚Äù passwords to porn sites, including ones that were advertised as featuring underage performers. In the late 1990s such link sites were common and were used to market not just pornography but online gambling and other grey market activities.
and he for 1000 % invested his new money into back up ventures.
the owner probabyl doesn't cry over losing Only Fans, it helped him become billionaire
so they'd implode over something else, whether the owner's sus stuff coming to light with definite proof or streamers leaving it once greener pasture showed up.
the owner has shady ties, and the company took ever bigger cut of streamer revenue.
I don't cry over Only Fans being gone.
yes, but I don't know, maybe the owners made calculations that applying verification stuff would cost them and discourage people anyway.
only allow streaming of dad bod and MILF streamers in 40s.
the golden solution
Clearly
I don't have source on hand, but that what I was told by some people.
so they pulled plug instead.
I heard they didn't want to police whether the porn streamers are adult or not.
Rap music apparently is.
also while I'm against platforming Taliban at all, someone I sadly know (self-declared Shining Pather who happens to dislike Taliban) is tweeting their verified spokesman, and I will see how much he gainst their trust, because the spokesman already started giving him questions to answers like whether music is banned.
https://twitter.com/ClayTravis/status/1428149499474726917 at least this one twitter is conclusive on what Taliban think about their claims to the international public, since it's direct interview.
other maybe than bursts of resistance to Talibs, but that's very obvious and local measure of mood.
Nobody does surveys, hence we have no source.
I don't think we should glean mood from social media infamous for disinfo accounts pretending to be people, and regulars representing small share of societies to begin with. It's hard to take information about concrete at face value without linking to several sources, and opinions of online people are not a random sample comparable in quality to a reasonably competent survey group.
is that as credible as second hand reference to a guy who might not exist beyond Twitter that you posted.
>Twitter
do you have surveys actually proving what they think of him
it feels like I'm being baited into supporting either of one in super hypothetical situation when I'm firmly for the Second Resistance.
we have actual option
that's why I'm for whoever wants to support Saleh, even CSTO and Modi, to give as much support they want.
none.
Also I have nothing concrete other than some rumours to make me doubt about Saleh's and Massoud's hardline stance towards Taliban. Saleh absolutely roasted Karzai for trying to Neville for Taliban back in 2011 (and since he now is a Quisling in """"interim"""" government, I hope ANA hangs him from a cannon of a tank if they find him) and got attacked by extremists in assassination attempts, including this month. Massoud claims anti-Taliban legacy of his father. If they went for a peace and autonomous deal with Taliban, their legitimacy would be absolutely ruined. Even if lots of that rhetoric wasn't idealistic and was political bid to cement power, out of pragmatic reasons they will continue fighting even if they stalemate and that becomes frozen conflict.
I don't think we should treat ISIS-K as successor considering their ambitions. CSTO and Iran support are virtually impossible since they lay official claim to Kirgistan and Tajikistan now.
deserving those knife warheads from drones (to avoid civilian casualties)
they are both a bunch of psychopaths
you mean guys sandwiched between Iran and Taliban and not enjoying as much support potentially as Saleh? I don't know how possible that is.
Taliban as legal government would get onto commissions protecting women's rights and historical monuments, pure joke.
because they will make UN more of a joke
my stance right: help refugees, sabotage Taliban as much as we can, and never let UN recognize them
greater Tajikistan is better partial outcome than anything like Taliban seizing whole control over Afghanistan region
CSTO maybe will pull off little green men moment and just have Tajiks dismember Afghanistan
well, my hope is that he doesn't win
also original ANA reclaimed them with heavy casualties, that's the difference I think this time
that's one of strong sources for those news
https://pajhwok.com/
gonna check @OsintUpdates
https://twitter.com/HSajwanization/status/1428733003719659527?s=19
I've seen it on twitter yeah, but this was accompanied by photos and recordings, and retweets of concrete sources, so that's easier to verify at least
resistance reclaimed three districts
anyway, news
because I put in Tahir Khan, and get athletes, professors with different looks, and the twitter account
but I can't find info on him outside twitter page, which makes me thing how reliable that source is
he routes to this person
https://t.co/xqZNw1pSxQ
that'd be useful, I mean, I verified the info about ANA tanks crossing across Tajikistan from non-Western outlet, I don't have any particular preference for location as long as it's not a site with record for fake news.
and what kind organization the journalist is working beyond being vague Islamabad journalist?
and he didn't bother to reply and give source
Clarify - Taliban in talks with 
@AhmadMassoud01
 and 
@AmrullahSaleh2
 ? Do you have a reliable source for that?
I mean the Tahir Khan tweet
trying to equate Talib level discrimination with much saner conservative countries for example, lots of pro-Talibs replies, and anti-war narratives claiming peace would magically heal Afghanistan, only one rational person asking "do you have source for that?"
lmao, some replies under that tweet
I input his surname and I get several people from Pakistan with his surname and name.
also I don't know how to trust info from someone on whom I can't find info beyond existence of Twitter account
Saleh would've been idiot to agree
ANA has 8.000-15.000 fighters now, but concentrated in much smaller area, while Talibs need to use their 75.000 to police the area they seized.
though seems the fighting is also over important Hindukush Pass
since CSTO and/or India and/or other interested parties could supply them practically freely, limited by flights.
if Bagram falls to ANA, it might be one of game changers
those returning from Central Asia and fighting their way through Afghanistan are the competent, high morale core.
because those who didn't want to fight fled
in better shape than before fall of Kabul
I think now ANA is unironically
once Ghani fled in ignomy and his more competent deputy and a son of popular general rallied troops, things have not been going 100 % in favor of Taliban.
seems to me like btw the war is far from over
and Uzbeks
also Panshjir resistance is being reinforced a lot by Tajiks and Hazaras
if militias flipped to Taliban, then some probably feel mugged by reality.
Professor Maley said the destruction of the Mazari statue had ‚Äúraised the temperature‚Äù in another pocket of strong anti-Taliban sentiment. ‚ÄúThat kind of event is deeply symbolic and I think it rapidly does away with any sense that the Taliban are going to be gentle. I suspect there are still a lot of arms in the Hazara camp. There can be strength in numbers if the Taliban end up provoking some sort of incident.‚Äù
they're also back to their mindless vandalism spree
I have no paywall
"In central Bamiyan, the home to the mostly Shia Hazara ethnic tribe, Taliban fighters have also provoked community anger after blowing up the statue of Abdul Ali Mazari, a leader who fought against the Taliban during ¬≠Afghanistan‚Äôs civil war in the 1990s. As pictures of the destroyed statue circulated on social media on Wednesday, some drew comparisons to the Taliban‚Äôs destruction of the sixth-century Buddhas of Bamiyan, a UNESCO-listed ¬≠national treasure, in March 2001.

Mazari, a champion of Afghanistan‚Äôs ethnic Hazara minority, was killed by the Taliban in 1996, when the armed group seized power from rival militias."

and I call him Shining Pather because well, he's actually unironically talking about supporting the ideology using lingo that Shining Path sympathisers use üò¨
I don't like my source, in fact we don't like each other, but that's direct probing for Taliban, even if that's cynical thing he's doing to score brownie points for his journalist ambitions.

my classmate did apostasy, but his family was so deep in JW rabbit hole that his only choice was leaving Poland and starting life overseas far away from relatives.
I live in town with JWs, so the treatment of "apostates" is known. They basically leave you without support network as all your relatives who are JWs pretend you don't exist anymore.
though definitely they're not any as bad as Jehowa's Witnesses about their practices and treatment of people sticking out like a nail, JWs are much more extreme offshoot of Protestantism in comparison.
the evangelism puts me off, that's why I compare them to JWs.
majority of their membership are gentiles, so they naturally are bothering everyone they think might have Jewish roots to bolster their legitimacy
No Jewish organization recognizes them as Jews and they are pretty insecure about having to wear crosses when they are chaplains in US military.
Messianic Jews are a sect created by ex-Jewish Baptist who wanted to have both a cake and eat it.
tldr
oh no, *they* are here already, as we didn't have enough sects like JWs.

a woman jailed in Czechia for corruption charges, back in her country

few MEP wackjobs elected for memes aside
lots of MEP actually have to work for being elected.
this set up discourages merit and breeds nepotism
and Euro Commission is basically a dumping ground for retired politicians and B-list technocrats who can't get Chancellorship/Prime Ministership/major economy related ministry
since Euro Parliament gets constantly denied room for taking on more responsibilities
but without any real democratic supervision
is how bureaucratic it is
anyway, my main concern about EU
so they will try to make absolutely efficient fossil fuel cars just like they still don't resign from fax, pagers and stationary phones at workplaces, even when electric cars are the new vogue.
they strive for efficiency, but also don't like much change
classic Japan
to being most conservative about electric cars
since they went from most eco friendly car industry

Canada already engaged into Karen mode when negotiating for TPP to protect its car industry
I don't see serious halt of relative economic decline of EU unless we conjoin ourselves to NAFTA. But again probably lots of excessive regulation would've been scrapped and institutions be reformed, on both sides tbh.
because they just express strong concerns about the fiasco with Byelarussian border
that one is a bit of inconsistent farce
NAFTA has giant pool of its own developing world workers, EU is running out of that advantage as EE has less room to grow before they become developed (Poland and czechia is already developed)
not just because its own economic growth, but because Mexican market grows in spite of its institutional hurdles
USA will maintain its relative share in economy despite Africa and Asia rising in share.
NAFTA actually looking pretty good, in comparison.
read a book outlining projections by 2100

so basically white dwarfs are... not so dead stars as we imagined them to be.
Comparing their results with computer simulations of stellar evolution in M13, the researchers were able to show that roughly 70% of the white dwarfs in M13 are burning hydrogen on their surfaces, slowing down the rate at which they are cooling. The hydrogen would have been supplied by the star‚Äôs outer shells leaking into space.

I don't want even more De Gaullism in European defense policies.

back when Labour was socialist.
also NATO was co-founded by socialists
because it'd disrupt logistics of NATO
Germany leaving NATO would've been literal stab in the back.
anyway, I don't look on anti-NATO sentiments kindly since NATO is like the one thing that stands between Russia and its Central-Eastern European NATO neighbors.

Die Linke basically act like glowies but in red now, and Scholz at least told them to cut it or they won't get any near any coalition.
though SPD is btfoing both outside their turfs by appropriating the Ostalgie.
Both Die Linke and AfD are the same cursed byproducts of Eastern Germany
I just hope at this point Greens will be in coalition to push their environmentalism rather than same old SPD/CDU coalition.
and the nuclear will be sooner built by private investors than any of possible governments
just increase gas from non-Russian sources, and some renewables encouraged by subsidies I don't qualify for so I'm forced to use natural gas.
there's no plans really in Poland to cut the coal
we're the Australia of Europe in that regard
of course, to be fair, I hate my country's renewable policy too
short-sighted and short-term thinking
within next two decades, natural gas will take the place of coal as most pollutiing source of energy, and yet we're building more pipelines to Russia and Azerbeijan.
I also hate how EU basically is passing dead on arrival natural gas regulations since there's no way we're gonna to enforce the standards about gas-leakage to Gasprom.
Schroeder should've been rotting in jail instead of enjoying his cosy position on Gazprom board.
maybe, but I have reason to dislike German establishment.
sorry to break you, but it isn't.
Climate too.
Germany have no excuse about their lackluster decarbonization compared to UK for example, they're the biggest economy in Europe and should be in the vanguard.
Plus Russia is pretty much using natural gas as political tool.
SPD/CDU policy towards Russia increases imports of gas from company who can't be policed about environmental standards while they also denuclearized without cutting lignite in significant manner.
and Greens are good about it, so I want the map to be Green. I just care about some issues first.
since those impact things outside German border.
but I don't give a shit about that in Germany. I give shit about climate and foreign policy.
For Eastern Europe? Major issue.
and tbh SPD is gaining in East Germany because Scholz is Ossie and playing mild social conservatism and Ostalgie card.
SPD did Nordstream 1, Merkel Nordstream 2.
CDU and SPD have roughly same lackluster FoPo about Putin and Nordstream.
SPD is same shit from my POV, tbh
wtf Saxony, you keep getting worse.

Like, in *theory* black citizens had more rights to vote than in South Africa, but the extreme gerrymandering and voter suppression that would make 1950s Deep South blush negated it all.
As my historian friend put it, Rhodesia had less de iure discrimination than South Africa, but were very radical and harsh about manipulating what power structures they could leverage, so their level of repression was equal to South Africa's.
Rhodie elites were so de facto repressive that it wasn't some promised land for whites either.
what I learned today is that Rhodesia deported a group of white archeologists for saying that Old Zimbabwean ruins were built by Bantu. <:agony:770602780528345108>

British MP got stabbed, presumably to death according to recent rumors.
I don't find anything offensive about his legislative legacy
Amess sponsored many parliamentary bills.[10] Two of his most significant achievements are the Protection Against Cruel Tethering Act (1988),[11] and the Warm Homes and Energy Conservation Act (2000),[12] both of which are on the statute book in his name. In 2014, he successfully piloted the Security Printing (Specialist) Materials Bill onto the Statute Book. This Bill ended a loophole which allowed companies who supplied specialist printing equipment to counterfeiters to evade prosecution.

In 2016, he successfully steered onto the statute book the Driving Instructors (Registration) Bill. This Bill streamlines the process whereby instructors whose registration has lapsed can apply to return to the register. It also allows instructors who wish to leave the register for personal reasons to do so without being penalised. The Bill was supported by driving school owners and motoring organisations.
his biggest success
Warm Homes and Energy Conservation Act 2000
Amess' most publicised legislative success came in 2000 with the Warm Homes and Energy Conservation Act. According to a speech in the House of Commons made by Amess, the Act came to fruition after he was drawn out of the Private Members Ballot.[14] He met with Martyn Williams, a campaigner from Friends of the Earth, who convinced him of the need for the Act following on from the death of a constituent in a cold house.[14]

The Act required the Secretary of State to "publish and implement a strategy for reducing fuel poverty".[15] This Act was widely credited with a significant change in both attitude and policy towards fuel poverty within the UK.[16] The scale of fuel poverty in England fell from 5.1 million households to 1.2 million households between 1996 and 2004, indicating the impact of the Act.[16]

is someone proves to be safe to parole after 20 years or so, they have chance of being released due to good behavior and the progress they made (or if they are so ill they are not dangerous anymore, there's humanitarian argument for releasing really old people after they did their sentence honestly).
life punishment also has a room for parole, and hopefully with rehabilitation applied as prerequisite to any attempt for parole.
because capital punishment has very steep legal costs on top of execution that happens after decades anyway
plus there's pragmatic argument that life is cheaper than capital.
I believe that Norwegians are trying to loophole to keep Breivik indefinite in containment, but hasn't reformed the upper sentencing limit yet
I don't advocate for capital punishment here, but well, murders happen in every society, you need have life imprisonment to fall back on.
Varg burned several churches and murdered Euronymus, his band colleague.
for petty criminals it might work out very well, but they need to formally increase the highest penalty to life imprisonment for cases like Varg
guy stabbed a guy to death methodically, got a joke of 20-something sentence because Norwegians abolished life penalty (the biggest flaw of their system) and then released him on good behavior despite the fact that he escaped prison and stocked supplies for suspected arson.
Varg being allowed loose is a joke
fine in principle, but Nordic system has flaws, like being too lenient towards murderers.
well, if we leave EU, don't expect PiS to survive. Literally.
the opposition better reorganize the highest courts from ground up and file charges for all counts of corruption they can find.
I don't think my country will survive another PiS comeback, it's always getting worse with each iteration
they should use every instrument to emasculate PiS if they ever regain control, and if EU will have problem with that, to hell with them, we could just ignore the scolding.

I'd only start cutting welfare if I were in gov's shoes if the situation didn't show signs of improvement, but I'd do it if I had to, like the child subsidies that stopped fueling consumerism meaningfully and started fueling inflation (and never increased birth rate).
if SOEs can't survive without babysitting, it's on them too.

But my beef here is that you assume that capitalism here is Gilded Cage model of 1880s USA
Hed hope those feudalism = capitalism comments were ajoke

So only capitalism is lasseiz fairism.

My shoulder Lenin is reminding me about Kautsky, my battery meter is warning me to disengage  more effectively
But at least you concede its not entirely serious claim, I think.
You are describing tendency for civilization to develop their overclasses. A socialist system of Soviet Russia developed nomenklatura. Are they really the same as capitalism? Their economy wasnt driven primaly between interplay of state and market forces. They were producerist command economy.
I can analyze feudalism vs capitalism within my own country and prove the socioeconomic conditions were vastly different
Anyone can make claims but then one has to back them.

like increasing interest rates, increasing taxation, curbing military spending (by pushing for quality instead of quantity tbh), rationalizing some of subsidies and welfare (our insurance system is infamously bloated and understaffed).
we can get out of inflationary spiral in many ways that don't necessitate fiddling with currency
we cut taxes at the same time many times
"too high welfare and military spending *relatively to lowering tax revenue.*"
Inflation here is not driven by the central bank and currency certainly, but by too high welfare and military spending relatively to lowering tax revenue.
I do agree though inflation within few percents (certainly not 7 % of my country) is the most optimal.
deflation can be worse
and main gains of Hitler happened in the turn of 1930s (and he started losing seats one some signs of recovery kicked in)

I've read about Weimar, it was a confluence of too many factors to just list in one sentence.

Clinging to golden standard prolonged recession for many 1930s countries who chose to do so. Your point?
normal currency can be already volatile enough
you're not gonna get beyond level of Russian peasant commune.

Why crypto boom strained coal energy grids and crypto companies have been known to renovate coal plants.
I'm a capitalist. I think market exchanges are a great thing, but they should be as safe as non-volatile as possible.
Unless you can point me to cheap, renewable energy being adopted worldwide any soon, crypto will remain very inefficient sinkhole of energy compared to use of paper money and regular banking.
it's a problem created by spiking demand.

I'd also like the modern economic system to have a back up analogue plan.
since it's so energy inefficient
we could certainly use the energy for crypto overall better
But certainly crypto's current ailments are nothing new. We've seen people getting hyped about new thing of a century and losing lots of money in process many times. The chief issue though is that
still less volatile than crypto now, and nothing reassures me that situation will change in comparison. Whole crypto craze is not even decade old.
I remember when people took Swiss Franc's stability for granted, invested lots of money backed by loans in Francs, and then after decades the whole equilibrium changed.

After public outrage and perspective of losing their voting base, they meekly dropped that big brain backroom shit.
There was some stupid attempt of the leftists to secure some secret welfare deal with the conservatists seasons ago
For me the left party is only valuable insofar as they cooperate with the opposition in unison.
for example, on one side Natcons ~~dogwhistle~~ openly rant about Islamic refugee threat while Chrisdems couch pro-refugee manifestations in notions of Christian compassion, like the Saint Martin's parade this year.
you can't get far in Poland without lip service to Catholic culture, but the thing is that the opposition has been naturally interpreting Christianity different than conservatism
for all intents and purposes the centre-left party is in electoral pact with the Christian Democrat party
my country has Christian Democratic vs national conservatist struggle

the most realpolitik thing is how Soviet Union and WarPac supplied Israel against Arabs in 1950s then changed tone under Breznev.

Still, they managed what Egypt failed to do i.e. carve their own empire in Africa in equal race with European powers, and even the aid offered by Russian Empire in form of instruction and supplies wouldn't be enough if the leadership wasn't efficient and competent in its own despotic way.
Ethiopia came to be and resisted Italian incursions in 1890s thanks to force of arms, but force of arms haven't worked out to keep all conquered ethnicities content with the situation.
then Derg came with their own brand of whacky dictatorship
It was basically own imperialistic project of Solomonid dynasty and lack of social reforms over generations didn't make situation better to put it mildly.
Tbh Ethiopia like Yugoslavia was bound to eventually collapse, now that I think about it.
Some technicians got withdrawed over rumors that Tigray and Oromo militia are killing Chinese nationals they find
Chinese put most money into Ethiopia which isn't doing too hot now because the guy they backed had genocidal moment he miscalculated
African's own initiatives are working out better, tbh.
and right now they're trying similar tactics as France still tries to do, so in current context they're pretty shitty too
They were busy at the time doing genocides in Central Asia, so I'd loathe to use China as example
implying Chinese wouldn't do the same if they could Scramble in 19th century
it doesn't but people still keep pointing mainly to the West for about anything bad happening down there.
Nelson was being told that it was only a war to depose destabilizing dictator and peacekeeping efforts would ensue afterwards
The 'funny' thing about First Congo War is how even some more pacific African leaders like Mandela endorsed the war initially because Rwanda lied through teeth about the motives.
the largest war in their history was waged by Africans against Africans out of African-centred motives and for example some corporations only started benefiting as byproduct of the ongoing hostitilities rather than having any direct involvement (the sides in Congo Wars discovered mining coltane was quickest way to fund militia's activities)
By no means though Africans are just reacting passively to the world outside
I'd say it's France, India and China who are flexing their muscles more than nebulous umbrella term West combined.
Though Tanzanians are experiencing EastoAfricoskeptic sentiments, Tanxit anyone?
East African Confederation is gonna be a common market of hundreds of millions people just like EU once everything's wrapped up.
I think lots of people underestimate Africans and their agency in improving themselves (like East African region doing EU like thing on their own) or worsening their lot (Ethiopia going down the drain overwhelmingly thanks to their government's decisions).

it took us centuries to understand disease spread enough, and only because centuries after some one citizen scientist guy had a whim to repurpose telescopes to observe smaller things a talented microbiologist put everything together.
and in case of pre-modern times, poor understanding of the epidemic
logistical and political problem
though like "avoided Black Death" in this case meant "some people died, not apocalyptic 1/3 dead people levels"
But no continent can coordinate common joint anti-pandemic action, even today sadly.
Poland only avoided Black Death due to extreme measures that would be decried today as human rights breaches.
History teaches us in general that epidemics are hard to stop once they get going
Abenaki didn't want to touch white merchants because they were smelly (they ordered to dump goods at special sites of exchange), but they didn't have the same prejudice to people they considered civilized.
If the smallpox started with Abenaki, it'd spread to Midwest they traded with (actually they got it from Midwest merchants first).
because the regions were interconnected with trade networks
smallpox largely reached majority of native civilizations ahead of Euros
when Portuguese visited Abenaki, they marvelled why:
1) they had swords and glass from Venetia
2) why they mooned at them (Abenaki developed stereotype of white people being unwashed because they basically interacted with 15th century equivalent of Norf FC)
You know, the tragic thing is that the pandemic in America was probably inevitable even if there was no colonialism, because we know that Bristol fishermen and petty merchants traded on their own with locals, some day some outbreak would happen.
hence he for example knew that trick with burying fish to fertilize soil
Tisquanto worked as a butler at an English rural noble's estate for five years
the natives actually knew European farming techniques because they interacted with Portuguese and British before, and Pilgrims were urbanites who had no clue how rural England worked.
Now here's the real funny twist
This was despite lack of metalworking
the natives of future New England were also better at constructing small boats.
And the diet of the natives was more nutritious.
European marvelled in accounts how the housing construction techniques of the People of the First Light were superior to England in terms of keeping heat inside.
the contact between native Americans and Pilgrims actually illustrated that well.
But pre-industrial revolution, technology was more equitable, and did some things better or worse.
West only zoomed ahead technologically past the rest of the world with advent of industrial revolution, which was a massive gamechanger.
Namibia, arguably most remote part of Africa, had both pastoralist and hunter-gathering cultures plodding alongside
hunter-gathering went out of fashion in majority of Africa long by 19th century
both 14th century
Timbuktu had a university in similar period when Poland founded its own, a bit older in fact.
along with what West Africa had alreayd in form of ideogramic scripts
2) there was also massive spread of Islamic influences for centuries, expanding literacy in West Africa a lot
1) 1885
which suggests that iron metallurgy developed there independently and spread from Nigeria
Igboland has rather old iron smelting sites
I guess they didn't have enough tin and copper in conveniently far locations anywhere southern of that circle of civilization

"Whoever is involved in the cryptocurrency trading for some time, must have heard the term Whale. For instance, when you see a huge drop in a coins price, people will sometimes blame it on whales that are dumping on the market. If you think about it, whale is the biggest creature in the ocean and can probably defeat any other fish. Same is with the crypto market. Massive hedge funds and investment funds that have a large percentage of a coin volume can be compared to a whale. The smaller the volume of a coin, the easier for a whale to manipulate it."
apparently crypto whale is now a term

enough said
10 % inflation in my country
if the VAT on every type of staples and non-luxurious consumer goods was lowered.
I'd be willing to pay few more percent of income tax
and if you ask me
VAT is supposed to be one of better taxes to generate revenues, but not when it's a byzantine and arcane mess.
but high and complicated VAT affects operating costs.
we have low corporate tax so that's not the complaint of the business
because increasing income tax's progression while reducing base VAT and simplifying VAT regulations would've been better for the business, ironically enough.
like honestly, seriously even more low taxation friendly media like Forbes roasted our tax system.
our taxation trends towards the flatline but never quite reaches it
yeah, the average effective tax rate flatlines after you add non-income taxation
Hungarian tax system is de facto flat.
I believe only Hungary has more regressive taxation than Polish in EU.
both governments promised to return to it, never did.
this was the tax rate before the crisis of 2008 here
there are large appendices issued for every discounted tax rate because the bill itself would become a book I guess without them.
now you need the acumen (or someone with acumen) to know whether you absolutely have to pay 23 % or make use of 3-8 % rates for pretty specific things (or get extempted altogether).
as the basic rate
23 %
when people think of dodging taxes they imagine corporations in tax heavens, and that's not entirely true (in the sense that some people without great wealth also attempt that, furthering a grey zone).
when there is too many specific regulations, there is plenty of holes to exploit.
no, I have to deal with VAT and evade a bit to easen my life.
I unironically think the media should not have thrown fit about some MPs watching ero stuff on their parliament issued tablets, I'd rather them watch naked tits than fiddle with VAT every year.
So 'legislative diarhaes' happen
like take a chain of bakeries, or even a bakery, I recall there are different VAT provisions for different types of pastries because our parliament is a bloated mess the size of American Congress with a 10 times smaller population.
I imagine how worse it gets for any business that employs people in double digits already.
I pay 50 PLN each month for a guy to help me deal with this shit.
and I'm average Joe
I have accountant
while VAT remains high and tangled mess of regulations that affects the poor and the businessmen alike (those without army of accountants so basically everything that's not a large corporation).
Hell, some progressive taxes got cut by few percent, like income tax.
we had historic aversion to spiraling debt, but our government doesn't think that comprehensive tax reform to sustain increased spending is good.
ah yes, demagogues gonna be tempted to fudge stats (I already think they do but about debt, we have certain treshold on paper that forces government to abide by very clear emergency rules)
I don't blame EU for somewhat tightening the tap with money, that's provoked by our government's culture wars about issues of sexual minorities and climate change.
well, 5 % growth looks good on paper, but that's not high for our usual, I believe.
and slowing growth.
It's not just inflation, but the growing public debt, reduced subsidies from EU, etc.
I expect rate of unemployment to rise when our economy buckles more under strains.
I'd say they're worse than Fox News, from how I got to compare the two.
and tbh, our right wing media are a giant bubble sheltering conservative voters from lots of reality.
I mean, I had initially some faith that growing prices of staples like bread would crash government support, but some voters are so partisan now I guess they shrug that off.
double digit inflation is not hyperinflation, but definitely a 'galloping' inflation.
well, I think the eyes of such stubborn people will only open when it's hyperinflation time.
yeah, but according to the survey some people do believe that increasing prices means that shopkeepers will profit more.
bigger wages or bigger prices look good on sufrace.
I filed a CV for a job that pays in euro, too, wish me luck.
already had when the inflation was like, in normal levels.
I have all my money in euro, I'm ahead of y'all.
we've got a cursed combination of both the government and the central bank (which is independent) acting without vigor about economic woes.
our central bank acts too slow about increasing the interest rates
or at least buy some time.
sudden decrease of prices across the board could calm the public maybe?
inflation is partly fuelled by expectations that the prices will grow.
wouldn't even a temporary VAT decrease help to curb some of inflationary expectations?
now that I think about that
actually
in common law I'd probably get better settlement of my grandad's inheritance because of weight of precedents potentially ruling in my favor, I'm lucky that inheritance trial was basically waste of time since my feuding family reconciled during lockdown.

the most egregious example I think was the prosecutor breaching 5th amendment with the way he asked a question
I recall he almost violated grossly the procedures at few points, the trial was on thin ice already due to such clumsy behavior on the part of prosecution.
in my impression
because the prosecutor was particularly incompetent
it's also a mess of a trial

In China, female aristocrats had full access to education, just like aristocratic Roman women.
hence for example Taisho died a monarch despite being very ill and unfit for his role (Hirohito did unofficial regency)
Meiji oligarchs tried to shape the customs governing monarchy more after Western models
didn't happen for generations until Akihito abdicated
<@!203444794737950720> someone tried to mail bomb Grodzki
Anyay, explained myself. Otherwise my criteria for monarchs are very strict, and I'm normally strongly in favor of republics
This is also something with plenty of historical precedent, but they acted as if abdication was a modern innovation unbecoming of a monarch.
It's a miracle though they allowed Akihito to abdicate.
Strictly male succession is an invention of Meiji era, feudal Japan had plenty Empresses too.
Kinda fucked up though how all those traditionalist politicians care about nebulously defined tradition, but refused to reform succession to include women.
And if you know Japanese, you probably can reach out to Naruhito on social media. (To the horror of 'traditionalist' Japanese)
Model constitutional monarchs, figureheads, but they do spend their time on doing something more than looking good for cameras and I respect that.
They actually apologized for the atrocities instead of beating around the bush, actually contribute to the world in a direct way as scientists too (and Naruhito is a climate scientist pretty much by education and does activism in the field of conservation of fresh water sources).
anyway, to not be all gloom and doom, I will explain why I like the two most recent Japanese monarchs.
Prince Andrew is charged with much worse thing yet there's no attempt to bring him to justice in UK, Bowles-Lyons molested a woman in his ancestral castle, got sentenced to a prison and the sports event that his family was patron of for generations was moved from his castle to somewhere else.
anyway, Bowles-Lyons getting arrested, but Prince Andrew not makes it clear for me there are double standards about royals.

that'd have been my big brain idea especially if British monarchy was abolished altogether

my gramps smuggled construction materials out of the factory communists were building or expanding, in 1950s, and since he may or may not have been friendly (or even intimate, I have suspicions) with one of factory managers, he got away with this.

well, PiS is still unattractive to the business
we'd be a tax haven if not for the byzantine bureaucracy and the high VAT bullshit
we have lower corporate tax than USA
not a fan of too high corporate taxes, but Poland could use a higher CIT rate
I like moderately low VAT btw for both being easy on the poor and incentiving business compared to high rates like 20+%
that, and the capital flight problem.
I'd still lower and simplify VAT, but introduce more income tax progression
because they won't likely raise income taxes
they're instead killing the revenue further with that half-measure in long-term.
of course that won't be followed up by an increase of income taxes, so that's still in essence a populist distraction.
and implement food purchase subsidies
and decrease fuel excise
yeah
I hope it lasts like that "temporary hike"
they're dropping the VAT to flat 8 % rate temporarily (except for the rates that are already lower)

The state built here pseudo-Khrushchovskas back in communist era, then the mayor had to fix the shit left behind.
people don't necessarily act for the common good in such situations
right now, my mom is trying to wrangle the people to pay for the monitoring (because someone got murdered).
we have a communal garden in our neighborhood
I also don't have rose-tinted view of communes from first hand experience
The land was still owned, because you could transfer it from one household to another through things like marriage.
In this case, whole village pooled the land, and the commune elders redistributed the land periodically, taking some land from wealthiest peasants. And it was assumed by peasants that this was natural state of things, so rich peasants and poor peasants acted like coherent social force.
Those peasants still liked profit, and owning some property.
There were communes in 1860s-1920s Russia, but peasants still owned the land, just it was traditional to redistribute it. They had to be forced by the state to stop this. That's the biggest example in history of mass commune-based agriculture.
In Poland and maybe some other East bloc countries.
Because that has happened before.
a state might arrive at a solution like "perpetual lease" that's practically ownership, to make things easier.
also I think that in state controlled economy
but they aged pretty badly in long-term
though to be fair, Khruschevkas worked in short-term.
dacha for me, but Krushchevka for thee.
I have neither absolute faith in invisible hand of market nor absolute faith in visible hand of state.

No shooters or HOI4 for him.
I get Schadenfraude from Breivik claiming he's being tortured because the prison only provides him PG-3 PS3 games.
plus Norwegians do plan to loophole to keep that sicko Breivik in detention for life (they finally learned after a white supremacist terror attack reaped more than a single life), yet provide him standard amenities. Both can be done.
I'd rather risk life imprisonment that than guarantee that a serious criminal is let loose after some time.
people who commit lesser crimes deserve our resources and focus, but someone who intentionally kills someone doesn't deserve such treatment.
because there's non-negligible number of white supremacist terrorists in prisons now
if Tlaib gets killed in a domestic terror attack after passing such bill, it'd call it karmic for tempting the fate.
Imagine what happens if BREATH passes
so yeah, a guy who set many churches on fire and murdered a band member intentionally should walk free.
I don't believe in mercy for pedophiles, murderers, slavers (that includes nowaday human traffickers), rapists and other such scum.
justice
he's a murderer
man who intentionally stabbed repeatedly his colleague shouldn't enjoy freedom
he tried to escape from prison while stocking up on dangerous materials, yet got released early
there should be always some measure to isolate murderers from the society
lack of life sentences is why murderers like Varg got to enjoy freedom
if progs want to reform the criminal justice system, they should stop proposing both dangerous and unpassable clauses to be included in bills
>ending life sentences
The bill also would end life sentences, abolish mandatory minimum sentencing laws and create a specific timeline to close federal prisons and immigration detention centers.
seems federal
are clinics mentioned in the bill?
and she mentioned mentally ill, but uhhh, releasing them isn't good idea either
the rapists and murderers and other scum like that (human traffickers were mentioned when she was being pilloried) either would have to go to state prisons or walk, I guess.
what the fuck, what is even going in her head
>release everyone
Why it matters: Psaki's remarks come amid a broader discussion on prison reform and after Tlaib was challenged on her stance by Axios' Jonathan Swan in an "Axios on HBO" interview.

"[E]veryone's like, 'Oh my God, we're going to just release everybody.' That's not ‚Äî ," Tlaib said in the interview, which aired Sunday.
Swan interjected that the BREATHE Act "actually says: Release everyone" from federal prisons over 10 years.

10 years is the optimistic timeframe for deploying the nuclear power plant
Sweden finished in 6 months a wind farm that generates as much energy as our planned nuclear plant
building new nuclear distracts from deploying more renewables
excuse to keep coal as long as possible
we're prime wind energy generator like Sweden, but our government is doing damage by wanting to now focus on nuclear energy
this is mostly local and private initiatives, I believe

pollutes alone more than some medium sized countries like Switzerland
Be≈Çchat√≥w Coal Plant is both the largest coal plant in the world in terms of capacity and the most inefficient in the world.
Btw, the compromise was basically vague shit about refining the powder with aim of curbing sulphur content, the miners still didn't take it.
Of course there are civvies who also complain about that ban, but the renewable and natural gas folks get to be relieved. Prices of heating are already high, but those people are currently being scammed by speculators who stocked up on the ecogroszek thing.
Losing patience pretty much, it's been years and years of trying to persuade them, we import that coal from Columbia anyway at this point, it's basically a zombie industry that refuses to die in grace.
If they wanted more money, I'd understand, but they don't seem to want money, just the polluting industry to keep going.
Force that 6 digit cash per capita down their throat, endure riots, maybe rough up them if they destroy property too much (don't care about burning some tyres, but if they start burning down buildings, that's a cue they should kindly fuck off or its water hosing time), move on.
We're the climate black spot of the world, if coal miners refuse all kinds of compromises, severances, post-closure plans and so on, we should just unilaterally move into closing the coal mines.
It's entirely possible tho the government might retreat like a lobster into lake after enough rubber tyres are burned, we really should stop coddling that clique.
our government had actual broken clock moment, and after coal miners refusing all kinds of compromises diluting the ban, just went over them.
they're threatening riots over a law that suspends production of a fuel made of powdered brown coal (very misleadingly called ecogroszek)
anyway, I wonder if I will repeat myself, but fuck coal miners

No one should go to jail for taking heroine unless they are drug dealers (and even then, distinguish between small fries dealing drugs and the organized crime they might be working for)
Junkies are not sent to prison, they are sent for rehabilitation in hospitals.
Portugal did that.
and yeah, decriminalization of drugs should be first step, even hard ones.
Integrate aspects of community service and vocational training and psychological help.
the aim is to reform prisons as a pathway to societal reintegration for people who are not too dangerous yet, not as a play to keep them locked for x time.
I think someone once at Discord told me that he works at jail for minor offenders and the prison gambling and other toxic activities reduced in number after prisoners were allowed to play board games and stuff like DnD.
Though paid community service, with money being saved largely for purpose of free life after serving the sentence, should be a very regulated option.
I don't mean prison work, because any activity that keeps their attention would work.
I generally believe that minor criminals shouldn't spend time idle in prisons because that leads to boredom. And that they should be strictly seperated from professional criminals and serious offenders.
I argue for applying different measures for different degrees of crime. Non-violent crime definitely should be treated with aim of rehabilitation. Intentional homicides, sexual abuse and slavery like human trafficking? That's different dimension.
there is strong opposition to any anti-COVID measures from people our conservative government relies on.

well, there's also general mistrust in Russian government in Russia. People assuming that if Western vaccines are "bad", then surely government ones must be bad too.
Russians conducted anti-vaxx propaganda aimed at Western social media, but seems like that also affected the Russian populace's skepticism towards vaccines. He complained angrily that people don't want to take vaccines few months ago.
he ain't a 4D chess man.
anyway, Putin malding that people won't take vaccines evokes Schadenfraude in me.
so there's high anti-vaccine skepticism in the Russophonic sphere
his anti-vax propaganda aimed at Western online users backfired on him because Russians have no firewall

sorry for essay, I just don't know what you mean by mature forest, and there's a lot of difference between uncontrolled and a managed forestry.
I imagine though if North Americans had large livestock like Eurasians and Africans, they'd experiment with pastoralism, they did burn some of forests for savannah to give room for bisons, very indirect herding basically.
because that's in principle what for example Amazon Forest is, it's semi-artificial forest because the humans who settled the region consciously selected for greater prevalence of species of trees that gave useful food and products to harvest.
if we go with the spirit of what the inhabitants commonly did with forests, we better reclaim some of the land for non-monocultural orchards
So I think reclamations should be accompanied by even more intensive archeological work because we already know that pre-modern civilizations innovated a lot in agriculture and shaping forests and there are still lessons to be learned.
what some ecologists envision as the pristine natural state of the American continent was basically a post-apocalyptic landscape generations after smallpox took its toll.
the pre-Columbian landscape was heavily human engineered.
now the good question is how it's reclaimed.

considering it's a word from Bhutanese official, and Bhutan is absolute monarchy, it might be higher.
they have still unofficially a medieval like serfdom
that's why I mean by dystopian
Bhutan is described by Tashi Wangchuk, a Bhutanese civil servant, as having officially abolished serfdom by 1959, but he believes that less than or about 10% of poor peasants were in copyhold situations.[11]
actions which lowered relations between Bhutan and Nepal just to above absolute zero.
to be correct, not exactly Nepalis, but there's an ethnic group speaking similar language and being culturally similar that has lived in Bhutan and have been routinely subject to ethnic cleansings.
if Nepal bordered Bhutan, their little shitty dystopian kingdom probably would've been toppled by Ghurka squads.
now if they didn't force out Nepalis every generation
where up to 90 % of inhabitants identify as Taiwanese over Chinese
If we take the polls
Taiwan is most popular label.
I think closest demographic parallel might be Madagascar: Pacific Islander natives mixing with mainlanders (black people of Bantu nations in this case).
it's pretty interesting that the immigrants basically overlap genetically with how pre-Qinq annexation population was like
The original population of the island of Taiwan and its associated islands, i.e. not including Kinmen and the Matsu Islands, consists of a variety of Taiwanese indigenous peoples, who speak several Formosan languages. They share languages with the Austronesian family and mitochondrial DNA contribution with many of the peoples of Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. Taiwan is also the linguistic homeland of the Austronesian peoples.[2]
unironically the Pacific Islander immigrations are adding more Polynesian ancestry.
considering the natives are Polynesian
and in foreseeable future the intermarriages between immigrants might be 1/4 of all couples.
the immigrants from Pacific Islands and south east Asia are already assimilating to Taiwanese identity.
Nobody will name it Formosa though.
technically taiwan's formal name is more correctly Zh≈çnghu√° M√≠ngu√≥ because Qinq doesn't rule it
the name given by Portugeuse?
Taiwan still calls itself formally Republic of China and tbh recognizing it will mean recognising the name too.

Guy modelled his animation techniques on Disney's Fantasia of 1940.
Whatever helps you pay your bills, I guess.
the thing I didn't mention is that the director of both Momotaro movies changed his job post-war to animate movies and illustrate children's book as part of pro-democracy education drive in 1949.
not sure if it's material for anime channel, so here it is.
Momotaro: Sacred Sailors is not the first animated piece of Japanese propaganda. A shorter prequel called Momotaro's Sea Eagles was previously commissioned by the Japanese Navy in 1943. The film would incorporate the folkloric character Momotaro ("Peach Boy"), a popular hero figure in Japanese stories. Aimed at children, the film followed the story of this hero commanding a naval unit made up of various animals. They fight demons on the famous island of Onigashima (a setting that may sound familiar to One Piece fans). These demons were dramatized British and American adversaries, and the whole thing is more or less a dramatization of the Pearl Habor attacks. The film even uses real footage of the bombings. Momotaro's Sea Eagles ran 37 minutes, meaning it just missed out on the 40-minute threshold to qualify as a feature-length film. Momotaro: Sacred Sailors would go far and beyond, cementing itself in the history books of Japanese animation.
anyway, today is the anniversary of the day that started the chain of events that caused anime.

I'd say even in a genuinely democratic society this legacy would take time to undo, and Russia went through a period of totalitarianism for few decades straight and periods when Soviet Union tried to encourage more gender egalitarianism were brief.
Before the abolition of serfdom in 1861, most peasants lived in large extended families, with several generations under the same roof. Family size shrank somewhat in the later nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. But the household, like the commune, remained patriarchal in structure, with ultimate authority in the hands of the oldest male (bol'shak), who was at one and the same time father or grandfather, judge and mediator of disputes, family accountant and supervisor of chores and farm labor. Women were subordinated to him and other men. As a peasant saying proclaimed, "A crab is not a fish, a woman is not a person." Often the victims of beatings or the violent justice of the village, peasant women were forced to accept male dominance. "The more you beat the old woman," another proverb stated, "the tastier the soup will be." Children were beaten regularly as well, and one who escaped the village to become a famous actor remembered that for his father "loving and fearing your parents was the same thing."
Russia needs to tackle legacy of centuries of toxic cultural household relations.

The most Futurist country in some way is Eritrea, because the military government pretty much flaunts the relics of Italian architecture in the capital as part of local heritage.
of course both fizzled out once Fascism and Bolshevism settled on more conservative form of media expression.
I write Bolshevism and Fascism here in capital letter, since the two Futurist movements aligned with one of them specificially.
Futurism (Italian: Futurismo) was an artistic and social movement that originated in Italy in the early 20th century and also developed in Russia. It emphasized dynamism, speed, technology, youth, violence, and objects such as the car, the airplane, and the industrial city. Its key figures were the Italians Filippo Tommaso Marinetti, Umberto Boccioni, Carlo Carr√†, Fortunato Depero, Gino Severini, Giacomo Balla, and Luigi Russolo. It glorified modernity and aimed to liberate Italy from the weight of its past.[1] Important Futurist works included Marinetti's Manifesto of Futurism, Boccioni's sculpture Unique Forms of Continuity in Space, Balla's painting Abstract Speed + Sound, and Russolo's The Art of Noises.

Although it was largely an Italian phenomenon, there were parallel movements in Russia, where some Russian Futurists would later go on to found groups of their own; other countries either had a few Futurists or had movements inspired by Futurism.
there were strains of Bolshevism and Fascism that were fixated with modernism and future, too.
his expansionist policies were more inspired by domestic brand of irredentia (I mean, Italians coined that word, too) and fascination with Roman imperialism.
New Deal policies

Revision has to originate what you revise.
if you want to be fair, he did have Marxist roots.
At the outbreak of World War I in August 1914, the Italian political left became severely split over its position on the war. The Italian Socialist Party (PSI) opposed the war but a number of Italian revolutionary syndicalists supported war against Germany and Austria-Hungary on the grounds that their reactionary regimes had to be defeated to ensure the success of socialism.[98] Angelo Oliviero Olivetti formed a pro-interventionist fascio called the Revolutionary Fasces of International Action in October 1914.[98] Benito Mussolini upon being expelled from his position as chief editor of the PSI's newspaper Avanti! for his anti-German stance, joined the interventionist cause in a separate fascio.[99] The term "Fascism" was first used in 1915 by members of Mussolini's movement, the Fasces of Revolutionary Action.[100]
Mussolini was PSI member originally
Mussolini was a socialist who got a nationalist brainrot from irredentism.
it took a Congressman to meet with his pals in Jewish and Italian mafia to harass them into non-existence (the mafiosos did it free of charge, since let's just say those two mafias had an axe to grind with Axis)
German-American Bund was a joke, tho

I think the Hobbit movies was a wake up call what happens if the IP holders of LOTR don't pay enough attention to how a thing is done.
because I don't trust anyone but the Tolkien Estate in this case

I've been suspicious of the project's reliability for years, so it being completely compromised by rich dictatorships with human rights breach record is the least surprising thing for me, tbh.

but yeah, I don't think immigrants going native will save Icelandic without relying on any reforms.
which is still separate language, but English speakers, native and not, can read it.
probably as legible to me as Dutch
I wonder how evolved Icelandic would look like
70 % of Polish vocabulary has been taken from other languages.
absorb neologisms like a sponge and move on
compare that to languages like Polish which just
Iceland is smaller and easier overwhelmed by the new media age.
unironically I pilfered that paragraph from Icelandic newspapers who first direct to English version rather than native ones.
In an open letter published in Fr√©ttabla√∞i√∞ on Tuesday, speech pathologist and linguist Linda Bj√∂rk Mark√∫sard√≥ttir expresses concern over Icelandic children‚Äôs deteriorating vocabulary skills. She believes increasing computer use has badly affected children‚Äôs vocabulary skills and reading comprehension and fears that the Icelandic language might become extinct in the future.

‚ÄúMore and more often, children with little Icelandic comprehension are being referred to me. I‚Äôll show them pictures of commonplace objects and ask them to tell me the object‚Äôs name. Often I‚Äôll receive answers such as: ‚ÄúI know what this is, I just don‚Äôt know what it‚Äôs called in Icelandic‚Äù. When I ask whether they know the object‚Äôs name in English, they‚Äôre quick to reply,‚Äù she wrote.
but if Icelander language authorities lose out to the Anglophonic media due to inflexibility, then that's on them.
English didn't lose their sense of local identity despite the Old English morphing from influence of Old Norse and French.
I think that the best way to preserve language probably would be to let it evolve.
(Poles are setting up their own parallel education system)
while not pointing out that the largest group of immigrants isn't particularly eager to learn Icelandic
some cope that immigrants will learn Icelandic, and one article pointed to Amharan woman as evidence it's totally happening.
and I find recipe of the linguists who complain it, to double down on language conservatism, self-defeating tbh.
because Icelander hasn't been coping well with adjustment to the digital media
because the children are attracted to basically most of media aimed at them being in English
pandemic probably worsened it
since the current generation of children has lots of native speakers of English and like half of them uses English in playgrounds.
there's actual recognized threat from English to the Icelander language
as for the cultural ties, it's gravitating heavily towards Anglophonic world now
the western half of it is on American plate since its cut in half
and probably culturally American within generation or two since the language seems to be dying out among zoomers
counterpoint: the populated part of Iceland is geographically American
Because Sapkowski gave the author okay for calling his own take on a monster hunter a witcher, and so the Ukrainian guy wrote a cyberpunk take on the witcher concept.
I'm generally for these reason cautious about IP rights in fantasy, but there are some exceptions I approve of like the Ukrainian copy of Witcher.
so he released it free, and at least he doesn't get money for this problematic writing.
the Russian author tried to publish it, but thanks to Tolkien Estate's reputation the publishers were... reluctant.
if someone wants to make Sauron misunderstood guy in the right, they should IMO stop right there because they fall into worse writing.
and I noticed creepy anti-Semitic vibes about how the Russian author portrays elves <:yeshoney:774031695728345088>

there's posthumous book that uses photocopies sent by Chris Tolkien to the author of the nature of middle earth
we still get new materials
while Christopher Tolkien has been transparent about not making shit up
because he refuses to show
tbh Herbert's son has zero proof he used any manuscript
Honestly, nothing justifies Morgoth, he did utterly reprehensible shit in response to being simply scolded.
but his motives were different
well, Aule literally also wanted to do his own thing?
Aule tried to do his own creation, but his efforts got endorsed by Eru because he did it out of altruism and love
Morgoth was a prideful cunt who acted solely of jealousy
but did edgy "the good guys were actually evil guys" tired type of pastiche
so far the only fanfics have been done by Russians who didn't even understand the point of the books
well, anyone with a shred of respect for Tolkein won't try to sell fanfics
I would feel like someone dug out the corpse for public display instead of let it rest.
I believe Warner Bros was the organization who tried to dirty shit like that behind the back of the family and got stopped.
Tolkien's last living daughter for example sued people who illegally exploited Tolkien characters for an online gambling game.
it was still a adaptation, even if bad one. I dread to imagine what could happen if someone wanted to write a sequel to LOTR for example, a thing which Tolkien abandoned as pretty pointless. Tolkien Estate as people who are emotionally invested in integrity of the IP over quick buck are honestly a good thing.
because even the early vaccines give you enough protection to not end up hospitalized

the omicron scare is overdone
since Storrada, his mother, was a Piast.
I mean Canuth the Great
anyway, one thing that people like Varg certainly won't like. The most famous Scandinavian king was half-Polish.
since they happened after Old English solidified
though I think it's fair to count Norse influence as non-native
for real though that's just morons talking shit, the only country where Poles are systematically oppressed is Byelarussia.
except for that one who according to research complained that "Hitler didn't kill them all", I'd simply beat the shit out of them as my usual stance to people spouting such takes.
to any anti-Polish Icelander I'd say "go work in aluminium plant yourself"
edit: apparently anti-Polish sentiments did rear up recently according to surveys
kinda wild that we unexpectedly planted what seems to be permanent imprint of Polish culture outside Central Europe.
(compared to nearly 10 % of Byelarussia)
(it's like 3 % now)
Iceland would be on way to be more Polish than Byelarussia
if the financial crisis of Iceland didn't wreck the construction industry
apparently this is displacing other chocolate bars in Iceland.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Polo
fun fact we didn't have embassy in Iceland until immigrants went there.
The demographic is largely endogamous and insular. Poles in Iceland typically speak Polish, watch Polish television, continue to practice Catholicism and have opened Polish restaurants.[3] Despite their difficulty in assimilating, Poles have not often been met with much xenophobia in Iceland,[3] though academic research has found that Lithuanians do experience significant racism and xenophobia.[4]
since I read recommendations of Polish embassy and they basically point out that the parallel education in Polish is being set up for children.

though I do hope that Putin chickens out like towards Ukraine last month.
she's angry that the people who use coal are prioritized more than natural gas users seemingly (and that the hotline for the fuel subsidy grants is non-functional)
of course our situation isn't comparable but
this is also radicalizing my mom in rhetoric against Morawiecki, our Prime Minister
because if the opposition can't win in direct confrontation, they could at least making Kazakhstan ungovernable for anyone Putin could install, also sapping Russian economy further in the process so their future grip gets looser.

we'd tbh stop caring by now if unvaxxed weren't dropping dead

I'm not as mentally destabilized by the ongoing situation, but my friends in more lockdown happy countries are genuinely venting how their best years of life are wasted and how their underlying psychological issues are coming back in full force.
I mean, the point of those studies I heard about is that lockdowns are useless against the virus if it really spreads faster than measles.
because I don't want to be punished despite doing the rest properly
if my country did lockdowns I'd likely break them

well, I'll take the opinion of a guy who is very anti-government into consideration, lol.
his explanation is that MI5's top is not appointed by the government and that the bias may be in reporting of the content of the warning,
I now asked why he thinks MI5 is reliable
and he's no Tory
My British friend thinks it's not a political thing probably if it's warning from MI5
could be just usual business stuff, lobbying etc.
but I still don't want to leverage accusations
more plausible than what Home Secretary presents
it'd be actually possible if that person is actually a spy BUT the donations to Tories are conveniently omitted.
I think if CCP wanted to bribe someone to achieve some desired outcomes, they'd go for Tories, not LibDems and the currently disarrayed Labour.
Priti Patel up to old tricks, I guess (probably trumping up a scandal to deflect from the scandals of her boss)
oh, so he informed and it was transparent, then.
One of the MPs funded by Ms Lee was Labour's Barry Gardiner, who received over ¬£420,000 from her in five years - but he said he had always made the security services aware of the donations.
it's either some 5D chess involving a generic ex-Corbynite MP getting money for some 5D reason, or just potential bribery and I'm inclined to just most mundane explanation.
I guess if it's still some potential bribery case it's still worth investigating, but the plot would have to be really convoluted for it to be a spy case.
she wired large amounts of money to a Labour MP guy with nothing related to Chinese affairs in his record (nor really anything exciting).
but I don't know, if it's a spy plot, what's the motive of the person
I guess it's good I don't think of Asian person automatically when I hear "potential Chinese spy"
other outlets named her Christine Lee in short and when I hear it my brain remembers Christopher Lee and imagines a white British person

Ukraine legalizing crypto and then investing a lot into that would've been a dumb move for one reason.

Honestly mining getting more widespread in developing countries would also accelerate the climate emergency.

It's kinda funny how we played it safe and hired a Georgian actor to play the token Soviet crewman (edit: my bad, still Polish actor, but the character was explicitly a guy with surname like Saakashvili, basically to make him as least Russian as they could get away with it.)
The upbeat view of the war shown in the series was popular, but in many ways problematic. From the standpoint of military realism, the series is in fact almost grotesque, as its heroes have a very relaxed concept of military discipline, frequently fight their own "private" battles in defiance of orders, and effortlessly defeat German soldiers, who are depicted as faceless military incompetents. An emphasis is put on the friendship between front-line Polish and Soviet soldiers, but little or no mention of the problems in general Polish-Soviet relations of that era (though they were often suggested in the background).
this was basically our Marvel, because we mass exported Czterej Pancerni to the rest of Soviet bloc.
The popularity of the series came from it being one of the first postwar series to depict the era of World War II in a somewhat lighter vein. As the tragic events of the war receded, the Polish public became tired of the mandatory dark, tragic tone of previous television series and films dealing with wartime events.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_Tank-Men_and_a_Dog
People here also rewatch the action war movies and spy movies from communist era as long as they're not those one mass produced according to socialist realist template.
Make a good comedy, and it will be a hit, (and remain a hit, people still watch reruns of that communist era comedy trilogy about two squabbling peasants from Eastern Poland)
what I've noticed is that it doesn't matter the period, whether it's interwar, communist era or the new era of capitalism, the tastes, broadly speaking remain the same here.
Poland has its domestic movie industry, and
Because the same trend happened in Soviet Union whenever audience had a choice of picking a movie.
anyway my point is that while there are war movies, including those critical of the USA, they don't sell as much as more audience friendly stuff, and it's not the fault of capitalism, but the human psyche.
Like that comedy about a guy who stole cars to sell them and drop money at orphanage.
Then after the post-Stalin thaw, the moviegoers again chose more low brow, funny movies.
So you've got popular local stuff like Chapaev, a war movie whose hero became later butt of popular jokes, or that movie about bumbling workers from USA foiling a plot of anti-Soviet capitalist.
when eventually Soviet moviemakers realized that people won't go watch their movies as much as Western imports until they make them more accessible.
An interesting case of Soviet cinematography was the NEP era
This was not only a case in free market countries, but in communist countries too where movie goers liked more often comedies or anything spiced with lighter moments.
if they sell worse than pop culture flicks, then it's basically has it been for a long time, people always like lighter diversions.
supressed those anti-Iraq war documentaries and movies

not the black ships of 1850s, still a situation where Chinese could play the numbers game.
the technological gap wouldn't be that large, it was still the sail era.
I'd argue also that a more organized China would also sustain its large fleets from the golden era of Qinq, you know, the same that defeated the Dutch and made Spaniards concerned about reinforcing the Phillippines.
Search for Modern China, the third edition
I need to compress 500 MB copy, I will try
a book
In the area of opium addiction, the emperor was on new and untested terrain. Although some use of opium for its medicinal and narcotic properties had been recorded since the eleventh century,it was only after tobacco smoking had become popular in China during the seventeenth century, and after knowledge of opium-smoking techniques had been brought back from Taiwan by the soldiers who had been sent to suppress the Zhu Yigui rebellion of 1721, that opium addiction spread to the Chinese mainland. Yongzheng was alerted to the extent of the problem early in his reign and determined to ban opium smoking, but since there was no clear precedent in the Chinese legal code, a number of different clauses had to be invoked by analogy. Thus opium dealers were to be sentenced, like those selling contraband goods,to wear the heavy wooden collar called the ‚Äúcangue‚Äù for one month and then to be banished to a military frontier garrison. Those who lured the innocent into their opium dens were to be punished, like those preaching heterodox religions,to strangulation (subject to mitigation after review). Those smoking or growing opium were to be beaten with one hundred strokes in accordance with penalties for those who violated imperial orders. 

But in 1729 a long memorial reached Yongzheng and persuaded him to think the whole opium problem through with greater care. The memorial concerned an opium seller named Chen, who had been sentenced under the laws to have all his stock confiscated, to wear the cangue, and to be banished. But the opium seller protested his innocence on the grounds that he had been selling medicinal opium for health reasons only and not for smoking. Reviewing the evidence, Yongzheng acknowledged that this was indeed a valid distinction and that officials should always ascertain motivation in actions under investigation. This Chen, a Fujian shopkeeper who had traded his ‚Äúdried orange cakes‚Äù with a merchant in Guangdong for some forty pounds of opium, might well be a legitimate businessman or pharmacist, not a crook. As the emperor sensibly observed: ‚ÄúIf the opium is contraband, then Chen should not be graciously pardoned.Ifit is not contraband, then why have you stored it in the provincial treasury? This is the hard-earned capital of the common people. How can you deal with an error by committing another error, and thus deprive him of his livelihood?!‚Äù Here was a concrete example ofa situation in which the absolute ruler of the world‚Äôs largest empire could still keep a close watch on social problems, attempt to enforce a measure of economic equity, and pose as a supreme cultural arbiter.
Also the topic how the Chinese were aware of their problems before the shock of the Opium War is probably another lengthy topic. And the opium too.
imagine now China with better revenue and grip over countryside
The Qing, however, were not merely passive targets of Western technology and fire power. While still in Canton, Commissioner Lin had deputed a special task force of scholars to furnish him with all the information they could on Western nations, culled mainly from foreign publications in Canton and Singapore. He had also asked an American missionary to translate some brief passages of international law for him. Moreover, as the British proceeded with their campaigns in 1842, they found much evidence of the speed with which the Qing officials were trying to respond to the West's new technology. In Xiamen,for instance, they found a nearly completed replica of a British two-decker man-of-war with thirty guns; it was almost ready to sail, and work on several other similar vessels was well under way. In Wusong, they discovered five new Chinese paddle-wheel boats armed with newly cast brass guns. In Shanghai, they seized sixteen new, beautifully made eighteenpound ship‚Äôs guns,perfect in detail down to the sights cast on the barrels and the pierced vents for flintlocks. All were mounted on sturdy wooden trucks with iron axles. At least some people in China had clearly found the barbarian challenge to be a stimulus as well as an outrage.
Chinese managed to quickly copy the technology, but didn't have resources to utilize them.
The fun fact about the Opium War is how
After all, remember the case of Italy getting defeated by landlocked Empire of Abissynia
because naval projection wouldn't help if the invaded country could lead superior numbers in competent manner.
they could've dunked back on them
the same country that humiliated Dutch, extended their borders to its modern extent and was a peer to Russia then weakened enough that it couldn't leverage its resources against contenders effectively.
Qinq experienced both
periods of great growth and power and periods of institutional rot and decline
China is a sinusoid, like many countries
Qinq dynasty failed to reform its revenue collecting institutions which led to decline of their power.
The rot set in earlier
if you actually studied Qinq history you'd know it's not true at all.
Not all wealth, otherwise it'd not explain why some early colonizers fell behind and some very late starters or those who gave up on colonies pretty early on pulled ahead of them.
China had such hunger for silver and benefited so much from adoption of the New World crops that pretty much them falling behind Europe was for political reasons rather than economic.
All major wealth from Post-Columbian exchange flowing to Europe during the era of colonialism is such absolute take that it dismisses the impact on Asia, for example.
Anyway, my problem is that you seem to boil down everything to absolutes, tbh, hence your assertions that damn everything outside your hobby horse of political theories.
the factors that made steam engine viable happened to converge there at the time, and maybe someone else would have clearly developed it if the same factors happened to converge elsewhere.
that's not what I was saying
Because it only took off in England because the wages were high and coal abundant, so the shitty early steam engines were actually good investment at the time.
I wonder by the way how the simplistic zero-sum game believing pundits explain the industrial revolution.
Never mind that Poland had been the exploited very clearly since the grain trade's emergence to basically 1989.

don't ask Marx about that letter where he wrote about Lasalle.

Like I'm reading about the behaviors during the spread of telegraph, people also used it impulsively like some use Twitter.
I think Internet didn't cause any of this, it just gave an outlet for human psyche.
I honestly just stopped following now what's your point about video now, I just came here to point out that tonal neutrality isn't automatically inferior to taking overt side.
there will be always some unconscious bias, but for example that one Youtuber did whole "saga" of Chris-Chan without taking overt side and just presenting the events and circumstances, and that's more sensitive subject than NFTs I suppose.
so you're making an assumption now about this, I mean, you can make a tonal neutral breakdown on many topics, including more sensitive ones. I can imagine online documentary just breaking down all the security risks and incidents related to NFT without making fun of how ugly the art is for example.

we're gonna need more citizen scientists honestly to keep up with the glut of astronomic data.
not for crypto
I'm interested in alternate use of GPUs but
just like citizen scientists using their GPUs to help with astronomy data processing probably don't do much emissions.
small users are negligible probs
farms make difference enough, I think, especially on local level.
data centers are already insured against stuff like missiles.
against attacks
did you consider fact taht crypto farms might be insured
also
(and lone wolves won't achieve much against things like datacenters and crypto farms with data center style protections)
I mean, activists who use bombs gonna be probably wanted or blacklisted, so I covered them under 'organizations'.
I mean, North Korea found a new way to supply revenue last year, stealing 500 million worth of bitcoin.
than do anything like that
to steal crypto
I think rogue states and organizations are more likely
people wouldn't even notice IMO crypto much if tech oligarchs didn't jump on the bandwagon and started outsourcing large scale farms to cheapest locations, often using fossil fuels like in Kazakhstan.
yeah, but then it'd not be so commercialized and environmentally damaging as it's now if it's that deconcentrated.
the data center of Microsoft in Ireland built their roads in such way that ramming a vehicle is impossible, and also made medieval style moat filled with with water.
I guess crypto farms might start copying some stratagems.
*cloud computing
terrorism is actual concern for data centers used in computing.
The key is to make the attacks so expensive that hacker will move on easier target unless they're really well paid and provided with expensive tools for hacking.
Anyone enough determined will achieve things (I even know the rates for which some types of hacking service go on darknet, and they can be cheap against targets that are reckless).
the security philosophy now is about making infiltration attempts expensive rather than stopping them.
one very general takeaway I have from learning about security as I did subtitles for webinars is that
I have semi-insider information from Microsoft Poland, generally.
since it's getting steadily more convenient than doing things on-prem.
now that's a thing people talk little about in the midst of the crypto media hullabaloo, but it's the future.

honestly the double-edged sword of things not staying buried is that Russians got hoisted by own petard when they spread the COVID misinfos to Internet

serious discussion 2
if y'all still continue talking after I'm awake or when I turn off to bed, I'm not gonna be surprised.
anyway, I don't have stamina to follow this, I need to finish up things elsewhere.
and even then, I don't put all my eggs into currency basket.
I don't invest in stocks and other volatile investments except maybe some currency investments since my mom has a good nose for it.
I will still avoid crypto investments like fire, but if they won't harm me, I will just treat it as subjective tastes.
only state actors at a state level will be able to dismantle farms if they are inclined so. Small time miners won't cause problems that lead to situations like Kosovo outages.
if my knowledge about how data centers are protected is relevant here, then they won't.
yeah
frankly it's you two in back and forth, I'm just playing Devil's Advocate why I think crypto farms won't be under threat from hostile attacks.
hackers being like <:soy2r:907318459023650887>  about Metaverse boomers when biometric data become more relevant for authentication because Metaverse gonna collect them and probably be as easy target as Facebook for hacks.
it's basically Second Life, but greater security risk.
I'm painfully aware how it will make things difficult for IT, in way unrelated to crypto.

even blogs that are rail-biased I found acknowledge that trucks have advantagas in some areas
especially since both trucks and trains have strength that complement each other
no one gonna phase out highways worldwide, so I'm not entertaining that notion
those alternatives have lower carbon print than bitumen, longer lifetime and can incorporate additives from recycled materials, so like, I upgrade over bitumen.
I provided alternative still, since no one gonna replace highways
the power of plants
like natural polymers
Another alternative to bitumen for road infrastructure, is the use of a naturally occurring polymer known as Lingin ‚Äì a complex natural polymer, which normally provides firmness to plant tissues. (5) The Netherlands already have test roads & cycle paths which are paved with a bitumen-like product made from the natural binder lignin.
bitumen might be phased out with better alternatives
the one advantage I see of trucks vs trains is that trains that ship things aren't exactly fastest, and trucks might deliver more perishable products faster.
if repairing takes more money, increase tolls.
and rail can't reach everywhere
things wear down
just repair highways
also just EVs plus green grid solves the most of problems of trucks, tbh.
just like the millions in my country evading paying TV loicense

just said my piece of mind.
don't reply back to me, I'm going to sleep
rail can't reach everywhere, people will own cars, and people have right to variety of options.

anyway, I'm out, said what I wanted.
my argument is that you can do both, depending on needs of given industry.
rail wins at bulk transport, trucks win at flexibility is the picture I get from various sites, even literally lobbying for rail.
like trucks being better at delivering perishable foods with predictable scheduling.
if it happens, it's Russia's fault pretty much

some people from Phillippines started renting their NFTs and collecting rent from stupid people.
Renting NFTs
heard about new grift?
they produce both in such amounts that some Russian sci-fi and fantasy writers started bashing that for unoriginality
the Popadanstvo targeted at female audience is all about marrying hot vampires, elves, nobles
the one targeted at male audiences indulges power fantasies like "you reincarnate as Nicholas II Romanov and fight communists, you reincarnate as Trotsky and kill Stalin, you reincarnate as Stalin and fight Lord Vader (real examples)
there are two types of Russian isekai (Popadanstvo)
despite Russia having its own gigantic "you ended up in another world/another timeline" genre of mass media.
Russian courts started acting against isekai shows

I'm realist on that and I don't think there will be WW3 over this (there's surge of NATO troops in Poland and Baltics to discourage any sneaky moves and there are no troops in Ukraine except for a bunch of professional trainers from Britain and Canada instructing Ukrainians how to use the AT guns), but there still might be a flareup of war that may lead to loss of life in thousands even if Ukraine stops invasion in tracks.
I hope Putin blinks first and nothing happens by 29st January (first likeliest date of hostilities according to some analysts) or by April in long-term (Russian economy can't sustain current mobilization that long)

It is becoming now because Putin can't hold it in pants. Crazy to think that our most succcessful President talked that maybe Russia can be in NATO one day too.
if this was purely about security, then they wouldn't adopt a "forward position" and pre-emptively invade Ukraine.
No, if the countries joined it in sovereign manner.
we border Kaliningrad Oblast, one giant military base.
anyway, we're in such geopolitical situation that the most serious anti-military position here is "keep the obligations at 2 % GDP" of the social democrats and their socialist allies.
and we were in Warsaw Pact, a belligerent superpower with a history of invasions and sending troops to murder striking civilians on quite many occasions. So pivoting to NATO was sensible decision and NATO never did the same thing in our country.
almost whole political spectrum, from the remnant of socialists to the ultraconservatives (Neonazis are exception, I could go on about thier big brained ideas, but it's a bit offtopic) agrees that joining NATO and being in NATO is a good thing.
joining NATO was unanimous decision of whole political spectrum
(It took Yeltsin to withdraw the troops, not Gorbaczev)
We genuinely wanted security guarantee after being occupied by Russians between 1944-1991.
That didn't stop us.
Russia should fuck off about decisions like joining NATO.
Anyway, we're sovereign nations.
Then he clearly broke the word as back then, lmao.
During the mid-1990s he and his oligarch friends courted the military candidate to win second round 2 against the Communists.
You should actually read some Sovietologist stuff, it's clear that Yeltsin had his own agenda and support base and his own way of manipulating elections.
He was no puppet, but extremely opportunistic and ambitious Politburo member who seized a channel to power and then started ditching democratic pretensions while in office.
Yeltsin rose to power on wave of popularity and renewed Russian nationalism after Gorbaczev fucked up some fiercely, and then proceeded to fuck up while in office.
my country's president literally met with him to assuage him and obtain permission by 1996.
wow, denying Yeltsin and Russian history agency
>US backed puppet
They were promised territorial integrity by Russia in a treaty if they did that, but Putin Anschluss'd Crimea and Donbass anyway two decades later.
Ukraine wishes probably they didn't rid of nukes.
Russia has shown that they treat any agreement like toilet paper.
Yeltsyn approved of NATO expansion (even though the central-eastern european countries would likely run out of patience if Russia kept making noise about it and just join).
Also Russia's juvenile about its """"security concerns""""" to the point they demand rollback of NATO.
Russians are in the wrong here and Ukraine is trying to do what they can to survive as independent nation after chasing away their corrupt pro-Russian president in a fit of popular outrage.

they failed to reach their objective (establishing a fake state of Novorossiya as far as Odessa) when they invaded Ukraine in middle of political turmoil.
and Russians don't have element of surprise anymore
also stop dooming, there are no NATO troops in Ukraine, we're literally just supplying Ukraine with arms.

if that happens, then Russia will be forewarned anyway.
There is a chance invasion might happen on that or that Russia might blink, that's the date by which the "exercises" of CSTO troops are supposed to end.
anyway, keep eye on 29th.
Give us a discount on ferries to Stockholm and museum tickets at least.
They're good people, anyway, my only semi-serious accusation is that they should be more fortright about the origin of all their artwork their Vasas stole from our Vasas during an invasion of 1655.
this month for the first time of history the support for Sweden joining NATO outright has outweighed opposition, though by margin of 5 % and neither yea or nay has majority if we add people who expressed neutral stance in surveys.
My Swedish friend is quite anti-military, but Swedes started worrying about Russia since Russia started doing frogmen exercises on their uninhabited islands and other incursions in their international waters. There's also growing sense of solidarity with Eastern Europe and joining Finland might be a straw that hastens NATO joining, though Sweden already became as close ally to NATO as Morocco.
I have some insight into Swedish mentality, even if it's limited to a person, on how they feel about Russia.
So I don't think they can be construed as purely contrarian to Russia.
Finland had a past of getting bullied by USSR, but also have reached out with detente to USSR during Cold War and continued the policy to some extent.
"If you invade Ukraine, we will join NATO"
And Finland even drew a red line for Russians.
Reminder that Russia's posture this year made Finland and Sweden seriously think about joining NATO.

And well, some parts of Polish opposition would absolutely wear fursuits in early 1980s if it was widespread subculture by then, Orange Alternative's whole gimmick was dressing up in absurd costumes to bait cops, like Santa Claus and dwarf costumes.
probably would be more tolerated during periods when cultural restrictions were somewhat loosened under Khrushchev and Brezhnev (it was like sinusoid under them), alas we will never know since furry fandom as we can recognize it is a thing of 1980s and if it spread to USSR it'd have been under glasnost.
But of course it was okay when Politburo individuals and such watched westerns in private, so I guess so I guess double standards would apply too.
If they were average people, they'd be probably seen the same way as jazz enthusiasts, i.e. potential dissidents dabbling with Western "fads".
Also nobody yet pointed out Soviet Furs as unusual, so I might as well do it.
I mean, consider Ernst Rohm, who was open homosexual disdaining homosexuals, and tolerated until he was a threat to Hitler's power after 1933 as one of few Nazi leaders who had independent power base. "It's okay if we do it" mentality has been a thing in their circles.
anyway, they'd mental gymnastic around any eccentric behavior, as usual.
Nazi Furs actually don't surprise me much considering what I've read of some Nazis and KKK members, they got into really absurd rituals sometimes. If OG Nazi wore some costumes made of wolf skins in some groove I'd not bat eye.
not the best phrasing unless they're Jewish, and Roma, and disabled.

I have a prescription
who knows what would happen
and a pill that helps with overacidity of stomach
I take anti-depressants
I probably would fuck up myself if I took LSD now
I assume LSD might have its own combinations that are more dangerous than individual components.
I mean, one of people in my server threathened to mix his anti-psychotics with alcohol and we had to talk him out of it.
anti-depressants and anti-psychotics can go bad with other drugs
also the issue of mixing drugs with other medicals or drugs
"The most serious effects of LSD are likely to only happen after large and frequent doses, but they can be life-threatening."
the important thing is that people don't often know how to dose LSD
Risk of overdose is very low with LSD, and the risk of fatal overdose is essentially nonexistent. LSD is far from safe, however, especially considering the risky behaviors and side effects that can occur as a result of use. Users may experience trips lasting for 12 hours or more, often exhibiting low inhibition. Users may also have strong reactions to the drug‚Äôs hallucinatory effects. This may lead to dangerous actions and injury along with social, legal, and professional consequences. LSD is also dangerous when mixed with other drugs, especially Antidepressants such as Lithium. The most serious effects of LSD are likely to only happen after large and frequent doses, but they can be life-threatening. Extreme side effects may include hyperthermia, suicidal thoughts, and psychosis.
it can be psychologically addictive, mind you.
Gresham's law applies not only to the monetary market
heroin is on its own dangerous, and then you got shit like this.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polish_heroin
I will just say some people lost arms due to repeated use
the drug market desomorphine is injected as mix with iodine in much greater amounts of desomorphine than anything recommended.
desomorphine was created as more potent alternative to medical morphine and thus the legal desomorphine is prescribed rarely and in minute amounts.
it's super nsfw
don't look up effects of desomorphine on limbs
that can fuck up body physically
except those truly hard ones
I'm for drug decriminalization
~~if we were to be consistent about minors being forbidden taking psychoactives because the brains are still developing, then it should include also anyone college aged/before 25, but people would bitch too much I guess~~
in my country even ads for non-prescription drugs are required to include warning segments that you should first consult with a doctor. Of course people don't heed it for stuff like Paracetamol, but if headache and fever pills come with warnings, LSD should too.
this really should be something that 1) minors should be verboten from taking 2) should be regulated enough to come with all warnings and caveats about potential side effects.
already individual brains work differently enough without being immersed in psychoactive substances, so different brains, different reactions and stimuli from those substances
people should be advised that something *can* go wrong
my source is someone without "societal bias".
nah, it can actually fuck you up, depending on a person.
it's 4 AM here
anyway, you two argue, I'm hitting bed
Of course Mao got his thing, clout, and supported anti-Hungarian intervention, so it was indeed cold play.
the thing is that the gensec we wanted vs Khrushchov wanted weren't different much, so PRC's diplomatic support maybe saved us from further bloodshed in 1956 (but in the end Polish Politburo still sat down with Khrushchev and did the tense negotiations).
there's one cold political ploy on PRC's part that I historically appreciate, but they put more effort into it.

i.e. pressuring Khrushchov to take more conciliatory approach toward Poland instead of armed occupation to install gensec he wanted. Because Mao wanted to show they're peer to USSR.
rare W is basically new slang for broken clock moment.
btw, I doubt China speaking up too will discourage Putin much, but that's rare PRC W.

But my experience isn't comparable of course to what Ukrainians experience
We fear the possibility of Russia potentially victimizing us and see what's happening to Ukraine with worry and sympathy.
If we have some siege mentality, it's both residue of the utterly traumatic WW2 experiences and the increasing insecurity of our near neighborhood.
*Russian militarism problem
Nah, it's more the "we hear about Russia antagonizing our close ally on news every weak" problem.

and tbh Dobrzyca looks like it was air raided
the tornado ravaged a small town so much people thought that "Putin fired a ballistic missile"
we had a war panic in our county btw
first because they're ready to help during emergencies caused by nature and second because GROM bagged and tagged some of Balkan warcriminals to drag them to Hague and doesn't have a warcrime record itself.
and the special forces.
especially engineer troops.
our peacetime army is standing army and tbh I have respect for those who enlist.
And I don't mean 'border crises', flatout tanks rolling through border.
But then unthinkable, since if NATO country gets attacked, nukes will likely fly.
it's possible that in case of the unthinkable I will be called to do some non-frontline duty.
I got lowest passing grade that excluded me from peacetime service tho.
well, old enough to be classified
I'm a reservist
we should keep the standard of 'no highschool dropouts, and health is a factor too' for reserve too.
my only concern about any attempts to enlarge military pool here is some suggestions to lower standards for recruitment.
possible
my country has strict gun laws, but I think if we need a military reserve (which we might), we should loosen it.
expected to mobilize (which they have done right now)
since most of gun owners in Ukraine are reservists
Ukraine has also widespread gun ownership and Czech tier gun deaths, maybe the conclusion is that guns aren't dangerous societal ill when people are trained in responsibility
still, Czechs are golden standard how to keep widespread gun ownership without being paranoid over citizens owning guns, all while keeping gun deaths per capita low.
per capita it's now roughly similar, but i remember it used to be smaller in Czechia.
yeah, but suicides are the bulk of gun deaths in UK too
gun deaths
we also live by Russia and abolished conscription, so we should keep the knowledge how to use guns after ex-reservists  get too old.
> Sending arms or deploying Russian troops into Ukraine is unpopular ‚Äî and has only become more so as Russians tire of the war Moscow and its proxies have waged in eastern Ukraine since 2014. According to our latest survey of 3,245 Russians in December, just 8 percent think Russia should send military forces to fight against Ukrainian government troops there. Only 9 percent think Russia should train or equip separatist forces with Russian arms.
I asked for source, will get it once my other friend gives me
https://twitter.com/RALee85/status/1495654220288204800
there are also whistleblows reporting morale hitting incidents like this
my source is my friend telling me about reserve calls
From my interaction with Moscow resident, I have idea that the population is either apathetic or worried overall.
Putin called up 22+ reservists to conscription centers, and the occupied Oblasts conscripted 18 years olds and older (according to rumours winding up with 16-17 year olds because recruiters didn't presumably care about checking)
I'd not be so sure to lump the Russian conscripts with the Russian elites
given how much ruble plummeted, it might be now more like 1.2 x his monthly wage
he said it two days ago
mind you
Greece doesn't have any special vetting/screening of Sputnik recipients so he can afford going there. Well, "afford". Plane ticket worth his monthly salary.
He got vaxxed with Sputnik and let's just say lots of medical authorities are suspect of the vaccine, especially because there are varied reports on effectiveness and because Russia got angry at Brazil and Slovakia for asking questions.
Greece is his only option in EU.
I could see him getting a well paid factory job like one of my distant uncles.
He knows how to code with Python and program microcontrollers, so I told him it's a cruel farce that he's robbed of opportunities. He could have earned much more than me if he lived in same place.
he's lab technician without connections and can only afford frugal diet, rent, Internet, has to buy very used clothes and cannot afford going to doctor.
it's not just Ukrainians who are scared by the unfolding events, the person I mention is trying to find money equal to his monthly wage to move to Greece because he is afraid off all economic and political ramifications of what just happened (and he is also paranoid about his Discord messages)
the money for plane ticket

are Irish English?
they're not Russians
it'd be similar to Irish getting annexed back to an English state intent on eradicating all autonomy
because they're not Russians, they share similar identity defined by separation from Russia
including Russophonic Ukrainians
they would be subject to Russification in most likehood.
nations are societies that share similar identity and banded together.

USA considering a sanction that actually might be a blow in Russian gut without room for evasion
> The plan follows a relatively new playbook in the world of economic warfare, one that U.S. officials most recently used to target a Chinese telecommunications giant, Huawei.

Xi doesn't seem to be eager deep down about what has happened.
*In a readout of the call on state broadcaster CCTV, Xi pointed out that the "situation in eastern Ukraine has undergone rapid changes... (and) China supports Russia and Ukraine to resolve the issue through negotiation".

Russian forces have launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, unleashing air strikes and sending troops deep into the country, after weeks of diplomatic efforts failed to deter Putin from launching the military operation.

Beijing has trod a cautious diplomatic line on the crisis and refused to call it an "invasion" or condemn the actions of Russia, its close ally.

Xi said on the call with Putin it was important to "abandon the Cold War mentality, attach importance to and respect the reasonable security concerns of all countries, and form a balanced, effective and sustainable European security mechanism through negotiations".*
it is *small* sanction that's not called a sanction, but some pushback nonetheless.

Zelensky is prepared to die
The origin of the song is not clear, although Saint Adalbert is widely believed to be its author or contributor.[2][3] It heavily reflected Latin and Christian liturgy as a whole. The two initial stanzas were created first - possibly in the middle or at the end of the thirteenth century, or possibly at the very beginning of the fourteenth century.

Bogurodzica is a prayer hymn whose first stanza contains an invocation to Christ through the intercession of Mary. It begins with an apostrophe to her - to the Mother of Christ, the Virgin, praised by God, the chosen one. After the apostrophe, there is an appeal to Mary to win favour for people from her Son.

The second stanza begins with a direct addresses to Christ (called God's Son) - with an invocation to John the Baptist who can support human imploring. The prayer closing this stanza contains a request that Christ give people a blissful stay on Earth and, after death, everlasting existence in heaven. The subsequent stanzas develop various motifs such as Easter, the Passion of Jesus and litany - with invocations to the saints.

Bogurodzica was initially associated with religious mass and procession, however, by the fifteenth century it became a war hymn and a battle cry.

I have no doubt Putin dreams of resuming cultural genocide of Ukrainians like during Tzarism.
they basically Byelarussians and Ukrainians part of Russian world (in phrase very similar to one meaning "gathering of Rus lands", and deny Ukrainian nation's existence by calling them Little Russians.
Tzarist lingo
Rossiya vosstanavlivayet svoyu istoricheskuyu polnotu, *sobiraya russkiy mir*, russkiy narod vmeste ‚Äî vo vsey yego sovokupnosti velikorossov, belorusov i *malorossov*.
A new world is being born before our eyes. Russia's military operation in Ukraine has ushered in a new era - and in three dimensions at once. And of course, in the fourth, internal Russian. Here begins a new period both in ideology and in the very model of our socio-economic system - but this is worth talking about separately a little later.
Russia is restoring its unity - the tragedy of 1991, this terrible catastrophe in our history, its unnatural dislocation, has been overcome. Yes, at a great cost, yes, through the tragic events of a virtual civil war, because now brothers, separated by belonging to the Russian and Ukrainian armies, are still shooting at each other, but there will be no more Ukraine as anti-Russia. Russia is restoring its historical fullness, gathering the Russian world, the Russian people together - in its entirety of Great Russians, Belarusians and Little Russians. If we had abandoned this, if we had allowed the temporary division to take hold for centuries, then we would not only betray the memory of our ancestors, but would also be cursed by our descendants for allowing the disintegration of the Russian land.

they don't want their positions to be tracked by Russian intelligence (exactly because Ukrainian intelligence tracked many times positions of conscripts due to detecting them browsing Internet in unencrypted manner).
and let them phone their parents with less advanced phones
they take their smartphones to ofc prevent any leak of intel/recording stuff in bases sneakily
also btw, if you are curious about what Ukrainians do about phones of POWs
It's not completely possible to track every detail for sure, unlike with stuff that can be taken down directly from sites and online archives.
If you have doubts, that's fair.
<@!84811738653929472> Basically, I can't prove it to you for 100 %, but I have reasonable suspicions it could be true.
the story about being told it's exercises aligns with many other accounts of captured POWs.
hmm, seems like 1) the story is that the phone was taken from a dead Russian conscript killed in a skirmish 2) phone has visible wear and damage.
I could some reverse image search, though.
anyway, you have to take my word. I trust my two Russian speaking sources who don't even know each other.
not best example, since it's only somewhat longer

Bulgaria has been historically one of most Russia friendly countries.
you know when people hate Russia when it's Bulgaria of all countries that's so decisive.
even the Telegrams that are angry about sanctions hitting the members' wages are still blaming Putin
nobody can defend Putin without being trash, in my experience
seems like our tabloids are bringing it up for their anti-Putinist "celeb" campaigns
edit: sadly from 2018, I got mislead
the British guy is decade younger mind you, but Povetkin fared much worse than people expected and Joshua performed better than people suspected he would, since he he didn't have impressive record in two previous bouts.
Took giant L from a British boxer.
Povetkin is notoriously jingoistic Russian athlete who can't shut up about "genocide in Donbass" and praising Putin.
this brings me joy

someone took it for some reason or a bluster indeed

deleting the vid since there's now news about the announcement without having to look it up
well, sanctions are hitting everyone, but no one blamed Russian citizenry as a whole
also the message of collective responsibility is dumb
(also I made sure to tell people who posted it elsewhere to spoiler it with CW)
but there will be no doubt smaller attacks going on
we all agree it's bluster I feel
I see it as a way to sow panic
that's why I don't see it as a credible threat
i apologize in advance I didn't CW it immediately
anyway, the NSFW parts were like blink and miss for me
especially after that 20K credit cards getting hacked today
but it might sow extra panic in Russia (which is probably the point)
I hope they make the morally right choice. Even if motivated by utilitarianism and investment strategy. Because they will still back the victim here if they make such choice.
China isn't obligated to prop up Russia. It weighs now options, and Ukraine is right to send their best diplomats to meet with Chinese too.
A free Ukraine will rebuild and redirect some of exports originally directed to Russia to China and EU alike.
Now, if Ukraine stands free I doubt they will sell even bushel of grain to Belarus and Russia
looking at the import and export structure in 2019 it seems that Ukraine already sold a lot to China what people think Russia can export to China more, and Russia bought grain and coal and ore from Ukraine too in 2019, as much as China if not more.
just little comment
I need to go eat something
anyway, I don't want to talk more about this right now.
no problem
Kazakhstan is their natural ally right now.
it'd not bother China if Kazakhs had the seat.
the biggest twist would've been very unlikely scenario Kazakhstan gets security council and then China and Kazakhstan "abstain" to throw in unofficial support beyond resolution condemning Russia.
~~if we're technical it should have been Kazakhstan, which told Putin they won't help attack Ukraine~~
it's small contribution, but Taliban's central authorities seem to not care what individual members of their organization do for Ukraine if all rumours are true.
Taliban came from a split within the original anti-Soviet opposition after USSR evacuated.
well, Russia or rather its previous incarnation invaded Afghanistan.
The Internet experts have noticed how Taliban darknet is offering bomb making lessons to Ukrainian civilians, and there are rumours that there are Afghan volunteers, not just Czechen ones, fighting on Ukrainian side.
In practice?
Taliban expressed neutrality and concern for civilian casualties. Officially.
It's very telling that Vuciƒá said that it was a mistake to not listen to China's warnings about dependence on Russian resources.
My IR studying friend pointed out to me that Euroskeptic populists like Orban and Vuciƒá might gladly doubledown on increasing economic ties with China as Russia's economic grip on Europe shatters more and more.
Chinese won't blindly defend the rabid bear's behaviour. They are watching closely how to react for example to the fact that even Orban is abandoning ties with Russia.
I think even pro-Western Ukraine wouldn't be a bad outcome for China as long as they could resume their work on Road and Belt without Russia poking European hornet nest. After all, Xi Jinping met with our President a lot and we didn't want to side with Lithuania in their spat with China.
since Xi Jinping and Zelenskyy have courted each other for investments
China's ideal outcome would be sovereign Ukraine that doesn't pivot into Western sphere too much
(China is expressing basically concerns over fate of their nationals since Ukraine has been their investment hub and Putin's forces don't care about killing foreigners. And they might throw their diplomatic weight to help with potential peace negotiations which isn't insignificant. As amateur Sovietologist and PRLogist I'm aware the role of PRC in helping stop a 1956 invasion of Poland, and here we have China that's reaffirming diplomatic ties in open rather than in backroom of Soviet bloc like in October 1956)
Foreign Minister of the People's Republic of China Wang Yi assured Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba of China's readiness to make every effort to end the war on Ukrainian soil through diplomacy, including as a permanent member of the UN Security Council.

Kuleba emphasized China's distancing from the decision of Russian President Vladimir Putin to put the deterrent forces of the Russian army on a special combat alert regime, the press service of the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry reported on Tuesday.

The Chinese minister reaffirmed China's strong support for Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity, and noted the strategic nature of bilateral relations.

The Foreign Ministers also discussed security issues for the Chinese community in Ukraine. In this context, Kuleba stressed that the best guarantee of the security of Chinese citizens, as well as other foreign citizens in Ukraine, is the pressure of their governments on the Russian Federation to stop its armed aggression against our state, primarily the barbaric shelling of peaceful Ukrainian cities.
And Wang Yi and Kuleba's meeting was cautiously encouraging.
China is the master in this relationship, not economy smaller than Italy's.
I think we underestimate how much even China wants to tolerate Russia's bullshit.
Mashallah, I'm buying some Roshen for Easter if everything goes well (rip few hundred grams of lost weight)

I suppose their smuggling career is soon over, at least here, people started avoiding things that contribute to pockets of Putin and his allies.

talk with him about college football
since you can legit just

Trump praises Putin's invasion incoherently as some galaxy brained move.
He did. I mean Mahmoud's inability to log off, I doubt he does "university work" as he claims.
He tries to respond to like most tweets he gets, lmao.
People have compared him to Trump in the sense that he is as terminally online as Trump was.
Not someone I like in general because he is a conservative hardliner in Iranian context, but he has a broken clock moment I appreciate.
Because he keeps tweeting about sports on and on.
After stepping down as a president, he got some recognition in social media for getting pretty much addicted to Twitter.

I'm not convinced at all for crypto's overall advantage over currencies, but in this case, I will reiterate that I'm not picky at all as long as Ukrainians get some value out of donations.
It's wartime conditions.
because crypto might fluctuate a lot, but Rubel is in freefall.
that's poorest argument
well, if you try to help Russians fleeing too.
anything but Rubel tbh.
It's still money that helped a group of people move away from Moscow to Warszawa.
the last thing I participated was through Pay Pal so I'd not be surprised at all if PayPal skimmed off some through transfer fees, but whatever.
I'm not honestly picky about charity drives as long as they help.
That's good cause too.
what's the donations for, Ukraine?

there are some native Ukrainian speakers here, but the bulk of economic migration focused on places like Wroc≈Çaw in south-west Poland and we don't have very large cities by the eastern border.
huge 1 million (before war) seasonal diaspora that made up for our own seasonal diaspora in the Western Europe.

Also like the opening line of this argument is
Even if he does. The money still gets to people who need it, if nothing goes wrong?
Of Ukrainian hackers attacking Russian finances.
I hear the opposite stories.
Also are really state hackers of Russia scamming right now people who donate stuff?
I went with dollars since I'm not crypto user at all and that's what the person we helped specifically asked for.
Also, his choice? His money, his choice if he sends crypto or foreign currency.
Anyway, I'm tuning out since I have stuff to do but I consider anyone who helps with anything of value as contributing to the cause, so I won't like give a fuck about cryptocurrency fans doing stuff. At very worst they won't manage to help if there's some serious hurdle but we can't say they didn't try.
I mean like, my Russian friend still gets access to non-state media despite desperate attempts of Kremlin to cover up.
they're not really good at preventing non-state actors doing online stuff as of now
Russia can disable crypto easily
I don't think tbh
this aged very fine, unironically

according to Putin
Well, he "invented" Ukraine
my mom's history teacher said that Khrushchev was "the least revolting of gensecs" and that says a lot since he said it in early 1980s as a Solidarity activist.

I hope it's not USSR. Optics would be insanely awkward.

It will have to be a parallel structure like Solidarno≈õƒá was that opposes the government.

if they vote for a socialist, it won't be a Soviet relic I hope, and more like Zandberg who redeemed himself a lot in my eyes.

Do I dream of a new Novogrod? Yes, and I hope it will become more than my dream.
it's been stained by actions of Yeltsin and Putin
in event that Putin falls and Russia democratizes, I'd support dropping Russian flag altogether
1) the red is removed to protest bloodshed 2) the colors used are those in Novograd Veche's flag 3) the pattern of tricolour is modelled after the Byelarussian flag used before Lukashenko seized power.
the flag that protests adopted btw has many meanings

Yen-Rubel transactions got hit by sanctions too, I think.
Some dissenters and disgruntled citizens do want to escape RF and it's lucky I managed to send dollars along with other people before use of foreign currencies got penalized in lots of ways.
Also Yen can't be sent to Russia.
they largely got wiped out by now
apparently they just formed another PMC because Utkin run out of Wagner's soldiers.
Denazification of Russia first, maybe?
meanwhile one of Putin's oligarchs who runs PMC for him

The rest of history of PRL is more targeted harassing of dissidents and downright criminal economic decisions.
Here, the bulk of terror happened between 1945(44 if you count the provisional wartime government)-1949.
because the cautious numbers still don't paint most flattering picture
still awful system anyway
but Courtois was "editor"
And some of those people wrote the chapters in the book
Historian Andrzej Paczkowski wrote that "[s]ome critics complained that Courtois was 'hunting' for the highest possible number of victims, which led him, as J. Arch Getty wrote in the Atlantic Monthly, to include 'every possible death just to run up the score.' To an extent, the charge is valid. Courtois and other contributors to the volume equate the people shot, hanged, or killed in prisons or the camps with those who were victims of calculated political famines (in the Chinese and Soviet cases), or who otherwise starved for lack of food or died for lack of drugs."[9] Based on the results of their studies, Courtois estimated the total number of the victims at between 65 and 93 million, an unjustified and unclear sum according to Margolin and Werth.[17] In particular, Margolin, who authored the book's chapter on Vietnam, stated that "he has never mentioned a million deaths in Vietnam";[6] Margolin likened Courtois's effort to "militant political activity, indeed, that of a prosecutor amassing charges in the service of a cause, that of a global condemnation of the Communist phenomenon as an essentially criminal phenomenon."[3] Historians Jean-Jacques Becker and J. Arch Getty criticized Courtois[18]:‚Ää178‚Ää for failing to draw a distinction between victims of neglect and famine and victims of "intentional murder."[19]

Discord gave me some weird message
Another of his jobs was to sign hundreds of Party documents daily, a job he did for the next 20 years. Even after he became General Secretary of the Party, he continued to sign papers referring to the General Department (when he could no longer physically sign documents, a facsimile was used instead).
On Chernenko:
So was Andropov and Chernenko.
Brezhnev was a good example of careerist.
Lenin, Stalin and Khruschov were zealots (Nikita genuinely bought into his claims of pursuing communism).
everything else listed usually was for more serious causes
the dumbest example
Australia
On 1 January 2022, an Australian man self-immolated to protest the COVID-19 vaccine mandates and vaccine IDs. He was later taken to the hospital.[35]
because it only kills or cripples the protester (some get saved) and it's very media attracting act
but some suicidal desperate protester do it
it's awful way to go
Soviet Bloc
In 1968 the practice spread to the Soviet bloc with the self-immolation of Polish accountant and Armia Krajowa veteran Ryszard Siwiec, as well as those of two Czech students, Jan Palach and Jan Zaj√≠c, and of toolmaker Ev≈æen Plocek, in protest against the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia. As a protest against Soviet rule in Lithuania, 19-year-old Romas Kalanta set himself on fire in Kaunas. In 1978 Ukrainian dissident and former political prisoner Oleksa Hirnyk burnt himself near the tomb of the Ukrainian poet Taras Shevchenko protesting against the russification of Ukraine under Soviet rule.
it's a self-sacrificial tactic often encountered in countries influenced by Buddhism and Hinduism, and in Eastern Europe.
set yourself on fire
On 10 September 2019, the Udmurt activist Albert Razin self-immolated in front of the regional government building in Izhevsk as it was considering passing the controversial bill to reduce the status of the Udmurt language.[74] Between 2002 and 2010 the number of Udmurt speakers dwindled from 463,000 to 324,000.[75]
Modern Russia 2018‚Äìpresent
On 19 June 2018, the Russian State Duma adopted a bill that made education in all languages but Russian optional, overruling previous laws by ethnic autonomies, and reducing instruction in minority languages to only two hours a week.[62][63][64]
btw, Putin adopted Russification
Khrushchov and Brezhnev tamed active Russification but didn't discard it.
but compared to the Tzarist and Stalinist Russification, it was a step forward
because it also favored the official nationality of SSRs and ASSRs over the non-Russian ethnic minorities
mixed legacy
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korenizatsiya
Stalin had also big brain plans as minister of minorities to just lump Azerbeijan, Georgia and ARmenia into Transcaucasian entity (but got pushback since he wasn't the chief oligarch at that point)
rather than largely peaceful secession
or USSR would collapse in much more violent manner
and Ukraine SSR didn't have much autonomy, though it wasn't Lenin who resumed Russification but Stalin
Ukrainian national identity is much older
Pretty much people in the know about global wheat market hope that 2022 will be a good year for wheat elsewhere and not like 2021
Ukraine exported lots of grain to both Russia and MENA
Reminder we won't likely get harvest in Ukraine which means MENA and Russia will suffer from wheat shortages.
Putin is really wanting to fuck over as much people as possible.
Poland's major trade partner, with successful and relatively large diaspora living in our cities...

Well, fuck.
the communist country we have *real* large ties with is Vietnam
not any significant part of our economy, but bizarre, creepy rich assholes.

the only members of a Polish-Korean Association I confirmed is a politician who owns orchard, ex-director of state factory in communist era, said director who worked for state railways, few lecturers, and a homeopathy promoter.
yeah, just a small club, and some are businessmen ironically enough. Plus there are 5 % Poles who said that they view Polish-North Korean relations as positive in a 2013 survey. Though I can't tell you if there are pro-Kim or just can't show it on map.
or when a director of strategy of our state railways turned out to be a sleeper North Korean agent belonging to a pro-Juche club and meeting six times with Kims, even receiving a medal once.
very negligible impact on our economy, but there have been scandals in our past like the "contract workers" in shipyards and orchards.
there's something on wikipedia that we used ruble as currency
I need to research but my country and North Korea's trade might be jeopardized if I read 1992 treaty correctly (RIP Bozo if so).

USSR had much more military resources at disposal, including WarPac countries in case of 1968.
and implies more that he is disconnected from reality
well, if Putin indeed expected the war to be like 1956 and 1968 then it explains a lot of things.
but it's good breakdown on VDV specifically
he will write more threads explaining some of his further takes
it's a good thread on VDV

Their mass use was similar to how USSR quelled Hungary and Czechoslovakia's rebellion.
VDV are not elite super soldiers, they are suppression corps.
Like the mass use of VDV
some analysts point out how the Russian planning basically incorporated lots of contempt and expectations that Ukraine will be intimidated and people won't resist fiercely.
EU and NATO got much more unified than people expected.
I also think Chinese hardliners that have been fueling wolf warrior diplomacy a lot might be somewhat discredited.
I read about the meetings as fast as they concluded because Polish newspaper I follow got news on Wang Yi and Kuleba faster than the likes of Reuters.
anyway, I had good hunch that Kuleba and Wang Yi's meetings were important news.
Not so simple, considering how war will wreck the industry and agriculture no matter outcome.
we have significant and dynamically growing economic ties with Ukraine, so it's not only a matter of security for us.
Roshen has been making huge gains in our sweet market.
Though parts of it must be chocolate.
we buy more food from Ukraine than we sell.
which means less wheat for China, potentially, hurting Russian revenues.
And Zelenskyy has been a major promoter of Road and Belt.
Ukraine exported grain, iron ore and jet engines to China.
btw, not really that much of surprise
we need to destroy the economy
freezing assets and other limpwristed measures won't work
Ukraine's gonna be worse
We must inflict as much pain on Russia as it's reasonably possible to punish them for the biggest land war in Europe since 1945.

This is an existential war for Ukraine.
especially if justified suspicions that Putin aims for Russification are true.

I helped a person and their family evacuate along with other Discorders, I warned another about credit card leaks asap.
I did as much already as I can to help evade sanctions and the pain for people I know. So I wash off my hands since I can't do more.
not a big sample, but I don't either think the kind of Russians who brigade video game servers are the face of Russian nation.
every educated Russian I know dreams of leaving and one have left already.
I also think Putin is scared of the brain drain
I probably gonna vote on Socialists here out of sheer spite to the positions taken by ProgIntl they left and so on. They're also on board with nothing short but total economic war.
If we let them get away with it, who next? Russia finishing off Georgia? Bulldozing Moldavia for sake of their rogue satellite in Transnistria?
I oppose Blue Laws since they don't work anyway
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_law
weirdest thing about our socialists is that they support Blue Laws like conservatives.
Then we can maybe have eventually some normality and go back to more boring poltics.
if I'm told by opposition next elections to vote on a particular socialist, I will. Whoever can contest a local seat best.
true one, at least, said whacky ancap party is controlled pretty much.
the opposition tries their hardest to work against conservatives
see above
Senate is FPTP and opposition controlled because the left and the center formed electoral pact.
Sejm is proportional
we don't have FPTP. We have a mixed system.
liberal vote is split between few parties, socialists and social democrats stick together because they must.
socialists, social democrats, liberals.
There's Korwin-Mikke, our Zhirinovsky, Braun who is an open absolute monarchist but for Jesus, and Bosak who doesn't hide much he is a fascist who likes Spanish Falanga and Leon Degrelle.
I mean, one of their main leaders wants to implement theocracy with Jesus as head of state. I mean Braun.
because they think libertarianism is no taxes and taking heroin while being super conservative on everything else.
our "libertarians" don't have normal dovish position and were made to shut up and backtrack because they really like Russia.
or why our most normal dovish position is socialists arguing for keeping NATO expenditure to promised minimum (until war broke out next door).
or why our "libertarians" are not libertarian at all but basically far right authoritarians except on drugs and masks and seatbelts.
like American conservatives might be baffled why our conservatives are heavily into economic statism for example.
anyway, Poland's overton window is its own beast and I see foreigners confused sometimes.
from socialist/social democrat to liberal spectrum
Beer Party's MPs just split as it ceased to exist, some are actually in politics still.
established by a comedian who ran as a joke
for real
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beer_Lovers_Party_(Russia)
Russia had a sister party before Russian democracy withered into current controlled theater.
The Polish Beer-Lovers' Party (PPPP; Polish: Polska Partia Przyjaci√≥≈Ç Piwa) was a satirical Polish political party that was founded in 1990 by satirist Janusz Rewi≈Ñski. Originally, the party's goal was to promote cultural beer-drinking in English-style pubs instead of vodka and thus fight alcoholism.[1]

The humorous name and disillusionment with Poland's political transformation led some Poles to vote for the party.[2] The nature of the party's appeal to its supporters was reflected in frequently-heard remarks that maybe with the PPPP at the helm "it wouldn't be better but for sure it would be funnier".[3]

So he just randomly came up with Japan.
The truth is he came up "with building second Japan" because he couldn't say he wants obviously European country when he was being asked in 1980.
you might know Lech Wa≈Çƒôsa
He was a blue collar guy known for gaffes.
He never have been to Japan until later. Nor knew how computers worked until later.
he wanted computers. Simple as.
our first democratic president rambled he wants to turn Poland into Second Japan.
it was 2005 when I learned full story
I don't know, I haven't met them since Grandpa's funeral.
his parents used to praise the "smarter" twin as example because being a blue collar is a bit of stigma.
His twin, who did Ph.D in literature, runs a movie rental business.
basically ending up overseeing the technical aspects of factory rather than operating machines.
one of my distant uncles learned that despite having no academic education and ended up being middle-level manager in a factory.
His dreamed job is doing academics even if it pays less.
He sees himself more like a scientist than a coder.
but he wants it.
he knows Python and how to program microcontrollers, he doesn't *need* Ph.D.
but he can make it I feel
that's rather old for starting Ph.D
he is in late 30s.
he plans to start Ph.D here
He had no connections
how he put it: enough for rent, Internet, frugal diet, used clothes, and avoided doctors.
he was stuck down doing dead-end job for a laboratory
Moscow
*before* war
127 $ a month
but earned pitiful wage in Russia
because he's industrial programmer
good for my Moscow friend
that Jaruzelski would ignore election results and roll out tanks, because our elections taking place on the same day as Tiananmen massacre was ominous.
There was btw genuine fear after June 4 1989
Well, in 1956 Gomu≈Çka was also ready to make it bloody and started arming workers and rolling out Shermans in case Nikita didn't want to negotiate. We avoided Hungary variant twice by being obstinate enough.
Because he had enough balls to tell Brezhnev and Suslov that if they wouldn't let PZPR do martial law and go with Ustinov's idea of USSR invasion, then Soviet soldiers will go back in bodybags loaded on trucks instead on planes like in Afghanistan.
I think the most underrated gensec of ours was Kania.
Gierek was found walking on all his fours through the streets of Warszaw and gathering rocks. The despairing Central Committee doesn't know what to do, they phone Brezhnev. They hear someone talking in the background, then finally Brezhnev answers:
- Polish comrades, don't worry, we accidentally uploaded to him the software of our Lunar Rover.
Gierek even gave concessions Brezhnev didn't ask in advance for.
Polish communists didn't like Soviets much and wanted their own brand of authoritarianism, Bierut and Gierek were exceptional for their bootlicking.
Bierut was an eager disciple of Stalin, Rokossowski just merely objected on technical grounds since he was a Soviet marshall.
yeah, that's Rokossowski, not Bierut.
Breaking rules of conspiracy, Kosowicz, a Home Army courier, decided to go to Bierut to request food for a starving Polish family he befriended. He was warned by a friend that Bierut is a Pole pretending to be a Byelarusian and "unfriendly piece of shit." Kosowicz recounts the following: "His two young assistants led me to their boss. His office was large, decent looking for the ruined Minsk's standards: an office desk, chairs, a table. The wall was adorned with... a giant portrait of Hitler."
Gomu≈Çka when asked by Turlejska whether Bierut was ordered by Soviet intelligence to collaborate with Hitlerite regime, he denied that without hesitation: "Not at all. I am convinced he did it on his own initiative. But when in middle of 1943 it turned out that Russians are winning, he decided to leave as soon as possible. Minsk's inhabitans considered him a collaborator. I had evidence. After 1956 I received a letter from a Byelarussian communist who asked why we didn't unmask that traitor Bierut who committed war crimes and requisitioned property and so on. >>We know him well at Byelarus>> - he assured. I asked Khrushchev what to do. He told me to leave the matter alone, so I put the letter into a safe."
Whom Stalin whisked away because first two secretaries of PPR died and he didn't trust Gomu≈Çka.
Not even just communists, we know now that he was a Nazi collaborator between 1941 and 1943.
I don't believe in sincerity of objections, since Bierut was piece of shit who pined for bootlicking bigger dictators.
We reversed Stalinization of economy in 1956
but I remember Ochab shittalking Comecon but that was 1956
I don't remember reading about it
like trying to build factories near Catholic pilgrimage spots
I know, but our Stalinists kinda tried to double down to own "reactionaries"
our only substantial military production deal happened in 1986
1954 <:smw:809665016529420307>
oh yeah, we only started selling weapons in
And we didn't even send war material to North Korea I think, it was just cover for doubling the military and creating financial crisis for few years.
The First Plan was much more balanced than later plans.
Our Stalinists lowkey used Korean War as excuse to overly focus on heavy industry we didn't need.
I only view Polish-North Korean relations as a stain.
Well, and humanities, that's why there's a lot of Polish works of literature already translated to Vietnamese.
In fields of mining, shipbuilding and medicine.
We basically also helped them educate some of their higher ed people.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poland%E2%80%93Vietnam_relations
We have third largest Vietnamese diaspora in Europe.
and we're Vietnam's main partner within EU right now.
fastest growing ASEAN country
and yet, Vietnam and Japan are still more firm trade partners as of now.
In 2016, Poland's President Andrzej Duda met with China's leader and general secretary of the Communist Party of China, Xi Jinping,[11][12] saying that "Polish companies will benefit hugely" from China's Belt and Road Initiative.[13] Duda and Xi signed a declaration on strategic partnership in which they reiterated that Poland and China viewed each other as long-term strategic partners.[14]
Seems like we're busy enough trading with Japan and Vietnam.
We're one of those few post-communist countries who don't seem to pivot much to China.
In 2017, Japan became the second largest foreign investor in Poland in terms of total investment value, only behind the United States.[8]

I'll trust a Sovietologist over a layman.
"The word soviet refers to the council of deputies, as in Petrograd soviet; when capitalized, Soviet refers to the state or government (e.g., the Soviet Union, or Soviet people)."
nah, some Sovietologists like Suny distinguish between soviet and Soviet.
cafeteria intelligentsia and bank robbers seizing the state apparatus and excluding other parties
It was government by party oligarchy
I prefer writing soviets with downcase letter btw, because Soviet implies Soviet Union had anything to do with soviets
He literally chastised Stalin and Kamenev upon arrival for acting too conciliatory in his opinion.
It was because Lenin seized chance to do what he long planned. He never wanted to cooperate with PG.
so massive electoral victory can be called mogging
it escaped into meme vernacular recently
mogging someone = achieving more pronounced muscle mass than a rival bodybuilder
bodybuilding slang
soviets committed to respect Constitutional Assembly, and of course Bolsheviks malded they got mogged by SRs in elections to it despite SRs having uphill battle due to Bolsheviks controlling cities.
> One of the main reasons for the collapse of the government was that the Soviets were pissed off at it, and there's really no reason why electoral democracy should be given precedent over the form of worker democracy that was active in the Soviets at the time.
He dissolved the government only because provgov had no real reach outside soviets and Bolsheviks controlled Petrograd and Moscow ones. They didn't control rural soviets, those that held more sway over general population at the time.
Marxists always on their way to screw peasants and small towners.
actual F to Right SRs, closest thing to our original PSL.
Left SRs joined up with Bolsheviks malding about getting less seats than SRs too, and then got their face eaten by leopard. RIPBozo
Right SRs (so basically all the relevant ones) under Chernov formulated a third path that collapsed early on.
it's not black and white, no pun intended, struggle
if you think SRs and Mensheviks were Whites, you're literally parroting Leninist propaganda.
Samara Directory got overthrown by Whites
yes, the Mensheviks and SRs were socialists
so thoroughly that I joke to ex-Moscow resident that they could as well change the flag to <:Russianprotestflag:948926425539412018> if they pull off the unlikely.
at this point I honestly don't even know if Russians are capable of something beyond a palace coup, the whole edifice would have to be torn down.
both Lenin and Yeltsin destroyed any semblance of democracy by turning on the parliaments
yeah, very repressed.
it was overwhelmingly leftist in nature without counting Bolsheviks (and Bolsheviks had like 1/4 of vote)
Bolsheviks basically threw a hissy fit that SRs and their allies had somewhat of majority.
this would actually likely be not disbanded by Bolsheviks
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Constituent_Assembly
take out Bolsheviks out of equation and it'd be down to SRs and Mensheviks (I don't think Whites would win regardless).
shame Lenin was too fast when that one time mob tried to lynch him when tabloids revealed he was shipped to Russia by Germans.
then October happened
the best shot Russia sadly had at a democracy was 1917
It goes back much further
and by Muscovy I mean all the abominable legacy that Ivan Kalita and his successors brought to the region as Princes of Muscovy
that's why I say it will sadly stand, even if things change.
reject Russia, return to Rus.
Russians should look up to Novgorod rather than Muscovy, and the anti-war protesters do.
centuries of oppressive rule and their bulldozing of more egalitarian rivals poisoned the political well until we got where we are.
It needs to reject lots of its legacy, just like Germany had to go cope with it.
sadly Kremlin will still stand, yeah, despite being intertwined with all that went wrong about Muscovy.
it's Turkish
>Hagia Sophia
increasingly also looks like the reputation of their hard power is waning with every day they struggle to defeat Ukraine.
and ineffective soft power is basically no soft power
the finest moments of Russia are from people who opposed the very things Russian establishment stands for
yeah, and that history and current actions doesn't endear people to them.
they discarded cultivating any soft power they could have in order to focus on blackmail and now direct war.
yet they alienate everyone they don't puppet directly.
what soft power?
we've started as the source of labor pool and place to which production was outsourced, so access to imports and labor pool elsewhere wasn't why we progressed.
a campaign that worked out for my country relatively well. Theory =/= execution.
that Russia has been controlled by Yeltsin and then Putin is not the fault of the liberalization, they started career as Bolsheviks.
the countries that remained democracies after initial liberalization generally improved their lot
but freed my country
yeah, you have probably lived in developed world all time, so you don't have perspective on how collapse of the Soviet system gave many families opportunity for better life.
Honestly I bet Czernov is looking for Bolshevik Old Guard in heaven and the are only there those from Baku who accepted election results because the rest are in Hell.
and when a dictator that finally decided to poke the nest appeared, thanks to the structures Lenin set up, millions got brutalized.
all Lenin did for them was stamping out their representation in politics
since peasants redistributed land on their own without waiting for Bolsheviks
a leap of quality of life that'd happen anyway
gotta bend mind to defend a dictator who squashed potential for more peaceful socialist movement.
eulogy of Lenin does that instead
üêì moment
'kay, vatnik.
I will honestly not stand here for any apology of Lenin.
Bukharin wanted to modify it, Stalin too until he adopted Left position to outmanouver Bukharin.
never trust communists with lives of peasants
as always
yeah, and abolishing it led to misery
Yeah, who cares, you're outing yourself as dictator apologist either way
literally wanted to abolish NEP and collectivize agriculture too
Trot apologist detected
> I believe Trotsky was the preferred leader and most likely would have continued to lead in a very similar way. Which constituted in one of the largest increases in quality of life ever seen in any nation in history.
He even invented vanguardism as a concept in Marxism.
That the Bolshevik party was an oligarchy with strong centralizing tendencies is his damn fault
If not Stalin, then Trotsky or Bukharin who weren't certainly wholesome at all.
He should be blamed for what he set up.
Why we are surprised that structures set up by a top party oligarch gave way to more party oligarchs in his wake and eventually someone emerged as top one too (but disposed of others later than suborning them).
Evolution rather than accident of history.
Lenin helped forged structures that enabled rise of Bukharin and Stalin after his death. I see him complicit in what happened later.
People's Commissar for Nationalities was a vital post.
if not him, then Bukharin or Trotsky.
Stalin wasn't a fluke
there were other party oligarchs
stop whitewashing a dictator
Stalin's rise to power was enabled by the structures set up by fucking Lenin
lolwhut
Implying continuity is an insult to original soviets and peasant communes.
He betrayed workers and peasants, kicked out other parties, turned the system into one led by party bureaucracy upper class.
for all intents and purposes? yes.
Helps dispel pop history notions that Bolsheviks dominated the structures before their power grabs.
Suny clearly cares about distinguishing soviets from the entrenched Bolshevik-led Soviet government, and I find that useful.
because there have been two
which Soviet?
soviet is a form of organization
soviet and Soviets should be distinguished
>unanimous

we can't say we didn't try to reason and facilitate some exchange
tfw we've showed goodwill to Russia, Byelarussia and Ukraine in the past with those border agreements, but basically the first two spurned it.
Again, more like trade and diplomacy loving Novgorodians than Kalita's goons
but again it'd have to be more democratic Russia.
If it integrated with the world beyond blackmailing countries with gas then we maybe would see something different.
Not my fault liberalism lives rent free in your mind.
liberal and illiberal democracy are terms I didn't coin.
liberal and illiberal democracies are terms divorced from political spectrum
that's why I mean by illiberal
it's about as free as Hungary
Which is somewhat illiberal, but considering my country is in EU and NATO while PiS is in power I can't throw rocks.
Current
but a Bolivia situation could've been great

on another topic, but still related
Sanctions and increasing economic isolation helped squeeze South Africa.
Squeeze the economy, help Ukrainians send as many conscripts in bodybags they can, First Czechen War was stopped by public outrage.
But the number of arrested is now the range of tens thousands
the point is to make them rise up, and if they don't rise due to sanctions only applied because Putin shot first, then the nation might be pretty hopeless.
You clearly then don't care about Ukrainian working class. Naomi Klein moment.
Existential one for Ukrainians, especially.
This is a war.
But whatever happens, I at least have clear conscience that we're not doing limpwristed shit like just seizing assets and freezing them.
The more crippled economy, the less room to fund that war machine.
And to protect Ukrainians from cultural genocide.
I view this in a lens of protecting my country's neighbor because we might be next.
If there's no palace coup or people rising like in 1905-6 then we can still grind their MIC to halt.
honestly what happens to the poor in Russia too doesn't anymore enters my equations as long as Russians are shelling the women and children in Kharkiv and Kiev. We should accept those who want and can ditch the speeding train. We should only care about sanctions that hurt the state the most and its capacity to wage war. If line goes down in Russia, then eh.
we can't march into Mi≈Ñsk and Kr√≥lewiec without risking nuclear escalation, so we do what we can.
*maximise consequences for Russia
"Oh dear, we've turned them from billionaires to... millionaires?"
I prefer killing the oligarchs while they are on board
economic war is our only solution due to lack of non-MAD military option.
I care more about starving the beast to the point it's incapable of waging a war
seizing and freezing assets would've been just a slap on the wrist.

actual socialist, unlike most of Marxist-Leninist creatures.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacek_Kuro%C5%84
our first democratic labour and social policy minister was this guy
Our "developed socialist" Marxist-Leninist government pretended unemployment didn't exist (but you were barred from employment if you were a dissident, so called wolf's ticket) so post 1989 cabinet introduced unemployment benefits first
If socialism is having more robust welfare system.
Ironically my country is now more socialist than before 1989.
my argument is what humanity can create or develop is necessarily natural to humanity. Well, if there will be ever any viable self-declared communist society that doesn't spiral into dystopia due to vanguardism, then we can talk about it being more than hypothetical construct. (well, Soviets called themselves "developed socialist state" because they were afraid that calling themselves communist would deprive them of arguments that prosperity and victory is just around the corner, but I digress.)
Because neither states had to rely on feudal levies when you could train a peasant or city commoner how to shoot in few days and popular uprisings became suddenly more dangerous.
Helped to curb the power of feudalism.
Guns had some good impact in long-term.
Not a deity bestowing them from above.
Because humans created those later systems.
it's not natural feels to me like a cope.
maybe it's not so unnatural for hierarchies to exist, to a point.
like terrestial hunter-foragers are more egalitarian than fishing focused hunter-foragers, at least in New Guinea.
we btw genuinely have been researching *inequalities* within different types of pre-agricultural societies.
fr fr the idealization of pre-agricultural societies smells similar to me like those noble savage archetypes.
in power vacuum, hierarchies tend to establish themselves.
If you think tribalism is bad now, then back then pretty much contacts with other tribes pretty much devolved into fierce competition over limited resources.
I also would not express nostalgia for pre-agricultural times.
I'd not want a world government, period.

here's hope wartime boost recedes eventually but Konfa stays under 5 %
the good news is that Konfederacja slipped under the treshold fucking finally
the bad news is that PiS is basically getting wartime popularity boost
it'd be less easy to manipulate the public if everyone abstained
because of course our state media lie that the EMPs who abstained voted yes
should have been abstain, it's not like they would affect the vote and that would probably give less fuel for state-aligned media.
only regret I have is that Polish opposition EMPs voted a mix of yes and abstain
I'd say they should have had some foresight, but we know how many people believed Putin was posturing.

Beta Israel didn't want to stay in the country and it took international diplomatic pressure for Mengistu to let them leave.
You know they left Ethiopia because of worsening political situation there?
if EJ and GH applied all for citizenship (which they could), it'd not change things on its head.
The Arabs living in East Jerusalem and the Druze in the Golan Heights, occupied by Israel in the Six-Day War of 1967 and later annexed, have the right to apply for citizenship, are entitled to municipal services and have municipal voting rights.[21] Both groups have largely foregone applying for Israeli citizenship, with the Palestinians of East Jerusalem and the Syrians of the Golan mostly holding residency status.
some are already accounted for as citizens 

The Arab citizens of Israel[3] are citizens of Israel who identify themselves as Arab. These include Palestinians, the Negev Bedouin, Druze people and Christian and Muslim Arabs who do not identify as Palestinians.
and have played kingmaker roles several times in history of Knesset
and have their own parties
Israeli Arabs vote
I don't think the situation is hopeless because Ireland, North Ireland and rest of UK reached rapprochement.
I have feeling they might want things that won't pass in Israel and I'm not talking about withdrawing from West Bank for example.
Even if the Israeli society completely secularizes they will be still Jews, it's an ethnicity.
Jews have long history of being mistreated in diaspora and at some point part of the world have wanted to annihilate them (and some countries still threaten that in rhetoric). So things like law of return and the fact it's a nation state won't go away.
Israel won't stop emphasizing their national identity just like my country won't.
not referring to you
Whole generations have lived and died there living their lives.
That Israel has some shitty laws doesn't invalidate its legitimacy.
doesn't make its existence unjustified.
UK actually tried to restrict migration to the region at many points.
A Jew is an ethnicity too.
It's not like they were put there, lots of fled there because post-war Europe was still hostile place, especially Soviet bloc, and there was sizable enough Jewish presence before WW2 that Jewish orgs and communities had their own paramilitaries
If Jewish state didn't come into existence with assistance of UN partition plan (accepted by Jews but rejected by Arab communities) it'd come one way or another.
Zionism and Jewish presence in the region is older than 1940s

The scholars accuse the Russian Orthodox Church of ‚Äúethno-phyletism‚Äù or ‚Äúreligious nationalism‚Äù‚Äî a practice outlawed by an Orthodox  church council in 1872 as ecclesial heresy. The council ruled that the Orthodox Church must not be connected with the fate of a single nation or race.
‚ÄúTherefore,‚Äù they write, ‚Äúwe reject the ‚ÄúRussian world‚Äù heresy and the shameful actions of the Government of Russia in unleashing war against Ukraine which flows from this vile and indefensible teaching with the connivance of the Russian Orthodox Church, as profoundly un-Orthodox, un-Christian and against humanity, which is called to be ‚Äújustified‚Ä¶ illumined‚Ä¶ and washed in the Name of our Lord Jesus Christ and by the Spirit of God‚Äù (Baptismal Rite). Just as Russia has invaded Ukraine, so too the Moscow Patriarchate of Patriarch Kirill has invaded the Orthodox Church, for example in Africa, causing division and strife, with untold casualties not just to the body but to the soul, endangering the salvation of the faithful.‚Äù

can we sanction it, please?
is so export focused
if their sugar beets industry
wait
wait
apparently, the export margin has been so high because the sugar consumption is low in Russia (I bet it's Muscovites and Petersburgians who consume plurality of it even if not majority), so I guess the countryside and less developed towns will continue to get by.
It's like Russia is a major fossil fuel producer, but there are invading units that struggle with fuel supply chain.
in doubt, I will just blame it on corruption I guess.
Reuters claimed in 2020 that Russia has reserves of sugar to last to 2025.
Or maybe sugar processing industry has withered like in Poland in 1990s?
I wonder why there are sugar lines in Moscow, then, supply line issues ~~like their army's~~ or the companies bet on importing sugar from overseas?
https://www.tridge.com/stories/sugar-beet-production-remains-sweet-in-russia
Pockets of developed world in sea of developing world (and very creepily, the Russian and Brazil GDP overlap in sync, rising and falling together. But since Brazil haven't done yet anything so stupid like Russia now, Russia GDP will go significantly under Brazil. Unless Bolso does something very stupid in last weeks of office, like doing martial law or invading Venezuela, I suppose.)
Reminder that lots of Russians can't actually afford lots of such Western stuff. Russia is like Brazil of Europe.
I mean, urban Russians still complain about all those companies withdrawing, but for the Russians living outside largest metropolitan areas the brands disappearing don't make difference unless it leads to lack of essential stuff.
I won't say the M-word though, the more colorful name

so called warm ice cream
unless eating stuff like this is extra torture we shouldn't subject anyone to <@!203444794737950720>
people will get creative
as for less essential products...
so Nestle's disappearance would be honestly opportunity for those few Russian companies that focus on the essential stuff.
like InfaPrim for baby formulas.
yeah, but I already researched that absolutely essential products of Nestle have domestic competition in Russia.
(when cacao was in shortage, state companies and the few remaining private producers got creative)
(I mean, the "chocolate-like product" has been a butt of jokes in the former Soviet bloc. So I'm like "oh, then it could be back to the old, huh?")
If they don't, then my condolences, it means they're worse at it than Kazakhstan and Ukraine then.
because Russia for 100 % produces their own chocolate and ersatz chocolate.
I'm just arguing that Nestle's disappearance from the market wouldn't impact the essential production and just make some of more luxurious food inaccessible or at least brands.
Infaprim, a Russian baby food company, has been bragging long before the war that lawmakers are supporting granting them extra incentives, so yeah, unless they need to import some components for the baby food formulas, they will be fine.
about infant food, I know Russia has been boosting domestic production, so Nestle's disappearance wouldn't be issue.
Soviet Union later and now Russia is actually decent at producing food for the wider society, it's just shortage of imported brands and more exotic components outside their climate that might be issue.
There haven't been famine in the region since 1947.
and even then, if they failed to produce chocolate, it'd be like back to 1980s when people got by without stuff like chocolate.
Nestle stopping operating would just mean lack to access to particular brands from West
they have domestic corps producing all that stuff like chocolate, just like other post-Soviet countries often have
In 2016 Russia gained and exceeded Soviet grain production levels,[28] and in that year became the world's largest exporter of wheat.[3]
like the looming food price crisis in MENA and Africa is projected to be caused by both the war in Ukraine and the fact Russian *exports* of food will likely drop
aren't they self-sufficient in the basic foodstuffs?

I know I proposed to sanction their sugar exports since the agroindustry produces beets for exports, but damn, they are self-owning themselves first.
>Russia running out of sugar when they're major exporters of sugar beets and have had good harvests for past 7 years.
> We're getting more reports about rationing of some staple foods in Russia. There has been particular demand for sugar.

> In the far eastern Maritime Region, supermarkets have imposed limits of 2kg per customer for sugar, flour, rice, buckwheat, salt and macaroni; 2L of vegetable oil and three jars of baby food. The rationing was reported by Russia‚Äôs business daily Kommersant.

> In Khabarovsk, a city in that region, there has been panic-buying of sugar, and it has disappeared from many supermarket shelves, a local news agency reports.

> However, deputy industry and trade minister Viktor Yevtukhov insists ‚Äúthere is no problem with sugar‚Äù, as Russia produces enough for itself and has banned sugar exports.

> The St Petersburg supermarket chain Vkuster told Kommersant that it was also limiting sugar sales to 2kg per customer. ‚ÄúWhen one customer fills a whole basket with bags of sugar, others look at him and think about stockpiling too,‚Äù said Vkuster director Sergei Plis.

but we must crush Russian economy
it can't get worse
Which is why we shouldn't be concerned about full economic war against Russia
There's significant rally around the flag effect in Russia.
Thankfully I don't think it will come to nuclear war.
The tragic thing about it is that all my speculations on what Russians will do are coming true. I found those mobile crematoria disturbing, was creeped out by "Greater Russian" rhetoric of the leaked speech (and now the RIA Novosti are publishing similar screeds openly), then indiscriminate shelling started and I knew back in my mind it's not worst to come.
Who fights by the sword, dies by the sword. Those officers and units who consciously murdered women, men and little children should be executed for example to be set, by a public tribunal. I'm against capital punishment normally but for such atrocities proved beyond doubt.
significant portions of the society are ultranationalists and we must come to terms with that.
Russia needs to be kicked out of Ukraine and all war criminals we can capture be brought to justice.
And I know potentially that could've been done to my country.
I border Russia.
The world clearly forgot that phrase of "Never again." We need to set a new example how to treat mass murderers like those.
IMO life penalty doesn't cut it, we should restore capital punishment like for Nuremberg.
at least they're making it easier for Ukrainians to decide who is gonna hang from gallows after their tribunal gets to prosecute captured soldiers.

They need to rot in Hague.
What Ukrainians should do is absolutely refuse to give up those POWs who are caught doing warcrimes.
Sadly though majority of warcrimes in Bucha and Irpin have been done by VDV and those fuckers are official combatants
doing Czechenya and the parts of the world where Wagner mercs operate a favor. A delayed justice.
Ukrainians can probably get away with not taking them POW.
you know, Wagnerites and Kadyrov's boys are mercenaries and thus not protected by Geneva conventions and international law, I heard....
this time Kadyrovtsy
more reports of gruesome atrocities of the kind of Dirlewanger Brigade would commit
But even justice delayed is still justice, maybe as I said some will slip, overconfident, and get arrested outside Russia.
even if we won't likely catch them all.
those conscripts are committing massacres, and we need to track down who is doing what.
we did that to Croat and Serb warcriminals, not unprecedented.
like may be some of those horrible people will get overconfident, go abroad, and we will bag and tag them and haul to the international tribunal.
there will be lots of warcriminal hunting to be done post-war

And they live in a dictatorship that's as harsh if not harsher than Russia.
by disobeying orders and other passive resistance within the military
with Ukraine
prevented going to war
Because they
again, I have more respect for Byelarusians than before the war.
Following orders wasn't an excuse back in WW2.
As much as I'm angry, I want the investigation and trials to be thorough and transparent.
if we find some of them followed orders, they will be held responsible.
but we can screen the POWs, and that's why I'm adamantly against giving POWs back to Russia.
are they seriously gonna move out of Russia? I doubt so.,
it will be easy to investigate in detail.
there's a file (that I keep on HDD, checked with anti-virus) that has all surnames and data able to identify who served where.
also we can make distinction between regular thievery and much worse crimes too.
who is a bastard and who is not.
We will sort it out easier
I personally think it's great all Russian soldiers are doxxed now.
I hope sanctions will be never lifted if Russia occupies more land.
several hundred thousand of Russians moved in
oh, that, that's happened in Crimea.
All looters who unloaded goods in Byelarussian markets got doxxed.
good job, Hajun Project.
though if they want to fracture, they're welcome
we're not going to disremember Russia
At most I see shitposting by Ukrainians that Poland should take Kaliningrad.
wdym
We can measure how they behave compared to their 'allies'
Compare that to Belarusian conscripts who are on verge of mutiny and so Belarus didn't join the operations.
the problem is that the incentives to defect are significant, and those conscripts are indeed unloading so many loot in Belarus right now. Some might be even involved in the warcrimes.
so we're in that middle period were people are getting drunk on anti-Western propaganda but the long-term ramifications of sanctions haven't come into force yet.
Russians are not yet suffering personally from sanctions long enough for the discontent with inflation and so on truly kick in
but anyway, I can say that significant number of Russians do support the war, especially since those who don't are more and more choosing to leave for Finland and elsewhere.
we must destroy the very foundations of Russian economy
it will be painful for us, but it will be more painful for Russia

Because he was being urged repeatedly to join the invasion, both sanctions and the mutinies within officer corps and among conscripts made Lukashenko shelve the idea.

Byelarus is technically Russia's vassal state, but the passive resistance and defiance are reaching high levels.
especially not after the video that went viral where drunken Russian soldiers unloading stolen goods are filmed getting beaten up by a Byelarusian cop, they're barely tolerated there.

‚ÄúSo today, we are proposing to take our sanctions a step further. We will make them broader and sharper. So that they cut even deeper into the Russian economy,‚Äù she said.

The package has six pillars, including an import ban on coal from Russia worth ‚Ç¨4 billion ($4.3 billion) per year which will cut another important revenue source for the country, said von der Leyen.

The Commission will also impose a full transaction ban on four key Russian banks, including VTB, which is the second-largest bank in the country, to further weaken Russia's financial system, she said.

The package also includes a ban on Russian vessels and Russian-operated vessels from accessing EU ports, von der Leyen said, adding that certain exemptions will cover extensions such as agriculture, food products, humanitarian aid, and energy.

The Commission will propose a ban on Russian and Belarusian road transport operators which will drastically limit the options for the Russian industry to obtain key goods, she said.

And the Commission will impose further export bans worth ‚Ç¨10 billion ($10.9 million) in areas in which Russia is vulnerable, including quantum computers and advanced semiconductors, as well as sensitive machinery and transportation equipment with an aim of degrading Russia's technological base and industrial capacity.

She said a specific new import ban worth ‚Ç¨5.5 billion ($6 billion) will also be imposed to cut the money stream of Russia and its oligarchs on various products including salmon, seafood, and liquor, a move which will also close loopholes between Russia and Belarus.

With the new package, the Commission also takes a number of ‚Äúvery targeted measures‚Äù such as a general EU ban on participation of Russian companies in public procurement and member states, she noted.

The EU Commission has also proposed an additional listing of individuals, she said, adding that EU leaders are working on additional sanctions, including on oil imports.

‚ÄúTo take a clear stand is not only crucial for us in Europe, but also for the rest of the world. A clear stance against Putin‚Äôs war of choice, a clear stand against the massacre of civilians, and a clear stance against the violation of the fundamental principles of the world order,‚Äù she added.
I assume it's energy *to* Russia because we sanctioned gas imports from Russia and work on oil imports sanctions.
Nobody is sanctioning food imports so we're not stooping to their level:

The package also includes a ban on Russian vessels and Russian-operated vessels from accessing EU ports, von der Leyen said, adding that certain exemptions will cover extensions such as agriculture, food products, humanitarian aid, and energy.
They already ethnic cleansed 400.000 Ukrainians to "filtration camps"
If they don't want to awaken the sleeping economic giant more, maybe they shouldn't use worst tactics from totalitarian playbook.
I expect to find more mass graves in Kherson, unfortunately, given the m.o. of Russian troops.
It's a war against a genocidal regime.
We should intensify the measures, and we should send more effective weaponry so that the invaders will sustain more losses.
I don't care what Russians think of us. They will reap the economic whirlwind.

This just validates my view that the current sanctions probably won't change the rally effect for worse, so yeah, EU better slaps more packages.
The fact we don't see the same passive civil resistance as in Byelarus paints a bleak picture for me.
plus Russia fails to control information compared to China. The soldiers have been known to phone to their families. Rumours do spread.

They have my blessing.
German intelligence intercepted comms of soldiers talking about the massacres with enough detail that we know now for certainty this was ordered and not a "spontaneous action".
There's more direct evidence of the massacres revealed.
All of this makes the process easier.
The Ukrainian and NATO intelligence has a full list of the servicemen, their surnames and their deployments through Byelarusian assets.
I'd not be surprised if they don't think that intelligence will comb the Russian social media for any suspicious messaging.
It's a first large war when social media are available and known to mass public, I'm not surprised that some perpetrators have slipped.
a one third of units that occupied Bucha btw have a record of mercenary service in Syria.
And the third is a child soldier from Junarmia (I guess adult soon or even now, 17 year olds are the one who are being recruited from Junarmia to military service).
his other two colleagues from that unit that got identified is a mercenary who served in Syria and has been suspected to have done some warcrimes in 2016.
But he belonged to unit involved in killings and present there at time.
of course the trophy itself isn't a proof because he could've taken it from a combatant
They don't censor when soldiers brag about killing the "fascists"
You have to be both evil and stupid to get outed that quickly.
one of them got identified because the monster bragged about cutting off ears as trophies on fucking Facebook (or rather its Russian mirror)
seems like some of Bucha's perpetrators got face doxxed

Viloria also critiques the fact that the term "sex assigned at birth" is used in one of cisgender's definitions without noting that babies are assigned male or female regardless of intersex status in most of the world, stating that doing so obfuscates the birth of intersex babies and frames gender identity within a binary male/female sex model that fails to account for both the existence of natally congruent gender non-conforming gender identities, and gender-based discrimination against intersex people based on natal sex characteristics rather than on gender identity or expression, such as "normalizing" infant genital surgeries.[40]
the only people I feel with legit criticism of cis/trans nomenclature are probably intersex people.
"I reject the word 'cis'... I don‚Äôt consider myself a cis man; I consider myself a man." He added that "while I will happily employ any term that a person feels best defines them... I reject the notion that someone can force an unwanted term on to another".[14][15]

It wasn't COVID that got him directly but he contracted sepsis in hospital and went into coma.
I can only imagine what crazy plasma takes he could come up with recently if he wasn't busy dying in agony from sepsis complications since mid February.
The fact that he also was enthusiastic supporter of "anti-gay propaganda" legislation doesn't conflict with that. Hypocrisy exists.
It was open secret that Zhirinovski was gay and he liked to surround himself with college aged men and also he has been accused of sexual harassment of a male journalist once.
Basically some Russians believe he got poisoned by a girlfriend or wife of another male lover he took.
I'd buy it if not for the prevailing evidence COVID got him.
There's a conspiracy theory about Zhirinovski's death itself but it's surprisingly lucid.
Zhirinovski liked to talk it about the bird flu conspiracies, ironically he got killed by actual disease that the Russian media helped spread "skepticism" about.
The whole thing about foreigners sending birds to spread diseases into Russia has been a fixture of tinfoil segment of Russian population since 2010s, but now it's leaking into out mainstream media.
Why birds? There has been media drivel pushed in local media about bats and birds spreading artificially engineered bird flu made by Hunter Biden in secret Ukrainian biolab.
There have been incidents in Belgorod of crowds chasing pigeons to shoot and dispose them, which some Internet users sarcastically dubbed as Neomaoism.
As for bio weapons, right now it's chunk of Russian population who are paranoid about it after the media fed them with bullshit.
they might do it, but may not be able to justify it to the external world with propaganda like when they did for sake of Assad.
but that will just led to worsening of their population and that kind of weapon isn't effective against anyone but poorly armed civilians.
that has been normalized already as part of proxy wars they engaged in
what I think is that Russians might use chemical weapons
this is what Zelensky argues too, with argument that he and his circles want to remain in power rather than lose everything.
I'm personally of the school of thought that once a nation strikes first with a tactical nuclear weapon, the psychological barriers against escalation are gone and it will just get worse down the line.
I mention that because in another server someone argued that Russia could've used a tactical nuclear weapon in case of conflict with NATO like in case of invasion of Baltics, and that retaliating other than a diplomatic sanction would just lead to nuclear exchange.
He doesn't believe they will use it, but argues that's why people shouldn't worry about military aid provoking that scenario.
Zelensky has told in an interview to an Indian television that he believes that Russia could use a nuclear weapon, but only when they feel they wouldn't get any pushback.
Of course it doesn't have to come to pass since Russian command might not be competent enough even to secure that.
Meanwhile Ukraine will get so much post-war aid that they will rebuild more prosperous and stronger, becoming an example that East Slavic nation has other alternative than live under yoke of despotism of worst sort.
a place where more than half of population has left and half of the population will die within 10 years because they're all pensioners, place where no one will invest, all while securing themselves such ghastly reputation that the first thing that will come to many people's mind when hearing words Russia and Russians will be images of soldiers looting homes and murdering civilians in cold blood.

It's not dependent on resource exports, has relatively young population compared to 'mainland' Russia, has rudimentary advanced industry (like TV factories that now can only export to Russia mostly) that got stagnated by getting cut from EU.
In right circumstances it's basically one of few pieces of Russia with long-term economic prospects.
Kaliningrad's situation is pretty much a sad farce and who knows if the locals wouldn't be better off outright as Fourth Baltic Republic like those 10.000 independence activists maintain.
Kaliningrad's without trade with Europe is basically glorified military base and it has been turning into that since 2014.
But Russia right now is ruled by a control freak who abolished elections of governors and any semblance of localism, so Putin would have to go and Russia would have to be really desperate to restore economic ties with wider Europe.
some kind of loosening of ties between Russia and Kaliningrad in form of autonomization and association treaties with other countries has been proposed around in 1990s when the economic situation was down drain.
https://www.standard.co.uk/news/world/russian-troops-advancing-eastern-ukraine-luhansk-putin-war-b993857.html I want to believe
It's a fullblown conventional war.
It's also not "crisis", but war of aggression. I hate that euphemism.
There;s no diplomatic solution to Ukraine other than beating up Russians so hard they want to take the L.
But considering Russia appointed a general who was the main enabler of Syrian regime as the main commander in Ukraine, analysts are reasonably concerned if Russia won't resort to chemical weapons through a proxy. The separatist politicians has rattled sabers about potential use of chemical WMDs.
at least it's not Sarin, it's a cruel way to die.
Owlfren ‚Äî Today at 8:23 AM
So, with what we know as of this morning there does not seem to be any evidence of chemical weapons having been deployed in Mariupol last night but given the situation no one has been able to fully refute the claim either. 
The documentation provided so far apparently indicates smoke inhalation and carbon-oxide poisoning as possible causes of the reported symptoms which is made more plausible by the fact that extensive fires were actually present in the areas where it was primarily reported. 

I'll continue to keep you updated as I get more information rolling in on it but for this morning that'll probably have to be it because I've got two different lawyers to meet up with in the next few hours.

Also, just to be clear, this does not mean Russia *won't* use such weapons in the future. Both EU and NATO strategic analysts are quite concerned with that possibility.
In this case, the allegations are finally under investigation by third party experts.
I'm honestly really jaded by the online attitude, I'd understand HOI4 Russian modders and such rejecting any news like this outright since they have had strong pro-state undertone, but I see that around far more often.
My more distant uncle with similar skillset is a manager of a factory floor.
In hindsight we should've done that earlier, but he never complained about the ridiculously low earnings for a skilled technician and programmist. Guy would've been middle class in Poland (and gonna be unless he moves to Switzerland where they presumably pay even more). In Russia, he was poorer than me, a guy who lives in limbo of lowest earnings and middle class status.
Pooling 1000 $ to get him and his Ukrainian relatives to Poland was my Discord circles' finest hour, honestly.
I swear the only I know who doesn't reflexively deflect any charge is a guy 1) with minor dissident track record, he participated in unlicensed radio stations that aired stuff without censorship 2) He has gone native by now. Guy from Russian Federation/Moscow who has relatives in Ukraine. Doesn't call himself Russian at all by now.

It was all part of the policy "of equal distance". Treat both USSR and Germany with equal reserve, rely on ties with France for security.
The pact was considered at the time as a major success of Polish diplomacy, which had been greatly weakened by the toll war with Germany, the renouncement of parts of the Treaty of Versailles and the loosened ties to France. The pact also reinforced the Polish negotiating position with Germany, which finally resulted in the signing of the German‚ÄìPolish declaration of non-aggression 18 months later.
On September 23, 1938, the Soviet Union sent a note to the Polish government to inform it that the pact would be considered null and void if Poland participated in the occupation of Czechoslovakia [1]. However, the threat was not carried out since the Soviet government stated on October 31, after Poland had occupied Zaolzie area, that the pact remained in force [2], and the pact was reaffirmed by the two powers on November 26, 1938 (see [3]). It was finally broken by the Soviets on September 17, 1939, when the Soviet and German jointly invaded Poland, in accordance with the secret protocols of the Molotov‚ÄìRibbentrop Pact.
tankies love to omit that fact
On May 5, 1934, it was extended to December 31, 1945 without amendment.
Polish-Soviet negotiations were resumed in Moscow in 1931. The pact was signed on July 25, 1932, effective for three years. Ratifications were exchanged in Warsaw on December 23, 1932, and the pact went into effect on the same day. It was registered in League of Nations Treaty Series on January 9, 1933.
Poland signed non-aggression pact with both USSR and Germany
Antisemitism
On 26 November 1946, Suslov sent a letter to Andrei Zhdanov, accusing the Jewish Anti-Fascist Committee of spying. Suslov's letter, which was well-received among Soviet leadership, would serve as the basis for prosecution of the Committee during the anti-cosmopolitan campaign.[47] After becoming head of the Agitprop, at the height of the anti-cosmopolitan campaign, Suslov also purged Jews from media and public institutions.[48]

People waking up to the fact that maybe the risks outweigh not being blackmailed by petrostate autocracies.

there will be no military denuclearization
And then we'd count on them not moving the warheads in matter of weeks to European part of Russia while rest of Europe is nuke free.
even just pulling weapons from their European part is non-negotiable for them in most likehood.
yeah, Russia would nuclearly disarm, totes.
this though
"New negotiations, organized by combinations of the United Nations and the broad Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (which includes Russia, Ukraine, most European countries, and the United States) could move further towards renewing lapsed European arms control treaties and eventually towards full nuclear disarmament across Europe.

That would include removing the U.S. nuclear weapons held in Europe as part of NATO‚Äôs ‚Äúnuclear-sharing‚Äù operations. The threat of an accident involving any of Ukraine‚Äôs 15 nuclear power stations (including Chernobyl), or the escalation ‚Äî accidental or otherwise ‚Äî of the war to a conflict between the world‚Äôs biggest nuclear weapons powers, seriously raises the urgency of an immediate end to this war. There is no conceivable ‚Äúnational interest‚Äù worth risking even the tiniest possibility of such an outcome."
the analysis basically for the context boiled down to arguing that NATO encroached on Russia, sanctions are a weapon of war, sending weapons to Ukraine is escalation that undermines diplomacy, you know the drill.

Overkill, but honestly we also had to retire T-72s eventually, funny how we are possibly retiring them by giving them to Ukraine.
Funnily enough, we bought 250 newest model Abrams to counter those Armatas.

I'm not going to vote socialist unless tactical voting requires me, but I don't reject all socialists. It depends on their views.
As long as a socialist doesn't want to emulate Soviet model and is aware of how much misery it inflicted on its own people and the nations it suborned and stands by the attacked nation and supports my nation's defense, I view them as legitimate and to be respected part of political debate going on the present and future of my society.
Not even "socialists" as understood by GOP i.e. socdems and libs, I mean people who propose nationalizations in similar scope to what Attlee did and often suggest something in the vein of post-war PPS program of nationalizing all large industry.
My motto is to reject Muscovite vanguardist tyranny, red and brown, support anti-communist socialists even if I might disagree with many domestic policies.
if that's what most communists believe, then even more reason to ostracize them tbh.
USSR literally did similar shit what Russia plans to do, so lol, okay.

btw, even if the war ends a full victory, but Russians still keep those nationals in "filtration camps", we should keep maintaining sanctions.

Millions of civilians displaced, thousands intentionally killed, increasing damage to the infrastructure of the nation and widespread looting.
If fuckups and miscalculations on Ukraine's part happen, they're minor compared to what misery Russia intentionally inflicted so far on the Ukrainian nation.
As for myself, I'd be likely rejected as a volunteer since my draft status is "probably gonna be conscripted if shit escalates to fullblown world war between NATO and a hostile power". I do pay taxes though, local and national, that go into helping Ukrainians, militarily and in form of humanitarian initiatives. And the representatives who I'm voted for, at local and national level, passed bills and resolutions aiding Ukraine too.

The student faces up to three years in prison and a fine of up to 3 million roubles (‚Ç¨34,430) if found guilty of "desecrating a symbol of Russian military glory".

The Memorial of Glory in Khanty-Mansiysk is dedicated to soldiers who died during the "Great Patriotic War" against Nazi Germany.


The Russian Investigative Committee also published a video of Rebecca Ziba sitting in what appears to be an interrogation room, where she confesses and apologises for her actions.

"I didn't want the video I posted to be offensive and disrespectful to the dead. I didn't know what the memorial signifies. I apologise very much to everyone," the student says in English.

It is unclear under what kind of conditions she is being held and whether she had access to any legal representation.

Euronews has contacted the Zambian embassy in Moscow to confirm whether any contact had been made with the student.

if it would happen
though I personally and privately thought the invasion would happen around April
then few of my friends were damn right months in advance
but hindsight is 20/20
imagine if we were wiser as an alliance and armed Ukraine like that between 2014-2022
180 billion is more like 1 % of the federal budget, not economy like in Estonia's case
that'd be 2 trillion of aid
well, scratch, I miscalced
but Poland and Estonia and few other countries I need to check on are punching above their usual tier in assistance sent.
USA mogs everyone else put together already with 8 B of aid sent so far in various forms.
180 billion of aid, which would have been 2/3 of Ukraine's whole GDP and frankly probably *too* much of a good thing, since I imagine it'd overheat the economy of Ukraine in such short time.
I just calced how much aid USA would provide if it did as much as Estonia.
~~and then moving to New York like them~~
Probably badgering my Texas cousins to help with immigration.
I don't know where I'd be if the communist system remained but not definitely staying in Poland in that alternate reality.
We should've lined for basic goods in queue and I should've been denied higher education like my mom because not enough "class background" points.
And caused one of first irreparable fissures in the building of Soviet communism.
Solidarno≈õƒá brought democracy and free right to unionization to Poland. That's a success.
imagine not stanning actually successful worker's movements (like Wa≈Çƒôsa's, PBUH)

but they also did shit like putting bunch of commissioned officers of lower rank to man one APC.
the Russians communications are also antiquated and dysfunctional enough they need to expose the commanders to coordinate.
I'd compare killing Gerasimov near frontline to shooting down Yamamoto if that wouldn't insult Yamamoto who was actually competent.
plus UA have been mercing lower ranked generals and officers left and right, so the replacements are getting shorter in supply too.

I think more aid could be still wringled out of other allies, it's more of matter of will than limitations for anyone but Baltics *cough* Germany and France *cough*
USA can throw money at Ukraine while Russia is considering emptying the pension fund at this point to limit deficit spending.
well, the proposed economic package already exceeds a bit all aid sent by all nations thus far.

But it will the closest approach within orbit of Saturn and then swing back.

Who will obviously do what GBs do and train local forces into using them well.
also as an aside, those new Howitzers to Ukraine are packaged with a detachments of Green Beret volunteers from Canada.
COs are supposed to coordinate units, not soldiers, and without such exposure.
at this level of warfare, it should be non-officers with a NCO at head of the smaller unit.
are COs supposed to act as infantry squad in APC?
we're seeing clash between Russian military rotten down by the culture of endemic corruption vs Ukrainian army that has been learning over those 8 years and has been assisted by Green Berets and other specialized trainers in whipping their military institutions into shape.
Disarming after an existential war is a folly.
Even better if they join NATO or other reliable defense alliance.
Ukraine needs to have a strong army to deter potential future attempts of Russia.
Because it isn't

The letter ‚Äî signed by more than 20 prominent figures from academia, culture and journalism ‚Äî urged Scholz not to send heavy weaponry to Ukraine, citing fears it could lead to a third world war and ‚Äúmake Germany itself a party to the war.‚Äù
Scholz is btw reacting largely to this:
yeah, they very much should rectify their attitude which alas happens quite slow.
They are responsible partly for the situation by buying oil from an aggressive country threatening sovereignity of their neighbors.
German governments collaborated with Russia through decades.
And Russia has already committed all kind of atrocities to civilians, yet those bastards don't lose sleep over that.
yeah, condemning action against a conquering power is immoral in my book.
(which has happened before)
We should normalize smearing German pacifists with horse shit.
I wonder if those moral degenerates who called him warmonger (despite still not doing enough, imo) would have the same courage around Ukrainians living in Germany.
https://www.tagesschau.de/inland/scholz-ukraine-kurs-verteidigung-103.html
Scholz is attacking pacifists in public speech: "Russia is trying change borders with violence. That is imperialism! We won't allow it in europe. (...) We will continue to support Ukraine - Also with weapons deliveries!" - while small parts of the crowd call Scholz "warmonger!"

Orange County Tax Collector Scott Randolph tweeted if Reedy Creek is gone, so is the $105 million Disney collects from itself annually to operate those services. Randolph predicted it could mean a 20% to 25% increase in property taxes for Orange County residents. 
Neighboring Osceola County said it is "uncertain" about its future financial responsibilities and is studying the issue.
The counties also likely would have to assume the debt obligations now held by Reedy Creek. Randolph said Reedy Creek has $53 million a year in debt obligations.

If Disney decides to pack toys, there's no more reason for those millions to attend the tourist psot.

he was suspected of being close to his cousin, but the tape only leaked out now
In April 2022, American Muckrakers PAC requested an ethics investigation of Cawthorn's relationship with his aide Stephen Smith,[84] Cawthorn's second cousin.[85] The request said that Cawthorn had provided more than $250 worth of free housing and travel to Smith, in violation of House rules, providing documents that appear to show Smith lives for free in a house owned by Cawthorn.[84] The complaint also alleges that the two may have an inappropriate personal relationship, possibly sexual in nature, something prohibited between a lawmaker and a member of their staff.[86]

SEA and Pacific Islander immigration gonna be more and more relevant, and by some date I forgot the population might be 25 % descended from those regions (not including Taiwanese natives who are Pacific Islanders though, Taiwan is theorized to be the birthplace of proto-Polynesians and has Polynesian native population).
gonna be interesting to see how the society continues to develop
A product of waves of settler colonisation, with a minority of indigenous people only carving out rights in recent generations, very welcome to immigration from outside unlike lots of Asian countries.
More of a New World country in some ways.
Definitely unusual country for Asia, now to think of that.
definitely those who arrived post 1949 feel Chinese the most, but there's a civic identity of Taiwanese becoming stronger with time.
China's rhetoric though definitely is facilitating the process of making those Chinese identify with a Taiwanese identity.
like caught one girl concocting excuses that Taiwan must hate Chinese because they hate China's government. My sister in Christ, there *are* Chinese living there too.
subtle othering of Taiwan already happens.
rhetoric of some online mainlanders and pro-China Hongkongers disturbs me, ngl.
there's still definitely risk they will try something stupid in regards to Taiwan. I hope in such case the resolve of Taiwan will be as stalwart as Ukraine's and the military aid as robust.
yeah, I'm not globalization radical. We shouldn't enable China's rise.
autarky is akin to madness

and now they're on way to mop up north-eastern Russian battlegroups around Kharkiv, seems like
> First, international opinion has been massively unified behind Ukraine, and huge amounts of military aid have been send to Ukraine very quickly. In 1939/1940, European assistance was essentially limited to a few thousand volunteer troops from Sweden. France and Britain both talked about sending expeditionary forces to assist Finland, but these were really attempts to block German access to Swedish iron ore and not genuine attempts to assist Finland. In any case, they did not actually happen. Finland spent the entire war desperately short of antitank weapons, and depended on land mines and Molotov cocktails. Ukraine, on the other hand, has been supplied with thousands of modern antitank and antiaircraft missile systems and used them to great effect.
> 
> Second, Ukraine is a much larger country than Finland. With the retreat of Russian forces from Kyiv, Ukraine has strategic options that Finland did not. Finland was forced to defend the fixed defences of the Mannerheim Line in a type of warfare that allowed the Soviet forces to concentrate and exploit their advantages in artillery and armor. If the Mannerheim Line fell, Helsinki because essentially defenceless and the war would quickly be lost. Finland had much better military success in the north, where they could retreat and trade territory for time and ambush opportunities. Ukraine does not have an equivalent to the Mannerheim Line, and can be more flexible in its defense. This does not guarantee victory, of course, but it gives them options Finland did not have.
Fins didn't counterattack, fought largely static defense.
Ukraine is doing better than Finland.

they fought hard to take down every German going at them to Hell (where all Germans participating in pacification surely ended up)
they didn't commit suicides like bitches
And I was of course told by more liberal Jew to not assume it's like iron law too, except for the mandate to prioritize mother's life, because Judaism has innate resistance to attempts codify such stances further, as rabbis are cautious to not seem like they are settling a question for good. They don't want to seem "infallible".
Curiously, even though it's still restrictive deadline, there's support for on request abortion among Orthodox Jews, a child doesn't have soul until first 40 days pass, but I was also again told by the religious Jew that this is not like one agreed on deadline and there are also more permissive stances.
and that's like the mainstream conservative position in Judaism on abortion, there are more liberal interpretations than what I'm told by Orthodox Jews.
Ultimately stems from the belief that Hashem urges people to live rather than die, so for example extreme martyrhood like the mass suicide at Masada is still topic of debate, while Ghetto Uprising doesn't cause controversy because the very small minority of insurgents took chance to evacuate and fight Germans elsewhere.
Because not saving mother means that you potentially also don't save of lives of future children she might successfully give birth to.
Orthodox Jews support abortion for medical reasons and Talmud doesn't even give mother a choice to die along with the child rather than undergo abortion.
yesterday I learned from a Jew that the moral imperative to prioritize mother's life over unborn child's originates from Talmud.
God knows that talking with them (and Jews) about that certain issue is more constructive, talking with pro-life Prots is like pulling out teeth without anesthesia.
I still think at more local/grassroots level Catholics are better about the religion than Prots.
afaik they only restricted abortions if the fetus is female in some attempt to correct the gender imbalance crisis (too late though)
shhhh, don't tell them about the abortion laws in China.

which is weird, because I've seen people defending Berlin authorities on grounds they don't want riots, but I guess buildings can be open with sympathies
they're not banning the flags from stationary buildings and objects, only carrying them around, seems like.
bringing Russian flag around Ukrainians is now an equivalent of bringing Azeri flag to Armenian rally.
I don't advocate that, but Russians should be aware that they'd be poking at hornet nest like in the example above.
that's fair in my book, if you drive a car with far right symbols native to Russian far right scene around Ukrainians, you deserve your car being ruined like that.
the most Ukrainians have done is pelting cars with fascist Russian insignia with horse manure.
though beatings haven't happened yet in Germany
if I were mayor, knowing my sympathies, I'd turn blind eye to Ukrainians marching at and even beating up Pro-Putinists.

they should go fuck the police and unveil those flags anyway

Again, I will stand by my belief that 1917 was a bigger chance at democratic Russia that got squandered and squashed, agrarian SR Russia would've been flourished into something promising without Bolsheviks and Whites grinding down the peasantry into apathy and resignation (in best case scenario)
I don't have to explain I hope why Zyuganov's communists are not alternative, Navalny has disturbing record of ultranationalism despite marketing himself as liberal to Westerns.
though honestly I have little hopes for actual, meaningful liberalization in Russia unless the opposition is also marginalized and something new arises.
Thankfully the brightest legacy of Eastern front, Partisans, can't be stolen by Putin, since Byelarusians formed underground movement against the Russian logistics in Belarus. They also do volunteer a lot in the latter day anti-fascist war.
it was a joint effort of Eastern Europeans that Russians and their leadership have tarnished. First by enslaving half of Europe, secondly by appropriating its legacy for parades celebrating another imperialist war.
also Armenians joined the war effort in disproportionate numbers
especially Belarusian partisan counts among three largest underground resistance movements along with Polish and red Yugoslav movements.
There were lots of Ukrainians and Belorusians in ranks of the Red Army and in partisan movements.
It was a pyrrhic victory for the rest of Europe east to Elbe
maybe one day Russians will distance themselves from lionizing that particular totalitarian system (and stop taking credit for Byelarussian and Ukrainian sacrifices)
just 15 Aug has the largest one
there was a parade on my nameday on 11 Nov, last year
well, few times a year
So yeah, nothing wrong with supporting the troops a little once a year.
Military surgeons and doctors are also pretty skilled and operate hospitals for civilians too, at least in my countryr.
And in peacetime military engineers are great asset for fighting natural disasters.
Militaries exist to defend a country, as the ideal state of matters.
and it's a good excuse sometimes for a day off. Here 15th August is a day off.
military parades can be normal and without fascist and Bolshevik insignia like the recent one in Russia.

the two countries are having a row over customs and Kazakhstan might do Kazaxit from Eurasian Union over this
but the cold snap in Russia-Kazakhstan relations doesn't bode well for the trend
I don't know how many of these were Central Asian/Kazakh migrants moving for other jobs, then
well, my bad, I don't think the 1.5 million accounts for 2022 thus far, so, that 3.8 million would wipe out that gain.
well, the population *officially* increased by like 1.5 million since 2020, but it ain't births for sure. Where migrants will go once economy contracts enough? Probably back to Kazakhstan or to work at wider Asian or European labor market.
that'd be like >3 % of population gone from a combination of reasons within last 2 years.
since 2020

while Abkhazia is content with Belarussian like status (or even looser since they're not trying to Russify their own people like Lukashenko)
they even sent troops to the meatgrinder
it is de facto part of Russia because the collabs are completely subservient
Abkhazia is different since they want to have separate state and tbh feels like they would go to war with Russia too if Russia tried to annex them
maybe Russians want to annex before they run out of ability to unofficially hold it?

and larger bit called Abkhazia
a bit of Georgia called Ossetia
is there even any mask left to tear off for Russia, lmao?

one of my drug dealer acquaintances survived without being caught, one spent a year in a slammer and repeated a year
my school has witnessed law breaking activities, just some people got caught, some not
yeah, the high school code forbids smoking.
v. restricted
and if they're not teachers, those baiters I mean, it still means that pretending to be lolicon teacher carries less potential lashback  riskthan being out of closet teacher in some states and it says a lot about our society.
dude broke safety regulations, smoked in a room, triggered newly installed fire emergency mechanism and created lots of chaos
lol, my home room teacher who still taught my decade younger sister basically is lucky to not be in slammer or doing community service
offline and online
I have no illusions that teachers can behave pretty stupid
doesn't deserve automatic firing of course, but the school should discipline them in some way if the school learns of it for basically trolling.
if they arre really teachers and just baiting people, I'd say it's still unprofessional.
if that's the case
very unfunny bait
yeah, got infamously viral in some servers for a while.
(I'm sure it's he, but I noticed I default a lot ot them these days as pronoun)
I posted it because it reminded me of some guy who creeped on Spy X Family's child character in unsettling way, but also fully doxxed themselves as a middle school teacher, so lol, his pupils and co-workers and the pupil's parents could've seen those tweets.
I do hope it is a bait
If I was a judge, real talk, I'd cringe if I had to judge a lolicon just because it technically falls under broad definition of child pornography here, but since children are not involved I'd let him off with low punishment like fine and community service or acquittal/annulling the proceedings.
I'd classify lolicons as people whose "social harm" is negligible on their own, but the kindergarten thing is what sparks my ü§® in conjuction with being self-professed lolicon.
I have very low opinion of lolicon and people who like it, so I'm pretty disturbed nonetheless.
my vicar openly engages into advertisting certain products, everyone knows he fucks the same woman for decades, but he doesn't charge actually too much and he is relatively liberal for a Polish priest.
a priest overseeing whole parish
my parish's vicar is oddly corrupt but also oddly decent
~~our vicar though has a secret wife~~
my town for some reason turned out to be clean
we never had any creepy priest, despite my diocese being a hotbed of pedophilia.
all her children abandoned her in some form or other
there's prediction the same thing will happen with the youngest child in some form
because her stupid mother tried to force on her German studies and refused to pay for engineering studies, so my classmate went, "nope, enlisting."
my classmate's mother was so toxic that my classmate eloped the moment she graduated and went to military
her mother was teacher uninterested in raising her newest child, and my classmate was basically made to raise her youngest sister to the point people not in the know mistook her for a mother
we had a reverse situation with another classmate, sort of
I ask myself that, yeah
it's because my classmate's mother adopted the child
that her older sister is her biological mother
her kid
someone will have to tell eventually
the story isn't very funny because
nope
during my first year, my classmate went to have a sex with some guy on a last day of vacations before high school started, and gave birth 9 months later, almost by the end of the school year.
there has been at least one teen in my senior high school a year who was heavily pregnant
this happened at our train station two months ago
biggest local sensation since a mountain lion prowled around, lmao
we usually get hedgehogs, foxes, feral peafowl, that sort of size category
I'm not used to that
we usually see deer grazing on the fields some distance from the gardens, but this beast developed a taste for flowers, lol.
we suspect she is just lairing by the river that flows through communal gardens and has some patches of wilderness to hide in
we tried to catch her today but she spotted us pretty early and we only got a glimpse
corner or fool her with food, restrain the bitch, ship her to the services so she can get back to forest
Tomorrow we plan to do another deerhunt
Fucker.
my suburbs have been plagued for last few days by a female deer who have been spotted by witnesses and recorded by CCTV camera, eating my flowers of course.
I might hear that deer
some are albinos
much larger, more pronounced antlers, etc.
well, if fallow deer escaped, we'd know, they don't look much like roes
we've got bisons, fallow deer and boars
seems like an institution similar to my place's conservation institution
in some private park
huh, we've got them now too.
I assume they got domesticated over generations
they are temple site deers
one buck was enough distrustful though that he immediately left after eating a banana, but the second lost enough fear of humans that he let the feeder pet him.
nothing violent happened, but dunno, maybe we shouldn't make roe deer feel comfortable in cities.
I've seen a video of someone feeding two roe deer bucks with bananas.
tell that to some people.
roe deer are relatively small compared to usual deer, basically sort of perceived neoteny. Except even a doe can be dangerous if disturbed.
which I planned to do until I got my second cat
I know also some people online have dreams of keeping a tame roe deer because they look pretty cute, but the best response I've seen was along the lines "buy a damn goat"
probably tourists leaving food waste around or even doing it on purpose, reducing their fear of humans
this shouldn't happen, but it does

1) had worms 2) ate few dogs by the time zoo caught him
well, they photo'd one in Pozna≈Ñ's centre
I'll bet we will see wolves scavenge suburban trash one day
though I don't want if reintroduction of wolves will be something without disadvantages
(unlike more primeval and mixed forests in the east part of the coutnry)
(count on Germans too I guess to just make forests too "ordered")
(I mean, military has to account for mushroom gathering seasons here, so that's a big factor)
In Western Poland, due to a long tradition of forest management shaped by German forestry standards, Scots pine monocultures with a weak undergrowth prevail, where finding a save refuge to hide and to rear pups is difficult. Disadvantageous is also a huge pressure in vegetation season from berries and mushroom collectors, which disturb animals in the most remote areas.
The wolf population in Western Poland together with packs living in Eastern Germany has been classified as critically endangered CE by the Guidelines for Population Management Plans for Large Carnivores, which were approved by the European Commission.
I think that it's lack of predators
I dunno what makes them go into town now, maybe overpopulation?
the thing is that roe deer are a common sight usually, but they are a field pest.
nah, the best incident was a goat shoplifting from a supermarket by train station.
there's a shed she likes
since the spot is a street away on a garden plot we own separately.
That's also what the cat transporter is for.
just wants to vibe in that one spot she likes and we sometimes have to bring her back because she doesn't come home for breakfast sometimes.
ironically the one who strays furthest also doesn't like to catch anything.
trust me, the price for letting cats some freedom is them having to endure the bag for transporting cats.
we check them up regularly, they're sterilized
this isn't a part of town where there are endangered birds nesting
At least the one who bothers to hunt
Eh, they mostly bring rodents back.
my town have had a mounting deer problem since few months, like the buck and doe who were rampaging through train station.
not only mine
also something that can trespass into my garden can run into my cats, and well, don't want them to be trampled or kicked either.
ok flower disrespecter
üôè a hunter with tranq darts soon, god willing.
no, we need to restore law and order. Pressure on animal control to act mounts.
few clerks decided to corner and shoo away the deer across the river on their own without waiting for the animal control, and they found out.
the roe deer who ate my garden flowers injured a member of civil service

Industry that stops caring about minimal standards for a job position falls apart. We have those things for reasons. If the managers' skills are lacking, elections won't solve it, actually giving auditory bodies some real fangs to enforce standards will.
If there is pool of roughly equally qualified candidates, then in such case it's safe to let people decide whom they like more.
I prefer some common sense restraints than populism without brakes whenever it isn't about representing general voters. Qualifications should act as a brake.
unrestrained elections are a contest of charisma rather than meritocracy.
I'm just pointing out that the "right people" according to some voters might mean "utter incompetents who are good at charming people" if there's no minimal standards for candidacy.
We have analogy in history in form of electing officers, that has worked with mixed results.
no guarantee workers will actually vote on the right people, so gotta still require job experience and qualifications as minimal requirements.
direct democracy only works at certain smaller scales and as referenda, I guess.
every sizable business needs middle management.
If you vote on everything, it will turn a circus (a parliament) rather than a business.
someone will have to manage businesses.

Oh, I forgot to mention that they're also going forward a lot on social issues like LBGT rights, not to degree of Taiwan's, but there's progress.
Good news for me since I'm fond of Vietnam despite certain flaws like them being still authoritarian (though they're downright liberal now compared to China, they have downscaled the repression a lot since opening up), I'd like them being economically stronger to be less under Chinese pressure and because they're Poland's biggest partners in the region.

There's touch of dirigisme in our otherwise fairly private enterprise friendly economy.
well, by keeping 51 % share, companies like KGHM still have investments from private entities.
And the government left the actually profit bringing companies for itself
We've dodged that bullet by appointing a commission that have privatized the industry over more than a decade. It was still like 25 % nationalized by 2000.
The vouchers being given out to workers and leaving plant managers without oversight was possibly the worst idea.
Yeah, economically in theory they vaguely listened to the same think tank that Poland listened to about the economic liberalization, but the execution was different.
also talk about Russia's system being US created is pure garbage
I have no doubt they'd have avoided Great Leap Forward, in first place.
Chiang's son *did* set the country on first steps to thaw and liberalization so within confines of Taiwan they have ended up actually democratizing

they only censored the homosexual parts, but posters and merchandise was tweaked to show Finn less
Finn having abortive relationship plot with an Asian actress... well, that wouldn't fly in China.

tricameralism

ep. 3 has a Clone Wars reference you will hit or miss unless you watched whole series, btw

the guns you can own without permit in Switzerland are either hunting and bolt action guns that are so unwieldy that you're viewed sus in all likehood when carrying them in urban settings, and CO2 powered BB shooters.
that's why I'm bringing up Switzerland, because the ownership might be high, but the permit system would give average Glock fondler a heart attack.
nobody here is advocating for gungho and irresponsible gun laws, I'm sure.
like falling from heights
women in Switzerland who go for suicide don't use guns much, but some still go for methods that kill really effective
I know, people not used to guns tend to go for poisoning, and hanging is as popular in Switzerland as guns.
If you take guns from literally everyone, the people attempting suicide will go for other highly effective methods.
Maybe the way to go is to invest in mental healthcare in first place?
Cheap.
I have a bridge for you to sell.
You seriously believe they wouldn't go for other means of suicide?
thankfully for Czechs, they have the nuclear option of just enshrining their gun rules in constitution.
EU attempted the economic area wide gun control and met resistance from the two countries.
the difference is so negligible in homicide rates that banning guns surely would have no other effect than pissing off the Swiss and Czechs
But it's because Sweden has been struggling with organized crime
low homicide rates are pretty universal for Europe, no matter gun laws, unless you talk about Sweden when it's on rise.
and that's the most pressing issue about guns
one of lowest rates of homicides in the world
[citation needed]
Swiss control ammo purchase, not just guns, for example.
and the suicide rates are at global average and below Euro average, so I don't think gun access factors too.
almost 30 % of male suicides are done by guns, but as much men choose hanging.
the vast majority of gun deaths are suicides
By contrast, gun crime is comparatively limited. In 2016, there were 187 attempted and 45 completed homicides, for a homicide rate of 0.50 per 100,000 population, giving Switzerland one of the lowest homicide rates in the world.[49] Of the recorded homicides (attempted or completed), 20.3% were committed with a gun (47 cases, compared to an average of 41 cases in the period of 2009‚Äì2015). In addition, there were 7 cases of bodily harm and 233 cases of robbery committed with firearms.[50]
And honestly they might be on something because the high gun ownership there doesn't correlate with high gun crime.
The Swiss practice of letting reservists buy guns is one thing to consider IMHO.
I'm actually for expanding gun ownership in my country, within reason.
Plus banning the thing completely when responsible gun owners exist sounds dystopian.

handguns though still have uses if you need armed bodyguards, need to arm airborne units and other forces needing lightweight weapons, and for specific sports.
emphasis on need because obv cops don't need all guns for example
average person can go to a gun range
by actual professional athles
I think of private ownership
when I mean handgun ownership for sports,
and disclose personal data to the gun range in case of not having permit
I might just go to a gun range
if I want ever to shoot tho
Provision against nunchakus is not enforced in general, martial arts practitioners use them normally.[61]
Some people managed to obtain crossbow permits.[58] As of 2019 there were 13 such permits.[59]:
Other types of weapons that require permit according to the law include:

(non-handheld) incapacitating gas dispensers;
specific melee weapons:
blades hidden in objects that do not look like weapons,
brass knuckles,[56]
nunchakus,
batons having endings or implements made of heavy and hard material,
batons made of wood or other heavy and hard material, imitating a baseball bat;[57]
crossbows;
electroshock weapons with current exceeding 10 mA.
actually, let me look melee weapon laws in Poland
I've also touched a sword and a rifle bayonet before, so yeah
then tearing off by hand or other tool gets easier
swing at weak points
well, not just wallpaper in my case, but also wall panels.
axes do wonders
if you want to strip off old wallpaper
I used it for home renovation
an axe
At the same time, I have definitely a dangerous tool in my room right now.
I'd not trust myself with a gun since I have poor eyesight and depth perception, just like I can't drive cars for similar reasons.
under highly controlled circumstances.
I've touched a gun like once or twice
just like hard drugs should be decriminalized and heavy regulated
that's why guns are best to be heavily regulated
my point is that banning everything of a specific thing is invariably utopian.
but yeah, very specific use.
I also forgot that handguns are useful when worse comes to worst and you need to engage in discreet guerilla. But then again, whether it's illegal or legal to own handguns in such situation isn't most pressing issue people have in mind.
emphasis on need because obv cops don't need all guns for example
handguns though still have uses if you need armed bodyguards, need to arm airborne units and other forces needing lightweight weapons, and for specific sports.
but minority of guns used for violent purposes
since they're intimidating
assault gun fixation is kind of a meme by now
so basically they regulate strictly the main kind of gun used for homicides around the world unless you're in warzone.

also Ruskie pierogi ironically are a recipe from what is now western Ukraine, so people trying to rename it isn't that bad, jus they slept on the fact that Ruskie means Ru≈õ not Rosja.
matter of experience
but I recognize Vietnamese and Japanese food
my taste buds can't tell much difference between various foods from where Han folks live so I can't tell if it's Taiwan, Sichuan, Hong Kong etc.
conflating all food from PRC's de facto territory as Chinese is simplistic.
I think the golden solution would be just dropping "Chinese" altogether and naming food based on region.
hate is a strong word in my case toward China, just don't wanna line Xi's circle's pockets.
at least next Apple product I might buy for sister's college education might be made in Vietnam, and Vietnam's friendliest country in Asia from my country's perspective.
Personally, I'd avoid PRC products if I could, but outsourcing shift will take some time üòî
Unless PRC has Russia moment and tries to invade the island, then I think we will see intensification, just like a kind of pierogi here got renamed from Russian to Ukrainian.
Probably that trend will lessen as saber rattling lowers in intensity.
probably just depends on the mood and knowledge of your average consumer how businesses of any scale market their products. It's not some long-term strategy.
Vietnamese restaurant owners in Poland passing off all kinds of non-Vietnamese Asian food but Japanese as "Chinese":

Not mean to defend Netanyahu here, but his caricature had some tropes associated with anti-Semitic cartoons, like very large ears
not their first anti-Semitic cartoon
The S√ºddeutsche Zeitung (pronounced [ÀàzyÀêtÀåd…î èt É…ô Ààtsa…™t ä≈ã]; lit.‚Äâ'South German Newspaper'), published in Munich, Bavaria,[7] is one of the largest daily newspapers in Germany. The tone of SZ is mainly described as centre-left,[2][4] liberal,[8] social-liberal,[9] progressive-liberal,[2] and social-democrat.[10]
I guess Scientology got so "normalized" that the creating your own cults from scratch is the new vogue for suspicious Hollywood celebrities.
wow, Ezra has a cult like Jared too üíÄ
better nip a potential Jared Leto in the bud so to speak, and hope they will serve some sentence.
Ezra might be not rich enough and famous yet, just like the Fantastic Beast actor
but then again Jared Leto got away with worse üò¨
could be a second-degree one
well, Ezra risks a lot if a court actually treats that seriously.
> In most cases, kidnapping is charged as a first-degree felony involving a 15-year to lifetime prison sentence and possible fines of up to $20,000. The offense is a second- degree felony involving a 10-year to life sentence and $15,000 in fines if the victim is released without harm.
that Fantastic Beast and Dunkirk actor did get sentenced to 5 years in 2021.
depends on the court and justice system
And Ezra is not the first actor in case whom fame got to their head
humans are not rational
(no, seriously, I can't help but think it will end up in some tragedy if Ezra roams doing that abusive shit, should be trialled)
üëè LOCK üëè THEM üëè UP üëè
step in a right direction
It's not yet a democracy overall, but Tokayev can't for example stuff institutions with his relatives like Nazarbayev
the President's position has still strong powers, but they got limited, the constitional court got reestablished, President still appoints oblast governors (akims), but they have to be voted on by oblast assemblies.
the constitutional amendments stripped previous dictator and his family of special status and immunity from persecution
And switched from general repression to piecemeal reformisim and compromising with opposition.
further speaking about Kazakhstan, things are going better way there since the establishment realized they're not gonna get invaded by Russians any time soon.
That's de facto what happens in Poland all while substantial minorities have language rights according to our legislation.
my own stance is that every minority should be native speaker of the majority language, a policy of bilingualization so to speak.
tbh, ethnic Russian diaspora does have a problem about bullheadedly refusing to be bilingual, but if it was said in a country that Westerners know about any other minority than Russian, there'd be uprorar.
> On 1 May 2022, Ak Zhol Democratic Party MP Qazybek Isa allegedly suggested during a parliamentary inquiry "On the State Language" to exclude Russian and leave Kazakh as the sole recognised state language of Kazakhstan.[86] Isa stated that 36 lawmakers favoured the proposed change and claimed that not having the knowledge of a native language makes a person "spiritually disabled", using Japan as example of a developed country where children learn the native Japanese language.[86]
but one of Kazakh reformists basically stated this
moving here
> All in all, the rhetoric isn't, surprisingly, getting as hostile as in Kazakhstan about Russian.
I mean, they violate the court orders
which I think is where Ezra will end up
they should be hiding with a fellow prisonmate in a prison.

Then Qinq opened up the province generations later
then Qinq conquered it and tried to limit settlement due to general distrust of overseas commerce, but there was some illegal immigration going on.
first I recall there was the Ming loyalists who conquered it and expelled Dutch
1949 wave is just the most recent one
since there has been different waves
few diasporas
since Red Ruthenia was under Austria during partitions, and before that under PLC and Moscow was just a small Rus state when Red Ruthenia was independent.
pierogi ruskie are from Red Ruthenia, so a region that never belonged to any Moscow government until 1945.
they're basically independent in everything but currency and foreign politics and having an army
not for long at this rate
Greenland isn't in Europe nor EU
but there's generally a lot of non-Ukrainian options
my bad, got confused, it's still option
because pretty much Schiller's Wilhelm Tell elevated the folk hero into international fame
I don't know if the voters know the little detail that Hitler banned Schiller's plays in 1941 after a Swiss assassination attempt.
18th century poet from Wuttemberg
seems like for example a Friedrich Schiller street gonna be a thing as one of votes closed.
seems people are voting for both Ukrainian figures and foreigners.
one of British themed street names got renamed after Frederick Douglass
yeah, they've been doing that since 2016, with delays <:salute:867191030247587881>
Cork has attempted to do the same thing with all the British street names like Victoria, gotta check if they renamed them
it's good to rename streets symbolizing country that has deprived you of independence, caused artificial famine, and now whose weaker version is mass murdering your civilians again.
he also voted for Stupka (Ukrainian actor) for some other street which name I don't recall.
my acquaintance for example voted to rename Proletariat street to Israel street.
especially since it's done through voting on proposed names
V. good initiative
Kiyv renaming all Soviet era name streets
Not a basic good.
Muh Iphone.
Those sanctions also hit the civilians by restricting access to advanced electronics, but who the fuck cares.
since they can't maintain T-90s anymore.
Sanctions already forced Russians to go for less advanced tank models
> in ww2 even western civilians had their food and fuel rationed, other luxury goods limited, had their pots and pans melted down etc. for the war effort

> and now people want to give up sanctioning russia because inflation is 1% higher
also, damn, a friend has a good response to the concern trolling we should stop sanctions because domestic inflation in USA got 1 % higher.
All the "asset freezing" and "VIPs can't enter our countries" sanctions are more fit for minor hostile actions, like let's say crackdowns on free press and so on.
When it gets to a point when you sanction a nation for a war, it's really hard to sanction military industries without hitting civilian sections of economy.
(well, it's more like KMT did absolutely nothing to stop businesses that imported textiles from Japan for the Chinese consumer market to coordinate a massive boycott, but semantics really at that level. Japanese textile industry got hit hard)
"Oh no, the textile workers are laid off in thousands because the central KMT government sanctioned Japan over seizing Manchuria, that's too much."
I honestly wonder what those people in governments who complain the sactions are too broad would think in 1930s and early 1940s when various sanctions and boycotts hit certain segments of Japanese society really harsh.
it's hard for me to care about the Russian public opinion when the most they go through is some shortages on the shelves while their cousins, sons, grandsons and brothers are committing appalling atrocities.
if anything, the situation should call for harsher and harsher sanctions, yet we're here.
if we targeted only Putin and his allies, we'd achieve absolutely nothing.
maybe there's Reverse Ezra and they're actually wholesome üòá
Likewise I hope they will somehow track them down based on online footprint.
I hope something tragic won't happen
This is getting deranged
https://twitter.com/CBR/status/1537100010583728131
they're basically almost a pair of two independent countries sharing a personal union.
I imagine one of clauses in any independence agreement would be giving Danish preferential treatment for investments and such.
not exactly, Denmark could keep investing
Costa Rica doesn't have army, and some European countries don't have their own currency, the main thing marking them as 'colony' is delegating foreign policy to Denmark.
either way, Greenland is as independent as it could be without officially declaring independence.
the only EEA regulations they obey are trade ones
easily could be a bridge between European and North American markets
could always remain a trading partner whether they go Canada route or not
I've read once proposal to geoengineer the terrain as much as possible as sheet recedes to keep as much freshwater for the lake as possible
also might have freshwater lake if global warming removes whole sheet

gunpowder used to have civilian applications too. Once you let some genies out of bottle, you need to regulate them.
shotguns and rifles are varying degrees of shall-issue, handguns are basically may-issue permits.
automatic weapons are banned
my RP character can own handgun for perceived self-defense, if authorities agree that is.
I checked Austria's gun laws for a tabletop game and they're also liberal for EU standards, yet we don't hear much of them, if at all.
but honestly, sticking to charts and data for promoting diets might not be optimal.
quail is less demanding and requires less space, I heard
I'm aware quail's being trendy due to being efficient
Poultry seems like a thing to go for meat eaters, tbh
Emissions (in kg CO2e) from the food supply chain ‚Äì the climate impact of food miles is often a small proportion (Source: Our World in Data/Poore and Nemecek, Science, 2018)
like poultry being better than cheese in some charts
then the there is a bit more nuance to it than it sounds
cares about footprint first
if someone
well, after reading it, I think

much lower footprint I guess than average First World diet with lots of red meat
considering I have periods of no meat consumption
I don't eat beef and lamb much so I'm probably good
I guess processing milk into cheese racks up a lot of footprint
interestingly, milk and eggs are in same league in impact as purely vegan diet
overall seems like veganism has edge, but you can eliminate that edge by not cooking right
https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20220429-the-climate-benefits-of-veganism-and-vegetarianism
I also might misrepresent numbers since it's 5 AM
interestingly, pig meat, poultry and cheese have similarish footprints in BBC study
especially if you're plugged to renewable grid
microwaving is most clean way
BBC took into account energy intensity and carbon intensity
method of cooking is apparently the most major factor in the footprint of diets, 61 % according to BBC's study
as well as sourcing overseas plants in general
buying lots tofu and quinoa burgers apparently offset that a lot
There are ways to basically waste the difference between veganism and vegetarianism by cooking improperly
the average difference between veganism and vegetarianism amounts to 1/3 in footprint, which might seem much, but vegetarianism also drastically reduces the footprint from average diet by half, and there are other considerations.
and so on
I like all beans but soy and horsebean
like I won't touch invertebrates that don't swim around, won't touch tomatos and cauliflowers, I hate bloodsausage but I like blood in my soup, etc.
I just have foods I don't like within each category
except
I'm just personally obligate omnivore
Since there's negligible difference between both diets in that regard.
And another argument, about carbon footprint, IMHO also falls flat if the data I know are reliable.
It is entirely possible to source ethical diary.
tbh the most annoying thing for me is when some vegans focus with activism on vegetarians, and that's where moralizing arguments can fall flat most.
the red-meat of poultry
dove meat good

sadly there's no pigeon there despite being called go≈ÇƒÖbki

having Polish sushi btw today <:kekw:783904540997976094>
I very much encourage to try to look for the kind of crops that's easy to procure in your location.
it's cheap because you don't have to source it from much far
veganism probably isn't expensive if you don't go for "meat replacements"
I think the best analogy for bumbleebees is that they're like Hobbits, they only go danger mode when they have to
and God have mercy if they do because they sting like wasps
less likely to flip out and start stinging unless you're too close to thier nest
they are, how to put it
pretty much, if you want to pollinate an enclosed space, it's bumblebees you go for
and vertical farming might be impossible at practicable scale without bumblebees
bees loaned to farmers for pollination are involved in up to 1/3 crops in some places.
I'm in bee business
if anybody listened to that thing among policy makers
I wonder if they're aware that they'd cause massive famine
I know PETA = opinion invalid but
weirds me out how PETA has tried to peddle that plants pollinated by domestic bees are not vegan.
honestly, speaking of diets again
the meat consumption in Islamic countries is pretty much about lamb and beef
there are of course diets that for example won't touch pork at all
now that I think of
when
no Uralvagonzavod tanks, no dishwasher, no iPhone
literally salvaging shit now üòá
> Russia has been using scrap metal from household appliances, computer chips, dishwashers and refrigerators for its military hardware due to Western sanctions, a top US official has claimed. ‚ÄúWe have reports from Ukrainians that when they find Russian military equipment on the ground, it‚Äôs filled with semiconductors that they took out of dishwashers and refrigerators,‚Äù Gina Raimondo, United States Secretary of Commerce who recently met with Ukraine‚Äôs prime minister Zelenskyy said at the Senate hearing on May 11.

Anyway, popping up again as a reminder that Ukraine's not only focused on fighting right now.
I suppose if massive layoffs start happening in either of 3, it's gonna be a sign things are turning for much worse economically.
I read a bit more into the picture of Kaliningrad, Russia is spending heavily in subsidies to keep the economy going there and it's also most developed Russian economy's asset outside of Moscow and Petersburg, so indeed we wait.
Maybe if they waited, they could enjoy shipments a little longer.
Let remind Russia that they pre-empted Poland, who despite memes has milder record than Lithuania on boycotting Russia, by banning rail transit to oblast from Poland due to "technical difficulties"
though Russia is today being angry at Lithuania cutting off land shipments.
yeah, like for example Kaliningrad is still churning out cars, just at smaller rate.
we need to keep up whatever pressure we can leverage (since some Euros are too selfish to stop buying gas, looks like), and continue to arm Ukraine (more and more, ideally, no dragging feet like Scholz).
More realistically, might drag beyond Christmas ~~as usual~~
the most optimistic estimate for when the war ends is September.
that's why they're opting to scavenge from other products
oh yeah, China still going to trade them semiconductors that aren't up to Taiwan's and Korea's standards.
it's not going to be a short war.
though Russian focus on Donbass started biting them in the South
It has turned into attrition war
they need to scavenge not an inexhaustible amounts of hardware, likely used, to keep maintanence going.
well, could.
Russia can produce tanks, you know.
Also it's just a reality that the same advanced semi-conductors that are used for military hardware are also used for consumer goods, it's hard to sanction either separately
Slowly taking ground in one specific region while deploying increasingly older models.
well, aside from saying that you need to check sources since Russia stopped being capable of producing their most advanced hardware.
I'd not get into it further, but I wonder how the internet would've been during previous European wide wars <:Harold:614928980788641821>
Pretty much because Putin was very effective at ridding of people like Nemtsov
pretty much a choice between 1) oligarch taking his mantle 2) Neo-Stalinists like Zyuganov taking over 3) Ethnic nationalist "liberals" like Navalny taking over and gasliting West into thinking Russia turned new leaf until crackdown on North Caucasians and Georgians commences.
I am enough pessimistic about Russia's liberalization that color me surprised if any Putin's replacement is genuinely committed to democracy.
so Russians can't be called out?
maybe I am getting old
maybe I'm some kind of boomer, but for me smartphones and other advanced electronics are not absolute essentials.
net exporter of sugar
shelves running out from sugar are honestly on Russians
it doesn't directly affect civilians in terms of most staple goods

I will never believe the stereotype of German efficiency, they sit next to North Sea and its windy weather, yeah they dragged their ass on exploiting it so much that they need to fire up old coal plants to make up for gas and oil shortfalls and price increases to keep economy going.
The woman who closed nuclear plants in Germany based on hysteria over Fukushima and didn't even try much to vigorously push for offshore wind like UK, the most cost-effective renewable.

disclaimer now that I reread it that it's analysis of attitudes rather than any direct dirt collected on German energy industry, but I can still see it. Germans quickly pretending that Russia will behave after the war concludes, whoever is in charge of the bear, is very ominous possibility.
the article was in Polish, so take my word or go through google translate https://www.msn.com/pl-pl/finanse/najpopularniejsze-artykuly/niemcy-s%C4%85-nadzieje-na-reaktywacj%C4%99-nord-stream-2-po-wojnie/ar-AAYCQgm?ocid=msedgntp&cvid=d11972b453994dfaa0e155c79b864ac6
The quiet arguments of resuming Nordstream are frankly deranged, basically they believe that'd increase German energy independence, and I don't know, at least they should admit they just want to profit at my region's expense.
the West's attitude to our concerns was patronizing, and honestly we do know for a fact that there are still remains of that attitude, with part of German establishment already debating resuming Nordstream 2 after the war according to interview with gas industry insider I read.
Russia should have been slapped hard with sanctions back then, maybe even in 2008 for Georgia.
Not to people actually living next to Russia, 2014 was already a declaration of war.
Romney was wrong on many things, but he was right about Russia, and I'm glad Biden has shown spine about the situation despite being from Obama's administration.
Him, Bush and Trump tried to 'reset' relations with Russia.
I'm disillusioned about Obama mounting any strong response against a rogue state like Russia.
I mean, it's either false flag or American volunteer discovering it's not quick adventure, there has been some foreign volunteers cracking under pressure.
the consumers probably know the prices will go up further because Russia now will have to increase shipping by sea

Lithuania just sticks to arguing that they just implement what wider EU decided to do.
> Lithuanian Foreign Minister Gabrielius Landsbergis defended the move and said his country was simply implementing sanctions imposed by the EU, of which it is a member.

> He said the measures were taken after ‚Äúconsultation with the European Commission and under its guidelines‚Äù.
if consumers in Kaliningrad are panicked, maybe it's partly Russia's fault, I mean if they just paint it wholesale as embargo then like, people sometimes just read headlines and act on them.
this is only about rail and about sanctioned goods
what I found in Al-Jazeera
> Russia‚Äôs foreign ministry has demanded the immediate lifting of Lithuania‚Äôs ‚Äúopenly hostile‚Äù restrictions on the rail transit of EU-sanctioned goods to Moscow‚Äôs exclave of Kaliningrad.
the narrative being spin now by Russia honestly seems like they want to focus on Lithuania doing it out of step with others which is untrue apparently, because at least some measures I think are compliant with EU sanction package.
if the counter-offensive around Kherson succeeds, they may as well direct some extra ships to Kaliningrad because supply by river might be out of question.
Also as I suspect now, Russia will calculate whether to keep civilian mood in Kaliningrad adequate or prioritizing supplying troops by Black Sea or striking some balance which may or may not please anybody.

I'll will say that I very much wish that Roe vs Wade's overturn will actually shift public opinion in favor of abortion rights like in Poland.
back in 2020.
because we already had similar ruling overturning abortion rights.
I live in a country that makes me say "First time?" to Americans today.
I'm very reluctant to just go and say that Europe is ahead of USA.
mixed bag
the support for pro-choice dropped from 75 % to 62 % compared to a 2021 survey, but I think it stabilized in Poland. I think it's inflation being the most pressing issue now, and pro-lifers have good reason for switching attitude from populist (that they have been doing it all to represent people) to elitist (that common people are too ignorant and misled to have a referendum).
rurals and large city dwellers are more pro-choice than mid-sized town residents.
the millennials are most solid pro-choice age cohort, at 99 % support.
substantial amount of zoomers voted far-right in last elections
zoomers having shitlords doesn't surprise me
but the pollster also asked people between 8-29 unless they typo'd
40 % of zoomers and very late millennials are against pro-choice/liberalization of the very restrictive new laws.
btw, a an abortion survey just dropped in Poland and I don't know how to make of it.
cordon off the court, blast loud stuff, make some mess, if they like their offices so much than they can stay in them, well, cops are gonna come to disperse you, but being victimized by riot police gives you high ground to people who aren't in bubble.
yeah, that's why I mean and probably Sapphire too
Sapphire complained about going high road, basically
Graffiti and loud, obnoxious (to Justices) protests are fair game.
at least I will make it clear I don't mean people should commit acts of violence against Justices, but if people don't keep decorum? Meh.
in my experience very few discords got nuked directly for politics and it was over violent actual planning (and then it's imperfect because some people fall through cracks).
CP is the actual danger that might get your server nuked
I like the most the fact that King George III's tutor, Earl of Boote, was represented often by a boot.
they just swapped the guy who tried to blow up the parliament with whoever was most disliked person of the season, at first it was about British officials and politicians but pro-independence (and after-independence) figures weren't spared.
the effigy burning btw often happened on Guy Fawkes' day.
I very much recommend to read how citizens treated unpopular officials in 1760s-1790s, it was pretty much bloodless but humiliating mob justice like that (unless someone fired at crowds).
burn the justices in effigy, as the founding fathers intended, and then nail down the door to the building or force them to eat printout of the opinion.
https://eurasianet.org/kazakh-language-film-content-makes-progress-against-russian-headwinds
I don't speak here about North Africa because the solar is the way to go in their case
Europe and Western Asia has plenty shallow seas
Baltic is good for off-shore too
well, there's more NIMBYism going on
onshore wind might be more cost-effective, but
Sweden could deploy equivalent of the nuclear plant we are dragging feet about in one year rather than decades.
we have to act now
erecting nuclear can take very long
the thing is that
off-shore wind has so many advantages over nuclear if you can deploy it.
I want them to go full speed ahead with offshore wind.
I don't want also Europe to just go full speed ahead with nuclear.
but if we do win the war for abortion rights, I hope the lessons will be applicable for other countries.
we haven't exactly overturned the ruling ourselves yet, so we don't have high ground over you yet.
enshrining Roe vs Wade like support in legislation for reproductive rights should be the minimum, not the limit of ambitions.
It's something that shouldn't have happened, but fait accompli are fait accompli
probably military bases will ignore the abortion laws
"Thanks" to our ministry of education arbitrarily changing how schools were structured and moving bunch of last year middle school kids to senior high schools without a plan other than undoing the post-1989 three tier school reform.
though I don't envy anyone who operated the clinic, it was fully crowded back then, my sister technically didn't spend full time there and moved back home earlier because demand was high.
my sister got really bad to the point of cutting herself, but while the mental clinic didn't solve her problems like a magic wand, it helped her along without victimizing her.
my sister's been to one, it was a professional place, not a jail.
I know how a good mental clinic can work.
he and Reagan basically uprooted the whole system without a replacement and reform.
mental clinics are not in themselves evil invariably.
no, no autism.
who stuttered
I believe the King back then was the guy with speech disorder
I mean they didn't care about his daughter having mood swings and awkward behavior.
His perceptions of losing face were entirely unfounded, we know for a fact that the Royal Family didn't mind his daughter's faux-pas.
Most infuriating thing about Kennedys is how Kennedy senior basically turned his daughter into a vegetable because she annoyed him and he was insecure about how English aristocracy received her moodswings. Noveau-rich monster.
but I don't know if he'd last two terms for 100 %.
he was born right in the period when it was possible to project image of good health with copious amount of medical drugs.
He had Addison's, back problems, colitis, frequent urinary infections.
he hid his health issues
JFK could've died on the job anyway
and how RFK would've probably ended up like Nixon imho if he ended up a POTUS.
my favorite takeaways from what I know about the period is how JFK had undeserved reputation that got cemented by martyrhood.
He was tall and imposing in stature.
It helped that Johnson was physically built for this.
LBJ as a speaker in one of chambers of Congress (Senate, right?) liked to go for basically what would be now treated as blackmail and bullying.
when back in 1950s and 1960s Dems did go low.
Nixon's shenanigans did a lot of damage tbh, Dems trying to make some point by being more procedure abiding than Republicans.
if that's meant to surprise me, it won't.
Eh, I mean this the same generation who squandered appointing a Justice over weed when Reagan offered to appoint a liberal in order to throw Dems a bone over something.
from being treated like a hard drug to arguably being treated too leniently.
insane how perceptions about weed changed btw.
meanwhile back in Reagan era, Dems didn't want to die on a hill for a Justice nominee who had a history of smoking pot in the past.
but this is GOP, he could literally tie a newborn baby to a catapult and GOP would still defend him.
|| In 1991, attorney Anita Hill testified that Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas had sexually harassed her when he was chair of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and she worked there as an adviser to him. ||
cw: sexual harassment charges
In other words my opinion of Clarence went down even further, I thought it wasn't possible.
This is really some Northern Wars and Thirty Years War tier of villainy (I will avoid the most obvious analogy to be more creative).
For example, yesterday Russians have destroyed a church's library, ironically named after the Tsar Putin claims he is emulating, that contained unique copies of books.
the quicker the territories are liberated, the less cultural and civilian damage the occupiers will be able to inflict.
Suffering will increase if they don't send enough help.
It's presumably because Lithuania enforced the embargo effectively, but the shipping has not been efficient or diverted enough to supply the car factory with components.
People are being subsidized by the federal government as if they were on an indefinite leave, an added financial burden for Russian authorities.
In other news, but still releated, apparently the largest civilian employer in Kaliningrad Oblast has shut down.
He has been trying to openly integrate unlawfully areas currently occupied by Russia into Russian Federation, threatened around neutral countries with nuclear retaliation to the point they applied for NATO, I don't even have to mention warcrimes because massing army for months at a country's borders and then invading it with a clear annexationist intent already makes him firmly an aggressor.
How we negotiate with a man for whom international treaties are just scrap of paper?
she hasn't attended high school at all, all homeschooling in practice.
miracle in hindsight how my sister ended up scoring well at finals and will be able to live independently soon, when she left mental clinic, the pandemic broke out.
pre-Victorian era West really did have different attitude to this sort of things.
it was practically on demand entire time through pregnancy because technically it was legal until second trimester ended, but woman's word was enough, so women who wanted to do in third semester could just lie.
well, if USA had abortion as FFs intended, it'd be probably too much for majority of society, funnily enough.
Founding Fathers' generation are not smiling on Z-gen yet.
this isn't yet the level that'd prevent SCOTUS from attending sessions
because he was being harassed constantly by creditors
the first generation of SCOTUS literally had a judge who did lectures at university decrying abortion but didn't always show up to SCOTUS
if you read your 1790s USA history

the longer the war drags, the reconstruction bill will be bigger.
but, reconstruction is far off future, the most immediate help Ukraine wants is more military supplies.
but who knows, we just recently managed to convince them to let Sweden join, so Erdogan will drive a hard bargain.
if we manage to pressure Turkey into agreeing to blockade the stolen grain exports, it'd be a blow too.
but while the war in Donbass is a slog, I hope that at very least Ukraine retakes Kherson and cuts off river supply routes to Donbass.

EBRD signalled its preparing for the reconstruction efforts, and at least some of the aid is meant to be grants rather than loans. EU Commission floated around idea of low-interest loans.

funny how Enlightenment era philosophers saw medieval age as one generic nondescript shithole of obscurantism, but it was Renaissance period that in many ways was more wacky
> As Renaissance occultism gained traction among the educated classes, the belief in witchcraft, which in the medieval period had been part of the folk religion of the uneducated rural population at best, was incorporated into an increasingly comprehensive theology of Satan as the ultimate source of all maleficium.[f][g]
not that I'm doing apologia, middle age theologians and rulers thought seeking out witches as a distraction from seeking out heretics, so like, that's actually one of motivations for cracking down on the persecution. They wanted to fry what they saw as bigger fish.
the paranoia about witches is something that actually bloomed during early Renessaince
nah, early middle ages' rulers seemed to be skeptical of witch hunts
Saint Augustine argued back in 400s that Christians have no reason to "seek out or persecute witches because their powers do not exist"

I literally reread yesterday about incidents targeting Asakuma, Kishi and the three interwar Prime Ministers before going to bed, it's wild I wake up to see Abe assassinated.
Japan has had a share of left wing extremists, but their m.o. hasn't involved individual assassinations.
The assassin's background as a ex-serviceman and the pattern for the political assassinations throughout Japanese history implies to me he could be right wing.
I think Abe got killed by right winger unless we have evidence to contrary.
Typical.
Russia btw still denies it was genocide and claims they just migrated voluntarily.
Sources state that as many as 1 to 1.5 million Circassians were forced to flee in total, but only a half could make it to land.[25][26] Ottoman archives show nearly 1 million migrants entering their land from the Caucasus by 1879, with nearly half of them dying on the shores as a result of diseases.[27] If Ottoman archives are correct, it would make it the biggest genocide of the 19th century,[28] and indeed, in support of the Ottoman archives, the Russian census of 1897 records only 150,000 Circassians, one tenth of the original number, still remaining in the now-conquered region.[29][30]
He killed and displaced over 80 % of Circassians.
He was also a genocider
end of serfdom was little consolation when Polish was only allowed in private conversations and the Russians kept pushing their foreign language in official capacity on us, disregarding the international treaties they signed in 1815 that promised us wide autonomy.
this is basically why the consensus here thankfully is that he was trash.
> However, in 1856, at the beginning of his reign, Alexander made a memorable speech to the deputies of the Polish nobility who inhabited Congress Poland, Western Ukraine, Lithuania, Livonia, and Belarus, in which he warned against further concessions with the words, "Gentlemen, let us have no dreams!"[39] This served as a warning to the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. The territories of the former Poland-Lithuania were excluded from liberal policies introduced by Alexander.
people also ignore that he took on a reactionary course long before that assassination.
Some peasants had to be able to move to cities so that they could work 12+ hours in factories.
Not out of goodness of heart, but because of state sponsored industrialization programs.
Ironically his son who is viewed as Turbosatan by Alexander II stans did end those civil disabilities and freed rural communities of reparations.
personally happy this Russifier scum got killed and Russia destabilized, basically his grandson mishandling things was one of reasons why Russian is not obligatory to know in large parts of ethnic Poland.
there was never a good Czar
I wished people stopped seeing him as the "good" Czar
His abolition of serfdom also burdened ex-serfs with financial obligations in order to recompense their masters and didn't end many of their civil disabilities.
He played into the pattern that Russia has perpetuated since Muscovy's existence, that the law is arbitrary and can be just disregarded if inconvenient.
introduced judicial reforms only to ignore them when convenient
basically behaved like arbitrary autocrat a lot
I have very doubt he'd have "fixed" Russia, since he

Abe did work to reduce gender gap in employment.
but aside from mistakenly telling women to die, generating several million jobs was an achievement that got erased by a black swan event.
you think I'm not aware of that, hence the image
Regardless of intention, the progress his policy made got erased by the pandemic.
Some attribute it to the fact that his wife was much more liberal than him politically and outspoken about it, hence possible influence on him, some think it's because he saw it as alternative to increasing immigration.
Abe, quite surprisingly perhaps given his image, was liberal on women's worker's rights as far as LDP can be.
In his capacity as Ben Garrison of Japan he pretty much means Abe's Womanomics when he attacks "affirmative action" (which has different meaning in Japan than in USA, and means push for making jobs more women-inclusive)
I've seen jokes that he put a hit on Abe and I wouldn't be surprised even if it's very unlikely

consciousness and its exact source is still matter of debate.
first, we don't understand yet exactly how brain works.

that's basically opposite to LeMaitre informing Pope he should be careful about associating Big Bang with God's creation of universe since it's a mere hypothesis (which wasn't proven at that point).
which isn't an accusation against having faith, scientists have proved since the advent of scientific method that they could very damn well be sober about drawing conclusions regardless of their faith or lack thereof.
he couldn't separate his faith from scientific inquiry.

As of May 2022, there are only three women among the State Councilors of the Yoon Suk-yeol government and only two women among the vice-ministerial level officials, so there is some criticism that the government lacks women's representation.[80] In response to these criticisms, President Yoon appointed Park Soon-ae as the Minister of Education and Kim Seung-hee as the Minister of Welfare, setting the ratio of female ministers in Yoon Suk-yeol cabinet to 30%.

He knew very much how clueless the colonists were, and probably knew about the prior failed English colonies, so he had reasons to suspect it'd be a manageable thing. He didn't live to see his miscalculation anyway.
The thing is that Squanto worked for a good portion of his life as a butler of a rural English gentleman on a rural estate.
I won't make "leopard eating a face" joke here
Squanto and his allies after all thought they could keep colonists as a dependent outpost of the English they could leverage against rivals.
Though leave nuance to more advanced courses, the general pattern of white settlers going beyond the original arrangements with locals holds.
He helped the colonists as part of a political revenge scheme.
you know the famous Squanto (who wasn't his real name, but his pseudonym, dude literally called himself after malicious vengeful spirit to make political point)?
it's a bit more nuanced than that, as usual.

there are Albanian majority territories outside Kosovo's territory, so those would be swapped for that bit of North Kosovo in theory.
because they argued that the Serbian government would abandon those who don't live in areas that realistically can be swapped.
curiously, also among Kosovar Serbs
there was opposition on both sides to the swap.

There were some talks to do minor territory swap and put issue to an end, but they failed.
So Serbians are angry about getting same treatment.

Belgrade doesn‚Äôt recognise its former province Kosovo which declared independence in 2008 and has been asking its citizens to provide a temporary ID for their visit to Serbia.

Probably smarter plan, but then again, some people predicted Putin would back off or just attack rest of Donbass.
The prediction floated around in late 2021 during Russian buildup was that Serbia would indirectly encourage paramilitias in the Serb part of Bosnia to make trouble.
Some people predicted there could be something going on in Balkans in short-term future, but the timing and location are off.
I think it is part of some joint plan, even if poorly planned.
For now, Kosovo's authorities urged citizens to keep calm and not be provoked.

since I mentioned books in my disclaimer, I'll just recommend Evans as the author to go for, since he has written general histories on Weimar Republic and Third Reich.
no, I said my piece.
It's been always the profession where you either rarely make it to make it your fulltime job or you are pretty much confined to writing being the passion project you do in spare time.
I don't think a merger will change much, and many authors also basically moved on e-books these days and there are plenty of options for self-publishing.
And I know personally a person from whom revenue from books is pretty much supplementary revenue because under no circumstances she could support family from niche vampire books.
It's rare to become bestselling author to make fortune out of it.
I don't think people should seriously expect living from writing books until they're really good at it.

I gotta go to do some BBQ, but you gotta read more about the political scene in post-Soviet Russia.
Clinton didn't encourage Russian nationalism, he backed one of two Russian nationalists
1) Yeltsin exhibited those behaviors before 1995
2) Look up his main opponent and what he thinks about the current war
That Yeltsin bombarded Duma in 1993 wasn't in hindsight a surprise.
you're not giving agency to people like Yeltsin who had ethnonationalist tendencies when they were overshadowed by Gorbachev in world's eyes
If you think USA invented Russian nationalism, then I have you a bridge to sell, cheap.
since 15-16thth century?
they literally harken back to Tsarist and Soviet rhetoric in their propaganda.
Mongols are at the fault, though.
Just staying out of things completely emboldens some countries.
For Russia to be non-interventionist you'd honestly have to roll back the clock to medieval ages and prevent whatever made Muscovy rise as regional power over Russian principalities and we don't have exactly a time machine.
if noninterventionism was the standard foreign policy this current year, Ukrainians would've been left at mercy of Russians.
Otherwise another, younger silovik will fill in Putin's shoes.
Whole political elite discredited, basically.
I imagine Russians would have to experience shock and anger similar to what Argentina experienced in aftermath of losing Falkland war.
I really can't say if Russia has a chance to liberalize without a profound shake up of the establishment.
the failed economic transformation really left little room for any non-corrupt and non-imperialist option, and Putin made sure to be deal with non-controlled democratic opposition ruthlessly if they have any chance at shaking things.
I can get the US logic somewhat since Zyuganov was and is an open USSR restorationist who endorses past imperialism of Russia and supports the ongoing one, but in hindsight they could've just done nothing. It didn't matter beyond giving ammunition for criticism.
He did plan to cheat from the onset to stay in power, he merely welcomed a misguided attempt at help from Clinton administration.
We're talking here about Yeltsin, a man who resolved a constitutional crisis with appeal to military force.
Yes, Russia had failed to transition to postcommunist democracy and USA didn't play much role, and even Clinton's aid in 1995-96 had questionable amount of influence on the way of things.
Russians made their bed and lied in it, they also weren't antagonized overly by USA (if anything, not treated firmly enough until now when they crossed further and further lines), and the one instance when USA lend its support to one candidate in the elections still had two nationalists with running against each other.
> Kat, you need to work on your ability to comprehend an argument. The argument I made is that Russia would have been fundamentally different in many ways that are unpredictable had the US have not meddled. And considering the US's role in intervening both in the USSR and post soviet Russia I stand by that.

And here is where I question his expertise on that.
Not just America's, but everyone else's.
Judge interventions on case by case basis.
he probably doesn't want to run into a Kosovar
His argument is plain ridiculous in the first place, so I'm not exactly wrong.
Northern Ireland only has known relative peace since 1997, and that's fragile one, if I remember correct where you're from.
"Anglosaxon arrogance", as the leader of Polish socialists said to Naomi Klein.
You deadass deny Russian society agency and pile the blame for the jingoism on nebulous American boogeyman.
you fail to understand that Russian behavior is tied to their past and the collapse of USSR that was largely facilitated by local political elites. There's really no point in that case to argue with you about it because you fail to grasp basics on Soviet Union's political crisis.

heckles people in chats about his "174 page script" but I've refused looking at it.
Naturally, as any failed artist, he's a conspiracy theorist, and blames Homestuck and Undertale fandom and "Stalinists in Hollywood" for sabotaging his writer career.
But never watched any other anime, let alone any magical girl show, refuses to watch anything else even in the franchise because it's "perfect", and claims he will write a masterpiece surpassing Madoka eventually.
Brags about heckling Christian preachers to "tell her story", keeps buying Madoka volumes to donate to libraries, claims it's a masterpiece and "deconstruction of magical girl genre"

<@!149704282793443328> refreshing it doesn't work
I only know few select people in private circles who enjoy it
yeah, I'm fond of Fist of North Star
average BNHA fan vs average HNK enjoyer

I'm not against Madoka, but I've encountered lots of people whose only point of contact with the genre is Madoka.
even Sailor Moon and Cardcaptor Sakura (which I watched before Madoka, ofc)
so some of them  have skewed expectations for other mahou titles (and don't watch them, unless they're madoka rip-offs)
my very first VN
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9eK0--_TmQE passing it around as request, I found it decent
716 (64.6%) total issues missed
Longest publication streak: 30 issues (from issue 35/2011 to issue 16/2012)
Hiatus x Hiatus
Japanese harsher on marijuana than pedophilia.
<@!278860841485598720> do they delete threads pointing out her creepy fixations to keep the 'joke'.
can't wait for that smug creepo Homura to be dethroned.
so I expect something new, actually
the 14xx show already incorporated lots of stuff from SOTN
but the question is... what they will do in SOTN period?
there's also nothing to do with Simon, most generic Castlevania MC, so I understand why they are skipping him.

he's infamous for improvised writing
gotta love how people read too much into Toriyama
Toriyama for a while remembered he used to write more humorous martial arts rather than beam struggles
Gotenks is fine for that one fight, he gave us some entertaining moments and techniques
Gotenks vs Super Buu was whack because Super Buu retained whacky moments
Fat Buu has certain charm
Mistare Fusion breakdowns manga well, from the story to the process of its writing perspective
there will be lot of CLANGing
and Terraformars
the studio made CGI Berserk anime
most consistent season
never ask a man about his salary

a woman about her age

AoT's author about the Japanese occupation of Korea.
especially towards the end
I personally think AoT is pretty hackishly written
the only question is how CLANG it will be
Berserk CGI 2017 team
it's gonna be bad

good summation why DB Super feels so shallow that I agree with.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omnpu8mzX4c after I got tired of listening to Symphogear OST that I downloaded, I've been binging African-American music from 1940s-1980s, just one of samples.

but it'd be like difference of better vs good
and I'd probably like it more, no offence, due to my biases for English localization of MG franchise
the English version has no vocals, but I'm sure the English singers could've pulled it off
Love Deterrence, yeah
like English Snake Eater: something out of a spy movie, but Japanese Snake Eater sounds like something from Japanese noir/detective show.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LRTM-kdEkI Certain someone putting a Sympho in the Metal Gear.

I still prefer English OST, but started looking how Japanese did the OST much different.
