Daiba nana <:ChrisEating:384879395829186560>
And as soon as my real job restarts I'll quit and go back
Oh I will
and you can guess that we aren't exactly a priority rn
Since I work in entertainment
but we are closed
I technically *still* have a job
Since I've dropped winter classes I cannot really go back to school until next winter semester
I'll be on break
Its just that were I live if you don't start appartment seeking early everything that is affordable and big goes VERY quickly
the actual moving happens on july 1st
They sadly live too far away to help
Talk to my father and he thinks that considering my situation I did the right thing
I'll get an "incomplete" mention on my report card and that's it
The solace in all of this is that I will not be considered to have "failed" all the classes i've dropped
The only class I've kept is with the teacher that helped me through her class
They know but they can't really do anything about it
1: I live in a appartment so I need to manage it and keep it in a livable state
2: I have severe ADHD, that even though it's medicated, it's not perfect and when working from home I cannot ever be concentrated
3: A couple weeks ago my desktop PC's hard drive died overnight, so I lost everything so I had to start using my laptop which had nothing installed on it.
4: I learned right after I had settled down with the laptop that my sister and her bf were planning to move, so I had to find somewhere else to live
5: 5 teachers, 4 different teaching platforms
6: Excessive workload
7: I keep fussing over money because I lost my job because of covid and now i'm REALLY starting to get poor
It's a couple of things that put together make it too hard
Yeah remote classes are completely burning me out
I guess it's better here
<:ZweiHug:672455346949980170>
I really appreciate your help
Thanks guys
Yes...
because i'd rather be working in a laser tag joint than in a fucking grocery store lmao
*unless i misunderstood what the main point was about, then i'm terribly sorry*
Then people would actively try to work even if their job was on-hold
If minimum wages were to be competitive with what unemployment grants
and to go back to the main point
since october
and "the time being" being well
that would be my case
but covid-style won't, because you technically still have a job
Also here regular unemployment would actually aid you in getting a new job
Mind you, I do not live in a house and do not have that many expenses
(at least in canada), there is absolutely little-to-no payoff to find another job and waste your time at minimum wage while unemployment gives almost as much
If they want people to work at minimum wage then raise it
for the last 6 months I've been living on covid unemployment grants because I'd earn like, 200$ more per month if I worked my ass off 40hs a week
Havent watched them all but I know plenty of people who'd vouch for the rest
Tbh most of it is good stuff
Sympho is in there so

is your mal username the same as here?
yeah its def not as bad as the vn
*The scans weigth a hefty 5.6gb compressed*
*It's just so fucking long for a manga lmao*
It's definitely not as great as the VN but it does the source material justice
Because of Gou I started reading the Umineko manga
don't think he will
He hasn't let me down
Trust 07
Same
I get that the first part of the season had it's share of problems
Idk if it's because they expected it to be a remake or because they genuinely think it's bad
I don't even understand why people hate it
I absolutely love it
here's the full thing I guess
and Shinsekai yori is a fucking masterpiece
7 years?
Legit before I finished XV Higu had stood as my favorite for like
You can't believe how excitedd I was
And i ***LOVE*** Higurashi so
*Turns out they won't*
Was wondering how they could wrap it all up in 2 episodes
Couldn't have been happier
Saw this when I woke up
I worship machio everyday
<a:MythCalliPanic1:756254206393974835><a:MythCalliPanic2:756254206616141866>
What a man
I'm watching the shit out of it
I swear if they ever make a metal band anime with music and animation like VLAD LOVE's op 1
*Missing truth and forever! Missing love and through your heart!*
***ZETTAI, UNMEI, MOKUSHIROKU***
Its excellent
Please do
I had watched the first batch of episodes when they released
Vlad Love is a good anime
Hachikuni Onee-san is the only valid version of her
*might get to see more ononoki content then*
Thats cool then
Oohhhh
<a:HibikiBean:689194152864645128>
What
You wont be getting more monogatari im pretty sure the entire thing is adapted by now <:coconaWHEW:252677693877911552>
*Windows Vista*
TBF a super computer for Kaiba probably meant something like
I dont wanna wait until july <:Depressie:688477327977480251>
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
Im still in denial that higurashi ended
and actually remember completely
Its the first full anime I've watched
cat site best site
CCS is great
If you believe real hard cardcaptor sakura has one-sided yuri
oh
You'll see those words so often youll never forget what they mean
that is all
***ZETTAI, UNMEI, MOKUSHIROKU***
Lets sum Utena in three words
I have no idea which one I used
The only eps you can watch half-heartedly are the recaps
Anime
Definitely
Yes Utena
Fuck
And its good
I guess it does
and then when it comes to shoujo-ai it falls pretty fucking quick
Bloom into you is a 10
You kinda did yeah...
when remaining in the genre at least
Honestly after flifla, yuyuyu, pripri, revue and madoka you start getting into much less good stuff
<:NotLikeMiya:611384640212697088>
Did you watch Yuuki Yuuna?
Yes pls more urasekai
And im drowning in lns rn so I cant really start yet another franchise
Despite the show being lacking in many departments all the mcs were so good
Spring 2021 is too Saturday heavy wtf

It wasnt bad but at some point I had grown tired of it.
But the second part goes downhill
The first 6 eps not too much
Would be up there
Vlad love as a whole
Man I aint watching another long anime until quite a while
<a:sleep1:587271415619911690>
26 episodes of fmab today
I watched
Not saying that your way off seeing things is wrong though
And boy did I have fun with it
Enjoyment plays a huge part in how I rate stuff
The ass tier animation litterally makes it great
Cannot agree there
I'll miss minami dating a walking webcam
Sad it got rekt by 1 episoders who rated it a 1
lmao
EX-ARM's score rose by 0.8 today
its a litteral insult to the VN and Manga
Fuck the umineko anime
Nobara though <:ChrisPray:672578403156885504>
What a glorious shitfest
Started Teekyuu
They pulled their songs out of every possible outlet
Pierre Taki was arrested for cocaine possession
It happened with Denki Groove a couple years back
But future nonetheless
Not much
She lives in the goddamn future
Reiwa 3 - April - 26
This was main girl's license issue

Fun fact
I loved.the way it was presented
Oh definitely
As my friend told me so well, Super Cub ep 1 felt like a second place movie at the International Short Film Festival
Ill get to those after
Oh
The s6 ones were something
Watched them too
On*
Om xbox
I own like, one sport game, nhl 2007
Def the most crackhead anime ive watched
This shit is unironically great
And by started I mean im at teekyu 7
I may have started teekyuu
Because of you
Oh btw
Do you like Fifa games?

Man the focus on the details is nonsense
Super Cub is the best advertisement ever made
Though i guess you couldnt go really worse than s1
S2's CGs at least are a thousand times better than season 1
Because atm the only thing i remember about the entire show is the garbage ending, and the fucking banger themes
guess i'll need to rewatch some parts to refresh my memory
<:NotLikeOri:548322507787075586>
Shit my memory is so hazy I don't even remember that
*that's it???*
i was like
Still, I remember when I watched (almost like, 8 years ago now) it, that I got so incredibly angry at them || litterally just taking a fucking car and leaving, and the show ending right there right now ||
ah ok

<:think:457717846105915403>
Which is so incredibly unfortunate
arguably the shittiest ending of all the anime i've watched
where it just pulls the plug and kills itself
until the last one
Shiki is a good idea for all the episodes
15 years ahead in terms of cgs
S2 is like
S1 is good but the cgs make it jarring to watch at times

<a:RenaEyes:726647573749956629>
Sentouin hankenshimasu came before konosuba
Its the opposite iirc
<:KoguBlessed:829371117671415839>
I see lynn <:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
She was just good
I guess big tiddied girl which i forgot the name wasnt pulling bs out of her ass either
The only one that played any kind of plausible mahjong was taco girl
<a:crying:669517191065894912>
Not just saki all the girls do
And never have I ever won a single hand with Rinchan Kaihou
Ftr ive been playing mahjong for a while now
Saki pulls of so much bullshit
But if you know how mahjong works
Saki was good enough
Yuzu and lime, two characters we've heard about in ray are two of the three mcs of the first game
Eager for next week
Jesus christ that ep
Higurashi is fucking great
Very good stuff
Lain <:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
6-7 different roles
She's had like
Yuuna's certainly is good but definitely not a GOAT seiyuu
The manga has a couple key differences until ep10(?) Where it fully branches off the manga
Because they didnt expect to even have a s2 at all when production started
Its anime only
~~just read the mango~~
That too
Yeah
<:ElainaTiresome:769347384646828032>
But a Cloverworks s2 sounds like a plan for disaster
The anime isnt bad
