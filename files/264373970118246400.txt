It could be ibu
I vote to lynch scrmz
Hmm
RIP Shirabe
I think it was 6 originally
Aye
We can try
NO
Nani
Which one of you did it?
Well
RIP qt demon girl
üò¥
Well, it's not me
And then there were four
She will be missed
It's 3 for Rakhi
What
3 out of 5 isn't a majority?
<:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
I feel betrayed Satania
Rakhi/ibu
YEA
I'm ready
I say it's time to vote
It could be Satania trying to do bad things
Everyone from the last round + Saki and Pats I think
8 I think
~~mod abuse me~~
Gremlins lol
Scrmz
RIP town
I vote scrmz
yea
Don't listen to the old man with the bucket hat
Was not me
ü§î
Yea
And Rem hasn't really said anything either
Pats is pretty suspicious
You're not W
Are the clones teaming up?
Is it scrmz and Sak
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
But what if that's what they want you to think
Ah
SHirabe has been quiet
Hmm
*looks at Saki suspiciously*
oof
Cause I'm decently sure it's not scrmz
Scrmz what do we do
Ooooooooooof
Unless Kirichan is in the mafia
Calm down
Okay Monokuma
RIP Luci
good desu?
bloodthirsty Saki
Fine wanted blood
Uh oh
low but not absurdly low
Lucifer
I vote
YEA
And then there's Rem
That seems far too petty
Is Pats secretly Dark Kabuto in disguise
<:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
Either way he encouraged Saki to vote for Luci
I thought he changed
If Pats knew it was Saki why did they vote for Luci and encourage Saki to vote for Luci
OBJECTION
lol
I want one
Wait we have those?
Rem lives still
Yeah
So it's hard to write them off
Rem never speaks
no lynch
Saved a life
Good guy doctor
~~This is where R gets to enjoy they're long held desire to see us all die~~
Uh, okay but we're playing in Duel Links
Get your game on
Aw yeah, this is gonna be radical
Pats biggest mistake was pushing Saki to lynch Luci
I believed in you
Scrmz why
~~We aren't supposed to know exactly how many mafia there are right?~~
There's only 5 of us
I vote for Kabuto
No lynch
YEA
Fine we would like to vote
But now scrmz is even more super target
I believe scrmz
Hmmm
Interesting
Wait, the medic can save themself?
Yeah, unless the doctor comes forward to say who they saved we have no info
Hello
no lynch
yea
but i dont have any suspicions
Well, if we don't lynch then the presumably 2 mafia are gonna get real close to winning
unless there's a quiet person I'm missing
So 6
Me, Tsubasa, Miku, Lily, Shirabe, and Iori
who hated scrmz?
uh
fuck
RIP scrmz
very confused
somehow
Then either the real doctor is quiet or Iori saved a mafia
And Miku and Iori are mafia
So I think then Shirabe was the doctor
Miku's def not a cop
When Miku called me mafia
I already said I was the vigilante
I think it only works if there's a vig/SK
And I fucked up
Unless Shirabe was the doctor
So I took a stab in the dark
I skipped the first night cause no info but I didn't want to let the mafia get to far ahead
The vigilante
I am in fact
You are a liar
Hopefully Shirabe wasn't the doctor and Iori's not lying
Pretty tricky
If Iori is truthful then he and lat are in the clear
So are you the doctor then?
Wait
Out of norm kills I think is for vigilante/serial killer
Is what I think happened based on the wording
But the doctor saved the mafia target
The vigilante killed Shirabe
So it looks like
OH NO
RIP Town
Well I tried
Miku
yea
Which means it's either me or Miku
If you're a cop who did you inspect night one
Said the fake cop
Fine told me in DMs cause I didn't want to out myself to the mob
If you're the doctor who'd you save night one
Iori
I was told this version doesn't have the vigilante suicide rule
Except
*imagines Fine yelling at me*
oops
well...
I'll miss Drunken Naked Iori
Talking
Are info is opposite
We can't both be insane
And sine Pats died that means he probably wasn't mob
One of us is insane
Me and scrmz have conflicting info
Kill Shirabe
Scrmz is insane then
I was told Pats was a cop and Shirabe was mafia
I checked pats and shirabe
I was told I was cop
What
no lynch
yea
ü§î
We have zero info which means I don't know who to trust
Oh no, is that another couple hundred dollars I have to spend on a Chris figure?
It's how I got my Chris plushie
You will
amazon.jp or yahoo auctions
As a red mecha meme I feel attacked
I feel attacked
Cute
I usually go to Play-Asia when I ca
AmiAmi will break your kneecaps back in the day
Usually it's just an item getting a rerun rather than a restock IME
I have never seen amiami restock
I can't wait for my swimsuit Chris figure
Aw man
I wish I could have it
HNNNNNNG
MY DAMN POOR WALLET
MY POOR WALLET
~~That would be lovely~~
I tend not to scroll backwards in chanels if there's too many messages when I wake up
If I saw them I did
Nothing much.
She would fall down and it would be adorable
Exactly
I would love a figure skater Chris
I don't think Maria and Shirabe have anything
Bikki also has a figma
Basa has a figma
Bikki has two figs and the Nendo IIRC
I love Chris but I do wish other Symphogears could get some figures
Sad
How many are there?
Must have slipped my mind since Fuga is an Ignite attack in XDU
~~Feel free~~
Or did she use Fuga before Ignite?
Wouldn't it be Mega Deth Party since not Ignite?
Fuga?
Wait
Once I take it back out I'll let you know
They were stable before IIRC
It is but I haven't unpacked it yet
I've got the Nendo put away atm
If I get the other two bunny suits eventually I'll have all the currently available figures
And I shelled out 50 for express shipping
125 for the figure
Let me checl





Something wonderful

Merlin is a lady in Seven Deadly Sins and that works pretty well imo
Yeah, but the colors are an edit
It's a fan edit
His desires would warp the reality around him and he'd have to get put down again
Ver would turn into a monstrous tyrant like the original OOO
Also there are Zenbus
I approve
I see a Yarn Yoshi
They haven't
To be the hero who saves humanity
How many of these weren't "abandoned warehouse district" scenes
It's been several years since I saw G
hmm, I need to rewatch G at some point
Did Ver ever actually successfully kill somebody?
Got these nice boys in the mail recently
Hmm, I guess this is the right channel for this

idk about a lot
They can be
Ginga
More likely is they'd take each other out because they both aim to be the ruler
Hmm, a world with two Vers
I dont understand the question
My favorite Kanade fanart
If it doesn't violate Facebook's ToS it's SFW in my eyes
Tomosato fanart?  üòç
Holy shit that's amazaing
Yeah, my school didn't allow phones period
And they are also younger because reasons
And yet it's still nowhere as good as Dead Fantasy was production wise
Vol 4 was just a bunch of walking with next to nothing happening and had to many plotlines going at once
Vol 4 was a slog and convinced me to give up on the series
Probably
All my photos are disorganized
I have no system
Hah hah hah
Maria with her hair down is <:ChrisSmile:336656717553074176>
Kanade has the best hair out of all the Gears Y/N
The glorious hair
Same tbh
That is my lock screen image for my phone
Lock Screen

Oh my lock screen is very different
Gen is a good dad
Chris is precious
My phone screen

I haven't sorted any images in like 6-9 months
Great meme
They should make a new Wild Arms then
Looks like she's looking at Kiri
If you want a short version look up Down the Rabbit Hole Chris Chan on YouTube
<@!263983345669505025> you burned out my eyes
Needs more roles
What did you do?
Asuka's great but Hisui is üëå üíØ üòç üî•
She'll never reclaim her #2 spot from Yumi
Poor Homura

Woops
"URAMESHI I HAVE A FIGURE NOW! I'M SO COOL!"
Yes
Oh my god

More like Oof
My favorite Jack art
It's only really noticeable because she's in story one of the pysically strongest people
Is joke because she has such a terrible STR growth
Those painted on abs
ü§î
Kerrik, Outside, the show she's from is called Charlotte
gx movie giving topdad more screentime when
The XDU OVAs I mean
I don't know about likely but it would be nice
Gokaiger is canon in the Symphogear universe

More importantly
Fine throughout history
Just do what Strike Witches does and make Symphogear teams in other countries
Redemption arc for her
I think Maria should be commander
Also, is it wrong that I don't want to call 55 seconds of action shots a good trailer
I feel like they would do a fake death for shock value for Gen and then he'd show up fine in the last episode
ALL WE ARE IS DUST IN THE WIND
"Miku I don't feel so good"
All of a sudden
Everyone is happy
The Gears win
Last episode of XV
Gen is immortal
We haven't had that since Mum died in G
Look I just want something of actual consequence to happen to the Gears
I want someone to die
It will be evil Aoi Yuuki the ultimate plot twist
I mean they better
December 28th
Yes
I don't understand the question " Will Kirika sing in Chris's birthday?  I also don't understand what it has to do with the dumb 25 o'clock system
What
Anime was 2006
Manga was 2003
You mean the year of our lord and savior, Busou Renkin?
>2006
YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEET
~~Melua would be my guess~~

For conveniece sake

Prof did
And let's be honest he's not looking for another wife
Only if Fudou married her
I've never heard that
Where did they say it was the last season?
Wait
Yeah don't buy anime in the US unless it's on a good sale
FUDOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
It's already out
SWORD
https://i.redd.it/bzx7ma0of8031.png
Gotta have swords

Did someone say post swords?
I'd says there's loads of content talking about that stuff.  A lot of it is just presented poorly
Freedom Wars?
l00d
And that's fair
But people are also free to not associate with them if they choose
I do agree that comedians should be allowed to make fun of everything
Well, people take offense to different things.  Dude needs to stop conflating normal offense with the overeactions some people have
They just won't pay you from speakin
It's not censorship if your video gets demonitized because no one is stopping you from speaking
connection
He makes a very very poor
Like there's one or two solid point but he buries it under a pile of hyperbole, bad analogies, and misused terms
Dude has terrible presentation
Finished bideo
lol that's a funny joke
There's some older OVA version but IIRC they only cover some parts of Part 3
Season 4 is longer than the other 3 but covers all of part 4
Season 2 and 3 are two halves of part 3
Season 1 is Part 1 and 2
He doesn't know she's is mom tbf
Yeah, but usually those are based on test scores and high school preformance
You'd be surprised Saki.  While education isn't an especially high paying job if you know what you're doing it can be an easy way to live.
Saki, there's plenty of people who go for those administrative roles for the easy salary and power
Jeez, that's rude
They enjoy trying to get rises out of people
Because that's what trolls do
Not a fan of the style personally but they are well drawn
No offense
Dad bod style
What are you accusing me of defending?
Not every law is just and not every just law works 100% of the time.  I won't deny this
People who seek asylum through legitimate channels I have zero problems with
Which is why I said most of the time
That law no longer exists though
Not necessarily but most of the time I would say follow the law
Because there are legal pathways to citizenship.  They aren't perfect and they aren;t easy but the exist
I do
He also went on record after the debate with OmniDestiny as saying he was ill-informed on a lot of the subjetcs discussed
I'm not going to pretend to know exactly what JonTron meant when he said that but give his character and history I'm willing to believe he didn't mean it that way
And I'm not defending any rhetoric here
That is the implication it gives though
There are plenty of Mexicans and Muslim refugees who come here legally so I don't agree with the implication that all of them are illegal immigrants
And car insurance is horribly overpriced IMO
Most places in America yes
No, not just "fuck you"
But until then you can't just break the current law and not expect reprecussions
Okay then work towards immigration reform.  That's fine
Guess not
Figured there'd be a term for it
Okay, then charge them with whatever the legal term for failing to pay taxes is
Charge them with the crime of tax evasion and deal out the appropriate punishment
I repeat "The law isn't always right"
A law we fought to get rid of
It's disgusting that you'd compare what I'm saying to a pro slavery argument
Our laws aren't perfect but disregarding them entirely isn't the answer
Because a country has a right to choose who it allows to immigrate
That doesn't matter in this comparson though
It's not a bad statement though
I believe it but it's not really something we canprove
Okay, never heard that one before
What?
IN other words, don't stereotype
There are good cops and bad cops.  Bad cops should be weeded out and good cops should not be villainized for the actions of bad cops
ICE as a concept is not inherently bad.  It's just one of many things in this country that needs reformation
I voted for one in my local primary but sadly he didn't win
There are good people out there working to push reform in the Repulican party
Don't make it about party lines
Get better people period
That is definitley not the equivalent of "the sky is blue" but I will also drop it
Is that another acronym or is that just a thinking noise?
And we disagree on that
I said a person can be both fasicst and communist
I didn't say fascism and communism are the same
Yeah, I'm not sure why it always has to be about convincing someone.  We can easily just be a group of people expressing opposing views civilly
They were are also communists
Lenin, Mao, Castro, Salin, etc.
You can be both fascist and communist though
That's pretty much how communism works in all the other examples of it
Communism is bad
Socialism done right is good
Also because communism is bad
Ancom is bad because you cant enforce commnism in an anarchist state of being
Ancom is even worse than ancap
I agree that a lot of cop precints are vastly overarmed
I feel like rich people prosper more now than they would in Ancap land
Anarchy isn't good for anyone ever
oh i thought you were talking about a character in the game
Who was Narcissa again?
Reminds me of the South Park episode
Same
What?
There is nothing toxic aout what Boogie said there
Hold on now
Well, he kinda walked in to that one
^
I mean, if the kid lies about his age then how is the server owner supposed to know
Not a fan of his though so maybe it's just stuff I haven't seen
Boogie's not really radical anything from what I've seen
Oh, fair then
Centrist is not right wing lite but okay
It's over
Explains a lot tbh
Langou's 16?
Goddmnit Langou
It always makes me feel terrible when I sleep too much
Been there
Riya went way over the line
I don't blame you
One possibility is to let the person know you won't respond anymore and to not waste their time
You can stop talking to someone whenever you want
Okay but Sparkle, the issue isn't the Anon, the issue is Riya
I se where he came from, I just couldn't disagree with/loathe where he came from more
Context doesn't make Riya's statements better tbh
In fairness to Ibu, Riya was absolutley being a malicious dick
Hmm, I'm not going to make a judgement on what was and wasn't transphobic but I'd say most of the people in the discussion on the Valkyrie server earlier weren't being malicious.  There were a few I believe were acting somewhat maliciously (Roseal for example, and Little Salvio initially) but I believe it's a bad idea to ban people just for saying things especially in a channel dedicated to serious discussion of charged issues.
If the person speaking isn't being malicious then should they be stopped anyway?
I'm curious where the line is
I'm just asking a question
Question: Is Jack Dorsey (Twitter CEO) transphobic?
A religion I can get behind
Finally
I have it on bluray
What caused the revelation if you don't mind me asking
Two years is honestly more than I expected
How long has it been since you told them?
Where does Kriisa come from?
I don't know at what point in their life the movie was supposed to end.  Was it covering their whole life?
I don't know
I disagree
Actors play people who are nothing like them all the time.  I don't see why this should be any different
That was bad writing though
You could honestly have anyone play the major and it could be "valid" just by saying she got a new body
She was originally japanese but her human body is basically gone
The major's body is a generic mass produced model
Either one really
There was nothing wrong with her taking the part
Like, even if you put adaptation issues aside it is just a terrible movie
Yes, DBE is the absolute worst
Death Note was okay
FMA was trash
Not great but a solid 6/10
Ghost in the Shell was okay though
Honestly don't care about this movie but the toxicity levelled at her was unwarranted
Because that's how Hollywood works
I wish I could find a job that gave me all of those thing
Aw man
But I was one of, if not the best employee at the store bar the management
No
That's how I felt when I quit my last job
There's not much to do
But
Mississippi is one of, if not the cheapest state to live n
<:ShirabeStare:336659688236122113>
It's just kind of childish
This idea isn't really vindictive
tbh I would either just tell them or leave without a word
I threw up at work today and I'm not sure why
A little annoying
He's okay
She is Ross's ex-wife
Wait.  Notch aligned with white supremacists?  When and did I miss that?
Okay first let's take this to <#377148557796442134>
There are no shots where every male avenger drops everything they're doing to do a group photo op
0
I am aware
I mean, the censoring is dumb but oh well just means if I get the game it'll be Switch version
It's still a fringe group that gets dunked on everytime they get mainstream attention
And now it still is
"resurgance" is kind of overselling it
God, hard to believe there was a point where Sargon wasn't a total cringelord
Oh, that story
I've never heard that last one Yor.  You got a link so I can be properly disgusted?
I mean, we could just not throw milkshakes at people
That is a true cesspool
But Sankaku's comments are even worse
Yeah Sankaku bad
OAG?
Tis a silly place
I just looked it up
fyi
Asuka Shikinami Langley
Get some alcohol ready
I'll give 3 this.  It gave Kaworu a slight shred of character
He didn't know where to go with after 2 either
He really just doesn't know where to go with it after 3
I think the stated reason was to try and differentiate that this is a different story and a different Asuka
Because Anno
yee
That sounds like the kind of dumb thing Anno would come up with
Asuka has always been trash
EoE is even worse
Eva tv is terrible
pls no
2.22 is the only Eva anime that's good
I hate Evangelion
Same
I watched Daiking and that was 1976
Scratch that
Daitarn 3 is from 1978 so I guess that
Uh
Bebop is technically possible
It's possible
I've sat through worse anime
I mean, it's a complete dumpster fire but the memes are amazing
But the mechs look so cool and it has Aoi Yuki in it
I want to see that abomination
When Valvrave in SRW
Unsurprisingly the music is the best part of Cross Ange
I plan to eventually but my backlog is huge
idk I haven't delved into any of the non English ones
ANything is possible
They made me like Cross Ange a little bit
I mean, they made G Reco decent and Buddy Complex good
"Milking His Most Successful Franchise"
This summer Hideaki Anno is
It's okay.  Let's just wait for 4 to come out, suck, and then wait for a SRW game to make it better
Most of 3: Shinji blindly follows whatever Kaworu says
All of a sudden Kaworu has doubts and tell Shinji to stop
Shinji: Fuck you YOLO
That's definitley a plan
And the manga is on part8 so it'll be a while before the anime is anywhere near caught up
Well, they did part 4 like two years ago and no word on part 5 anime yet
I loved the movie
I liked the show
<@449062815534153748>
What song is that?
I'm sure when CR throws money away to license it they'll give it some English title
That Adolescent Pig-Rascal Did Not Dream a Bunny-Girl Senpai
Found this on mangadex
So i guess it'd be more like Young Pig bastard will not see Bunny-Girl Senpai in his Dreams
minai is the negative of to see
I read that wrong
no
~~Note my Japanese is super rusty and bad~~
Young Pig Bastard Dreams of a Future With Bunny Girl-Senpai
So if I had to guess
Seishun = Youth
Buta = Pig
Yaro = "Bastard"
Yume = Dream
Mirai = Future
A lot of shows sound terrible on paper and most of them are
summary from MAL
Puberty Syndrome‚Äîa rumored, mysterious syndrome that only affects those in their puberty. For example, a bunny girl suddenly appeared in front of Sakuta Azusagawa. The bunny girl's real identity is Mai Sakurajima, a teenage celebrity who is currently an inactive high school senior. For some reason, her charming figure does not reflect in the eyes of others. In the course of revealing the mystery behind this phenomenon, Sakuta begins to explore his feelings towards Mai. Set in a city where the skies and seas shine, Sakuta unfolds the meaning behind his bizarre encounters on women with the said syndrome.
Which explains the really long title
Light novel I think
I wouldn't say ruined
Eh
ever
in anything
aka the best scene
Yes
üòç
Relatable content lol


Grand Blue is pretty good at reaction shots as well
I dunno


I was very wrong
Asobi Asobase I thought was gonna be boring when I saw the OP
tfw I didn't even like Miku until AXZ/XDU
XDU gave us a multiverse
It's okay
Chris is my waifu
It was Monochrome
G sold me hard on Chris and I've never looked back
Season one I was pretty much team Bikki

Okay but I'm totally not biased
Jun is pregnant from what I heard right?
Is he mad scientist?
Mazinger doesn't need worlbuilding
It's Mazinger
Why
So just like how they did Shin in V and X
I had one guy say his only problem with it is it's gonna dominate the Mazinger slot in SRW for the next 10 years
I've heard some people say it was really good
I'm gonna keep an open mind
I mean
Rate it on a scale of Valvrave to GGG pls
I member that
lmao eoten?
Out of the ones I've seen I'd rank them
üëÄ
Oh, so you looked this up before
>IIRC
lmao
You really are Saki
We make the anime play Fortnite and watch the winner
What meme?
There I talked about Evangelion
üí©
Curious
Eh
She was

I thought it was this kid
I'm just sad her character wasn't in SRWX
Buddy Complex is okay
Aoi was also in Buddy Complex
Aoi was in Valvrave
It's just kind of average
Ghost isn't that bad
And Ghost is only slightly worse than Wizard
I still say that at least as far as I got Exaid is worse than Ghost
I'm just really bad with watching stuff that's not currently airing
It looks really cool
OOO
Drive
Gaim
Build
Wizard
Ghost
The culture is strong with this one
Ass
Dat sweater
Rinko is top tier anime MILF material
And the show was trash before that too.  It was just very obvious trash at that point
tbf she fell for him before the rape
Not as fun as Cross Ange though
Season 2 was a fun trainwreck
Best girl in that dumpster fire of a show
I'mma be honest.  I watched the first few episodes of Flip Flappers when it came out and I really didn't like it
I mean
It's popular in the American Northeast
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
I'd love an Eyeshield 21-esque hockey anime
Can we get a really good hockey anime please
I'm sold
>Hockey Player
lol
I was gonna ask "Otome game style or yuri style" but you answered already
I fell asleep after I sent that sorry.  IIRC I got to the end of episode 3 and decided it wasn't for me.  I can't remember exactly what it was about it but I just remember being kind of bored.
It's like they're top sports series right now IIRC
It's Shonen Jump
scrmz pls
I need to catch up on the manga
I didn't care about volleyball at all until I saw Haikyuu
Same
Anime can make any sport seem like the coolest thing ever
Or American football?
Or volleyball?
How much do they care about badminton?
Did you delete that and resend it?
I don't normally play Nep Nep with ENG voices cause there's quite a few obnoxious performances IMO but I always liked ENG Neptune
Always liked Kurumu
Never was a fan of Mizore
~~Also just let me have this joke~~
The rider bottles show that things can have multiple best matches
BEST MATCH
Zaku Tank
BUILD UP
Zaku Zaku
Zaku Tank > The Ball
Gakuen Basara is a real thing that is happening
GioGio is coming this season
Only three more shows and I'll be caught up on this season
P5 is a great game and a very average anime
Should be funny
But I'mma still waych Isekai Quartet
I haven't watched Overlord
I think unless something really wows me this season I got to go with Megalo Box for AOTY
GGO was spring
Yeah Yuru Camp was Winter 2018
COMF THE MOVIE
Technically yes
Broke: Adapting the actual sequels in the series
Woke: Adapting the second mobile game
I only know this show because of the September clip
Not sur if it favorite this season
Slime show is good
Hmm
Is joke yes
Last one I watched was Super Mega Farce
I have not watched it yet
The jokes don't really have enough to them to be worth rewatching
The first time at least
I loved Akibaranger
Cause Akibaranger is unnoffical
No and neither does Sentai
Just not recently
Power Rangers has several great seasons
Hold on Sparkle
<:TsubasaDisgust:349013662775902209>
I still need to go back and finish Kuuga
They still have Chip Lynn on so it might be good
So it's kind of a wild card
I mean this will be the first one from Hasbro
It's called Beast Morphers
They are
Carter Grayson is the best red ranger
I mean I agree 100%
Drive Driver is perfect imo
I wonder how much Saban influence will be left in the Go-Busters adaptation
Saban has changed morphers plenty of times IIRC
They can though
But from what I hear Dino Charge is okay which is big sep up
Speed Race is kind of F1
I mean if you think about it
It is Shonen Jump sumo series
Yeah Hinomaru Sumo
The sumo matches are a lot more hype than I was expecting
I like it so far
I've been watching it
But it's not mecha
To be a mecha show there has to be an actual mecha
It's a toku series in anime form
Gridman is not a mecha show
Bad Scrmz
tbf that's not worth trying to murder him over
tbh I don't think the murdering sociopath is supposed to be relatable
Gridman just fuses with Hibiki and they become big
Even Inou Battle?
I wish people would stop overhyping Trigger
Toei is doing the Netflix show
See, the fact that they already made a female version of Saint Seiya really makes me question why they decided to gender bend Shun in the remake
You're not wrong
aka Knights of the Zodiac in America
Saint Seiya
Yes
And they genderbent one of the characters for some reason
Mediocre CGI
There's an Engish trailer somewhere
It's Netflix Latin America's version of the trailer
ü§î
For comfy stuff I recommend Flying Witch and Sweetness and Lightning
I did not like HSL
I don't know why exactly I'm going to keep watching Girly Air Force
My favorite ED this season is Dororo I think
Hinomaru Sumo's first ED was a banger
I loved Yamada's ED tbh
I love that show
That said Big Green dub is the best
DB is one of those shows where you really can't go wrong either way
Use the map
Hidden One Year War came out first
Checking
Ayy my Votoms bluray came in the mail today
It's episodic IIRC
IGLOO is okay
I basically only finished so I can one day say I've finished every Gundam
Eh I wasn't a huge fan of X
So halfway
How far are you
It is but I want to see it anyway
Soonish
It's a sequel in the sense that it's the next thing chronologically but yeah the overall plots are basically unconnected
It's kind of a sequel to F91
It
I mean I imagine they did the best they could given the situation of being cut from a full show down to a movie
But I got burnt out after F91
There was a point where I was watching the whole franchise in release order
And 08th MS Team
I still need to watch 0083
War in the Pocket is the best representation of the "War is bad" message Gundam is supposed to convey
War in the Pocket is my favorite Gundam and my favorite Christmas movie
Just make sure you watch War in the Pocket at some point
CCA basically pretends it didn't happen
I love ZZ but you can skip it
If the Netflix Cowboy Bebop comes out I predict it will be the adaptation to finally dethrone DB Evolution
Sad
It's on bluray
I have not watched all of Overlord (got bored around episode 3 or 4) and I thorouhly enjoyed the first episode of Isekai Quartet
Man the CGI Colossal Titan is still one ugly looking thing
I guess they're also infamous for how botched they're God Eater adaptation was
They're also known for the infamous "Walk around in circles and exposit for 40 minutes" type scenes like episode one of Fate/Zero
They're pretty well known for having decent animation that appears better then it is because they hide they're use of fewer key frames through clever special effects
It's all right.  Pretty standard ufotable fare
Very tempting
>Steelbook
I've not read the manga but the anime is very pretty
Golden Experience Requiem
There's similarities in character design and that's it really
no
part 2 though
Wonder if they're ever gonna make that season 2 they announced
Great song
Hey Gospel of the Throttle
Fair enough
I might not be able to read it all now since I leave for work in 20 minutes
You can DM me it if you want
I like what little I've seen it just hasn't gotten to the front of the line in the backlog yet
It would've only been up to the second game at the time part 1 came out
It wasn't big yet
Also JoJo part 1 ended before Fotns ended
That's pretty much where the similarities end
The two shows feature very similar buff dudes
We're just disputing your claim that they are the same show
No one said there was
But the actual characters, story, and settng are very different
I mean I already said the character designs are very similar
No I mean no one unironically says "Is that a JoJo reference?" unless it is literally referencing JoJo
okay but that is just a meme
Give me Isekai Quartet sequel pls
Although that said I am even more not a fan of the way 1.11 is basically just an HD abridged version of the early episodes
I'm not a fan of the way EoE changed the ending
The worst IMO is a toss up between 3.33 and EoE
2.22 is the best point of Evangelion and one of the rare enjoyable moments
Cruel Angel's Thesis and the memes
Exactly two good things have ever come from Evangelion
It is Trigger's best work
There's no need to give slack
Inferno Cop is great
After Inferno Cop of cours
And Luluco was great
That's a typo right?
>Gainax
Season 2 was slightly worse but it was still good
Disagree
And that's Iron Blooded Orphans
Okada helped write one good show
That's part of why it's awful
I knew that
I mean that wasn't an adaptation
Oh and their new movie
Let's see KLK, Inferno Cop, Little Witch, and Luluco
So it's like the music industry and no one actually makes anything
By who?  It was an original series
What
It was also pretty bad
We just gonna ignore Kiznaiver then?
Manga has been around forever
Upcoming anime about vikings
kino
Like do you have comparisons to the original release I can see so I have an idea of what you're talking about
I know what vaseline is
The what
My question still stands
The what
~~no one commented on mine~~
~~same~~
But it's just kind of average
It's not terrible
https://myanimelist.net/animelist/Red_Ranger_Wien
And the first special summon you put out on the board has to go there
So there is a 6th monster zone in the middle of the board
I'd like Links if it weren't for the awful idea that was the Extra Zone
Pendulums suck
Xyzs were fine
Rusev could pul it off
Seems legit
perrobaly
erratas are bad civilization
unlimit yata
Or Solemn at 3
Or Trish at 3
Where it is apparently okay to let CED be at 2
Oh what a world
He is even freer
AND STRATOS AT SEMI
wtf I love Konami all of a sudden
I miss 3 super poly Omni Heroes
~~Like my E Heroes~~
Which fucks over archetypes with lots of extra deck and shitty link monsters
And you can only extra deck monsters you can summon from then on have to be linked to that monster's links
||The OGs from V and X show up as guests ins secret chapters.  And then again in the postgame expansion DLC||
Yes but minor spoilers
Well
Uh
Yeah its not the full Gespenst experience sadly
Unless you're doing T Super Expert Hyper Custom
VTX games aren't hard enough where you can't get away with using who you like
I mean
Saizo and Sagiri are both really cool
The only good thing about Gespenst in T is it comes with repair and maybe resupply IIRC
Gespenst is not better by any means
No
The other gets Gespenst
The one you pick gets Tyrnado
You pick Saizo or Sagiri for MC
Tyrnado isn't the most visually impressive OG mech but I still like it and it really fits the theme of the OGs for T
There's Sagiri and Saizo
Or MCsexual
Melua I respect your right to a headcanon but c'mon at the very least they're bi
T was good
||This includes Huckenbein, Grungust, and Cybuster||
I might watch Hathaway when it comes out just for the suffering
I don‚Äôt even want to touch Narrative
I hated thunderbolt
Like I didn‚Äôt like Unicorn
It gets worse with every new series they do in it
I wish Sunrise would leave UC alone
I‚Äôve never heard that being that reason
Really?
Yeah the Zabis are terrible
Like advocating for colony drops as an acceptable tactic
While there are gray topics in politics there are some absolutely wrong positions
This comment might better be be served in <#336297840529899522> buuuut
Um
*IN Patrick Star Voice*  VINLAND!!!!
Which like most Inuyasha subplots just goes around in circles until it abruptly ends when the series starts to wrap up
Sango was the least annoying main character but that's mostly because she was cute and didn't have much of a personality
The only reason I watched the whole thing is cause it was on Adult Swim/Toonami
Inuyasha and Kagome were such insufferable main characters
I try to actively repress the fact that I watched all of Inuyasha
I don't remember that
I still need to play the remake at some point (as well as 4 and 5).  I loved the original  though
And a game
And a movie
~~It got a movie instead~~
That joke crossed my mind as well
D-Frag
A true clasic
Ah yes, the epic whistling gets me every time
That would be Kampfer
This was a good post
No
Ayahi also voices the bad guy kid in the first arc of Age and Manny in Reconguista
Yeah
I'm glad they referenced it in that Build Fighters OVA
lol that's one of my favorite seiyuu gags
They had it broken and then ditched it for the 00 IIRC
00 has very pretty gundams
At least it's not the 00 movie
I finished the second gen and then I kind of stopped watching anime period for a couple months
I never finished AGE so I feel bad judging it too harshly
Only bad ones imo were X, Seed Destiny and Reconguista
Eh I disagree
IBO S2 is still good imo
I believe so
It's getting 6 movies which bothers me
But it has a bopping OP and ED
I thank you for this
>Nichihoes
Pink and green hair is just bleh.  Those four look like DeviantArt OCs
I like butterfly girl and the one with the teal tips.  The other four hurt to look at.
Ugh I hate 4 out of 6 character designs in that image
Not being into high school girls is good taste yes
That is the answer
Waseda
Ahem
OMG ITS BARNOLD SHOTSINAGER
üôÑ
The anime was okay tbh, I give it like a 6/10
Two new seasons
Me
<:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
Stella Glow does have an undub version for anyone who's going the pirate route anyway
Noice
Ichika "denser than a black hole" Okimura
I just don't like Final
I love actual GGG
I need to watch Gunbuster
I'mma be honest even if a sequel fixed things I'd still think Final itself was bad
GL is good and I still really like it but it's hit DBZ levels of overhyped
I don't like the ending
But it just leaves a bad taste in my mouth
The action in Final is fine to good
I hate Final
I love GGG
It's bad
Unfortunatley
Take a drink everytime Shiki passes out and wakes up in a new location
Also Tsukihime drinking game
Ciel really got the short end of the stick in the anime
Deen UBW actually has some pretty slick animation
Tsukhime anime does such a terrible job of explaining anything
It's very flawed but it's at least coherent
Deen/Stay Night isn't that bad
The anime is in fact garbage
I know deep Nasu lore
That was a mistake
Speaking of backlog I watched Tsukihime last night
The latest chapter of One Piece topped Twitter's worldwide trending if that means anything
Yes
Luffy #1 every week for forever
And two seasons from now they won't be even though season 4 is 2 cour
It's a new season/entry
Well yeah
Season one of that was like a year ago
Number 7 went fast
Didn't watch seven people isekai.  Sounded boring tbh
never mind then
Oh
Choyoyu is Cautious Hero right?
*producers
It's one of the publishers
Motorcycle intro isn't Mappa
But zenitsu bad
Toucan is great
Then you said zenitsu and ruined it for me
Man, I liked that show
6
But the show as a whole was surprisingly good
Ending was a little weak
Yeah it was pretty good
Savage Season?
Yes
Anything SAO related that doesn't involve Kirito is decent
That was decent
It's certainly better than ALO or GGO but it's still kind of ba
Assuming it doesn't turn to shit like MHA Abridged
The line is
"Nina fucked a table"
It's a joke
Shame he can't get computer access in the asylum any more
HAVE AT YOU
SEVEN MINUTES IS ALL I CAN SPARE TO PLAY WITH THEM
SEVEN MINUTES
SEVEN MINUTES
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miP21jnj3RU
Let it be my absolute pleasure to introduce you to Code Ment
My sweet sweet child
Only Purple Eyes could pull off a Code Mnt
And boy
MHA abridged feels more in line with something like Code Ment
Like SAO abridged you still feel like yeah this is still SAO but more self aware
That too
They felt super tryhard
I hated those scenes
SWE's super cynical comedy style just doesn't work with MHA
I meant that as in MHA abridged is shit
But I'll let you find out for yourself
It's gonna get soooooooo stupid
I already looked up spoilers
Don't forget Moon Cancer
Gorgon is Avenger Stheno
He's not actually a lion man
Thomas Edison is pretty neat
You aren't wrong
Gil and Enkidu aren't servants in Babylonia
X and Y also sucked
tfw finished Shinjuku but only read up to Fuyuki
I'll read it eventually
Allegedly
Its your best choice if you don't want to play the game
If all you want is the lore then the wiki can get you all of it
I mean
Extra
AU where Rin summons Ishtar
The closest you'll get is versions of Fate characters that already exist
No but they know they are historical or mythological figures
But why would you
Not really
Muramasa is technically Counter Force
What's a Jinako  ~~never ascend Ganesha~~
It is a class
And Ganesha
And Gunner class
Lostbelts are basically Singularities with a new name
But 1.5 has 4 new "pseudo" singularities
They're done with the seven from the original arc
No
no
It's weirder that they air them weekly in Japan
I techincally could also just use a VPN to access Netflix Japan but I'm lazy
The rest of the world they drop them as a batch when they finish airing
But they only air them weekly on Netflix Japan
They do
Plus I already have Netflix
Too much other stuff right now
Nah
I wish Netlfix would let me watch it already
VPNs are legal
Divers Re:Rise
I wish they would make something as good as Build Fighters again
It feels like someone took a generic MMO anime concept and just slapped Gundams on it
It's pretty average so far
YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEET
Hollow Fragment is way worse than the average JRPG
Just skip the thor arc or whatever it was
You were so close
~~Except for Yuuki~~
FB added the Alternative characters at some point right?
I just don't want to play as Kirito
The worst part of any SAO game is playing as Kirito
Sad
I do to
No
Or you get busy dying
You get busy trying
Look
Also without the incest maybe Sugu could have an actual character
XD
I know how this ends up
I live in the south
Look man
It's weird man
Cousins are blood related
THEY ARE BLOOD RELATED
Can we retcon out the incest
And it's not worse than Fairy Dance
SAO is dumb
I mean sure
Also I won't spoil it but the ending of Alicization is really dumb
Except for Yuuki and Administrator
The problem is Kirito turns every female around him into a haremette in training
Her relationship with Yuuki is great
Asuna is fine when Kirito isn't around
You're not wrong
But Mother's Rosario is the only arc in SAO I would call good
That's a low bar
Alicization is pretty crap
Uh
I mean didn't he start the original version back in like 2007 or something?
Yes
It's just a blank image
I don't see anything
Very Ayahi
The one from FB is also good

Hat

Very nice
Yeah cause no elf ears
SHORTS

Their GGO designs are all better
I wish these kids would just play GGO instead
All the female characters who get development die
Damn it he's right
GGO Asuna is a thing
Oh yeah
Remove him
Yeah
I like Shinon
Also remove what's his name
Sword?
But I like Sugu's look
Leafa feels generic
Cause he's blue daboo dee daboo die
tfw Seven Deadly Sins might be the only thing Ayahi is in this seasn
FUTURE
<:ChrisAngry:336656958272700417>
Yeah, Sphere
Ayahi's idol group just appears as themselves
In episode 5
So apparently
http://hallofanimefame.blogspot.com/2013/11/quick-picks-log-horizon-ep-5-yuushibu.html
I don't see Ayahi on the cast list
Yushibu
She's also Felt in Gundam 00 which always catches me off guard
Yeah
And it's not even like a secondary character
Cause Ayahi doesn't take many new roles
I was surpised she was cast as her
Yeah
She has a great everything voice
She might get two lines in SAO
Oh wait
It's sad
Not anymore
Ayahi gets lines
Hot damn
OH MISTER
OH LOVE ME MISTER
I weep for him
My boy
Ishigami
Like have you heard the story behind ditching Lala?
I mean the reason behind it is kind of uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
I don't think Sentai has it
I can't find it so I don't think it is
Is Kaguya sama Blu ray even out in the west yet?
Oh wait
But no money at the time
I wanted to do that
I got a lot during RightStuff's big anniversary sale
Things get cheap once they're out for a while
Shop smart
I like putting things on shelves
I like blu rays
We've all isekaid
Did you know getting born is an isekai
But like we are people man
But Japan loves sex or so they say and hates violence
America loves violence and hates sex or so they say
It's just a weird culture thing
I mean not really.  Also and?
I say that cause the majority of anime don't have a lot if any ecchi
You mean the ecchi anime norm?
It's also utter trash
So it's kind of an improvement
Killing Bites ripped off my shonen anime idea I had in middle school and added boobs
Calm down Madoka Sempai
Merely illusions
Jobs aren't things
Just like what you like
Adult things are a myth
It's pretty standard ecchi harem from what I remember but I never finished it
YMMV
wtf
How do you award the rights like that
Wait what
But it's such a petty, silly story that I love it
So no idea if it's actually accurate
I heard this years ago
And after they split he wanted to ditch Lala
So IIRC allegedly Lala was based on the author's gf/wife
Implying XV will be the end of the series
Watch the movie some more
DARN YOU SANZAI X
I skipped that one
Oh
The what now
Just a girl who happened to be sick during episode 1
Not even a sickly girl
They piled too much shit on it
Like the MC is just too much
val x love is oof tier trash
Book isekai was kind of boring
Hataage is def the best isekai this season
It's right in that middle of not bad but not good but it still makes me chuckle
Shinchou is fine
choyoyu just is boring
Because it's easy
It's just silly
I don't really think it is
Is it?
It's pretty funny
You isekaid
You left the world of your mother's womb and entered this world
https://tenor.com/view/plotting-evil-patrick-spongebob-squarepants-gif-3462043
As opposed to now when they're translated a lot?
I would probably like KEY if they weren't so formulaic and try hard when it comes to the manipulation
I still stand by Majikoi
https://tenor.com/view/good-evil-starwars-emporerpalpatine-darkside-gif-4624104
Good Good
lmao
~~play the Sakura series~~
It's wholesome yuri
It's top tier yuri
:yumm
>Sakura Trick
Like Deen does KonoSuba
Deen can be good
üò¥
>Overlord
Taizai Season 3 is ooh boy Deen why how
People exaggerated it
OPM S2 was fine
üòÜ
It's not a bad thing
I have a headache now
Outbreak Company had a cringey premise so I skipped it
And it'll never get a season 2
We brought the isekai to us
Re Creatos is a reverse isekai
Digimon is an isekai
Knight and Magic I think
What was it called
There was one last year
Uh
Everything is an isekai if you think soft enough
It's almost time for Carnival Phantasm 2
Aw shit
That might be the weebiest joke I've ever made
Damn
Nasu just drinks with Miura and Togashi while they play Dragon Quest
Nasu doesn't do work
Lies and slander
Nasu doesn't even know what Tsukihime is
You have a better shot at Tsukihime 2
Never gonna happen
I still to need play Cho Dengeki Striker at some point
Same
Oh, you're counting the fan discs
4?
AFAIK
Both Majikois have full fan translations
I fucking love that show
Rakugo is amazing
Like MangaGamer treats employees like crap but they pump out a lot of offically translated VNs
Too stupid
But his plan is stupid
His intro was good
Azami could've been a good bad guy
Cause there's very little after it
You mean before Central right?
It's almost like Azami is a terrible boring villain and Central as a concept is too stupid for Shokugeki's world
Oh good they actually confirmed it?
This next 3 on 3 is the last chapter I read
Me too actually since I never finished the manga
Well if Season 4 is 2 cour you'll get to see it
Shokugeki isn't good but their adapatation is so poopy
Man fuck JC Staff
Shokugeki, the hentai shonen
Cause original YGO manga has a decent ending
Does YGO count as a sports shonen or a battle shonen
Toriyama had a decent ending but then he just kept going and going
Watsuki is Ruroni Kenshin and Buso Renkin
Araki is JoJo
Watsuki writes decent endings
I would count each part's ending
Araki maybe technically
But the demon tournament arc sucked ass
Man I love YYH
Sport shonen > Battle shonen
Reborn's ending was okay
Busou Renkin
Togashi can do it
Eh
Because Kishimoto can't write a romance or female characters to save his life
Sasuke really only had one friend and it was Naruto
Sasuke just doesn't have friends most of the time
In a roundabout way
So does Sasuke
Also Luffy and Naruto are different
Ichigo is the Sasuke template towned down slightly
Ichigo is a plank of wood
How
Those are the only nice things I can say about it
Bleach has great character designs and music
Embrace it
You must acknowledge the hurt
No
Tsukihime anime just sucked period
But he's a good idiot
I mean he is
And I still like him even without his internal monologues
Shirou is a good boy
Like I say it's a solid 7/10
I stand by my opinion that Deen Stay Night isn't actually bad
<:GenjuurouThumbsUp:336657189475188740>
It's honestly only cause I don't like Bryce Pappenbrook and Kaiji Tang as Shirou and Archer
Controversial opinion but Deen Stay Night has a way better dub than Ufotable's UBW
I love the mech designs
Really need to
Haven't actually seen FMP yet but sure
Otherwise it would just go forever
And there is an actual plot Solo
The plot is many serious arcs in between the comedic arcs
And basically took over Japan
Uh the premise is that aliens appeared during the end of the edo period
It does but a lot of it is easy to pick up on
Tis very long
Yes
It's far from the worst choice
Brotherhood is really good
I mean
And laugh at people
I just use it to have a list
But it's convenient
MAL was a mistake
And I suffer through the hell that is MAL discussions
I've never seen anyone else say that
I mean people = you in this situation I think
I mean the 5th option doesn't come in until like episode 7 or 8
And they aren't related
3
It doesn't look anything like it but okay
We Never Learn
I'm just glad BokuBen is making harem anime good again
XD
Dirty Nitro
How do you manage that
Too stupid for a world built upon foodgasms
With smatterings of route 3
More like 1.5 route
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2zZ2vjjDa8
I do know hurt
Know it
Ah damn can't recomend this 51 episode mecha anime then
They cannot be contained
I can't
No
How may I be of assistance
Henlo I am normal JoJo fan
I'm assuming he means Dragon Ball
And then in 2121 they release the 6th and final movie with a teaser for season 2
Men of culture
Ah
Back then we watched anime in 240p in 8 minute chunks on Youtube
Some say it never really ended
Some thought it would never end
It was a good time
2 full years
Get banned by Konami for forever
So many games
Reminds me of when I watched YGO Zero, Duel Monsters, and GX all back to back
Ah man
The ED's not much better in the animation department but at least it has a couple of good art shots
Agreed
Saber is my Borger King
that sounds heavenly
üçî
borger
I have predictions
Still need to watch this week's
Procedes to OHKO his opponent
Arthur: Strange, I should be winning this fight.  Wait, why is my sword in my right hand?  I'm left handed
Do you require my assistance
Just waiting to see the price
Very excited
Bobobo Blurays
Yes
It's not
Id you don't like the show you won't
If you like the show you'll like it
Konosuba movie was pretty good
I am also at the konosuba movie waiting for it to start
It's a commercial for the mobile game collab they're doing
It made over $1 million for the two days it was in American theaters
Hour and a half to be precise
<:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
I'm tempted to see Weathering with You in theaters even though the trailers don't do it any favors
Not sure if Fathom does stuff in Canada but if they do they typically line up showings the same day
Not sure if I want to see it in theaters
Apparently we're getting a Kaguya screening next month too
Thankfully we at least got a screening for Mononoke here
Fathom's doin their Ghibli Fest this year
Nah I live in Mississippi
Super glad I got to see it in theaters
My theater actually had a fathom screening for Princess Mononoke
So I got super lucky this month
I wouldn't mind being able to see it in theaters
Too bad there's no showings in my area
Neat
I honestly forgot Sawano did KlK
I am suddenly interested in it
Wait Sawano did the OST for Promare?
I enjoyed it when it aired but I barely remember it
I think Millhi likes it is what's being said
I'd say Girl's Last Tour is the best show of that bunch
Sounds like a party
Mars of Destruction
The title Flip Flappers sounds like it should be set in 1920s America tbh
Beautiful
<:MikuPraise:585839808765493249>
Majestic Prince
Okay that's better but still too much
76 dollars for a bad anime is too much
No thank you
No
lol wut
Wow that is heavy score bombing
But at least it's a good show
I mean Brotherhood is a little overhyped
3.5 but yeah massively overhyped
Cursed
Can confirm Nana
At least Cross Ange was entertaining in its stupidity
Franxx started with potential and quickly shot and buried it
state from steak farm
STEAKS
No you say it with more crippling depression
Robert Downey Jr/
Iron Man
I always recognize Aoi
After like the fourth time I go "that sounds like this character"
I learn names eventually
Oof
So I assume its awful
I can't imagine a western company putting effort into a Cross Ange dub
Is good movie yes
I can‚Äôt think of any gundam games with a heavy seed bias besides those two
Well at least I am still the superior Chris padoru
Gasp
It changed
ZENBU YOROKOBE
Build  Fighters is a sports anime before its a Gundam anime
War in the pocket is the best Gundam
Yoko hikasa
Angelic Layer is late 90s
Angelic Layer?
Fine it was a ripoff of Custom Robo
Danball was a ripoff of Metabots
Good for you
Miso did
Try was just a let down
No Build Divers is a dumpster fire
Ooh whee I knew Gainax had been doing bad but not this bad
https://twitter.com/socialanigirl/status/1211641855143792640?s=19
Yeah looks like wing to me
I made my CaC with the red haired one since Yoko Hikasa also did Rias in DxD
This version is usually sadly Japanese only
Most Gundam games sell a separate version with the the OPs
Lafter
Ayahi was in 00 but for some reason she‚Äôs not an option even though she was in the last game
Eyepatch Lady is pretty memorable
Tbh I forgot about that part of Mirai Nikki as well
She‚Äôs like Yandere lite
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
Doesn‚Äôt ring a bell

I am also curious
https://tenor.com/view/halter-beyin-komik-brain-workout-gif-13417733
That's like the end of season 2/beginning of season 3
So shortly after the basement
It was right after where season 3 ended
Yeah
Then it nosedived again
It improved for a little bit after the timeskip
No it doesn't
This is the best episode this season
Ayahi has so many lines
>Episode 11 of SAO Underwear War
That's the firstone
Here Aya
https://youtu.be/sn34XAD4LCI
lol
Just buy them all
It's been at least five years
Maybe
I mean they made a movie after the tv show and left the tv show on a cliffhanger
And I haven't seen the rest
Kyokai no Kanata is fine but IIRC the tv series doesn't have an ending
Trinity Seven is decent ecchi batle shonen
Gakkou Gurashi is okay
Flying Witch is wholesome goodness
10/10
SAKAMATO DESU GA
Nobuna Oda is probably the best Gender Swapped Nobunaga anime
Same with Shobitch but IIRC Aoi voices the GF
Rail Wars is only for the ecchi tbh
Mitsuboshi Colors is cute
Stella no Mahou is cute
Totally unbiased opinion and not just cause Ayahi
Feldt is best girl
It's pretty fucked up
I know the story
Oh yeah
CDA?
Kamille is great
But not by much
Renton gets better
If only Holland was the protag
0080 is my favorite
A movie
It's
Awakening of the Trailblazer
4chan tis a place
pol is the board we don't go to
Okay
Oh new was news
I'm not familiar with new
M is mecha
Pol is politics
I'd equate a mobile suit to being more like a gun than a uniform but that's just me
True even though I've never been a fan of the OG Zen uniforms
Or is it just that Zeon is special for being the OG
Do you think there's no Blue Cosmos fanboys because there's just not that much SEED nostalgia
Blue Cosmos
I just ignore them
Cause there's been many different Zeons
I honestly think it's less saying "Zeon was right" then it's saying "Char's dad was right"
4chan is like a zoo
yes /a/ does hate itself
Also that /a/ hates anyone who disagrees with /a/
Just remember that /a/ has shit taste
Just sharing nice wallpapers
No actual talking most of the time
/wp/ is wallpapers right?
/wp/ is good
Oh
Is /c/ comics?
That might be correct
Yeah big boards are full of edgelords and shitposters
I haven't been on mu in ages
It is Aya but it's also what Melua said
/fit/ is a meme board
/k/ is for weapons
/vg/ is pretty tame normally IIRC
As 4chan usually does
I think that is where the d comes from
h is normal hentai
It's for hardcore porn
d is alternative
/b/ and /d/ will scar you
/pol/ is not to be trusted
/a/ is for shitposting
/m/ is mostly okay
A place best navigated carefully or not at all
I just detest Mother's Basement
<:TsubasaDisgust:349013662775902209>
There's probably a lot of /pol/s who like Zeon too much
I'm sure that's happened plenty of times
Some will bite your head off
Some of the animals (boards) are nice to look at and are safe to pet
Oh then yes they announced it today/yesterday
Which one is your favorite?
I reaffirm that it's not shit but it is overhyped
Oh
Shield Hero is confirmed for season 2 and 3
Because fansubs care somewhat and official subs are just collecting a paycheck
^^^^
<:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
Now he's dunking on the anime because it's not on CR
He shilled it a couple years ago when his wife (then girlfriend) was streaming the game
It's funny watching him shit on something semi popular just cause it's not on Crunchyroll
Yes that is the latest Twitter tea with him
desu
TIs what it does
But he is not Gai
Hello robit
I'm talking about Gai, not Guy
No
I see why all the middle aged moms in the 90s were super mad when Jetman ended
Gai is a cool ranger
Now Gai
I liked him when I watched new but looking back not as much
Lupat was kino
But of course I haven't watched every single one
More like a third
I don't know if I'd say half
J and Jin are the best gold silver duo
Sad
You must not've met Beet J Stag
Go-Busters is close to the GOAT
Hold up
Like Zyuohger
Build is great
Gokaiger was my first sentai as well
The anime was too edgy to
Shout Factory hasn't done BD for any of their Sentai releases
Garo's just too edgy for me
Then all hope is lost
Sad
They're the only reasonable way to legally watch toku in the west ~~except for Power Rangers~~
Support Shout Factory's sentai releases then Krika
That doesn't help me much
I'll stop pirating anime when I can afford to buy it all on bluray
Dess
Tyranno sensei is the coolest
It's pretty funny
This one right?
https://myanimelist.net/anime/40483/Murenase_Seton_Gakuen
Is joke dess
From what I hear Nanoha is similar to Gear
You talking about My Gym Partner's a Lone Wolf Aya?
They're honestly not even shit
Deen Stay Night is honestly overhated
RIP
God I wish that was me
IIRC season 1 doesn't actually have answers
Uh
<:ChrisEnraged:423196924368388105>
Reminds me of that shoe hat video
Oof
Log Horizon lives
Wow
Eyyyyyyyyyyy, GGG
I mean, I can see the title.  I was wondering if it was from something
What this song playing now?
I have a pretty self-deprecating sense of humor
It's just a joke tbh
I listen to a decent number of rock/punk/ska bands
Well some genres
I like non-weeb music
It grew on me
Surprise Drive is great
Yeah
MAZINGER ZETTTTTTO
The show is a mess
I enjoyed Forces even though it was pretty mediocre
No matter how bad Sonic games are most of the time at least they still have great music
They still kick ass tbh
I unironically love this song
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dyaJCg0T-cY
huh
I love Knight of the Wind
Oh
The what now?
buttrock?
Emiya in a nutshell
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sa-y_wqGg8s&t=0s
I was curious cause this was in my sub feed earlier
In honor of Ayahi day
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kzge6KATp_s
Yes but if by some miracle it is it's still just a wild guess
Noble Red I imagine
Yeah, and one of them was in PlayStation All Stars
Looks like Toro and Kuro the Sony Cats
You guys are really speaking my language
If only Uplay didn't exist I might
Opened 75 packs got 5 legendaries
I'm in now
Wait, when did Iris Heart actually sex someone?
Smash 4.5 me thinks
Smash 4 Switch
üÜó
"It's not like Nintendo to half ass things"
>Implying Smash isn't an upgraded port
And Mario 3D World
As of now I think XBX and Pikmin 3 are the only big Wii U games that don't have Switch ports announced
So just like XB1 and XB2
But most of the side quests are really interesting
The story is a little lacklustre tbh and it sucks that it ended on a cliffhanger
XBX has the best combat in the series and the open world is beautiful
The dub is bad.  Luckily I'm a dirt weeaboo who loves JP seiyuu
Handheld mode and tv mode aren't a factor AFAIK
From what I understand it happens if you leave the game on in sleep mode for too long
Not nearly as good as XBX tho
XB2 is good.  Only problem is it crashes every now and then
Which PSX emulator are you using?
Fair enough
Cause if so, then I'd say the 6 bucks it costs as a PS1 classic is worth it
I mean, do you have a PS3/PSP/Vita?
I have Saga but haven't played it yet
Gears was good.  Would've been great if they'd been able to finish it
I have no other problems with the game then the story being incomplete and a sequel looking unlikely
The story is the only weak point in the game
The New LA theme isn't one of my favorites in XBX but it's still pretty good
I enjoy Sawano's music quite a bit.
The music is amazing
From what I remember Monolithsoft didn't even consider it a AAA game so it might not have been that expensive to make
Like it didn't sell amazingly well but I have no idea what Nintendo expected from it so it's hard to say if it flopped
Sauce?
Heck, it was alredy a menu on the Wii U version if you played only using the gamepad
I really don't think it'd be that hard to just make it a menu
They'd probably just make it a menu like Splaon 2 did
PS4 most likely.  I like getting trophies and I played the other 3 on PlayStation
Nice, can't wait for the NA release
Nice, how is it?
Ooh, is that VC4?
Mina
The hardest part is deciding who is best girl
Mama Bakugo is great and doesn't put up little Bakugo's shit
Pro Tip: You can't
Name a Boku Hero girl who isn't great
There's no indicator but with Luck*2 it's got the highest rate in the game so at a certain point it's almost guaranteed
<:GenjuurouThumbsUp:336657189475188740>
Use one Nosferau tome infinitley
Armsthrift is probably one of the best support skills in the game
Ignis is pretty great.  It has a super high activation chance IIRC
Shadowgift which is actualy only available on Aversa and Morgan so forget that one
Not bad perse, but I feel like there's more effecient skills.  I find that having only or two active skills is good and using other slots for things like Armsthrift, Galeforce, and in Robin's case Dark Gift
I know for sure each hit of Astra has seperate rolls for other skills
So IIRC each skill gets an individual roll
Shoot
Ayahi singing opera >>>> anything tbh
Her singing is godly so duh
She's also done supporting roles for a handful of Gundam shows
Cardfight Vanguard, Inazuma Eleven, and Beyblade come to mind
She's done a lot of stuff for kids shows
idk
sadly
Most widely known one is Lisbeth in SAO probably
But honestly Chris is her best role
She's had like three whole lines as Dererriere in Seven Deadly Sins
Yes
Hibiki has tits
Man, I wish the PS2/PS3 OGs had ENG subs
I feel like Basa and Maria should know it
Her English covers are super cute.  I love them
"Ai no hi" gives me chills
It'd be hard to get worse than SuMo and X/Y
It's only tolerable in GO because of the AR gimmick
pls no.  It'd be really tedious in a real Pokemon game
Pokemon should never become mmo-like
pls no
All "leaks" are fake.  If the game comes out that just means the "leaker" got lucky with his shot in the dark
Star Fox Grand Prix doods
Pokemon Nuclear is coming I swear it's legit
Well, yeah.  "OMG POKEMON LEAKS" is some tasty clickbait
Fake
It peaked with gen 4, plateaud with gen 5 and has gone slightly downhill since
I don't like her character design
Nui isn't cute and her shitty personality makes it worse
Nonon > Satsuki > Mako > Ryuko > literal garbage > Nui > poop > Ragyo
Nonon > Everything
She is best KLK girl
Blasphemy
Like as a whole I don't like it
The double standard is pretty apalling
Wow, these people suck to put it mildly
But I doubt it at this point
I hope they manage to change Valve's mind
Lame
Did stuff get removed yet or are we still in the limbo phase?
It wasn't until yesterday
Screw this move from Steam
Oh...
I don't know what /ss/ means
Never seen a moth girl before now
Huh
Sorry I can't hwlp
I've only played a few games on PPSSPP and I've never encountered an error like this
Um
I've used it before
Really reminds me of classic Harvest Moon
Stardew is great
Jude's one of my favorite JRPG MCs
I want to say at least one WA game involves singing
So I've heard
1 and 2 I have digitally on my Vita/PS3
I've had 3 for a while
I found 4 and 5 at a retro store back in January
I would've started already if Super Robot Wars X didn't come out
I have all 5 games ready to go
Man, I might finally do my Wild Arms marathon after I finish this Nuzlocke
Oh, I'm tired, mb
I think if you're an MMO you don't count as a JRPG anymore
At least FFXIII isn't the worst FF
Trails in the Sky
SNIKT
The Great Unlocking
Buy Skyrim on Discord
Yeah, now you can buy Skyrim again
I don't keep count anymore
110 huh?  That's cute
I shouldn't think about my backlog
Thinking about my backlog now
That'd be nice
If only the PS3 version got localized
I wish I still had a 360 to finsih Vesperia
I like when MCs are punchy types
Ah, I also have TitS one
I've got Cold Steel 1 and 2
I should play these games at some point
Falcom pls
Which is part of a larger series called Dragon Slayer
But I didn't realize that series was a part of an even bigger series
Man, so I knew TitS and Cold Steel were part of a bigger series
k.  I'm playing the first two on my Vita so I should be able to get some screenshots
Oh yeah, Kerrik.  I decided I'm gonna start my Wild Arms marathon sometime tomorrow
ZENBU DESS
ZENBU ZENBU ZENBU
The mayor gave me a magic infinite supply of bombs
This horse just kicked me
Others dunno
Rudy yee
As is my tradition his name is Davis
I think I'll be the wandering youth
That is my absolute jam in RPGs
Yo, I get to choose my MC
Just starting Wild Arms 1 and this opening cinematic has so much whistling I thought it was G-Beat
And some of them are trash and don't give you rewards when you kill enemies with it
Neptunia has that in some games but they make you unlock it
This part should be in every RPG
"but it completely skips the fight if the enemy is too low level for you."
Random Encounters are k as long as the rate's not too high
Giving me a Yes/No option but looping until I hit yes
Oh, Wild Arms is doing that thing I hate
She'll cry?
Buy Skyrim for yur PS7
I've only played Bioshock 2
~~The trick to countering Olimar is to 1v1 him when everyone else is dead~~
No one knows how to counter Olimar
I play Olimar
I don't pay attention to tier lists
Can I just get PM Ike
But I always want certain peeps in
I mean, I'm not worried unless they cut Megaman
*crosses fingers for characters I want*
Unless Smash gets delayed
The new system mover
Sympho musou would be hype
idr
And except for Bayo I think they're all still scheduled for this year
Well, those are all coming
Roster issues aside FEW is pretty solid
My keyboard sucks okay
XB2/BOTW/Arms/Splatoon 2 are all nice
I bought mine for Odyssey and the ventual Fire Emblem
Lucina and Roy should be cut
Like, I love FE but even I think that 6 is too many FE characters
It's a super common complaint
Really?
They hate that FE is the second most represented series
Nowi would probably be extra salt
Add more FE characters to annoy the Smash fanboys
I'm sure they have some of those
If only
If it's Smash 5 I hope they name it Smash Clusterf*ck
8 is a mega cluster tornado of fucks
4 players is a clusterfuck
If Switch doesn't have online 8 player I'll be sad
Wii U has 8 player which is amazing
It's what my friends play on now and Smash Run >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Smash Tour
I kinda wish I still had Smash 3DS
I just don't want to hook it up
I mean, I still have Smash Wii U
Bowsercide though
Ganonciding is fun
Bowser/Diddy/Dorf/Dedede/Falco/Falcon/Marth/Ike/Sonic/Jr./Lucina/Duck Hunt/Ryu/Mii Brawler
Let's see
I play Yoshi > Megaman > Olimar > like 10 other people I like playng
Except for the guy who wins
We're all bad
But I play like a third of the roster in Sm4sh so tier lists aren't things I think about
You never know with Samurai
As long as they aren't basically clones anymore
I'd be okay with that
~~inb4 third Link~~
Link is def safe but I want either him or TL to get a redesigned moveset.  It'll probably be normal Link with BotW moves
I don't like Bayo and I don't like the shady way they did the Smash Ballot
I'm saying I wouldn't be sad if she got cut
I'm not saying she will
Green = safe
Red = I want a rework
Yellow = Possibly cut
Black = I wouldn't be sad to see them go
Purple = The one true God

I hate that Corrin got in period but hey that's marketing
Well, back then Smash didn't have 3rd parties in it so it's my longshot hope nowadays

I feel like if they're still working with Bamco then Digimon representation is a thing that could happen
Isaac/Ray MkII/Agumon
There are only three characters that I'd say I really want added
They were clearly saving them for whatever this is
Night saki
If they aren't then that trailer was super weird
Is he still?
I'd say cut Mewtwo tbh
Not quite the worst but still pretty bad
Really bad
I like him but he sucks
Charizard can sadly go
Or give Jiggs a new moveset
They need to cut some Pokemon though
Unless they don't add a new FE character
Corrin should be cut tbh
Roy's cool but he's only DLC because Melee fans
I like playing hot potato with the tree
Villager's fun
It's just annoying that Cloud is the only third party character that doesn't have much history with Nintendo systems.  Even Pacman has it and I was super annoyed when he got announced
Capcom getting two characters was a little surprising
The one Bamco character?
I kind of want Cloud to get cut just cause he has almost zero history on Nintendo systems
Falcon has a smidge more speed but not enough to differentiate them
Not in my experience
He's Captain Falcon with a smidge more power
I hate clones
Like Ganon is cool right now in Smash buuuuuut
Looks terrible
Oh look it gets worse

If orochi 4 isn‚Äôt good I‚Äôm gonna be really sad
Cold steel 3 needs to get localized before I think about iv
I‚Äôm not gettin either so I‚Äôm technically not getting the ever version
No single player part of Pok√©mon has ever required ev/is bullshit
The games have been easy but this is just asking for abuse
Also those 2v1 battles are gonna make this way too easy
I‚Äôm talking about the motion control pokeballs
Where they say the mainline game is coming second half of 2019
Their Twitter
According to Pok√©mon company
This ones not mainline
This one looks okay but they‚Äôre ruining it with the Go mechanics/connectivity
SuMo were mediocre
It's a freemium RPG? for the Switch
Pokemon Quest
You just now saw Quest?
Oh
Let‚Äôs be real.  The 2019 game is gonna do gangbusters because it‚Äôs the first mainline Pok√©mon for the Switch.  It‚Äôll be next to impossible to tell if this game has any affect on it
Kanto
Lando only confirmed I think
I just don‚Äôt see this bridge thing being that big of a factor.  Like this will sell well but I don‚Äôt see it being a huge success compared to other Pok√©mon games.  Which tbf it‚Äôs being advertised as a spin-off
The agebase of everyone?
Looks like it
I don‚Äôt see a lot of casuals getting a Switch for this
Man, these gun girls are pretty cute
I play Hearthstone but I don't have in interest in hsreplay right now
*Finger Guns*
But why
It's basically just Super Robot Wars with girls instead of mechs right?
Shame they never made a sequel
Man, I've been wanting to import that game for forever
But Bandai published V
From owns it
Stay tuned to find out
Will Sakurai kill all of the Smash Bois hopes and dreams?
Nintendo could go massively in either direction
Sony always COULD do something cool but I doubt they will
Squeenix will at least have some small amount of KH news
The real question is who will do the worst?  EA? Ubisoft? Bethesda? Microsoft?
If Devolver can match their shitpost from last year at least I'll have that to look forward to
Ah, Shirabe.exe is the one corrupting the game
lol that's funny
Would recommend
Great game though
Other than Ka Dingel there's not a lot of direct references but it's very easy to tell from the storytelling and characters that there's some definite overlap between the teams behind them
<@!263983345669505025> Wild Arms 1 completed
Perfect
LMAO
They want to trick people into thinking it's Symphogear obviously
Shirabe is correct
I doubt that
Everything else should be left up to the market
They're still going to remove obvious trolls and illegal stuff
Unpopular opinion but I am all for Steam's new stance
Yeah, it really is

Jack must be protec
üê≥
Those are both cute so I approve
Someone who is named Okita Alter
üî´
*looks at XDU* yeah it is
I guess the game just didn't think either me or him loved Aoi Yuuki enough
My friend spent like twice that rolling for Shuten Doji
It's all right
üî´
Wow
That's how much I spend not getting Okita on NA
*Yells at phone* INSALL JP FGO WIT EVERY 5* UNIT
Yay for you
At least we'll always have Okita Alter fanart to make us feel better
I hate the thong tbh
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
~~Berserker Jack exists~~
Okita anime when
But at least she's in an anime
Jack is a sidequest in Apocrypha
Okay but Okita though
10/10 would adopt and headpat
Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion („Ç≥„Éº„Éâ„ÇÆ„Ç¢„Çπ ÂèçÈÄÜ„ÅÆ„É´„É´„Éº„Ç∑„É• K≈çdo Giasu: Hangyaku no Rur≈´shu)
Code Symphogear: Hangyaku no Shirabe
Even Shirabe is done
There's an SRPG that's kind of tedious
The action ones are meh
Than a rhythm game
It's more of an idol sim
Pretty sure I have all of them except the zombie one and the VR one
Neptunia is nepnep yes
What sorecery did he do
The first PS3 one isn'ton Steam though
I thought that was the joke
Oh, I thought you were talking about the Gurenn Lagann pachinko for a sec
DitF fighting game from ArcSys <:Ver:336656981144109066>
So there's always worse options
I mean, it could've been a pachinko machine
lol
For Real?
So what was the annuncement?
ü§î
Saki the best
Based Saki pls
Also a good edit

SURPRISE MUTHAFUCKA
Ah yes, the ideal female form.  Perfection if you will
Okay, but silver hair on a short cutie = <:MikuLewd:336656493606862868> <:MikuLewd:336656493606862868> <:MikuLewd:336656493606862868> <:MikuLewd:336656493606862868> <:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
When was this?  Cause I watched a lot of the stuff people threw out around the time and I never saw anything racist
Who else did they disassociate with?  I only remember the thing with Jontron
R00d
I don't agree with that statement
Illegal immigrant isn't a race tho
Pretty sure he admitted he was wrong about the crime quote and the immigrant one I'm pretty sure was in reference to illegal immigrants
Should see someone about that cough
Cause I like the 2DS in theory but I hate the design on the original model
2DS or 2DSXL?
The 3DS is a fantastic system
Terrible name tbh
I've had my 3DS since launch and it's my only one so I don't want to chance anything until I get a second one
I should do that if I ever get a second 3DS
To think the series all came about because Takaki saw the 3DS and said "I want to see tiddies on that"
The 2D ones are 3DS
Fair enough Saki
Well, "first" one
I'd say so although the first one never got a physical release in America
Streets of Rage style
Yeah
Nah, they're 2D beat em ups
tbh I enjoy the 2.5D SK games better than the 3D ones
I get that it's a remake but they're still selling back more than half the roster as DLC
I really hope 7EVEN blows me away then cause Burst Renewal is leaving a bad taste in my mouth
I know
Estival Versus doesn't really have a conclusion
Isn't Burst Renewal 7EVEN?
EV hits that point where there's too many enemies on screen and the story takes a bit of a nosedive
It is but I feel like SK peaked at Shinovi Versus
Eyy, platinum
Play Valkyria Chronicles 2.  Great game
Sleep well
It's just hard to go back to that layout after playing Fallout 3 and New Vegas so much
Could never get into them
I've tried playing Falout 1 and 2
I played the shit out of Rogue Legacy
Roguelikes are fun
See, I'd want a dancepad for that one
<:HibikiHi:336657249827028993>
I love rhythm games and am also pretty bad at them
VR just doesn't appeal to me
Same
Overdrive her then
Fubuki is adorable and great
Hey now
There's that too
idk I haven't played any yet.  I just know it's notable enough that they poke fun at it with Falcom in the Neptunia games
Okay, what's up with all the amnosia in Falcom games
I've been thinking of picking up Steins;Gate on Steam during the sale.  Should I go ahead and bite or should I wait and see if Steins;Gate Elite is worth it?
lol
Well, 1 was a PSP game with a very limited scope.  2 is  abig improvement
God Eater's decent enough. Nothing mind blowing but it's a fun series
l
o
l
Reminds me of PSO
Adult Poppy is very lewdable
Man, I really want to replay it but 75 bucks is too much and I'm skeptical that my laptop could handle emulating it well
Yeah, and it had a lot of hypothetical storylines
I used to have this and it's on my list of games to rebuy but ouchie ouch that price
Why is this game 75 dollars?
*looks up Gundam vs Zeta Gundam on Amzaon*
It has like a 45 on Metacritic last I looked.  It's like a 5/10 IMO but I'm a sucker for Gundam
As bad as it is I actually like Crossfire
Like what happened with Crossfire
Yeah
*Looks at Crossfire on my shelf*
And if it flops Bandai will absolutley get the wrong message/use it as an excuse to not try with other Gundam games
It's a shame too cause this is the first Breaker game released in NA
Although they did promise that every gunpla from previous entries will make it in eventually
Which explains why the Gundam roster is much smaller than Gundam Breaker 3
I've been told Bandai ditched the dev who did the first three Gundam Breakers and used an in house team for this one then rushed the development for some reason
At least the game looks pretty
Like, the anime girls are cute but you do the same gunpla missions on each "route" and none of the dialogue choices do anything besides give you some funny dialogue at times
They also added some very, very barebones dating sim aspects to this entry
There's also some decently sized gameplay issues
Yeah
This isn't framerate this is actual freezing
More like the game will hang up for several seconds at a time if it needs to load too much
lol
BUt then there's huge things to not like
There's small things I like about it
New Gundam Breaker is mildly infuriating
tbf the game I'm playing now is pretty bad
<:CarolShock:430939013235474432>
I'll get there one day
Ys is on the list
<:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
Saki stronk
IT'S AIRGETLAHM DATTO
Instead
I like that the super special legendary sword isn't Excalibur
Started playing Wild Arms 2 the other day
That Jump game is hype because it has Busou Renkin in it
It's still developed by SNK
NISA is just the publisher
I probably would've gone for at least one the preorders if I hadn't spent a bunch of money moving recently
So I'll get a couple of nice things
I have almost 7k gold
Lots of great memeterial
This expansion looks like a lot of fun
It was in development long before G came out
It's an SRPG
Stuff like Infinite Stratos and Familiar of Zero
But with a bunch of anime with loads of female main characters
Similar to Super Robot Wars
It's a big crossover RPG
Tsubasa is also in it
Since I can't buy it
I plan on torenting it if possible
I would sell my soul and Buy Tag Battle if Symphogear got in
I would buy Tekken if she did
lol
That Zerek part killed me
Winter usually gets overwritten in favor of Christmas yeah
Not sure if sarcasm or just a joke

Boos during the event/match = fine
Boos following the player around everywhere they go = not fine
Harassing is not fine
Booing is fine
Chrom is a Roy echo
I'm glad it's getting some love and stocks
I always liked Stamina mode

HoF boar?
I have all the pieces for at least one of the variants
Mechathun is my next craft
I already crafted stuff
this broken interactions are weird
Man
Aggro wil always be good
Mecha C'thun maybe
Academic Espionage Elekk deck
As long as prism hits C'thun it's gucci
We must all run Nozdormu
Trolden has shown me the way to counter the Test Subject combo
They check max mana istead of actual mana crystals
Yeah
I thought it was watching the rope burn for five minutes
Shame I only get to really enjoy it playing against Control decks
Academic Espionage is such a fun card
That's what it was
Rotface did it
Where did he come from
Arugal came from uh
Academic Espionage did work
He didn't see it coming
This poor guy

I forget which set it is
It is?
Or she cheapens floop for moonfire moonfire living roots
She either cheapens Maly for the swipe moonfire moonfire
This is what moonpetal florist is for
I mean, that's all of Hearthstone now
Reminds me of good old Ice Mage

Man this deck seems to only win against Mech Warrior

I love my shitty meme deck



Eliwood's game was the first one localized
Roy never got localized
No
FE6 has Roy
No FE7
I've had my 3ds since launch day and I've barely ever used the 3d
The 2ds xl is the model I'd advise getting unless you really want to use the limited 3d gimmick
2ds is just a model of 3ds
But the 3DS is slowing down and there'll probably be a successor announced by the end of next year
Awakening has loads of replay value
I wouldn't buy a 3DS at this point for just one game
This though
Awakening is a good game and a solid entry point if you're looking to get into the series
Someone need FE advice??
I see Fire Emblem
Hey
I forget
Wait maybe
No
I don't want to count Galvanizer
Same for Shaman
I don't know How Hunter/Warrior/Mage pull it off
Paly is incosistent but possible
Rogue can do it
I need the dust for C'Thun
I hadn't even considered a priest variant
Man
Just the new deathrattle card cause it discounts your deathrattles
nope
And then the 10 damage happens
So it pulls Cthun out of your hand
And then two of the one that does 5 damage to all your minions
Play the guy that summons a deathrattle from your hand
So you use the new guy that makes deathrattles cheap and kills them
Man, that was a next level combo I hadn't thought of
I just got got by a Mech C'Thun priest
Hoooooooly crap
Yes
I never want to replay it
But FE2 is bad
Yeah
Bad decisions.exe
Celica is ehhhhhhhhhhhhh
That title belong to Miccy
Eirika not even best female lord
She a good girl and a cutie
You talking about L'Arachel
Very easy but still a fun romp
Sacred Stones is solid
They would have been better served not having them at all
I won't spoil the main story but I will say the way kids are shoehorned in to Fates is abyssmal
Way better
Overall it's not the worst game in the series but I don't have many positive things to say about it
If you only get one then go Birthright if you care more about story.  Go Conqeust if you care more about gameplay
It has a lot of problems
I have played it three times
That's pretty powerful
I really enjoyed the first one
And it's super cheap now
It's decent
3DS gives you access to the entire DS librry as well so I'd say go for it
oof
heck emuparadise wasn't even my first choice
emuparadise is hardly the only site for ROMs
Since 3DS emulation is still working out its kinks
So I'd say go for it
You have a very large library to choose from
I mean
Our boy is banking on the hope they keep doing remakes
