why is that?
time is fake
>she's threatening to kill herself
mmm love me some emotional blackmail in the morning
Its hard but totally worth it

But honestly, wish we could brain mash instead of having misunderstandings, but we cant so we just gotta keep on trying
Its always time to kill the moon
Dont give up
>Words suck why cant we just mash brains together to understand eachother

Its the curse of balal

Avoiding women sure is a way to protect a marriage 🤔
if he cares, just saying he cares isnt enough. he should act like it too.
He should put his money where his mouth is then, if this is how that saying goes lmao
At some point its just wasting too much energy on someone who doesn't give a shit about you (no idea if this is the case obviously), and then its like ???

hmm i dunno i was crazy about their relationship since the beginnig, but finding out the truth definitely has a kick lol
cocona in ep 4 going "i wish to meet my family" dsjkfshdganvuyW *KILLS SELF*
well, episode 6 already touches the heavier plot stuff without telling you about it
hmm
loved it from the very beginning, but i think every episode has its strengths, like 2 with the whole sexual awakening, and 3 with the fist of the north star mad max theme, but 4 is where it really hit me, with papika and cocona on the island 😩 🙏
it  has been done before, so go for it
i do wear geeky shirts and god i wish i had some flip flappers ones

bless papi
nice 👏 👏
all i know is that the upcoming season is gonna be an adaptation of a part in a manga thta had a game like 15 years ago that i played with my friends and we never knew whats going on, so now it is time.

but i think it's worth the shot
the movie is just So Muuch lol
and character interaction
i'm no tank fanatic (at least wasnt into tanks before gup), but enjoyed the show for its battles and characters
lmao
GuP was fun lol
i mean, its just that lol
well i also read them as gay for each other, even tho it took cocona time lol
love the rewatch value of flip flappers lol
