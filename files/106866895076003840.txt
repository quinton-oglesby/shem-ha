<:MikuPraise:585839808765493249> happy birthday to our picture keeper staff member <@!263983345669505025> ! <:MikuPraise:585839808765493249>
<:MikuPraise:585839808765493249> happy birthday to our lovely admin <@!99695384296701952> ! <:MikuPraise:585839808765493249>
hello! I hope to serve you all well! I'll be around at mostly odd hours of the day to help keep things cozy for everyone
As a reminder, if you get a DM from someone you don't know, don't ever click any link they send you! Even if it looks like Discord staff. If they have a fun new game to show you, or they want you to test something, or give you some ~special~ moderation/developer insights, don't do it! Don't click things! 
The latest scam is catching out a lot of extra people this time by being crafty with embeds and impersonation. Please keep your account safe, and don't ever click links.

It's the ten year anniversary since the airing of Senki Zesshou Symphogear, episode 1! To celebrate this monumental occasion, we would like to encourage you all to rewatch through Symphogear with us! Beginning from today, we'll be opening up <#928339153488326686> to talk about Symphogear weekly, focusing on three episodes at a time. You can watch at your own pace, while we talk about what we love and hate about Symphogear in smaller chunks. Be sure to check out the event counter in the top left for alerts for when the next batch of episodes are open for discussion! Please be polite and spoiler your messages if you talk about future episodes inside of <#928339153488326686> and use <#336310266654490624> if you want to speak at length about episodes that aren't in focus.

Alongside that, <@!87512939107450880> is graciously hosting a watchalong if you want to watch with a few others at the same time. Message him if you'd like to be put on a whitelist and for further details on how to join. Be sure to get the `Anniversary Rewatch` role over at <#448237561085952001>s for alerts when the stream starts!
we have a new channel! <:ElfneinPresents:691733046633955439> <#803824240494903338> this channel is for casual discussion of live action shows or movies, like <#371105434771390465> is for animation, and accordingly <#371105434771390465> and <#337805317276565525> have had their descriptions updated to be more clear about what you can discuss within them. please continue to use <#377148557796442134> for heavy discussion of plot points or endings of any other media as before
Elfnein is now fully settled into her position, and accordingly <#448237561085952001> has been upgraded! be sure to look it over, for we also ~~finally~~ have new colors for the XV characters. if you had Prelati's color previously, be aware that it has been changed to fit space in for the new colors
<:HibikiHi:336657249827028993>
no lynch
YEA
I can believe it
no clues would mean a lynch would just be a senseless death
<:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
we definitely can't no lynch again
which is what makes it tricky
wanting to eliminate the rival duelist
my suspicion is cast towards Yami
<:CarolYandere:424047704826707980>
<:CarolShock:430939013235474432>
<:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
I'll change to Homura
Yami Yugi
yea
<:HibikiHi:336657249827028993>
<:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
Rakhi
yea
I'm ready too
I don't believe that either
and was even slower
Rakhi also didn't vote for her
I don't believe I ever defended Homura
if the will is true, and scrmz is a doctor, then that leaves Rakhi?
so there's 5 of us then, with one less mafia?
it would seem so
big plays!
no lynch
yea
I would say it would be someone from the last games with a motive, but there's also new faces
the needles shoved everyone on his flesh? <:HibikiShock:336656371611074580>
is it possible to kill yourself?
they could be a vigilante, technically, right?
can the doctor protect people and be killed the same night?
*gasp*
mafia targeting Latooni would make sense at least
me, Miku, and Iori, right?
Shirou
yea
<:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
is he who you inspected?
Miku
yea
it's really hard to keep track of everything <:ElfneinBullying:421432763078410241>
so one of you two are lying
but if there were two mafia, then it would be over now
is it possible for mafia to also have other roles?

Tsubasa might be easier to have them lynch
I'm fine with that then
because they're both the ones leading
either tsubasa or Latooni
I'm thinking Tsubasa
yes
<:CarolYandere:424047704826707980>
he never believed me <:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
I'd be down for that too
hollo
amazing
<:HibikiPadoru:516438720082346004>
thanks <:BikkiOhNo:586337444597596202>
uploading the smol one makes it a little blurry on my display as an actual emoji
could you upload the bigger picture though?
that sounds fine <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
is this a good emoji?


<:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
I want to make one, I'm just having difficulties thinking of a good one
<:MikuPraise:585839808765493249>
so long as that's okay with the staff of course
if anyone has ideas for custom emojis by the way, I'd be open to try making a couple
I liked this one, so I wanted to help and cut it out


that's super cute!
we change it often for events and birthdays and the such; it's hibimiku at the moment since it's the XV promo art, and the XV spoiler restriction just lifted
so then we would still have the gap for people to have to catch up on their own regardless
I considered if we should have a concurrent rewatch channel for it too, like when we had the server-ran one, but the YT uploads only go to GX
yeah, and we apparently don't actually have any Serena emotes
do yall think these would make good emojis?



there's some pretty outdated stuff
that's a good idea, we need to update the rules in general actually
and we do always have <#336297387863703552> for those few who do want to chat in a spoiler-free zone
yeah, tbh, I don't think I've seen anybody join and mention that they've started watching Symphogear through the YT uploads
thanks for that!
it has been replaced <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
~~which might just be the two that I added tonight~~
we're out of slots now though, so we'll have to vote some off the server for more <:MikuDelete:661660028410920990>
scrolling back through, I saw Artistic Yui's really nice suggestion too, and did a little bit of magic to it to fix it up for emoji size
it has been replaced <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
oh, yeah that looks really good!
but, we're pretty low on emote slots, so it might not stay forever since we already have a couple other faces like it
I like that a lot!
maybe?
yes/no?
I'm gonna try to crop and make these work, they're good faces
twenty Hibiki emojis <:MikuGay:336656810788388864>
it is a pretty good face
o-one more bikki emote can't hurt
it is, but I'd prefer to not just rip another server's emotes, it's kind of rude and feels like wasting our slots
is that from another Symphogear server, or a personal one?
hmmm
she cute
yeah we can have one more
we kind of have a lot of Hibiki already but...
so fast!
<:MikuFear:642799630605615114>
I'll do it <:HibikiHi:336657249827028993>
I'm leaning towards 2 myself
1 or 2?
<:ChrisBored2:672575548156936212><:ChrisBored:672575526346424351>
<:KirikaSalute:620069889838809089>
as soon as I finish eating I'll go through and add the good ones <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
I don't mind doing it myself, it's really just the anime pictures that take a little bit of time to cut out to a transparent background
it'll probably take a little while to go through it all and see what looks best in smol size
I see quite a few I like! <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
ooh, that's really good!
also true
that ones a little too hard to see in emoji size
I'm already cleaning it <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
that's what discord says at least
<:MikuCute:672908542763859968><:MikuWorry:672908523495227432><:SerenaSmile:672908572774105109>
now there's 5
there was 8 slots
better <:ElsaGrowl:672841416229126164>
<:ElsaGrowl:672841416229126164>
we'll keep for now at least <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
it's a little bit hard to see her face
<:ElsaGrowl:672840641214021644>
1 or 2?
<:LeiurJudge:674522639347351552><:LeiurFlashy:674522617989955595>
fixed <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
<:MillaarcV:673239269036392526>
gosh that's cute
yeah, the XDU twitter also posts those weirdly translated character bios and other fluff
we'll work something out <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
I know it's possible, but I have no idea how to do any of that <:MikuWorry:672908523495227432>
I was going to repost the tweets for actual new units and content into <#680064219449917497> but if people want like, every bit of news and banners, then I can try my best to repost those there quickly
yep, and tbh I've also been unsure if people actually want *every* little post they make
thank you rady!
fixed <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
<:ElfneinTrip:688025973932687377><:MikuDelete:661660028410920990>
we do need to, it's something we're thinking about
thanks for the fix, Whiskey <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
<:AdamScream:688241618356404224>
that's a lot of emojis, Kerrik <:MikuFear:642799630605615114>
also, Melua might get upset at me <:NotLikeFist:689188869974786133>
we can add it if you want to clean it <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
closest is <:TsubasaPeek:623246193002151938>
hmmmm
*anticipation building*
<:HibikiEager:407398049531559937>
I really like <:NotLikeFist:689188869974786133> but it's super similar to <:HibikiScared:688429720152703033> so one of them will have to be <:MikuDelete:661660028410920990>  once we start running low again
nonono
hmmm
<:ElsaChef:689035502673985622>
<:ElfneinPresents:688429721998065680> about 3 pixels
I could take the body off, yeah
oh, hm
the hat helps make it unique <:ElsaChef:689030206144381009>
<:GermainAngry:689199446327820341>
taking away all her hair looks so strange
hmmmm
Germain's hair is so big <:NotLikeFist:689188869974786133>
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689198580103118858><:GermainAngry:689198580397113346>
*cleaning in progress*
is good
<:TsubasaDere:689195981841236109>
it's a really good face
1 or 2?
<:ElsaWhat:689195325621141505> <:ElsaWhatWide:689195345749606527>
yeah but
that Elsa might be too wiide
okay yeah, Discord was just being weird, it works now
it's small enough
wait, why does it not work originally...?
oh, I can just yank that emoji resized version then
<:ShirabeDone:688198954810474559> I don't know a good way to downsize gifs and the Hibiki bean is too big
sure, we can have both of those
~~we'll just prune them later~~
<:HibikiMunch:672606446239744000><:HibikiMonch:688190074646691843><:HibikiEat:689192541404528664>
Germain is also very teeny tiny, but, we can at least have her for now
<:GermainPeace:689397094666076171>
<:ElfneinSinging:689395797099413512><:MikuDelete:661660028410920990>
yay or nay?
<:ElfneinSinging:689395797099413512>
but I'm not really sure if I can get a good crop of Elfnein's singing
these are really good
<:VanessaSmug:689395769199165447><:ElsaSick:689395768754569359><:MillaarcDone:689395768980668416>
very good, thank you! <:MikuPraise:585839808765493249>
<:GermainShock:689207474028281907>
<:GermainShock:689207247901163526>
true actually, I'll trim those out later
is okay maybe
<:GermainShock:689203407965388847>
after this Germain emoji though I have plans, so this will be the last one I'll add, for now
I'll try it though
sideways faces don't come out great as emojis usually
bodyless
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
not really sure which I prefer, we can just leave it as current unless other people think the other versions are better
<:GermainAngry:689199996653928451>
<:TriplePeek:689568598938615939>
<:ChrisPresents:672578363176517642> new replacement
<:GenjuroLaugh:689563633516150872>
in the meantime
this is getting so hard to decide with all these similar faces <:NotLikeFist:689188869974786133>
hmmmm
~~we have so many crying gears~~
fair, we don't have a crying Shirabe actually, I thought we ddi
I mean, we still have slots I guess so we could add them if yall really want them, but we're creeping closer to the purge <:MikuDelete:661660028410920990>
KirikaWink is good, but the Shirabes feel really similar to her other faces
the resolution for KirikaGlint is too smol
I'll clean the other Tsubasa later tonight too, that one's pretty good
<:TsubasaNote:689554460044820608>
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
<:ShirabeEmbarassed:336657288477671436>
<:TsubasaPeek:623246193002151938> do yall think this is a good shrug emoji?
<:TsubasaAngry:692141154531016765>
I'll look over the channel again later tonight or tomorrow morning, I just had a quick moment free <:MikuWorry:672908523495227432>
we still have 4 more slots, the purge is almost upon them <:PadoruCarol:688181431393845294> <:MikuDelete:661660028410920990>
I added the 100ms one, thank you Whiskey <:MikuPraise:585839808765493249>
they're in for real now
oh, sorry! I thought we already added those bears!
thanks for the suggestion!
<:ChrisBang:702166093065748500>
thanks for the flag, Yui! <:TomosatoSalute:688199574749446203>
also renaming :ShemmySmile: to match
<:ShemHaWhat:727010581722431499>
:ShemHaWhat: it is then!
is this good emoji material?
if other people want it though then I can cut it out and make it one later
I think it's a silly face but I'm not really sure if it's great emote
<:ShemHaTilt:729980149529051156>
so we'll keep it as a trial run for now!
I like the head tilt one, but I'm unsure really how great of an emote it is
yeah, it's the same nadeko bot, `9_8ball` works
suggesting fun stuff for it though, like names, face, or chat commands to have, would be super appreciated
if you want to collab on it then that's something to take up with Kerrik, but I think he's really excited to make something of his own creation
but, the thing is is that Saki wasn't a member of staff either and we didn't fully know her when she was given duties to manage the bots, and although I don't think anyone else here right now would go on to do bad things, we want to be extra safe and keep things close to us
I really super appreciate yall doing that, especially Gwen if you were already making something in case this happened
I want to address too here since there's a lot of people talking about making bots
a `jii_skip` note has been added to the art channels' descriptions, and it'll also be in the updated rules when we get to that
thanks for cropping and cutting out a slightly zoomed out version, I edited it a little bit to remove the hat
should we have the `gun!` bot command? react Chris for yes, Hibiki for no
thank you!
<:KirikaBean:731532693170290709>
<:ShiraBean:736607747834904667>
oh, I didn't realize our current bean was even smoller
its res is pretty low, would you happen to have a bigger version?
inline <:SerenaDizzy:736605371912945736>
<:SerenaDizzy:736605371912945736>
better/worse?
obviously to fix this imbalance we need a hibimiku duo emoji <:HibikiEager:407398049531559937>

nitro people have been posting it though
we ended up not adding the quad one since it takes up so much space
Bike is barely used so I wouldn't be opposed to cutting it, it just feels special so I kind of like it
if yall want to keep it then we can
I don't super like the elfnein smug just because it's really hard to see for me, it's so bright and the lines are so thin
<:KirikaChant:663568587310628892> <:Euphoria:688429724032172116> <:BikkiFu:688190074738704394> <:ElfneinSmug:688236836891656246> (and possibly some of the other smugs) <:TriplePeek:689568598938615939> are some of the ones I would start with removing
~~that is a favorite of mine~~
<:MikuFear:642799630605615114>
we have a tooons of similar faces, I'd really like to not cut emotes that are actually unique
yeah yall, I feel like you're jumping to the wrong emotes to want to cut first
it's really unique at least
I personally am not all that for jumping to delete the song stone first
those two, along with all the Bikki eating ones, were added while warning they were going to be first to go
<:HibikiScared:688429720152703033> is on the chopping block
I'd be apprehensive to remove <:MikuHype:688429715676987428> because I had to redraw her hair so it'd feel like wasted effort <:HibikiWhoops:585839808115507222>
it is basically the same
<:KirikaBean:731532693170290709>  is here because of <:ShiraBean:736607747834904667> I think
the bears are fine, we have over 200 animated slots
I'd rather remove the coins instead of song gems if we remove a currency emoji
I love <:ElfneinTrip:688025973932687377>
no way!!
I like <:VanessaSmug:689395769199165447>
I like <:MikuSigh:688429722799308883> because it's supposed to be a more usable unique one, but nobody ever uses it <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
<:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
awwww I like that one too
but, moving it to animated would save it <:HibikiThink:688429715362414641>
shafting it implies total deletion
I think you mean shift
we make the rules <:MikuDelete:661660028410920990>
cutting some of the bikki eating ones would probably be the next ones I'd like to remove when it comes time
I said earlier, I'd rather remove the kiricoin instead of the song gem, but yeah, we have a fair bunch of slots now so it's pretty low priority
it's true!
noooo I love those miku emojis <:MikuPanic:640289659452129310>
<:HibikiAAA:620079684109205534> <:HibikiScreech:633468460030230548>
I never noticed before how blurry <:HibikiWow:614268629952757760> is
she's really cute okay <:NotLikeFist:689188869974786133>
yeah, those are basically the same face
I love <:HibikiEager:407398049531559937> !!
if we removed any at all, yeah, the bully one probably would be removed
but those regulars use like, all of her emojis, and she doesn't have many, so I don't want to remove any
Maria emotes just aren't used a lot because we only have a couple regulars who super like Maria
but, I like having unique emojis, so it's pretty low priority
padoru could be removed and just kept as an animated thing
I would like to keep <:HibikiMonch:688190074646691843> the most actually, only because Kirika has <:KirikaMunch:672599382670966785>  that is a similar feel to the other bikkis
on the other other other hand, we already have about 10 slots freed up with other options for removal
only adding it for christmas wouldn't make much sense though because we would always have to get rid of an emote at that time then
Yui made that for us though <:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
yeah, same thing, she has super few emotes so there's a loooot that would get removed before any of those
like I said, she has very few, so she's in protected status
touching Kanade emotes would be suuuper low priority
these are the main ones for me
<:KanadeBlush:672455329451343882><:KanadeBleh:672455306059579392><:KanadeSmug:688191203178840064>
it's hard for me to understand what emotions they really are, but she doesn't have many emotes and people use them at least a fair bit, so I don't really want to remove them
a couple of the Kanade ones I'm pretty on the fence about
<:ShirabeStare:582381430915596289>
I don't think we've ever done anything for apirl fools actually <:HibikiThink:688429715362414641>
that's so meeean <:ElfneinTrip:688025973932687377>
I love that emote <:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
it would be a funny joke for like, a day!
noooo <:ElfneinTrip:688025973932687377>
yeah, if it can be fixed we can keep it
since <:HibikiWow:614268629952757760> is so blurry, I'd probably remove it in favor of <:HibikiAwe:688397678572339230> and rename the awe to wow
it's *super* angry
I like <:HibikiAngry:688429716096548892>
I'd be fine with removing <:HibikiAAA:620079684109205534>
most of these other emojis are more of like, if we really really need to
I think we've went through most of the stuff that's actually definitely going to be removed, and that gives us plenty of slots to work with
low priority removal though since she doesn't have much
<:ElsaGrowl:672841416229126164> could maybe be removed, I think that was the first Elsa emoji we added just to give her one
<:BikkiFu:688190074738704394> is definitely one I'd agree to remove, I don't think I've ever seen anyone use it and I forgot it even existed before today
hyper veto!!
I'll fix it sometime then
<:ShirabeEmbarassed:336657288477671436> <:MikuPanic:640289659452129310> <:MikuFear:642799630605615114> <:MikuGay:336656810788388864> are what I usually use when I'm embarrassed
I want to remake <:ChrisEmbarrassed:663558614610608128> someday if we keep it honestly, I didn't realize how super saturated it is for some reason
those are probably the ones I would maybe agree to remove
<:ChrisEmbarrassed:663558614610608128> <:ChrisCharge:586320496346529792>
Chris is dangerous to touch because so many people love her and her emojis <:TsubasaPeek:623246193002151938>
<:ShirabePout:336656831978012712> is a classic one that used to get used a lot, it's just been powercreeped a bit
the drool, yeah, that's one I think could possibly be removed because it's hard to see
even though there's a the big dmjii takeover, I really like Shirabe's emotes too
but I guess it's not used very often <:MikuWorry:672908523495227432>
I like <:HibikiBlep:605209109284782090>
in a couple hours I'll probably remove the extra Hibiki eating emojis and put those in
<:ElfneinTrip:688025973932687377>
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594> that is really good too!
I'm eyeing up that HibikiSad, but, I feel we might have too many sad emojis
MikuPeeku is on another server
it's cute but maybe too hard to see her arm
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
just got to delete that bit of pink real quick...
that works
I don't know what to name it <:MikuWorry:672908523495227432>
<:MikuHype:688429715676987428>
<@!99695384296701952> can we have that!?
I like that!
!!
I like it, we only have <:HibikiHi:336657249827028993> as a similar one, and we did make space today
it feels pretty bad seeing my art doing that
but also, ugh, I really didn't think yall would constantly use the kiss emojis for cursed stuff <:NotLikeFist:689188869974786133>
you can now <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
looking through the list, that one and one other emoji are the only ones not consistent, which we can totally fix, it was probably just a mistake
generally that's what we do, everything is grouped like that except for a couple intentional exceptions
give me a couple hours to properly think, I'm mildly busy atm <:TsubasaPeek:623246193002151938>
vent channel is not happening, we are too large, your examples are 1/4 the size of our server and assumingly has an even more tight-knit community feel
I'm sorry, I'm not really sure yall are getting what I'm saying either
that's going to do nothing but be a bunch of people spreading negativity, and putting far too much of themselves up in a public space imo
vents in a public anime server with over 2k people are not about supporting one another
discussions are good, and that's healthy, usually about public happenings but sometimes about more personal things, and that's fine to happen so we can support each other
the point is that we don't want to encourage venting
that sounds awful
I would not want to host peoples intimate thoughts just so they want a place to vent with no response
if you think what Aria did earlier is that awful, it really only encourages that a vent channel where that constantly happens is going to breed tons more negativity
I also don't think the rare vent in <#336297840529899522> is enough to have to move people into another entire channel
I don't think our feelings have changed since last time
thank you for appreciation <:ElfneinTrip:688025973932687377>
<:MikuGay:336656810788388864>
I don't understand why you're being so stubborn about finding ways to not talk about it
I'm saying please, talk to each other
yall, it's not about the specific type of implementation of backend whatever
we're a chatroom, yall talked to her, and it works out
we are not going to ratify a bot or warning system or whatever for that in <#336297840529899522> because, that sounds incredibly impersonal and awful
if yall feel Aria was too heated and I should have stepped in, then I'll keep that in mind, and next time I'll do my best to softly nudge people better
no, that's not what I'm saying at all
I'm not sure what you're meaning, Kaiyo
maybe I could have stepped in and asked Aria to calm down, but often times that can escalate things more when I'm not involved in a conversation, and yall were talking to each other to presumably support one another
I do not like swinging authority over people, I like letting people talk things through to each other
the channel yall are suggesting would make it so that would not ever happen
I was watching the discussion and personally, I think Aria got a bit heated, but I also saw several people wanting to talk to her and talk her down, and it seemed to be resolved naturally
do yall feel like we should have prevented Aria from talking in <#336297840529899522> ?
why don't we talk through what prompted yall to suggest this?
:15min: is on all the other Symphogear servers, and I just haven't found a good Akira for us <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
but it's very very cute
we've lost the :Bike: and :HibikiFu:
<:ShirabeHeart:738932033635483738><:KirikaHeart:738932018116821034>
wao that's really cute
but, we still have plenty to remove from that earlier discussion

I prefer having them sorted as they currently are personally
we could have the duo emojis have better paired names, I guess that's up to yall for which is more convenient
added KirikaWham
that's actually kind of wild that it was stuck like that, thanks for letting us know
click the reaction for which one you think should stay
~~should have said this earlier too...~~
<:HibikiAAA:620079684109205534> <:HibikiScreech:633468460030230548>
so, quick poll! which of these two should be cut? click the reaction for which you think should stay
also I really like the Phara too, so I guess I have to sacrifice another Bikki duplicate...
:KirikiaWhatRun: has been added, thanks Phanta!
it was very close for a while, but apparently yall much prefer <:HibikiScreech:633468460030230548> , so she gets to stay <:ElfneinPresents:691733046633955439>
eventually we'll make <#448237561085952001> prettier and use reaction emojis for picking stuff out, still kind of thinking about that though, for which roles we want to keep around and under that system
yeah, that's just a very old unused role now that some people have kept tagged onto themselves for fun
added, thanks Phanta!
they're added now, thanks Phanta
I think I like <:MikuWhoa:670502684692054042> more
I don't think it's a serious suggestion <:MikuWorry:672908523495227432>
~~I do wish yall would visit the other channels a little more often though~~
too late ~~I like twirl better too~~
I'll change it to twirl though
you named it spin <:TsubasaAngry:692141154531016765>
added the two pets and the Kirika animated emojis, thanks yall
<:HibikiThink:688429715362414641> yeah, we can do that, we did that grouping for the padorus so there's some precedence for it
added all the pets, thanks Phanta
goodness, so many! lol
~~Melua was the one who added this Carol one though btw~~
<:TsubasaPeek:623246193002151938>
thanks for all the pets, Phanta!
they are now, it just took a bit for me to rename them all
since they're like a whole series now though, I guess it would be more convenient to have their own grouping
I changed them so they'd be grouped like the rest
:KirikaAniMunch: is probably a more noticeable name though
discord pls...
<:HibikiWhat:336656482907193344> we already had that as :KirikaEat :
color me never really has been ordered in any particular way
right, they're still the same
I'll think about fitting them into the rainbow
now, autoscores, I did actually kind of forget...
too nice <:MikuGay:336656810788388864>
did we? <:HibikiOhNo:586337444597596202>
`soon`
there's almost certainly going to be more roles available at least for `color me`, and we still need to host Elfnein on a real server
rady, I told you before that it's possible, we just haven't decided on how we want to layout roles again because we're bad at doing things in a timely manner
`eat is gone`
<:MikuDelete:661660028410920990>
are they?
I'll purge the Eat one
nono, it's no biggie
credit to my SO for noticing this and putting my pfp on the toaster
yeah sure <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
yeah, we have level 3 again, it's just the emotes didn't get re-enabled for some reason
yeah, we can
ohh
<:MikuFear:642799630605615114>
what kind of event roles?
their priority is below Carol too so people can have the full set if you're into that
autoscorer colors have been added <:LeiurFlashy:674522617989955595>
added an extra sentence, thanks for pointing that out rady
~~lol~~
not sure how many contentious characters we really want to have as colors either <:HibikiThink:688429715362414641>
I don't want to mess with the ordering that was there before just because other people have juggled their roles already to have a certain color

the lady that gets stabbed by Millarc
the character is the one nicknamed donut-chan, Phanta
it's already very crowded
sorry, we don't have any plans to add a minor character as a color selection
oh, you were Purple Heart
I'm sorry, you didn't really say who your favorite character is that we're missing. who are you wanting us to add?
lol, thank you Phanta
lol
although honestly, I'm not 100% on more fish stuff, it seems very... contentious with people
which side is meant to be heads and tails?
they look very good!
lol
yeah, it's no trouble to ask
we probably will make that heads
yeah, I think that looks good!
react with <:KirikaFish:717138469381734471> for more fish, <:MariaNo:672658725986762764> for no fish
we can have a vote
they really do look very good <:HibikiThink:688429715362414641>
okay, that's what I thought this was. I'm very disappointed that yall are being so unwelcoming to rider fans here. there's really not been a problem with them sharing bits of passion and how it crosses over with symphogear here, they're using the channels appropriately, and they do converse about it frequently in <#377148557796442134>
I feel like it would take some very heavy convincing to get us to make a Kamen Rider channel, considering we also don't have things like a Fate channel, and <#377148557796442134> seems to fit just fine
<:TsubasaDere:768545990495961129>
I always saw <:TsubasaDere:689195981841236109> as a blushing face, but it seems a lot of you didn't, so i definitely agree, I'll swap it out for the blushier one
I'm considering adding disgust because it's a unique face, so I don't want to remove the more unique eating emoji for its place
and it's only more popular by about 50 uses, I don't think that's enough to sway
the pixel emojis of bridge bunnies don't get used much, but they're special
because we have <:KirikaMunch:672599382670966785>
that's pretty high on my list to remove, but if we removed one I think it would be <:HibikiMunch:672606446239744000>
I like using both of those emotes so much though <:MikuCry:688397678584791074>
I've added the animated one now though at least
but, I'm not sure what would get removed for them...
and the HibikiSick
I like these
:HibikiAniDisgust: is now the zoomier one
and tbh yeah, I have a pretty bad hangup in regards to crack pairings anyways. it's already a little distressing seeing people using the hibimiku kiss in strange ways, it'd be a lot more uncomfortable for me to make modular stuff for everyone kissing each other
sorry, that's very flattering that yall would consider me for that, but that's a lot of drawing! I don't know if I could really do that
<:TsubasaPeek:623246193002151938>
no worries
<@!681618785798455331> I went ahead and gave you the roles you wanted
yeah, it used to be like an actual club with group watches, suuuper long ago
then when we make #live-action-media, we'll also update the channel descriptions for <#337805317276565525> and <#371105434771390465> to include the remainders so it's more clear, the latter is really out of date anyways
I think the one weird part of this to me is that if we start separating out types of media like this, then does that mean we should have channels for VNs, manga, and western animated stuff? or are yall fine using what we already have for that?
to be extra clear about this channel too, since it's not going to be a KR channel, there's still going to be posting of memes or crossover discussion in other channels, like any other media. this channel would just be for casual discussion of any live action stuff, like how you'd use <#371105434771390465>. spoilery discussions, like the endings of movies, should still be contained within <#377148557796442134> if it's an extended discussion
yes, so, the issue that we've always pointed to when the suggestion comes up around Kamen Rider is that well, we're not a Kamen Rider server. it shouldn't have special treatment as a measure to keep discussion contained when, especially over the last couple recent months at least to my eyes it's been no more disruptive than anything else

instead, I want to ask if yall would like #live-action-media, so you can talk about movies and lots of other things too. this would still be moderated, so overriding someone's discussion with lots of KR would still not be very nice, but maybe it could help split channels up since it seem speople tend to ignore <#377148557796442134> a lot
ooo that looks good
I wouldn't want to encourage them going even more offtopic <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
it's more like, we definitely wouldn't want it to be going off in the xdu chats, or really any of the gaming ones since they're so busy, but the general chats are so wild in topics and stuff that it'd be fine
I'd want to see a proof of concept too, it could be fun to have something like that back, and probably also kept to just <#336297387863703552> and <#407060923078017026> so it doesn't clutter too much
there's a point that having a channel for it could encourage people to post it here more, but right now the only people I can think at the moment who post nsfw fancontent are Nuker, Fenny, and me, so making a channel for three people to share their works is also kind of iffy
and erp-like stuff is just something I wouldn't want us to have to moderate, and isn't something I feel people should be encouraged to do on a public discord like this
~~please don't post smut in <#336297840529899522> ~~
my worry about adding a nsfw discussion channel now would be, what all do we shove there? most nsfw discussion in <#336297808221044736> right now spawn off of people commenting on art posted there, which isn't something I really want to shove people away for because that's too blurry of a line
if I remember right, we used to have a nsfw discussion back in the ancient times, but it got renamed into <#336297840529899522> because people usually used it to talk about just serious adult things
yeah, that could still be fun though since it's some of the most active symphogear-related chats
if we go by usage, megane and skeptical should be cut
and Kirika does have several similar faces...
the dmjii hug is very cute, but a sacrifice must be made for it <:MikuDelete:661660028410920990>
hmmmmmm
this is also really good, but, <:KirikaActually:688433197402554423> does the actually emotion so good imo that I'm not sure I'd want to replace it
I like this one a lot, but another sacrifice would need to be made...
I'll wait to do anything with the emotes for until Melua is less busy
you can react to both, or rather, you don't really need to put your vote in for the other option if you don't want it
also to be clear actually on the emote culling, we'd move the loser to the emote server so it wouldn't be totally gone
react to this message with <:MikuJoy:738234684655403110>  to vote for renaming it to MikuLaugh or <:MikuHype:688429715676987428> to keep it same
sure, laugh does fit too
truuue
she supposed to be a super excite Miku
eehhh maybe if yall reeeeally want to rename <:MikuHype:688429715676987428> , but, I don't want it to be wheeze, I don't see how that fits
but, the special properties! glasses and gay!
my vote is skeptical, it's been here for a year and half and yet only has 392 uses, and over half of those seem to be people reacting to others using it
that uniqueness shouldn't be disregarded!
megane is Kirika with glasses
however!
still kind of undecided personally if I like it more than <:KirikaActually:688433197402554423>
I did this from Raiden's crop
hmmmmmm that's a very good idea actually, to move <:ShirabeJoy:672105345316814878><:KirikaJoy:672105345342111785> to the emote server
do yall think it would be better to have all that background stuff, or should it be focused on a cutout of Kirika?
this crop is really good!
yeah, I'd make it a command triggered off of `happy birthday!`
<@!99695384296701952> can we do that? <:ShirabePlease:724034356192215081>
I really like the idea of the happy birthday bot reaction though!
I like squee, but, if nobody knows what squee is *somehow* then I guess it's no good
I don't know how to change that <:HibikiWhoops:585839808115507222>
9_convertlist
got to have the right prefix <:ElfneinPresents:691733046633955439>
9_convert f c 100
lol, yeah
I'm not sure if there's a better crop possible without redrawing quite a bit
truuue
~~it's actually kind of mean...~~
I see the newer one as more of a laugh that really reminds me of the old Touhou easy modo meme if anyone remembers that
I didn't think the newer Micha emoji had that same smug energy, but now you mention it, it is kind of close <:HibikiThink:688429715362414641>
we could consider swapping them, but I also really like how <:ElfneinSmug:688236836891656246> and <:CarolSmug:617040484111745027> look close
yeah, it's just a little bit too samey to have both smugs
do yall think these are best, or are we passing up better ones?
with this cropped version of Carol so she's bigger in emote form



so, I think of all the new autoscorer and Carol faces, these three are my favorite <:ElfneinPresents:691733046633955439>
also just for clarity, if <:Zababies:672238628398956594> stays then we'll put the new hug on the emote server
should <:Zababies:672238628398956594> get moved to the emote server for the new hug? react with <:Zababies:672238628398956594> to keep zababies, <:ShirabeSleep:691497302535176302> to move it
so, vote time then!
ah, I forgot to decide on that <:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
I'll try to remember to look back over this after a nap <:ElfneinTrip:688025973932687377>
there's a couple there that I'd really like but need to redraw a bit because of the ! and other text
lol, it throws me off too!
last time <:KirikaSkeptical:586406806482583556> was voted to be cut, and I like the idea of moving <:ShirabeJoy:672105345316814878><:KirikaJoy:672105345342111785> to the emote server, so that's three spaces
oh that's a lot of nice faces
the big one was that you have to enable the automatic scanning of all media, which includes automatic deletion of stuff discord thinks is bad, which can have some real issues with us I think since we have <#336297808221044736> stuff
when that feature was first revealed, I think we looked over it and decided not to because it means you have to enable a lot more discord oversight on all of our content
I'll try to find a better rip of them, or if I can't then I'll just try to fix them when I remove text, but that'll have to take a bit
I like a few of these for sure, but, they're also very compressed from the stream and smol
I really really wish we had infinite emoji slots <:KirikaPanic:644235681677180958>
Matt, I absolutely love that you already fixed up that smug Chris
added, thank you!
we have so many free animated slots
added <:ElfneinPresents:691733046633955439>
<:TsubasaNote:689554460044820608> thanks very much
also, if anyone knows if there's translations for the stickers, that'd also be neat to know, and I can edit the words
they can be animated too apparently, for anyone to use, but it has to be an APNG
I've uploaded all the Line stickers of underrepresented characters so far, but if people have suggestions for how to better use this new technology that'd be neat
so, we have stickers now

you can, we've done that before
a role for underage people for us to enforce instead of Discord would really do more harm than good too. anyone can search roles on people, so it paints a target on them
the mature topics that come up in that channel aren't porn or the like anyways, so I don't personally see any issue if the occasional minor lies to Discord to see people talking about politics or heavy issues
I agree that people should generally not use a big public server as their first option for personal issues, it's why I'm opposed to a venting channel here. but I also agree that sometimes people just don't have any better options, and we are kind of in a limbo between comfy community and public area. there's been several people who seem to get good help here, so trying to police that further seems bad to me
<#336297840529899522> is already marked as an 18+ channel
that would be very nice of you! don't treat it as a priority though, not sure when we'll get around to editing the stickers
why aren't these stickers in alphabetical order <:HibikiThink:688429715362414641>
added them, thanks
added <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>


but sure, we can do that for now
having the same picture as both an emote and a sticker feels like kind of a waste

it needs to be exactly 320x320, if you do that then sure <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
but, <:Zababies:672238628398956594>
indecisiveness <:HibikiWhoops:585839808115507222>
or we could move one of these maybe <:HibikiMunch:672606446239744000><:HibikiMonch:688190074646691843>
anyways though, I like the HibikiYikes, so it'll at least go on the emoji server
Phanta's is sharp for instance

emojis are fine if they're the full 128x128 though, it's ujst because the later two are smol
I like having my zoom level at 150%, on 1440p, so it's a little blown up
we're out of slots, so any replacement has to be perfect! <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
but, the Shirabe one is mostly fine, so I guess 100x100 would be acceptable
they're all a little blurry for me

it has to be at least 128x128
I like that emoji, but it's slightly too few pixels to have good quality as an emoji
Millhi shared this a little while back, it's what I've been using
a wonder too is how far do we really want to go before we're just back to forums, or reddit, where everything is its own thread
<:ElfneinPresents:691733046633955439>
thanks <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>

sure, we can have that
ooh
<:MikuWhoa:670502684692054042>
320x320
would that really be useful though? in order to see that role, they have to click on you anyways, where they would already see your pronouns in the About Me section
they've been taken out <:CoolNoiseDontLookAtExplosions:929758650157895711>
I'll be making an announcement soonish with a bit more info
if there isn't, that's fine, we can make a channel here
ooh
<:HibiMikuPeek:661660014288568361> I can test with you for a bit
needing to change to a Community server to use them is less cool
forums are cool
As for example, I've noticed sourcing reposters posted here before by other users too, even earlier today
This isn't meant to sidestep the initial complaint, just wanting to know how far the complaint goes
But, for the specific initial issue, I'd like to use this to ask if people find the art channels are worse off if we allow any reposters at all, even if they provide sources
Would definitely rather not have this channel be a grounds to gather complaints about a user as a whole. That risks just more cliquey behavior
I don't think it's fair to pile on them for their posts outside the art channel
sorry, I'm not really sure why <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
Elfnein is supposedly already loaded with the ability to have exclusive roles that remove others, but when I set up the color roles, I couldn't get it working

so many new faces! welcome everyone <:HibikiHi:336657249827028993>
look, if you have a big problem with a user and reaaally want to talk about it then tell me in DMs so I can help you, but otherwise you need to stop waffling on about it in the introductions
just be careful, I'm not sure what you consider a dark sense of humor, but be sure to read over the rules and be aware that any form of bigotry isn't welcome here
<:HibikiHi:336657249827028993>

they're gone <:MikuDelete:661660028410920990>
you're being banned now, hope that was worth it
<@!269655454957830144> seriously, evading a mute after you just told me in DMs you would listen?
~~aside from almost losing a teeny tiny translucent bit of plastic~~
so far though, building gunpla has been a lot less scary than I thought it would be
the little head was actually such a pain <:MikuPanic:640289659452129310>
*progress*
very good touhou
Momiji!
you have such a cute art style
I love that color scheme
ooo that looks really pretty
the big purple winged ones especially
they look really pretty
it looks good!
<@!740195087895756820> please remember to keep symphogear-related stuff to <#357682999300718592> , double posting in both channels just pushes out other people's posts and isn't very nice
very pretty
Lilimon cute
super pretty
okay, enjoy a timeout for the day then. that's pretty unacceptable joking
<@!740195087895756820> why are you being needlessly mean?
Shirabe so smol
thank you
<@!105060198770614272> please don't use r*pe in that manner
https://twitter.com/chisaida_007/status/973335579466387462
a lot of japanese twitter artists don't upload everything on other sites
it's my attempt at collecting all of the slightly harder to find HibiMikus!
this is only one close I've seen

there has, I can find it real quick

<@!284390402210136064> I don't think I would make a good pic dealer, the only things I collect a lot of are Hibikis and Mikus <:HibiMiku:336656759424942080>
Hibiki holds a sphinx in her hands to befriend it or something like that
they did make 3.5 canon
the only thing from XDU I'll ever be buying is Miku's song when/if it comes out as a CD
I don't think I'm going to be spending money on this ever at this rate...
XDU is my first gacha
that's quite a lot
<:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
I did get two XD Marias, so I can do a mono-yellow team at least, but that feels kind of weak when I have at best a 52 Maid Bikki and 50 New Gears Miku as my other yellows
thank you for the good stuff though <:MikuGay:336656810788388864>
<@174440042289168384> yeah, I just spent 1600 gems and 21 tickets, and not one Miku
thank you <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
I really like that artist btw <:MikuGay:336656810788388864>
I've spent in total something close to 9k gems trying to get more copies of XDMiku since she came out, and I still only have one unusable copy <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
<@&425667771699822614> can I get some extra comfy HibiMiku? I need some cheering up after XDU just destroyed me
I want it to be accepted enough to let me have the Anglerfish team tank in WoT <:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>

it'd be possible to recreate it if you really wanted it probably
I think it's one of the story backgrounds just put behind Hibiki for the banner

it's all amazing, I'm going to be in a state of <:MikuGay:336656810788388864> for the rest of the day
I'm surprised how lacking my collection is in regards to Mikugear with Hibiki








I also can't find a proper full version
the Miku one was shown as part of a live
hi Ferrous! <:HibikiHi:336657249827028993> it's good to see you and your art here
thanks ❤
well, I've really gotten into something that has to do with boats lately
I might actually try drawing something that isn't Symphogear soon to maybe mix things up a bit
thank you
I'm hopeful that soon I'll settle onto a new method where I can be happy with my nsfw stuff again, and make it look way nicer
💟
I appreciate that you like the sfw stuff a lot, you've said that before
but, I have been kind of wanting to avoid doing nsfw for a bit, because it is a lot more difficult to make that stuff look good
usually I spend a lot of time redoing everything
becasue this was just one sessions of drawing, without any different stages
this is actually one of my messiest drawings I've ever done, as a technical thing
this one in particular might be nicer looking mostly because I'm going through another personal art crisis or something, where, I've been trying a lot of different stuff for myself and also trying not to stress about it too much
sure
<:MikuGay:336656810788388864>
I appreciate your response regardless
Bikki is on the bustier side, I think she could at least
because it's kind of cute

it's so easy to upload to Twitter though,it's hard to break out of it <:ElfneinBullying:421432763078410241>
there's a few artists I like to look at, but I always have to scroll through soooo much food to see their actual art
Twitter is trash, especially if you're someone who also uploads a lot of food pictures
it's so convenient! <:MikuBliss:336657233712513024>
<:MikuPraise:585839808765493249>
yeah, it makes sense I guess
kind of silly that my artist tag there has the _24, though
oh yeah, I saw that!
once I switch ISPs soon, I might be able to actually browse the site, and then I'll finally start uploading there too
moving to Pixiv is scary! I'll have to do things like tag my pictures so it's easier to see my art, and who even wants that sort of convenience
I don't know how people can do it
I don't have anything to say on Twitter <:HibikiWhoops:585839808115507222>
that social media presence image is really true lol
it's gross
<:TsubasaDisgust:349013662775902209>
they're basically the same, Gelbooru rips from Danbooru, along with some extras that Danbooru doesn't allow
that's really good <:MikuGay:336656810788388864>

waoh, my art used in someone else's meme, I feel complete now
I'm Tomosato sized
darn, I'm not quite as smol as Miku

thank you for your service, Kerrik! <:MikuPraise:585839808765493249>
wow, who's that other Lily
the best! <:MikuGay:336656810788388864>
or trying to at least
Hibiki cheering her up <:MikuGay:336656810788388864>
lol
<:MikuPraise:585839808765493249>
that's a very fancy... Bikki
I'll be looking forward to every one of them! <:MikuPraise:585839808765493249>
<:HibikiBlep:605209109284782090>
<:TsubasaPeek:623246193002151938>
that's a very good offering
<:MikuPraise:585839808765493249>
my personal opinion is that so far today your pace has been fine, but you probably shouldn't be using jii_skip at this pace since it hasn't been very much
<:HibikiWow:614268629952757760>
definitely lol
Hibiki proposing in her pajamas while Miku's making dinner, how romantic
the best of both <:MikuGay:336656810788388864>
she's just so cute <:MikuGay:336656810788388864>
<:MikuBliss:336657233712513024>
I don't think so, it can still come up
that's a pretty niche channel bloat
because they go on for long enough, and happened often enough, that it has been shutting out other content
(like me)
that's what <#407060923078017026> is for, and that worked fine, but there's been enough complaints that it would probably be best for everyone to keep massive art dumps to DMs for the people who want it
it's best to keep the channel clear for new stuff and variety
I hear mobile Discord is all sorts of werid
that sounds like a good compromise for when a person wants to be totally flooded
picking favorites is always tough <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
it'll help make way for new art you find too
your collection is great and massive, and we want to see it, but pruning it like that sounds like a better way to digest it
yeah, it might be best for a time to just slow down on sharing the art dumps, and try to just go back to having them be a once in while special thing
yeah
talking about art dumps feels pretty on topic for the art channel if you'd like to continue
I'm very transparent <:HibikiWhoops:585839808115507222>
<:MikuPraise:585839808765493249>
two very good hibimikus <:MikuGay:336656810788388864>
give me your best gay
you're good <:HibikiBlep:605209109284782090>
it's not a problem to have jii_skip be used less
and comics, yeah
when Shirabe runs out, or for special events
yeah, I'd like to be in that <:MikuPraise:585839808765493249>



some select HibiMiku, thanks to Kerrik sending me a bunch of it
go for it! <:KanadeSinging:421432676789256202>

stuff that you wouldn't be comfortable having pop up in public would be better in <#336297808221044736>
the distinction between the two is based more in courtesy than whether or not there's genitals in the image
<@209896097026408449> please move that link over to <#336297808221044736>
thanks for understanding <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
very pretty!
the basic starter assault rifle/chainsaw gun
yeah, it is
https://twitter.com/koyaya02/status/1191296420608802816

it's referencing Cobra I think
oh, I know that one!

I try my best to make super soft art
I'm very easily flustered by your compliments!

~~very old art~~
a long time ago I may have already tried drawing that dress <:HibikiWhoops:585839808115507222>
the dresses look so good <:HibikiGay:670494484701773845>

those cheerleader pics, oh my gosh those are so cute <:HibikiGay:670494484701773845>
honestly because I just haven't seen it before
if you want to talk more about subcultures of romani people though, yes, please use <#336297840529899522> , but it's final that gypsy is considered a slur here
well, again, we're an english server and not a french one, gypsy is not the same as gitan in english
because it's as simple as it being a slur in english, I don't understand how other cultures feel about it because I'm not apart of them, I can only rule from an american and english-centric culture
yes, but please don't ignore the other half of that sentence
gipsy/gitan is from the french language and doesn't really apply here I don't think. I'm not super informed on those specifics, I only know of gypsy with a y, and that in english it's considered a slur
from english wikipedia at least, they claim that gypsy came about in the english language as a shortening of Egypt, when people wrongly thought Romani people roamed from there
<@!195044406343106560> apologies for this being so late, but gypsy is considered a slur towards Romani people, so please refrain from using it in the future, and also the event that outfit is from is meant to be an Arabian Chris
it's for ~~testing~~ a good cause <:HibiMiku:432007202136391690>


<:ShirabeAwe:698939825113268306> nice work, Kerrik!
sorry, I don't do commission stuff anymore
I'll send you the lines too though if you want to try coloring it
because I've never done that before, that's spooky, Rady <:MikuFear:642799630605615114>
last time I looked around I think a good one I saw was paints chainer or something like that?
I don't plan on coloring it, but I can send you the lines themselves if you want to do so or use one of those fancy ai colorers
that's totally fine
<:ChrisHibikiHug:630262562361049121>
<@!266379640069685252> your idea of Elfnein wearing a cowboy hat made me want to sketch it

it's fine, now you know <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
using the skip command on all pictures completely defeats the purpose of us trying to give credit to the artists, and making it easier for everyone to find the source of the beautiful art
so like, post the first image normally, and then post the next few from the same artist/album with the skip command
you're meant to use the skip only if you're posting several images from the same source btw

waoo that's a cool bikki
punch girls are good
adorable <:ShirabeAwe:698939825113268306>
you're a good person Micha, it's not very nice to call yourself that either
~~I have very complicated feelings about fictional characters~~
occasionally I'll see fan stuff that looks cute though, and my head sort of rationalizes it as more okay since they're all three in on it
hibimikuchris is not a ship I really like a whole ton either tbh, at least as a full ship
things like love live I can definitely see being easier to think about alternative ships, the manga makes things so complicated and they don't exactly confirm anything
imagining all of her motivations shifting from that is impossible to me, maybe I'm just not big brain enough
even in AUs then though, Hibiki without Miku is like, not even Hibiki at that point I guess
tbh, I can't enjoy crackshipping since it just comes off to me as imagining them cheating on their partners, I don't know how yall do it <:HibikiThink:688429715362414641>
adorbs
~~just to put a little bit of art into the art channel~~
pairing off the dead characters is still a little strange though to me
it's okay, now we know about adult serena <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
yes!! <:MikuGay:336656810788388864>
ooooooh
seeing her despair only makes it harder for me to imagine Hibiki with anyone else, because then I just cannot believe that Hibiki would go to such extreme lengths for any other girl
> That's Edgebikki
<@!430379754190012426> no way, Edgebikki is how she is because of how madly in love with Miku she is <:MikuGay:336656810788388864>
sauce <https://old.reddit.com/r/Genshin_Impact/comments/je1lig/xiangling_fan_art_by_me_d/>
3_skip
yeah, here you go <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
some people do that to make it harder to edit out the signature
though it does make it more special when it happens now
I miss being able to run into random toohoo fans everywhere <:MikuCry:688397678584791074>
it has a prequel movie, yeah
ooh! Vesperia is pretty easily one of my favorite rpgs, I hope you have fun with it!

doms are cute
that's rare!
wao, Epic Seven art
there's been a lot of good hibimiku posted while I was sleeping <:MikuGay:336656810788388864>
<:HibikiWow:738172615453048912> they look so cute together!
<:TsubasaPeek:623246193002151938> thank you very much!
<:MikuPanic:640289659452129310>
thank you too, Amiya, I worry a lot about being too mean when I have to do these mod things
it makes me happy to hear nice things
<:TsubasaPeek:623246193002151938> thank you!
<@!236944855828398080> those aren't art posts, for sharing high-volume jokes like that, <#407060923078017026> would be a lot more fitting
bit too borderline I think, would be safer in <#336297808221044736>

aw, I'm untagged on a booru
<:TsubasaPeek:623246193002151938> would you mind telling me where you got it from? I think it's really neat seeing how far my art spreads
neat!

Cute
Love these outfits, so cute <:MikuCute:672908542763859968>
Cute!
that's a cute Show By Rock crossover
now we have something better!
very adorable
people won't usually notice, unless you're grabbing silly screenshots
likely to do it as quickly as possible <:MariaConfident:336657338729627658>
I'm slow <:HibikiTired:422925410490253313>
I've always felt like I take longer than most people
🤷
serious answer is, that emoji took me like three hours I think
<:GarieWink:336657101273169921>
effort? oh, that takes me too long
that's a solid 15 or less
definitely
oh gosh
love some good Quality™
yeah
honestly
very excited to hear what those songs could be <:MikuGay:336656810788388864>
that cover art looks amazing
sleep is also very important <:HibikiTired:422925410490253313>
I'm looking forward to your hard work <:MikuPraise:585839808765493249>
she's so cool <:HibikiEager:407398049531559937>
ep1 made me really happy
<:HibiMikuCry:586026583870013455>
XV is really toppling expectations <:HibikiEager:407398049531559937>
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
amazing!
it feels so good to be this excited for Symphogear again
gosh, that whole episode really picked my mood up
it was like they got to make up for missing out on AXZ's opening fight
that was so dangerous!
the mini-scythe was super neat
I was all worried they were going to do something dumb when Kirika rushed ahead of Shirabe, but it was so nice to see them adapting
the tragedy was also neat, but in a different way
I really loved that dmjii fight, and the concert, before the tragedy, was really neat too
just the whole way through is nothing but incredible so far
I'm trying not to let myself get too swept away, but these first two episodes have been really amazing
for real
dmjii was super gay!
I'm really hoping it's all a massive double bait
but the flags
I don't want it to happen <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
it does make it more exciting
lol
I really didn't expect Symphogear to get that hardcore again
that was very shocking!
so, I just finished watching the episode
with so many tragedies happening at her concerts
I imagine at this point she's really feeling like she just can't sing anymore
very brutal
she had a very explosive introduction
likeable is probably not the right word though, yeah
they're enjoyable to watch so far
they're all great though
oh my, Marking is a really good one <:MikuGay:336656810788388864>
wholesome only <:HibiMiku:432007202136391690> <:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
she has to really fist god
she has to fist god
I would be okay with gay gods
unless it's both Hibiki and Miku
I just kind of hope they just don't do a god ascension ending tbh
Chris has such a huge following that it's hard to see them doing that, but really everyone has that potentially protecting them
I believe it'll end up having a happy ending, but they're setting up some death pretty hard it feels like
this episode makes me worry so much!
I just don't want them to be split apart <:HibiMikuCry:586026583870013455>
oh gosh
she has to <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
with HibiMiku's child as the protag <:MikuGay:336656810788388864>
I want something like that too hopefully, so Symphogear can live on still
it was terrifying <:HibikiShock:336656371611074580>
seriously, they're always so elaborate looking, and they keep getting totally blown up
at least for the callbacks to season 1
them looking so similar is definitely on purpose
very excited <:HibiMikuCry:586026583870013455>
since Hibiki usually sings her B-side in the show
I haven't actually listened to the song yet
hyper gay
I like her thighs
a vampire, and an old magical girl villain
she looks like a classical villain
they needed Durandal to scratch that
remember the big dragon form at the least
but she also directly blocked everything else
Fine let herself get cut in half, yes
yes, I get that, but that wasn't all that happened
and it was fully blocking everything
Fine used it in the finale
I'm not quite sure what you mean
yeah
that was why she was so focused on Hibiki's fusion, because it showed she could fuse with Nehushtan
exactly
that was supposedly one of the reasons for the shockplay with Fine
Chris took it off because if she didn't it was going to fuse to her
Nehushtan was powerful, but it had bad side-effects
showing how they're getting more and more control over the gears, and the alchmey stuff with it
it felt like that whole scene was meant to be a power show off
good night!
I'm very sorry that you had to peruse for KanaDay and got spoiled on that
that duet scene was incredible!
I can't believe this is only episode 4
the true sentinel
I could see it happening
<:HibikiShock:336656371611074580>
<:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
I'm super shocked at Fudou's innate strength
I can't help it, my internet has been useless lately <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
Miku is definitely going to be using that gauntlet, isn't she
it's really close now though <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
I'm really late, but, that episode
<:HibiMikuCry:586026583870013455> <:HibiMikuCry:586026583870013455> <:HibiMikuCry:586026583870013455>
Gen has been overruled a *lot* the last couple of seasons
that's a good point
<:HibiMikuCry:586026583870013455>
it's easier to save face when you're not publicly doing anything
he seems to already be linked into everything
I don't think that's possible, when we can see that Fudou continually interrupts conversation that happen on the bridge
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
there's no way he won't know, especially with him now taking total control seemingly
definitely
it looked like Hibiki slapped on gold bits to everyone else, and not in a temporary way
Miku strong!
what if Fudou is a custodian
he definitely could be
Fudou is Genjuuro levels of strength
I don't expect Noble Red to turn against Fudou
she can outrun them!
that's what I'm most worried about <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
Fudou is probably going to turn the entire government against them
it feels like at this point, any further resistance against Fudou is going to cause SONG to go completely rogue
Fudou vs Genjuuro finale <:MariaConfident:336657338729627658>
what was up with that
oh yeah
but then she didn't disappoint
I was a little bit worried that they were going to have Millarc show hesitation to kill in that scene
Hibiki is so gay
she's super great
with the force of her and Germain's convictions! <:HibikiEager:407398049531559937> <:Germain:421434126856486912>
literally bouncing in my seat at how strong she's become
I loved the big Hibiki punching scene sooo much
that's a good touch!
woah, I didn't notice that
need more fit Hibiki <:HibikiEager:407398049531559937>
that bath scene <:MikuGay:336656810788388864>
I assume the AXZ OP is their daily training
<:MikuBliss:336657233712513024>
saving the world burns a lot of calories!
xdu <:MikuBliss:336657233712513024>
the song in her heart though
Tsubasa doesn't need to come out of her depression on her own
I think it could be really neat to have a Kanada flashback leading her forward to show how she's surrounded by so many people now who can help her too
that would be really neat
it's strange that they're saving her's for last
Tsubasa's is set up to be really somber I feel
everyone else so far has just been like, yeah, that fits their theme I guess
Kirika's was so lewd feeling because she did the thigh thing on purpose
oh my
vampires are just spooky like that
we're already pretty much there
<:HibikiEager:407398049531559937>
deaths can make for great storytelling, but I don't know if I could handle it for Symphogear <:HibiMikuCry:586026583870013455>
it's super well done
they keep hammering in how weak Noble Red are, but they're really clever
I love that
and then through Miku when she puts it on <:HibikiShock:336656371611074580>
what if she speaks through the gauntlet
the  mass city destruction turned out to be almost as bad though
the whole time that Tsubasa was seeing fake Millarcs, I was expecting them to end up being civilians
cute!
I did!
there was definitely more showing that Vanessa could decide to switch sides
she was just in such a rush since Miku wouldn't answer her phone
yeah, I'd agree with that
<:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
she's definitely not dead
pls no
Symphogear's teases and cliffhangers are killing me <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
this episode had some really good downtime, but those Miku moments were painful!
super late! <:HibiMikuCry:586026583870013455>
yes!
I want to see their kids continuing on to punch things! <:HibikiEager:407398049531559937>
I hope that it continues in some manner for a very long time
it's incredible that Symphogear has gone on for so long
at least we'll still have XDU <:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
me neither
I'm not going to be able to handle it <:HibiMikuCry:586026583870013455>
I didn't expect Miku being captured so early on, it feels like there's still so much more of the season left
please
saturday needs to hurry up!
lol, that's never happening
wow, surprisingly little love for autoscorers
combat Efnein seems so scary, since she's such a precious character
I really like her voice
honestly, I want to hear Elfnein singing more
will she get a song better than genocide <:HibikiEager:407398049531559937>
~~and her continued absence in XDU~~
the memory mention, and Millarc apparently aiming for Elfnein lends a lot more to a possible Carol comeback
that was really great
her singing!
lol, DMJii this episode was great
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089> there's so many scary possibilities
no! <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
she wasn't shown much either during that fight, which was worringly suspicious in the moment
yeah, that is unfortunately quite true
BL has always been a major spotlight, but nowadays I'm happy that the ratio is much more even in gay
it really is, and it's amazing that works like that are getting more commonplace
and every anime with girls has subtext it seems, even if the reasons for that is questionable
just about every season we get major gay productions
comparing gay in anime now, to just a few years ago is insane how much more gets shown
it has, a lot imo
it's great that they've been able to do more post-tv
the creators did long blog posts on Tumblr about what they wanted to do
it was very big for a kids-focused station
but in very vague language and long looks
and nods to each other thatt they wanted to try being together
it was just handholding
they did go to bat for it, but they weren't allowed to show much
a lot of Korra's groundbreaking was the creatrs confirming what they wanted the ending to be
comparing Symphogear to Korra seems a little silly, considering Symphogear has already shown on-screen more than what Korra did in their ending
Hibiki may not gush about Miku in the same way Miku does about her, but she definitely expresses how much she loves her a lot
the duckies are so adorable
everyone talks about Miku's love, but a lot of people seem to pass by Hibiki's lines too
yeah!
I've gathered that, I'm very excited <:MikuGay:336656810788388864>
it's really obvious that something is going to happen
last episode had Miku say her love again too
I still haven't listened to her B-side so I'm not clicking that but
like, an actual hatred for gay
you have to be like that guy to deny the gay
they have been unashamed waifu types though
I've seen a couple people claim that Eiai isn't about Hibiki too
delusional people will latch onto anything, sure, but when was the last time they even referred to each other as just friends
I would say the wiggle room they leave is very debatable
looking back on Sakura Trick, it's not really a show with a ton of substance, but it's a little dated by this point honestly, and that amount of pure yuri in a show back then, and still kind of now, was incredible to see
we're only missing a kiss scene
they already have!
that's why I'm always a little confused when people say that Symphogear isn't gay, or they won't confirm anything
Sakura Trick was the perfect amount of ridiculous
the pairings already directly say how much they love each other
I truly expect that from Symphogear, especially since they haven't hid any of the relationships at all
they may not show a kiss, but that anime was huge, for so many reasons, and is undeniably gay
I recently rewatched PriPri, and something like it seems very easy to sell nowadays
Princess Principal
would PriPri count?
I wonder what you would consider to be gay enough though
they actually are
Miku is definitely the responsible one
🍙
they even did an extensive interview during AXZ that talked about the stages of their relationship, such as calling S1 their early dating period
word of god like that is just actually the best to see
<:HibiMikuCry:586026583870013455>
just two gals, paling around
<:HibiMiku:432007202136391690>
that's the best thing I've ever heard
Hibiki is going to bring Miku back with her gentle fists <:MikuGay:336656810788388864>
it's really spooky, but really good!
hibimiku!!!
Carol!!!
this episode was amazing!!!
that tiny girl is about to bring a whole lot of genocide
headpat
tiny Carol!
incredible
just like Amalgam!
oh gosh you're right!
Fudou is her biodad
<:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
<:HibiMikuCry:586026583870013455>
internal fight could be neat
<:HibiMikuCry:586026583870013455>
I really hope so
<:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
I don't know what to think anymore
this?
<:ChrisCharge:586320496346529792>
that was pretty good <:MikuGay:336656810788388864>
<:HibiMikuCry:586026583870013455>
she's had a very rough time
it was a good perspective on him
topdad was pretty fine
I think it's important to remember the main reason that Bikki was upset about Elfnein was because she couldn't punch it better
Noble Red got absolutely demolished
it was kind of weird, but it's not a dealbreaking thing to me
she broke at the beginning though, and then she's forced to wait until she can go punch
her being happy to go back to work is the same as her being happy that she can go potentially save Miku
it felt a lot like Hibiki attempting to cover up her shock until more information, she's done that a couple of times now
I don't know how to properly convey my feelings for this episode
that crater! <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
Gen's fight was great
anything is possible in Symphogear
but Elsa and Millarc got completely erased
like, Vanessa might be okay becauase she's so much robot
what will be back?
got torn apart by a laser
extremely shocked at how quickly they just...
it was really rough all around <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
I still have hope <:HibiMiku:432007202136391690>
yes! <:MikuGay:336656810788388864>
<:TsubasaDisgust:349013662775902209>
my favorite pasttime is reading about hetero Hibiki
really like hibimiku <:HibiMiku:432007202136391690>
shockingly enough, I
I'd love to see some spinoff stuff
even though Symphogear ending is sad, it means they might take more risks
final season is the reason I'm most hopeful too tbh
<:HibikiBlep:605209109284782090>
https://twitter.com/sento_san/status/1166716000932265989
we need those
!
they have definitely amped up the comedy on her
Kirika's contributions this season seem to just be for comedy relief, and it's wonderful
Millarc's temptation is very strong...
she's just too cool!
<:HibikiEager:407398049531559937> <:ChrisCharge:586320496346529792>
I think it's mostly just because, yeah, there isn't really time this season to do anything serious for her now
yeah, that was very blatant
Enki is probably going to explain more
that explanation they gave also glossed over Fine's involvement
we're probably going to get even more exposition about how Shem-ha is
hopefully Chris doesn't do anything too crazy <:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
like what made her believe her tower caused the curse, or if she's maybe directly related to Shem-ha with the whole genetics thing
I really want to see them talk about Fine more
oh nooo
there's still a chance for a wedding epilogue <:HibikiEager:407398049531559937>
it's super canon!!!!
aaaa!!!
there is certainly just enough leeway to let them do whatever for a possible continuation
I'm very happy!!
but it was still amazing!!
no kiss though :<
<:HibiMiku:432007202136391690><:HibiMiku:432007202136391690><:HibiMiku:432007202136391690>
~~I'm too tired to finish it tonight~~
we will have fanart for the kiss
suuuuper gay
that was also the best <:MikuGay:336656810788388864>
Hibiki screaming that she just wanted Miku for herself was the best <:MikuGay:336656810788388864>
gear will live on in our hearts!
it's true
lol
just play XDU <:GarieWink:336657101273169921>
<:MikuPraise:585839808765493249>
takes sooo long to complete the old events
event differences have been really obviously lately with all the old reruns
Chris should have got her parents :<
I rolled my eyes at seeing the Ver spirit, but I'm not too upset since it was showing everyone in the past
it's completely unavoidably gay, they do outright say it, they just don't kiss
eeeh, baiting isn't the right word
<:MikuPraise:585839808765493249>
Fine thinks her tower caused the curse, but it was actually something much bigger than her
yeah, that's what I mean
and how exactly she got into people's genes like Shemmy can do
the one thing missing from XV to me is knowing what exactly caused Fine to think she was the cause of the curse
dmjii at least had several fun moments that were still great to see
there wasn't anything left, and anything new would be taking away from more important things
quite a few characters had their arcs already treaded
gosh, it was all so good!!
selfish Hibiki <:MikuGay:336656810788388864>
there's a lot of top gay moments this episode

unless Carol got at it
silver's right
still looking forward to it <:HibiMiku:432007202136391690>
<:TsubasaSmug:585839805737467920>
eagerly waiting for the cheese <:HibiMiku:432007202136391690>
<:HibiMiku:432007202136391690>
nope, still Lily White <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
I've only ever seen Millhi
I don't think I'm in everyone else's rotations though
yeah
in XDU? I still play it every day though
I've barely slept, can't stop thinking about Symphogear <:HibiMikuCry:586026583870013455>
<:HibiMiku:432007202136391690>
hibimiku <:HibiMiku:432007202136391690>
<:MikuGay:336656810788388864>
yeah, but the lyrics weren't there, and those are just so amazing
I'm a real bundle of feelings right now
I wanted to save it in case it appeared in the show
nope
it's so good!
my heart just
I finally listened to kimi dake ni
<:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
yeah
which means so much, to show that all her sunshine remarks and everything was definitely not from a space of just gals being pals
she's saying that she's felt the same way this whole time
Hibiki's response has a lot more feeling in it than just a kiss
Ion has the right idea!
actually a perfect ending
the gay was so good!!
that was my whole motivation for drawing <:MikuPraise:585839808765493249>
you shouldn't post content in here that's not meant for this channel
the comments there are *especially* bad
we had people here say that they had canceled their dupes
oh they definitely were
if a later BD has tickets, that one will be boosted up dramatically
yeah
XV's BD1 still had climbing sales numbers before the cancels because of no live ticket, the amount of copies they sold without the ticket shouldn't be seen as declining popularity
it was really wonderful getting to share and see everyones reactions <:HibiMikuCry:586026583870013455>
<:HibiMikuCry:586026583870013455>
just to make sure, does that include the new Christmas XD stuff, like Miku?
!!
<:ElfneinBullying:421432763078410241>
<:MikuBliss:336657233712513024>
oh <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
I think the problem is that you seem to have accidentally named your card `rv_help`, it's not named Kiri, that's just the category for Kiri cards
:<
um
rv_mycard ???2
rv_rename "???" "BLADE"
rv_mycard ???
rv_setflagship Shining Sun
rv_mycard ???3
rv_mycard ???2
rv_mycard ???3
rv_mycard ???2
yeah, that was her second xdrive card iirc
true
though I've also admittedly only read the gay stuff
your stories have generally top-notch consent imo, especially compared to other stuff I've seen
that sounds awful
that's a really good one Alice
<:MikuGay:336656810788388864>
from how the article puts it, it sounds extra problematic that it sounds like they want to cast Gill as just a cis woman too, so they purposefully wanted ScarJo
<:ChrisEating:384879395829186560>
trying to force yourself to talk to more people certainly helps your odds with that a lot though, even if it's just every once in a while. doing that online works way easier for me since I get to compose my thoughts better in text before saying anything
you just have to find the right people who enjoy you for who you are, with shared interests and all
that feeling of not being able to open your mouth is something I struggle with every day too, but that doesn't mean that you or I are bad to be around, or that you're boring!
I think you're nice, Lucifer, from what I've seen
you just have to make sure your hairs are short for the first time, since it hurts more and you might not rip out the entire hair if it's too long
since mine doesn't work there, but I just use different things for that
I got mine for that much, although you might have to get a seperate smaller one for hairs like on your face
yep!
it's also super cheap, since like a $20 epilator will last years
it's like waxing as far as it takes forever for the hair to grow back because you're completely removing the hair, and it also hurts a lot since you're ripping stuff out with a bunch of rapid tweezers, but that also gets easier over time
for the hair discussion above, my personal recommendation for removal is an epilator
it's not great
yeah, most people who use the term mean it as people choosing to act gay
that was fun
yeah, I think finding yuri communities and actively (guitily) indulging in them were the biggest thing that changed me
I think people can change, but it's takes some serious time
I grew up in the deep south around some awful culture, but look at me now
I'm honestly surprised to see someone seriously use the term, haven't seen it in a while
this place is great
I'm really happy to see Beagle saying that
well said
I don't like the lewd censorship either, but you're not saying anything in a good light
Zerona, you're going about this in a difficult to follow way
we always played games on Xbox or other stuff instead
me too, my brother growing up was into games before me and even he used the PS2/3 for movies more than anything
that was a fun classic meme
but it was such a good deal if you wanted that media stuff
I still remember the backlash Sony got for having such an expensive console since they included the blu-ray player
<:ElfneinWeld:586027421296492585>
that also sounds like a good reward
get some good sleep <:HibikiTired:422925410490253313>
congrats! <:MikuPraise:585839808765493249>
I'm someone who is personally really uncomfortable being referred to as queer
if I knew someone who wanted to be referred to as queergender, I respect that they want to be that, and that's super fine that that makes them comfortable, but I would probably just work around saying the term if I could, since just saying the word out loud is really uncomfortable
it's been a bad word used against me in the past, and in the environment I was raised in, so it's difficult for me to see it as anything but bad, although I know that isn't true for all other people

Don't forget to put your head down

Blizzard is an absolutely trash corporation btw https://playhearthstone.com/en-us/blog/23179289
four teams in china, a team in korea, london, and then a bunch in the us
a lot of players are doubtful it'll go through because of the worldwide travel
next year they're supposed to be doing home games in their cities, but it's still not set in stone how that's going to work
but then, companies probably wouldn't be paying the 20mil+ for league spots if it was losing a bunch of money so 🤷
the only sure way of seeing how popular OWL is has to be engagement in stuff like twitch chats and reddit, and it's pretty obvious that those get a lot less activity than the big CSGO or LoL tournaments
it's hard to say for sure what the numbers are though since Blizzard inflates all of the numbers with rewards for watching
viewership is down from last year, but supposedly still above what Blizzard predicted, although coincidentally most of the viewer numbers are from China
in OWL, there's a bit over 100 players signed to teams, but of course not all of those are known names, even at the absolute top
that might be debatable for marketable competitors though
yeah, it's exactly that, this is Blizzard showing that they'll only be woke enough for the money first
I follow OWL pretty closely, and they've had a lot of issues with getting new players and keeping who they have, and blatantly showing how easily they will throw people away like that can't be a good look for pros wanting to go pro for them
firing casers and refusing to pay a player like that is just so extreme
I hope it won't be forgotten, if not just because of the precedence for their competitive scenes
but I haven't played in a couple of weeks now, and their flimsy thin lgbt+ support already had me annoyed
I enjoy Overwatch a lot, used to play it tons
yeah, honestly, I'm not going to hurt much by refusing to support Blizzard
I don't like PoE for instance
I'm not much of a Diablo-like player though tbh, so my opinion might be bad <:ElfneinDrowning:336656417035517952>
I enjoyed Torchlight a lot personally
which is uninstalled now I guess
I found out from the overwatch reddits actually
reddit is in a pretty big uproar about this
yeah, being cucked is being cheated on basically
it got popular as a insult in recent years
cuck comes from cuckold, a fetish about taking someone's spouse
but the rest of the teams usually have korean all-stars
the chinese teams are good at it, with I think all of them having at least a couple chinese players
I think that's what teams want to strive to do, but culture and stuff makes that difficult
a lot of teams are a mash of nationalities
well, sort of
most teams do though for pr
no, I don't think so
I did that for Phantasy Star Universe <:HibikiOhNo:586337444597596202>
TF2 also gave you all the important items through achievements if you were unlucky enough to not get it through playtime
good stuff! <:MikuPraise:585839808765493249>
they didn't even bother looking at roles, they were certainly here just to cause trouble
<:HibikiBlep:605209109284782090>
if either of you types another word I'm going to temp kick you both
yelling past each other like that and getting the last word needs to stop
okay you two
it's a fun fact related to the earlier conversation of a single large city
this spun way out of hand
because you began this by trying to shoo them to a different channel
you're taking this very personally
nobody attacked you from the beginning
they aren't joking about the size of a city
it's still serious even if it's not exactly the kind of conversation you wanted from them
rady may have not directly tried to engage with you along your line of sciencing away bad hygiene, but they did engage with you about hygiene and city density in a maths way, while engaging with the broader topic
you're talking about feasibility of a utopian mega city and they're providing extra info for that
I don't see why you're dismissing their inputs like this
well, it is though, especially in regards to people talking about the smell since if it's a city with normal density that wouldn't have that issue, it would have to be mega massive
they aren't directly trying to argue with you by saying that, but it's extra information in a discussion about the feasibility of a city like that
there was a conversation about a single large city in terms of utopias or something, so they brought up a number to say how massive a city like that would be
area is still used because you can't live in the empty volume of space above your street for instance
I asked and you said it was for the lulz
I came in as you were talking about how aliens wuold measure our cities
I said I was confused, so maybe I'm completely missing everything
are we stacking people head to toe, or are they laying down?
how dense is the population possibility?
how do you define how many people are going to fit in our cube of space?
say we're going to have the height of this city measurement be randomly defined as a kilmoeter tall too
I'm trying to illustrate why you can't use volume to define the space of a city
you're measuring the volume of a city
these are random practical blockers
why would we stop building it?
it is going to be infinitely tall no matter what when we're talking about a city's potential space
how do you measure stacking people in a infinitely tall space of a kilometer?
then we'll define it as a kilometer
how do you measure people stacked in a volume of some undefined space?
how would you measure that?
like, why are you asking for volume so much? what are you wanting to measure exactly?
can you answer me?
I'm really confused on what volume you're asking for
you can have as much volume anywhere you want, but when measuring a city you use the area of land and all the floors to add up how much actual area is being used by people
the point is that the volume is basically infinite and meaningless
please do not pressure someone to give out where they live
er, here as in irl
I wouldn't answer truthfully if someone asked me randomly here, but if it's someone I'm already friends with, it's not a problem at all
yeah, most especially if it's obvious that you're someone safe to say that to
but you can't really answer both to gay or straight
if they ask "girls or guys?" sure, it's kind of fine
becasue just asking strictly gay or straight kind of excludes people like me who like both
if asking more vague like that though, it's best to ask what their sexuality is I think
so long as you avoid something silly like, "are you one of those gays?" or something, it would probably go down fine
yeah, just being direct in what you're asking would be best then
but it's not something that's likely to get a nice response if you bring it up out of the blue
if it comes up in coversation, just asking what they're sexuality is, or if they're into guys/girls is best
honestly that's probably one of the better ways, but it really depends on why you're asking
that's very based on context
that's something you'll have to elaborate on
it's pretty obvious that there's a motive behind so many people slamming it with a hyper low score
there's no way a legitimate review score would ever get that low
it's less that they did worldbuilding outside of the game, but that they let the straight characters talk about their families and loves in-game, but not the gay characters
just because they brought it up post-launch in spinoff stories that were not represented in the game at all
personally, Blizzard is probably the one example I can even think of that had really poor representation as an attempt to get gay support
<:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
?
it's absolutely a good idea to explore why you may have certain preferences though
it's impossible for everyone to like everything, it's okay to have preferences in any sort of aspect of dating life
I think it's easy to imagine, even as a pan person
the only thing I've been discussing with either of you is to try and say they/them instead of he/him
we're not saying you have to be a perfect person from this point on, but please make an effort towards changing your habits
defaulting to they/them is just, the nice thing to do, to avoid any sticky situations if you don't like people being upset at you for getting pronouns wrong
it is okay of course if you don't know any better, which is why we try to encourage teaching people about this stuff
the entire point is make the other person more comfortable
<@!100162379161022464> whether or not this is a non-issue to you doesn't really matter
if you don't mean any bad will, why don't you want to get used to the neutral option?
it really feels like you think I'm mad at you for something completely unrelated
I'm not sure why you keep brining that up
pronoun roles would tell you plainly what people want to be referred as, so you don't have to worry about what they like
me too, my teaching was he/him for when you don't know, but that's obviously changed as time has gone on, and it does take a lot of time to change habits, we only ask that you make the effort
do you have something against pronoun roles?
so long as you make an effort to use the generally very accdepted neutral they/them, people will be understanding
we're not punishing you, we're proposing a way to make everyone feel better
you decided to take personal offense and put words in another users mouth, I would've also stepped in there if I was awake
you need to take a step back and carefully read over chat logs
she was not, and that is a major example of why I'm stepping you
there are a lot of other people on this server, and regardless of your intentions, you are making this exceedingly difficult for other people to converse
you are making these conversation entirely about you, repeatedly
you cannot keep doing this, people aren't attacking you or trying to argue this stuff with you at all
okay, I'm awake and I need to step in and point this out to you Aria. it seems that all day today you've been grasping pretty hard at several people attacking you personally
sure
this is the issue
don't go on about this complex you have again
stop
I am telling you
I care about what your current actions are
I don't care about your personal grudge with Saki
yes
please, <#336297840529899522> isn't the place to be placing this kind of bait, I'm going to have to ask you to stop or have an actual discussion
cutting out all electronics is absolutely not the right response, you seem to make yourself really happy when listening to music or watching anime, or playing games, it wouldn't help anything to cut out legitimate things that make you happy
it makes it exceedingly hard to live how you actually want, when your brain gets accustomed to doing stuff for other people's attention
I say social media specifically because it's really hurtful to you because of things like instant replies and likes and all those interactions that meant to make you feel good, but really just promote throwing up all of your daily life that you think would get fun responses, and then possibly getting really disappointed when you don't have a fitting response
like, you realize you were scared of chips today, and instead of dealing with that with any proper coping mechanisms or pushing yourself to just, pick up the bag, you vented about it to us, which is just reinforcing a bad behavior
today, and recently, it really feels like you're coming to us for all of your problems, and frankly, we don't have all the answers, and I worry for you that you're soaking up all this parasocial interaction as just temporary dopamine rushes to avoid facing your issues in a healthy way
lectric, I got to say as another person who suffers from some pretty crippling anxiety, you got to step away from so much social media
a lot of anti-gay stuff latched onto that, and put forward how dangerous gay sex is because of a time of people not being able to get treated, and being uneducated, but nowadays there isn't any more actual risk for gay sex so long as you use protection
I'm not an expert on this, but from what I understand those STDs got spread a lot in the gay community in the 70s and 80s because there wasn't any sort of sex education for gay people, so most didn't realize that protection is still really important
that's super valid too, healthy relationships are honestly all about finding what works best for your case rather than trying to do the 'normal' things
it's just natural that you'd want to declare for the both of you that you're really committed to working with each other and loving each other for many more years
like, I know I'm getting married once I'm in a more stable position because, I've been with my SO for about 10 years
but also still just for the magic of it
I think marriage is still something great to do, for practical reasons like tax and boring paperwork things that declare you as a partner, and allowing easy asset sharing and hospital visitation purposes
not even touching
covid is easy spreadable by just touching people
the quarantine is necessary to *attempt* to put in place measures to make sure people won't just be homeless from being unable to work
because you have to
in the US, you absolutely would still be working or driving if you had corona
I don't get how you can claim he didn't know considering he spent the last 3 months on twitter downplaying the virus
that's kind of the reason for all these quarantine measures
this isn't a meme channel
you just keep upvoting each other saying random things
yall are honestly saying absolutely nothing sensible
it is extremely worrying to hear you talking about this anti-trump conspiracy stuff like this
the president is the one who uses orders to act
seriously, why do you saying 'they' and the others
what does he get? that doesn't say anything
if people are quarantined, they are not voting for the democratic primaries, they are not learning about their other candidates, and more people will vote for status quo
do you not get how this benefits him more than anything? how is still able to be spun into a conspiracy against him?
lack of concern to what exactly?
if you keep going on about this, you are not going to be welcome here, and you need to realize that whatever you did on those other servers is very wrong, and it's not going to be tolerated here either
I would like to add that, with how hard you want to talk about the other party as in the wrong, you don't seem to actually be moving on at all, and your dark meme was self-admitted to me as being transphobic
it's just bad feels all the way down
within trans communities you see even more pushback against it because the anime community has gone through these long periods of calling trans people traps as well, basically calling them just crossdressers, and still hitting with the malicious deceit angle
this is pretty plainly bad because when you bring this term into anything around real life, it feels bad to have your interests of self-expression be boiled down to tricking people
it originally started, as far as I know, as a word to use for popular anime boys who dress up like girls, because there was quite a bit of humor about people being 'tricked' into liking boys because they look so much like girls
for one, it's a pretty bad word on its own, because as you said it implies deceit, or something malicious
it's a two-front issue really
I don't want you to stop looking for alternate view points, just please be considerate when you do so if you want to ask us things
it's really healthy to acknowledge these things
along with that though, I'd like it if yall would slow down on dogpiling him so much
you need to adjust if you want to continue posting in this channel
I understand you're still finding yourself, and that being a teenager is hard, but you can't keep coming in here and mocking and dismissing people when you ask questions
I'd like to come in with my mod hat as well; this is a very bad trend you've been on <@!302063351767498752>
are medical studies not enough, or the incredible amount of trans people that you've already personally interacted with?
what do you even mean by you not having any objective data to back it up?
a show like Shield Hero that Melua brought up is a lot worse because of how strongly it celebrates it
showing rape in a show does not instantly taint the entire piece, and it's true that the show portrrays the goblins as the literal worse
personally, as someone who's been through that bad stuff (although it wasn't overly violent) I think that while your hate of GS is something understandable, your going way too far and not looking at the themes of the show
for one, you need to stop attacking people over this, wfc
so, time for me to get vulnerable I guess
wfc, you have to realize that you're hyperfocusing on one portion of a show that does have many more themes than just that, you can't go around blocking and swearing at multiple people over it
this whole confrontation you decided to have is completely awful, and I really suggest you step away and come back later at this point
blocking someone mid-conversation in <#336297840529899522> is really not good, wfc
so I'm going to put you in timeout for three days
okay, you're just going off about the show itself at this point and not really realizing at all that people are upset at you because you're generalizing everyone who watches the show to an outrageous degree
my point is that I would like you to see that people can look past shock value and fanservice and actually enjoy the fact that the show goes through with a lot of killing bad people, as a lot of action media do, and that means a heck of a lot more than fanservice scenes of rape, because there's a *lot* more irredeemable things in media that you are implicitly supporting as well
okay, so do you want to address any other parts of my messages?
what do you even mean by cherrypicking that?
at most, GS has fanservice rape, but *even if* someone enjoys it in some part as fanservice, that doesn't make them a trash person, and GS still has it's major message being to wipe out all of those awful goblins
I'm someone who is targeted to hate the show from the shock value alone, I can't get past that, but one of the core part of my healing is understanding that media portraying rape with shock value is nowhere near someone who is celebrating rape
it's a major point of the shock value, and that alone isn't enough to clearly see someone's morals from it, when they can clearly be one of the several people here who enjoy the show regardless of the shock value
yeah, they weren't banned, they just left
only you can make a decision on if they're otherwise a great friend, but that's a whole lot of alarm bells to me if someone is pushing *that* hard to get you to drop your boundaries out of guilt
acting like they're walking on eggshells because you told them you don't want a relationship is absurd, and they're just not listening to you saying no
tbh he sounds like a mega creep
I'm not really sure why you subject yourself to all that sort of hate tbh
that's really not a great place
and a quick search about this incident shows that this all happened over a month ago and has apparently been pretty disproven by even WRD mods https://old.reddit.com/r/TopMindsOfReddit/comments/fwjskj/watch_reddit_lie_part_ii_how_rwatchredditdie_has/
but AHS doesn't have a discord
well, the only evidence that the narrator even talks about is relating to them getting banned off the AHS discord, and a small snippet of discord DMs
because I have big doubts about its legitimacy considering the account and all those comments, and there isn't any actual evidence in that video
where did you get this video from, lectric?
you're really just coming off as being extremely insensitive at best by jumping straight to defending white businesses when this is only happening because of people feeling like there isn't any other option than to lash out in some way so they can be heard
Aria, attempting to make this into something about white persecution is really misguided here, it's absolutely not only white businesses that have been caught up in this
I feel like in a large city-wide riot with so many people with their own ideas of how to bring attention to this issue, it's more just inevitable that other buildings will be caught up in it more than anything
why does it annoy you so much to see a few extra rainbows for one month out of the year?
without being made aware of our issues, how can anyone from the LGBT+ umbrella hope to get equal rights?
why do you feel that way?
onigiri is being absurd, but keep it civil
don't bring up an old topic to throw insults in this channel
no??
if it's a troll account I don't want you sharing anything from it or giving them a platform
that person literally just loks like a troll account and you are falling for it really hard
in this channel especially, bringing up random users to mock does nothing but make everyone feel worse, when this spot in meant for us to have actual discussions
we are really not the best at telling you exactly what you should be doing or how to get better, but there are a lot of people here who would be incredibly sad to see you go
no, you don't
nobody wants you to go through with something like that
lectric, that's a really bad question and I really hope you know that would be a horrendous thing to do
thank you for apologizing, and I get that it can be hard to change your language when you've  grown up used to certain words, just please continue doing better
I really don't even get why I see a trans mod having to give an apology for pushing that trap is a slur
along with them seemingly being totally fractured to begin with, with them putting in their posts about how they don't all agree with banning the slur, like what the heck
like, if they go through with a ban on a slur like that, doing any of this service that implies they're going to go back on it is just absolutely horrendous and is going to make people protest longer
they have two stickies up right now trying to say they're listening, they're totalyl taking on the feedback and everything and deliberating but, why are they doing this over banning a slur
so like, I don't ever go to r/animemes to begin with, so I hadn't looked myself to see exactly what was happening until just now and like, why is their mod team so bad with this honestly
apparently they went private because the mod team was starting to get doxxed and swatted
I am not absolving you of wrongdoing, don't thank me yet
I would very much so recommend everyone to cool down
I am completely lost as to what yall have been going off about, but it seems like yall have been talking past each other a lot
Tamamo, what are you here to actually discuss?
okay, let me do a full stop real quick
and frankly, actual abuse is far more likely to have happened
that is scary, just as much as I'm scared of someone doing horrible things to me and then running off without consequence too
it's not like I'm able to constantly have a recorder running
we want you to see why people support social movement similar to metoo, because it's super extremely hard to prove anything beyond just words
the fact that you know of these cases at all makes it obvious
it can be abused, but luckily in those cases it seems like many high profile people are able to clear their names
and that is something I support, because I don't like to give support to people who have abused even a single person
a lot of popular cases people latch onto in social media get proven in social courts at most, because people end up making their own decisions
at least as far as I know, a vast majority of r*pe cases don't get proven in court, because they are very difficult to prove at all
I don't like that message because that makes it seem like people who have been less highprofile don't matter
I'm a victim myself, with absolutely no evidence, so this matter is very close to me
but that shouldn't be a reason to further doubt for women who legitamately have been assaulted or worse, when the very nature of those claims make it exceedingly hard to prove
there are obviously bad people who will use false accusations for their own gains, that is a constant no matter what
nazism is real, and people who flat-out don't believe women at all are real
if you want to continue pushing for equality, you really can't keep promoting those ideals
you seem to want to say that you believe in ideals the same or similar as those sayings promote, while at the same time using popular alt-right terminology
if you truly are someone who believes in equality ideals, none of your main talking points have promoted that
you opened this conversation bringing up cultural marxism, you have sent a very long message decrying things similar to the metoo movement, and you have downtalked black lives matter
so, I'm doing my best to catch up, and Tamamo there have been several very good reasons that people are getting upset at you, and I would like you to listen to at least some of their points
how do you think we could move towards it?
do you believe that the US could switch to Denmark's model overnight?
I'm not sure what point you're meaning to put forward now, Tamamo
Shemmy, please calm down, that's not helpful
a lot of prejudice stems from classism
to be fair, true equality is not possible without economic equality
if you want to have a discussion with us about equality, please remember some takeaways from this, most notably about the language you use
Tamamo, there are certain facts about that stance that I feel you're ignoring by choosing to take such a hardline stance
Shemmy pulled back when we warned her, if she continued I would have taken further action
Sub, that's very not helpful at the end of the discussion
one or two is a very small amount
and maybe once our awful parts of history have been fully repaid, we could see better utopian systems
equity systems that you have been talking down to are our steps to bring disenfranchised population up to everyone else's level
economic steps to become a utopia is not just about giving everybody the same chance though, some people need more help than others, and some people have enough personal resources that they don't need that help
and it's the same thing for you GMK, because I would miss seeing your regular posts in <#357682999300718592>
Cocoa, you're honestly just a really good example of why I never want to ban people unless it's something super extremely egregious, because I would have missed out on seeing you be such a good member of this community now
we really do just want everyone to be happy here
and really, you don't have to feel like we're going to suddenly blast you from the server if that's one of your big worries, at least well, I'd like to think we don't ban people often at all, our ban list is very short, and you've been a very valid member of this community
I'm very bad at social interactions myself, and I find it hard to connect to a lot of people on non-symphogear interests here too, but at least I feel like a lot of people seem to appreciate thinking about the battle interactions you put up often
I'm incredibly sorry that you feel that way, it's not our intention at all to make you feel so uncomfortable, we want everyone to feel like they can belong here
if you want to share contentious news here, don't do it by purposefully wanting to make certain people mad
<@!379633671897874433> your message with it, "is meant for some butt hurt left wingers", seems pretty intentionally inflammatory, please don't do that again
it's just some bad people platforming other bad people to be waaay higher than they otherwise were
I hate how those types of articles get highlighted so much
yeah, it's Trump being unable to stop talking over both Biden and the Moderator
nothing but constant interruptions
this is horrible
<:ShirabeEmbarassed:336657288477671436>
oh, wait, they just left
<@!86725700991590400> I've seen you in this channel with takes similar to this for a long time now, and you haven't been participating in this server otherwise. with you literally calling for the enslavement of America and civil war, I don't think you're a good fit for this server anymore, so you're being kicked for now
as someone who relies on the system to live, I would very much so like it to continue so that I don't have to worry about being immediately homeless as trump continues cutting social services and propagating hate
honestly, that's just very easy to say when you're not the ones directly affected
voting blue no matter who *right now* indicates that we don't want a fascist as president
voting for future progressive ideals is not something to play with in the presidential race, the only way to get those ideals in the white house is by starting locally and continuing to raise awareness
if you don't know of their existence on Twitter, then nothing is happening to you anyways
seriously, what's even the point of trying to get people *to* block them?
you can talk again tomorrow when you're cooled down
so I'm muting you now since you didn't back down
no, posting a callout with their handle is far more than just telling people to mute them, you are inviting harassment to them
if you're so worked up by this, take your energy elsewhere, I'm not supporting you harassing a minor that has literally gotten so little attention that you are only making the problem worse
if you keep trying to justify this I'm going to mute you
if that's what you want to tell yourself, sure, I'm certain people are quacking worrying about a kid's tweet that got less than ten likes
<@!476058996315389953> don't try to sick this server on someone again
and Kaiyo, I really don't get what you were trying to do by targeting people and trying to get a rise out of this situation too
you're really not helping anything by trying to attack some kid that does not have a lot of attention, don't try to kid yourself into thinking you're doing some good service
and urging you all to put a lid on this
I'm deleting that callout post
I really really recommend to keep talking with your therapists or other professionals though, because we really can't help you nearly as well as they can
I'll say as well, I understand a bit how annoying it can be to hear people constantly say that there's always a light, that everything will get solved and perfected with time. because it is, most other people just can't understand how extremely difficult you have it. I don't fully understand your situation, but I'm a victim too, although it sounds like you've had it a lot harder than me, I'm kind of just mentioning that to sort of try and relate to you that you're not alone. and that even though it is difficult, and there are things that are flat out harder or impossible for you, that doesn't mean you can't find happiness. it's going to be different from other people, but the only way you'll ever find your own happiness is to never give up
thank goodness

https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1346954970910707712
a reason for pushing impeachment again could be to try to insure trump can't run again in 2024
KomodoHype is a good replacement anyways
I'm so happy I didn't have to see much of the people in those replies today in the corner of Twitch that I watch
yeah, mental abuse is still abuse, I'm sorry you're having to deal with that
it's hard to make out much from these recordings, is your mom abusing you or having some sort of breakdown in private about something?
so both of you take it out of here please
it's true, saying lmao to people here, being dismissive, and making assumptions is bad
and if you have a beef with Armis going on, it'd be best if you would take it to DMs
please don't assume things and take jabs at someone like that, you did come in with some hostile energy circles
I'm not sure if there's been a more up-to-date study, but there was a study a couple years back that large shipping vessels account for an absolutely massive amount of carbon emissions
this seems really really good for shipping, just about anything to cut down on fuel use for freighters would be good though
> The 20sq m kite attached to a generator was able to produce tens of kilowatts, he says , but a big kite of several hundred square metres might be able to deliver about a megawatt of electricity.
Noi, your own article says >cruising speed of 15 knots for that ship
<#336297840529899522> isn't for spam or one-liners without discussion, don't do it again please
why'd you find it funny?
<@!100162379161022464> why this again?
at the same time, the conversation yall had is really hard to follow, but, I think it's weird how there was so much vague defense about a vague person vaguely liking a hentai for unknown reasons
please never do this again. I'm not entirely sure what you feel like this accomplishes, but you posted "ok literature student" twice in this conversation, and then post this, which I can only assume is you trying to bully people out of the conversation. don't do this again, this is a discussion channel for everyone, not just those you deem worthy
apologies for being late to this whole thing
it feels like yall could have been more to the point by just focusing on the fact that it's okay to have kinks, but Redo is brought up as a scary show because of how it's being put in the spotlight for normalizing r*pe
and personally, I find using bot commands dramatically more inconvenient than just right-clicking someone
<:TsubasaPeek:623246193002151938> also, giving someone perms to mute through a bot also means giving thema proper role order anyways, since you give the perms to a role
<@!318271286184771587> if you're overwhelmed and not sure how to speak, can you at least answer; why do you feel that gay male relationships are abusive enough that "it depends"?
<@!318271286184771587> please speak to us here before participating in <#357682999300718592> , I would really like you to answer
if you want a fresh start here, I'm okay with that, so long as you can explain what you mean by that, because this is a very gay friendly space
Cecil, the issue is that you're not explaining what you mean when you say you hate yaoi, and also gay men, because at face value that's pretty bad
<@!318271286184771587> "Basically I made an opinion that i hate yaoi in general, and for irl relationships... it depends"
this is confusing because I have little idea about the context of all this and why you're bringing it up. saying "it depends" for if you like gay relationships is not nice. I don't want to see this brushed off, and attempting to hide behind the opinion that yaoi can have problematic media doesn't work when you say "it depends" for real gay men. why do you feel that gay male relationships are abusive enough to warrant that comment? it'd be nice if you would explain this rather than just saying "thanks about the feedback"
I'm pretty alright with you participating here I think so long as you can agree to be okay with what you end up seeing here
I get it, it's okay
so Cecil, I need you to address then, do you realize how it's unfair to judge gay men like that? because people got mad at you it seems because you let a few bits of fanart taint your idea of a whole sexuality
I would really like to ask of you then that you work on overcoming your bias. I understand a different cultural background makes that hard, but having this strong reaction against yaoi while still liking yuri is really problematic. the same touching of butts that guys can do, other people also do, so it seems pretty wrong for you to single out gay men like that
well, okay, that's definitely some bad internalized homophobia then you know. how do you section that away from your liking of yuri?
so, if I got this right, you saw a gif on tumblr some time ago of two guys rubbing butts, and it seems like you don't have much contact with gay men otherwise, so that's tainted gay men for you?
but, you're a big symphogear fan, and going by your twitter you seem to like yuri
yeah, it sounds like you're describing hating people who do consensual acts with each other, just because their gay men
well, I guess then I'm confused why you're singling out gay men for this
okay, then yeah, going to have to say that's definitely why people are mad at you Cecil, because that's something men and women do a lot too
just to clarify, you mean images of people consensually rubbing butts? or actually people not liking rubbing butts with each other?
being aroace explains a lot too, I can get that
because the point of why peple got mad at you is because, as Kanade said, a lot of your issues apply to any sexuality
I hope your stay here can help you broaden your horizons a bit honestly, you're not going to get people sending you death threats or whatever here, and it seems like you just don't have a lot of exposure to a lot of gay stuff
because there's a lot of gay stuff here, you're probably going to se gay girls and gay men if you look in the art channels especially
yall, a few hours ago that got obviously too heated, and we apologize for not stepping in sooner. drilling people with personal attacks isn't how you're supposed to conduct yourselves in this channel. attempting to say people want more civilian deaths is just, well, pretty rude. it is easy for us to armchair general this situation when we're not living it, and from what I've been reading, it feels like yall have been using the discussion of the last few days to vent frustrations at each other over governmental actions. I would like to kindly ask yall to stop doing that, and remind everyone that the people here aren't the ones ordering strikes. I believe that goes for people arguing from both perspectives. I have not seen even a glimpse of support for Hamas here, and most importantly I don't see any support for more deaths. Lankpants in particular is being barred from this channel for the next two weeks for making this more hostile. for yall affected by this, please just stay safe and take a break from this channel when you need it
alright then, for you as well, just let me know if you want access back before the two weeks
okay, we'll do the same two weeks then. let me know if you want it lifted sooner
that is not a good looking sponge
so, I'm also just going to ask yall both to cool off, and please don't do that again. sudden personal insults are absolutely not okay in this channel
okay, so reading back, I don't even get why either of you suddenly came at each other, unless there's a deleted message I'm not seeing
I need to backread to see why yall are upset, please remember to be civil
don't do this again please, dismissive statements like this in the middle of a discussion doesn't do anything but make people upset
they only post in other channels on the same day that they post in this channel, with sometimes months in-between
even my family uses it that way still
in the american south at least, I absolutely hear it as a slur still
I hate a lot how it's considered so normal now for everyone to call me a slur
you're not the only one, I wish I didn't have to be marketed at with a slur too
probably the most offensive thing I've seen get a show in recent memory, and it's made by a bunch of lgbt+ people, so that's nice
that's fair, it's not the exact same
like, the root definition is bad, so it's bad to call someone that
and to me, this is weird to want to call yourself, in the same way that it's a slur to call someone a "trap"

when I search the definition of the word, I get this
it has to be a regional thing
I'll say that I don't really mind if you identify as that, but I don't fully understand it. why do yall want to identify as the slur form of 'weird'?
which is just a mash of horrendous cariacatures and slurs that straight people are going to see as a something cool to joke about
and it ends up getting so normalized that now we have a show like Q-Force coming out that's supposed to be representation for us
but it's not realy much different than the gg word to me
like, objectively sure, call yourself whatever you want
personally, I don't even really like it being so normal to call ourselves the q word either
also Gwyn doesn't use he
the name of the show is Q-Force
they're saying the Q word is at least better than the F
if it becomes super widely accepted that a slur is now only good things, sure, but when I hear straight people call me the q word, it's way way too recent to me that I get called that word as an insult, by random southerners and family members. so it's just not going to be a reclaimed slur to me
it's good for you though if it works
it doesn't give me any feelings of power to call myself slurs, so I can't understand that
I see too many people go along the lines of "if they can say it, why can't I?" to ever be personally comfortable reclaiming a slur
but also yall don't need to swarm the chat like this to yell at Matt too, the argument didn't resume, it's okay and having several people yell at him is bad too
when someone is being homophobic, we're not going to let them continue, just as Melua did. you don't need to worry about throwing in your opinion several hours later
it's already been repeated enough, Melua already ended the conversation, you really shouldn't just restart an old conversation like that, Matt
hmm

welcome back friend <:Zababies:672238628398956594>
EVGA has been replacing people's cards for free though thankfully
occasionally this would instantly kill a card when it demands the power to lift off inside someones case
in order to handle it, the card messed up its request for more cooling, and wanted the fans to ramp up to 200,000 RPM
so people found out that it was actually just New World exposing a flaw with how EVGA cards regulate their fans under heavy load
New World doesn't have an FPS cap by default, or at least it didn't in beta, and the vast majority of gpu deaths were reported to be EVGA 3090s
there's a kind of funny reason behind the gpu deaths that isn't entirely Amazon's fault
Vyn, you've been a problem user in this channel for a while and we've had to tell you to cool down multiple times before. you get unreasonably upset with people here, and that's not right
just to be clear, because this isn't the first time that you have gone after someone in this channel, this is a final straw. you will be ejected from this server if you do this again, Vyn
honestly, that was a poor decision Vyn
but Vyn, you are really worse here by trying to attack Matt for not being okay with slurs
Matt, you came in really really strong, please don't do that
but, Vyn, seriously what are you saying? Matt points out the old bad behavior those creators had, and you choose to say that Matt just couldn't handle it back then, never saying that you think that behavior was bad
would like it if yall would stop going at each other for a moment
I never go outside, so I never got vaxxed. maybe that was dumb
that's rough
no, not as far as I know
but my head has never hurt this much before
I'm not having any trouble breathing thankfully, so I'll probably be okay
symptomatic
thanks
this really sucks
I think I caught covid <:MikuWorry:672908523495227432>
I really want to make sure personally that you realize how bad it is to be saying this. I was the one that banned you first, and rejected you the first time you wanted back in. Yelling about that specifically makes me pretty disappointed, and you need to move on and realize how lucky you are that you, as a banned stranger, were even trusted enough to have this chance. Don't squander it after people have now gotten to know you
It's persistent too, so you don't lose anything by containing tabs
Yeah, that's what I use it for, it lets me be logged in to different emails without doing the whole signing out and in
Firefox has tab containers which might do what you're wanting. It lets you open tabs under, for example, a "work" container that then forces cookies and trackers to only be contained within "work" and doesn't let "work" touch the rest of your browsing
please cool down and realize that you need to just stop typing whenever you find yourself getting worked up over a repost, it will happen and continue to happen, especially on a character birthday
that's pretty unacceptable, and you've been unable to handle this yourself and just step away from the keyboard, so I'm going to time you out until the morning
and scrolling back through, I notice that your hangups have taken up a massive portion of today's birthday posting, with a couple instances of going way too hard on other users
you're a great person and all, but this incredible need to be the first to share things in the art channel has been a very persistent problem, it's not just today
where does the back of that castle begin? what's up with the courtyard?
that painting in particular, you can see a couple things that stand out that are pretty weird beyond face value
iirc, he flunked out too because his art only stayed "good" while continuing to make some critical errors, if you look at it especially critically
like come on
they unironically said alt left
if they want to play the game, they need to realize that people are going to be upset, especially if they're suuuuch allies
sorry but like, it's just some twitch comments
while going on about how much they're suuuch allies, they've lost soooo mayn subscribers
one of them goes on about, oh, you know, some gay people say hey it's okay to play, other people say we can't, it's just so hard to tell what's right, you know?
they sound honestly just awful, they keep repeating basic stuff about just wanting to play the video game, of course people are going to be upset about that kind of flimsy defense
immense anger detected...?

so, these people are seriously who everyone is saying trans people have harassed so aggressively?
it's absurd that they feel like they should have *no* criticism because of that donation
this is what kills me when listening to them. I do actually think it's commendable for them to try balancing it out like this for their conscience, but
they just pout about how their chat is being mean and making it hard to enjoy the game
I just listened to four minutes of them around the timestamp that JRider mentioned
1:04:22
<:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
sharing stuff you make is super encouraged here, if it's not Symphogear though then sharing it in <#458060276550336522> is where you'll want to put it
<:TsubasaPeek:623246193002151938>
so cool!
ooh, I'll have to watch it some time then
I have no idea what that other anime is but I agree with you <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
it's hard to talk about gay bears because of how important it is to expereince how the story reveals things
it's all shrouded in weird visuals, and some crazy stuff happens, but people are definitely being eaten
well... sort of
it's sooo good to watch through, I highly recommend it
the bears are super gay, and it's all big metaphors about being weird by actually being gay outside of the class
oh, yeah, sort of, sorry I didn't catch what you meant by literally
it's a commentary on yuri bait and s-class yuri
it's not yuri bait at all
I loved that anime!
ooh, are we talking about yuri kuma arashi?
I still haven't gotten around to watching those animes either <:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
very good gay
that's a really loaded term that isn't very nice to use here
you've kind of taken over the channel for a while with this bit
would yall mind moving this over to <#407060923078017026> ?
<:TriplePeek:689568598938615939>
<@!202536957685923841> please don't use retarded in that manner
but, I never finished watching it
it's basically just porn lol
Yurikuma has a lot of commentary on things like 'Class-S' yuri-but-not-really, so you'd probably enjoy the ride
so, it's kind of wild and hard to follow at times, but it's really good!
one of the main things that director does, and Yurikuma leans so hard into it, is artsy stuff that's all about commentary on modern trends
I think with how much you talk about hating generic subtext stuff Allison, you'd really really enjoy gay bears actually
watch Yurikuma Arashi!
I mean, at this point it's not worth going back and editing, the last hour or more has been a batch of spoilers, I just didn't notice yall popping off <:MikuWorry:672908523495227432>
remember this channel is meant for other animes, and there's a lot of spoilers in this discussion
could yall please move this over to <#336310266654490624>
no, it's no worries
isn't that kind of the same thing though, Cypher?
like, I like gay stuff generally more often because it's underrepresented, so it's more interesting, and I'm pretty gay so it resonates with me more
personally, I haven't seen Promare yet so I can't comment on that, but I don't think there's anything wrong with saying that something is better for them because it's gayer
yeah
Yoshika isn't really worst worst ||outside of the endings|| I just loved watching Hikari's struggle to be good, rather than Yoshika being great by default
they're super cute
my favs in strike witches were Sanya and Eila too
<:HibikiSmug:672655850518609940>
luminous witches seems kind of strange
ooh, hopefully that'll be neat
I heard brave witches is getting their own version of the gag anime thing, are they mashing the two squads together?
I prefer it over original almost entirely because it has such a better protag
brave witches is great!
||I kind of think it's a shame honestly that newer witch material has been trying to move away from that aesthetic and has several witches now that actually just wear full uniform pants, it makes it feel more uncomfortable||
||exactly!||
||it's not just military people, they show civilians wearing no pants too when they visit a city at one point||
yeah <@!274279989506211841> that's straight up sex, this is still a <#336297674707828747> channel
~~I'll choose not to click on that spoiler~~
lol, that's a good recommendation then
I get a little bored tbh watching SoL anime sometimes, so I'm pretty behind on watching stuff like adashima, need to catch up
lol
thicc thighs save lives
I haven't watched Assault Lily yet, although I'm a little excited to do so later with how much yall have been saying how gay it is
yeah, there's some stories I've passed over because of yuri being just a fanservice moment rather than actual romance
you worried me when you opened with ```And that's when I came to the sad and painful realization that 
This show will have A SHIT TON of yuri```
okay, maybe I'm judging too harsh and assuming things, I'm sorry if so
well no, they said `Yes
Exactly
I still say I'm not a fan of yuri`
advertising how you don't like gay stuff here is a little worrying
that's a really weird take tbh p-90
it's not in-spite of the yuri, the yuri is major reason why that even works
yeah but, the core values of the show, about connecting to one another and reaching out to others, is only ever amplified by the super close bonds the girls have with each other
and what do you mean you're not a fan of yuri? how did you enjoy symphogear at all?
I'm so confused, how would you not expect the finale to be gay hibimiku considering shemha?
Show By Rock is a good anime
the rest of any lewd topics are more about implications than anything too far on screen
to be real, the OP is really lewd, but it's easily the most blatantly lewd thing in the show, by far
I'm pure, I swear <:TsubasaPeek:623246193002151938>
like, the entire point of the plot is about how gay it is
it's really gay
it's a really good commentary on lots of extremly common and fairly problematic tropes that yuri anime used to do a lot, just like Flip Flappers touched on in a few of its episodes
very gay bears, lots of all over the place symbolism stuff
it got kind of lost in the sea, but Yuri Kuma Arashi is also a really good recommendation if you're looking for something similar to Flip Flappers
*symbolism*
it's mostly just fun subtext for the first two seasons though, and it also depends on how much of a deal breaker the presence of men with potential subtext is to you because there's several boy bands in it
if you want more gay musical anime, then one I've recently liked a lot is Show By Rock
although I also more highly recommend symphogear <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
princess principal is really amazing
excited
really wasn't expecting so much progression in what looked at first like a regular slice-of-life gag anime
actually so enjoyable
I watched through Machikado recently
I don't think it really matters all that much even if you like the loli stuff in the show, it only becomes a problem when people make it a defining trait and start creeping people out, or creeping on if you go way too far
honestly, yeah
having Symphogear's sexual abuse survivor being assaulted again is legitimately an awful decision
I think people are mostly upset that they chose the absolute worst way to crossover with the memoria art
it would be nice if both sides of this kerfuffle could stay civil and not so snarky
but it's also not really wrong to dislike it, there's a lot of valid reasons to be uncomfortable
enjoying whatever you like is fine, good people can like some questionable things, and the anime this server is for isn't exactly perfect anyways
I didn't watch much anime during that downtime, and it seems like so much effort to move over my list for a bit of a different interface, but all the cool kids are using it :v
<:TsubasaNote:689554460044820608> this makes me feel like a bit of a boomer
just curious, what's the reason for everyone using Anilist nowadays instead of MAL?
I basically never watch more than like, two episodes of a single anime, so setting that up and using an external program, especially as a background service is a little wild to me
that makes sense why it's convenient for you if you watch a ton of anime
then why not just open MAL/Anilist instead?
<:HibikiThink:688429715362414641> that seems a bit much to me to have a program running just to update an anime list
what's Taiga?
hmmm
does Anilist do the thing where it notifies you when sequels or related are coming out soon for anime you've watched?
that does make it a lot more tempting to switch over then
that's a bit too lewd for a sfw channel
kind of sucks they take so long to make, but they're definitely worth it
the films are great too, they're basically just longer episodes
literally 10/10, contender for favorite anime ever
it's super super good
it's equally as gay as Symphogear imo
what is SJW or woke to you?
It's shocking enough that they have so much content with the fan base they have now, it feels so smol
I hope Luminous does well enough through the rest of the season, it would be neat if it gets more fans
Hm, true, maybe it is that simple
And if you become a fan from Luminous, then would you like the super different tone of the other seasons?
True, you don't need to, but I feel like if you didn't, then you're likely to not care so much about Luminous
Even if pants and familiars are weird
The bit of talk I've seen from old fans is mostly super negative, even though it's a fun show, and that worries me because I actually love what they're doing with it
But, that's what confuses me about Luminous Witches. Are they changing tone so far away from fan service in order to get new fans? If so, why do they still have so many plot lines that seem to only hit well because the viewer is assumed to know why it's special to see such and such making an appearance
Having no random scenes of witches annoying each other by groping each other is a big plus
I would have liked them to continue the no pants tbh, I really like that aesthetic of Witches, but I do appreciate how there isn't any weirder fan service stuff happening
So all these new mechanics feel even more out of place, even though they're finding fun ways of using them
But that's where it gets weirder, it actually takes place concurrently with season 1!
It would have been nice to have more episodes of that
I'm a big fan of Brave Witches tbh, I liked how they tried to focus attention more on a few characters instead of the big group, but it definitely meant that there were several people who barely had a personality
It's just so weird! Like, they had a sauna scene, and they were fully clothed!
I'm loving these weird callbacks they're doing
I caught up on the anime this week and the last couple episodes have really blown me away tbh
I find that very silly
Like, it's gotten rid of a lot of major Witches identity stuff, like no pants, but at the same time, it loves offering a look at witches who just kind of suck at being witches
Because I'm still struggling to understand who the anime is for tbh, even though it's been a kind of fun different look
If you do wind up watching Luminous, I'd actually be pretty interested in your perspective on it as someone who hasn't seen the rest
Have you seen any other Witches stuff?
Yeah
It's been a really surprising hit for me
Anyone watching Luminous Witches?
<:TsubasaNote:689554460044820608> guess I got to watch through Adventure Time at some point
the only western cartoons that I know of that make it explicit on screen that a main lady is in love with another lady are Steven Universe, Owl House and She-Ra. I'd be interested to know what others there are that are so explicit, I'd like to watch them
it was only in the last season of Korra that hints started being dropped, and it was lots of little things, like Asami ||being the one that Korra relies on more while recovering her.. everything||
no, I don't really remember any act being close to that great line
Korra is a really neat show, but it's so hard to rewatch because of how hard they drag the show down
absolutely
helps that there's five seasons of it, rather than the mess that was Korra's romance plots
Symphogear is on a much more gay level imo
but it was there, and it was very neat for the time
and the lead up to that scene was far more sub sub texty too honestly, you had to look for it
that's all, but yes, it's way more explicit in the comics
Asami accepts Korra's invitation to explore the ||spirit world|| with her, and they hold hands while looking at each other
Korra was definitely one of the biggest earliest non-straight characters in western animation, but, smol correction that it wasn't explicit like that on screen at all
My look at it personally was that I enjoyed the introspective thoughts it made both of them keep having though as they had to deal with her weirdness, and early interruptions
I totally get why you feel that way
The slow build up makes it hit really hard
Book 6 or so is when it just exploded to me, so, it does get better imo
But that's not so bad to me, it's just another angle for some other cute exploration later
The alien is weird, it seems to totally be there just to talk about fate
That's a little weird if it rushes too much, but, the novels are super slow so maybe that's just inevitable
Is it really? I haven't watched through that yet
It didn't hit me until about halfway through the novels, but since, I can't get over how incredibly fluffy it is to read
I love Adachi and Shimamura
Hino is neat and interesting, but Nagafuji's character is just a bit too out of it all for me to be into them I think
They get a lot of development later on at least, I just wasn't a huge fan of them <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
The sci-fi elements weren't necessary for sure, the alien aspect of her is so strange
Hino and Nagafuji were the ones I didn't really like a whole lot in comparison actually, because it felt like they didn't change much
I think it's important to set up all the bad sides of their personalities
I haven't finished it yet
at least I think it's nice, so far
Lycoris Recoil is on there too and nice if you want more plot
Bocchi is on there
beeg fan of her too
very high quality slice of life
dragon maid pretty good
also of course, watch Symphogear, might not have heard of that one
new Gundam, Witch from Mercury is pretty good
would have actually loved to see someone livepost that
aww dang, they don't have Yurikuma
also, some nice simple gays, like Mysteria Friends, and Ms. Vampire who lives in my neighborhood
the only boomer anime I know of is real basic stuff, but, they do seem to have most of the popular old things at least
they don't have Machikado, PriPri, or Show by Rock, which would be my other big ones
surprised at what's missing tbh <:MikuWorry:672908523495227432>
What MPV let's you do that I like a lot personally is let you use your own upscalers, or really your own anything, since it's all open
MPV will make video look marginally better and play smoother if you take the bit of extra time to follow a guide setting it up
GPUs are actually pretty great at decoding video, but VLC specifically sucks at it because it self contains its own codecs for compatibility
If you ever want to minmax you're viewing experience, this is why nerds will say VLC is bad
VLC is fine and you'll probably never want anything else, but
It's been so long since I set up MPV, I wonder if there's any fancier AI upscalers now
Yeah, if you can find a plugin at least, anything is possible
In that case, you probably aren't going to get much benefit from MPV
But that likely doesn't happen on a desktop, so you need to do it manually for the best quality
If you were watching content on a TV, with an app, that isn't so much a problem because your TV would be upscaling
With anime especially, VLC or a raw file being blown up just looks a tiny bit blurry, especially if you're at a weird resolution like 1440p
woa, Adashima is ending?
Witch From Mercury episode 10
it is!
and all the characters were so cool, rather than just one or two gays being my favorite
it's so easily a contender for my favorite idol anime, it got so unexpectedly dramatic
I watched through Zombieland Saga over the last couple months, and enjoyed it a ton, I should have watched it sooner
<:MikuBliss:336657233712513024>
I listen to One More Time pretty often
Discovery is a serious banger
that's better, but sorry, I should have been more clear. the reason these interjections are so rude is not just because you're failing to elaborate your point, but also because you're ignoring the other person. like when Melua shares her opinion that she likes a song, and your response is to say ">green text *this is better*", you're just dismissing her view and using it to launch into your own, as though her opinion is bad and means nothing to you. if you want to share your favorites too, try to just be nicer about it first, and try not to point at other things as better just because they're from IPs you like
Fede, your last few messages are just saying that other songs are better than what was shared here. rather than participating in a discussion, that just puts down other people's tastes, without even saying why those other songs are better to you
please don't backseat mod so rudely in the future, Wolfsbane
it's tame enough that it's dubious if it even needs to be gated at all by spoilers or otherwise since the song's title is clear enough while using tame language
the lewdest word I can hear is "erection", that's really not porn
I've only played it for a little bit so far, but I'm trying my best to make everything I can Symphogear related
Humble Bundle has this gem in the Bob Ross bundle
👌
since I just started playing though, my team isn't anything special yet
my ID is 48892 if anyone wants to add me
so, I started playing Girls Frontline yesterday, and it's really hooking me in
I just finished the emergency version of 2-2
I'm having this conundrum because I just ran out of resources lol
she's my highest leveled at the moment
and just bring BAR out for something really hard
I suppose maybe I should treat MGs like battleships in Kancolle then
Girls' Frontline
and now I'm falling for the M14, and she feels like she does just as much damage for way cheaper
I love the BAR, but she's so expensive to use
I'm really confused as to what MGs are good for
are shotguns not in english GFL yet?
just 16 attempts so far though
I've been doing emergency 1-4 a fair bunch too, just because I really want the G17
true
I should probably do that more
but I haven't been paying enough attention to logistics
I do the same, trying my best to S-rank every mission as I unlock it
I'm still a long way away from getting my raifu icon
SV-98 looks so good
that's incredible
<:ChrisSmile:336656717553074176>
yeah, trying to play HotS free-to-play seemed challenging
I think the most I ever played was HotS for the Genji skin last year
I tried playing LoL a long time ago, but I couldn't ever get into MOBAs
it's fine <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
I haven't ever blocked anyone on Tumblr
oh, well I assure you it wasn't me
<:HibikiWhat:336656482907193344>
you didn't bother me at all
what the heck are they doing
that's like, an actual sexual assault game that just has floating black bars, but it's 3D and realistic so I guess that's okay for Steam
so I looked it up, and how is House Party in particular not already affected by this policy?
it's pretty obvious that it's an issue with that style if they're going to take down VNs without lewd scenes, but leave up other games like Witcher 3
I think I'd like to avoid Steam too if they go through with all this, especially for anime stuff
that's really awful
they just came out with a remastered version today too
it's the same way, though they haven't been hit yet
that makes me worried for Highway Blossoms
I'm pretty sure Nekopara doesn't even have nudity unless you patch it in too
what the double heck
what the heck
lol, I was thinking of Witcher 3 when I asked that
Kindred Spirits is pretty tame too I thought
that's so weird
so, I haven't really looked into this policy change much at all, is this only affecting VNs or is it going further?
I need to look up if that's being pulled
I only own a few VNs, and Highway Blossoms is actually the only one with any lewd in it that I have
I didn't realize the policy change was going that far
yeah, at least it's still available elsewhere, but that really sucks
woah, what, Kindred Spirits is being pulled from Steam?
Jackie, Foo, Lara, Bree, and Alcina all look pretty cute, but holy moly, that spider girl is even more spider than I thought she was <:HibikiShock:336656371611074580>
the others do look cute
like, that picture of the spider girl in Mutiny is way too spider for me
I just have a problem
yeah, I've heard lots of good things about Monster Girl Quest
and that just totally ruins it for me
regardless of the shota, it seems like a lot of things that have monster girls have to include bug girls too
see, that's a big problem I run into with monster girl stuff
hmm... that looks pretty neat, but I don't know about those spider and moth girls
you might be feeling the extra frames, rather than seeing them. some games can have noticeable input lag if you don't get a ton of extra frames
just because those characters are incredible
Vesperia and Xillia have a ton of exposition and worldbuilding, but I've played through Vesperia literally like 6 times and watched it all every time
so I guess a good cast is the most important part for me
hmm... I don't think I'm scared of loads of worldbuilding, but I do have a hard time sitting through stories if i don't really enjoy the characters
would you recommend TitS to someone who has only ever completed Tales of Vesperia and Xillia as far as JRPGs go?
I do
named her Hibiki
I really enjoyed playing a monk last time I messed around
that could be pretty fun
Stardew Valley wasn't nearly as relaxing to me just because the day timers stressed me out
but every now and then I pick it up for a little while and just click around and collect shiny things
I've never gotten past the second town, mostly because my friends stopped playing
Diablo 3 is maximum chill
that's amazing
lol
<:HibikiWhat:336656482907193344>
lol, that too
main quest is easily the worst part of Skyrim imo
that might be good thing
when Nights of Azure came out on PC, I insta-bought it, and still haven't finished it...
I just have as really hard time finishing games
I'll see about picking it up sometime, but I have a horrible backlog too
I've been holding out hopes for a PC version that includes the PS3 stuff
seriously!
honestly in Xillia, Jude got kind of overshadowed by Milla and Alvin to me
true!
thighs <:MikuBliss:336657233712513024>
I've been playing this way too much honestly
if you'd like to add me, my ID is 48892
I got her! <:MikuBliss:336657233712513024>

rip <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
absolutely incredible
yeah, I saw that
<:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
I don't really like Thompson <:HibikiTired:422925410490253313>
I've gotten 3 416s and 3 Thompsons this week
my 5* luck has been good, but not towards what I want
<:MikuBliss:336657233712513024>
I believe in Grizzly <:HibikiEager:407398049531559937>
golly
what's the drop rate for these special guns?
I've now ran Emergency 1-4 80 times, and I still don't have G17
I am so happy that Nier Automata ran well on my system
Bayonetta is pretty neat looking
my SO has been really wanting it for a long time, but we're also not really into other Nintendo things, so I've just never been able to justify buying a whole console for it
Splatoon is probably the game that I've been wanting to play the most
there's been some pretty neat exclusives this generation that I've missed on
they came out with those 4k console versions so recently though it feels like
I'd totally be down for playing some BF4 with you though if you want
last consoles I had were the 360's generation
PC
I've been playing BF4 a bit recently from the BF5 hype
it's kind of both
does Battlefield 4 count?
they knew exactly how effective pink Mercy was going to be
Overwatch's waifu/husbando game is on point
I got even more of her from my rolls so far, so I've been using her more
Thompson seems pretty good, but maybe a bit specialized
I prefer 97, but 95 is also really good
I really wish I could get them
the new ARs are so extra cute
goodnight! <:HibikiTired:422925410490253313> <:HibikiTired:422925410490253313>
night! <:HibikiTired:422925410490253313>
Lily White and a lot of variations were already taken
found you, I'm Mikugeah
nice <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
that's pretty rad
Nier Automata has got to be one of the best games I've ever played
I'd be so sad if I never got to expereince that amazing game
it was fun though!
I need to draw something with those
I just saw those wedding Hibiki and Miku pics in XDU
I think that's my last round though
very
that was much more of a stomp
👌
we had all the caps at one point
yeah, that was pretty back-and-forth
a lot
I'm dying like
nice
hopefully it works right this time
sure
Penguin op
also, apparently it put you on the other team
I bound c to prone
I think you can hold control to prone by default
I definitely recommend that if you can
yeah, these squad menus are pretty buggy
outside of two days ago, it was two years since I've played
oh, same honestly
👌
I can listen if you want to speak, but I'd prefer not to speak
I'm ready to play BF4 now though whenever you are <@!102691114762371072>
100 contracts later, still no Type 97 <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
chapter 5 and 6 logistics are pretty good though for at least overnight resources
so long as you're having fun with it, there isn't really any need to rush things
I sat around there for a little while too
I was using my 1-4 grind to farm enhancements, but now I need to build up to try farming M249
mine is up to mid 40s, but I still need to do a lot of enhancements for them to raise their stats
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
it's so hard to tell who on my friends list is an actual good night team
that is actually good to know <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
and even though my main team has twice as much effectiveness, the dedicated team has been doing just as good team
I've been going through them recently too, and I tried just putting night equipment on my main team, and have a night team to back them up
it feels like pretty much a requirement to train a dedicated night team for them
night missions are tough!

<:MikuBliss:336657233712513024>
nice! <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
the others I like to use either as night squads or just backup
this is the only logistics team I have
so for now, BAR is in a night team for me
I would make a MG team if I could find any other MGs that I actually like
BAR being stuck in logistics <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
lol
although I haven't spent anything
9th? I only just unlocked my 6th echelon
eyepatches are too much my jam
I think I'm going to keep Skorpion on my team 2 until I'm absolutely forced to replace her
it was with a very heavy heart when I moved F2000 to a logistics team out of team 2 today to be replaced by G36
there's part of me that wants to get the extra dorms just to give my other teams a home, even if it is still just filled with cardboard boxes
very true
it's good to show your other guns that you care!
every day when I go around giving likes for the event, I see her
yes <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
she's stolen my heart <:MikuGay:336656810788388864>
M14
I really liked using the TAR in Vegas 2
also yes
TAR, but NTW is also pretty good
she's a very nice gun
the BAR is a favorite just because I love the actual gun for some odd reason, and when I saw her and that she was voice by Hibiki, that's what got me to try the game
yep <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
OTs-12 and of course BAR are very close runner ups
I have a lot of boxes that can be checked tbh
her voice is very pleasant to listen to too
twintails that change color, shining face, thighhighs, and a really neat exposed shoulders jacket is all super nice
M14 is almost certain
sleepy girl turning into mad girl
this is an awful team that I started using because I really, really like Micro Uzi and G3, and I can't stop at this point
the dilemma of having too many raifus/shipfus is real
follow your heart
I kind of thought about doing the same for a squad since having a single SMG tank can be dangerous
supposedly using HGs as tanks can be effective if their trained enough
that could be worth a try!
weird
is that normal?
for some reason I can't load her high quality sprite
M4A1 is cute too, but there's a glitch in my game that bugs me too much to use her
SOP II is very nice
there's so many guns that I want to level, that I've been trying to prioritize ones that I have a lot already collected
once I ran out of cores, I stopped using the story ARs for that reason
everyone in my team 1 for instance has about 5 dupes waiting for them
there's quite a lot of dupes that I've collected though, so it hopefully won't impact my core reserve much
I'm just about to hit that point
they get used up surprisingly quickly
now I've been sitting around 100
I sorta wasted them at first, and had just about zero before that rate-up production spree
the XP combat sim gives so much surplus XP
goodnight! <:HibikiTired:422925410490253313>
congrats! <:MikuSinging:421435301731368960>
<:MikuBliss:336657233712513024>
it's painful thinking about all that wasted xp every time it happens
yeah
that is quite similar
I couldn't make a nice enough looking team with her with her funky formation
you use Astra? that's kind of neat
very cute though
big doggo
probably should
I liked putting art on like, tanks and things in WoT and Warthunder, but about two years ago I decided to try making my own stuff totally from scratch
stuff like that is actually what got me into drawing
GIMP's interface is just too weird for me
before that though was Paint.net
Photoshop
I was never able to get used to GIMP
ooh
what program is that color picker from?
that's nice 👌
that's acceptable
I'm not good at being put on the spot <:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
the bar on the side should be some sort of orange
even if the gif quality is a little iffy
that's a nice one
I don't know, I'm not really an emoji master like you seem to be
hmm...
sure <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
pink perfection
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
👌
sadly, I don't have nitro
that looks pretty good
at least her face is still so radiant <:MikuGay:336656810788388864>
<:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
yeah, Kancolle just stopped being fun, and GFL's style is way better for that management stuff, and Azur Lane does seem to be very similar to that
but by the time the english version comes out, it'll have been over a year since I've played Kancolle, so hopefully I'll warm up to it
I feel like the only reason I never gave Azur Lane a chance is probably because I played Kancolle first
<:MikuBliss:336657233712513024>
I'm pretty big on guns too, and it had tons of dumb trivia jokes
Upotte is pretty enjoyable
three mobile games might be too much to handle though <:ElfneinBullying:421432763078410241>
whenever Azur Lane's english version comes out, I'll probably be trying it out
<:MikuBliss:336657233712513024>
it the same artist that does most of those Azur Lane boats as well
I like her too
you can sort that to show you all the RFs, but they'll be pretty hard to see if you don't have any
if you click the icon with the two triangles in the bottom right of the main screen, you can then click the Index
they're good girls
my ID is 48892 if you'd like to add me
! Dragon is playing GFL!
nice
what did she say when you oathed her?
<:MikuBliss:336657233712513024>
she really is
<:MikuBliss:336657233712513024>
I've built back up to 150 contracts, and I'm pretty tempted to blow through a bunch again to try for her
97 then
or was it 95? I can't remember my raifu's number...
I'm still hunting for Type 97
oh, yeah true
UMP45's formation is all three blocks behind her iirc
everyone else in that squad is extra nice though
I'm normally into that too, but something about how Grizzly is just seems odd to me
tbh, while Grizzly seems to be so popular, I don't really like her design much <:HibikiTired:422925410490253313>
Sten, especially in her dress, is so beautiful, but the SMG pool is so flooded
good, BAR deserves a nice home <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
<:MikuBliss:336657233712513024>
I'm likely going to be in bed in an hour or so <:HibikiTired:422925410490253313>
I played WoW for years, and tried Mabinogi for a little while, so I might try out MS2
what's the gameplay for MS2 even like? I've only ever seen it for social stuff
<:CarolYandere:424047704826707980>
I use them for fun though alongside G3
...but they're still really bad
Micro-Uzi and AK-47 have fun synergy!
I'm weak to HibiMiku focused events <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
I want to check out AL when it gets its EN version, but three mobages at once is a little much, so I don't know what I'm going to do
it's probably objectively better as a game
yeah, it's that
the M guns are actually a little bit maddening, because of how much cross there is between America's naming system for guns/tanks/ammo/boats and whatever
OTs-12 is easy to remember for me just because she has a little s, and that stands out
at least gun are easier to remember because they're usually just one or two letters and then one or two numbers, which makes them easier to nickname too
remembering sub names is hard to me because they're so many that are I-something
sometimes it feels completely random
to be fair, that's just because that's the real names of the boats
there's a couple of logistics you can unlock later on too that very slowly give them
do shotguns need that?
looking through all the MGs I have, only FG42 combos with her, but her buff is accuracy
her formation doesn't work with BAR <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>

my first shotgun, and she's one I really wanted! <:MikuBliss:336657233712513024>
there's a lot of VN-like things that have been using Live 2D lately
yeah
Live 2D is a really neat program that just takes art seperated out into a bunch of layers, and makes it easy to rig up to move around
it's called Live 2D because that's the licensed method they use to animate pictures
thank you!
<:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
Atago and Tenryuu are really nice
I couldn't ever really get into the style of the artist who did Kaga and Akagi, and I think that's probably the only reason I generally like GFL designs more
yeah
but I also find myself liking the character designs in GFL more, so I guess that's nice
I miss how Kancolle had dialogue that was more than just `Where do you think you're touching!?`
same, at least to an extent
because of how logistics are too, it doesn't really ever feel like you're wasting leveling time on suboptimal guns too
yeah, it's really nice
I'm a little ashamed at how much time I've spent leveling a squad for M37 the last few days...
very true! that's most of the fun in GFL
so finishing getting all the 5*s could take forever
if you want absolutely everyone though, there's a lot of guns that have a 1% chance or so to get
it's nice that with enough time you can definitely get everyone, but it could take an extremely long time
being a completionist in a gacha game is tough in general <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
G41! <:MikuBliss:336657233712513024>
<:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
