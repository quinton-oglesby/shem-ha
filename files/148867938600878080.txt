Always nice to see more Garie <:GarieWink:336657101273169921>
Favorite part of high guardian spice was Greg
Unless Micha is Hibiki’s counterpart, in which case yeah I guess I see it
I was guessing so, I just remember her going after Hibiki mostly if my memory serves, so didn’t know if it was Maria or Hibiki
Huh, Who is Garie the counterpart to then?
<:KirikaPog:605209108827734017>
Dark signer carly
I had fear though when I first watched symphogear cause of anime habits of killing off who you like
Vulgar as hell at first yet opens up in time, plus guns.
Kinda why I liked Chris
Yeah
I mean don’t get me wrong I like Tsubasa, it’s just the way she treated her fan hamster was upsetting, even if she deserved that slap
True
And even before the series Tsubasa suffers
Given her life basically
Tsubasa really did get the short end of the stick in Symphogear though
True
Tsubasa would actually be likeable for the first few episodes too
Yes
You know you got a good one when she lasted one episode yet is still really likeable
I liked Kanade, Tsubasa after was a bit annoying, and Bikki was Bikki
I didn’t have a favorite till episode 3
Understandable
Chris or Maria?
Wait who had the least personality
I found her smile adorable…lol
Killing a dude with a kiss, smirking practically 24/7, she’s a smug one
Favorite symphogear member is Chris and yet my favorite Autoscorer is Garie lol
I guess that’s true
Poor Hibiki, no counterpart for her
I also loved the insert song that played during it
It was
In a split second frame
Micha’s being more difficult to see since she does two poses
The autoscorers do the Symphogears poses from one of the uh…yeah that
Oh yeah I noticed it
