Your soul is still mostly pure
Its not too late to turn back
Save yourself and quit
XDU is suffering if you are anyone other than a Shriabe fan.

>kaixa
If sparkle wasnt a masochist before, sparkle is now.
sparkle plays xdu because there's Kirichan and sparkle is also possibly masochistic.

Author of the critically acclaimed XDU Doodle series
Kirameki Sparkle
its a fan edit by yours truly
its not just any fan edit
but price tags...
sparkle is tempted to get a 1/7 bikki and mod her into this
*squint*
please dont shoot yourself in the foot
its like if someone whispers "OC" in <#357682999300718592>  or "isekai" in any anime discussion thread
it doesnt matter if you know what your doing or not,
But seriously, it works as a relic, but if you're thinking of using anything from Louis Cha or Jin Yong in a story, and your name is not Louis Cha or Jin Yong, you've thrown out a chunk of your credit with the readers.
-------
its just there's a stanza at the end that's written in romanized sanskrit, so no one knows what it says
the first Book's protagonist understands it just fine, and he's a dunce
most of it is pretty straightforward according to what we've seen in the Condor Trilogy
>"no one in second div has read the book and even if they do they will most likely not have a clue what the hell was written on it"
its overused and memeworthy at this point with how many authors are using it (and doing it rather poorly)
but the Condor Trilogy, makes it very clear that the Beggars Sect (or at least when it was under the first 19-ish leaders) was a righteous bunch of lads filled with people who were basically saint-like on the goodness scale
depending on how you play it you could have a corrupt beggar's sect
Another writer trap
>Beggars Sect
that's like super disrespectful to take that title as your own, and ironic seeing as what the "Southern Emperor" in the Condor Trilogy went through
Assuming the person taking the title of "Southern Emperor" isn't the real one (which is probably the case)
but that wiki article looks like blasphemy to Sparkle
Alright, Sparkle doesnt claim to be a hardcore fan of Louis Cha's Condor Trilogy,
its a writer trap. don't step in it
unless you have a very very good reason for including it as a relic, you come off as "put it in there for muh wuxia memes" and no one will take it seriously
it's something that's retroactively written in to history
its a book that only exists in fiction, like in Louis Cha's novels(may he rest in peace) but became so iconic that it gets parodied in most if not every piece of  chinese literature coming after it
>Nine Yin Manual
Hope you all like it ✨
✨ the page might say it's been published since november, but Sparkle's actually made a fair few changes, both stylistically and storywise. So Sparkle kind of considers today as the new birthdate of this piece.
https://archiveofourown.org/works/21446824/chapters/51107023
Set in a possibly fictional city that may or may not be based on some existing place, a ~~Murder Death Kill~~ Grail War has begun. The Clock Tower dispatches a group of four magi to participate, but the alliance couldn't be any less stable.
https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13433037/1/Pulse-pounding-Sparkling-Grail-War-Adventure
This time, it's Sparkle's first shot at non-geah writing!
And to no one's surprise, its Fate <:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
<:SerenaSmile:672908572774105109> Sparkle's back now though! It's not a GS update however.
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025> going completely silent and just going on hiatus despite a chapter being on the verge of release
yeah sparkle was there, but sparkle has kind of gone cold on the writing stuffs part
Hello everyone!
Sparkle is back, ready to share stuff after almost 6 months of radio silence
This looks like the place for non-Geah fancontent.
<:HibiMikuPeek:661660014288568361>
... Sparkle is probably going to find some sort of issue with the chapter... <:ElfneinPalm:672430572961923092> 
Is this why they say authors should never read anything they wrote 2 weeks ago?
<:TsubasaPeek:623246193002151938>
Hello <#458060276550336522>~!
It's been almost exactly 3 months the original release of a certain sparkly Fatefic, and there's only one chapter to show for it. <:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>  
✨ But that single chapter no longer has to be lonely anymore because Sparkle brought it a friend!
Now presenting, Chapter 2 of a fanfiction with a VN title for a franchise that started out as a VN!

I'd be okay with someone like that bullying me
Even better art

now all of us can end up like glen
Human-kun, meet Lucille

*clicks pen*
`Dashing Rogue Bikki capturing the heart of a simple maid of a wealthy household`
max bulli
Kidnap one of their children and replace them with a non-japanese-but-looks-the-part child
Changeling project
But you treat me like a stranger and that feels so rough
And I don't even need your love
Make out like it never happened and that we were nothing
But you didn't have to cut me off
do all the pornbots start posting?
If he says "Pornbots, Rollout"
I wonder what powers R has, as the leader of the pornbots
I wonder what R does to get this following of pornbots
a lot of the gear girls are actually a lot more competent that we think
and she've also seen some of her attacks which involve spinning
I think we have seen her use multiple scythes at once before
Kiri can keep up with Shriabe, while Shirabe is on rollerblades.

long haired bikki looks *ever so slightly* like Jeanne
that shopped anime screenshot of bikki...
Sparkle sees the suffering pic
👀
and hopefully get her by using blank saint graphs
and that day, Sparkle will whale
we will get an ai kayano servant
one day
yey
no need to gacha for her
Bikki is a welfare servant
oh perfect.
✨
*peek*
using Mebius, Geed Solid Burning, Geed Magnificent, Zero Beyond, and Orb Origin (The First) for parts
relatively quick cut and paste job

so Sparkle decided to make a mockup to see what Hibiki would look like as a Giant of Light
there was an ultraman reference in one of the art book thingies for AXZ
anyone here like ultraman?
👀 sparkle sees a Kiri plush
No.
:angery:
<:HibikiShock:336656371611074580>
to seek vengeance
and now her two kids are off on an adventure
Bikki must have passed away
<:HibikiShock:336656371611074580>
WHAT HAPPENED TO BIKKI
each of them have one of bikki's hair clips
they look like bikki and miku kids... but
Sparkle wants have Sparkle's ears cleaned by her <:MikuGay:336656810788388864>
<:MikuBliss:336657233712513024> T-That Kiri-chan!
dad bikki passes away in mc's arms
realizes dad bikki loved mc all along
kills dad bikki
fights dadbikki
blames dad bikki for ded mom miku's fate
sunshine spawn trains very hard
eventually sunshine spawn fights bikki
becomes MC
sunshine spawn has family problems
also gone most of the time
doesnt understand how to dad
dad bikki is off being hero somewhere else
dead mom haircut
genes run strong in the family
oops.
but couldnt keep the family together
she was the team mom
maria grows up to be a completely broken person
she has to live to suffer
no maria doesnt die
<:CarolYandere:424047704826707980> break apart the kiri shira duo
some died
ofc
not all the gears make it to this future
country split into factions
but they all moonlight as heroes to fight villains etc
and the geahs all parted ways to lie low
story is set in a world where song fell from grace later on
and mc never told uncle chris who mc's dad is
uncle chris hasnt seen dadbikki in a long time
- chris in season 1
"IDK how to deal with arguments... but if oyu have a problem with some one, beat them up. onceyou know who is stronger you can settle things then make up"
raised by uncle chris
eventually blames dad
so sunshine spawn feels unloved
and bikki doesnt know how to dad
cause miku ded
one of sunshine spawn's goals is to fight dad bikki too
[shakespeare theme starts playing]

<@243908629177171969>
it sounds like a huge dumpster fire
Sparkle kind of wonders why we're even trying to translate it
happy 1st aniversary of xdu
xdu will cause xv to be cancelled
makes sense to bring a scythe
weddings are events where you kill people, according to game of thrones
sparkle doesnt know
sparkle is qc. not tl
not xdu
usually, gacha games try to do good for the franchise
dont be disapointed. according to the guys doing the tl, the event story looks awful
they really like her
10/10/10 lv100 np5
yeah
sparkle has been looking for them
saved up since the start of the game
and theres also several grailed euryales in my friends list
borrowing a friend's orion
dont have an orion or an np5 euryale
nothing is leveled to max yet
particularily camelot stages
clearing that from camelot to solomon with Sparkle's team is a bit of a stretch
too bad sparkle hasnt cleared salomon yet
Ryoma tho
gudaguda 3
oh right
the edges were choppy because sparkle didn't bother cleaning them too
so sparkle lazily fixed the color and what not
it was meant for a server emote
o7
👀 Shantae stuff
cause what are you going to do with your new player AP bar
too much luck in fgo makes the game unplayable
tbh sparkle no longer plays jp
Sparkle has him np3 from trying to get chocolate okita
he is limited
oh poop

assassin saber guda guda sword guy is limited right?
tfw piano man is ~~limited~~ story lock
Angry Manju? who's that?
murder piano man now plays piano for little furries
angry dog is now a happy pupper
Revenge man is now your edgy friend
Evil Jeanne is now a  tsundere waifu
but through the power of friendship, Fujimaru Ritsuka turns them all into friendly people
Guilty Bikki =/= Edgebikki
^
not really.
Instead of a mad enhancement, she has insanity (which is pretty much exactly the same as mad enhancement)
However she could be summoned as a Berserker without major changes
Guilty Bikki is a Lancer and has no reason to be summoned as Avenger, because she bears no hatred (or love for that matter) to those who condemned her.
```If you want to know more about chocolate bikki, please do check out Sparkle's fic, Guilty Sister. ✨ This message was sent by Automatic SparkleBot V4.13.```
sparkle is the one who did the recolor
of course it didn't work
silly shirabe

and sparkle raises you a recolored edgebikki
sparkle sees your bikkis
she's a really good unit
sparkle will still use her though
sparkle has mamazerker, but sparkle isnt the biggest fan of her
~~instinct buff when~~
but sparkle will never use her because sparkle has an NP3 Altera
sparkle also got an artoria from guaranted pull
sparkle has a helena that sparkle will never use
**Merlin:** I am sorry for my arrogant words
**stheno:** hello
**Merlin:** I can make any buster np servant useful
yeah screw stheno. juliet is much better
~~sparkle bets that event was just to rejuvinate and sell servants that noone likes~~
juliet is best servant waifu
never throw away servants when you dont have them np5, because luck will bite you in the ass
you could see it coming from a mile away if you actually knew the genre
to hell with stheno
juliet is best sister though
euryale is nicer than stheno
you may have spammed through your daily fp rolls and got her there
she can show up in friend point gacha
euryale is a 3* gacha servant
you remembered wrong

euryale is gacha
okeanos is david
huh
is she?
euryale isnt story given
4% ce, 1% servant
ce pull rate has always been higher than servant pull rate for 5*
oh right
that being said, np3 altera has spoiled sparkle
sparkle has awful luck in NA with that NP3 Altera
its just preception and how good your personal luck is
rates are exactly the same
rates are the same
Sparkle's jp account has more luck than sparkle's na account <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
the 50% cost reduction on old story quests is bearable
yeah, as a new player, its hell
tfw can't play events because all the new events are gated by solomon stage
and 20 gold servants to grind
no apples
Sparkle still doesnt see how Edgebikki relates to Okitan

carol best cotton candy
Blue and purple would go well together, sparkle imagines
frankly, sparkle would actually be super excited for Brísingamen SSJ
~~never, xdu is going to give us Brísingamen Shenshoujing~~
~~if she wasnt going to be in the game, why would she be on the title screen~~
~~~the actual assets being used will probably be shitty paint versions of the xdu ones anyways~~

just in case you were wondering, that game an actual in progress thing that exists

Sparkle sees that dess cosplay up there
Sparkle fears something terrible has happened...
Sparkle fears...
As if millions of voices suddenly cried out in terror... and were suddenly silenced...
S-Sparkle felt a great disturbance in the Force...
*stumbles*
Star Wars Extended Universe was a crazy and fun mess.
her right eye's pupil is off-center
by the way
and sparkle did some sparkly magic to make her eyes look a bit more like symphogear eyes

so. Sparkle saw that MHXX post up there
havent rewatched ryuki so sparkle doesnt remember that much on imperer's fighting style
the way bikki fights she uses all limbs and is super versatile
other than that theres really nothing
the kuuga-bikki parallel comes from that one time she transformed in G right
the fact that its orange also eliminates kuuga
dark orange theme, head horns, fur trim on shoulders, mismatched legs, and a card theme
it definitely is

if that is kamen rider, it looks more to sparkle like its Imperer x Bikki
if it is kuuga, that's probably not the same kuuga that sparkle is thinking of
Sparkle hopes you can't unsee it now
even on the original
gen-chan is a good boy
accept the blessings of the divine

>Garren
canonically maria can wield two relics, so its easier to bs their way out of that one
since they're related to the same goddess
perhaps because they're basically sister relics?
🤔 how are they going to write up shulshagna+igalima
maria looks like Airgetlam+gungnir
kiri shira are igalima+shulshagna and shulshagna+igalima
fusion maybe?
are they gearswaps, cause they look like gearswaps
<:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
well, time to watch xdu completely butcher the executuion of the event
adonbilivit
adonbilivit
shid
they're real
no fug
these look disturbingly like xdu sprites, but sparkle doesnt believe that xdu can ever come up with anything like that, so your tricks will not work on sparkle.
would watch an edgy virtual youtuber.
Also DJ's sfx are broken, just like SGU's
tfw its already better than DJ and Arcade

you die 5 nights at freddy's style

ShirabeBot will probably be able to find the source on too
👀 The file is good enough, sparkle just realized that sparkle doesnt have it
<@!246146781832806401> So Sparkle figures you'd know something about this.
You remember that Maria transformation scene that someone redrew with Kanade in it instead?
do you happen to have a link for it?
sparkle likes good kirichan cosplay
sparkle sees good kirichan cosplay
sparkle is a simple sparkle
that serena is borderline sfw for sparkle,
👀
but sparkle really wishes gridman can gain its own style oneday
well, both are tsuburaya properties
>gridman still has design elements from Ultraman
mainly because of her thighs
but she can help them work through their problems together
she may not be able to prevent the future
kokoron is making a band so they all have social support
and hagumin suffers a career ending injury in her university sports years
kaoru doesnt make it big in acting
misaki misses out on uni because she has to take care of her siblings
kanon is a corporate workslave
her conciousness is from a future where the harohapi girls dont get good endings
kokoron is a time traveler

No others
aoi x yuusaku is the only ship sparkle will accept in Vrains.
🤔 mysterious megane girl X
Sparkle can't recognize her!
who is this?
finally some good art
(since its missing some of the elements that are ~~crucial~~ iconic to kuuga's design)
other than the outfit not really representing kuuga
its a good drawing though
the relic pendant in that art looks like a seed of agito
returning to the point that started this smaller subsection
also, many flames
especially with the fire motif and the two leg thingies looking a lot like parts from Agito's Alter Ring
now it just looks like Agito Flame form
>relic pendant without the extra sticky outy thingies
it wont actually, sparkle is pretty sure every single kamen rider design has the belt at the belly button level for the suit actor's ease of movement
"covering beautiful hips tho"
<:CarolYandere:424047704826707980> **why isnt there an arcle on that design**

Sparkle is conflicted. She's cute, but at the same time... Sparkle feels like Sparkle likes Elisanne because she's more or less a Alisha that doesn't get constantly abused by the story
its a halloween elisanne!
!
They're farily new and pretty bad at following a schedule, but they do a good job
usually for the extra content, Sparkle relies on Genm Corp
OT only does the series don't they?
Genm Corp should have subbed them
not the HBV
a trilogy
the Kamen Rider Rogue ones,
No
did you watch the Rogue specials?
Sparkle prefers it closed.
the headgear looks bad when its open, sadly
there's also this one

<@106861977086779392> this might interest you

Zi-O *is* a bad fanfic
>bad fanfic
dan's the kind of person who powertrips hard when given power
it was acceptable tbh
"Waga maou... waga maou...."
and poor Woz was just standing there

and then she'll call sparkle a theiving cat
<:MikuBliss:336657233712513024> the next thing that must happen is for Shirabe to catch Kirichan and Sparkle exchanging chocolates
<:ShirabeEmbarassed:336657288477671436> but Sparkle also prepared chocolates for Kirika...
<:MikuGay:336656810788388864> The thought of Kirika going behind her wife Shirabe's back to give chocolate to the second mistress Kirameki Sparkle makes Sparkle feel warm and fuzzy
<:KirikaGay:336657049540755457>
<:CarolYandere:424047704826707980> this doesn't change the fact that Sparkle is a filthy homewrecker though.
<:MikuGay:336656810788388864>
but kirichan goes behind shirabe's back to make sure Sparkle doesnt get left behind, even if leaving Sparkle in the dust and living a happy monogamous life would be far easier
In fact Sparkle would be happy watching from the sidelines. If kirichan is happy, then sparkle will be happy for her
Sparkle can't change the fact that Sparkle loves Kirichan from the bottom of Sparkle's heart
justas kirichan can't help but love both Sparkle and Shirabe
but such is love
and break the two of us apart

something bad happened to the hands too, but sparkle isnt going to be too picky about that
but the knee itself is too small for how much closer it is to the "camera"
sparkle knows that there's a thigh behind it
the knee you see has issues too

Pachinko games
yahari, its much better to stick to liking the songs and the girls
only to see a disapointment of a gacha, and a plethora of pachinko games
then you eventually begin to wonder what other things are tied to the franchise
but then you decide to stop thinking about it and go back to liking the show for songs and cute girls
except you never reach the light because each season gives you fridge horror moments when you notice an inconsistency or poorly executed plot event
preferably in a non-geah discord to bait people into the trap
does this make sparkle an accomplished artist yet

Can't believe Sparkle's posts are getting poached from other servers
shit.
oh.
korenousuke's death...
so if she is somehow a double agent, it might have something to do with...
The fact that Wazu knows her and died for her tells Sparkle that she was *at least* not on metsuboujinrai.net's side in the begining
Sparkle thinks that if she is somehow related to the villains, it won't be because of her own choosing

for you kamen rider people in this channel:
Re: Metanoia
no, sparkle can't find rips  of it yet
but sparkle does wish story telling could be handled better
Either way Symphogear will still sell despite poorly handled plot, simply because songs
especially if its something of tsubasa's magnitude
usually
except the part where "your friends are your therapist" magic isnt powerful enough to have your recovery portrayed within 10 episodes
like she's probably going to get a talking to from hibiki, get hugged by maria, and maria's gay feelings will cleanse away tsubasa's suffering
that's about it
yes
if we're talking about tsubasa in xv specifically
Sparkle is skeptical about Symphogear diving back into doing heavier things in XV because of their track record of not handling it well/poor execution of said concepts
well, thats basically what sparkle's argument here about heavier content boils down to
we know he gets back together with his family in the end, but we don't know how his journey to piece himself back together went either
the why did he do it part
we know he was alcoholic, and beat his family at one point. but what drives a man to that point?
All people can do evil, but what pushes them to do such things
things we don't get to see is how Topdad gets from any of the one points to the next, which is why his ending feels so undeserved
Sparkle's saying that the Topdad plotline could have been handled better.
If memory serves, what we see of him in anime is 
1. the flashbacks paint him to be a decent guy
2. the present him is spineless
3. he manages to channel what little bit of his former self was left inside him to help hibiki out that one time near the end of the series
4. the series ends with him reuniting with his family
showing people who are in that situation pick themselves up, with or without help, and be able to move forwards again is what you call a message of hope
having characters put in a situation because of something bad that happened to them doesnt have to suddenly paint your show black with all the dark brooding and grief
but "not a dark show" isnt an excuse to bring up a more darker topic, butcher it to shreds, and sweep it under the rug
Sparkle knows its not dark
aight listen here
and the reason it's "daddy issues the anime" instead of "normie family members suffering due to supernatural circumstances" is because it was handled poorly
and that season is the exact same one we get daddy issues the anime
you can handle things better without being absolutely desolate hopeless wasteland
Sparkle never said it needs to be bleak
that doesnt mean you can just half-ass the darker content in series
cutting it down to the point where the plot that they had in mind turns out to be very poorly handled
every time we've gotten close to some heavier content in Symphogear, they've always cut the heavy content down in favor of selling more songs
but at the same time, Sparkle is very skeptical of their ability to pull this theme off convincingly
which does seem to be inline with what you mentioned up there
Sparkle does recall people mentioning that XV's theme seems to be getting up no matter how hard you've been kicked down

we know one thing for sure
as seasoned watchers of this anime
but at the same time
which it is, if interviews are to be trusted
it sounds like shits about to go down
these villains seem to be capitalizing on weak spots instead of previous villains who just brute forced things
especially with how XV is all about how America is like "no touchy relic!" to japan
🤔 vanessa laid waste to the americans with ease because they were pretty defenceless
hell, if you want to talk about "power" the only villain who is close to Fine levels of power is Adam
but they're strong enough that the ogawa-san corps can't just ninja in and take them out
they're significantly weaker than the previous villains
they're the "remnants"
the villains are set up to job
thing is,
don't think too hard about it
and that's usually so they can get their rear ends handed back to them on a gold platter by the villain (which ultimately results in a rematch happening some time later, or a comeback after they realize something like "I was loved all along" or "there is song in my heart" or "the power of love and friendship fuels my songs")
pretty sure the "oh power output drops because not singing" only *really* happens when the instrumental track cuts out
most likely that last one

on the other hand,
</rant>
like if you dont care about your characters, why should sparkle?
but how badly she gets treated by the production team in both canon and XDU content makes it really hard for sparkle to keep investing sparkle's blood sweat and tears in kirichan
sparkle is trying really hard to
like sparkle is trying to like kirika as a character tbh
but no, comes back alive and well in less than 40 minutes
at least leave her in pod like tsubasa in s1
and then boom zesshou
"oh kirichan is my hero"
"oh kirichan is so positive"
"oh kirichan can unison with anyone"
"oh, kirichan is becoming less linker reliant"
flagged her death from the begining of AXZ
they had the perfect set up too
ofc they won't kill her
but they need her to sell CDS

* dies next episode*
so what about kiri then?
like yeah, cool
they showed us that shirabe does, indeed, have a character
come axz
they always feed the screentime into shirabe worship, chris angst, 4 episode maria arcs, and bikki doing bikki things
or how many times they try to tell us that Kirika is a budget hibiki
it doesnt matter how they try to tell us that out of all the FIS girls, Kirika grows the fastest
as a character, Kirika is absolutely pointless
she's not wrong.

but it is still hope
just a little
not much,
there is still hope for this world
"we think you're not normal, so we'll harm and exclude you from everything untill you're normal."
hell, excluding someone because they're different is weird
transphobia and homophobia are strange things
you dont want them following
when you're driving away, take several unessessary detours and always check behind you
when you leave, make sure they can't follow you
are both parents shitty or is one the lesser of two evils
homelss folk will kill eachother
you underestimate how desperate some people are to live
saki, you wouldnt survive because someone will shank you
you're an adult
not sure they can send you right back home by filing a missing person thing
miami is not one of the ones in the first category
there are cities hwere it isnt
there are cities where homelessness is an option
but abuse the hell out of you
they won't let you have a job
sounds to me like its purposefully so you are reliant on them
what can they do other than breaking your limbs to stop you?
you're 23
scrounge for a part time and work up from there
even if its not better for you financially, you'll at least be mentally healthier
then its definitely better in the long run
but if you're being abused and manipulated like it sounds like
moving out is hard, especially when you have to move out of state and sever all your ties
but do you love your mother enough or feel strong enough to try and fix your relationship?
from what you've written, it feels like your mother and you have a really bad relationship
what do you get out of putting up with this
what does she get out of screwing up your shit like that?
but its probably time you get yourself out of that environment
this is the internet so take our words with a grain of salt
you might have to struggle a bit to get rent/expenses down, but you'd be better off in the long run
moving out is a really big change and is really hard to wrap your head around at first, but if your situation is as bad as I'm thinking,
Afte the finals are done, it might be for the best that you start planning to get out asap
try your best to make a good impression anyways
or is this just going off of guess work
do you know for a fact that your dad's side hates you
both paths are shit
you're trying to find the path that lets you have easier access to a chance at the easier life,
you're not trying to find the easier life just yet
whichever one is easier for you to set up an independent bank acount honestly
but if that's not possible, then you'd have to try pretty hard to not get found
best choice if possible is to "officially" move out
sneaking away wouldnt be too good of an idea as they'd call the cops on you though
pray that one of these "rich snobs" understands that the child is not at fault
any other relatives who understand your situation?
or would both of them want you to stay and be their personal punching bag
which is likelier to let you leave
only child?
etc
make sure all your future interactions with people and what not are far away, make it clear to people who know you that you do not  want to be found
after a certain point you can siphon energy just from reading comments on your instagram pics
the more extroverted you are, the more absurd your vampiric powers get
but what better target to drain energy from than the introvert?
they drain energy from others
but they are vampiric
that extroverts do in fact get energy from being with other people
it is Sparkle's theory
feels like "you can't fire me because I quit"
perhaps its how sparkle was raised and who sparkle interacts with, but anouncing you're leaving the debate when its a situation you could just slip away
saying you're leaving the discussion and not bothering with it is like trying to get the last word in
why anounce that you're leaving when its the internet and you could just not reply and end it there
yeah but publicly anouncing that you're done with them and leaving the discussion on the internet feels like you're provoking them
that they are wrong
instead convince them
but hell its riya's opinion, if you dont agree with it, dont join riya in shit slinging
riya is definitely in the wrong for lashing out
yeah
well its serious discussion, just because someone has an off color perspective doesnt mean you go say you're done with them
was he a bit harsh yes
as a complaint about how everyone thinks he's the bad guy
in sparkle's eyes, the anon's 4chan post wasnt so much a complaint about his ex gf'
Sparkle wouldnt walk into a bad neigbourhood and shout racist things
that's also you baiting someone into mugging you though
at least thats what sparkle thinks riya's argument meant
not really defending rape per se, but its like you made a horrible decision and it came back to bite oyu
Sparkle sees where riya is coming from tho
perhaps that anon's 4chan post struck a chord with ria
Sparkle would argue riya's argument was not so much defending rape as "anon's ex gf set herself up for it"
there's also the fact that sparkle read through the serious discussion channel on the valk discord, then hopped her only to notice that it devolved into "Valk discord mods support transphobia"
ibu replied with "And with that, I'm done with you"
sparkle thinks ibu could have handled it better as well
to be honest
sparkle is hesitant to drop the label of "rape apologist" on anyone.
sometimes you might get lucky and no one tries to stop you
sparkle was taught cpr and recovery position but that's about it
the former is slightly more understandable
others rationalize by "Someone else will do it"
Some rationalize it by "I'm not qualified to help"
because "someone else will step up to do it"
and whereas we should listen to them and take their advice, their word is not law
they have biases
they only know slighly more
but they're really just people like ourselves
point is, often times, sparkle feels like people look up to doctors as some sort of divine entity who can solve everything
and to sparkle's astonishment, there are doctors who dont believe in it at all
some people may be more susceptible to it, others maybe more resilient
and that there is no shame in having it
some doctors view things like depression like the common cold, that its just another illness to be treated
but just because it doesnt work on you, it doesnt mean it doesnt work at all
and not all doctors methods will work on you
each doctor has their own theories about it
by extension, medical practices related to the black box known as the human brain are also really iffy
since those tend to be a target for vandalism
or gender studies, race, religion
like POTUS
sparkle wouldnt trust wikipedia on more heated topics
that's a godsend for sparkle
especially the resources and references part
and when everythign goes smoothly, its beautiful
wikipedia is kind of supposed to be a place where specialists from each field contribute
but the more academic pages tend to have less stupid edit wars
(funny as in Great Emu War edits)
and there are funny ones
there are stupid ones
>stupid edit wars
except wikipedia has it done before you even ask
its like goingto the library and having the librarian picking out a set of suitable books for you
someone literally did your source finding for you
nothing better than that when you're reseraching a topic
FREE BIBLIOGRAPHY
what's better is they have a resources tab at the bottom
and also those pages tend to have a more academic tone of writing
especially when it comes down to more academic topics, there tend to be a higher amount of people who know what they are saying
it sure has a really small amount of vandalism and know-it-all complex
for something that "anyone can edit"
Wikipedia is a really valuable resource for surface-level understanding
and going back and framing it in a homosexual context would be slightly insulting for the reasons Outside mentioned.
sparkle doesn't think bert and ernie's relationship was something they explicitly planned on mapping out
mr hooper's dying part was to some extent planned
sparkle feels like while will lee's death resulted in them retiring the mr hooper and teaching the kids about death
farily sure the ability to digest milk had nothing to do with skin colors
then they must all be the impure race
therefore if supposedy only white people have this mutation
do any other mammals digest milk after infancy?
well technically, that gene is a mutation
🤔
it just doesnt make sense to sparkle
milk being a symbol of white supremacy is about as stupid as the okay sign being a symbol meaning white power
so was `ok gesture is white power`
you also have to wonder what levels of boredom the guy who discovered fire must have had
no clue, take what sparkle says with a heap of salt. sparkle doesnt study early humans. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
well it probably isnt too difficult to find a source of milk, since domestication is a technology that was developed very very early
except the ainu and japanese apparently
well, not even the experts can really agree how humans traveling over the globe would have worked but if we think about "purity" as being closest related to the first humans, then pale skinned northern hemisphere people are the furthest away from that
the theory goes that something happened to make resources scarce, so a good portion of the people who did not carry the mutation that lets them consume lactose probably died cause no food
~~you can't sue them if its discord and you havent opted out of the new clause thingy~~
sparkle assumes its like that with all software, and that the company has the ability to terminate your licence if they want
sparkle remembers someone on the league subreddit proclaiming themselves to be a lawyer mentioning that buying skins isn't actually purchasing as skin, but purchasing the ability to use it.
yeah, a blind eye
just no one mentions it
everyone still remembers chris brown beating up rihana
well its not like they forget
slacktivism at its finest
if there aren't people actively picking at the scabs, people tend to brush it aside and turn a blind eye
but its true
It's pretty sad when you think of it
^ THis
the best weapon against mass media is critical thinking
people who would get overly riled up about this would be the same type of people who'd campaign to ban DHMO
the first case, if you have a way with words or are the only person who can do it, talk with her and tell her its going to be all right, and life will find a way to work itself out.
if she spins that into a negative about how "is it okay for life to suck" you agree with her that it isnt and it would never be, but that's how the world is and its never fair. tell her there are many people out there going through this, and though they may never meet eachother, she's not alone in her depression. Talk with her, be around, let her vent
Sparkle has experienced those thoughts before, so sparkle isnt talking out of the ass.
sparkle feels that there are 2 situations where turning everything into a negative can happen. (1) when they're seeking attention. sometimes they just want someone to be there, to talk them out of thinking those thoughts. (2) they're legitimately that far gone.
its more of a cry for help than a retort
if you dont know what you're doing you can fuck things up and you don't want risks here
she may thank you for it, she may hate you, but its for the better
find someone who can help her
get her help
if you know you cant handle it, or if its the second case.
you're 22. adult age. but being an adult isn't just about age, it's about being responsible, independent, and being able to take controll
well, have you done anything worth them respecting you and letting you go?
grass is greener on the other side
too bad, humans don't think that way
so you're saying that your family should learn to love and appreciate the child they have
frankly, being compared to someone else is something you'll have to be used to
burning bridges is a last resort, the issue is knowing when to do it
you burn a bridge, and you are stranded
when you tear down a bond between you and someone else, especially when you need them, you're crippling yourself
burning bridges isn't just an idiom/metaphor/whatever
they could always cut you off
going so far as to block them and burn bridges when you need their funding for education is a bad idea
or bitching about you being incompetent in their eyes?
blaming you for being a cancer on her life?
actively being toxic?
what do you mean being a prick
and come back later like "oh sorry, was busy."
if its through messages, you could always not respond
but you'll have a small pillow of cash
your degreee/diploma is going to take longer if you work a job (since you obviously can't study that much)
get some money, save up for the day you can finally ditch your folks if you think they're so rotten
like a work a job
if you really can't deal with your folks, spend time away from home or something
Swallow your pride and soldier through it
which is stronger, your reliance on them, or your ability to provide for yourself
or your need for personal freedom and health
is your feelings of obligation more important
weigh things
do the hedonist algebra thing
there's always covenant house for homeless youth if you're a kid and really need to leave
that's not entirely self-sufficient by sparkle's definition then
ofc, if you *can* survive on your own and *are* self-sufficient, as well as being over legal age, then the question is why are you hanging with them anyways if you know you dont get along
but at least bide your time until you're self sufficient and can fare on your own
not saying that you should kiss the ground they walk
you're not going to get given a second childhood and a new set of parents
you generally only have one set of parents to raise you most your life
but you don't tell your parents to fuck off unless you 100% think the relationship is no where near remotely salvageable
you don't tell your boss to fuck off, or well... you *can*
its even worse if you're actually dependent on that other person
by lashing back, you burn whatever's left of the bridge
at the same time they have to earn your respect, you yourself have to show them that you're worthy of them backing off
yes, but that also doesn't mean you tell them to fuck off.
age changes things
time changes things
not with that attitude
but the fact that you wished them to die won't change, and it will haunt you later if things do get better
and maybe things will get better,
you have quite a bit of time left to deal with your folks
people live to their 80s even
you're only 22 right now
Sparkle really hopes you reconsider
also, regarding `I 120% mean it when I say they can jump off the bridge`
if that worked, kaze wouldnt be here now
sparkle has a feeling that sketch's sugestion has already been done
after that, YOU are going to take your life in your hands and do good with it
you're only dealing with them untill you wring that college money out of them
the most important part of this is to know that YOU are in control of YOUR life.
and if anyone is going to think that life will be perfect with no bumps whatsoever, then they're delusional
there's gonna be problems
there aint no one in the world who lives the perfect dream of white picket fence 1 spouse, 2 kids, and a dog
so bear with it for the sake of the future
but in the end you can't change the past
since they could push you around all they wanted
perhaps you were too passive in the past and thus they react badly to you actually standing up
Kaze, you admitted that you need your parents to fund your education. If you can't pay for it yourself, then you're forced to rely on them
that's been said too, and it can't be stressed more
^
covenant house, at least in vancity, houses people up to 24
that's been said already, latooni
if something happens to them for real, you'll feel pretty bad about saying those things
if you don't mean it 100%, then you don't mean to say shit like that at all
like 110% mean it
also, dont say things like "they can fucking jump off the bridge" unless you 100% mean it
but its what "Average Parenting" looks like
not saying its good, in fact its downright horrid
thus "average parenting"
but its what the average parent does
well, yeah sparkle knows very well its not parenting at all
Average parenting.
then why talk back now?
they'll just say you're being a rebel at the age of 22 otherwise
they'll be more willing to back down
sparkle thinks if you can find something big that you've done, and show them that,
🍄 ☁
simply let them do as they wish while you preserve what is dear to you, 
calling them out and berating them for being a poor human being is too much effort on your part, seeing as they're really not trying to be one
but when they do, they fall hard, and to be honest, no matter how pitiful they look in that situation, people will find it hard to bring themselves to help after knowing what that person has done
the world isn't fair, and they won't always get the punishment they deserve
even if they do realize they're doing wrong, the fact that they're still doing scummy things means they weigh the fruits of their actions are worth more than what little humanity they have
and they truly believe that everything they do is just
they clearly don't see the error of their ways
for people like this, its often times best to let them rot.
If anything, the most difficult part of apologizing isn't wording it, or being rejected. The hardest part is learning to let go after they refuse your apology.
Any relationship is a two-way deal. Both sides must be willing to mend the relationship in order for it to heal. And if your apology doesn't work out, then so be it. Understand that sometimes, no matter how hard you try to fix it, your mistake could have been too big to fix. Even so, take pride in the fact that you still stood up and tried to make things right. So what if it doesn't work out? As long as you never let something like this happen again, it shows you've grown as a human being and learned from your past.
So, what Sparkle is trying to say here, is kind of like. Sometimes, an apology isn't enough no matter how sincere you are with it. Maybe they will say they accept your apology, but deep down inside, you know they don't actually accept it. But reality is, you tried to fix your mistakes, and no one can fault you for that.
============
Once upon a time, Sparkle had a good friend who shared many many things in common with Sparkle. We did everything together, and perhaps, we might have been a bit more than friends. Let's call that friend "Cinnamon".
Now, Sparkle used to be the type of person to always say what was on their mind without hesitation. If Sparkle had something against you, Sparkle would say it to your face. If Sparkle thought you're a nice person, Sparkle would make sure you knew how wonderful you were.
Of course, not everyone likes people who are too straightforward. So people bullied Sparkle and made up rumors. But Sparkle didn't care at all about those people. Those people are those people, and Sparkle is Sparkle.
Eventually, they start to slander Cinnamon. These mean people were super crafty and sly about it, maybe Sparkle was a little too willing to ignore them too. After a class trip, Cinnamon stopped talking to Sparkle. Only later did Sparkle realize the cause of it could very well be because those mean people began to pick on Cinnamon. In other words, because Cinnamon was too close to Sparkle, Cinnamon got hit by  collateral damage. At the time, Sparkle had no clue what was wrong, Sparkle kept trying to talk to Cinnamon, but Cinnamon ignored Sparkle's texts and everything.
Sparkle tried to apologize for it, even if Sparkle didn't know what was wrong. But nothing ever worked. Only in hindsight does Sparkle realize the full gravity of how bad Cinnamon was probably bullied. And it's because Cinnamon was too close to Sparkle. Sparkle couldn't face Cinnamon anymore. If Cinnamon was on one end of the hallway, then Sparkle would turn tail and head to the other end. If Cinnamon was so much as in Sparkle's line of sight, Sparkle would find somewhere to hide like an insect. The guilt of not being able to see what's really happening, and not being able to be there for Cinnamon ate away at Sparkle for a long time, and still stains Sparkle's soul today.
============
Sparkle doesn't exactly know how to encourage you here, but what Sparkle *can* do is tell you Sparkle's own story about an apology in hopes you can learn something from it
it happens when you least expect it
its really funny how you can rarely ever manage to get a papercut on purpose
the thing is
ebooks and tablets are the hip thing now
who reads books
who uses paper
they'll never have to deal with them anyways
can't let our innocent sheltered children know about the horrors of papercuts
but something relatively minor like having your skin ripped off, or very itty bitty tip of finger cut off by accident?
okay, sure, posting a picture of a guy who got hit by a car is a no go
<:MichaSmug:336657136065052673> just because you need to play by the rules doesnt mean you're not allowed to talk about how silly some of them are
nothing to worry about
:15min:
discord is petty
but also
don't do it again so you don't have to piss of discord for something petty
basically, at least you know discord doesnt like it when you post your papercuts and boo boos
its basically discord being picky and choosy
and there isn't violence to celebrate
"oh look at how mangled and cool my hand is, I bet you all wish you could get your hands caught in doors"
can't be the case
>glorifying
why would you get sadistic pleasure from posting pics of your own mangled hand
but Sparkle doesn't think you guys are really in the wrong, and its nothing to be too worried about
Well, sure at least now you know what level of bloody does Discord draw the line at
Sparkle knows what it looks like and Sparkle would still not consider it "shut down server, quarantine the poster" worthy
getting your hand caught in a door isnt what sparkle would consider gore
unless your area has a clause that lets minors make the decision to vaccinate
where you can get all the shots you could ever want
if your folks dont let you get them, your best bet is to pray that herd immunity keeps you alive until adulthood
>vax
that sort of thing
then again, sparkle was raised to value family.
no matter how horrible they are, at least leave out some incense on the aniversary of their passing.
you're fine to say that, its just that sparkle thinks that hating a family member enough to *not feel anything* when they pass is pretty cold
and a bit of you will be left thinking, "maybe I should have talked to them more"
cause maybe one day they'll get ground into a fine paste by a 18-wheeler
but sparkle would at least say to not hate them to the point where you curse them to death
Well, personally, sparkle wouldn't go as far as to ask you to love your folks unconditionally
this is not the type of thing someone in that kind of office should be saying in 2019
this is pretty much a "I know they're the victims this time, but dont let this distract you from the fact that they're still muslims"
"I'm not racist, BUT..."
saw that on sgg a few hours ago
oh
there are more idiots out there than you think.
the biggest issue Sparkle sees with making robots do labour work is the labour force being laid off.
again, there are people who have nothing but the muscles on their body to use.
there was a similar case of this stuff back in the industrial revolution, where they tried making machines to sow make textiles, then the cottage textile industry literally went on rage riots
think about the 15 year old trying to find their first job
another issue with no more labour is that there will always be people who have nothing but their bodies to work with
technology hasnt advanced far enough for this to be doable in most areas
the manufacture of robots, and the fact that the running costs for them would likely end up being higher than $10 an hour per unit
and polution but no one gives a shit about that
logistics
you pretty much just pointed out the exact issue here.
as for cushy office jobs, not many people find their life's purpose looking at spreadsheets for 8 hours
if you look at grocery stores, specifically asian ones, the staff are pretty much a second family to eachother, but at the same time they enjoy working and talking with coworkers, they will not hesitate to bitch about their superiors being stingy and min wage being barely livable
a lot of work is harsh and backbreaking enough to outweigh intrinsic motivation
unless you genuinely find joy stocking grocery store shelves and hauling half tons of rice all day, you'd probably be upset with your min wage too
people do volunteering and other things for fun because they find it rewarding, they themselves find joy in doing things like that
at the end of the day, intrinsic motivation doesn't keep your belly full
if intrinsic motivation was everything, no one would complain about their job, wage, schoolwork
intrinsic motivation means you drive yourself to do things regardless of what other people give you
well the thing is
without competition people simply don't advance very far
but people are to some extent selfish and lazy at heart
now a friend of sparkles once mentioned communism being a solution funnily enough, and in a perfect world they'd be right probably
in a competitive environment, these problems are bound to show themselves
This isnt the last time we will see these problems
but one thing is for sure
sparkle isnt going to try and say the past issues are worse or the present issues are worse
granted, the issue of high prices, poor wages, no employment, and too many workers are all issues that have shown themselves up in the past
there are university grads who still work min wage since they cant get a job due to their lack of experience or the other side's lack of demand.
but there's only so much work that needs to be done
you could promote education, co-op, and trades programs in order to give peopla more skills so they dont work min wage and help out that way
and companies find themselves being able to jack the prices up since with more money circulating, each dollar is technically worth less
in the end, when wages go up, more people have more money
on the other way, there really is no sweet spot of increasing wages
these folk who still have money stashed woulf serve as a buffer and company proffits wont take that much of a hit
companies wont feel the impact since there are still a large portion of people with buying power who can keep the companies afloat
before that happens, you will have the min wagers suffer, since while the wage cuts will screw them over
dropping min wage, while companies will eventually have to lower the prices when they find that people can no longer afford to buy products
worth less as in buying power, not just exhange rates
Sparkle feels like yeah, companies don't like dropping their prices, but thats also cause a dollar in the present is literally worth less than it would have been before
oddly enough, its actually slightly more comfortable if its *two* min wagers in one house. still wont have much outside of the basics though
and being "not dead" is being alive, but you also don't get to enjoy the benefits of enjoying life
min wage in vancouver is pretty much "just enough to not die"
"being able to live" is pretty vague
issue is
min wage in vancouver is only just enough to live with the bare neccessities
lowering min wage would kill people
so they won't wring you dry
but they also realize if the literally wring you dry, then they have no ground to stand on
your needs just have to not clash with the needs of those at the top
you don't *need* to be at the top to benefit from capitalism
you're going to need likeminded people to work towards  and pull off a perfect utopian society
if you want to experience what a community without money is like, you could always head up the mountains and the valleys to some communes where likeminded people settle
like maybe boss turning a blind eye for the guy's lates
or at least tell his boss he took care of things and expect little benefits in return
but you can sure as hell bet he's gonna ask for overtime
he's doing it cause he wants to get the job done
like say you see a worker at a supermarket going past his shift pulling pallets
you'd see poeple getting booted and leaving
what if we had to be active contributors to stay on this server
Like sparkle said, there's a limit to what intrinsic motivation can do
the 7 sins *arent* wrong. those 7 things are vices that humans are very prone too
this is where human nature kicks in
so why should they get treated better
you;re one and the same
but cut the two of you, and the two of you will bleed red
so you see someone else getting like 5x your rations because they need it
that wouldnt be fair would it?
but if you just got bigger portions while everyone else didint
like lets say you're a big eater or something, and since everything is rationed off, maybe the rations are too small for your liking
no as in Sparkle uses Sparkle's meal stamps for you
which one do you choose
research a topic of your choosing but Sparkle takes you out to dinner afterwards
OR
now if Sparkle were to ask you to research a topic of your choosing
hold on a sec
lets take payment out of the issue
they do it for the numbers
they do it for money
no matter how much they hate their job
look at gorcery clerks. They don't haul literal half-tons of rice every hour for fun. they do this for money
since the client has foot fungus or something
and the people who massage refuse to do it for free
then you'd have the issue where someone wants a massage
and people with poor budgeting plans will sink down to the bottom
one way or another, money/credit or whatever currency you use will find a way up to the people who know how to grow it
and they just got X dollars extra
you just lost X dollars with no material goods to show for it
if someone gives you a back massage for X dollars,
an example is trading services
this is basically asking for humans to stagnate. someone is going to find a way to make more currency
when you quantify your goods as a certain value of money, it gets easier to trade
what if you want to trade with someone
money functions as a standard
you're not getting any money in the arts field unless you're popular
>entertainers, writers
now, the arts field is pretty much gated by public opinion
the more arguments and the more conflict
the more people around, the more time it takes to make a decision
there's a reason that a common saying goes "the opposite of progress is congress"
and even if someone up there wants to, everyone else at the same level will stop them
the second issue would be trying to get to that stage.
taking the steps to advance technology and prepare society is such a big change that no one  up at the top is willing to do it
the issue is for most if not all of the historical examples, upon the marxist society (or as marxist as society could be at the time) being overthrown, we see turmoil and strife in its wake. Failing a transition of societal structure has grave consequences.
now we can say that "we won't know we'll fail if we don't try, and not trying is one of these flaws we need to tackle"
humans are flawed beings, and a perfect society woudln't be perfect if the beings that compose said society are flawed.
but the very fact that people can be corrupted or lead astray points to the flaws in human nature
you could write it off as people being corrupted by a hedonistic capitalist mindset
and almost every time, there has been revolt and unrest
we have seen marxist values incorporated into various historical and modern nations
the society that should ideally evolve into a postmodern labourless world where everyone is free to do as they wish
this is about the society person X lives in
and perhaps person X is the one to actually approach and help the injured person. but this isnt about person X
how many times have you seen someone fall over and no one reach to help them up. its the bystander effect. "Oh, someone else will do it so I don't have to bother with that." and that's the bystander's excuse for not helping
Personally, Sparkle feels that it is human nature to be selfish, greedy, and trample others for personal gain. If this were not the case, we would not see people abusing the existing system to silence others.
if you're on thin ice long enough, you *will* fall through
you can't just be like "oh just skate on the thin ice for maximum cool"
if you don't feel safe on thin ice, don't skate on it
theres a difference between maximizing profits and maximizing profits at the cost of an arm and a leg
and content enough to not overthrow the top
because the top can live well with what they have, and the average person on the bottom has enough to live content
then the top is in a stable position
as long as a fair enough % of the lower people on the ladder are satisfied
they mean plural you
and by "you" they don't mean you in particular
they keep you satisfied enough to not violent revolution their asses
you can only nudge things and hope nothing pushes back
you can't implement changes in parliament or you risk an opposite political force rising up
you can't revolt or you risk being put down
the tricky part is that even if you do have a better system, you can't outright change it off the bat
but its still running, and you'd be hard pressed to find something that works better without being ruined by some bad eggs
and the cover over the carriage might have gaping holes that let the rain in
pulled by a half dead donkey
it may run like a carriage with lopsided wheels
sure
but Sparkle feels democracy isn't doing that bad either
yes, humans are often corrupt, and its not uncommon for the worst of the batch to rise to the top
if they believe they can get away with it, they'll be willing to cut more corners as time goes on
where people don't do evil because they have social control, in other words something to lose if they get caught
Sparkle buys into the theory of social controls
is completely and utterly free of bribery lobbying and corruption
that a senate, a political body/structure that's been thought of since back in the Roman days
but sparkle finds it really hard to believe
sparkle knows that
thing is,
this stuffs probably been happening forever and ever
if you're outraged about it now, its probably because news of it has been leaked out everywhere
maybe at some post secondary institution studying police stuffs and law
not sure how accurate it is, but Sparkle does think its a bit dark of a film to be shown in school
Sparkle thinks this info came from a documentary called the 13th?
and have the bill pushed up to the senate/whatever
and delet the logo of the lobbying group etc
where you just fill in the name of the guy presenting
and they literally poop out bills that look like madlib sheets
amongst tons of others
whatever company is in charge of private prisons
walmart
Sparkle heard that there's this lobbying group supported by companies and buisnesses like
Pretty much every company that's big purchases laws
they probably blocked sparkle because sparkle seems western
so the only time sparkle has ever been blocked was linkleft
Sparkle only uses twitter to cruise for art, not any of the socio political legal stuffs
but it also sounds like it would work
that god prclamation thing is pretty offensive, ngl
and when they do record things, they leave it a huge mess
but often times they don't in certain conditions
the courts in a lot of places are supposed to record everything
ah the irony
so sparkle feels safe saying that sparkle will trust in the system for this
sparkle doesnt see this specific case as one where its likely to get tampered with by the system,
Sparkle personally wouldn't trust any of this and instead just trust the legal system to be honest
anyone and anything can gain traction
it could be a crackpot who took a lie and deduced the truth
it could be half a truth spliced with a lie, it could be the truth rearanged to become a lie
for some reason everyone believes everything
doesnt matter if you tell the truth or a lie
twitter is pretty much like a sawmill tbh. you light a match in there and it explodes
there are different parts of the document that are coming from someone called moonifest
cause if it is, then all it takes is for some inquisitive chap to go look it up themselves to get an unbiased view
does america keep stuff like these transcripts on public record?
but Sparkle does find it believable that both sides of the argument are cherry picking their snips
now sparkle *doesn't* know if this is real or shopped
like
Sparkle's been finding other things online
re: the vic stuff
it was for how lectric asked the question and how it was very evidently meant to stir up a fight.
But *not* for server versus server drama
Sparkle jumped in after that.
and a mod stepped in to stop any discussion about server versus server stuff.
which, for those of you who are not aware, lectric's username at the time of that debacle was "being straight is fucking gay"
another made a snide remark at how of course it would be someone with a sexuality related username would start this topic
one person simply said to ask the people who left /r/symphogear
as far as sparkle recalls
First of all, calling it a fight would be misrepresenting what actually happened. No one bit onto Lectric's incendiary statement.
Sparkle would like to just say that Sparkle was the person who got into a fight with Lectric on Valk, and Sparkle would like to clarify some things.
Hello. Is it okay if Sparkle resurrects a topic from earlier on here?
and that's all sparkle has to say.
there's also an implication in the discussion here earlier where it seemed like it was an actual fight between two parties when it wasn't.
sparkle finds it super disrespectful to just air it out and hope sparkle doesn't see it
and Sparkle is in this server
But when it involves Sparkle
Sparkle doesn't mind Lectric coming to this server to air out such things.
One last thing then.
it genuinely upsets sparkle when things like this happen and people hop off onto other servers and just air out their bad experiences. This generalizes people into an "us vs them" mentality.
Yes, negative experiences happen. Yes, if you've had negative experiences you *should* tell others. But if these negative experiences keep happening, is it really healthy to keep doing things as it is?
the fact that its even proven from history that the same type of negative interactions repeating themselves is proof enough that something needs to change
which we see with the repeated negative interactions on valk.
if you avoid the problem, then you never really have a solution for when it comes up again
that's not how one goes about solving issues.
sparkle feels that that's similar to cutting off one's own toes to avoid snakebites.
its that his conclusion drawn from  such situations is without exception "this is why I don't talk to people"
all he did in response was confirm everything, however what irritates sparkle the most is none of all that.
what happened in the serious discussion channel was sparkle taking lectric's statement, and explaining why it would upset people, and ask lectric why  he would do this
sparkle must restate. sparkle wouldn't really be able to call this a fight.
and "in an orderly fashion" irritated sparkle because it not only assumes that the listener is unable to be civil, but also looking at lectric's history, his interactions with Valk discord have generally been negative because of similar incindiary comments or situations
the "change my mind" meme is often used when the speaker  has absolutely no intention to actually change their decisions
however sparkle took issue with how it reads in context
of course, by dictionary definitions, none of this would seem bad at all
Lectric only said "Other server is better than here. Change my mind in an orderly fashion."
This is sparkle yes.
and then I realize I'm only half way there
time to binge
oh look ep 12 is out
thats what I happened with me and apocrypha
Sparkle hasn't played osu in a while, but still has it installed

was basically calling them out to a fight
the use of a ZweiWing song knowing tsubasa is there
the symphogear being basically Kiri and Shirabe's live likely pushed them to do something like that
knowing ver, he probably was serious
Ver was joke/threatening to feed their pendants to nephy
sounds fair to sparkle
if you think you can one up the last performer, then you go up there and do it
its open mic
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
somedays, sparkle feels like sparkle is the only person who had kirika as their favorite since kirika's introduction
💔
>Kiri didn't become my favorite untill after AXZ
*scrolls up*
and then we will get Chaldea Life with Gramps anime
Eirri gudako will become a legitimate part of the Fate franchise
one day in the future,
Gal Gohan is good civ
So.
*crosses legs*
*sits down in a comfy chair*
*kicks down door*
really glad they decided to include symphogear characters in re:creators
Moe Moe Z-Cune makes it worth watching
never forget akibared's final form is waifu powered
Moe Moe Z-Cune is so cute
and you can't change sparkle's mind
Akibaranger is the official unofficial sentai
But does PR have Moe Moe Z-Cune?
Sparkle actually wants a Moe Moe Z-Cune
that being said
<:MichaSmug:336657136065052673> Akibaranger is a parody sentai that memes on everything and doesnt take itself very seriously
from what sparkle heard, PR Samurai was "lets take Shinkenger, but make everyone american instead"
Saban's Masked Rider should send the person who wrote the adaptation straight to the deepest parts of hell
Power Rangers are sin
netflix adaptations are unforgivable
more concerned about americans adapting japanese media

all that's left is the neflix adaptation
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
and we wont ever get an adaptation for obvious reasons
soon the only isekai story adaptation we'll be missing is the one where mc-ossan tours isekai brothels
and Kayanon is Mom
Sparkle heard Isekai Mom is getting an anime
so its a fun watch every week
they meme with their  clifhanger endings just as hard as symphogear does
oh right
season 2 abandons what's left of hte story and goes full gore
let sparkle warn you that amazons is lighter on the story and heavier on the gore
yeah
Amazons?
Kiritsugu voices mc-kun's dad if sparkle remembers correctly
you could always watch the jp dub of dragon knight <:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
apparently, Dragon Knight isnt that bad
>kamen rider adaptation
the folks there are very touchy about their sentai series being adapted due to the recent PR track record
well, if it was a kyuranger adaptation, the server would be in even worse shape
the toku server sparkle is on got set on fire because of it
Sparkle heard that they're adapting gobusters
the RB gyro is stupidly big
look at the modern day changers for ultraman
the transformation items for ultraman used to be as small as a ballpoint pen
to be fair, sparkle's used to seeing things like that
and then theres gamer driver <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
the fourze driver is giant too
you dont notice it as much because they sell it well
the Drive Driver is gigantic
its not a matter of how rediculous it is, its now the shows sell it
only way
if kyuranger gets adapted, get the actors to do kyutama dance
KYU KYU TAMA TAMA TAMA KYU KYU
Kyuuranger is cool
Seiza Blaster from kyuuranger is cool though
its sci-fi
its not mecha at all
>ultraman
Gridman anime isnt so much "toku" as it is a "Mecha anime whose source material was a toku show"
toku is where you have people in actual suits going around and having explosives detonated around them
as it is a word that describes how its filmed
Toku isnt so much a word that describes the story content and characters of a show
"Special Filming"
"Special Effects"
Tokusatsu = 特撮
there is overlap, and that's fine. why?
the original suits had those features already
mechanical bits were not stuck on in the process

🤔
🚔
🚓
📞
ultraman is generally straight up not mecha most of the time, since the titular "ultraman" is quite literally a giant silver alien luchador from the other side of the universe
sentai on the other hand does this thing where each episode has one half dedicated to guys in spandex suits, and the other half is giant robot mechs duking it out
Sparkle does agree that gridman is definitely very deep in mecha territory
sparkle doesnt actually watch gridman so sparkle can't say anything about it, but sparkle is familiar with the types of shows that tsuburaya works on
<:MikuSad:336657015961026560> but precure...
any of y'all seen sheildbro yet?
but if you want optimal experience, sparkle recommends watching the anime too, since the anime does a phenomenal job of bringing the story to life
there's only 50 chapters or so, and its complete
it feels like its paced pretty fast, but its also one of those mangas that have really spaced out releases
sparkle's favorite manga that sparkle read in the past month would be `Inari, Konkon, Koi Iroha`
speaking of cute manga
sparkle heard that he did what he did because he got axed
it was good until the author went off the rails

yey! CE drop from raids!
running through raids right now though
sure!
Sparkle did start JP
yes
can d'eon qualify as both male and female?
you cant get the tripple np chain
that if you switch
the thing with plug suit is
and then you have 2 turns of free damage
just evade or survive the np
huh, fran raid is fairly easy too
raids give Sparkle a lot of master xp, so Sparkle will grind that untill Sparkle has enough cost to field a decent team
Panic
Nyanta raid down\
F
dont exactly remember
or is it new moon?
because astolfo doesnt remember the name of the np when its not moon
tfw astolfo has a np thats super broken, but only works when its full moon
not even ruler can tell what his gender is untill they see them naked
Riyodako is lostbelt final boss
Riyo Gudako is beast class
Le Secret
Gender: ???
As per Astolfo's request, their gender is a secret.
oh boy Astolfo's character bio in fgo
its all but stated
its all but stated
its implied he's a guy by everything else
Fujimaru Ritsuka Psuedo-Servant
speedo Gil
give swimsuit husbandos
swimsuit astolfo amirite
Sparkle just wants mata hari to be happy
well, mata hari's actuall occupation was an information broker
Wu is a concubine
she's an "exotic dancer"
debuff bot
good enough for what Sparkle needs her for
need decent units
starting on jp
her debufs arent on her first skill
Sparkle has to put resources into mata hari
darn
Sparkle actually burned apples to read through it
Accel Zero's story was really nice
altas dress is invulns right
you dont get infinite Hero Proofs in JP
I miss NA
darn
some buffs last only 1 turn too
and got spooked by Altera
but Sparkle failed
Sparkle sped through roma and okeanos for enough quartz to get Okita
Just Altera.
only Alteras
after that
Tamachan was Sparkle's first SSR
pulling tamachan cursed Sparkle's account
Sparkle has TamaCat as well though
Caster
Sparkle's back line will always have mata hari and kiyo though
sparkle also enjoys using Tama and Nobu
Sparkle uses Sparkle's NP3 Altera alot too.
d'eon is probably the one 4* Sparkle uses the most
D'eon is suprisingly tanky
d'eon served Sparkle well
previous rerolls in NA had sumanai everyhwere
Sparkle purposely rolled for deon though
but Sparkle's JP roll had Liz EMIYA as starter
Sparkle's NA roll only had D'eon from tutorial
when will na get it
>D'eon update!
tribrid support lets go
triple hybrid support <:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
Proto merlin santa lilly as ???
summer merlin as quick support
merlin as buster support
alright, time for Sparkle to farm fate/zero event in NA, where Sparkle *doesn't* feel like a baby bird
Feels bad to run buff teams then
ouch
AI mordred has a thing where she targets Artorias right?
he also has 200% Crit Damage because of the CE he's holding
450k dmg NP
Golden with only his own buffs
<:CarolShock:430939013235474432>
Sparkle will have to rely on Idoru and Mama Emiya
not even in part 1 probably
but the issue here is Wu's materials arent found in the first few singularities
One of the cards Sparkle relies on is WuZetian
Sparkle has hit a roadblock
sums up raids for Sparkle right now.
Sparkle will give it a shot
or maybe Sparkle should drop down to a lower diff
only shakespeare bullying this time.
cant clear the other either
can't clear mordred raids at max diff
so if you die, tough cookies
its kill based
apparently the apocrypha raid isn't damage based
ah I get it now
gn
Sparkle would probably still use JKsaber because she's JKsaber
what pool are the free srs from?
no seibafaces
takeuchi curse
ah
it would be nice if Sparkle could have unique SSRs.
while sparkle is really happy with the ssrs
>Altera
"Really want a Nero"
Singularity gacha right before london
>Altera
then Thanksgiving paid gacha
sparkle wishes she had imaginary around tho
still great seeing as Sparkle's jpa account is a starter
imaginary element
the np charge one 4*
jp is really too kind
gets sakura ce
throws down a ticket
decides to be more daring
gold
sparkles and becomes gokd
settle for gilles
oh well. sparkle was greedy.
silver saber
but turned gold too
it started as a silver saber
and jp wants to change that
jp knows sparkle isnt comitting to jp
jp really wants sparkle to stay
starter roll was emiya liz
achilles chiron moedred wuzetian
30 quartz 5 tickets
4 days into jp
This scares sparkle...

that or get ripped off by second hand game stores
piracy is an alternative solution
play FGO for olga route
olga pseudo-servant when
jp wants me to stay

sparkle is definitely getting hit by a car
third solo
Sparkle is going to get hit by a car soon
and this happens

yolo solo
Today is a good day
CE drop from NA too
Oh boy.
can't wait for them to hit NA
Sparkle can say JP definitely has a lot more cool things and QOL changes
Well, now that Sparkle has played JP for all of three days,
probably going to prioritize NA though
yep
not sure if you were replying to Sparkle, but Sparkle was talking about Imaginary Element
<- only one IE
<- doesnt have a single k-scope
but 50% np
no place for destiny manifesting or logging industries
everyone knows america is a celtic kingdom
nah that cant be true
symbol of america
very big 5 year old.
riyodako?
at least it was fairly easy
it was like if valentines chocolate event and knk collab had an unholy love child
the event story really carried that event imo
Sparkle is forced to remember because fate zero event
funny how kid gil is rarely mentioned as a member of chaldea daycare
illya kuro
wu euryale stheno smoldusa
jack nr jailter
oh that just refers to a group of servants
need chaldea daycare
activate his crit buffs and watch him shred things
Sparkle  hears you need a crit gen servant then put crit absorb on billy
at least caesar and billy are decent
but no quick servants to use them on
oh right sparkle has 2 IA as well on na
sparkle has pulled 2 heavens feels and 3 limit zeros
on NA, sparkle's gacha luck seems to be catering towards sparkle's altera
sparkle would use imaginary around on achilles
but then no waver
could borrow a support tho
no astolfo <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
mlb leylines is 50%
imaginary element is 60%
no waver
but sparkle has no kscope either
if sparkle had any decent gold riders, sparkle could try to build a 3 turn set up
arts np too iirc
to meme
yes
oh right did you see that 3 turn door farming sieg set up?
poor waifus on dragon's na account
it was xdu. 0.8% chance. changed it
but not a single one
even by unlimited probability works, one copy should have come home a long time ago
and going $3000 dry
The lowest Sparkle has been was rolling for a .8% chance SSR
but Sparkle probably holds the record for worst consistent luck
There are people with worse luck than Sparkle.
then enough ap shoukd have regened in fgo na to play one more 40 ap hand map
grind fgo na, then bandori on 3x boost, switch to fgo jp
grind XDU mindlessly in the background
havent rolled many times in bandori either, but Sparkle can safely conclude that nothing good will come from there either
not in XDU either
not in NA Sparkle doesnt
But this is fine
Rip Sparkle's free time
Sparkle feels obliged to take Sparkle's JP account seriously now.
never forget zero escape elevator scene
nyanta!

welfare is welfare
why not
Sparkle will get murdered by spartacus <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
<:HibikiShock:336656371611074580>
>making Spartacus farm is opression
oh his guts
he gets his np charge at max ascention or interlude?
would alex be good cheap rider for door farming?
tomorrow is saber rider day for na right?
time to farm hands
tfw edward lvl 1
but she isnt enough
sparkle does have a single gold rider
fastest arm farming wouls probably be arash and a bunch of gorillas.
fastest door farming for sparkle right now would probably be arash drake and someone else
would give up this stack of limit zeros for a single kscope
because command card luck just doesnt like giving Sparkle art cards for Francis
but in practice, it won't work
in theory Sparkle should be able to 5 turn hand farming
feels bad
feels good to 5 turn things
finally found a francis friend who has maxed out golden rule with IE equipted
but big berthas are another story
you can carry sentry guns too
nothing like howitzer or gustav that needs rail transport
pretty sure girls frontline will only ever do weapons that are small enough to be carried by humans
then reassembled
transported on railroads
they were taken apart
how these ladies are used
Big Bertha is stretching the definition of a gun
https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/dc/Dicke_Bertha.Big_Bertha.jpg/300px-Dicke_Bertha.Big_Bertha.jpg
even without a boat attatched
Well,
thicc handgun-chans
https://i.pinimg.com/originals/0c/7d/e1/0c7de162f7fe3ff5a3c912740f228edb.jpg
like Raging Bull and Anaconda
one day, Girls Frontline will give us more modern day guns
Gun-chan strong
you have to have insane arm strength to make an amunition belt whip like that
is that it wasnt britain or france that did the heavy lifting vs Germany in the first world war
the funny part to Sparkle
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
the victor writes history
but hey
the alies did a lot of shitty things
but france did it
that is frowned uppon
using peace treaties as a way of forcing one country to take the blame, then bullying them into submisison, opressing them and thus indirectly causing them to rise up and start world war 2
but america still did it
nuking two cities in quick succession is typically frowned upon by most civilized societies
^
but its exeedingly shitty
its lightweight handgun
and the enemy troops would execute the surrendering soldier on reflex
the gun would discharge while they were handing over their weapons
in fact, when japanese troops were surrendering in the world wars
a gun known for accidental discharge
Sparkle imagines a nambu-chan gun girl would be that one clutzy 1* unit
say does that girls frontline game have nambu-chan?
one of the shittiest handguns
never forget type 94 nambu
so many thicc guns
smith and wesson 500 mag <:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
anything is a handgun if you;re brave enough
"handgun"
Raging Judge 28 gauge
http://www.thefirearmblog.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/img_5032-tfb1.jpg
stretch the definition of handgun
that's just a story Sparkle heard
and stalin had the room swept for bugs
when hitler met stalin, he flicked stalins earlobes
apparently hitler used an earlobe flicking test to test for jewish blood
hitler and stalin were both paranoid
*invades russia, stays for winter*
look what happened next
they say hitler went up to a napoleon statue and swore to not make the same mistake
"never invade russia in the winter"
you know
>napoleon vs russia
but tactical failures
milked germany dry of money and resources
they had germany's coal fields for quite a while
and yes, france was technically better off than germany
hindsight 20/20
but what could you really do against blitzkrieg friends from germany
people meme on france a lot for getting their asses kicked a lot
and just meaningless sacrifices of manpower
older war plans are useless
but now that everyone has new and improved weaponry
everyone had the right tactics to win last decade's war
everyone was prepared to fight the previous war
no one had a clue what they were up against
basically highlights the burutality and of world war
the alies would lose the "new" territory within the next 7 days
in exchange for shitty bog land
so 15k canadian bois
within 100 troops
and the general's guess was right
and so the canadians did
just take the land
the brits said, that they didnt care
the canadian dude told the brit that it would cost 15k lives to retake that
there was barely any point in retaking it
all that was left of the village was pretty much blood soaked bog
If Sparkle recalls correctly, the brits told one of the canadian leaders to retake a village
canada and the colonies also got used as meat shields a lot
who speedran vimy ridge
then we have canadian troops in ww1
we have people speedrunning shooter video games
FOUR HOURS
in four hours
they took vimy ridge
hell
no one really gave the canadian backwards courrier-de-bois and first nation militias the credit they were due
but Sparkle would argue that they didnt deserve as much of the credit as we give them nowadays
they did do the work
it was canada and the other birtish colonies
Chiron sensei lv 1
Mama Emiya lv 1
nyanta lv 40
cant archer team either
lucky for sparkle, sparkle has a friend on jp who does
Sparkle doesnt have a maxed np5 euryale in jp
<:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
and now starts the gawain fights
theyre sort of trash mobs, except they can and will kill Sparkle's sevants in 2 hits
tfw three nodes of nothing but gold mooks
RIP Sparkle
hit camelot
rushed story mode FGO
just need to stall out Camelot's infamous NP spam
doensnt have to charge own np
NP draining skill
Sparkle wishes Sparkle had units that have a vamp skill
1 command seal used
Sparkle heard it gets harder
second gawain fight finished

aparently Sparkle only needed to take him down to 75%
wasnt that bad
okay so 9 turns

He is trophy servant
Feels bad
No angra on NA account
NA has pretty much all non-story locked 3*s at np 5 already
2 week old account doenst have that much FP to roll with
well it is for Sparkle
its not like you absolutely *need* Artemis, Euryale, and Stheno
Gawain fight was cheesed using necromancy CE
so sparkle really doesnt have many cards
and like 8 tickets total
only rolled once
Sparkle's account is like 14 days old
Sparkle actually managed to cheese the second gawain fight and just barely survived it
everything is gold mooks
Camelot doesnt seem to have bronze mooks anymore
feels bad
thing is sometimes, gawain uses his np charge skill too
tamamo's doenst charge her own np though
Vlad too
Stheno probably
Gil pointed out Sparkle had no CEs.
<- Kirameki
oops.

this is clearly juliet.
<:MichaSmug:336657136065052673> We dont love Stheno. We love Juliet.
and Sparkle 2 ticketed her\
FGO event made Sparkle love Stheno
Sparkle did it
rashomon raid on NA makes apocrypha raids in JP look piss easy
alright
but with black and red as her color scheme
she looks like a chris.
if they do, then it takes one turn longer and screws your S-rank
using 2 echelons should be enough to s-rank clear as long as they AI doesnt decide to cap both helipads at the T-junction
about 48 attempts on normal difficulty
apparently she has a higher drop rate on the harder versions of the mission

its done.
to survive the stage
sparkle could probably use support echelons to clear all the chapters and just spam repair
sparkle doesnt know what to do with all these quick production and instant repair
you get enough contracts from elsewhere
ch6 logs the dream
gameplay wise too, sparkle needs to level sparkle's units before doing any more story
so medusa with maxed Damage CE is decent for 2bp rashomon
not a boss reward
and this Chris was dropped as a stage reward
Sparkle heard s-rank gives you a chance to drop it at the end of the stage
sparkle still cant log in <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
but Sparkle is probably going to go back to rolling for Kar
and pulled 4 different 5* handguns and a ton of 3* handguns
Sparkle switch to building handguns because Sparkle needed M950A
no cores
only used dupes
Sparkle has a Link 2 G17
yes
Sparkle still doesnt have enough cores.
<:MikuSad:336657015961026560> even when sparkle saves every core possible and refuses to use cores for other cards,
this means Sparkle's Link 2 G17 is the product of much grind and suffering.
sparkle is taking the chalenge of only ever using cores to Link 5* and Story reward 4*s
<- UID: 43783
probably not
*sends friend request*
👀 A Gfl friend code!
and theres probably older ones too

and even further before that

its everywhere
this meme format
found on the sub
https://i.redd.it/fleeo8yfsg011.jpg
compared to repeatedly grinding on the map
it probably feels like they drop less on auto because of how much time it takes
not sure if they can drop off of autobattle,
what do you think
sparkle used to play XDU
well, if davinci took the form of mona lisa, sparkle thinks a michelangelo servant would probably take the form of david. preferably clothed.
~~and because fate, also becomes a loli~~
michelangelo qualifies as a heroic spirit
what if in an alternate history
if we can have lostbelt ivan be summonable...
but lostbelts are like alternate histories
either because genius rivalry or davinci doesnt want michelangelo to suffer eternal world saving and grail war
in some interlude or whatever, davinci mentions she's happy that michelangelo isnt a heroic spirit
so, sparkle had an idea
could be scath's sister couldnt it?
might not be scath tho
yeah thats tama assassin right
they're already running around like headless chickens with the reveal of tama assassin
it would murder all the tamamo fans
because summer tamacat would be comical
or a summer tamacat
is it the tama assassin?
the amount of grinding needed to level all these servants
sparkle can no longer keep up with the servants sparkle pulled
meanwhile sparkle's jp luck makes sparkle want to play less...
now to wait 2 or 3 years for tama assassin
lap pilows and cuddles from the tama9 family
sparkle's first ssr
lv 90 tamachan
but sparkle has done it
it took a literal half year

is sanzo limited?
f
are there any good welfare CEs in go west?
and how good is xuanzang/sanzo
oh right how painful is go west
whaling hard isnt needed when you can only pull one specific ssr no matter the rate up
sparkle wants new ssrs too, but too bad sparkle will have to get them via blank saint graphs
emotionless world eating saber
altera (i corrected myself after)
nice robin btw
altera
no one would envy sparkle's np3 ~~alter~~
at least there are people who would be jealous of your wavers
but some 4*s
no 5*
its suffering
not strong enough to grind efficiently, or have fun grinding in jp <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
oh right an event is going on in jp
today, you save pipes; tomorow, the world
fsn shirou fixes pipes.
thats cause miyuverse shirou had actual training
miyuverse shirou in fgo without miyu servant would be suffering
miyuverse shirou is a good boy
we still need shirou pseudo servant
one of ishtar or eresh's lines would probably be about not liking the guy
ascend with bloodied azoth dagger
or better
ascend with mapo tofu
with welfare kirei
inb4 fate accel stay night order
davinci didnt either, but she was prepared
good ol holmes putting in work
something something kizuna something destiny something musubi
but something something the bonds between them still remain
theyre all gone now
at least the pre lostbelt ones
canonically, hasnt guda summoned all the servants?
especially now that guda and friends are on a road trip through space and time
if guda summons him, ivan would have to remain in spirit form all of the time
sparkle thinks it is
but we already have david as a servant
grab support waver
assassin day was super easy
oh right
so sparkle lets tama die and loses out on the tama np
or let tama die
and sparkle has to either give up a damagr dealer
because even if sparkle used all the stall skills, eventually, one of sparkle's servants needs to be sacrificed
it was really painful for sparkle too
tfw tamamo has piss damage
tfw cant bring altera on archer day
mata hari hit really really hard, but thats probably because of the debuffs and the sheer anount of damage ces
not enough invulns to save jack
jack support managed to die
with mlb damage ce
sparkle ran matahari
ibaraki raids rider day
so for rashomon rider day,
its to send a message though
the most mindless 20 minutes of sparkle's life
sparkle has seen a vid of someone using a lv100 leo to solo tristan
Sparkle hears grailing asterios is a decent idea
gotta meme
np is atk steroid <:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
theres fat saber who is way better
he's pretty bad
on gilles that is
must be fun, dumpstering things the turn after you pop np
sparkle saw a lv 100 giles saber before
any higher is a really big investment
only go to 80 tbh
kiyo?
feed the grails to your favorite lower rarity servants /shrug
happy
because she needs to be
grail mata hari
like how some servants remember previous grail wars
basically just a separate summon of davinci, except she retains memories of her last summoning
not a perfect copy of davinci though
splatters from pulling your hand out and probably from the severed arteries and veins of the now shindeiru'd davinci
pulling his hand out
always there for you, senpai
sparkle hasnt gotten to solomon, but sparkle knows what happens
speaking of her guiding you, theres a theory that guda has a sibling
she's guiding you through life as a mage, and saving your ass every chapter
gotta do it for kouhai
its so cheap and so good
will never understand how people cant 10/10/10 their mashu
summer
sparkle can save for sjmmer kirakira
sparkle doesnt need to roll
ok so she's not limited good
sparkle knows the chinese name and the name fgo uses is xuanzang but its just easier to type
the multi cellular organism as a heroic spirit. put into the throne of heroes for pioneering life on earth
and we can finally reunite them
maybe one of the lostbelt servants will be sita
maybe people couldnt find an okita or rama with dmg ce
quite the few extra friend points came in too, not sure why
saber day was easy because np3 altera ofc
would have been better to put tama np last so everyone gets the np charge
just force of habbit in constantly putting damage np last
it isnt. sparkle figured
waver support was too valuable to give up
needed waver
but waver's buffs keep liz alive long enough to finish the job
ofc, one 500% liz np isnt enough
buff up caster liz and watch ibaraki die
use tama and caster liz
labo pokemon
life is good.
tried to pull for kar, but the other kayano ai raifu drops from the same recipie
its been 3000 years, dess

like the one where looking into the asshole of a shedinja sucks your soul out
some of the pokedex entries are spoopy as hell
a candle with a face on it for example
some of the new designs are really grasping at straws
Sparkle agrees
yeah
oof
proto entei looks like it evolved from vulpix
>tfw WA2k number 4 gets crafted
saki found the Chris Alter
!
finally have a level 70 unit!


Lamp-kun
5 more to go
sparkle is on run 140 now with 3 g17 drops
sparkle got sparkle's first  copy of G17 on try 49
so white and fluffy
a number 7, two number 45s, one with cheese, and a large soda
<:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
<- pulls number 9 four times in a row
>new gfl event is a lottery
Tommy!
(serena-chan)
oh right, springfield is voiced by yui horie
for a lot of VAs, sparkle doesnt recognize the name, but sparkle has definitely seen their work many times before
astra is voiced by aqua from konosuba
Tommy is voiced by taneda risa
`I haven't seen anyone else I recognize`
but at least WA2k will keep coming back
<:MikuSad:336657015961026560> Kar will never come home...
>kayano ai guns
then having IDW DANYAAAAA blasted into your ears
and being greeted with a 2 star silhouette
getting 1:10 timer
Sparkle wouldnt say bad
but imagine dumping a ton of resources into a build
fmg drops from chapter 2 boss stage
sparkle is around that count for 2-4e
beautiful tile buffs
astra is one of Sparkle's favorite handguns to use
oh right
deploy units on them
no bulli gun girls
💢
Sparkle heard someone say Uzi is garbo
Hey
*sparkle peek*
<:CarolYandere:424047704826707980> why would you want to switch from kalina?
click the top bar
you can always get your guns to retreat individually

you can wife them

dragon now has 1 like on dragon's dorm
added
sparkle started 5 days late <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
43783
sparkle is looking it up
just to snipe them before someone else
and even then, sparkle checks back every 3 hours  for batteries
sparkle has 20 and sparkle only collects all 10 daily batteries on a good day
you need a lot of friends
Sparkle thinks dragon should give up on collecting batteries for now
WA2k is sparkle's lovely lovely tsunhime
sparkle has 4 tsunhime and counting
on the other hand,
doko da
where is Kar
<:MikuSad:336657015961026560> Sparkle is still rolling rifles....
well, you could be insane and roll a rifle recipe over and over and over again like sparkle
build 4 units a day for dailies
for when there's a rate up you like
save your contracts
once you have enough to put all 4 echelons on logistics when you sleep
preferably have a SMG up front because tank class
what sparkle does usually is have sparkle's formation match whatever buffs  sparkle's HG unit has
that's how sparkle learned
then rearange your team untill you get the highest power values
tap formation preset
sparkle uses astra to buff M14 for data simulation
having 4 diagonal tiles centered around you and buffing rate of fire and evasion
<:CarolYandere:424047704826707980>
01:10:00 timer
Pull for unit
EYE DEE DABURU DANYA
<:CarolYandere:424047704826707980> then she's enhancement fodder
<:CarolYandere:424047704826707980> you'll get tired of her once she starts showing up everywhere
the real gacha is the furniture gacha
of course, sparkle would have less inventory space issues if sparkle decided to use the duped WA2ks for link fodder
because inventory space
sparkle is trying to frantically link 4 everything
Sparkle isnt focusing on leveling a squad rn actually
Skorp is sparkle's only level 70 unit rn
along with sten
she's one of the new player's best friends
Sparkle appears as one of Sparkles 4 different WA2ks
changing adjutants also changes your sprite when you visit other dorms
both Solo and Sparkle failed miserably
playing runescape has prepared sparkle for this
don't worry
<:CarolYandere:424047704826707980>
Sparkle should be able to get several copies of the ch2 limited gun before sparkle needs to return to get the last 3 glocks
sparkle will now move on to chapter 2's boss stage to grind copies while Sparkle grinds levels on glock
✨
Link 4 with only dupes is a reality
✨ Yay! Glock-chan number 6 obtained
✨

sparkle needs to do it for ithaca
but how else is sparkle going to get a good shotgun?
not if you buy resources with $$$
>money gacha
yey
its a gacha for your gacha
not sure how good she is as a unit though
sparkle is very tempted to roll for her because she's pretty
*Pokemon Red/Blue Lavender Town Theme plays*

Sparkle still loves you, uzi
>uzi
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089> finally a 3* drop from the stage
lacing in the occasional exp sim
in simpler words, sparkle ground about 5 units from 30 to 70 off of 2-4e over the course of 2 weeks
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089> Sparkle is nearing 150 consecutive runs of 2-4e without a limited drop
cause they won't bother with visiting
so if you're unfortunate, and you dont happen to be one of the 10 people they visit, you won't get likes from them
same with collecting batteries
if sparkle recalls, you can only get friendpoints for liking other dorms 10 times per day
its a bad idea and sparkle regrets it
dont be like early game sparkle and think you're so smart when you burn energy on capsule sim for the tile drops
so you are doing that sim for what the sim is named after: capsules
its worth noting that even though capsule sim can give resources, the resource drops are absolute poop
and even then, you would only do that to a 5* equipt
to be completely honest, equipts dont feel like they matter too much untill you enhance/calibrate them
might as well use less resources for now and save them for productions
the general formula is 150/150/150/150 apparently, but alice most likely can't even use the 3* and higher equipts yet
once they hit level 45 or something, you should be able to use 3*
cause you're just getting a stash of 2* equipts that you can use to boost your units slightly
dont bother enhancing or calibrating the equipts yet either
your units probably can't use anything higher than 2* equipts yet
just shove 10/10/10/10 into resources
but its only really worth enhancing 5* equipts
you feed it 2* equipts
enhancing equipts is like enhancing t-dolls
you dont get that till later levels
or so sparkle has heard
lee is good
Sparkle's mossin jumped several hundred CE after sparkle burned some capsules on her
the real important part is enhancing your units
and needs to be protec from bulli
uzi is a cutie
just watch it in fast forward ✨
or it just might be how cheap she is to build, thus being in most production pools
Bear seems to be a very common five star

or go AOE tanking with mashu and boudica
unless sparkle wants to cheese with cu
d'eon is sparkle's go to tank actually
well, at least d'eon is a good tank
the devs will never make him good <:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
astolfo is strictly for gender ambiguous waifu/husbando money
or at least, they should
tickets come in half an hour or so, thinks sparkle
sparkle doesnt have tickets for this yet
but that altera makes sparkle laugh nervously
>want davinci

top tier arash strats lets go
failed to get her, but got a black grail
sparkle burned a tone of tickets for davinci
oh right
sparkle got the male mc instead
the ce you have on shuten
but sparkle got two hakunos instead
sparkle wants that
>hakunon
sparkle still doesnt have one
>formalcraft
sparkle would give away those heavens feels and limit zeros for that
<:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
>2 kscopes
all sparkle wants is winchester or ithaca
heavy prods are going nowhere for sparkle <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>

for mobage, you play because waifu simulator
nah, with modern gaming, you play for `pride and accomplishment`
because fgo is still probably the biggest and best waifu simulator out there
look at sparkle with no nursery rhyme
most people dont get what they want for a long long long time
because you literally cannot pull astolfo
you're not supposed to count your first roll
something something ~~semiramis~~
something something calamity jane
something something saber diarumid

the child who just wants to know mama's love
or are you just for assassin ver jack
what about FSF jack?
the sword that thirsts for blood
it would have been hilarious if Taiga's third ascention gave her the torashinai
can't wait for free taiga after babylon
sparkle heard hg is really resource cheap
run more hgs?
mgs eat ammo more than other guns
sparkle meant fielding mgs
oh right, sparkle didnt mean making mgs
All three of them
91 ammo is a really cheap recipie
and sparkle has also been only doing rifles for a month and a half straight
sparkle doesnt use superstition recipies
if you're going to try for ump
you need logs that drop more ammo then
404 ammo
see, that's your issue
what recipies are you using?
dont use mgs if you want to conserve ammo
he's smol alex
musashi-chan yay
~~explained away by multiverse theory~~
because everyone not naturally female can be genderbent
theres a high chance that the servants are female
but krika, this is Nasuverse we are talking about
that's useful
we saw her steal command spells in apoc
jackie is also a doctor, as evidenced by E rank Surgery
that damage boost vs females tho
and you in FGO are called "mama" no matter the gender
seeing as her master in apoc was just a bystander she calls mama
jack also seems to imprint on people
the big issue is managing to stop her from cutting you open and crawling inside
oh yeah, jack is a busted servant
<:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
and her only chance to ever get her wish granted is here, with you the MC of FGO
<:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
she wants to use the grail to wish for happiness, but the only master who could ever win with her is a master she would never voluntarily serve
hell, mata hari is a free ticket to final 2 masters as long as you have no heart and you are willing to abuse her in the worst of ways
~~assassin is a busted class as long as the master is an immoral heartless bastard who knows how to abuse it~~

daughteru davinci is a backup because davinci saw this coming
daughteru davinci isn't the same davinci though <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
for headpats and cuddles
we get daughteru davinci
you sure you want to know?
its best you dont look it up because davinci is closely tied to the story, being the player's navigator in game
which davinci is better
the real question is
one of sparkle's logs is a full mg team
mainly because the stronger units are all logistic slaves now
but sparkle's team is definitely worse than yours
no clue
most of us only do our daily four productions, then stock up resources for the mythical rate up
tbh your problem is most likely completely attributed to how many productuion contracts you're burning
and sparkle only uses gems for unlocking t-doll slots anyways
monthly gem package is fairly cheap source of gems
maybe one day we will get thunderer
yay
liberty, cola, and single action revolvers
because this format of echelon is exactly what sparkle is grinding with
sparkle has no clue where your ammo is going into, other than your production contracts
what is your squad like?
sparkle wouldnt be able to tell the difference honestly
not sure
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
the whole reason sparkle is out of parts is because ithaca's recipie requires 4000
lower natural gen, and seems to be fewer good logistics
true hell is grinding parts

would probably ease the burden
and you also eat ammo when you resupply in game
logistics barely give that much
are you spamming contracts on ump?
its not like you need something with 5k ce to grind all your stages

one letter away from being floofy pokemon waifu

sparkle also likes wasting quick prods even when sparkle doesnt need to
sparkle doesnt run quick prod logs <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
taking existing drawings and modifying them to make new servants
sparkle sticks to the theory that takuechi is long gone and its just a person ghost drawing for him
there are  servants who arent on that list who also seem to have a saberface too
yeah, sakura and boudica are similar, but its nowhere near as rampant as Takuechi's Unlimited Saber Works
he's lost the ability to draw anything other than saberface
takuechi probably has a `blank_saberface.png` file that he uses every time he wants to draw a new servant
~~and also about sakura and boudica~~
you can say that about almost every takuechi saberface
>copy homework
dont tell me we're actually going to get God Hand 12 lives Herc
<:MariaShock:423196877354303498>
>Herc with 5 lives
