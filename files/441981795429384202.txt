yeah it deletes the og message and makes it impossible to search by typing in the name
i just want to add, I started using it and I think it would be helpful with anyone else who has a system as it stops any confusion of who's talking when it's been set up
Is it possible to have Pluralkit added at all?
<:verytired:739234579994640424>
I'll add that I've never seen it make chat unusable
just a suggestion, As thats what this channel is for
but <:shrug:694922016133873826>
it takes an actual second to delete the og message
my ping standard is 100 on discord
no I mean ping to the person
others have near instant posting
it does that *only* if there's bad ping
honestly from what I've seen personally and by using it
it does?
but the "bot" has a user id
cause I know people tend to mute channels they don't go to
And I think it's just not clear if <#377148557796442134> is meant for well non symphogear spoilers at this point
all I see is Gundam spoilers
Look in liveposting
A channel for newly released anime spoilers? as looking through liveposting to see spoilers of a new episode to an anime that is brand new and all you see is a bunch of spoilered pictures is hard to tell what is a shitpost and what isn't
Gayswordlover works too

Basically no difference in voice, just a little difference in acting till he got comfortable
Montys bro i think took over after Monty passed
Ye Ren
There is a touch missing with the combat, but that's cause the original animators Monty had actually left. Who made the dance fight scenes
They still are doing a good job
Also animation is really choppy early on, because Monty had a small team then and was mainly him and two others animating
But in a good way
It's all whack
Grenade launcher HAMMER that explodes in a heart shape
"I have nunchuck flintlocks that are also a staff"
"This suitcase is my weapon. It is also a mini gun"
Ignore what the fandom says about the seasons. If you enjoy it you enjoy it
There's one later season that *seems* out of place but it's heavy character and world building
Give it a watch sometime if you want
All of Rwby is like that
I mean
Oh and a way for her to slow her decent from high altitude
The way she uses it sometimes counts as a shotgun tbf
And high power sniper
Shotgun
A scythe (and war scythe depending on the situation)
Cresent rose
Ye
Even one who does pieces of their AUs showing what they changed from the main story.
~~Favourite is when Ruby loses an eye like cinder but still does her eye thing to full capacity~~
Theres like several amazing rwby artists that get the characters perfectly
Married

Give Miku x Maria
Do it
<:TikiPraise:672430544381935625>
<:hehe:640577262235811894>
Hence why multiple art pieces her Heterochromia is never the same
Also she can change into other people

Also. Saying Everything needs to be trans themed just feels wrong or forced. Like the theme being present but hinted is 100% fine but the "must be trans" makes me feel wrong
Oo pretty
~~not everything needs to be trans themed~~
His gun is called Blue rose
Nero also named it that himself because the original was so strong no normal human could use it. Red was for the colour it got from heating up, queen was for something else. 
Nothing trans related cause his gun has a similar naming

look at the author
3_skip
when Bikki is almost turned into a god thing
it's during axz
and HIBIKI the villian
it makes Miku the Protag
I'll try to find the name
with one having an after story chapter
even has extra endings the author made to since they couldn't decide on a defined ending
it's a VERY good fic
~~there's a fic where she goes full doom guy to a horde of noise~~

fran is lil baby who fights and is tougher than she looks
I've seen that yeah
then when I realised I went hunting for it and found it's not on crunchy
I didn't even realise the anime is about a reincarnated sword
Youtube gave me a compilation of just fran being innocent
I still can't watch it cause it's on a site I don't pay for

Can't get the booster yet
Two shots here
All of 2021 in my town
3 cases?
We had like
We're good with covid tbf
Covid for me means hospital cause of Asthma and that tumour i had months ago
If you find out it's worth checking out more
Or anything else related to the lungs
You don't have any like family history of Asthma right?
~~Thats a lawsuit waiting to happen~~
Talk to your manager about it because it's stressing you out
This is actually worth it
^
Cause if that was such a problem she really needs a reality check
Can i punch her
It's so bullshit
Ah
Like a friends or something?
Would you be able to leave to somewhere better?
Gwyn took the words out of my mouth
^
But Ten literally just sent out suicide notes and isn't responding
Like it's not we don't understand it
it really isn't
I... fuck I can't think straight
I think Li is the only one who can actually get to them
<@!279891944606400514>
I think.... I think I just got a message from Ten that indicates they're committing ||suicide||
Or conflict
It'd be ANOTHER war
Holy fuck
If we did
I'm pretty sure we don't have our own KKK
*we don't????*
*what*
Wh
Yes it can be strange to feel hesitant. 
But it's also a normal thing to feel after what ten has gone through
<:Hug:599384397539704832>
it's actually normal
Yes
dumbass
Jesus
I meant the nukes
Scroll up
I don't know?
Isn't there an entire thing in place to prevent it from just happening
The world had already gone to shit, this has just added onto it
Jesus
I think it's legitimate

Posting this about something earlier of the Ukraine pilot
holy fuck
I don't pay attention tbh
Oh
Wait the government is doing stuff again?
Okay fuck off
BELIEVE ME
Drinking doesn't help anyone
Cause you're toxic as fuck right now
Maybe you should get off discord while drinking
Alone
"I'm lonely" you literally put yourself into that situation by drinking
Grow the fuck up, face your problems without drinking and quit being so toxic
Drinking helps no one, I know this because i grew up around alcoholics. 
You'll fuck your liver up because your fucking depressed
Neo is always amazing
But
A constant shit show
Oh rwby is just
Oh i remember that lank
The game
I tend to ignore the majority tho
Most toxic place I've been apart of for 8 years is the destiny community
I just had a full anxiety attack
that's if I can manage to stay on the call
Welp time for me to call up fair work
*Me, who intentionally spoils themselves on everything*
Yee i know
ah
I am so confused on what's happening on that
he still screams
so she sleeps to jack screaming at the top of his lungs?
I agree with neurotypical people not understanding at all as I've dealt with it for the pass 15+ years and it has gradually gotten better, But they never seem to understand 100%
Just want something with low ram consumption
Firefox i may go back too
Just not actually the best with YouTube recently and never good with Netflix or crunchyroll
Gx has been hood to me so far
I mean charles is also 73
Can't find anything that says he has been removed from a quick search

Holy shit
It'll affect us someway
We are under the UK parliament
Welp wonder how this'll affect Australia
I mean if he's healthy he'll live longer
Elizabeth was 96
Yeah
She may be dead but it'll take a bit before people say king instead of queen
Yes that is correct but for what was being replied to it was more about the queen
You jumped in and immediately corrected saying "King. Not queen."
Thats not what i said?
Lank just gave answers to Maria since Maria basically said it wouldn't affect aus at all
<@244504593008951296> this was the original question which was minutes after the queen passed
Yes
If you read the replies you'd be wrong in that correction <:Sip:729826169607946240>
I knew it'd affect Aus somehow
Then what was that in sfw
and your entire DAY is ruined
One thing
<@331908049822547978> Are you serious
~~Good thing i have a good source for Dakis~~
Damn guess I'll have to look elsewhere for the Marin Daki
She is also really wholesome from what I've seen
<:MikuBliss:336657233712513024>
Marin
Idk why but i can't stand fma unless its brotherhood
All the way
Brotherhood
Its one of those where literally both sub and dub do it justice
The dub is good
