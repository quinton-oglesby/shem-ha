Yep
Oh hello

<@!193408538909868033> I mean it IS called Red Hot Blaze
Okay but first I need some clarification on something
As an example of this kink in play
See Astolfo doujins for reference
In that it’s a weird gender kink where one gender has traits of the opposite one while still acknowledging their true gender
Futa is in the same category as Tomboy or Tomgirl
Which well, she is
The latter is still played as though Kirika is a girl
The other has a dick be an unintended side effect of Phonic Gain
One of them straight up has Kirika changing gender identity to become Kirio
*2
Okay so there’s 3 DMJii Fics with this premise
Eeeeeh
<@!102691114762371072> Probably because said character still acknowledges themselves as a girl
Has me kind of worried
That “barring use of opposite” thing you said
<@!102691114762371072> you wouldn’t happen to be one of those people who believe that there are an infinite amount of genders are you?
I really do
I do accept that
Sounds like you’re making a big assumption that people are doing that maliciously
No reason to get offended
I’d just correct you on that
But I do acknowledge that they exist
Not the individual
The mindset
But I’m not
Again, they’re still people
I don’t think highly of the non-binary mindset but I’d never be an asshole to a non-binary person about it
I just said that Trans people are still people
Wait I’m not a bigot
I’ve been in this mindset about a few months ago myself where I was wondering if I was actually a girl
But without a link to the biological sex then there wouldn’t be a transitional error now would it?
I’d never call a trans person or someone who claims to be non binary less than human
<@256945399338631168> Yes it does
But biologically you’re still either a guy or girl at any given time
Yeah but that’s because I’m referring to a group and not a single person
It sounds like a case of someone just wanting to stand out from the crowd
They’re a human being and should be recognised as such
But I don’t want to
I don’t want to call a human being “it” or “they”
You’re still either a He or She
What’s even a “non-binary gender”?
But even trans people can only transition from man to woman
Yes because I believe there’s only 2 and science backs me up on this
Humans are wonderful and diverse creatures after all
I’m saying that physically they’re either a male or female, I also acknowledge that people with that mindset exist
I acknowledge that they exist
What erasure?
Also I’m gonna need a source on those
The exception that proves the rule
At any given time, a human being can only be either a male body or a female body.
Much like your biological body
It’s almost like there’s a physical factor in place
Why aren’t you 40?
Just a rough estimate for an age
Just a test question
Okay then so let me ask you something then, how old are you?
No it’s 3
That’s what I believe
But yes there’s only 2 genders for a person at any given time
Sorry for getting you angry...
Sorry for offending you on that
I’m sorry
Wait what?
Male and Female
<@!102691114762371072> Because there is only 2 genders
But calling someone They or It sounds like I’m objectifying them
That’s it
Then I’ll refer to them that way
I’m totally cool with other races btw
Autocorrect is weird
Sorry sorry, catastrophic spelling mistake on my part
It’s not my intention to offend and I’m sorry if I did
I believe that only males and females exist biologically and that any mixed genders are more exceptions to the rule if anything. If someone I know wants me to call them a different gender because they’re starting to undergo changes or something then sure, I don’t mind
Well I’ll try to convey it anyway
So you can try and get where I’m coming from?
So do you want to hear my bottom line stance on this then?
If I ever do it’ll be an accident
Yes it is
If I knew someone like that in real life I’d ask them what do you want me to call you? Assuming that they’re a Friend at least
I’m not a mad scientist
I am asking them first
<@!99695384296701952> I’m not claiming to be an authority
Yes I do realise that <@256945399338631168>
Exceptions aren’t common, the two words literally contradict each other
Then again I’d need to hear their voice and examine a few other traits
They’re simply an exception
A male
Not really no
Right?
Even if you’re impotent, if you still have the traits of a male such as having a penis and testicals and you still have more male cells than female cells, I think it’s safe to assume that that person is a male biologically
Also yes the line is indeed that easy to draw
Because if I posted a screenshot of you saying something offensive without proper context it would look bad wouldn’t it?
Context is extremely important
Again, I need to know these specific cases that you’re referring to
I hope anyway
Even if a biological male develops breasts they’re still a male because functionally they’re still a male
No I’m not, don’t assume that just because I disagree it means that I’m trying to invalidate your existence
Absolutely not
Yeah but we’re not following their traditions now are we?
Even intersex flip between 2
What other genders can there be anyway?
Okay so chemical imbalances that create alterations in the body
Are you saying that gender is purely a mental thing?
I’m sorry, I have to stick with my beliefs, I do believe that there’s only males and females BUT you can call yourself whatever you want to, it’s not my place to judge you after all.
Okay let me phrase this in a way that’ll make you hopefully understand a bit better
I see them as people yes, I’d never say they’re not
<@!102691114762371072> It wasn’t my intention to make you angry, I didn’t know it was a really sensitive topic for you
Then I’m sorry if I am
I’d never make them feel that
But I’m not trying to be hateful
Man I’m terrible at expressing myself
I’m truly sorry if I’ve made you angry
Even if I’m not all that into rap myself...
Hell I think Black People generally have cool voices
