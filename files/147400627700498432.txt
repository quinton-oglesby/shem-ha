thank you
Somewhat tangential to theme. Homemade beef stroganoff
it's a good cart, and only about 40 bucks on Amazon
Maybe a slightly different sort of thing, but I'm currently putting together a cart to organize all my own paint and model supplies and hardware.

very early WIP, but I'm working on a set of headphones for a friend's Akane Shinjo cosplay.

Luckily you can get that exact thing from the Extreme Gundam.
which I can say with experience, I had/have the old BTR Demolishor from Armada
Kre-O... wasn't good.

It was substantially better than Built to Rule... but that's not saying much
she looks like she's about to cause mischief
These things are at least kind of good for parts, like the faces and faction insignias
I actually own this one
https://tfwiki.net/mediawiki/images2/5/56/BTR-Demolishor.jpg
They're... better than the last time they tried... which isn't saying much
well yeah, the official kreo builds are all awful
certainly less headache inducing than something like Devastator
I'm looking forward to the Ur
yeah, SG has some complex character design
indeed. Currently in the process of piecing one together myself for a con ntext year
and that's gonna be it, don't wanna spam the art thread with this stuff
never got her twintails right, but the bangs in the front are fairly solid.

the most surprising thing I learned from these tests is that the AI actually recognizes the term "Symphogear Pendant"
This one got shockingly close, to the point that I'm legitimately surprised
... So the AI can't recognize Miku, but does recognize Chris... okay then
it actually did a surprisingly alright job with the armor though, with a few tweaks some of the results I got could actually look like Gears
which led to loading in even more tags to try and make it look like the proper character
yeah, even though I put in as many tags as I could to specify the Miku I was talking about, the AI kept turning her into Hatsune Miku
Not actually claiming I did anything here, was just messing around with AI image gen to see if it could make a Miku. And the results were... mixed, to say the least.
people are speculating that the next episode, which was delayed, will be set during a formal dance, based on it's title: Shall We Gundam
for example, 16x9 is the aspect ratio used for wide screen TV
it's just Units, as those are pre-defines aspect ratios
That is basically the exact kind of results I got trying to do Miku too, so I feel your pain
That artist is really goin ham with the Ryuki Hibiki drawings
and all of it is a reference to the original box art
https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/doom/images/9/91/TITLEPIC.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20140323153207
there's a lot happening there
they did an announcement, AI art can be posted in User Creation or Fancontent as long as it's specifically noted to be AI gen, and AI based shitposts can be posted in the shitpost channels
surprised it did so well with the hair. Eyes are a big jank, as to be expected. 

Just... nevermind, someobe beat me to it

most of the first half of the show is pretty episodic though, so it would be easy to just watch 1 or 2 episodes at a time
as well as a Kanade redesign for the same AU
they did 2 designs for each of their gears, as well as an X Drive
Well we have established that Hibiki picks her friends by how well they've attempted to kill her
they don't get to count that until they actually succeed at least once
I might actually use this idea for something in my own fic. God knows those three need something to actually do in the story
Going back to this for a second, now I have to wonder which of the three would be most likely to actually throw hands with Hibiki. Probably Kuriyo, if the Mechvaranus event is any indication?
I do think I remember seeing something like that for Bikki though, might have been in a doujin or fanfic
that might have been mentioned somewhere, but at least in the show itself the reasons she gives for attending Lydian were that she got to stay with Miku, it provided a chance to meet Tsubasa, and that the tuition was cheap so it wouldn't put unnecessary burden on her family
... This just suddenly put the thought in my head of a whole series of prequel events where the Stroganettes were part of the bullies that harassed Hibiki after she survived the concert, but slowly came around after actually getting to know her
Yumi tried to turn this into an isekai
which... just makes it all the more likely that Yumi tried something...
true, she did help build the chateau
seriously though, the only friends of hers that we don't know for certain have made a play for her life are Elfnein and the Strogannettes
that one almost worked, a few centimeters to the left and she wouldn't have made it to the ER
Miku came closer than anyone
Yuuya also has a version of Kanade within this AU as well.

hmm...
"I came here to laugh at you"
so basically evil version of Hibiki from the world inside the mirrors
looks like it's an homage to Kamen Rider Ryuga
at first I thought they'd just swapped hair styles... and then I looked a little further down
That is a cursed statement, and you know it
I mean, one chapter has her hiding aphrodisiac chocolat to have for dinner
she has a very dry sarcastic wit to her, which is gonna be fun to here from Aoi
it's a story set in ancient China. The main character, MaoMao, is the daughter of an apothecary who is forced into becoming a servant in the imperial palace. Due to her skillset with medicine, literacy, and deductive reasoning, she gets roped into solving mysteries
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gquRl13WryU don't know if this got shared already, but Apothecary Diaries is getting an anime from Toho, with Aoi Yuuki playing the protagonist MaoMao
he's got a couple other Symphogear covers as well
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qrS6hMeByU Ver got rhythm, who knew
