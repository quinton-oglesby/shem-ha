(looks at pile of 25 giga hearts and 38 giga dex)
3
i just need 3 more
then I get nothing good...
depending on the stage - I can last up to 40 turns
yeah I can only auto her now
carol is being very tight on my miracles üò¶
<:TikiPraise:672430544381935625>
üôÇ
if i get lucky on a few more miracles ill come back
that one went better
ok done lasted till 17 turns
that stuff
get rid of ignite bikki because she tickled it
ie - move p basa to sub
see if i can do better by mixing a few things up since was first run
trying again with last 5p
yes
<:MariaSunglasses:336656798687690752>
my maria just burnt the entire way through
yeah just poking it atm - yeah my P basa dies fairly quick lol so need to make some adjustments
nah dont have you üò¶
whats ur id hazi ll bonk it
yahoo

it dead
Think I should be ok

should have dumped in 10 points, hopefully I can smack that much dmg in 5
ok im in
3 days of casual P carol raids and I got 1 giga magic crystal - so they do exist!
couldnt pick a better time
i like the other carol better
yahoo
Ty for raid griff <:ChrisHappy:660870796696223744>
<:ChrisSmile:336656717553074176>
your follwer list is full <@!142629493624799232>
is there round 2 <@!165030821353226240> ? <:HibiMikuPeek:661660014288568361>
76k hp now
games is still up
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
at what cost
160 geahs were sacrificed
<:MariaConfident:336657338729627658>
after it, start another one and ill bully it
others should now hop onto it and finish it off
üê≥
hehe
oh wait nvm, can only have 1 active at a time
hahaha
<:ChrisHappy:660870796696223744>
cool found ya
and free up some room on your followers list so people can follow to find it
just a screenshot of the raid, invite all (youll see it at end of raid), and post your account ID
I got some cp points to spare, so if you want to start one now I can join
I cant remember but theres a % of dmg you need to do to get contribution
and if you get last hit on raid, hunt roll as well
and you'll get challenge
or you  can start a raid post it here, and one of us could give you a hand with it
and get the participation and if possible, contribution drop
yeah its just going to take a little, all you can do is hop onto others raids
send wave after wave of gears at them until they reached their limit and shut down
sell memoirs you dont need
üê≥
now I got 38
I had like a 2 day dry streak on giga mircles
keep raiding
Oops believe these are yours
yeppp
when you lu 5* thats when things get fun
yeah limit unlocked 4* better then current base 5*
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
thats gonne be fun with all 3
im guessing erenbikki buffed xd bikki and vice versa
how many turns did u take earlier <@!127991170201681920> ?
im hitting it but it will take awhile - at 37 turns atm
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
fire up another one
gets you both
participate in the raid and do a % amount of damage to get contribution
it likely dead
just that when its hp drops it gets harder to hit for non heart types
alrighty fire away
Anyone want to start a T raid for me to bonk? The hunt continues
Round 3 T raid up - will bonk it to under 1m
Edit - Cleared
thanks pokelabo
Got this up - will hit it again to bring it under 1m
Edit - Cleared
T is down, will post again when I have another up
Got this up
% amount is under 10, but cant recall exact figure
you pick
or I can smack the carol
<:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
<@!143066614919725058> want to start another one lol, that one timed out
dont have you added, might need to clear a spot üôÇ
anyone want a raid smacked, got some cp to spare
yep followed so should see it now
plenty of room for improvement, but for now its holding ok my rag tag team
by the time it reaches subs the T boss starts critting high, so its like an ehhh factor then lol
LU XD Maria, LU XD Bikki, LU XD Jii, Sub: LU H Comet Spear Bikki, Lvl 34 P Jii, and LU Ignite Bikki
no too sure on that, I just throw my geahs at it and see what happens
<:ChrisHappy:660870796696223744>
10/10 would jump on that raid if it was a random
yeah that will be dead soon, under 1m is great because usually the scorers are low or gone
you might want to smack it if u want to keep ur high rank dmg <@!226853436979806208>
I failed to kill it, 108k hp left <:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
ok no prob
<@!226853436979806208> micha is dead, I can finish off if u want
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
i have no pinks so I just brute force
ill wack it
P Carol was painful for me earlier, the burns, blindness and often both
sorry, gotta farm CC for the magog ill prob never use
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
üê≥ mat packs

yeap
<:ChrisHappy:660870796696223744>
I havent done any dex raids yet, I got all my dex crystals from Dex Carol
and by dps I mean units that are LU that can do damage haha
then sub is 2 other dps and another healer, tho by the time I reach sub healer the boss is at a point where most hits do lots of dmg)
for main
usually I try to aim for 2 dps and 1 healer
157k hp left on it
ill hit it as well
same <:YrrowF:583699765519187970>
<:MillaarcSmile:672845884135833610>
Whacking the t raid seems like a good idea as you‚Äôll get t crystals for ur bikki and fantasys but that boss isn‚Äôt too friendly with the charm so it will take a bit
If you need fantasy - yeah hmm
For the giga ints
Yeah it is fantasy just doubled check, just go ham on magic carol
Oh she needs miracles my bad thought it was fantasy
So hang in there as you keep working through
Raids gets easier the more lv70 units you have generally
Yeah
I‚Äôd prob do P carol so u get your miku to lu70, u got a decent team for carol. Just keep chugging away at her
From card list
If u screenshot your high level units we could prob see what we can do with ur team
ok this is nuts, 28k crit using XD bikki
ez
whoever can wack in 5cp wins
oh well
im still selecting my team
nooo
ill take the P carol - gotta test an int team <:VanessaCracked:639136452600397829>
spin some up and we can wack it
its dead btw, 5 turns 1 cp <:ChrisHappy:660870796696223744>
im gonna bonk a ruby raid first and come back to the normal one if its still up
<:VanessaCracked:639136452600397829>
lmao yeah.. I think I went a little too hard on this game

<:TsubasaFish:689163064830066696>
dead - want to fire up another one?
mine
<:TikiPraise:672430544381935625>

EVA starts off really slow as well
<:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
I havent actually rewatched it, which is rare for me as I end up rewatching a lot
I do recall that as well, took off a bit slow
^
<:ChrisSmile:336656717553074176>
go watch
yeah it will take you on a ride
that was a fun blast the first time
gurren lagan?
mhmm to rewatch that again fresh would be good
<:MariaChuckle:672465496515411984> dont want to upset a country now do you
it did the sister arc better
Shinseiki Evangelion Gekijouban: The End of Evangelion is an alternate version of the series ending, which either supplements or replaces episodes 25 and 26, depending on how they are viewed.
actually its better explained like this
not a recap
nah the end of eva was the sequel
then you got the rebirth movies after?
is that the movie after the tv series
<:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
