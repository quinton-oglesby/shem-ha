possible emote?
kk <:HibikiPadoru:516438720082346004>
here is another one I made right now if you want to use it
ah! sorry!
yes

possible emote?
<:Wao:487470487828430848>
or
Emote Suggestion?
especially for mobile
I certainly think so
Would this be a good emote? I scaled it to emote size. I have a 4K version of this transparency I made if you would want that instead.
<:LackOfRice:498719896373428244>
I spent too much time making all these silly emotes lmao

Possible Emotes?
sorry about that
emote sized and ready to go




Remastered a few more because I realized some important ones were missing. If there are too many already I understand
<a:NYNThankYou:555560030943051796> hope you enjoy!
<:Praise:391038800232448000>
I had much better methods this time for remastering them so the newer miku should be much crisper
feel free to pick which Chris you might like more
those should all be emote size
enjoy <:HibikiHug:620080558462205956>








marry padoru
also the original miku padoru I gave you guys I remastered too so it might want to be replaced
I can totally post them
I have gathered and remastered all the Padorus I could find. If you guys want them, let me know and I can post them for emote use
hopefully they look nice fixed up
they were all posted with a feel free to use for anything type thing but I had to go and clean them all
then I cleaned it up
like here was a source image I had
some of these were really crunchy when I got them
I'm just remastering and cleaning
my accounts are all linked
no I mean I dont know who that is
who?
Thanks for the fix up
<:MikuWhoa:670502684692054042>
Glad you liked them!
Oh even the smaller one?
I just care a lot about the edges mostly
big true
there we go


oops accidentally missed a shadow
there we go
lemme remove the branches from mine
I would agree but the edges are a little crunchy
here is the full I did in case you want to adjust the cropping
HibikiGay?
Miku Whoa
that's a shame
what about this cropped?
Potential Emote?
When Miku says the rice is ready
<a:BikkiSteppy:681651853053788236>

<@!203705656321114112> and I worked together to make this and if you guys wanted to use it as an emote, you are more than welcome! Here is the emote size
<:SaluteTougou:623006945493778433>
I just did the chris because of AC

other than Symphogear, one of my favorites
it's a good show
here is the clip https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6lazsBS-PI
kinda sorta

*especially because they do actually kiss once*
might be a harder ship
have you seen Rinne no lagrange?
<:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
can't wait for hibiki to save miku, call her a "good friend", and then we all cry as the credits roll

Sugoi
It's only dead when we stop loving it
It has and will never do wrong
Could never hate it
<:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
Alright so are we starting a gofundme to buy the franchise from the publisher and fund season 6 ourselves?
<:WhyThis:599795453344874506>
I miss it so much
The shorts always made Miku about 20x gayer so if they made shorts AFTER what happened it would be insane
To stop now would be odd
I'd be very excited
<a:TougouShake:623715093154234406> <a:TougouShake:623715093154234406> <a:TougouShake:623715093154234406>
What's the chances of them doing XV shorts like how season 1 showed what happened after the end of that
<:SaluteTougou:623006945493778433>
Epilogue movie would be incredible
<:ApproveNogi:623689908103675914>
<:Hug2:495875369266577408>
This is only the beginning
To believe this is the end is naive and shallow
I believe it will continue long into the future
This community is stronger than most anime
Stop being so negative. Hibiki wouldn't want that
And the never ending scream for more merchandise
Fanart and this community's love will keep it going
Only dead when we stop loving it
These characters are a fundamental aspect of my personality
Glad I was able to contribute 18 emotes to this server
I love this fandom
<:KirikaShout:607741871703457812>
2 at most
That makes them identical <:MikuGay:336656810788388864>
Which is essentially Symphogear since they both have a punch wife and both are gay
Ok, time to jump onboard the Yuuki Yuuna is a Hero fandom
They aren't that poorly planned
Long before
Even then
Contracting animation is rare in crunch time
Absolutely
~~no but we can dream~~
"Actually" in terms of this is an "official" frame
I probably wouldn't have my actual significant other or my YouTube channel without it
I owe so much to this show
Very
Yes
Cheers to hoping one of the artists on board the project goes rogue and releases an alternative ending <:CheerNogi1:623308422120734730><:CheerNogi2:623308448930725898>
<a:MikuQuake:605209236082786355>
And are an official animator now
I can't believe they got a job at the studio last second
That's a spoiler because it's canonical
|| yeah they are all grown up as season 2 takes place years after season 1. There was a accident and serval lost all their memories. Most likely eaten by the bad things. Kaban didn't forget though but knows serval doesn't remember her. It's very emotional||
I mean, spoiler here, || kaban shows up later ||
It was still fun
It was definitely a neat plot mechanic to essentially allow them to remake the same show twice but at the same time
All is mostly explained
It didn't erase anything
No
Nah season 2 was really fun
I like Macross for the music
I see it more Magical girl before that
I Macross <:NazCheers:589649196907233310>
I just said it was similar in terms of how it focuses on the characters more than the plot points
I didn't say it was a Mecha
I didn't like how they tried to push all the past villains of the show onto us like they were suddenly good guys now
Characters are the focus
Like season 1 of Symphogear
It does have mechs but the characters are the focus of Rinne no Lagrange not the mechs
Very very very very gay
Check it out
Rinne no Lagrange
But also not just slice of life
*with a kiss*
And very very gay
Now if you want a show that's just gay
It shouldn't have stopped <a:MikuQuake:605209236082786355>
Good stuff
I always thought of it as Symphogear X Madoka X Strike Witches
Just kinda twisted
Not gory like Madoka tho
But does get psychological
It's gay and has cute characters
Very similar to Madoka
Her powered up form is literally identical to Hibiki's golden outfit
<:FeelsNogi:623307835190673448>
^
Also a Punch Wife
Very similar fighting alternate magical girl type things.
It has similar elements to Symphogear
<:ApproveNogi:623689908103675914> good stuff
<:Homies5:623008040702181376><:Homies6:623008050814386216>
Gotta ride YuYuYu now
Make it more realistic
Because we want to keep this at least a little bit sort of canonical-*like*
<:Homies3:616410571142725662><:Homies4:616410580974043175>
Time to hire some talented non-h Doujin artists to make us an epilogue
pls pls pls
We have hope

I was on the Tsubasa X Chris side for a while but this season convinced me I was wrong
In the end the harem all go gay for each other and leave chris alone
<:HibikiShock:336656371611074580>
<:HeadPat:388949660892397588>
<a:BearPensive:585614908834578492>
And Carol was the one who reactivated them right?
I feel even worse now
Man
they literally just
YOU RIGHT
I guess if you aren't human, you don't get to be in the finale
Upsetting how only the organic villains showed up
It would have been very Eva "Congratulations" like
^
That would have been nice
Even if it was just "you can do it!" Or "we believe in you"
Should have spoken! They all should have said at least 1 thing
Seemed like a waste
I wish Kanade had a single line of dialogue
<:KanadeSit:535301654464036884>
Safety Dess - HD Remastered
We need a dess one
If they can have a Sugoi compilation
We need an HD dess compilation
<:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
Man I took today off because I knew it was gonna get too tense
Now we can officially compile every single time Kirika ever DESSed into one long video
There is one tiny good thing about Symphogear ending now
That works
<:MikuPraise:585839808765493249>
That's carol
Walk√ºre is such a good group
Very gay
Watch Rinne no Lagrange to fill the holes
Watch YuYuYu to fill the hole
<a:TougouShake:623715093154234406>
<:HugYuki:623006669127024658>
Carry on
Yes you are right my mistake
Wasn't the entire point of them fighting because they had a hard time understanding one another and that was because of the curse? Miku was accept as the body because she thought that was the only way to be understood. So after defeating everything, they still can't confess???? I feel like that was a slap in the face
I just wanted a confession
She's not nearly horny enough
Would overwhelm them
Kanade is too powerful for the rest of the cast
What if <:GenjurouThumbsUp:267393750349643776> adopts Chris
We all must buy so they see how loved the show is and then make more content
Symphogear was great to me for how insanely good the characters, their development, and their relationships are
No matter what
Being tied down to one thing for long is tiring
I imagine it's less they dislike it but more they want to explore other projects
Can you believe some people think Hibiki is straight
True
Probably nothing for a long time
So it's ok
In lagrange they ACTUALLY kiss
Macross Delta essentially works like that
Mostly gay
As a side gig
thank you <:Bless:392520299968593941>
LOL
