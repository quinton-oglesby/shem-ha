So it makes sense
Forums were in many ways where things worked best
If it's fine to post stuff in <#371105434771390465> that'd be fine. Basically I have an idol convention I want to plug to anisong nerds ;p
Ahhh
Could there be any sort of meetups or conventions channel? I sooort of want to shill an idol convention I am running and would love generalistic 'Oh hey this con has symphogays content' but there doesn't seem to be an appropriate channel to post such in
This is like the nazi issue in the Pony fandom which I have always found just batshit
I miss the early days of the internet when you could do this because those sorts were a laughable non-entity rather than a major threat like now
And nothing would please me more than to watch it crumble
As a wild Murrican I would love it too, because it might mean Facebook dies faster
In a boils your blood sort of way
It's amazing isn't it
Such is life
The elite always have double standards
some I can tell, some I shouldnt
I have many many convention stories from over the years, hah
then we were at some restaurant guy fieri had reviewed or something
Haha no, I met Jenny nicholson
That w as a very weird night
I ended up in some restaurant with her at like 2 AM once because Guy Fieri went there
Jenny is an interesting person
It would be so nice
So its nost as if any government involved has clean hands
Now also that yea, imperialist butthole behavior in general
I guess my main point is that eastern WW2 is pretty much Japan's fault, since they emerged fine from WW1 and then kinda...yea. Lol
Yep
They nibble and nibble until the camel has had enough and kicks back
I mean, we're seeing ti with Russia now, like
Well, yea, thats how this always works
All I have read pretty much boils down to 'Japan thought they could get away with it so they did'
Well, you can't entirely separate the two, but
Heck, there's an argument to be made Woodrow Wilson's stroke causes WW2
I mean, sure, if we want to talk WW2 overall then the western theater is a direct result of Britain & France being morons during the treat of versailles
And like, unless you are willing to go in and die yourself - see, well, Ukraine, now - there's not much you can do if someone else is willing t o go in and attack a place save cut off their economy and apply the pain
The League of Nations was entirely toothless
I mean, the cause of WW2 in the Pacific side was imperial Japanese aggression, the oil embargo just sped things up
Is there a source? I cant find anything on that googling it
It's a kick in the gut to hear every time something like this happens, and I am always sad because I know how hard the fight is.

I'm...luck, I suppose, in that there was a time, years ago, when my head was doing really bad, that I was...prepping, for lack of a better word. And during that, I had this moment of epiphany of realizing that no, I actually did want to live, deep down. And so I backed off and managed to reach out and ask for help.

That was almost 10 years ago, now. I bring it up because sometimes the old demons come back to claw at me, but anytime they do, it's like that moment becomes a rock I can cling to. That I know that, no, no matter how I feel in that blue moment, I have already faced it and made my choice.

In that sense, I think myself lucky, because while I still have to keep fighting the war, I know I can stick it out. And I'm always saddened for those who find the pain is too great before they find their anchors.

If anyone needs to reach out just to let shit out, and it's easier to do it to someone you don't know that well, feel free to poke.
Oh that's really wonderful to see
Or more accurately, the least-losing moove
They win by making Russia bleed as hard and as much and as fast as possible that they realize the only winning move is to back off.
Yea, this...does not end well, but the Ukrainians are kind of going all-in that the only winning move is 'not a step back' and there are almost certainly right
And at that point they start finding it skeevy/uncomfy :/
Like I def have friends who like anime up until the point of too much fanservice
Because it is definitely fairly ecchi and in 2022 that makes it harder to shill to people who you don't already know will give the ecchi a pass :p
Symphogear is Queer Lady Catnip so it makes sense. That is what brought me from 0 to 2000 in 3 weeks or so
As long as this situation doesn't destabilize into a nuclear exchange because if it does...ugh
That's not something they will be able to sustain for long
Like 'worst battles of WW2 levels of death/casualties' for them
But at the same time this is an insane bleed rate for Russia
Putin will do all he can to not fall because if he does he probably dies
It's...complicated
I've been there. Anxiety is the worst and I still fight it every single day pretty much. It's like I have to charge up energy to smash through it, and once I have that /specific thing/ gets easier...but the next new thing will be hard :/
I will take 'at least doesn't want to kill me for existing' over the alternatives ;/
There is a lot that be Not Great, but
Yes, and yes, because a lot of them at least largely practice what they preach in terms of compassion and so on
There is a lot I dislike about Mormonism but something about it /has/ served as a shield against the insanity that has eaten the rest of the party
and I will note Utah is the sanest Republican state by far
However, it is Utah
Unfortuantely you are not
Shit's fucked in the FP here
I could totally see it in America in < 10 years
Or maybe we're just in the 1000th timeline and where Chiwa Saito finally saved her <:MadoAYAYA_MM:628639133731913759>
There was actually a pope who went around knocking dicks off a bunch of statues at one point
And that was cause they wanted to be accurate but the Church wasnt gonna look too kindly on people sporting horse anatomy
Not ancient greece
David is from the Renassaince
History is full of very smart people inventing things, and then very stupid people setting them on fire for it
He basically invented science
Aristotle is why Eureka is a phrase still
The what now
Caesar can mean either of them
Nah cause Augustus blurs that
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristotle
Well you are one of today's lucky 10,000!
<:DMJiiPeek:781967661088899094>
And Kanye as well
Aristotle gets to be there with Drake & Madonna
Even Julius Caesar requires two names
Aristotle is one of the most famous guys, like, ever
I think it's more teasing you because - yea that
Rocky Rocky
Okay yes that one does work tyvm
In the same way
wait this doesnt work
John Wick
and of course
John Rambo
Arnold Terminator
And other such heroes as
Aristophanes I want to say
But yea looking briefly, beyoooond that, lmao
No afaik he definitely existed
Even better it was his Socrates Tulpa so he made one of a real person
Genjuurou's dad
In other words, Fudo Kazanari
He's kinda used as shorthand for 'manipulative uncaring parenting who only sees you through the lens of investment to get what they want out of you'
Neon Genesis Evangelion's dad
In far too many ways
My dad is basically Gendo Ikari
Yea. For me it was, well
You find the rocks you can cling to in the middle of the storm, and you hold on until the thunder and lightning subsides
I've survived it until now, and if I have endured it this long, I can keep enduring it as long as I have to
Truthfully, I have lots of damage I don't know how to heal, and have just resigned myself to enduring - what keeps me going there is that I am determined to prevent and/or help what I can for people like me so they have it better, in some small way, than I did
And we live in a world that makes it very, very hard to heal
What you are is hurt, and hurt badly, and you do not know how to move forward because of that hurt
You are not worthless, and you are not a burden, and anyone telling you that is being shitty
I spent a large portion of my high school years looking over stairwells pondering just yeeting myself headfirst over them.
Anime is full of people like us writing stories about people like us for people like us
Exactly
Fighting through all of that conditioning, all of that bullshit, all of the flat out lies about yourself society does its best to grind into you? Defying that all is /hard/, but I am living proof it is both doable and liberating as hell when you finally realize that society is uh, wrong, like, most of the time
Part of the reason anime is so vibrant is that it is one of the few places in JP culture people are /allowed/ to express themselves without inhibition, so stuff that is bottled up everywhere else is given the outlet there
'Wake up, go to school/work, generate profit for business leaders, retire and die, within whatever acceptable cultural constraints exist in your specific neck of the woods'
And being broken by life is sadly far too common, because so many people are entitled, judgemental assholes who will hurt you if you dont fit into the narrow box they want you to be in
A big part of the /entire story/ is about how society fucked up Hibiki when she never did anything wrong, and her overcoming that trauma is kind of her core character arc
Like, you are in Symphogear, so gonna use metaphors from that:
Eh, and? Nothing wrong with that, if you are willing to move past it
'Fake it till you make it' is a mantra for a reason
What worked for me was finding people who had things I did not, that I thought were worth having - social skills, whatever - and I studied them and just imitated them until I realized I finally got /it/, whatever the specific it was
There is no easy way to doing that. Teaching yourself you do have that power is hard and I won't bullshit ya by saying otherwise, but you are capable of doing it
The trick to it is just : When the clouds come and the voices of self-doubt claw at you, you have to cling to whatever rock you have, until you can gather the strength to force your way through them once more
And getting over that doubt, and realizing you can succeed? Hard, takes years, some people never do it
And I can speak less to the UK educational system, save to say it isnt too late to do anything. Step one to moving forward is realizing that the biggest barrier to success is your own self-doubt
definitely not the American system
I am guessing you are UK-based from the lingo you are using
And? College without knowing what you want is just a piece of paper and debt
You learn how you work, you learn what you value, you learn what has hurt you and how you can overcome that (or at least avoid it repeating itself), and eventually, you realize what you /want to do/ with life
So been there, done that, it is never too late to get things going. Step one is figuring yourself out, which is hard AF, but is key to actually making things work
I didnt actually get my life going until like, 27
Okay time to put on my Maria hat as I am OLD (in my 30s)
When it is so much more fun to go MENTOS AND COKE LETS GO
Being a jerk about lack of knowledge is just being a jerk
^ This comic is basically how you should approach people not knowing something
https://xkcd.com/1053/
Yea it has a colloquial meaning of that these days for sure
I am just not an idiot because I recognize my own ignorance and thus keep my mouth shut about things I don't know anything about
Heck no, I am ignorant AF about 99.99999% of all knowledge out there, nothing wrong with that, I just havent had time / teaching to absorb it yet
Ignorance is easily curable, idiocy is often a terminal condition
It's only when you don't know a thing and refuse to learn that you are an idiot
nothing wrong with being ignorant as long as you are willing to learn
Nah if you didnt get educated in the right places you wont run across this (or are non-western)
Of course the stupid people are /still/ trying to set them on fire, this time they are just doing it with climate change so we all get to be on fire together
Yea the Renaissance was basically them going 'lets remake all the good classical stuff without collapsing this time' and enough of them managed to not get set on fire that, well, now we have computers
The moron got himself killed over it, which I have some hope will make other people think twice
Never give up on Hope.
Keep moving forward.
If you can't believe in yourself, believe in your friends who believe in you
IMO they provide some of the most valuable lessons.
So much of anime, the hopeful parts of it, is people like us painting a picture of how things could be, and if that feels right to you, do not let go of it. That stuff can be a rock to hold onto in times of crisis, and a model to follow in living your own life. I basically have adopted Anime Protagonist mentality in many ways, and the thing is it /works/ - as long as you take time to be considerate of those around you, and ask them how you can be a better friend/whatever
But yea, for anyone else that may be helpful for: A shitton of us weebs are traumatized by our upbringings, and we gravitate towards anime because the stories, the worlds, the characters & relationships and everything is what we instinctively recognize is exactly what we want
Trust me on this 🙂
Look saying Gendo destroys the world spoils nothing
Yep that's fine 🙂
They are in good company together
Gendo kind of destroys the world, so yea
A big fakeout in Symphogear early on is 'Is Genjuro Gendo 2.0' and the eventual reveal is 'Nope, Fudou is'
If you had a sufficiently large seed of people playing the cooperative game theory strat they will outcompete the compete strategists
Capitalism doesn't fail because it is capitalism, it fails because people are greedy and selfish and so routinely take 'more now for me, less now for you, and less later for us both' over 'Okay for me, okay for you, more later for us both'
Because in the end it is vulnerable to the same issues every single other political or economic system is : They are populated by humans, who are stupid and selfish and dumb
Yea some of the critiques against capital ring a lot stronger than the advocacy for Communism as a system
Yea I'm deep in the US version of it, but the point about Euro breaking up is a good one and one I dont have an informed response for, so need to do some research & pondering anyhow ❤️
It was educamational
Anyhoo, time to go out to art museum, thank you for the debate ❤️
I'll give you that, tho I think its also 'people just are not meant to be in a world this networked and most of them are breaking from it'
Like, we would live in a very different world had we never gone into Vietnam and thus destroyed Johnson's Great Society before it gets off the ground
With Iran, Stagflation, the oil crisis, etc all running
Yea, but Carter also wasn't exactly in a great spot for winning votes
anyone who was 20 or older by 1930 - and thus an actual adult through the whole depression - is 70+
But also like, by the time Carter/Reagan is happening
Oh and then 3P I guess
Since the X axis isnt revealed
What is the chart showing here
Like for all the 'people will just vote' the reality is that if everyone actually did the effort of educating themselves, determining their interests, and voting accordingly the rich would have their stranglehold break, but lots of people get charmed or suckered in or seduced by their BS, and so are complacent in things remaining fucked
See, the lens i see it through is different:
In the 50s, political power was held by people who lived through the Great Depression and thus saw directly what happened when you trusted the elites with too much power.

By the 80s, political power was held by their children, who grew up in the world of plenty made by their parents, and since said children /didnt/ have the direct experience to know to distrust the snake oil salesman sorts, they promptly fell for Reaganite lies and have continued doing so since
(Although time is running short, need to get going in about 10)
What I expect to see happen here is that as the climate gets worse and more people feel that pinch, the 'we need to act or die' crowd will gain a lot more power and then it becomes a question of how effective they are when they get enough to really wield it
Like the US /had/ a top marginal tax rate of 90% in the 50s. Then we kind of had the racial justice era and the republicans peeled away all the racists, and combined with the multiple competing factions that sprouted up things began spinning slowly out of control.
Yea but like, this was making consistent headway in the US from 1930 till the 70s, and then Reagan kind of undid all that
Like, the way I kinda see things is:
1) We have a climate clock running. Nothing changes this, this is now the big existential threat
2) Anything that would seriously damage the supply chain makes successfully stopping the climate clock far less unlikely
3) Therefore, serious revolution simply isn't viable. We don't have the time to sort out the aftermath, and history shows revolutions in general collapse into violence way too often
4) Thus, the only way is to work within the current system, at least enough to leave it standing while surgery is done on it
Yea, people kinda got complacent and let themselves (And by people I mean the boomers) be tricked into thinking that shit would fly
FPTP is what enables extremism to win repeatedly; fiduciary duty as is is what lets Team 3 players force corporations off of a Team 1 or Team 2 strategy; and making housing more affordable in general reduces everyone's financial burdens which reduces stress levels, as part of why things are so frayed is everyone feels so /pinched/ and insecure-feeling people simply have less emotional energy to spend on things like empathy and compassion
You could massively accelerate unfucking the US by removing first past the post voting, changing the laws around corporate fiduciary duty (thus changing the incentive structure in the C suite, and more importantly exposing them to lawsuits from other entities who will hold shareholders in check) and banning private equity from owning single family homes (and generally updating zoning/housing policy in general to block NIMBYism)
Whereas a 2) is like 'They will work their ass off for anyone who they trust to have their back when they need help'
But a lot of them arent smart or not nearly as smart as they think they are or are just controlled by their emotional impulses and so they can't really break out of category 3 because that requires more willpower than they have
The smart ones dont do strategy 3 because it gives them less on net
Basically it's an evolution of the bit that building something well is way harder than breaking it
The problem is actually getting enough people to get that successful seed rolling, because keepign 1 /going/ means slowly converting 2s into 1s while also making sure 3s dont infiltrate and corrupt stuff
1) is literally the mathematically optimal strategy once you have enough participants
Like I can't speak as much to non-US policy, but simply changing US Law so corporations no longer have only a fiduciary duty but also a duty to welfare of employees & communities they are located in would do a lot
It's not the be all end all root cause of the systemic issues.
Like don't get me wrong, I do not think capitalism is the ideal system whatsoever, and the best one we could implement is probably some form of market socialism, but
Humans imo break down into one of 3 groups:
1. 'Help everyone'
2. 'Help those I know/trust' aka 'Help your neighbors/tribe'
3. 'I'm in it for me and me alone'
Engineering systems in general to shield against the excesses of human behavior is hard as hell, although ranked choice goes a long way in helping that
I didnt. i didnt realize it was the same person
wait wait wait wait I remember this oh god
is good thing NFTs are basically dead
GCs are just the way TERFs rebranded themselves to sound less like bigots
Idk, its cool to me to see someone being a fan of hers 'in the wild' so to speak
Though you are prob familiar with the Tombstone version
Odyssey wrote it <:Suhaha:382043897431588865>
Yea that is how I know her, we both go way back in Ponydom
I'm sorry you gotta deal with that 😦

Though I am glad you got the Odyssey merch, she is awesome and I have been a fan of hers for like a decade
lmao
Yea but ep count 😮
Ping me when you finish last ep, I want to hear reactions to that <:YuunaExcited:233710779021393921>
I can agree w/that!
Honestly I am glad they ||skipped right to them getting inted because it meant them ripping the bandaid off right away since NoWaYu is far more brutal than the others|| and overall I ❤️ S3 so much
It is mostly the power of having multiple staff whales
<:RukoFufu:487283860409942017>
Having a good decade of conrunning experience by that point did not hurt :p
Thank you! I basically got tired of anime cons having like, 1-2 hours all weekend of idol stuff, so in the proud tradition of Bender from Futurama, I started my own~
Panel applications are still open for anyone interested in coming who might want to host anything!
Basically I want more anisong nerds and Symphogear is like, ❤️ and need more attendees from that fanbase so it has more Symphogear-focused content
I founded & run an Idol Convention in Seattle, Washington, USA (Think anime convention, get rid of all non-idol content, and make it 3 days of idols!) : Northwest IdolFest.

Our website is at https://idolfe.st/ and we're returning for our 2nd year this October. We focus on JP & North American idols, last year we had ~100 people for our debut event and this year we're looking at 250-500. The website has all the info as well as links to all our social media outlets on bottom left

It's in easy walking distance of the airport, and has a free hotel shuttle as well. Headline VIPs this year include Kaho Shibuya (She does a million cool things), Rintaichou (Love Live/Genshin fandom stuff), and Phoebe (Vtuber/3D NA Idol) among others. Happy to answer any questions (Just @ me because I am as scatterbrained as Hibiki) people might have.
Since Symphogays is Magical Girl Mecha **Idol** Lesbians I figured this might be of interest to a few people
Like that has them in ||bathrobes and everything|| that one is completely impossible to explain in a het matter
That's where the other thing is much more in your face undeniable
JP's ability to insist queer is het is legendary tho
Yea that bit was p gay too
Oh right THAT bit
Ohhhh
...I think I missed that one somehow
For LycoReco its ||When the reveal happens that the two male leads are lovers||
oh whoops my brain jumped threads
Superstar is the newest one with Liella, not Aqours
Where Mari gropes You and You judo throws her ass
You're thinking of Love Live Sunshine arent you
No where ||Sumire and Keke have their mutual confession||
Finally dethroning the 'Kanan proposes to Mari' moment from LLSS
Yea the most recent episode has the gayest scene Love Live has ever done
To me it requires a kiss or some kind of explicit romantic confession. So Love Live Superstar /almost/ got there in the most recent episode
Most of the time its 'We can tell they are almost certainly gay but they will never say it SO'
Yeeeeep
But its about as good as you can get without crossing into explicitly gay territory
Yea this is how I would put it. It's no YagaKimi which is the gold standard for Yuri IMO
But its THAT scene
There is definitely one scene there is no hetero explanation for at all
LycoReco is around the same level of gay as the first shot of HibiMiku in bed together, except it has a higher prevalence of such gayness than SG  does
There has not been THE KISS which imo is what canonizes the gays, but there has been lots of implied gay and one moment of 'Yep they are def gay' just not in the way you expect
This is also correct
This is correct
Rather than just ending on it. Its so obvious where its about to go, but they stop short of going there
Kiss or some kind of explicit unambiguous declaration of love. Like had Symphogear actually /showed/ us the convo Hibiki & Miku were going to have in XV
Korra kind of started opening the floodgates
Nah its much more than 4-5 per decade now
Western I cant say the proportion, but its less bait-ey about it in general
And a lot more that bait
But also like, anime tends to have 1-2 shows per year with posiive genuine queer rep
I mean as a general kind of thing its a coming of age coming out lesbean story
Its like that and Yuri Kuma
As anime adaptations go it p mmuch is
Bloom Into You / Yaga Kimi is how you do it right
But as an anime-only it was fairly frustrating dealing with it
Like Adachi and Shimamura I am sure eventually has them kiss, somewhere
you stay baited
I mean, yes, buuuuut if you arent going into the LNs
Anime/Games in general tend to shy away from actually making their yuri canon
Right but its always easier to gay up literature, it's a more permissive space in general, my comments are limited to the anime side of things
then its in the same bait-space that like, Love Live still sits in
I mean yea, but if it doesnt onscreen kiss
Otherside Picnic didnt canonize their gays IIRC. YuriKuma was definitely Queer AF but like in the last 10 years I can think of that, YagaKimi, and ZLS as the 'good' ones.

Citrus is, like, how to put it. Did I enjoy it? Yes. Do I recognize it is relentlessly horny trash that definitely will put some off due to the sheer thirst? also yes.

Sakura trick havent seen so cant comment on. But the issue isnt 'how gay' so much as 'does it allow gay to exist'. Sort of a Bechdel test for queer rep
Oh and cant forget Korra
Yea, but there's also She-Ra canonizing its gays, My Little Pony doing so (albeit a bit more subtly), even Disney is starting to throw stuff in from time to time. And streaming content is just all over the place in having that now
Western anim really started to get there with like Steven Universe and in recent years has had even stuff like /Arthur/ add queer rep. 

But also most western anim is targeted more towards kids, whereas plenty of anime is definitely made for an older audience and yet super queer stuff like YagaKimi or ZLS is still rare as heck
Trying to think what else in western was queer. The sheriffs in Gravity Falls were 100% gay but Disney wouldnt let them explicitly confirm it on screen IIRC
Memory is a fickle thing
Yea when I googled things yesterday someone had made an animated version called 'Korrasami finale kiss' and welp
My Little Pony has 2 confirmed instances (Scootaloo's Aunts, Lyra & Bonbon) although both are subtle (The aunts dont overtly say it but its kinda a 'come on', and LyraBon wedding is in the newspaper in the finale) and then it heavily implies AppleDash and maaaaybe Raritwi in the 'many moons later' scene.

And then Arthur of all things has Mr. Ratburn or w/e his name is have a gay wedding
welp my memories are off there since I could have sworn there was kiss but googling is failing me
Buuuuut. I think that while that may be the case in some cases, it is still a bit of a cop-out in many many many
Hnn, that is a lens I hadnt considered as much, seeing as flicking through some of the straighter stuff in my memory bank you rarely see the straight protags smooch either
LycoReco fits into ||BL||
haha I was about to say 'I scavenge for this stuff and the only things I can think of I havent seen yet are Flipflap and Trick'
But like most anime stuff, we are left with 'it is implied as heavily as we can this is what happens right after the cut, but we arent going to explicitly confirm it because itmight alienate the straights who want to ship themselves with <character>'
Had Symphogear ended the same way, we would have had that final scene be like
Miku : I need to tell you something
Hibiki : I know, come here
<Kiss>
Pan to the moon
Yea im not sure where it goes in the comics or not, but like
To the point that being straight in that series basically guarantees you are going to die or have an unhappy ending
and like She-Ra on Netflix is amazingly gay
There is no ambiguity there
A 'They look each other in the eyes and proceed to smooch'
That group is full of it, lol, like they most def end with a full on kiss
Just like, anime tends to have a weird aversion to doing anything that clearly canonizes the relationship as romantic
And mind you it doesnt have to be kiss, I am fine with the clear 'I love you lets date' w/e
And while SG implies it about as heavily as you possibly can
All I am saying is it never leaves implied territory
And the twitter genius who came up with it is a legend
That will be what I headcanon even if ||the actual reason is prob just 'JP loves Hawaii'|| but the spoiler reason is much better
Oh yea that is going to set a lot of imaginations up
Just give us S2 of ||Chisato pranking Fumi and Fumi being enraged||
I do enjoy how ||Mika's actions can provide a future drama hook if Chisato ever finds out||
Headcanoning that as the reason now
lmao
Lol that's great
Final Licorice was ||<3||
Majima is def a bro
There are two ogres
EVA is a trip
Okay cool then yea enjoy the ride
How limited is your EVA knowledge going through this outta curiosity
This
Also she's a robot and/or alien
Turning into a zombie and eating the judges
But yea, WEP was like watching an amazing gymnast routine, and then she stumbles, then trips, then misses her jump before twisting in the air shrieking and landing on her face and then for good measure...I dunno, something awful
It is still worth it for the great ones
Anime original, so I doooooont think you have, unless it was announced as in production years and years ago
Winter 2021
Oh and also there were no ||aliens behind it all|| which disappoints me
BNA was cute, and maybe its just I totally ❤️ Nazuna that badly, but my only real complaint is I wanted a Season 2
It is definitely not ancient tho
WEP is Wonder Egg Priority and it came out last year
And then the 'special' came along and just somehow made everything worse
The team tried
There was no saving the dogshit script
And never recovers
And then right after that wonderful scene, the show goes to total shit
Had weeks of 'fyi she's trans you guys' before the show drenched it in pride hues
I loved her, she was precious, I clocked her /immediately/
Momo was ❤️
WEP makes me so sad cause
YuuYuuYuuS3 is, imo, great. The only people I think who were unhappy were unhappy cause they wanted more time spent on NoWaYu and KuMeYu
Oh goddesses yes, WEP was SUCH a letdown
Yes
Thank you speech to text for spelling symphogears title wrong
And likes info gear, it's not necessary to know anything about the specific religion it's having fun with
Yuyuyu is also religious fanfiction but much more abstract where SG is busy trying to blow up the Moon
There's shoutouts to it
Nah it's more like
Otoh the epilogue is so good
Season 3 I loved but it definitely tries to cram a lot into it's runtime
The hardest part of Yuki Yuna is that if you want the most from S2 you read Nogi Wakaba after watching the first half of season two
It's another punchy girl protagonist and she is great
No way it's awesome
Yea Pain is so good too
I think that's the one EN song she's singing about pain constantly
And then Kokoro, too, which is just like brutal in a way I can't explain
Yea, Episode 3 was at least /fun/ and the big issue I had was a lack of endgame challenge content
Still love the haunting version of Greensleeves they did
Episode one had so much good music in general, and I still wish we had gotten a full series with the quality of Ep1 rather than the....mistakes that were made in Ep2's gameplay. Music was good in all 3, I adore She's Coming Back from XS3
