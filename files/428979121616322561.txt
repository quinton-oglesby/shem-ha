This is my art. Thank you for sharing!
That'll just get people mad at China and not the virus.
(Sorry, I'm tired of the bullshit)
Y'know, because the US government is corrupt and behind it all. It's not like the *entire fucking world* is being affected by covid.

~~The government is trying to control us by forcing the populace to wear masks and get a vaccine that hasn't been thoroughly tested.~~
~~It's just a flu bug, bro~~
Also, probably dumb question, but I assume the series is magical girl. I've been in the mood for magical girls.
Oh, manga version. May check that out. I like pictures with my text lol
cool cool. I think I'll watch the series then. Been on the PTW for too long
That's alright then. I can manage.
Ugh. I'm not much into reading. Is it "I'll be completely lost without it" or "I can get by if I know there's stuff I'm missing"
Anyone here seen Yuki Yuna? It's been on my radar, and I think I'll take the plunge, but I got a bunch of other stuff I'd like to watch too. Watch it now or save for later?
Yeah, I'll see how I feel about the series. If I absolutely need more, I'll check it out
Oh nice.
Noted. Doesn't look like the manga's too long either, and it's all on Mangadex, so might as well.
excellent
~~At least watching by that method means I wouldn't need to watch the finale twice~~ <a:bruuuuh:665938809619480584>
I figured out a watch order that flips between S2 and S3 episodes, but I feel even that would end up a bit messy.
It's a damn shame. S1 was fantastic and I stick by that. The rest is just a mess.
Again, I didn't read the source material, so Nogi and Mebuki were fine for me. But at least I'm not the only one who was dissatisfied with the season as a whole.
(sorry, just needed to rant a bit lol)
idk. Just kinda bummed. Especially since I loved S1 so much. That's a 10/10 for me.
Despite my feelings, I may end up rewatching, but watch S3's episodes to fit S2's timeline. They kinda indicate where S3's episodes take place, and I think I've pinpointed the chronology and the best method of viewing.
If it was originally incorporated into S2's run, I probably wouldn't be so sour about it.
Admittedly, it wasn't *bad*, but all the backtracking S3 did just made it a slog.
My problem was pretty much all of S3 was just supplementary material for S2.
I only watched the anime, so I don't know about how well things were adapted.
Season 1 was fantastic. Season 2 was good. Season three kinda killed my enthusiasm. <a:bruuuuh:665938809619480584>
Finished Yuuki Yuuna.
