hello Sam! glad to see you hereee

Hi everyone, I'm cosmokyrin (though you can just call me kyrin). Recent Symphogear fan here! I've known some info about Symphogear here and there about a year ago, but only got to watch it this January 2022 lmao. Went over all seasons in 2 weeks, IT WAS WORTH THE RIDE!! Love the show very much, still emotional about finishing XV just yesterday (i need a full rewatch of all my favorite scenes lol)

I'm an artist mostly ljsdsd my mainstay fandom for years now is really RWBY, so hoping to see some fellow RWBY fans here also! But Symphogear seems to be a nice play to stay in too <:HibikiDab:688190074395164696>
Oh heyo!! Thank you for the welcome lsdjfsdf

she's my favorite character, but i have a hard time drawing her (i scrapped 5 sketches except for a Shem-Ha Miku that worked in one try) <:SerenaDizzy:736605371912945736> <:SerenaDizzy:736605371912945736> <:SerenaDizzy:736605371912945736> <:SerenaDizzy:736605371912945736>

god it took forever for me to notice that your pfp is Belldandy HFHSDHFSDF

hello new best friend!! Ah My Goddess is a wonderful anime and it defined my entire childhood /lh
i gotta rewatch it sometime
||and also if Suletta is a clone based on the timeline, why would she like, start at 0 years old though lol||
G-witch spoilers

||with all the theories and implications of ep 6 and also the official video of the full OP theme now makes me question if Eri was basically sacrificed and turned Nina Tucker, and if Suletta is a clone or whether she is legit a daughter (biologically speaking) of Elnora. Though the placement of the cloning detail on Elan makes me think that Suletta is a clone..... ||

||Yet again if it's been 21 years, Suletta is 17 years old, then there's the 5-year gap that explains Ericht being 4 years old when the Folkvangr incident happened, but then what happened to the 1 year left? Was Elnora unknowingly carrying Suletta by the time of escape or was she experimenting on cloning--- AAAAAAAAA||
||I think if Eri and Suletta are both birthed from Elnora the timeline could still match up (both being Nadim's daughters) coz if Eri was 4 years old when they escaped Folkvangr and Elnora already pregnant with Suletta, then Suletta would have been born in Mercury and Eri would be 5 years old and would somewhat line up with what the Peil woman said about the attack being 21 years ago already||
||do you see her as a daughter??? a toool??? a reflection of Eri??? a "could-have-been if she was alive" assuming she's dead? WHAT IS IT ELNORA, TELL ME||
||this makes me super intrigued at how Elnora really sees Suletta hhhhhhhhhhhhhHHH||
||holy shit, same thoughts after rewatching earlier. Elan 4 realized something with the way he said "You're..." and then cut off.||
G-witch again

||also does anyone know what divination technique they were using in episode 5? (around 5:00) idk *exactly* which it is but the whole "Ericht is Aerial / Suletta is not Ericht / Ericht and Suletta are sisters" make me curious how the stone fell on the 12th portion||

||All i know is that in astrology the 12th house is known for anything that's hidden / spiritual / collective consciousness and basically has everything to do with what you don't see but is there lmao and directly affects the 1st house, known as the house of the self||
