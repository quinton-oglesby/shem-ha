after this banner i save til serena
but i need kanade
the fucking tech chris on it is killing me
so it felt worth it
but i only have a single burnbasa, and none of the baby dr jiis unlocked
i shouldnt even have done the 1 roll, i still need kanades
<:ohno:599348283697004574>
with i had gems to get more than 1 copy D=
until silence lock
xdjii doing work
that said i have enough CP to fight it in about 5 minutes so please kill the adds for me <:15min:241820657027907584>
i hate it because if you're trying to be efficient its objectively a bad idea to attack before someone else kills the adds to go for higher damage
wish they counted towards your contribution
<:wow:257239526441746434>
