I asked my friend for tips on selecting my first gunpla to assemble and it boiled down to WOW! COOL ROBOT!
And a small kemofure Tsuchinoko on my center monitor base. And an even smaller Chika Takami who's supposed to cling to headphone cords but doesn't do the best job of it.
I don't have anything dedicated, but I have two figures on top of my computer right now.

oh no
Hopefully I manage it ;_;
symphogear wise I also wanna put out I'M JUST A DOLL
there's some short bits in there that are already up on Dynasty so that'd cut down on what I have to work on lmao
i'm only getting one bandori soon but hopefully i can put that out too
tbh my friend mainly does love live so i leave those to him
i only have one on hand and it's half yoshiriko half rubyleah
and the yoshiriko has riko getting yoshiko to drink from a baby bottle which is amusing but also has a shade of "ah, hm" to it
If I ever get that one going and if it's not already on dynasty i'll ping you

the one i'm about to do, i'm also gonna get the sequel for, so that's micro fire i'm lighting under my own ass
but there are of course little references that may be snuck in
the DMJii one that's up next after the illuminati idols has a couple references that I'm gonna have to either bring through intact with notes, or figure out other stuff with them
hmmm... for the one i'm planning to start work on, I would say no - visual gloss just shows it as a nice little story of some iM@S CG girls getting together for a meal, but I need to familiarize myself with what appears to be monjayaki lmfao
i decided to be a cheapo and save a small amount on shipping b/c i'll just get my books from him at AX lol
and probably soloing when I start getting Bandori stuff; a friend of mine who's released a lotta scanlations is who I piggyback on for orders, and he's already gotten the latest shipment in
like i have help for symphogear material but i'm gonna be flying blind on iM@S/Love Live
i wanna learn lmfao
as far as symphogear content is concerned
just waiting on my QC to get back with stuff
but i'm thinking i'll start on an older memoria tonight that's season appropriate
i'm about to scan a nonsymphogear doujin so i can attempt the whole scanlation process solo and get something to my name on dynasty lmao
and nah i don't have that one unfortunately

She's got the whole flirty gyaru image but not as much on the actual flirting in reality
One member is big on the mysterious and flirty
Two are a very carefree pair that love some teasing
The last is an enabler
Teased as fuck
She's part of the quintet LiPPS, a unit based around bullying mika
Mika is good

i don't know what exactly happened, but from their taste test it didn't taste good at all
that's probably what would happen to me tbh
and yet i saw some show where they brewed mead and it went bad
Not like I'll get to use 適合係数 over there

Thankfully the others don't seem to enter into that kind of territory

Also Otakon I only started going to last year. My group is switching to that instead of anime Boston.
Not looking forward to the sudden temperature spike this week but it shouldn't be this chilly here.

i was shocked to learn one of my idoltrash friends was 32 tbh
oh dang
i turned 26 this year
oh god i assumed alice was older than me
lol
Bueno
I'm proud of y'all too
Oh I legit thought they just had a lot of dirty clothes.
Eggs?
what in three christs.
Maybe it wouldn't be so bad if he were more active? There are others who are... kinda like that? But they can back down. This guy doesn't show any sign that he's capable of backing down.
jesus christ dude this is insufferable not even the guy whose schtick is telling people "DIE" is anywhere near as annoying as this smug piece of shit.
Oh, everyone was so desperate to get this *lesser idol limited SSR* and i just **LUCKED INTO GETTING HER!!!!!!!**
Oh, **My Top Idol** is the ***ONLY TRUE TOP IDOL*** and every single idol is so beneath her, ho ho!
And it's offputting and comes across as insufferably smug.
He's into iM@S and stuff but like jesus christ I know we have the 'best girl' schtick but it feels like he's...... really __fervent__ and not just fervent.
Man I wonder when I'm going to get tired enough of this one guy's schtick in one of the servers I mainly talk in.
Ah, okay, thanks for the info on the terminology.
I managed to get tickets to the Aqours concert at AX so I'm hoping that AqouRainbow project thing manages to happen and I get a little misty eyed when I think about it.
Basically it's banking on a certain song being  performed in the full concert, and the intention is for the audience to put their penlights up in a certain order. Big scale thing, I feel.
It's always some anime track.
Sometimes I stop myself from listening to certain songs at work 'cause I tear up a little bit.
Doesn't help that I love cheese.
I think genetically I'm losing in the LI department but I just keep consumption low.
Sounds party enough to me.
Really hope this doesn't mean we have to rebook a different reservation...
Concerning given that I have a reservation later this year in Tokyo. But the listing is still up as opposed to the majority of our other options that we were tracking in my group.
Oh dear. Japan had airbnb hosts cancel reservations this month if they're not licensed.
and now you've got all these folks who are just 'i'm only presenting an alternative situation in the hope that we can have a healthy debate. but nobody wants to argue in good faith anymore." and it's so annoying and it gives me the same feeling as sealioning
I gotta stick to whatever I'm doing, seems like it's going right
Dang I'm down five pounds
East coast represent.
Driving up north always felt so restrictive, but it's definitely more dense so there's that.
beloved 70mph roads
nvm i have to catch myself since this is the serious channel
Regular exercise again which had stopped since I started having a job, carb cutting, smaller eating during workday to keep my body thinking it's gotta burn regularly.
I'm finally starting to see results in managing my weight again. Down like five or six pounds from my usual plateau. I've got a long ways to go but this is a reassuring start.
alas
basically all the candidates on the republican side were shades of I DO TRUMP THING and
but my state is 100% trump country
trust me hazel i'm gonna try
I appreciated that thing, genuinely. Now I just get jersey knit sheets or whatever the term is. Super soft.
I had this one blanket that was immensely soft from years of use. Unfortunately it got holes in it and so we just threw it away.
Ah, okay. Just checking since I've had sleeping issues, myself, and I snore big time, which turned out to be severe sleep apnea.
Sidenote to anyone that has big time snoring and has just lived with it to now, that might be something to look out for.
Saki do you snore much, by any chance?
If you wake up during the wrong sleep cycle it's gonna screw with you to at least some degree.
*cycles.
If I had to guess it's sleep ycles
it didn't scroll
oh nvm
is that just, what, overton window shifting in the US for a while?
Found out today I'll need surgery for a condition... Not critical thankfully but just pretty unpleasant for now. Also thankfully found out some injections I was hoping for but my insurance won't pay for, I'll be put on some sort of program for. So that way I'll get to start soon.
Oof
Gonna be good to get back to my usual exercising though.
i mean, AX was also a lot of exercising too
Ugh, I gained weight post-AX. 😦 And I was so ready to show my doctor my progress.
Six overall? I don't know how they're actually categorized.
I have two first names, but that's tame in comparison to my old roommate who has uh.
It could be something else but they need to be sure. Thankfully neither possibility is like super critical.
I was looking forward to good workouts again after ax though...
It's been a thing I noticed but I'm thankful it's not really inconvenienced me. Just gotta not exert myself after being told that it was. Kind of gross so that's why I've tiptoed around being explicit here.
Danke
Appointment for recently-discovered medical condition in about an hour. Hopefully it stays low-key for a while and I won't have to get the operation until next month.
I usually try to hold my tongue here about that tbh.
Up until now I don't think I'd ever parsed 'fluid' in the noun sense in that term.
Woo, got new medication for a different condition I have. This one's supposed to help even better with what I've got.
And my dad's is old and we've been begging him to replace it for the past eight months
I think I need to get an early replacement on mine, it's too hungry and dies at 20%
Yeah
Yes
Might have to get her an emergency new one tomorrow but we need to recover some stuff off that phone
With less than an hour before we had to leave for the airport
Welp my mom accidentally spilled acetone earlier and some of it messed up her phone display
Oooooooooooooh
Alright, I find out in two days what exactly went wrong in my body and where they're gonna cut me open. Kiiiiiinda hoping it's the second possibility even though that means I go to a different doctor and the surgery location is more unpleasant to think about, but it also hopefully means I don't have to have something put in me afterwards.
that's incredible and i am super relieved that you're taken care of like that
And then apply makeup
I gotta get my face nice and smooth
Lol
Though I wish I could just stop it during con season
Beard growth is weird
I'll post the cosplay pics here. Making this is basically all I'm gonna be using my time for until the con.
Which is why I also got arm sleeves lol.
My skin isn't in the clearest condition but it's getting better. Even more now with that injection.
All I know is I'm actually using pantyhose with my cosplay to even out skin tone and provide another surface for the thigh highs to be on.
Gosh
ty, it's not the most pressing thing for me rn though but i will be taking care of it asap
gotta worry more about the surgery i'm gonna talk to a different doctor about tomorrow
i can, but it won't send reports to my pulmonlogist, so ihave to get another study done or something...... gonna call them tomorrow and see what my options are
welp
gonna see if i can just straight up buy one off the folks i was renting from
welp fucked up and fell below cpap usage compliance, just turned in the machine
I'll be at Otakon next week if anyone's going.
For the time being there may be opportunities here and there.
Things should be okay.
Was able to make my appointment for surgery. It'll be like right after I get back from Otakon basically.
I need my legs to not be so wide >.>
I've been proud before but they're too big in my pants lmfao
I can go as low as maybe.. 9.5 wide  US size for guys?
iktf
i have wide feet, it's stupid
(no, don't do that)
Dr. Ver and Hideri, get you a boy who can do both.
Top ain't done, lmao.
Feels nice so far. Gonna finish the skirt later in full.

the last names where my parents are from tend to like start with the same letter or sth is all i knw about last name
my second name is derived from my grandmother's name
a-ara?
I did like going around in a skirt today from a physical comfort perspective. Avoided feeling too warm partially thanks to that.
Fuck
Still waiting to be contacted about another payment I need to make on that so hopefully I get called about it tomorrow.
Then surgery Tuesday.
That's... another wfh tomorrow and I'm just thankful I have the option
Flight delayed about three and a half hours, won't be properly home until after midnight my time
Might be a motherboard issue? I'm seeing results for that now that I'm looking and seeing the cpu and dram LEDs flashing.
I was trying to get it to boot from disk but it just refuses to show me anything now.
The BSOD screens kept citing different files.
I'm gonna try and get my friend to help, he's much better at hardware / os stuff than I am.
Aaaand now that I'm home my desktop has a BSOD.
I need to sleep but loud kid
Finally on plane
And my desktop is fucked up again. Maybe it's actually the motherboard...
Gah
Yup
Oh yeah this isn't pleasant.
Now it's time to rest upstairs and maybe take an ibuprofen or something. P sure I'm getting some inflammation inside of me.
I already got to yell SHIKI with kotomi aihara there live which was unironically fulfilling tbh
Yeah I'm resting big time today and I've put in to wfh the rest of the week. I now have a mesh in my body to reinforce that area.
I'm glad that's done and in four to six weeks I'll be able to get good exercise in again!
It only was really noticeable start of July though, but I thought it was just, idk, my bladder acting up for maybe a month or two prior
And apparently I'd been living with it for years according to the surgeon
I was diagnosed with a hernia
I'll go ahead and share since this is a serious zone
Surgery site aches p bad though
I'm alive
lol
Phew turned out to just be bad ram.
Hmm. Thought I had something new to worry about but it's normal after the operation. That's a relief.
Ahhh
I'd believe it tbh
My surgeon did say I could pair the narcotics with that stuff so I felt safe, the alternation is an interesting strategy
And I'm using a chair where it's more easy for me to get in /out due to its arms
Yeah, my mom's friend who's a nurse suggested in addition to my prescribed meds, alternating ibuprofen and Tylenol
There's, uh, slightly less pain? So hopefully that trend continues this weekend.
Trying to. I'm glad I can work from home but I'll be glad I don't have to tomorrow.
Okay, I can't cough without getting a spike of pain either. And my pills are only affecting my head, not where I had the surgery done, which is hmmmmmm
Christ
I wonder how long until I can move normally again.
Physically. Right hip feels like it's going to explode when I move.
Woof, continues to be a legitimate struggle to get out of and back into bed.
Fair too
Nice.
But I recognize that I'm not in a place where it's ideal to be looking, so I'll keep improving myself.
I haven't been in a relationship in a decade. ._.
Hell yeah.
They all found out and had him meet with all 3 of them at once for a triple dump.
He had 3 girlfriends simultaneously at one point in high school.
Don't be like my dad.
Headpats are nice to give
oh whoops
lewd
lol wow at the line redraw
Ah, thank goodness, more progress. Sneezing/laughing/coughing does not feel like a stake driven into my hip. Followup is on Tuesday.
Ok
seconded, it's very good that you're communicating the circumstances clearly with both of them
Iktf
CS class killed my confidence
That was basically me first year
to try and get back into a more prefered state of mind
listen to light classical piano music
at times like this i've done that plus like
family too tight
Family obligations too ingrained.
I'm 26 and still this way.
I've been enduring years of this honestly to the point where I'd I want a weekend they can't steal I have to leave the state.
Was finally gonna get a nice relaxing time at the bar
Instead I can't not go to my cousin's birthday so that my relatives don't think I'm stuck up. And I don't get this long weekend because other relatives coming up to stay at our house.
Aaaand more plans canceled because family.
Filipinos are huge on social media.
Probably, tbh.
So *
Syu many unsavory comments that would sink less popular politicians.
And in the Philippines there's Duterte.
Well said
Find your happiness where you can, for yourself
I had that for a while and as I got closer to a decade without a relationship I tried to focus differently
Big step: try to break free of that mindset, I'd suggest
Hell yeah.
Almost suspended from college tbh
Yeah I've been there before
Oh dear
Much better to hear
oh no
:OOOOOOO
ooh my simul group has that on deck
nice
:000000
It's been a month since my last matches. Didn't even get a message though.
what's the term for that again? malapropism?
Ah, okay. I like the thought of switching to saying it 'aluminium' but the non-ium way is just too culturally ingrained in me and i don't like looking _too_ pretentious.
Honest question then: What is the appreciable difference between Airplane/Aeroplane?

glad to hear it didn't last long
100%
Even just a bad rain here can flood downtown
If they live downtown, good call
I'm charleston area
I thought we were gonna start getting rain a while back, here
Good
Glad to hear it wasn't so bad for y'all
That's a relief
but i'm a little older
oh wow, i thought you were closer to my age
Very good bullet dodge
it took me a second to realize that the hieroglyphs image did __NOT__ mean a link to parody news site The Onion.
I'll note it here just in case, but
Well just the one
JOBS
I would eat griddle cookies
I would write extra small and offer this service to classmates lol
One class let us bring a 3x5 index card with formulas for tests
i used pictochat on DS to send answers to others lmfao
a few of us were daring one time in freshman hs
depending on the subject on which the test is being taken, it may be the case that the professor believes the student is listening to some non-music audio and therefore cheating on the test
as in, is the music being played to the entirety of the class at large during the test taking period, or is this a case of 'student cannot listen to music (through headphones or other implement that makes the music-listening experience inherently a non-group experience)'
Is it a class-wide thing or a single-person basis?
"i can't change anything! it's not worth voting!" music to their ears, less people who can validly oppose them, have some nice steamrolling
which is exactly what the side that get so much flak here wants you to internalize
you have to start __somewhere__
i live in solid red territory but i'm still voting 'cause fatalism gets us nowhere
i am 100% voting in my midterms
Boys don't know this.
makes sense
damn, all the same
just out of curiosity i guess
Marine or Jean-Marie? slash does it even matter which one
I've been noticing signs of not so good sleep so I'm glad I'm finally getting it
Getting a cpap not through insurance... Headache but at least I can straight up own it
Feels good to have a cpap again. This way I won't disturb my friends next month.
or like do they just keep finding new deep ends to jump off of
peta has been off the deep end for years
LIke I don't wanna be a drain, but I'd prefer to be the person enabling it? Having enough skill/power to help others with not as much through. If that makes sense.
I think I get that stance
How are your hands? D:
It's had an amazing level of effect tbh
It's one I'm getting every 8 weeks now to deal with a skin issue I have
Phew injection get
Sounds cursed
Oh no
Can't rest yet because we still have to take my cousin home, we took her out for her birthday
Ugh so humid today
Doesn't help that two of the few roads I drive are undergoing expansion so that means double the construction slowdown.
Shifted from 730 to 7 to 630 now I'll have to leave at 6 lest I get stuck too much.
My drive to work took an hour yet again. Double what it usually does but if this is the new usual I'll just have to leave even earlier.
My foot is feeling better. Strange that the injection for my skin is what helped.
i asked my dermatologist before and they said it just.
I gotta ask my doctor about this.
Man I keep having weird internal bleeding on my fingers that comes and goes.
Nah, but we can look at our phones.
it just fades and leaves kinda like a faint orange spot and itches but i'll ask my regular doctor to be sure.
is a thing that can happen but like that doesn't comfort me all that much
from my friends with good opinions
one on the list
ooh same
The manga got kinda nice
i was recently recommended Hitoribocchi no OO Seikatsu and it's adorable. Girl is charged by her best friend to befriend everyone in her class or else they'll never be friends again.

the idea of it all coming from 10 year olds is mad entertaining tho
_fails to push a wailord_ "this B I G B O Y E weights a zillion kilograms. that has to be the case"
_punches a tough pokemon_ "shit man i bet you could like. get slammed into by a meteor and not flinch"
you get all these over the top stories
10 year olds are filling out the pokedex
because,
i like the comics folks made that basically show that
but i guess that implies that haunters/gastlies did too i guess?
gengars used to be people or something
You can download that skin so that your outwards appearance in gmod games where player skin changing is allowed is set to Hibiki
I'm a complete shill for two things in video games
Saints Row and anything by Supergiant Games
But there are plenty of nods to the series
It's..... alternate universe
Yes but it's not /actually/ Saints Row
A bit of a lighter offering but still a collect fest like 4
Gat Out Of Hell, yes
I played it all except the first, but 2 is still one of the games with a permanent place in my heart
This takes more after the new stuff
This is definitely not it but there are little nods
Er, "to me"
But it feels strongly like a Saturday morning cartoon for vulgar folk and that's superbly indulgent and I love that
Repeated interior cells feel samey, mission flow is stuttery
Agents of Mayhem, while still enjoyable to be as a Saints Row fan, has the Saints Row feel in its good points but also its bad points
Bueno
I'm not playing (:
my friendgroup is getting into F:GO
ahaha oh no
hibiki freeman who was gordon freeman's sister was one day in a lydian sleeping on her desk when
Mostly grew to love pinya via Honoka 4koma
Not original, just deresute, and that only slightly
P sure that's it
Pinya is life
Sidenote
dinglo ringlo
oh lord
and by the end of the second episode his reaction was "Uh i think i want to stop after the next episode"
i got my old roommate to simul it with me and the first sesh was like "yeah! let's watch as many as we can" at the start
i've seen that tire fire through three times
And may I also recommend not watching it because it requires many trigger warnings
Now if you want some mighty bad, may I suggest Cross Ange
I watched it expecting a trainwreck and got standard with a twist dreck
Qualidea code was...... benign
trading the rings for wings eh
and apparently he was confirmed as a follower of the account
and then someone made a twitter to do just that
Happened
Things
There was a scene with Sayori
Assume so
Uh, I,
One of us has some uh skills that have led us to deepen our interest in this plot
The first route me and my friends did led us to investigate
So here's the thing
Doki Doki Literature Club uh
dungeon fighter online I think?
Nice
Overwatch_competitive.png
Nice
legit probably one of my favorite pokemon
joltiks are great
Lmbo
nice
Pupupu
Nice
I need more SIS luck
But I got two pool ruby both at sk3 so that helps
Aqours pure I only have the 9/3 lol
Cool teams' spec is my favorite subunits
I might since I love my guilty kiss spec
If I sacrifice cheer Chika and Christmas you I can buy another UR
I think SLG Nico makes it into the smile because I have her at SK4
Lol
Aqours smile is only 4/9 Aqours which is so wrong
I've got valentines Yohane so I wanna get more smile Aqours first year
I need more Empress Charm tbh, I have four cool UR scorer but only two
Yeah I could idolize initial Chika
Also I need to actually get Aqours spec smile, it's still anchored by wedding honk
Oh god
The bad mmr is a gamble
D:
I remember last sm I had to play last hour just to secure it
Ah well
I've managed score t1 since they added ss seals on ww
Yeah alas
Mari and Yohane doing work with my best team
I got eight hours though, but it depends on the rate I can gain later
I'll end up breaking my streak
Yeah I saw the update on sifcord
Gonna see if I can play more before event starts but heading out soon lmao
I only just broke 24k rn
Due to my travels I doubt I'll score t1, can't gain at a good rate
Good match!
Yahaha! You found me!
Yeah, my first bit was with friends and we took a glacially slow 4 hours for one part, but on your own you'll get through that same amount of content in far less time
I'm glad I got in before I could get spoiled
Alas
Go literature it up it's free
Lmao probs
some people just want to watch ~~the world burn~~ some waifu drama
welcome to my twisted mind
Oh no
Still never once
I thought it was a one and done thing
Oh dang
I'm very pure
I haven't gotten it lol
I understand there's a voyeuristic trophy to earn regarding a view of her
Golly
hmm nope i can't see those
oh man, quiplash fun
lol
I'm at work lol
i expect god himself to love me back
Dang, I feel old now.
Then finishing PLPW (because I was playing it with a friend who loved AA but didn't have much layton experience) solo got me interested
then again tbh it took me PLPW to get into ace attorney series, I didn't think I was smart enough for the trials
that's an option too, but I feel like from a mechanical standpoint it'd be better to play one of the ones I mentioned before you get entrenched in the QoL improvements you get in PLPW
so to get your friend to watch AXZ, are you going to play Ace Attorney Investigations or Apollo Justice?
Nice
you only playing the first? i hope you end up liking it enough to play the rest
Lol I'm sticking with my 970 for a while
<:yoshimaru:303406906830094337>
And besides most of my free time otherwise I sink into TL
I'm away from home today and gotta travel next weekend with family too
Can't until February lol
Hmm reminds me that I got AC:O free with my CPU but I haven't played yet
D$mn
Oh dear

Ass creed origins feels p solid so far, gotta get used to combat though
gosh
de🅱ussy
i know that feeling of reform
lol wfc
Interesting
play at your own speed, chum
then again some of the rock ones blend a bit well, or maybe i was just expecting too much
and the yellow indicators are helpful
and then **DESYNCHRONIZED**
so i jumped off but couldn't make it to ground so Bayek was just kind of levitating between horse and slope
there was one time i was going to a viewpoint and my horse could take me no further
oh hey just a bunch of rocks yeah lemme go RIGHT ON UP
meanwhile the ass creed origins climbing is mostly pretty nice
ah yes let me get some fish skins and it takes a while
I think the only thing that felt like a chore was maybe.... animal hunting? Or maybe I just didn't do it enough.
How far you in
It's mighty solid
thankfully it doesn't feel as stupidly 'hunt down this object because the game world is stuffed full of things to press interact on' as the older installments of the series
jaysis ass creed origins has a lot to do
hm apparently i logged on last october
i haven't played in like two years or something
BUH GAWD
IT'S BERNIE SANDERS WITH THE FOLDING CHAIR
