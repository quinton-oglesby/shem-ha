I only dealt 40k to a Raid boss. How on earth did I get "Highest Damage"?
How did Bushiroad or whoever expect us to do it?
Someone said it took 3 hours.
Oh... forgot about that.
How did people even do hard raids legit at launch?
Sent FR to ahe
How do you get the bosses to 1 hp so quickly?
^
So do we pause too?
Whelps... She's already level 60 for me.
I just need normal body crystals to limit unlock Fierce Maiden Chris.
Is there a more *legal* way to do organized raid battles?
I'll help P carol
It's been 2 weeks of me trying to get the last 2 giga intels and I only got 1.
Started an int raid.
Is it different in JP?
I thought it was purple.
0 Giga Miracle Crystals...
<@!315328906930421761>  Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaand... Done!
<@!315328906930421761> What's your ID Code?
You tag the boss and collect participation points.
Oh no... I just missed Carol raids.
At least you got a giga miracle.
^Warning Garie is still alive.

Carol Miracle
Started a raid. It would be nice if someone could get rid of the ADs.
Got 2 Giga Miracles.
Thanks Tanya!
K Ads are dead.
Fine for me.
Are the ads down yet?
Thanks Koito
57 Minutes left send help.
Started Power Relic.
Woah... Garie is dead before Carol!
Since I got 3rd place.
Thought it was 3.
Did you at least check? I kept mine paused until 3:40+(time it took to clear the boss.)
Technique raids are the hardest for me at the moment.
Makes it hard to get Gigas if you don't have gears of the correct type or a LU 5 star gear.
Or some other low number.
If you tag a boss for 500 damage you won't get contribution.
Already have my gigas that I need.
Trusting autoplay to do the job.
Does XDU-JP use this channel?
I got a lvl 70 Maria first.
Ok cleared.
<@!199729582872461312> You have maximum followers.
It would take multiple tries for me until I LU my maid Shirabe.
Just let me finish this raid first and I'll bonk.
Sure. What's your friend code?
So the boss damage increase isn't infinite?
Damage increases over time so that they eventually overpower us.
Do some bosses just not have damage ramp?
Wut... I started a raid and set my phone aside. I usually finish things within 70-105 turns but I didn’t think it would take this long.
I would say the body raid is the most fun thing the game has gameplay wise due to feeling like an MMO healing simulator.
I just found out there's plenty of raids I can solo by instead setting Serena as leader.
This is Global correct?
Watch Symphogear!
Soo... Beastars is hitting Netflix this friday...
How did Arifureta get an english blu-ray release but not Symphogear?
Edit: Also did the season 1 Blu-Ray for Symphogear by discotek even come out yet?
Are there any animes that feel similar to Symphogear choreography wise?
Oh wait they do. Internet was just slow.
Is Crunchyroll streaming AKB0048?
Actually now I'm not so sure. AKB0048 episodes isn't popping up on Crunchyroll anymore.
Sure
Wait. Are the OVAs in the Blu-Rays?
Anyone know what anime this is from?
