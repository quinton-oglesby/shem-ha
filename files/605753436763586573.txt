How Hibiki-like.
I can't read moonrunes.

First of all, I will say that I am not an expert on this, due to only having few transgendered friends. The case you're talking about isn't very common, though it might stems from the need to accomplish something after gender transformations or.....how do you say this.....the wish to have an offspring would help with dysphoria in a sense, regardless if you're a transgender or not.
I don't know why, but I feel like that I can relate to how you feel most of the time.
I'm sorry. I need few moments.
I don't know if anyone wants to be friends with a girl that have aphonia and Schizophrenia.
For everything.
I really, really am sorry.
....... I'm sorry.
I have been like this for close to eleven years.
It's fine. I just wanted to vent before I actually burst forth into tears.
All the medicines above were for Schizophrenia.
So I will know when to stop if I am acting up.
That is why I asked everyone about DID and Schizophrenia.
They said it was Schizophrenia.
........I already asked a psychiatrist about this.
It feels like actual voices, but at the same time it doesn't.
I already tried a lot of thing to shut the voices out of my head.
.......I even already took medications like Heximer and Stelosi. Also Haloperidol, Resperidone, Alprazolame, and Diazepam.
I already took medications, even.
I just wanted to cry.
I already tried to accept everything.
I just, don't know anymore.
See, you'd be disgusted to a girl like this, too.
To make it worse, god took the only thing that makes me want to live away.
I already stayed in hospital until all tge scars in both my arms and wrists heals.
Then tell me, what are all this voices telling me to die?
I just feel like the world would be a better place if I never existed.
My heart feels really heavy.
It's just, I don't know.
Why do I feel like I'm about to burst forth crying.....
22 is looking too far ahead if you were thinking about marriage.
And well, your big sister is here, too.
How old are you, Pharios?
........and let's be fair. It's not really a pleasant experience to be carrying a baby while you have not married yet, especially when you don't know who the father is.
And, well, I can give you a view from a girl's POV.
Well, if it's girlfriend, it should be easier, but still, it depends on how you view your partner, too.
<@354236264595324928> and trust me honey, shotgun marriage isn't as beautiful as they make it sounds.
I mean, I do find that each one of you is interesting in its own way.
Fair enough.
I mean, you can try dating Ksiyo.
You are kind of similar with my elder brother.
<@189146272865845248>

......I kind of wish my old relationship is like that.
I mean, you can try online dating first, see if you have what it takes.
I forgot to do so, that is why I deleted it.
No, I don't think I feel that side effects.
Once it quiets down, the voices is really overwhelming after that.
Oh, that.
If you are asking me, then in general.
Also, I can still use cosmetics to hide the bruises if push comes to shove.
Well, I still have the medicines for physical trauma, so I reckon that part would be fine.
And the psychiatrist, too.
Or at least, that is what the therapist said.
Yes.
It's for Depression, Post Traumatic Disorder, and Schizophrenia.
That?
In a way, yes.
And sometimes, it's bad enough to make me vomit straight after waking up.
For me, it's when nightmares is just plainly a recollection of my past.
And me being awake at 10 PM should be proof enough.
So it really helps me to get proper sleep for almost nine years now.
I mean, I can, but I would be awake after probably an hour or so due to excessive........ nightmares.
I ran out of sleeping medicines.
It's fine. My hands are shaking a little bit, but I'm doing fine.
I mean, I can see it since some people had treated me like I'm no more than a ||whore||.


Remembering it makes me want to vomit.
I believe that a lot of people are having difficulty understanding almost all of us here.
It would not be called that if it's not convoluted.
It *is* psychology, after all.
And I can't just wake someone up.
Then again, well, I can't sleep all that soundly except I had the pills or I have someone holding my hand.
I'm starting to think that China are adapting the old principle of the Great Dragon and the Nopperabou.
That is, too, a valid point.
It's how you make yourself and your friends be comfortable to each other.
It's not how long you keep the relationship, in this case, friendship going.
On the other hand, I met a girl online for two weeks, and she is comfortable enough to be calling me mother.
I have been friends with a man for four years, but he doesn't even willing to accept help from me.
Oh, the length of the friendship is not a parameter of how close you are.
But girls, you see, have times when they just wanted to cry and not telling anyone except closest ones about it.
And no, I'm not...... dissing you, to put it on your terms.
Once they feel comfortable, trust will come naturally.
The first thing is that you should make them feel comfortable with you first.
And yes, some people isn't really comfortable telling someone else what they feel sometimes. Even I am like that in several occasions.
But let me put it this way, would you be telling your secret to someone you don't trust yet?
I can understand that.
No, when I got it out, it's still looks like a proper saliva, just a bit more red.
I was coughing a little earlier.
Is there a specific reason for your saliva to be red and taste a little metalic?
And well, you can say that I have been trained in case of assault.
I can see what you mean, and I'm not saying that you wanted to get into a relationship with her or anything.
And yes, my mom used to be like that, too, until I'm willing to go to the psychiatrist and psychotherapy.
But if you have not been as close as possible, to the point that she considers you a lover or a family, then it's not your part to fret about her keeping it to herself.
And yes, that too.
Or gacha currency.
Unless you are using free Singstones.
Seeing that Fubuki actually are watching that reddit thread.
You can say that.
I recommend accessing r/Hololive if you want to have at least a.....how do I say it.......an alternative?
And I know this will never heal completely.
Even now I still remember.
How can I ever forget, then?
How do you make memories less painful?
I mean, at this point, what is a mess that isn't American?
......... someone I know is attempting to do that, too.
That is a good point.
They even have Marijuana gummy bears.
I mean, you can get marijuana legally for recreational purposes in some parts of the US.
I mean, depending on where you live, it seems easier to get weed.
Just do it in DMs or <#336297387863703552>
You can ask me or Ten for one.
Said the Mage of Eternal Water.
......there is people like, throws gender perception into disarray, and there is a girl like me who gave everyone fantasy names.
Maybe, even my own parents would be happier if I died earlier.
In fact, I used to try and make people hate me, so it would be so much easier for me and for them to forget each other.
Maybe deep down, I only wish for everything to end.
I'm fed up of people looking at me with pity
I'm fed up of having to take medication for years past, and for years to come.
I'm tired
I'm sick of living like this.
To be honest, I am wishing for that to happen.
And I....... don't seem to care enough now if it comes sooner.
Yes, I'd probably be dead in seven years.
Seeing from how much medications I took and how long I have been taking it, also the frequency of me being in a hospital, which is higher and higher every year.
The question here is are they *unwilling* or *unable*
All I want is just a place to be.
Why do you think I thought I want to die in seven years!?
Now look at me, I have no voice, legs, nor even a future.
No, it's ***Hellish***, that is what it is!
And you are telling me that it's just *harsh*!?
And I don't even know who the dad is!
I have been pregnant, ***two times***!
*Harsh?**Harsh!?***
Where was it when they took away everything!?
Where was it when I was used as a flesh toy?
I believed in the light for years. *For years*, Cyph.
Let me finish.
You shut it, Ten.
Because it seems that these eyes are pretty useless.
Why don't I gouge out these eyes for you, then.
Oh, excuse me, maybe I am too blind to see.
And you are telling me that there's light in ***that***!?
All it gets are darker and ***darker*** in every step
How long do you think I have been walking, even without legs!?
***Always***!?
*always*?
Always?
And am I allowed to talk about a stalker here?
I mean, I'm against it.
Speaking of that, my parents *might* be increasing the psychiatrist visit.
Well, I have asked my whole family, but no one even knows about the mail.
Not much, really.
Which, that has no identity whatsoever written on it.
A little surprise in the mailbox.
I already talked with the psychiatrist.
I'm......sort of okay now.
How do you stop an anxiety attack?
What is E-Cigs?
I see.
Still, I do apologize if I was interrupting you earlier.
I feel bad about interrupting them.
I'm going to let Mei and the others finish their discussion first.
But knowing when they are there or not, that is quite scary.
And yes, Voy, seeing that my dad and brother are quite large in size, they are quite noticeable.
I agree with Kat here.
And regarding marijuana, I do think that as long as you don't hurt anyone, nor you are inconveniencing anyone, I still think that it is fine within reasonable limits.
He/she would never come whenever my brother or my dad waited all night.
It's no longer everyday, but that personage would left the envelope taped to the front door every so often.
So yes, Voy.
They're not even a dolt.
I'm starting to think that people tends to get the meaning of "simp" incorrectly, or those children are just idiots.
...... I'm sorry. Do excuse me for a moment.
There has to be a reason why all that happened.
You already know what happened to me.
You know my history, Ten.
Without me realizing, I might look like a nympho.
Seeing that there is many who......did things to me just because I'm different, I can see why.

I can hit a target one out of ten times.
And yes, somewhat.
A little bit of strings drawing.
I have a bow, but I don't have any crossbow.
Or maybe a crossbow?
How about bow and arrow?
I'm not completely sure.
They'll analyze the footage of the security camera or something.
We even called a cop a week ago.
They already knows.
Oh, nevermind. I already had a Nebula Dragon, Big Crunch Dragon sent few days prior.
Seeing that he sent a Nebula Lord Dragon without-
I mean, I don't think the one who sent me these envelopes knows anything all that well about me.
Who are you asking?
And there are an envelope containing Nebula Lord Dragon this morning.
Oh, and about that.
Why do I need.....electro-thingy.
In a Link Joker first trial deck.
And it's an official card, since the code matches the serial number it was released.
Let me check.
It's like the standard card.
I'm not going to refuse a free card.
I already threw away the envelope.
You know, I feel like I want to keep sniffing.
I don't remember my perfume did that before.
I mean, it's pleasant, but a little addictive.
Besides, I already rejected him once before.
The shopkeeper is my brother's friend, so if he wants to give me something, he would have given it to my brother.
I mean, it only has a light scent, so anyone could have been using it.
Didn't I mentioned it before that it smells like the perfume I used to wear back in college?
Weirdly enough, that is the exact image of couriers I know.
I'm starting to think that it's either one of my brother's friends, or just a prank.
Or in a week's time, at least.
If I still got the envelope tomorrow, then he *is* just a courier.
Well, the policemen already apprehended him, so I don't think we are going to see him anytime soon.
That is the question.
> If it's been tagged with a GPS or other electronic tracking device, a powerful electromagnet should be enough to destroy it.
<@331936441347211265> how do you get one.
Or so he said.
Apparently he was just a courier.
We caught the one taping it.
Well, as things evolved, they came with a letter too.
I'm still mad at you, so I'm not going to put more details on it.
He knows Quintet Walls is a necessary sacrifice for Legion.
I'm starting to think that this person knows a lot more about what I'm trying to make than myself.
.......what is MDD, anyway?
I had these symptoms for years.
It's not like it would mean anything if I am alive or not.
Hm? Why so?
I just wanted to know
Does anyone know how deep is it until you reach blood capillaries on your wrist?
......Now I know the purpose of those cards.....
I need help
My condolences.
I'm really sorry to hear that, Pharios.

<:Zababies:672238628398956594>
But I learned to bear with the pain.
Losing a place in a community does hurt me a lot.
I have been there, too.
Oh, thank you, Meiyi.
