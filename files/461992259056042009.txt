Oh yeah the Fenrir
How would she handle a talking bike that doesn’t even look human?
oh, and this one has a linktree that goes to three more (if any of them aren't on the blacklist already)
Found another RP account to add to the blacklist: https://discord.com/channels/336297387863703552/336297674707828747/986798860422758480
They don't *seem* to actually post any stolen art (save for one reply to a now deleted tweet where they used birthday art of Carol)
...instead they appear to basically just trace existing art of the characters and just change the hairstyle for their "original characters"
This is amazing. The expressions on both of them are the best.
Pretty sure that pose is for one of the aerial attacks of Sol Badguy from Guilty Gear
Yo that’s cool!
GAAAAAOOOOO
THIS IS SO FREAKIN' GOOD
YOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Looks really noice!
*WBX starts playing in the background*
Both are real good! But I will say I personally feel the second one sounds better
YOOOOOO SIREN LOOKS COOOOOOL!
Oh yo this is really nice!
ooooooooooo
ooohhhh yeye i get that entirely
it perfectly nails the energy of feeling absolutely dead inside
so major props
yo this is real good
OH YO I DIDN'T SEE THE GHOST FIG
I uh
I also built a kit today: https://twitter.com/fenristsukigami/status/1571574572587319297?s=46&t=16gW992nP8ubhjahFERlBg
Yeah, it’s Lloyd and Colette from Tales of Symphonia (since there was that collab between XDU and the Tales Of series)
I mean it isn’t *entirely* wrong
I absolutely would too.
...now I'm imagining the opening done with banjos and sung with a country accent.
Yeah these are all really noice
I mean, I thought it was a Core Deck Case/Core Gadget from Buddyfight for a little bit at first

…i-is that Hibiki as Kusaka (KR Kaixa), because her birthday is shared with Kaixa Day?
True.
Wow, I already knew Monk would work well for Hibiki, but seeing it now, Samurai works REALLY WELL for AU!Bikki. That art’s cool as heck!
Yo Carol with an Ascian Glyph, that’s freakin cool! (and that particular one is… quite the choice, to say the least.)
That’s *GENIUS* design imo.
The minigun barrels are what make the head of the hammer.
This is the good stuff right here

…i thought it was one of those tiny snack pretzels
Yeah it’s basically that. It’s because Kanade and Detective Conan both have the same voice actress.
Holy crap the aviator jacket over the Gungnir armor works *really* well there!
Rei just makes THE MOST HYPE GEAH X RIDER ART
Yeah that statement is not entirely inaccurate
And this comic is *unreasonably accurate*
They understand the simple math!
THE GIRL <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
YES
*Obi-Wanya*
Also congrats you now have mount flight in ARR areas so it’s MUCH faster
It’s gonna get NUTS once you get out of ARR as a whole
*hoo boy all imma say is you ain’t ready for some of what’s gonna happen*
Oh you just finished base ARR?
Minfilia!
Actual source for that art: https://www.pixiv.net/en/artworks/62879170
Hey once you fall into any kind of REALLY hard brainrot you are ***never getting out of it***
Tem!
Cocogoat very cute
Aegis girls are all very pretty in casual clothes
I actually wanna see that now
also the artist put the Crimson Vistamp's stamper thing on Elfnein's torso here and i find that a really neato detail
there's more from that same artist
neat.
...that's an alien kappa in the bottom right.
I think imma check sevens out at some point (if I can find where to watch it)
I do love me some card game-based insanity…
…I’m just reading these episode descriptions from wikis out of intrigue now and uhhh oh lordy what the frack is going on in Sevens
Just reading about them was weird enough
Oh yeah. The Goha’s.
Right, think I saw others discussing that earlier
…just gotta remember to find a website to watch it on once I’m home from work
Right, Yohohoy!
*i wanna watch episode 1 so bad, but I am not giving Crunchyroll my money for premium*
Oh yeah, Love After World Domination
But still, HOO BOY that was good shtuff
Yeah just realized it once I finished reading the chapter
OH WAIT WE GOT THE FINAL CHAPTER OF HERO X FORMER GENERAL?!
*THEY KNEW WHAT THEY BLOODY DID.*
Idk if it was Cocoa herself that planned that or if it was the people that did the art, but whoever it was...
Yo I noticed that when it gets to the chorus, along with the really cool fire effects/art that shows up, the red medal changes and becomes cracked.
**and it’s actually pretty freakin good** ***WHAT***
Okay so this is the song from that one scene in Stranger of Paradise that got memed to hell and back
https://youtu.be/OQO5DXJK9AM
EI EI OH!
Such a raw theme
Ayyyyyy one of the top Dynazenon inserts!
SONIC HAS FINALLY RETURNED TO KINO TERRITORY
AKA George goes on a monologue about how much of a Rider nerd he is and decides to do it * *in song* *
or at least, he's given that nickname (supposedly, can never be sure with RiderWiki)
never forget that the crew of Revice called Noritaka Hamao "Kuuga Boy", since his birthdate was near the premiere date of Kuuga
gods i gotta listen to more ONE OK ROCK stuff
YEAAAAAAAH
JAPAN'S #1 BUSYBODY!!
