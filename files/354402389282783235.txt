though sometimes it seemed like the video stream would randomly stop working for me
ooh, I've played that a few times before in another discord that I'm in
(I haven't had a chance to read the translated version of the new chapter yet, so I think it'd be a cool idea to have a channel specific for discussion on that)
maybe revive #raw-discussion? or perhaps a new manga-specific channel
i still dont know how i feel about threads <:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
im not too familiar with steam. what does a steam group do exactly?
that sounds like fun üëÄ
it's gotten to the point where even official links look scammy to me lol (help)
this one the discord server join link is legit but the embed right below that is to a phishing site
also another standard watch out for sus phishing links one https://twitter.com/Rimmy_Downunder/status/1485806002872385541
a couple of ppl i know from tetris also got hit by this
i believe phara from this server was hit by this
this one it seems like it's mainly targeted ppl with early supporter or other badges, they will dm you from another compromised account (so it seems more trustworthy) asking you to try their game https://twitter.com/GlitchyPSI/status/1441035412437409792
some ppl have been getting hit by discord hackers lately, maybe a psa of some sort?
it sounds fun but also time zones >_<;;
(iirc they ended up extending deadlines a few times bc it always takes longer than you plan for <:lidelle:634093359488827403>)
this was their timeline
for recent nichijou zine from the time it opened up for applications to the time the physical zines actually started arriving it was almost a full year
maybe it could be an all-digital zine. physical zines sound like a lot of work bc u have to worry about logistics like printing and shipping and whatnot
my main complaint is that it shifts the meta to emote-reacting with "star" to all the good messages, instead of more topically suitable ones like a specific Tsubasa emote, Hibiki emote, or whatever
it's ok i guess. it's mostly fanart that goes in there
the only other discord i frequent that has a starboard is the r/nichijou one
yes
in another discord im in heres how they organize things
though there also has to be a balance between too few channels vs. too many & too granular channels
imo the best channel choices depend on the server. if there are enough ppl already talking about tech-specific stuff on a day-to-day basis, it may make sense to create a dedicated channel to it
funny how the turns table lol

a server im in has been using them for feature requests and bug reports <:HibikiWhoops:585839808115507222>

by the sequels? (I still need to get around to watching them some day)
overridden or superseded
I'm randomly reminded of Star Wars, which has multiple official levels of canon https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars_expanded_to_other_media#Holocron_database_and_canonicity
'Hibiki has been strangely secretive and evasive and sneaking out late recently for some reason'
headcanon workaround: everything in that comic is a nightmare Miku has in S1 back when Hibiki is still keeping Symphogear a secret from her
..............<:HibikiWhat:336656482907193344> nah
we self-insert Miku into the self-insert to make them not a self-insert

`So I saw someone posted an edited memoria card regarding Halloween. Funny enough, I did the same last year, but with the theme of the tradition in my country: "Day of the dead", the tradition tells us that the souls of our loved ones that passed away come to visit us in November 1st and 2nd, so we prepare offerings for them, including food and drinks these people enjoyed when they were alive, among many other things.`

`So with that in mind, I edited this memoria card.`

wait a minute
did someone say FIS bots?
just thinking about it is rather nerve-wracking <:HibikiTired:422925410490253313>
or what if you do a Bikki circa GX episode 4 and are suddenly unable to transform while falling through the sky?
...like, what if you accidentally lose your grip on your relic and it goes flying away in the wind?
I've always thought those mid-air transformations to be super dangerous and risky
this design reminds me a bit of EdgeBikki's hoodie

next episode: "oops wrong number"
iirc Shenshoujing completely Shenshoujing'd itself so if it ever does appear again I think it'll be a separate fragment
`the gear system was invented by Ryoko` (huh didn't know that)
re: the terrorist attack, I think they were trying to bait the Symphogears into fighting to gather up phonic gain to awaken Nephy
I think a very strong sense of paranoia and distrust against foreign governments could explain a lot of the "pretend to be terrorists" thing
(like Syndrome a.k.a. Buddy)
create a big problem, and then solve it, be lauded a hero
imo Ver's motivations were relatively clear cut
(I kinda wanted Shirabe to cut in with her signature "hypocrite" during their confrontation against SG et al. in AXZ)
they wanted to establish a presence?
~~inb4 backup moon~~
even if Gen's been secretly a god this whole time, I feel like unless he's been hiding some major aspect of his personality, he isn't the type of person who'd be interested in taking over the world
Miku: "So I'm thinking of a summer wedding, not too large a ceremony, just our closest friends"
Hibiki: "But we're not engaged?"
Miku: "...Dammit, *knew* I was forgetting something..."
my wild prediction for the season finale: instead of a hype final battle it's just going to be Bikki talk-no-jutsuing God
~~I think all the mods are asleep~~
not that I have any problem with 2, Akira Toriyama's stories are very fun and enjoyable even though he very self-deprecatingly admits he mostly just makes up stuff as he goes along
there are two extremes, I guess
1. writers who plan out everything, beginning middle end, before they even start writing
2. writers who just make up everything as they go
my favourite ep 1 will always be Awakening Heartbeat from S1 <:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
the thing that really drew me into Symphogear at first were the character dynamics, so I haven't been enjoying the later seasons as much as the S1 and G
the animation quality and battle stuff were very good but I guess I'm just not as interested in that sort of thing
personally I didn't feel that hyped about XV episode 1
half-expecting her original name to be Kaguya or something else moon-related
a while ago I saw a fanart where Shirabe had her hair down and she reminded me a lot of Kaguya Houraisan
that's one thing I'm really looking forward to this season
yeah
hmmm
FIS gave her a provisional name based on the possessions that she had because she forgot her name due to amnesia, so if there's a family reunion at some point, are they going to dig up her original name at some point?...
so with the "Shirabe's parents died in a car crash" thing brought up in the XV initial bio blurbs, I wonder if we'll see more about her family/past this season
when it comes to beings with godly powers though I'd guess that there was some kind of schism between them and some of them killed each other, because they'd be powerful enough to do that
~~one of them accidentally tripped and fell down some stairs and died~~
~~maybe one of them just died from old age~~
if you die on Earth you die in real life
hey aliens can die on Earth just as easily as anywhere else
am I remembering wrong
I thought the Custodians *were* aliens
convenient amnesia though
that'd be sad
GX -> XDU - > AXZ -> cross
X for cross
if they do ignore it entirely I will be very cross
concerts are **cursed**
<@456226577798135808> I think happy mood OST also appeared in G episode 3, when they were preparing for the school festival
I feel like the timeline keeps shifting
<@456226577798135808> Otome no Junketsu? (G OST 2)
all this architecture stuff reminded me of the Citigroup tower in New York where they found out that due to a calculation error the building would actually collapse if winds were strong enough but they didn't want to panic anyone (or lose reputation) so they secretly repaired the building without informing the public <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citigroup_Center#History>
it's 2045, stadiums are supposed to be absurd
re: Saint-Germain: I think that 129k count is on top of the 75k or thereabouts count that she already had before she died
(I still need to get around to watching Jojo one of these days)
Crunchyroll pls
||"We've no interested in what's left of the corpse."||

how does he reconcile "for the glory of Japan" and "70,000 dead or missing"
if he really was propping up the Illuminati remnants behind the scenes
it looks like she tried to use it on Bikki as well, but it only confused her briefly
was its only effect keeping Tsubasa unconscious longer than usual?
so, Millaarc's eye hypnotism thing
story/characters far more important for me
tbh I don't really mind low animation budgets
the OST that plays when Americans are scheming things...
Uncle Sam = America, I'm guessing
from the transferring Durandal plan in S1 episode 5
I recognized this nostalgic OST track from S1 at the beginning of the episode
"good plan"
"yeah let's just get some more blood from the same city where literally all the Symphogear users live"
clearly they can travel around
the facility that Vanessa attacked was in America, right?
vampire girl should've went for a hospital that was far farrr away from any possible Symphogear users
Bikki birthday calendar is from AXZ episode 12
these are not consistent?...
https://www.timeanddate.com/calendar/?year=2044&country=26

I feel like the timeline shifts for each season, though
July 20, 1969, 20:17 UTC
on this exact minute on this exact day 50 years ago, Apollo 11 landed on the moon!

I may be remembering wrong, but didn't Fudou used to be head of Division 2?
~~I am uncultured~~
~~I haven't seen that clip~~
<@!188714906143424513> I think it'd be absolutely hilarious if they broke the fourth wall and were like "oh no the custodians destroyed our animation budget now we have to defeat them even though we're stick figures right now"
I vaguely recall someone mentioning that he was forced to resign after Div2 lost Ichaival under his watch
they're doing amazing work
who's doing these meme reaction charts?
~~is that why Fudou keeps talking about blood~~
~~does that mean Tsubasa is a vampire too~~
but is vampirism hereditary?
I was thinking 'wait how did he do that'
<@185949743321579520> yeah I noticed that too
Kirika > Hibiki > Shirabe > Chris
*[removes ship goggles]* that does seem like a reasonable interpretation

so that everyone's on the same page
`380,000 km` that's the average distance between the Earth and the Moon
that he could handle them
I don't think Fudou would walk into a location with known superpowered enemy combatants with only a few no-name suited men to back him up if he wasn't confident
iirc even back in S1 Miku noticed that Hibiki was starting to put on some muscle
that would have been an amazing plot twist
for a moment there I thought no-name glasses character was about to gain the power of the gods
The Earth has a radius of ~6,300 km
THAT'S EVEN BIGGER THAN THE EARTH
<@279341087494242304> 380,000 km is the distance between the Earth and the Moon
OVA reference, yay
she's still working on it in her free time

I love Symphogear
Vanessa: 'wtf'
I had to pause the video, I was laughing so hard
when I was watching I completely lost it when Ogawa ninja'd his car
magical yellow alchemic skype windows are so convenient
I see no difference
hmmm imagine Kirika with ninja powers
I'm happy Ogawa is a responsible grown-up
so he still has plausible deniability, in some sense
just the typical ramblings for old man Fudou
it wouldn't have really sounded anything out of the ordinary
or if anyone overheard that phone call
if it turned out that Millaarc hadn't successfully put the seal control on Tsubasa
it's so simple and subtle
but have to appreciate whoever designed that seal control technique
totally a dick move from Fudou, using supernatural trickery to manipulate Tsubasa like that

https://twitter.com/M33716330/status/1160269967909982208
they're so fortunate to have Ogawa on their side
that would be so bad for the protagonists
if Ogawa were a villain character
my first impression was that it was AIM Burst sized
hmmm
which one is Hibiki and which one is Miku

~~inb4 aliens revealed in episode 12, the day after the Area 51 storm event~~
from G OST 4
and possessed!Miku has a truly intimidating presence
it feels really otherworldly
I think Miku's transformation is my favourite one this season now
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
also AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
finally caught up with all the messages here
<:MikuPraise:585839808765493249>
I would be impressed if they could make that happen
gosh darned antimemes
Fudou always seems so confident and "all according to keikaku" it's always so satisfying when he's shocked about something
"eh I'll just stand here at let my ~~granddaughter~~ daughter sing and transform"
"eh I'll just stand here and let these two have a touching final moment"
Fudou feeling very confident this episode
is he a ninja too or something
also, Fudou HAND SEALS
thanks for that bit of narration Fudou
"The Murakumo, which I value as highly as my own life!"
Fudou was so hammy this episode
Prelati?
the dude's literally cackling as he's trying to kill his ~~granddaughter~~ daughter
Fudou's so evil/messed up
ooooooooof
just watched the episode
the transformation chant takes a bit of time
she's probably not going to wait to let them transform like Fudou did
but the Gear users would be so screwed if Kamiku got to them before they had a chance to transform
it probably won't happen though
threat level of Kamiku has been elevated though
it looks like Kamiku cut the three of them at the waist so Vanessa has the highest chance of surviving that imo, since she has an android-like body
not believing they're dead until they show the bodies
you remember what happened with Prelati and Cags
interestingly enough Hibiki was saying "I might be cursed" even before hearing that whole "I think humanity is cursed" thing from Ryouko
after the end credits, were the lunar ruins powering up again?
"long gone" how old is Fudou anyway
even though she wasn't transformed
Tsubasa did leap an impossibly high distance from her motorcycle
in season 1 episode 2
wellll
Seal Control doesn't really leave any evidence
he could just punch through the walls
how would they even contain him
"probably"
without being sliced in half from a distance or sth
going to be sort of difficult to get close enough
even assuming they decide on that as a valid strategy
for me, GX OVAs > G OVAs > G > S1 > AXZ > GX
my favourite cliffhanger in G was Fin√© Kirika
Lafcadio Hearn?
Noble Red only wanted to be normal again but they fell in with the wrong crowd
me, later in GX: "wait nvm"
me, in GX: "wow, bold of them to kill off the main antagonist in the middle of the season like that"
I was so sure that she would be dead for sure after that happened
well Carol was completely disintegrated into ashes right in front of everyone
List of people who have previously "definitely" died:
- Hibiki
- Chris
- Tsubasa
- Hibiki, Tsubasa, and Chris (again)
- Miku
- Carol
- Dr. Ver
- Cagliostrio
- Prelati
- Miku (again)
with "definitely dead" characters
this series has a history
I'm still skeptical <:KirikaSkeptical:586406806482583556>
<:MikuPraise:585839808765493249> <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
Madoka x Homura?
it depends on what Shem Ha thinks of it as, I guess
I remember Hibiki asking this at one point but I don't remember the answer
I forgot, why do they rely on teenage girls to fight again?
Millaarc: 'is this karma'
I loved that Maria was the one who snapped Tsubasa out of the seal's control
This was a great moment
<:KirikaSpook:605209108827734017>
notice in this episode he most likely knew that the government agents were coming to arrest him and instead of evading them he was just waiting for them
he seems like the type who'd rather either win outright or perish in the attempt
running away doesn't really fit his character imo
just to screw with her mind, I guess
in the heat of the battle he seemed perfectly willing to die by Tsubasa's sword
hm at this point I'm not sure what his plan is anymore
same energy


a hypothetical matchup that would be really hype to see would be Fudou vs. Granny Makabe
random thought
he is an old

<@202536957685923841> decoy moon?
iirc the Mob Psycho 100 stage play had Mob's seiyuu play the role of Mob
Symphogear: The Musical: The Series: The Movie
I wouldn't have noticed for sure if this hadn't been pointed out here
I think I felt that the animation felt vaguely... flatter? but otherwise I don't really notice things like this
~~too late, it's probably already animated <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>~~
is that the moon has 1/6 the gravity of Earth
I thing I hope the animators remember in the next episode
they just completely skipped over Yatsuhiro's funeral, so I think they are trying to fit everything in the remaining 3 episodes
how many unresolved plot threads are there at the moment anyway?
I don't know much about the anime industry, so I have no idea
dess
today's <:KirikaSpook:605209108827734017>
<@279341087494242304> isn't that basically what Fin√© did with Ryouko's body?
ah, the advanced alchemic technique of copypaste
"But I'm no longer a God, this sucks"
"I've defeated the Gear users"
or maybe Shem-ha forcibly steps down from being a god just so that she can defeat Hibiki
Shem-ha: "Okay, I will stop trying to take over the world now"
Hibiki: <talk-no-jutsu>
<@185949743321579520> half-expecting that to actually happen
<@440138597539119114> that's not very aerodynamic
the thing is, shemha isn't at her full power yet
oof
"well, that backfired" ‚Äî NR, probably
I didn't understand this part really well, did Shem-ha purposefully give some of her power to NR? Or did she just try to kill them and they somehow absorbed some of her power and healed?
~~maybe it's because I don't watch that much anime~~
~~I should pay more attention to voice actors, I don't recognize most of these names~~
<@87512939107450880> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSO3SfHmbYY
I like Kamiku's voice though
~~I didn't understood that reference~~
the first thing I thought of was Geass too
why would you say that even as a joke
Lulu how could you
0√∑0 = NaN, easy
"SEE WHAT I MEAN!?" ‚Äî Shem-ha, probably


oh yeah, I thought this moment was pretty funny
End the curse of Balal to... do what again?
What is Shem-ha's end goal, anyway?
edge works
new cast where the main character is the girl that Bikki saved in S1
"Moon dust actually turns out to be really toxic, oops" ‚Äî Cave Johnson (founder of Aperture Science), probably
making beef stroganoff out of the moon? that's crazy talk
~~The final antagonist was Noble Red? No, it was Fudou? No, it was Miku? No, it was Shem-ha? No, it was actually the spirit of Beef Stroganoff, which has secretly been taking more and more of Itaba's body and will soon be putting its dastardly plan into action in an episode or two~~
I like Apple
off the top of my head (wrt translation doubts):
- "one trillion degrees!"
- "minus 5100 degrees"
- "119.6% chance of being the Antikythera Gear"
a fun idea for a list would be "all the times Symphogear made us doubt the translation's accuracy"
"Please don't be another Ryouko" ‚Äî Hibiki, probably
humans still won't understand each other and they'll still keep fighting each other because the curse of balal has been active for too long, so the effects are just kind of permanent
it'd just make them a bit more susceptible to being possessed by Shem-ha / using divine power, but that's about it
e.g. people won't suddenly gain telepathy or understand each other or suddenly know the universal language
wild theory: it'll turn out that disabling the curse of balal actually won't really change much
does that mean this was foreshadowing
new running gag?

anyway, I noticed exchanges like these happening a lot this episode
this was a really cute moment


in today's episode
according to MAL at least, all 5 girls (Homura, Madoka, Kyouko, Mami, Sayaka) and Kyuubey are main characters
also, fun fact: on MAL, the characters are displayed in order by number of member favourites (after separating main and supporting, of course)
and according to MAL, the 6 girl users (Hibiki, Chris, Tsubasa, Maria, Kirika, Shirabe) are main characters, while Miku is a supporting character
that's an oddly happy coincidence <:ShirabeEmbarassed:336657288477671436>
and *huh*, I only just now found out that Shirabe's XV album was released on my birthday
so I saw Shirabe's XV B-side linked above <https://symphogear.fandom.com/wiki/Kimi_ga_Nakanai_Sekai_ni>
*catching up on last couple of days of messages*
üî• üî• IGNITION üî• üî•
can't help but think they're related somehow
Shem-ha's creepy ear lick also reminded me of Fin√©
Shem-ha's "revive using DNA" thing sounds very similar to Fin√©'s "revive using DNA" thing
'lol that pink-haired woman is fighting with the severed arm of that guy I stabbed once' ‚Äî Shem-ha, probably
that was sort of a running gag/theme this episode: Shem-ha just saying what she's feeling
why did the coffin surface, again? did something prompt it to do so?
interesting quirk


since that's the usual best practice in a security context when your systems have been infected with a virus or something
I wonder if there's a faction of the Custodians who take the position "we should have just nuked the planet from orbit"
"where we're going we don't need smiles"
by the way, when they first entered the control room, anyone recognize this nostalgic track from S1?
shouldn't it just have remained buried forever
why did the coffin surface again?
sooo... aliens created humanity so that they can use them as a supercomputer?...
Airgetlam OP
I love how HibiChris and DMJii and Noble Red have to fight off the defense systems and meanwhile TsubaMaria just waltz right into the control room

the most advanced of alchemic techniques ‚úÇ üìã
*[advanced hacking intensifies]*
Enki: "You're dying, stop it"
Enki: "Shem-ha please stop with the raunchy jokes"
Shem-ha: [struggling to speak] "H...ha... you're... impaling me... on your sword"
if this anime had had more budget and time, would have been fun to see the Gears and Noble Red comically struggling to fight each other in the unusual environment
I mean, it's super advanced alien technology, so I'm not surprised
that's on a whole nother level
but artificial gravity manipulation
air pressure, even humans can do that
fair enough, I'll take it


so last week, I brought up the gravity on the Moon
but Shem-ha is also only at a fraction of her true power
and then the direction of the fight can rapidly tip towards either side
in high-energy fights like these, all it takes is one slight mistake
nifty tricks can still win over strength and experience in the end
she almost had 'im
for a non-combatant, I think she did pretty well
episode 7458: Enki vs. Shem-ha! The Tragic Final Battle!
we caught a glimpse of the tail end of some very long shounen series
seems about right to me
and it's a sign that there's a change of pace from the usual fare, and variety is always nice to have
that initial moment of doubt is always fun
tbh I love it when that happens
https://space.stackexchange.com/questions/840/how-fast-will-1g-get-you-there
assuming constant acceleration with turnaround at the halfway point to begin deceleration, I think it's possible to get from the Moon to the Earth in a few hours
i.e. a brick joke
and then in the final episode right when everything seems lost it conveniently falls down and hits Shem-ha from behind, distracting her for the valuable moment needed for Miku to regain control
flies off into space
blasts a hole through the wall
it misses
Chris fires it
water pressure is a scary thing
deep sea shenanigans are always a bit nerve-wracking
when I was in grade 8 my science teacher showed the movie *Das Boot* to the class
and a fountain of blood sprays out of the exploded submarine
I don't think we've really seen much interaction yet between these two
Genjuurou & Carolnein tag team battle would be really cool to watch
~~all~~ most of their best fighters are stuck on the moon!
oh no!
and Earth is in trouble!
all of their best fighters are stuck on the moon!

hm do we know if Shirabe forgot her given name, or was it both her given name and family name?
but there's not enough episodes, I guess
I would have liked to see more backstory

this is amazing XD
https://megadethzenbu.tumblr.com/post/187723968556/legit-what-do-i-even-classify-this-as
hm apparently the mods of the original Touhou wikia wanted to relocate to a separate host because they didn't like the ads, but wikia staff didn't like this, so they removed all the notices linking to the new wiki and replaced the mod team, so that's why there are still 2 Touhou wikis https://www.reddit.com/r/touhou/comments/5s9qjq/til_theres_2_touhou_wikis_because_the_the_older/
actually upon searching, it looks like a wikia for Touhou and Puella Magi still exist; it's just that there are non-wikia hosted versions as well, and usually they appear higher in google search results
because I notice those aren't hosted on Wikia/Fandom
I wonder if that's what happened with the Touhou wiki and the Puella Magi wiki
unfortunate to hear that the Symphogear wikia turned out this way, then
I'm not familiar with the Symphogear wiki though
anyone can edit a wiki, so it might be just a few problematic editors, or maybe an inexperienced one who doesn't know any better
well, I think generalizing an entire wiki as "they" is a bit...
"toxic community", however... that's more difficult to fix
"facts with headcanon", "terrible song tls", "unfinished articles" are all things that can be fixed; wikis are often incomplete because it's a collaborative process. Improvement is always possible, and those aren't dealbreakers.
oh my
but then their comment below that
I was originally going to give this person the benefit of the doubt; I thought perhaps they don't necessarily support Fudou per se, but they can understand Fudou's thought process and they were trying to explain it
I'm out of the loop, is there anything wrong with the wiki?
<:KirikaSkeptical:586406806482583556>
but in all seriousness, Vanessa looks a fair bit older than 19 imo
you can be 8
do you mean Vanessa?
*whose child is this*
"I am here to scheme acts of terrorism with my older companions"
because if the latter, then that's just really sad <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
is she older than she looks, or is she actually as young as she looks?
do we know how old Elsa is?
if humans are like computer terminals in the lore of Symphogear, then...
it's not like I was expecting it, but when it happened, I was like, 'oh, of course'
tbh as someone who took a computer security course last term, I didn't really mind the Shem-ha Vanessa thing that much
there's a tvtropes page for it I believe
benefitting the villains instead of the heroes
basically that, except the other way
~~remember, DNA is hackable~~
that would activate under certain circumstances
I imagine when Shem-ha revived Noble Red, she snuck in some sneaky code
maybe she's just taking Kirika's lead?
yeah, hmm
Shirabe and Kirika are both kind of young
but in any case, in the context of the situation itself, I don't think it's too farfetched
but I can live with DMJii doing the rapid about turn
it would be out of character for Tsubasa or Maria
personally I think for DMJii at least that's not too out of character for them
but they kind of make it hard
I really want to like them
tbh I have very confusing and conflicting feelings about Noble Red
<https://gurrenprime.tumblr.com/post/187864955813/megadethzenbu-when-your-kouhais-are-giving>
<https://hoina-hysteria.tumblr.com/post/187872037119/and-also-the-tens-of-thousands-of-people-in-that>
on the topic of Noble Red...
something like that
67 steps in the wrong direction, 1 step in the right direction
in my view, they made a half-decent initial step towards redemption, but they were nowhere close to being redeemed
(so my main gripe with episode 12 was I felt really sad for Noble Red but I also felt bad about feeling sad for Noble Red because of what they've done so I just felt really conflicted)
~~she tried, I'll give her that~~
Millaarc pls
~~Millaarc: "I left my umbrella at home but then it started raining! How ironic"~~
Millaarc: "who would have thought that I, who earlier mind controlled the actions of other people, would be mind controlled myself! how ironic" (unnecessarily explaining the joke)
Millaarc: "oh no"
Shem-ha: "Mind seal"
ah, it just occurred to me, it would've been really nice karmic justice if Shem-ha had taken control of Millaarc instead of Vanessa
or maybe the ~~Majin mark~~ ~~Geass~~ Shem-ha mark on their foreheads can also serve that purpose
Shem-ha basically had free rein to do what she wished with NR's bodies when reviving them though, so it probably wouldn't be too difficult to slip a mind control chip in there or something
on the other hand, curse of balal
on one hand, she easily hijacked Miku's body
hm
that's amazing
in Nichijou, each guest narrator appears in a single episode, speaking only for 15 seconds after the end credits

what about Alca Noise
the endings have always been a bit rushed imo; especially G. There were a lot of loose ends about what happened afterwards, so that's why I really like the OVAs, because they always help give some closure.
also, Shirabe's song is just really catchy
I didn't really like Chris's XV song at first, but it grew on me and now I think it's my favourite this season
"you may think it's a long walk to the store down the street but that's just peanuts compared to space"
idea 1: the custodians are all dead and Enki and Shem-ha were the last ones of their species
idea 2: the custodians all went off somewhere and they'll find out about the shenanigans on Earth in several hundred years or so (due to the speed of light delay) and they'll come back to the Earth in the year 3xxx to eliminate the threat
~~what about more KEYWORDS~~

either way, I feel like it'd be somewhat more consistent and it'd make more sense if Chris's parents were there as well...
hm, are we approaching this from an in-universe technical perspective, or an out-of-universe artistic perspective?
I'm half-hoping they just forgot Chris's parents and they'll be put in in the BDs
on an unrelated note, I just remembered that someone edited together the XV DMJii songs a while ago, so here it is: https://kazanaritsubasa.tumblr.com/post/186578496057/so-this-time-around-it-seems-they-mixed-up-the

this all sounds very relatable
~~my main observation is that the whole Vic thing can spark some *very* polarized responses~~
~~I still don't really know much about the specifics~~
~~tbh I'm not really up to date on english dub stuff so when I first heard about the Vic thing a while ago it kinda blindsighted me~~
just learned about this and I did a double-take at the headlines
re: Hawaii: https://twitter.com/AstroKatie/status/1151507062309969922
I first watched that asteroids magic school bus episode when I was like in first grade and it kinda traumatized me for a while
oof asteroids
so accurate orbital calculations and measurements are important
(would be so awkward)
then we just nudged the asteroid's trajectory closer towards the center of the Earth, oops
buuuuut I'm just saying, if there's some systematic error in the calculation and the asteroid actually would hit far more right than originally projected
ok lemme try to explain with a diagram. Say the projected path of the asteroid looks something like this. Then the natural course of action would be to try to deflect the asteroid as far left as possible in the time constraints given, so that it can clear the Earth with as much margin as possible.
ugh me bad with words
but then refined measurements reveal that the original trajectory was actually farther to the right than we thought
e.g. say measurements predict that the asteroid will hit on this side of the Earth, so we start nudging the asteroid so that the asteroid will pass by on the left
an Earth's diameter is pretty small in the grand scheme of things
~~that would be awkward~~
~~also it would really suck if due to inaccurate measurements we thought the asteroid was going to hit the Earth but it was actually a near miss and in trying to nudge the asteroid off course we nudged its trajectory into hitting Earth instead~~
because there isn't enough time
in which diverting off course wouldn't be feasible
the largest issue would probably be if it's on too short notice
and over a long enough time that could add up to enough to make the asteroid miss the Earth
if we know it early enough, we could just send a probe or solar sail or something up there to apply a very small but constant amount of delta v to the asteroid
the earlier in advance we know an asteroid is coming, the more time we have to divert it
Better would be to increase funding to astronomers so that we can have more comprehensive sky surveys and accurate measurements of all the asteroids out there

there are also these media guidelines on the matter of suicide reporting https://suicideprevention.ca/Media
re: suicides: where I live at least, the local transit agency has a policy of not releasing suicide information or statistics to the public, citing reasons of wanting to avoid copycat suicides. The statistics were unknown to the public until 2009, when a newspaper invoked the Municipal Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act to have the transit agency release these statistics to the public.
I guess they're sort of related in that a balance between freedom of information and privacy needs to be assessed
hm
> 1 The purposes of this Act are,
> (a) to provide a right of access to information under the control of institutions in accordance with the principles that,
> (i) information should be available to the public,
> (ii) necessary exemptions from the right of access should be limited and specific, and
> (iii) decisions on the disclosure of information should be reviewed independently of the institution controlling the information; and
> (b) to protect the privacy of individuals with respect to personal information about themselves held by institutions and to provide individuals with a right of access to that information.  R.S.O. 1990, c. M.56, s. 1.
for the instance I was talking about, I believe the main thing released was the count of attempts and count of total incidents

mhm
where I live, it's in the middle of a city, so the officials over here probably aren't too concerned about that
true
so I think for those, they might have been electronically counted
but for my provincial and municipal elections, I marked my choices with a black sharpie on a scantron-like form (colour in the bubble completely etc.) They came in a fancy privacy envelope thing where you could still have a bit of the paper showing without revealing the choices. When I finished marking that one, I gave it to the official, who then turned the envelope upside down and fed the paper into a machine of some sort
so for us, I think federal is still paper manual counting
for my federal election, I marked my choice with a pencil on a piece of paper listing the options. I folded it up, and then gave it to the official. The official then tore off a small detachable slip part from the paper, and then gave the main folded paper back to me, and then I put it through the slit into the box
hm it occurred to me that where I live at least üá®üá¶, the municipal and provincial elections use slightly different counting systems than the federal one
I wouldn't really have any reservations about using such a system, in any case
that sounds decently secure to me
"sealed windowed screen" I'm having trouble visualizing this, what do you mean exactly?
what is on the paper slip?
mainly because there's a paper trail so that if something goes wrong, it can be manually recounted/audited etc. if need be
the first, I'm pretty okay with
hm is it a machine you feed in the slips and it counts it, or is it one where it's like there's a screen and you input your responses on the screen?
but this as well https://xkcd.com/2030/
afterwards I was scrolling up and I saw "an expensive pencil" and I was like 'hmm wait a minute, that sounds familiar...' <:HibikiOhNo:586337444597596202>

oh it's been a while since I last read that fanfic
uuum, anyway, some other items on my list are: playing some Go, playing some Tetris, or playing some Touhou
(usually the months I get the most exercise is when I'm on a study term, because my residence is like 10 minutes away from campus and so I always end up leaving late so I end up having to run to make it to class in time)
me: `oof that's me`
on a semi-related note, this was actually in the news here today:
> The new report gives Canadians over the age of 18 a D for overall physical activity, finding most spend far too much time sitting and not enough time getting heart-pumping exercise.
tbh because I'm kind of lazy about going outside, I usually just end up pacing back and forth indoors a lot
oof
another thing on my list is going for a walk / exercising and tiring myself out
things like washing socks, doing the dishes, cleaning the washroom, etc.
when I do something mechanical / mind-numbing / repetitive, I usually I feel more refreshed and motivated afterwards
(I also have a Word file where I just dump all of my super fluffy fanfic idea drabbles, so sometimes I go back in there and reread that)
another thing on my list is to try reading some super fluffy fanfics
(I'm usually somewhat sleep-deprived these days, so that's somewhat easy)
usually I just try to sleep it off
I keep a list of things for me to try when I get hit by something super overwhelming like that, but I'm not even sure how effective any of these ideas are for me, let alone other people

<:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
usually I find Whose Line Is It Anyway clips or You Suck At Cooking videos to be helpful for this
and the last item on my list (at the moment) is: "watch some stupid funny videos (laughing is good for mental health)"
(*well it's really fun if you win a game but it's kinda discouraging if you lose a game)
Go is great fun
for me at least, those games in particular require a lot of focus and mental exertion

wait, I think I'm reading that wrong
so nowadays I tend to adjust my clothing level based on whether I'm wearing my headphones or not to keep things level
I notice that I'm also a bit more irritable if my headphones are on (they're over-the-ears headphones, so they do trap a lot of heat)
My theory is that it has something to do with how much ambient heat there is
e.g. sometimes my computer just seems to be doing everything it can to make me annoyed by lagging and freezing and whatnot, but after I take off my sweater, it's somehow easier for me to calm down
For some reason, I find that I'm a tad less irritable if I take off a layer of clothes (if I'm wearing more than one layer)
and for option 2, there's a long list of valid forms of id
this is what we have here in Canada, btw <https://www.elections.ca/content.aspx?section=vot&dir=ids&document=index&lang=e>
I'm slowly bringing her up to date on modern internetspeak

and she's always washed her hands excessively even before all this, so hopefully she won't catch it
on the other hand, she ran marathons in her youth and likes exercise and sports unlike me
also I hear a lot about how the fatality rate for young and healthy people is low, don't worry, but it just occurred to me that my mom is 59 years old and works in an airport, so... concern

semi-related, but there's also something called the "euphemism treadmill"
idk
but the change might feel more natural to the younger kids?
language changes over time
might be a generational/demographic thing
yeah, I feel like there's a spectrum of which words feel appropriate and which words feel more uncomfortable
mhm
I agree about whitelist/blacklist
but anyway that's just my uninformed take
at this point, I feel like common usage of these words are far enough removed from the racial implications that the knee-jerk backlash that making the change will inevitably cause might cause more harm than benefit
it's where it gets to changing words like "whitelist" and "blacklist" that is perhaps a bit too extreme for me
imo terms like "master/slave" are kinda vaguely uncomfortable, if there are better terms that can be used without causing any harm in readability, I don't mind the change
e.g. NASA's made this change too (not sure how recently, might have been ages ago), preferring "crewed" over "manned" when referring to missions etc.
like, words like "man hours" or gendered pronouns (defaulting to he/him/his), I feel there's pretty much no harm and some benefit in changing to more inclusive terms
my personal opinion on most of this is mostly a general feeling of indifference, but it varies depending on the term
this one's from 2 years ago: https://bugs.python.org/issue34660
ah, found another example I vaguely remembered
this one was from 5 years ago btw, so it's not like it's a particularly new idea

stuff you like and comment on might also show up on your friends' newsfeeds though, and I'm not sure if there's a way to control that
mm there are settings for things you post and share
if they see your post and then scroll down into the comments, then they would be able to see that person's comments, then
hmm
if you don't want your co-workers to see teh thighs, it should be safe as long as you avoid liking/reacting/commenting on any of those risque posts
stuff shouldn't show up on the timeline on your profile unless you actively press the share button tho
sometimes it shows you stuff your friends liked, sometimes it doesn't?
actually, Facebook newsfeed is very screwy, I'm not sure either
timeline or newsfeed?

ah and there are also comments like this in response to inktober tweets https://twitter.com/23bloggingdogs/status/1311672176601374721
(not sure if this is normal or not, I didn't really become aware of inktober until around last year)
mainly because I was looking in the inktober tag on tumblr and like... everyone's doing different prompt lists
mm that was last year, but apparently there's been some fresh drama happening more recently
I'm a bit out of the loop o.o
does anyone know what's happening with inktober?

maybe it's that "you feel better at first but then it gets worse" thing
https://twitter.com/doremypuyotet/status/1329631801560752129
that reminds me, there's a tetris player/youtuber/streamer I admire, and he tweeted this recently: https://twitter.com/doremypuyotet/status/1329631800457654274
tbh most of my list is dumb silly stuff like "ooh a lot of people emote-reacted to my comment" so idk if this would be helpful or not
what I do personally is just start keeping a list, and if I do something that I feel good about myself about, I write it down before I forget about it
so if you can't think of much that you're proud of yourself for, it doesn't mean that those things don't exist, it just means that it's not easily accessible in your memory at the moment
I think negativity bias means that things of a negative nature are just inherently more memorable than positive things
sadge
sometimes I really wish people could just calmly talk things out like reasonable adults
oof that sucks

meanwhile on a non-politics related note
23 that's too young üò¢
<:HibikiHug:620080558462205956>
yeah, eventually
oof
I'm not sure what to suggest for that, but feeling like you're dissociated from what you're doing doesn't sound like a comfortable situation <:HibikiTired:422925410490253313>
idk it's similar but I just remember having a sort of mini-existential crisis/overthinking it thing when I was in high school and I was like 'when I'm watching TV, what am I actually doing? am I repeating their lines in my head? am I just having the video frames appear in my mind?' sort of similar to when I overthink how walking works and then I stumble
hrm that sounds like something I might have experienced on several isolated moments before, but normally it's not like that for me
sometimes profs are not the best, unfortunate
<:ZweiHug:672455346949980170>
I hope you manage to figure something out for that
oof
well tbf it can't really tell u for sure if someone plagiarized, all it does is detect program similarity
for programming, there's moss for plagiarism detection
it depends a lot on the people in the fandom
mm I can believe that
I guess if people just don't do this and then everyone can be cool :p https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJX4ytfqw6k
it's just always important to remember that not everyone has the same interests, and if someone doesn't like something you like, that's perfectly valid. don't attack them over it. Then ppl can peacefully coexist
and imo I find doing stuff like writing and drawing in a fandom really fulfilling and fun because we can share in our enjoyment of a shared interest
I generally enjoy fandom and a lot of the ppl I interact with online is because of fandom
yes, pretty much. I think I agree with that
I'm reminded of this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DgNSTBDEV4U
politics, sports, celebrities, academia, etc.
I feel like this true for things in general
what's a fed
mm personally I'm a very introvert/conflict-avoidant kind of person, so even if I someone I actually follow posted/reblogged something that makes me uncomfortable/squicks me out/is very yikes, I would probably just do nothing and pretend I didn't see it ^_^;;
ye I know of some ppl in the touhou fandom who've quit using tumblr because of bad experiences there (I think it was related to shipping discourse). That's entirely fair.
that would kinda make sense, I guess?
my experience on Tumblr has been pleasant for the most part, but I occupy kind of a niche part of the site tbh
like with any place on the internet, there are good parts and bad parts of any site
<:ZweiHug:672455346949980170>
sad news <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
interesting thread https://twitter.com/holden/status/1397197778577731591
.
kinda amusing that the topic of discussion went the direction it did like, right after I shared that link <:ShirabePout:336656831978012712>
I feel like ppl are really attributing malice to actions to where malice probably really isn't there
but from my brief exposure to him as like a passive viewer
as someone who's watched some of dream's minecraft videos and read some stuff about the whole dream cheating thing because yay math (im a nerd), obviously I don't really know dream as a person
first world problems at its finest but eh <:HibikiTired:422925410490253313>
imo this is a good neutral perspective on the whole dream thing (if you're really bored and have nothing to do for an hour lol) (lots of fun technical details) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3Yzk-3SZfs
iirc he was brought up in a conservative environment and used to be a Trump supporter but has since drifted to the left after being exposed to more diverse viewpoints on the internet
I'm still willing to give him the benefit of the doubt bc he's a young kid and he seems open-minded and willing to learn and better himself
in his earlier collab video with notch I also remember him joking about gay and Harry Potter and Dumbledore? (I don't really remember) and it kinda rubbed me the wrong way
he's definitely said some yikes stuff before
yeah I've seen the tweet threads about that
but from his videos he just seems like ordinary guy
idk maybe I dont know everything
does he?
the only side effects I had from the first one was a sore arm
hope you feel better soon
oof <:MikuCry:688397678584791074>
(they already got theirs)
I haven't gotten my second dose yet (it's scheduled for next week) but I remember my mother and older brother mentioning it hits stronger
I hear it usually hits harder than the first dose bc your body has a stronger immune response
~~cognitive ball therapy~~
I hope we can improve in the future
oof Canada is pretty bad too <:HibikiTired:422925410490253313>
my favourite season is late autumn and my favourite kind of weather is overcast
I feel like internet things are like designed to pull in me attention and get my trapped in a cycle of constantly refreshing, scrolling through feeds, etc., so even tho I rarely get away from my computer, when I do, I'm like 'wow this is refreshing, _why dont i do this more often D:_'
tbh I feel like any time away from a computer at all helps a lot, even if that means just walking around aimlessly for a while
some of my coworkers who are more social than me sometimes say things like "oh i did some badminton over the weekend" (or was it volleyball? i dont even remember :p)
maybe just going for a walk outside? exercise? sports?
i spend way too much time inside too so i can't really help much here but I hope you figure out something that works for you <:ChrisPray:672578403156885504>
ye I feel like that kind of tone is like, the opposite of productive towards actually getting more ppl vaccinated
but the fact that both parents and past students are speaking up in favour of the teacher gives me pause
it obviously doesn't excuse what the teacher did
to actually require an assembly to be called about it
what on earth the students could have done
I am curious though
tru tru
the reason all those Facebook commenters are in support of the teacher is probably mainly generational differences, probably
I actually don't doubt that
"if this happened once it will happen again" fair enough
thennnn that's a bit less forgivable
if it's a repeated pattern of behaviour
on the other hand
imo if it was like, a one-off occurrence (maybe they were having a bad day?) there could be some room for forgiveness, though obviously some kind of remedial action would be ideal
I don't know the full story, so I can't make any judgments
tru tru
<a:HibikiAniDisgust:777603915716755457>
is stuff I'm not even following
like, 50% of the stuff on my feed
I don't really enjoy browsing Facebook at all lol
but anyway, ye, I feel like pretty much everyone's had these kinds of thoughts to _some degree_, at the very least. I guess it's mainly a matter of constructing healthy mechanisms to deal with these kinds of thoughts
~~unless you haven't. which means you can experience imposter's syndrome about experiencing imposter's syndrome! wait <:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>~~
but you are definitely not alone in feeling that way <@!738898415173500969>. I see a lot of ppl talking about this sort of thing in my social media feeds in lots of other contexts too, e.g. regarding streamers/vtubers and follower counts, art and likes/reblogs, competitive tetris players, and so on
hug <:ChrisHibikiHug:630262562361049121>
I hope you can work something out <:ChrisPray:672578403156885504>
recognizing it is the first step, but im not really sure what would be the steps beyond that <:HibikiSad:738234648509022368>
that is definitely a mindset I've seen in at least one other person I know before as well, and it's not an enjoyable place to be in <:MikuCry:688397678584791074>
also tbh I don't know too much about how the everyday happenings of lawmaking works in the house of commons üòÖ so im not too sure about how this will change things down the line
ye pretty much
mm
probably was trying to angle for a majority so that it's easier to push through legislation
ye, definitely
since the last election was only 2 years ago and they could go up to 4 years iirc before being required to call another election
ye I feel like even a lot of the liberal supporters feel like it wasn't a good idea to call the snap election now
looks like it's going to be another liberal minority, i.e. the same as before, status quo
canada federal election result projections
better than just leaving it there
if showering removes the particles from your skin that you might accidentally touch later with your hands and later your face I would consider that doing something at the very least
I mean it certainly can't hurt, right?
or anything really
or maybe it's some random drunk person
maybe it's a really smart raccoon or something
like
so you probably can't know for sure unless you get more information
there are lots of possibilities
do you maybe have any kind of surveillance camera that might catch such an intruder?
concern
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
<:HibikiTired:422925410490253313>
context matters!!!! <:ShirabeEmbarassed:336657288477671436>
and I remembered oh right we were talking about Halloween costume ideas
the message was accompanied with this image
but when I scrolled up in the chat
I was like 'huh?? this sounds serious... I dont remember reading this message??'
and the message was `im having some terrible thoughts rn`
so I got that email notification that sometimes sends you excerpts of messages when you've been away for more than 15 minutes etc.
anyway was reading through a conversation I had with a coworker on mattermost that reminded me how easy it is to misinterpret tone etc. in a textual medium where that kind of tone information isn't necessarily obvious
i remember zmand97 bringing up this topic before and iirc there was like yelling involved or something? with the parent or something
communication is important
without knowing more about the situation it's hard to tell if it's like an internet addiction/apathy/laziness thing or a bullying/depression/mental health kind of thing
hm that's not a lot of information to go on
ye understanding why is important
why that specific part of the venue
I wonder, was there a specific reason
very true

not sure if it's going to have any impact, but I contributed a comment to this thread https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/community/posts/4412581586967-Please-for-the-love-of-god-stay-away-from-the-NFT-trashfire
https://twitter.com/katrinaltrnsl8r/status/1458074955543769090
ye pretty much this... https://twitter.com/EnternodeCS/status/1458612039023312899
artstation was at the very least a bit more upfront about admitting fault though
honestly same kind of energy as artstation's statement when they tried doing something with nfts and then immediately backpedaled because of backlash https://magazine.artstation.com/2021/03/a-statement-from-artstation/
a very diplomatically worded response, he probably doesnt want to burn any bridges
that's better than nothing
at least there's a response
and ping should be fairly unambiguous what it refers to
since it's a clear instruction
imo something like "do not ping me" would be less ambiguous
(i actuall dont know what o.s.f.i.l stands for...)
ye
like ppl put all sorts of different memes in their usernames so maybe it could be referring to something off discord
imo "tag" has a lot of meanings (e.g. tumblr tags? price tags? tetris player addtaghere?) so the meaning of "do not tag" can be a bit unclear
conversely, there's also this :p https://webaim.org/blog/user-agent-string-history/
(overcast is unironically my favourite kind of weather tho <:lidelle:634093359488827403>)
"pretty nice weather today" (overcast)
"huh it started snowing today"
"it's gotten colder lately"
we kinda unironically open it with small talk about the weather sometimes lol
in the weekly team meetings we have at work
honestly
finally
i love the memes coming out of this tho <:lidelle:634093359488827403> https://rabbiteclair.tumblr.com/post/671671138461581312
i think rn it only affects ios users tho?
ye it's kinda dumb lol
https://sreegs.tumblr.com/post/671649355334336512/alright-lets-talk-about-apple-and-tumblrs
outline.com sometimes works https://outline.com/T9EC9N
im also reminded of this (which i think was shared here before) https://gizmodo.com/online-trolls-actually-just-assholes-all-the-time-stud-1847575210
(backreading) tbh i dont really know much about this subject so reading this discussion is fascinating <:HibikiWhoops:585839808115507222>
dam <:HibikiTired:422925410490253313>
so perhaps someone in one space can see a lot of claims and stuff that other people don't
we all tend to hang out in different circles
on the other hand
like actual news article: "debunked: <completely ludicrous claim> is false" and im like 'i have never seen anyone claiming this in my life'
tbh sometimes i see this like. in the news
so one hand, sometimes this kind of misinformation thing is so fringe that perhaps just spreading the debunking thing will do more to spread the original misinformation
context is important, ye
idk
but those things imo are more relevant in places like news media or highly visible media posts. here this is a fairly obscure and restricted discord channel so im _hoping_ the ppl here can deal with topics with more nuance and critical thinking
it is sometimes unclear if stating claims and debunking them would do more harm than good (i.e. possibly giving more publicity to misinformation) and also whether or not the debunking is actually valid or strong enough (so if the debunking argument is weak, it can end up elevating the misinformation)
this topic is completely out of my depth but on a general level idk isn't there some value in listing misinformation claims and arguments debunking them?
im sorry to hear that <a:APetForMaria:753351133438935260>
im reminded of this comment i saw in a discussion about this topic in a go forum
damn
<:ChrisPray:672578403156885504>
really terrible news to hear <:MikuCry:688397678584791074>
privacy is good
that's entirely fair
theres a lot to unpack here
dam
relieved
imo fanservice-wise it's like. 4/10 fanservicey
sometimes these memories recur
personally i just keep a doc of all of the cringe and regret etc. memories i have lol
and i leave it behind
and then it's out
capture all of the feelings and frustration into writing
into a doc
vent
i like
so i try to not spend too much time thinking about it
but it's not possible to change the past[citation needed]
ive definitely experienced similar things before, albeit perhaps not as extreme as your situation
honestly i get that. it's valid to feel upset about that. what ifs. what could have been. the feeling of being left out, not a good feeling.
but occasionally i do screw up here and there <:lidelle:634093359488827403>
no one is perfect! im like, 'im 24 years old, ive learned a lot. im not going to do anything dumb ever again'
anyway that's just how i think about things. might not be the same for everyone, but. anyway
because more recent things generally tend to have more weight and saliency in people's minds
eventually, the mistakes of the past will be buried with time
it's generally most productive to focus our energies looking forward, rather than ruminating too much on the past
and so to prevent the same mistakes from happening again
this current moment right now will become the past at one point
we can't change the past, but we can control what will happen in the future
it's important to remember:
and then forget about it lol
so i find the corresponding entry and add another note to it
i watched this recently! it's a really good video <:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
most of these ppl i havent heard of before
or is it like. the general public agrees that the subject is bad
just deplatformed?
what does cancelled even mean in this context
he was but he got out somehow i think
wait but isnt cosby out of jail now
so i try not to look at it
engineered to make people angry
i feel like a lot of the trending is just like
twitter trending <a:HibikiAniDisgust:777603915716755457>
and above all, keep away from drama <:lidelle:634093359488827403>
follow friends, artists, etc.
imo Twitter is not that bad if you curate your online experience
truuuuu lol <:KirikaGlee:698939825927094384>
i thought it was just location based o.o
trending is affected by who you follow?
this is probably one of the reasons why this year's prank was not received very well tbh
ye that's an understandable gripe
you have to remember poe's law
I will share this here as well https://twitter.com/Foone/status/1484266932731715587
but I can see why some ppl may not appreciate it
I'm personally indifferent about this years prank
intent != effect
<@384495616065273856> <@279341087494242304> I personally didnt mind the depression prompts bc it gave me inspiration to subvert them <:lidelle:634093359488827403> this year's prank, eh. just not very funny imo, but that's my.own opinion
is there a thread limit
honestly sometimes I'm at work at then I take a nap.in the evening so it can be like. up to 12 hours later before I get around to responding to a prompt <:HibikiWhoops:585839808115507222>
aaaaaaaaa
everyone is being aggressive here
thank you for stopping
I do not think aria is being self-centred
subjective
they thought they were just having a bit of harmless fun
the people making the jokes I'm sure did not intend to be trouble for others
considering the divisive topic, it is understandable to be annoyed that it's this kind of topic in particular that are being sent
imo it is understandable to be frustrated for a channel to be cluttered with messages that are off-topic
a lot of our works are wip tho
it is a vital historical record
disageee
but that would lose all the 
messages wouldn't it
idk if there is one
I'm worried if creating threads so regularly might run into some kind of limit at some point
we could just get someone to bump the thread every 24h or something <:lidelle:634093359488827403>
(it was the wordle thread)
in one discord I'm in were basically using a thread as another channel.lol
the main benefit is discussion wont drown out earlier posts
but the discord I'm in is kinda smaller so we all already know each other
oftentimes we either just use the name of the person, or an ugly discord message url
ye the main thing with this one is it's hard to refer back to a specific post
<a:FEAR:911637619383889970>
we kinda have something like this in another discord I'm in, where we post all of our drawings in <#850799186890850334> and then discussion using #msd-chat (msd = make something daily)
ok random other idea: separate out the fancontent posting from fancontent discussion?
I think creating a thread for each prompt is overkill
anyway I'm fine with trying out different stuff, to see what works and what doesmt
this could work too
if theres only 1 thread it's easier to find
and then the ping can be.in fancontent and then we jump into the thread for discussion
what about a dedicated thread for only prompts
so I wouldn't want them published (yet)
(is twitter embed not working rn <:HibikiTired:422925410490253313>)
ive been on tumblr since 2017 and tbh ive never really interacted with the nsfw side of things so it hasn't really changed that much for me. maybe slightly more quiet and less drama
there's like the legal definition of free speech, which relates to the government, and there's like the. "spirit" of free speech, which is probably what they really mean. and it usually means "i can say whatever i want without consequences"
going to sleep. hopefully itll be better in the morning <:HibikiTired:422925410490253313>
i love randomly feeling anxious for no reason üôÉ
dam. <:KirikaCry:674720015047720961>
is the job important? does it involve a lot of in-person contact? are you vaccinated? immunocompromised? etc. lots of factors to be weighed
anyway this is a decision only you can make imo. everyone has different risk tolerances, and it also depends a lot about whether you're at high risk or not
ono i made the mistake of reading the comments in this post
<:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
<:doremyWow:832739498906484747>
unfortch
lol
and now cut to today, where i am terminally online, almost every hour of my waking day <:Wumoon:861061326372601866>
we also started "sneaking" (i.e. going on the computer when it wasn't an officially permitted timeslot <:lidelle:634093359488827403>)
then 2 hours
then 1 hour
then 40 minutes
35 minutes (ehhh it's 5 minutes parents wont notice right)
and then we started gradually stretching the limits
i remember we mainly used that to play like rollercoaster tycoon or something
yeah when we were young (like, early elementary school), my parents limited us to 30 minutes on the computer per day
üìà
eventually we found out that if you booked the computer through the system beforehand, you could get up to 60 minutes in a contiguous slot
me and my siblings used that time to play games on miniclip and stuff <:lidelle:634093359488827403>
and those normally you only get 30 minutes at a time
we'd go to the library for internet
i remember when i was really young. we only had one computer in the home, and it didnt have internet
i would not think they would be good for a young kid's development, if given unfettered access to them
screens are terribly addictive
for my mother, mainly just fever + coughing + aches, and loss of taste. for my brother, mainly just sore throat
everyone already had the vax + 1 booster, so maybe that helped. symptoms weren't too severe
for my mom i think it was like 10 days from first symptoms to not testing positive anymore, and for my brother it was 5 days
my mother and little brother got covid recently too, but fortunately they're recovered now
i hope they feel better soon üôè
hopefully they can get all that mess resolved though
honestly saaaame <:HibikiWhoops:585839808115507222>
what was in this video? <:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>

it sneaks up on you...
I know what you mean
lowkey dismayed how freely some ppl fling around death threats these days <:HibikiTired:422925410490253313>
youtube auto captions are pretty good nowadays
(wait I meant speech to text, not the other way around üòÖ)
in the end all the "AIs" we have nowadays are just function approximaters
it's useful for text to speech and stuff like that
with neural nets the training is usually the most expensive part by far. running it is usually not as bad
to be fair there are different kinds of AI. you can consider neural nets AI, you could also consider a simple decision tree an AI too if you really get down to it
think about the potential for abuse if you hook up one of these AIs to something important
and even tho sqli and xss are easily preventable and well-known, they are still very commonly exploited nowadays by malicious actors
ye the comparisons they used were with cross-site scripting and SQL injection, which are really common in the wild. but they are 100% preventable with correct escaping/encoding/etc.
ye <:HibikiTired:422925410490253313>
etc.
the "look at what trans people are trying to do to free speech" messaging
lowkey im scared of the possible backlash tho
and kiwifarms is much easier to dunk on than someone like this, whose views are more widely supported by a certain segment of the US population
the number of ppl who watch fox news is scary high, might not be as easy as kiwifarms <:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
(tbh i did try out the symphogear and cookie run mobile games at some point, but i never really got into it, and never spent any money on it either, so i guess im not the target audience <:lidelle:634093359488827403>)
good.

unfortch <:jovillPensive:962581411397795840>
this whole thing will be a fabulous case study on what _not_ to do

did they put the "official" back in twitter profiles again 1 day after removing them
<:HibikiOhNo:586337444597596202>
well that sounds fun <:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
hehe https://twitter.com/internetofshit/status/1593456879442997254
also bird hellsite most likely won't go down right away, but if there are any outages or other maintenance issues, unexpected mishaps etc., it'd probably them longer to put out the fires, esp. when so much institutional knowledge is leaving the company
this is a satire account btw
maybe he'll wait a few days so that he doesn't seem _too_ eager <:doremyThink:832740976233414697>
back again <:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
well then <:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
at least _is_ a line he's not gonna cross. low bar <https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/02/business/media/kanye-west-twitter-suspension.html>
i will give him some credit for this https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1598546057138524160
rip
(pls no >_<;;)
for every blue checkmark you buy you get 1 extra character <:thonk:648907080949956608>
bc if it's longer probably higher chance you'll have a typo in there somewhere
if they do increase the character limit they'd better also give ppl the ability to edit tweets tho <:doremyThink:832740976233414697>
anyway either way i feel like my experience of social media sites like twitter and tumblr probably arent indicative of the average person's experience, so obviously ymmv
i mean tumblr still has short posts too so. eh
brevity is the soul of wit but at the same time you lose a lot of nuance if you try to quash everything into a quippy one-liner idk
tumblr supposedly has a character limit but ive never run into it before so <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
tbh i dont really have a problem with twitter increasing the character limit
it's really evident in the way that musk has been running the site these past few weeks. A lot of these policy changes etc. are all in response to things that have affected him personally
ye that is also a fair point
rules for thee but not for me indeed. I will argue that just because information is publicly available, doesnt necessarily mean its desirable to allow its propagation to a wider audience on twitter
<:doremyThink:832740976233414697>
https://twitter.com/cfiesler/status/1589401026276515840?t=t5V7VKVWtrgl0cRheLqtsQ&s=19
reminds me of a tweet
ye context is important
idk if I'm just being overly sensitive about this, but am I the only one who finds jokes about bodily harm/death unfunny, even if it's about ppl I really dislike?
<:pensive:963733285740089385>
accessibility is important...
god im half convinced at this point that someday hes gonna go "why do we even have this alt text feature anyway? no one even knows why we added it"
if it doesn't affect him, he's probably blind to it
LOL
(note: my current level of respect for him is uh... not that high lol)
if he actually does abide the results of the poll, i'll have slightly more respect for him
<:MikuCry:688397678584791074>
understandable <:KirikaConcern:698939825386029186>
(i have not read the books or watched the movies yet)
so my perception of harry potter canon is probably somewhat skewed <:KirikaConcern:698939825386029186>
at this point, everything i know about harry potter has been through osmosis from various fanfics

huh well that's actually pretty accurate <:HibikiWhoops:585839808115507222>
`You're always a sucker for dramatic irony`
ahhhh okay <:HibikiPadoru:516438720082346004>
<https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/padoru>
> Padoru is a series of image macros and remix video featuring a Christmas carol scene in the Japanese PlayStation Portable role-playing game Fate/Extra.
> 
> In the game Fate/Extra, the character Nero Claudius sings a Japanese parody of the Christmas carol "Jingle Bells" during a short sequence in the game, ending with Claudius loudly yelling the lyrics "padoru padoru!" On December 11th, 2011, YouTuber ugroundz uploaded a clip of the sequence, garnering more than 473,000 views and 300 comments over the next six years (shown below).
okay, time for me to stop being lazy and actually look up what this meme means <:HibikiWhoops:585839808115507222>
Hibiki's just the unimportant side character they saved in episode 1, I wish she had more screen time
just like how Tsubasa and Kanade are definitely the main characters of Symphogear <:KirikaApproval:586957465552158720>
hehe <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>

speaking of yukata
i.e. if you don't live in the US or Canada, welp too bad
if you live in any of the non-red countries shown here, Funimation has subbed episodes of Index and Railgun on YouTube https://polsy.org.uk/stuff/ytrestrict.cgi?ytid=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DqozcTpr3OKQ


imo one of the Railgun mangaka's most crowning achievements is taking the super terrible jerkass antagonist Scavenger girls from the Accelerator manga and managing to make them into likable characters
I really like how the Railgun mangaka manages to portray the storylines
regarding the manga, these are my opinions:
- I haven't read the Index manga
- Railgun manga is really, REALLY good, 11/10
- Accelerator manga kind of drags and doesn't really interest me, 5/10
- Astral Buddy is interesting, 8/10
okay I watched all of these back in 2013, so who knows if my tastes have changed since then, but these are my scores on MAL at the moment:
- Index: 8/10
- Railgun: 10/10
- Index II: 8/10
- Railgun S: 9/10 (I still have 3 episodes from the final filler arc that I haven't seen yet)
I think he just totally Stockholm syndromed them all, and now he has take responsibility for that :/
it reminds me a bit of üçÖ
also, I think Last Order's "you were saying all those mean things to us because you were trying to elicit a human reaction" or some other argument to Accelerator doesn't really hold much water
usually I enjoy the episodes without Touma focus better, because all the annoying harem things are not as prominent <:ShirabeConcern:586404485598019604>
the most interesting part of the first season of Index imo was the little arc around episode 19 with the Accelerator & Last Order interactions
that... just doesn't really seem realistic :/
and then you're going to fight the strongest Level 5 in the city
like, you just got severely electrocuted multiple times over and you collapsed (iirc)
the Misaka vs. Touma confrontation on the bridge just felt really off to me, though
Sisters Arc was more interesting because Accelerator
the next arc was kind of meh
I thought it was fairly fast-paced, introduced an interesting world, and held a lot of promise
I actually really liked the first arc of the Index anime
but other than that, it was okay
the magic parts kind of weren't really interesting, and all the harem aspects were super annoying
(I did first watch it when I was back in high school, though)
I didn't think Index was terrible, though
I guess like most people here, I enjoyed Railgun better than Index too
sooo, Railgun and Index
amazing
what a historical moment
Yumi has successfully traversed the fourth wall

Kiyama-sensei ;_;
I think the Level Upper arc will always be one of my absolute favourites, though
and this
ah I happen to have this in my Toaru fanfic drafting folder
oh yeahhhhhhhhhhh this one
but I don't remember the title so lemme see if I got it right...
A song immediately started playing in my head when I saw that thumbnail
fair enough, I suppose <:HibikiTired:422925410490253313>
if the story is otherwise good, I can get past it
eh, it's a bit hard to swallow at first, but I just see it as a dialect variant and it doesn't bother me too much <:HibikiWhoops:585839808115507222>
and before that was this one https://archiveofourown.org/works/10441029
hmm, this one, though apparently I stopped reading it after 1 chapter https://archiveofourown.org/works/6614482/chapters/15134395
so my memory of the general Toaru fanfic space is a bit fuzzy
...checking my fanfic spreadsheet, the last time I read a Toaru fanfic was in 2017
sounds intriguing
yeah, I kinda vaguely recall that
(gosh, it's been so long since I last read/watched this part of Railgun/Index, so I don't really remember any of the plot points really well)
I really enjoy it when the changes are super drastic and different from canon, because that puts an interesting perspective on things
In AU canon divergence fanfics, one of my pet peeves is railroading (a.k.a. "in spite of a nail")
There are so many plot elements, it's complicated thinking about how the sequence of events might change <:HibikiOhNo:586337444597596202>

here's a cute Nichijou AMV from tumblr https://numahachi.tumblr.com/post/166502231685
I love Symphogear and all, but Nichijou will always hold a special place in my heart
1. Nichijou
2. Symphogear
3. Tanakeda
4. Barakamon
5. Madoka
I'm guessing it's just random letters <:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
`space ma ya su yo`

is Uiharu actually typing something?
that's some really nice quality in the opening there
<:Kiricoin:495336831978569759>
something about the instruments
that opening sounds very Railgun
something something Uiharu and Saten-san operating mech suits?
I think there are still several episodes of S that I still need to get around to watching
oh, I've gotten really lazy with keeping up to date with new anime; I need to get caught up...
<:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
it's from like chapter 80 something I think of the manga I linked above, Love So Life

I feel like that kind of exchange has happened to every parent (with more than one child) at some point
"yeah okay but who do you *really* like the best"
"oh honey, I love you all equally"
"Mommy, who's your favourite child?"
this is an accurate description of my experience
e.g. mp100 season 2's opening: https://demifiendrsa.tumblr.com/post/181808333282/mob-psycho-100-ii-op
that's why some openings take a while to grow on me, but once they do, I *really* like them
when it comes to deciding which anime openings I like the best, I think it's like 50% how much I like how it sounds, 25% the OP visuals, and 25% attached nostalgia/whatever emotions are evoked from the associated episodes
huh
or something like that, it's been years since I last read that chapter <:HibikiTired:422925410490253313>
"idk what that was so I punched it to deflect it"
actually, Number 7 has a lot in common with Hibiki, doesn't he?
I'm hyped to see Mr. Shounen-protagonist-in-the-wrong-anime get some screen time
oh wow, that's a first, for Railgun
future T spoilers I guess, kinda

so I'm not caught up on Railgun at all, so I tried putting in some Railgun characters into that OTP generator from <#357682999300718592>
so e.g. chapter 99 is actually more like 13 chapters
but actually the later chapters start having multiple parts because ONE wanted to finish on 101 chapters
and the manga has 101 chapters
according to my sister, season 2 covers up to about chapter 91
(omg mp100 season 3, I hope they announce it soon)
I haven't seen the movie, so this is the main thing I know about it
"meme villain" it's been so long since I've watched that arc, so I don't remember, but I have the feeling she made some Ver faces at some point
the anime original for S was a bit more... meh for me
I kinda like the anime original for the first season, especially since it tied up loose ends with Erii and Banri
<:MariaShock:423196877354303498> üçÖ

what if their computers crash or if there's a power outage or something?
that sounds very stressful

that's the only anime list tracking thing I'm using atm <:HibikiWhoops:585839808115507222>

r/mildlyinteresting
huh, for two completely unrelated anime, the OP and ED sync up surprisingly nicely if you swap their audio tracks
I've been watching Hamefura lately, and the ending for that anime is also really good
I really like this opening, definitely gonna be an earworm for me
<:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
it's like everyone's 5 steps ahead of each other and everyone's watching everyone <:MariaWink:688836868736811148>
I actually really love the mind games aspect of this anime though
~~The Promised Neverland is a wholesome slice of life anime about a bunch of kids who run around and play tag and solve jigsaw puzzles together~~ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JoFsTDfd-8
it's also set in 2045 <:ShiraBean:661294258795446326>
currently at episode 4, it's pretty cool
she told us to avoid spoilers
my sister's making me and my younger brother watch it

Hachimitsu Scans
Seven Seas
ah, I happen to have a photo of a page from one of Seven Seas' books on hand, so you can judge for yourself
in contrast, I remember reading the first 5 volumes of Zetsubou-sensei (translated by Del Rey Manga) and I remember consciously thinking "wow this dialogue feels very stiff" compared to the scanlations
I think they're fine though
tbh I don't usually notice awkwardness in official translations *or* scanlations so <:HibikiWhoops:585839808115507222>
but they do stuff like preserving the honorifics etc.
I'd imagine it might vary depending on who translated it
I'm definitely not a language expert, but of the Seven Seas books that I own, I haven't noticed anything odd about the translations
<:ShirabeSob:701475635025019000>
||that episode was lit! :3||

||I loved that reveal||
what's this o.o
need to get caught up at some point
I've read the manga up to the end of the Dream Ranker arc I think, but I still need to finish watching S (left off somewhere in the Silent Party arc)
I first started reading Shingeki no Kyojin sometime after I first watched Index/Railgun, so from my point of view, Mikasa sounds more unusual than Misaka üôÉ
Sisters Arc o.o
ahh, recap episodes <:MariaChuckle:672465496515411984>
oh, I've read that one!
||something something snipers something something Fre/nda something something France something something flour||
but that was so long ago that I'm not sure if these memories I have are from actually reading the LNs or from reading spoilers on the wiki
tbh I think I might have actually read some bits from the Battle Royale arc of the LNs.
I haven't watched Index III yet, but I've read discussions about it
ooh
I've watched the anime, but I haven't really read the LNs
mm
also mostly past midnight
hm, I was curious, so I checked the Nichijou air times <https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%97%A5%E5%B8%B8_(%E6%BC%AB%E7%94%BB)#%E6%94%BE%E9%80%81%E5%B1%80>

they really rushed through the rest of TPN huh
speaking of cgi in anime, this one scene was pretty cool (imo) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLZN3FpYLSE

im just reminded of that one chapter from Prunus Girl where the shady secret underground Aikawa fanclub fixates and obsesses _way_ too much about Aikawa's gender
hehe https://www.twitch.tv/nichijoufanzinerpg/clip/SmokyBrainySoymilkSpicyBoy-_wXwSfUDqNiO1sr2
it was fun
so today in Nichijou fandom we had an AMA with the English dub voice actresses for Hakase and that one waitress from episode 9 (aka irene nichijou)!
the other day i found out that kyouko (danganronpa) is voiced by the same seiyuu as maria (symphogear) and I was like "ohhhhhhhh thats why she sounds so familiarrrrr"
im at the point where ive watched enough anime that a lot of voices start sounding vaguely familiar but for most ppl i dont know who unless I look it up
the ED is very aesthetic
i still need to finsih watching it
yeeeeeeees

heres my scoring histogram (imported from mal to anilist, so divide the scores by 10)
which is quite rare tbh
anything less than a 5 i give to shows that actively make me angry/annoyed/upset/ruins my day if i watch
ye it's the same for me, more or less
this is the manga, would recommend https://myanimelist.net/manga/105179/Kamisama_no_Ekohiiki
