Human Micha looks precious.
Weird crossovers
I need more flooffy Chris
I don't know why there's so much Symphogear-Bleach art, but I ain't complaining
As expected~
Chris is the only one to properly establish dominance
I'm assuming you're talking about specific groups, &&?
Very broad spectrum of beliefs
The subcontinent has an interesting history
I've never been a fan of politics myself. Tends to be why I never speak on this channel... Till this exception
But you know the politics in India far better than I ever will
That it is
No need for food centric holidays when you can have feasts on all of them
There is always food
Yeah
The big holiday/festival around the time of year my family usually goes back to India if Onam. But that's specific to my state
Or if I have, I was too young to remember
I've never been in India during that time of year actually
Which is why I brought up the history of the subcontinent in general
Yep.
But I'm a bit more removed from it all
I don't think specific groups really have any denotation
You have to look at it based on Indian history
Nah.
Considering my family isn't like that
A point about the flu vaccine. While the desired result is that you won't get the flu of the year thanks to it, that is not necessarily the case. But, the administration can still prevent worse symptoms. What would have been a hospitalization without could end up as merely bed rest. What would have been an ICU visit without could be a less severe hospitalization with it.
Indicated treatment is supportive care and limited contact and that's not exactly an indication for hospitalization
It's also in part due to the fact that the people getting tested here are high risk individuals, eg health care workers, cardiac problems, etc
That's both crazy and amazing

And at this point, I'm now almost convinced that residents should strike
And now the American Association of Medical Colleges has caught wind of residents talking about striking and is trying to guilt trip them
and gag orders have been placed at hospitals where the residents died
to the point where a COO of New York Presbyterian-Brooklyn Methodist sent an internal message that was essentially a thinly veiled threat
Between two residents dying in the past week and the general sentiment over the lack of protective equipment, administrations are starting to buckle
The idea of residents striking during the pandemic is starting to float around and gain traction
Things are getting crazier behind the scenes in New York City hospitals.
Heh. https://twitter.com/McclaranAlyson/status/1252043676445839361
And masks don't CO2 trap anywhere near significantly enough to be different from an asthmatic without a mask.
Asthma is not a contraindication to wearing a mask. There's like only one or two contraindications to it.
Also, NY has never not voted Blue in my lifetime
The Third Party voters are the easy scapegoat
<:TonyEyeRoll:580561912513691679>
Granted, I was too late to register to even vote so eh
The Democrats hated third party voters in 2016 onwards. The Repubs are taking over the third party hate train till the next election
Isn't being a third party voter great? /s
And now republicans are frothing at the mouth over third party voters
