I can feel the bile rising from my stomach.
Alright, thank you for the recommendations
I've seen AoT, but not the others
And Jojo
I've enjoyed Fate, and (recently) Re:Zero 

And of course Symphogear
Anyone got anime recommendations?
Was season 1 of that any good?
So, I started Evangelion, just finished episode 10, I'm really liking it
Finished episode 18
Fuck that was rough
Hmm, interesting
I plan on watching it tomorrow
Finished Evangelion 
Man those last few episodes were something
But Ilulu seems to have more character than that so, here's to hoping
Pretty much yeah, just "the character that has big booba"
Yeah, I can see and understand why it'd bother people 
Me, not so much
Her wiki said 19 in appearance, but apparently it got changed to 16 in appearance 

Either that or I'm remembering wrong
Won't let Twitter ruin this
Anyway, can't wait for season 2
Looking off her wiki page, she honestly seems like a pretty neat character
Probably because she's *gasp* short
Not like shortstacks exist or anything
That's her name
Ilulu
Meh, let 'em complain
Can't wait for it to come out
That gore, yikes
Actually, there is one thing
I uh
Don't know what to talk about with that movie
Wow.
That movie was
Starting End of Evangelion
Yeah that movie gives me... a different feeling compared to the show
||the spear going through her eye, then her arm... fuck that actually got to me||
||that scene with Asuka, fuckin' hell||
Favorite thing about it is the character interactions in question
Finished chapter 52 a bit ago, Ilulu is so damn adorable
Ye
Loving Miss Kobayashi's Dragon Maid's manga
same
Just watched Evangelion: 222 You Can (Not) Advance

*Soooo good*
Finished Tokyo Ghoul a while ago, pretty good anime but I didn't like season 3 much
It's fine ig
Well, finished Gurren Lagann
It just gets kinda
Dumb and hard to follow in the second half
I didn't care for the second half of the show, but I can see why people like it
Wait what
Okay I'll do it later
I looked but the only legal ways require a subscription, I don’t have money on me rn
Alright, I'll check it out later
where can I watch it?
Hmm
I know nothing of this anime
Wilhelm is great
...Now I gotta wait for season 3, damn....
It's really good
I can understand that
It's really good, I finished Season 2 a few weeks back
Re Zero knows how to hit those feels on ya
