rip hibiki

one idea i'd be much more interested in ~~because of depression üòà~~ is that ||hibiki didn't get herself and miku blasted by shenshoujing in g and ended up dying, and miku suffered memory loss after ver's experiments/watching hibiki die, so she ends up being like a big sister to kirika and shirabe while maria goes off to play the villain||
she was at the concert and became the symphogear user instead of hibiki is the obvious one
yeah exactly üò≠
granted it does make sense why _this_ au miku isn't much of one since she wasn't around hibiki for years but,
i wish au miku was an actual character
