Greetings my child

I’ve actually been here before
Wrong channel?
Also if the used ß people would assume it’s pronounced like Weiß 
And like with an english W
Also ß would confuse too many people tbh
Then it would be pronounced differently
No
Actually
2B weiss

**HISTOIRE!**
Hmmmm
Neptunia
~~joke pls no ban for spam~~
Drop all 209 here
So if i just
i see
Do you just post art here to find the source
So just to be clear

And her entire character has been about realizing just what she agreed to
She jumped at cinders offer because it was her first time actually having someone
But she isn’t evil
She just got stuck with the evil people
She is an antagonist
She may be an antagonist but that doesn’t make her a villain
Antagonist and villain are 2 separate concepts
Villain isn’t antagonist
Ok mister black and white
She only sticks around because of cinder
You can tell she doesn’t like to do what she does
Emerald isn’t really a villain
As well as one for
I keep folders of art for all the main 4 characters
I get so much art from him
Honestly



Hold on
*oh shit forgot we was here*
Dang
Delete this
Best command
Calm down
pew pew
**MORE LIKE ROBOTS AND LASERS**
**KNIGHTS AND MAGIC**

Heretics will be burned
denied
They produce shows its what they do
Rooster teeth is a company
Just more so recently
Rwby was technically always a professional production
Or at least thats my take
Her name is explicitly mispronounced as to differentiate it from the actual german words
Does it really matter though

Yang and blake is just kinda like *they’re hot together*
Ruby and weiss play off each other effectively
Because white rose has more synergy
A man of culture i see
**HMMMMMM**

Yeah
A
Chank
Ta
What is this the ded squad
~~Someones a bit narcissistic~~
Yes
Hmmm
Hmmmmm

Christmas weiss is amazing
I like how the show is addressing qrows alcohol problem
The silver eyes bit was a tad...meh
It was a good episode for the most part
Alone in the woods?
*this is fine*
Idk

Thats what we call heaven
The fucking thigh


I always forget the japanese dub exists
Rwby and symphogear in the same piece of art
Holy shit

Moderation is key
If you always post it people will start to get sick of it
This is here every time i check this channel


What direction do i read this in
That pyrhha was drawn by a porn artist I believe
The inkling is 14
**KIRBY**
Isn’t that the dreamcast girl
Y'all talkin' bout roowubby

No one even knew it existed until this
People shouldn’t care if the underwear looks a bit odd
Its a battle royale game
*Valid criticism?*
Shit like this

The problem is that big companies listen to the loud minority
Terms will always get skewed
Sjw’s are people who try to use stuff like gender identity to their own gain and to harass people
The reason people thinks its loud is because its infecting stuff like gaming
But loud is annoying
Its the loud minority
My main problem is sjws using gender identity as a weapon to get people they don’t like arrested
Im fine with people being whatever gender they want
As long as they don’t make it other peoples problems and get people arrested for not using *”the right pronoun”*
He’s essentially stating that gender is something you are biologically stuck with just like age
But i can see ~~kinda~~ where he’s coming from
Its a very bad comparison
Rather than actually change his age
Im assuming he was doing this to make a point
They should be fixing the game instead of worrying about fixing camel toes
*its not intentional*
The camel toe was intentional
Yes of course
This *”camel toe”* had to be actively searched for to even find
Imagine not knowing everything about everyone and making an honest mistake
You cant use that infrastructure without contributing to it
It pays for infrastructure
But not tho
If it’s unreasonable sure
Meh
Something about liberalism personalizing everything and france aint liking it
Not so much a European thing
Revolting over taxes is an American thing
And people are pissed
They elected him as a centralist but he is acting like a right winger
The president made a booboo
Its about politics not taxes
Not really
I already have too much stuff taking up my time and I’d rather hang with friends then get laid
A relationship just seems like too much of a hassle
Honestly
Don’t have a family
Solution
It just gets quieter sometimes
The shit storm never really ended
Is this real
I don’t know what to tell yah man
^^
*i don’t use the infrastructure*
Do you even realize how filled with holes that argument is

I have a way with words <:MariaSunglasses:336656798687690752>
“Bitch fuck me”
What
But why though
Wtf is a

Your pride aint worth shit in the working world
Tell him to suck it up and work
~~IM GONNA SAY THE N WORD~~
of course the animation is gonna be sub par
also its Toei
what was the original
so its a remake
so whats wrong with it
*Toei animation*
is the trailer supposed to be in spanish
Words cannot express how much i love this
*”Mega Ma’am”*
Youjo senki is great
I hear erased is a *very comfy* anime
What about Puella Magi Madoka Magica

Cute magical girls
*Very comfy*
**Very Comfy**
Dead little girls and lolis
Very comfy
The anime where a school gets bombed
Black bullet
