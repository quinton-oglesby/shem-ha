If possible, could the server get a merch channel for anything non-Symphogear related? If it already does have one, I apologize for not seeing it.

Since it's Aoi Yuuki's birthday, this makes it the perfect time for me to mention that you should watch Healing Good PreCure. Why? Because Aoi Yuuki plays Hanadera Nodoka/Cure Grace (the Pink lady in the middle in case you were wondering which one she was).
If Payne for example went to that monster. It would have been defeated.
It was probably meant to be unbeatable to a player of a certain level and/or who had certain stats.
Seems pretty simple to me
Powerful boss must mean there's something good going on
If there's no drops, nobody's gonna attempt it.
Because the game devs thought no one would get them

The 4kids dub of Doremi. My first true one would probably be either Madoka or Kill Ka Kill. Both were when I was discovering anime in high school. I don't remember which one I watched first though.


I've also seen Fate/Kaelid Liner and PreCure in terms of Mahou Shoujo. That's pretty much it. I watched Mahou Shoujo Ore but that's more of a weird parody imo.

Don't know what anime it was when I started being an anime fan tbh. I know when. Best answer I can give is probably Naruto (Shippuden).

(It's the Bunny Girl Senpai movie)

Okay. But then explain how Bofuri got a 2nd season announced right at the end of S1? Bofuri is also based on a LN.
Might be that it was partially done at home?
I'll definitely consider it
I mostly just like Sinon. She stood out more than anyone else before Yuuki and Alice.
I found GGO to kinda still be a step up from ~~ALO~~ the original SAO arc. But fair enough.

> it's basically divided into:
> if you like reading, VN

I didn't like reading but I actually watched 2006 F/SN first, then Zero, then UBW I'm pretty sure. I enjoyed all 3 of them too.
> Tell me a character you like from an anime you hate

Part 2 (as I actually have a PreCure season I ranked lower than Love Tyrant). I don't hate Happiness Charge PreCure. But I don't really like it a ton. My favorite character is Iona/Cure Fortune. She's the only one that made me interested enough to get through the season.
> Tell me a character you like from an anime you hate

Let's see here. I liked the female MC from Love Tyrant. Forgot her name.
Also yeah surprisingly SAO is pretty good generally when it only focuses on 1 protag. Kirito (or Sinon you could argue) in GGO, Asuna in Mother's Rosario, Eugeo in Alicization, Alice in Underworld.
Asuna does generally get blocked by the plot. But it allows other characters to shine in her place so I think it's still good.
I wouldn't say any of the main Cures were written badly (aside from the lead up to Sunshine's debut) but imo. It sometimes feels Erika is just pulling Tsubomi around too much and then Tsubomi/Erika on Yuri. Plus the weekly conflicts feels forced sometimes, someone's heart flower always has to wither for there to be a MOTW.
The animation is very good I 100% agree there. That's 1 thing Heartcatch does have over other seasons.
Which is exactly the problem I had with it
But, if you don't like the characters in Smile. It's pretty hard to like.
> another common starter one i see recommended is smile which i can see but i personally wouldnt recommend to first timers unless they like more episodic shows


Yes. I get why Smile is episodic and people say the characters are what makes Smile so good and recommendable.
I watched everything in release order pretty much. Unlike others who pick and choose. So that definitely has an effect on my opinion. But if a season is really that good, what I watched before and afterwards shouldn't matter much imo.
Heartcatch is good but isn't the pinnacle of PreCure (no season is really but you get my point) imo
I know what the fandom usually suggests. But I try not to recommend those because they're the seasons I turned out to like the least.
Because usually they'll ask and I'll list personal favorites/non favorites. But sometimes people say they don't know what they want necessarily. So it's not easy to really give a good recommendation.
Wherever it lands, that's what they can start with. 


Oh for sure. But I mean besides that.
I mean I've always told people if they can't decide to just spin a wheel.
True
Ah. I mean. Fair I suppose. I always just tell people to avoid Hugtto (as it spoils the previous seasons), and the sequel seasons as their first. But other than that, there's no right or wrong watch order really.
> funnily enough, I found Hugtto to be the most gripping when it came to themes

Hugtto definitely tries this but is ultimately held back from being able to fully explore these themes because it's a PreCure season imo.
Yeah
She jobs but still is done very well. You don't see her kinda character in the rest of PreCure
The final villian in Yes5 is ||Desperiah|| though. She used ||the Dream Collect to give herself eternal beauty (IIRC) and she fought the Cures. Then realized the errors of her way and sacrificed herself to allow the Cures to safely escape from her collapsing dimension||
From the start to the end.
Yeah.  Kawarino does stand out.
Ah
Director is GoGo. He was definitely present in the plot but not as interesting as Joker.
Yeah. Joker ||sacrificed himself for Pierrot's sake. Which sucks because|| he never directly fought against all 5 Cures at once.
Bunbee is a really good character. Villian or otherwise.
Didn't like how they were ||just kinda forgiven at the end because they were originally good fairies who were tricked by Joker||.
Smile is only good with Joker. Other villians of the season didn't feel intimidating enough imo.
Again it's a matter of personal opinion. I just think there are better written and more enjoyable characters than what Heartcatch provides. I don't hate it. But it's just not quite what I want.
True.
Oh yeah no doubt
> the main villain is okay but the focus of the show is obviously loup-garou

Loup was good. Just not Baron. He could have been written better from what I recall. Problem is that Baron's supposed to the big bad. So the big bad lacking isn't a good thing for the movie.
Granted these movies aren't made when the middle of a season is airing. So it's likely they didn't have too much to go on.
It's not but the personality just seemed off? Yeah that's it. She seemed more mature then her TV self and it's just odd to see. If she was more like her movie self during the show I would have liked her character more. But that's besides the point.
Erika's personality seemed different. But then again. I finished Heartcatch in May of last year and I watched the Heartcatch movie in January of this year. So my memory of the characters is not the strongest.
The Heartcatch Movie is good but the movie villian was lacking kinda and the movie portrays the characters kinda differently from the show.
That's kinda my point. There's ways to create conflict or doubt within characters without making it feel like it was written in just because it needed to happen, if you get what I'm saying.
The solution isn't always as simple as talking things out though always.
Yes but there's ways to go about it to make feel more natural imo. The married (?) couple I recall could have just talked things out and there would have been no need for a MOTW. But because there had to be a MOTW fight, they didn't talk things out until after the fight was over. That's what I didn't like seeing in Heartcatch specifically.
> I find my tastes differ too much from what's popular to really rely on "what others are talking about"

My tastes are all over the place tbh. I don't feel like putting in the time to watch most seasonal animes though. So I usually (if I'm not binge watching something already) just pick 1 or 2 seasonal animes that seem interesting and I've heard being talked about to watch.
> Where do y'all generally look to find new anime to watch? Are there any resources you'd recommend for finding new titles to check out?

I usually just see what people are talking about and decide from there what I wanna watch.
> I don't think XV is that much better than the first 4 seasons tbh

I agree. It's a step up but the other 4 seasons aren't that far behind it.

> and both s1 op and s2 op are database

They are but I could have sworn they were slightly different.
Didn't really like Tsubasa's grandfather as a villian either tbh
Shem was sleeping for like 90% of the season technically. So that's why she didn't do anything. I agree she should have done more though
Fine was ok. I really preferred Carol out of all the main ones though. The rest are kinda eh by the end
I don't mind the other thing she had but I thought S1 was good enough.
Although I recall Chris needing more development as unnecessary. Like I had thought what happened in S1 was enough for her.
They get in the way but it's not really because of their personal goals. So they're kinda lacking in purpose. That's why I feel like they're better in GX.||They're free from just being under Mother's shadow and allowed to be more of their own thing.||
> Not solid as allies

I mean they're not really ||solid as villians? They're just obeying what Mother says and even she kinda regrets what she's doing during the season.||
Although, I must admit that all of Symphogear kinda blurs together for me. Since I just binged it all 5 days and haven't looked back since.
I like Maria, Shirabe, and Kirika as characters. But they're not really solid until GX imo.
On the one hand, I like that each Symphogear season affects the next in some way. On the other hand, it gets kinda annoying how much of 1 "supposed" organization can remain imo. How many remains/offshoots can there be?
I think XV is my favorite mainly because I like the dynamic of Noble Red and that it's the final season.  But I'd argue GX is probably a close 2nd. AXZ would be 3rd. Og and G are kinda a mess tbh
Should probably spoiler mark my words then.
It also feels like everyone in Symphogear had parent issues.
> ~~fate the vn‚Äôs eroge parts were the weakest part~~

I never said it was a good eroge
> Is Illya prisma worth watching if you're looking for a magical girl series?

Ehhh. I mean if you're already into Fate. You probably know about how FSN is based on an eroge VN. So go give Illya a chance. 

Otherwise, it's probably better to just read the manga.

Although, 3rei is very good and hardly has any "sharing mana" scenes in favor of focusing more on the plot.
Oh yeah. I should probably check out the Neptunia OVA.
Vanguard If's 1st episode aired today. It was pretty entertaining.

> welp decided to pick up on watching some PreCure. decided for one i never finished because of lack of subs and/or interest so went with Fresh!PreCure. last time was years ago and it only had 4 subbed eps but i just couldn't seem to get into it anyways for some reason and no one wanted to continue subbing it at the time so <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095> . noticed its fully subbed now and decided to restart it cause why not and actually enjoying it this time. guess having a FRESH start helps <:HibikiFingerguns:688429715836502063> . already at eps.6 and wooo that episode is kinda morbid when you think about it. the monster being ||a chalkboard that erases ANYTHING in real life that gets drawn and then erased on its board... so of course it erases all mothers including Love's mom and she sees it happen <:HibikiDespair:688429715450757206> ||

Yeah. Fresh definitely has it's dark moments.
> I find the lack of SNK talk in this channel quite disturbing

Not a big fan of titans running naked unfortunately üòî
||Eas dies and you feel sad/upset/etc.|| and then all that is then almost immediately thrown out the window because ||she's going to be instantly reborn as Cure Passion||.
Like it ruined the reason why someone would be invested in ||Eas's character during the fight between her|| and Peach.
The actual reveal.
Oh wait. Not the fake reveal. That's fine.
I feel the title of the episode was pretty misleading and ruined the (re)introduction tbh
After those 4 assignments then
No time like the present
Oh. You're coming up on a certain episode.
Np.
Let's see here.  There are currently 17 seasons. 

If you want, you can start with Healing Good. It only has 12 episodes right now due to COVID though.

Otherwise. Most people recommend Heartcatch, Smile, and GoPri.

My personal recommendations would be Futari Wa, Yes5, and Suite.

You can essentially pick any season to start with besides the following.
- Futari Wa Precure Max Heart as it's the sequel season to Futari Wa.
- Yes PreCure 5 GoGo as it's the sequel season to Yes5
- Hugtto PreCure as it's a big anniversary season and has certain plot related episodes that would spoil you on characters from seasons prior to it.
Yes. I'm the one you wanted to ping

~~Looks at Smile and Kira Kira~~
> im not gonna judge its dancing CG since i think thats the first time they did an ED like that so not surprising its so rough. and i guess i was more complaining that the title screen for the new OP is just the main three posing and a giant floating head of the 4th Cure and then at the end during their "big fight" against the monster the 4th Cure just pops up in the back doing nothing. what? at least they had the decency to reanimate the end sequence when Chiffon jumps into their arms at the end. <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>

Yeah. I guess I'll say don't expect too much of a change in OP visuals for every season.
It doesn't really get solid until Suite though
> continuing FreshPreCure watching. noticed they finally changed the opening. its lazy as hell. those edits yoh. at least have the decency to make something good <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158> ED is nice though. like the 1st EDsong better though

Fresh, Suite, and Mahotsukai are the only 3 so far to actually have different openings. GoPri just has 2nd verse.

The first Fresh ED song wise is okay. The CG looks like PSP quality though.  The 2nd ED I like more and the CG definitely looks better.
||"My name is Infinity. The limitless memory."|| A very iconic line
Ah yes.
Yes. Shouta Aoi is good
> WTF
> somehow my father is already at season 2 episode 9 of Date a Live

Your father has good taste and a lighting speed watching ability
Oh yes. My god. That was a stupid rule
Glad you enjoyed Fresh. It's not my favorite season. But that's okay.
Donuts are great indeed.
> Finished Fresh!PreCure. Ah yes welcoming our ||evil computer overlords|| and of course Cure Peach ||gets the more distinct outfit change in their final form <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>||. Also of course ||the mystical magical voice that saves all is "Cure Cure Puripu!"|| Truly magical words. Also ||Hohoemina! Nico Nico <:KirikaCheer:689614085402525830>!||. Ah yes ||Love not giving an answer to the poor boy at the end. Sasuga Toei <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>||. Also the biggest MOST IMPORTANT lesson of this show is that the TRUE salvation ||of the multiverse|| IS ||Donuts <:YumiPoint:688429724103344164>||. Oh and the final episode i saw included a "Get your happiness" counter. A total of 32 times apparently though i feel like it was more than that <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>. On that note Fresh!PreCure was pretty good. Cure Berry and ||Cure Passion|| being my favorite transformations and I'm so proud of Chiffon. ||That's my lil baby fairy kicking ass and taking names <:TsubasaJoy:688191716620238870>||. Ended up liking it more than I thought. Of course starting FRESH and in the mood to watch anime helps <:KirikaCheer:689614085402525830>

Oh yes. Toei excels at not delivering on the het romances in PreCure pretty much. Thankfully not every season has a het romance
Bishamon ‚ù§

> OK i have decided and prepared myself mentally to watch PreCure5 (and then GoGo so yaaaay 100 eps <:VanessaCracked:639136452600397829> ). OK let's get started- Oh hi Guy Shishioh. I see you're playing a baddie this time around. Unacceptable <:MikuDelete:661660028410920990>

Ah. Yes5 (Go Go). I definitely enjoyed both more than Fresh. Bunbee is great.
<:ChrisPray:672578403156885504>
So if the MC isn't very good in S1. Then that's on the show. Just because it takes until S3 for the MC to become a good character doesn't mean you can't fairly judge his character based on S1/S2 and say "I didn't like him. He's not a good character to me".
Toaru S1 is S1. There's supposed to be a beginning/middle/end for the characters.
DB(Z) isn't divided into 24-26 episode seasons though.
Goku is not stuck to 1 season. His story isn't over until the end of DBZ at the very least. He's also got way more episodes than Touma.

>  Can't say I agree with this take. That's like looking at Goku and saying that he isn't a good protagonist because he doesn't fundamentally develop as a character when he's supposed to be a static character.
> Why do people like Himiko Toga?!

Crazy yandere like girl who sucks your blood fills the desire of certain people.
> People here don‚Äôt like Taiga Aisaka

Where are these people? <a:HibikiOraOra:582365734097780746>
> And because of your name, people ignored a silent voice

A Silent Voice is really good. But the bullying early on in the movie was a bit too much for me to say "I 100% enjoyed the movie and would watch it again".
> Date a Live 3 is my fav season

That's controversial? I mean the season is a bit uhh...questionable at times. But the Origami arc was really solid.
> most famously, Shirou is often seen as a dumbfuck character in the Fate anime adaptations

Wdym. The man is definitely a dumbf**k. He's unable to get a harem ending. üòõ
Well damn. Okay then.  Guess I'm gonna have to stop being lazy and check out Railgun soon.
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025> That seems like it shouldn't be possible.
I already figured Mikoto was probably the more interesting character between the two despite me not having watched either show yet.

~~It definitely has nothing to do with the fact that she looks like a cute tsun who kicks butt~~

> If you're asking who's the more interesting character in their animes I'd say Mikoto cause she's is a ball of fun in her anime
Okay. Based on S1 only, between Railgun and Index. Which would you say developed their protagonist better? <:MikuWhoa:670502684692054042>
Oh wow. I love this anime and I'm only 8 mins in.
I know people like to give JC Staff s**t for "poor animation". But surely I know it can't be the case all the time
Say. Are all the Toaru animes done by JC Staff?
Oh. Milky is definitely a highlight of the show.
I thought the characters were far more enjoyable than what Hugtto offered.
> Wanna give some opinions people

It's really good. One of the better seasons in the past 7 years.
I didn't know JoJo was apart of the Toaruverse
It's a pretty good season. A Top 5 for me.
> Would Smile be a better starter for beginners?

If you're just looking to enjoy cute girls doing cute things and then punching a monster every week than yes. If you're looking for plot then no.
> Like a bunch of villain arcs?

Yep. Pretty much.
> with precure it's always between princess and heartcatch

Nah. There's better starter recommendations then those two.
> hugtto had pacing problems

It did. But also it shot itself in the foot by setting up a bunch of things and then only half heartedly following through on them.
> star twinkle was kinda weak in the beginning

I thought it had a very strong beginning. There were like 3-4 episodes leading up to Lala's home planet that were meh. Then there was Yuni and Elena's TI episodes. But besides that. The episodes were very good.
I'm gonna say that I enjoyed DB. But I haven't watched like any of DBZ past the initial Freiza arc because it didn't interest me. I wasn't into seeing Super Saiyan Screaming. 

~~Is it bad to say I liked Dragon Ball more when it was just about Goku as a kid pretty much?~~
*What have I started?* <:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
But, I will absolutely take horny woman gambling.
I'm not calling it a masterpiece
> I haven't watched Kakegurui but it has to have *something* to keep people invested. A story with all fights and no story is going to bore people.

You're absolutely right.  I just wanted to see how crazy the show could get.
Yes
> I also enjoyed Oreimo

**Sometimes they really do miss**
Alright. Now it's time to play my game for a bit before going to sleep.  Gonna need alot of energy to blast through Railgun
Or the elf
Hmmm....I don't know about that one. I think the Sword Princess is best. <:spiderthink:532701213062594580>
Watching DanMachi and I'm on Episode 12 now. I've gotta say that this anime is pretty good. I can see why people like it.
> I went to go see some reviews of BGS movie and I see a lot of 2/10s. That's kinda extreme ain't it?

BGS movie hit me right in the feels. It was really good imo.
> Hugtto is great but I have *some problems* with it.

Hugtto definitely has problems too.  Don't wanna speak too much on it but. It's honestly a problem if I can't say that any of the Hugtto Cures are my favorites. Even just among just the Hugtto Cures themselves. I don't have a favorite.
> no that's happiness charge that was known for being the most hated season

HapCha is definitely another love it or hate it kinda season. *The romance brought down the season* should give you enough of an idea to know where I land.
||Regina/Aguri becoming Ace is what divides people|| Anything else is kinda secondary.
It's my personal favorite. But you will definitely find people who dislike it just as much.
That's pretty much the dividing line with Doki Doki.
> Isn't Doki Doki considered to be one of the lesser good seasons?

Just like Smile. It depends on how you feel about a certain thing. In this case, it's "Do you care if 2 certain characters become a Cure or not?" and also "Are you still willing to like said characters even if one of them doesn't become a Cure?"
Hmmm....that's a tough one. Doki Doki is mostly plot related episodes that has a few twists.
> I hear Smile is better

It's good if you like Smile's characters. But Smile doesn't really have a plot and that affects the season big time imo.
https://www.crunchyroll.com/anime-feature/2020/06/03/the-wonderful-world-of-magi-and-why-its-your-new-favorite-shonen
Oh. There's definitely more than just that spoiler.
Spoilers.  <:TsubasaIgnite:672861877407318047>
Also this girl right here? She's great. Watch Suite for her.
> Not a fan of Hibiki & Kanade constantly arguing with eachother.

They'll stop doing that by half way through the season. I honestly didn't mind it that much
It doesn't help that I first read and heard it as "Sexy and erotic"
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
<@226789636989517824>
Hugtto x FuWa: All Stars Memories is really the only other time where I would say you need to watch the season to a certain point before watching the movie.
But aside from the DX trilogy, so long as you don't care about being spoiled on certain Cures existing. You can watch them at any time.
I believe DX 3(?) features villians from previous PreCure movies.
Subsequently, this also applies to DX 2 and DX 3.  

First ten episodes of whatever season the movie comes out during + all the seasons prior.
> Do I need to watch all of the shows first before watching the all star films?

You need to see FuWa - Yes5 GoGo and the first 10-ish episodes of Fresh to watch DX 1 if you don't wanna be spoiled on anything.

Railgun S1 Episode 21 ||I WAS NOT expecting the reveal of the transfer student's friend||

God. Railgun is such dumb fun
2 of these on each side of your message. ||

<:IllyaGASM:337936120199512065>
^
Railgun S will probably happen in like 2 days. First I need to watch the OVA and then do DanMachi S2.
Finished. Railgun S1.
Finale time
But I didn't know she was from that family until the reveal
^
Oh. I knew she was sketchy. They wouldn't put her in the opening if she was just a nobody.
They revealed the MAR's lady's middle name.
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>


Actually you know what. Let me spoiler mark it.
> that's the one where ||Misaka recognizes her from when she saw that one woman's memories|| right?

YES.
Holy f**k.
~~Is it as good as Mai-Hime though~~
Railgun specials are fun.

Gonna tackle Railgun S next.
Finished DanMachi S2. Not as good as S1 imo. But it's still decent.
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
Oh lord. Is that from Boruto? Yikes.
Better rename the show "Is it wrong to get Ara Ara'd in a Dungeon?"
Yep.
Yes. Join us in the beauty that is DxD
> PreCure5 Ep.34 = Jiiya still such a good lovable caring granpa butler <:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>.

Ah yes. The epic water sword.
Nani
Oh no
How interesting.
<:sweats:592203506413207563>
Ah yes. Water is quite healthy I hear.
Railgun S is getting more interesting.

Already on Railgun Episode 8
Not really. That's kinda the point of her character.
Satania is so powerful. Symphogear can't have another season because she would instantly win as the villian.
Damn. Another half wholesome/half sad episode.
Endless Misakas
Done with Sister's Arc.
Also, I've hit Ep 14 of Railgun S
Go watch it.
> I have like, alot of shit on my PTW and am not THAT interested in it, but people keep insisting me to watch it

I f**king loved DAB.
I love the Railgun side characters.
> Finished PreCure5. that's uh some way to end it. Didn't expect ||Bunbee to just get killed off with no fanfare||. On one hand kinda disappointing but on the other kinda in character to what was going on at the time. ||Milk getting despaired was intense even though i knew she would be ok because FRIENDSHIP and PreCure|| and ||Kawarino getting what he deserved by Bloody's hand was a chef kiss|| but the biggest surprise was ||big bad getting talked-no-jutsu||. Wasn't expecting that. Pretty good Cure season. Will start PreCure5GoGo after i take a break.

Ayyy. Hope you'll like GoGo.
Maybe he doesn't like Urobuchi's writing? ü§î
First 6 episodes of Index done. Didn't like it very much in comparison to Railgun.
> Just look at this cute little ayy lmao

Lala is one of my favorites. Love her so much.
> but who is that maid-girl with the blue hair? ^^

Ah yes. Good question. Who is she indeed? <:hikaruthinking:585649137022926848>
Seems like it
I've already hit Index Sisters Arc
Ah. That's right. <@87512939107450880> 

I finished the Angel Fall arc
Oh sure.  More context about the show is always helpful.
Alright. Sisters Arc of Index done.
> when, in a romance animu, the couple gets a duet song

Oooh. So Symphogear is a romance anime then? <:MikuCute:672908542763859968>
Nice
Tomorrow will be Silent Party Arc of Railgun S.
Finished Index I.
It's like the good kinda fanservice that makes you feel worth watching all those prior episodes.
Yes. Exactly.
Omg. I loved the finale. Couldn't have asked for anything better from this show.
I finished it.
Also Nozomi is a loveable dense pink so I forgive her here
Ah yes. You will meet DIO 2 more times in PreCure after that.
Started Index II today
üëç
So what you're saying is. You need more Aoi Yuuki suffering.
For people who belong to a Church, they sure are sinful.
> to get the second part of that thing.

I'm not a LN reader. I'm basing my opinions from what I have watched of the Index and Railgun seasons so far.
> it's continued in index 3

Yes that's the part I kinda don't like. The Vento fight is immediately followed up by a half done introduction arc for GROUP. The 1.5 episodes for Group just don't hold much to the Vento fight. So now I'm just upset that the season ends on something less interesting.
The ending was near perfect aside from the need to continue the Accelerator stuff. Which is why GROUP has their 1.5 episodes
But they're shoved in right after the AC Invasion Arc ends.
Yeah. I know GROUP is relevant.
> because yes the adaptation is flawed but i would like to get an opinion

I would rate it pretty much the exact same as S1. A 7 or a 7.5

There are improvements. But I'm not a fan of GROUP showing up after the Touma vs Vento fight
Index II done.
Yee. I know. I can't relate to that so I can't say something like "I can forgive the 1.5 episodes of GROUP in Index 2 some because Index III didn't come out for another 8 years afterwards" is all.
Damn. Can't believe LH S3 won't happen until January 2021 now.
Kaguya-sama S2 started out strong but I think has been slowly declining a bit for me.
> That sounds absolutely terrifying

*Laughs in Detective Conan*
<:ChrisPray:672578403156885504>
Chris is appreciated in every channel
There's the GARO anime
> Finished PreCure5GoGo. They ||SAVED CHRISTMAS! PRAISE!|| On that note, ||they didn't get some costume changing super forms. Just some fancy butterfly wings. Also finally the Cure5 getting a proper final boss fight after what happened last season. Bunbee living this long and turning good wasn't too surprising but WTF KAWARINO WAS FUCKING ALIVE?! HOW?! WHAT. THE. FUCK?! WHAT?! <:ChrisShock:620077681484103680> And he's also turned into a sorta lazy bum not listening to Bunbee lol||. For a while I thought ||Syrup was going to be the Director's son with Flora before he turned evil/lost his way or something but nope. It would've been good drama but oh well||. I liked their costume design change for the season. Rouge's transformation still being my favorite of the group because dynamic exploding fire <:ElsaCharge:690470897559011328>  with Aqua's being 2nd though Aqua and surprisingly Lemonade's attacks were my favs this time. The others were pretty good though. Mint ||getting a proper attack as an energy disk instead of the shield is good but kinda sad. That one time she used her shield attack in S1 as a super offensive move really left one hell of an impact of what she could've been capable of with it||. I was hoping ||they were going to get some new single attack moves with the Fleurets but nope|| and ||Milky Rose's Fleuret attack was just a shinier version of her regular one. Reminds me of how only Dream got a new animation attack for her Crystal Shoot in S1 but everyone else just did the exact same thing but just add the lil item. So lazy <:GarieOhYeah:688429715769262187>||. I miss the ||Cure 5 Explosion and its giant butterfly though||. Overall good season. Since I've seen the first 7 Cure series I'll probably continue in order and tackle Suite next at some point.


Ah yes. Glad you enjoyed GoGo. Suite was great. *Beat is Best Girl*

Very small likelihood because I just prefer watching things. But we'll see.

Her earlier complete unwillingness to communicate and just doing this kinda dickish attitude in the previous episodes irked me. Especially Ep.1 with

Also totally didn't tear up when Hummy was tearing up and then singing <:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>!||

Hummy is quite good at having her way.
Good. I will start calling you middle aged during AMQ then. üòõ
Same.
Finished the Otome Game Hametsu Flag anime today. A very good episode to close out the season on. Can't wait for S2 in 2021.
She came for Touma
Yep. That's all she did.
That's the other thing I take issue with
Misaka Mikoto wasn't needed in this arc at all tbh. Why she was put in if she wasn't gonna do anything is beyond me.
That's basically it.
I thought the AvT Russia fight was good for A's character but less necessary for T's.
Although the stuff with Mugino and Hamazura was a bit weird and kinda rushed.
> Or me not just feeling like watching a movie

Just get it done if you've got the time.
Oh BTW. <@87512939107450880> Started the Accelerator anime because it's apparently necessary for the 2nd Railgun T arc
Ordinal Scale was an interesting movie

> Little bit of Suite PreCure. Ep.25-29. Let us continue praising ||Cureüëè Beatüëè Bestüëè Girlüëè! Poor girl afraid of ghosts and so nervous on her first day of school but she's so adorable <:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367> . Ellen please don't take Hummy's advice so seriously. She's Hummy, even if she does mean well. Also Hummy please tell us more silly/adorable things about Ellen. I will give you cupcakes if you do <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>. Otokichi being an MVP granpa getting Ellen her school uniform and stuff and just being supportive <:GenjuroThumbsUp:336657189475188740>. MinorTrio may have also gotten powered up but at least their still idiots <:MariaChuckle:672465496515411984>. Magical Girl/Hero problems - nothing like saving the world in 30mins and just BARELY making it home in time to save the cupcakes in the oven <:FineShocked:672430513025187840>. Also Adventuring with the Fairy Tones! Them helping Hibiki waking up on time and their little training montage and being tiny little badasses <:KirikaCheer:689614085402525830> but poor little guys working themselves nearly to death because they felt guilty/responsible for loosing the music notes <:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>. Damn you Minor Trio for hurting my little fairy buddies <:TsubasaIgnite:672861877407318047>! When the evil guardian made Hummy cry and pissed off the Cures - Insert "Carol's 5 seconds to slaughter" here <:MillaarcSmile:672845884135833610>. The key to open the door was creepy but at least they have finally gotten the magical mcguffin artifact of magical power. Good job <:ElsaSmug:688429724443213903>. And look at that, the "evil guardian" of the mcguffin uses those same ear covering noise producing things Minor King used on Minor Trio and Siren. HMMMMMMMMM foreshadowing perhaps? Who knows <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>||.

Keep going. You're doing great. Beat is indeed best girl.
Accelerator anime better than Index III? <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720> 

That's the first time I've heard someone say that.
Yeah. Accelerator isn't the worst anime out there. But it's definitely the weakest of the Toarus' atm.

This thing is apparently important to NT

*From a user in the Toaru server

Novels
Which ofc I haven't but does the anime care about that? Nah.
It started out good and then took a nosedive at like Episode 10 where it started speaking about New Testament stuff that wouldn't make any sense unless I had read NT beforehand.
Done with the Accelerator anime.
CR subs aren't bad. But then again I haven't watched anything from Toei on CR with actual good Toei subs. So I guess we'll wait and see.
> Their just not thinking the type of fan/market they have in the west, etc. If their concerned then they could have just streamed it. At least the hardcore fans already buy the merch

I'm pretty sure that's what they're doing now. Streaming it and hoping the hardcore fans will bring in the money.
No/poor merchandise for the dub = no reason to try and continue dubbing the show
With a dub like PreCure, the big thing is the merchandising.
PreCure has had 3 attempts at a dub. All of which fell flat (for different reasons). It's understandable they'd be pretty hesitant about putting PreCure out there again.
Toei's pretty touchy about their properties and money.
Fair enough.
> The BR arc is not only the worst shit Toaru's pumped down my throat but actually amongst the worst things I've seen in anime

I think the WWIII Arc is where the season fell apart some for me. But I was fan of pretty much everything that happened before it.

Ah good old training montage leading to mastering the mcguffin technique of ultimate power <:TikiPraise:672430544381935625>and more Otokichi giving Beat more books and her taking the info in them too far. So cute <:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>. Open a little vending stall. Put VERY IMPORTANT items that are NOT for sale near or ON the stall and NOT put a "NOT FOR SALE,DISPLAY ONLY" sign on them.

AAAAAAAAND Muse done goof and he stole ALL THE NOTES. Goddammit Muse <:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>||.

She takes Otokichi's books so seriously, you can't help but love her even more.
As for Smile....I don't wanna speak too much on it. But it's definitely different from Suite.

> Ep.6 ||Team Assembled Party! Candy please... Miyuki's luck strikes again with a book to the face. Oh hey OP promoting the crossover movie. Hell yeah look at the old squads being such badass. Back to the show, Candy's bro is named Pop... Candy Pop... Cursed puns. Easily flustered when called cool and manly. A yes the secret code to the secret library, right, left open middle. Even bad guys like a good game of cards from time to time. Impossible code to crack! Peace sticking the landing. Yay  PreCure fairytale story time! Blahblah save the queen. Got it. JOKAH! Creepy Joker is creepy. This monogatari has only just started. Evil monsters, Bad End, revive queen but none of that matters! Gotta come up with a catchphrase! Priorities! That Akane/Nao and Miyuki/Yayoi synchronicity with Reika being the tie breaker by reasoning. FIVE PRECURE! Godammit Miyuki ending up int he South Pole- WTF ARE YOU DOING GOING OUTSIDE?! USE THE F*CKING BOOKCASE! Finally come up with a catchphrase. Perfect execution and pose! Get's blasted. Sasuga MotW. Aniki has transformation no jutsu. Turns into a giant pressing machine and goes sumo followed by holding the enemy down. OK. Pop is good onii-chan. Books - the new method of transportation. Aaaand Candy stomach ruining the emotional moment||.

Pop is a good character. Wish he was used more.
> Ep. 3||See Yayoi sketching, relatable character spotted. Hello Red Oni. Nice one putting the poor girl on the spot Akane/Miyuki and without consulting/asking her. I know what the staff was going for, their good girls, it's done with good intentions, Yayoi did want too but it irks me to no end when stuff like this happens. Huh one of the art students looks quite a lot like a shorter hair Tsubomi from Heartcatch. Yeah you better help her after nominating her without her permission. Candy please. Someone kindly and not so politely punch those art students. NOOOO HE CRUSHED THE POSTER! I LIKED THE POSTER! Aaaaand failed finishers. These girls really need to work on that spirit/focus. Yayoi snaps out of it, guesses Happy is Miyuki, Miyuki panics and exposes identity yet again. Miyuki please. Inner rage awakened! Henshin! Cure Peace! Hair makes bubble POOF noise. Rock, Paper, Scissors! Cool pose against her opponent... NOPE'D hard. I see someone may have learned Sailor Moon's "crying will unleash secret attack" technique. Casually mentioning Peace power is lightning. Sasuga Candy. PreCure Peace Thunder! Peace should take some lessons from Sailor Jupiter or Great Mazinger about thunder attacks. Oh wow went back to check but just noticed that the main character starting the ED dance changes to one of the others. Nice touch||.

Yayoi is my favorite out of the Smile cast.
If he's gonna save a certain someone, he ain't gonna pay for a taxi.
She's peak loveable dummy who's full of herself but also just wants to make friends.
Did I ever mention how much I love Kongo Mitsuko's character?
But also, I don't really watch mecha because I don't see it as something I'd be interested in.

Vanguard IF has been pretty interesting so far. Finally got around to watching Eps 2 and 3 of it.
How does a goldfish go missing? ü§î
Is the director's cut essential for S2?
CR subs never have the OPs/EDs subbed.
> unsurprisingly, crunchyroll butchered the subs for healin good

Apparently Toei gave those subs to CR. But you can give them feedback which they seem to be listening to since now the OP is subbed.
> No not 2006 fate stay night

06 Fate is not that bad. I watched it. I survived.
> Given how many cures there are, I suspect there's a lot of birthdays for them.

I think only 50% of them have official birthdays unfortunately.

Anyways, Re:Zero 2 Ep 1. I felt that entire episode right in my heart.
Kirito's got like 11 girls and then some.
Subaru only has 2 girls.
Lmao. Accelerator got on there and not Touma? Guess he really is misfortunate.
Dream Ranker Arc looking poggers. Can't wait to watch it weekly.
Date A Bullet movies look gorgeous.
Nah. I'm watching it too
Most LN authors start out pretty young tbh
SAO anime ended after the first arc. They didn't adapt that other part of the LNs and then went straight to GGO....is what I like to pretend happened.
> It reminds me of the whole. Sao alo is season 2 and not arc 2 season 1 debate

ALO Arc doesn't exist. üôÉ
I watched S1 when it aired. Haven't watched Re:Zero since then before S2 started. I was a bit lost at first but I just kinda rolled with it and by the end of the ep, I was already invested in the show again.
They just have long legs
Not really.
Astolfo is <:ChrisPray:672578403156885504>
Damn. Didn't think the show was gonna hit that hard.
At first I just thought it was gonna be Cute Girls Doing Cute Things. But the show kinda has a plot and some character development. So I'm really digging it so far.
Yee. I picked it from Ikxi's list. It's a pretty fun anime.
Damn. That's pretty cute
Never seen it. Looks like another mecha anime.
Like there's definitely plot and character development in here that I wasn't expecting intially.
(Photo is unrelated. I just wanted to have something non-spoilery to use)
Oh wow. This anime is taking a bit of a dark turn surprisingly.
I'd be down for an Astral Buddy anime.
It was a pretty good anime. I think I'll give it a 9/10 overall but I'm pretty close to giving it a 10/10 as well.

Yep.
Yeah.
üî• üî• üî•
Picked up GochiUsa today.
~~Same~~
I may ask others at times like "What was cut out from this anime?" to get a better understanding of how the anime ended up the way that it did. But overall, it's not gonna change my opinion too much.
I'm judging an anime based on the episodes it's produced and that's that. If and when I read the LN, then maybe I'll say they were right. But until then, if the anime was good **then it's a good anime**.
> Say that to ln readers

Well you see. I'm an anime only. So from that perspective. I say f**k the ln readers.
Yes. JC Staff animated S3 and there are some noticeable moments because of that. But like besides that. It was pretty good imo.
> Is Date A live a good series?

It's an interesting one. I watched S1 and S2 like a few years ago and I remember them being decent. I didn't like the movie at all. But I loved S3 a lot.
Girls und Senki
Same.
They did.
> The only love interest in School Live that matters is Shovel-kun anyways <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>


These are powerful words.
> is there yuri in school live?

Implied perhaps. But I don't think straight out.
> All the glorious modern CGI Japan can muster :YuuYay:

That looks a lot like Overlord CG.
> I have never talked to a modern naruto fan who has not had a dead look in their eye, and told me "loook it used to be good"

Naruto was good. Shipp≈´den hit some snags because they couldn't be ahead of the source material IIRC.  But overall it had many highlights. Boruto is simply milking the IP imo and I don't wanna be apart of it.
Only reason why HF is last because the 3rd movie isn't available yet.
Yep. Honestly I would say Zero ~> UBW ~> SN ~> HF
> like WW3

Misaka was barely in WWIII arc. They might as well skip it tbh.
I need to watch that movie still. Might do it today tbh.
Truth
> Apparently yes

Mmnm.I can't help but notice the angle of this shot.
Oh did he now? Sounds interesting. I just assumed he liked living there tbh.
> Except ||accel|| is in jail??

That's the least surprising spoiler I've read so far.
||But isn't LO like a few years behind the other clones? So she would take longer, right?||
Can ||Last Order|| actually grow though? <:thinkbiri:585565526185738240>
> but he lives in the same house as || mugino shizuri and the other girl ||


If he were to have an unofficial GF, I'd say ||Kinuhata(?)||
~~Having 2 MCs with GFs would be too much clearly for Toaruverse.~~ <:smugdex:675856065492942848>
Hamazura already ||got a kiss on the lips.|| Which means he's already leagues ahead in terms of being in an actual relationship.
Yeah
Hamazura
Not Kitamura. Wtf
No
Wait
Kitamura on the other hand? He's got himself set.
Touma ain't gonna get it even if he did think about romance tbh. His misfortune prevents that. <:VanessaCracked:639136452600397829>
Itsuwa best house wife
The true tsundere was Kanzaki tbh.
Kuroko isn't in love with her sister? <:satenwhy:715203152554754198>
Let me ask this. From the start of the arc to the time ||Mikoto|| shows up in ||Russia||. Is there anything she actually does in AC?
Yeah. But you can't strech those scenes into a whole Railgun arc imo.
Well...||Mikoto|| doesn't do much in ||Russia|| because that's mostly a ||Touma|| arc. What she does there was already shown in Index III. So I kinda don't see much of a point in showing the Railgun side there.
I don't think we'll get another Index anime until 2022 at the earliest.
2008 ~> 2011 from Index to Index II.

Let's say that this will be how things will be after Railgun T.
There's no way they'd pump out 3-4 seasons if we presume how long it took from Index II to Index III.
Oh so definitely not in this decade.
How many seasons would you say we potentially are from NT.
Yeah yeah.
Then there we go. His pretend nature would make it seem like ||he would want to live in a jail cell|.

> BUT HE'S GOT A PRETTY DEMONESS NOW with him

Can't wait for when that becomes adapted into the anime in 2031.
Or at least, he pretends that he doesn't wanna get bothered.
Because he is the type of character who would ||want to live in a jail cell just so that he isn't bothered||.
Nah. Nevis is right.
> What do you mean Railgun F? Next is Railgun U, because we need the 5th season to be Railgun V

<:reijilaugh:637400095322669096>
Accel and Railgun T didn't air at the same time though?
So let's say. 2023, Index IV happens. Then maybe 2025 we get Railgun F.
Like I said, I don't think Railgun would do a arc without a source.
That's what I thought.
But would that happen in Railgun T though is what I'm asking.
I just don't see a whole ||WWIII|| Arc being done in Railgun T when there's 0 source to go off of.
If it's written in the manga before being adapted in the anime, that's fine.
So then wouldn't it be odd to have a whole arc that doesn't exist anywhere else
Let me ask this. ||Is the Railgun manga at WWIII yet?||
Wouldn't that make it filler though if nothing happens in the novel but does in the anime though?
Better spoiler mark that
So nothing happens in the time she's in AC essentially if what you're saying is true.
Pfft. Glad to see he still likes his coffee.
But is there a chance for JC Staff to get more money by having another Accel anime perhaps? Yes.
Well let's put it this way. What if it was a season based on just the Accel parts of the novels? That could be possible, right?
Well yes. But that doesn't mean you can't still make money off it by making another season.
And then probably Accel as well.
Considering they're also definitely gonna wanna make another Railgun anime
Or if they do, just barely making it
Sure. Point still stands I don't think they'll be able to pump out 4 NT seasons within 8 years.
> Latest drama I had the misfortune to see is if you headcanon the characters as anything but lesbians (bi, for example) you're homophobic.


Ooh boy. That's pretty dumb for them to say.
What are they saying now?
<:reijilaugh:637400095322669096>
> specially with season 3  , i have't watched it but i know its rushed

It is definitely rushed. But ||Hamazura|| is still best protagonist.
> do you guys read the light novel? im just in season 2 of index

Nah. I pick up Index novel spoilers though.
Interesting.
Don't think I've heard of it
I'm just trying to catch up to clear my backlog of episodes some.
It's middle of the road so far. Mostly good episodes but nothing outstanding.
Catching up on Healing Good. The rain makes Shindoine crazy apparently.
I like SAO. But am I watching because of Kirito's character? Nah. His character for what it is works. But I'm more interested in anyone else really. Do I wanna see Kirito wreck others though? Yes.

The greatly animated fights of the entire Alicization + WoU arc are top notch work imo. The story/characters help support the fights and that's great imo.
> Is it just me or do y'all secretly like SAO?

Nah. I love SAO. I just don't usually have much to say about it.
> Yeah, that's another thing I don't like about SAO. I could never empathize with the antagonists in the serie. And if I ever could, then I don't remember so it's pointless

I'm pretty sure most of the antagonists aren't supposed to be relatable in SAO though?
> and the newest announced anime is full cgi

Must cost them big bucks to go fully CG. üëÄ
> only og and cg don't have cgi

I know what you mean by cg here, but it's still hilarious.
Aight. With exceptions like IDOLM@STER and whatever else,  most idol animes have CG that isn't the best in their first season.
> Sunshine‚Äôs CG wasn‚Äôt that bad

* They all have bad CG starting out. If they get a S2 or it's Love Live. It'll improve.
CG, SmeG. It's an idol anime. They all have bad CG.
Zombieland Saga is a fun 12 episode idol anime you can watch.
I'm having a great time with GochiUsa. Gonna knock out the last 2 episodes when I wake up.

Yes hello. You will fall into the PreCure rabbit hole.  <:deathgrab:727069348698521701>

It's because Kasumi would win.
Yep.
I'm about to watch Episode 6 and then call it a night pretty much.
It's decent so far surprisingly.
Yes
*Ms. Vampire who lives in my neighborhood*

BEEF STROGANOFF
Railgun T episode is great so far and I'm only at the opening.
Zexal II is a rollercoaster.
Yes
> Never really watched Railgun before, and why this might seem stupid to ask considering you all seem to like it, but is it worth getting into?

It's definitely worth it imo.
My Ranking of best to worst:
‚Ä¢ Arc-V (sub)

‚Ä¢ ZEXAL (II) [dub, but I've seen enough clips of the sub to feel that it's pretty good as well]

‚Ä¢ Duel Monsters (dub, but I have seen the Orichalcos arc in sub)

‚Ä¢ VRAINS (sub)

‚Ä¢ GX/5Ds (N/A, I never really watched these shows growing up and have no intention currently of ever getting into them)
Yep
They are yeah. But like Krika said, we don't learn about ||Barian Shingetsu|| until later on.
Re: Shingetsu ||Are we talking kind Shingetsu or Barian Shingetsu?||
Yep
You can join us big kids at the adult table one day soon, Gwen.
I mean ||Kaito dying on the moon because of lack of oxygen makes it feel more invested and serious imo. Then if it was just "death by dueling"|| 

More Zexal II spoilers, Sorry Gwen.
> when am I allowed to look at that

When the final duel between 2 Dragon users happens.
> Oh wow, that's the first time I've seen someone rank Arc-v that high up.

The plot kinda sucks. But most of the characters for most of the show are pretty cool. Plus it's got the biggest variety of duels imo.
Accel beat those kids. That's all anyone needs to know really.
They didn't appear in Index III because Index III came out before Accel.
> The darkside people at the end of the last ep

Those are Accel characters.
Which ones?
Wow
New SAO episode was meh. The ending is pretty intriguing though. These last 4 episodes I hope will be entertaining.
Started WIXOSS with Selector Infected.
Ooh. This character kinda look like Miku.
I swear he looks like a grown up Ishigami.
Things feel much better here.
Not feeling sleepy enough yet (probably shouldn't have dranken that Dr. Pepper earlier). So I've decided to start Lostorage Incited WIXOSS. I'm currently on Ep 4.
Too many seasonal animes for me to spend my week keeping up with
By all means go ahead. Honestly like half of the reason why I'm watching it is because it's a "card battle" anime and I wanna diversify my list more for when I play AMQ.
In which case, why have it aside from aesthetic purpose.
Yeah. The plot being a Madoka plot isn't 100% a bad thing. But I mean it's almost as if they don't wanna sell the card game itself.
But yeah. I feel like it would fit the mahou shoujo genre better than the card game genre.
Ironic you say that because AniList has Magia Record as the only recommendation for Lostorage Incited WIXOSS.
Finished both Selector seasons of WIXOSS. It's...an anime. A very weird one at that. Lots of things happening in every episode with a lot of lore overall. Yet the card game is very poorly explained as to how it actually works and a lot of the characters could have probably used some more focus on.
Oh. 

Hmmm....that's probably not gonna happen unfortunately.
What happens here?
True
But even the Lostorage seasons were a bit wonky and certain characters I wanted to see were hardly there in Conflated.
The Lostorage seasons were definitely better than the Selector seasons.
All done with the WIXOSS seasons (until the new one airs)
~~Anime does indeed suck. Why can't we have big chested tsunderes too.~~ üò≠

~~It's why I like Styil more~~
> And every magic encounter is either resolved via deus ex machina or Touma hand go brrrrrrr

Yeah. Touma punching can get boring.
Actually make that 2-3+ years because we're gonna probably get another Index season first.
We probably won't see Railgun tackle WWIII Arc for another year considering it's not in the manga yet.
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
> becase touma was busy with something

He's busy trying to recover his wallet from Index.
Daihaisei Arc takes place over a week. But Index only shows like the first 2 days of it for example. While Railgun shows what happened after those 2 days.
So what you see in Index won't show up the same in Railgun.
Because Railgun is always behind Index
> On the topic of Index btw, assuming I've only seen Railgun, how far can I watch without coming across any spoilers

All of it technically.
Hamazura > Touma.

Just by Index III alone.
<:reijilaugh:637400095322669096>
Oh wow. I didn't know Darkness was in Twintail.
Nice
I just can't get into anything besides 03 and a lot of people seem to forget about it in comparison to the original or the 2012. <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
4kids also made TMNT 03. Which was mostly <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
Tbf, Sonic X dub slapped
VRAINS dub I've heard is pretty accurate. But I feel like Zexal was just the last time the voices fit.
DanMachi S2 was meh. Hoping S3 will be better like S1 was.
New Railgun episode was okay.
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
Ah yes ofc. As SC President, the first thing she would do is ask the students. <:GenjuroLaugh:689563633516150872>
This truly is a top quality show
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
Decided to watch more Twintail today. What an interesting situation to walk into. <:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
Isn't Nanoha dark?
I think next I'll check out Ascendance of a Bookworm.
Finished Twintail. It was good. Started to falter a bit around Ep 9 or so though.
<:MikuWhoa:670502684692054042>
<:FudouEyes:672846284725682195>
Also now I will add Miru Tights to my PTW
> Everyone else is horny, Souji's just a fan of twintails

Souji is just Issei but obsessed with twintails. <:KirikaActually:688433197402554423>
Oh and then there are other characters. The mentor and the mom have quite the interesting duo dynamic.
It's essentially Kazuma but he's not as dumb and is horny for twintails, a tsundere partner who's good at fighting, and Darkness except she wants to hit others.
Yeah. But then there are also the actual villians.
It was mostly good. It faltered in like the last 2-3 episodes imo.
*imo
New Re:Zero episode was decent. Better than Railgun's latest episode at least.
Yeah. People s**t on Silent Party all the time and while I get that the villians are terrible and ||it's non canonical|| it's still really good imo.
> you gotta be fucked in the head for even to get in aca city

Idk. Blau seems to be perfectly sane. <:smugdex:675856065492942848>
Nijigasaki Anime, Oct 3.  <:MikuWhoa:670502684692054042>
Caught up on Super Hxeros. I kinda like it. Interested in seeing how things will be resolved in the final 2 episodes.
üëÄ
I forgot what I put down. But it definitely wasn't this name.
I'd still drink the Witch's tea tbh. <:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
Yes
At least have them sub all the plot episodes.
Honestly it would be nice.
~~Also, everyday I choose to pretend that the ALO arc doesn't exist. SAO S1 ended after the first arc.~~ <:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
Nah, you're right Ruby.
Fair about the Kirito harem part. I think I can look past that though.
It's true. Sinon is a sexy sniper and therefore makes things more interesting. <:ManOfCulture:609373441530920974>
They oughta stop calling it One Piece and start calling it Never Ending Pirate Journey because that's what the show is now. <:TsubasaSmug:585839805737467920>
Therefore the joke is that "Shokuho has big boobs. Which means her ideals are the best." <:YumiPoint:688429724103344164>
Shokuho has big bedonkers. You said protagonists put out their ideals with their chests.
She's more of a protag in Railgun. But I'm referring to "chest" part here if you catch what I'm saying
~~So what kinda ideals does Shokuho put out then?~~ <:ShemHaTilt:729980149529051156>
Battle Royale Arc of Index III is great. The arc after that though? Hamazura and Accel be kicking ass and taking names but Touma's standing on top of a pillar to talk about "ideals".
Accel was mostly fine. I'm talking Touma, the master of talking up an entire arc meanwhile other protagonists are doing much cooler things.
*Fixed
> I dont wanna read the lns though ugh:YrrowSpin:

I mean neither do I. By all means, watch Toaru. Just keep your expectations kinda mid when it comes to the animes ~~except Railgun imo~~.
> Isnt his season decent

It's mostly good right up to some bs that happens in like the last 2 episodes which was followed by manga bait.
> Should i watch toaru

Nah. It ain't worth it imo.
Then that makes him the main main protagonist. Everything revolves around him (and Index) first.
Then wouldn't that mean that Touma is therefore more important compared to the other two.
Touma is one of 3 focuses but he's the one that started it all. Is this not a fair statement to make?
Touma has a few good moments. But it shouldn't be that after 3 seasons and a movie. I don't like him a ton and find him to be boring. And yet Hamazura essentially only has Index III and I like him way better.
I'm sure it was. But guess what? It had a ton of characters not named Touma fighting.
While I would love to say "Well just make Touma less complex". That's definitely not possible and I don't think that would really benefit his character at this point.
> Removing his monologues destroys a part of his character


Yeah. I get that. They don't have to remove all the monologue. But idk. Is there no way to have like a cliff notes version of them?
I thought UBW was the better route (aside from HF) though?
Yeah but I can get behind Emiya still. Is it because it's Fate or because it's the writing? That's debatable I suppose. But, by your explanation. I oughta dislike Emiya just as much as Touma.
But how come I find the 45%  to be boring and the 55% to be better. <:HibikiThink:688429715362414641>
Sorry Cypher. Anyways, I will give the LNs the benefit of the doubt and say that Touma is much better handled there. But, I'm gonna still hold out on it probably until the anime can convince me it's worth it or I learn something that'll make it worth reading to me.
> she's a *completely flat* character


~~You forgot the part about her chest being flat too.~~ /j
Good question. Should I believe in the Index LNs which I know are probably better than the anime or feign ignorance and stick to Biribiri? <:ElsaSick:689395768754569359>
So it's all good.
By the time I reach that point in the LNs, I'll probably have forgotten about it.
~~They should have invaded DC instead~~
Nani
<:riderhenshin:422678642393481217>

Catching up on Vanguard IF.
I'm thinking about maybe checking out Shakugan No Shana soon. Has anyone here seen it? <:TsubasaNote:689554460044820608>
Decided that I would watch the *Prisma Illya Oath Under The Snow* movie today. Sakura's trying to smooth her way into Shirou's bed and I just find that hilarious.
Oh yeah. I might have to check out Yuru Yuri at some point as well.
We'll see about Progressive tbh. If it's a good time killer, I'll watch it.
I kinda wanna rewatch the first arc of SAO S1 again tbh.
Yeah. Re:Zero S2 doesn't seem to be hitting quite the same as I remember S1 being. SAO for the most part did seem to have more consistency.
~~Railgun T+1 will be the new season name /j~~
JC Staff sure likes picking up a ton of anime.
I personally think the 3rd season is the best. Then the 4th. Then the 2nd. Then the 1st.
I have many questions now
Just about to start Episode 6. Ara Ara lady is <:MikuLewd:336656493606862868> <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
I'm gonna watch it later today
Started Boarding School Juliet today out of boredom and because fripside OP. First episode was okay but just made me want a Yuri version of the anime.
Yuka Iguchi is back. <:TsubasaBliss:672861879000891432>
DanMachi III episode 1 was pretty good
Yeah. JC Staff seems pretty 50/50
Good question. I'm not sure since it's not following the SIF AS timeline.
Some of those matchups were pretty interesting ngl.
YES

Exactly
> just skip over half of the sunshine movie :15min:

Just skip the Sunshine movie entirely. <:VanessaCracked:639136452600397829>
> If I wanna check out the Love Live! franchise, is "Love Live! School Idol Project" the one I start with?

Yep. Otherwise the Nijigasaki anime will also do.
Toei has Saint Seiya as well
^
The Movie with them in America for part of it is pretty great indeed.
I've had the Mari pfp for awhile now. But today is officially the day I change it to Kasumin.
Nah. I like screenshotting as I go.
<@199928870810419200> I have like 100 screenshots of Kasumi this episode. I started the episode like 2 hours ago and I'm only getting to the ED of the episode now. <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594> <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594> <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594> <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594> <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594> <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
Kasumi for President. I approve of this.
<:TsubasaBliss:672861879000891432> My girls are back.
> gonna need to get insurance that covers death from cuteness

Same
> <@262326868366065664> and how deep is it

Deeper beyond card games and idols I'd bet
> And I was thinking cardfighter vanguard was something I can easily get addicted to

There's an iceberg to everything Bushiroad sponsored.
Ok. So just stick to Funimation
Oh yeah. I just saw that too
Funimation has the movies
> Just realized something that puts a bit of a damper on the Love Live spree. Not sure where to find the first season or the movies

CR has the seasons
Alternatively, you can also watch the currently airing Nijigasaki anime.
You don't have to watch SIP in order to watch Sunshine. But it definitely helps.
Love Live School Idol Project (SIP)  S1
Love Live SIP S2
Love Live The School Idol Movie

Love Live Sunshine S1
Love Live Sunshine S2
Love Live Sunshine The School Idol Movie: Over The Rainbow
The rest you can get on Funi though
Okay.  S1 of SIP you're gonna have to pirate
Oh rip.
Actually perhaps even having no manga is better than being the Accelerator manga
> Oh so it's Accelerator


No. You see the Accelerator anime was good for about 10 episodes then went to s**t and had a manga bait ending even though apparently the manga is pretty bad as well.


DanMachi probably has a better manga (if it has one) than Accelerator.
Lmao yeah. Japan Box Office be booming without them
Pogs
Lmao. Yeah. They are Unlimited Evasion Works
I came out amazed and gave it a 10/10.
I went into RevStar just knowing a few things like some of the VAs and "Fly Me To The Stars".
My God. Finally!
I haven't seen any Tsubasa fans weilding swords on their legs. So clearly we haven't reincarnated yet. <:KirikaActually:688433197402554423>
We need "I reincarnated as a Symphogear fan".
Finished Yuru Yuri yesterday. I'm planning on checking out Kinrio Mosiac next. But does anyone here wanna give me suggestions for after that?
It's fair but like at the same time. It's something I feel you should be used to.

There is usually some balance.
Imo, no s**t that the Pink and the midseason are gonna have the most amount of screentime. They are the 2 most important characters of the group. That doesn't change in any season.
If it ain't the pink, it's the midseason, if it's not the midseason, it's some other character.
Mfs can't decide on 1 person.
People always say that "X Character is having all the screentime".
Megumin is looking a bit too similar to a certain character from a certain numbered piece of media.
<a:CarolBonk:801541794713829437>
If anything I would say KxK is a romantic comedy that strongly focuses on the comedy and is aware of the tropes other romance shows have and uses that to it's advantage.
He's definitely not an idiot 100%.
I enjoy it. It is a bit like Konosuba I agree. But, I like the whole idea of just the guy trying to cheat his way out of doing hard work for himself because others enjoy profit from his forced corporate dedication (until it comes back to nip them)
One of these episodes we'll get a minute of handholding so powerful. They'll have to censor it.
If it's not ||something that happened in the hospital itself that is||.
||Maybe a car accident on the way to or from the hospital, me thinks?||
I thought the ||person she saw in the fishtank was Kukuru's sister (they looked female) but maybe she was seeing herself with her parents?|| No wait. Scratch that part. It's not possible.
I don't think we exactly know if ||her parents are dead or not. Maybe they're alive but just split up or elsewhere.||
Yeah. I'm definitely thinking that ||Kukuru had a sister who died as a miscarriage. Maybe this led to the death of her parents as well?||
Good for them. Glad it's their day.
I may just drop it.
Yeah. It's pretty plain so far.
I don't. If you consider Code Geass to be one, then it is my favorite.
Can't escape PreCure now, Ash.
"Sets the AMQ tag to CGDCT and Mahou Shoujo"
It's just gonna detract from the experience some. So that's why I feel a need to point it out.
I am not everyone and ultimately the OP/ED flip flopping is not gonna make me not want to watch the show.
The flip flops aren't consistent so it throws things off for me.
They can do what they do. It's just a matter of personal preference. I like consistency.
Overall like I said. Everything else is great.
It's a nitpick in the end. I get why they do it.
Right. That's pretty good. But also. $0 for something that can technically last forever (there are tons of pirate sites and no way to easily take them all down. If one goes down, another one will pop up to take it's place).
I understand wanting to support the shows I enjoy. But money is money. $20 for let's say 4 episodes vs $10 for all (on a CR/Funi) or $0 (pirate).
That's understandable. But like I said. I just don't pay for DVDs like ever for anime. The episodes come out weekly somewhere and I can always revisit them on that somewhere pretty much for free.
I get their market is DVD first, but I don't pay for the DVDs because the content for the DVDs comes out online first. So I feel like if I'm watching it online, it oughta be consistent on the OP/ED. I could skip it. But skipping them just because of their methods feels kinda lame imo. <:RengeShrug:609373443225419786>
I would have 0 issues.
If it was 1 consistent choice and they stuck with it.
Just that OP/ED thing takes me out of it some.
Then that's on them. I mean everything else regarding them is fine.
That's understandable for a DVD release. But, for streaming? 

I just prefer consistency is all. If they can only do one. Do the EN subs imo. Or less preferably Romanji. 

But the flip flop kinda ruins the experience of watching the episodes a bit for me.
Instead of just having both every episode or not having any at all.
The only thing I dislike with them is that they'll switch between romanji and English subtitles for OPs/EDs every other episode.
Sentai Filmworks are generally willing to pick up things the other 2 services don't.
Ep 1 was pretty good despite how weird it was.
So I finally decided to watch Destiny Of The Shrine Maiden.
Besides yuri is not necessarily a 1 thing fits all term. Does 2 girls holding hands a lot count as yuri? Some will say yes, others will say no.
I mean it's not primarily yuri. But it's still there. So I feel it's fair to call it as such.
Well. Let's put it this way. It's more in your face with Symphogear than your average CGDCT
I mean it's not hard Yuri like Symphogear. But it's definitely there.
If you want wholesome yuri, there's Ms. Vampire Who Lives In My Neighborhood.
Does it have to be explicit to be yuri though? I'm certain there are animes out there that are considered yuri despite being non-explict. But <:RengeShrug:609373443225419786>
Everyone is in it together and that's what it makes great to witness
It's interesting
But the one you're thinking of is Raychell.
There's quite a few Bandori seiyuus that are in D4DJ and Bandori
^
Ah. I remember when this happened.
Let me put it this way. Controversy sells. The author of the work is just making use of that but they aren't some deranged person. That being said, I would recommend watching the interview with the author first to get an idea of what the show is like. I won't say don't watch it. I will say it's definitely messed up and not something I would say you absolutely must watch for it's societal commentary that one might bring up from it.
I started with 06, then UBW, then Zero. It really doesn't matter imo.
Doesn't FSN spoil a bit of Zero too though? Or was that UBW?
Well yes. But when I say FSN I mean 06. Otherwise I wouldn't specify UBW because everyone knows UBW exists.
It's definitely a jumbled mess. But, I mean. I wasn't expecting much out of most of these shows when I picked them to watch. So I'm alright with it being a mess.
I am open to suggestions.
I have watched Girls Und Panzer. It is pretty fun but the only issue with it is that there are too many characters to keep track of.
It's not a masterpiece. But it was pretty fun
As someone who doesn't really watch any shows involving people who pilot any kind of mech suits very often. It was a fun anime.
I'll put it this way.
After that, Idoly Pride and LBX Girls I would say were pretty good from start to finish.
At least from the ones I watched this year so far that weren't sequels.
Super Cub
Can't wait for Evangelion gacha.
It gets better as the seasons go on.  That being said, there's a few not so great things that still remain.
Really?
I was considering it but it didn't interest me based on the summary.  So I skipped it.

My ptw for next season is smaller than this season.
I think Drugstore, Kobayashi, Tsukimichi, Black Company, and Bokutachi are the best from what I'm watching this season.
Hard to say objectively. My contenders are Fresh, Hugtto, Smile, and HappinessCharge.
It's the same canonical logic as Rider and Sentai. Just gotta go with it and not question anything.
Yes but how I should put it. He's a great character but a terrible first official male Cure.
I mean the anniversary aspect is better than HapCha and the anniversary episodes are one of the few highlights of Hugtto imo.
Make 2 seasons and go for a movie
This seems to be a thing now.
P.A. Works. Let them be girlfriends already
Assassination Classroom? ü§î
Probably 25% of all anime take place in a school setting though?
I haven't even watched Clannad. <:GenjuroThumbsUp:336657189475188740>
~~The best SoL is Yuru Camp and Super Cub~~
S**t personality? Nah. There's worse than her.
What
Nah. The bus driver is actually their father. That's the twist.
I don't care enough to read the LN because I've got other shows to explore.
I personally am usually satisfied with how most shows that I have watched end.
Things like that.
You want to see more of the MC getting into fights, go read the Seirei LN.
If you want to see more of the wacky things that happen in Isekai Drugstore. Go read the LN.
It's all about the right targets I would guess.
It's a mess. But there's worse. The OP technically did not lie. Everything shown in it did happen. So that's good enough for me.
Damn. Rikako at it again voicing more girls who got feelings for other girls.
You could also see it as she opens up more because she has Fuuka though
Who's providing more emotional support at the moment? It ain't Kai. That's all I'm pointing to.
I mean Kai is ok. But like Fuuka is the one doing more for Kukuru and vice versa. 

Kai likes Kukuru but Kukuru is just "Thanks my friendo".
||She canceled her intial flight to support Kukuru. Yeah. Sure they aren't for each other.||
(I mean that scene basically says it all to me. But you know. If you've got an extra 12 episodes anyways might as well go further with it)
Praying for harder yuri subtext in Cour 2. <:ChrisPray:672578403156885504>
You're right. Mb.
And yet Railgun Mikoto is better than Index Touma. <:GenjuroLaugh:689563633516150872>
True
Bet on Chris Pratt being Mario and get $10m
It took him ||a month in the future with Shinoaki||. But when you really think about. It's still all 2nd hand info.
So even if it's a good ||timeline|| that he's in, ||he didn't actually go through it all personally||. It's like people calling you a savior for something you don't remember doing but everyone else says happens.
Also tbf to Kyoya, ||he didn't actually marry Shinoaki. He has no recollection of it happening.||
True
**We are all giant isopods in this server. You can not escape us forever.**
Don't worry Cocoa. Eventually we'll turn this into a Love Live server and then you'll be caught in the rabbit hole.
That sounds very yikes but also I had never heard of this before?
https://tenor.com/view/wow-huh-what-excuse-me-what-did-you-say-gif-16867350
The thing with Gaim is that I truly believe Urobuchi didn't know how to write a Live Action series.

You can't write Madoka Magica the same way as it. One is a 12 episode animated series. The other is like a 50 episode Live Action series. The shocking events become less shocking the more it's done.
No matter how out there it is
Or will be one
If there's a source material, there's probably an anime for it
<:RengeShrug:609373443225419786>
This is supposedly the synopsis (in English)
The date in that episode. <:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
Congrats.
If you know, then you know.

Just wanted to say how much the Jahy OP slaps.
Irina had already been to the moon
Yugioh GX, Yugioh 5Ds, Yugioh Zexal, Yugioh A5, Yugioh VRAINS
GoPrincess, Fresh, Heartcatch
The Holy Green War
That's how UFOTable got away for so long.
Visuals are fine. But I wouldn't say they're mind blowing or anything.
Felt like a mixture of Symphogear, Fate/, and then a lot of comedy.
Watched the first episode of takt op. It was eh.
<:hyper3c:356775729293164544>
Especially the post-credits scene
New Aquatrope episode was very good.
‚ù§Ô∏è
Saw that we were talking earlier about what we're watching this season. Here's what I've got atm. Haven't watched Komi yet but I plan to.
Miku, is that you? <:MikuWhoa:670502684692054042>
If it ain't performing like the mouse wants, then the mouse is gonna send it to the canner.
I mean they kinda are?
I joined an anime club in high school and that's how I got exposed to a variety of animes in a way.
I don't remember really. Yugioh, Dragon Ball Z Kai, Pok√©mon, Detective Conan, Sonic X, Megaman. I watched a bunch of anime when I was younger. If we're talking when I knew what I was watching was called anime. Then it's more like AOT, Death Note, SAO, Fullmetal Alchemist, Toradora, Soul Eater, Tokyo Ghoul, Pandora Hearts, Ouran High School Host Club, The Devil Is A Part-Timer, and Naruto + Shipp≈´den
YuYuYu. Truly a duality of heartwarming and heartwrenching
They just had to drop that obvious spoiler and make Selection Project feel more like an Idoly Pride ripoff huh.
People say that but I don't really think it was that impressive.  It's not terrible but it didn't really feel like it came from the show if that makes sense
I mean yes but it's also a non-yuri harem anime.
Big mood. But I also keep forgetting how f**king funny it is that Mami is voiced by Yuu's VA.
Regardless, it's good so far for sure.
So it's really more of a Season 2.5
From my understanding YuYuYu S3 takes place in between S1 and S2.
More like everything getting shoved onto JC Staff because the other studios don't want it.
You can have the best written book in the world but words at the end of the day are still words. They can't accomplish everything without visuals and voices to put to them.
I mean I don't trust them 100% but depending on what's being rated I would take it into consideration.
<:RengeShrug:609373443225419786> I'm not really an imaginative person. So I really hate being told "Protagonist is just a protagonist." in a sense.

I'd rather be able to know "Ok. This is what protagonist looks like. Now I have a solid idea to keep remembering as I'm doing whatever it is."
Right. You can have a mental image. But the mental image may be different from the actual image. In which case, I would prefer the actual image over the one in my head (unless it's somehow worse. Which is a possibility but one you would hope isn't going to happen)
Yesnt? Things get popular for a reason. If the writing was completely garbage, no one would really be investing their time it (unless there was something else that can make them overlook said bad writing).

Symphogear is somewhat popular, right? Most people here probably like/love it. I don't though. I think it's kinda a mess and not really my kinda show. Does this mean Symphogear is s**t? No not really. It just means that maybe it's not as good as the community hypes it up to me.


Let's take a seasonal for the opposite example. The Drugstore Isekai from the last season. It was good, I enjoyed it. Is it better than Code Geass? No. Definitively no. That doesn't mean Drugstore isekai sucks though. It just means it doesn't reach that same level for me as Code Geass does and that's ok.
As for the art, idk. It looked like Aquatrope to me still.
It doesn't excuse her behavior but there's a path towards development opening up and that's good enough for now.
I think this was a pretty good episode personally.
Despair
Oh hey. It's Setsuna's cousin.
That's what it is so far yeah.
A continuity like no other.
Virtual Tsubasa concerts when
<@171395487247630336> I think you're the one who's reading the Elaina books right now, yes?
I think Superstar was alright. But Ren and Keke weren't utilized as well.  Also the finale just wasn't as good as it could have been.
Sunshine isn't a mistake but imo. They just aren't that good even without the comparison to Muse.
Saint Snow was cool but they kinda came in late. Their real banger was in the movie.
||A-Rise had 3 songs and I would say I believe them to better rivals then SunnyPa right now||
||Well yeah. But also.  SunnyPa has had like 1 f*&king song the entire season. It doesn't really feel like Liella lost because SunnyPa was better. More so they lost because there needs to be a S2 and the loss is ok because school is saved||
It wasn't what Superstar did which is ||School is saved. Time to justify Liella's loss because there's no way they'll beat Sunny Passion.||
Yeah but Muse makes sense and well ||they did save the school in the end via S2||.
Ah mb.
Ok but they wanted to win Love Live  ||to get more students into their school because there weren't enough new students interested for the next school year||. So it's pretty much the same. ||The show solves this though so it means that's it's ok for Liella not to make to the finals.|| <:YumiPoint:688429724103344164>
Idolm@ster has somewhat better characters but the shows kinda drag.
She's got more than Mari "Shiny" Oharu
~~I personally think Kasumin is better at being what Nico is than what Nico is.~~
and that's fair. <:CocoaThumbsUp:848515018957127721>
~~She's not even Rin. Rin is better. She's closer to Hanayo.~~
~~I think the worst offense for Zuramaru is them trying to say she's the Rin of Aqours in that one episode~~
Nah. Most boring is probably Zuramaru for me tbh. Yohane's shtick does get a bit old too. Especially in the film. Ruby is...alright. Chika is...an orange. The 3rd Years....also exist.
Muse for me has that feeling that together or apart. They're excellent characters. Like I love all the first and 2nd years. Then for 3rd years, I don't like them as much. But Eli, Nozomi, and Nico are still decent.
Individually the Sunshine characters work. But all together with the plot? Not really for me.
They're alright.
You's Cousin, SS, and You. That's all I care about in regards to Sunshine.
||Too bad their movie is kinda a clone of the Muse one but with far less heart put into it.||
I don't remember what happened in S2. But it probably had more SS. So I'll take your word on that.
~~God. I just remembered the Niji S2 poster exists. My poor Shioriko. What did they do to you.~~
Superstar as a S1 is decent. If S2 fixes some things. Then I'll probably move it higher above Sunshine. Otherwise, they're not as outstanding as Muse or Niji.
Niji and Muse are pretty much tied for me as the best.
<:GarieLaugh:744464898540437544>
I don't think it's Yuu. They're too busy being oblivious to Ayumu.
No one in specific I don't think. It's just kinda the school itself coming together to make them.
Kotori is good. But there's no Muse with the holy tomato Maki.
Cute Girls Drawing Mangas when. Ash is in desperate need of another Comic Girls.
Yeah. That's a trope though. It's not the story, characters, and setting themselves.
Once an idea is taken. You can't just necessarily do the exact same thing again.
As for the issue of "all these Isekais are just "[Insert thing here] but with a twist". Isn't that just how most anime are. There are tons of CGDCT animes. Ones is about motorbikes. Another is about video games. Etc.


It doesn't make the entire genre worst. It just makes sense because you want to have something that makes people check that specific work over others.
Both are popular but not for the same reason.
But No Game No Life and Re:Zero are completely different.
You can't say there's no creativity behind isekais or that they're all generic fantasy. There's just so much that comes out now and at a first glance a lot of them may seem similar or use some similar ideas.
There are a lot of isekai and not all of them are great. But they're all made for someone in mind who's going to be interested in it.
Let me put it this way. There are good isekai and there are bad isekai.
No Game No Life. Super popular. Also an isekai.
The Devil Is A Part-Timer could be described as an isekai. It's not considered terrible though.
There were dark mahou shoujo before Madoka.  It just so happens Madoka brought the boom and so the opportunity was there afterwards for more to do the same as Madoka.
Just like how you might say "Madoka is at fault for having all these dark & edgy magical girl shows".
If it wasn't SAO, it was probably gonna be something else at some point and then the blame would go to it.
There were isekais before SAO. SAO may have brought a boom. But it's not SAO's fault that it just so happened to be the series to utilize the concept in an extremely popular way.
I mean money is money at the end of the day. Food has to go on the table somehow.
None taken. You aren't the first person to say that and you won't be the last.
The summary implies a double isekai. Interesting. ü§î
It's not mindless. But there's 2 ways to view it. "Fun action show where gun girl goes blam and there's blood" or "deep character show about people who made bad decisions and that messing up how the world is".
I do enjoy some aspects of Symphogear. But it's just that what I enjoy isn't enough to cover what I didn't like from the seasons.


IOW, not everything is the same and nothing stunted any creativity just because it was the start of a massive trend.
and in the end, Symphogear was meh overall to me and that's ok because not all mahou shoujo are the same and there are different strokes for different people.
I didn't watch Symphogear because it's the best magical girl anime ever or had a cool looking poster. I simply picked it up because of interest since there were people around me who were talking about it.
I mean that's just how it is. I don't watch every seasonal anime. Just the ones I think I'll have interest in.
I mean the definition of mahou shoujo is kinda loose. So that's why I'm saying technically.
YuYuYu is good mostly. Is it better than Madoka? Hard to say. I'd have to rewatch Madoka. Kill La Kill is technically a mahou shoujo. But it's not Madoka.
But I think I got my point across here.
Well Muskoku Tensei isn't a high schooler
Isekai may have the trope of "the protagonist is a high schooler who died because they got hit by a vehicle". But Mushoku Tensei isn't the same as Spirit Chronicles.
But yeah. You have to look at these animes as "what do I like, what do I dislike, and does one outdo the other or do they kinda balance each other out or kinda end up average". That's how I approach how I rate things anyways. If I truly enjoyed it, that enjoyment will be enough to overlook any issues I have with the show or the reverse (flaws of a season are so present it automatically demerits the enjoyment of the anime otherwise)
I'm assuming Symphogear is more popular due to the former than the latter. But the former imo isn't enough to counter the latter being not so great. Yeah there's cool lore. But then what about Miku getting shafted. That's a pretty serious issue.

Nana Mizuki and Music
First episode is good.
Started Release The Spyce today.
Damn. It really is Bandori Live On Ice
Channel description says all forms of animation. So I guess so?
(Is this the right channel to discuss Chris Pratt being casted to voice Garfield)
Super Cub, Yuru Camp, MugMo.
From ANN on Oct 18 2021
While MAL was my first. It just doesn't really look as clean as AniList. Plus IIRC. MAL is involved in some NFT business and that's not okay with me.
Bad voice acting, supposedly flat characters, stiff animation, characters not remaining the same height in accordance with their background, certain characters who are apparently just [Insert thing] for the sake of [Insert thing]. Instead of having an actual character besides that
But rather as something that CR says is an anime but feels like a joke to call it that.
However from my understanding, most people don't view this as having the feel of an anime.
Even the animes lots of people like to dunk on are acknowledged as anime.
There's a difference though between "This feels like an anime" and "This is something trying to pass itself off as anime when it's not"
Rumble Granddoll OP is such a bop
ü§î
This could mean so many things.
That's some title.
Started watching the infamous horse girls anime.  Pretty good so far.
While I go look up the validity of that. I'll leave this review here of it.

https://youtu.be/dd1cuARn7zU
If they believe in their show, then backlash shouldn't affect it's release.

They waited a few years and still got backlash. People didn't forget about it.
Otherwise you would be rushing and that's gonna be viewed negatively
Delays don't necessarily mean that. But the idea behind a delay is that you want more time to fix something because it isn't quite ready to be sent out into the world yet.
There's also a difference between "Oh. Character looks a bit derpy here." and "Wow. Their legs aren't moving despite how they're supposed to be walking."
They are. But it doesn't apply to every anime.

You would kinda expect if CR is the ones pushing this out after like 4 years of waiting since it was initially announced to be a thing. It should be decent.
Good question.

I kinda like El Paso Condor
Yeah but I'm not sure there's a place that doesn't have HBOMAX in name but is HBOMAX essentially (if that makes sense).
I could be wrong though
I mean unless you have HBOMAX (or whatever international equivalent of that for Warner Bros shows is), I doubt it.
It's kinda like ATLA. Where it isn't quite anime. But the style is definitely anime.
Which was intentional.
It's in the style of anime.
It's definitely more of a character personalities that drive the show kinda thing vs a plot and deep character driven show (although there is some deep character stuff)
Lots of characters to keep track of and so I was kinda like "Who is this character? Do they matter here?"
It was fairly enjoyable. An 8/10.
Finished S1 of Suzuka and Spe-Chan totally don't have a thing for each other.
I suppose so.
Oh. Wonder Grass was kinda a neat character too
Tiger & Bunny is peak
The performances are good though.
Why this decision. Idk.
Yeah. The plot is kinda a clone of Idoly Pride.
<:miikoWat:826553819323170876>
Winning The Soul is a centaur-fied banger.
I didn't know there was cross breeding happening in Uma Musume. Shark Horse. üëÄ
Oh no. It's the mahou uma, Musume Magica
Who needs Love Live when you can have horse-dol group The Getaway Sisters
Maybe we'll get a version with the ads officially or maybe someone will rip the Netflix episodes and just add in the logos.
Ok. One teensy complaint I have with these subs is when the names are long but the text is so f**king small that I have to screenshot it and then zoom in just to actually read the name.
Helios seems like a fun character
The Musume Games are looking pretty wild this year
So the Apr 26 race is the Spring one where she loses to McQueen correct.
So if I'm getting this right.

All of Special Week's races occur after all McQueen/Teio's races.
Like Teio gets hurt and is out for a few months. From Summer to Spring is 9 months. Then Teio gets hurt again for like a month or so after the Spring Tennshou? McQueen is out for 3 months I wanna say after that race?
I did notice that. There's time leaps but I can't tell how many years have gone by or if some races take place after others.
The focus of S2 seems to be Teio/McQueen with some side stuff about the others.


I kinda assumed they'd do Vodka/Scarlet next then Goldship last I suppose (not knowing how their irl history is though)
Isn't Teio S2?
What about the other 3 members of Team Spica then? Do they have like major stories as well? Or are theirs pretty much done?
Wow. That's kinda messed up.  <:miikoWat:826553819323170876>
On the other, Silence Suzuka is hardly in this season and I feel like her racing in America sounds so interesting.
So I'm on Ep 8 of UMPD S2. On the one hand, I'm glad there's a focus on a bunch of other characters.
Gotta love how horse girls brings interest from all sorts of people
Wow. Wasn't expecting that Rice Shower moment.
There's too many horses so I usually just let the show remind me who they are.
I think this is really the first Aquatrope episode so far where I would say you aren't missing much by skipping it.
But the first cour had a strong focus on what was going on
The 2nd cour offfers more interactions between characters.
That's interesting. I wouldn't mind say...an OVA about that team and how that relationship is.
It seems like with so many characters. There's so many things they could choose to go off about. Bourbon for example had that thing about wanting to see their master smile.
It might be realistic but I think I like the less realistic aspects of UM more.
Perhaps it felt a bit repetitive that in S2 Teio lost/broken leg, McQueen lost felt a bit repetitive?
It might be because it's whatever that I liked it more.
Helios/Palmer/Rice/Bourbon/Turbo are all good characters. They have fun personalities.
Like El Condor Pasa. The whole thing about them racing in Japan and then in Europe. It kinda seems like "Woah. That's pretty cool."
Standouts?
The side characters in S2 are all pretty good. But I just think S1 makes their side characters feel more iconic?
I don't hate the characters but how should I put this.

Spica shines more overall in S1 and the other characters help make it entertaining. So I had a good time with it. Yeah it's Suzuka/Special but it doesn't feel like that the same way it does with Teio/McQueen.
But like idk.


If I'm comparing Suzuka/Special to Teio/McQueen. I prefer Suzuka/Special. At least in terms of how the main story is overall.
Yeah. Those are great moments.
Teio/McQueen aren't bad lead characters or anything.
S2 started out strong for me but as it continued. I kinda got more interested in the side stories than Teio/McQueen.
Welp. That's a wrap on S2
Wow. I didn't know America changed Suzuka so much.
So I know about them. Just was kinda wondering how they line up in with S2 was all.
I watched the OVA before S2.
Ah because there's mention of BNW in this episode and then B shows up for McQueen's race.
Does BNW take place between the 2nd and 3rd Spring Race of McQueen?
So if I were to place S1 after S2. According to you, that would mean that Teio would have been running for like 7 years at least before SW
*imo
Might end up beating S1 for me.
YuYuYu S3 is getting pretty good with today's episode
An idol anime that is kinda borrowing certain parts from another idol anime that aired in the spring.
Although it's not Yoshiako/Kasumin
They are
I agree.
Designs very good indeed
It's like you forget that this show is written by the same author as R__ until that final scene
The end though is <:miikoWat:826553819323170876>
New Assassin Episode was good.
They're related by adaptation. <:shinobuOfCulture:768736884410417162>
There's also 4 episodes left and I have no idea what the conclusion is going to be still.
Kukuru really be hurting.
New Aquatrope episode is oof.
Selection Project really took all this time just to confirm the most obvious thing.
Oh. That reminds me.
I mean it was until it wasn't unfortunately.
~~Should have been callef Ayahishi Triangle imo.~~
On Chapter 69 of all chapters? Insane.
~~There's a reason why she's called Mother Maria~~ <:MariaSunglasses:336656798687690752>
Now it's a yuri. <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
No it's really not. I'm not saying it's AOTS
Poor Man's Symphogear?


Uhhh no. That ain't it, chief. Takt Op Destiny is it's own thing and I would say most of the things it does are better than Symphogear. Which struggled every season.
Anyways, tomorrow is Aquatrope Thursday. Hoping for a good episode. <:ChrisPray:672578403156885504>
Fair enough.

Characters may not be the best in Takt and maybe I'm somehow forgetting about good fights in S1 of Symphogear. But I think I'm genuinely more invested currently in Takt than I was with at least S1 with Symphogear. So that's why I think it's better than Symphogear in some sense.
If I'm looking at as S1 v S1. I'm more inclined to give it to Symphogear at this point.
If I'm looking at Symphogear across it's 5 seasons compared to Takt's 1 season. Takt has the upper hand.
I'm saying. It's fine. I'm being entertained for 23 minutes and I'm interested in how the show will continue to play out.
To you. You want to turn it off.
Yeah but Symphogear had 5 seasons and I'd still say Hibiki isn't the most amazing mc ever.
Yeah that's the most broadest comparison though
But I don't think it's a poor man's Symphogear. Symphogear is kinda it's own thing with it's own issues.
There is no end to PreCure. It's like the Nana roulette. **There's always another one.**
See you in Feb 2022 when the new PreCure OP is out and now you have 19 choices to pick from.
Gonna feel like a waste if everyone ends up staying though.
It was a different outcome than expected for sure.
Alright folks. I wanna watch New Game. How should I go about it. Dub or Sub
Today's Mug episode was very wholesome
I won't spoil what happens. But in the latest episode. Yuga and Tiger have a duel and it's incredible.
She's good for sure.
Beautiful artwork. Really looks like a 3 headed Slifer
Exactly. Who are they? Are they related? Still unexplained at this point.
No wait. 2 arcs after that because there's the tournament arc
Ah yeah. You won't know why then until the arc after that I think.
The MC of 7s having a mom is legitimately a big plot point because it destroys a whole theory other characters have had about the MC.
I actually didn't really like VRAINS and so I've really liked Sevens so far. It's unpredictability is very entertaining.
Huh. Well I'll just start on Ep 1 since this apparent Ep 0 is RAW
Oh god. There's an Ep 0?
I'm adding it because the cursed AMQ gods won't let me go on it.
Update: They aren't done with them yet. So nvm.
But I think I can get those done by Entame as well.
The first 12-13 episodes were done by someone else before Entame came along.
That being said. There's a ton you can do even without those.
The most complex it's gotten aside from Maximums is having an extra deck mechanic (I won't mention which. Just that the Extra Deck exists in Sevens and there is a mechanic for it)
It's a different format and it's sort of meant to be a reboot for the younger kids who want to get into YGO but aren't ready for the complexity of the main game.
Just gonna drop that Yuga (the MC) has lost to 3 separate female main characters now.
Most duels are really just about chance. You can kinda predict who might win a duel in 7s. But since you can draw until you have 5 every turn. Anything can happen with those cards.
Ah. I haven't watched that one I don't think.
I'm sure Ash agrees.
cute boys running out of my cgdct anime is great.
Can't believe it took me 10 episodes to realize that it's said as "kyu-tie" and not "Nine-tie"
I was wondering why the hell the group was called "9-tie"
I'm screaming at this entire scene
It sure sounds like aquarium lesbians to me. (Even if the show won't say it is)
Unless it gets a sequel
If they're gay, I'll take it. I won't bother with whatever anime it is after it ends anyways probably.
Finally
Noragami

That's like 20 animes. You're welcome.
I'm curious. Which one is being discussed here
Hearing a Gundam show described as "It feels more like Cubix" sounds so funny to me.
For sure
Will drop spoilers after you watch the episode
I'm praying for whatever the finale is gonna bring.
<@171395487247630336> All I'll say about this episode is that you gotta watch it.
<:hsiFakiriKBlueGun:744465189608620094>
New AT episode today.

Gonna <:IbukiFist:806653657575718993> if it's not Kukuru/Fuuka being chosen because this screams the perfect chance for a wedding.
~~Nah. I'd have to be on a trampoline to have manga jiggle physics~~
Yeah but manga doesn't have jiggle physics
Oh. That one.
<:miikoWat:826553819323170876> 

Pok√©mon Master what now?
Can't wait for Aoi Yuuki to voice in another animal isekai. /lh
(Stupid crop is stupid)
When they say Gundam can't be cool. (I just learned of this western show. It's apparently supposed to be a parody of mecha anime in a sense)
I may add some fall seasonals depending on how they finish these next couple of weeks.
Let's see here AOTY huh.

Dragon Maid S2
Tsukimichi
Remake Our Life
Idoly Pride
Isekai Drugstore
Yuru Camp S2
Super Cub
Kanojo x Kanojo
Tomozaki


That's what I'd say out of the anime I've completed for 2021 atm.
I didn't know Gen and Itachi had the same VA. That's wild.
Ah yes. I remember when the Duel Cavalry club were around.
<:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
Have fun
Yeah yeah. It keeps getting more crazy.
Just you wait until the next one they pull on you.
I mean kinda? But there's also this part which kinda suggests that Fuuka x Kukuru are a thing (why else bring up gay relationships so randomly)
Stitched from the PV
Compared to this season which I was/still am watching like 13 of them
Only 7 shows next season atm.
I'm pretty sure I'm watching less next season
There's no cute girls bowling though yet. <:MaryCry:713979837936828473>
Symphogear best isekai. Shem-Ha came from the moon
They want you all to suffer just like the characters in the anime.
I literally just realized that PuraOre is if Uma Musume was about girls playing hockey instead of horse girls running
It was an ok finale.
Probably at least 50 per season. Just the Pok√©mon themselves. Not the humans.
True but ok. There's VAs for Pok√©mon right?
There's over 900 people who voice witnesses, murders, and victims in Detective Conan. Most probably aren't famous. But this implies there's no such thing having used "everyone".
Oofta
Unfortunately at a certain point you have to watch Index (at least to the end of S2 iirc) to understanding some of what's happening in Railgun. Not everything. But some of it.
I don't watch mecha very often. But if there were more like it. I would probably.
Rumble Garanndol finished today and I loved the finale. So good.
<:RengeShrug:609373443225419786>
But just based on the anime, l guess it doesn't feel like Emiya got as dumbed down or maybe it just isn't as obvious compared to Touma.
Oh ok. I mean I haven't really read either source material.
That's neat. The anime doesn't do his character well though is my point and Fate did if we're saying they're the same type of character. That's all I'm saying imo.
Yeah except I somehow am able to get behind Emiya Shirou more than Touma "The Hand" Kamijou
Especially with that banger of an opening.
I will say that S3 I kinda liked.
If you played the game than yes. You're probably right. I didn't though so I thought S1 was the best.
I understand. ü¶í
Yes
~~Scary but sexy vampires is called Kamen Rider Kiva~~
Hey. Devil is a Part-Timer is getting a S2 this year. Nothing is impossible.
It'll probably come...eventually.
It's ok.  Waiting for GuP films is like waiting for a sequel for a seasonal anime.
So true.
||Daiba "The Tiger" Nana|| <:VanessaSmug:689395769199165447>
She really don't.
Finished the movie. It was wild and exactly what you would expect out of Revue Starlight and then more.
||Yandere Mahiru is scary||
Oh s**t. Human males exist in this universe?
Can't believe the RevStar movie is so sad and so good and it's only been 18 mins so far.
GuP Das Finale Part 3: Girls in tanks continues to be entertaining as expected
It's a movie that makes sense and doesn't make sense at the same time. You understand the characters' motivations and reasons for what they're doing. You just won't understand how the hell any of settings can possibly exist. I also like the songs more in the movie.
üëÄ Yuka Iguchi voices Mako? That's a surprise.
Anyways, Girls und Horses was a fun special to watch.
It really is.
S1 OVA though
Oh wow. I love Romeo and Juliet but there's no romance and it's just the 2 families who hate each other.
But it's cute girls doing cute things and sometimes with heavy holding hands yuri undertones if you look for it.
Yeah.
Seasons or Cures themselves?

Seasons makes this 19.

Cures make this 72.

Yee.
Yuka Iguchi in PreCure real. This means Hibiki, Tsubaki, Chris, and Miku have all voiced characters in PreCure.
Anyways, can't wait to see Spuidaman next episode.
Oh. They made AgK? That explains the darker writing of a f*&ked up world where the heroes ||can die||.
Some people have a thing with feet. Others have a thing for Chris blazing them down. Just gotta accept and move on.
Lmao. 10/10 Movie Director.
Very nice. **Now start S2.**
Nobody has time to read the back of the book. So you sell it all in title.
These 7 shows, WEH, and maybe Dress Up Darling.

I'm also still watching Ousama Ranking weekly.
~~Didn't seem worth my time when I was planning on what to watch for this season~~
Oh and I also watched all of the JoJo Pt 6 eps so far. It's good.
Cue Ep 2 - It's alright. Not that exciting though.

WEH Ep 2 -  I wish the male MC didn't look so generic. That's all I'll say.

Slow Loop Ep 2 - Very wholesome step sisters fishing activity.
Now that I know it's a joke. 


I think not. <:sainou:668064892812787742>
This is now Part 2
Part 1
Miss Kuroitsu Ep 2 - I see Wolf and just think "Omg. It's Chris from Symphogear". Jokes aside. A very enjoyable episode.
||Best moment was when Jeanne asked Souma if Liscia wanted to become queen so Souma could come to the empire and possibly have a child with her sister||
Realist Hero S2 Ep 2 - all the comments are like "I don't get this boring political talk". Yet I found it pretty understandable for the most part and enjoyable.
Might be indeed
I just decided to look at the spring season for anime and so this what I have down. I'm only watching like 8 new animes this season. But next season? At least 16 of these.
Probably
Gear has canon gay but there are less pairings with the main cast (I think). Plus, Gear doesn't really pit the characters against each other because they're gay for each other compared to RevStar imo.
It's gotta be RevStar.
If no official subs, then it's back to fansubs. <:YumiPoint:688429724103344164>
Well there's still about 2 weeks until the end of TroPre and 3 weeks until DePaPre starts. So we'll see.
I do kinda wonder about Number 1's backstory now that we know about the other two though.
WEH Ep 3 - Oh. So there's some psychological stuff to this totally-not-an-h anime. Certainly makes it more worth investing than that other show I previously watched that can't be named here.
ü¶í
Weakest Crest Ep 3: Well god damn. I love Mattias as an op MC. There is some fast pacing but I'm living for it.
Lmao @ this comment
I can't believe Akebi essentially said "send nudes" and then actually got "nudes" 

(Which in this case was just a photo of the class president with her skirt lifted up and no blazer essentially)
Nothing says ~~possible~~ yuri more than asking  another classmate if they can lift up their skirt so you can see more of their pretty legs.

Bad but memorable for the wrong reasons. So somewhat of a positive image.
They really will just greenlight almost anything over in JP huh
The forbidden romance between 7 **what now** <:miikoWat:826553819323170876>
Popular VAs are popular. <:RengeShrug:609373443225419786>
Gear has other problems. But the episodes themselves don't tend to waste time on their own yeah. (You could make the argument that certain episodes stringed together made a waste of time though)
Don't know who. Probably people who thought it was acceptable at the time or wanted to advertise it to a very particular demographic.
So not only is this a H-orney anime. It's something that was already allowed as a manga.
WEH Ep 4 - Ok. So he's kinda aware that he's being used. More importantly though, I learned that the anime is an adaptation of the manga.
Strike the Blood huh
There's the path of watching StrikerS and stopping there too.

~~Such a shame Nanoha only had 3 seasons~~
Nobody knows yet apparently
Huh.
Oh wow. Shadow The Hedgehog's waifu?
I guess that matters a bit
Oh yeah.
You can watch the movies after As yeah. I don't recall the As film having any large important canon ties to the movies following it.
Oh yeah. Big PreCure fan. I only put one season there in my favorites because I wanted to be fair and try not to repeat a season from the same series if possible.
I hadn't considered adding Favorites before. So here's something.
IIRC her friends know she's a mahou shoujo too which was definitely not a thing in the As TV canon?
/hj
If Trigger saved anime. Then why isn't there a Comic Girls 2. <:TsubasaAngry:692141154531016765>
Have fun with your nightmares
New Akebi episode is out
Honestly I'm having a hard time watching New Game atm. Haven‚Äôt felt motivated to watch it past Ep 4 or so for a couple of weeks now.

I don't hate CGDCT but something about New Game so far isn't giving me the feeling like I need to watch it all asap.
But nah. Gotta give it all to JJK/AOT/KnY
Oh it can. Healin Good also should have counted for this since it finished airing many months ago. Even Tropical-Rouge technically can count considering Ousama Ranking is in the nominations despite the show still airing right now.
I'm assuming this was in relation to the midseason Cure leak. If not, mb. Ignore the ping.
That's just leak culture in general
She would travel there for Miku though. <:RitsuFingerGuns:580283465245786132>
Biki wouldn't travel to the Phillipines for bananas.
New Leadle ep happened. The show continues to be hilarious
You don't understand. Lolis make the best teachers in the Indexverse clearly. <:VanessaSmug:689395769199165447>
Well I mean he's only a first year anyways right?
It'll end when Touma finally graduates from high school
(Joking ofc but when they do actually fight it does look good imo)
Dragon Maid is a shonen. The battles of everyday life are so good. That's why it's a 10/10. /lh
Naruto had a great ending. All you have to do is stop before Boruto exists.
Gundam but it's Kamen Rider
https://twitter.com/nory20212/status/1494707168725336066?t=UMm8iQQquogMKP3GcfELKA&s=09
It's just too damn wholesome and funny.
I think Slow Loop might be my AOTS.
Akebi continues to influence other girls at her school to do things they normally wouldn't consider doing.
Can't wait for Initial J
Just gotta replace the horses with cars
VRAINS was all about being dark and I'm gonna be honest. That was it's downfall.
<:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
I mean to each their own. It is somewhat subjective and I am slightly kidding because I'm aware of some things regarding Utena that would make it gay despite me not having seen the show.
But Utena is certainly up there.
Bandori probably
and RevStar. Love Live.
Idk. I mean Akebi exists.
New Akebi episode is out. The end part is too f**king cute for my heart to handle.
Yeah but less people have probably heard of floppy disks than VHS tapes
If you all think VHS is old. Wait until you hear about floppy disks
<:MikuCute:672908542763859968> 

What a lovely 3ple.
<@171395487247630336>
I don't think any Pok√©mon manga has run long enough to hit over 1000 chapters
"One Piece has more chapters than any other shonen anime"


*Laughs in Detective Conan being at 1088 chapters*

Yuu as well
A 1M long Ayumu Neso apparently
<@171395487247630336>
https://twitter.com/LoveLive_staff/status/1499573594300424192?t=OExPCzJ5i7eUy9uxkRYMRA&s=09
üëÄ
Hayasaka/Chika sail?
With Lietudant Sanders as the face of their company clearly.
New Akebi episode has everyone's favorite mall food restaurant. Louisiana Fried Chicken.
Probably Toy Story 2.
It's funny that (Nan)oh(a) wasn't voiced by Nana
Akebi showed up and now all of the sudden she's got half the class *interested* in her.
Slow Loop continues the wholesome funny ~~possible slight yuri~~ greatness.
Then they get revived at the end of the season though. So it's all ok.
People die when they lose a life or death stakes duel.
I've heard good things about it. Maybe I'll get around to it eventually.
I enjoyed DXD more....aside from the latest season.
Gear has issues across it's 5 seasons that I can't really ignore. It's not really my kinda show
Just not all the episodes. So I'm indifferent towards them.
I've seen GX and 5Ds episodes before
Haven‚Äôt watched imo means I haven't seen them at all or only like 1-2 episodes of them.
VRAINS was pain staking to sit through almost every week.
So I'm indifferent towards them
5Ds and GX I haven't really sat down to watch.
Muses are apart of mythology. Revue is really good. 

The rest I can explain if necessary.
Because the spirits are from another world. 

But yeah. It isn't quite the same
Technically it's a reverse isekai?
Not only is that the movie. That's the show too. But instead of 2 hours it's more like 4-6 hours.
Maybe after they go through all of Digimon and Symphogear.

So...5 years.
She is definitely kind and caring ~~except that's just a facade...or is it?~~  <:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
My tastes vary wildly. But it has CGDCT in it. So that's partially why it's in there.
Brb. Gonna run my list.

From 2019. BokuBen, Quintessential Quintuplets, Shield Hero, Bookworm, Kaguya-sama.

From 2020. My Next Life As A Villianess, Kuma Kuma Kuma Bear, D4DJ, Bofuri, Wandering Witch, Love Live Nijigasaki

For 2021. Tsukimichi, I've been killing slimes for 300 years, Remake our life,  Drug Store isekai, Aquatrope, Deep Insanity, Bottom Tier Character Tomozaki, Rumble Garanndol, LBX Girls, and  Super Cub.
Akebi Ep 12 was amazing. So sad to see it be done.
Just watched Excutioner Ep 1. I'm on board for whatever trip this is going to end up being.
They looked pretty good imo
Oh that is a great anime. I really loved the finale.
The MV is a banger. I literally have it on repeat for at least the past hour.
2 more days IIRC
It isn't
Thank you Carlos. I agree with this rating and it should be said more often.
It's a tie between As and StrikerS.
It's out on the yar har sites now.

Just watched the first episode. It's not quite CGDCT. But it's a golf story involving girls.
Tomodachi Game episode 1. 

Kanade is back but now she's the Monokuma of this anime.
Could be. The main one is an alchemist.
<@171395487247630336> Another CGDCT to add to your PTW
https://twitter.com/myanimelist/status/1512234033413074949?t=Bxsn2Kh8un5JYfwULEqI7w&s=09
Dawn of the Witch. 


Somehow this opening is so good I thought it was May'n at first because it reminded me of Accel World. But it's actually fripSide.
Hmmm...that first episode was decent.

Really wish it didn't start with *that scene* though.
I mean the town in RPG Real Estate does look like GochiUsa.
There's still 3 or 4 more animes I need to see.
A s**t ton. 

So far I'd say Birdie Wing, Shikimori, Love After World Domination, and The Executioner and Her Way of Life.

Maybe Healer Girl and Tomodachi Game too.

At least in terms of non sequels.
Mahoutsukai, Star Twinkle, Suite, and Yes5.
It's just like stealing the Declaration of Independence. Very easy if you have the right skills. <:YumiPoint:688429724103344164>
This very cool Yakuza Leader wants to become a magical girl. What an inspiration.
Tbf, a cast of 16 main characters is hard to get behind when they all fully haven't been established yet.
That's also fair
I say almost because there are quite a few female competitors as the OP implies and who knows how they'll interact with our main two
Birdie Wing Ep 2. I think Aoi/Eve is now a thing and you almost can't convince me otherwise.
It took years to do all 3 routes
Ufo-Tax says "Look how much money Fate gave us"
So this is what happened after Sunshine ended huh
<:aoithink:523903834368507916>
I don't think Shikimori is a great anime. It's a cute romance but Shikimori herself is not best girl.
<:manabiwhy:743950152770781247>
Birdie Wing probably gonna be AOTS if this keeps up
The episode was great.
<@171395487247630336> The birdie ~~gay~~ gals
Ayahi singing is cool. But I'm sorry to say that an anime needs more than that to convince me to watch it.
I was planning on dropping Healer Girl after Ep 3 if the show didn't impress me. But that episode was super comedic.
So essentially. Akari and Menou? Yeah that's yuri.
Love After World Domination Ep 3. What a beautiful ~~and lewd episode~~.
Shirabe but she's taller than Kirika
Kaguya-sama S3 Ep 3.  In this world, the perception of what is right and wrong is very warped.
Between seeing not-IT and Shikimori playing not-Wii Sports
The episode was pretty funny
Peak action.
The cover got better as it went on but I'm not quite convinced it's as good as the original song. In terms of covers, I liked Studio Alf's better.

**The who and the what now** <a:MikuQuake:605209236082786355>
https://twitter.com/AniTrendz/status/1518789210005667841?t=6JEkCeIxhBLszAO1B9QD6A&s=09
Golf Girls Story Ep 4 is up
I don't know anything about Gundam. But for a movie coming out this year. The poster kinda makes it seem older?
https://twitter.com/AniTrendz/status/1519126684791889921?t=AvIU1ewxPuZJZK-3FQ-gbA&s=09
I mean the vampire lady sure wants to get it on with Eve ~~in a somewhat creepy vampire way~~ but if it counts, it counts I suppose.
Plastic Memories is a great one too imo.
Super Cub
I just finished Houkago no Plieades the other day. It was good. I'd recommend it.
For this season or just in general? <:rinkuTriesToThink:774289672079671317>
I must admit. It's odd hearing everyone's favorite Fate/ priest in  DAL.
Nah. They're a main deck function. You take 3 monster cards that are like individual pieces of a monster and you summon them all at once. If you do, they combine to form a Maximum. Each piece has a different effect but it's still considered one monster
Isn't that enough?
I'm currently multitasking. But you just got recommended like 30 different animes to try out
Darker Than Black was pretty cool
This episode so far is just Shizuku describing a yuri doujin under the disguise that it's the story for a play
SetsuAyu real
<:this:647197773044645888>
<:YouWaitWhat:324453637143396362>

Here's not that but still AyumYuu
Shuzuku essentially wrote a whole gay scenario in the latest episode.
Oh out of every huh
Interesting
Genjuro had a brother? <:HibikiWhat:336656482907193344>
There isn't. It's just me messing with Ash because they're always hoping for Comic Girls S2. But on the possibility that it does end up happening, I didn't want to say S2 and then Uma Musume global still isn't a thing by then. So I said S3 instead this time.
It's coming up right after Comic Girls S3
You need the car for when you get into your next interest, Intial D
One is an isekai. The other is SciFi (I suppose?)
Having your mind go to VR only to be stuck there is different from "I'm apart of VR itself and I can't go back"
SAO isn't even an isekai by what most people would view isekai as. So CBR already incorrect regardless of who's on the list.
Today's Kaguya-sama ep puts Eminem to shame
The Niji anime also has a lot more of the girls from SIF.
Since Muse and Aquors aren't in the Niji anime at all.
I mean Nijigasaki is a more like a loose adaptation of SIFAS.
The way the sub units come together is a bit different too.
Tbf, I think the anime and the game are going about the characters in different ways. Lahnzu is a lot less in your face for example. Shioriko isn't against school idols. She's just ok with them.
It's not supposed to be taken as real. But also who's to really say that it isn't. That's the beauty of RevStar.
Funny small girl and hot spy mom.
Yeah yeah. The OP isn't that great.
It does seem a bit rushed.
That could be it.
But <:HibikiThink:688429715362414641>
It's still a good mostly wholesome show
Something about Bookworm S3 just hasn't been hitting the same way as the previous 2 seasons and I can't figure out what it is
The show itself is ok. But probably not worth anyone's time.
That's the general consensus I'm pretty sure.
No. It does not look good. The eye designs are weird.
Trapped in a Dating Sim as a Mob Character?
Oh god. That LN art looks straight out of a doujin.
I agree with this.
Btw, this is how my scores look.

Most shows I give a 7 or an 8.

5 is bearable. 4 and below is "God. I hated this."
I mean it depends on how bad the show is. If it's Ex-Arm, fair enough. If it's just regular "1-3 episode rule for seasonal trash", I'll probably disregard it because it's not worth taking into account 100%. Shows can start out terrible and get better as they continue or vice-versa. You can't be 100% certain unless you see through to the end.
Yeah. Some things are a little head scratching. Which you just have to chalk up to it being anime 101.
It was mostly good. Like an 8.5/10
I started and finished Flip Flappers today
I've been to maid cafes at certain conventions before. It's a decent experience.
<@171395487247630336> How "gay" would you consider Eve ||naming one of her rainbow bullets "Aoi"|| (Birdie Wing Ep 7 spoilers)
That and some other things.
How do I explain this without spoilers.

The post credits scene takes this anime to a whole new level of "this is a golf **anime**"
Today's Birdie Wing episode was interesting.
Lesbian vampire you say? <:TsubasaNote:689554460044820608>
"It's like Symphogear but everyone is a different colored Tsubasa"
Patiently waiting for an anime called 7 Tragic Heroines where all 7 MCs are voiced by the great Nana.
Most people are not ok. This is a fact of life after all.
Among Us
Flip Flappers was a good anime. Could have been slightly better though imo.
You're thinking too short. Shinai BluRay when
Dimension W apparently
Wait really? <:kurumiNaruhodo:768737459050905623>
Chris but in a size more convenient for being picked up. Travel size Chris.
~~That and AniList says this is 74% yuri~~
Picking this one up because I don't want mix this one up with Persona in AMQ anymore.
Today's anime that I'm starting is Princess Principal. <:decade_violence:797591054710472755>
To be somewhat serious though, yeah. You watch GuP for the meme more so than any plot
Wdym I'm not supposed to watch GuP for the short Russian and cute American girl.
Tomorrow I'll be starting another anime and depending on how much I like that one. I may return to New Game S1 after it.
It's a fun show. Nothing really wrong with it. It just doesn't reach the same high that others shows I've watched have.
Finished Princess Principal. 7.5/10
Shoutout to Alice. Gotta be one of my favorite character personas.
<:ChrisBang:702166093065748500>
The tanks are from the 2000s, the story takes place there though
Well certainly 2000s.
European Industrial Revolution spies and modern day tank enthusiasts. The perfect combo
Reading a little bit on Princess Principal. Ofc GuP had an in game collab with them.
I don't know if it's more insane that the match continued after that reveal last episode or that ||Rose did actually die to the mafia|| at the end of the episode.
New Birdie Wing episode came out
Is it really a good read/watch if the girls aren't kissing
So true
Kaguya-sama Ep 8 - Here we go. The plot is kicking in.
So what I'm saying is. SAO I and SAO III are 2 different shows kind of, sort of, almost
SAO III is also a lot less "this is a game and s*@t happens" and more "This is a reality and s#@ happens"
Like ok. SAO I? Sure you can harp on it. SAO II? I don't think it was that bad. SAO III? A few things could have been better. But there's an entire arc where Kirito does nothing. If you tell me that arc is bad, then your problem with the show wasn't Kirito.
I think SAO gets better with each arc imo ~~and I also pretend that Fairy Dance Arc never happened~~.
Finished Ep 1. The animation has like a nostalgic 2000s vibe to me for some reason. Which I like. 

Nothing immediately grabbing me to watch more but we'll see how it goes.
Finally starting Strike Witches
~~Once Symphogear XV is announced, I sure hope they get PreCure~~ <:ChrisPray:672578403156885504>
Depends on who's supplying them
Oh wait. The radio girl is 14 and the MC is 15
Sakamoto is 20. That's all that's for sure known.
It is certainly hard to know the ages. Most of them seem underage but how the hell should I know.
Finished Strike Witches S1. Pretty good imo. Feels like a weird in-between with the horny. But I do like the characters.
Strike Witches Ep 5. Things sure got gay quickly in this episode <:MikuGay:336656810788388864> <:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
Is golf gay? With this latest episode, I believe it certainly can be.
Just watched Birdie Wing Ep 9.
I prefer when they lean on the comedy personally. Although there was seriousness in S1 for me to enjoy as well
~~I don't recall any memorable VAs in VRAINS aside from the MC being the same VA for Gotou from Dress Up Darling~~
Kenn in GX
Kensho Ono in A5
YGO has quite the interesting roster of VAs
It gets a bit more gay this episode. Eve wants that match so badly she'll play it nude next to Aoi.  <:MikuGay:336656810788388864>
Finished Strike Witches S2. Not as good as the first season but it was alright. 7/10
I mean that makes sense I suppose. Since like with DC, Season 17 could be mostly Anime Originals and there wouldn't really be anything that makes it different from the prior season other then the manga cases adapted
So Shippuuden is S2 and Boruto is S3? <:kurumiNaruhodo:768737459050905623>
I was about to say 400 Episodes is like the majority of the show
Tbf Dress Up Darling aired in the same season as AOT
She's in a very twisted way compassionate.
I did like that Manon Libelle's entire character is ||wanting to be seen as worth being killed because she couldn't die with her mother when Flare was there all those years ago||
Although that perhaps may have made the "gory" part of the episode less crazy seeming to me.
The new excutioner episode was good. I certainly still wasn't expecting that plot twist despite reading the spoiiers on here before watching the episode.
S**t Shaft is doing that one? I already had it on my PTW. But now I'm even more interested in it.
S1 was Gonzo
S2 was AIC Spirits
The OVAs were Silver Link
Movie was AIC
RtB is done by david productions
It sure says something that every animation project in this storyline was done by a different studio
Finally got to Strike Witches: Road To Berlin
Symphogear but they each represent a sin
See you all in 2030 when the One Piece finally ends
It's gayer in the theaters for sure
Took Fangiko to go see the RevStar Movie tonight in theaters. Daiba Nana was once again a Dai Banana.
RtB Ep 7. Oppai = Magic Power
Most of the season hasn't been great. The latest episode was good because s**t actually happened.
New Birdie Wing Ep dropped. Eve continues to be top tier gay.
Gonna attempt to finish New Game next. Then I'll pick up Brave Witches.
Finished Road To Berlin. It was decent. They technically left the door open for at least another sequel if they really wanted to go there. Although I feel like it'd be a bit of a gamble to do so.
I see it and I am in pain (not really)
Today's Kaguya-sama episode. Disturbingly funny.
He's gonna jump into the pool. Now it's a kids show again
I think Birdie Wing counts as yuri imo
I haven't watched Konosuba in awhile. So maybe my opinion would change but I still don't think it's that bad. There's worse parody animes.
Konosuba is not either therefore it's ok
Isekai Smartphone is also bad
Simply put. AOT S3 Part 2 (or whatever part it was in the Winter) wasn't really favored among fans. So it can be considered terrible.
For people who only watch big anime, it's the equivalent of AOT S3 PART 2
But at least it's not "In Another World With My Smartphone"
Konosuba is good. Not the best show out there
I watched Machikado Mazoku S1. Wasn't a fan. Picked up S2 a couple episodes ago because I heard about the spoiler regarding Momo. Liking the show more now.
Ah wait. I forgot that CBR doesn't watch anime to begin with.
SoL anime has forgettable soundtracks? Gee idk. If the music is relaxing, isn't that good enough, CBR
Finished the new Birdie Wing episode. A good time as always.
Yes
How can it not be a 10/10. It's got Daiba Nana in it
ü¶í
||The train will arrive at it's next station without fail. Then what about the stage? What about us?||

What a line.
BUT YOU MUST
Gotta love fighting over a girlfriend.
Gotta love when the movie recapped ||The Olympics||.
Art is amazing
ü¶í I understand.
I took my Shioriko neso as well.
2nd time seeing the movie (after originally seeing it on my phone some months ago)
Oh I went to see it at a theater
Oh really? I disliked it more than S1 and S2. Too much Church talk.exe
Boom Boom I Love Pretty Girls indeed
If it's got cute girls in it, it's probably going on my list. <:rinkuHype:768395535597305866>
25 shows. 5 less than what I was watching until about a week ago.
Here's what I've got.
I think it's fine in F/0 because it's more integral to the plot from the start.

Whereas the church stuff kinda started in S2 but really went full nose dive in with S3.
July 2nd I think
I didn't think of it that way when watching the episode. But when you put it that way, it's certainly messed up.
Finally The Executioner and Her Way of Life is over. 7/10.

It was an alright show overall. I think I preferred the first half compared to the 2nd half though.
No. What Ash was talking about and what Illindus was talking about are 2 different shows. Nobody talks about Kaguya-sama that deeply on here.
Continuing with New Game again. I too wish to spend my weekend watching a ~~parody~~ Carranger live show.
Same
~~The Momo is more of likeable character than Akari show~~
Dark mode is only good on Discord
Well you know how it is. OVAs, Specials, Movies, things I was going to watch but then never got to, things I think might be a bit risque to say that I watched publicly, sequels with no solid release date announced yet, then there's the 30 shows or so I'm watching next season, and then there's actually stuff I'm planning to watch when I'm in the mood for something new to fill up my time.
Between all my lists, I have currently 666 entries.
<:TsubasaNote:689554460044820608> 

Hmmmm...I am considering watching New Game S2. But not yet. I need a break. I've got 3 shows that are on my agenda and I need to complete at least 1 of them or start and finish the other 2. After those though, probably New Game S2.
Overall I give it a 7.5/10
Finished New Game S1. I started this show back in late 2021 apparently. Sure is funny that I only got to 3 episodes and then stopped.
At this point I can say it's a good CGDCT ~~with a hint of yuri ofc~~ but it's not absolutely blowing me out of the water.
1 more episode of New Game to go
A whole hour of peak comedy
So I'd have to read the LNs huh.

Is the art at least any good in the manga?
Sssh. Let us pretend anyways. It's not going to hurt anyone.
There's no manga for the ~~MenoMomo~~ Virgin Road anime, right?
I agree. Abs princess do be looking pretty fine.
Something's missing I think maybe.
*imo
~~She's Miss Boobalicious for a reason.~~

She comes off as clumsy ditz that's friendly horny for Menou but it isn't really a fun "clumsy ditz" to watch.
<:yukaHmph:803195471614705684> Well f**k. Maybe if Ash reads far enough I'll try it out too
She wants to be the next Miyazaki!
She just wants Jurassic Park to be a reality. An innocent little wish to have.
She's a special child, So she gets a special font clearly that's how it works.
Oh yeah. Beyblade counts too.
Is fishing a sport? I suppose so in a way.
Just learned that Slow Loop is apparently a sports anime
*Keeps waiting for NGNL S2* /hj
Tomodachi Game finished today. Praying that we get a S2
At the very least. There's no het excuse from Aoi's side.
<@171395487247630336> I think you should catch up to Birdie Wing now. I'm considering this extremely gay.
Excuse my horny self for this. But I think the chest size of certain characters may have changed too. That or it's that the 2D animation changes how I'm seeing them.
I mean I know the RT show has a JP Dub with the exact same VAs. I just had never heard them before now.
It felt a bit odd to be hearing JP VAs speak for the characters for the first time too.
I just finished watching the first episode of the RWBY anime. It's been a long time since I saw RWBY Vol 1. So far I think the anime is following along similar to the RT show. Although I also feel like some things may have been added as I don't recall them happening.
I thought the visuals were better than last season
https://twitter.com/AniTrendz/status/1540365741404278790?t=JoWn-pVN9lkERA5IHq3a6g&s=09
It is but we're getting another season.
Excutioner is so last week Ash. This week it's all about Kaguya-sama. /lh
Yeah next week. Not tomorrow
Which they aren't checking their Twitter account
Unless RT is planning to announce the next Volume's release date tomorrow
They have more traffic than RT overall I'd bet.
So if you want to legally start the show without paying for CR, this is probably it
In about 14 hours, those episodes are going to be free on YouTube it seems.
Finished.  It sure is an interesting first 3 episodes. I'll give it that.
I'm doing my best not to drop spoilers since I don't recall everything.
Instead it just kinda jump cuts and I'm just like "Well okay then."
But the 2 characters fighting though. I would have wanted to see that again.
They skipped the bay fight. That's surprising.
<:think:457717846105915403>
I don't think ||Sun Wukong or Penny|| showed up this early in the RT Show.
I do not recall such a plot in Vol 1 of the show or any volume for that matter
Watching Episode 3 now. Okay. This is definitely different from the RT show.
I also don't think that a certain character that showed up was in the RT show.
Just finished Episode 2. It was interesting. I can't say it was necessarily better than RT show. I'm hooked though.
Illegally just search for "The Demon Girl Next Door" or "Machikado Mazoku" on any yar har site.
I think it's legally available on Hidive.
Lilo & Stitch x Fast&Furious when. It's all about the family after all.
Scan2Go, Tai Chi Chasers, Kenichi
Exactly
Birdie Wing is secretly just Bandai Namco advertising
It's very insane.
See. I actually did watch that before Birdie Wing
They're robbing us of golf until January 2023. <:WHYYYYYYYYYY:772145728319520818>
https://twitter.com/birdiewing_golf/status/1541805435337879552?t=dQTmarhtsafs6ZlMqWn3ig&s=09
I think a fair amount of people have probably seen it but it is kinda an older show. So it definitely feels like I'm the only one.
Of these only School Live would probably really count as CGDCT. But well...there's a reason why it's kinda popular.
I don't remember what tf happened in that anime. All I know is that I watched in high school.
Gonna add School Live,  and Darker Than Black to this, plus Grimoire of Zero, Pandora Hearts, C - Control, and The Girl In Twilight.
Uhh...possibly? One I watched as an Arabic dub, one I watched as an English dub on TV years ago, and the other is definitely not a CGDCT anime
(I'm aware Gundam has it's ups and downs)
As in the price will cost you ten years of work/10 figures. /j
Every Gundam is a 10/10
Shamiko truly is a Shadow Mistress. <:marikaWakaru:770957475569598505>
It's gonna be hard to top Birdie Wing gay. But it's certainly possible.
(Now watch me get destroyed for saying Chris singing wasn't an important part of Symphogear)
Let's say Symphogear was an anime adaption and in the manga, they don't show Chris singing in that contest. The anime does. Technically this change doesn‚Äôt really add anything. But it's just a change that perhaps adds more to the show. It makes her character more memorable.
Well yes
Yeah. There's not much for Fall right now.
Winter has Don't Sus Me, Nagatoro S2 though
Which means whatever comes after Ep 24 won't be out for at least another 3 months after it drops on Netflix
And it won't air on TV in Japan until October 7th IIRC
JoJo Part 6 Eps 13-24 coming to a Netflix jail near you September 1st
Yeah I love Eva. Eve v Aoi. 

As in Birdie Wing.‚õ≥
Solo Leveling is gonna get overlooked by like the 10 other shows CR is going to announce for 2023.
CopiumSaw Man
For some reason I thought there were only 12. But turns out I was right.
It is a fun ep. I like the OP too
Teppen has 15 exclamation marks because there are going to be 15 characters. /j
Yeah it's a pretty tame slime isekai
Where's the train with 2 rocket fists though
ü¶í
I also think think his unluckyness gets less extreme over the course of the season so far
It may be exaggerated in Shikimori for the sake of anime. But I don't think it's like worth analyzing if there's magic involved
It's probably just coincidence?  There are unlucky people that exist irl
How far did you watch by chance?
Shikimori was the one of the worst for you? Really?
Also this. They definitely exist.
It's not like anything he does makes him unlucky and he does try to work around his unluckiness.
Did you watch "My Stepmom's Daughter is My Ex" Ep 1?
"Oh. Tropical-Rouge PreCure? Yeah I'll finish it eventually."

"15 new seasonal animes for me to watch? Sign me up"
Me too.
Finally.
Like if we consider Oreimo to be the bottom of the barrel (which knowing how many anime exists, it probably isn't).  My Sister Is My Ex (as I like to call it because it's easier) is like middle of the road I guess.
It's surprisingly enjoyable trash so far.
(Couldn't find the giraffe gif. So this will do)
It's fine.
Our ruler Shamiko <a:HibikiBean:689194152864645128>
If I didn't know this was an AW cover. I would thought it was an Index one.
S3 is a weird mix of some new stuff, some prequel stuff, and then stuff from in-between the seasons IIRC
If you like night wallpapers, it's good. Otherwise, it's not that great imo.
I may just have to add "animes that Hatsune Miku appears in" into my PTW list
She carries green onions around. I can believe that leading to kendo.
Commander
<@99695384296701952> Apparently YT has decided that I needed to see Hatsune Miku from Shinkalion now.
(I recall hearing some stuff about the Faiz novel that I'm pretty sure was written by Inoue and well.. let's just say he typically doesn't treat his female characters well if true)
Hopefully this is Inoue on a leash and not Inoue gone wild.
It's not the only but it's one of the best imo
~~Inb4 next time they announce the Symphogear Shinais for BD~~
Now you can have all of them in your home eventually.
https://twitter.com/discotekmedia/status/1553560941920301056?t=l3S0LMr3TWWNKVH4X8qNLg&s=33
Lmao.
~~Strike Witches but kinda better in some ways is more like it~~
I just had it sitting in my PTW collecting dust
I just finished it finally.
Yes
Currently watching that one gay flying witches show that isn't the more well known one or the new one
LBX Girls
Anything Fate/ that I've seen
Summer Wars
Yuki Yuna perhaps as well
GuP probably qualifies for good CG
Depends. If we mean fully CG. Then it's going to be D4DJ. Partly CG, I'd have to take a look at my list and see.
It's got cute girls with guns and cool fights. It's what people latch on to.
Damn. 25 episodes for Cross Ange? Guess it's going to have to wait a bit longer.
Save yourself from questioning reality by going with Bloom into You or LL S2
I do love girls piloting robots
I may check this out.
Either that or my nostalgic memories of 2000s/2010s anime are misleading me to think they sounded better than the majority of today's dubs.
Not really through fault of the VAs. But it just feels like it's generally missing something.
I don't know how to describe this but usually imo most dubs feel a bit empty compared to the sub.
I actually watched this clip today and I genuinely think this dub based on the clip really gets it right.
Should have seen it coming and yet I didn't.
Cross Ange Ep 1 - *Oh.* **Oh. It's this kinda anime huh.** <:ElsaWhat:689195325621141505>
Started Cross Ange just now. I was like "Wow this looks pretty good for an anime that's "old". I wonder when it came out?" It's 2014. It's also done by Sunrise which immediately explains the Tiger & Bunny/Code Geass vibes I got from the robots and character designs.
Oh. I'm not concerned about the blood. It's an anime that involves politics. There was gonna be blood.
Finished it. 6.5/10

On the one hand. The action is very cool. The characters are enjoyable.

On the other hand, too much f#ked up s*t in this show putting aside the whole norma v humans thing. You got multiple Rs. You've definitely got sa in there. 

The show is also like super horny and has certain characters in beds a lot it feels.
Ridiculous shot.

"We interupt your women piloting mechas and ||flying as dragons|| to bring you an entire sports competition episode"
Finished Cross Ange Episode 12. Holy s**t. So much happened and yet it doesn't feel rushed or jam packed at all.
They definitely hinted at it ||FangJoker and W Extreme||.
I don't really recall what happened in the show. That has not been an issue for me when watching Fuuto PI
Let me ease your concerns. I watched W like 3-4 years ago.
^
Yeah. It's interesting.
Probably not unless you're able to be like "This is Love Live and this is GuP. They're both about a group of girls participating in an activity but they're very different in what the activity is and that's a ok because I like both of those things."
Probably. But I mean I already had Luminous Witches on my PTW list before I even started Strike Witches. I like comfy shows with a mostly female cast. They're idols too? Ok. I'm in. That's all I needed to know at the time.
You've been out of the loop. There's an OVA, a movie, and a S3 for Strike Witches.
No no no.
The latest episode confirmed it
It helps.
Maybe they're trying to do a halfway point.

I mean you don't really need to see Strike Witches to watch Brave Witches. You don't really need to see either to watch Luminous Witches.
If I wanted lewd witches, there are certainly sites that can accomplish that. It doesn't need to be in the show itself.
Luminous Witches so far is good. It's comfy. I'm enjoying the characters and the songs. 

Yeah sure Witches has been very much about the "big melons and underpants shots/angles" But that's also distracting when you actually want to focus on what's happening.

So props to Luminous Witches for giving their characters pants and not really being lewd about it.
Brave Witches is a season that needed to be like 18 episodes so the characters could be explored more. They're not really Strike clones but there isn't enough to say they're all fully developed characters like the Strike Witches are.
Strike Witches is neat. But in a sense is a lot and kinda doesn't need to be.
I am watching it.
Sunrise loves idols and robots
Tbf, Yuno is like hardly in StrikerS.
Watching IM@S Xenoglossia. Love Yayoi here.
The latest one yeah
Yes
Finished this one. I'm learning between Cross Ange and this one that most mecha shows have a weird plot going on somewhere.
No way is the entire theater going to be filled
It's true. Anime films do not come out often enough and so when you go to a theater to see one. You may get like 20-40 people if you're really lucky.
üáº Now that's what I call hype.
It'll probably happen again for S5
Tbf, might as well get used to stuido hopping
So clearly it's Biki and somewhere in between Tsubasa and Miku
You have block protagonists who's really good at the unexpected but is goofy. Then you have the straight and serious counter that tries to keep them in check.
^
*BTW I don't think Batman Ninja ever made it to US theaters.
Unless the anime film is something like Batman Ninja where it's a Batman movie. So it requires no knowledge to really go in and see.
Let's put it this way. AOT S3 part 2 is still AoT S3
It's gonna take another 26 weeks for the 3rd part to come out. So imo there's no point in doing it week by week. Just rip the band-aid off and move on.
The art style looks familiar-ish
https://tenor.com/view/cr1tikal-penguinz0-meme-woo-yeah-baby-gif-19316511
^
Not that I know of? But I only watched the episodes I think
Yes.
The movies are a prequel to S1.
New Fuuto Pi episode dropped.
Oh finally possible news on the new im@s?
There we go
Not the sunglasses guy. He's alright. I meant the one that hangs with Mugino.
Even uhh...what's his face. The blonde guy that Touma punched once if I recall correctly.
He smokes, he's got a fire demon (I think?). Already hooked. 

[I'd actually argue that a lot of anime Index's characters are more appealing or interesting than anime Touma]
Yeah
Red hair
Yeah. Railgun anime is the easier to get into. Things are explained, they make sense, you can get behind the characters, you can get behind the action.


When you make Touma look as appealing as Index Shanks (who's name I've forgotten) then I'd probably be more interested in Touma.
But from an outsider perspective anime wise. One sounds more appealing than the other. Girl who could lose and has electricity powers vs man with a hand for negating things and seems 1 dimensional.
Well no s**t he isn't. I'm sure the author knows that invincible characters aren't exactly appealing.
I said **more of**. Guy who negates things vs electricity manipulation.  1 sounds more like it's not an insta win.
Railgun on the other hand. BiriBiri is more of a normal person. She's more relatable. Which means it's easier to get behind her character in fights.
You see Index can't explain things properly. Guy who just negates stuff with his hand doesn't sound very interesting when it comes to fights. It sounds...predictable in a way. The anime doesn't give enough to make you care about Touma.
SAO requires you to have read reincarnated as a sword first. How can the sword get an art degree online? It has to be reincarnated first. <:YumiPoint:688429724103344164>
Also Aya. You're supposed to play the FSN visual novel before starting Nanoha because that has Fate in it.
If you want to understand things at a certain point, you'll have to watch Index. But I think you can at least watch S1 and be ok?
Ah right.
Index 4 means Railgun U and/or Accelerator S2 [which I kinda doubt more than the other two]
If it makes JC Staff money, they'll do Index 4.
A plot device almost. She has a personality so it's not completely nothing. But idk. At least anime wise. <:RengeShrug:609373443225419786>
I wouldn't consider Index a protag. She has a role but she's just there to fill it rather than do anything with it.
I thought Accel was protag 3
Lmao. If you're referring to Kaguya-Sama. Then the show is no mere SoL anime.
~~It's the best harem anime.~~
Chris and Cat both begin with C
Sorry I'm an old man who's decided that I'm ok with not watching Owl House. /lh
She's the only one with a haircut tbh.
Finished RWBY IQ.
She hasn't seen W. Unfortunate.
Maybe that Justice League film will change that somewhat.
It's internet famous but it didn't air on TV first. So it's 1 step away removed from really being mainstream.
I understand the need to do more. Just the way the anime went about it with S3. It felt soul sucking.
Winter 2023? Heck yeah. Winter is looking amazing.
Church this, church that.  It's a show about a goofy yet smart girl who wants to print books.  Give me more of that instead of a whole drama taking up the majority of the season.
Having never read the LN. I personally didn't like Bookworm S3.
He did. Which was kinda expected. But it does kinda lose the real *shock* factor for me because ||I know damn well that even if he dies. He'll be brought back to life somehow.|| Like I can almost feel a S5 announcement. That's how much I kinda doubt it's gonna have lasting impact.
Oh no. Now that you put it like that
Definitely Gunpen
Teppen 12. I can't believe there's a parody Naruto here.
I have seen exactly 2 of these. DAB and Death Parade
Wow.
^
Doubt. If LycoReco makes more money than all of SAO. Then they'd stop.
Another Shinkai film
The LN isn't the source though. So it's not the anime.
People are never happy. I'm betting the reason why people are upset is a bs reason.
Some are good, some are bad. The experience is no different than watching all other kinds of anime.
You know I intially skipped over this one because my interests don't typically align with mecha or Gundam shows. But I mean if it's gonna be <:HibikiGay:670494484701773845> then I'm in
I mean I don't think they share any of the same staff but I can't imagine that the overall company wants to put out 2 shows that take a lot of ~~overworking to death~~ time to "perfect" in a sense.
Yep
Mercury is Sunrise. I think Ban-Nam is Birdie Wing
So Spring. Which makes sense since Birdie Wing Cour 2 is Jan '23
Apr '23
There's a 2nd cour announced for Mercury so far. Don't know if it has a release month though
Isn't TRIGGER's first anime technically whatever was Gainax's first anime
Kinda true
Now you understand.
Exactly.
~~The message of the film is Daiba Nana really is a Dai Banana imo.~~
https://tenor.com/view/daiba-nana-revue-starlight-gao-shoujo-kageki-revue-starlight-shojo-kageki-revue-starlight-gif-24229541
You're just supposed to go "Holy s**t. That was wi(l)d [screen baroque]. What a movie."
It's Revue Starlight tbf. A talking giraffe running a stage production should tell you that it's not something that makes sense really.
Oh. I just noticed you changed your pfp, Melua.
Let's put it this way.  There's an emphasis on the war part of the title.
It's hard to describe. It's an experience.
You're kinda going like "That's those couple of lesbians who are duking out their matters on stage. I love it when they go all out."
https://tenor.com/view/thats-it-yes-thats-it-that-right-there-omg-that-thats-what-i-mean-gif-17579879
Go with the flow. It does make sense as Ten said. But I mean it's Revue Starlight. 

The movie is like an extension of the show.
It would be even more of a whimper if people had to wait until like mid-July next year to finish this.
Ok. I went back and added a whole ton. Add Naruto to here and I think I've pretty much got them all atm.
I have quite a few favorites here.
I don't think so.
10 years of cute girls blowing up each other's tanks for sport.
https://twitter.com/garupan/status/1578762364287320064?t=bPtfjx_WS78rQ_Ff0OhvOg&s=33
I've seen alot of people praise Edgerunners. But I don't feel it's that worth the hype? <a:youworried:720367375748432004>
If Ash was here. They could probably write a whole essay on how philosophical Comic Girls is.
Oh I watched that one recently. It was good.
Watch this get an anime adaption in like 3 years from now.
We're gonna pretend that dog doesn't exist
It is
Oh weird. It was unlocked I could have sworn.
Oh. The region locked one got unlocked a couple of days ago actually.
Excuse me while this moment from Gundam Witch Ep 3 lives in ny head forever.
But then you'd have to have them re-remember everything at some point. So now it's a different goal.
Time travel is messy.
By that reasoning, Sword falls into the 2nd one.
To put it into perspective,

It doesn't really matter that Subaru was isekai'd in Re:Zero. Re:Zero is more about his character in that world than anything about his former life.

In comparison, Parallel World Pharmacy does matter because the knowledge of medicines and how they're created allows for people of the isekai to be saved from sicknesses that lead to death if not treated.
There's 2 types of isekai, ones that matter after the protagonist is sent to another world and ones that don't matter.
Here's a meme I edited to reflect how I feel about watching Bocchi after Episode 1.
And somewhere in the middle is a bunch of shonen stuff that some people are watching
A very wild season. On one end, there's relatable guitar lonely girl. On the other, maids who solve everything with guns.
^
Watching Shugo Chara Ep 12 and all of the sudden I hear Nana Mizuki singing? She's literally everywhere. I'm still astonished.
If I had to guess, maybe Sunrise is seeing G Witch unexpectedly take off so they want to put more effort into it for it's 2nd cour?
Komi-san from my understanding was "Haha. Funny hijinks and romance ensues with girl who writes more than she really speaks. Look at those facial expressions."

Bocchi is "I have social anxiety. She has social anxiety. We're the same. It's hilariously relatable. Plus, can't go wrong with girls playing in a band."
Truly one of the lines of all time.
Lmao.
They're also not really all that OP. Like they're powerful but there is no increase in power just because they were isekai'd into the game world
Uhhh something something. Lots of people are actually isekai'd and they're trying to find a way back. Also politics somewhat IIRC.
But overall? It's a tie between DIY and G Witch
Best visuals only is Akiba Maid War
I think best OP music wise only is a tie between Bocchi and Eminence In Shadow
Sorry SxF. Bocchi is god tier now.
Which is easy because I'm here to escape reality. Not see it played out in a different way.
If you ignore the politics.
Closer on the 2nd one atm.
As far as I'm concerned, it's a mecha show that just so happens to be called Gundam. I haven't watched any other Gundams and probably never will. <:YumiPoint:688429724103344164>
Exactly. Ash gets it.
I just wanna see Sulleta start slapping other people's butts.
Gonna need a tweet for that one
<@171395487247630336> It may be finally time for me to check out Comic Girls soon.
I didn't know it was happening
<@171395487247630336> Another CGDCT show is getting a S2
It is indeed quite the piece of history.
Bofuri, Death Parade, Grimoire of Zero, Granbelm, Kill la Kill, Darker Than Black, Magi: The Labyrinth of Magic, A Certain Scientific Railgun.

All of that should keep you busy for awhile.
Birdie Wing if you want to just  the most ridiculous things ever that somehow all revolve around golf.
School Live if you're looking for some horror
Revue Starlight for Symphogear but it's about stage girls
Kaguya-sama for the comedy
Girlfriend, Girlfriend if you're looking for a harem show that knows it's a harem show
Fuuto PI for that amazing action.
Akiba Maid War from this season is also good.
Can't go wrong with Yuru Camp.
So again. Completely different from what Bocchi or DIY are doing.
The setting kinda limited the characters.

I've seen all 3 seasons of Bandori. Which is CGDCT in a band. The difference being Bandori is trying to build something massive and so from an anime only perspective. It loses appeal the more new groups join the story. 

Bocchi feels much more small scale and relatable in a way so far. It's a comedy band anime. 

Is it better than DIY? I think DIY is kinda it's own thing. Yes it is CGDCT but it's not going for the same comedy centric vibe Bocchi is. 

Akebi is a CGDCT show but it's also more like a story about a bunch of middle school girls who change because they met Akebi and vice versa.
I haven't seen K-On. But I did watch New Game. I didn't hate it but the characters just didn't click. If I wanted to see an anime about game development, I'd rather watch *Remake Our Life!*

If I wanted a CGDCT anime, I could watch Non Non Biyori.
It's been awhile since I've liked a seasonal this much.
If Happy Birthday Gundam doesn't make my AOTS, then Bocchi defeat will.
Yes
I don't know about Haifuri. But I know I watch GuP for the bonkers tank action featuring CGDCT. It doesn't really matter what the plot is.
First season was good. 2nd season I think I liked less. 3rd season when it wasn't trying to cover stuff left out of the other 2 seasons was pretty good. Washio Sumi hits hard. Never read the LNs or played the mobile game.
Part 6 - You watched Part 1 and then had to wait several months for a Part 2 and in that time. The memes dissappear and nobody remembers what's happened.
Part 5 - memes every week. You watched Giorno and his Italian friends be bad ass.
Think about it this way.
If only there was a Nadeshiko Nesoberi as well.
Being comfy at home and being comfy at a theater are 2 different experiences.
<:NadeSup:426541372468887552>
Would have preferred for the Yuru Camp movie to be in theaters tbh.
Slight visuals update but that's it IIRC.
They didn't really change the opening for Stone Ocean Part 2 though.
Nothing other Stone Ocean Part 3 AFAIK. Which will probably have the same opening still.
Perhaps.
||"Investors. My wife has a rare condition called Dorkinlove. Where they may say or do the dumbest things possible and then I fall deeply in love with her more every single time. However, I'd still like her to be slightly less of a dork so please help me help her."||
Would post more but that'd probably be spamming at that point.

(Is there even a Miku in Kancolle? I don't know.)
I thought this was referring to Miku from Symphogear. But Nevin is making it sound like it's Miku from Kancolle.
I do not recall the anime. I just know I saw a scene of it one day on Twitter and the animation looked older like 70s, 80s. It's basically CW: ||Bandits, Gore, Murder of a family||
Oh that's definitely f**ked up.
Oh lmao. I know exactly what anime this is.
There aren't that much according to AniList. The upcoming one Fenny mentioned seems like your best chance atm.
It's been decent. I need to watch last week's episode still. But so far. I'm liking this season more than the previous 2.
Try and wish for Yuka Iguchi to get a role in the next season
Keep guessing. Maybe we'll get SymphoCure
Not to delve into real world stuff. But I can unfortunately believe that in 2022. A decent chunk of people would believe that.
<:ChrisPray:672578403156885504>
Can't wait to get some fresh Crisp Rat memes
Iow, Bandori walked so D4DJ could run that track one more time.
Bandori took until S3 to nail it I'd say.
Stone Ocean Part 3 (Finale) - The JoJo staff really do know this franchise so well.
Gotta admit. The new Stone Ocean OP is so good.
Sometimes I watch a PV and sometimes I just read the plot synopsis. Sometimes I pick up a show first because there's a VA I like that's in it or because an artist I like made a song for it.
Just gotta go 4th wall. "Due to not having enough budget to animate horses all the time. We will proceed to just have them ride on puppet horses irl"
Ok so. Stone Ocean spoilers ||I didn't like how in the universe removed of Pucci's existence. Anastasia became Joylene's boyfriend. Like I get why it happened. But I personally don't like that it did.||
It's good. I don't think it's as good as Part 5. But I admire how everything happened in the finale (excluding one detail that's more of a personal opinion).
Pfft
You know what doesn't happen every season? Gundam & Bocchi.
There's a big hyped shonen every season.
I wish it was too. Bur this is why I like watching the usually non-popular stuff.
We all know the real messed up Christmas is Ex-Aid. <:KaminaBasaBike:744465376120930344>
BocchiSweep on this chart finally.
This is what we call a W.
Gotta love a show that knows what it is and uses that to it's advantage.
I wouldn't say always sucked. Just never really been able to pull the same feats as DC animation overall. Especially once you hit the mid 2010s.
I mean you don't have to watch all 1,666-ish episodes but I can certainly tell you it's something that can be done in a day.
Aside from villians dying. I don't think they've directly shown someone dying. There's mentions of folks related to Cures being dead though.
Bocchi has the strong and funny character moments, DIY is just fun to watch, Eminence is a parody isekai and knows how to use that.
It's like a tie between Bocchi/Eminence/DIY right now. Gundam has a chance to make it I just need to see how these last 2 episodes go down.
On the other hand. People who are tired of Ash will probably be more open.
Imo. You should start with Star Twinkle if we're talking about something recent.

Yes5 if you kinda want the season that basically started the idea of having a team of characters and a plot.


I don't disagree with the other recommendations of GoPri/Heartcatch but I personally wouldn't recommend them to people. I think they both have flaws that tend to be overlooked.
It's not Ghost which is good when you pretend thost first 12 episodes didn't happen.

It's more like a basic-ish plot with meh characters. Like Nodoka is a great character and all writing wise. But I'm not interested in her. I like Chiyu but she's bland for a sporty blue. Hinata is ok but I feel like they didn't really touch upon her initial character of "Oh no. I keep getting distracted by things to the point I lose myself in them."
That d ain't a joke though.
Another chance for me to bring up this meme I did.
Remember that Isekai Ojisan also had production issues. So it really is just one after the other.
I think the thing I realized after finishing Akiba Maid War is that ironically the war part happening so much in the season itself kinda desensitized me in the finale.
Miraculously.
Early fansub
<@171395487247630336> No spoilers. But I'd say just based on episode 1 alone this has <:HibikiGay:670494484701773845> potential
Spring, Summer, and Fall all had some good shows
Gonna be hard to choose a favorite of the year
I currently have Gundam at a 9. But maybe I'll lower Bocchi and put Gundam at a 9.5 in 2 weeks
Excluding Gundam because that's still in progress. I think anything I have here could be AOTY. But most likely I'd be making a cutoff at a score of 9 or above.
I think I would be down with a Soul Eater remake though as well for the last one
Gimme

Super Cub S2

Fuuto PI S2

Magi S3

Noragami S3

and I guess Neptunia S2?
This is like the number 1 thing I've been wanting in the CGDCT space for awhile.
Which finally.
Bowling apparently
Teppen is manzai comedy. Comic Girls is manga comedy.
Different show
I finally got around to watching Comic Girls Ep 1. I wasn't feeling it at first but the self deprectating comedy got me good. So I will be sticking with it for now.
Then you'd have Gundam fighting golf and bowling.
Imagine if that bowling anime also comes out in the spring.
Have I seen the show? Yes. Do I have a best girl? Very tough to say. But out of all the designs. I like Beta the most. So I'm going to say she's best girl (for now).
Toradora was fun when I was in high school. Not so sure I'd watch it today though.
Hmm...best romance I've seen up to now is Girlfriend, Girlfriend but if we're talking non-harem and non Kaguya. Then probably Plastic Memories?
Eromanga Sensei was ok.
<:miikoWat:826553819323170876> 

I'm sorry. They did what now
I did watch Yurikuma Arashi last year but I just didn't get it and overall found it unpleasant.
Ikemen bear is holding an auction for some prized honey.
Best Scene I guess will go to ChuChu punch for the meme.
Overall I can still only give it a 7.5/10 though. I did enjoy it and I did like most of the characters and the comedy. But I think it's time I explore something a little different.
Then it gradually got better the more episodes I watched and the last 2 episodes gave me some emotions ngl.
So I wasn't really feeling it like the first 2-3 episodes.
I was expecting something different at first for whatever reason. I think I was experiencing sickness from watching too much CGDCT kinda shows.
<@171395487247630336> So I finally finished Comic Girls.
The Tom & Jerry animated show from Japan is a kids cartoon. But it's likely not to be shown in the west. So people wouldn't know that. So their assumption then is that it would be an anime.
There isn't a particular style to anime. But imo. It is generally referred to as anime from the outside because that's what the majority imported is.
<:RobroyGlasses:866744651531812894>
https://twitter.com/AniTrendz/status/1610961809837547521?t=XS96LUNZIGWRY3sVp8T6VQ&s=33
I watched the first episode of this yesterday. It's certainly a unique show imo. The episode felt like a movie and I kept thinking "Wow. They're letting things breathe." and "What's gonna happen next?"

<:HeliosThumbsUp:866744365317881877>
Which show are you talking about

I've got like 26 shows I was intially planning to watch and I've already dropped 2 after the first episode and may drop another 2 depending on their 2nd episode.
So S3 of Prisma Illya IIRC
Found the episode.
Pretty sure it's an episode of Prisma Illya

Which one would that be
Decade anime incoming? üëÄ
They split it in 2 so if doesn't do the Netflix equivalent of SpongeBob, they can cancel it.
The middle Spidey kinda looks like a fusion of Deadpool and Spider-Man. Or Punisher and Spider-Man or Deathstroke and Spider-Man perhaps. <:think:457717846105915403>
That does look pretty clean.
Where's Spider-Man but with Symphogear armor though. /lh
Hirogaru Sky pickup? (This is a joke ofc)
And then the movie will have an OVA and then maybe Mappa will be done with AoT
Just you wait. They're gonna announce an anime original movie after the final episode airs. Just to delay the real end even more.
Heanna Sumire
As Nana wills it, it is her birthday today.
https://twitter.com/theseiyuucafe/status/1616465577530331143?t=cDgIxIZbNNdb-dQwPkQJuA&s=33
Interesting
It's not the worst show I've seen. But, it is a lot.
Oh. Some folks will die. But not the majority like AGK.
Maybe now they'll make a S2
It was amazing. I came with no expectations and was blown away. It might be my favorite animated movie of 2022.
Understandable. No big November holidays either I suppose then.
"It was me, Ruby. I turned the Justice League back into teenagers."
I guess Germany doesn't really make too big of a deal out of Halloween huh.
No. It was that RT First people got a 1 week early access to the episode before it went up on YT IIRC.

Ofc. If you use a yar har site. You wouldn't need to wait for the YT upload.
Oh. Rady. As a unproud American, let me tell you. Christmas starts as soon as it turns November 1st.
Oh I was waiting for a twist.
Good thing Maple doesn't have her own giant mecha in the anime yet (afaik) or else she'd dominate SRW too.
I mean fair enough. I'm watching trash too this season. Just different.
I mean it doesn't seem to a big deal from what I've seen from other folks. But, last time I heard about a genderbent show was the one where the old sage turns into a young girl with a need to constantly use the bathroom. So...yeah. Just generally gonna give them a pass and not watch them.
I'm not watching it. Generally not a fan of genderbent shows.
Same mangaka perhaps?
Not enough Dess in this design
Into The Shirabe-Verse
Ok. After Nanoha is clearly going to be Precure. *Copium*
They're still in the process of getting John Wick to appear in S2
Eggman, Doofenshmeritz, Shredder, Hacker, I guess Palpatine kinda counts, right?
Oh. Lord Farquad if Palpatine won't do.
Might be the only one (from after Precure started) too
I think this is the quickest jump from Sentai/Rider to Precure I've ever seen.
It's a great time to start tbh. I wouldn't worry about it being like Gokaiger either.
No real mecha.

But gay? If you look for it enough, you will find it in some seasons for sure imo.
Probably won't be a constant. But if it does well enough maybe every couple of years we get a boy Cure.
(According to AniList, these all count as mecha in some way)

 1) Code Geass 
 2) Tiger & Bunny
 3) Witch from Mercury
 4) Granbelm
 5) DITF
 6) LBX Girls
 7) Cross Ange
 8) Date A Live
 9) Sonic X 
10) Bakugan: New Vestoria
I don't watch very many mecha. If I had to make a Top 10...it would probably be something like...
~~You guys aren't going to put Darling in the Franxx as your #1 on the list?~~ /j
At least they're not announcing it last minute anymore.
When did Captain Earth come out?
I have to remind myself during this conversation that Captain Earth is not Captain Planet because I keep thinking Captain Planet when you all say Captain Earth.
They probably thought he was just going through his Shakespearian phase as a teenager.
Wdym the Witch from Mercury isn't the giant robot
It is a mechanical suit that the duo use.
Yes
<a:wakarimaaaaasu:520955167470911508>
The stage is not for the girls as the girls are the stage.
The position is zero.
Daiba Nana is a Dai Banana
If you understand, then Revue is Starlight.
<:wakarimasu:468431782061277204>
The only thing that you need to understand about Revue Starlight is that the Giraffe understands.
Did it? I didn't know thar was a thing?
100% true. A stab in the ground turns into a position zero.
Idk. I personally loved this part from the new episode.
If I put aside the awful lewdness on young characters throughout the franchise. Then maybe I'd be willing to place vanilla Vivid higher but it's not really something you can just ignore.
That being said, Nanoha is at it's best imo with As and Vivid Strike.
StrikerS is a slow first half, and a better 2nd half.
She is genuinely a fun character I agree
"I can fix her <:MikuLewd:336656493606862868> "
Is the phone number real though? <a:rocksus:912944729786818610>
My first thought for whatever  reason is "has Crazy Frog eyes"
It's Uncle Roger. If he isn't roasting then you know the food is actually legitimately made.
I was just thinking about ||Tilty being a vampire and being embarrassed about sucking blood from the maid. Like maybe there's something there?|| <:3sRokaThink:724815356677455933>
MagiRevo 7 - Oh? This is something. <:MikuCute:672908542763859968>
It's more like the people he happens to "save" all just tend to be women and so some wish to curry favor with him while others just admire him or just respect him as their leader. Like he's not really a romantic type. He knows what it is. But he's not for it.
It's the kinda show that knows what it is in a sense.
LET HIM AGE
TAS is pretty good too. But this one evokes that "detective on a case" feel to me that the others don't.
Probably my favorite Batman song. It just works. Every time.
https://youtu.be/it1AVeGS3dw
The JoJo style moves really helps sell the golf part
Yes. Right this instant. This is the most wild kind of golf you will ever see.
I mean a theme is a theme. My expectations aren't that it's all about food/cooking and nothing else. But, it needs to get the characters and story down imo in a way that makes me say "Now that's how you do a PreCure season"
Delicious Party may not be my 5th favorite season of PreCure but if I'm looking at it from an overall 2022 anime perspective. It's not that bad.
Here it is. How I'd rank the 2022 animes/movies/etc.
Done. <:vitchsigh:1000545928312258621> 

That was exhausting.
1 show left. Where do I place it. S or A? <:think:457717846105915403>
I'm cursing myself for having watched so many anime.
*and Bookworm as well
I haven't finished ranking at all yet. But after sorting through everything. These are all the anime/films I completed in 2022.
I'm only watching 22 new anime this season after dropping a few.
Also it's a lot easier to watch when everything is spread out throughout the week.
I "normally" don't watch a lot of anime but something about last year just had a lot of shows that made me say "Let's try it out and see what it's like" and then I feel entertained enough to watch the entire thing.

I only watched like 5 shows in Winter 2022. Spring, Summer, Fall though? So many things.

Some of you mentioned about how good fripSide was when we're playing AMQ. Well I can definitely say that now that I know she sang this song
Forgot how good this opening is.
