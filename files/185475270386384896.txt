I've been meaning to join it for a while now
Thanks!

I give my sincerest condolences and hope that they rest in peace.
I didn't really have the proper chance to get to know them as well as others on this server, but I can tell that she meant a lot to the people that had that chance to get to know them.
fair enough. I honestly wasn't sure about how long they could be open tbh
so there's also the problem of someone being too late to reply to a thread on a prompt before the thread locks itself
I know there's a time limit to how long a thread can be open
Which is why I stayed out of it and let people have their fun
I'll put in my two cents and leave it at that: Sure, I wasn't a fan of the NFT joke for my own reasons, but it's no excuse to not let people have their fun on April Fools' day.
