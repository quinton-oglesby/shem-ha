Hi Hase!
The cult is spreading
Rally Vincent PFP? Based
Hello!
Welcome!
Welcome!
Thank you all for the warm welcomes ‚ù§Ô∏è
Oh hai Mel
I left for awhile but now I‚Äôm back
Still looks cool though
*explodes*
What?
The Johnny version? Niiiiiice
Oh nice!
Love seeing other people build gunpla
But yeah <@!245296409417482241> if you build any more kits feel free to tag me in them!

I guess I‚Äôll post these here but I pre ordered some kits of PBandai
Looks awesome!
NICE
I mean I usually go to bed then anyway but you get the picture
Didn‚Äôt get to bed around 5 in the morning
I once foolishly built the MG Unicorn Full Armor Ver Ka late at night
Can‚Äôt wait to go model kit hunting tomorrow myself
Ah
I‚Äôm just sayin have fun is all üôÇ
And that‚Äôs a good place to start
You do what you want with it
Do what you want with the kit. Do a straight build, color it, or give it battle damage whatever
Gunpla is freedom.
Oh and another piece of advice
Had a lot of fun building mine.
I will say some HG‚Äôs are hit and miss in terms of quality.
But the Moon Gundam is a top tier choice
Comes with a display stand in the kit so you can pose it freely right out of the box
The Moon Gundam is an awesome kit
Or I broke something
I mean I use super glue on model kits sometimes. But that‚Äôs only when either the part is super loose
It shouldn‚Äôt
<@!87512939107450880> <@!279341087494242304>

<@!87512939107450880> Sumeragi is my Gundam waifu
She good
I‚Äôm gonna woo Sumeragi
It‚Äôs actually celestial being I‚Äôm trying to be recruited by
Sush
I got the MG Endless waltz heavy arms, Altron and sand rock coming in January
For my custom project
<@!87512939107450880>

<@!245296409417482241>
Ask questions my friend
Oh sure!
I have the chibi musashi
HA
Nice
Hopefully that one is a better construction
I also got Leaventin from Full Metal Panic from them
New group
Aoshima
It looks great don‚Äôt get me wrong. But there‚Äôs some loose bits I‚Äôm not a fan off
I swear this pose is the only one I can do without the arms wanting to pop off on me
Chiefly. POLY CAPS FOR THE ARM JOINTS!
But I have issues
I‚Äôd love to praise this kit
GUNBUSTER!


So far so good

Nu Gundam is like ‚ÄúEh man what am I chop liver?‚Äù
The part that had me disappointed is that I don‚Äôt feel like building the weapons or anything else.
What‚Äôs the point of posing a model kit if arms are just gonna pop right off?
I love what you did with strike freedom
Very nice
Poggers
Nice!
There are a lot of stickers true but man it does make the unit look really cool
Was it a nice build?
NICE!
G Gundam is so worth it
G Gundam is great
An actual horse pilots it
And that horse?
Master Gundam is a bada**!
I dislike victory to no avail. But I don‚Äôt hate V2AB.
And I do want to rep all the Gundam series I can
DON‚ÄôT STOP CARRY ON!
<@!99695384296701952>
JUST WHO THE HELL DO YOU THINK I AM?

And starting with a simple HG is always a nice place to start
Yeah some kits be HUGE
<:CagliostroSmile:672861875385401344>
It‚Äôs a high grade so you should be fine
Oh very nice!
And yeah Super glue isn‚Äôt the be all end all.
But I‚Äôve built plenty of kits where it was necessary
They need to do new kits of older MG‚Äôs already
And also the transformation gimmick is finicky as hell
Gatling guns
Many
So
The full armor unicorn Gundam Ver Ka was a pain
Just ping me before you get the glue. Just to make sure you get the right kind
It‚Äôs just good practice to have some on standby
Krazy brand super glue
I just recommend some standard super glue
Some things are a bit finicky but otherwise it‚Äôs the best Ver Ka model kit out there
Other than that no glue needed
I literally only had to glue two pieces. And that was for the pieces that hold up the wings
Mission start!
Target lock on

<:KirikaSalute:620069889838809089>
Im just your friendly neighborhood Ojou Sama
It‚Äôd be mother in my case
And should you have any other questions then I‚Äôd be happy to help!
Oh but my number one piece of advice is this ‚ÄúGunpla is freedom.‚Äù Follow whatever your creative heart desires
In the event a piece or two is loose
All you need is a basic gunpla model kit set. And maybe super glue
Yeah you should have no problem selecting your first gunpla there
Nice!
Though if your local comic or hobby store has Gunpla (Gundam Model kits) then get em that way. Saves you money on shipping and helps you support local businesses
Oh and as to where you can get these model kits. Online retailers are usually your best bet.
My first HG ever was the Unicorn Gundam
That‚Äôs where I stated out. And my advice go with the one that you think looks the coolest
Master Grades are 1/100th scale. And tend to feature more complex constructions and articulation
Perfect for beginners
They tend to be more simple in construction
The High Grades are 1/144th to scale of the actual Mobile suit if it existed IRL
Then there‚Äôs the MG or Master Grade line. And those units can be $50 plus
There‚Äôs the HG or High grade line. They tend to be on average $25 USD from what I‚Äôve seen
It depends
That‚Äôs awesome To hear!
üôÇ
But yeah hopefully my advice helped
Lol
Look up tutorials if you‚Äôre unsure
I got to go now but that‚Äôs as best as I can do
You‚Äôll cut right below that little ball joint
For example where I circled on the image
You‚Äôll want to cut the part that isn‚Äôt the piece itself
Ok so you see how the parts are kinda locked in place on the runner?
Or rather... hmmmm
Just hold off on building for right now. And I‚Äôll DM you a pic of where you‚Äôll generally want to cut the pieces out
And that should work for now
I‚Äôm at work but I‚Äôd be happy to show you an example when I get home
If not they are pretty cheap
That*
Something like they
<@481518367845646346>

You can use nippers
And that was years ago
And then let me take it home when I was done!
They literally ordered a bunch of gunpla
It was a anime club in community college
<@481518367845646346> this was my first kit ever
Some units are strictly ground units
Some Gundams can‚Äôt
G Gundam is not concerned with things like logic
And yet it works
Why not?
If that happened it‚Äôd be so damn big
Yeah they are pretty boss
Oh you mean Master Gundam and Fuunsaiki?
Robot mode
Simp for Haman
ZZ
But that‚Äôs for a later time
Can‚Äôt wait to build my seven sword exia
Perfect grades are big!
Oh that‚Äôs the perfect grade my mistake
MG Exia and the 1/100 Bawoo and the Zaku from 0080!
Very nice!
Yeah that‚Äôs pretty dope!
And the beauty of the Core is how you mix and match the various armors.
Though they are making Core Gundams that you can buy separately
Aka the one that comes with the Earthtree Gundam <@!245296409417482241>
The Core Gundam
All good kits can confirm
Those are some nifty kits
Nice
Trans Am baby!
You know now that you mention it I can‚Äôt unsee it.
Not that‚Äôs a bad thing mind you üôÇ
Poggers
If I can look THAT cute one day I‚Äôll be happy
Minus the pink eyebrows that I just noticed
It me
https://share-cdn.picrew.me/shareImg/org/202101/43383_n0beHKuz.png
*pats*
Only I‚Äôm saving money for a Trip to Japan
In a similar situation
I get it
So many good model kits
And the infintism line is great
I built the HG Arbalest and that was fun
Nice
But rest assured once I do the squad will be together
I don‚Äôt have the shelf space for Eva Unit 0 and the positron cannon
Rip

Looks cool though
Idk
Just saw this and I think it looks nice! üëå
Dope!
Flyboys
A fun kit!


But I‚Äôm gonna decal it
Oh I know it‚Äôs weird
And decals to come in full later as well
Taking a break for now cuz dinner
Trying waterside decals for the first time in ever
This kit will take a bit longer than I usually do these things
I loved the Fire Bomber references
My favorite aspect of Ozma was how he was clearly the old school rock and roll type
Ozma‚Äôs is pretty legit
Time to build my first Macross kit!
Pricey for a high grade but super worth it
Roughly $45-50 US dollars
No problem! And yeah they are cool!
And he‚Äôs 1/300th to scale
He‚Äôs a big lad
KING GO-SAURER!!!!
Yup 1/300 Go Saurer HG‚Äôs
Time to combine!
That‚Äôs dope!
MAGNA SAURER! Combined with the Go Saurer to form MAGNA BUSTER
<@740195087895756820>
Posting this here too
Resident Ninja who‚Äôs always on a secret mission. Azami Mochizuki pilots her Spricle Striker Mugen into battle! All in a days work for the Imperial Combat Revue!
Very nice! Good job!
One of the girls Hatsuho has a  big effing hammer
All the new girls have their charms and personalities
But what I have played I like
I haven‚Äôt beaten the new one
Once they are built of course
Oh and <@!233721366782672896> I plan on posing the Sakura wars kits I do have together
Like damn Kubo SNAPPED with her design
Anastasia Palma is good
From the Imperial Combat Revue located in Tokyo, Japan and defending the citizens from Demons!
It‚Äôs the  Spricle Striker Mugen!
Piloted by the alluring actress Anastasia Palma! Go forth into battle!
I‚Äôm just glad the kit holds up well
I don‚Äôt really care about stuff like that
BRAVE RAIDEEN!
Yes
Well I ordered it off of Goodsmiles website
I‚Äôll let you know if it‚Äôs any good
It looks very nice
I got that one on pre order
But more often than not they won‚Äôt
So sometimes they‚Äôll do a second run of a kit if it‚Äôs popular enough
Now the only draw back is they are limited waves
And I love how that line of model kits is doing all sorts of classic robots
I picked up the MODEROID Great Zeroymer
That‚Äôs probably the biggest selling point. Accuracy
But it poses nicely and very show accurate
I didn‚Äôt use any glue like the instructions wanted
and it was a different build
I have MODEROID MazinKaiser SKL
Yes
That‚Äôll be fun!
Oh and PLAMAX Mashin Hero Wataru figures
They did confirm they are doing the best Train boy
Can‚Äôt wait for MODEROID to do Might Gaine
MazinKaiser is always cool
Though I‚Äôd love a Mazinger Zero kit
Can‚Äôt wait for Kotetsu Jeeg next
CHANGE! GETTER DRAGON!
Yup!
KAKURE DAISHOGUN!
They are a nice build
Another Spiricle Striker is done
After being on my butt about it for a week
Finally

That‚Äôs funny as heck!
~~I can‚Äôt open it on my phone for some reason Gomen~~
I‚Äôm sure it sounds fine my dude
Thank you
GREAT ZERORYMER!
Building the Baund Doc was fun
Guest Starring my roommates warhammer space marines
The Baund Doc is done!

And damn Loris *headpats*
Oh and the best part is that they don‚Äôt charge until it actually ships
That‚Äôs roughly close to what I was charged for over here
Just to be on the safe side
But yeah <@509335685791088661> if you get a MODEROID I‚Äôd recommend getting modeling glue
I like my thicc boys
That‚Äôs rough buddy
And with shipping and the actual unit. It was about $63
IMPERIALDRAMON!
Good luck my dude!
There is a fake turn X Gundam in the show but we haven‚Äôt seen a model kit of it yet

ZENBU ZENBU ZENBU ZENBU!
1/100 scale
Honestly the Heat Rod wasn‚Äôt as painful as I thought
But that‚Äôs not to say something similar happens to other builds
For the one I built? No
TallGeese III done!
J-DECKER!
Now imagine if it was a MG scale kit
So of course you got to make the sword big!
It‚Äôs an homage to Super Robots and the Obari pose
DRYON 3 NOIR!
Frell it
Will add on the core booster expansion tomorrow

But requires patience and a steady hand
It‚Äôs possible
And now it‚Äôs time for L-Gaim!
Me and my Roommate did a thing
https://twitter.com/des_shinta/status/1390538377615773699?s=21

Gunner Zaku Warrior! (Lunamaria Hawke Custom)!

What will his eyes see as he travels through the many worlds?

KEEP YOUR HEAT! KEEP THE BEAT!

Nice
If evil then why hot?
Only Makima
No thoughts
It‚Äôs basically if you took the four HG‚Äôs that make up the ReRising Gundam and put them in one box. And everything is organized
And the Gold is from the final battle of ReRise
It‚Äôs not that hard it‚Äôs the same as if you did the normal colors
It‚Äôs just cool they even released it all
I have that kit and I love it
Nice!

I believe the leg gap is for articulation purposes
Yeah as long as you followed the instructions to the letter you‚Äôre fine
Yes
But if that thing came charging at me I‚Äôm running
The TallGeese is dummy thicc
That would be a Zechs thing to say
That was my first MG ever
Nice
MasterGrade?
And yeah the avalanche Rex Buster is super cool
Valkylander
Even if you can only really pose the thing one way
But I still love how you can do this
I agree about the Aegis knight Gundam

HG?
Good luck with the move!
I don‚Äôt think you have
The Wodom Pod is so good
Poggers
Very nice
Last kit of the night is the Gundam G04!
L-Gaim MK-II!
Extreme Gundam!
Dope
You‚Äôre in for a good time!
Sasuga
I wouldn‚Äôt even been able to get that far
Man you are so smart
Nice
She looks cute
Tobikage and Houraiou!

Still need to watch Dancouga
DANCOUGA
Nice
Lol
Like a transition between master grade and high grade
But the kit looked cool and it was a fun build
I never seen Denball Senki
LBX-ODIN

BURN IT UP!
MAZINGER!!!
üëç
Keep it up my dude
I think having a pure destroy form and a pure awakened form would look nice
I saw that not too bad üëç
Yup
VERSAL KNIGHT GUNDAM!
Oh yeah it will
But it has articulation where it counts and looks hella cool
Easy to build. Not the most posable
It‚Äôs a pretty good series of kits!
GAIKING THE GREAT


GAIKING
Yeah the lighting made it look red
Poggers
So why green and red just curious?

I also built the G04
Yeah!
Gundam G05

Cool
Oh snap look at that swag
I built the F90 Unit 2 myself last night
Pretty cool!
Seeing the problem here?
But imagine having to buy 26 of them.
Through PBandai. When it‚Äôs 1 per customer
I can‚Äôt recall the exact number but it wasn‚Äôt that expensive in the grand scheme of things.
The F90 unit 2 was I believe standard Master Grade price.
Ball park $50 on average
A lot
If you wanted to display all the Units that have come/will be out
But it requires you buying 26 F90‚Äôs
It‚Äôs a neat idea
Sadly you can‚Äôt
It‚Äôs a whole series
Like a missile pod set. Rocket shield sled thing
Then there are add on units that are listed from well A to Z
Where you buy one of these kits from P Bandai right
It‚Äôs part of the F90 A to Z series
Lol
Gundam F90 Unit 2!
That‚Äôs pretty lit
Cool
Looks good!
GOD MARS!
TRIDER G7!
Thx!
The only thing it doesn‚Äôt have is the Goldion hammer
FINAL FUSION!
GENESIC GAOGAIGAAAAAR!!!
Very nice!
üôè
Cagali Yula Atha in Strike Rogue Gundam launching!
This model kit was very fun to build and the Ootori Striker pack is awesome!
Nice
The Strike is top tier
Will work on the Ootori backpack tomorrow
Cute
That‚Äôs pretty rad!
MODEROID Escaflowne
Gear Fighter Dendoh and Oger!
Shark shark
UMU
You‚Äôre the best human
Because it gave me +50 years to my life cycle
So can I post that image but tag you in it since you are the creator?
Awesome
Nice! Do you have a Twitter so I can RT that?
Lian and GunKid!
Together they form a Giant Sword and the Infinity Cannon for Super Fire Dagwon!
CHOU KAEN GATTAI!
SUPER FIRE DAGWON!
GOURIKI GATTAI! POWER DAGWON
KAEN GATTAI!
FIRE DAGWON!
But I heard it‚Äôs a mixed bag at best
i haven‚Äôt seen season 2
Yeah
I think the cast you have is good enough
It was ok not my favorite
Also shin getter vs Neo getter acknowledgement is always a good thing
I can picture a game with those three worlds
World of protectors.
World of Rebels.
And world of Survivors
You know the way you broke that down I can totally see that
She pulls out the fist from Glorious break to help do the Big Bang punch
Or they do a double BIG BANG PUUUUUNCH
Dude I had the same thought!
Give Bikki the Goldion hammer
Hibiki and the king of Braves in one game would be so based
Yeah I get that
Fuck yes!
üëåüëåüëå
TY PUMPKIN CHAN

And Show Zama was having none of it XD
Lelouch is a theater kid having to deal with another theater kid‚Äôs (Salia) antics
I loved that mission
Oh yeah that event!
Anytime Pumpkin Chan!

Nice one Pumpkin Chan!
Pretty Salia‚Äôs continued delusional adventures!

Assembling stuff for my custom Gundam Ichiaval Custom project

Good choices
Nice
Still a good job though!
Super based!
Xi Gundam!
Shinn Asuka! Sword Impulse Gundam Launching!
Cool!
My roommate helped a ton with this.
There‚Äôs still painting I need to do. But GUNDAM ICHIAVAL CUSTOM
Nice
So I ain‚Äôt complaining
Halloween is the best holiday
Though why you made a Halloween song in July is anyone‚Äôs guess
Well you certainly invoked the feeling of Halloween
Very nice
Very nice!
Next up from Sakura Wars 2019 is Hatsuho Shinonome‚Äôs Spiricle Striker Mugen! Boasting a giant hammer of PAIN!
I still need to build Hatsuho‚Äôs and Sakura‚Äôs upgrade kit
I have all the other Sakura wars 2019 kits
Or was it 2020? Either way
From Sakura Wars 2019 it‚Äôs another Spiricle Striker Mugen! This time piloted by a girl named Claris and her magic Grimoire!

GAO!
Yup
Benjamin V2 Gundam
Gundam Geminass 01
Nice
RABBIT
TANK
BEST MATCH!
Gundam F90 and Gundam F90-1
Each with the V Type and R Type Packs respectfully!
Like a pair of guardian lions
And these growlithe are known to be with a partner
PRECIOUS GROWLITHE PUPPY
Nice
<@87512939107450880>

CYBUSTER!
Nice
With that the entire Imperial Combat Revue is here!
The Spiricle Striker Prototype Obu!
Right
It‚Äôs a pretty nice kit!
Ultra Instinct Goku!

That is my cracked head canon

Re:Rise? Awful?
Na fam that show was lit!
Nice
There‚Äôs also Plastic Cement as an option
If you ever need to tighten up a joint try nail polish
Very nice!
Barbatos is so cool!
Nice Barby!
Perfect!
Nice
Exia is Sexy
If I had more I would!

Nice
That is kinda cute and yet horrifying
I can‚Äôt for that bad boy to be released
The shield is just there
Oh he‚Äôs holding the blade in each hand
Sandrock!



Barbatos Lupus Rex!
Kinda loose but not bad



It‚Äôs a fun kit!
So you can just focus on building
Very minimal stickers
I know the feel
And wow the Kapool hasn‚Äôt received a proper HG? Like a model kit of it exists but it‚Äôs ooooold
I mean the Wodom Pod  from Re:Rise exists. But yes I agree
A lot of older kits deserve an updat
But lord it needs a 2.0
The MG God Gundam is good for the time! I don‚Äôt care what anyone says
Badass! I love that kit
I just really loved Re:Rise
Yeah
I have all of them
I love all of them
The Core Gundam and it‚Äôs planet system are so cool!
Core Gundam is one of my favs! Look at this little gentleman!
Sick!
Don‚Äôt tell me what to do!
https://twitter.com/admiralblue5/status/1446739141241327619?s=21
The HG Sirbine is already done!

That looks like a figure that would work well with an action base
Did Gallantmon come with a stand?
Yeah some plastic cement from the hobby store should fix that right up
Gouf troop
Nice
At least not in my experience anyway
It maybe a bit back heavy but overall nothing is wrong with the kit
And I‚Äôve seen pics of this kit without using the action base
I didn‚Äôt use glue or anything
And even with it off the action base it stands up just fine by itself

And there‚Äôs an action base included for a reason
I have the kit and it stands up just fine
No it‚Äôs not?
The Wodom Pod is top
That looks really good!
*hugs you*
I don‚Äôt usually do stickers
With the nice shiny Titanium finish!
RG Force Impulse


üëç
Niceu!
Epic
Lol!
Tessa and Chris are mistaken for sisters or something lol
Also Full Metal Panic is always kino
I can see a scenario where Cutie Honey could fight
Cutie honey lol
GaoGaiGar the King of Braves
Hibiki Queen Of Braves
Hells yeah!
I think the super robots you listed are enough
So Magic vs Science? Sounds cool!
AWESOME!
Or the Magic world invading our world?
Multiverse?
That‚Äôs a very diverse and well rounded list!
Niceu
Then you‚Äôre a f*cking awesome dude!
Oh
Did you make that <@131244146324144137>?
PFFFFFFF
Oh trust me an action base will make the Strike Freedom look so good!
Nice
So basically we were denied a Shem Ha villain song
And Noriko‚Äôs VA can sing
Noriko and Shem Ha have the same VA.
Yes really
Shem Ha
Hibiki: You sound familiar have we met?
Noriko: No??????
How much more hot blooded can you get?
Noriko and Hibiki
Niceu
It‚Äôs better than drugs
Niceu!
I see
Nice
That looks good dude!
Nice!
Those characters are definitely secret recruitable material
I approve!
Sounds like a good premise!
üëç
Kiramei go!

Awesome
Pog

I KNOWüòç
TRANS AM!

GUNBUSTEEEER!!!
Ordered it along side the actmode Chris
Oddly I have a liger zero on pre order
Lol
METALGARURUMON!

Unless the gears ever got their own giant robot or something that can punch a planet or something then yeah
Yeah Ultraman even at the most basic level are insanely strong. So putting them against the gears is unfair
It‚Äôs Lacus!
Booba
It poses well. Nothing flops around.
It f*cks!
Ikr?
I have that kit and it‚Äôs so not like your usual HG.
It‚Äôs kinda awesome!
And a display stand that helped too
A little nail polish helped with that
Well the hip joint ball cap wasn‚Äôt the best for my Helios either

Do you display them all separately? Or as Kaiser Gridknight?
But now that we know MODEROID Gridknight with Goldburn is a thing
I ordered mine through another online retailer. But theirs got backed up to January somehow

Going with the GM was a solid choice
NICE!
I used a DX for my Ichaival custom
Crossbone Gundam!

Thank you!
They all share a similar build with only slight deviations based on the defining features of each one
The Rayearth kits were fun easy simple builds
I‚Äôm not too harsh tho bc this was one of the earlier MODEROIDs and they‚Äôve gotten better with that with time
The build was nice. Some parts are a bit tight. The only real criticism is a lack of paint apps on things that should have them

Kirika and Shirabe I love
CUTE
Maria‚Äôs hair is floofy enough for GF‚Äôs to snuggle with
Maria has magic hair
Listen what‚Äôs the point of committing war crimes if you can‚Äôt be cute?
I‚Äôm a girl too and looking at Maria‚Äôs hair. Maintaining that must be a nightmare
Maybe Maria is a secret cat girl
Like how does she style it to do that?
I love Maria‚Äôs cat ears in her hair
What a couple of cuties!
Kirika and Shirabe posting? It must be my lucky day

Imagine trying to brush Maria‚Äôs hair
Big sisters!

I head canon Maria put parental blocks on the TVs at the base for Kirika and Shirabes protection
Or*
Death Roomba of Doomba
Or Kirika found a way past the parental block on the tv again
Either they know what that means
And to slice and dice any fool that messes with them.
Just I want those two to be happy and get all the head pats.

I hate what they did to it in the second half of it
Shame what happened to Hibiki though
*Blasts Invoke on full volume*
I‚Äôm just imaging a Symphogear XDU and Gundam Seed event now
Point is the gears in SRW could work
They are both
And that dude can punch out giant sized robots
In Cross Wars Omega Kazuma from ScryEd made his debut
Master Asia once showed up in SRW before and took out EVA unit 1
Like they could be small and fast but have small HP pools
Symphogear in SRW would not be the weirdest thing ever
Duo you hopeless bum
Aaaah
Top Dad?
People can deny but there‚Äôs no way they would cast those VA‚Äôs without knowing about the mecha side of things
Again Symphogear is Mecha
NORIKO WHY
That old bastard

Oh and Miku is Beside Hibiki every step of the way
She does charity work for kids in need

I love the idea of Hibiki being the new commander of SONG.

She learned from the best and is now the best

Stop being cute!
Like you‚Äôre evil!
Right?
Ooooh someone likes to live on the edge. I like it!
But I will develop the linguistic skills needed to verbally overthrow my foes
Alright fine
Like if Haman Karn told me to kill a man. Well someone gonna die
If a villainess who has big boss energy tells me to commit crimes. I might say yes
What?
She is hot though

The idea of Germain living and being a friend to Hibiki makes me happy!
I don‚Äôt know what it is!
She teaches Hibiki things that Genjuro can‚Äôt
Germain is Hibiki‚Äôs older lady friend
YES
A parade of blessed artworks I see

Rukia best bleach girl

It was a bleach Brave souls event
And yes.

I love me some strong female characters
Like My Next life as a villainess
But I will go into slice of life if the premise interests me
But Mecha and Shonen are my wheel house
I try at the very least to be familiar with a wide range of anime
Never heard of it
I‚Äôve lost count
Just hit me with a show and I‚Äôll tell you if I‚Äôve seen it
I don‚Äôt use MAL
My tastes and interests are vast
There‚Äôs still a great deal I haven‚Äôt seen or choose not to watch
She can slay me
QUEEN
HALIBEL
If only we could be so lucky
Yeah
Her female suitors could literally all be in her room. Ready to hug and kiss her. And she‚Äôd probably still not get it!
Maria literally trying to kiss Catarina on the cheek.
Catarina not taking the hint
Bakarina doesn‚Äôt know how to handle things


HOLY COW THATS GOOD
But this blessed art has given me strength anew!
I must leave
THEM!
I WOULD DIE FOR THEN
AAAAAAAAH
BE STILL MY GAY SHIPPING HEART!
Though settling on option one Geordi would be a mistake if you ask me
I haven‚Äôt read later novels so Idk
Prince Alan is pretty nice
Yeah he is
That‚Äôs always a bit squicky
Yee I saw
I love this!
I mean she‚Äôs a gift every single day of the year but I digress
Miku is Hibiki‚Äôs present this year
Kanade dying: All we are Tsubasa is dust in the wind........

But yes I love ShemMiku as a concept
Shemmy and Miku sharing the same body and teasing Hibiki on occasion.
Thus leading to a more confident Miku

Miku interacting with a not evil shemmy
That would be kind of nice
A shemmy that travels the world
More of a ‚ÄúCross me and you feel my wrath‚Äù type
She‚Äôs less evil than the main counterpart
AU Shemmy that‚Äôs like a classic gothic lady
The lady gracing everyone with her presence

I understand this art
Honestly proud of her
I saw
Like the type of lady that is elegant when needed.
But cross her and you‚Äôll find your butt out the nearest window
Well Shem Miku can be forceful when need be
Who‚Äôs heart belongs to Hibiki alone
As time goes on Miku becomes a lady among ladies
Yes
Miku: I have an ancient goddess that helps me out on occasions but has a bad side to her 

Yugi Moto: Ok you‚Äôre not gonna believe this....
I just think an interesting story is there is all
<:MikuGay:336656810788388864>
Listen just have Shem and Miku get along and kiss Hibiki together ok?
By the end of it all Shemmy and Miku‚Äôs personality fuses.

The grace of an ancient goddess.
With the headstrong ness of Miku
But realizing what a deed she had done decides to travel the world to atone in some way or form
Shem Ha corrupting Miku
Imagine AUShem-Ha being cordial and elegant <@!161155855524298752>
‚ÄúHello there Hibiki San. I may look like the one you call Miku in this world. But I am Shem-Ha. How do you do?‚Äù

YES! I approve of this
I‚Äôm sorry what

Though the second half while good isn‚Äôt as great as the first half was.
Mainly because they introduce annoying kid characters and the new villains aren‚Äôt as engaging
Combattler was pretty good. It really did do things that most shows weren‚Äôt doing at the time.
The first half of the show is pretty kino
Anyone here see Combattler V?

No but for reals that team is best house for how gay they are

In Edeleth‚Äôs kingdom such pairings are now possible
Kisses from both sides
Yes
Mercedes and Dorothea are dying to get to know you better
Unleash your inner gay
Yes. Ingrid
So movin on
Well everyone says Erin was better and the definitive voice
With a script that didn‚Äôt change much from the source
Well directed and they got the best VA‚Äôs around
The entire dub for P4 was lit
Unpopular? Erin Fitzgerald‚Äôs Chie is like top tier.
At least I think they do
My favorite part is how their English VA‚Äôs also support the ship.
Chie and Yukiko are girlfriends
Be gay across the new world
Marry wife

Yeah my idea is metaverse shenanigans led to Futaba winding up in Lydian

She loves her headphones

MAZINKAISER HIBIKI
They gay your honor
YES
ü•∞ü•∞
Oh I saw
Wife
So Hibiki can punch him real good
Yeah if Gil whipped out Ea it‚Äôs game over for hamster
Yeah. I think by the time Gil got serious Hibiki would‚Äôve already gotten a few hits in
Aka Gil on a good day
Oh yeah Caster Gil
He could‚Äôve killed Shirou at any time. But he‚Äôs always like ‚ÄúNah this kid ain‚Äôt worth the trouble‚Äù or ‚Äúnah this kid ain‚Äôt nothing‚Äù
I actually liked that character flaw of his.
Mhm
Honestly I can see this happening.
Since Gil‚Äôs claim to fame is weapon spam and the god sealing chain Enkidu.
Hibiki can probably punch faster than Gil can spam. And Enkidu wouldn‚Äôt even work on her
Adorable
Got the source
https://twitter.com/atelieraria/status/1051179319563902977?s=21&t=kdnGI_iWgdY_4ndsysR2eg
But man him getting punched by Hibiki would be so satisfying to watch
Unless Hibiki could have like a Unlimited Fist Works or something crazy like that. Gil would win in the end more often than not I feel
Mhm.

Like Shion in Saga 1 can punch kick and fire lasers
Oh you have no idea

Not a fan of her Xenosaga 2 design.
But in one she‚Äôs a cutie!
Shion!
PRAISE BE

I love her!
!!!!!!!!!!!! MAID W SAMA
Not sure how I feel about it
Her Xenosaga 3 design is better question mark???
Sorry you had to find out like this
And I‚Äôm like wow way to disrespect the glasses crowd

https://twitter.com/gazelle_jun/status/1539214642098020353?s=21&t=Oq3SeRgr-bUmO0m_hG-_zQ
Also notice how her kick ass gauntlet has lost all character.
Like yeah it looks more user friendly now but at what cost?
My friend is halfway through the game and they pulled a big time skip with only a few sentences apparently.
Point is Xenosaga 2 isn‚Äôt a great follow up to the potential of the first game
For no reason
In 2 she can only use ether attacks
Cuuute!
Nice Shion!

Nani the hell?
Putting it super mildly
Yeah.
Yeah things aren‚Äôt fun right now here
*hugs*
I‚Äôm just sorry you‚Äôre hurting so much right now dude
My condolences as well
Pats
Would you say Persona 4 handle the friends dynamic better in this regard?
<:ZweiHug:672455346949980170>
But I understand that it‚Äôs part of the process
Basically I wish transitioning didn‚Äôt take so long
Other times I feel like a bloated whale
Sometimes I think I look good
I already have Confidence issues
Call me Lexi! Or something that doesn‚Äôt bring up my dead gender
To shorten a girls name to a boys name? No thank you
ITS ALEXIS FOR CRYING OUT LOUD
I sometimes get Called ‚ÄúAlex‚Äù at work
For real being misgendered hurts
When my dad re entered my life in middle school.
I thought everything was gonna be great! But then NOPE! He dragged everyone around him down. And tried to force me into fighting someone for no reason
If Hibiki wasn‚Äôt a forgiving character I‚Äôd sock that guy several times over
But seeing Akira leave his family when they needed to be together the most? GAH GO SCREW YOURSELF!
I don‚Äôt feel comfortable talking about everything
Always been jealous of anyone that had a better relationship with their dad
I have issues
I
How DARE YOU ABANDON YOUR FAMILY YOU SON OF A!
So seeing Hibiki‚Äôs dad in Symphogear made my blood boil
And he‚Äôs a coward
A horrible human being that belittles you if you dare to think differently than him
I hate hate hate hate HATE my deadbeat of a father
Add on the misgendering and you got a Lexi that‚Äôs on the verge of biting someone‚Äôs head off metaphorically I mean
It‚Äôs this conflicting state of being jealous but also knowing I shouldn‚Äôt be that makes me feel terrible
And I shouldn‚Äôt be jealous or anything but I can‚Äôt help but feel that way
But then here I am the older sister. I can‚Äôt drive. No romantic life what so ever. And a life that feels like I‚Äôm spinning wheels again
And my sister who is my pride and joy got engaged in December and is gonna get married next year. Hopefully.

So I am so happy for her and glad she found somebody
It really hurts
It hurts
Moms trying to not misgender me or call me by my dead name. And she is trying. But when she slips up as often as she does
I know this is my brain playing tricks on me. But I just hate feeling this way
Like I haven‚Äôt accomplished anything last year
I feel bottom of the barrel
And yet outside of some bright spots here and there
This vacation was supposed to help my psyche
I feel like utter garbage
Will things work out? Who knows but it‚Äôs better than a senate that doesn‚Äôt do anything to help the people
And finally progress can be made
F*ck the police
I live in the US and let me tell you
It was revealed on Twitter
But they are keeping the name private now because the family wants to be respectful
I wish we knew who it was so I can pay respects properly
Yes
World at large may suck but that doesn‚Äôt mean my own personal world has to
I like building model kits and watching anime
*pats*
In really like building model kits and watching anime
Plus.
And there are so many things I have yet to do
But then. If I did that people would be sad that I‚Äôm gone
And there are days where I still feel like taking something sharp and ending it all.
However I had a support network that helped me through those dark times
I tried to kill myself once
I knew that from day one
But if she did say the n-word then her career is over
Well nothing is really stopping her
*hugs*
Stay safe!
*hug*
Thanks Zen
I feel stupid for thinking these things
I think every day ‚ÄúAm i a bad person? And people secretly hate me because if it?‚Äù
I‚Äôm sure others feel this but
Thank you for letting me share this
Simply because of my dad
I fear my angry side
He would would try and ‚Äúfix me‚Äù
Oh that one time he tried to make me fight someone for no reason
The cops had to be called
My dad when I was a kid. Tossed my mom over the couch.
My dad manipulates others. Can barely hold down a job. But makes his various girlfriends suffer
It‚Äôs an irrational fear
Truth be told guys. Anytime I feel negative towards something. I worry that I‚Äôll become just as mean and evil as he is
And my dad can be a monster
Never thought of it like that
Huh
Or at least I get severely agitated
When I see bad anime dads I get triggered
Never there for me or my sis growing up.
And just
He and my mom are divorced. When I was young actually
But my dad is a piece of crap human being who is a manipulative controlling bastard
I try not to hate people
I hate my dad so goddamn much
*breathes*
Yes it is
That‚Äôs not a choice a child should be asking of themselves
Or deal with vomit
Either you don‚Äôt sleep
That‚Äôs cruelty right there
Nani the fuck?

Just keep us posted on the childline stuff

Mhm
Your mom CANNOT get away with what she is doing to you
They seem on the up and up
But for now work with these Childline people
I‚Äôll treat ya to a pizza! Heh heh!
*Hugs*
Never forget that you deserve love and respect Stella
Just gather and record evidence when you can. And we will be with you every step of the way
And you let someone know of what is happening
Indeed
I‚Äôm glad you talked to them Stella
*gives you some of my courage*
*hugs*
That makes sense
If there‚Äôs any assistance you need I can see what I can do to help
I‚Äôm late in seeing this but *Sends pats*
Anytime üëå
What she said
Your mom can go fuck off a cliff
^
*hugs*
But basically Stella‚Äôs mom is horrible
And there‚Äôs more than that
In some ways her situation has gotten worse
To put it lightly
So yeah. Stella.... Stella has not been having super fun times
^
Your aunts seem like the best bet
A 15 minute bus ride isn‚Äôt all that bad actually
*hugs*
What Cert said!
*hugs*
*pats* you‚Äôre a good bean Loris
Finally that bastard is dead
Fucking a man....
Like real nasty stuff
And he spouted conspiracy theories and hateful rhetoric
Maybe a Character inspires someone to be better then themselves
The dredges of day to day reality that tries to grind the soul to a state of nothing
Which they seem to have mellowed out on
To make a long story short
They have said some not cool stuff in the past from my understanding. And tends to rub people the wrong way
üëç
Just wanted to say my piece. Agree. Disagree. Whatever
And I agree with that statement
Which is also fair
And I‚Äôm glad to be her friend
But daily interactions with her tell me she‚Äôs a good person at heart
I‚Äôve seen it. Ok they still speak there mind with no filter at times
And she has changed
I do the same for any of my friends
And if they ever did anything out of line. Like really out of line I‚Äôll call them out on it
I just wanted to get my thoughts on her out there is all
Which is fair.
Just needed to get that out there
Ok just gonna be out with it. I‚Äôm friends with Axia the artist on Twitter. And while they say things and stuff that I don‚Äôt always agree with.
They are a good person with heart that cares just as much as the rest of us.
*hugs*
Though I can‚Äôt imagine how much pain you‚Äôre in. If you need hugs I got plenty of em
And it led me to so many wonderful things
I pushed on
Through support of friends and family
^
And we are here for you
But I know I care bout ya
I don‚Äôt know about your specific situation
Or twice
I mean I was there once
It certainly helps a little
Caring my not take away the pain but
*Hugs*
No kill yourself Aria
<a:ZweiWing:663572847993552936>
Good for your sisters at least!
<@456226577798135808> *hugs*
That‚Äôs a big oof
Honestly yeah in this particular case a cop is safer than your house
I will repeat that as many times as I need too
Far from it
You are not bad at all
They make you feel like nothing
When people are that manipulative
I‚Äôve seen it before
And I wouldn‚Äôt trust that woman with a piece of paper
The dog deserves the best possible owner
That is true
It‚Äôll be rough I know
Zen has a point
And for all we know she‚Äôs probably exaggerating or not being 100% factual
*hug*
You getting out of that house and away from her is the best thing you can do
In more than one way
But yeah even if your mom has some good in her. She has primarily harmed you
Melua has a good point
^
No no she‚Äôs bad
*hug*
All I know is that I wish for nothing but your happiness and I pray for everything to go well
That‚Äôs good
You‚Äôre future and happiness should not be determined by your abusive mom
But it‚Äôs one worth taking
This is all a risk
Yeah an actual oven
But anywhere is better than with your mom
It‚Äôll be a struggle
And maybe your mom was a Victim at one point.
But by now with what she‚Äôs done to you it doesn‚Äôt make her any better
You need to be in a safe place
Point is you‚Äôre on the right path
I wouldn‚Äôt take anything she said at face value
*hug*
Like I could imagine being poor is tough.
But not feeding you for long stretches of time and with barely anything? Ok somethings sus
Well for me it was when you mentioned what you were eating
You got this
But you have had the strength to endure this long
Some days will be like that
But there will be a point where she‚Äôs not your problem
Who knows
*hug*
^
Like you have all that money where is it going too?
Point is for a company with as much money and power as Amazon stuff like the stuff we hear shouldn‚Äôt happen at all
Very true
I can just say that in my experience working at Amazon has been nowhere near the horror stories that I see in the news.
Which makes me wonder what the heck is going on in other buildings
Company secrets that sort of thing
Though I wish I could say more. Don‚Äôt want to accidentally reveal too much on how the building operates
But I can that based on my personal working experience. Just in general. Amazon has been overall more positive then my old job by far.
Though most stories and articles I see about Amazon. I never see happen in my building personally. But that‚Äôs my personal experience as far as the building I work at
The one thing I can say is that I wish I was paid more. Oh I‚Äôm already being paid a decent sum with great health insurance. But considering the money Amazon makes. Yeah we should get more pay
And truth be told most of my personal issues and experiences are relatively normal I guess?
But I work for Amazon
I can‚Äôt say much
So.....
I support it! üëç
Makes sense
Ah
I support it regardless
What‚Äôs Chris gonna do exactly?
So I‚Äôm unfamiliar with other school systems
You‚Äôre Chris Yukine! You can do anything you set your mind to!
He was a legend
Bastards
NFT‚Äôs and people who make them can go to heck
That is so unfair.... Rest In Peace
XD XD
I for one will vote for sex blimps
Well I hope everything works out
Am I toxic?
In which case I‚Äôd feel awful for being such
Unless I‚Äôm also toxic and don‚Äôt realize it
I know of a few here and there that have been toxic. But I‚Äôve only ever had good vibes in this sever at least
Yeah how dare we go around and talk about something we like
Ouch
Are we also toxic too?
So what are we then?
This politics stuff is too heavy for me today. Gonna go lie down a bit
The systems in place allow for the older generations to retain power far past their prime
It‚Äôs not cool by any means
Ah yeah the drone strike thing is an ongoing issue with modern presidents.
Trump?
That has to account for something
All I know is that Biden is doing more in his first few months in office then Trump did in four years
Like you have no idea how badly trump ruined things.
But I do know Trump did a lot to dismantle the systems that would make processing immigrants easier
No defending that one
Well yeah there‚Äôs that
He‚Äôs just kinda eh
Now is a great guy? No way.
I tend to label people bad guys if they do things with malicious intent
But I wouldn‚Äôt label him a bad guy
Ok I understand he‚Äôs not doing the absolute best
I don‚Äôt see how he‚Äôs a bad guy though
The democrats tend to not really follow through with a lot of things for one reason or another. And I know Biden ain‚Äôt the best but at least people have been getting vaccinated thanks to him.
And I don‚Äôt feel like he‚Äôs one bad tantrum away from Armageddon.

The Trump years were a nightmare and then some
I hate the idea of becoming like that
Though should I ever become toxic somehow please strike me down
So yeah in many ways I feel like even when the bad times happen this fandom gets off lucky
And I think that‚Äôs good
We just all agree Symphogear good. Just why it‚Äôs good varies
And at least we all have different opinions but recognize they are valid in one way or another
And those that are bad are usually called out on pretty quickly
Some more brash than others but still nice
Like almost everyone I‚Äôve met since being in the Symphogear fandom has been genuinely nice
Great
I just felt a whole bunch of emotions hit me at once
Welp
That way it doesn‚Äôt bother anyone
I sometimes wish I could just lock my emotions deep inside me and never let them out
Or maybe I‚Äôm just being melodramatic.
Sometimes I wonder how can I be a truly forgiving person if there is one person I can‚Äôt forgive
Yeah
And I feel like a hypocrite everyday for it
That‚Äôs just it.
I try and forgive a lot of people for their transgressions.
But that man. That man I can never ever forgive
I should just let people have their fun
Sorry for rambling and getting off  track
Goddess I‚Äôm just rambling at this point
Or maybe he‚Äôs just as scumbag as ever
Maybe he‚Äôs changed after all these years
Honestly something I struggle with is should I even forgive my dad for all the stuff he pulled.
Things like abusing my mom, psychological and emotional manipulation of others.
Trying to get me to fight someone unprovoked
Yare yare
But I can‚Äôt help but have that feeling
And I feel like I should just suck it up and let people have their fun
So when I see others making light of bad men by associating them with things that are good and stuff.
It just irritates me
He is a bad man
So I can‚Äôt forgive him for anything
He left emotional scars I may never heal from
My dad hurt me
I don‚Äôt even know what I want to say
*sigh*
Also very true
And geezus..... parents should not harm their kids like that
Thanks Naraku
*hugs*
Your Nan is a moron
*Hugs tight*
*hugs*
*hugs*
üòì
*hugs*
<@!722121666641133608> remember. You have done nothing wrong and deserve happiness
Can‚Äôt talk much now. At work but I‚Äôll be back here soon
I understand the desire for getting things back to ‚ÄúNormal‚Äù but we shouldn‚Äôt be jumping the gun until everything is 100% clear!
Like are we on the honor system now?
*hugs*
*pat*
Geezus....
I need sleep.
Thanks Solo and Fenny
Until it explodes
I tend to bottle things in
That‚Äôs my flaw
I‚Äôll just keep drifting then
Yeah....
Not knowing what to do
My heart is making me freeze in place
*Smacks head on desk*
Thing is. The person I have a crush on is one of my roommates.
That‚Äôs true
But who‚Äôs gonna love a trans woman who enjoys mecha and magical anime to an unhealthy degree?
So I feel like it doesn‚Äôt matter
Thing is. I‚Äôve always wanted to be with a special someone.
To be loved on that level would make me so happy. But I know what I speak is a common thing
Petrified to do anything
Meanwhile I‚Äôm just over here like a lump
Maybe I can‚Äôt get over my jealous feelings with my sister. See she found the love of her life and is getting married next year.
And she‚Äôs younger than me
Goddess dammit I‚Äôm pathetic
I... I just want to be happy with a person I love
I have strong feelings of love for this person. But one I‚Äôm certain they said they aren‚Äôt looking for a relationship off the cuff at some point.
And two do I truly have feelings for this person? Or am I just deluding myself?
Rather
Is having a crush wrong?
Is
Yeah it does
Good luck <@!722121666641133608> !
Just saw this and yeah I hope all that‚Äôs needed is the form resubmitting
Oh geezus
Wouldn‚Äôt put it past her
I hope everything works out!
All I know is that when people do terrible things and oppress people like Minorities. Then something should be done to stop it
Yare yare
I think the view of the left being so broad in its approach that it‚Äôs easier for the unified right to attack it. Is one I have not considered before.
Even though the right as it stands is straight up harmful to the US.
Yup
But it‚Äôs not the case sadly
Yup
Not fun
Also the way society treats people who have been to jail. Even for minor infractions
It sucks ass
Even if the guy with the R is actively a terrible person and bad at their job
It‚Äôs so sinister in the effectiveness of it.
But I understand completely Gwyn.
I personally imagined Myself as the woman I *would* become
*pats*
Or some scenario like that
And then get sent to jail for not paying said bills
So you can‚Äôt pay your bills or anything
Then you can‚Äôt get a good job because you‚Äôre a ‚ÄúCriminal‚Äù
You go to jail for something so dumb it‚Äôs not your fault
And it perpetuates a system of violence
YOU GOT THIS!
GOOD LUCK
You‚Äôre welcome!
The ball is in your court but I know you got this!
If not I‚Äôm fist fighting Ireland
YOU WILL GET IT
I BELIEVE!
You got this!
Thank goddess!
<a:HibikiHug:656221774240808960>
*Hugs Tight*
I just caught up with everything
*Hugs*
I‚Äôm just some thing!
I don‚Äôt pass as a woman
I am so stressed and self conscience of my looks
But I am ugly though
I‚Äôm fat, ugly, annoying and why does anyone put up with me?
I don‚Äôt want to talk about it more other than I‚Äôm an ugly fool of a woman who‚Äôll never ever find love
Or rather I‚Äôm still crying
I just cried for ten minutes straight
I wish you nothing but the best
It really does
That I didn‚Äôt know
Ah
It‚Äôs like that DA is gonna catch hell for this I‚Äôm sure
Yeah
*hug*
I‚Äôm very sorry to hear that..
Damn
Poor babies!
Like geezus how does that guy keep getting work?
It really is
Posting this here because it‚Äôs a real world issue. But yikes
https://twitter.com/anime/status/1422976892060278792?s=21
Ah okey dokey
It happens to the best of us.
As long as you are sorry and want to be better. Then it‚Äôs all good friend.
Welcome back Matt
Now whiter than ever
Yup
I am ashamed
Time to burn the system to the ground
Fuck everything
I hope they are ok‚Ä¶
I never interacted with them much.
But I enjoyed the conversations we did have‚Ä¶
Geezus
Gwyn passed away? Geezus‚Ä¶.
May she Rest In Peace üôèüòì
I hope she‚Äôs ok
I‚Äôm glad she‚Äôs alive üôè‚ù§Ô∏è
Gwyn I never once thought you‚Äôre a horrible person.
Whatever troubles you‚Äôre going through we are here for you‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
But alas at the end of the day I think the person who realized how badly they screwed up is Will himself. 
And at the end of the day this is just a drop in the bucket compared to other things going on in the world rn
The way I see it is while violence shouldn‚Äôt have been his answer. It‚Äôs not like I don‚Äôt get that feeling of wanting to deck someone for talking smack about someone you love.

What I find funny is the academy is getting mad over the slap. And not like the other members of its organization who have done objectively worse things.
Something about this makes me chuckle

Setsuna is my son and I love him
I‚Äôve already adopted Setsuna F Seiei. What‚Äôs a few more robot lads gonna hurt?
<@!468591607332208641> that‚Äôs a me watching j decker but I can‚Äôt right now cuz I‚Äôm at work<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
J-DECKEEEEER!
Currently checking out Brave Police J-Decker
https://twitter.com/admiralblue5/status/1333906167312101376?s=21
Need to really catch up but I have so much other stuff to do <:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
I‚Äôve missed the last several weeks of anime watching
Also this weekend me and the roommates are watching Gundam Seed after finishing The Big O
US
It‚Äôs $400

But hey what‚Äôs a few lost limbs for a Mazinger ZERO figure am I right?
ITS $400

https://youtu.be/Nuvca6MPO0s
Can‚Äôt wait for these HG‚Äôs to come out!
What‚Äôs the problem here?
Saint Seiya is pretty rad from what little I‚Äôve gleamed from it
Touma needs a break man
Lexi said with enthusiasm denoting fun
Misaka is top tier
Yes
Stan Mikoto Misaka
Anyone a fan of the Toaru series?
Miku gets tamamo‚Äôs outfit
<:ChrisAngry:336656958272700417> WHY IS THIS CHILD TALKING LIKE AN ADULT AND ALSO DRINKING?
‚ÄúHEY! It‚Äôs not MY fault you‚Äôre tone deaf! My singing is akin to angels cheering!‚Äù
*Shows several SONG personnel on the ground in pain*
Maria is wondering what the godawful singing is
Elizabeth meeting Maria
Oh even worse
Miku is confused by the arrival of this fox girl
Tamamo meets Miku
*Neros eyes light up as the prospect of more cute girls intrigues her*
<:HibikiThink:688429715362414641> Uuum you seem nice lady but can stop hugging me I have to go meet my friends....
Poor Hibiki would be attacked by Nero hugs
When Nero sees someone is cute she wants them
Nero would see all the cute girls and adopt them
‚ÄúAnd you‚Äôre cute. And you‚Äôre cute. And you‚Äôre cute....‚Äù
Nero meets the Gears
UMU
Morning fam
<@!87512939107450880> it‚Äôs more of an issue of jog not enough time in the day
I haven‚Äôt read the LN‚Äôs but I will when I have the free time
From monster, to villain, to anti hero, to a hero in his own way
Also I feel Accelerator has one heck of a character arc throughout everything
Plus her teleport powers are no joke
But she‚Äôs dedicated to her job and I respect that
Kuroko annoyed me at first
Plus I love Mikoto‚Äôs friends
Like you see the index side and see the bigger threats at play from the magic side.
But the Railgun side has all the shady science stuff happening
But that‚Äôs just me
I think Index as a whole as great world building
Space is warped and time is bendable
S3 wasn‚Äôt the best adapted I‚Äôll tell you that
WHY
Granted it‚Äôs a compilation of stories. But it‚Äôs still something!
This is the first time the lupin manga is getting any sort of English localization
https://twitter.com/gomanga/status/1335020485961199617?s=21
ITS SHOWTIME!
Watching The Big O‚Äôs second season
Ha!
I really do feel for Kira‚Äôs character
He‚Äôs not
At least from what I‚Äôve seen so far in SEED.
He‚Äôs not Jesus
*Nods in agreement*
I can respect that
And you‚Äôre right The SEED Mobile suits are awesome!
Kira Yamato is my son and I‚Äôm adopting him
SEED destiny is the one that if someone hates then it‚Äôs cool
SEED
Gundam Seed gets Waaaaaaaaay too much hate if you ask me
Nunally needs more love
Hype
I saw
I wanna try and one shot bosses with her
I‚Äôm buffing one of his knights

Oh to celebrate Lelouch day
I‚Äôll judge for myself
After Seed me and the mates plan to do IBO
But Destiny is in the far future
But from what I heard the main writer got sick. And the people that came in to replace her didn‚Äôt know what they were doing
I still plan to see destiny
Like she‚Äôs so good
I would defend Sumeragi with my life
For it‚Äôs his birthday today
ALL HAIL EMPEROR LELOUCH!
Also

I‚Äôve only seen one episode of Seed and I‚Äôm declaring Murrue Raimus as my other Gundam Waifu. Right up there with Sumeragi Lee Noriega.
Gundam Seed time baby!
The Big O is hecking awesome!
THAT SCENE WAS CUTE
While nothing was outright confirmed the amount of references was too coincidental to ignore
https://youtu.be/JXOq4x8o290
Like Akane is Nega Prime
Like all the characters colors from SSSS. Gridman were allusions to past transformers
There‚Äôs allusions to transformers all over Gridman
I think my roommate said Wingsaber but yes
Dyna Dragon can become armor for Gridman.
And the head/middle section became a giant fire cannon of death
And God Zenon
The original Dyna Dragon
AIRS IN APRIL
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bu_qmpa43h4
Really enjoyed SSSS.GRIDMAN so I am excited for this!
First look at the robot mode
SSSS.DYNAZENON
My Gundam Waifus
My favorite Gundam of all time and my favorite anime will always be G Gundam
I like Relena but again I can see why others wouldn‚Äôt
Fair enough
They are so unique and different from what we‚Äôve seen before
I respect the turn A and the designs
I personally like it. But I can understand otherwise
And Wing is either you love or dislike it
Turn A I heard is really really good
After War Gundam X for example? Damn good stuff
Enough to have a better grasp on what to recommend to people
I‚Äôve seen a lot a LOT of Gundam
I really like 00 tbh. But hey To each their own
I prefer the alternate continuity Gundam shows
But as a whole it‚Äôs overrated
Truth be told the UC timeline has some good in it.
So yeah enjoy what you enjoy! üëå<:GermainCool:736523122324275309>
I really liked IBO‚Äôs first season!
No that is totally totally understandable and I respect that!
The second season I heard wasn‚Äôt as good as the first
I‚Äôve only season IBO‚Äôs first season
Yeah I said it
Better than a majority of UC timeline shows I‚Äôve seen
I‚Äôm just having fun watching this for the first time!
Rip her
Kanade
And in a show involving singing magical girls it works
After being used you‚Äôll either die or be out out of commission
Like it‚Äôs the ultimate move. The curtain call
Yeah right?
Swan Song
In the Symphogear blu ray released by discotek they said ‚ÄúSunbeam‚Äù instead of ‚Äúsunshine‚Äù
To me as long as the same meaning and feeling comes across then it‚Äôs all good
In cases like ‚ÄúSunbeam‚Äù or ‚ÄúSunshine‚Äù they convey the same meaning
And maaaaaan do they go through some hoops for the shows they put on blu ray
Discotek tends to know what the fans want.
I have faith that‚Äôll be announced if not next week. Then within a few months
Heck it seems almost every other month Symphogear makes it to the top seller list on rightstuf
I‚Äôm certain they are aware how popular those sets are
What are you all hoping comes to Blu ray? For me gimme dat GaoGaiGar blu ray!

And I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if they announced Symphogear GX
So discotek is doing more anime title reveals on the 14th
Sukeban Deka goes waaaaay back
Huh
https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2020-12-07/sukeban-deka-gets-2-new-manga-in-january-february/.167157
Then that‚Äôs all that matters
The thing about a collection is that as long as YOU are proud of it
Nice nice
Come on Discotek gimmie what I want
Layzner blu ray when
CHAINSAW MAN
CHAINSAW MAN
CHAINSAW MAN
https://twitter.com/karoshimyriad/status/1336585287422525440?s=21
Oh and the 009 blu ray also contains the never seen Gods War OVA
Yeah The anime perfectly captures Shotaro‚Äôs style
Hope that answers your question <@676272618839605249>
The fact that discotek rescued the anime at all is amazing because it was so close to being lost forever
And a lot of episodes after the initial arc are more like sci fi stories of the week
It‚Äôs a story of how 9 individuals despite having the worst thing imaginable happen to them band together to save the world from Black Ghost
It‚Äôs a modern adaptation of the OG manga by Shotaro Ishinomori
It doesn‚Äôt follow a typical anime arc format per se
Totally worth it
Though I want the Brave series on blu ray
Nanoha blu ray as well
https://twitter.com/discotekmedia/status/1336385533258317824?s=21
I hope the man enjoys his retirement!
Keaton Yamada was the voice of Hayato in the original Getter Robo anime!
Oh snap

The one where she went Gundam Double X satellite cannon
Some more than others but still
Sure they may mess up on the occasion. But they put out titles other bigger fish companies ignore. And they put as much special features as they can into each release
But back on point I think discotek is my favorite anime company working right now
Like she was out for a good chunk of time
But at least it messed up Tsubasa for awhile
Or *Gets hit with a brick*
Or Go Lion
Or Combattler V
Or Ronin Warriors
It‚Äôs called Symphogear
Yeah it does
Sus
Magic Knight Rayearth is good
Nitocris 2 cute

Every single time they f*ck it up somewhere
Funimation can not release DBZ properly to save their life
Important development
The movie cut of Diebuster cuts out an entire episode of character development
But we can agree that it‚Äôs still awesome right?
I saw the movie cut first
I just wish I could‚Äôve seen the ova version of Diebuster
I mean I will say the Super Double Inazuma kick was cool
It totally aged well if you ask me
That‚Äôs the version I saw
I can‚Äôt say that I hate Diebuster because the movie compilation did it no favors
Lol
Point is Gunbuster is awesome
No really Noriko has to fight deadly space monsters in a giant robot while fighting at light speeds
Oh and the aliens they fight? They are flying at light speeds
But with some confidence boosting and a fire in her heart. She becomes an absolute badass who‚Äôs HAAAAARD COOORE
She goes from a crying girl who can‚Äôt do anything right
Pilots the Gunbuster with her Onee Sama
Stan Noriko
And then after it it‚Äôs influence can be found in tons of other anime
It‚Äôs that OVA that was already sending up super robots of the past and present.
It‚Äôs only 6 episodes long and was complied into a movie format. If you haven‚Äôt seen it I highly recommend it
An OVA series from the 90‚Äôs directed by Hideaki Anno is a sci-fi story that is both over the top and ridiculous beyond words.

But also contains real life science elements to give the work a sense of dread
GUN
BUSTEEEEER

Gunbuster is so hard core
Anyways back to other things with me
In general
I dislike Movie compilations
I think so? It‚Äôs been a minute
Yeah because the finale doesn‚Äôt make as much sense without the development between the two main leads
It feels like something is missing
I think it would‚Äôve been episode 2?
Like wtf why remove that?
Honestly most JoJo OPs are pretty lit
Part 5 has great OP‚Äôs
Who made roundabout?
Yes.
No I mean who is singing this?
Yes!
It‚Äôs a good song
Roundabout?
Jojo is amazing
Stop Cyber Newtype abuse
Marida Cruz is a good girl who did nothing wrong
Honestly the funnier parts of jojo are when you get context for the memes. And then realize oh wait jojo is more than dank memes
Which is funny because he doesn‚Äôt say it as often as memes would have you believe
Here‚Äôs hopin
Curses
Part 6 when
If you have questions we are here to help
I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôll click for you at some point
No need to rush
Take your time with it though
But the themes and ideas carry from one part to the next
Jojo is a generational story
Hate or love SEED.
Destiny is the one that is disliked
Which seems to be the consensus
I‚Äôm heard even fans of SEED dislike destiny for various reasons s
Which is fair
And I‚Äôll decide for myself what becomes of Kira until I watch it. Which won‚Äôt be for awhile because I‚Äôm waiting for the blu ray of it
I‚Äôm just talking about just SEED
The claim he of him being Jesus is over exaggerated and I will die on this hill
He never dies though and took a good chunk of time to recover
I‚Äôm just saying that the feats Kira has. Doesn‚Äôt constitute Jesus status for me
Heero Yuy survived his Gundam self destructing and smacking the ground below.
Shirou Amada dodged a mobile suit shot from point blank range when he‚Äôs not a newtype.

The entire endings of CCA and Unicorn with the psycho frame newtype stuff
Gundam protags have done just as much ridiculous stuff
He got out just in time and was blasted away from the explosion
No he‚Äôs not
It‚Äôs good
Finished Gundam SEED
If you‚Äôre that deep into something and nothing is enjoyable then drop it
Just leave it
Catarina is such a relatable character r
I really hope My next life as a villainess comes to blu ray
<@143369379042689025> would you say yes to Makima?
Chainsaw Man is a 10/10 manga
Can‚Äôt wait for part 2
Can‚Äôt wait!
It‚Äôs quite a story
Oh and look up the production history of Nadia
But he‚Äôs supportive of Nadia no matter what
Jean goes through some stuff man
Yup
Haven‚Äôt seen season 1 in ages
Watching Iron Blooded Orphans
Yeeeeeah Marie‚Äôs parents are with the angels now
Lulz
*Watches the fight from on top her Getter Robo*
I love seeing Kongo in action
I love Mikoto‚Äôs supporting characters
Railgun is good
They got slammed
Between that and OPM Season 2 yeah
Yeah that‚Äôs bad
For no real reason.
It really feels even more crammed then before
Yeah in adaptation
I think it does it‚Äôs job decently
The anime isn‚Äôt that bad
Continue enjoying Nadia
Anyway
Powerful
Symphogear reaches hearts and minds across the globe
Damn
Nice
So you live in Italy then?
Heero Yuy doing Italian disco
My brain is melting
Oh god
HOW?
What did they do?
What?
Great anime
Yeah
What‚Äôs next? Get Her Bobo?
Pure Galaxy brain
Galaxy brain
Were they high?
Like how do you get Rock from water?
Also the OP is pretty nice
That is super cursed dude
Make no mistake
Oh yeah Nadia when it‚Äôs good it‚Äôs *Gooood*
You‚Äôll see
Then island arc
Yeah Nadia gets good and good
Still cool though
Beats me
How are they that strong?
Yeah he did
And I like how Jean is just a supportive lad
When the big bad knows what‚Äôs up it‚Äôs time to confess my dude
It‚Äôs hilarious
Everyone effing knows how Jean feels
Like it ain‚Äôt no secret
I like ship captains like him
But I really like Nemo
That is who they are referencing/ taking inspiration by
That wasn‚Äôt an accident
The amount of strong female red heads in anime can‚Äôt be a coincidence
Strong female red heads are great
Grandis is better
That‚Äôs what I mean
She knows exactly what she wants. And honestly girl GET IT
Like Jessie from team rocket
Grandis the best
I wonder if any complaints you have will be the same as mine
So Mileage may vary on the accuracy of this but
It‚Äôs Wikipedia

The Ghibli man
Hayao Miyazaki
As a ghost writer
Miyazaki worked on Nadia
Allegedly could be wrong on this
You get what I‚Äôm feeling right?
I was blown away by how much of of Combattler V was seen in later works.
Like the semi serialized Storytelling, the character drama etc
That‚Äôs like Galaxy brain obscure
Or the history of it
I just love seeing the evolution of a genre
Well at least discotek is putting out classic stuff
And Full Metal Panic!
I think for me I‚Äôll eventually watch Every mecha and/or Super robot show ever produced
I wish more shows utilized an underwater submarine
That episode was pretty nice
Memories should be fun
You kids don‚Äôt know about the classics and it shows
Going to have to get this one since I have Combattler V and Voltes V
Gonna pick this one up for sure
All we can do now is buy the physical release and show our support
I hope so too
So if that‚Äôs any indication G will do just as well
S1 kept hitting the top sales charts on rightstuf
No other than buy Symphogear
EVEN THOUGH THOSE TWO THINGS ARE KEEPING HER FRIENDS ALIVE
Basically Nadia will keep driving home the point that eating meat and technology is bad.
There‚Äôs a worse one after that
Nope
Did you know eating meat makes you worse than satan
Again hold onto your butt for the island arc
EYUP
People are here to help you!
Like girl chill the eff out!
But it‚Äôs non stop
<@!87512939107450880> I will tell you SRW X fixes Nadia‚Äôs character
The island arc takes that and ramps it to 11
Eeeeeeeyup
Sad poor lady whos like ‚ÄúFuck this I‚Äôm gonna get rich by any means necessary!‚Äù
Oooooh <@!279341087494242304> my friend.
I try and be very kind to even shows I really dislike. Like Gundam victory for example
I have many stories on my shelf
But seriously I‚Äôm proud of my collection
Agreed
Don‚Äôt @ me unless you‚Äôve seen these anime‚Äôs

I‚Äôm a cultured person what can I say?
I‚Äôm obliged
I‚Äôm a Fate fan
Iron Blooded Orphans Season 1 and Build Fighters Try are on another shelf


Strap yourselves in
Ok
Well anime and mixed media collection?
Who wants to see Lexi‚Äôs anime collection?
So
But as time goes on the difference between what‚Äôs real and fantasy gets more blurry as the legend of Slugger gets out of control
It‚Äôs about a supposed maniac named Little Slugger that goes around hitting people with a baseball bat
A 12 episode anime from the late legendary director Satoshi Kon
So.
Have you all heard the legend of Little Slugger?
No I meant a bitch
For I am one
I should know
Bitches love gunpla
Gunpla
That‚Äôs how you attract the Greek witch
Finally these arrived today

WHAT A NOVEL EFFING CONCEPT!
GIRL GROW UP! GOD! PEOPLE HAVE DIFFERENT TASTES AND IDEAS FROM YOU!
But Nadia?
And people important to Kamille keep kicking the bucket
Grandis and Nemo are pretty top if you ask me
So yeah he may whine but he‚Äôs suffering constantly
At least Kamille‚Äôs life went to crap. And everyone and their uncle kept smack talking the kid
Oh then yeah Nadia is a brat
I‚Äôd give it a 7 out of 10
Nadia is not THAT bad
Maybe we should‚Äôve spent more time focusing on Nemo and Gargoyles rivalry or something
The last few episodes of Nadia are legit good again
BUT there is hope
Quite a number of episodes
<@!87512939107450880> hold onto your butts
And we don‚Äôt learn why she‚Äôs like this until it‚Äôs far too late
She goes full PETA
That‚Äôs my head canon
Ange married Hilda and Tusk after the series
Like suck it you multi universal DBag!
That was such a CHAD move
THAT WAS AMAZING
Also Hotel Mu La Flaga
Unable
Tusk is a good supporting role.
And embryo is a despicable villain
Like a society telling females what they should or shouldn‚Äôt be
Also anyone notice that this is a world where unless you are the prim and proper example of a little girl. Then you‚Äôre ostracized
Ange going from princess to fuck the patriarchy is amazing
It‚Äôs very explicit and risqu√© at times sure.
But I feel that all the violence is used to showcase how messed up the world is
Dare I say great?
Oh and Cross Ange is good
But for those that do pull it off become legendary
Very few shows can really pull of the myth arcs beyond season 5.
Story arc stuff
Just not as good
I mean they weren‚Äôt bad
After season 5 they really dropped the ball
But my sister did
No
Own the complete series on blu ray
Of course
DS9 is GOAT
I‚Äôd also like to own Star Trek: Deep Space Nine the series one day
But I heard good things
Oh my goddess? I haven‚Äôt seen it
Show me your favs
So Solo
That show is the bomb
I want the complete series of Psych though
Season 1 yes
Just tell me a good story and I‚Äôll be happy
It‚Äôs the complete series
I have many tastes and interests
My name is Alexis or Lexi If you prefer
Yup
Now if a show is someone‚Äôs genuine fav. I probably won‚Äôt agree with it.
But if it means something special to someone then who am I to judge?
Go for it
Real shame Supernatural ended after five seasons
But if something is truly sh*t to me? I unleash fury
Lol
<@!87512939107450880> i told you she was gonna get worse
SHES PULLING THAT CARD
EYUP
üò≠
LET US DREAM DAMMIT
Imagine. The fourth  rebuild EVA movie will come out before Half life 3
https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2020-12-16/final-evangelion-film-wraps-compositing-editing-work/.167521
Meaning shipping them would be not cool city
Well half sisters but still biologically related
Actual sisters
Embryo: NOOOOOO YOU CANT REJECT MY ADVANCES ANGE!

Ange: Haha Villkiss go brrrrrrrr
I saw the dub and Vivian is voiced by the same person who voice Makoto Misaka from Railgun
Oh I loved Vivian
Be gay do crimes as they say
Honestly the part that really made me empathize for Ange was when she and Hilda tried going back home again
It doesn‚Äôt get any worse after that at least
Yeah
I heard about it thanks to SRW V
Symphogear x Cross Ange event when
Of course she‚Äôd get the bisexual harem ending
Ange is a Nana Mizuki character
Yay you right
IBO Season 1 is teaching me to never take escort missions ever
Yeah totally understandable
The logic of eating meat or using tech makes you evil is so dumb!
Like you don‚Äôt wanna say ‚ÄúF*ck this kid!‚Äù But Nadia you be testing everyone‚Äôs patience!
it is so frustrating
So I found something neat at half price books
I just love how Guy is just that much of a friendly person. There‚Äôs no act or irony to him
Guy is the person you take to PTA meetings to impress the teachers
Evil doers
They‚Äôd be friends
Prisma AU Shirou is pretty badass
To even more worse
Aka the part where things go from bad to worse
Ooooh yeah!
Is that a second movie?
IBO Season 1 is still pretty good
Then feed your local Weiss
<@209536346413465600>
Followed by Penny
Also Weiss is best RWBY girl
I did
Noice <@297542051057238017>
Black Rose Dragon is always useful
The singer dragons are awesome

I stan a rose clad psychic duel queen
Aki Izayoi is a queen
And yet there was that time we spent all their money buying a fancy outfit he only wore once
Can be dumb as a brick.
But yet have the pride and cunning of a true king of the arena
That man is a Himbo
Though I love Jack Atlas
Yusei takes no sh*ts
And the final arc stuff is amazing
Dark Signers arc is legit great
5D‚Äôs is good
Rip
Yeah that was nice
My favorite entires are GX, 5D‚Äôs and Arc-V
Read and re read it all the time in middle school
That arc was fun
Anyone here a YuGiOh fan?
Off topic but
Black wings were both fun and a mistake
Weiss judging you as you hand her a measly peanut butter sandwich
I love her
*Eats pizza and watches the sparks fly*
Don‚Äôt let Kazanari hear that
Lexi said with a hint of hesitation
Is love live worth getting into?
Oh yes thank you for the food
But in the English release of cyber sleuth she became sistermon Blu or something like that
The digimon is Sistermon Noir
The censors in America are weak
Lol
In fact let me do just that just to be safe
I can move it there
BelleStarMon
And tusk is just chilling off to the side glad to be there
I need an image of Ange and Hilda saying ‚ÄúYeah we gay keep scrolling‚Äù
<@!87512939107450880>
Genius
A hot gun toting nun is a digimon
Sistermon exists

Why?
Digimon is good
Judau is anime Michael J Fox
There we go

Tamers is great
*Rocket punch‚Äôs you before vaporizing with a Breast Fire*
Well fudge it lets GO SOLO!
Fudge
No one needs to know that
Sush
We fight each other but only have five cities and a dairy farm are destroyed do we settle down . Learn the meaning of friendship and the cows we killed along the way
<@!279341087494242304> fight me nerd
By leagues and miles better than divers
SAYLA MASS BEST UNIVERSAL CENTURY GIRL
ReRise is so good

No really
It‚Äôs called Build Divers ReRise
*Trans ams*
GUUUUUUUUNDAAAAAA DAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Ore wa
They mean a lot to me!
And I just freaking love robots!
The mecha genre has stories that have wildly different ranges
But yes my hope is to rep every mecha series in some capacity
That was at a half price books store
Piracy go brrrrrr
I want King Gainer on blu ray already!
GAH!
THEY WERE MISSING THE LAST VOLUME!

I still love that
For reals Discotek is the best licensing company working right now.
If they are working on a title you can bet they will work on it as hard as they can.
Can‚Äôt be any worse than the last one
And I‚Äôll make it my mission to have a copy of every mecha series I care about
I love archiving media personally
And have little special features
Or something bull
But then aniplex is like lol give us $250 for 12 episodes
Sounds reasonable
Aniplex can go eff right off with its practices
YUP
But it‚Äôll feel like forever
Indeed
Hard disagree and I like ZZ
And rewatching Season 1 made me realize how lived in the world was
I love the idea of the calamity war
At least the setting
IBO I think is good
So legally no
She‚Äôs a kid
It‚Äôs basically the UC timeline but none of the Tomino BS
Gundam X is good
Or will make you go ‚ÄúREALLY? THATS YOUR REASON?‚Äù
Nadias reason for not eating meat is either incredibly understandable
And try not to lose your mind
Just keep watching
IT WAS ALL JUST A DREAM!
Why?
But I remember an entire episode of the island arc meaning nothing
I can‚Äôt remember
Mhm!
You‚Äôll either empathize
Wait until you find out why Nadia hates eating meat
DONT DRAG EVERYONE ELSE DOWN WITH YOU!
Like girl what is your damage?
MHM
Kuro no!
Omfg
Kira has Lacus Clyne
He doesn‚Äôt romance his sister
No he doesn‚Äôt
Very comfy
I think Arcueid is neat

Arcuied is bae
Good video
The remake will never happen now
But alas
Very popular
I actually like the idea that Tsukihime and FSN take place in the same universe but different cities
And it was their make it or break it VN
Yeah
You got a link for that art?
Shes earned my respect
Kuroko ain‚Äôt half bad
Seriously this OP is a BOP
I can‚Äôt wait for discotek to release this anime
https://youtu.be/Uq_TD0_2_1s
I think she‚Äôs great no matter the season tbh
I stan one Psychic bug zapper
Imagine being the fool that thinks Makoto Misaka is a bad character
I love her
I call this ‚ÄúWaifu vision‚Äù
https://twitter.com/waywarddrawz/status/1344402626713153537?s=21
My current vacation is kinda drying me out
I‚Äôm gonna pick up the LN‚Äôs when I can
Can you elaborate in spoilers section?
Oh?
Is that the bad clone?
Wether she‚Äôs Tsun or not. She‚Äôs just fun to be around
Listen Mikoto Misaka is a great character
So I‚Äôm going to yeet myself to the moon
But no new tsukihime news
THEY HAVE RETURNED
https://twitter.com/karoshimyriad/status/1344647814714806274?s=21
Thank you Melua
Don‚Äôt misgender me
Her
But I know people who love SEED but dislike destiny
In SEED at least
I will also take this to my grave: Kira ain‚Äôt Jesus
The Freedom is one fast machine
I disagree.
I loved the moment when the freedom came swooping in to save the Archangel
I will take that to my grave
I still contend that SEED is good
Possibly
Kira could easily become a killing machine if he wanted to
The strike freedom is pretty op
SHIROU

Lets just call them Gundams and call it a day. No sense in getting a headache over the minutiae
I love the Turn A and Barbatos for pushing the boundaries of what a Gundam should look like
I love the turn A
I love the Barbatos Gundam simply because it so doesn‚Äôt look like a traditional Gundam
So at some point you just gotta cut your losses
I should say realistic not cynical
That‚Äôs the cynical way of looking at it.
And honestly you‚Äôre not wrong
Really what makes a Gundam is a topic for debate till the end of time
I think a ‚ÄúV‚Äù fin of some kind, the blue and white colors, or does it have a Gundam frame. Makes a unit a ‚ÄúGundam‚Äù
I think some things have to be let go.
Otherwise you‚Äôll go crazy
Or rather it‚Äôs never said but I count it
It is used
I have the MG of the destiny and it‚Äôs one solid build
And the Destiny Gundam itself ain‚Äôt half bad
I think the Cosmic era had some really awesome unit designs
At least we can all agree destiny is a problematic entry in the Gundam series
Because I watched SEED and Kira was ‚ÄúRight‚Äù‚Äômost times. Everybody had egg on their face
Which I think is what drove people crazy with destiny
I do like how in SEED Kira gets the emotional stuffing knocked out of him
My top 3 are: G, 00, and X
And you know what? I really like seed but it‚Äôs not in my top 3 series
I don‚Äôt want to ignore it‚Äôs story
But I still want to watch Destiny because it‚Äôs still a part of the franchise that did indeed happen
So that I can agree with
I know of peeps that love SEED but dislike destiny in one way or the other
But yeah anyway
Luckily I think after the island arc things pick back up again
But texture is not the reason.
Or at least it‚Äôs not the only reason
Ok
You want spoilers?
Nope
You poor soul
Oh
Yee
FUMOFFU!
I know the Tentomon line has some awesome as heck evolutions
Technically yes
Oh you are completely right. And the final form being examon is cool!
Well the original Isekai as we know started with Aura Battler Dunbine
My fav digimon lines are from Tamers
TyrantKabuterimon

Also the evolutions are way cooler just sayin
Like you can talk with an agumon
and are capable of speech
It‚Äôs so funny
Imagine Breaker literally says nope to Magic and science bs
Mikoto Misaka is best Girl
Something as small as a coin being fired like a railgun will still cause a ton of damage and force
Uiharu is a good girl
I just love her flowers and the mad hacking skills she has
And all almost gave myself massive spoilers just by looking her up
I think she‚Äôs just need
I love Uiharu
Rosemon is like queen
She does have a very nice evolution line
Yes
Mikoto emoticons?
Mikoto is gonna win obviously
Idk.....
A spin off about Misaki?
The mad lad
And with the series outside of an episode towards the end that has a ‚ÄúWTF?‚Äù Reveal that comes out of nowhere. It‚Äôs pretty good
Nice
At least from what I‚Äôve seen so far
It is fan service-y but nothing outlandish that you haven‚Äôt seen before
This show is insane and I‚Äôm liking it!
Watching Godannar
SLAM DUNK MOVIE LETS GO
https://twitter.com/wsj_manga/status/1347028968629698565?s=21
Exactly
But by the point we learn the information I feel Nadia as a character has already irritated the audience
It‚Äôs like I relate to it
I know right?
XD
Bunny cat needs to die
She had a good head on her shoulders
I mean. At least Mami always kept her head on straight
<@266379640069685252> The pain will only continue. MUAHHAHAHAHAHA
The pain train has begun
First time?
I‚Äôm a spider now so what?
Kinda makes you wonder why did they choose NOW to finally have the plot be relevant or super interesting again
Homura uses gun magic
Of Madoka?
What did you think?
It stands alone as an anime.
Build Fighters is a great choice
The newer stuff usually takes place in their own continuities
That‚Äôs why going with the newer stuff is preferable
Point is I simp for Haman Karn
And I do recommend checking out Gundam at some point
But people just really like Haman
I keep imaging Miku but with Qubeley armor
Pilots the Mobile suit known as The Qubeley
Absolute queen who wants to see Zeon and Axia prosper
<@740195087895756820> Haman Karn is a badass bitch from Zeta and ZZ Gundam
You can‚Äôt have tragedy 24/7
Just two gals being more than pals and overcoming life obstacles
A wholesome yuri where nothing bad happens. World doesn‚Äôt end
RIP
Nadia?
Will watch that later today
Wait Funimation has it never mind
Aka the code Geass guy
Yeah Back Arrow is directed by Goro Taniguchi
It
Because I want to watch
And I live in the states and I don‚Äôt know who‚Äôs streaming it yet
That‚Äôs because it has the same writer as TTGL
Yeah not defending that one
He‚Äôs so chunky and I love it
The Double Zeta is dope for me
That‚Äôs how I watched it
Yup
Plus it‚Äôs hype as hell
And if you see Gundams you like you can check out the source material
Kobyashi‚Äôs Dragon maid season 2 in February let‚Äôs go!
Money spent on this could‚Äôve gone elsewhere
That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm sayin
Instead of paying translators more?
You spent money on this
Just what?
Not even funny bad
Like bad bad
Like holy crap that looks bad
Was that
What the ever loving fudge
I usually give a new thing 3 or five episodes to hook me
Ah yes
Can‚Äôt wait to see where it goes
Back Arrow‚Äôs first episode wasn‚Äôt half bad
And yeah learning Kyoani did FMP at one point in time is crazy to think about
Bonta Kun is life
FUMOFFU!
Oh and the friends you meet along the way can help propel you to new heights
That being: Gunpla is Awesome, and Gundam in general is awesome
But Build Fighters may not be the best anime out there. It does however absolutely nail what it‚Äôs going for. And I think that‚Äôs awesome
Lol
He wasn‚Äôt exactly all there
Yes
I feel further discussion should be moved to spoilers
And if Ruby was up front then what?
Only it‚Äôd be a much faster process getting there
Also considering Ironwoods actions as of late even if Ruby came out and said what was happening. Ironwood would still lose his sh*t
United we stand divided we fall
That‚Äôs the story parallel
Sure the Ace Ops were factual stronger but they didn‚Äôt really work together as best as they could
RWBY had far better synergy
It‚Äôs called teamwork
Alia is so cute
Knew you‚Äôd like it
But man do they do a piss poor job of marketing it over here
I know LBX is a model kit line
He has more of a pirate kinda vibe now
Yup!
But I love the theme music that plays when it appears
It was designed to be an homage to the Yamato
So you saw the N-Nautilus and all it‚Äôs glory?
But I want to gush about things
I don‚Äôt want to spoil things
Nadia
Cuz I want to gush about a thing that shows up
What was the last thing you saw?
Oh Um
And it honestly fits pretty well
That whole last arc is why it‚Äôs one of the core plots in X
Yup
Yeah it does
J-Decker, Layzner, Macross Delta.....
I got so many anime‚Äôs I need to finish
Tieria got game
https://twitter.com/yguncannon/status/1349854220430700545?s=21
Would they be battleship or normal class though?
I KNOW
And you can see how other series can integrate with it and not feel weird
There‚Äôs equal parts good and bad to it
That‚Äôs about what me and my friends thought
But I‚Äôm gonna pick up Hajime no Ippo, Fujiko Mine, The Lupin special, and Submarine Super 99
Can‚Äôt pre order rn because I‚Äôll be moving in a month or two
Nothing super crazy but still decent stuff
DISCOTEK DAY
https://twitter.com/wtk/status/1349796144549924869?s=21
LETS GO
Fork Toei for what they did to Go Nagai
Oh Gaiking
Turns out Voltes V is a big thing in the Philippines
Yeah I saw
They were too afraid of his/their power
IBO Season 1 was good. Mikazuki got game
<@722121666641133608>
Yeah posting this here again.
But my top five anime of all time are.
1: Mobile Fighter G Gundam
2: Symphogear (All seasons)
3: Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion.
4: Fate/Stay Night: Unlimited Blade Works.
5: JoJo‚Äôs Bizarre Adventure(All parts)
In the end game now
Persona 4 the animation is pretty good
But I do know about several anime I otherwise wouldn‚Äôt have heard of it weren‚Äôt for him
I don‚Äôt know anything about that
<@208724042025402369>
https://youtu.be/RuZ_pe5GFLA
But as a character I see what her role in the story was
I still don‚Äôt like her as a person
Or verbal destroy flay
Lacus would probably either show Empathy
Because the bad guy is a psychopath that‚Äôs why
Because yeah start of series Flay was totally racist towards coordinators
Yeah but it was not after a lot of character development and realizing how much she hurt the kid.
You can add Kira to the list of Mecha protags that have canonically did the thing
Yeah it was kinda a moment where he need comfort and Flay was being manipulative at the time
Back Arrow episode 2 was pretty good!
üëç
https://twitter.com/carlikun/status/1350724218518863872?s=21
The English Dub is pretty good!
Well if you can watch it
Watch Magic Knight Rayearth
Lina Inverse is a queen we should all stan
https://youtu.be/NIuVO1SsFYs
I feel they compliment each other well
Touma is pretty alright in my book
Poggers
Long live the queen!
And it‚Äôs Nana Mizuki‚Äôs birthday today
I love everything about this

That would‚Äôve been interesting to see
Gerrod Ran is a badassp
Gundam X is so good
Assert dominance
I was talking in general
It will be
Imagine being a fool that thinks GaoGaiGar isn‚Äôt a good design
THAT LOOKS SO GOOD
The devil Gundam you say?
Sunrise and godlike animation?
But Dunbine is really good!
Ok In the main show they never fight dragons
Watch Aura Battler Dunbine
https://twitter.com/littlemucha2017/status/1352383722935508992?s=21
Heh
Oh and there‚Äôs a ||battleship||
But a bit more happy
Gives me Gun x Sword vibes
Pretty good!
Back Arrow episode 3
Asuka Eiji is my son
So we deserve crap?
Aaaaw

https://twitter.com/crunchyroll/status/1353773527963467776?s=21
I must‚Äôve listened to Hironobu Kageyama‚Äôs cover of that so many times
OMOU MAMA
LONELY WAY
KONO BOKU NO
So that‚Äôs what ‚ÄúMelos‚Äù means

an ancient Greek term meaning a tune, a melody, or a lyric poem intended for singing. In ancient Greek music theory ‚Äúmelos‚Äùmeant the melodic basis of music. The teaching of harmonics and melopoeia was associated with melos.
Which is apparently how the series was supposed to end had the budget not run out or something
Taking a break before I watch the 3rd OVA
V MAX
REI
Did not do the animation justice
Hopefully the video quality is better than when I watched it at 480p
$59.99 right now
https://twitter.com/wtk/status/1354114655891976195?s=21
The subs I use can never seem to get his name right
In Layzner
Next to Eiji. Anna is my second fav character
Layzner is so good
You get no context for this
So I‚Äôm in the endgame of Blue Comet SPT Layzner
And even to those who have never watched a mecha show before
But I can recommend this anime to anyone who‚Äôs a fan of Sci Fi
Will wrap it up tomorrow finally
Blue Comet SPT Layzner is one freaking awesome show
?
Lol
Nice
Her name is Shia from the anime Gundam Build Fighters try
I‚Äôm seeing Zenbu everywhere man
Watching Build Fighters Try
She is very cute though at the very least
I mean that‚Äôs fine
Try Island Wars was also awesome!
Well I‚Äôll keep an eye out for it then!
Huh
What‚Äôs that?
No
A good sports anime
Better on the rewatch
AWESOME
Was
Build Fighters Try
And then Try Island Wars OVA
Final episode of Build Fighters Try let‚Äôs go!
God so many great team up ideas
Star Saber Tsubasa
Duh
Transformers x Symphogear next
Was in my headspace rent free all the time
And that final shot of Optimus firing all those lasers?
And Armada StarScream is best starscream
I‚Äôd jam to this every day after school

We are gonna play P5
When me and the mates move into a new house
Possibilities are endless
Megatron Autobot Chris
Transformers are legit
But yeah
No idea. Never seen it sadly
I‚Äôve become a Sheryl Nome fan
She is!
Ranka Lee is too adorable for words
Queen
another person to add to the best girl list
Like wtf were they thinking?
This whole anime is a shitpost
It looks so bad!
Is that Ex Arm?
What is that?
And I think her archetype is interesting
Yuzu doesn‚Äôt take shit lying down
Mhm
Yuzu top tier
Very true
Yuya wants to help make people smile and I feel the same way
I fucking hate Yusaku
Yes
He‚Äôs my son
I love Yuya
Anyways fav series is GX and 5D‚Äôs
Ugh
Boreload dragon man
Some cards just being so busted everyone uses them
Power creep on cards
But man Konami can really fuck things up for everyone
I mean I love Yugioh
I hate it when a game is like You must use this thing to win
Pendulums could mass swarm. But you didn‚Äôt HAVE to use them
Cypher I‚Äôm talking when Links first came out
Yes they do
Eventually
And pendulums made me happy
You now HAD to use link monsters to do anything
Even if you like Vrains. Link monsters ruined everything
Never mind the fact that link monsters Ruined the fun for a lot of strategies
It‚Äôs so annoying and frustrating
But a relatable female character
Now imagine that
A lot of Vrains to me feels against what the franchise is about
Loses through BS every time
Meanwhile the only female lead Aoi Zaizen despite having a much superior deck
Yusaku gets all the wins
At least when Yuma did that shit he actually has a nice Loss record against Kaito
Using an ability no one can replicate
As in no matter the situation Yusaku literally always wins
Freaking Yusaku pulls THE EXACT MONSTER HE NEEDS FOR THE EXTRA DECK EVERY SINGLE TIME
But Yusaku
Or maybe it was a card in the deck we haven‚Äôt seen yet
But usually there‚Äôs a back and forth with it. Sometimes they win. Occasionally a loss will occur
This is a given to promote new stuff and plot progression.
Yugioh MC‚Äôs pull Cards out of thin air all the time
Well I‚Äôm gonna say this.
<@!87512939107450880> may I explain why I think Yusaku is the worst MC? For me anyway?
Buff girls are good
I am really liking Macross Frontier tbh!
Like is she actually an angel?
How the hell does she do it?
Who knows what they are cooking up
Interesting
If they announce GX I‚Äôm losing my mind
I love characters with ‚ÄúQueen‚Äù energy
Hello 911 I need to report someone for slaying my heart
Good character
I like Accelerator

Hironobu Kageyama‚Äôs cover of the Layzner OP SLAPS
So why go original for season 2?
The first season was so well adapted!
Uuuuuugh
Like the heck?
Why the hell is season 2 suffering these issues?
So there‚Äôs time to pace things out properly
Like the manga is over now
I don‚Äôt even know why they are skipping stuff
Season 1? Fire stuff. Kino
Season 2? Eh your mileage may vary
Gundam 00 good
And Melua is right
THAT WAS AMAZING
Putting the finishing touches in the 00‚Äôs feet
Yeah I gave Victory a compliment
I actually remember Uso more then Kou
Same
I‚Äôm legit excited for it!
I know!
Just to show everyone my tastes in Mecha
https://twitter.com/admiralblue5/status/1358237481234296834?s=21
I noticed that too
^
But I feel some parts God mod Char
I mean l like Origin fine
Same
The top tier Gundam is dragonar
Besides
Sad part is I‚Äôm sure one could make that list
But too often it‚Äôs a mishandled trope
Eh I think a love triangle can work
Aaah that problem
Instead of it just being cool Sci Fi stuff
Aaaaaaah
Like it‚Äôs a giant what the hell was that?
Ah
Zero..... that‚Äôs the one people say is a blood fest right?
Oh I wouldn‚Äôt start with frontier either
It‚Äôs only my second Macross I know but. I really vibe with this
Frontier is good from what I‚Äôve been seeing
And I plan on watching the original after frontier
It has a different legacy feel than say Gundam
If you like 7 then odds are you‚Äôll like the rest of Macross
And watching frontier currently
I started with 7.
But the music was üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•
Macross 7 was just ok for me
So this is a piece of Otaku history for y‚Äôall
https://www.otaquest.com/daicon-preservation-projects/
Gonna finally watch the legend
So next time
Macross frontier good
But don‚Äôt remember much about it
I recall watching the anime back in my youth
Captain Global seems rad
*Sarcasm*
I‚Äôm sure she won‚Äôt be significant later
IN THE FAR OFF YEAR OF *Checks calendar* 1999!!!!!
Time to start The Super Dimensional Fortress Macross!
Ok!
Nice
Ok MinMay is amazing

And they picked up nearby things that were caught in the Fold field
Only they did this close to the earths surface
So they basically did a thing cold a ‚ÄúFold‚Äù which lets you jump vast distances in space
Yes
Macross is serious yo


He‚Äôs so based
Captain Globe is awesome!
Btw I love this guy
This has been ‚ÄúAlexis gushes about a giant robot she likes‚Äù
Oh and Big O falls into that weird middle ground of Real Robot and Super Robot that I like
This one btw
https://youtu.be/rrmUk2YUm14
Which makes sense because apparently during pre production. The staff was influenced by Batman:The Animated Series
But with a giant robot
Imagine Bruce Wayne doing Batman things
And another way to look at this show
Top ten anime OST‚Äôs for me
https://youtu.be/7OlcJzin3LE
Highly recommend people check this one out.
Especially those big piston pile driver arms of it
And the Big O itself is very interesting to me
And the English Dub is so good! Roger Smith is easily top 10 Steve Blum roles material
Which makes sense considering the head writer is Chiaki J Konaka
The Big O is a unique mecha series that blends noir aesthetic, giant robot action, and a mystery of what the world really is that feels lovecraftian at times
HECK YES
https://www.rightstufanime.com/S-CRY-ed-TV-Series-Blu-ray
Sometimes all it takes is the ‚ÄúWHAM‚Äù episode for things to really jive
Godzilla gets Thiccer with each new incarnation
Klan Klang  is great
https://twitter.com/nxonnetflix/status/1360061067846701064?s=21
I love Klan Klang
I say that‚Äôs Sumeragi but Tieria makes a strong case
Slay it Tieria!
They even made a figure of Dress Tieria
<@!233721366782672896>
Especially the animation
The Boondocks from my memory was way better than you‚Äôd think it‚Äôd be
Just sharing Chirico and his coffee for no reason

~~I personally think CCA is bad~~
Nice
Yeah?
Yeah
Like a full series would‚Äôve helped things greatly
Don‚Äôt we all?
Seabook just going ape on The rafflesia
Ngl the finale of F91 was pretty cool
LIMITER OVERRIDE
The F91 tech I like
Yeah that‚Äôs a sexy ship right there
Giant Gundam pirate ship
Cecily commands the mother vanguard was it?
Don‚Äôt we all?
Very cute
Took me a second
Oh yeah she‚Äôs good
I love her!
My other Gundam waif!
Marrue!
Sumeragi Lee Noriega is my Gundam waifu.
Intelligent, space mom aesthetic, and gorgeous !
Those things are rad asf
I just don‚Äôt like CCA
I‚Äôd rather not debate today
Like imagine making the most epic Bard Character for D&D. Only to skimp on the origin
Plus not really learning Basara‚Äôs backstory I feel hurts the overall story
But I felt 7 went on a bit too long for the plot it had
It‚Äôs not a bad show by any means
Hi Mylene‚Äôs dad! *waves*
No really Basara having autism or some form of it explains a majority of his behavior
You know that would make a ton of sense and I head canon that now
We get some hints here and there. But not enough to get a concrete answer
But I really wish I knew what Basara‚Äôs deal was
I mean 7 does improve
Yeah they did
Like what the heck was that all about?
^ Agreed!
She‚Äôs pretty top
Really enjoyed that show yes I did
Ah dang the FMP! Brain rot is coming back
She‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
It‚Äôs the first OP for Build Divers:ReRise
I love this OP like you have no idea

BIG SIS LEXI IS TAKING YOU ON A JOYRIDE TO FIGHT ALIENS IN ONE

Is this Kancolle?
Iftv?
Nice!
But having all my favs right within reach? Nice
Streaming is nice
I love physical media
I heard Lain gets real trippy
It‚Äôs also a mystery one
So while mecha show
The Big O also has that
Also Konaka loves his lovecraftian themes
Konaka does that
Yeah I should check that out at some point
Loved Digimon Tamers and The Big O
Chiaki J Konaka‚Äôs famous work
Oh yeah!
What is it?
?
Do I have good taste? Or do I have good taste
Anime coming my way in the next two days
I think we can agree that just berating Shinji 24/7 is not a good thing right?
^
It‚Äôs super unfair to Shinji
I hate that trope
Exactly
Like being really mean for no reason
I heard the third one has everyone dumping on Shinji for something he didn‚Äôt do
Well everything makes sense if you consider some people just want to watch the world end
^
And your mom is dead
You try being mentally sound when it‚Äôs the end of the world. And your dad hates your guts
Shinji needs therapy and a good support network
But that‚Äôs my two cents
After all when it comes to horror somethings what your mind creates is far more terrifying then what someone else could conceive
That aligns with Konaka‚Äôs lovecraftian themes or the way he operates.
He‚Äôd rather let the audience think about what has transpired in the work. And let them draw their own conclusions
I hope it includes the original dub
I wonder when the states will get a new Evangelion set
Nice
But yeah holy crap I got so much anime
Amazed that Trigun hasn‚Äôt been put on blu ray yet
That‚Äôs a lot of anime
That‚Äôs a blast from the past
https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2021-02-22/tokyo-mew-mew-new-anime-unveil-main-staff-2022-tv-premiere/.169839
Eva isn‚Äôt half bad tbh
But appreciate it *not bad head nod*
And was not expecting Scully on there
Terry McGuinness is his own man!
I think SEED is good
Is that a good or bad thing?
My son
Kira Yamato
Yeah
But my tastes in characters range wildly
I know my bingo sheet is very strange
But I guess the colors red ignites my soul!
What‚Äôs ironic is my fav color is blue
Now that bingo sheet isn‚Äôt AAAAALL of my favs. But I went with the characters that stuck out to me the most
BoukenSilver nice
Static as well? Very culture
Niiiiiiice
Zorro?
Superman is my favorite superhero btw
Nice
But I do have paint.net
I don‚Äôt have photoshop
HERE IT IS
THAT IS STUPID AWESOME
REVOLVER FOR A HAND
RizeGreyMon is BOSS
But I recall liking it
I only data squad once
Not just non stop Adventure remakes and sequels no one asked for
Data Squad even!
Heck show Frontier some love!
But yeah I agree Black
I like Wargreymon and MetalGururumon
I think Adventure in general has gotten stale
No no you ain‚Äôt wrong
Was thinking of looking at Baldios
Nice
So it‚Äôs like ‚ÄúOh damn this guy was pretty freaking cool!‚Äù
And I already know of Max from watching Macross 7
I‚Äôve been throughly enjoying my watch so far
The OG
SDF
‚ÄúOh hello I am clearly alien person‚Äù
Macross with no context
I heard the Xros Wars anime was bad
Tales of Symphonia animation streaming? Heck yes!
https://twitter.com/wtk/status/1364641816428036096?s=21
Great anime
<@!740195087895756820> if you can I highly recommend Magic Knight Rayearth
Yes
Let her eat all the things
Adorable little Kamuy
She is!
I like Tohru and Kanna!
The kind that everyone can relate to one some level
Right? It has story book feeling to it
Cuz it was apparently dubbed too
IKR?
Like Hikaru is such an amazing character
But I really do recommend Rayearth
Rip
Hikaru Umi and Fuu are such good friends
But still wholesome girls being wholesome
A little gay
I got the first set for half off
And those hardcovers are niiiiice
But I don‚Äôt know about anywhere else
Discotek has the US license
And I got both sets!
They are expensive
Like peak CLAMP
And oh man the manga? The manga art is GOAT
Discotek did a great job with it!
It‚Äôs really nice!
Rayearth is good
Frick
Well
Yeeaaaaaah
At least the girls look close to their ages if you ask me
What about her?
The singer?
But it gets the Lexi seal of approval
I don‚Äôt believe Rayearth is up for streaming just yet
Mhm
Point is I think Rayearth is one of CLAMPS better stories that needs more love
Followed by emotional soul crushing defeats
So get ready for feel good moments
It‚Äôs a CLAMP story
<@!740195087895756820>
What follows is an adventure of a lifetime as those three girls must become the legendary Magic Knights to save Cephiro!
And suddenly the three girls find themselves in the magical land
It‚Äôs about how three middle school girls named Hikaru, Umi Fuu visit Tokyo tower one day.
When they are shown a vision of a princess asking for their help in the land of Cephiro
Yes it‚Äôs a 90‚Äôs anime!
XD
Big bad beetleborgs?
Also Aura Battler Dunbine
XD
Meat Mecha
I am a chick. And I do dig giant robots
Yeah that checks out
Mashin Hero Wataru‚Äôs mechs are tiny
Mhm
I mean Dyna Dragon exists
Yeah I‚Äôd count Gridman as mecha
Technically Gridman works
I love Super Robots
That‚Äôs why I love them so much
I feel like I can overcome anything
No lie when I watch mecha no matter the trials or tribulations
I believe in Getter
I agree to that
^
You can have mecha that use magic as a source of power
Mecha anime tend to have a hero or group use a Robot or piloted mobile suit to overcome odds or forces incomprehensible  by normal people
I think that‚Äôs a solid take
It can be so many things
Mecha anime inspire me
Mecha anime has rotted my brain for the better
Just imagine
‚ù§Ô∏è
<@!468591607332208641> a MODEROID of True Rayearth
I WANT MODEROIDS OF THE OTHER RUNE GODS
YEAH
Thank goddess for SRW telling me about them
<@207452640886521859> I hope you continue enjoying Rayearth!
Having an organic aspect to a Unit doesn‚Äôt discount it from being a mecha
That‚Äôs awesome!
Like same
That‚Äôs the one where a girl goes to another world and falls for the villainess right?
The premise has my gay brain in overdrive
Is it any good?
I really need to read that series
Wives
Noriko from Gunbuster is canonically a mecha weeb
Shem Ha is actually a Gundam weeb confirmed
It‚Äôs certainly a thing
Should be here tomorrow!
And just ordered the first volume!
Damn I have to support her now!
NO WAY
Already did
And nice to see a female creator getting love
That‚Äôs nice
That got so popular the creator had to make more
It sounds like a pilot for a tv series
<@!430379754190012426>
https://twitter.com/theotaking/status/1365028803026710530?s=21
You are correct
It went on for more episodes than you‚Äôd think it would
And then they meet Shinji and he‚Äôs got an Eva train robot!
I never saw Shinklaion but it seems wild
Oh yeah
Nice
That scene is super Brutal
Yeaaaaah
IT GOT GAYER
Wow this Novel went from 0 to Gay real quick! üåàüåàüåàüåàüåà
The Railgun side is cool
I‚Äôve only seen the anime‚Äôs
But I‚Äôm 26 and soon I too will need that cane
Granny Mel
I don‚Äôt get it
DESS 13!
Oh yeah!
I hope the announce Part 6 anime
Part 5 is lit
My fav is either Jolyne or Giorno
All parts are good
I love jojo
<@!451461875549339653>
I do!
Nice
So Volume 3 was made after the success of the first two?
I want an anime of this
||A Lesbian couple having kids? MY GAY HEART HAS HOPE!||
I must read this now!
YES
What about volume 3?
They look cute and badass!
Oh?
Love the art at the very least
The book is bigger than I thought it‚Äôd be
I really need to sit down and read the LN‚Äôs I have so far
Got my copy!

God that comic was so stupid
Discotek is just going crazy with the virtual releases!
Oh man!
If they announce GX I‚Äôm losing my mind!
PLEASE
COME ON GX
||They are both alive for starters||
I mean she‚Äôs good too
Sayla Mass is best UC timeline girl
Man This villainess novel is good
<:MariaBliss:688836867390439585> <:MariaBliss:688836867390439585> <:MariaBliss:688836867390439585> <:MariaBliss:688836867390439585>
Flooding my brain
The gay it‚Äôs it‚Äôs
Holy crap
LEWD
I love it
Im barely into this novel and it‚Äôs already super gay
I think she‚Äôs neat
Aaaaaaw
Who wants to be gay and do war crimes with me?
Yeaaaaah
<:MariaSmile:688836869550768233>
Why must I be this way?
<a:MariaShake:493803268850319360>
*Tosses self out with the trash*
Yeah I am
Yeah
<a:MariaBlush:493803272360951808>
Maria
You know making sure it goes to right address and all
Once I move I‚Äôll order it
How so?
Like I heard the Dragon Maid dub downplayed the gay for no real reason
Some people just don‚Äôt get that
But keeps the spirit of it alive
Not one to one
I think what makes a good dub is when the dub producer keeps faithful to the source.
Martian Successor Nadesico‚Äôs dub was good
Huh
https://twitter.com/toeianimation/status/1366160978795257859?s=21
I‚Äôd love to see his other works collected in physical form!
And more love to Ishinomori as well!

In one collection
All four original volumes
RIDER! RIDER!!!!
KAMEN RIDER
KAMEN RIDER
RIDER! KICK!
RIDER JUMP!
F*CK YES
THEY AREN‚ÄôT
NO WAY
https://twitter.com/gomanga/status/1366149333767364608?s=21
I love Tessa
FLCL?
Genuine honest to goodness love
Like it‚Äôs genuine love. Not baiting or anything
I really am rooting for Rae and Claire
Volume 2 should be here tomorrow
That‚Äôs some goooood stuff right there
Just finished I‚Äôm in love with the villainess Volume 1.
What?
One day if I have kids I will show them all the awesome stories I‚Äôve encountered
Stories are important to me
Most of all I like a good story
I just have a diverse palette of things I like
I‚Äôm a wild woman that‚Äôs for sure <:MariaSmile:688836869550768233>
Oh Kaname Chidori. You have no idea
This season of Pretty cure seems like it‚Äôs gonna be a wild ride
Rip
I can watch a pre cure series from the very beginning
That‚Äôs pretty neat
I love them
They are so gay
It‚Äôs thicc
My copy is here!
Can‚Äôt wait for Volume 2 to get here already!
I love them
<a:MariaBlush:493803272360951808>
I just aimed to never be out of the loop on things
Am I bad for liking so many things?
Setsuna is my son
Gundam 00 I enjoyed a lot
Kurz: Hey Mao.
Mao!
Mao!
MAAAAAAAO!

Mao: WHAT???? 

Kurz: DANGER ZOOOONE!
That‚Äôs why more esoteric Gundams stick out to me more
It‚Äôs not bad. Buuuuuuut it can lead to sameness type feeling after awhile
I want to make my own Chris Yukine gunpla. Equipped with the Double Satellite Cannon and the heavy arms‚Äôs guns
Once me and my roommates move. Me and one of them are spending several months on gunpla customs
Heck there‚Äôs a person I follow that is using the core Gundam as a base for their Symphogear Gundam customs
Using the core Gundam as a base! Now people who probably didn‚Äôt know how to make custom gunpla before. Have an easier time starting out!
SO MANY CUSTOMS
Not only in show is it a versatile machine capable of docking with the planet system
Core Gundam to me is super important
Core Gundam is top tier
Yeah
Gundam has some really nice robots don‚Äôt it?
I love both equally
Master Grade Zabanya when?
To be fair Noa who wouldn‚Äôt?
Kinda? But they seem awfully generic
Lol
As far as I know anyway
Discotek doesn‚Äôt do The fate series
I paid $80 each for my limited editions
Aniplex does the fate stuff
Nice
Huh only three episodes for them to sub
*checks*
Oh is it fully subbed now?
The finale was so hype!
SSSS.Gridman was awesome!
Then I can buy all the current A Certain magical index novels and have space for them!
Man I can‚Äôt wait to move
Can‚Äôt wait to pick up the blu ray
That‚Äôs pretty based
You‚Äôd appreciate this I think
<@208724042025402369>
https://twitter.com/imagesmecha/status/1352343737570119680?s=21
Oh and I believe in Clare supremacy
It‚Äôs so wholesome
Like Clare? Queen! ‚ù§Ô∏èüôè
This my first time reading it ever
Queen!
<@509335685791088661>
https://twitter.com/OOCGundam/status/1293707468288274432?s=20
Bro
I‚Äôm imagine Kazuma and Hibiki punching stuff together
F*ck
Kallen Kozuki deserves the world!
I love her
So let Ayahi pilot a Gundam as a main character!
^
In Gundam just be happy if you‚Äôre female and you survive to the end
I would
Fumina is a good girl
Oh there was Fumina Hoshino from Build Fighters Try
Ayahi needs to be a Gundam Protag already
It‚Äôs like a borderline super power
No really it‚Äôs a super popular gunpla
Everybody be buying the Core Gundam left and right
ReRise was a good series
Or something new?
Will we get another Build series?
I‚Äôm honestly just wondering what the next Gundam series would be like
Best girl!
Best girl!
Tessa is my fav
It is
Invisible Victory was awesome
I need to watch GunXSword at some point
Mecha anime in general is awesome
An arms race escalation if you will
Well it‚Äôs more like their tech getting to that point really
Yeah you kinda need the full series context for the movie
Season 2 of 00 is good to me. But it has elements that I can agree others would disapprove of
I can kinda get that
She gets hers
Though trust me
||Nene||
My jaw dropped when that happened
THAT MOMENT
OH YEAH
Manatasu when she transforms gets *BUFF*
What name?
I was honestly thinking Gentarou but with more sugar
For she is the Precure that LIFTS
I can‚Äôt wait for the red one to appear
So going in completely blind
Never saw a precure before this one
Same here
I love this selfish smug mermaid
You really feel for the crew of the Ptolemy
Mhm!
But good!
It‚Äôs depressing as hell
Seriously the ending of season 1 is so good
üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠
||LOCKON! LOCKON! LOCKON! LOCKON! LOCKON!||
Yeah they go off of AD time. As in our earths timeline
And shock and awe tactics
It‚Äôs the perfect crime
Zeon
GX Blu Ray plz
Please let it be something good!
WUT
Who‚Äôs extremely pretty
The purple haired one
No but for real Sumeragi call me
Listen I‚Äôm just saying if Tieria and Setsuna kissed it‚Äôd be kinda nice
The best ship is ||Setsuna x Tieria x Gundam||
It probably came to her in a drunken stupor
Best idea
||Tieria is the true best girl||
Ayahi needs more main leading roles tbh
She‚Äôs the best
Space mom aesthetic
Issues that I can relate too!
So smart! Beautiful!
She is!
I would go into battle with her any day!
She‚Äôs so good
SUMERAGI IS MY WIFE
Ok but why tho
Feldt is an extremely good girl
Very well put together
And it feels like a constant March to a goal
Especially with the way the piano switches keys and stuff
But composing wise Daybreaks Bell is top tier
Ash Like Snow is good
An ace in the hole
Especially with how it‚Äôs introduced
I love Trans Am
The A-Laws are basically 00‚Äôs version of the Titans from Zeta Gundam
Project Ako looks fun!
I can‚Äôt believe a clerical error prevented people from finding the masters
Thank you Robert Woodhead
Setsuna is my son
00 is good
That was ||Setsuna‚Äôs backstory right?||
Oh yeah
But the stuff they did announce was nice
Aaaaw no GX
KERO
https://twitter.com/discotekmedia/status/1369122383852830723?s=21
Nice!

It‚Äôs like super good
And spiritual awakening
I think it invokes a feeling of adventure
GOAT OPENING
The OG is good
All these people we‚Äôve come to learn and love getting thrashed
But a constant stab to the heart
Not a hurrah! Or triumph
The ending of season 1 is so tragic.
IT WAS
Feldt is a super good girl
More cute girls with guns

Poor Ange.....
A mecha is light hearted? Get ready for pain later
Yeah I think watching OG Is good after 00
So not sure when we will see the replacement discs. But it was not entirely Nozomi‚Äôs fault
Yeah Nozomi was indeed sent the wrong masters. And wasn‚Äôt aware that they weren‚Äôt the true blue up to date version of SEED.
Oh yeah this whole chestnut
Not saying Zeon did do bad stuff too.
But the federation wasn‚Äôt morally clean either
Yeah the earth  federation in Gundam are kinda scumbags
And also ||Fuck Ribbons Allmark||
That‚Äôs a bit harsh man
Saji dropped the ball
But yeah I don‚Äôt like CCA. But I will buy this to support more Gundam Manga
And apparently Denpa is releasing the Men Who Created Gundam this summer
Would be legit awesome if other Gundam side story manga came over stateside
This is legit awesome!
YO
https://twitter.com/denpa_books/status/1370551494689255424?s=21
They just provide better context for the next one
And with Macross you don‚Äôt necessarily need to have seen all of them.
I mean yeah
~~Resists urge to say Macross Frontier because I know people are getting sick of me mentioning mecha every five seconds~~
Laura is a constant mood

Looking forward to this!
Can‚Äôt wait to hear more!
The people who did Build Divers:ReRise and formally Studio Xebec
It‚Äôs gonna be done by Sunrise Beyond
But imagine if they were done by 4Kids
All Symphogear openings are bangers
4Kids.
Bleh
What a time to be alive
Truth
DM me more info <@!161155855524298752> !
Ooooh my yes
If the numbers are in play I think we got a bigger problem on our hands
Maybe you if you solve it by yourself you‚Äôll get a long dead Egyptian pharaoh friend too!
But I actually really like that
It‚Äôs lazy as heck
Yeah that‚Äôs the whole gimmick
Jack and Carly from 5D‚Äôs are my OTP
Finally!
Ah
Aaaaah
Who is Sankaku?
Fell behind cuz laziness
I really need to catch up on that
Can‚Äôt wait
And I couldn‚Äôt make sense of it
I watched it with one my roommates  and I‚Äôm the fate fan
But nope!
I thought it‚Äôd be an adaptation of the game
I agree 100%
Very
I couldn‚Äôt make heads or tails of it
But last encore was like real bad because of it
Steve Blum reads the phone book
That‚Äôs actually really good casting
I usually say W to start
^
There‚Äôs plenty of good options to choose from in that regard
Yugioh 5D‚Äôs is so good
https://youtu.be/U0TXIXTzJEY
At least for America
Which piracy wasn‚Äôt the only way to play the VN
I actually like the Deen/Stay Night anime.
And I also enjoy the Fate route for what it is
It‚Äôs more so that Sony ALSO owns Funimation I believe
Basically
We don‚Äôt need a few media giants owning literally everything you know?
Really hope the justice department blocks it tbh
Poggers
Either way it‚Äôs awesome!
I think it might be
Now I can listen to Arashi No Hero on full blast and no one can stop me!
HELL YES
The Brave series soundtracks are on Spotify
I mean it‚Äôs more so her age and the sheer volume of work she‚Äôs done
My word the sky is the limit for her
She‚Äôs done so much and is only 29 years old!??
Aoi Yuuki is a freaking legend
Like there‚Äôs a difference in opinion and then there‚Äôs being objectively wrong
What are some shockingly bad anime takes you‚Äôve heard?
Never land got weird shall we say
Next episode is gonna be lit
I love this Smug queen
Oh and she called the other Pretty Cures her precious Kouhai
Sukeban? Yeah that‚Äôs pretty accurate
I swear she radiates powerful lesbian energy that Asuka
SHE IS SO COOL
I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if that number increases over time
There‚Äôs three Precure shows on crunchyroll rn
The GOAT
I mean you could stab your leg on loop and achieve a similar result
The GOAT
I just want to be hugged by the snake goddess
Medusa can kick me into a wall and I‚Äôd thank her

Big O is rad
You are right <@712002916403380285>
Rider is cool
Which is fair
Medusa a good girl
It‚Äôs pretty kino
The latest season of Pretty cure

Not in the insulting way
So Chris is a shrimp
https://twitter.com/bakainubashiri/status/1378502206542987264?s=21
Queen!
I just woke up man
Stone Ocean confirmed!
Must be Jesus
Realized that question was more spoilery then intended
How did Shirou Amata dodge a mobile suit gun shot at near point blank range without being a newtype?
Mu is the GOAT of Gundam Seed
Kira and Mu La Flaga are good
Nah man
Patrick Colasour is the Leroy Jenkins of Gundam
That was right
I‚Äôm just sayin the Gundam Franchise has tons of characters surviving things that would either wise kill them instantly.
Basically without super spoilers. The ability to fly is a really big deal in both Back Arrow and Big O
But yeah when a certain thing was revealed in Back Arrow I immediately was reminded of the Big O
I caught up to Back Arrow and the show is pretty lit! Not the best but I‚Äôm having fun with it!
And I can totally see Back Arrow being a part of an SRW game alongside too other shows off the top of my head! 8/10
On episode 11 rn
Catching up on the anime Back Arrow
The Big O is so cool!
No really
Inspired by Batman: The Animated Series in some respects
90‚Äôs and it‚Äôs noir
And holds up extremely well
Big O is super lit
But yeah Back Arrow fun
Already has been
Same
That‚Äôs pretty cool!
Yup
So strange to see Media Blasters come back from the dead
Grenadier and MazinKaiser SKL are coming to HD blu ray
https://t.co/sDR7ngJr5u
And they are giving HD blu ray releases to some of their earlier stuff
Media blasters is back from the dead
THIS IS BIG NEWS
I believe in the power of getter
Nice
I‚Äôm so happy with the Macross and Getter news this evening!
Yeck! DECULTURE!

What a baller!
watching more Macross and I‚Äôve become a Maximilian Jenius fan
I‚Äôm having a blast with SDF Macross so far!

When you accidentally overcook the pizza rolls
https://twitter.com/metongerzen/status/1380902464426287117?s=21
Old news by now but still hype!

GOAT MOVIE
MACROSS AWESOME
DYRL is good so far

Watching Do You Remember Love and my mind is blown away by the animation/presentation
But to each their own UMU
I personally enjoy both versions of SDF‚Äôs events.
And DYRL being seen as a in universe movie is a fascinating idea that explains some stuff that I‚Äôve seen in other entries
RANKA CHAN!
But the girls are super cute
Frontier good
Not really. But seeing the other stuff deepens the appreciation for the others
Macross delta
Freyja Wion is precious
Space Hibiki
But I just do not care about buddy complex.
Like the game felt like it bent over backwards just for Wataru, Buddy Complex, and G Recos sake
Like baby I know you‚Äôre trying
One of the series that dragged down X for me
I didn‚Äôt mind him at  all
Alto is good
Sheryl San!!!

Sheryl is the pinnacle. While Ranka is the cute girl next door
I think they are both queens
I love this too
https://youtu.be/kKlQ7WDbs5s
Sheryl doesn‚Äôt have to go THAT hard during her concerts.
But she does anyway!
Valkyrie‚Äôs go brrrrrr
Macross good
I love these dorks
I love Freyja
Love her!
Mikoto Misaka!
Also Basara is just off somewhere being the best Bard in the Galaxy
The queen does not miss
Sheryl is great both her singing and VA voice
It‚Äôs monopoly mermaid Monday again

You see when alone mommy and daddy‚Äôs play Yugioh, UNO or any other assorted card games
My next life as a villainess was fun. Since the MC did use her previous knowledge to try and avoid the bad ends
I tend not to dismiss Isekai‚Äôs in general. Sometimes one comes along that really surprises me
I mean look at all the deluge of Isekai novels
I can agree to that
It‚Äôs just from where I‚Äôm at it sounded very dismissive towards Isekai in general.
Though a lot of modern isekai‚Äôs don‚Äôt have the best storytelling besides that
I mean for me so what if Isekai is a ‚ÄúGimmick‚Äù. The story being told is good then it doesn‚Äôt matter
Journey to the center of the earth is technically an Isekai
There and back again
Aura Battler Dunbine is an Isekai.
Magic Knight Rayearth is an Isekai.

I think a key component in the shows I‚Äôve mentioned is the part where the heroes head back to the normal realm
Digimon is an Isekai
I mean I kinda get what your saying Melua but I‚Äôm just gonna have to disagree with ya
That blew my mind
I remember when I found out that sunrise did the animation for Inuyasha
Love Live must be a good Gundam entry
And plus I know there‚Äôs a brand new mecha series Sunrise is doing. Forget it‚Äôs name but it‚Äôs not based on anything previously established
So excited for that!
GETTER ROBO ARC THIS SUMMER
Like I see them at work all the time
Though modern Isekais to be virtually the same as one another besides a few details is the really lazy part
I mean heck if it gets their foot in the door then if they tell a better story later then I think that‚Äôs fine
Nice
üôÉüôÉüôÉüôÉüôÉüò≠
And yeah that twist at the end
Hikaru is just a fun character!
All the Knights are good girls
Daicon IV
<@!99695384296701952>
It‚Äôs so cheesy but I love it
I do like how Macross handles legacy in that regard. Like after seeing other Macross anime‚Äôs now I have much more appreciation for what M7 was trying to do!
Since it‚Äôs like a spark of inspiration that Misa was like ‚ÄúWhy not just concentrate our barrier in one punch. And then open fire once we pierce through!‚Äù
It‚Äôs definitely in the top 5
And because the Macross is just that huge that total works!
MY GOD!
Always wanted one but no way am I paying $800 for one anime set
Bedi a good boy
So what‚Äôs the big deal with Motsu?
Which is basically will power
Powered by Getter rays
Giant robot
<@158053389949861888> Getter Robo
üôè‚úåÔ∏è
Thank you queen love ya!
‚ù§Ô∏è
My name sake
Oh hey
I posted it here in anime because it‚Äôs just so wtf
This game actually existed
WHAT DID THE WEST DO TO WATARU?
https://twitter.com/stockfootage_m/status/1390563322903236608?s=21
It‚Äôs more a shame that usually an episode has to be rushed out the door asap. 
I mean sure the blu ray will fix things later but still...
Nice
The Precure who lifts
Asuka good
She
But you can at least list them out you know?
I think at a point you can‚Äôt really rank your favs
Also I love these dorks
Colors by FLOW is top tier
JIBUUUUN WO
<@!171395487247630336> just Watch Code Geass: Lelouch of the rebellion and R2 you‚Äôll be fine
For spoiler reasons I won‚Äôt say what happens
<@202444817043685386> that takes place between seasons 1 and 2
The recap movies go off into their own timeline


I honestly think Geass is in my top three anime because it had a profound effect on me.
The English dub for Geass is also Kino
Arthur the cat
Kallen or C.C? The answer is yes
Savage
Ah
Gomen
I couldn‚Äôt tell tbh
Karen Strassman for the English dub
I don‚Äôt think she was
Kallen is beautiful and awesome!
Yeah most people agree Season 1 of Geass is solid asf.
It‚Äôs the second season where everything gets iffy
What did you think of season 1?
The reference book I got contains some good food
Ah
Aquarium anime?

I know it‚Äôs manga but.
Them
I love Luvia! üíôüíôüíôüíôüíôüíô
I love the Fire Valkyrie
Yup
So I‚Äôve always wanted to watch this oddity
It was basically gonna be Sunrise‚Äôs new ‚ÄúGundam‚Äù franchise before Gundam itself came back
Though this is obscure so no fault on not knowing it

Starting Dragonar tonight
Just what I‚Äôve heard
I haven‚Äôt read that far myself
I‚Äôm not sure on the plot
Which she never played
I believe so. And also Katarina experiences going through the events of Fortune Lovers sequel
Katarina Claes is a good girl
She
That sadly happens way too often doesn‚Äôt it?
Yeah
But I figured now is a good as time as any.
Oh I won‚Äôt
They should be all here within two weeks or so
I literally just bought all the available Berserk Deluxe editions plus the 1997 anime

But I now need to get the deluxe volumes in his honor
I never read Berserk myself
Oh yeah
Like dang this really sucks....
I just hope he‚Äôs resting easy now
Point is that Berserks influence can be felt far and wide
Agreed
Oh yeah Berserk introduced the idea of the Berserk state into the popular conscience
Oh shit that hits hard
Berserks influence on the landscape of pop culture can‚Äôt be understated
Truly a legend
When that man drew art it was like every thing he did was it‚Äôs own art piece
And the art was like no other
When a body of work has every single panel be its own art piece. That‚Äôs incredible
Not a singular repeat so far
I have seen people posting their favorite berserk panels on Twitter
Hajime No Ippo‚Äôs creator
https://twitter.com/wanpowanwan/status/1395239580937252868?s=21
But it‚Äôs still not good
I heard the blu ray release fixes that infamous scene
But looks cool
The Gundam MG model kit that does not move
Oh yeah the Deep Striker
Oh there was a reason. You see he wore that mask because earths air was ‚ÄúToo polluted for him‚Äù
G Gundam is my fav Gundam and fav anime of all time
Macross Plus was good

Nekki Basara a good boy
Holy lonely night? Oh yeah that‚Äôs also Fire!
TOTSUGEKI LOVE HEAAAAART!
HELL YEAH!
Macross 7?
üôè
YES

An Edeleth and Seed fan? A person of Culture you are Dace San
The mobile suit looks awesome
Ah so that‚Äôs what eclipse is
IT IS FINALLY HAPPENING
THE FABLED MOVIE
THE GUNDAM SEED MOVIE
NO
I‚Äôm not sure if this is a new game or what but still hype!
LETS GO MORE GUNDAM SEED CONTENT
NEW GUNDAM SEED
I AM SCREAMING

Shin Getter with a gun is too powerful
If we get fully animated Getter Emperor I‚Äôm gonna transcend space time
And because I‚Äôm hyped
Because Getter is awesome
BELIEVE IN GETTER

True

I AM SLAIN
I forgot the dudes name that‚Äôs all
Gamlin does get some pretty nice development throughout Macross 7.
And voiced by Dio Brando no less
Gamlin is pretty cool
Of course
Please let it be that Rock and Roll can save the Galaxy part
XD
Right?
I saw someone call Sharon Apple the galaxy‚Äôs first VTuber and I‚Äôm laughing my ass off! XD
He can go crazy to calm in the drop of a hat
Sugita is great. That dude has the range of a fucking sniper
Aoi Yuuki is everywhere
I know of Kawasumi Ayako as Milfena from outlaw Star. And Atoli from .Hack//G.U
Still can‚Äôt believe Touru Furuya is Yamcha
Oh yeah he was Zechs
Cypher you wanna drift
Takehito Koyasu is god tier
I didn‚Äôt even recognize him as Adachi at first
Johnny Yong Bosch was great as Yuu Narukami and Adachi
https://twitter.com/discotekmedia/status/1399531147839877123?s=21
Laura best girl

Head empty only mermaid
Local princess wants to be part of their world
Laura top tier
Mood
Though Manatsu has tons of heart so that counts for something!
Well the others have brain cells.
Manatsu failed every single one of her tests with like absurdly low scores.
So she‚Äôs designated dummy
A mermaid and her emotional support dummy
Those were good right?
These girls have all the drip
The School broadcast episode was funny
I‚Äôm having fun as it is
Most likely
Sango is just nifty
Minorin has that knowledge and is demure when not transformed
Manatsu is pure energy.
Asuka is a cool elder sister type.
Yeah they are
It‚Äôs fine for now but I foresee it being a problem later
And the other girls just need a proper introspection episode or something
But there is like a legit story there with her
I mean I don‚Äôt think they were expecting Laura to be as fun as she is
Most likely unintentional
Wish the other girls would get more solid character episodes
Episode 14 wasn‚Äôt half bad
Yup
Also her tail must be strong to keep her upright like that
She‚Äôs so fab
fab


And  the ending is like messed up and stuff
Seriously I love the character arc they have her on!
Oh Laura your time will come

And also Bokurano in case you want to stab your emotions
Or rather the site will be streaming the anime
MAGIC KNIGHT RAYEARTH IS COMING TO FUNIMATION
https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2021-06-02/funimation-adds-yowamushi-pedal-bananya-bokurano-more-to-catalog/.173493
I haven‚Äôt seen it myself but I heard of it‚Äôs legendary status
Nice
Oh really? Gomen I saw the movie cut version which I don‚Äôt believe has that. 
I could be misremembering it‚Äôs been awhile
All you need to know is that some hardcore girls did a thing and saved the human race!!!!!..... ||But because of faster than light travel they wound up 12,000 years in the future or something like that. So everyone they knew is dead. But hey at least the earth is still standing to greet Gunbuster on a job well done||
Kinda
Noriko rules
And it‚Äôs piloted by a pissed off short girl and her emotional support friend
The GunBuster fucking OWNS
Wut
Isn‚Äôt Mappa staff like super overworked though?
Maybe not the best but far from the worst
But give them time and they do some pretty solid work!
I think when JC Staff gets overworked then you get low quality stuff
Slam dunk good
I love Gunbuster itself is super robot. But the situation and everything around it is realism. To an extent of course
Or at least one of them
Super Inazuma Kick is like the rawest Super Robot Attack ever
I need to see the OVA cut of Diebuster because I saw the movie cut and it makes zero sense
*Fires sub machine guns in the air*
That guy must‚Äôve been a demon that came out of hell and wanted to play football
True
Eyeshield 21 is goat
||Welcome Home Gunbuster!||
But have you gotten Wild and Tough?
That opening is a BANGER <@712002916403380285>
Dope
Sky Hurricane is a fucking BANGER
https://twitter.com/discotekmedia/status/1402069907458584593?s=21
This is not cash money
Please
Orguss getting a new blu ray is the shocking one for me. So yeah my wallet is gonna be hurting
I‚Äôm happy Shaman King is getting a physical release
And if you call me a boomer I will take offense to that
I‚Äôm excited for pretty much most of the things they announced!
Oh yeah! The manga is amazing in capturing the insane nature of the sport!
Just with a lot more violence
I mean technically he is
Well the mystery has been solved!
what about it?
?
Very flawed but still good
Good anime.
Yup! Cross Ange

This tiny girl is done messing around and is going sicko mode on everyone
Noriko‚Äôs scream is Raw as fuck
Getter Wine anyone?
Kururun is love

More like it‚Äôs out when it‚Äôs out
Obviously not as a weekly series like bleach was
The one shots were so popular that Kubo is gonna do a Burn the Witch 2.
It‚Äôs called Burn the Witch 1
https://twitter.com/vizmedia/status/1403514900593455105?s=21
He seems to like it so far!
Showing my roommate Macross 7
I already took advantage of this sale
Gotta love protags who never give up, have hot blooded spirit but also a massive dork
The image is her sprite from Super Robot Wars T
Hikaru Shidou. Magic Knight Rayearth
Good girl
That works too
Or that
So watching it will be easy
Awesome! And it‚Äôs available for streaming subbed and dubbed now
A mecha magical girl fantasy story featuring three strong female leads and has some genuine twists and turns that feel satisfying to observe <@263534352422404096>
Oh it‚Äôs absolutely worth a watch!
<@205859030051061769> you genius!
DESS
Gero?
LOL
What the actual fuck
A solid 8/10 show in my opinion
Also Back Arrows finale was fun
Funimation translation goofed
Keichi Hasegawa is a mad genius
I mean who‚Äôs to say?
The 90‚Äôs Gridman live action show, SSSS and now DYNAZENON? All in the same universe and I freaking love that
Can we stop and appreciate how one of the more talked about anime‚Äôs this season. Has been an anime based on a toku show from the 90‚Äôs and how everything is connected?
It‚Äôll just be on a smaller scale is all
Which can also transform
They are doing a Moderoid of DYNAZENON
||If Gridman and DYNAZENON are teaming up then some serious shit has to be going down.||
But oh man can‚Äôt wait to see what they do for the next season
It‚Äôs just a matter of when is all
I have no doubt they‚Äôll make an appearance at some point
Like the kind that makes you go ‚ÄúWhere the eff did you get THAT idea from?‚Äù
So your friend was making real dumb critiques during the Symphogear watch?
A talking giraffe voiced by Seto Kaiba is peak realism
So I‚Äôm gonna watch it for myself at some point
I keep seeing people talk about it
Isn‚Äôt Revue Starlight a bunch of theater kids fighting for something and then shit goes down?
I‚Äôm saying I‚Äôd love to see their reactions
Imagine showing Revue Starlight to theater kids
Actual testimony
I mean some things you just kinda have to accept in a setting
Theater kids are dramatic as heck
But I can at least say it‚Äôs weird to me
So I‚Äôm not gonna judge to badly
I‚Äôm on the spectrum too
I don‚Äôt mean to be rude mind you. It just seems weird is all
Wait he didn‚Äôt get annoyed at DESS but got annoyed at Miku? Wtf
Hey I am happy the show helped you out when you were at a very dark time in your life. Anime and stories have the power to do that
Like her not being perfect and being flawed makes her a good character. I mean there‚Äôs other stuff too but read the context and between the lines people!
That seems like a him problem
She is the rock in Hibiki‚Äôs crazy life
How can anyone hate Miku I‚Äôll never know
I love it
Her victory pose is so extra
Laura is the best!
I love how smug she is
Arrested for seal crimes

So the new pretty cure episode was freaking amazing! Laura is in my top 10 characters of all time list now!
I think the Tv show was better
*Remembers what‚Äôs canon in the LL universe*
Wait
I for one will never fall into idol hell
Nova you schemer
Not judging or anything
Yup
*Salutes*
Oh you‚Äôre in Love Live hell now huh?
Protecc GF
I love them
She‚Äôs adorbs
Cure Summer is like energy in human form
HURRAY
Don‚Äôt tempt the girl!
Boobs good
Boobs
Love Live or bettering yourself and life goals
Hormone stuff though
Soon Lily is gonna be buying LL merch! Somehow!
Nova has corrupted the youth!
Yeah crazy right?
Season 1 I guess is seeing what works and what doesn‚Äôt
Maki Chan?
GoddessSpeed
To idol hell the system goes!
It‚Äôs always a nice feeling
Because you found another franchise you can fall madly in love with?
There is a notable franchise that must exist in universe with Love Live
*Laughs*
<@!722121666641133608>
Yeah keep watching LL
Knowing my tendencies a Love Live watch would devastate me
I‚Äôm watching a dear friend go down a path I can‚Äôt follow
*hugs*
Kururun is frightened!
But first work
YES YES YES ANOTHER PERSON TO TALK TO ABOUT THE SHOW MAKES LEXI HAPPY
YES! TROPICA!
Glad you found another show to enjoy
As long as you‚Äôre having fun UMU
Watching this systems journey through a franchise I know little of has been fun to see!
Can you DM Me this?
Makes sense
I‚Äôm starting with Tropical Rogue and I‚Äôm having tons of fun!
Asuka aka Cure Flamingo
There is a red head in Trop PreCure

Laura and Manatsu are a set! Do not separate
What do you think of Tropical Rouge PreCure?
True story

Shin Getter vs Neo Getter but done in MS paint
https://twitter.com/mon0eye/status/1407377816677724164?s=21
Cure Coral is just a cute sailor
I love them
Minori good
I would so totally get that and use it
But land or sea Laura has no limits!
Still need to watch the new episode
QUEEN LAURA!
Laura is best
Happy for them!
Queen
HA
HA
And with these two volumes I now have the complete English release of Diamond is Unbreakable!
Now the only thing left is to wait for the release of Golden Wind!
Tropical Rouge is kino
KURURUN

I just think this is really cool

https://twitter.com/marvelstudios_j/status/1410146530225389569?s=21
IT HIM
AAAAAAAH
So this is doubly based
And that person is a Symphogear fan
WOOOOOOOO
https://www.sentaifilmworks.com/a/news/sentai-primes-getter-robo-arc
Still need to watch Dynazenon
SSSS.Gridman good
Cultured
Watching Gridman?
So is this a remake?
https://twitter.com/funimation/status/1411490033740230656?s=21
Look how cute she is!
Small Da Vinci is daughter
She has magical thighs
Very
Wife
That makes sense
She is baby
Morgana and Futaba look so cute!
YES!
Medusa hot
WIFE!
When you have magic and lesbians you can say eff you to the laws of nature
Magic lesbians
They love how people have taken a liking to the story
I follow the author on Twitter and they are very sweet
I‚Äôm In love with the villainess is so good
Akane Shinjo is a good girl
Gonna watch that with the mates later
Oh snap it is back!

HAMAN SAMA
Ma‚Äôam!
||BABY DAN DAN INTENSIFIES||
It‚Äôs Macross
Nice
https://twitter.com/180223/status/1412606066521559043?s=21
The narrative A Packs isn‚Äôt too bad
Part 4 is good
I mean y‚Äôall free to be wrong
Favorite part is 5 Golden Wind
All parts are good in their own way
I‚Äôm a huge fan of JoJo btw.
Cute fairy
That‚Äôs all I‚Äôll say before I get too heated
But there‚Äôs only so much you can do with it
Hamon was fun
False
Yeah it‚Äôs almost like part 3 was introducing the concept of Stands or something
May the getter Rays bless you
<@!740195087895756820> I am glad you are understanding the power and hype of Getter
Texas Mack is peak American
It‚Äôs such a fantastic moment
Musashi went out like a hero.
And he forever became a fan favorite because of it
Oh man wait until you read the rest of the Getter saga
Something like that
But I think the publisher didn‚Äôt want that
Funny thing apparently they were gonna kill off Ryoma originally
||MUSASHI!!!!||
Everyone loves that guy
Musashi a goat
Ty!
Yeah the Getter Robo saga is great
The only thing they fear is Getter Robo
A subterranean empire that wants to kill all humans and retake the surface world
The leader of the dinosaur empire
Emperor Gor from Getter Robo
Oh yeah that infamous scene
It‚Äôs technically the cosmic horrors fault
Getter Rays can be good or evil.
It‚Äôs what you make of it
Getter emperor btw
Ishikawa‚Äôs art is next level
Getter Robo is so good
He‚Äôs a beefy man
A what if
Armageddon is it‚Äôs own continuity
Yeah
I so disagree with you
Rest In Peace king
Sadly he passed away so we will never know
I absolutely love Getter Emperor
The emperor is a lovecraftian horror basically
Can‚Äôt it be both?
My favorite op
https://youtu.be/qaJw6lqGFew
Too much pink energy is dangerous
She‚Äôs cute
Getter Rekka
Plus a girl team of getter pilots is awesome
I haven‚Äôt read Getter Robo High but I heard it‚Äôs insane in a fun way
The main pilot is named Benko
Takeo Midorikawa, the pilot of Getter Midoriho (The Getter-2 Equivalent) from the Getter Robo High Mahjong manga (art by Drill Jill). 

Before being a pilot, she was a prisoner on death row. Her crime was killing 100 wanted men who had harmed/killed women & children.
https://twitter.com/180223/status/1294173555513372672?s=21

Yes really
Also it has mahjong
It‚Äôs an AU story
Getter Robo high

Then there‚Äôs the getter Robo high team
From the PS1 game
Oh yeah
Benkei another good boy
Wonder what your thoughts on Benkei will be
G Gundam is great
At least the getter saga has been translated
Damn that sucks
Super robots: F*ck physics
*punches wall* Man I love Giant robots!
Only zero
No other robots
There‚Äôs only Mazinger now
Zero go brrrrr
It basically is one
Now who‚Äôs winning in a fight.
Getter Emperor or Mazinger Zero
Repeat
Form a getter emperor
Absorb the universe
The emperor demands to exist
In a way yeah
I find that concept so fascinating
Buddhism
Arc
Nice after that I believe is the Shin Getter Robo one shot.
Followed by Getter Robo Go
One of my favs
Yeah it is
Watching Video Warrior Laserion
I mean it‚Äôs good. But my overall reaction is just ok
It‚Äôs alright
Saw Demon Slayer
GAY
Just guessing
I don‚Äôt think so? I think it‚Äôs more of an example how in general during a war children can be very impressionable. And not see the full picture of things which can lead to negative consequences
Yeah he was a stunt pilot
Wait what?
Omfg
With Fighting General Daimos I now have the complete Robot Romance Trilogy
The designs feel like early 2000‚Äôs in the best way possible
Yeah!
And yet here are these cute animal friends
The mechs so real and military
I think that element is the one that interests me the most
Sunrise Beyonds new anime looks interesting
https://twitter.com/kyoukai_senki/status/1417710934454272004?s=21
There I said it
Rain has a nice butt
It awakened a lot of us
Very
The Nobel Gundam HG is a customizers dream
Allenby a good girl
Good girls

Yes
Yup
The Kamen Rider Symphogear connections grows deeper
https://twitter.com/raihanh98/status/1420749342093168650?s=21
SHE LOOKS EVEN MORE ADORABLE!
NANI?
No defending that one
Yeeeeeaaaaaah
Seriously though digimon has some like really rad designs
No denying that. But I appreciate the different direction that Savers took is all
WarGreymon is still cool as fuck
RizeGreymon is so badass
His Agumon has the coolest Greymon evolutions
Marcus is the man
But it was interesting
Well only the main guy does that
üôè
Thank you Digimon Tamers for Renamon
Anyways
May he Rest In Peace
Like that holds weight man
And knowing it was the last track he did
It is
The Tri version of Butterfly is so good
Like his music IS the franchise
When he passed that was a sad day indeed
Wada Kouji was a legend
Also the English op of Frontier has no right being as good as it is
I have a soft spot for Savers and I think Frontier was a nice experiment
‚ÄúMomentai!‚Äù
Tamers was amazing
That‚Äôs a given
Yeah no goggle head as far as I can tell
Little triceratops friend is my favorite
They look cute

Oh snap new Digimon
https://twitter.com/toeianimation/status/1422227923042410497?s=21
Must protecc
Also Erika is baby
Bless them for that
Oh yeah that moment was amazing!
Point is digimon cool
The ending especially
Hackers Memory‚Äôs story is amazing
They are really good
By the by if I had my way I would‚Äôve made a Digimon: Cyber Sleuth anime
Doesn‚Äôt help that in order to form SusanooMon it requires the power of all the spirits they collected up to that point
Not wrong
Although if I must criticize frontier on anything is that the red and blue dudes@of the team get all the cool stuff
Frontier was kids becoming the digimon.
A symbol of their partnership
Bio Merge was digimon and partner becoming one unit
Thats@different
Frontier tried to be different and I think it succeeded
But as time went on I have a soft spot for it
As someone who grew up during that time. It really was the people becoming digimon part that people had a problem with
No denying that
Legit good story telling
Like the Ken stuff? Great
It has to do with wether or not you think where the characters winding up in the future makes sense
But it‚Äôs mainly cuz of the ending
I don‚Äôt like it either
Inosuke is best boar
A world where fate illya didn‚Äôt have the icky fan service üôè
That world would be empty and hollow
Don‚Äôt discuss such things
When one journey kinda ends another begins
That just means to start a new anime to binge
Really enjoy the manga though. Horikoshi is An amazing artist
Not recent seasons because I heard how they were adapting certain arcs. And I‚Äôm not a fan
But I find the manga a more enjoyable read
The anime adaption is good at points
A friendly helpful lad
Izuku a good boy
Like who‚Äôs your fav and what not?
Your thoughts?
Awesome
A good girl
Klan Klang is awesome
No word on the cast yet. But this  is awesome
https://twitter.com/hidiveofficial/status/1423655107422474240?s=21
Oh?
They know what‚Äôs up!
And they started the trailer with ‚ÄúFrom the makers of Macross and Symphogear‚Äù
A new Satelight anime!

LETS GO
https://twitter.com/rightstufanime/status/1423796042814738432?s=21

That‚Äôs the shocking part
And with both English and Japanese tracks too!
Also
https://twitter.com/discotekmedia/status/1424134463244492803?s=21
WHAT
https://twitter.com/discotekmedia/status/1424142693173628930?s=21
Hype!
Ikr?

So I‚Äôm gonna start reading a thing
Can‚Äôt wait!
Alien time
Good releases
Yup
Yeah finding a piece of Anime history that could‚Äôve been lost forever
And saved Discotek even more work
But it was literally an amazing find
I can‚Äôt recall
No really
It was in a warehouse just sitting there because it was mislabeled
As a piece of anime history I think it will
In fairness that release was almost lost to time. And plus Robert woodhead finding the original masters of the film was awesome
But the OVA Cut AND a new English dub? That‚Äôs awesome!
<@87512939107450880> gaze upon the not Masaki
See this guy? He‚Äôs Masaki! Fun loving dimension hopping man with his cat friends!
Oh goddess what did I watch
Don‚Äôt do what I did
I saw the Cybuster anime
https://twitter.com/admiralblue5/status/1426461351925489666?s=21
My head is empty only C.C
Plus a ok plot that takes forever to develop
And masaki isn‚Äôt actually in the anime
Boring
I watched the anime for curiosity
It‚Äôs bad
Correct
There does exist a SRW OG anime
I have no idea
So 26 episodes of that nonsense
Oh and the Cybuster anime is 26 episodes
He‚Äôs MINO. Masaki in Name Only
That‚Äôs Masaki Kamijou
But man is the anime just so mediocre
As far as I can tell no
Cenia?
If you‚Äôre a fan of cybuster than that anime is the worst
Yeah
With the main character being named Ken Andoh
<@87512939107450880> also this guy is Named Masaki Kamijou
Instead that Masaki pilots some flame god mech
No that honor goes to a new kid named Ken
Yeah he doesn‚Äôt pilot Cybuster for the entire show
He‚Äôs the FIRST pilot of Cybuster
Because that guy is called Masaki
NO CLUE
Instead we got Prince of Darkness
Freaking legendary manga. Can‚Äôt wait to read Getter Robo G
Finished reading Getter Robo
Still a loss though
Oh yeah it‚Äôs a different Chiba my bad
Unless this is a different Chiba than the one I‚Äôm thinking of
Rest In Peace

You got my hopes up
Hello Detective Conan
Sentai Filmworks is legit
Yeah
I‚Äôm going to JoJoLand!
Yuka Iguchi is the lead girl!
The Blazing Gundam is awesome
5D‚Äôs is great

Ok more like Meh.
But I prefer the Manga
Hero Aca is good.
The anime adaption is eeeeeh
Wicked
One of my roommates is a warhammer fan.
And oh boy those model prices
I know it‚Äôs great
Noice
It‚Äôs another 78.
But man is the detail alone worth the build challenge
I‚Äôve debated on that one myself
Yeah.
But the newer stuff is really good
I have the 00 Gundam PG myself
Even normal master grade stuff
Nope
Just in general
Not referring to you
What I hate is scalpers
Ever since that major ship backup from a while back.
Plus the pandemic
To be fair there is a gunpla shortage
I wonder if they‚Äôd give us a sneak peak at any more dlc characters
Ah true
Can‚Äôt wait for the PBandai expo exclusives to go up later tonight.
I already have what I want lined up in my head
I think that‚Äôs neat
And the G Reco movies so far
https://youtu.be/kEQJm5wEv1g
Not a fan of the compilation movies but here they are
<@!99695384296701952> look what GundamInfo uploaded for the expo

https://youtu.be/Yis38brIuPw
I think it‚Äôs always being interrupted
Priorities and all
Like his magic is by all accounts useless.
Why would anyone deem him a threat?
Why waste time on a small fry master that can barely use a servant? We have a Berserker running around
It makes sense to me
Last Stardust is an amazing track
I really Like UBW for the Shirou and Archer fight.
And yeah people keep leaving Shirou alive bc for most of the story he‚Äôs not even really a threat.
Sure he has Saber by his side. But that can be mitigated.
Then I saw Zero and I found the contrast to be more night and day
I saw UBW first
I disagree
BABY GIRL
||Saber Alter vs Medusa has got to be one of the top fights I‚Äôve seen in quite awhile!||
Honestly probably my favorite movie trilogy I‚Äôve ever seen. And reminded me why I love the Fate franchise!
Shirou Emiya is in the short list for favorite characters of all time!
I got done with the Heavens Feel Trilogy a little bit ago
Seeing it animated for the first time ever? WORTH IT!
What‚Äôs more insane is that the last two episodes will be completely original. So we have no idea what will happen
Episode 11 is airing next week? This week? And it‚Äôs gonna be insane
https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2021-09-10/digimon-ghost-game-tv-anime-reveals-cast-staff-october-3-debut/.177206
Main Visual for Digimon Ghost Game!
So while one could make a Jesus parallel with the kid. It‚Äôs important to note that he did not ask for his abilities
As far as he knew he was just an average joe coordinator
The thing with Kira is that his dad wanted him to become the ultimate coordinator.
The next step in human evolution.
Which obviously Kira knew nothing about. At least towards the end of the series
All culminating in the idea of a ‚Äúcoordinator‚Äù someone who can process information at much higher speeds and preform tasks at almost inhuman levels
But then people who weren‚Äôt born genetically augmented or ‚ÄúNaturals‚Äù got really pissed off and really racist towards those who did get such treatments
At first it was stuff like longer life, healthier bodies, eye color. That sorta thing
At some point in SEEDs history people got this idea that genetically engineering babies was a super cool idea
Kinda
But then people‚Äôs own fear and biases led to strife and tragedy
It literally started out with good intentions
Kinda yeah
I just haven‚Äôt seen it
Nothing against it
No
Mercury witch? Sounds cool
Enjoyed Code Lyoko
That‚Äôs a show I haven‚Äôt heard of in ages
https://www.dailymotion.com/video/x7rwa89
Idol girls vs Idol Girls
Second Raid was really good
????
I thought KyoAni did FMP the second raid
Who also voiced Seto Kaiba
Eric Stuart voiced Gourry
Yeah the people who dubbed Slayers were professionals
I think they said Ragna blade
The cast of pokemon playing DND
The Slayers Dub is god tier too
Watching this
Never under estimate a woman that‚Äôs hungry
And Illyas Shirou in this universe is all housewife material
Also Mama Iri
I think they should kiss and make up/out
It‚Äôs great
Luvia and Rin are still eternal rivals
What‚Äôs even more frustrating? Prisma Illya technically exists in the good timeline.
Iri and Kiritsugu is alive.
Shirou is her brother.
She has her maids
I‚Äôll steal your stuff while you‚Äôre gone.
Which is what the animation does at times and it‚Äôs like bad.
Like real bad.
Like I wanted to turn myself into the cops bad
Like why
There are very not appropriate scenes that were blips on the radar in the manga.
But SL decided to ‚ÄúExpand‚Äù on those scenes and make things very uncomfortable
And all the bad parts of Prillya are like really bad and there is nothing wrong with not liking it.
Heck Silver Link I believe does the story a disservice at times
I guess when the news of the collab hit.
My mind didn‚Äôt think of the bad.
It went immediately to ‚ÄúOh snap two franchises I love are coming together! Cool!‚Äù
I feel like crap rn
Am I terrible person for liking Prillya? But I fully condemn every single bad part about it?
I had a feeling the ending was coming
Zouken I means
F*ck that abusing POS
Shirou being a housewife is the universal constant
I blame the anime studio honestly.
But then I realized he‚Äôs just super fickle like the worlds most dangerous cat
Used to hate the guy wholesale
Gilgamesh I‚Äôve come to appreciate
https://youtu.be/fn1JAY6M6jU
Damn Miyu
Or was it Miyu that said that?
Taiga is too real
Goodnight
Digimon Ghost Game was fun!
Baby
Can‚Äôt wait to see more!
Can‚Äôt wait for Gridman x Dynazenon
But Dynazenon is just a better character piece on the whole
I mean Gridman was good don‚Äôt get me wrong
Better than
Finished DYNAZENON.
It was awesome!
Stupid NFT‚Äôs!

Anyways back to work love y‚Äôall
Oh yeah the 7Page Muda is like SO GOOD!
Well at least Purple Haze Feedback exists
In fairness Purple Haze would be so dangerous to use in almost any other setting
He was going through some dark stuff at the time
Supposedly Araki had a hard time writing Fugo leaving the group
And it makes total sense why it can‚Äôt be used all the time
Oh yeah that fight was fun
My favorite Stand is probably Stone Free.
Oh yeah that was from the excellent True Mans World arc
Also President Funny Valentine
I love it
Part 7 is a road trip to find Jesus and there‚Äôs a dinosaur man running around
Which is a fair critique ngl
It‚Äôs like ‚ÄúOOOOOOH! That‚Äôs how that works!‚Äù
King Crimson was done such justice in the anime
My personal favorite part though is Part 5.
It‚Äôs so in character for DIO to just mess with his opponent before actually trying to kill them
Exactly!
The build up and reveal of that Stand was amazing imo!
Well also Part 3 was Araki‚Äôs first time doing Stands.
So not everything is super perfect.
I will 100% defend ZA WARUDO
I need the C.C mug
YO CODE GEASS MERCH
To be fair that was Kakyoin under the Influence of DIO via flesh bud.
So while the stand *can* do it.
Kakyoin doesn‚Äôt because it would be a sign of evil
I mean a space Metal that fuses with your body and morphs into some kind of monster
Yeah those things are horrifying when you stop and look at em
It has hiccups but still awesome
That story has been pretty awesome so far
You mean Betterman vs GaoGaiGar?
Just the thought gave me a chuckle
I‚Äôm not saying I would combine them
And then bam elfen lied
Like bright spandex in one part of the world
That would be funny though
I like it when a world can have two different genres going on at the same time
But the fact that it‚Äôs the GaoGaiGar universe is just surreal
I haven‚Äôt seen it myself
Nice
So happy for Kira getting the part of Jolyne! She‚Äôs always wanted the part for so long!
Tamaki good

FUCK YES

Gonna be listening to that for the next forever
Macross songs dropped worldwide
He is
I CAN‚ÄôT UNSEE IT NOW
God the Cybuster anime was so bad
A LOT from the light novels
They compressed a lot
Also in fairness to the show
But yeah K&M is a fine show
Essentially Ernie hit the jackpot with the Isekai
And it‚Äôs really a job of solving logic puzzles
And programming is not easy
He poured ALL OF HIS TIME AND EFFORT into It
Basically as a kid once he realized mechs are a thing in the fantasy world
It‚Äôs never too late
Yup
He just does
Also I love how Ernie doesn‚Äôt talk down to others
So it‚Äôs not fair to compare
Ernie is basically a prodigy
To be fair
He has no times for ladies
Total Chad
He is a Chad!
He‚Äôs a very pretty boy
That‚Äôs a compression
They compressed 4 light novels of story into 13 episodes
That‚Äôs when I‚Äôll be free to watch
Or rather I can‚Äôt wait for next Saturday
Can‚Äôt wait for the 1st
Stand Proud!
I can‚Äôt wait for the two to team up!
Dynazenon is even better
Gridman is good civilization
To be fair no one saw that coming
Like my girl Aoi Zaizen was done so dirty
I really hated Vrains
Since it sounds it has things that make Yugioh fun
I will say I want to watch sevens
Ernie‚Äôs enthusiasm is so darn infectious and cute!
It‚Äôs so cool!
But sure let‚Äôs green light another Isekai show from a light novel no one has heard of
üôÉ
It‚Äôs a shame there‚Äôs only that one season
The Ikaruga isn‚Äôt just for show!
Awesome!
But I am happy to hear Sevens is going over well with fans for the most part
Since I want to start from the beginning
I want those early 12 episodes to be subbed already
<@!156893455010758659> where are you watching sevens? Torrents?
I mean a hero with a loss win record is rare
Oh the fact the MC has lost is a big plus
That‚Äôs cool
Rush duels by nature seem chaotic but fair
But anything can happen
Like you may guess who‚Äôll win
Which is how a game is supposed to go
I *HATE* that duel
Especially her duel against soulburner
But man Vrains and what they did to Aoi I could never forgive them for that
And at least Aki is cool
She is
Love u 2!
Another way of saying cool
You‚Äôre gonna like it!
Kino!
But still really good
DYNAZENON is a bit more character focused
The ending is so good! ||BABY DAN DAN!||
Gridman is awesome
*Smacks self for that one*
Symphogear invented genocide
BABY DAN DAN!
I‚Äôm just saying
Oh it doesn‚Äôt
Yes
||Akane is a very damaged person mentally||
She‚Äôs at her limit
Eyup!
Ikr?
Yes
||You know sharing the same name as a bad guy is so surreal||=
Because Duel Disk is a freaking rad as a hell name
DSOD was Kaiba wanting to see his BF one last time
||Akane basically woke up and is gonna face the real world now||
Nobel Gundam is the greatest thing
The Nether Gundam has never received a model kit for they fear it‚Äôs power

I mean Yugioh has dabbled in space before
I enjoyed it
It‚Äôs really good

It‚Äôs the manga
Oh yeah! Chainsaw Man Part 2 School Arc!
Adds to the charm
And I don‚Äôt mind it
It‚Äôs honestly glorious

Gays
I just saw Promare
Promare and Kill La Kill are awesome!
Full Metal Panic!!
I don‚Äôt like motorbike battleships and abysmal sexist writing yes
Gundam Seed Destiny done.
Overall there are parts I hated. Parts I really enjoyed!
So I‚Äôm gonna give it like a 7/10.
Victory Gundam is still the worst Gundam related thing I‚Äôve ever seen
Imagine putting other action figures in that one
The power loader yeah
Promare even!

<@279341087494242304> look at all this!

Made this for funsies
Noooooo!
Now it‚Äôs GunxSword time!
Finished AXZ again. I enjoyed it!
That‚Äôs just me though
For me the early S2 stuff is rough.
But once they are in space it‚Äôs hype city
I think everyone agrees the second half can be rough in spots
TTGL is a fun time
That was when it was still Gainax I believe
Oh yeah KLK does have themes that sound utterly ridiculous but profund at the same time
Kill La kill was such a strong start for Studio Trigger
It‚Äôs like super awesome
Oh the show gets nuts
I genuinely love Satsuki as a character though.
I find her psychology fascinating and she commands attention with like everything she does.
üôÉ
Because I am alone in life
I‚Äôm always thirsty
You killed me
Way to go
*melts and dies*
*Gets hit with water*
Mako is best!
Satsuki is a queen and I kneel before her
Oh Kill La Kill! Love that anime! One of my favs!
Mako is a bundle of adorable chaos
Amazing
Oh yeah
Especially the ones where Mako is like ‚ÄúRYOKO HAS BIGGER BREASTS COMPARED TO YOU!‚Äù
Her Hallelujah saves are amazing
Mako is like the best friend we wish we had
Ryoko and Mako are girlfriends and I won‚Äôt be convinced otherwise
But yeah <@!331908049822547978> k hope you enjoy the rest of KLK!
*Throws self in trash can*
And a simp
But I‚Äôm a simple woman
That‚Äôs an easy answer I know
Though in terms of grand finales Getter Robo Armageddon lives in my head rent free
*Tosses you Maria pics*

I think FMP is a consistently good show
To see him gone so suddenly is just‚Ä¶
Damn
He was so influential on my childhood.
Yugioh still holds a special place in my heart
Fuck
Like

Them!
She has the right idea
Right? Gundam Seed is good!
Symphogear Shinai vibes
Yeah this anime is gonna be great!
||Honestly Flay I hated for a good chunk of the show. But seeing her come around only to be manipulated by the end is upsetting. But the real kicker was Mu‚Äôs sacrifice.
The whole finale of SEED is really well handled imo||

I think with Okouchi it‚Äôs who else is paired with them that will decide things

But after watching the series I grew to like the dude
It depend on how you view that type of character
Like a very supportive friend dude
He‚Äôs basically the only person that likes Ange for being herself and just wants her safe
Or tries to ascend into the status of being one
Again Embryo also being Akira Tachibana is just funny to me
If only for Tsubasa Ange jokes
I still wanna see a Cross Ange x Symphogear crossover
Heck just giving it a chance I‚Äôm happy with
I think it‚Äôs nice that people have watched the show and are giving it an evaluation
If the plot doesn‚Äôt vibe with you then it doesn‚Äôt vibe. That‚Äôs fine <:CeobeOk:973368493984583690>

I get it now
HA
I guess I‚Äôll understand this joke later
I‚Äôll be part of the cool kids club
Gonna be watching Lyocris Recoil tonight gamers
Oh really? Niceu
Crisis with infinite Kouji‚Äôs
Oh and let‚Äôs not forget how in Victory the Feds just kinda gave up and went meh.
All while a space empire was building its forces and killing people left and right
Though this is sorta my hot take but I always found the Federation to not always be on the up and up either
I see what you mean.
Dendrobium Orchus unit fucks
Stardust is meh. Some good some bad.
Victory is trash tier for me
I think Gundam Wing is good
Oh it has problems but I think there was potential and some solid ideas
I‚Äôm actually one of those weird people that think F91 isn‚Äôt that bad of a movie
The F91 Gundam kinda slaps imo.
I have seen the light
Lyocris Recoil is really good
SHE DOES? Incredible
Hung up my Kallen Wall scroll finally and all feels right with the world
It‚Äôs legitimately perfect casting
What until you hear Dr.Hell
Ikr?
I find it funny that she is the voice of both Yukiko and Kallen.
Yes
Queen!

I‚Äôd ask trying too hard in what?
This is Araki we are talking about here.
I think it‚Äôs fine
Also Jodio Joestar is a funny name.
We have a JoJo with DIO in the name
I love these stand names!
Jodio is the alternate universe Giorno
Calling it now
||also the new JoJo is allegedly called JoDio||
||stands name is supposedly November Rain||
NEW JOJO WITH HIS STAND!
But the bonds we make with others can slowly help us with that little by little
Some people can do it easily. Others can‚Äôt
Communication is hard
Yes it is
11111000/10 Gundam moment
Well there are times where fists don‚Äôt work and you need to be open and honest with yourself.
So it‚Äôs a deeply personal anime for me
That really resonates with me since I too have anger issues
It‚Äôs the story of a man learning to let go of his anger and become a better person
G Gundam is my favorite anime/show of all time
I can‚Äôt wait to see the full extent of November Rains power
HOLY SHIT
https://twitter.com/saikonihai/status/1626261981526122497?s=46&t=Wh2y0UWnvNaIkoUlTC_NAw
The people are hungry for the JoJo
Still think it‚Äôs funny that Jojo crashed mangadex
Filthy frank is in jojo. Nice
Mhm
But my money is on trans
It‚Äôs too early to tell.
It‚Äôs possible that the translator got the pronouns wrong.
But it‚Äôs also just as likely we have a trans jojo character who is a literal JoBro.
We will have to see how the character develops
It‚Äôs just funny
JojoLands chapter 1 doesn‚Äôt have anything in it that makes reading part 8 vitally necessary.
But I have a feeling that may change
Correct
I love how we are dealing with siblings this time around
Yeah it‚Äôs only the English dub and localization that has the name changes because copyright
https://twitter.com/julienforts/status/1626260466581250048?s=46&t=OhzgJmGhX-HD2ySBILsHvA
Also since this part is taking place in Hawaii time to make magnum P.I jokes
I loved listening to this song as a kid so seeing a stand named after one of Guns and Roses other songs is great
And when your fears subside
And shadows still remain, oh yeah
I know that you can love me when there's no one left to blame
So never mind the darkness, we still can find a way
'Cause nothin' lasts forever, even cold November rain
There has only been one stand named after a Japanese band/song  and it was called Chocolate Disco
And it was awesome
SBR is Araki Taking old ideas and remixing them and seeing what works
This part is set in modern day so I‚Äôd say that‚Äôs a fair bet
This is a story all about getting that sweet money
Can‚Äôt stop thinking about them

LETS GO
https://twitter.com/nge064/status/1626275271203762177?s=46&t=tAyBep7SNwA_4ca3Dlb9ZQ
Or maybe if we are dealing with protags that steal stuff.
Maybe stand fights will be the result of them breaking into a place and trying to overcome the stand of whoever or whatever is living there
So give me more one on one fistfights
But how the fight itself plays out is a bit predictable at a point
Now those automatic stands themselves could be super interesting
I mean Part 8 is decent but man those fights were all over the place
Hopefully this part will have less automatic stand type fights
Maybe it is a direct combat stand. But how it works is atypical
Johnny was about starting in the negatives and crawling his way back to zero and beyond
Well Part 8 Josuke was about his coming to terms with his identity
I love D4C

I guess in the sense that it tends to be misunderstood
Personally i think the story of cross Ange is good on its own merits.
SRW V was just a bonus
Ange has a complete character arc. There are some detestable villains and the action is pretty solid!
If you temper your expectations and take the show for what it is it‚Äôs honestly not a bad time
Well. I really liked it.
The earnestness and honesty about what it is.
That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs awesome
Also it‚Äôs a bit gay
Makes me invested in golf
Birdie Wing is legit really fun
GOLF IS BACK
CLEAR YOUR FUCKING CALENDARS!

But I can say don‚Äôt fuck with the engineer
I haven‚Äôt read it myself
At least top tier for me
Rau
Also SEED has a top tier villain imo
I like SEED because it Zigs where 0079 Zagged
Rereading JoJolion
Oh and the ending of Victory was just god awful
Oh and the treatment of female characters in victory makes me really pissed
Victory has terrible plotting, annoying characters and is actually pretentious as hell.
Victory makes me legit angry
The only Gundam I regret watching is Victory.
Oh it‚Äôs not good but it isn‚Äôt the worst thing ever either.
I‚Äôm glad I watched it
Destiny is legit not that bad
Cringe worthy plot. Like really cringe
Character assassinations all over the place
Exactly
That was it
Ok on earth maybe but then in space why use them? It bothers the crap out of me
Not really?
I actually don‚Äôt like the designs of Victory
Also wheels in space makes no goddamn sense even for Gundam
I agree with this
You can be mad at executives but don‚Äôt rank a show on purpose because of it
Which if that‚Äôs true that‚Äôs not a valid excuse
A NORMAL ASS ROCKET LAUNCHER
OH AND HOW A ROCKET LAUNCHER DESTROYED THE ASSAULT BUSTERS SHOULDER ARMOR?
Basically Destiny I can see what they were trying to do but didn‚Äôt quite succeed in for one reason or another.
Victory just has little redeeming qualities in the end for me
Dunbine I really enjoyed
Cuz some 80‚Äôs Tomino shows are pretty decent
Only done badly
How does that work? You saying newtypes are genetic now?
Like what?
Yes exactly frustrating is a great way to describe it
Like ok sure let‚Äôs stick a baby in her
Oh and then she‚Äôs pregnant too
I love how there‚Äôs a female character  Marbet who had a relationship with this commander guy? Who we barely know and yet we are supposed to feel sad when he dies
Oh yeah there were too many creepy moments in that show and not in the good way
He had exploding pants
Uso relied too much on detaching his legs and then exploding them
‚ÄúLets seduce the young Uso into submission with bikini babes!‚Äù
Like what the actual fuck was the point of that?
Also the bikini girl death scene
Also how the hell did you fill those rings with all those psychics? I mean having that many people with psychic potential is just absurd to me
My issue was how the super weapon didn‚Äôt have any really established rules for how it works.
Like sometimes if you‚Äôre close it works and other times it doesn‚Äôt????
Hey everyone let‚Äôs pray the conflict away and all use psychic bullsh*t to solve everything!
THAT SONG IS BADASS
