That seems more like a "Smug-Ha" to me
This image specifically
I cropped this from a much larger image where Berserk Hibiki is smol
Actually, I don't think that would help because I just remembered
It's not an image I took so I can't do much about that
:BeserkWhy: is the working title of the image
I completely forgot that I had this image and was wondering if it's possible for an emote to be made out of it
I present a new member to possibly add to our set of crazy emotes
CarolBroken
ChrisCry
<:Mariachu:689561918054465675>
A friend in another server I'm in pointed out how this kinda looks like the surprised Pikachu face
MariaSurprised
That wideness adds to the emote tbh
<:PeepoYes:625689369185091584>
Wait, is it possible to make a flag emote for *all* of the symphogirls?
<a:ChrisFlag:714307162255523842>
It *might* work if you could brighten the image slightly
MichaPoint, perhaps?
<:HibikiTachipogga:723248846662271007>
<:PekoeNo:510951174782844928>
Please no
I present Germaingry
But it conveys the same feeling regardless
That face says "yikes" more than "cringe"
HibikiYikes perhaps
<:MaulerFeels:529740188755427367>
Ah

<@216639562275880961>
Less "nuked" and more "mass exodus from the most active members to make yet another Symphogear-themed server"
Basically, the only real differences it has aside from member count is that they don't mind posting loli stuff (though most of what was posted was exclusively Carol) and that people can say the R-word
They don't aren't even really that offensive over there anyway barring like one infamous member that literally never talks there anymore

Idk
Someone in another server I'm in saw this in a dream they had and decided to draw it

Ahh
I recognize Cag and Finé, but who are the other two?
This is still one of my favorite pieces of Sympho-art. It never fails to make me laugh

Yeah, Black Lagoon was the first anime I ever watched
And no, I don't count stuff I saw when I was too young to know what anime was (like Digimon, YuGiOh, etc.)

Preferably not from Pixiv because I've already combed through that site for her
Seeing as her B-day is 3 days away, I require all the Kirikas that you have
I was kinda banking on there being a pixiv link
I wish I had the sauce for this

There's a smaller server I'm in where it seems like half of the people there are bi guys thirsting for Astfolfo
I thought so
Is that even fanart? It looks like something that would be in XDU

Generally I try to judge people based off what they say over what emotes they use

The "no rules" thing I feel could only really work on some kind of invite-only forum
Probably because they didn't think someone would actually plan something like that on a *public* forum
My bad then
Ah

Yeah
And I don't even go to 4chan
People always say it's bad, but 90% of the stuff I see there is stuff like this
No point in spending money to go there when you don't know what you want to major in
I didn't even bother with college

Not putting it down just yet, but I'm lowering it
So I'm in party of people who think people are being *way* too reactionary about the movie
*With that said however*, I don't particularly blame them given the movie's offensively bad marketing
In addition, here's the movie's creator's comments on their movie
Ye

<@213645184125239317> tbf I've seen a few who hate Coco because of the fact she's corrupting the more "pure" V-tubers
Tbh most of the people I've seen complaining about V-tubers have been the types with either an irrational hatred for anime, a hatred for typical "ethots" and thinking that V-tubers are no different, or both
Goes to show just how reliable most journalism is now <:15min:495770478678638593>
Yeah, from what I've seen most social media nowadays has became way too ingrained in daily life to really be considered "private businesses" anymore

I remember seeing somebody on Twitter (don't remember how popular they were) trying to say her tweet was conflating any fantasy movie or show with an asian aesthetic as an Avatar redux
<:raaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaagh:521745466078003200>
"nooooooooo how dare they put the gay colors on the show that is quite blatantly gay"

Which is like
I mean, it's not *that* unusual
I remember a good while back when I saw someone else on twitter angrily say they left this discord after its icon got changed to the one it has currently
The one that was all "love is bs and illogical" and had an (ironically) irrational hatred towards cute animal pictures

Because that girl didn't seem to give one
Either way, he's 83 now so if he doesn't end up getting done in by someone deciding to enact some vigilante justice, natural causes will get him soon-ish
To add on to this, the judges also apparently found that "testimony from accusers outside of the case had tainted the trial."
The public?
That still doesn't explain how this robs them since you're paying the government, not them
<:HibikiWhat:336656482907193344>

This is my favorite reply to that tweet
https://twitter.com/CrashFan03/status/1414905829501849607?s=19
Just reeks of massive hypocrisy to me
Late reply, but what makes that even more frustrating was that the reason they gave for banning him was that it was a politically charged statement and they don't want that in their tournaments
But then when the BLM movement was around its peak last year, they were among the many other companies that tweeted their support of it
I should make it clear that I don't really care about them supporting BLM so much as I care about them saying that *after* the whole Blitzchung incident and their completely lackluster response and late apology about the incident
There's also that whole thing with Jordan Shanks still going on over there afaik
The company ~~management~~ is crap
Also, it's not that person you're thinking of anyway
A person with an over 50-part documentary series about them

Let's just say he partook in a popular Alabamian pasttime

I was lowkey a little sad when he did because we're never going to get anything that's as uniquely deluded as the stuff he posted
He also had a meltdown over a trans flag in Celeste that took up approximately .25% of the one image it was in

It's about as funny as a pyromaniac saying they're a firefighter or something like that
I think I know who you're talking about and I believe they were *also* baiting with that
It is
Not really
There's definitely weirder hills I can think of

So these are apparently the highest rated anime of 2019
<:Despair:456498672507682817> <:Despair:456498672507682817> <:Despair:456498672507682817>
OH GOD NOT AGAIN
I'M NOT READY
<:PeepoOkay:561681332691009547>
I think it's good
So I just finished Violet Evergarden
<@238855496797257729> I mean in the sense that I'm watching something that I am aware gets pretty sad
I think I'm going to bite the bullet and finally watch Violet Evergarden
That's argument's gone on for about as long as the Rei vs. Asuka debate

I just can't stand his voice
He is cringe, but not as cringe as Nux
I legit forgot about Lost Pause
Never again <:PeepoIgnore:587847054320205846>
Tried watching a few videos of his
Nux Taku on the other hand
Gigguk is good bean <:ShiraBean:661294258795446326>
Gigguk is on my list of YTers that I watch, but not enough to warrant subbing to them
Which sucks because the concept of a YuGiOh protagonist that *isn't* particularly good at the game would've been interesting
I could only watch the first several episodes of Zexal before I got sick of Yuma
<:PepeCringe:562801062659227658>

So I got a completely random question:
If someone who is totally not me wanted to start watching Railgun, would they have to watch Index beforehand to understand anything?
Yeah, someone else in another server I'm in started watching Fate as well and started with the Deen one being well aware of its quality
<:PeepoThink:621867477822996531>
So Fate/Stay Night spoils Fate/Zero...
And Fate/Zero spoils Fate/Stay Night?
I thought it spoiled Heaven's Feel
My bad
That's what I meant, yeah
Since it's the prequel to UBW afaik
Zero
<:cookieSCREM:509775323219361802>
Oh god
I'm doing it
I'm starting Fate
I can't stop myself
Which was about 4 years ago
Going by that logic, Black Lagoon is technically the first anime I watched
Tbh I don't even count YuGiOh, Digimon, or the other standard anime series most people saw in their childhood in the list of anime I've seen because I watched them at a time when I didn't even know what anime was
Found them on YouTube so I can just start on them after finishing Fate
I still need to watch the OVAs for it
Black Lagoon's dub is <:TsubasaBliss:672861879000891432>
I've heard that Overlord's dub isn't too shabby either
My personal rule is that I will watch anime dubbed unless either
A) It has no dub (like with Symphogear), or
B) The dub is *really* bad
I've never watched SAO so I don't even know what Kirito sounds like
~~Have I mentioned I plan on watching the dubbed versions?~~
Yeah I wasn't planning on watching any other Fate stuff beyond Zero and UBW
Ye
I finished on episode 13 (the 45 minute one aside from the prologue)
Yeah, it's refering to them as "parts"
I like it <:PeepoOkay:561681332691009547>
I have just finished what Netflix says is the first season for UBW
Also ||big <:payrespects:635335372544409600> for Rider||
I'm a little less than a quarter way through Fate/Zero and I'm starting to think I should have watched this before UBW like my original plan was <:MaulerFeels:529740188755427367>
Probably helps that he gives me big Genjuro vibes
Rider is now officially my favorite character in the show
I just finished episode 11 of Fate/Zero
I liked it <:PeepoOkay:561681332691009547>
Like the out-of-place blaster sound effects
Because one of them already saw it and wanted us to watch it for all the hilariously bad stuff in it
<:KirikaDisgust:688431636043268097>
I just watched the first 4 episodes of Deen/Stay Night with a couple friends
According to MyAnimeList:
- Original Anime
- Director of Mob Psycho 100 S1, S2 & Death Parade
- Animation Studio (*Nut*) that handled Tanya the Evil
- Writer that handled a large amount of Attack on Titan S1, S2, S3 - Part 2, and handled the series composition for Vinland Saga
<:PeepoHmm:587844096266207234>
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zR4M-LBKX7I
Either go all in or not at all <:Germain:421434126856486912>
"Something else" in a good or bad way?
From what little research I did on it, it seems to be Madoka Magicka mixed with Evangelion
Now that my 3rd Symphogear watchthrough is over, I randomly remembered that this show was airing the same season as XV was
https://youtu.be/SzsBE4lNs8o
You are welcome <:PeepoWell:657820030565613599>
I'm pretty sure the only point where the eroge parts were actually important beyond just the "mana transfer" excuse was ||during the Heaven's Feel route||
I just watched some clips of Fate/Zero and got reminded of how good the dub is for it
I forgot just how good that episode is, and it was already one of my favorite episodes of Fate in general
I just rewatched the king episode of Fate/Zero with some friends who haven't seen it
<:Please:708190120578121728>
Tfw my watch buddies gave Fate/Zero's first season a 4/10
<:youremakingmenervous:696478476659851286>
I didn't give anything a 3/10
Zero's action scenes are way slower compared to them
Nah, that's UBW and Heaven's Feel
He gave season 1 a 4/10 and season 2 a 6/10
Overall, he thinks the show sucked and wants to know why people seem to like it so much
So I just finished rewatching Fate/Zero with a friend who hasn't seen it but has seen the other Stay Night shows
But he's asleep atm so not right now
He's still in this server afaik so you could ask him for further elaboration
<@279341087494242304> I know the main problems he had with it were the exposition dumps (which he felt were done better in Stay Night proper) and how much the characters seemed to value honor and chivalry and stuff
I'm rewatching Black Lagoon with a couple friends and I'm being reminded as to why it's my favorite anime
<:HollowVibin:677236728075124790>
<:ChrisHappyTears:642227942763528203>
GOD, why is Black Lagoon such a good show?
One of my friends absolutely *despises* tsundere characters and so far Chris is the only tsundere character he actually likes
<:YumiPoint:688429724103344164>
<:ShemHaEvil:642229421062750208>
So I just finished the Madoka Magicka movie with a couple friends
They are confused beyond words
Same
As far as Eva goes, someone in another server I'm in said a while back that he thinks reasonable Eva discourse is a rare thing because the show primarily attracts two types of people:
1. Those who genuinely don't get it and call it overrated trash because of that
2. Pretentious 2deep4u types who overhype the show
Then he watched UBW, then HF, and then Zero (which he hated)
Yeah, my friend started with Deen/Stay Night knowing it's the worst of the Fate animes just to get it out of the way
<:ElsaSick:689395768754569359>
And the western anime industry wonders why piracy is still an issue with the medium
https://twitter.com/SavedYouAClickV/status/1280077675974008839?s=19
I'm still not entirely sure whether or not I liked Gleipnir
<:PeepoWut:621824945525227570>
<:MaulerFeels:529740188755427367>
Well, after 12 episodes I think me and my friends are dropping Re:Creators
<:PeepoWell:657820030565613599>
1. Get Nitro
2. ???
3. Profit
Is gud show <:PeepoGlad:587844095037276207>
Just began watching Jormungand with some friends
I'm beginning to see one similarity between Jormungand and Black Lagoon:
The complete non-existence of a Worst Girl™ <:PeepoGlad:587844095037276207>
<:PeepoWell:657820030565613599>

<@152896851660505088> Mobile actually did show multiple images after a certain, fairly recent update but they seemed to have reverted it for whatever reason
<:ShweesUgly:664644046563573761>
Don't make me fall down the Precure one too
Pls no, I already fell down the Symphogear rabbit hole

<:PeepoHurt:621868040450998282>
There's a guy in another server I'm in that hates the movie for merely existing <:FeelsCringeMan:624420296618672150>
<:HibikiTachipogga:723248846662271007>

Netflix are announcing a lot of new anime rn 👀
It feels like whoever animated this heard of Monty Oum but only watched small bits and pieces of his work
<:15min:495770478678638593>
Hey now, cut them some slack, this is their first SFM animation
50/90
Ver's in there too somewhere
<:PeepoSusp:621867411922223105>
~~Not like Weiss has much competition in that show~~

Unless the person watching is a virgin weeb
My b
I must have missed it <:MaulerFeels:529740188755427367>
Oh, you did?
Imagine your animation skills being so awful that you need to censor a kiss so you don't have to animate it
https://twitter.com/CanipaShow/status/1351372112318009346?s=19
Or at least, he's useless against anyone with any semblance of combat training
I'm about halfway through Re:Zero's first season and I am very impressed at how thoroughly anti-power fantasy the show is despite its main character being technically immortal
<:PekoWut:763235888787750912>
So I just got to episode 15 of Re:Zero
<a:PeepoHappy:718014558794547231>
https://twitter.com/GS55956700/status/1361346657900761096?s=19
I just got to the iconic "I love Emilia" line in Re:Zero
Slightly ahead of Tanya the Evil
Probably my favorite of the Isekai Quartet shows
I just finished Re:Zero's first season
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
No, because the show somehow manages to keep one-upping itself in how awful it is
I just assumed it was Discotek because I bought at the same place I bought Symphogear <:MaulerFeels:529740188755427367>
Yeah, Discotek has both of the UBW seasons at like over 100$
Discotek does
Aniplex doesn't sell the blu-rays
80$ in total
These finally came in <:PeepoYay:562818314112466964>
<:ChrisCry:690041263973859349>

<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
Still not enough for me to want to watch it, but it slaps
Okay, so this slaps

I honestly don't mind if ufotable actually did evade taxes if they can make all their stuff look even half as good as that movie <:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
I just finished watching Heaven's Feel 3
I'd ask for context but I'm planning on watching the show myself eventually so I'll find out anyway
<:Ogey:763235888787750912>
I just finished the first cour of Re:Zero's 2nd season
The only thing I have to say is:
>CR doubling down on the sus translation
ngl that's a power move I have to respect

In other news, the new Godzilla anime is being freed from Netflix Anime Jail soon

We finally got to the episode with *that* scene
So I started Higurashi (the Deen one) with some friends about na week ago
https://youtu.be/hnQOO8Y1Ck0
So I just finished the first season of Higurashi
Despite knowing most of the twists already, I thouroughly enjoyed it even though ||the sudden mention of aliens near the end made me think I was watching a Studio Trigger anime||

Yeah, from what I've heard only the 1st season has the major lolicon pandering and it gets toned down as the series goes on

Chainsaw Man's cast got leaked
<a:VibingCat:741549789166174349>
Still my favorite anime in general
So I just finished Yuuki Yuuna
Little discheesed that the ending pulls the same thing Symphogear S1's ending did but the execution was fine enough that I wasn't too bothered by it
Now for anyone who's watched the show, what is the proper watch order for it because none of the seasons are labeled numerically
I have made another addition to my Kino Collection
I just finished the first 3 episodes of RWBY: Ice Queendom
jfc, I need a brace for how breakneck-fast they were going
Now I await for the character that I've already decided is Best Girl™ based off her design alone
<:dodgeapprove:949852962849685504>

Okay, so quick question just to clarify: does the XV ova mean that Chris is now 19, or has her 18th birthday not happened yet at this point?

I figured
Just to clarify, do we put memes related to the new shinai in here or is it alright to post them in the proper meme channels?
