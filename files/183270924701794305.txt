Legit laughed when I saw that in GX
That Samurai noise
Oh yeah
*tells that to the lewdest loli*
Kinda normal that she is flat
Shirabe is still a loli
<@506219877724454929> now I'm interested tho
|| why isn't that in spoiler tag ||
*commits suicide*
The episode appears on Crunchyroll
dess
But VRV is fucking with me and even tho it appears after 1 hours of it being aired, it just says "Connection Error" for usually a good hour
Should be less than 6 hours for the translation
That means less than 7 hours to get it with translation
Less than 5 hours left for Symphogear to be aired
What is that YameteTometeSubs
I am legit wondering
That was def surprisingly
LOL
The Custodian
Oh the enemy that turned out to be the good guy appeared
I almost cried when that song started to play
That was truly epic tho
I didn't expect that song to be used here
Legit finishing watching the new EP
She alone defeated all the coffins in one hit
That couldn't have been possible
But the Symphogear intro points out to some story parts
Well true
But she didn't appear in GX and AXZ intro
Fine is mentioned through all Symphogear seasons
Intro only I am talking
At the concert
I legit thought that would have been a Kanade flashback
Fine was missing in GX and AXZ
Iirc
If you look at the intros
No but
Which iirc was missing in GX and AXZ
She is clearly in the intro
Well I expect Fine to come up at some point
But still holds tremendous power
Well you can say the same of Gungnir
The other gears tho were created by Ryouko
If you look closely
Is Enki's arm
That thing where that scorpion hides
And I just realized
Yup
And maybe Miku returning with Shenshoujin Faust Robe
With more action for Ogawa brothers
I want a whole new season
You want the 13 ep
"Senki Zessho"
Also I am wondering about this ep name
That isn't a mistranslation prob
Legit cried
The episode was so good
HOLY MOLY
A new version of Gyakko no Flugel
If you mean the ending song of this episode
A new version of Gyakko no Flugel <@87512939107450880>
Destroyed
Since the end of G
OG noise are long gone tho
<@!189146272865845248> and you're also right, but we can still hope, right?
Do you think there will be a 6th season?
<:SMUG_ILLYA:526327678987534336>
Sure thing
(Legally)
<@216181207874928640> NAHNI
She repaired a whole gear in such a short time
Just what the fuck
Like she did with Senshoujin
So she can easily recover them
Carol is still there
Well
Altho we saw Hibiki's Gear breaking
Well they could have been hidden
We don't know if they are broke or not
And Kanade got kicked out of the song
Only Miku
Cause she probably burnt her personality too
No
I can't remember what it's called
She still activated it with the "chant"
Since their gear are Zababa
I kinda of expected coming from Kirika and Shirabe
Just wtf
That mech
Oh yeah
Unless you're doing it on VRV or something alike for  offline watching
<@!189146272865845248> it's not
With his stupid "protector" power
He should be able to freely escape from jail
I mean
I know
What the fuck happened to Fudou
Oh right
Livestream?
We only got to see two of them
The custodians
OH yeah
That song
LOL
Carol in first place, Chris in second place
Going back to fav song
YOU TRULY ARE A CUSTODIAN
LET US DREAM
I think they mean in concept
And none of them knew about Symphogear
Well honestly I have a bunch of IRL friends and net friends
I am fine with having the server in JP only
But that would actually save cost on having a whole "game" for one language
True
And let it change in game
Altho they could just implement the english translation
Probably never
We still have XDU
Symphogear isn't dead yet
I think I'll leave this chat for a while, otherwise I am going to cry again over this episode
Sure Carol/Elfnein could probably do the same
And only Sakurai Ryouko was able to create the converters
The converter got destroyed
It got destroyed in G
That wasn't the Senshoujin Gear
You mean a Faust Robe
It's unknown
Don't get me wrong
So we can still hope
Altho they left an open plot
It legit helped me get through a hard time
I can't believe the anime is over
Damn
She seemed like she had a converter
True
So it's a Faust Robe
No converter

It legit blacks itself on the screenshot
I can't take a screenshot of VRV
Okay wtf
Fudou says that he used Senshoujin Faust Robe
And I should remind you
But Faust Robe are a thing
True
If it was a Faust Robe then it wouldn't need a chant
If she has the converter or not
I am going to see one thing
Since it is the Symphogear sytem alongside the Pilosopher Stone
Amalgam can't be it
No
Lemme rewatch the fragment when Miku wears Senshoujin
I think there is a way
Actually
Wait
But then it's still unclear if it was a faust robe or a gear
True
Well she repaired multiple times gears
Through Alchemy
It's like 106 or something near that
If you look at the SG number on Kirika
I think she created way more than 7 Gears
Actually
bd?
So I can hear them
I want the songs
When are the CDs coming out
I WANT MORE SYMPHOGEAR
Don't tell me this series is more popular in Spanish rather than US
Oof
I think even the VA had fun while recording
But I still want more seasons
I think too this was a good ending
Due to not having the converter
But I am confident in saying that it's a Faust Robe
It's unknown honestly
But it isn't the gear
Senshoujin was used in XV
Well
She just says "We made it in time"
She doesn't say she repaired the SSJ
Also
But the process to create one from scratch is known only to Sakurai Ryouko
She can repair them through alchemy
Elfnein though doesn't know how to make Gears
*has tried to fight an entire world alone*
<@152896851660505088>
Miku and Elfnein says what she said
LMAO
What no
I have already watched but I want to have the "Watched" tag on every episode on CR
Why they are waiting so long to release the last AXZ ep on it
Now I'm conflicted
My account is bugged
*I watch everything on VRV*
They do
I was quite impressed in how the art style grow up during the series
And honestly
I have watched it again a few days ago
So you're saying that VRV uses the BD version
Unless CR uses the BD version
No
^
She does it when she fight Kirika later
Passive mode Fine?
But I don't remember Shirabe changing eyes in that scene
Well true
But why those lines
Well yeah
Thanks to her bff
When Bikki got her Gear destroyed
In G
IN G
EVERYONE IS IGNORING ONE THING. WHY SHIRABE TOLD TO GEN "You are always spoiling me" OR SOMETHING ALONG THOSE LINES AND GEN ANSWERED "That's who I am" OR SOMETING ALONG THOSE LINES.
LOVED IT

Only Faust Robe
No more Symphogears
That could be an interesting thing
*All gears will be turned into Faust Robe*
I think you mixed up some thoughts
Altho we are talking prior to it
Probably a Faust Robe
She can't recreate SSJ Gear
But
This is not what we are talking about
Completely annihilated
The Gear converter was destroyed by the reflected SSJ light
Which fragments?
Fine?
Who?
After all this is a discussion thread
And we are discussing
That meaning that they could have just woke up Miku in time and ready the helicopter in time
At least as an anime
<@480107127042736139> It probably won't go on
Book?
Didn't she said it at the very beginning of Symphogear?
About some birds singing 8008 times
The thing that Miku says at the end of XV
I just noticed something
*Carol: "She transformed into Deus Ex Machina"*
But Maria was ready to sacrifice just herself inside the treasure
Well they kinda followed up
Maria tho was ready to die
Rikka Ryouran and Angelic Remnant added
Thanks
Which I know it will take a while to come out, but I prefer it
I am honestly going to wait for the BD box
While each season is short, it doesn't have dead moments, and it's filled with story and emotion
And it has become the best anime I have ever watched
But after just a few episodes I started to really enjoy it
Due to the weird fighting style it has
I legit thought I was going to regret watching Symphogear at first
I binged all season on May
But still you don't have to wait
Also because CR took around 2 hours after airing to release the ep
Well yeah
And you surely will guess why that was hard during XV
Well at least you don't have to wait for the next ep
You should avoid opening this channel if you're watching XV now
*Never forget*

<@506219877724454929> *he's real tho*
He is truly meme
Dr. Ver
Hahahhaha
*Tsubasa character brakes*
Usually those anime with only 13 eps each season are bad
13 eps each season
I mean
And the serpent thing
Aka Kadingir
True
I watched all Gear but this question legit popped up in my mind now
And he holds it
They key is shown to be completely intact in G
You talking about Durandal or the key now?

Yes
Fine absorbed it
That key should've been destroyed
If we don't consider the plot armor
Then how tf the key for Babylonia remained intact
Meaning between Durandal and Nehushtan
While I do remember Fine saying "Complete annihilation between two relics"
I don't remember it being shattered
Where did Durandal go?
Now I'm wondering
Not the song but the animation
Damn the ED of S1 really used to be creepy
Since they didn't use it after S1
Yeah but like I legit forgot about that filter
I legit forgot that the Climax Song used to turn everything to purple
Damn I am watching that ep again
And like I thought, Mega Deth Party is the correct one
Iirc in the first season is spelled like that
<@!99695384296701952> Regarding this, I think the correct version is the 2nd one
No next season
Prob OVA or Shinai
Welcome to the club x3
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
*Must keep all relics in Japan*
Fudou wouldn't have been angry
He worked for FIS
*Insert angry Fudou*
Was still Section 2
Well that wasn't yet SONG
^
If she had enough phonic gain
I think so
Probably
Shem-ha: *takes control of Vanessa*
Vanessa: "Kill me, God Killer!"
Hibiki: 
Vanessa: "Kill me so you can stop Shem-ha"
Hibiki:
Vanessa: *reaches the controls*
Hibiki: *punches*
*So you can stop Shem-ha*
*Just kill me, God-Killer*
I liked more Tsubasa
But at least the animation was good
True
DESS
*Kiri-chan poledancer*
When they are together
Like just look at the Maria and Tsubasa fight right after the transformation
After rewatching completely Symphogear if you can clearly tell how the animations evolved during the series
Don't kill my feelings
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
That moment when my phone plays Rikka Ryouran and All Loves Blazing in random playing consecutively
It was fun tho
Just wtf was that
*True*
PFFT
So not in full quality
*When we will have the wedding scene*
<@!237964037898502144>
