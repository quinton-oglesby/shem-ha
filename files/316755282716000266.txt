pun intended lol
hm ok I guess that makes sense. thanks for the perspective
<@!102691114762371072> I think the lines converge too quick
oh i've seen those floating around they look really nice
my perspective is so bad
perspeactive
got inspired after explaining the power of the box to someone.
A wip. Gonna be doing the symphogear girls once i finish the Macross ones.
crossover drawing with Sheryl from Macross
something I'm working on

some mech concepts for a class
This won me a fan animation contest. 
https://youtu.be/zASGcJrGK2w
if I was there, I'd have fucking lost it
i went to AX the day after the panel
<:TsubasaSmug:585839805737467920> ROBOTECH
I mean
whoops
anyone here into macross?
franxx lifted it's whole dinosaur backstory from getter robo
I like already
cute girls in mechs
lol hi super robot wars
i wouldn't say ibo really conformed tbh. it still was it's own thing
says alot about the kinda mecha I like lol
aye man G is one of my top 5
they'd like their title back
>G gundam called
>most anime gundam has ever been
like that hasn't happened before in gundam
i didn't like ibo. the lead mech designer peaked in g-reco
I prefer Macross
Gundam is kinda getting on my nervs
A PERSON OF GOOD TASTE
YEET
I prefer mecha
I only make exceptions once in a while for fantasy,
lol asterisk war is nowhere near fantasy
but none of the writing power of gainax
Like trigger's got some good talent behind the animation
even more so now that they are doing 2d Zootopia
I've kinda lost the hype for trigger in general
i'd rather just watch regular idomlaster
oof i threw up in my mouth
remember idolmaster xenoglossia? LOL
yeah
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
they have lovelive
sunrise does more than gundam lol
sunrise is literally the only one of 2 studios left that can do scifi in 2d
idk we aren't gonna get a good gundam for a while. Sunrise got hired to do Akira
^^^
i hope gainax does not touch gunbuster anymore
but I liked gunbuster 2 <:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
LOL
lolol
Game of thrones: I'll kill everyone
Ideon: Hold my beer
LOL
PERSON OF CULTURE
YES
<:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
<@238855496797257729> pls tell me you've seen gunbuster
but no lie tho Thunderbolt's animation is top tier
rest in rip
specifically thunderbolt
alot of the my hero animators worked on Gundam
thunderbolt is god tier animation
ibo was more of a mob story so it might be a breath of fresh air
unless you're G Gundam you pretty much are thrown into the univers' politics
Gundam is ALL politics
LOL
at least the gundam timeline isn't a mess like most other franchise with a timeline lol
i haven't built in a long time tho
troo
the necks always freaked me out on the koto girl kits
i mean I have to now since they are doing brave series model kits
koto got alot better with their megami device from what I hear, but im not really into koto anymore
i had a few fags
aye man I appreciate model kits too lol
is user creations were we would talk about kits? lol
i mean I reacted lol
I have the 1/100 akatsuki as well ðŸ˜› it's super shiney on my shelf
you mean akatsuki lol
oh
A REAL PERSON OF CULTURE
BOY
GOLDEN
i love me some pink mechs
i have a PG Strike Rouge  ðŸ˜›
seed wasn't bad seed destiny was terrible
its weird seeing seed's character designer in modern day lol
fafner lol
like Mecha designs are getting too complicated to 2D animate
very classic super robot. i liked it lol
fight league's mecha sakuga aws p nice
i looked, I wanted to apply for their cram school lol
*hire
they are slowly switching but atm they only hure 2D
yeah
gundam's got some really good sakuga
let alone mecha
you hardly find studios nowadays that would even animate ships in 2d
scifi as in scifi settings
like if it looks like blade runner and or has mecha
yeah
oh my b then
lolol
1 studio and sunrise's 16
Ok fine
since it was animated by trigger before they became trigger
i need more pac rim in my life
I can't wait for the pacific rim netflix anime
one day haha
im currently not in their area but I'll ask for pics haha
lolol
hell yeah
just cuz like one of my buddies ends up buying 2
I've held and seen almost all the metal builds
yeah
dude these guys collect Metal Build and SoC i can't for the life of me remember what they do for work but they rolling enough to afford new ones when they release
I've seen SOC Beast King Go-lion in person
alot of my budies collect SoC
that thing is so nice I've seen it in person
i love gao gai gar tho
it's like candycoat
like the akatsuki model kit
it was either genesig or gaofighgar
duude my friend has a almost every plated version of Genesic Gao Gai Gar
yeh
<:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
have you seen brave series <@238855496797257729> ?
the one im thinking of is nobunaga the fool
nah nah
i didn't end up watching it tho
lol i remember that one year we had that nobunaga mech show
I can't do HW and pay attention to a video
also I wish I could multi task
ah ok lol yeah talking here about that stuff sounds about right
it is more likely to be bandai
lol
can you imagine how much koto could make off of Symphogear shit rn
lol
well excluding Brave series kits
then Koto can have my money again lol
I want koto to pick up the rights to do Symphogear kits
Poor manâ€™a figure collecting is now pops lol
Yeahabout that much

same orz
i was hoping to find some symphogear shit at AX ,but i couldn't find any
<:CarolShock:430939013235474432>
lol good god i hope not
lol
he goes cuz his wife is into that shit
in California there's a Yaoi con that happens yearly
nah man male figures generally sell
like my friend is still trying to sell a Levi Figure and it's been 3 years since he's sold a single one
cuz the flavour of the month changes so fast
i feel like it's hard for stores to keep up with anime
man some figures be trifling
phat as in huge honkers lol
and there's a store of just phat anime tiddies
I'm in LA so all I have to do is go to japan town
I have alot actually... lol california has alot of hobby shops
it was a key frame
one of my friends who runs a gunpla shop in norcal has alot of gundam cells. one of which is a shining gundam
except in build fighters where it shows up for like 5 seconds
lol yeah... see they retconed the hell out of g-saviour haha
when I have time i mean hahah
I want to animate the final fight of this in 2D one of these days just for shits and giggles
lol
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHFFvrmCMn4&t=4654s
idk man last live action they did... they didn't bother at all
lol
bandai/sunrise have a heavy hand in it this time
it might just be ok lol
