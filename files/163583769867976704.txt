I forgot how much I missed this series lmao
Sup

I've never seen it be anything other than chocolate, strawberry, and vanilla but TIL. I'm from the US btw so ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
and most people won't know about tri-color dangos lol
I'm happy with commie's choice to call them the Neapolitan team. It works really well imo
That is a lot of ice cream 😮 and the last one is the literal translation of them being the dango team =p
<@!263983345669505025> team neapolitan
well hopefully it works out for you guys. things could be better but they could be worse as well
🤔
you do know that telling a discussion to move just kills it because nobody ever bothers to move
🏃‍♂️
<@!263983345669505025> believe in the me that believes in someone that looks like you but isn't you.
If discord's admins aren't willing to deal with harassment that is discord's fault. You can disable PMs ect but there really isn't much a server staff person can do. Server staff can't even view your PMs ect  as really they are just self appointed moderators with no actual authority outside of this channel/server.
I'm still new to this discord server but once it goes to the realm of PMs that would be the actual discord admin's realm and not the staff here. imo at least.
If you are talking about people pming you at least.
<@!127644949884698624> can't this shit be reported to the discord admins?
