okay. I mean this was just a suggestion but it's up to you guys if you wanna add a new channel
I can find a lot of stuff but for recent events I'm not sure who will put up a translation or when
It would just be easier to have one place to look instead of scrolling thru everything since I'm not on discord as much anymore
Event and story translations
Thank you! It's just really hard to find translated content
Can we have an xdu translations channel for any event translations or summaries people have? Translations get buried really easily in the xdu discussion channel rn
