Hello everyone, this is Maya from Gremlin‚Ä†Royale. We've started TLing doujins recently and I'm proud to present our first release Lil' Chris and her Merry Friends Z. We'll have it up on Mangadex and Dynasty soon, but it's already up on a vaguely cat sounding site and this handy link here. Enjoy, there's more to come soon.

<https://mega.nz/folder/fttlnagQ#G1T6FXK1ONa8VhLg94c1Wg>

We'll also be keeping you all updated through this twitter here. So feel free to follow if you're interested in our progress.

It'd be nice if I could pull with that... <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>

Welp it's working again now
Is it? So far as I'm seeing, the server's still got 30 boosts
I apologise if there's something specific over this, but can I ask what happened to :mikushrug:?
Please help me, I've binge watched the entire show up to AXZ in two days
How come I taste fanta?
Because new person hasn't watched G yet
That's better

Sorry about the lack of source, I found it on another server unsourced and was kinda hoping Shirabe would have it.

Whatever shampoo that Kanade uses most likely.
Then they'll come back alive, even if it kills them.

Hmm, it's disorienting but Kanade's hair on Chris kinda fits.
I'm more concerned what Noise!Bikki is gonna do.
Bikki's missing a shoe because someone took Miku's.
https://twitter.com/jyudo_fu/status/1167470148728410113
Interesting, two of them got removed from pixiv
<:smugchris:601642579330596864>
*And I am one of them*
Chris and Tsubasa surprises me
Technically it is? It's ||an amalgam design|| for Kanade.
That's what I threw em through before Shirabe
I'm just unlucky aren't I?
Attempt 2, Shirabe help Boogaloo
Help me Shirabe you're my only hope

Much appreciated
Good Luck
Your best stuff
The Tsubasa art
Hit me up Kerrik
This is an actual thing?
What
"How do we make this more ridiculous?"
"More Dakka."
Less a grenade launcher and more an automatic rocket artillery piece that's used as a rifle.
Oh
Looks more like a plasma gun if I'm honest Voy
Thanks Shirabe
Shirabe you're my only hope
We do, but I can't find it for the life of me
*Why don't I have any money to play DaemonXMachina?*
We should probably move to <#371105434771390465>
I'll give it a go, studio has a good track record after all
Looking at it now, I don't think that's gonna look all that good in motion
Hmm
"(studio that did Re:Creators)" Say no more. I'll give it a watch
I have no idea what that's from. Cool as fuck mech design though.
I'd spend *hours* tuning
Moved Sorry about that
Come ooon, please have this one

This one?
Hmm, how about this one
Help me Shirabe, you're my only hope
No like, I've not seen a bit of it until around episode 8 of XV. Though that's probably just me not looking for it.
I have no idea where all this Chris/Maria art came from.
This is beyond cursed
I feel like I need to go get that report of half the navy sinking itself.

Bold of you to assume I'm not doing that right now
Okay, that's a *good* one
I will
And your many Chris
I did take your Tsubasas
More to add to the collection
That explains the Maria obsession
Y'all want to let the poor bot rest?
Shirabe needs a bit to recover it seems
If only
~~Satelight are fucking *cowards* for not giving more abs.~~
Agreed
It's in a weird state of semi-working most of the time
üëç Absolutely
Wait are you making a document for who to give certain art to?
Oh. Well I stand corrected
Okay, I can't be the only one who thought that was an orange.
Also, really late on the draw, but I wouldn't mind that tsubamari group either.
As well as Spirit of Justice *but we don't talk about Spirit of Justice*

The straight Hibiki art is just flat cursed honestly.

Unless it's Linker. In which case just don't overdose on it.

I mean. You can Fine her.
Enjoy it while it lasts
But that day is not today.

It's entirely because they thought it'd be cool to do a bunch of themed art
Thank you so much!
<@!106866895076003840> Do you by any chance still have that?
Can I ask if anyone has Lily's edit of the XV logo? It was my desktop background and I've had to change HDDs so I've lost it.

I'm very concerned now.
I kinda doubt it at this point. They'd have to license the songs too wouldn't they?

Likewise
I don't really know. I guess I'd just like the little nod to where it all started I guess? Even if it isn't for a full fight or something.
Here's a question, what happens if Symphogear does the action anime thing of having the first OP as the final fight music? I don't know if I'd prefer that over a Auswafen form of Metanoia, but it's something to consider.
On one hand, the slice of life stuff, on the other it could feel like padding.
It fits well enough I'm surprised she didn't have one prior to now
Oh wait no we're good, had to skip the free trial annoyingly though
Welp, delaying doing Crunchyroll stuff bit me, it's not letting me actually get premium

||I'm still holding out hope for Synchrogazer happening at somepoint. Just to tie everything together.||
Ahh dammit now I've got a week to wait for the next episode
Unfortunately no, unless you do what Horriblesubs do but I don't know what that is.
||Wind of Axia is fucking great if that's it's name.||
||Holy *fuck* that transformation sequence was incredible.||
Small miracles
Will report back!
Does anyone have anything like Rabbit that works? I'd gladly stream it for you all and save you the hour's wait
I'm not the only one sitting on the Crunchyroll page with an alarm set am I?


The CR subs seem pretty good
||I gotta say, I loved the little callback to the S1 transformations in this.||
Hot damn that's fast
The Season 1 callbacks are *fucking* great
I'm on board with that Nara
Yep
Oh absolutely

All of them are there
I saw a thing on twitter that compared all the transformation references
I can't wait to see all the others considering how *damn good* Bikki's is.
I'm kidding of course.
Quickly! Save the typos for historical presentation!
I *really* need to do that edit. If only for the *many* jokes we can make with what's on Hibiki's mind.
A less hammy <:Ver:336656981144109066> isn't <:Ver:336656981144109066> at all.
I won't deny that I'm curious how everything would've turned out if it stayed more a character drama like season one.
No just no
Oh fucking hell I just remembered that
I can't help but feel like we all may have jinxed ourselves by saying everything will turn out okay in the end.
*Increasingly concerned*
*Concerned*
I'm just imagining actual budget behind it.
I've been following both.
Now I'm curious if it'd work better as a 2d fighter or more like a Devil May Cry game.
We're not *quite* on that level of utterly insane yet
I'm doing my best to avoid the songs until the season's over, even if I've been *really* wanting to listen to the full version of All Love's Blazing.
This is my first time not just binging the series, this is painful and I love it.
I'm refusing to listen to it in sheer fear.
Honestly, I think if anyone dies to motivate the gears it may end up being Gen.
That's not been a thing since GX tbf.
Not at all
I should do another rewatch
Fucking hell, that's one way to make us take the noise seriously again
They really just did that didn't they?
Oh god, that'd be even more horrifying
*Nah* it'll just be ***sunshine***
What is wrong with you lot sometimes?
So erm, I *really* hope we don't get a redemption for the villains this season.
~~If it ends with all the gears destroyed like I expect it will... A movie's out of the question.~~
Depending on how this season ends
Gjallarhorn movie could be good actually
Huh, neat
I just read all those Doujins. *I need more.*
That's the plan
She deserves at least a thousand ~~tears~~ swords in her.
I'm thinking that doing a redemption arc after someone kills a child on screen and kills a good portion of 100,000 people would be awful.
I just want to say. Millaric dies for this.
Kinda
I jumped in about... a month or two ago?
Symphogear Twitter was just screaming for a solid 5 hours.
I'm glad I jumped onboard before XV started airing, sharing the hype is pretty damn brilliant with other people.

I'll try find the screenshot
It topped Japanese Twitter for nearly a day and was in the Worldwide at around 7th I think
Nope, worldwide
That's kinda insane.
Can I just point out that it was trending worldwide for a bit on Twitter?
Honest question, what should be the final song?
They really do
She's looking just ... Fin√©
~~Ignore the Tuna typo~~
I still need to watch Yuki Yuna, is it worth the watch?
Wait
<:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
Still. I'm concerned
~~Tell the rookies that one.~~

I think I just realised how Miku will die.
Millarc can control minds.
https://twitter.com/pinch_nes/status/1150510870444642304
Ain't that a thought
Bikki would've witched out on the rooftop of Lydian.
There's a lot more wine in Symphogear now.
Oh, the event that shall not be named. I know that one well.
I'm so confused at XDU's writing but also so intrigued
Actually, that's a good point, what even are the noise noises?
*Noise Noises*
Is that good sales?
Gave Episode 2 a rewatch. I think this is the first time I'll say that Shirabe's A-side is better than Kirika's.
<:TsubasaDisgust:349013662775902209>
The End of Symphogear
If you studied it you should know that manifestation of depressive behaviour is inherently different based on environment and personality. Also people act irrationally.
Yametetomete or Commie, but Yamete  is much better quality I've found.
Why is that a thing?
"In your time you didn't have to fight a *fucking god*."
Holy fuck, that's insane.
Red Hot Blaze has finally fired, this really is the End of Symphogear soon isn't it?
"Miraculous Operation"?
Cast, that's looking fantastic!
Hibiki > Shirabe > Chris > Kirika
Hopefully it's befriending phase 2 rather than 1
Not a very winnable fight
Though without Hibiki it would most likely be a slightly more experienced Tsubasa alone against Fine and likely Chris.
Looking good!
I was asking Cast, don't worry
Could I get your CAD/fusion files if that's okay? I'm trying to see if it's printable and there's a few places I need to look at.
Hey <@!231025503643893770> do you have the source files for that or did you design it as a mesh?
Just the gun for the moment
It's getting printed in about 6 pieces, which means I'll need to get some super glue or something to hold some of it in place.
Just printing the first layer now
Gonna need to put a screw there, but I'm basically done

About 26 hours ago
I appreciate it, thank you. I'll try share the completed build after it's done
Thank you!
I've been deleting the B-sides in case they're gonna be in the show.
The full A-Track is fantastic
I would've agreed with you but then we got Chris' A-track.
CR subs, never quite get it do they?
We don't have the next panel in which it spontaneously explodes.

<:notlikesword:599467713714192384>
He punched out Fine, a gun isn't gonna make him flinch
The weakest links for the geahs is also their strength.
You can't download other people's pfps. Not so far as I'm aware
^^^
I mean, consider my pfp Nougat
Though it begs the question of "Why the fuck do you need it?"

So interesting thing, the Chateau is actively getting rebuilt.
It's a good song.
Oh no.
I still think it's a common conspiracy theory on the symphonet that Basa's one of the geahs. No proof... aside from maybe last episode. But it's always her concerts that get disrupted by attacks.
Hibimiku Battle Duet, give me two.
I still need to try Nanoha at some point.
Some say not even King Records knows what goes on at King Records
When isn't it?
GSC?
That was the pendant
Okay, I've actually managed to get *one* thing that didn't need international shipping
I'd settle for *anything* that's not gonna need shipping from Japan.
... Maybe when I've got more money and a reason to treat myself.
~~Screams in Brit.~~
Thanks!
I'd *like* to buy em, I just don't know where I can
Or well, any Nendoroid
Honestly, I'd pay a terrifying amount of money for a Miku Nendoroid
Same
Give me canon Miku X-Drive
One of them fighting each other and one of them fighting together.
It's on Nyaa, give me a bit to download and I'll send you a copy
I don't think Maria or Miku will appreciate Tsubasa crashing Hibiki into something
~~So if someone could get Basa's songs a week early that'd be great.~~
Maria's XV songs are on the cat site
Okay, gotta say this is one of the first Maria songs I'm really liking
Befriending through superior firepower is how Nanoha's been described to me.
Thanks
Do you have a link Rany? I've been trying to find the translation
"Short" depends on your definition
Thought they'd delayed it for like a week there
So an hour later.
Forget Amalgram, that's the main power boost there.
Anyone hear some... Genocide?
Suits, a car, an important briefcase. Thank god Fin√© isn't around anymore.
Maimed, possibly in a coma. If they actually *kill off* Miku like that I'll be shocked.
None given
I thought she'd Amalgam'd for a moment there
Ogawa op, please nerf in next patch
GodTsubasa is a ship that's sailed I think, but that doesn't stop her Manchurian candidating the rest of the Geahs at a crucial moment.
One is an unarmed combatant, the other uses a sword.
Yep
"It all returns to Bikki..."
It's instrumentality only everyone is Hibiki
"God time."
Holy fuck YT that was quick.
It's not exactly a leap
This is the man who ran on water
Painful, but a Tsubasa vs Chris/Maria fight is one I'm expecting
It's more purple
<:Flamer:479775405709197316>
Exactly
Or even worse, one happens and there's no English translation.
Beyond the Blade and Sora E
On the contrary, Radiant Force and Bayonet Charge Dino.

I FUCKING LOVE THIS
... It's Symphogear. The entire show is built on Rule of Cool.
"Erm, QUICK HIDE THE X-DRIVE."
Someone teach Chris how to Knifegun
https://www.kapwing.com/videos/5d5839a8452e74001428f723 <@209896097026408449> I'm so sorry.
God I hope he doesn't.
No it's dess.
Dess
Someone gotta job and it looks like Bikki got the short straw.
I've mp3'd the ending if you want it, it's still got all the other sounds but I'm still looping it until next week.
Can we shift it to a "Madoka Manga ending possible"?
No, robotic arm Hibiki.
Also Crunchyroll spoiling Symphogear? I never thought I'd see the day.
Solo, I'm seriously considering writing that story.
Why do this to us Xan
Akira ran out on his family, throwing a pendant to his daughter nearly two years later isn't enough to justify that.
Please, that a HibiMiku duet and a Kanade/Tsubasa Duet and I can safely call this my favorite season.
I love how this channel is half filled with discussion and the other half filled with screaming + genocide
This is Symphogear, since when has "sense" stopped it?
This is relevant again.
I keep getting a terrifying feeling that if anyone dies in the main group it's going to be Tsubasa.
We all joked about Elfnein album, now it looks like it's actually happening.
I mean, we're getting an Elfnein/Carol one. They've even got an A and B side.
Lies and slander, it's clearly <:PharaDancing:278546062849867776>
Also it won't happen but another Tsubasa/Chris Duet would be nice.
Tsubasa/Kanade Amalgam
To the moon and back
You're probably better off noting down what isn't shared between them.
The capitalisation is important
<a:ablobpanic:506956736113147909>
ANYTHING BUT THAT
NO
Oh no
I think so Melua.
There's a full radio version? I thought only the cut one was out there?
Has anyone got the translation for lasting song yet?
I'll be honest, I wasn't expecting to love If the World Had a Song as much as I do.
Not sure if it's my favourite ED, but it's probably at least second.
<:ShirabeConcern:586404485598019604>
But also one I don't think really works
I mean, that'd be one *hell* of a twist
Gen, one of Chris or Tsubasa may get a fake out death for an episode.
Yep
Akira can go fuck himself though.
I won't say otherwise there, but it's not absolutely awful like many say it is.
~~If we ignore Hibiki that is.~~
GX had some bad arcs but it's not completely irredeemable.
Melua, that is a *really* good idea
Honestly? If you're predicting final episode names? "Create a history, with the light God could not know"
*Especially* considering they're dropping the "XV" episode title now.
It can still go anyway.
I didn't know that
Mouse over the Chateau image
They actually did the damn thing
https://www.symphogear-xv.com/next/XVnext08.php Previews out
This isn't allaying my fears at all dammit
I'm glad I got on this train before it came to a stop
Last episode of Season 1 was also "Symphogear"
It just kinda fits way too well for it.
Last episode is *probably* going to be the season's tagline
Correction, two of them are
There's a none zero chance that we get spin offs and such
You mean the most terrifying day
*WHAT THE HOLY FUCK*
The bounce was out of place, especially for a serious scene like that.
It was Carol being X-Drive in a can.
I mean, they didn't actually activate the Chateau did they?
How in the living fuck is this going to get wrapped up in just that?
So
I mean, does it count if I wanted a Maria + Chris vs Tsubasa fight?
No that was Shirabe
Miku Kohinata has evolved into Shem Ha
There are a few American destroyers who disagree with that
You meltdown every four hours
Solo's melting down. I never thought I'd see the day.
Solo, why did you Ghostwrite some parts of XV?
It did
...
Or Maria/Chris
Honestly? I can see that being a cliffhanger for an episode. Hibiki getting backstabbed.
A Nana song releasing globally and digital? Who used the Genie lamp?
What, the genocide counter?
Well, it's unlikely this is the last Symphogear thing but if it is we're going out with one *hell* of a bang.
Also, new Miku Album when?
"It can still be stopped, but just barely. There's a small hope that she can be rescued.
 
Even so..."

Mother fucker
I mean, it's basically a rebuild of Shenshoujing
https://streamable.com/4dcal <@!279341087494242304> For our none plebs
Final Battle on the Moon anyone?
But yeah
That reminds me, people who've been here since G. Is this how you all felt when Mikugeah happened then?
It's supposed to be a grand finale, so I guess they're pulling out every stop they can think of.
I mean, they're not *completely* wrong.
I could watch this loop for hours
https://imgur.com/snqpezd
I still think it'll be Chris getting backstabbed with Maria having to fight Tsubasa immediately after.
And open the world back up to Noise attacks
Shem-Ha would probably laugh at a nuke.
That and they'd still need Hibiki to even try pull it off
They didn't actually get to do it
Even though Shem-Ha looks like it's in some kind of X-Drive already
It's less that it's strong enough, more that the philosophical aspect of it lets her fight on evenish terms.
Or you know, the philosophical god killer.
Rewatching it now
They just kinda locked it up didn't they?
Isn't the Nephilim still technically alive inside the Labyrinth?
Welp, time to rewatch with YTT.
The "betrayal"
I just get reminded of this every time someone says Chris in melee range
https://tenor.com/view/symphogear-anime-gif-5661841
Yes. Yes it did Voy.
Since when has Symphogear cared about practicality?
Honestly, despite my revolver tricks weakness I have to agree there. Chris' henshin got overshadowed by pretty much everyone else's.
Still better safe than sorry
I, have no idea I'm just stupid
The art keeps flowing in
||https://twitter.com/zakuro_t/status/1165632596488810496||
I'd also need more references before actually doing even any planning for a Shem-Ha Cosplay.
I've been working on something else entirely Kerrik, but I'm *severely* tempted.
As in seriously, I'd wear a dress like that it I had the option.
It's also a *fantastic* dress
I've got to say that Shem-Ha has this eerie feeling to the design, the dress before transforming looks damn near regal.
I'm up for a good old fashioned riot
Absolutely none of us are, the only way they could've made it worse is if they used the piano version of shenshoujing for the ED.
Oh not the bloody teleportation paradox
I kinda agree, Amalgam would've been interesting if it'd actually been used earlier in offensive mode. Because at this rate if they want to introduce it they've got 5 episodes of which two are likely the finale.
Wait, Tsubasa's B-Side is out?
It might have been a keyword
Shenshoujing pieces were used to stabilise the bracelet WFC.
It kinda cheapens X-Drive when it's given to them all in a can and then proceeds to do exactly nothing.
It didn't fit the scene at all
I *really* hope it doesn't have the relic killing power. It will, but it's going to feel like a cop out.
I'd still prefer a proper Chris vs Tsubasa fight honestly.
We did establish that X-Drive heals in season 1
"Simply Divine"
So far it's S1 = XV > G >AXZ  > GX
Either Hibiki or Tsubasa are my favourites honestly. Leaning more on Tsubasa's henshin.
Beyond the Blade Ignite is a guilty pleasure.
I didn't actually know that, most people I've talked to seem to think that the ignite versions are on par.
That's one of em
There's about 2 to 3 exceptions.
Controversial opinion, most of the ignite remixes outright ruin the songs.
Come on From Soft, make a new AC already
KAWAMORI DID WHITE GLINT?!
*You're serious*
What
Agreed
Nah
Miku beating it from within
Problem solved series over
Welp
I'll grab YTT's release and compare one sec
Basically, don't give us another Testament.
The plan might be to get Tsubasa hit by it and then somehow get the divine power in her. But it's a fucking ridiculous gambit that stretches the limits of planning for everything.
It's harder than it looks
Time for some heartbreak. Have fun.
~~I kinda have the entire soundtracks + scores.~~
Synchrogazer wants a word
The long intro versions of Synchrogazer, Vitalisation etc
Axia's second half lets it down so hard
Okay, I've got to say anytime they use the Zesshou motif is brilliant
Yep it is
Is that from Season 1?
You may have me beat there
Lovely, can't wait for it.
Fair point
That implies that any of them have their shit together.
https://twitter.com/symphogear_XD/status/1167346215899598848?s=19
Ayahi why
I have that gif on standby because of how good it looks
https://imgur.com/snqpezd
That's *so much better* than the raw version I was using before now. Thank you.
Makes me wonder how much was unfinished honesty
Imagine all that with the only remaining things being Hibiki's memories and the photo from S1.
Solo once again proving his suffering chops in writing.
Are you fucking serious
What.
Armados. You have zero fucking clue what you're talking about.
And Ver can fuck off forever
Same honestly. I've got my own issues with both characters but Akira has a slight chance of being tolerable.
I haven't seen that since I was a kid.
"Ah ha! We finally have the face of one of the Symphogears!"
"Who the fuck is this?"
<:MariaAgent:278546060849184769>
Maria has the UN agent cover story
They're also Teenagers.
Also that too
*Looks at Hibiki*
G/GX would've crashed it or otherwise got some serious questions of why any time Noise attack a concert it's always hers.
üëç
Already ripped it, might have the wrong name though.
Perish the thought
So you're telling me that a writer... *could lie* about the ending of their story?
Episode 14
It was a short betrayal. But I think it was still paced well?
My only requirement, is that git stays in the :: thing
Take that one if you want it
<a:FudouIsAGit:617321926486130688>
Because I think they're the only ones to sync with the gears or somethinfg
That's one hell of a gambit if so.
All of this is just Happy Singing Hood fanfiction wrote by Chris.
We still have more space on the chart to add more suffering yet
Carol was the one antagonist who's plan held somewhat together.
Plans only survive until the first contact with the enemy.
It's wildly out of place considering the rest of the series.
Vanessa I think
Pretty much spoilers for next episode here. ||https://twitter.com/aimi_sound/status/1167686314566664192||
At the very least, gotta admit their committed to the joke.
I mean, we get another week of fan artists creating a personality.
Translation "Don't think about it, we wrote ourselves into a corner."
A significant power up with an absolute downside that isn't just brought up as the plot demands.
Only heard Shirabe's one so far.
I'm somehow still resisting the urge to listen to the B-Sides.
At least for the A-Sides.
Defender is competing with All Loaded for my favourite song this season
Phara would be proud
I don't think they've been translated yet unfortunately
And matching rubber ducks
Still, it'd hit *damn* hard even if it was a fake out. Especially if they left that as the cliffhanger for an episode.
Hearing this in XV would fucking kill me.
Uploaded Feburary of last year. Not been KR'd yet
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoBGiV3Gz6U&list=PL_-pqBbmYl08n5_dfFVwLleE38mXzAz6h
Like how the Season 1 ost has been on there for years
I'm assuming they aren't quick enough
That physically hurts to read.
Out of everything that has confused me most
Along with their duet most likely
Solo no, don't you dare
Likewise. It's Episode 10 something is about to happen.
If either of them wear a suit it'd be Hibiki
Oh god not that again
We all do
Am I allowed to hope we get a relative breather episode before the storm that the last three episodes usually are?
Good luck everyone
Should probably mute here soon so I don't get spoiled by raws
Are we ever?
It would, last episode left Tsubasa near catatonic. If they do the normal light hearted scene it'd feel way out of place.
Glad to see I wasn't the only one who noticed that
Oh god no
Twin Heart is a better name for it honestly.
Jog my memory, what was it before that?
That too
Spotify has the GX character Songs and that's it.
Also just want to say that I appreciate more use of the dress.
Agreed, that dress is fantastic
It's like trying to set a fire underwater.
Here's where we get surprised, every B-side but Kimi Dake Ni.
If you define jobbing as holding out semi-well against a literal god then sure.
Obviously
Turns out we were watching Eva the musical the whole time
Hell I hope we do. Movie budget on some of the season 1 fights would be great.
I wouldn't be surprised if we at least got a Season 1 recap movie
They *really* want us to think Miku is dead don't they?
Nah, end the show on that instrumental of First Love Song from Episode 1 that it started on.
I mean, yuri's getting finalised more and more these days. We can at least hope for it.
Her song *literally has her confessing.*
The gif's the only version of it left
The video got took down
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
Did you expect Tsubasa to be anything *but* a domestic disaster?
We're at a point that NR just doesn't have the time to get a song. Considering that *generally* two major things happen per episode and NR defecting would be one of them.
Yes obviously
I've said it before and I'll say it again, the dress is fucking fantastic.
<:OgawaClipboard:611355536994336772>
All I want is to not get Gainax ending'd.
... Mate, they sleep in the same bed
https://imgur.com/snqpezd
What, the many flicks?
~~Also give us something to rival SYMPHOOOOOGEAAAAAAAAAR~~
Please dear god, don't give us a Gainiax ending
The instrumental of first love song
Or the instrumental that season 1 opened on
I'll second the no ver pls
The best way to put it is that Symphogear is a show full of girls who would be considered the best girl in their own shows.
<:MikuLewd:266873172442218496>
To <#337805317276565525> with you all
If they can top the ending of G episode 12 I'll be happy with this.
Too late
https://4kids-entertainment-fanon.fandom.com/wiki/Warriors_of_Symphogear
Solo, do I have to get the 4kids thing that someone made for Symphogear?
Three months in my case
It's been a hell of a ride.
Hard to think that in less than two weeks Symphogear will be over.
Hopefully tomorrow tops G episode 12
The fucking XDU event was to remind us that Ogawa had brothers before this episode.
Please tell me that isn't a mistranslation

Didn't see it properly, but Hibiki's hair looks to have gone a mix of Kanade and Saint Germain
Voy continues to be thirsty as hell for the Ogawas
Symphogear universe conspiracy theories must be fun
Here we go again...
You caused this voy, your endless thirst has caused this
I know the pains of the Orca. What the fuck was the waffle?
<:notlikesword:599467713714192384>
... Would you believe me if I said that was unintentional
You've pulled it out in the open. There's no putting the sword back in the sheathe this way.
That's just painful sounding
Maybe I'm just biased, but Tsubasa's is pretty good
So honest question, from what we've seen, which Amal-Drive looks best?
The baby chick's all grown up
Exactly Solo
At this point Shemmy's kinda pushed Hibiki to a point that she's never really went to.
Hibiki.
It's best left forgotten
We're not
Ah. Yeah. I'm not looking that up then
Ame No Hababikki becomes canon for a brief moment
That would just kinda be cool though
I'd probably still watch new stuff but the main six have run their course mostly
I'm kinda inclined to agree
So Ryuko without the harassment?
Alchemy's just like cooking isn't it? Just with more explosions if things go wrong.
<:TsubasaSmug:585839805737467920>
The adjustment thing from episode 1 of XV.
Ignite, Relic Repair, moral support
You're aware that all the other albums with the ED on had other songs too right?
It feels like stuff is being deliberately left in the air, be that for XDU or possible spin offs or whatever.
~~I kid, I actually like Maria.~~
Maria, not only jobbing but now actively fucking over the entire human race.
It's a coma dream after getting knocked out at the Zwei Wing concert
I'd love a full season of the Shinais
Because burn out. Most characters have already had their arcs finished
SSJ and Gungnir maybe. But not all of them.
The more I think about it the less I think the gears are getting destroyed
Times like this that make me wish I'd picked up my JP a few years back rather than recently.
I've still not looked at Kimi Dake Ni or listened to it so I can't comment there. But Miku's been the one literally singing that she loves Hibiki. Not the other way around.
I'm edgy? That's a new one to me.
Oh for fucks-
Calm down with your thirst Voy
<:he:622604330008051739>
Before now they were mentioned in one keyword *back in G*
The entire point of that event in XDU was to remind people that Ogawa has brothers
I mean, I suppose that *kinda* ties into the "Song from your heart" thing that XV's been doing, but it's one hell of a stretch.
<:mariastare:622249273123405825>
<:norespect:600930510633435136>
I take one more look in here and Voy is still thirsting three days on the run.
<:mariastare:622249273123405825>
Inb4 we get Autoscorer unisons before Carol
Oh god the Robotech treatment
I say GX cause FIS
If Symphogear followed on it's death flags everyone would be dead by GX.
Same Voy.
That's all I ask.
Please don't Gainax ending us
This is us all right now
Basically, because they lack the phonic gain needed to make X-Drive happen naturally they're basically burning the gears to pull it off.
I'm 50/50 on the gears getting destroyed. The keyword for Burning X-Drive is making it a lot more likely though.
Temporary break to tell you all that Visqi is working overtime on this art.
Considering how hard they're going on "this is the *last* episode." I doubt an open ending is something we're getting here.
We'll have time to mourn when it's over. Now's a happy time.
Honestly? At this point I'd kinda prefer a short Shem-Ha fight if it meant most of the episode went to an epilogue of some sort.

I've never actually got into an anime like this before now. As in actually watching week by week. It's been a hell of a ride everyone, one that I won't easily forget.
<:symphofear:622087086320910342> Don't fuck up the landing Symphogear
<:KirikaSalute:620069889838809089>
We all will Voy. We all will.
They were really pushed for time on this one the animators
As much as I fucking loved the episode. There's a buuuunch of animation errors.
Not gonna lie, I'm hoping for a later live.
<@309482589121413121> Welcome to the rare pair corner. We have guns and swords.
Unless you mean post-season keywords
We got them with the previews Solo
Ogawa gets knock off Ame No Habakiri
Yep
I'm like 90% sure it's off handedly mentioned that Hibiki died at Zwei Wing in that timeline.
Hibimiku
From what I heard Japan fucking loved the finale.

I've got a .flac if you can use that?
One sec
We do?
~~That's what the savings are for.~~
I'm not counting on it though.
We can hope at least.
Yeah, that's what I was referring to. Sorry for the confusion
The date? No. That it'll happen? Yep.
But I didn't watch s1 on CR so
I think they have the BDs for G
Yes
I think the first and only time I watched S1 it was the tv version.
Top dad, screwing us all over at the last moment.
Yes. But this is an *entirely new cast*
Unless you got for unknowns which would need to land *really* fucking well. They'd need to give better performances than the cast for XV.
Thing is. You kinda need singers and VA's for Symphogear. There isn't really anyone all star that has the chops to do it.
Keep in mind that Bikki appearing made her move her plans forward because she realised that human/relic hybrids were possible.
~~I won't say no to a Zwei Wing Prequel Film though.~~
Honestly? I'm pretty satisfied. Feels like a movie would cheapen the ending here.
~~Admittedly I'm in the second boat.~~
Oh god we've got to trust the Americans
It'd also be a *huge* risk
At this point it's probably best to assume nothing is coming and save yourself the disappointment
Possibly more.
I wouldn't be surprised if the budget is about 60% VA
There's been rumors to that effect
I was wrong, unconfirmed numbers are saying about 26 thousand
About 22 thousand
Xtreme Vibes is Axia No Kaze with the second part done right.
Split it in two and I'd love it.
It doesn't fit with the rest of it. Both parts should've been different songs
Come on, if you're gonna comment on me not liking Axia's second half at least ping me
Just say it's Carol's long lost twin Sister also called Carol
I mean, technically on confirmation of someone's death you just remove them from a criminal register right?
Oh, has the bonus CD arrived on Nyaa yet?
Never mind that works
Can anyone share the mp3 in here? Can't torrent atm
Wait, so of *all* people the first people on Hibiki's mind was Enki and Fine?
That's some real *effort* in the description there
Aside from that, nothing.
You know what I just realised? I don't think Chris and Tsubasa had a single conversation in XV.
Honestly? Watching G for the first time was fantastic. It'd be good if I could do that again.
~~Please don't actually hit a sword, that won't go well for the hand.~~
It's like when an old machine doesn't work and you hit it to get it running again.
Exactly how bad did it get?
Still going strong? Pretty impressive
Of course! Noble Red were sliced from life after all!
Cowards
Gears in general are a brave cosplay.
Fair enough
But honestly? If the revolvers were gonna be so prevalent, we could've at least got more tricks with them. Revolver tricks are cool
Nest Destination in Episode 12 was pretty fantastic
They topped it there when it came to the cliffhangers
Lasting Song's intro is forever imprinted on the Shem-Miku reveal for me
Okay, cry when we don't get PC versions.
And we can all cry when it's never localised.
So the ones to be worried about would be Basa or Chris
Inb4 they get into srw and end up the worst units of that game.
No shit. So did everyone else.
Elsa
*Not the dub*
So what did you think?
Feel like there would've been *hell* to pay if someone had spoiled you on Kanade.

XV was the first time I got to watch this insanity live with you all. Wouldn't give it up for anything to be honest.
You're implying that everyone doesn't already know you're thirsty as hell for him.
When this gets archived, people will be able to read it all
Also archive viewers, you should be *very* scared of the episode called "XV".

I'd take a year's stay at gitmo if it meant not going back into that "therapy".
Good. Went through it myself, not an experience I'd wish on absolutely anyone.

But yeah, always Female MCs then it took me years to figure out "Hey, you fucking idiot. You're trans you bleeding tit."
The attack helicopter joke. Fun, not like that's been used since 2005 or anything and it *severely* pisses me off.
Honestly couldn't put it better than Melua right there.
It's not fun
I hide it semi-often because of being attacked once when someone realised I was trans.
One thing I miss is pockets. That's it.
Oh for fucks sake.
Can confirm that happened to the A Level Comp Sci paper last year. Half the paper wasn't even on the spec.
Welcome to rainbow capitalism, you can buy a "limited edition" pride version of the same thing we expect you to buy all year.
Universally *reviled* by the working class of the UK for destroying our livelihoods while she was in power and replacing it with nothing.
A follower of Margret Thatcher's brand of conservatism.
It's a similar problem with 40k. The Imperium is supposed to be a *hellhole* and yet it gets romanticized despite being a theocratic fascistic dictatorship.
Can't say I'm on board with any kind of death penalty.
You're giving them way too much credit
I thought that was pretty clear sketch. I don't exactly hide it.
I mean, we were already fucked, now we just have him as a leader which makes us just that little bit more.
Fusion's a pipe dream until a breakthrough, which isn't in sight at all. Even then any fusion transition would cost an immense amount of money that people won't invest because capitalism.
Cultured meat is again inhibited by capitalism and lack of investment, additionally it's very likely many nations will pass laws limiting or outright banning it to protect agricultural industries.
Well... fuck
Yep, can confirm with the hair at least.
I flat wasn't able to vote on the bleeding thing and now I've got to look for other options.
Even if it all happened the day Parliament reconvened we wouldn't stand much of a chance.
Keep in mind that we'd need to ask the EU for another extension, which means every day wasted is a day where EU parliament can't vote on it.
There is nothing stopping the PM from basically forcing this through now.
When Parliament reconvenes.
Which gives us 15 days to hold a General Election or otherwise do *something* to stop it all.
Parliament legally cannot sit until the 14th of October.
It just got confirmed
https://twitter.com/BBCVickiYoung/status/1166711208700981249?
Then disaster capitalism
Stall til we crash out of the EU
Ha ha... Ah shit.
https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/aug/28/spending-review-set-for-next-week-fuels-election-speculation-live
The executive, in this case the Cabinet makes all decisions with parliament entirely locked out.
Boris Johnson
It's a coup in all but name, she's told people to piss off with situations like this before.
Honestly the U isn't very accurate and if the Queen says yes we probably won't be the K for much longer.
The PM just asked to suspend parliament.
The UK.
Also my country is currently melting down with what's best described as a kind of coup in progress.
No doubt, but I still think it's a net gain.
Labour isn't left enough for me, unfortunately you could put a labour rosette on a pile of shit and it'd still win up here.
Keep an eye on Iran, if that boils over we'll get pulled along as the American's lapdogs.
~~Very glad I cashed out of TF2 a few years ago.~~
TF2 economy is completely dead in the water from that. No one trusts it anymore and pretty much everything has lost a shitton of value.
There is plans to give the player the means to finish Generalplan ost. I used to be on that team until it got stacked with neo-nazis.
The best way to sum up the HOI4 community. Is that the most anticipated mod is a painstaking recreation of a Nazi victory in Worid War 2. I don't bother with modding anymore because of how much utter shit is in the community.
Pretty sure the guy got fired for it, but it's there and the devs aren't entirely blameless.
Melua, speaking as someone who mods the games. Most of the code you can find commented by devs is painfully edgy. Pretty sure in the original release the tag for Greece was given a comment with a Kebab joke.
With the community
All Paradox games have this issue.
Speaking as someone who's deep into HOI modding. They made changing province manpower difficult and damn near impossible because half the community is Neo-Nazis who'd leap at the chance of doing it.
Ninryu. *What the fuck?*
Electronic voting machines are too easily exploited.
This is fucking hilarious.
An MP has shared the "Shut the fuck up TERF" meme in parliament and called it harassment. There is no level these fucks won't drop to.
Welcome to British Political discourse. ***We're fucked.***
Yes.
That and unless something major is announced at the live. We're sorta doomed to attrition.
Solo, could you expand on that? I've not heard about that one
God I'm a young one to everyone else here.
"Abolition of the Lords"
I'm fucking sold.
It isn't. Electoral commission and such have been informed.
Yeah. I joined, was quiet for a few days. *Got really pissed off* at the Attack Helicopter joke then became fast friends with a few people here.
It's over. Tories win. God help us all

Unless Labour pull a fucking *miracle* out of their hats, it's over
We're fucked
Glad that my city all but kicked it out
Ooooh I have *many* fucking feelings about the Sun
So so many things are wrong with here.
There's a lot wrong with this, so let's start from the top.
- "wait months for a daily check-up" Doesn't happen unless you're *very* rural, like one of the Scottish Islands.
- It's much cheaper to pay a little more in VAT than it is to pay thousands because someone broke their arm. A National Health Service may not be inherently cheaper, but it shares the costs around to everyone who can afford it.
I know. I live here.
That's- how the hell is that relevant to healthcare?
Sliding case for the UK, let me grab the rates one sec
They pay for it, with slightly increased taxes
It's hardly socialism, but go ahead and ask.
As opposed to how the US engages in voter suppression, has concentration camps and frequently "disappears" dissenters. But they have a paid healthcare system so it's democratic.
"The people" so you mean the 1% who don't care about your health. Only how much money they can get out of you.
You're grasping at straws now Cheruiel. If I wanted to, I could go for private healthcare here. But why would I want to when the NHS is fairly fantastic.
Sanders is practically center right compared to europe lad. You'll have to try harder than that.
Please, tell me how competition has kept American healthcare prices down
They will never do that. Capitalism is inherently about squeezing every penny out of whoever needs your thing.
Dear fuck.
The alternative, is that Joe Bloggs who makes maybe ¬£20,000 a year has to pay ¬£3,000 a year for insulin and John Smith who makes ¬£400,000 pays the exact same. There's an inherent imbalance here that the likes of the NHS *vastly* reduces.
Unsurprisingly, money is exchanged for goods and services under a capitalist economy. What's your point here?
Out of curiosity, how is organised crime in Italy? I've never been able to find anything much accurate on it.
Which is *significantly* better than charging people 3k for an ambulance + actual treatment.
Going to be honest the figure was just plucked, I'm trying to make a point that the NHS technically isn't free. It's cost is shared across the entire country through those little 20p things and a slightly higer tax rate overall.
I'm fine paying an extra 20p on a frozen pizza if it means that I don't pay ¬£3k when I need an ambulance
20% here, reduces on certain necessities
Side note, tax accountants make a killing here cause of that.
UK system is that you pay the increased bracket on any money that falls into that bracket. So again, if I earned ¬£15,000. I only pay tax on 2,500
Depends really, the UK one's fairly adequate in my mind.
If you're in the 45 bracket, you almost certainly make your money from a business you own.
So If I made ¬£15,000 I only pay tax on 2,500
UK income tax is weird in that you only pay the increased rate on the money you earn *over* the bracket
UK taxes,
0 - ¬£12,500 not taxed
¬£12,501 - 50k 20%
So on and so forth until over ¬£150k is a 45% tax rate
I'm likely going to regret asking, but what is Kaifuku?
Because that's how they became great powers in the first place.
Border conflicts there happen pretty often, usually it's a few people wounded though. It's not something to be especially worried about. If war was on the table, it would've happened by now.
Guillotine
<@!174272493777977344>
Just boosted the server. You're good Kat
Fucked if I know. One person can be smart. A group of people are fucking idiots.
Better teenagers know how to do that stuff safely rather than fuck up.
People don't like their kids getting sex ed. They're fucking idiots.
I'm sure it's not the first time people have been insulted on the internet.
Can I suggest not dogpiling on a kid who finds it all a little uncomfortable? They're allowed to feel uncomfortable with things.
Ehhh, I found it funny and I kinda needed the laugh
Never mind, realised that had been posted already
Regardless though... Good luck people in the US. I don't think it's going to get any easier for a while.
Yep.
I play a lot of New Vegas, so me kinda.
Likewise
Biden could lose *everything* except PA now and still win the election
~~Seriously I don't get these American state names~~
Alternatively he pulls Pennsylvania out of his hat.
There's a pretty good chance Biden's got Georgia. Alongside Arizona, he'll win
Well. That was fucking pointless.
Something like that. Though a general strike won't happen in the US.
There's no precedent for this
He could just, refuse to acknowledge the election as well
Yeah sounds like it
Specifically calling out Detroit as "duplicating ballots"
Voter identification is the role of a US state you dumb fucker.
I wouldn't trust the fucker if he said the sky was blue.
Claiming unsolicited ballots.
He's now claiming that all votes have to be in by election day
Republican party "the party of inclusion" according to that idiot.
I'm honestly worried for y'all in the US
Called them "suppression polls" whatever the fuck that means
"Media polling is election interference"
Something about mail in votes being fake.
Putting myself through the Trump press conference so you all don't have to.
In a nutshell he's calling the entire election a fraud.
Just a little levity for this chat.

Scared the living shit out of me there mate. That would've been *bad* internationally.
Exactly.
Well. International crisis averted. US still has a national one that could boil over to international if it starts really getting bad.
All sources I'm seeing of that are debunked. Apparantly it was a photoshopped article. Crisis averted
<@!454822882045067298> Got a source of that? Cause this is damned important internationally.
He basically just threatened a regime change
The rest of NATO is going to have to comment now.
Yeah. What he's effectively just done is escalate this to an international crisis.
According to CBC. It's an armed robbery gone wrong
https://twitter.com/CBCAlerts/status/1327334027251027968
I mean. They can't do anything.
Even then, the ones that didn't have it where just keeping quiet about the obvious.
Slavery was in the majority of states seceding's declarations.
The regret/detransition rate is still something like, less than one percent last I checked
Exactly
They'd do pretty well on their own. Not a major power, but a solid country in it's own right.
The hell are you on about? Scotland's got a damn good service and tech industry alongside North Sea oil. I wouldn't be surprised if they had a higher GDP per capita than the rest of the UK
Or Yugoslavia
It was Bush, they got deployed in Afghanistan and kept bombing allies.
Because humans are opportunistic bastards
The British in 1947? No.
Bengal/Bangladesh was another example, as well as reports of British forces literally tearing up railway lines on the way out
Ensure a swift hasty exit while the colony remains profitable: <:greentick:567088336166977536> 
Deliberately leave unanswered territoral and ethnic questions that plague the subcontinent to this day. <:greentick:567088336166977536>
It was hardly a plan for peace. The goal of the plan was to pretty much cripple the subcontinent. Which it's done quite well.
Oh it did exactly what it was supposed to
Justice is done
Likewise. This is fucking disgusting
For the western allies generally yes. They usually got the Gulag if they were caught up in the Doctor's Plot in the USSR though
The US refused Jewish refugees fleeing Germany. France in exile allowed multiple progroms in it's colonies under it's control. Occupying British forces in Libya allowed a pogrom in 1945 that lead to hundreds dead and thousands displaced in Tripoli. Occupied Krakow (by the USSR) had a state sponsored pogrom in 1945.

The Doctor's plot was a false accuation in the USSR that lead to a Union-wide crackdown on Jewish people... There's a lot.
Macron is in Chad for the dictator's state funeral. Rebels have begun a march on the capital. If he's hurt or captured, France will probably kick up bloody murder and invoke Entente Cordiale.
I'd prefer to not get dragged into a war because France can't let go of it's empire.
NATO only applies in the North Atlantic. Chad's too far for them to call an article 5.
Mali would disagree, considering half the French army is stationed there.
~~At least I think it's Mali.~~
It's surprising what we can do against something that's a genuine threat.
That and the "racial superiority"
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cod_Wars>
The vast majority of pollution and effect of climate change is done by seven major corporations. I can see why people would want to reduce meat consumption, but it'll make little difference without massively curtailing those corporations and that's the *scary* communism.
He's a wet noodle of a leader.
A competent UN would do something about the blatant settler colonialism from Israel and such.
Not like the US ever abides by the treaties it signs
The tech's all impressive, but again. You're gambling millions of lives on a coin flip.
Cypher. There's a massive difference between a single planned test vs a more realistic situation with massed ICBMs.
Especially considering the majority of those used are MIRVs, so you'll need to hit every single warhead.
It's an impressive piece of tech, but it's not something I'd gamble against a nuclear ICBM with
Yes
Literally every major power has some form of anti-sat
I'm looking at the Arrow system. It's far from reliable enough to expect it to work.
Iron Dome isn't designed to intercept ICBMs, it's designed to intercept land based artillery rockets. *Massive* difference
A destroyer squadron isn't going to be able to fire on something in LEO.
The main issue with the original UN plan was how it created a vast number of enclaves and exclaves of both countries within each other. And nuker is right at this stage, to abide by the UN plan would need vast forced displacement.
Could you reword this? I, really can't understand
Appreciated, thanks for clearing it up.
I kinda have a problem with settler colonialism unsurprisingly.
The ones that eventually became the Scots. Gaelic I think? I'm not too familiar with ancient history of the British isles.
Well, yes. The native britons were pushed out by the Anglo-saxons. Should we hand over England to the Celts?
Small question here. Just checking, what are you using for that claim?
Regardless, neither the Isreali state, nor Israelis going for it are innocent when it comes to the ongoing settler colonialism. Massed evictions of Arabs and Palestinians are kind of ongoing.
2014? Or something else?

<https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2019/02/28/israeli-snipers-targeted-children-health-workers-journalists/>
Gimme a sec, I'll find it
I believe that's the abbreviation
The IDF has multiple times had their people revealed to keep scoreboards of dead children. The IDF has also deliberately targeted international aid workers and medical personal. Sorry, I can't take that one lying down.
I'm not talking about Gaza.
Yeah? I know major countries have committed blatant settler colonialism. I can't change the past but I can condemn it when it see it happening.
Understood. My apologies.
Forced evictions of arabs in eastern Jerusalem ringing any bells?
To be clear for those who're trying to keep up with the conversation. This is a letter from Israel's rep to the UN. It's not a statement from the UN itself.
More or less, you use the WP to confirm your calculations for artillery or just to make sure you're on target.

If people could determine if this is real, that's horrific.

Okay that's fucking beautiful
Exactly.
Ergo silence.
I do. He doesn't just start something without getting something in return.
I mean, they've not had much of a reason to comment.
You can be both

Just to factcheck here. They actually did for quite a while, USSR supported them along side some fairly wealthy American businessmen.
Partition of India, the shitshow in East Africa, the UK was completely fucking awful for it.
I mean, Israel did elect Netanyahu.
Let's not get into a "F-35s are shit" debate here. It's off topic.
There's a lot of stuff that's very blurry with it all. Fair enough.
Fucking hell 10 mins? Lucky they've probably prepared for stuff like this.
At least that's something. IDF generally shoot journalists for less.
Any idea why IDF is targeting press now?
Eh, fair enough.
Someone who literally used to work there
<https://twitter.com/ImtiazTyab/status/1393545888115695619>
Update, the BBC was also in the building
Same with AJ
That's what I was thinking, it's not like AP are lacking funds to move to a different building
That, feels like IDF justifying them shutting up Al Jazeera for a while. Strange that AP didn't notice a bunker underneath them.
Quick question when they say "The AP" here, are they referring to Associated press or another organsation?
https://twitter.com/BBCWorld/status/1393535673307705346
https://twitter.com/AJEnglish/status/1393587008732282880
I've not looked into that one all too much.
They also bombed the Red Crescent recently I think?
Unless you're hiding that you're actually a high ranking IDF member, I don't think people were expecting you to pull out evidence yourself.
The burden of proof is usually on the accuser for a reason.
We're not. But it's clearly becoming more than a little impossible to convince either of you to consider otherwise. So I'm going to just go.
Lank, I'm gonna refer you to the multitude of Arab-Israeli wars.
The majority are homemade, utilising Israeli duds.
Solo, with all due respect. Please stop both siding this.
To be fair Carolnein. I've been listening to you and Solo about this for the last week or so. Short of me going there, probably not gonna get much more solid accounts.
Because frankly put, I've seen the IDF and various other organisations investigate themselves and clear themselves of wrongdoing.
No. I'm calling for more damned oversight into the IDF, a damned ceasefire and an international inspection into the Red Crescent bombing and the media bombing.
Hardly better? You can't seriously be telling me that this is *proportionate*?
I know people in Palestine dammit. I know what it's like for them. Don't you dare imply that I'm in favour of Hamas targeting civilians.
Lank, Solo's not been the one specifically justifying strikes. That's another member of the community.
No offense Solo, but this feels *really* off to me. It feels like factions in Syria have more oversight on strike targets. Yeah, Hamas may have been in one place or another, but hospitals tend to have patients who absolutely cannot be moved. Bombing them regardless puts a very bad taste in my mouth.
Much appreciated Lily. I'd like to ask, if it's at all possible to bar me from the channel as well. I'd prefer to not get drawn in and that'd be pretty helpful in doing so. A few day's be good.
Yeah
I suppose they couldn't give up the upgrading money
Reaper is also an option, though it's a bit of a challenge to get used to. Does the Winrar thing as well, so it's free.
They look like they've come from an NBC site
Possibly, most likely knowing what little I do about Genshin
It's an interesting one, because situations like this have happened before in some other gacha games. While I don't think there'll be a full redesign, I do think they'll sideline the character and cease making new content for him.
It is. Recording in 24fps makes it a crapshhot if ypu even catch the muzzle flash so it's mostly vfx's job to edit it on.
"Will be chaired by Russia."
Good to know it'll do nothing then.
Turkish troops and aircraft are in that airport. Surely Russia's not that stupid, right?
Russian strategic bombing force is in the air and they've threatened to nuke anyone who gets involved.
Kyiv is getting bombed. Just happened live on CNN I heard.
OSINT is also a pretty good role
Not that there'll be much of a Russian economy left when those sanctions are lifted.
Not even the most right wing Ukrainians like em, they'll be fairly quickly dissolved
Someone ring up Mossad, we need their expertise.
My gf's watching this in horror.
Other way around. Russian marking used on invasion vehicles that's become a symbol of support for the Russian invasion.
So, don't call a Scot or Irishman English
True.
I mean, the US is obligated to do regardless of what the president says.  Unless they want to ruin their reputation and tear up a defensive pact
For the love of fuck, listen to everyone else for five minutes.
She's dead yes. BBC just announced it
Yeah. This looks like the real thing.
Liverpool at least is quite happy at the news
I've put out my Irish flag, half the street's partying.
Molotov-Ribbentrop says hello.
The USSR didn't do shit all aside from sabotage the Spanish Republicans.
Which technically makes Muskrat guilty of evading sanctions.
It was actually the Taliban media department.
Electrical Fires are wild.
No clue. Heavens know why I'm still here.
Likewise, god knows I could sit here and yell about the bullshit the US and allies have done in other places. But arming a country in a defensive war of annihilation sure as hell isn't one of them.
"Few". Please name a single European nation that entered the Second Indochina War.
Unless you're referring to the First Indochina war, which was Vietnam trying to kick out France
NATO didn't enter Vietnam. That was a US and Australian enterprise.
European Solidarity took leadership in the 2014 parliamentary election, again coalitioning with a national party because a lot of Ukrainian conservativism is rooted in old anti-soviet/socialist forces. But even then, they were hardly card carrying Neo Nazis
And *that* government didn't even last a *year*
Batkivshchyna, a conservative party yeah, but you're making it sound like they were going out in the street and declaring death to X or Y
The government post-Euromaiden was headed by Batkivshchyna, not  Svoboda, who were explicitly the minor party in a coalition.
... What the fuck are you talking about
