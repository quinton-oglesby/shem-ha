I guess it would be rude if I don't introduce myself.
I watched Symphogear around the time G aired so i missed out on watxhing the first season live.

I like magical girls that punch stuff, so basically eo far only Symphogear, Yuki Yuna, Nanoha Vivid and some seasons of Precure manage to fill thst niche.











A new challenger appears for Chris's "MORE DAKKA!"
some of these aren't quite "safe" but oh well

Here's some Mecha Musume

Not really anime related but this artwork is so awesome it made me want to create a character based on it.

Uraraka isn't foul mouthed though




careful his pixiv is very NSFW 😛
that artist only draws adult Hibiki with long hair

I don't get it, why griffins
Theres a pixiv artist who ONLY draws long haired MILF Hibiki

Nvm found it
Link picture that's the Server avatar currently?
What he said
this came out before XV, what fans wanted.
Please hug me with your claws
interesting
oh




someone drew "Noise" versions of Symphogears







not anime but still cute

https://i.redd.it/nf99f4vi06j41.jpg






or just mecha
See zone of enders crossover would make total sense

Yuki Yuna has SOME outfits that are a bit scifi
I don't know any show besides Symphogear and Ore Twintails that uses mecha/scifi armor for the magical girls
this artist is really good

> Moefication of either characters who are not normally moe, or objects and concepts which are not even alive. Very popular with Fan-Art and merchandise. Often referred to as "gijinka", the Japanese word for "anthropomorphism".
> 
> The mecha musume — basically, battle vehicles or Humongous Mecha rendered as cute girls — are a common form of moe anthropomorphism. Can also overlap with Cute Monster Girl if the moefied character is a monster. If the original character is male, Gender Flip may be a component, although boy implementations do occasionally happen.
the specific theme is often called "mecha musume" or "gijinka"
most are original art, some are refferences to games
King of Heroes vs Golden Hamster

I think I posted this already but its worth posting again
though with those boots might be a kick instead
so is her special move called GENOCIDE FIST?

and yeah I forgot to use the command to not look for course
6 warnings?
whops I broke it















Hamster Jesus
Here you go more meme material
Anyone notice Hibiki "jazz hands" in the first few moments after the giant red laser explosion? Almost a callback to that meme gif of her
<@456226577798135808>
Jojo also never got sued and it's chock full of music references.

They had to change ACDC to "Esidisi" or something like that.
And a few other names
"Oh you want your friend back alive? Trivial, here have 10 identical copies. Have fun."
You know if Symphogear was a more serious show, the Custodians could be like the uber aliens in Gantz
So when's Fine gonna show up again?
Blue Ray version when?
>Here's how Kirika's transformation sequence was made more wholesome:

>A few months before starting work on the animation I was called into the conference room and told that lewdness was prohibited.
>
>When the sketch was 60% done I scrapped it myself for being too vulgar (taking half of my allotted production time)
>
>When the in-betweens were done it wouldn't stand for broadcast and another 10 seconds were cut.
Supposedly this was the "toned down version"
Maybe she watched too much Panty and Stockings
Anyone besides me a little creeped out with Kirikas transformation sequence?
<@553585004907855892> declawed
Well cyborg tail
Her tail is her main weapon
I wanna take the catgirls tail and then do bad things to her while she's disarmed
Speaking of villains
Wat
The seal thing will probably prevent Tsubasa from activating her gear after this so we get ANOTHER annoying power up arc like the one in GX
And Alca Noise are human controlled
Since normal Noise no longer are a threat
Yes
I didn't expect so much *dess* this episode
Oh yeah gotta make this pun
Yes
<@265617214931992576>

are we going to meet god and they look like a bishie pretty boi or a manly man of a man


Turns out god is actually Nyarlanthotep
And the backstory of all 3of them is that they are failures
Cyborg
FBI is gonna visit a lot of people this season
Frankenstein Monster
"Hey Miku here's a gear"
"Wat"
300% less cute now
So the cat girl is a wolf girl?
No
Hibiki ripping the Nephilims still beating heart is still METAL!
And Berserker Hibiki of season 2
Same as early Season 1
The dude can sprint on water and use a substitution dummy
He's a ninja, of course he got out
Shame we never got a proper flashback for him
On a serious note I wonder when did he go insane
Not his fault everyone else couldn't match his hammyness
"How the hell is he still alive?"

Ver "NANOMACHINES SON!"
Or angel related
And the gear could be something Nephilim related
The daughter is actually a clone of him
His genderbent clone duh
His daughter shows up and she has a Gear
I found a way to bring Ver back
Isn't Hibiki the God Emperor? Given her powered up form is all golden?
DEMONBANE
They summon
And then
Also Segway Noise are the ultimate weapon
And then she kills Millarac by ripping her heart out
I want the hypnosis thing to horribly backfire when used on Hibiki and give us back berserker Hibiki
And her song is her being pissed off at herself like her recent confession
Theory: Hibiki gets KOed later and Miku saves the day by using Gungnir
Ninja Car Tehniques takes the cake this episode though
https://i.imgur.com/GlFv3pp.gif
As long as they don't name their kid something dumb like Albus Severus Potter
That pictures makes me want to see them do the fusion dance
Only one C'Tan is alive and basically enslaved
TLDR: Necrons betrayed the C'Tan, killed them and mined their corpses for weapon materials
<@200030864497704960> Too bad the C'Tan got retconned and ass fucked by the Necrons now in the new codex
I won't be able to watch the ep until 4 hours later
Christ that's gonna spoil so many people
Do we have the henshin animation as a clip yet?
Hoping for a good fight next ep
I expected Berserker Hibiki this season . Instead I got ||Berserk Elfnine|| and I'm not disappointed.
So far
Speaking of gungnir, does the faust robe count as a god killer if it destroys miracles?
Mostly his arm
Eh like half of him mutated
Instead of Ver can we just have his ARM come back as another Nephilim?
He got crushed by rocks
Technicaly yes
With a mecha body
Like AI Junko
AI Ver
I'm just joking and saying it was TOO much hype for the reaction pic
The excitement finally killed them
Btw shes white haired and cute
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
They find a clone-pod and a girl comes out.
Geahs "Who are you?"

Girl "What don't you recognize me? I'm Doctor VER!... 2.0 clone..." 

Maria breaks down and just repeats "Impossible" for a good minute and half.

Kirika and Shirabe look confused as hell.

Girl-Ver starts singing and gets  a henshin sequence. 




Well there you go, get some brain bleach now.  <@260863818735943680>
<@260863818735943680> you want a nightmare scenario?
Adam had a bit of a special body though
Wasn't Adam completely destroyed though?
Its him naked with a mini sun in his hand
When they show the illuminati they show Adams picture too
It's a malformed Behelit, with tentacles
Because they are, "failures" and its a sore spot for them
I hope to dear god Elfnein/Carol shit talks the alchemists
Ok serious for a moment
JUDGMENT GUN MORPHING
Hibiki becomes a scarf?
Tsubasa becomes a literal sword for Genjuro
I wanna see Genjuro in a serious fight
Carol becomes Elfnein s Stand
Then kills god
They have Genjuro eat beef stroganoff and he powers up like Popeye eating spinach
What if they kill god with beef stroganoff?
Sgg means a, "spectacle fighter" like Bayonetta
It didn't age her up this time so it might be modified or incomplete
Carol likes genocide so much she's like a generic xianxia MC/Villain
Just don't let the Cenobites grab Tsubasa
<@476058996315389953> "Error wetware compromised. Replacing components"
"System Error. Disabling gear"
Hm
She's gonna STRING them up...
Since the current ones have a closeup to "Systems all green. Normal operation"
I still wanna know if we will get a different henshin
Ill post it there
Yep
Anime ends with a mind break
But the manga ends with character development
It was a slice of life anime and manga
Spoilers for the anime/manga I mentioned || Kuma Miko||
The anime ends with thr MC mindbroken and regressed
And where thr manga ended positively
There was an anime that went for an anime only ending
God dont mention mental regression
Even Genjuro was taken aback by Tsubasas response

<@486087033652248576> if they have a "mild warm" setting and not just "molten metal". Yeah sure
TFW: You'll never get to feel Micahs hands touch you.
Yeah but Kirika is a baka dess
Her skirt is also scandaloussly short
Why does she have stockings though
Lion?
Micah again the only one actually having fun
When a character cooks food so bad, it gets mosaic censored
At least none of the characters are a "lethal chef"
I mean
Chris eating style is "wolf it all down" and it can't change
I doubt Carol took care of herself either
Heresy
Don't you diss tomatoes
Probably forgets to eat often
And she's a hardcore lab-junkie scientist who spends too much time tinkering
Elfnein was originally an expendable clone no?
Being well fed and taken care of wasn't in the initial plan probably?
And it takes a while to put on weight
And Kirika slurps and doesn't hold the pinky out
I imagine Chris drinking tea with her pinky out, but slurping
But dess doesn't even mean death :V
Shem-Ha seems a LITTLE pissed at people trying to control it
Also
They got Ryner-d
I didn't expect Noble Red to be just killed off like that
Hm
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=gw98ARXfcqk
I have a song for Noble Red
And Popeye can delete SSJ
Shem Ha just means "name" or "god" but basically it's not a name itself.
Oh lol
And figure out a way to kill her and NOT kill Miku at the same time
Still need to stab her with the spear
If we stick to the Sumerian/Babylonian myths
I mean within Symphogear
You're drunk, go home
The only thing that could one-up ShemHa would be something like Tiamat
And anyways Symphogear is Sumerian / Babylonian themed
Haven't seen him do shit for 2000+ years so I dunno how he'd help
Again, which one?
Take your pick
Which god <:Ver:336656981144109066>
You'd need the Ultimate Nullifier at least
I mean if we wanna bring in comic book logic
Might as well summon Ajimu Najimi into every story and have her deus ex machina the plot
I mean
Yeah even Genjuro isn't allowed to do that and he's top dad
And giving the artifact to Strange? Lol no those morons almost ended the universe with a bunch of glowing stones, I wouldn't trust them with a divine relic
Shem-Ha would do that dimensional distortion thing and reset
Except that wouldn't work
So uh

Shem-Ha is Babidi from DBZ and Noble Red is now Majin mode  :V
Id rather have Shem-Ha *blow* me
Look all of your power level talk is useless in front of Ajimu so shush
Mobile auto complete
[All Fiction] Enuma Elish no longer exists. Can we move on now?
Ah OK then
Isn't it 12?
I don't know how they will end this with just one episode
To be fair, one look at the internet would make ShemHa want to wipe out all of humanity for being fucked up in the head
Now shop that face onto someone from "Hackers"
Pff
Oh boy
Porn of Shem Ha humping a toaster
<@279341087494242304> and that's how people developed an inanimate TF AND snuff fetish at the same time
Can we make Shem Ha suffer by downloading her onto floppy disks?
Gotta respect Carol, she fought god and didn't get instantly wrecked AND managed to damage her enough to force her to use that restoration ability.

And she did this alone AND when not at full power
I know it's because of their culture but it still sucks
Also my PFP is my face at the thoughts of what I'd do to Shem Ha (original body)
Slightly disappointing fight
Miku || offscreen transformation again||
No kiss because lesbian kissing is HARAM
Basically a reboot, takes the original material and makes an adaptation that only shares the core idea but everything else is almost new
Dororo
Anyways discussion started with this

https://filmschoolrejects.com/pokemon-satanic-panic/
There was a time when Pokemon was demonized too
It went so far that 2nd edition had to rename all devils that were named after Biblical ones
But (mostly) that's all it is, some roleplay.
Thinking otherwise is what caused conservative people to think that D&D is Satanism
I've played a few games of Dark Heresy and Death Watch. It's really easy to play a fanatic and can be somewhat cathartic
Only thing I can find was that it was more satirical but not an outright parody
But it WAS supposed to be dystopian
It was never a parody
Tau are just insane as the Imperium
The Interex were smart but died
Eldar are ok
But yes it's a hellhole
Only because it's better than the alternative which is Chaos
Like no redeeming qualities evil
And Valentine is an absolute prick
Stormtroopers and Darth Vader
Star Wars
And this post

If any of you guys haven't watched it in the previous season i recommend Planets With
"Yes, at Seishou Academy every girl is literally a lethal weapon, and they're all gunning for the top shot at getting their own personal serviceman! Needless to say, it's going to be difficult for newly recruited human instructor Genkoku to adjust to working with a living arsenal of high caliber cuties with tricky names like FNC (Funko) M 16A4 (Ichiroku) L85A1 (Eru) and SG 550 (Shigu). Especially since many have hair triggers and there's no bulletproof vest that can stop a really determined coed! He'll have to rewrite the operator's manual on student/teacher relationships, and pray that his job description won't include having to field strip and reassemble one of his cadets in the dark. But unfortunately (for him) FNC's already thinking about becoming HIS personal weapon, and she usually gets what she aims for!"

I'd be up for it
I mean we can go crazier https://safebooru.org/index.php?page=post&s=view&id=2695929
I guess?
Prefferably that it's a GOOD show and not some trash like that one with figurine girls
so anyone know any other show besides  Symphogear that goes with the Mecha Musume aesthetic?   Basically like this pic
no
https://s5.mkklcdnv5.com/mangakakalot/b2/bokura_wa_mahou_shounen/chapter_1/10.jpg
Rambunctious Kaito Odagiri, who longs to be a hero, is suddenly invited by mysterious transfer student Makoto Kaibara to take up the mantle of a hero who protects their town. But contrary to his expectations, he suddenly finds himself with the gaudy appearance of a kind of hero known as a "Magical Boy"! And though at first Kaito cries "why did it have to be something as embarrassing as this?! I won't do it!" with a tear-stained face, before long he finds himself enchanted by his own unbelievable cuteness...!

Boys are cute – and strong! The curtain rises on this tale of super righteous magical boys!
"Bokura wa Mahou Shounen"
I found the gayest (in a cute way) manga ever
Ugh
And the magical girl x mecha anime
I hope BEM won't suck
Your name is lewd
And one that's a music video
Theres also one episode that's just them sitting in a room and talking
Chuck's episode is trippy
And then the bastards gave us a Gainax Ending
Lol
Hm
Aw
Since all characters are american in the show
<@220201140141162496> Baccano dub is often cited as better than the sub
https://myanimelist.net/anime/39417/Granbelm
I want this to be good
"Hey guys this show has an R rating lets put in a lot of swearing too"
Yeah Panty swears a lot more
<@279341087494242304> but the dub didn't give us "Rrrruuuurrrrrrrs!"
Half of Gridman is refferences
I miss the claymation monster deaths from Panty and Stocking
Houseki is a masterpiece
The CGI for Kumo looks low budget
Kumo doesn't have a harem or romance and the MC is a girl
But the anime will sadly be CGI
Kumo is great
Yeah its more action and comedy later
Arifureta is popular and isn't bad after the initial edge
The cheat mage one is REALLY bad avoid it
So the MC hatches a mermaid egg in a pot of boiling water and the mermaid is super clingy to him.

They manage to get some telepathic communication with her to explain that the MC isn't her "mother" (MC is a man)

"Well I got good news and bad news. Good news she doesn't think you're her mother, but rather her dad or guardian"

MC: "Ok that's good, that makes it less awkward" 

"Bad news is, she thinks this is her mother..." *points at the pot the egg was boiled in*

MC: "..."
I'm reading a novel called "The record of unusual creatures"
And a scene has me laughing like crazy
Oh and she's the protagonist
Freakishly tall, totally insane, mass murderer oh and a hardcore lesbian with an insatiable libido
Meet Kuroko from Murcielago

Do you guys like serial killer lesbians?
Well more of a teaser
Made in Abyss sequel movie trailer
https://youtu.be/izWEmnpmTKM
She only joined to lose weight
Someone joked about how the MC will react when she finds out putting on muscle means GAINING weight
Life goals
It starts kinda like Symphogear season 1, overly dark but then mellows out just a tad
Anyone besides me enjoyed this?

https://myanimelist.net/anime/17651/Genei_wo_Kakeru_Taiyou
https://youtu.be/EvWtltHz1cY
Or maybe better version
Looks like an even dumber version of Everyone Else Was A Returnee
Never read that one
With the camera following a character and moving around the character as they walk and run but it doesn't "cut" in the scene
Theres one scene that's an "uncut" camera shot that lasts nearly a full minute
Like really cool camera shots that you can't replicate in 2D
Yeah
Some of the camera work it does is impossible in. 2D
Its 3D animated but takes advantage of that instead of being held back by it
Try Houseki no Kuni
I mean if you want unique visuals
Then don't watch any anime ever because half of them use similar styles?
Not sure why you're judging it just by looks
I watched it after Symphogear and was happy with it
Eh
Yuuki Yuna is also very gaaaay like Symphogear
I don't think that looks too generic
https://media1.tenor.com/images/08e1183a5b2a3a6fd3dc0892255eb6d1/tenor.gif?itemid=6195263
And while I love Nobunagun its basically B-tier and kinda corny
And the action scenes are great too
It has a typical magical girl setup but the character interaction and drama is well made
Yuuki Yuna is pretty good
That's the MC
https://66.media.tumblr.com/770fd6287226f4947567d463b94a6b5b/tumblr_of30xzbxsU1snxhcmo1_540.gif
https://myanimelist.net/anime/19855/Nobunagun
https://myanimelist.net/anime/25519/Yuuki_Yuuna_wa_Yuusha_de_Aru
And then she gets to transform into a super-powered version of Nobunaga with a gatling gun
Which has a girl MC who's a military gear/vehicles otaku
And one more anime that's silly nonsense with somewhat mediocre writing and plot but ok action scenes "Nobunagun"
I mean the MC even punches stuff like Hibiki
Also people mentioning Nanoha and Symphogear comparisons but why nobody mentioned Yuki Yuna is a Hero?
Btw. It's a boy
Also from Maou sama

Regenerating the broken neck won't heal your brain damage from lack of oxygen
Why can a high schooler fist fight lions and win
Like how do you survive with a broken neck for more than 2 minutes
You mean the scientific anime that's not scientific at all?
Well its a shounen but a well done one so far
Why drop Fire Force its just getting good with the conspiracy
I don't think you fight him directly but he's a character in the games
And the Saint Jesus anime while not depicting him as evil still counts as heresy
Devil Saga comes to mind, YHWH is a character in it
I'm pretty sure the abrahamic god has been used as a villain in some anime and games
Ehh
And he has stigmata on his hands
Since his abilities include multiplying food and healing wounded
Its probably Jesus
"Let me educate you how a real vampire fights"

And at this moment Luke knew he fucked up.
JUSTICE GUN MORPHING
Space Patrol Luluco has its own weird style
And of course there's Panty and Stocking which was done in a western cartoon style
"Karas" is an older anime that used a lot of CGI but damn it looks good

Death Parade is visually interesting and has a really catchy opening animation and sound

The plot isn't bad either

<@193408538909868033> if you want unique visuals try "Kemonozume"
And its perfect because the scene is the character being all tense and scared
Dude you are not a WRITER you are a TRANSLATOR
The guy who wrote that script replied on. Twitter "I'm glad my script pissed you off"
Also
Like wtf that isn't even a correct translation in any way
In episode 7 of the FUNimation sub of the anime Kangogu Gakuen, or "Prison School", a female character says "You keep talking to me like we're on equal terms, but I'm a 2nd-year. You have to address a superior more politely". In the recently released FUNimation dub, the character says "Do you have a stick up your ass? Or are you one of those dumb-ass Gamergate creepshows?".
Prison School had a Gamergate line in it
"Im a woman" only implies she finds it odd for another woman to hit on her, but doesn't outright reject her. 

"I'm not into women" just confirms she's straight so any kind of further advances can be considered harassment
That single line is a huge change
Er
In the first episode, the dub changed Kobayashi's line (in response to Tohru's advances) from "But I'm a woman" to "I'm not into women" - which turns a yuri trope into a flat rejection.
And why would Lucoa be bothered about "the patriarchy" when she's an ancient dragon who was worshiped as a god?
But the dub changes the whole joke and its tone
And wears somewhat revealing clothing
Toru tells her to change her body because Lucoa has MASSIVE TITTIES
And it changes the tone of the joke
Yep
Tohru: "what are you wearing that for?"

Lucoa: "oh those pesky patriarchal societal demands were getting on my nerves, so I changed clothes"

Tohru: "give it a week, they'll be begging you to change back"
Dub:
Tohru: "what's with that outfit?"

Lucoa: "everyone was always saying something to me, so I tried toning down the exposure. How is it?"

Tohru: "you should try changing your body next."
Original
Lemme find the scene
There were a few scenes where they changed the meaning in a weird way
Least its better than Kobayashi dub that has agenda pushing
It's just weird and feels out of place
They completely threw out the story abd and dialogue and just turned the whole show into an abridged parody
The official dub was a gag dub
I watched Duel Masters dubbed
Dude
Like wtf shiny?
. Monkeys call him hairless not shiny
A lot of stuff in the manga makes more sense
Heck the manga shows a scene of his neck with SFX for "crack" as it mends back into place
The anime drags it out too much
I guess its a bit different since in the manga the whole revival thing happens much fastee
But how did he even survive it
Im all for the regeneration fixing his neck, that makes sense in the story
Dont get me wrong
Well you just said he was breathing
He also condemned him to being alive but paralyzed
Not only did he fail to kill him in one blow as promised
But that just means the primate guy double fucked up
It does if you stop breathing
The Paradox brothers fell to their death
Arcanas saws were actual sawblades
Oh and there's no Shadow Realm in the original
Did the scene with the maneater bug eating them get completely removed?
Well they might have removed the blood but kept the weapons?
Their censorship was hilarious
Oh right 4kids
All blood replaced with water
Smoker renamed to Chaser
Cigars getting completely removed so Smoker looks like he has face paralysis
Lolipops instead of cigarettes
Water guns and hammers instead of guns
Or FUNimation censoring One Piece
But I think we can all agree that "These jelly filled donuts" is the best-worst translation ever
But that doesn't mean every joke can be rewritten without losing the initial intent or meaning
Since they can't be directly translated
Like wordplay or similar
Like I understand if some jokes have to be localized
And the scene of the little sister hugging the doctor lady because she "perceives her as human" was touching
PIG COMING THROUGH
I'm on ep 10or so
Pretty fun so far
I've been watching and enjoying Kimetsu no Yaiba for the past few days
So we ever getting a Yuki Yuuna SEQUEL? Or is it gonna be infinite prequels and side stories?
That llama show is basically a ripoff of Danganronpa
You just now found Release the Spyce?
It's weird because it has a lot of dark stuff too
Haven't finished it, has a lot of eps but watched almost twenty eps I think?

Anime toned down the skimpy outfits a lot
Dumbbell manga is more ecchi than the anime

Retro animation homage and the music too

Before I die I need to cosplay "one winged office" Sephiroth but with added 3 day beard and beer gut
Which is one of the factors that helps in driving him crazy and making him finally snap
For example they skip over how the MC is starving to death over the span of days/weeks but can't die because of the healing water.
While the novel is definitely edgy it makes WAY more sense than the anime
Arifureta was butchered to hell in the anime
Just related to the MC and what a "genius" he is
Half the characters exist just to spout variations of "sasuga Ainz sama" basically
Basically no spoilers: the author invents new characters and promptly discards them once they are done praising the MC and drooling over what a genius he is
You haven't reached the worst part of Isekai Cheat Magician then
When he charges Tanjiro in their second meeting
I love the sword crafter guy
It was a great scene
Kimetsu no Yaiba watchers will understand

A dog is fine too

Hungry dragon loli

Sadly the only legal way to watch it is Netflix... In 3 to 5 months
Basically R rated Zootopia and does the whole herbivore - carnivore dynamic much better
I watched the currently aired first two eps and it's damn good

I'm watching Dr Stone,  Beastars,  No Guns Life, Kemono Michi, Average Abilities
what are you guys watching this season?
Like when she's dressed as Roshi
Almost every visual pun was anime only
The anime added a lot of unnecessary visual puns and references that the novel didn't have
In the novel she just basically makes a magic railgun
And I'd have to double check but
It's just a joke

any of you guys hyped for Tower of God?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKSpEOMHvIU
he's just a walking buff
I doubt the game is very story heavy
since its a mobile game adaptation they can make up a lot of stuff
probably director?
humor has a bit of Konosuba feel to it
seems they put a lot of budget into it so it ends up a good advert for the game
animation is really good though

There's a lot of interesting twists, though the story kinda slows down once it gets near to the end, but that was in the web novel, its possible the Light novel version improved the pacing
"I'm a spider so what?"

One of the better isekai stories out there. She starts off pretty weak and has to go through hell in order to power up.
yes
Mushoku Tensei is one of the first isekai stories that kinda resulted in the theme becoming popular.

Appmonsters weren't initially even supposed to be a Digimon related franchise but a totally new one. But they were semi-forced to be rebranded as Digimon because the brand still has power and popularity
a lot of problems are just solved with violence
Any fight Touma is in?
> it's not a battle shonen x(

Werent multiple plots solved by just duking it out?
yeah but there's mages
and from what I've read of the later novels, certain Divine powers because he can't compute them
his only weaknesses like I said would be curse magic, reality warping and power nulification like what Touma has
what we think of time doesn't really exist as such
not really
mmm
his only weakness is stuff like curse magic that doesn't have a vector
because the concept of his power is more basic than all the other ones
I mean Accelerator is broken by design
hm
and Level 0s are a special exception
> Exceptions aside, cannot be considered completely powerless, but is considered one of the so-called "students that can't keep up at school". Might possess some degree of power, but unable to truly control it.
and Accelerator is a theoretical level 6 since he outclasses all the other level 5s anyways
kind of a big jump from 3 to 4 and 5
index system: 
Level 1
> Powers of the degree to bend a spoon, many students belong here. 
Level 2
> Just like Level 1, powers are not very useful in everyday life. 
Level 3
> The degree when powers are considered convenient in everyday life, ability-wise this is the Level when one starts to be treated as part of the elite. 
Level 4
> Powers of an extent that their wielder acquires tactical value of a military force. 
Level 5
> Powers of an extent that their wielder can fight alone against a military force on equal terms.
it would make sense that they are FEARED, but they are treated as sub human and hated
for the higher level ones... why would you antagonize someone who can crush your head with their thoughts?
for the low level ones it doesnt make sense since most of them are borderline harmless or about as dangerous as a human armed with a baseball bat
one thing that never really made sense to me in Zettai, is that espers are treated as sub-human but are stronger than normal humans
since there's also stuff like pyrokinesis and teleportation and such
note this is all in refference to basic psychokinesis
> 4     Capable of knocking down a flower vase. They're also capable of sensing peoples who are walking. They can protect themselves. 
> 
> 5 Capable of seeing through walls. They are also capable of knocking down tombstones. 
> 
> 6 Capable of destroying a house; and able to create landslides and fissures on the ground. 
> 
> 7 Capable of destroying various kinds of objects, they're also able to fly.
> 1     Capable of sensing people who are standing still, they are also very sensitive to people with psychic abilities. 
> 
> 2     Capable of sensing many people, they're also capable of making a door or a screendoor tremble. 
> 
> 3     Capable of making a house tremble, along with moving long distances through a suspended electric phenomenon. 

So those are the "low level ones"
> Espers come in varying degrees of strength, categorized on a scale of 1 to 7. There are hundreds of thousands of Espers all over the world that are Level 1 to 3, but only 3% of Espers make up Levels 4 to 7.
but the higher level ones can just wreck shit
since low level espers aren't that impressive
also interesting both series use a level system for espers, and its a exponential system
yeah Hyobu is || 80+ ||
and he's been doing this for like ... || 50+ years ||
although its also a bit different because Hyobu is || using his powers to essentially heals himself / slow his metabolism, so that the bullet wound he got in his head doesn't kill him ||
so pretty close
Zettai manga was 2005, Index novels were 2004
since the two series came out within a year of each other
it's also hard to say if Index of Zettai did the gimmick first but both Hyobu and Accelerator share || a head related injury that limits their power ||
https://pa1.narvii.com/6337/877964396e97b88b952cba470025f4e19f95bb4f_hq.gif
I mean if we are comparing Espers then the one with the biggest balls is Hyobu Kyosuke
the only reason she can't win
she can appear in any place, any time and even in people's dreams
one of her "basic" abilities is "Alibi Block" which basically works the same as Shrodringer's ability in Hellsing
> final boss appears
"Oh by the way I have 4 trillion Abnormalities"
"You see in this world people can have a supernatural ability called an 'Abnormality'"
Medaka Box had a fun power system and then trolled it by introducing the most broken character in all of fiction
isn't one of the Level 5 espers still a joke/meme because after like 20+ volumes they still haven't been revealed?
the anime ends on an anime only ending
read the manga
> A unique fire type fragment where it slows down and speeds up molecules in any object thus producing fire or flame projections or attacks. Due to it's nature it can bypass most defenses.
when you rank it up it becomes  https://needless.fandom.com/wiki/Agnis_Schiwattas
Uiharu got like... one of the crappiest powers ever
also
is because the bullet is fired with such force, the friction of it IGNITES THE AIR
the reason why we see so much fire during a railgun shooting
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2QqOvFMG_A
coin*
no that bullet should pierce MULTIPLE CARS
"at most"
I guess you could handwave it by saying her esper power packs some kinetic force along with electromagnetic
yeah it should pierce right through
um yeah the point is the acceleration
why?
to the point he doesnt have pigmentation because of lack of UV light hitting his skin
he used his ability subconciously all his life
at least it makes sense
where Touma just beats the crap out of him because Accelerator without his powers is a noodle-armed weakling since he never really fights physically
although one of the funniest moments is still early on, the first fight between Touma and Accelerator
but yeah I know what you mean, the series isnt ABOUT fighting each other constantly
not all of them, but a lot
Accelerator but he's now obnoxious, always hungry and bullies Touma in his own home for food
He can't replicate dark matter or fine mind control
Kind of weird he rarely uses his power to mimic a railgun effect by accelerating a tiny piece of rock or metal to supersonic speeds
But nobody thinks of just shooting Touma
The only thing It can't stop is a regular bullet to the face
His hand also doesn't get burned even though the coin should be searing hot
Meaning Misakas power somehow affected inertia
Even though imagine breaker should only cancel supernatural stuff it seems to cancel the inertia of the coin
Touma.can grab the coin as if its nothing
Keep in mind
For me it's kinda weird cos for example I don't care about Kirino at all, but in the game I use her a lot since she's one of the only healers
All the story is in the events
Myeah the story is non existant
I found it more engaging than the Symphogear game in terms of gameplay choices
Ah
Swimsuit Kirino?
Since all the stuff is from the same publisher so there wouldn't be issues with licensing
I wouldn't mind if they took the idea of Crossing Void and just made an anime out of it
Theres also an idol move where its implied their singing is so bad it hurts?
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=j9afOTl1HFY
Accelerator + Touma is hilarious
In the Crossing Void game she gets a Cross Move with Izaya of all people
only her power sucks, it's like "Congratulations you win a prize! Your prize is.... one dollar"
she's nice as a character
and her ability is just crazy || "The End" which allows her to instantly copy and MASTER any ability OR skill as long as she sees it just once ||
and was on the way to become a broken human herself if she hadn't met a good friend early in childhood
she's so perfect she accidentally drove several adults into super depression
Medaka was designed to be a deconstruction of the Mary Sue
to be fair, the main character is also broken on purpose
and thus can't win against "the narrative causality"
is because she's aware she's a character in a manga and not the main character
It's pretty funny
so I've read the currently translated chapters of the manga "The Other World Doesn't Stand A Chance Against The Power Of Instant Death"
Light Novel changed a lot of things it seems
I've only read the Web Novel so there's some new things in episode 1 already for me
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eciJ-ercyPU
Nah it's still pretty bad.  Almost every plot element they introduce goes nowhere or isn't brought up later.
transformation sequene has a butt shot but it's also all done in crappy CGI...
also cheap as heck CGI
but its basically like someone watched ep1 of Symphogear and made a show based on it but removed all the singing, charm and voice talent
I thought Soukou Musume Senki would tickle my Symphogear itch
but that's not a Kappa going into someone's anus
Sigrdrifa ain't too bad
gonna give "Senyoku no Sigrdrifa" a try
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt7FaeATIJg
interesting dance
so outside of Symphogear, you guys got any favorite transformation sequence?
quality on the first video was realllly bad
compared to this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TDgJeKd7ks  which is short as hell but has so much spectacle put into it, for such an old series
its just a lot of models rotating
but its nothing spectacular to look at
their transformation sequence is super long
like
I like mecha musume but this one just feels cheap
Btw the opening for Slow Ahead is Javelin yelling "Azure Lane" just like when you log into the game
It has some nice moments but the story was a mess
Also produced by the game devs
This show is Azure Lane "Slow Ahead" its a slice of life show, 8 min per ep

I feel ya Ayanami, I feel ya...
yes
especially if it's a good/popular video
I don't understand people deleting their old videos
It's not directly shown but it's definitely implied
<@285794457033506816> speaking of Spider. I'm chuckling to myself because the people on the anime Discord are || all calling Kumoko "Wakaba" || hehe...

The premise is kinda silly but also interesting
There's a "world" (lets call it country) that's surrounded by a huge wall
and they dont believe anything exists beyond the wall

Periodically a droppod/capsule will land in their world and will usually have resources, the most sought after resource being "Bind Warpers" which are bracelets that let you manifest a mecha around yourself, based on your conviction

One day the MC falls in one of those drop pods and has amnesia
also normally when your mecha gets destroyed in battle, you die too
But for some reason when the MC beats people, only their bind warpers break
as for a TLDR on what it is
it has a very 90's anime feel to it, so a lot of people dislike it and rated it low on MAL
it's by the same director who did Gun x Sword and SCRYED
Back Arrow is surprisingly a good show
and the people under him are still alive, they are || failed princess and princesses who weren't worthy of the throne of the empire that guy is from. Normally they'd be killed off but he lets them live. ||
he is so powerful, he has to keep himself occupied with hedonism and sloth so he doesn't get too serious
The most powerful man in Back Arrow
https://i.imgur.com/1bczlVu.png ABSOLUTE UNIT
ah man I remember reading Samurai Deeper Kyo
There's some pretty good anime on that list
monsters at 62
I mean the manga of that is fine but the anime cut out a lot of stuff and ended on a cliffhanger
Elfen Lied xD
things get a bit more complicated later on and there's an ongoing mystery of why this whole country is walled-in and what the true nature of the mecha are that they can manifest
this is somewhat a summary of ep1
it's even better when you realize how much foreshadowing it had.
I'm just waiting for the BIG REVEAL in Kumoko and to see people's WTF reactions to it.

I have her in the game Crossing Void and Battlecats
and only the MC genderbends
but yeah Twintails is mostly a parody of super sentai
2008
> One day, ordinary junior high-schooler Shirahime Kanata is forced by his mother, Konata to sign a contract that transforms him into a "magic girl" in times of trouble. As a magical girl herself, Konata wants to pass her job onto her son so he can protect the peace while she goes on vacation. Unfortunately for Kanata, canceling the contract means he'll permanently change into a girl, so now he's stuck doing an embarrassing job. Along with the help of his supervisor, a perverted cat named Moel, Kanata will fight against the "Noise," magical enemies who try to disturb the peace.. all while wearing a cute skirt!
https://myanimelist.net/manga/8016/Oto_x_Maho
There's also this
It's a really silly and cute manga
I mean if you want femboys... https://myanimelist.net/manga/115631/Bokura_wa_Mahou_Shounen
https://myanimelist.net/anime/24705/Ore_Twintail_ni_Narimasu

It's a parody of both super sentai and magical girls. Pretty funny. Has a character that's basically exactly the same as Darkness too...
Maou sama has the potential to be a great show if they threw out all the ecchi garbage. 

Like just make it a story about a guy pretending to be a great demon lord because he's so socially awkward he can't talk in any other way... and it would be funny enough.

But the constant ecchi elements and sexualization of young girls makes it trash tier.
Should have just made it a stand alone new series
