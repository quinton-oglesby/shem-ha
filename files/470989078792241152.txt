That's what we've been working off of: the chance he'll peep
But what on the possibility he scrolls up
There's a difference between being polite and altering every conversation
But we're bending our backs for one guy
Cause black boxes in symphogear discussion is actually the worst
A channel for people who haven't completed the series but wanna talk about the show?
There were a lot of ellipses
:0
Hebiki
Yeah..
Searching for a job with covid...
Oh so school is over by then
What about your living situation now? Do you have a bud who's got spare space?
Oh
What about your parents?
Especially, since you're not sure you want the relationship
Ok last question, are you sure you want to pursue a relationship with her?
<@!302063351767498752>  If you're cool with it, can you answer these for me?
How old are you?
When was your last relationship?
How long have you two known each other?
Are you accepting of open relationships?
Sending hearts in messages is literally playful
By really affectionate, you mean like playful flirting?
I would argue if I was being a dick, but yeah not gonna push it this time
I find this a situation that requires a good, harsh wakeup call
üìù
You're not entitled to her affections nor does she need to like you
Cause you keep sitting on your bumass crying rather than doing anything
At this point, I'd rather she find more interest in your friend
Wow, so self-conscious
Yeah
so just get it over with
I'd rather be heartbroken than anxious
A relationship doesn't need to start out serious
If you like a girl, then say it
Good atmosphere means shit
There's no such thing as the right time
Unless you actually do anything, she's still free to fuck around
Yeah..
Where are you from?
What culture?
I'm just trying to understand that you are uncomfortable about gay people due to fictional depictions of them in fan media
Kaeya and Diluc aren't related
It's 45 victims crushed under the feet of other people
I just feel sick thinking about it
That's awful
If your sexual activities exist outside of just those, then there's a fundamental problem with the person not the work
There are age ratings aren't there?
Yeah
But in the vacuum of like sexual fantasies, I can't see the harm
Like, no one is endorsing real rape or mindbreak
Yeah, it's only because it's fiction that fucked-up fetish can be displayed
<:HibikiThink:688429715362414641>
That's a totally fair and good way of thinking
But the positive light sure
I wouldn't say encouraged
I'll just give my last two cents: even if it's fucked up and even if I personally hate it, as long as it's in a fictional context I don't see the immediate harm
It's not even the content itself that I'm defending anymore, it's more so the existence and portrayal of unconventional fetishes
I'm building off what you've said,. Meaning the constant abuse and eventual mindbreak of the protagonist
To all
Yes
That finds its place mainly in fiction
I only see Nagatoro as romanticizing anything in a sexual context
Haven't seen GoT
I'm saying there isn't any major discussion to be had
I'm not saying it can't be analyzed
Portrayed in fiction?
That it exists in a sexual context?
What would it say on bullying
<:HibikiThink:688429715362414641>
Nagatoro can be analyzed in what greater context
No one is saying that the discourse doesn't exist
So how are unconventional fetishes altering the way we interact with society as a wnole
That doesn't change the discussion at hand Armis
But it can exist, despite my feelings
I don't endorse it at all
Loli is gross and fucked up
There's a difference between a fictional representation and it's real-world basis
<:MikuSad:336657015961026560> mean omg
It is a scam though <:TsubasaSmug:585839805737467920>
Obviously someone who's committed their life so a subject would know it better than someone who hasn't
Yeah
Need a degree to say you're smart <:VanessaSmug:689395769199165447>
Everyone should just talk as bluntly as possble
Armis, I would never want to argue anything with you
It's just par of course for online relationships
Your feelings will always be important than hers
Cut out people who hurt you
it means 38 bangers

It's not a stretch to say there's systematic oppression that's made an almost insurmountable divide
Like, even if you see stats on black literacy increase or social mobility, it isn't anything that closes the divide
It's the unfortunate reality that minorities are in a completely disadvantageous situation
True
ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
It's more like pushing things under the rug rather than combating racism
Not seeing color is also a bit iffy of a statement as it kind of disregards part of a person's unique experience or makes it seem that you don't actually care about problems regarding race
scary from literally every other
Scary part is that the god part is pretty accurate
<:TsubasaNote:689554460044820608> Isn't the point of Tony Stark that he was supposed to start being less of a rich douchebag
Still, it's pretty impressive how many people seem to genuinely like the guy
So, he's proud of a technicality?
Has Elon Musk ever come off as a reasonable human being
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095> 1% is a fuckable amount of people
Like, if he's defending people you block for the purpose of entertainment, then I wouldn't describe him as lenient
There's a difference between being lenient and instigating
Huh
Why doesn't he just block them
so what would we replace it with
üìù
why should we get rid of it?

Like, I will never know nor do I want to know the reality of a school shooting but suggesting that someone can fight in such a scenario seems crazy to me
I can't imagine someone making a school shooter movie and including an aspect that turns it into an action flick
That trailer...
There's an obvious problem there, but no much to do other than criticize after the fact
Like, my school used a book for religion that was pretty homophobic (and thankfully everyone has spoken out against it)
It's within their school's right to decide what is being taught
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095> Ehhhhhh
Another feminist DEMOLISHED by Japan!!!!!!!!

<:YumiStare:688429724065988721> Ok now this is just reaching for an argument
I can't tell if Cecil is pulling an incredibly elaborate troll or not
Just need to hope it doesn't trip up at the end like Gridman
Yes
"I said something more then a shonen"
"Doesn't mean its isnt going to stay a shonen"
What does this even mean
I don't even like mha but you make me wanna defend it
Imagine believing that every shounen has to reach the same level of mediocrity
Oh god firezero that opinion is so bad
But you're being crazy ova here!
I agree that Izuku sucks
YOU ARE SAYING FOR MHA TO NOT BE MHA
It's literally seeing izuku develop
MHA is about the school what
Then what shounen are you trying to talk about <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
I think I have yuuki yunna a 6 or something
No one wants to talk about mid slayer or mid hero academia ig

God I love the power of friendship
Magical girls are born to best the shit out of each other and monsters üôè
But my description fits most magical girl mcs
I like saying that Hibiki is a shounen protag in a magical girls show
Let's fix our terms here then:
Shounen manga- any that fall in the demographic
Shounen battle manga (or just battle manga) - would be stuff like mha, bc, or jjk
Cause we're dumb
Shounen is a demographic and we keep treating it like a genre
Nothing other than the way all of us keep describing it
and then i realized "wow, he's fucking dumb"
I used to watch every mother's basement video
gigguk's takes on bc... <:MariaShock:423196877354303498>
blame big youtubers!
I feel like KnY dragged
JJK is big too
Feel bad for whoever bought the manga
Demon Slayer exploded
babylonia looked nice..
fate is good without ufotable...
She hurt people
subjectively describing a subjective thought
that's a good opinion
one i agree with
no like 7.8 - 8
need to give it a rewatch
I gave it a 7 on mal, but that's like a high 7 low 8
SSSS Dynazenon is what grabs me the most since Gridman was good
but this looks kinda ass
I've never seen the first shaman king

Yeah but instead of cancelling, it doubles in strength

do i need to pick up the game
Blue Reflection Ray fucking sucked
It was really cute and a little gay
I liked what I read in the manga for Killing Slimes
Anno be like, "Lemme follow up this banger...WITH A WHOLE LOTTA BULLSHIT!"
<:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
Cause all it needs to save is 3.0
Real?
Wait do I need to spoiler tag stuff
||Kinda like how Weathering with You ends with tokyo flooded|| Weathering with you
But it shows that he's embracing his own desires
More like potentially killing the world
Imagine being punished for finally being an active part of the story
3.0 kind of shits on 2.0 ending
How can you be glad for that
idgaf if he didn't care, cause it popped off
2.0 is straight flames
Ok, but..

I didn't watch the anime, but the manga hurt me

Standouts are: Detective Club, Vivy, 86, To Your Eternity, Shitty Game, Tokyo Revengers, Slime 300, and Dynzenon
You are
And give it a shot
Just trust me
Duuuude
It's good
I read a bit of it
I can respect that
Dynazenon's MC is literally just vibing with his dick hanging out of his pants, waiting for the show to end
One of the most serious political manga of all time
Higehiro is this season's pedo show kek
Definitely worth watching :D
Slime 300 is a fun and cute comfort Isekai

<:VanessaSmug:689395769199165447>
You're nothing short of amazing
I'll look for it
I think I read somewhere that Tohsaka sees stats as gemstones
Doesn't Fate use RPG stats because that's what Shirou would understand?
Ehhh. The numbers do indicate a standing of some sort and other characters usually make sure to note that a character's may be unusually high
<:TsubasaNote:689554460044820608>
RPG stats make the world more accessible to the viewers
O
I'll say it outright: most shows provide an extent of escapism
That's fine (even if I don't entirely agree)
They're boring and generic self-insert who only exist for the viewers to see themselves in
However, what is seen as the most stagnant and uninteresting aspect of the genre are the main characters
A lot of shows utilize the fantasy setting we're accustomed to and do something new with it
Whether it's a distinct take on the premise or a new gimmick, isekai have a unique and fun variety
While we can say that a good amount of the genre falls toward certain cliche, each show does add something new
I don't think I've heard any legitimate reasons as to push people away from them
Those terms are essentially buzzwords to dissuade people from watching a show
Because, those aren't negatives in their own right
This is a disservice towards generating real conversation over a show
To see the discussion towards it devolve into calling a majority of the shows either a self-insert fantasy or pure wish fulfillment
Ok, so basically, the isekai genre is good
Normal is peak blue and yellow
Blue is peak yellow
I remember in Medaka Box where a character just uses a stupid amount of skills in a span of like three pages
Based skills
<:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
He's obviously at an advantage
Kirito beta-tested the game
Kirito is high level AND he also has dual-wield skill

It's best used in conjunction
Stats: the numerical values such as level
Skills: the abilities a character has learned
Couldn't find it <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
He's right <:VanessaSmug:689395769199165447>
It's too pessimistic and disregards the actual work
<:MikuSad:336657015961026560> I don't like this real life look of isekai
Ok, so while we are saying what it isn't. What are we defining isekai as
Would isekai be unlike their own or *our* own world?
ü§î
Unlike his own?
ü§î Does the main character go to another world
Yessir
ReCreators isn't isekai
I don't know what genre would dictate my existence
<:HibikiThink:688429715362414641>
Isekai is the fun genre <:VanessaSmug:689395769199165447>
~~Waifus~~ Side characters are plot
I feel like the MC's power is more of a device to have leeway for everything else

BRR was an easy drop after watching the first episode
And the actual mystery and the introduction of the antagonist is fucking weird and in the show (without my priority) is explained out of nowhere because it needed to be slightly conclusive
Like I can't find myself giving a fuck about Momoe because she feels like a side character with a one off episode rather than an integral part of the main 4
The mystery and development of the girls definitely needed more time
<:ElfneinSmug:688236836891656246> yeah I agree
10 was just another episode
Agree with 7
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
10 was..?
7 was Rikka?
Which one was 7 and 10?
Animation and directing honestly carried it
The show peaked incredibly early, only for it to go lower and lower down
It's like
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
Overrated show gets bad ending?
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095> can't even remember anything other than Rikka and Ai even if I wanted to
