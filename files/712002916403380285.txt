Here's another pic since you guys loved talking about her
We'll never get to see one of the most badass Jedi of all time again.
I really gotta finish Seven one of these days. Takes a while for the show to pick up and listening to Planet Dance for the hundred time isn't helping.
Another day, another episode of Ranma to watch.
Just started rewatching Stardust Memory. Remember seeing back when it aired on Adult Swim. Clearly Chuck got the best girl from this show.
You forgot about Tequila Gundam.
G Gundam was the first SR for me. Some of the Gundam designs were hilarious.
Beautiful
No doubt he would tell them to read a real book.
Told my friend to watch Bubblegum Crisis tonight. And all it took was this. 
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=an_0IIRDlc4&t=56s
For real. Viz even published the manga back in 87, but they just suddenly dropped it.
Watching the Area 88 OVA. First heard about this series when I found out it was based on the game UN Squadron. Like how they got the 2004 cast of the anime to do the OVA. Shame it doesn't reach to the manga ending.
Seeing a ton of great stuff here.
Fine taste.
I thought the music was good and that's it.
Both are bad.
I mean it's SEED.
Wow. I don't know what to say. <:TsubasaPeek:623246193002151938>
Is that Kira? <:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
Now this is a surprise. It's actually pretty entertaining.
Nice.
Finally continuing Yashahime. Last episode I stopped was on 3.
Someone I know told me all of the episodes is on YT.
https://m.youtube.com/user/BMStrikerX14/videos
Watching Metal Armor Dragonar. Been meaning to watch this for quite some time now.
Nice.
I never get tired watching this 
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=qt9aXIMyFao
We did get || MS-06MS Barbus ||
Just finished watching the Dragon Quest movie. SE made some "interesting" choices to it. I guess that's why it's called "Your story."

Sees the author of Orphen. Now I'm intrigued.
Sounds like a good deal
Usando Google translate para hablar en Español. <:HibikiSmug:672655850518609940>
Finally getting back into watching Dumbbell Nan Kilo Moteru
Hey you. Have you seen this man?
SCHOOL Of THE UNDEFEATED OF THE EAST
Almost everyone got a happy ending at least.
If you wanna something happy and manly we got G Gundam.
Chocolate man did nothing wrong.
Was about to say the exact same thing. <:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
Not to mention this is nothing from what I witnessed before. <:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
I've seen hentai with better animation. <:KanadeSmug:688191203178840064>
Also funny how the LN is selling so well.
It's giving me a good laugh so far. <:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
Watching Redo of Healer. Read a good amount of the WN some time ago. So why not watch this trainwreck of a series.
If only Bamco can work on their game quality. <:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
That's not Kyonyuu Fantasy. <:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
You got the director who did Bible Black for one thing. <:HibikiSmug:672655850518609940>
Never mind about Queen's Blade. Saving that for tomorrow. Gonna watch Slam Dunk instead.
One more episode of Healer and it's off to watching some Queen's Blade
Then watch War in the Pocket
Dodge a bullet
Reminds me how Kamille's fate was a lot more tragic in the novel.
Tomino just can't get what he wants from Bandai/Sunrise.
<:HibikiSmug:672655850518609940>
Still remember this.
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=B9LQhyBYSeg
A bit curious on reading Gundam: Char's Deleted Affair
Interesting.
<:HibikiSmug:672655850518609940>
Some though.
Not to mention Alicesoft is one of the few nukige developers to have fun gameplay in their games.
I'm just continuing with Ranma.
Alicesoft knows how to make good music. 
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=vAugvvnprMg
Only 2.
Alicesoft's baby
Gahahaha. My hyper weapon will pierce the heavens! <:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
Think I'll watch Shoujo Kakumei Utena today.
I know about those. Was just surprised.
Didn't know Stitch was that popular.
Patiently waits for more To Love Ru. <:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
Right. I forgot Studio Xebec got bought by them.
Who knew there was another ways to deal with things besides dueling?
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=1i67at-MQnI
Later NERDS
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Akj_YtusxHE&t=26s
Irony is that 4kids knew how to make good music when it counted.
Or the game. <:HibikiSmug:672655850518609940>
Just 2 more seasons left of Ranma. The ride is almost over. <:ShirabeWeep:701475635025019000>
Can't believe this was a thing.
Forgot today is her birthday.
I see Big O. <:HibikiWow:738172615453048912>
Seeing a bit of it so far kinda reminded me why I forgot all about it in the first place. Wonder if this might be Leiji Matsumoto weakest series?
Decided to watch Gun Frontier. Remember seeing it way back when and I actually forgot to finish it. <:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
Remembering bad times from that SD Gundam Force show. <:YumiPanic:688429717174354012>
SD
Finger slipped. <:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
Yeah. <:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
At least Flay pooped his cherry
<:HibikiSmug:672655850518609940>
Rewatching Tenchi Muyo. Miss watching this. Still one of the best harem series.
Had to checked my calendar that it wasn't April 1st again.
I'll watch it in English ONLY if we get the OG cast back.
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=kXSkThtywIE
G Gundam movie next? <:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
Same here. Heard Char and Amuro moments were more intense. <:KanadeSmug:688191203178840064>
But I like believing the sign of Zeta?
That smile though.
Nothing like watching some Orphen on a Friday night. Can't believe this, Slayers and Record of Lodoss War started Japan's huge boner on the fantasy genre. <:VanessaSmug:689395769199165447>
Finally took the time to watch the 2nd season of How Not to Summon a Demon Lord. I still need to watch SSSS. Dynazenon, Nagatoro, Zombieland, and Mini Dragon for today.
Orphen and Slayers were the good shit growing up. <:VanessaSmug:689395769199165447> 
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=8vIux5EO7ck
Finished season 1 of Orphen, time for season 2. Music never disappoints. <:MariaSunglasses:336656798687690752> 
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=dWJ3qU4kx5Y
Love girls with tan lines. <:NoiseTea:688192213762572295>
Yep. Good shit. <:KanadeSmug:688191203178840064>
That's sus. <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
First episode of Nagatoro was pretty decent.
Why must you remind me? <:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
Oh shit, they're doing a Star Ocean 2 adaptation? Wonder which ending they'll pick? Love to see it do well so we can get more games, but Tri-Ace sucks now. <:MikuWorry:672908523495227432>
<:ChrisPray:672578403156885504>
Can't get enough of Ohoho Ojou-sama.
I see Dragonar. <:VanessaSmug:689395769199165447>
Bittersweet.

Started in 89.
<:ChrisPray:672578403156885504>
Death by snu snu. <:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
Just finished watching season 2 of Fire Force. And it did not disappoint me with more Maki. <:VanessaSmug:689395769199165447>
You should hear the sound department.
Can't steal from Char's lolis. <:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
He wanted a dumbass bitch. <:KanadeSmug:688191203178840064>
Did someone called for burger boy? <:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
G Gundam? <:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
Same reason why space Jesus won't die after getting nuked. <:KanadeSmug:688191203178840064>

She just wanted to make sure. <:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
He's just being a tsundere with her. <:KanadeSmug:688191203178840064>
Good old memories with Heero ripping off Relena's invitation and telling her he'll kill her.
Do I see Wing? <:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=h9aHYx4b8D4
Gundam, let's do it. Mission accepted, Gundam fight ready? GO. Street mode was awesome.
Battle Assault 1 & 2 was the shit.
<:HibikiSmug:672655850518609940>
Best Gundam coming through.
I just love how rightfully corny the dub was for G Gundam. <:MariaSunglasses:336656798687690752>
Definitely a Char clone.
Need to get around watching the rest of Urusei Tatsura soon. <:ChrisPray:672578403156885504>
That beach episode. <:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
What a way to ruin my day. <:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
Funny how my first exposure was watching that CM with Kenny Omega. <:KanadeSmug:688191203178840064> 
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=oodrZXofVX8
Does it have jealousy? <:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
If I get a do over in life and saw Macross Plus again for the first time, then I'd definitely become a pilot. <:MariaSunglasses:336656798687690752>
More sales = more lewds. <:VanessaSmug:689395769199165447>
Funny how the mangaka for Pedal was the same dude who made the hot thick girls in SRW Omega.
True that. <:NoiseTea:688192213762572295>
Watching Slam Dunk. Need to get ready for the movie that's coming.
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=iW4atnm_5h0
I also love how you can easily tell that Yusuke Murata's art gradually evolves in Eyeshield 21.
Ya-ha
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=sKBNCCViP-U
And we all know who is the best character.
It's also badass and manly that Ryo and Kenshiro have the same seiyuu.

He also recently did that a VN game with Nintendo and KT.
Damn straight
Babies.
|| rune ga pikatto hikattara wow wowwow ||
Gorilla girl was the obvious winner. <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Hope he gets well. Anime was fun to watch. That reminds that I should read the LN soon since I remember bookmarking it a few months back.
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=fPafFmn0t9E
Still funny how some of the Ranma cast made it into Inuyasha
<:TsubasaYareYare:407397617451139073>
Done watching season 2 of HnK, and this shit still gets to me. 
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=vPi6ip2iIgk
Yuusei's duels are boring as fuck
Chilling out with the crew in the schoolyard
Yes, I love the AI sending out Ultamite Dragon on the 1st turn
<@279341087494242304>
I suppose no one here remembers Duel Masters
So how accurate is this? <:KanadeSmug:688191203178840064> 
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=i1pNj8ih4PM

Took down a mobile doll with a Leo
It was a nice change of pace with the amount of ass shots he got. <:KanadeSmug:688191203178840064>
Keeps threatening but never does it so what's the point
 Just be glad Bandai decided not to animate Frozen Tear Drop
Tell her if she seen this girl. <:KanadeSmug:688191203178840064>
I turn my brain off
Thanks to Wing and G Gundam became a hit in the West
Based Obari for the animation and delicious Mai fanservice. Oops posted the sub

Heero's EN voice actor is the same dude who voiced Terry from the Fatal Fury OVAs
Heero being a tsundere. <:VanessaSmug:689395769199165447>
SATURDAY NIGHT Tier
Never forget how he went
Where you guys rank Isamu and Guld?
Actually had a brain
Hamburger boy did good for a grunt
Requirement to be good: Beat a Zaku with a Ball like Shiro
Glass cannon
Yeah, I remember seeing threads about it a few times and got curious about it but if you guys haven't heard of it then some anon with shit on his mouth
Alright just BS crap like usually. Heard she's pretty hated though
Saw it once on mecha (4chan). Supposedly he had a thing for her
By the way, is it true that Arihiro Hase (voice of Hikaru) killed himself because of Mari Iijima?
Can't say that's good or bad.
And Aisha from Outlaw Star

Told a friend of mine how different the 2 are and Shirow is just a perv and his mind was  never the same. <:VanessaSmug:689395769199165447>
Manga still worth a read just for the differences between the 2
Plus || Major wasn't a lesbian in the manga ||
Became 2 deep 4 u, while Shirow just wanted to draw funny shit and porn. <:HibikiSmug:672655850518609940>
One of Masamune Shirow's earlier works 
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=jlb-AWMn7FM
|| Also, the Mangaka is a huge perv ||
Read it and find out. <:VanessaSmug:689395769199165447>
|| Manga and anime are nothing alike. ||
Good shit. I wonder how many people have read the manga? <:HibikiSmug:672655850518609940>
Lacus will have no problem taking 20 of them.
What the fuck did I just read?
Think it was on the special anime block that the Starz channel had. I also remember Tekkaman Blade 2, Akira, Macross Plus, Macross ll, Gunsmith Cats, Tokyo Babylon, X, etc
Same. Watched it way back as a kid
Allenby is fit, Rain is more thicc <:KanadeSmug:688191203178840064>
Skintights, leotards, Sailor Moon. Those were the days. <:VanessaSmug:689395769199165447>
Kazuma desu
No lie, this was hot. Funny how this past Cartoon Network.
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=T6Yuz2nnNmE
Can't be the only one who saw this.

Someone knows what they want
<:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
So I take it more Fate Illya then?
Gender bender
<@87512939107450880> Series is amazing. You should definitely play it
For real. Satoshi used all the budget for one of the best OVAs of all time.
What a man. <:VanessaSmug:689395769199165447>
Also shoutout to Satoshi Urushihara. Fucking legend
Yep. Easily one of my favorites from the nukige side.
Obari just loves a good hentai <:TsubasaSmug:585839805737467920>
Love Kouchuu and her seiyuu are max nut tier. <:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
The funny part is that MG are own by the same company that owns Baseson. <:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
Cheap bastard MG for not translating the rest.
One of my favorite harem VN series.  <:VanessaSmug:689395769199165447>
Thankfully we can go with Satoshi's art on the remakes
Also Growlanser
Nice. 
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=1MwQQfnB698
The power in the armor. Holy shit that takes me back.
We got the coolest dudes: Freddie and Mechazawa voiced by Norio Wakamoto. <:MariaSunglasses:336656798687690752>
Nothing beats a relaxing Sunday while watching Cromartie High School.
Suikoden ll would be interesting
I would like Lunar <:TsubasaDere:768545990495961129>
That's daddy's girl
All the ones that my pals have never heard of <:KanadeSmug:688191203178840064>
Watching Kimagure
Fuck you, Disney
Can I get my man Kyle Katarn as cameo since this is not canon
Pretty sure the remake ruined that. Which is why I said he saved it.

Compared to Satoshi's
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
Same bastard who ruined Langrisser before Satoshi saved it with his beautiful artstyle
Don't play the remake
<:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
Even in the SF2 movie she got that hot shower scene before Vega shows up
Because Chun Li is pure sex <:TsubasaDere:768545990495961129>
Buy it. Dude rarely makes art anymore. Think last I heard of was he going blind. Which I hope isn't true.
I think I remember seeing one of his books at Anime Expo but I didn't had enough money to buy one. Also wanted some Taimanin books as well
I would be scared to touch it without gloves
That's awesome.
My man. <:TsubasaSmug:585839805737467920>
Just love how he's the only one who make porn out of his own games. <:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
For real.
Satoshi, please make another episode of Lady Innocent already. <:ShirabeWeep:701475635025019000>

And I was just thinking when was the last time one of Nintendo's IP got an anime adaptation
Finally took the time to watch it. 
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=jtL-Iw1B7Bs
Watching some Yugioh GX. Say what you want about 4Kids, but they made a goldmine with the dub.
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=iKYafptkcb0
Someone here actually watched City Hunter
Frozen Teardrop anime when? Can't wait for the shitfest on that
Is this the only time that a Garma clone got one over a Char?
Poor Space Guts.
IBO was weird. I actually stopped watching towards the end of the 2nd season.
|| That headshot with Char was pretty impressive though. ||
Obviously staring with Victory Gundam
Leave it to Type-Moon and Nasu finding creative ways to make bank.
Finished watching the first season of Saiyuki. Longest show this month with 50 episodes.
Probably the only good thing that shit game did right.
The bitch from Shield Hero got out lucky compared to her WN counterpart. <:KanadeSmug:688191203178840064>
Switch saving the day. Not to mention the changes Nasu made
Takeuchi wants everyone to know Saberface
Yes
No PC version because you need a big screen TV
Nasu is too proud to get his shit translated to English
You'll get a FSN remake first
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=qWrKFEdWlFM
Bit of a VN with musou gameplay
Imagine being Sony/Aniplex and paying 2 seasons and a video game for Asterisk. <:HibikiSmug:672655850518609940>
Watching Taimadou Gakuen. So far the show is alright. Think it was one of the last battle harems before isekai took over. Will give it credit for the nice OP song. 
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=qPej1BR6LiI
Tons of old cartoons were done by Japanese studios
To make it up, we got more moments of Yamcha embarrassing himself
Toriyama will never remember Launch
So I decided to randomly watch this mahou shoujo anime this weekend. Not sure what I'm in for but I suppose that's the fun on finding out.
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=hpB0iNLJmOI
Someone did a monkey paw on Muv Luv for Tsukihime
Which perfectly explains why Nasu can't write 18+ scenes worth a shit
Probably wouldn't be worth the fat cow it is now
To think it all started because someone wanted to make a bishonen game but got rejected from a close friend.
Needed more Yuu Asakawa though
Also funny that Saber (yes that saber) was doing hot voice work. <:TsubasaSmug:585839805737467920>
Dude, it's him. We got that and a Char
A funny harem isekai I want to see an anime adaptation of is Shinju no Nectar. || The same mangaka of Seikon no Qwaser ||
I'd vouch for pretty entertaining
Yes
It's a manga cover. <:TsubasaDere:768545990495961129>
I knew something was missing in Qwaser
That was refreshing
I'm thirsty now.
<:VanessaSmug:689395769199165447>
FLYING IN THE SKY
Who wants a shota saber?
It amazes me how he can draw one face
There's never enough
I think you confused Okita with Waver
Source of their power now
You're dealing with alternate versions
You'll get it right after my Illya route
Yeah, so he can try to write a lot of shit that makes sense now.
I bet not even Nasu can make a proper order for the series
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Time to watch some ecchi anime.
Shame that season 2 of Medabots sucked
I think Trigun too
Outlaw Star was part of the afternoon lineup
That was Inuyasha and Big O soon after
If I remember the airing time right
It was the middle child between Sailor Moon and DBZ.
I could hardly find anyone to talk about it back then. Everyone was busy with Yugioh, DBZ, Yu Yu Hakusho, Rurouni Kenshin, Sailor Moon, Pokemon, etc. I do remember my bro went out of his way to buy the anime soundtrack
Nah. It went under nearly everyones noses. I would be surprised if they even heard of it
I said all the ones that Love Hina created. Never said his name even once
<:KanadeSmug:688191203178840064>
Which was a good thing with all the beta ones that Love Hina created
Tenchi is Chad harem MC
Good shit. Reminds me the old days watching it right after school. <:VanessaSmug:689395769199165447>
To be fair, Atem cheated on the rematch in duelist kingdom
Imagine Yugioh having romance
I actually got bored of the manga <:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
World's End Harem is gonna be one of hell a trainwreck. <:VanessaSmug:689395769199165447>
I seriously need to buy that Zoids GCN game
My jam

https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=2JNo0bcAMzM
Yep
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=mUT6tMFTq-w
Anyone remembers this show too?
Oh shit, I was thinking Vividred Operation instead
Butt Strike
Watching Shaman King 2021
I bet Ryza
The downfall of Gohan
That's SS
Finally watching Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai. 9 years late but alright
Or how about Kiara and Medb with their || orgies ||
I got ya
|| The real winner would have been proto Arthur. At least he would have been a good parent ||
The loser gets Mordred
Get chance and luck. Fucking TK
I remember Angel Beats gave a few good laughs
Talking about early 2000s i feel old
Old as fuck
I was at the Air and Clannad group
Already on the 5th episode of Chuunibyou. I'm actually liking this show
It was before the new millennium. And Key's first game.
Mght play it this coming winter for the feels
Don't think I watch the 06 version yet. Or maybe I did but forgot all about it
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=G_heTG5370E
Yep. There's another one that was first but it's like 2 hours of play time
I find it funny it took 5 years after the anime to finally get a proper VN game
Hokuto no Ken dropped but a 10
This trash taste time
All I remember was the onee-san with big boobies dressing as a pirate
You bet your ass it is
Then why HnK a 10? Too manly to score any lower
Love how you have One Piece paused at 67 episodes
Berserk 2 an 8
So where are the H-OVAs?
I judge everything
Haven't updated. But I saw it
Couldn't remember my password
Behold my shit taste 
https://myanimelist.net/animelist/Demi-raidou
Same
Got MAL account
It's a bit better if anything
Good genes
I still look like a high schooler
And I thought the huge boner was all for Europe
Anime in Mexico. That's very rare
Brock too
Dub was the old Pokemon cast
Needs more Megumi Hayashibara
I need my oujo-samas
Claire was wasted on that series
Time to watch Saint Seiya
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=PAruaQmSxpo

Be it male or female
Japan is actually full of horny bastards. Who would have guessed
Yep. We also saw Shibuya Kaho
I actually met the artist in AX
Best hentai harem MC is Lute from Kyonyuu Fantasy <:VanessaSmug:689395769199165447>
Where's my Chocolate bunny girl <:TsubasaDere:768545990495961129>
Chisato and Zest
The material easily could have been a H-OVA
Shimai girls are pure || Pure sluts || Going by the LN of course
More junk in the trunk
Which battle harem has the best girl cast?
Leave it to me
Rakudai is not a harem <:VanessaSmug:689395769199165447>
Sweet Arms made good OPs
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=hGBqTimAMSg
Hell, think the series I watched completely was Shimai
I almost finished World Break but couldn't get through another episode of Absolute Duo
Best isekai is Slayers and Orphen
It's a free real estate
I remember that and the Mermaid harem anime
I'm just saying it was a time when harem shows was popping it. I still remember watching To Love Ru back in middle school days
That takes me back with Ichiban. I think that was when the harem genre was starting to flourish
I know. Doesn't mean the MC was a nice change of pace. Finally, martial arts dude
Hagure Yuusha was fun to watch. Same dude who created Shimai
Poor studio Arms. <:ShirabeWeep:701475635025019000>
Starting my journey of watching LOTGH
So...femboy would have been better?
Date boys unless is a trap. <:KanadeSmug:688191203178840064>
Finished watching the yakuza house husband anime
Was that Strike Frontier? I remember being a 18+ game
Would play a proper Switch version of AT
She has one of the best asses in the series <:VanessaSmug:689395769199165447>
Built for paizuri
I guess Rinko?
I know. But the Sailor Moon nukige definitely takes the cake.
|| For an nukige <:TsubasaDere:768545990495961129> ||
This was the best
TFW you're reminded there's an || hot VN Sailor Moon || <:TsubasaSmug:585839805737467920>
Remember this

Anyone want some twizzlers?
Shows idols is nice and happy, it actually sucks in real life
Holy shit, Amuro can fucking sing. Sucks he can't be Seiya anymore
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=hlLku5oOjw4
Reminds me the shit that happened with High School DxD Born
Yuya plays Berserker Soul
Or better yet Yoshii Dan from Symphogear. If you know his past works <:VanessaSmug:689395769199165447>
Should see Watanabe Akio (artist for Monogatari) then. Minds would be blown, that's for sure
I mean the mangaka for Illya isn't afraid to show what he likes
Watching Violet Evergarden
Damn, and I just watched Golgo 13 Queen Bee.
Yep. Only if the Emus had teamed up with the Kangaroos to overtake them
Reminder that Australia lost to birds
Got a new show to watch after Ashita no Joe

Watching Hajime no Ippo
Almost done watching BNA, just 3 more episodes left
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
Name 5
I remember a bit from the movie
Manga as well
Only Kaiba can have a monster that created the forbidden list
Any new duels can give me this level of satisfaction 
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=B0PmLQHspvk
Make an arc about the cult, turns out her old VA is actually in one
And yet Jack Atlas has a harem
Jaden = dueling 
Yusei = bike
Alexis and Akiza can't beat dueling and motorcycles
You're barely making it with GX and 5Ds.
Imagine wanting to be an idol
Should have said no Sunrise. To make it harder
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I see nothing out of the ordinary
Now I'm watching High Score Girl
Got done watching BNA and watching Cells at Work now
There was actually this one Netorase eroge series that's actually pretty good.
The cucking is okay
There's Netorare, Reverse NTR, Netorase, and Netori
Just look up netori
Maybe it's telling you to look up NTR <:KanadeSmug:688191203178840064>
Because you actually looked for it while scrolling up. Here's something to make you feel better 
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=woJpH7IlIXA
NTR Chads keep on winning
Just needs his D energy to be bigger than the ugly bastard
Her videos was pretty hilarious. Honestly, Gigguk got lucky
TFW remember that Gigguk's girl is into NTR and ugly bastards. <:KanadeLewd:690470896174891008>
Tan dude
Bro is doing to protect his bro from thots

It's actually real
NTR isekai when
With Interspecies actually being fun to watch
That is if the material is too lewd to begin with
Should have made it into a OVA series

NP5 bond 10 let's go

https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=8bCwBTp9e_M
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
No wait, it was Star Fox Zero
Last anime was Kid Icarus
Maybe they'll give Kingdom Hearts an anime. <:KanadeSmug:688191203178840064>
You'll never know with the mouse
Disney will buy or fund their own anime studio
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=6qz7fgHh96Y
More Megumi Hayashibara
|| That electric chair scene <:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874> ||
I mean Freezing kinda counts but whatever
Never heard of them. Unknown as fuck as Nazca in Malcom in the Middle
It's Ghost Stories
Poor bastards had to start from scratch.
English OP pretty much gave it away. "As soon as someone finds the script we might begin the show."
My bro was watching Samurai Pizza Cats the other day. <:VanessaSmug:689395769199165447>
https://vndb.org/s820
https://anidb.net/creator/20490
Yep.
Thought it was funny that the mangaka for Akame is the same dude who gave us this. <:KanadeSmug:688191203178840064>
Would make more sense for D3
Try 5 0r 6 years old
Imagine watching Akira, Blood the Last Vampire, Ninja Scroll, Ghost in the Shell, X as a kid
This cast is the best one
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=A1meE9NBTIk
Might wait for the English dub. Lupin's dub is just so good and funny
When you're so happy to see a death row inmate saved you from the boring school life
Watching Baki. Read a bit of the manga and saw the first 2 seasons
Real shit. Makes me want to work out
It got my attention with the fit waifu
New season soon
Alright for good laughs. Thankfully I'm not subscribed to them.
I also hate how Mangagamer fucked up the VN of Kuroinu. We got the worst version of the game <:ShirabeWeep:701475635025019000>
Olga and Chloe are good picks. If you want elves in vanilla situation then check out Youkoso Elf.
Funny that his only hardcore taste was Kuroinu
If only he had better taste in hentai like his girl <:KanadeSmug:688191203178840064>
Good memories
But Sharon is the OG
Real life Sharon Apple concert when <:KanadeSmug:688191203178840064>

Need more NTR
It's already so far being 3 episodes in
<@238855496797257729> You mean the conversation? Basically like this just replace darkness with NTR.
Friend talked me into watching Erased
How's the horror scale in this? We're talking about 80s OVA horror
Looks comfy
Hell yeah. || The sad part was the fighting last a few seconds || <:VanessaSmug:689395769199165447>
Some of the Gundams from G gets my vote

Angry, sad, and desperate, he calls up Kamokura's girlfriend, Sakurajima Touko, who is said to be the prettiest girl in high school. "Touko-senpai. Please have an affair with me. " But Touko said, “I can't let him fool me. I have to push my opponent to the bottom of despair. " Her plan is then to keep falling in love with him and eventually break it up by spending the night with another man..

5th episode of GTO. Why did it took so long for me to watch this
Another night of watching GTO. Pretty excited to read the manga once I'm done with the anime.
The anime and manga are 2 different versions <:KanadeSmug:688191203178840064>
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHojVhh6k40

I love how Japan makes everything gacha
Will watch the 2nd season of Sheld. I'm curious on the difference of the LN and WN
Also, the animation style is very familiar from a few OVAs<:KanadeSmug:688191203178840064>
As long as I can get a good time out of it
Because why not? <:VanessaSmug:689395769199165447>
Fuck off
Who knows how much is worth
Better grab a copy, having it scan and translate it
It was in 92 <:KanadeSmug:688191203178840064>
Hell, there was even a F-Zero novel
The sexual tension was always there <:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>

Plenty of ojisans taking care of them
Real manly shit was going on in episode 13 of Kengan
Hot

PDF links for all the series they worked on so far
Fled and took the money. Sometimes common in Japan
That one time Funimation made the better choice on the OP
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=hA0hA4i6a-U

Need my martial arts fix so I went with Kengan Ashura.
Oh shit we got Mickey Mouse fighting next
You got harem isekai now. Is that an improvement?
I remembered when battle harems were still a thing
Chad power move

Checking out the manga and just found out the mangaka is the same dude who made Dumbbell
Die monster. You don't belong in this world! Watching Castlevania. That Bloody Tears though
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=GQc92nHJtWU
Also love how giving each other concussions can lead to manly bonds. Plus Kazuo Yamishita is the best damn manager and father.
Finished watching both season of Kengan Ashura and was really entertaining to watch. Would be lying if I said the 3D animation didn't took some to getting used to in the beginning. But that aside I really liked how the fights were brutal and savage as fuck.
Classic

Someone is finally speaking my language?
I'd be down if the OVAs get in on the remake
Oh shit Urusei Yatsura is a getting a modern remake. I wonder how well it's gonna get receive in today's time
Manga is more lewd
This manga
Watching this somewhat of a romance anime called Diamond Daybreak. || But the catch is that each heroine ends up being cucked from their respective episodes. ||
It is funny it came from the same mind
Good eye on Takahiro. Same bastard who made Akame ga Kill and created one of the greatest VN series of all time
My blood is been boiling for some manly stuff. Gonna watch Golgo 13
Hoping not a downgrade with "today's standards"
That battle of Goemon against Hawk
One is erase from existence

Watching Guyver
Is this big boob hour
Remember watching it first on the sci-fi channel. Pretty suprising it had a few anime shows back then.
Popcorn movie time. There can only be one
It's a buffet today





We're gonna be old farts or rolling in our graves if the story isn't finish

Feels good watching One Piece again. Oda making real grown men shedding tears.

Episode 1015 of Kino Piece was hyped as fuck. Maximum fucking nutted. Oda and the animation staff in Toei should be proud. It's a good thing I did laundry today
Now I know what to watch next
You know what, I'm gonna have fun again watching it

No Slayers 1/10 only because of Lunar being there

Going by Japan time 3 days ago. Event is still live. Or wait 5+ years for an official English version
There's 2 version
No this is RPG. For good boys and girls


Black Lagoon is going to big places
Only time I heard of it was back at AX
Another anime to keep up with the times
More anime staring mommys
Waiting for isekai as a toilet
Forgot tomorrow is Comiket 100
https://twitter.com/ivyfriday/status/1558214009769304064?s=20&t=IrXHzeSLiflson1OWv9zqg
SCHOOL OF THE UNDEFEATED OF THE EAST

Comiket 100 looking good
Oh wait. You mean this
No I mean Princess 9.
So Japan finally made another baseball girl anime like Princess 9

Disney finally wants more of that fithy weeb money, huh
Funny how Toonami was okay with it
There was more time suiting up and looking at Domon's butt than this.
Everyone knows clowns are scary
Sad part the fight didn't even last a minute. We Mexicans can fight longer than that
Esta guey
No Deathscythe. Japan will never fix its taste
Almost read that as Bambi moment
Harada better make Paul Phoenix a good character in this one.




Hmmm
So anime is turning into this now. Need to keep up with the times
Beats fucking around with girls and making no progress

Hmmm
Because I can pretend I'm rich
Feels cool to have a whole theater to yourself
Oh well did this for fun
2 people are only seated
It's actually 3:26 pm. The afternoon
At the theater to watch Dragon Ball Super Hero
So basically animation studios that are forced to adapt shitty light novel/manga
↑←↑
Love waking at around 1:00 am and watching anime on adult swim
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=7olMM4AVj3k
Better ending song to finish the series
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=BvYuf4r-8xk
Thought it was a spin off of MHA from the looks of it
Hal from Malcom in the Middle too
Reminder it was created by the Ghost in the Shell creator

Never said that. If you read the manga of Ghost then watch the anime you would think the manga is some fan who made it


Good times
Gotta love those old subtitles
Times are tough
Damn, covers a looking like this now

I want a isekai of a T-Rex


Doing some educational reading. Nothing out of the ordinary here
Considering it was Trigger's first anime
When you're a grower, not a shower

So what's your response
Nice to see it got an anime
https://twitter.com/aninewsandfacts/status/1579593433299451904?s=46&t=XK-nSwAw4wU4sZfN16hF0A
Funny how a woman created the harem genre
The series that started boy meets girl
You'll never get a cute elf girlfriend. Fuck my life
90s anime was magical
Shadowfox



Chick looks like that one classic hentai manga I read. Maybe same artist
Is it weird after hearing this I want Gundam Basketball anime
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=k1UuEHmxG0U
Surprised they can keep doing this with Monkey Punch being dead

Kevin and Mark are Batman and Joker
Best Bstman. Salute
Ash is finally champion. Does that mean a new MC for scarlet and violet
Wish that was me. || Being there of course ||
Gigachad sigma grindset


Time for a special edition of who is the mother of Ash's daughter

When you try to eat like you're in a anime
Too hardcore for Sony's consoles?
Goblin Slayer season 2. NICE
Announcement of continuing the series.

https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=VpTDllUJLjc

Velma show looks horrible and make want to puke
