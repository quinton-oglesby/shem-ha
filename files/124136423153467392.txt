i think thats the real reason they look surprised
who cuts a cake with a serated knife?
dis?

looks more like a clay pot?
wait is that what they did with the steel cloths in omega?
^
they actualluy get in a relathionship later
they even have her sing and everything
i mean
nana is it in so for sure good
add on to s1 transformations is biki's first which i had forgot how crazy it was
no basa exploding her bike clearly fake
prob top 5 moments in strikers for me
thats a great design for a sirt!
o.0
||its literally the pose from ep 1 just with kanade in the middle 6:03 time stamp||
wfc you may want a spoiler on that last one you posted
^
id hardly call him a char clone
yea they used that to summon the uber worm
carol and the dolls were memory powered but dont recall the axz ones doing that sorta thing?
someone remind me what the axz alchemists were powered by?
man  hope not
ðŸ‡«
good point millhi totally didnt even recall that
yea ill assume mind flaying isnt gona go with the normal definition
but maria's arc for a 3rd time too!
see team rehash rehashes not just achemists
if team rehash even lasts
my moneys on maria
^
shes clearly a custodian
nah
where all the gears mechanical parts and stuff are visible and shoot from her body before pulling back and attaching
the non-sequence transformation in ep1
yea
still think the most standout transformation is biki's very first transformattion just cause of how different it is
~~guess we know how ver is gona show up this season cause he clearly knew~~
~~why would they need to posses one of their own?~~
but keeping her as a reoccuring villain would be a bad move and need way to much to make work
i can see not killing her off
almost change the message entirely
youd be rewriting more than just fine doing something like that
id just be happy to see wtf happened to all the stuff in the dragon palace since the ones on the list that was shown was all pretty spoopy stuff
think i actually like it more than all loves blazing
its pretty solid
is there a list with release dates for the cds?
for at least part of it
biki sung the same song as kanade during s1
do recall
if they attune with the relic sure
but we have yet to see her do it
maybe elf9 can
also im still doubtful that theres anyone that can actually convert a relic fragment to a gear  w/o ver/fine/nastashja around
of what we do know is some fucky stuff
with god knows what in it
they still have the flooded semi exploded dragon palace
i mean
because its a mirror too?
its not pure if its in a gear id say
s4 and s5 so far are the only seasons planned together
issue with it is prior planning
that feels like something pretty big for adam to not mention
i really doubt and hope that maria isnt "eve"
well it pretty much looks like you may get that this season
except maybe carol
cause fine screwed them over in the past previously
with fine still round the illuminati* alchemists wouldnt have done anything
the issue is
think the activation song is in an un understandable language
*kill off elf9 and replace her with carol*
adam was almost soloy out for revenge
also
*oof*
and fine did stop those
her big missles take time
and fine noped it
chris did try to blow up kadinger b4 her zesshou
oh shit right ep today
pole dancing into battle def didnt see dat coming
the gas masks bit brought up some questions
yea
prob
frankenstein
o.0 dat kiri transformation
will be pretty pissed if they try to redeem these alchemists
also
well yea this was literally a call back that nearly remade the og concert scene
have we seen that before?
yea seemed odd that they were being cut up b4 dusted
doesnt stop being crushed and drowned inside a building that just colasped into water
ogawa was escorting civis
man people worried bout the gears being ok in the collasped concert hall and im over here just wondering if ogawa made it out
was a lil odd we got a battle scene without music
got it
whitmore is the prez in independence day
oh
looked like they were just shifting stills
the art was good but the animation
yea that concert hall was dumb
the part with chris' bday present
the animation at the start seem odd to anyone else btw?
like when they showed them stuck in traffic i was confused
they should have had all the gears there
curious bout the brain helmet thing from the op shes wearing doh
kaneko knows
but she was there
granted autoscorer didnt interupt concert
or 4/6
4/5?
s1/g/gx/xv?
i feel them just watching the concert at chris' apartment wouldve felt better than having them stuck in traffic
while killing any and all witnesses
seemed odd that vamp girl was stressing who basa was like she was trying to reveal her
i think?
jii?
as soon as shit went down
that or chris rockets
yea
who cares bout some treffic
when they can get hellicopters
still think its odd they didnt get the  rest of the crew to the concert hall they were clearly in section 2s sedans
and they didnt show him being ok
dis why im worried for ma boy ogawa
jii fucked robo cat up
hard to say
maybe they weaker than normal ignite
and protecting it
they did a good job retreiving it
glad the muricans got the corpse too
but why take that risk?
i mean maybe
*a plan that made sense*
no point in keeping yourself as a known varible
remove yourself as a threat and procede with plan
she wanted to die there?
and grab prelati when shes being exploded too
oh yea
it sure as fuck is an option
if cag can gtfo while being blasted by ctf
because thats what they do if not dealing with a nuke
the alchemist that escape roped away?
but at that point it serves the same purpose
maybe they wouldve arrived when the hall was collapsing
shit went down too fast
it wouldnt have mattered
id have the gears at every concert
ehh when bad guys have been present for 5/6 concerts
wait kiri's transformation was gona be lewder originally
*ver was immortal*
2045
wait wut
https://gyazo.com/7d3308cd160a1743c63b059f3d5697dc
which seems like an ez explanation for why adam wouldnt bother considering them
it just mentions that theyre all failed experiments from different things the illuminati was working on
*actually havent even looked at keywords yet*
nah info on char bios
but not in show yet
is it a spoiler if its been mentioned on the xv website?
and that is gear blast
this is the only one iv seen?
what ya mean?
still dont like the gear blast
yea soon as they showed solo basa concert on the announcements i knew maria was gona be in
i didnt even notice the hand in the first guys chest
oh man
that?
https://i.imgur.com/3IJTimX.jpg
and she was helping
she knew they were doing that already
theres no might
*inb4 igalima isnt a destroyer of souls but actually absorbs them and kiri is actually now fine*
*thanks ver*
*oh god*
kiri is a pole dancing addict
you got super robot from jii in G
i can totally complain bout that
when its never shown up or mentions again
i mean as far as soul rending bs power goes
lil sad chris' bday wasnt shown
according to plan
vs the dolls
so they would use it
to hype ignite
that was literally the point
yes
hope they give us the full version of kiri's transformation in the bds if the 10 sec thing is true
no idea then
also didnt expect the alchemists to do as well as they did
*i might not actually be surprised if tony shows up this season cause of all the callbacks so far*
cause basa didnt join his music trope or w/e in s1
clearly its tony glazer out for revenge
*the fourth place*
maria was wrong
she did do a leg split doh
pray that bds show us
*that little girl surely was*
she gone eat dem
*oh god*
and it doesnt have to be beef
shes a vampire
wait
considering they themselves said they suck
if thats the same frontier weve seen
i mean someone clearly moved enki's body
just not at the concert
i mean noise did show up during that concert
she was in s1
its called a joke
*and fine was there*
*shes fine*
i mean
and biki wasnt there in G
they shouldve not done the concert
then her girlfriend drugged her right back in
why ya gota attack the animater like that fam?
wow
just think bout dat
it was lewder
look man
aint gona see much new people
5th season of an original anime
i mean
nothing is on fire
much like the lower gear form basa did in G
i mean armour purge isnt a original function
for a good bit
chris in s2 is dead center of camera after armour purge
i mean
hope not at least
doubt itll be elf9
*though it does make since theyd be nude*
yes especially since biki armour purge didnt go nude\
who in the show asked kiri why she so lewd in her transformation?
yes
who talked bout kirika's transformation being lewder?
theyre showing mechanical bits of the gear itself again
ya know what im most glad about doh?
theres def points where you can see what looks like spots they trimmed though
during the show off portion
we did get scythe action
i mean
so youd assume the converter wouldnt work for that
they released them w/o the story
they only want you for your sugar
meh just ignore neighbors
is what it looks like which isnt bad
and then add to it
yea like you finish a thought
but that may just be how youre typing cause i type somewhat similarly
if anything it kinda looks like you got a lil overagressive with your rebuttals  symphopoi
and one of the only instances of such in the series
yes but regardless of that its still something that is a retcon
changing what something is would also be considered a retcon
i mean retcon isnt just removing things
and not even outright
chris is the only situation i can think of that theyve done
doubtful retcons arent something they really do
*write fanfic where batgirl gets murderized if they go the redemption route in xv*
yea thats the point
so we will see how it plays out when stuff is actually planned ahead
except now
its more that each season hasnt been planned toether
dont think episodes are really the issue with gear
on the official twitter
bikis has been up for a few days on twitter
theyre already giving them to us
couldnt think what it was called
err yea dynamic lighting
oh theyre talking bout the shadows i think
jesus its gone up like 200 since i looked at it a few mins ago
whered you see someone talking bout ghosting?
*and they said it would scare people away*
hell its #13 on reddit's hot list for me
and youre top comment
also was that the FIS institue in ep 1? dont think iv seen anyone talking bout dat
on top of the new alchemists seemingly being american based
not with everything theyve pulled so far
he cant be a ww2 diehard
with our new timeline
actually
not really plausible to me
doubt miku will be the final baddy
*you mean miku*
if they are in fact gona go that route
i could see 8 being when they deal with fudou
i would really hope these alchemists would be dealt with before then so theres proper time for w/e the real main baddie is
kiri b side is solid
man all loves blazing is one of those songs i really wish they gave us the battle version of
lol
https://gyazo.com/04f0576262d9353b3cb291c490a080ad
wait there was actual ghosting in the transformation sequence?
^
villain gets away with everything cause everyone is fucking stupid all season
ya know my whole reason for hating G
have the villain actually have to think smart
cool
but like its so many different things that were wrong with the whole damn concert
like this kinda thing usually doesnt get to me
and its pretty annoying thinking bout it
like literally everything about it was wrong
tall hall hanging on towers over what looks like a bay
no real defense force cause ya know these concerts never have bad guys at them
and it wasnt a literal death trap
there were actual exits
people def escaped the s1 concert
"this is fine"
and went
who looked at the design and placement
i mean
anyone who had escaped the hall itself wouldve still been in the tower portion when the hall collappsed i would think
i wouldnt be terribly surprised if they said everyone died  with how that death trap was designed
sugita singing metanoia in reverse
also im sure youve studied plenty about depressive behavior in amnesiac orphans raised to be fighters against the world
15 year old terrorist drug addict?
no shit shes gona have some issue with that
she was gona kill her best friend for basically stupid reasons and found out the reasons didnt even exist
i mean it could be that much considering thats pretty much how unisons work
theyre really a dumb plot tool and one of the main reason i dont like any of the alchemists other than carol
it shows how much better of an alchemist carol mustve been
at least if anything
xv showing that off super nicely so far
dont even gota think bout consequences when you built yourself infinite escape ropes to nope out when you fuck up right
seeing as those drop bomb ones seemed like og alcanoise
they prob do
they had that special box that had what 3 in it didnt they?
nah
sneeze hamburger sunglasses
wtf are these new keywords btw
normal noise have to phase into existance when they are bout to hit or they would simply phase through their target
i mean revolver bullets in tits is kinda a standard trope?
i think?
gf3a hexa revolver?
still think it wouldve been better than for them to have combined gears into a super red hot blaze instead
the stupid gear blast\
~~some part of me was hoping biki would throw it instead~~
he was a custodian in the first one
well
im just glad 3rd guy survived dis time
yea i know its diff from either of those
the ep2 one is different
this isnt the same gaijin chart as last week
wait a sec
thats some pretty significant depth
it shows the extent shes willing to go for her family
i mean
what ever happened with soba man?
and showed it by responding to shit being said b4 the lights went out and the call showed up
he kinda straight was
i mean
i would have too but then again i wouldve expected them to have all the gears at the damn concert  too
is even worse
cause glitter gear gathering finest arts
so is there a better translation for what it stands for
damn close
highlight of the episode for sure
man now i need leeroy jenkins edited with biki going  "i dont understand a word youre saying" before charging in
lil dissapointed she didnt shoot the crystal with the revolver instead got it with spam shot
man half way through this thing
i dont see enki being the one that ousted fine so logically it would fall on enil (or some other non mentioned custodian popping up) so why would enil who berayed fine in the end care bout protecting what would amount to fine's country. add in that so far fudo hasnt really cared bout the people of japan themselves and more of the country itself(inb4 japan is a giant custodian/ship)
japan being the divine nation because of fine's descendents makes sense and enil possibly being the one to give her access to the reincarnation system make sense
idk its a lil farfetched of a theory and parts dont make sense currently to line up for it
and i already will hate it if it comes true
side b was solid not sure where id put it atm prob 2nd or 3rd for side bs doh
side b opening is fantastic too
jii got the top song for me so far this season for sure
meh its prob just to give uninterrupted song preview for dem cd sales doh
just seems odd to do now? really doesnt seem like keeping power output high would be the case when it wasnt in axz when they def wouldve wanted as much extra power as they could get for dealing with the faust robes
what would be the chances theyre trying to make a distinction between unison songs and solo gear songs?
ok so something i noticed and went back through the rest of the xv eps.  other than the single line from biki b4 her duo attack with maria in ep 1 the singer hasnt been talking during fights with solo songs and just found it a lil odd
but inherits fine's reincarnation thing
miku dies
wasnt heavens wrath a direct reference to one of kanade's moves?
*at least theyre all the same color*
but stands dont add to the person do they?
i dont watch jojo
these are def oversouls
nah
brb gona check
werent all 3 in the op?
chris/food?
chris/?
maria/serena
kirika/mam
jii/fine?
basa/kanade
we have what?
ver would prob end up being one
even if we getting oversouls for everyone
not tweedle dee and tweedle dum
and sg who helped fix the gears
it was sg spellcastor
makes no sense either
same
*thats a better thought than people wanting cag and prelati to be in the other gears*
impossibility*
shes gona get the bracelet if anything
and keyword confirms no one can make new gears anymore
shenshoujing is gone
and yea he isnt on the bridge
but we didnt know till he poped up the next ep
yea i know
much like the concert
he mia from the bridge
hopefully
meanwhile oversoul looks near what biki had minus glowing spirit fire
*not like cuffs will do anything to him anyway*
shes def singing softer
to me it sounds like ayahi is underperforming to match maria's va too
i didnt really care for any of the unisons especially ctf cause it doesnt sound like a chris song and didnt really feel like a maria song either
that was shown pretty clearlythis ep of xv
they cant exactly teleport shit willy nilly
i mean
it didnt help that they didnt even as much as acknowledge it
cause alchemists arent people
off alchemists just fine doh
give this whole big bs in g bout not killing people
shes not going for kills
its biki's whole char
well cause its biki
since that was something i didnt like bout the gears "killing off" the alchemists
even if i hate millarc
im very happy kiri mentioned maybe going overboard vs millarc
to that same bit
yea but we have seen her do softer songs and did fine
really didnt like how the fight during it went
id prob like the basa/jii one if i heard it by itself first
or if she had they wouldve been brought to light sooner
no way to power them all for one thing
i assumed that whole thing was a mistranslation?
wait perfect being was accurate?
oof
did they actually release all of axz now?
what you dont have dirt blood in your veins?
i mean sure
man its bad enoughw ith all the jojo bs
why is gear being compared to hero academia?
but when youre breaking it down to that point thats most anime?
even if the thing acts like it wont when i move it there
works fine on my phone too so theres that
that may have to do with having cccc installed as well?
media player works for me just fine
beeg sound
flac aint smol
think id like both of biki's if her side A had the oomph it had in the show
wasnt positive on rules for posting torrent links
catsite
think jii so far is the only one iv liked both songs so far
side B is solid doh
im actually not really liking chris'side A
just prep to deal with the coffin doesnt seem feesible to need divine power for
otherwise adam's whole goals seem silly
there has to be something more with custodians
should be ep 12 near the start i wana say
sg helped elf9 cleanse the geaars  after using fools stone with the tech used for the philo stone
much like how the gear itself slowly has been upgraded
which is why they look different each time theyve been used
we kinda do know the og trio's xdrives for sure are getting stronger each season
i mean
as an amnesiac
seeing as carol goes mia immediatly after
its not really even obvious she caught carol even though it shows it....
FZero Drive
fx drive
faustdrive
similar to ignite with extra parts
didnt really show off much more power just better utility?
kinda doubt the new form is stronger than xdrive
idk
*moons gota go*
*inb4 fine was right*
w/o someone trying to fuck with the moon
it cant be symphogear finale
and of course
yea
senpois
collegues*
wasnt it like one of their friends or something?
well that wasnt the same person
same
and then custodians
rocket shinanagens should be relevent
possible miku stuff for an ep or 2
just we still gota resolve fudou stuff which i figure is 2-3 eps
just seems like doing too much in 1 season
idk im feeling a lil worried with how much seems to be going on on top of what more could happen this season
yea
going off what the alchs were saying in ep1
nah he didnt want the bracelet it seemed
im sure adam and the alchemists couldve took it with how they already were
pretty much
and then a 2nd where instead of swords its wings with her second song when her sword arc is over this time
we would have todays where shes a sword and her gear is forming out of swords
what would be the chances they give basa 2 altered versions of her transformation
crazy thought
dat transformation doh was lit
prob obvious answer that was her B track today and we gona get the A track in a month?
so obvious question  why is basa's track gona be a full month till release since we got a transformation and song today
great ep
yea
even though it was staring us in the face last ep
and yet the bigger surprise was the autoscorers
*bring carol back to us*
she did what she was destined to do
yea
when they talked bout frontier
this one
tony was in the flashback
biki was right in ep 1!
no tyme to grow up and grope herself this time with the baddies right in front of her clearly
doubt its just a copy
its a relic
since she was stronger cause she needed more energy w/e
*here*
again
she was probably the most underpowered of the bunch
in micha's defense here too
i mean that seemed like purposeful
quite a bit to cover doh
6 eps
*dont forget the custodians*
im calling it stole her godkilling power there
kinda have a feeling there was more to it than biki being zapped there
*you mean everyone*
since smoli form
cearly she doesnt
i mean the body is carol's
otherwise we may need some Fs for elf9
in the off chance she gets in danger and turns back into carol
does elf9 carry an emergency philo stone on her
now the question is
speed force memes clearly
she clearly has just one out during that scene
like how she can with literally all her other stuff
or at least have 2 fucking revolvers
and keeps getting her in trouble
its literally there for "rule of cool"
really starting to hate this stupid revolver
*speaking of chris*
lota weak points in the first half for me that just were annoying and reminded me of G
ima still be waiting till the end
its pinned already
unless he does turn out to be a custodian
no way fudo is the main antag
chris should have had 2 gd guns out
to be fair
*cant have that happen more than once doh*
too bad we couldnt just shoot it again
yea
now to wait for gajin chart
for a sec there when micha had batgril held down i thought she was gona give her the suck to take her energy
unless she can divine power herself up a philo stone
uses up her energy beating the failures then outa juice to fight gramps
they at least have the evidence to make a move on fudo soon
for everyone to be here
ver is all thats missing now
use the energy crossbows
or ya know
good luck getting/keeping your fingers there
that spin
yes
how man barrols does a chain gun have?
so biki dont gota use gungnir
remove the curse from everyone
godmiku gona lazer the moon
obvious solution then
gg animation
for like 3 secs then vanishes when she moves
ah near the very end of the ep it does show
im not seeing it so far in ep 11
^
is that the first use?
malnutrition
the real reason she couldnt grow up
guess i just miss remembered
hmm just far beyind 100
checking
coulda swore
didnt his bio say 120?
*fudo was alive in the 80s*
^
she did live with fine for a while
i mean
again more relics dont matter
^
why theyre called the "blades of zababa"
zababa is a god the relics are parts of weps he weilded
none of them can make gears from relics
no
the rest of the relic they had was powering the copter
*when it actually was going to be god nephver*
everyone thought it was gona be god miku
ver was never shown or said to make gears
which are a shitshow to activate anyways
other than complete relics
when you cant make them into gear system
never noticed
o.0 have any of the other preview images done things before?
o.0 ||Xdrives and we not even at the end yet||
man carols song is lit doh
just the custodian bit?
which one?
i mean|| this thing straight looks like half xdrive and half aegis||
cats got subs out fam
||but anyways its striking me more as a gear with an added complete relic like durandal or the cane since the brace is still pretty much intact on her arm w/o anything else looking like its been affected||
meh only really doing it for bigger things for the first hour give people time to actually watch
why spoiler tag the txt when the image would be the bigger spoiler?
||its got ssj waveform in the transformation||
ugh.... ||they brought ssj back......||
not enough to go by to make a decent comparison
yea
she did right before blasting them
no t pose from carol?
^
and still kinda hard to say if thats stronger than xd
we still got amalgam for everyone
i mean
when its kinda only been used in 2 different group fights?
final commander weird in a group fight?
yea
wouldve figured rebuild gear xd would look different/be stronger
yea
no xd upgrades doh seemed a lil odd
*and maria*
guess we go straight to death penalty now right?
sady our relic prison is destroyed
^
not really
which would be dumb
unless amalgam bs stops relic from disintigrating
yea thats what im looking for right now lol
final commander is out right?
*losing all gears to beat final boss dont matter soon as someone learns to open babylon*
its prob not a gear to begin with
i mean kaneko didnt like ssj to begin with
but we shall see next week
which luckily enough the bracelet is
complete relics are pretty much the only thing we have in cannon that dont need conversion to use
if anything todays ep really showed that off
or useless
elf has been and still pretty has been either a pawn for bad guy
and sg fixed the gears in axz
she fixed the converters in gx
on top of barely being able to fix anyways
completely different bit from fixing/making
and not ssj
which is why people are saying this form is shemhah
if you have no one to make it into a gear
having it means fuck all
but again
yes
no one can make a gear anymore
the issue is regardless of having the relic or not
again
^
cant rate g high cause nothing in G shoulda have realistically happen but ver just lucks his way through it all....
xv is prob gona be tied or beat s1 for me doh
s1/gx/axz/g for me
much like xdrive ignite wasnt
or be significant
amalgam xdrive may not actually happen
ya know thinking bout it now
stupid gd revolvers
easily worst transformation
chris has been bottom for me period this season which feels pretty bad
cant recall do those have the wub shit in them too?
true facts
which reminds me i gota actually listen to the rest of lasting songs album
i have all the songs that are available but for the most part what gets regular play are basa and chris songs
dislike prob not the word id use for me?
prob the only chris song i actually dont like
and not a big fan of her battle song
it makes sense!
children=tomatoes=jam
no idea what this song's name  is but the piano in track2 of lasting song is  fantastic
*adds to reason to get a switch i guess*
oof switch exclusive
cause shemhah on biki's side now clearly
*from herself*
hmm might as well rewatch 8 with subs at least once right?
*what would matpat even do a gear video on?*
not a mindless drone
and someone actually in control
but its sjj with a complete relic
yea
if ssj is on the table the fight may even end instantly
especially if ssj is on the table
i dont expect any fight vs shem ha in next ep to be very long
when hes shown to not be moving in the direction to show up
the fight thats pretty much over?
when he pretty much doesnt know when he would need to get there
choppers arent insta transport
lets have him tele in for that
yea
shem ha who literally only showed up in the last minute of the ep?
nr was still not fucked
divine power hadnt manifested correctly
i mean what else should he be doing atm?
also at that point youre almost arguing 6-7 eps of him doing stuff vs 1-2 eps of sitting back and watching the show he has set up
^
other than the ep long take over
i mean he really didnt do much in the first half
*that hope is pretty moot at dis point doh id say*
*but that may just be my hope of seeing actual custodians show up*
and honestly im kinda leaning towards thinking shem ha may not even be the final boss
maybe at this point im thinking at most hes just a cusodian's descendant to explain the wonkyness hes not really striking me as an age old being like the rest we have seen
i really dont expect fudou to be the final boss unless they pull the "hes a custodian" card which seems unlikely currently
i kinda expect something to happen next ep with her
and not w/e the relics fine had were
note its a custodian relic
yea
but again amuro's nickname is the white devil which would be a reference to mythology
some not og gundam
does simply referring to god count as having mythology?
gundam/zoids/eye shield 21?
nah mom beating them was ok cause theyre tomatoes
jesus
lol
like i cant recall any attack animation in gear before as lazy as basa's sonic the hedgehog attack
quality this ep seemed pretty lackluster
im  actually unsure which one i like more
o.0 the side B sounds like its straight outa nanoha
oof so busy this last week totally forgot basa album was finally out
wtf is that name
perfect!
then there will be no more miku
yes let shemha win
miracles are curses!
sounds like carol was probably right!
curse and blessing similar
better drop the guard duty completely
yes one of the more dangerous events that could occur happened
they did basically leave elf9 unguarded during the inspection too
i mean
and i at least dont recall it being a byproduct of relic cancer
we havent really had a char actually get into such an angry state as to cause it
ignite wasnt what made it possible
it should still be?
yea im assuming amalgam chris this ep cause dumb revolvers
wonder how the stupid revolvers will cop out on chris this time....
they did feel very underwhelming
i mean as far as using the xdrives this early
oh shit it was the cliffhanger for ep10
dont think it was
welp time to check if it was a cliffhanger
that died cause kiri walked onto the bridge like everything was good
id argue the impact only lasted cause they imediatly went into another fight...
also great joke elf9 says right b4 that talking bout how zesshou are for combat situations the wielder doesnt expect to survive
just havent had the circumstance for it to happen
so berserk should be something that can occur still
yea elf9 literally calls it a function of the gear
cause wana say she also talked bout it
now to see what elf9 says on it
just that it became easier to happen
but from everything said nothing really indicates it was only from the relic merging that she could do it
and it shows the flashback of ryouko talking bout the relic fusing with biki specifically in a way they werent before
fine calls it the fragment going out of control
ignite also basically brought forward those conditions and then controlled it wasnt it?
fine talked bout it during the fight didnt she?
prob gona be disappointed in chris'
im holding judgement on basa's till we see it in better action
yea
add to that they hadnt evolved more since rebuild either
shemha prob the only real highlight for me this ep
prob next ep
that worked out pretty well for maria last ep right?
and detransforming imediatly after a fight w/o confirming the kill
also glad we back to being straight ok with offing people
so its a stupid moot point
that was never going to happen to begin with
the issue is
also pretty sure a chain gun fires lower caliber bullets than a revolver
with a far higher chance of breaking their room's seal
biki literally did something
i mean
after she realizes revolvers suck for fighting hordes
she uses the lazer crossbow in ep 3 too?
i hate the stupid gd revolvers
she used billion maiden vs these same things in ep 1
hopefully they dont try to give them a redeeming suicide like the previous 3 idiots
*gota be when chris is running round with those stupid revolvers trying to single fire take out a horde*
usually soon as raw drops chat starts rolling
yea
im a lil surprised its as quiet in here as it is
boy youre in the wrong channel
dont spoil
who needs to edit it when you go back a handful of frames instead
cut if off and it turned to silver
she didnt transform till after contact
is that 4 weeks in a row?
*yea we would just have the better biki*
its prob spatial compression cause of the clothes when they transform
||everyone had someone show up but chris what bullshit||
||where the hell are chris' parents during the ghost scene||
carol wasnt in her original body she burned it in gx
carol's body was a homunculous too
no one showed up for chris ðŸ˜¦
im more upset that chris' parents didnt show up
guess theyd have to rewrite edgverse right?
how can you butcher that which doesnt exist?
id say they did better than they did with chris
one of the better events
<@!285794457033506816> xdu
*all a dream just to wake up to a nightmare*
symphogear is just a dream edgebiki is having
nah
*are we naruto now?*
^
his community aint exactly what you would want coming in
i would hate that
whats new?
gigguk has bad taste?
since she did make the gears
fine did beat current adam
you could argue
that was a pretty big one i was willing to give her especially with neshutan's durability
but yea not nearly enough info on fine to really judge her
possible adam wasnt nearly as strong in the past and/or fine could counter his alchemy
if anything she was the one that originaly developed alchemy right?
since she really didnt show any outstanding feats by herself
i would assume she had access to relics then at least
nothing she had previously shown was anything pirate fine was shown with (what little we even saw of that)
yea but we didnt really see anything of that
as is she would have neshutan and solomon's staff
theres a few arguments i could see with how she would do it
fine is interesting
so not sure how carol would handle him being able to use chrysopoeia
but adam was depowered to an extent
as they were i would say carol would probably win
kinda hard to say between carol and adam
looking for biki's atm
https://gyazo.com/0b4776933a76c782944ea150c83f3b1b
more that her desire to get revenge on the noise enabled the linker to connect her much like with miku wanting to keep biki from fighting in g
i would kinda argue that kanade wasnt that special
was maria actually not tripping in G when she and serena sang apple at the end since they were in frontier?
i have a bigger question
now after looking through all this stuff
something like that
^
hollowgram enki was pretty responsive
but on the moon she wanted to blow up
is he may have left her a message
worse doh
*blame enki*
i mean the coffin was gona come out sooner or later thanks to global warming and with no moon to stop humanity from connecting we get shemha
i dont think it fixed then rebroke
i wouldnt count that one
yea it cracked
youre talking G airgetlamh when maria activates xdrive i assume?
raises hand up clothes come back on and pendant is now in the raised hand that was empty
nah
only other scene i can think of with a pendant being damaged or popped is armor purge at the end of G which i seem to recall chris reforming her pendant after that?
but we know those things have space warping tech to them at least cause of the clothes
id argue its bigger than the pendants
ehh maybe
but its just a abright spot cant actually see the relic though you can kinda tell the size at least?
yea
https://gyazo.com/3f5e7e81a5dd104dc9024545fbb9fe24
think the only time it was shown was s1? and that was just a bright ball of light
i think another issue with this whole thing is not having anything to go by on what the fragments actually look like
yea nothing to be seen there
guess ill look at that one now but doubt theres anything visible there
actually didnt look into ssj beam destruction
yea they just get straight booted outa ignite in axz
looks like biki's also exploded in gx but maybe not to the extent that kiri's did? hard to tell from the frames
think only ignite?
looks like the ones hit by noise only cracked
didnt actually remember that it was serena that got maria to sing the cursed song and not her own idea
how is the safari zone gona work?
so then
