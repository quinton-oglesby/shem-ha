> While searching for a brave candidate to become a magical girl and defend the world from evil, a mythical creature finds Kayo Majiba, a cute young lady who seems like the perfect fit. But when this newly turned magical girl proves to be a crude delinquent who goes berserk in a conflict, it becomes clear that this may have been a terrible mistake. Now evil‚Äîand any innocent bystanders‚Äîwill face the rage of a magical girl gone wrong!
She looks like discount Mami


There's that one doujinshi artist who does kancolle who I really like but this is <#336297674707828747>
They both get good fanart
Azur lane has a lot of totally innocently drawn short flat chested characters that are cute in a totally innocent way
I'm totally not a lolicon either
I mean she drinks

Lelouch cares about power and his little sister
CC is great
She's cute and snarky and loves pizza
Gib
i think so
*sickness for the thiccness*
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
second-hand embarrasement is awful
but only like physical pain
okay when *I* get hurt i can see that sometimes
also i don't find pain funny
like if a child does something "funny" but it's actually rude/dangerous/etc
i just decide that it isn't funny
tbf i can usually prevent myself from laughing
you say that like you can stop laughing at will
and anime
i pretty much just laugh at memes
such nice lives
rip
lol
laughing is good for health
i feel like it's illegal to kidnap adults too
that
isn't the tiny one the mascot for another series of games
~~i just want more cute pics~~
though being upside down makes my head hurt
tbf
chillin is nice
poor loli samus

azur lane anime does one thing right
kancolle anime is good!

I should rewatch it
Comic girls is such a good anime
Kaos-chan!
Yandex? reverse image search sometimes works when all else fails

Polyamory
The true answer
No the fundamental particles that make up protons and neutrons are gay anime girls
And they are so gay that if you try to separate them new anime girls are created from their gayness
Without the power of yuri you could isolate quarks
And that would destroy the universe
tomgirl is synonymous with tomboy in a lot of accents
and context
there's a huge difference between reading aloud Mark Twain and publicly supporting the subjagation of a large group of people
do you mean like a less extreme example of a black person calling someone else the n-word
i know physical stuff is important
hug a pillow?
like actual voice chat not SMS
do you talk to your friends on the phone?
... so you don't make money i guess?
you're not the only one kek
~~was joke and doujinshi is just fanwork not NSFW~~
books are great
uh
read lots of doujinshi
books, tv
there are lots of hobbies
just write it down and if i want to watch it later do it later
i can't do it
i watch no more than like 5-7 shows at a time
that gonna be crazy
OMG YEAH
sounds like how i get through life in general
non serious advice: just be a stupidly introverted loner
i guess the real question is "what are you having trouble with"
just
watch all the anime
assuming you live in a 1st world country or america i guess
like we *should* have a widely deployed vaccine by then?
i've heard we should be "normal" by may
because of legibility
some *much* more than others
society does that to almost everyone but some more than others
aren't they related
welcome to "invisible" chronic illness/disability!
it sucks
eat healthier, drink water, exercise
sounds like depression
i'm like physically sick but mentally not so much today
c'est la vie
self antonyms are glorious
too late at this point probably
though i think tomboy can *also* mean "girlish-looking boy"
lol
no, as in they both refer to "boyish-looking girl"
like weeb and yankee and ...
don't words seperate from their initial "intent"
there is i guess the rumor of such
i don't think the point is really to deceive
in anime at least
though it's common for those kinds of characters to be very... coy about gender identity i guess
isn't "success" kinda the point of the word ||trap||?
^ this
isn't it more eye of the beholder?
not really "presenting" so much as "appearing as" the other gender in other people's eyes
or am i just missing the mark completely
is someone in drag actually "presenting" as another gender?
juries aren't told they can nullify
for some people their own property is worth more than other people's lives
pretty sure "live in racist country full of guns" is the unreasonable part of well... lots of things
being gay doesn't create a force field around you that physically hurts people
not even
it shouldn't be
both a good thing and a bad thing
jury nullification
actually juries can do whatever they want
you can find it in old caves
swastika is a symbol as old as humanity
> stand back and stand by
just remember: 70 million people saw four years of trump and decided "let's vote for him"
where the KKK is still a thing
welcome to america
i think america's culture is a lot more corrupted than "guns"
honestly
you aren't getting rid of guns from america without genociding half the population
*also decreasing income inequality would probably help to prevent violence more than getting rid of guns*
rifles maybe
okay i think it's the relationship between gun ownership and homocide
i'm remembering wrong
doesn't like switzerland have as much if not more gun ownership than america and yet almost no gun violence?
or even more:
gun violence doesn't correspond with gun ownership
if you're gonna carry a gun you should be trained on what that means
can you quote it here
i mean...
pretty sure there are a lot of people high in american governance who don't give a fuck about helping people with "hateful conclusions"
also too much money is made in china
i have mixed opinions on china but that is neither here nor there
> democrats are killing babies in the streets!
> vote republican today!
everyone needs to learn it
AP lol
or catholics
or irish
or japanese
you certainly don't learn about native genocide in school
as an american raised by a pseudo-communist
it's a lot of things
and i imagine handguns are cheaper
can't hide a rifle on your person as easily
gotta be easy on them
hey america hasn't even solved healthcare
imho
there would be less muggers if there was a social safety net
levels of societal trust have dropped drastically over the last 50 years or so
america has an extreme case of polarization
could be LGB?
then again, twitter
also yeah *pay for clicks* doesn't help *at all*
also one of the sad things about the modern internet (and no i have no idea how to fix this) is that "memes" (i mean that in the strictly technical term) survive because of virulency and not truth
if nothing is real then everything is permitted
that's just a super loaded poll lol
yeah the old kind of trolling (associated with like 4chan before it became a shitstorm i guess)
let them duel it out
hire a bunch of trolls, create american pro- and anti- abortion accounts
but like fanning the flames is what russia's has probably done
no idea who that is
i'm talking about the very insidious type of trolling where people are paid to go online with tons of fake accounts to push certain political opinions and/or advertisements
where people confuse each other
to you mean the "old" type of trolling
or other political influence
not a lot of money in trolling unless the discord is huge
there really isn't a foolproof way to figure out if someone is a bot in isolation
though sometimes it's simple things like 1000 accounts tweeting the exact same words
you'd be amazed at how good text generators have gotten these days
if there's money to be made
there are enough people without morals
i bought *manufactoring consent* and should actually go read it
heh
also if you can scare people into thinking actual people are trolls/bots all the better
also trolls are stupid cheap
there is so much "subtle" warfare going on
i guess time to let zuckerberg now i'm a communist /s
how much of twitter is bots lol
pretty sure russians have been caught introducing trolls into american discourse to make things worse as well
no more sending money to parasites
actually it'll decrease
life is complicated
no longer poor
give them money
we have big debt because "deficit doesn't matter"
lol yes
\/s
but *medicare for all* is *socialism!*
*the history of UK and Ireland*
it's stuff like trump voters getting caught sending in votes for themselves and their dead parents
i've only heard of a small handful
*almost entirely trump voters though lol*
there's been a couple instances of voter fraud
like
apparently their lawyers have been ludicriously bad
some absurd number
they've also lost like
31/32 lawsuits so far?
welcome to america
also i pay $1400/month in rent
the graph is percent
people who are rich are chosen by God, and are therefore moral authorities
because if you make less money you have less worth as an individual
but no we can't have the government helping out those *black people* or *welfare queens* or whatever
especially when *they did*
darn millenials destroying the economy! /s
lived through too many "temporary recessions"
i personally can't imagine ever having the money for children
creating one of the most selfish generations in american history
idk america still arrests a bunch of people for burning leaves

<https://www.businessinsider.com/sidney-powell-election-lawsuit-witness-vote-problems-edison-county-2020-12>
probably
the metal obelisks
That is also a thing
Well there's actual concern
And then there's "this makes *me* look bad" "concern"
0.5% detransition is amazing though
Wow really
Idk even ibuprofen has side effects
I'm sure there are side effects
i know people have died in my family from being under-insured
grass is greener if you've never been there
US healthcare sucks
as someone without *money*
oh don't misinterpret
$350/month is like barely better than catostrophic insurance with super high deductibles for a single person
the US has the best healthcare system in the world if you have money
it's *fiction*
pedophilia is attraction to pre-pubescent
i'm not gonna find it but there was that case where an australian? was arrested for CP and the only reason he was eventually let out is the porn actress *who is most definitely >>18* flew out to australia to pretty much yell at the judge that *yes, she is legal*
so?
and it's not morally wrong to lewd a fictional character
short very young flat people very definitely exist
also yes doujins/hentai/etc
you totally can roleplay lolis are you mad
mind break
NTR
guro
blackmail
rape
... idk
what's the difference between liking these and lolis
it's all fictional
Or some other place where people at least pretend to care
I just wanna run away and move to Norway
Everything from ordinary people to government
And has been for a long time
I mean
It's become kind of obvious that the fabric of this country is morally bankrupt
I honestly hate the country I live in
Gaming isn't known for the best software engineering honestly
lolicon is not child porn
i've seen vore that looks like cannibalism tbh
cannibalism is an actual thing
yeah most people into "fiction" like that are *very* aware of the difference between fiction and real life
ah yes, people who read NTR hentai are cheaters
people who read rape hentai want to rape people irl

also people who play call of duty want to murder people in the streets
yeah right
because the USA was founded by puritans
because the west is stupid about it
not because they are morally right
lol no
tbh that pretty much ends up because the rest of us are mostly in agreement
god what's the point of "dulling their attraction" to... entirely fictional characters?
i'm blocking tusk, muting this channel for a while and gonna go watch anime
if it's against the rules have a mod tell me
i don't believe in censoring words when talking about them
calling lolicons "pedophiles" you might as well go around calling trans peoples "fucking traps" and blacks "the n-word (censored because people don't like seeing words)"
because yes
*pedophile* is an *extreme* thing to accuse someone of
but to let you know
this argument is dumb
you have a conclusion and that's that
tusk you don't care about your arguments
gayness was once "clinically a mental disorder"
^
lol are you serious
people play games *for this*
is literally the argument you're making
"games lead to violence"
there is no child
or ink on paper
it's pixels
there is no child
again
there is no child
i'm not used to censoring words like that in contexts like that
after the fact
taken into consideration, i'll try to remember that for the future here
they should have a representative whose power is proportional to the amount of people who voted for the representative
something like ranked choice voting + voting representatives get vote proportional to those who voted for them + representatives get multiple seats instead of just 1
also yes first-past-the-post sucks
aka "all theories are wrong, some are useful"
<https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/aMHq4mA2PHSM2TMoH/the-categories-were-made-for-man-not-man-for-the-categories>
we need categories because the world is too complex for us to understand and deal with the world without them
i'm radical european centrist
i want taxes to go to public healthcare instead of creating burnt bodies in the desert
https://www.reddit.com/r/Foodforthought/comments/kb51c0/stealing_to_survive_more_americans_are/gfelkdt/
maybe i should read grapes of wrath
also argghhhsfjsdfwefhwavnsdvajrw
You are the only person you will definitely be with your entire life
C'est la vie
One of my big fears for the future is that there is some not so well known fascist politician with huge ambitions and actual competence who has been taking notes over the last four years (context: USA)
Also Colorado joined it this year yay
Destroy the electoral college from inside
And will be such a lolzy thing when it finally comes into effect
The interstate compact will be great too
Trump is a result of an endemic problem
^
How about this pandemic
Isn't there that tweet
"If we elect him it will be the end of the gop and we will deserve it"
I'd love to see trumpers break off the gop and just destroy the American right for a long time
As Senate majority leader
I just wish I could vote against McConnell
It's Georgians voting after all
Agreed
oh i donated to her too
like literally cockroaches have a higher approval rating
it's fucked
also yeah US congress has like a 10% approval rating but each individual member of congress have like 90%+ approval rating for those who vote for them
yay democracy
i donated to run off senate elections in Georgia even though I live in Colorado even though I don't really care about them or their policies or anything because I want the senate majority leader gone who has way too much power but is entirely elected by the enlightened state of Kentucky and essentially no one else (other than the GOP, who needs to die now)
generally
it's hard to be excited to vote for the least evil
it's why we need something like ranked choice voting
i often have a choice between a corporate spineless democrat and a republican who doesn't believe in people's rights
gerrymandering
who decides the borders
who says we won't use other things in 100 years?
why does it need to be silicon?
https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/aug/07/robot-heal-thyself-scientists-develop-self-repairing-machines
just from a google search
of old age, of cancer?
how many people die, again?
biology *can't* repair any damage incurred
but they can be built
can be impractical
we have self-repairing machines
also there really isn't any physical reason why intelligence has to stop at human-level
i am very much a physicalist and will say anything a human can do a machine can do, because a human is an example of a machine that can do it
honestly these problems are problems we already have (machine learning and social media anyone?)
almost by definition a superintelligence is unopposable
and there's no reason for it to have values at all like human values at all
i guess to continue on a point in a convo in <#336297808221044736> ....
in the space of all possible minds there is no relation between "intelligence" and "values"
which is honestly very scary wrt future AI developments
it's scary and dangerous
america no longer believes in the same reality
pretty sure like 2/3 of the GOP is now
*inserts bender meme*
i mean they're comparing trump to god damn Caesar
fucking lmao
idk you can't import hentai in australia anymore
and they banned E2E encryption
australia is... interesting
doesn't australia have like one big city area though
i have two choices for ISP
centurylink dsl
and comcast
tbh duopolies/tripolies/etc aren't that great either
also screw murdoch
i know in america there are like, 5 companies that own like 95% of media or something stupid like that
for a lot of reasons
oh fuck disney
they fuck you over and they don't care cause it's not like you can go to anyone else
so much this
^ so much this
Trump is incompetent
so many problems are caused by corporations externalizing costs
pollution needs to be taxed(/etc)
incentives are a big problem
people do not cooperate at that level
"properly managed"
we'll just fuck up the other planet if we don't solve it
tbh that doesn't solve anything only delays it
also for an american centric view: *why care about global warming when the second coming of jesus christ is coming soon*
why help them?
most of the most affected areas are poor so
climate change mitigation will likely be too little too late
it will just kill a lot of people
climate change won't kill us
also just remembering an earlier point
*100 years in the future is not too long when it comes to existential risk*
there is no magic in the human brain
... which is why once you have human level intelligence superintelligence is not very far away
humans exist
therefore human level artificial intelligence can be built
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_law#Forecasts_and_roadmaps> it's still not 2025
> analog
computational power approximately (moore's law analog) halves in cost every 2 years
the numbers may be wrong but it's exponential
it has definitely been considered lol
you're totally missing the point
learning is not hardware upgrade
no
it's not at all
no
humans have not had mental hardware upgrades for tens of thousands of years (if not more)
most mining equipment is automated these days iirc
and where was it 10 years ago
in 10 years a lot of trucking is likely to be replaced with automated technology
it's already good enough for use on public roads
AI improves way faster than human intelligence improves (if at all)

have any of you read this btw
it's on my list and i don't remember where i saw it
also people's morality often differs from yours (especially if separated a lot by distance/time/culture/etc), and yes, that means there will be things you find horrific
and vice versa
irrespective of who is right
Also like we're on an anime discord
Oh is he one of *those* people
Now *that's* an accusation
There are assholes everywhere
~~police aren't supposed to kill guilty people either, for a total aside~~
^
I thought they said homosexuality was disgusting
Ya know I totally misread the tweet
Though TBH any sort of sex you're not into is probably going to be physically disgusting
And human brains tend to overlap physical and moral disgust
Such a terrible little issue
There are real people like that
I'm not sure it matters
If you want to lose hope in humanity you should look at parler
I feel like my retirement plan right now is suicide
A dystopia where half the people are brainwashed into thinking it's a utopia
Welcome to america
I feel like if I ever got cancer I would rather just kill myself instead of burden my family with the medical bills
fuck puritans and puritan "values"
like
though considering how corrupt american society and government is maybe we deserve to be glassed and enslaved by aliens
hence why america needs socialism
the modern american food industry is worse than the cigarrette industry was at their height
> americans see themselves as temporarily embarrased millionaires
inequality is much higher than even before the french revolution
like it's all so absurd
sometimes i just want to light myself on fire in front of mcconnell's house
*and everything still is unhealthy for you*
for which there is often *the illusion of choice*
but no the whole "it's choice!" thing was invented by sleazy food companies
medical costs are the largest cause of bankruptcies in the USA iirc
unregulated capitalism
<@!383228351168512001> it's capitalism circles
also a lot of time *it's impossible to predict ahead of time how much things will cost*
my CT scan charged $1600 to insurance and i had to pay ~$600 out of pocket
apparently even wild animals have gained in weight in the last 100 years or so
<@!430379754190012426> the obesity epidemic is worldwide
but yes probably worse in america
tbh
and US taxes are such bs
i didn't get any but skipped the last two years of high school
don't think i would've gotten much tbh
lmao
Poor joke tbh
*corruption*
How many people delay medical care because of expenses
We already do ration it
in which case they aren't voting
then they're in a coma
and voted for trump
they saw everything that happened
over 70 million people voted for trump in this last election

https://twitter.com/AOC/status/1341127578904653830?s=19
burn the GOP
<https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/khjx24/republican_lawmakers_vote_far_more_often_against/>
> Republican lawmakers vote far more often against the policy views held by their district than Democratic lawmakers do. At the same time, Republicans are not punished for it at the same rate as Democrats. Republicans engage in representation built around identity, while Democrats do it around policy.
something fun i saw a couple minutes ago
*politics*
*runs*
well that just sounds like government with extra steps
mei are you a siscon
11 is pretty damn young ngl
Welcome to ocd and religion
Is this the osu playing sister
Free market is a technical term with very good meaning
Go study economics
Seriously
Almost by definition
A monopoly is not a free market
No
Insane regulations that make it impossible for new companies to enter
No it isn't
It's a lot of monopolies
Awful
Is ludicrously
The current system
Even that would be better than the current system
It is not at all anywhere close to being a free market
It's not a free market
I live in the us system
Instead of 1000x markup for insulin
A lot less
No it would cost less
Like a free market free for all would be an improvement
Like it is just *so* bad
Probably
The current American healthcare system is the worst in the world
Though I have no idea how
Restore trust and community
Destroy the GOP and the 2 party system
Medicare for all
Ranked choice voting
Anti gerrymandering and voter suppression
If I ever do anything it will be highly political
But my country is so fucked up
Not truth or beauty or anything good
Memes are selected for virility
But yeah the attention economy sucks
I'm too tired and mentally burned out to do anything major outside work
https://imgur.com/gallery/6jqk413
What the fuck
also first-past-the-post
also "corporations are people and money is free speech"
agreed inequality is beneficial because of incentives
hence why america should have very high taxes at the upper levels of income again
problems happen however when the decision making power is *too* lopsided
aka decentralized economic decision making
markets when regulated well are very amazing things
> For classical economists such as Adam Smith, the term free market does not necessarily refer to a market free from government interference, but rather free from all forms of economic privilege, monopolies and artificial scarcities
quote from wikipedia
"capitalism" is such a huge broad stroke
eh
though if we can take care of the worst off among us
i don't really believe billionaires should exist honestly
fundamentally democracy *needs* a relatively free market
also capitalism != free market, they are related but different things
i am very much a leftest fyi
and there's no reason they couldn't collude in a single-payer system to screw up the regulations
also yeah a free market needs regulations to *stay* a free market
> idealized
In an idealized free market collusion is impossible
And in real life you have monopoly-busting and other anti-collusion regulations
I live under this absolutely arcane barbaric system
There's always a group who dies
Under any real system
Fyi I support medicare for all/single payer
That's the point
... they're currently thrown under the bus
I was saying "this system would be way better than the current system even though it's still awful"
I don't think you get the point
Considering the fair market price would sometimes be 1000x less than it is now...
And the GOP has this God damned fascination with "free market economies!" that are in no way free market economies
It's just the American system is beyond awful
I'm not even suggesting creating a free market healthcare system
Like it's close to impossible to even know how much you are going to pay a lot of the time
The current us system is nowhere near that
More than the current system?
And a lot of healthcare too actually
Also you can't meaningfully create a free market for especially emergency care
That's my point
Yeah American healthcare isn't a free market
And no capitalism != free market economics
But no American healthcare is as far as free market as you can get
There are a lot of bullshit regulations and such, regulatory capture/etc
selective bias or something
but yep lol
i mean like
the only good thing is it's kinda cheap
i know someone who lives in malaysia and hates it
i don't like any religion tbh
and the extremists are fucked
i am really not a fan of like
most of islam
fuck that
fpi?
<https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/30/meditations-on-moloch/>
All that is left is Moloch
there's a yuri sci-fi coming in winter
which is fine ~~remembers i'm constantly wearing yuri goggles~~
maybe?
honestly a shitty straight couple is gonna get less backlash than a shitty gay couple
there is that too
like more stuff where there's a non-primary romance and it's non-"traditional/cisstraightwhitewhatever"
but yeah lol
or more seasons
but yeah i would love more shows like that
okay that was a really excited reaction
I FUCKING LOVE THAT SHOW
or even yaoi action i'll watch it if it's good
gib yuri action
like
romance action out there
tbh like there are so much like
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
.... but then never let it actually happen
they'll gladly play it up and accept the attention of lgbt community
(talking hollywood as well)
is that unless it's straight up yuri/yaoi or whatever
honestly something that annoys me too
and the chinese censorship which makes me go arghhhhhhhhhhhh
or whatever
my issue is more is was an obvious "social credit" grab
fair
honestly AAA kinda sucks
guess it's better than nothing
honestly the only thing i don't like is when it's an obvious moneygrab or their character is only I'M LESBIAN with no other characterization at all
like in one of the star wars movies they had two girls kiss in the background
and edited it out for china
not sure it means much
~~but i want to play as a sexy girl~~
i haven't heard that but it's kinda great
moloch infects all
everything is politics
common linguistic joke
> what's the difference between a language and a dialect?
> an army and a navy!
tbh apparently in scandanavia it's like that now
people used to be able to mostly talk in each others languages
now they just all speak english to each other lol
fuckers need guillotines
nope
and now it's like
like we may have *major* issues but at least we're trying
tbh i used to have some kind of connection to my country
*no one raises hand*
i'm honestly opposed to alimony
same
truth
or just do it by the best tax advantage
i can't even imagine trusting someone that much tbh
depending on where you are
pretty sure there are *massive* cultural/religious issues with marriage
i don't want kids
it seems like a bad deal
tbf i don't want to get married
lol
^ this
i never have that problem!
just move thousands of miles away!
i've forgotten a lot about college
it's like come on
in public
full on kiss for minutes at a time
tbf i think the only time it *really* bothered me was there was a straight couple at my community college who would just like
though i used to be more elitist and condescending and judgmental of people
tbh i dislike seeing *any* couple doing pda in public
~~also when is japan finally gonna legalize same sex marriage~~
~~what about people who don't think miku/bikki are a ship and that they're just friends~~
that one sol cheerleading anime had an explicitly gay side character
idk i've really only done that with yuri type ships
but i'm odd
~~honestly i just want love live to officially pair two of the idols and watch all the hardcore fans freak out~~
it should be opt out tbh
forced child support is giving up your body for other people's health
this
could be used to help disadvantaged kids instead
my taxes that pay for creating burnt corpses in the middle east
which is bs
i'm not generally a fan of forcing medical procedures on people
i'm going to say no but
man should have no responsibilities to the baby
like if you have money that means you are morally superior
some people believe that being rich == being supported by God or some bullshit
*america's problems in a nutshell*
don't rely on random unreliable individuals
have actual government welfare systems to take care of people
woman can have abortions generally whenever they want
but
tbf i don't know exactly how the details should work
idk i have absolutely no moral issue with abortion
beforehand
like even if a financial abortion requires a vasectomy
and before anyone goes "what about the child" have an actual welfare system instead of depending on random individuals
i want a financial abortion tbh
for the most absurd example
wtf
like
like guys have been sued for child support by their rapists *and been granted it*
government says *fuck you*
but if she accidentally gets pregnant (*or does so on purpose*)
make sure i use condoms
so i can get a vasectomy
i'm a guy
god this is where i go all UBI happy
give people the ability to walk away from abusive situations *period*
i just want sex and companionship and to never be hit with child support for stupid reasons
though idk if i care too much
i mean people change as well
same with child support tbh
like get rid of alimony and have UBI/government funded support instead
like killing someone's cat is way more egregious
it's not murder at all
whereas someone like me
which is the big reason why the abortion debate is such a big deal
yeah if you literally thought abortion was murder..... you might be willing to blow up abortion clinics
as horrible as that sounds
because religions gonna religion
tbf there are probably groups of people (religions/etc) who would revolt if you forced them to donate organs/receive organs
... i forgot
don't want to hear how EMTs talk i guess
the people who care will opt out
yes
honestly anything stricter than opt-out is gonna be a very difficult thing to push in most societies
i mean some people have hidden diseases and you really don't want their organs
honestly this is an issue where the genders are *very* asymmetric
not one i'm at all against
i don't believe that a fetus has a right to live any more than sperm does
hot take: if you're against abortion because it's murder
you should be a vegan
a fetus has less consciousness than an animal
oh abortion should be totally legal and totally the woman's choice for that reason alone
but that's a total aside
health insurance is kind of an annoying misnomer tbh
i think for me it was a checkmark when i got my driver's license
and were desecrated anyway
or opted-out
i think with cocoa it's more if they didn't opt-in to it
or public education/housing
do you mean like high-trust societies
welcome to humanity
i don't have cocoa's belief so
i wouldn't really do much of anything
when i'm dead i don't need them
i've opted in to organ donation
or someone finds it 100 years later
what if you're a major historical figure
xd
i mean the dead can hold onto copyright
people are not rational beings
it's complicated
i'm not sure dead bodies really deserve rights tbh
which are things i don't know how to fix
honestly at that point you have a major cultural problem
some day we'll be able to make organs and it won't be an issue anymore
yeah mandatory just seems like an excuse to give more undeserved powers to the state
and opt-out is probably the best way to keep them peaceful
but there are many who do
also i don't believe in sacredness either
again cremation is a thing
there's not much of a point tbh
also our family mostly does cremation
but idk i'm gonna leave this convo
if you don't have ID
compatibility
blood types and stuffs
cause like
if they can't identify you they probably won't meaningfully take your organs
though they need to be able to identity you
that too
iirc most organ donations come from car accidents
they don't need to ask you
here it's on your driver's license
probably
nah
if you don't you don't care enough
or *really easy* opt-in
idk just have opt-out
idk
then they get their organs taken
like tbh i don't know how you deal with the "abortion is murder" people
~~though a lot of them are shitty and don't care at all after the child is born~~
complexity bad
like some organs have to be delivered in hours
circles there often isn't time for that
weren't we talking about abortion at some point
people just don't understand each other
<https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-ghislaine-maxwell-i-wish-her-well>
<https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-ghislaine-maxwell-wish-her-well/>
just on google
"i wish her well"
other than literal pedophiles
who does trump not have beef with
tbf i'll admit i don't understand a lot of right-leaning values at all
but i don't want to go into that
yeah pretty sure i don't like him
~~except one because he was unopposed~~
i voted blue
every single one
this election I actually looked at all the candidates
are.... are there actually good people in the GOP at this point?
federally it seems like none
don't fall in for the both sides bullshit
corrupt to evil
the GOP went from like
i mean
or bernie
more dems like AOC
i wish dems would grow backbones
did he really
kind of huge meta spoilers?: ||it sounds like fire force||
> With deliberately both vague and vivid descriptions, the narrator depicts a summer festival in the utopian city of Omelas, whose prosperity depends on the perpetual misery of a single child
~~this sounds like an anime ngl~~
but yeah morals are hard
utilitarianism is great
it's late
targeted phishing is *very much a thing*
sadly email security is kind of a joke
i mean... that's the point
though phishing tests are something you kinda have to do
wow that's cruel
ah okay
i guess try to sleep?
taxi/etc?
hang in there
can't go back home?
F
couldn't you just walk out
reasonable adults are a myth
hopefully
one day you'll live alone and won't have to deal with it if you don't want to
you kinda have to just ignore it sometimes and let it take its course
i mean i wish losing weight didn't take so long
most everything takes time
i hate "confidence men"
confidence training is such a sham
I always think I'm ugly
I mean yeah
I've known girls named Alex
Isn't Alex gender neutral?
Tbf isn't that a common shortening
Or am I an idiot
The year after I graduated college was awful beyond compare in my personal life
... yeah there's a reason I have a hard time with them
Eh, better than when I was stupid depressed and they joked about me being homeless and collecting cans for cash
little me did not take that well
didn't help that they picked on me for having a crush in *first grade*
really
but like
like it's nice they're supportive at all
ah yeah
my parents would joke that i was gay and tell me "it was okay to come out as gay" and stuff until i dated a girl once
honestly a lot of that stuff is amusing to me unless they're being dicks about it
~~tbh i'm cis and i get misgendered on the internet sometimes and i'm either amused or like it~~
by the lowest bidder
it's more than that city apparently
telecom is an absolute shitshow
i work in 9-1-1
wait what
~~how many people have been breaking quarantine~~
When it was untreated it was just pain so strong I wanted to stab my stomach with a kitchen knife and rip it out
No
And makes me feel awful if I get any meaningful amount of it
Pretty sure sugar is a big trigger
Like sadly I'm probably gonna have to throw away most of the sweets people gave me though
Peppermint oil helps a lot when I take it constantly
Idk
I know my doctor said there wasn't much over the counter stuff I could take when he felt my intestines spasming
Ibs is like intestinal
Isn't that for like heart burn
Honestly the closest thing I think I've had to dysphoria is being overweight with ibs
Or just very self conscious?
Also voice coaching
But yeah hormone levels might not be bad to check
Is it just that your voice is feminine?
That's good
Don't forget the basics
So much
Drink water etc
Also try eating better
jeebus
rip what happened
is wlw women love women?
All labels are wrong but some are useful or something
Or just don't want a million boys in their inbox I guess
*survive*
but yes, that robert downey jr meme
some of us have felt this way long before the pandemic and will feel this way for long after
otherwise just live on spite
like honestly the best thing i've found is to just focus on yourself
maybe your immediate community if you have that
i feel like the only thing the pandemic did to me was really *show* me just how absolutely *disgusting* the society i live in is
i'm alive because all this anime won't watch itself
you definitely aren't the only one
Though they might be some of the worst
Fast food isn't the only thing to look out for
But yeah I got a lot of my knowledge of this from *how not to die* by Michael Greger
I swear I don't wear tin foil
countries are too big
XD
you're #2
F
chaos where you live
i live in colorado
like i am too but.... people went into quarantine and mostly did the right things
i live in america
maybe
a month
i felt a sense of community for like
honestly was trying to find/remember the quote i thought of earlier but couldn't find it but this one kinda fits
Moral Mazes the book
> The main dimensions of team play are as follows. 1. One must appear to be interchangeable with other managers near one‚Äôs level. Corporations discourage narrow specialization more strongly as one goes higher. They also discourage the expression of moral or political qualms. One might object, for example, to working with chemicals used in nuclear power, or working on weapons systems, and most corporations today would honor such objections. Publicly stating them, however, would end any realistic aspirations for higher posts because one‚Äôs usefulness to the organization depends on versatility. As one manager in Alchemy Inc. comments: ‚ÄúWell, we‚Äôd go along with his request but we‚Äôd always wonder about the guy. And in the back of our minds, we‚Äôd be thinking that he‚Äôll soon object to working in the soda ash division because he doesn‚Äôt like glass.‚Äù Strong convictions of any sort are suspect. One manager says: If you meet a guy who hates red-haired persons, well, you‚Äôre going to wonder about whether that person has other weird perceptions as well. You‚Äôve got to have a degree of interchangeability in business. To me, a person can have any beliefs they want, as long as they leave them at home. Similarly, one‚Äôs spouse‚Äôs public viewpoints or activities could reduce others‚Äô perceptions of a manager‚Äôs versatility or indeed ability. In reference to another manager whose wife was known to be active in environmental action groups, lobbying in fact for legislation on chemical waste disposal, one Alchemy manager says: ‚ÄúIf a guy can‚Äôt even manage his own wife, how can he be expected to manage other people?‚Äù (Location 1137)

i mean even the feminism movement can't be said to be all-exclusive
TERFs and feminist supremacists exist after all
anything bigger than that gets more and more broken
people evolved to live in groups of <50 people
it's amazing anything works at all
<https://thezvi.wordpress.com/2020/12/15/motive-ambiguity/> reminds me of this i just read today
maybe i should join a communist party when covid finally goes away
i think buying a heater is cheaper and easier than repairing a democracy
sometimes i just want to fuck everything and just move to like norway or something
america is barely a democracy
we really need like RCV or something
fuck 'em
idk
considering that when the electoral college voted for the one who did get the popular vote were the times with the worst presidents....
where rural citizens get more votes than city ones
just..... stupid FPTP
it is FPTP
also fuck the electoral college
also LA county has more people than Canada iirc
like each blue state has less population than LA county (the red)
Pareto strikes again!
I want another fdr
Is my point about that
Republicans are totally disingenuous
Yeah and the Republicans started caring about the deficit again <:TsubasaYareYare:407397617451139073>
Didn't they call the national guard so Trump could take a picture of him holding a Bible upside down in front of a church
I don't want a coup or an attempted coup
I hope so
Fuck them with medicare for all
Okay Ossof hasn't been called yet
Looks like we're getting a democratic Senate!
It's just an insincere attempt to deflect blame for the flames he has fed
How come I don't believe this
There is no way they aren't
Maga is armed
Also it's our capital being overrun with a violent mob
Apparently a photoshoot is fine
The Nazis weren't successful when they first tried
But it's really really bad still
This coup won't be successful
By God it is
*night of broken glass*
Wow cnn just telling it outright
This is insurrection they all need to rot in jail
That's how you let wounds fester
I heard there was a militia gathering in georgia but haven't heard of violence so far
Is the violence only in DC?
Jesus I'm not looking forward to the future of this country right now
God I want to see the hague actually charge an American for once
Trumper drugs
He deserves to be hanged for his crimes against the American people (and the world)
Charge him for sedition and treason
Trump is beyond any sort of redemption
This is beyond impeachment
And a lot of the GOP
Trump needs to end up in jail
Trump needs to be charged
the what
it's almost like the rest of government shouldn't just let the president do whatever he wants



"except georgia... georgia can stay"
remember WWI
as someone who is currently living in that map i'd rather it didn't
<https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/krzghx/how_it_started_and_how_it_ended/>
CW? protestors at congress
also a bunch need to be charged and expelled
hopefully republicans learn that touting support from extremists is a... not good idea
no, no it ain't
That's because it's Iota from cyrillic
god damn why are sans serif fonts a thing :genocide:

well today is "attempted coup against the most powerful military country in the world" day
the document isn't even legally binding
just make sure you and your friends are white
anyone encouraging violence at the capitol right now is not a "decent human being"
makes sense
i mean that is a terrible emote
how do we stop fascists from stealing symbols
Also I kinda admire Scandinavia
Also like "if america goes fascist within my lifetime it'd be pretty nice if I had a get out of dodge plan"
Would be hard to learn it well without living there
I mean I would definitely try to learn
Like more than a lot of europe
Don't a lot of them speak English now too
i will for healthcare
i mean....
it would be like norway
not the balkans or the UK
honestly at this point especially i'm like "do i seriously try to move to europe within the next 10-20 years or sooner"
i'm afraid democrats aren't gonna hold republicans accountable because "peace and reconciliation" or some bs
are there actual serif characters in unicode
wut
can you actually do that
It's a cult
They aren't even in the same reality
They are fascists who believe that Democrats are killing millions of people and are against the American way
"hurting the wrong people"
I think that is understating it
Which will be nice
Democrats mostly control the federal government for at least 2 years
Just gotta let Stacey Abrams on it

inciting a riot is pretty illegal
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shouting_fire_in_a_crowded_theater>
there are already reports of people on parler organizing for more of what happened earlier this week
anything promoting trump at this point is a lot more than concerning
i watched the first like 15-30 seconds without sound
i don't know if i should be worried or super worried
<https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25709832>
It's AWS wowzers
Do they mean AWS, or just S3?
I mean he did just (poorly) attempt a coup
<https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-attempted-coup-federal-law-enforcement-capitol-police-2021-1>
Also there really isn't medication for unsupportive family
pretty sure they're meds and not a cure
my mother is like this
it is absolutely awful
are you eating properly and drinking water
I assume it's something like that
*ATT will not support people who continue to lie about the general security of our elections and encouraged a violent coup at the capitol
Also a lot of them are scared for them and their families lives
And even after the 20th if they convict Trump will be barred from holding public office ever again
Mitch mcconnell says he's not gonna be a brick wall this time
Democrats will vote to convict but are only half
And I think 17? Senate Republicans need to vote to convict
Last time Senate did not convict
Has to be convicted to be removed
Trump is on trial again
How do nearly all the Republicans experience the riot first hand and only 10 vote to impeach
https://mobile.twitter.com/Rschooley/status/1349396619398062081?s=19
tbh
the republicans are just fucking insane
but yeah lol
> ‚ÄúIn all honesty, the reason we did The Pirate Bay was to bring freedom and take back control from a centralised system,‚Äù Kolmisoppi said. ‚ÄúThe reason that Gab et al will fail is because they're just whining bitches that have only one ideology: egotism. Sharing is caring y'all.‚Äù
this one too
the org url is still there and it's on wikipedia
pirate bay is still there
I don't want another civil war
Well they probably all hate each other
So they all need their own bathrooms
Cause they're assholes
America needs some RCV
Like Romney is apparently the first
Who seem to never not vote on party lines for impeachment
Yeah the Senate
Of course the trial is done by politicians
Well impeachment is supposed to mean there is now a trial
I saw it on imgur and I didn't see the link

Interesting twitter thread

just.... so long ago
ya know i think i had lockdown drills
ya know when there's a shooter about
lockdown drills
idk i'm 27
maybe?
i honestly don't remember if i was in a shooter drill
*America‚Ñ¢Ô∏è*

FCC regulations used to be stricter especially for news
~~it's something to distract me when i'm stuck on the toilet~~
i do

like imgur whenever politics is happening
Also learning to sing will probably help no matter what
Doesn't Ireland have its own public healthcare system she can use
ya know
i know democrats have issues but they pale in comparison to the sins of republicans
oh pls don't do the "both sides" bs
america has a lot of white supremecists
like still over 50% of republican voters support him?
like......?
how in the
just
how
where one of the political parties is 90% a god forsaken fucking cult of personality
i have to live in this country
especially for like
ya know
*insurrection*
trump is the worst president america has ever had
*and that is saying a lot*
america needs to oust out its white supremecism
or an easy anything
also don't think it'll be an easy biden win
clinton is a dem
also he got like, ~75 million votes this election?
he won against clinton
that's (supposedly) the purpose of impeachment
to bad no one actually votes anything like conscience or reality and just votes along party lines
*which i very much don't want to see*
also noi if he isn't impeached he can run again in 2024
once he's no longer president he's fair game
old department of justice memo is it really
yeah i would've preferred someone like Bernie
once trump is gone maybe
is nothing like "tearing hundreds of records in anger"
biden tearing apart a piece of paper or two
also like
like i'm not gonna argue that this isn't ya know *bad* but it's so comically minor at this point
then again the vote this year was comically evil murderous seditionist and.... Biden
like of all the bad things i've heard about biden this is so.... minor
100x that
like a temper is like
how is that even a temper?
honestly trump needed to be ousted at nearly any cost
also he was Obama's VP
i feel like biden *is* that
like Biden is at least human darnit
like literally how often did Trump talk over Biden?
Obama didn't have to deal with Trump
like i've seen the scene it's so held back
that doesn't make it a *temper*
fuck trump supporters they're a cult anyway
like that is *nowhere* near temper my god
is that even a temper?
the "would you just shut up man"?
biden has a temper?
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FCC_fairness_doctrine>
ain't gonna work
direct democracy does not scale to millions of people
candidates are inevitable
if you don't fix first past the post you will always end up in a 2 party system one way or another
it's because of first past the post
there are limits
though when one party is seriously trying to become a fascist dictatorship and violently threaten to kill tremendous amounts of people
i mean, so does everyone
even so much as getting "tours" from congressmen the day before
they were prepared to kill a *lot* of the government officials there
it wasn't so much "storming the capitol" as actual insurrection
> When fascism comes to America it will be wrapped in the flag and carrying a cross.
nixon is now topped by trump
we know noi
and running a country like a business is *stupid*
trump is one of the worst businessmen in history
my god i was so wrong
i actually thought he was hilarious at first
like laughably so
trump is literally evil and i don't mean that as a joke
by far america's biggest domestic threat is white supremacist terrorists, according to the FBI
they do noi, they do
voter suppression
Yeah that is stupid and never happening
anarchism is entirely 100% impractical on any meaningful scale
<https://thezvi.wordpress.com/2019/12/28/moloch-hasnt-won/>

it's called marginal tax rate noi
no they aren't
also yeah wealth tax
noi i'm saying net worth over a billion dollars *should* be taxes stupidly heavily
100% is an exaggeration but yeah
but billionaires are a policy failure
i mean yeah it's gotta be more complex than you can say in a single discord message

Ah yeah the "am I the only one without Stockholm syndrome" syndrome
Modern america is completely and utterly fucked yes (also other places I'm sure I'm just less familiar)
Though you need to fix a lot of other shit as well
You can't fix mental health without fixing diet
also
"in a totally open society" to me is similar to something like "very small differences in environmental factors per individual"
fetuses start with a "female" template and, if going to be male, develop male traits later
not really?
males are exposed to X chromosome, women aren't exposed to Y chromosome
in a totally open society I would expect it to be dominated by genetic factors which makes it hard for me to suggest that it would likely be equal

iirc aren't there more mtf than ftm?
he's doing a *lot* of executive orders iirc
Memetics *are* evolution though
evolution is one of those things that is very easy to anthropomorphize that very very very much *should not be*
you could do that too with ludicrous amounts of resources, millions of years, and absolutely zero ethics
it really isn't that amazing
elegant does not mean good
among other things
there's a reason Darwin died an atheist
the blind idiot god at the center of the universe
evolution is evil incarnate
i don't consider biology elegant
as a compsci
*the chaos of biology scares me*

also, like, designer babies
also I feel like preventing your child from having genetically/etc caused suffering is only a good thing
"F gets to continue" sounds like default XD
what's bad about prenatal eugenics?

idk, knowing how it comes about might bring about new treatments
Most *humans* don't think about their morals
it didn't feel like that to me at all
i know what you mean
wut?
it didn't feel like that to me
... is shield hero really revenge porn?
honestly when you said "offbrand anime" i was thinking "is that like... chinese animation?"
> If you want people to take a single look at After Earth and consider it a Hollywood movie and then never touch Hollywood movies again. Then sure call it a Hollywood movie.
reviewers or redo?
game of thrones showed penis but it's not porn

... wut
The point of the first episode of goblin slayer is showing the stakes and why the main character is who he is
was he ever convicted by a jury?
vic?
that.... feels like a huge stretch to me
i feel like this... is just no
she's a psychopath
psychopaths do this kind of shit
i hear the anime was toned down though
i watched the anime
i'm eating and have to leave for work
i'm not watching a video on it
not by that name no
in terms of violence
i honestly feel like the 2nd episode was as bad if not worse than the 1st
goblins are *actually* evil though
i feel like you completely and utterly missed the point of that
No I'm not
Why not?
They are a different species after all
Why can't their average iq be different
What about mosquitos?
Try to arm wrestle a monkey then
Yeah I simply don't agree
I have a hard time believing that
You're role-playing in a setting where there are different species and the species are meaningfully different from each other
... how?
Evil races have existed in fiction as long as fantasy and simple "good vs evil" stories have existed
I don't feel like I am?
If there are no "stat" differences between races then they're all just humans in cosplay
Omg, different species are different
so like, is Tolkein bad now?
people exist in genetic clusters
race *does* scientifically exist, it's just not at all what "white supremecists" think it is
and the people left behind by the "heroes"
it's about GS
the story isn't about them
white supremecists are gonna white supremecist, the fiction isn't gonna matter
goblins are pests, yes, to *adventurers* not normal people
GS's quest isn't about "fun", it's about saving the people whose lives are destroyed by these "pests"
That's just what you think
I'm not applying phrenology to dnd races
The biggest problem with phrenology is that it is simple false horseshit
I know what that is
it is inevitable
now i just watch sub
was very odd, especially with fullmetal where they changed things up drastically
when i first watched anime if it was in dub i watched it with subtitles
was in my first year watching anime i think
english dub
idk i watched both almost back-to-back a couple years ago
though when brotherhood does it's own thing (relative to 2003) it's done well
i honestly prefer 2003 as a whole
FMB is pretty good except
i absolutely dispised the like first 7 episodes
but like barely
i honestly was a fan of 2003 more
2003 adaptation has a different ending but focusing on the beginning more and a smaller amount of characters
adapted yeah
lol
brotherhood... not so much
2003 starts amazingly
interesting
2003 or brotherhood
fullmetal alchemist?
i mean... AOT ain't over yet
pretty sure the best show is sakura trick
attack on titan is like the
like the
fullmetal of this generation of anime?
idk it's insane
you should
gonna have to watch ochikobore when it finishes
so many good shows
god adachi is sooo good
which seems to be happening more these days
or just be pleasantly surprised when they announce a sequel
> easy
but 2003 is special
like it's good
honestly i think my problem with FMAB
is that compared to 2003
it's kinda... generic?
hard to go wrong with it
*they go bad*
though when fansubs go bad....
fansubs are pretty great too
> jelly donut
well
also subs tend to do less
also wouldn't mind learning japanese some day (it's hard....)
i find reading way easier than listening
i almost always watch english tv with subtitles
it's more reliable anyway
The sci fi yuri anime is coming soon
*laughs in üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è*
https://www.funimation.com/blog/2020/12/09/funimation-to-acquire-crunchyroll-fans-win/
oh wow funi is buying crunchyroll
Citrus
flip a coin
i had a much more interesting mental image of what the world was like and then it was "lol magic vs science"
honestly i watched railgun, really liked it
watched index
and it kind of ruined it all for me
~~and yet index the anime is....~~
omg this
so like k-on
cute girls doing cute things
railgun anime has a lot of CGDCT moments
i also love CGDCT though
'cause honestly i love railgun as a character
and like her friends
are the novels a lot better than the anime?
~~i don't like index mc much either~~
like there's a difference between *random statistic* and *oh shit my pants*
feeling instead of a number
like it depends on the story but i've definitely seen characters who *felt* much more powerful than others even though ostensibly they aren't
OVER 9000
because like
i feel like powerleveling is really hard to do well
OVER 9000
railgun is the best part of the anime
i liked opm season 2 but yeah it wasn't S1
haven't seen s3
maybe the anime just sucks
light novels though right?
jesus wow
~~man that manga's ending~~
i also really like girls last tour
melancholy?
or not so much pain
there is beauty in pain honestly
the anime was honestly one of the most beautiful i've seen
*shhhhhhh*
i need to buy them
and then read them for xmas
but yes no more
there's a sequel but it's not translated
it's 6
i need to read the sukasuka light novels though
maybe i should the light novels
unlike the anime
yeah i think it even finished
love the anime though
i haven't tried the manga yet
~~also kissing~~
seriously i absolutely love the lovey dovey stuff
rip
the best of anime
like
such a good anime
~~no S2 rip~~
i need to read sakura trick someday
i love super lovey-dovey sweet stuff
rip
any of you reading kase-san?
but that gets expensive fast
i also like to buy physical manga
and remember to read it
i need to learn how to read like manga
and remember where i am
> 5.58 rating, 3 min episodes
rip
I should watch more zero's familiar
Also language learning is like 99% memorization which is like the worst skill I have
I find doing things consistently so absurdly difficult
I should find like a Japanese learning group to keep me steady
Total aside but it's why I couldn't stand Nova any more
It's a nice science show but once you actually *understand*
It's just... nice sounding fluff
Then again I'm just a developer who just has to internally cringe whenever people "simplify" technical concepts
But yeah I don't like "localization" much
Though honestly one of the good things about anime
You can hear the original
Other times it's damn near impossible to not use them
Sometimes it's unnecessary
I think it really depends on the story
I don't mind it
*keikaku means plan*
Especially unofficial ones, though those can be very variable in quality
Subs tend to be a lot better about it though
Yes I would learn japanese if I could lol
Especially for "censorship"/"cultural" reasons
Yeah no I don't want to scripts changed
Also something I hate about official subs
They *never* do translator's notes
I know you can go insane with them but
And dubs don't really care about that
I'm very like *keep the original intent of the author*
Also that gamer gate joke they added to dragon maid or something
*jelly donut*
But yeah it's kind of annoying how much they change things in dub
The dub is great but maybe I should watch the original someday
I had to turn subs off for that one
Dub and sub were so ludicrously different
FMA was actually the worst
But yeah when I started watching anime I sometimes watched the dub with subtitles
Which got kind of insane as they sometimes don't match at all
I can't focus on a show without subtitles even if it's in english rip
Like I watch anime in japanese with english subtitles
I highly prefer watching in native language with subtitles at this point
Like hollywood movies/tv shows whatever
I watch english stuff with subtitles
I natively speak English
I should really read more manga though ~~that isn't hentai shorts~~
i watch stuff in my native language with subtitles
also subtitles have literally never bothered me
girls last tour is probably the best case i know of a good manga becoming god-tier when adapted
but yeah voice acting and music
whereas like CGDCT is the best thing to relax to
maybe the biggest problem is i find it hard to build a routine around
i mean same
nah watch seinen
boobs go *brrrr*
i used to read *books* too
also i love music/sound design/voice acting/animation
though i guess it depends on the anime
lol i'm the exact opposite
don't want it to end that quick
i find manga too fast lol
or whatever it's called
then again i have like
0 internal imagery
*pomf*
like anime i can just put it on and just
i'm bad with manga honestly
or no
is this the right place for figure pics
i'm sure there are shows lexi doesn't like
i should post some of my figs
other than yaoi i guess
tbh i like a lot of genres too
>prisma illya
oh i see
so many omg
i do
so like an episode a day
so you were watching anime 2% of the time
also cute anime girls doing cute things
stories are the best
i super love the characters so yeah
ignore them all
WHAT I LOVED IT
lol
unless it's not 105 volumes
no just referring to 105
that's not a lot
nice
my phone has 64gb of space
riko + yohane OTP fite me
^
I would be highly surprised if there wasn't more
There's a movie
like i'm pretty much anime-only for love live
so i'm waiting it out
honestly it seems like a show where the official subtitles are likely to be... less than great
*and no i haven't been watching the current show*
sunshine > ¬µ's maybe?
like i have no idea
the anime?
if it's enjoyable
it is good
like
i swear other people have a different meaning of good than i do
gonna go watch anime
idk, i'll probably rewatch it all someday
*idk i absolutely love/adore slice of life/CGDCT*
also i think when i watched the sunshine movie i was so excited i had to pause it and took like 2 days to watch it
*laughs in youtube-dl*
love live never made much sense to me tbh
but i enjoyed the absolute fuck out of the movie
tbh i'd have to rewatch to remember any of the details
like if the idol is dating someone or not you have the same chances anyway
how do you have that little of a life
like fuck that
i know japan's relationship with idols is... kinda toxic tbh
... it's doujin
> ruined it
what do you mean?
i like immersion and being distracted by actors... doesn't work well with that
i don't keep up with voice actors
argh
also they're kinda anti-doujin which is
i know there's a gacha? ~~i hate gacha~~
honestly like the anime is the only part i know of the franchise?
same <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
> The character antics are fun to watch
there's.... something else in love live?
~~what i hate most about official subs~~
think they subbed all the songs too
don't remember the subs being bad
i watched teamonibe
yeah at least one group resubbed it
like if you like the show you're gonna like the movie
like i *loved* the movie
it's... not much different in quality from the show?
i can only watch like 5 weekly shows at a time
xd
like, longer than i've been watching anime
also i generally wait a *long* time to rewatch stuff
and also so i don't burden myself with remembering every little thing that looks interesting that i might want to watch
the watchlist is really just so i remember where i am
i generally just watch what i want to watch
i have too much stress from work to stress about anime
i watch to enjoy
and your name
i've rewatched like
parts of attack on titan, madoka, and sakura trick
only been watching anime for like 4 years or so
but then again
i rewatch really rarely
if much of anything at all honestly
i don't even know what i watched in high school
i watched re: creators recently in two days
oh i'll still binge stuff
might be why i don't like anime single-shot movies as much
like the characters don't stick with you as well
i honestly don't like doing that with sol
like i'm likely to watch shows unlike that i've seen recently
and i *crave* variety
tbh it's hard for me to watch more than like an episode a day usually
~~i haven't even watched all the kyoani shows~~
the other one isn't
yama no susume's already on my list
4 years?
also i've been watching anime at most like
do you know how many shows there are?
oh the climbing anime
don't think so
idk i.. just. couldn't.... get.. into.... it
maybe it was just aria
but i love non non biyori
oh i had to drop aria
~~so do i catch up with assault lily or start terror in resonance~~
~~maybe i'm just super lonely and that's why i love sol~~
was sooooooo good
honestly good characters >>>>>>>>>>>> everything else
like was the highlight of my week
looked forward to it more than anything else
was my favorite show during the season
so underrated
does anyone remember Slow Start?
i've seen some.... good fanart
~~and a couple dakis~~
other than doujins
Going to watch adachi
I'm going to ignore that
Why'd you have to tell me that
You probably could not have done that without doubling the runtime of the entire show tbf
||I just want to cry||
Yeah the ending made sense to me
Time to watch adachi
And my heart is broken
Also I just watched ep 10 of assault lily
And was fine with the ending
I liked Charlotte
gonna mute discord for an hour
agreed
whyamibadatthis
bye
but yeah for realz i'm gone
casshern sins anyone?
super weird show
cocoa lol
gonna leave terror in resonance for later
i'm gonna watch assault lily
but yeah stop distracting me
even then i fall behind
so yeah, books expensive
was about to buy worldend off of rightstufanime, turns out i'm *just* below the free shipping limit
so... now i'm buying 5 volumes of *If I Could Reach You*
should be good
Just do it
Yes
Go watch k-on and be enlightened
i guess i should force my parents to watch it too
your name good
it's like
god i could probably watch it again
god that movie is good
which is SO GOOD
just make a SOL show after the events of the movie
i wish there was more
KAWAIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIi
it's like
and destroy the city around me
my body might turn matter into energy
like she's so cute
squee so much i implode
i just want to like
like SSSSSSSSSSS level cuteness
like omg
is unreasonably cute
the MC from patema inverted
so also like
it's so good
i watched that recently
made like no sense to me
i actually watched mononoke before i got into anime
trololol
*Graves of the Fireflies*
~~have not yet watched *that* movie~~
ghibli are just okay
fuck it i'll ask in a different channel
like...
like patema
*they do*
but when they do
idk a lot of anime movies don't do it for me
was not the biggest fan
5cm/s was sad
looking at his movies i've only watched a couple
idk i'm glad that i watched it
lol
that was interesting
ah yes *The Garden Of Words/Kotonoha no Niwa*
god do you guys remember its name
i watched "foot fetish: the movie" earlier this year
i don't watch a lot of anime movies tbh
but yeah i should watch some anime movies with my time off
weathering with you is 2019?
i want to know nothing
say nothing or i will stab you
but fuck it i should
i have not either
SAY NOTHING
the anime anyway
demon slayer is no where near complete tbf
literally perfect movies
like
your name is just one of those
~~haven't seen the movie yet~~
XD
demon slayers is 1/10 in comparison
LIKE NOW
WATCH IT OMG
i want more patema fanart!
yeah!
sadly like no fanart
idk your  name is *really* good
xd
god
so
is
design
the sound
and also
like the character development is honestly amazing
*suggest anime to me*
i love the characters in re creators and the variety of characters
also ya know what i'm gonna ask
~~magical girl was one of my favorite characters~~
<:ChrisAngry:336656958272700417>
the entire show is so meta like
is it *really* a recap episode though?
the music is *fucking amazing*
it's just.... they could've gotten a couple more tracks
YES HE'S VJFEREWFSEFSF SUCH AMAZING
||and the MC is SUCH AN IDIOT OMG JFOWFWEFEF||
||sometimes the music while FUCKING BANGER is a little... repetitive||
like i only have 2 real criticisms of it
re creators is so god damned good like my god
*maybe it wasn't for you*
i should watch some anime honestly
and then after shitting on GOT they went to work on star wars and do something similar
and their contracts were air-tight
but for some reason *they* wanted to be the ones to end it
writers didn't want to do it anymore (HBO was like "TOTALLY YES WE'LL DO MORE SEASONS")
actually
it was much worse than that
re: creators has the best mechs fite me
i don't care about mecha tbh
god it wasn't boring at all
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
was crazy good
the middle of franxx
tbh i think the only ending that ever made me irrationally angry was game of thrones
i guess i wasn't *as* dissapointed
i didn't watch it as it aired so
it starting going bad before that honestly
last couple of episodes were disappointing
ehhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
which was
but yeah franxx was honestly kind of amazing until the end
THICC
haven't seen it but
ah girdman
eh i'll add it to the list
kill la kill was acceptable
i need to rewatch kill la kill
makes sense lol
this reminds me of kill la kill
though kiki's delivery service i liked as a kid
but yeah ghibli movies are just... kind of weird
~~watch as on jan 1st you see a sign in the sky~~
yep WE STILL BE IN 2020 BOYS
i still need to watch the zombie idols
i'm honestly just waiting because official subs for songs tend to be.................
<https://myanimelist.net/anime/40879/Love_Live_Nijigasaki_Gakuen_School_Idol_Doukoukai>
fruit tart and the love live
i'll pretty much watch anything but yaoi
the 2 of them
i want to watch that idol anime
oh i definitely do
ATTACK ON TITAN THE FINAL SEASON
also
strike witches, adachi to shimamura, assault lily bouquet
though idk do you have "elitist" taste
definitely more than 3
5 seasonals, 1-2 non
my max is like 5-8
most i've ever watched seasonally is 5
and i can't even keep up with them
THERE ARE SO MANY
like
i have the opposite problem can't do too many seasonal shows
i'm thinking of starting terror in resonance this afternoon
i just need to get away from discord lol
i just need a little reminder
i have though put it in spoilers for the others
and she's just done super well
i love nonstandard villians
is fucking amazing
though tbh the villian
would headpat
she's awesome
i love her
yes i know who she is
like (almost) everything in the show makes sense
i honestly really liked meteora
amazing
damn
I STARTED WATCHING ANIME LIKE FOUR YEARS AGO
i think i literally just saw it on netflix never having watched any mahou shoujo before and was like "sure"
what's wrong with you
BIG ASS FUCKING CODE GEASS MOVIE SPOILER ||i hear kallen didn't die in the movies||
all mine
i'm taking all of them
madoka is just *that* good
WHY MUST YOU ASK ME THESE HARD QUESTIONS
I LIKE BOTH
haven't watched the new stuff
also like
i might rewatch it in sub at some point
i was just starting to watch anime at that point
~~i watched the dub though~~
it's good
and it was *fire*
i watched code geass because i listened to one sound track
also like
and the mal description looked interesting
some artist on pixiv had a *lot* of (sfw) fanart of shana
that
shakugan no shana
fuck
that's how i watched
like seriously sometimes i watch stuff just because i saw good fanart of it
r/anime and... elsewhere
i honestly hear about new stuff on reddit
JAN 13, 2021
and *politics*
and tetora
i want me more akatsuki and minori
A GREAT MIRACLE
YES IT IS
LOG HORIZON SEASON THREE
"Part 2"
"Welcome to 2020"
i'm like 27
jeez y'all are young
linux is '91
i'm '93
rip
no i'm younger
i think
i'm still older than linux
at least 18
how old are you
but i can't read
BIG
so
like
like it's just
don't think i've watched anything else with >100 episodes
might be hunter x hunter?
i think the longest show i've watched
longer than the universe
isn't bleach like
nanoha is like SUPER CUTE though
which was okay
i didn't binge nanoha
i probably wouldn't binge it
like i love it when they PUSH THROUGH THE ODDS
super connecting with the characters
and like
idk what it is with SUFFERING
like SUFFERING
though tbf i love dark magical girls more <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
a lot
i love magical girls
god i want to watch sailor moon someday
while i was babysitting him
like hilarious
it was so lolzyily bad
i think i watched it while my nephew was watching it
lol
didn't get into watching movies/etc much until i got like RSI-ish
i wasn't really into shows much when i was younger
and sadly there is so little mature western animated stuffs
yeah there is great stuff like avatar
a lot of kid's shows... suck
obvious "kid's shows" are..... bleh
and just mature stuff in general
seinen/ecchi
i'm more a fan of like
sameo
and had a life
and did school
i played games
i didn't watch much tv when younger
5 episodes of yugioh and pokemon
other than like
same
S1 of neverland is god damn fire
like
i might wait to binge quintuplets though
HYPE
ALSO QUINTUPLETS
GOD S2 NEVERLAND
i think i would trade away the ability to eat sweets ever again for a catgirl who loves and lusts over me
don't take my sandvich!
time for anime girls in scantily clad santa uniforms!
IT IS CHRISTMAS
because
are not today
though i guess those of us that are working
i'm used to public internet servers being super young
*millenials*
we gots
i'm not so alone!
oh wow it's not just young people!
rip isorn
you're not an adult until you have to pay rent and bills
YURI SCI FI SHOW
oh yeah
attack on titan is *based*
log horizon s3 maybe
i mean sao is a world?
~~just a low detail one~~
a penguin can't fly but it's a bird
non-traditional isekei
it's like
like the first part of sao is kinda isekai
kinda
log horizon is way more of an isekei than sao is
F
is it only in france rip
and is there actually anyone that sells drm free downloads legally?
blu rays are so much space
like star wars
you can have fantasy in space
like anmi's are really cute
i buy a lot of OC artbooks
but they are nice to look at
i have reasons
i really need to organize them
i have a bunch of artbooks
i should look at some of mine
artbooks are good too
holy fuck wow nice
but i love having them!
i don't always read them
i love having books!
also books!
hard drives can store so much more
but no like
~~and dakis~~
i'd rather have figs and tapestries honestly
but yeah fuck that
still a bit expensive
also i don't have a bluray player even
yeah sticking with üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è
and are kinda expensive
blu rays take so much space
when they're that big you see a *lot* of detail
uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh......... ||me||
have you seen the detail on the art lol
JP daki covers are like $120
it's big
pillowcase
CO has a good maki daki too
that i will get at some point
oh and they have others
so you can get if you want
and from dakimakuri so like
$70 each
it's not that much
i just have yohane, ruby, and riko dakis
millh i don't have a ludicrous amount of merch like you
yohane desu!
though names i have a hard time with in general lol
i remember a good deal of them
XD
what are the characters not so memorable that you just remember all of them offhand?
btw
did anybody watch daybreak illusion
idk
now if it goes anywhere with it
this show had *potential*
like i could tell from the first episode
there is potential
^
super smart and making others fall into place
like the MC of code geass
~~and i don't literally mean chess, but like the trope "chessmaster"~~
is there a show with a female chessmaster MC?
but it was just good
i honestly this show could've been *amazing*
would've been better 2 cour
yeah
so *hopes*
at least according to reddit
but apparently the anime was stupid popular in japan
*thigh shots*
also
but i like the characters
honestly the story could use a lot of work
which would be so F
S2 HOPE
Also damn ||apparently they were naked in the bubble for 9 days||
God I'm gonna have to rewatch assault lily
You're fast
which i really need to organize
i threw this into my reading group
strong girls are great
i love good female mcs
gib
like 99% of dakis <$70 are bootleg
legit ones anyway
dakis are generally 160cm
it's life-sized
like a body pillow is as big as me
a grand minimum
and yeah a daki commission is like
And ecchi is an easy way to be like *this isn't a kid's show*
Ya know maybe I just don't like kids shows
Oh he's why I watched it
And no haven't heard of it
So meta spoiler lol
I love contentious shows it seems like
Is it a meta spoiler or something
Scum's wish?
Honestly why I like ecchi shows sometimes
Like zero's familiar s2 spoilers ||we have a minor female character just fucking *kill* someone for revenge in a meaningful way instead of like bs death or making it so that someone else kills them arghhhhhhhhhh||
No
It's refreshing
Like ||omg characters actually have sex with each other in a romance instead of not even kissing each other||
I actually really like it
The show I was trying to remember lol
Ah domestic girlfriend
Oh and what is that other one
Oreimo is one of my favorites
I kinda like incest in my anime honestly
the main character is just an idiot
realistic "human" characters who are just shitty people are awful characters non stop
okay to continue the eva conversation
hmm so scum's wish is already on my watchlist lol
Especially if they don't adapt more
I might try the source material
I mean it does
eh (spoilers ahead) ||i was fine with the on earth stuff, but i had a very different idea where stuff was going and the space stuff was just kinda..... bleh||
XD
except i actually enjoyed franxx
ehhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
tbh for franxx
i really liked half the ending and didn't like the other half
fite me ~~don't actually fite me~~
the best show is madoka
but like
but eh
the ending was not as good as it could have been
KLK is great all the way through
i need to rewatch a proper version that doesn't censor male nipples rip
i watched the netflix version rip
wut
oh kill la kill is great
even if it isn't filled with cute girls
god i love slice of life stuff
idk eva is just one of those things that i'll never understand why people like it
though it gets much better later
i would've dropped brotherhood at the first episode lol
like FMAB
i have a tendency to stay onto shows that are loved by all
like idk i wish i just dropped it
> powerful themes of how to connect with others that have influenced the entirety of anime to this day
also i'll be perfectly honest
*i hated this part*
the (original) movies were pretty much just acid trips
oh and if he actually told them to "fuck off" he'd be better lol
i god damn hate shinji tbh
i don't
like i don't think i've ever... *not enjoyed* an anime more
i said what it felt like
and unrelatable characters
it felt like it was filled with empty symbolism
and it never actually got *better*
hated watching evangelion
i just....
but no I need more rated R mahou shoujo
the ending is.................................................................. okay
daybreak is really good
*Daybreak Illusion* has one of the best first episodes of any anime I have ever seen
but also
it's more of a mahou shoujo than symphogear probably (haven't watched it)
it has magical girls
*utena*
that's what i've been wanting to watch
||EVEN THOUGH IT DESTROYED MY HEART||
I FUCKING LOVE YUYUYU
somewhat dark lesbian magical girls before madoka
i wanna watch
what was it
~~honestly 99.9999% of kids shows are just dumb~~
and i definitely like dark stuff more
madoka was definitely my first mahou shoujo
but that's the best part!
xd
or how about this:
i hate oreimo's ending but it's one of my favorite endings
i wanna read imosae
the worst ending is game of thrones honestly
the entire season
like most shows i watch don't have great endings ~~or don't have a true ending at all~~
i think i judge things by how the show as a whole made me feel
yuyuyu made me cry
it feels like "oh one episode is subpar, 1/10"
i feel like most other people count bad endings *much more* than I do
also just to have a point of general discussion
xd
watch a variety of things so you don't get tired of anything
do what i do
i *really* like dark shows
i'm going to watch this at some point
||also has an actual villian||
it's a lot darker
daybreak doesn't feel like a total clone of madoka to me
i really want to watch tokyo mew mew
i feel like we disagree a lot
wouldn't anyone?
<:ChrisHehehe:688429717019426821>
unless you're picky like mil
you'll probably like it
if you like madoka watch daybreak
9/10
like
god it was really good though
~~i'm salty okay~~
except yuri on ice maybe
but also like i'll seriously watch almost everything
i need lunch
soooo good
oh i love sakurasou
idk sometimes it is good to be disturbed
oh that's just cutely disturbing
~~i know people who would be into that~~
it does everything good to well
i would rewatch it ngl
i feel like i have really unorthodox opinions though
*he wanted to but his publishers wouldn't let him*
the ending made sense
like people hate the ending to aldnoah.zero and i don't get it
i dont' understand a lot of fandoms to be honest
~~i didn't watched it when it aired~~
if he chose kuroneko the show would be unmemorable
here's the thing
weird way of spelling best girl
same with 6
7 is good if like the premise
8 is probably good so should try if uncertain
like 9 is overrated
mal scores for me are just like "does this have huge issues or is it totally overrated"
but it's hard to find someone with my tastes
i don't even have one lol
~~trumpet x eupho is best part of hibike~~
was kinda hard to watch for personal reasons though
the tv series is great
i really like eupho as a whole though
eh it wasn't that good
is that the euphonium one?
liz?
give me good characters to attach myself to
like
i watch shows for characters i think
honestly though i can watch slice of life at the edge of my seat though
your name was never boring for me
but i would probably like it
i have not seen weathering with you so i can neither agree with you or try to destroy you for your opinion
or movie-only i should say
my favorite anime movie is either your name or patema inverted
like maquia was *interesting*
cr is terrible
maquia wasn't bad it just
didn't really hold me
<https://myanimelist.net/anime/35851/Sayonara_no_Asa_ni_Yakusoku_no_Hana_wo_Kazarou> oh this movie?
it was okay
yeah crunchyroll is kinda sus
i'll throw it on
idk it's an 8.6 on MAL
have not heard of that show
like i fucking hate shows that are like "oh look at the cringe! hahahahahahahahaha"
i guess
but like there has to be something *good* in there
i mean i like flawed characters
on list but haven't seen so i can't really comment
i mean.... i hate a lot of humans
lol
who experience pain that you can sympathize with
characters who are relatable and who you can look up to
i like characters who push through the odds
but i like preserverence
not that i like violent stuff
but yeah i like dark and violent stuff
okay that might be too serious for here
"let's do this policy even though it fucks people over but like we don't have to *see* them be homeless/etc"
or like
you can have books be super violent/etc and no one really cares unless it's pointed out because you can't see it
like
like it still happens
idk in my opinion there isn't a huge difference between "implied" and "actual"
like don't make violence into this disney thing
*i actually hate having blood/etc be off screen*
with nazis
that dracula one
is ummmmmm
the only anime i've watched that disgusted me with the gore
or like there's emotional reasons for it
like give me blood and gore *if it makes sense*
though i'm weird on it
me either tbh
and like that cyberpunk movie that made very very little sense
princess mononoke
when i was older i watched like
i mean i watched like kiki's delivery service as a kid
i just didn't really know much about it
all the anime i have at 11/10:
||mahou shoujo madoka magica||
and more focused
2003 is much darker too
ouch
but what they both do 2003 does better
what they do that is unique from each other they do *well*
honestly the thing with FMA
also more FMA(both) spoilers ||the philosopher's stone felt more like a gimmick in brotherhood than 2003||
AoT might be 10/10 depending on how it goes
and read the manga
when AoT finishes i'm gonna need to rewatch it
also other major 2003 spoilers ||i like 2003's villian more, she's more interesting than brotherhoods standard evil villian||
also major 2003 spoilers ||how the homunculi work in 2003 is fucking *dark* and i love it
*having to fight their mother* omg||
also 2003 starts *really good*
but the 2003 version is more..... special
brotherhood is "funner"
i mean
i honestly don't feel aot is overrated at all lol
for a small hot take:
FMA2003 > FMAB
~~it can be solid and overrated~~
<6 is "has mechanical issues probably"
it is *really* good
i watched it a couple months ago so i remember more lol
i binged the show in two days
.... wow
he spoke a lot
he's just not "the focus"
he's annoying but not bland
i don't feel like protag from re: creators is bland
okay lol
~~i generally pay attention when i watch stuff~~
as long as it's done well
i don't mind mysterious stuff
~~and idk i don't remember it having that problem~~
does the LN explain anything?
mahouka honestly has amazing technology and setting
but yeah lol
oh i definitely can
i've heard good things about this show
like the last good scifi book I read was *The Mote in God's Eye* like a year ago
*insert "you need an IQ above 3 quadrillion to understand rick and morty meme"*
honestly it's too hard to find actual sci fi outside of books
it's just fantasy in space
i don't even consider star wars to be scifi
also like damn i need more hard sci-fi in my life
yeah it sounds to be that way
and probably won't honestly
i didn't try to watch S3
i've heard the light novels are a lot better
touma has an interesting premise but mehhhhhhhhhhh
~~it's because the vast majority of the time it's not actually magic vs science, but "magic-flavored magic vs science-flavored magic"~~
index anime is no exception, though it's at least *slightly* less dumb
i honestly hate "magic vs science" most of the time
omg yes
and the bug arc is one of the best in anime omg
like there are no episodes that are just *bad*
hunter x hunter is amazing in how long it is and yet it's quality floor stays pretty high actually
even with binging took me months
148 episodes is *long*
hunter x hunter is great but likely to be the longest show i'll ever watch

Samus's suit doesn't look like a anime highschool girl
