So if anybody's interested, I've been working on a webcomic for the past couple months, and it's finally ready to see the light of day. I'm thrilled to announce my upcomic Webtoon project: Beyond the Sable Shore!
https://archiveofourown.org/works/34917985
What's this? Me writing a fanfic for a fandom *other* than Symphogear? Insanity, I tell ya!
Thanks! Future chapters will be substantially longer, but I figured this would be a nice snappy intro

WOOO!
glad to help. Best of luck!
sometimes it's hard to know what title best represents your story until you've spent so much time writing it that you're intimately familiar with it
often, the title is what comes last for me
and no one else's
specific as in, when people see this title, they will only think of your story
generally speaking, the more specific you can get with your title, the better
agreed lol
also keep in mind the themes you're going for; those can really guide you to a good title
That's a good start!
because that's such a specific word you don't see used a lot, it stands out
for example, the webcomic I'm currently writing is called Beyond the Sable Shore, named after the protagonist Sable
One thing I like to try and do is get at least one hyper-specific word in my title to make it stand out
2) an important object or symbol in the story that really represents what it's about
1) a particularly important quote from the story itself (whole quote or just a snip)
some ideas I use
Beyond the Sable Shore's next chapter is out!

The crisis of being a writer who plans far in advance is that I've got so many incredible moments I'm just dying for you to see, but some of them will take over a decade to see the light of publication.

I've come to the conclusion that my dream for Beyond the Sable Shore is for it to grow popular enough to spawn smutty fanworks and edgy animatics set to Angel with a Shotgun
not sure what that says about my ideal level of success but hey
i c
how so fake
otherwise tho the pizza looks great!
oof

That French Wikipedia page is wrong, I'm afraid
i hope so too, I've heard it gets even gayer as it goes on
god dammit that comic gave me diabetes
ganbare shamiko
so either you need a butt-ton of translator's notes or some very extensive localization
Monogatari's just a hard show to sub overall because the dialogues is full of puns and wordplay and double meanings inherent to the Japanese language
I was fine with the official sub
<:HibikiGay:670494484701773845>
shinobu, I believe
Miku dating sim, make it happen

holy shit gintama
god bless visqui
baby can't you see, you could be with me...
you shattered my heart tonight, I hope you're happy
and the story everyone wrote around it
i was talking about the previous hibimiku pic
why you do this to my heart
<:MikuBliss:336657233712513024>
yoooo
OH GOD IT'S TOO PERFECT
best comic
you are too powerful for any mortal
it better get an anime soon
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
wait, it's Miku's birthday?
fuyukai desu
my heart is full tonight
why would I want to when you're right
guys you can't do this to me my heart's gonna explode
oH
you are going to murder me oh my GOSH
eeeeeeeeeeee
I swear I've seen that art style before...
my heart... is so full...
Tamen de Gushi is great, everyone should read it
skdjhfskdjfhds SHUT UP
yep
I think it's that Miku's dressed as a character who, well... doesn't have the happiest ending
I think Hibiki can help her with that...
Them
<:ShirabeCry:671887081026617345>
KUMIREI
hence, them
I love Them
just them
them
ksdhkajsdhkajsdjhkasd

that's very good
oh that's good
this picture makes me so happy
Diakko good
We all know Jaune would never do Phyrra dirty like that
in spoilers: ||not yet, but we can still hope||
and seeing those evolutions happen in real time must be wild
because it has evolved *so* much from its first volume
Honestly, I think it would be so cool to re-watch all of RWBY when it's finally over
nice!
season 8's going really strong so far
most of his pics are NSFW, so be wary of that
definitely Afrobull
accurate
perfection
I am far too soft for this
why would I, you're not telling any lies here
Best thing to wake up to
so... much... hibimiku
so... much... hibimiku...
OH MY HEART
Y'all have been letting me wake up to Hibimiku goodness for days on end now and I super appreciate it
woooooah
np
It's called Kiss It Goodbye, and the whole thing's available on Webtoon.
did you know they're currently publishing a weekly Webtoon about gay schoolgirls?
aaaaagh I love Ticcy's work so much
Amanda gets all the girls
head to NSFW to see it
ALRIGHT FOUND IT
lemme see if I can find it and post it in NSFW
yep
what a god
God, I still think about how LWA's creator drew a piece of NSFW Diakko fanart

the faces are definitely similar to her style
Is that Lily's art?

I love how you can easily tell which one is EdgeBikki in all of those pictures

oH
i see
👀
he drew a piece of NSFW Diakko fanart
sort of, yeah
no canon yuri, sadly, but it's definitely very headcanon-friendly in that regard
Can I just say, I fucking love the way this artist draws Hibimiku
Shirayuki Tomoe
They're from Nijisanji, Sukuya and Tomoe
they're so good
Nijisanji VTubers who are almost certainly IRL gay for each other

tHEM
Mage and Demon Queen... good
It do be like that
absolutely beautiful
same
RWBY'S really fun
oh that one's a classic
eeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
so... much... hibimiku...
<:YumiPoint:688429724103344164>
There's a translated version of it on Youtube somehwere, let me find it...
Ufotable's adaptations are arranged around you starting from Zero
counterpoint: yes start from Zero
it's the result of a bunch of passionate people pouring their creative energy into something and always working to improve and stay fresh
and now RWBY is fucking enormous
Rooster Teeth, its parent company, was still a pretty small indie web studio when they started on RWBY
It's also really cool how RWBY basically built itself into a phenomenon from nothing
I like it a lot
RWBY is incredibly fun, and its messiness mostly comes from taking big, ambitious storytelling risks that not many shows even attempt
it was for me, I really liked their arc
??
they remind me so much of Hibimiku, it's scary
my favorite part was the dynamic between Rosemary and Sage
cause the backlash and harrassment was so extreme that they were scared to put it out, I'm pretty sure
I bring this up because I've found that 95% of people talking shit about HGS haven't actually watched it, they've just watched other people talking shit about it
fair enough
Because I did, and it's nowhere near as bad as you're making it out to be
quick question, have any of you actually watched HGS to completion?
eeeeeeeeeeeeee
Also, is that Lily's art? It looks a lot like it
For those interested
https://archiveofourown.org/works/31231745
now I'm remembering the fic I wrote about Hibiki being nervous about being a mom and getting emotional again
<@!236944855828398080>
this is an art channel, not a post whatever tweet channel

**OH SHIT WAIT THIS IS THAT ONE ARTIST I LOVE SO MUCH**
OH NO
there's so much Hibimiku
oh no
>checks their pixiv
please tell me there's a longer comic to that picture
for now tho, art
if we wanna keep talking about it, serious discussion would be the place, I think
some of these losers make Steven Universe fans seem reasonable by comparison
you don't know the half of it
you can't really skip any volume, there's plenty of important story beats in all of them

tbh you don't need to ping me for much, I've got both art channels unmuted and se everything that gets posted
god I love my girls
Hibike is one of my top 10 anime of all time
not that I'm complaining
I see the Hibike news has inspired a fanart dump, lol
aaaaaaaagh my heart

same tbh
yes good
aaah, good old korrasami
cause that's definitely the Angel Beats school uniform
why she be looking like Angel Beats tho
the timing just seems perfect for it
though I highly suspect something like this scene *will* play out in volume 9
it is a nice photo, I was being jokey
wow, tag your volume 9 spoilers, smh
very few things in my life have topped reading that moment for the first time
I'm still just in awe at how Bionicle's final battle ended with ||a planet-sized titan getting his head caved in by a moon||

I mean we live in the worst timeline where this movie didn't happen
we were robbed with that not happening
bruh lmao
tell me that wouldn't be at least somewhat interesting
now I'm picturing an otherwise traditional mecha series where the protagonist gets in the robot to fight aliens or whatever, but instead of a normal mecha suit, their robot is a big mechanical anime waifu

gorgeous

whoops lol
I feel like this should not be in sfw <@236944855828398080>

*accurate
dai-dai-dai- DAIsuki, to be most accurant
Cripes, you should probably get to sleep
I gotcha
neat
Oh, so are you plural? If you don't mind me asking.
For example, you can't shout "fire" in a crowded theater, because that would cause a panic and likely get a lot of people hurt
And from what I last recall checking, biden's still ahead in most battleground states too
it was just the attleground states going fucky that screwed it up
Also don't forget Hillary still beat him by 3 million votes, so the national polls were still mostly correct in that case
Not to this consistency
that's not exactly "crushing his wrinkly skull"
You realize Biden's still beating Trump in almost every poll, right?
But it wasn't a serious problem until March
This was happening before Covid was an issue in the US tho
they just didn't show up to vote
Young people didn't even turn out for Bernie in the primary tho
^^^
Hillary got taken down because of literal DECADES of shit-mongering attacks from Republicans who did everything they could to destroy her image from the moment she entered the public eye
At least with a Dem in the presidency, there's a better chance of getting leftist policies on the table
But I will take him over literally anyone the Republicans could possibly run
Trust me, I know Biden's far from the best option.
or the satisfaction of wasting your time
You don't bother giving them the time of day
You don't
From my experience, the alt-right is very good at taking somewhat legitimate-sound criticisms and twisting them to the worst possible conclusions
ayup
Nah, just some racist dickbag
And people mistook him for one of the police officers responsible for killing George Floyd, so it blew up
Some asshat was wearing a hat with that slogan
Sadly, no
They're either ignorant or malicious, and frankly at this point there's little distinction between the two
Happy to help in whatever small way I can.
It absolutely sucks, and I feel your pain
Postponing a graduation trip to Universal Studios
I've had a couple of those re:the whole virus thing lately
Is this just an "in general" question, or is it something you're dealing with at the mo?
And yet to the best of my knowledge the rioters haven't killed anyone
Because literally nothing else has worked
Then what do you suggest they do
If it takes trashing a target to make people listen, so be it
They are DYING
And NO ONE is listening
You thunk ANY of them don't know who they're up against
You think they don't know that
Actually, considering how fucked wages are in the US, unemployment benefits probably WOULD pay the bills better
Stiiiiiiill not good
Agreed
Trying to intimidate Twitter into treating him with kid gloves
It's a symbolic gesture more than anything
It's in the constitution
He can't
Twitter doesn't have to do shit he says
it ain't constitutional
That much I know for sure
Well, it wasn't their own tea they were dumping into the harbor
dressed in redface too, if I recall
They totally did
And no one is
Not if no one listens to them
They didn't even arrest the cop who murdered him until the riots started
Peace didn't work
We tried peace
protesting racism is not the same as being racist
Oh for fuck's sake, this "both sides" rhetoric needs to die
^^^
maybe take a seat on this one and let black AMericans sort it out themselves
So unless you're gonna put your own body on the line to try and stop these issues
And it's not okay that you seem more concerned with protecting white feelings than black lives
It's not okay that the system supports racism
It's not okay that black people are getting murdered
You're right
The cops have
what do you think the answer is
that's all I want to know
PLEASE
then what IS the answer
the protests didn't even turn violent until the police attacked them
that's literally what they're DOING
What do you honestly think the protestors should do instead of what they're doing?
Okay, Aira, legitimate question
And you're doing the same
Now you're just projecting
It might not be the best option, but right now, it's looking like there may not BE any other options
even if you don't realize it
The thing is, you ARE downplaying it
and it is not "compassionate" to downplay that trauma and that oppression
and BUILDING
and BUILDING
this has been BUILDING
that STILL haven't gone away
of racist oppression
this was CENTURIES
this was not the drop of a hat
...Aria
which is bullcrap in this situation
It basically means "he didn't mean to kill him"
sadly true
this is also true
but as far as I know no innocent bystanders have been harmed yet
the Minneapolis police building got burned down
shit got crazy
but then the cops started getting rough with them, so the protests turned violent
People came out and protested in a bunch of cities, initially peacefully
and this was the straw that broke the camel's back
which has been a pressure keg building for a long-ass time
Essentially, we just had another slew of cops killing black people for no good reason
As in, why they're happening, or what's happening in them?
woah, even I didn't know that yet
it
A lot of the rioters have set up stations to distribute the stuff they grabbed to people who need ir
Yeah, that's true Emily
For a lot of people, the price of trying to tough it out nonviolently isn't worth it anymore
so many innocents have already gotten hurt
It's worth keeping this in mind, I think: your worst days don't define you
Could easily be fake, let's wait and see what actually happens first
because we're all stuck in place less we get virus'd to death
the oil prices were low because no one's going outside to drive
woah, that's unfair

Good news re: employees of the Target that got trashed in Minneappolis
ah okay, my bad
Trust me, if the worst thing you have to deal with in Pride Month is being more aware than usual about the existence of LGBT people, you have nothing to complain about
^^^
America won't survive another Trump term
At this point, if Biden doesn't win in November, I honestly think there might just be straight-up civil war
As long as you're both clear on what those boundaries are and are comfortable with them
In that case, I think it's fine to have boundaries
So this is an open relationship sort of deal you're picturing?
To be clear, do you mean they've slept with a lot of people before being in a relationship with you?
Again, I guess it depends on what about that makes you uncomfortable
I dunno
I don't think it's wrong to want less sex in your life, if that's what you're getting at
I guess it would depend on why that makes you uncomfortable
I got lucky, this article was right at the top of my twitter feed when you posted that
Yeah, unfortunately true
https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/factcheck/2020/05/27/fact-check-olive-garden-not-funding-donald-trumps-2020-campaign/5261247002/
You might wanna fact-check some of those
We need a system that doesn't reward bad police and kick good police out
Oh for sure, it's an iffy statement any way you look at it
but I think it's pretty clear he's talking about people who aren't carrying gns
Which is a verbal flub, yeah
Find the whole video and listen to it, his actual words were about "unarmed protestors carrying knives"
And most of the so-called "revolutionaries" are actually bootlickers who just didn't like the fact that there was a black man in the white house for eight years
No matter how you slice it, that's a hard-ass deficit to overcome
Right now, I'm just holding onto the optimism that even Fox "News" polls have biden leading by a whopping twelve points
2020 redemption arc has officially begun
hoo boy
who are we hoping wins
so they're social democrats with an authoriatarian edge. You could almost describe them as... national socialists or something
what a dorkwad
imagine thinking this'll win him the reactionary vote
fwiw, I have Asperger's as well, so if you ever want to chat about it I'm happy to do so
A lot of my family's Jewish so we celebrate a lot of the holidays, but not all of us practice the religion

from what I heard, the guy basically admitted he was guilty already
I'm rough when it comes to conflict among my friends as well, I always prefer it doesn't happen
No, it just makes you human
that never ends well

Netflix just fucked up th poster royally
It's a French film called Mignonnes, and it was very popular at Sundance a while back
Just so you know, this isn't a Netflix original movie
||and a subtle pattern of internalized misogyny that indirectly worsened her mental state, to be fair||
I actually quite enjoyed the first season, but I never watched past that
||She's basically saying, "you are all in some part responsible for driving me to suicide, and here's me telling my story to explain why"||
both Netflix's poster and the original poster are in this article, if you want more context
https://deadline.com/2020/08/netflix-apologizes-inappropriate-cuties-poster-criticized-sexualizing-children-1203018498/
Basically they scooped up a popular foreign fic for their catalogue and someone in marketing decided "Hey, how can we market this in the worst way possible?"
I have never heard anyone use the phrase "cultural marxism" except as a coded word to insinuate that jews/minorities/etc are secretly behind all the evil in the world
we can laugh as people unironically spoiting Nazi ideology, Aria
I can assure you it's not
no it's not
Trump's guys, on the other hand?
they ain't perfect, but they ain't completely evil either
Keep in mind, Democrats were responsible for the greatest modern push towards Medicare for All just a decade ago
I repeat: if saying that black lives matter sounds like "*only* black lives matter" to someone, the problem isn't the slogan, it's them
If someone saying "black lives matter" makes you think they're saying other lives don't, the problem isn't the slogan, I feel, it's you
And I think that's worked pretty well
I accept that there are some things I will never get, and some times where the only thing I can do is shut up and listen
what I've come to terms with as a cishet white dude with, like, all the privileges, is that there are times where I'm just gonna have to trust women, people of color, lgbt people, etc, when they talk about their experiences and tell me what they need from me
but we can do our best to listen and learn from those who *have* gone through it
we can't, really
<:ZweiHug:672455346949980170>
That's great to hear!
we all know Hibiki would punch the shit out of Nazis
<:Zababies:672238628398956594>
We're here for you
<:Zababies:672238628398956594>
it's certainly not all the backlash, but it's fanning the flames something fierce
there is 100% a political op going on here
Tons of tweets that read almost exactly like that on the #cuties tag
especially since bad-faith actors were doing their best to muddy what the film was actually about
That's okay, it's an understandable reaction
any community-based tool is too easy to exploit and lie with
hence why I'm only trusting the words of people who've actually seen the film at this point
these people are trying to piss you off for their own ends
it should
tons of people saying "republicans are watching Trump's ralley today, while pedo democrats are watching Cuties"
it's already going on on twitter
oh, it's no conspiracy
Frankly, I don't trust the opinions of anyone who hasn't actually seen the damn thing at this point
This backlash has been inflamed and hijacked by alt-right trolls looking to make people pissed because they hate Netflix for "supporting cultural marxism" or some shit
Like, notice how he makes a point of saying "BaRaCk ObAmA wAs InVoLvEd"
...I don't think I'd trust any source coming from a republican congressional candidate
Netflix just licensed it for streaming after the fact
It's a foreign film that even went to Sundance
You realize this wasn't a Netflix-funded project, right?
So, I guess also fuck the female Senegalese director who directed the film based on her personal experience?
"no, no, I'm not racist, I'm just voting to stick it to Washington elites!"
He just gave them a convenient excuse to pretend that wasn't what they were doing
and frankly, a lot of Americans didn't need any excuses to hate minorities for Trump, because they already did
Because he successfully convinced them that their real enemies were the Jews and women and minorities demaning equal rights and "theatening American (white) values"
And they voted for the worst snake oil salesman of them all
I've seen this country's unraveling with my own eyes
then please don't imagine you know better than I do
I repeat: are you American?
are you American?
he won because my country has always been extraordinarily racist and sexist
Trump didn't win because of muddled neoliberalism
okay, no
Biden's far from perfect, but I'll take him over an active fascist any day
honestly, Im getting kind of sick of people saying it doesn't matter who wins the election
Sorry, you can absolutely choose a better choice ebtween them
...between a boring middle-of-the-road candidate and a fascist?
we have spiral way off topic at this point tbh
ending the great recession and getting us the closest to universal healthcare we've gotten? sure, nothing but neoliberal garbage
correction: 2 years of progress and 6 years of republicans oobstructing literally everything Obama tried to do
thank you, electoral college bullshit
and yet he still lost by 3 million votes
compared to everything else he ran on, it was barely an afterthought and he rarely brought it up
only very vageurly
and the rust belt still voted for him
he explicitly *rejected* a lot of those things
Funny story: Trump didn't run on any of those things eithe
Also, kindly don't refer to my opinions as garbage
that seems pretty changey to me
He's offering extensive LGBTQ+ rights expansions, for one thing
now Biden's regularly 6-8 points ahead in every poll, sometimes even more
Until the pandemic, he and Biden were almost polling neck and neck
and trust me, there was far less pushback against Trump from these guys than you think until recently
I'm not villifying them, I'm saying what's going on with them
He's still going to get at least 30% of the popular vote
and even then? A lot of his supporters are still with him
all the horrible things Trump's done over his presidency, and it took *a global pandemic* for some of them to finally jump ship and realize, "oh, this guy's just an asshole"
and look at how much it took
because Trump's finally broken their trust
because he was being an uppity black guy telling them their work wasn't done
and then it wasn't, and Obama kept talking about how racism was still an issue that needed to be solved, and all those rust belt white guys who voted for him got super-pissed
They thought, oh, we'll elect a black president and racism will be solved forever
simple: people thought electing Obama would be "racism's end"
that's not unique to Trump
every president says they'll improve the system, and some of them do in small ways
That's how *every* president wins
they say as they vote for the man with a literal gold-plated toilet
It is built for two parties
keep in mind, America's system is not built like a lot of Europian systems
it's just not gonna happen
they will *never* feel a threat of losing to the Greens
sometimes that means voting for a middling option because the only alternative is a million times worse
with all due respect Aria, I'd prefer to fix our world up here before worrying abotu the afterlife
"I'd rather go to hell on Earth than go to hell in the afterlife"
Not ideal, but it's a goddamn start
Biden's put out a plan to get us to 100% renewable energy by 2050
shame America isn't run on conscience
well, I'm glad you got to vote your conscience
i'm not even talking about you specifically, Aria, just in general
but that doesn't mean you sit back and let the worse option win
sometimes, no viable choice is that appetizing
if you let Perfect be the enemy of Good, you're only ever going to get the worst outcome
our system just isn't built for it
they've never worked ever since the Civil War
third party politics just do not work in the US
if every personw ho voted Green in florida voten for Hillary instead, she would've taken the state and the election as well
Iknow HIllary and Biden would't be perfect presidents, but FUCK, they'd be better than this
countless people I don't even know have died because of Trump
one of my family's friends died from Corona
like, my countrymen are literally dying of plague right now
and sometimes doing so condemns thousands of innocept people to death at the hands of a fascist autocracy
third parties cannot survive winner-takes-all like american has
it absolutely SUCKS, but that's the system we have
the only person who gets seats is the person who wins the MAJORITY- meaning over 50%- of votes
there's no proportional "if your party wins x percentage of votes, you get x percentage of seats" deal
the problem is, America's voting system is a zero-sum game
so we work with what we got and push for better where we can
I wish we had a ultiple party system, but we don't
it's such a broken, outdated process and we need to abolish it
it's not viable to rely on them
there are all sorts of laws and systems in place to keep electors from going rogue
right new we need every single democrat in office to use McConnel's tactics against him and refuse to fill RBG's seat until after the election
this could irreparably change the way the constitution is interpretated, in favor of fascists and bigots
supreme court decisions set lifelong precedents
supreme court is lifetime appointment
If Trump gets to nominate another supreme court justice, a full third of the highest judicial power in the US will be Trump appointees
https://twitter.com/AP/status/1307101095446147075

welcome to Sankaku complex
the hilarious thing is, the only people I've *actually* seen complaining about this stuff are right-wing VTube fans who want to gatekeep the fandom and keep it "untainted by evil Western influence" or some shit
lol, sankaku complex is garbage
I think we're gonna make a stand
If even Schumer's playing hardball?
https://twitter.com/SenSchumer/status/1307104888963428357
I wouldn't be too sure about that
a lot of either don't think the virus actually exists or is far less deadly than it actually is
it sure is
it's purely emotion and willful ignorance
there is nothing logical about it at all
"so everyone opposing him is the source of all evil"
and their belief is "Trump is ordained by God and everything he does is good"
they adjust the facts to fit what they already believe
with these people, they don't adjust their beliefs to fit the facts
at least that's as best I can figure it out
the Deep State(tm), aka the eeeeevil Jews/lgbtq+/minorities that are secretly pulling all the strings
MAGA brainrot is something to behold
pretty much yeah
taking the GOP's slide toward fascism to its natural conclusion
Trump's just the culmination of all that
with Fox "News" and countless propoganda internet sites like Breitbart
the republican party has been brainwashing their followers pretty much since the 90s, maybe earlier
keep in mind, this isn't just trump
yep
aka "draining the swamp"
their "belief" is that Trump is clearing the Deep State out
no one was charged for actually killing her
not even for her death, for endangering her neighbors
Thanks, guys, your advice means a lot to me

I'm curious, are there any other enbies or otherwise gender-non-conforming people on this server who feel similarly re: feeling mostly one gender but some of another gender too?
It's been pretty weird to wrap my head around
I've considered myself a guy pretty much all my life, but recently, I've started feeling that I might be, like 10% female as well, if that makes sense
So... I'm starting to think I may be slightly nonbinary
we can't afford complacency this year
god yes, everybody in this country vote
From most of my interactions with libertarians, their solutions mostly seem to involve giving corporations more freedom
I will say, I don't entirely trust the overall Libertarian Party to hold corporations accountable either
Libertarians aren't all of the same opinion, same as any other political party

people criticizing your position does not equal hate
I wouldn't be blaming anyone else for "attacking"
Aria, you're the one who came into this conversation saying "fuck you" to the people who disagreed with you
I can work on pushing them to the left while also acknowledging that there's only one candidate in this election who has a shot at knocking Trump out
you think I'm not?
You don't seem to be doing much to stop him, though
and i'm getting real sick of watching a fascist tear my country apart so i guess we're all unhappy
I know
I mean they're super-understanding and really supportive

you assume they actually care about "small government"
well, in her case, specifically for Biden and working party dems down the ballot
convince people to vote, offer advice on how to vote, resources, ways to convince friends/family to vote, etc

AOC is streaming Among Us to get out the vote, politics has officially entered the modern age
https://www.twitch.tv/aoc
fucking hell, britain
plus, lots of states have only just started counting mail-in ballots
there are nowhere near enough votes counted to get any sort of accurate assessment yet
true, true
meaning he needs 35 more electoral votes to win
which I *believe* puts his current EV total at 236
i saw that as well, yeah
It's all gonna depend on how many mail-in ballots are left to be counted and how drastically they swing the pendulum in Biden's favor
"So to summarize a bit, Biden basically has three “easy” paths to victory remaining. In rough order of likelihood: 1) Win Arizona and NE-02, hold Michigan and Wisconsin; 2) Win Pennsylvania, hold Michigan and Wisconsin; 3) Win Georgia, hold Michigan and Wisconsin.

Less likely paths would involve his winning North Carolina, or other scenarios where he loses Wisconsin or Michigan but does well enough elsewhere."
Here's an analysis of the current situation from Nate Silver
props to my brother who lives in AZ and helped make that happen
at this point it's pretty much assumed they'll go blue always
Hawaii's been solid blue forever
Alaska's a pretty reliably red state
And from what little I've seen, I'm still hopeful
Like I said above: it's all gonna come down to how many mail-in ballots are left and how dramatically they swing things toward Biden
he's flipped tons of them
Biden's been outperforming Trump in a whole shitton of counties
he has lost supporters, though
and I refuse to give them that
the GOP wants us to be scared they;re more powerful than they are
This is especially true of Wisconson and Michigan; their mail-in results are only just being tabulated as we speak
that Biden was down in key states and Trump was gonna win after all
Lank, it's worth considering that many republicans forced their states to count mail-in ballots last because they wanted to make this exact impression
If he does that, plus likely wins in Nevada and Maine, he'll win the election
What it comes down to is Biden's gonna have to win at least 2 of the following states: Pennsylvania, Wisconson, North Carolina, Georgia, and Michigan
It's gonna take at least a few days, maybe weeks
source on that?
only the second Dem to win it since 1948
confirmed by multiple parties
yep
god dammit Ben you're not allowed to be reasonable
not called yet
because most of the mail-in ballots in those states? like the vast majority?
yes, that
because our constitution was designed by slaveowners who didn't want to piss off slave-ownings states, basically
Biden wins even if he loses everything else
if AZ and Nevada stay blue, which looks likely, that's the ballgame
well hello
https://twitter.com/CNNPolitics/status/1324098517435113473
god Georgia's gonna be down to the fucking wire
Pretty sure it means "Penn's Woods," after William Penn, the guy who founded it
neither do I, and I live in PA
he's going to get *really* ahead there
And PA is looking even more promising
literally all Biden has to do now is get at least 10% of the remaining votes and he'll pull ahead
yep
Yo the vote difference in Georgia is down to just 3,500 in Trump's favor or so
they're so pathetic holy fuck
They usually don't report outright lies, but other than that, they're pretty much the Fox News of print journalism
NY Post is...okay, if incredibly right-leaning and prone to uncritically promote conspiracy theories without giving necessary context behind them
just in case it's fake
okay DO YOU HAVE A SOURCE FOR THAT
That's what I get for not checking the source
oof, looks like I might have been wrong on that Trudeau stuff. My bad.
Trudeau just said he's lend military support if Trump refuses to leave, so that's something
after that, the real work begins
at least, getting Trump out of office will let us all breathe easier
we're holding on
So this is what hope feels like
<:VanessaCracked:639136452600397829>
what a loser
ahahahaha those tweets
Looks like they all finally decided he was going to win PA, which easily put him over the top
called by CNN, NBC and AP
most of the ones in the middle are just a couple cities surrounded by vast expanses of fuck all
not too much, honestly
Both of those sights are incredibly biased in favor of Trump and ultra-right-wing in general
Also, using Parler and The Federalist as your sources... doesn't exactly make your claims seem more credible
Project Veritas is unqualified hot garbage and shouldn't be taken as a reliable source for anything
Colorado's been running on a pure mail-in ballot system since before Trump
There... there have been mail-in ballots for years now
"moderate Trump supporter" there's an oxymoron and a half
it's about forcing a Trump win through whatever means work
it never was
Because this is not about finding out the truth
because they are deluded
they will still believe in it
no matter if it's proved beyond any reasonable doubt that Trump s 100% wrong
Let me let you in on a secret: they're going to believe it's stolen no matter *what* investigation is held
you cannot be this deluded
are you fucking serious

In terms of Ferris, I'm not an expert, but the convo around them being trans is definitely... complicated
coding can reinforce bad stereotypes, but it doesn't have to
note this can be positive, negative or neutral in execution
example: Garnet from Steven Universe is an alien, but her wide hips, afro, and darker skin are coding that make her seem like a black person
Alright, so "coding" basically means that a character is designed with certain quirks that are supposed to make them recognizable as part of a certain group or subgroup
explain how?
no need to throw *actual slurs* around, even just using them as examples
oooooooooooook, dino, back it off a bit

the sad thing is, I used to be a huge fan of Vic's performances
even though these accusations have been circling him for *years* and there was plenty of evidence
they cast Vic as Naofumi, unfairly put upon, and his accusors as Myne, evil bitches just looking for drag him through the muck
and a bunch of raging dickwads said he was being unfairly accused and everyone was lying just to tear him down for... reasons
he was a famous English dub voice actor, but he was recenty outed as being a sex pest and possibly a pedophile as well
Vic Mignogna, have you heard of him?
while his primary antagonist is a misogynistic caricature of what raging incels think women who don't want to date them are like
not to mention him being a Heroic Slave Owner who's slaves all fall in love with him
And everyone who isn't completely on his side is presented as evil by the narrative
In my eyes, the core of Shield Hero is that the entire plot and situation is artificially constructed to make the most over-the-top hateable people for Naofumi to get revenge on
It did to me, and to a lot of other people, but we can have different interpretations

Redo of Healer is basically hentai that gets to call itself "anime" because it airs a censored version on network TV. I would not blame anyone for enjoying it as a trashy indulgence, but if anyone tried to seriously defend it? Yeah, I'd look at them funny.
Some gay people have reclaimed it and use it to describe themselves
kiiiiinda?
thank god
Where they don't have to feel scared to explore their identities
Self-discovery can be tricky, and that's why I think it's a great thing we're getting to a point where kids *can* talk about this stuff in the open
I'm confused what you mean
(although there's still plenty of bigotry and societal oppression we need to fix)
It's that more LGBT people are getting comfortable expressing that identity in public because the risks of being victimized for it are shrinking
So it's not that there are more LGBT people nowadays than there were in the past
Now that it's becoming more accepted? More people are comfortable saying who they are, loud and proud
But because of persecution and oppression, most of them kept it hidden
There have always been gay, trans, nb people throughout history
Short version? People are getting less afraid to be true to their identities because it's becoming more accepted

oh my fucking god Hunter Biden took a picture of himself having a threesome with a squirtle plushie in the background
I'm lucky that my parents love me for who I am and don't try to force me to be something I'm not

I can imagine how that must suck

Pretty sure he got started with nitpicky RWBY "criticism"
Yeah HH had been a known shithead for a while
not everyone, though
it used to be a while back, but a lot of the LGBT+ community has reclaimed it by now
I mean, "Gay" used to just mean happy
words and their meaning can change over time
The one good thing of being on Twitter is that I very quickly learned which sites are Bullshit
WashEx is like fox/post with even less plausible deniability
WashEx is one of them
Yeah,  there are some sites I've noticed crop up only to spread right wing talking points with varying degrees of subtlety
WashEx is a trash site
Aaaaand instantly I know it's not worth engaging with
>Washington Examiner
in practice today... it means Republicans stonewall everything and refuse to let shit get done
Hypothetically, it stops bad bills from becoming laws because there are plenty of ways for everyone to stop them
I think you need a 2/3s majority to override a veto?
and then the legislature can decide to overwrite that overwrite if there's enough agreement
the idea is the executive should have the power to step in and stop the legislature from passing something if it seems like a bad idea
It's checks and balances
well, the unanimous vote means that veto's likely to be overruled, right?
They're responsible for most of the lynchings that occurred in the Jim Crow era, among lots of other awful shit

so, poop-related medical question: ||should I be concerned if my poop is grey and kinda diarrhea-y?||
the GG crowd will never stop so long as it's a good grift
And in case it wasn't bad enough already, a lot of the prominent alt-right sites and people that gained prominence off of GamerGate- Milo Yannapolis, Steve Bannon, Breitbart, Ben Shapiro- were the same people who later helped usher Trump into office
Take it from someone who saw Gamergate unfold in real time: it absolutely was
I remember there was a channel I used to watch called Amazing Athiest who ended up going GG/alt-right, I'm lucky I dropped him before he could indoctrinate me too
He's not wrong tho
but there are far too many complete morons
There are reasonable critics, for sure
Vyn take it from someone who's been in the RWBY fandom for years, the critic hatedom *is* that extreme
But from what I've heard, it leans hard into the same "M and K ruined Monty's vision" bullshit that Pug was just talking about
In all fairness, I haven't seen the video itself, I've just read/heard other people talk about it
oh joy, *that* video
>hbomb RWBy video
From all I've read, it seemed like Monty was also a writer on the seasons he was alive for, not just an Idea Guy
that is not how I've heard it at all
...so you're saying Monty *wasn;t* a writer?
So it was a lack of tact/experience all around
Though it's worth noting that it wasn't just Miles and Kerry, Monty had a big hand in the faunus subplot as well
I think most people agree that the faunus subplot could've been handled better
||...isn't it to get revenge against the gods and remake the world without their influence?||
I love all the wild lore shit they've revealed and how it influences/is influenced by the characters
Meanwhile, I thought the reveal of the main plot and how it's developed since is one of RWBY's strongest aspects
There was a Tumblr post with screenshots of this stuff, if only I knew where to find it again...
I don't want to spread misinfo that I'm not certain of myself
But by all means, if I'm wrong about anything I'm saying here, please tell me so I know
Considering it's three hours long and likely to piss me off... I think I'm gonna have to pass
Fully dismissing Monty's work as awful and dumb
It was, like, active hatred and insulting
See, it wasn't just criticism
No idea how true that is, but if it is... yikes
Also, apparently HBomb talks in the video about being a big fan of Monty's early work, but someone looked around old forums and founds old posts of him shitting on RWBY and Monty when it was first coming out
You need to stop acting like we don't give a shit about people dying here
Matt, my family's lost quite a few close friends to Covid as well, and I still don't think your plan would work
And I realized that I... didn't actually mind?
I was talking on the phone with customer service the other day, and the guy on the other end mistakenly called me "Ma'am"
Well, to change the topic and clear the air a bit, I recently realized I'm even more genderfluid than I thought
Go take that break, Matt
We are not trying to be your enemy here, Matt. Stop attacking us
that's it
We just don't think your idea would lead to less people dying
Of course we give a shit
I accept your apology, and I hope you're able to keep moving forward
Thank you
Eh, my given name's gender-ambiguous enough that I feel it works for both
indeed
Feels nice to realize that
I'm still okay being thought of as a guy, but if someone thinks of me as a girl, that's perfectly fine too
and thinking back on it, I've pretty much been okay with it every time
it's happened quite a few times over the years
Like, my voice is very high-pitched, so when I'm talking to someone on the phone who doesn't know me, there's a chance they'll think I'm a woman and call me ma'am
this is my extremely shocked face
So it appears the Republican attempt to recall California's governor is a colossal failure and Gavin Newsom will keep his seat by a wide margin

Yeah sorry, as a white person my self,  black humor about reverse genocide is in no way comparable to the ACTUAL genocides committed by white people, and specifically white Americans
We can take the jab
White people are at no risk of being violently exterminated
Look, I'm not gonna claim some moral stance on defending genocide jokes. They are very tasteless. But I find it far MORE tasteless to act like genocide jokes against a majority group at no risk of suffering it to actual genocide committed BY that majority group.
So it makes sense to discuss it from sn American perspective
Well, this discussion is centered around a racist thing that happened in America
Black nationalist parties, for example, are an incredibly tiny sub section of the civil rights movement and have barely any influence over it
Not in any meaningful way, they're isn't
There really isn't
look on the bright side, their subs and view counts are laughable
It's just the few loud voices that stick out
Though I will say, I think MOST of us are able to hold respectful conversations
That's the risk of having a server this big, I suppose

they proceeded to descend upon her like a pack of starving hyenas

I think you're missing the point. right-wingers always jump to mental illness as an excuse when mass shootings happen, so Sen Murphy is calling bullshit on that. America's gun violence problem isn't because of mental illness, it's because of too easy access to firearms

can someone answer Matt's question?
nobody thought it was possible, but she did it
frankly Keffals deserves all the praise in the world for actually managing to take them down
they only caved because of a month of insanely public pressure mostly organized by a single determined twitch streamer
their providers certainly didn't
the internet at large... doesn't give a shit about trans people being harassed to suicide
sadly they were probably right to be so cocky

Eh, basically nobody responds to me posting stuff In user creation either. Sometimes you just gotta roll with it.
damn Japan really took a look at the UK and decided to run in the complete opposite direction
you say that like it's not already happening en masse
so who knows
but a lot of people thought taking down Kiwifarms was impossible too, before Keffals did it
it certainly won't be easy
So the streamer who took down Kiwifarms might be going after Tucker next

never done gacha in my life, don't plan on starting now lol
I'm not sure why, but for some reason, having over $10,000 in my bank account for the first time makes me feel really good about myself
fuck yeah
but that's just my take
I would avoid using it, just because so many of the people who *do* use it are bigots cloaking their bigotry with language, and you probably don't want to accidentally associate yourself with them
yeah, HGS was a fine show with good queer rep from an actual queer creator, it doesn't really fit the example you're trying to use it for
would've been weird to not at least mention it
she was talking to journalists in Italy about politics specifically
so she's not entirely stupid
`In all fairness, Clinton probably doesn’t know much about Meloni, and chose a diplomatic answer; she also told Il Corriere that women leaders are often backed by right-wing parties because such women “are often the first to support the basic pillars of male power and privilege.”`
Oh, according to Jacobin, here's another thing she said
I still think it's a shitty response, but at least get the full context
"The election of the first woman prime minister in a country always represents a break with the past, and that is certainly a good thing. But then, as with any leader, woman or man, she must be judged by what she does. I never agreed with Margaret Thatcher, but I admired her determination. Clearly, then you vote on ideas."
In all fairness, the full quote is a little more diplomatic
at the very least it shouldn't be
jesus, that does not sound legal
can't be grifters without rubes to pander to
of course, by the time they find out that fascism doesn't discriminate between "good" and "bad" lawbreakers, it's far too late
because they're *good* women
and if a "good" woman suddenly has an unwanted or unsurvivable preganancy? then surely the law will make an exception for them
the train of thought is, abortion is something that *bad* women do, so the law must punish *bad* women
specifically with abortion and why some conservative women want to outlaw abortion
There was some tumblr post I saw recently that sorta touched on this line of conservative thinking
"Surely the leapords won't eat MY face"
probably also some "But I'm one of the good ones, so I'll survive even when I'm pushing everyone else like me down"
hey I speak enough chinese to know what that says lol
I wish I still had the article handy
the guy who orchestrated the war on drugs actually admitted a while back that it was all a sham to target Nixon's political enemies (Hippies who were on weed, poor black communities struggling with cocaine)

that guy being fired from Achievement Hunter certainly fits right in there
rwby fans   x    rwby haters
agreeing that RT can suck it
I wish there was
the sad thing is that there's no real way to support RWBY separately from supporting RT as a whole
she just did a reddit AMA about the situation and she had nothing but kind words for them
that's actually not accurate to the situation, Kdin's complains are about Rooster Teeth, not CRWBY specifically
I'd heard about how garbage GenLock's second season was, guess it's no surprise Rooster Teeth fucked that up too
I feel so awful for Arryn, she's always fought so hard for social justice and yet she's stuck with the shittiest fucking company
whereaas JK Rowling is actually a monster
eh, not exactly, the actual creaters of RWBY are fine, they're just stuck with a shitty company
But if even people as big as Arryn are speaking out (and even Barbara seems to be disconnecting from RT), then some sort of change might be possible
It's unlikely, I know
And my hope is that this mess manages to get those good people at the top
Like there's got to be a better option
"Hey the company you work for did ahitty things and took advantage of you, as punishment you should stop working on your passion project and let Iit die. "
This strikes me as incredibly unfair towards CRWBY tbh
Cause that's what ultimately matters
If kdin, arryn and everyone else said RWBY should die? I'd say let it die
^this
So saying I should stop supporting RWBY is basically saying I should go against the wishes of the victims in question
I think you're missing the fact that all the crwby members speaking out about RT's bullshit still want to work on RWBY
I support that
Kdin literally said she wants rwby to continue despite RT sucking
I'll continue loving a show I love, made by people who live it and still want it to continue
It sucks, but it's what it is
Good people making art under shitty conditions is nothing new in today's world
And frankly if that was a deal breaker, I couldn't be an anime fan
Because that doesn't sit right with me
So I should just let a series made by innocent people wither and die because they're stuck working for a terrible company?
Arguing
I'm not sure what you're sighing
Huh
Wh
Yeah I fully support pirating volume 9 when it comes out
By all accounts RWBY is not to blame at all
And everything in Kdin's statements had made it clear that her issues are with RT as a company, not crwby
Yes
you know I really try not to give credence to the stereotype of cute girls/idol shows being a vessel for creepy dudes to commodify femininity for their own pleasure
but sometimes the pieces just line up perfectly
fucking spectacular
what an insecure fucking baby lol
the emperor has no clothes and everyone knows it but him
there's no master plan, there's no basic common sense, he's just a thin-skinned narcissistic dumbass huffing the smell of his own farts, and now he's on such a big stage that everyone with working eyes can see how much bullshit he's packing
I think the past week has made that painfully clear
unfortunately, he really is that stupid

but there have to be *some* guidelines
like, I don't give a damn if someone steals a TV from a Sears
I just think lank's point is poorly worded
Yeah, I understand that
yeah but just saying "fuck private property" makes it sound like you don't think anyone should own anything
like, when you say "abolish private property," it's not just gonna be Bill Gates who loses possesion of his stuff
you guys... do realize that "capitalists" aren't the only people who own private property in America, right?
and railway workers are needing fair treatment for their work
like I don't know what the situation is in the UK, but if it's anything like the US, where Biden just intervened to stop railway workers from fighting for *seven sick days a year,* it strikes me as incredibly ignorant to act like rail workers just want "a few more tiny coins" or whatever

gotcha
oh, so if someone makes up a monster for use in their own campaign and sells material related to that monster, then that's protected by the current system, but now WOTC is trying to step in on anyone who ever tries to monetize their personal additions to the DnD millieu. Is that about right?
Wait, so they're trying to copyright... people's personal campaigns?
like, y'all are talking about it, but no one has yet said what actually *happened*

iT WILL
It only gets better as it goes
Watch it all
*Fontana
#WatchGintamaYouCowards

Of course, we're all forgetting the TRUE Rie Kugumiya masterpiece performance of the 2000s
lol
Toradora was just a little later
They're both 2000s.
It started 2006 or 2007 or something
Hollup, Zero IS 2000s.
Toradora was 2008/2009 iirc
I've heard people say the ending is kind of a clusterfuck
Guess I have something to look forward to when I watch it in like a month
I haven't seen Charlotte yet, but I've heard it's rather controversial
wow, that's a spicy take
but the show itself is in my top 5 anime of all time, so it must be doing something right
I'm not a big fan of the Key-era big eyes aesthetic
The weird thing, the character designs are probably my least favorite part of Angel Beats
Yuripee could step on me any day
All good choices
She's an absolute jellybean
My gut reaction is either Sawako Kuronome or Rikka Takanashi
I'd say Granbelm is decidedly more subtext than text
Not as many as you might think, but yeah
It's consistently got the funniest meta jokes I've seen
Yep
and Gintama is
Trust me, I would not recommend 367 episodes of anything unless it was legitimately good enough to justify it
yep
alright, this is gonna be fun
...holy shit
Hoo boy, I'm kinda antsy about any leading hints
I'll be analyzing Charlotte on my Tumblr in like a month, so that should be interesting to experience
lol
Also, not having a boyfriend might be a sign that you're just not into guys
oy guvalt
Eternal mood
If I said that about any of my platonic friends, regardless of gender, I would be slapped with a restraining order
Same here

that's the least subtexty subtext I've ever seen
At some point that's not even subtext
Hibiki about Miku at the end of XV: ||"I'll never let go of what I love again.||
Miku singing to Hibiki in G: "Ah, I love you"
Also, consider:
But she's one of the best damn versions of that trope I've ever seen
Miku is very much an example of the Superhero Girlfriend trope
Which makes it all the funnier that Interspecies Reviewers was where they finally drew the line
^^^
Also has one of the best theater subplots of any anime I've seen, which as a theater kid I appreciated very much
It really digs into the psychology of what it's like to wear social faces, especially in high school when you're desperate to fit in
Even outside the romance, it's just a freaking great character/societal study
Bit of a slow start, but the slow burn is 100% worth it
Bloom into you is superb
and super funny
*ride
Ohoho, you are in for a ide
It's got both
<:KirikaSalute:620069889838809089>
HAPPY BIRTHDAY KAGURA
same
ganbare, Shamiko!
which is both its blessing and its curse
Yeah, SYmphogear has never really been able to do... subtlety well
So maybe finding a good torrent if you aren't torrenting already might help
One of my friends on another Discord loves it and says that the official subs butcher it, making the worldbuilding impossible to comprehend
I was kinda eh on Yuki Yuna too
Mazoku good
machikado
I pray we get a season 2 one day
I love My Soul Your Beats so much
fuck, that sucks
Speaking personally, I hated the fanservice, and I thought the episodic adventures were stupid and lame
at least, I believe so, my facts may not be solid
stuff that airs in the morning/weekends tends to be shonen/shoujo/more kid oriented in general
I'm pretty sure most anime get the late-night slots like that
Rakugo's really damn good, but I didn't really fall in love with it until the second season
Believe me, I wouldn't rec 300+ episodes of anything unless it was absolutely worth it
Best 367 episodes of anime you'll ever watch
HELL YES
https://animebw.tumblr.com/post/621194265774686208/why-sangatsu-no-lion-and-gintama-are-the-same-show
So I just had a revelation that two of my favorite anime of all time- Sangatsu no Lion and Gintama- are essentially the same show.
I don't even remember her name, but she deserved better
she deserved better, man
Studio NUT and the director of Mob Psycho 100
HELL YES
hahahahaha sucks man
Watch Sangatsu no Lion
I come with a mission for everyone who sees this message
<:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
||"I *am* burning..."||
It was when all the slow-burn build-up really paid off for me and turned on the waterworks
||Violet coming to terms with Gilbert's death||
honestly my favorite ep's probably the one right before it
Taught me all I know about playing shogi
We can only hope Netflix streams it with the rest of the show eventually
AT LAST
YES
Violet's also really damn good
same
Season 2 made me cry on a more consistent basis than any other anime
SHE
I'm just praying for a season 3 so I don't spoil myself
I'm so obsessed with the anime that I can't bring myself to read the manga
lol rip
This is Hinata Kawamoto, and she is Goodness Personified
Also: Her
Also got the single best portrayal of bullying I've seen in any media ever
Rei Kiriyama, aka My Son
and some shogi, but you don't need to know how to play shogi to enjoy it
It's got one of the best ensemble casts ever, some of the most striking visuals ever
Short version, it's about a teenager with depression learning how to value himself and become part of a supportive community
It's one of the best anime I've ever watched in my life
Watch Sangatsu, then
Which is why I hope to rectify that discrepancy now
Apparently not
So I forget if I shilled this anime yet to you guys, but: Watch Sangatsu no Lion, y'all
lol
fair enough
Gintama ||ah, so you're almost at the end of season 3||
...actually, you might be at my favorite arc of all
That is close to the end, hot damn
it's so good
please finish Gintama
you misspelled Gintama
Once you've got that, everything makes sense
Basically all you need to know is everything's a metaphor for a) psychoanalysis and/or b) realizing you're a lesbian
Flip Flappers is a fave of mine
I watched the anime a while back, and I thought it was awful
I would not recommend it
so probably not
There's exactly one (1) new scene at the very end of the director's cut, and I suspect they're gonna use that scene to open up season 2 as well
IS THAT KENJIRO FUCKING TSUDA
okay but anime adaptation when
booo
imo
That was more playfulness than anything
Emilia is best girl f--k you fight me
that flesh fang stirs up my fight or flight response
not as unpopular as you might think tbh
wooooooow
looks like an entirely new studio
YES PLEASE
I advise you stay that way
and the show wants you to think she's funny
I find her annoying as sin
and loudly mocks him in crowded streets where lots of people can hear
and continues to harass him even when he tells her to stop
The reason is that she instantly assumes that an introverted guy who values his alone time must be suffering from loneliness and barges in on his life without permission
Every introvert's worst nightmare, basically
#MaleWritersStopMakingFemaleCharactersTalkAboutTheirWeightChallenge2020
same
bc men
^^^
plus we got Appare-Ranman coming back, which is dynamite
and I'll be watching Re:Zero 2 when it finishes airing
Personally, I'm enjoying Deca-Dence, God of Highschool, and Fire Force S2
one person's exposition dump is another person's conceptually awesome worldbuilding dump, I suppose
Frankly, I'm loving Deca-Dence more and more each episode
(even tho Elfen Lied is still trash and honestly even worse than GS overall)
hot take, Elfen Lied's first episode is better than the entirely of Goblin Slayer
Goblin Slayer: so what you're saying is, gratuitous rape and ugly CG
Attack on Titan: hey, let's establish a strong gripping premise and a believable family dynamic to get you invested before shattering the status quo with god-tier animation and direction sure to leave you slack-jawed
~~shame it didn't try shocking with good charcters and animation~~
it's literally just there for cheap shock value
yeah, the hilarious thing is that there's basically NOTHING else like that in the rest of the show
whut
"seinen"
it doesn't really get better from here
wise choice
tomori kicks ass
<:MikuBliss:336657233712513024>
did they actually make an Angel Beats VN or is that a joke?
Clannad's anime is one of my top 10 anime ever, so I hope you enjoy it too
I am so freaking psyched for another Jun Maeda anime
see, left side Uzaki actually looks kinda cute
...oh heck that looks amazing
*chanting in the distance* one of us one of us one of us
you're in for a good time
nice
damn, that's hardcore
...you schedule your anime watching time?
WATCH 3 GATSU
Attack on Titan
nice!
I love Mushishi to death
oh... dear
i may have to watch that show
okay but can I have the sauce for that gif because god DAMN she's cute
oh shit, welcome to the pain train
whOOPS
but the sub's much better
madoka's got a dub!
came out a year earlier
madoka was first
there's a reason for that
that's right
Madoka Magica
the first one
3gatsu appreciation, we love to see it
sonix x was my *jam*, dude
well, he *is* an idiot, so you're not wrong
finally, a quality opinion
haven't played the game, but the anime just felt... absurdly rushed and underbaked
eh, I was not a fan of the MagiReco anime
C U R S E D
many muscly women, yes
it's a wild urban fantasy romp with blood and gore and wacky comedy and a really sincere heart
dorohedoro is fucking great
np
https://anilist.co/search/anime/next-season
AniList has a ticking clock of how long it is until each new show airs
https://anilist.co/search/anime/next-season
there's a lot of good/interesting shit coming in fall 2020, I'm gonna be swamped with stuff to watch
it feels like it came straight out of 2000 shonen jump, and not in a good way
shame, I was excited for it
man, Burn the Witch was pretty lame
ouch
Assault Lily's just on Funi, which makes me sad
Higurashi's on Funi and Hulu
i wanna know what's up with creepy kid Odin
it feels like A-1 pictures wanted to remake Sora no Woto but with an actual good screenwriter, and I am down for it
yep! first episode of Re:Zero was double-length
most likely because the show's writer is the original author of Re:Zero, so he well knows the power of a good double-length first episode
probably the latter
Yo, Warlords of Sigrdrifa fucking *slaps*
VRV subscription is where it's at
and I'm so nervous it's gonna fail
yeah, all the trailers I've seen for A&S, the animation doesn't look... good
miss Hibike Euphonium herself
yep
also, no, Nao and Kumiko don't have the same va
BUT I CAN'T
I WANNA VOTE FOR BOTH OF THEM
god dammit that made me so mad
Yashahime
airing right now
there's an Inuyasha sequel
you don't know?
you
you mean correct opinion
you leave it blANK
abstain just means you don't pick anyone
i think you mean best
for 25 hours on end
did you just like watch completely nonstop
...
...good heccin luck
<:YumiPoint:688429724103344164>
honeslty wouldn't put it past him
unless Anno just decided to turn eva 3+1 into a full goddamn TV show behind our back
there's no way that tweet's accurate
yep, just about 12/13 episode's worth of content
there's no freaking way that's real
that has to be fake
I am excite
Jun Maeda's new anime comes out on Saturday
I was so worried, but it really hit all the right marks
I KNOW RIGHT
she's such a brat, I love it
I'm already getting emotional how is this fair
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuJ3yVbbDpg&ab_channel=maidigitv
「銀魂 THE FINAL」本予告が解禁！最後の敵が明らかに　主題歌はSPYAIR　DOESが挿入歌
oh hey, speaking of exploding, the teaser for the Gintama finale film just dropped
<:ShemHaSmile:688429721758990545>
T minus 12 hours until new Jun Maeda anime
maeda is a blessing
so far, it seems to be comedy/slice-of-life with a supernatural twist, but knowing Maeda, it's probably going to spiral into a million different genres before all's said and done
I have watched the first episode of The Day I Became a God, and it was Good(tm)
IT'S JUN MAEDA DAY
still a cool-ass shot no matter how many times you watch it
nice
first time watching Titan?
damn, Maeda's shortest anime yet
they have all the seasons... EXCEPT the very first season
i actually checked, and it's the weirdest goddamn thing
Jun Maeda's one flaw as a writer: he ain't gay
quick quesiton, why are there two Adachi/Shinamura manga listed?
this is a GOOD damn season
it's between Adashima, Jujutsu Kaisen, Wandering Witch, and Kamisama
honestly, this episode pushed it into contention for anime of the season for me
just watched the ep myself and|| OH MY FUCKING GOD ADACHI I LOVE YOU||
aaaaaaaaaaaah i didn't know that
I've never watched Bleach and I can't stop rewatching this OP, send help
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXjgwpayNoM&ab_channel=CrunchyrollCollection
m a s c l e s
sadly, yes
it will give you the biggest headache
i would suggest running from this show as fast as possible then
Dude does not make stuff easy to parse
funnily enough, yurikuma is the only Ikuhara show I *haven't* seen yet, but that seems like an accurate assessment considering the rest of his work
welcome to the wonderful world of Ikuhara
bold words for someone in throwing distance
*not watching naussicaa
The whole damn show just turned into Gintama for an episode and I am living for it
the entire episode
*i am losing my entire shit laughing*
*please*
*watch it*
oh my fucking god please tell me someone else has watched the latest episode of Warlords of Sigrdrifa
All the best parts are when Crona's on screen
Soul Eater's super fun. Uneven, but fun!
~~not if you watch it on Netflix~~
just be prepared for the ride of your life
do it
and now it's got me emotionally invested
imo it doesn't start out that good, but it's slowly been getting better each episode
trust me, it helps
It's finally slowing down and letting the characters breathe, and it's so freaking endearing
well, that was easily the best episode of ass lily yet and I'm finally excited to keep watching
it's just... so thoughtlessly written
but not much
there's like some explanation for taht in the Sinners of the System movies
season 3 just made me angry
I think season 2 is overhated in some respects, I liked parts of it
just let the franchise die, it can't survive without the Butch
<:TsubasaYareYare:407397617451139073>
fffffffffff
what moneygrubbing garbage
Christ
but they don't explain how they got in prison in the first place?
and that doesn't have answers either?
oh
which means the entire season is just a cocktease saying "you want answers? Screw you, pay us to keep making psycho-pass and we'll tell you!"
My suspicion is that those questions are answered in the *next* movie, First Inspector, that's a sequel to season 3
yeah, there is no explanation for how the OGs ended up where they ar ein 3
honestly, I thought it was the weakest Psycho-Pass yet
but the old cast is still hanging around
it's a sequel with a different core cast
not exactly
might be on Funi as well?
it's on Hulu, I believe
Clannad and Angel Beats come to mine
Try anything Jun Maeda's ever written
looks like Redline, but I don't think that's it
She
so I am blessed with Much Moyo
the hilarious thing, I'm literally about to start rewatching Hibike today
rip
That said, *was nobody going to tell me that Tomoyo Kurosawa was playing Saya*
she's not listed on MAL or anilist yet, sadly
almost Symphogear levels of gay at times, honestly
Assault Lily has completely won me over in the past two episodes, it's *insane* how much better it's gotten
Jun Maeda's done it again
Welp, episode 5 of Kamisama just made me openly weep
Ouran Highschool Host Club?
thanky
oh man, what's this manga?
yeah, I remember having that issue too
eeeeeeeeeeee
Takeo's such a good boy
just finished episode six and I'm crying
it's *so fucking wholesome*
So I'm watching Ore Monogatari, and this is probably gonna end up being one of my favorite rom coms
latest Fire Force episode ||So, is this show ever going to let Tamaki do anything in a fight other than get exploitatively brutalized so some big strong dude can get character development by saving her?

Like, even once?||
obviously, they're called Connect Fours
hence why pretty much every attempted sequel to one of his shows has fallen flat on its face
he gets in, says what he needs to, and gets out without leaving any loose ends
his anime are pretty much all closed loops of ideas
Another problem is that Urobuchi doesn't really write works that can be sequalized
the answer is Money(tm)
it's in s3 that she slips into the background
no, Akane's still the main character in S2
it would holy fuck
WHAT THE HELL
I'M LOSING MY SHIT IF THIS TURNS OUT TO BE TRUE
THAT'S FUCKING BRILLIANT
that
NICE
YO SHIT
It's all fair if you don't think it was a particularly *well-done* bottle episode, but the fact that it's a bottle episode is not the problem itself
m-hm
exactly!
I dunno, I feel like so many people are dragging kamisama for flaws that just aren't there and ignoring those flaws when they actually *do* show up in other shows
Plus, Maeda's other shows have done similar character-centric bottle episodes, so if your friends liked, say, Iwasawa's episode in Angel Beats, it's kinda silly for them to say "lol this came out of nowhere" here
The show's been building up Izanami's character in subtle ways ever since we met her
I'm so baffled by people who think episode 5 came out of nowhere
THANK you
this ep was great
the musical theater masterpiece sister to Symphogear's bombastic rock opera
good
very
is
it
seconded Revue Starlight
there is, I forget what it's called
from the same author ad Mo Dao Zu Shi, right?
https://anilist.co/anime/113260/Heaven-Officials-Blessing/
Everyone go watch Heaven Official's Blessing
So, I just discovered that Funimation is doing its first ever simulcast of a Chinese anime, and the first episode was sick as fuck
yes please watch Flip Flappers
but AOT is still really hecking good
~~Fullmetal's better~~
||when suddenly, Hibimiku||
Adachi spoilers
lol, people were so eager to watch the new AOT they crashed Crunchyroll's servers
it has... not aged well
honestly I thought Gunbuster was lame as heck
smh Fate's not complicated, you just have to read the vn then the sequel then the prequel then watch all the adaptations in backwards release order then Carnival Phantasm
god dammit I missed the Angel Beats talk
the BARS
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXBla6USb78&ab_channel=ZeLLive
*Mother of god, Callie*
Counterpoint, Re:Zero is really good and I'd suggest watching it so you can decide for yourself if it's your thing
I watched million lives and really liked it
the best non-KyoAni cute girls show out there
yama no susume is amazing
no time, gotta get shit wrapped up
or the countless people affected by it
like, how would the world react to... all that
honestly, the only problem wiht the ending is that it was packing so much stuff in that it couldn't properly address the consequences of all the cray shit going down
okay, it was a giant clusterfuck, but it still did the characters justice
honestly, same
interesting, I'm really liking the direction the ending's gone in
Wise Man's Grandchild? Haven't seen it
apparently it was really popular in Japan, so hopefully the team's raked in enough cash to punch up season 2
yep
bad editing, low-caliber animation and so on
there were just lots of awkward flaw in its execution
I suspect most of its issues were issues of adaptation, because I really liked the core story
1,000,000 lives was my surprise fave of the season
||In which case, the fourth pitch would be a confession of *familial* love to someone who was already resigned to their fate, which could be read as an unhittable slider||
||yes now that I think about it||
||I'm honestly kind of shaking at how much I love this||
||GOD||
||the buildup, the payoff, the steaminess... THIS IS HOW YOU PAY OFF A LONG-BUILDING ROMANCE||
||I cannot b e l i e v e how hard they nailed it||
||And to think I was just about to go to sleep
GOOD LUCK SLEEPING NOW, ME||

||I'M FREAKING OUT AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA||
Is free release
||IT FINALLY HAPPENED||
||IT HAPPENED||
please do
please
the latest chapter that just dropped
read
Have you
so, uh, does anyone here read Mage and Demon Queen?
||my heart is so full...||
they all *try* to be good
literally no one in Eva is awful all the time except Gendo
THANK you
flip flap flip flap
Cardcaptor Sakura's so fucking good
It's like the musical theater sister to Symphogear's rock opera, if that makes sense
it's the Theater Kid anime I always wanted
Revue Starlight is fucking amazing
deeeeeess
you ain't seen nothing yet, trust me
Hard agree
It still wrecks me that RWBY figured out how to make 3D anime look good eight years ago and the actual anime industry is still struggled to catch up
Otherside Picnic Episode 1: Proof that great direction can trump bad animation to create one hell of an engaging premiere. Definitely looking forward to this one.
oh, Vinland Saga's amazing
eh, I suppose
you're in for quite a fun time
naruhodo
let em enjoy the ride for themself
chaos I 'd suggest being cautious of spoilers just in case
how much do you know about Madoka going in btw? Just curious
one of my favorite things about it
yeah, Madoka's art style is freaking insane
that's Hitomi
The one who just came in at the end, you mean, or the green-haired one?
get you a bestie who's always ready to throw down
Sayaka's great
godspeed
but everything that builds off of it? god-tier
cause in retrospect, you can reeeeeeally see the twist coming
the funny thing is, I'm actually of the rare opinion that this is the weakest part of the show
m-hm
y e p
welcome to the real Madoka, enjoy your stay
in retrospect, the fact it was written by Gen Urobuchi really should've tipped people off
it was the moment Madoka became a cultural touchstone, at least among Western weebs
and then *that* happened and everyone lost their shit
It was marketed as a standard magical girl show
cause it was *not* marketed as a dark show
Fun fact, Madoka's third episode is pretty famous as The Episode That Fucked Everyone Up
AHAHAHA
WELCOME TO THE PAIN TRAIN
what an adorable mascot character
yep
Urobuchi's really good at that
it's got so many details and foreshadowing you miss the first time around
believe it or not, I loved it even more on re-watch
it just... sticks with you
yeah, Madoka's fucking amazing
it is not very good imo
on the other hand, I would also not recommend Madoka Side Story
on the one hand, no
lol true
he was literally leaving Mantle defenseless in the face of the Salem crisis
Like, even back when we first met him in volume 2, it was clear Ironwood's tendency toward militarism might be dangerous
I don't blame Ruby for not really trusting him that much
Wasn't Ironwood already leaving Mantle basically to die by the time Rwby arrived in Atlas?
It feels like Ikuhara decided to stealth-direct without telling anyone, and it's wild
So, uh, I have no fucking clue what Wonder Egg Priority is, but I think I love it
it means ||Otonashi's gonna have some cool-ass stepmoms||
...oh SHIT
Horimiya, Wonder Egg, Sk8 the Infinity, AOT final season...
It's gonna be a close race for anime of the season
I don't want to shame anyone, if you like it that's fine, but you should probably know what you're getting into with that show in case you'd rather bail
yeah
just... know what you're getting yourself into
and if you still enjoy it even with that knowledge, it's totally fine
okay, put in spoilers for major content warning: from what I've heard, Redo of Healer is a story where ||the protagonist gets revenge by raping the women he wants to get revenge on and brainwashing them into his sex slaves||
(I was mostly speaking to Aya tbh)
just what I've heard
I dunno, I've never read either
because if you don't, you might want to
do, uh, do you know the reputation the LNs have
fucking same
it's the Iroduku team, and Iroduku was great
I'm so excited for this one
nice
"The staff posted a teaser promotional video, teaser visual, and the tagline: "The story of how I, Vivy, will destroy my AI self …""

AIRING NEXT SEASON
PRODUCED BY STUDIO WIT
ORIGINAL TV ANIME FOR THE CREATOR AND SCRIPTWRITER OF RE:ZERO
https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2021-01-15/re-zero-creator-scriptwriter-pen-wit-studio-april-tv-anime-vivy-fluorite-eye-song/.168444
EVERYONE SHUT UP
*kicks down door
Just watched it for a third time myself, and I think it's become one of my favorite anime films ever
I am begging you all to watch Wolf Children
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ea3fxOZer9E&ab_channel=Funimation
Red Blood Cell's entire backstory and character arc in the first episode? Anime original
It's adding in so much new character/thematic detail
I read a couple manga chapters, and the adaptation is actually *incredible*
not everything deserves the Brotherhood treatment
Bones is doing sk8
they are not doing sk8
I still unironically love Charlotte flaws in all, it does so many things so right
God that episode is so good
Kamisama was a mess, but episode 5 still got the tears flowing
Basically everything made by either a)Kyoto Animation and b)Jun Maeda makes me cry without fail
yorimoi is a class above
I imagine it is, considering how amazing the anime was
God, I hope he's okay
Bold of you to imply Angel Beats doesn't have the best final episode of any anime ever
Tomori is perfect and I will fight anyone who disagrees
Surprisng absolutely no one, I loved it
I finally got around to watching Liz and the Blue Bird
||And it's just completely glossed over||
||The dad is revealed to be a rapist who raped the family maid when they were in Sword College or something||
Way to fucking crater my expectations into a ditch
So uh what the actual fuck was that episode of Mushoku Tensei
Hinamatsuri is really good
Re:Zero is the only modern isekai I think is anything better than okay
so you're not alone
I thought it was mid at best
it gets better as it goes
Cause the guy is legitimately a great guy who loves all his partners and it has poly elements
There is exactly one classic harem I've enjoyed, and that's the manga The 100 GFs who really really really Love You
I have seen basically zero traidtional harems I've enjoyed for that reason
how it so obviously caters to "I Own All the Woman"
it's the power fantasy
answer: yes
you have reached... the episode
Would you be at *all* comfortable with him being around you and your kids from then on?
Even if he eventually realized that was shitty and backed off?
What would your reaction be?
let's say you ahve kids one day, and some dude tells you "I want to marry your kids when they grow up"
okay
in what universe is wanting to slap an annoying person comparable to *considering child grooming*
press x to doubt
so there's that
Well, he just said that he's going to groom a seven-year-old child to be his bride
The fact you consider pedophlia a humanizing trait is kinda sus ngl
Do you have any actual arguments beyond trolling?
^^^^
anyway if I wanted an actually good isekai with a scumbag protagonist who learns to be better, Re:Zero is right there
note the "aside from the ones where the point is that it's bad"
WEP GOAT
remind me, doesn't roxy end up a part of his harem too?
cool motive, still having sex with someone he first met when she was a child
and content warning for, like, yikes
spoilers for future MT
||https://twitter.com/HiMyNameisChair/status/1356291961410498562||
but I think the Wiki disagrees with you
You claim that Rudy doesn't end up grooming Sylphie
One last point I want to make
watch egg
the starfish... *the starfish...*
It's just that After Story is so much better that it dwarfs any discussion of season 1
Clannad's first season is amazing too
The ||Ushio in the field|| scene... god, I've never been the same after that
but Clannad is an another level
haven't seen Plastic Memorie yet, so I can't say for sure
It and Angel Beats regularly make me bawl harder than any other anime
You should, Clannad is amazing
The hilarious thing is, that feels like a joke that could actually happen in Angel Beats
welcome to Revue Starlight, lol
Yeah, I am *stunned* how well Kinema Citrus saved this thing from going off the rails
so many good shots in this show
godspeed
||we are the giraffe and the giraffe is us||
||Because it's so true, isn't it?||
||I LOVE THAT MOMENT SO FUCKING MUCH||
||WAKARIMASU||
||AHAHAHAHAHAHAHA||
Second only to Symphogear itself in the Singing Fighty Lesbians genre
I highly recommend it, it's *great*
||It's one of my favorite twists ever||
I still can't get over ||time traveler Nana|| in episode 7
As a former high school theater nerd, this is the high school theater nerd anime I've always wanted
it's one of my few 10/10s
I'm so happy you're liking Revue Starlight
that goofy English that Maya uses in episode 3
I think Millhi means "This is Tendou Maya"
I have heard that the Hi-Dive subs are kinda garbage, so torrenting may be a better option
I hope you enjoy it more the second time
||Karen's proven to Hikari that she wants what they have to work, and Hikari finally lets herself trust Karen because of it||
||So by the time they finally meet face to face again, they've more or less already gotten back on the same page||
||catching up on all the time they missed, from little fun details about their lives to the big, important questions still driving them||
||And over the course of that montage, they finally *talk* to each other again||
||Hikari's literally and symbolically challenging Karen to chase after her to prove her commitment to their relationship||
what I loved about that sequence was|| how we get to see Karen and Hikari reconnecting after years of separation all throughout that montage of Karen chasing Hikari||
Episode 4, I believe
I will say, I was loving Revue Starlight from the start, but it wasn't until episode 7 that it became a 10/10 for me
it's got popular ships
once you hit episode 7 there are no brakes on the train
Considering your love for heroic yuri, I think you'd really like its back half
hab
https://animebw.tumblr.com/tagged/revue-starlight/chrono
IT REALLY IS
I wrote an episode by episode analysis of it a while back, if you'd be at all interested in reading something like that
I could gush about it forever
Nine well-realized characters, stunning action, beautiful themes, incredible use of symbolism and cinematography, a near-flawless understanding of the mindset of theater geeks...
I know, I am endlessly shocked at how good Revue is
all done?
yeah, the final episode is kind of amazing
You've got some good stuff coming in the second half
Yeah, Re:Zero's really good at not being a power fantasy
ganbare!
hell yeah, more eggs for the egg squad
yeah, she's doing a complete channel overhaul and unlisting all her vids
I know, yeah
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7NGHyQWbK5k&ab_channel=Digi
All I know about The Asterisk War is that it inspired the greatest anime roast of all time
I feel like this is Oshii's attempt to ape studio Trigger
Oshii must have been smoking some dank weed when he was making this thing, that's all I'm gonna say
I don't think it's possible to be high enough to watch this show
Four episodes into Vlad Love: I don't think I'm high enough to watch this show
seconded
The Asterisk War Sucks was what really convinced me that this was a medium worth looking at
I credit Digi with getting me into anime in the first place tbh
<:MikuJoy:738234684655403110>
Hosoda!
all hail the queen
she's very prolific
oh whoops
yep, Yoko Hisaka
It had a samurai slicing a cowboy's bullets out of mid-air, what's not to love?
hey now, Appare Ranman was fun
Hell yeah
||Won what?||
are the anime awards happening now?
took him three parallel timelines to get there, but he got there
He did, yes
should be good
nice
nyaa should have the subs too
do eet
That one's so good, it's cuet to the max
Demon Girl Next Door
||I have been waiting *so long* for a good anime romance where they fuck||
Latest Horimiya episode ||oh my god they actually fucked||
ganbare shamiko intensifies
I'm always down to geek out about it
Eva's one of my top 3 anime of all time, lol
Ooh, more Eva watchers! Welcome to the club.
I don't think I've ever seen a show as good at genuinely upsetting me as Eva
Just... god
Episode 18 of Eva murders me every time I watch it
I see Gintoki, I approve
It is definitely... intense
It's literally all about|| how even in the absolute worst, most hopeless of times, there's still hope||
It still blows my mind that some people think EoE is nihilistic
anime or otherwise
End of Eva is my favorite movie ever
now you must watch End of Eva
Congratulations

this show is So Much every week
yuki yuna is a hero
It scares me how good this show is sometimes
and I still don't play sports, but I love sports anime
then I watched Haikyuu
I used to think that way
volleyball
forget the fanbase, the show is excellent
Nineteen for me
She's a paragon hero except as a bloodthirsty villain
also, Esdeath is legitimately a great antagonist
it's good at leaning into its edgy, schlocky tendencies for pure entertainment value
it's very dumb, but I quite enjoyed it
aaaah, akame ga kill
it's an experience alright
it all comes tumbling down, tumbling down, tumbling doooown
And personally, I think at least season 2 *is* really that good
It said, "Hey, here's a show literally just about watching a group of girls live their life, watch it make a million bucks"
See, the thing about K-On is that it basically popularized the idea that slice-of-life could be just as good and popular as more plot-driven anime
the movie was so good it made me retroactively raise my score for season 2
AGREED
K-On's second season is great, season 1 has its issues imo
I keep coming back to it and it keeps wrecking me
the imagery, the themes, the emotions...
EoE has stuck with me like no other film
||Honestly, Asuka's my favorite fictional character of all time, so that scene hits extra hard for me||
||She goes down fighting to the bitter end||
||fucking destroys me every time||
yeah, EoE goes hard with the gore
it's a perfect stand-alone piece
Liz works even if you've never touched Hibike in your life
very
I just hope they do it as a show and not a movie
Yeah, I know Hibike 3's on the docket for them
It's just too dense to work in movie format outside a character piece like Liz
God, I hope they do Hibiki's third year as a TV show again
But Liz is still phenominal
If I'm being honest, i still think I prefer Hibike S2 over Liz just because it's a longer series and can thus tackle a wider variety of ideas
it was so good
I finally watched Liz last month
I rewatched it recently, and pretty much every episode from 3 onward made me cry
SoraYori fucking rules
heathens
funnily enough, all three of those  shows share the same screenwriter: Juuki Hanada
I see you are a fellow of culture as well
Hiroko Utsumi is the queen of pretty boys
m-hm
It's got talent to spare
and written by the writer of Code Geass
Plus, it's directed by the director of Free and Banana Fish
I'd say it does for pretty boys what symphogear did for magical girls: it's a huge, operatic, over-the-top spectacle that somehow avoids parodying itself by being 110% sincere
Sk8 is so good
Hell yeah, more Demon Girl fans!
aaAAAAA THEY SMOOCH
yeeeeee
I still like it too, though
Season 2 is good, it's just nowhere near as good as season 1
Those last few episodes are something else
Chuuni was the first KyoAni show I ever watched, and it's still one of my faves
I love this show so much
Yaaaay, more Chuuni fans!
I laughed so hard
god episode 4 was amazing
my tears
oh no
you HEATHEN
it's got moments of incredible happiness and moments of crushing despair, but it never lets go of hope
It's also a show about depression and healing
he is a very sweet guy
he is
eeeexcellent
This is arguably the second most important character in the show, after the protagonist
BEHOLD
one of them is, in fact, the cutest girl
jokes on you, there are *three* cute girls who are among the most important characters
it is... staggeringly good
three episodes in a row now, I've rewatched an episode that didn't make me cry the first time I watched it, but absolutely made me cry this time
then allow me to be its ambassador, because it's fucking amazing
So, is anyone else here keeping up with r/anime's Sangatsu no Lion re-watch?
it's gonna be so good
But now they're making a *feature length* version
and it's biggest problem was that it just wasn't freaking long enough to be more than an artsy mood piece
I remember when they made like a twelve-minute OVA of this manga a year or two ago
FUCK YEAH
FULL LENGTH GIRL FROM THE OTHER SIDE OVA NEXT YEAR
https://anilist.co/anime/130550/The-Girl-from-the-Other-Side/
you are absolutely right
does anyone know where I can find the latest RWBY episode to watch? VRV's being dumb and hasn't uploaded it yet.
THELEGENDARYTAEYAMADA
That was my biggest issue with Eizouken, yeah
that's a heck of a resume
And Inuyasha for good measure
and in between they spend over a decade producing the single greatest anime ever made, Gintama
They go from the ultimate mecha studio to the ultimate idol studio
Sunrise is one of the weirdest studios to me
otherwise it would destroy me
I can only watch it ever so often, tho
Eva's one of my favorite pieces of media ever
I've finished it three times
I wish you luck
Eva will wait for you
no shame in it
Take as many breathers as you need, my dude
Be prepared, because it pulls no punches
I will say this much; Evangelion has a way of wrecking you like no other anime I've seen
it only gets funner from here
welcome to the fun house
Revue for the Revue gods!
Of course, Clannad was an exception to that because it was made by Kyoto Goddamn Animation
^^^
with a few exceptions
I feel like 2001-early 2006 was pretty much an animation dead zone
agreed
yeah, I'm not fond of them either
that style dominated the mid-2000s
Ah, the Key eyes
||well you're not wrong per se||
it's not a good time for him
short version, shit gets intense again
It gives you a chance to settle into the world more comfortable, I feel
episode 2's a bit of a breather after the opening chaos
Jun Maeda anime always have great girls
That show *slaps*
I still say Charlotte is underrated
I still haven't recovered from ||Ushio in the field||
Clannad After Story *destroyed* me
especially Clannad
ayup
I can never look at this food the same way after the show Lank is referencing
THAT'S A CLOSE SECOND ALRIGHT
Good luck!
||She is not having a good time||
||God, poor Rei...||
Fear is about right
How much do you know already?
neat
And I look forward to hearing your thoughts as you keep watching
I believe in you!
Anyway, sending you all my strength
Ah, the best way to watch anime
you've got a big storm coming
Hoooooooo boy
Because if it's hitting you this hard already?
I hope you're ready for what's to come
Man
It hit you that hard that fast
Wow
and none as strong as Eva
It's a feeling that very few anime have inspired in me
Something about Eva just... stays with you like that
but I always find the strength to keep going
there are moments later on I still can't get through without shattering into a nervous wreck
brave enough to face its darkness, both in the fucked-up stuff to come and the characters' inner turmoil
it's a show that kinda *demands* you be brave
especially with Eva
That's a good state to be in
Eva's a show it's worth being brave for
hell yeah
I'm really glad you're enjoying it
that's... honestly kind of profound
Just means you've got good taste
They want a cool robot anime and they get a realistic look at depression and child soldiers instead
Eva's kinda infamous for people watching it and missing the point
people are dumb sometimes
A lot of people watch Eva and think Shinji's a coward, but I can't agree with that at all
he is putting in WORK
Considering he's essentially a child soldier being asked to be a one-man army against eldritch abominations that would drive any man insane to look at
Honestly? Yeah.
Shinji's pain hits me in places I don't expect it to
There's something about Eva's character writing that really makes the get under your skin
he's really been through the wringer, and we're just three episodes in
yeah
Megumi Ogata is a queen
Shinji's VA is incredible at screaming
Congrats
Nah, dive right in
Like, i don't like Haruhi, but I never had an issue with the animation
Eh, I still think they hold up
Even if the art was weird, the animation and directing was excellent
I disagree, I think it looked gorgeous
and they pretty much nailed how to use digital animation from the word go
the script is just... very abysmal
I was not a fan of Assault Lily
eeeeeeeeeeh
not only is it canon gay, it's whole story is basically a giant-ass metaphor for lesbian awakening
there's an episode in flipflap that's very Mad Max inspired
yep
It's very gay and very symbolism-laden like Revue
but if you want something with a bit more action, I'd definitely second Flip Flappers
K-On Season 2 is the peak of slice of life imo
I was always comparing it to Madoka in my head because they felt so similar in terms of premise/tone/aesthetic, and that probably didn't do it any favors
I was pretty lukewarm on yuki yuna myself
that's fair
Prepare for the ride of your life
Oh damn, new Utena watcher!
all of his ex-arm reviews are certified gold
flip flap flip flap
content warning for it: ||10-second depiction of sexual assault||
it's both the best episode yet and the *roughest* episode yet
*jesus fucking christ wonder egg*
Heck, I hear there's a trans character in Chivalry of a Failed Knight who isn't made to suffer at all
Bloom Into You, Yuri on Ice, Given...
pfft you're not wrong
very accurate imo
Someone on a tumblr made a post about WEP saying something like "Reminder to myself that when an anime feels like Madoka, there's always the chance it could end up *even more fucked up* than Madoka"
probably the best non-KyoAni cute girls show on the market
mountain climbing girls... good
huzzah!
is yama no susume!
Cause of all the foreshadowing and character bits you didn't understand without the story's full context
Urobuchi is very good at writing stories that get better on second viewing
Honestly, it wasn't until I rewatched Madoka that I really started to love it
wise idea
and a sequel movie that may or may not be canon
madoka is just 12 episodes
like, way shorter
Madoka is shorter
Revue is fantastic
It's a hell of an intro scene, yeah
Madoka's visuals are still among my favorites in all of anime
the only good thing to come out of ex-arm is this guy's reviews
it felt like Shirou was being really challenged and having his usual support system stripped away
Huh, I really like the Caster stuff
lol true
every entry point is flawed
and the VN itself requires you to slog through the Fate route
the UBW anime relies on you having watched Fate/Zero
Dee/Stay night just sucks in general
Fate/Zero spoils the shit out of heaven's feel
honestly Fate's biggest problem is that there is *no* perfect entry point
and i say that having read the VN
I can't blame you there, the Fate route is easily the weakest part of Fate by a country mile
UBW was made for people who had already watched Fate/Zero imo
absolutely Gintama, yeah
but it *is* A Lot
I stress, it's a good show that handles all those topics well
might be one or two more that slip my mind at the mo
I'll list them in spoilertags: ||sexual assault, incest, pedophilia, homophobia||
And yeah, seconding Allison, Utena gets real fucking heavy and comes with a whole list of content warnings
it's got Madoka's great aesthetics and none of the other things that made Madoka great
mmmm... not really
I hope you enjoy Utena, it's a hell of a show
I first watched it when I was twenty, and it instantly became my favorite kid's show ever
what a great show
God, I miss CCS
she's so fluffy i love her
https://nyaa.si/view/1244412
anyway, good utena subs
ccs good
and a gay male couple
and a bisexual deuteragonist
oh, ccs absolutely has one-sided yuri
***ZETTAI UNMEI MOKUSHIROKU***
yeah, Judas subs is what I used
Lemme check
I believe Judas subs is what I used?
the manga came afterward and from what I've heard it doesn't do it justice
and yes, absolutely anime
cause it does *not* make for good casual viewing
It's very, very good, but it's also a show you have to pay close attention to
There's also Revolutionary Girl Utena, but that one's a head trip and a half
Little Witch Academia has yuri if you squint
Bloom Into You, Kase-san
lots of options there
no prob
Nope, still gonna read it
eeeeexcellent
fuck, I might need to read that
also good
Gay girls fighting evil together is god-tier
Holy hell, did I love it
But once I did finish it?
it demands you see the full picture before you judge it
yeah, I didn't really love Utena until I finished it
Ahahahaha, episode 3 always hits hard
this week's Egg was either staggeringly brilliant or a complete betrayal of everything this show was supposed to stand for
yeah, Eva and Madoka share a very similar sense of "Oh god this is emotionally draining to watch"
don't know what that means
huh
This is from a staff member
https://twitter.com/Bloodyredstar/status/1374433595675217924
production heeeeeeell
they're just not sure when they'll air the finale cause the recap episode threw their schedule off
On the bright side, it was confirmed that we *do* have two more episodes to go
and I'm not yet sure which
Mahiru is such a disaster and I love her
that too
Revue good
Gintama's my favorite anime of all time, I hope you enjoy it too!
excitement grows
hell yeah, Gintama!
ooh, fun!
fair enough
Someone better give them all a full month of paid vacation once they're finished here
this poor fucking production team
this industry is fucking broken
~~but do you wonder egg priority~~
is real good
New Eggpisode finally out on Funi
you have been... egged
let this be another Machikado miracle where you don't suck for once
JC Staff plz
please god let it be good
holy shit
it what
Both had quite good first episodes, I'm looking forward to more of them
Mars Red and Joran, Princess of Snow and Blood
not every day you see that
It's pretty funny that we've got two anime airing this season about a steampunk/supernatural 1930s Japan
hell yeah it does
yoooooo
I am *so* excited to see where it goes
With help from the Re:Zero TV show series composer
Also got Re:Zero's author writing it
IT FUCKING SLAPS
I liked it way more than Penguindrum fwiw
Here's one that *actually* isn't a mecha and is similar to Flip Flappers in terms of being surreal: Sarazanmai
probably should get on it one of these days
That's the one Ikuhara show I still haven't seen
have fun with gay bears!
sangatsuuuuuuuuuu
hope you enjoy!
lmao
WEP is very, very good, though it's also quite heavy
Wonder Egg Priority
There's a show that just aired last season that's very similar to Flip Flappers, though its final episode isn't coming until June
I would, but that's just me
I should probably mention now, are there any content warnings you look out for in shows and movies? Because WEP has, like, a metric buttload of content warnings
<:KirikaGlee:698939825927094384>
more eggs for the egg god
wouldn't surprise me
and the show is not subtle about them
Just be aware there are many, many more dark subjects to come
That's good to hear
congrats
lskdfjskldfj wow I was actually joking
~~prisma Ilya~~
I don't think it's actually yuri
probably fucking with the tags
Angel Beats has the best gifs
wow, TPN2 god *bodied*
||I WANT OFF THIS RIDE||
Just watched Re:Zero s2e11 and:|| WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK SHOW||
lmao
he's there because he's a giraffe
the giraffe is just a giraffe
so many
I have so many thoughts on Revue Starlight
wakarimasu
||is it dazzling?||
you have reached ||Big Banana||
Ah yes
which episode are you on
it's so bad
I've only heard clips of the dub, but it made my skin crawl
uuuuugh the dub
the songs are super important
definitely
Revue is not subtle about the points it wants to make
I don't think you'll have too much trouble
lol
the symbolism is all very obvious and is often directly commented upon
I don't think so
It is *everything* about my theater experience
and Revue is the high school theater geek anime I've been waiting for ever since I starter watching anime
See, I was a major high school theater geek
shame
take your naysaying from this sacred temple
You're in for a great time
HELL YES REUVE
https://animebw.tumblr.com/tagged/revue-starlight/chrono
I wrote a series of stupid long Revue analysis posts a while back, if you're interested in my thoughts on it
correct
and you can tell
it's a reunion of a lot of Monogatari staff
the boys are indeed very pretty
I'm watching nineteen shows, but my Anilist airing block only shows 18 at a time for some reason
HOW ARE YOU ALIVE
and I thought my schedule was overly packed
.......
but Aoi Yuuki
I've Been Killing Slimes for 300 years etc etc
supposedly there's one airing this season
I loved Iroduku so this should be great too
yoooo let's go
nice
||explicitly trans, yeah||
I'm four episodes into the second cours and the pain is thankfully less
pain peko indeed
Hence why all the 2D battles this episode are so... that
The problem is, the show is also *directed* by the guy who directed Berserk 2016
Bishonen good
Let me sell you on it, then: Hiroyuki Sawano does the music
I thought that was just a meme
somebody asked them a question of who Mako ends up with, and they said, "All we can tell you is that she *doesn't* end up with Gamagori"
that was actually denied explicitly by the KLK team
so what about ||Mako asking Ryuko to be lovers and kissing her|| in the final episode
||but it's cute, so I don't mind||
||yeah, it's incredibly unrealistic on pretty much every front||
agreed
it's so good
monthly, I bet it was torture
it works better when you read it all at once
https://animebw.tumblr.com/post/649311732697808896/big-massive-yuri-manga-recommendation-list
Have a big-ass list of yuri manga recommendations
*kicks down door*
I still don't think I fully get Rebellion
Yeah, Madoka got really out there at times
I'm guessing after that is when it starts going off the rails
honestly? first 3 episodes were pretty great
Guess who started watching Promised Neverland season 2 today
it's up on Netflix now
it... it already got an anime
I'm not its biggest fan, but a lot of folks here really like it
I'd say Yuki Yuna sits as a curious halfway point between Symphogear and Madoka
Oh, there is *plenty*
I have high hopes
Directed by the director of FMAB, no less
I'm all genres except harem and ecchi
I have watched so few isekai that are actually ever *about* anything beyond harem management
saaaaaame
probably not gonna happen, but I can dream
Personally, I'm hoping the next big breakthrough is a super-popular anime ending with a gay endgame couple and starting a boom of shonen/high-profile original anime with LGBT+ characters
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9H07Z-ZOOM&ab_channel=MoriCalliopeCh.hololive-EN
Oh holy shit Callie's got *drip*
it hurt so good
Dawn of the Deep Soul fucked me the fuck up
that too
MADE IN ABYSS VIDEO GAME LET'S GOOOOOOOO
https://twitter.com/SpikeChunsoft_e/status/1389751990289268740
hence Code Geass, Haruhi, NHK, Death Note, and so on
that's when people finally start to figure out how to use the new technology
because there *are* a lot of good-looking shows from that year
see, I don't count 2006 as part of the dead zone
not even its sequel seasons look as good as the first season, even a full decade later
but it is not the standard of its year
Like, Mushishi looks fucking *beautiful*
those are the exceptions, I'm afraid
Hot take, Angel Beats has better Key faces than any of the actual Key works
They figured out the new animation paradigm and mastered it before everyone else could even blink
it really astounds me how well Kyoani's early work still holds up today
👍
but it's a *very* intriguing setting that makes me eager to find out more
's true nature is, or even what the ultimate plot is gonna be
It's a slow-burner, so we still don't know exactly what the world outside the mansion is like, what the shadow people
because they, themselves, are literally just shadows
and those shadow people make living dolls in their image to serve as their faces
It's a sort-of Gothic Victorian mystery set in a big mansion where a family of shadow people live
Shadows House is... weird
Gotcha, my b
Or do you mean what the show is about besides that?
on a cast-wide scale
perhaps it would be more accurate to describe it as self x clone
Shadow House is leaning hard into the selfcest angle and I'm surprisingly here for it
(problem is there's also a lot MORE of it in the most recent season)
in the most recent season, though? It integrates much better
in past seasons, the cg is very noticeable and out of place
depends which season we're talking about tbh
the rest is like, weird side stuff
then finish with R2
Yeah, start with that one
pretty sure they did, yeah
Honestly, LWA is a pretty great starter anime too
Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood comes to mind
accurate
fuck
are we sure this is legit?
it's incredible
VE's one of my few 10/10s
also, it's not finished airing yet, there will be 13 episodes in total
it's called Vivy: Fluorite Eyes' Song in both english and japanese
it's fucking great
Vivy's my favorite show airing this season
the 2003 version's fantastic
Maybe Kino's Journey?
what'cha in the mood for?
DIANA CAVENDIIIIIIIISH
THE ONLY
THE ONE
it's open enough for whatever ship you prefer
on the bright side, there's no straight either
sadly no
Diakko good
also probably the best rival character of all time
25 episodes of amazingness
LWA is the real deal
easily my favorite Trigger anime
oh yeah, LWA is *fantastic*
I need to watch Odd Taxi once the season's over
god bless
We finally got a HololiveEn girl on Reddit Shitpost Review
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTTnA4MQkg0
has Netflix snagged it yet?
god I still need to get to that
holy shit
something about KanColle I think
because last I checked, Code Geass and Gurren Lagann were higher rated than any of those
I feel like that list isn't entirely accurate tbh
yeah, that makes more sense
Utena is fucking wild
I see Gintama in the top 3, I like
nisioisin is nisioising all over the place
and I haven't read the LNs, but I don't feel like I'm missing anything, which is always a good sign
I'm really loving 86 too
it's not out yet
WEP = weird and good
Bloom Into You is fantastic
YES
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
>sasuke
sometimes it *is* on the production committee, but not too often
yeah, some Netflix "originals" are really just shows it picks up the exclusive license for
In retrospect, we should've known we were doomed when they tapped the director of Berserk 2016 to direct Spider as well
I've wanted to check this one out for a while
HELL YES
genuine question for LN readers, is the human side this boring in the LNs too, or is the anime just seriously screwing that side of the story up?
Me
We would absolutely fight with real swords on stage if we could
Can confirm
GUYS
*kicks down door*
I need to watch that show
it's really going the distance
holy shit
it's going to be a m a z i n g

KLK is fun as hell
heh, that's right!
and if more of the manga gets adapted, it's likely to become my outright fave
it's my second favorite anime of all time
I know Eileen from another server! Yeah, Sangatsu is fantasic
megapog
>sees March Comes in Like a Lion
there is no way the show is gonna look that good
Cause uh
...okay but that chainsaw man trailer has to be a pre-animated dealio that isn't actually taken from animation cuts that will be in the show, right?
spamming "WHERE'S CHAINSAW MAN" and related stuff over and over again
Americans in the chat of Mappa's livestream last night were being absolutely garbage
seems about right yeah

speaking of Egg, I finally parsed some thoughts about why this ending is so hard for me to wrap my head around:
they're the entire show minus one
except, well, they're not
WEP's first twelve episodes (recap included) honestly feel like the first season of a show that's intended to go on quite a bit longer
but it would at least make some degree of sense if it were the start of a new cours
like, it's got plenty of issues on its own
Someone on another server just said that the episode feels less like an ending and more like the start of a season 2, and I agree wholeheartedly
Y E P
Isn't Expelled from Paradise from 2014 or something?
new madoka movie, yeah
OH SHIT I LOVE THAT ONE
Kageki shojo was great
it's amazing
watch Flip Flappers
I tried it, tapped out 4 episodes in because I just could not understand the  sci-fi gobbledygook it was throwing it at me
I would like to jump in and say that I also know Eileen, and while she's a great friend, her taste in anime can also be very particular to her likes/dislikes in ways that aren't always applicable to other people
press x to doubt
>shakugan no shana
||My guess is that information will be part of some twist later on||
||We don't know how her parents died yet||
||That would be one hell of a twist.||
||Ooh! What if the nature spirit we've seen hanging around is actually the ghost of Kukuru's lost sibling?||
||my guess is Kukuru's mom was pregnant with another kid when she died, but who knows? that second kid might still be alive somehow.||
Too many hnk anime
there've been quite a few, but just off the top of my head: Evangelion 22
accurate
||I think I've just got yuribait anxiety||
||...actually yeah that seems like the more likely scenario||
||That's what I'm hoping, yeah||
what if ||the whole "two maternity handbooks" mystery is building up to a reveal where Fuuka is actually Kukuru's lost sister or something?||
...I just had a really bad thought about Aquatope
^seconded
Allow me to sell it to you, then; if Symphogear is rock opera, then Revue Starlight is its Broadway sister
it really is amazing
VERY ACCURATE
lmao nice
yeah, Re:Zero is not a show you can watch passively
best modern isekai by a country mile
nice
is that a bookworm season 3?
starfish power ACTIVATE
yeah, that season definitely works way better watched all at once
very fair, I remember Uzaki feeling like that too
that bad?
WOW
That... seems like it would be hard to maintain quality
Detective, Vanitas, and Black Company
Okay hold on the writer is somehow doing series composition for *three* different shows this season
though the fact he doesn't have any episode director credits under his belt before this...
Must be his directorial debut
*who are you Hitomi Mieno*
And yet she's also responsible for great stuff like Snow White with the Red Hair and Noragami
AND MOM ISEKAI???
WAIT SHE DID ASSASSIN'S PRIDE TOO WHAT THE SHIT
That just makes no damn sense
How does someone write both After the Rain *and* Higehiro?
Some absolute classics paired with an absolute deluge of *garbage*
https://anilist.co/staff/104540/Hitomi-Mieno
that... is one of the weirdest fucking careers ever
*looks up*
Speaking of, who *is* doing series comp for Detective?
that's studio Engi for ya
me w/Psycho Pass
...sora yori's original dude
You say that, but that scene unironically slaps
Just off the top of my head, A Place Further than the Universe, Madoka Magica, Flip Flappers, Psycho Pass, Angel Beats, Wolf's Rain, Evangelion, Revue Starlight, Little Witch Academia...
I also disagree that every standalone anime (I assume you mean stuff with no source material) has bad writing
Easily could've condensed the past five episodes into 3 episodes without losing anything, maybe even 2 episodes
shame they're not the ones getting adapted
she
good luck
HYPE
about damn time
I still need to watch the finale
go go go Gintama
Revue Starlight is amazing
Machikado good
Tbh it's very rude of Aquatope to give each episode at least one scene that rips my heart out of my chest
kicks down door
TAKAGI-SAN'S GETTING A SEASON 3 AND A MOVIE HOLY SHIT
it really is
that too
They're pretty notorious for controversy-mongering and pandering to the worst, most incel-y parts of Western anime fandom
<:KanadeAngry:672861874966233118>
>sankaku complex
LMAAAAAAAAAAAO FOR REAL
I Stand With Vic, i'm pretty sure
press x to doubt
Yes
Flip Flappers
||I didn't know Ilya was an enemy in FSN until I reached ubw, so it made her reveal a great OhShit moment||
I watched Zero then UBW, and honestly I kinda love how that order turns twists into tension
np
||the worms are controlled by him. kill the master, kill his puppets||
||That and she killed Zouken||
||she got dewormed||
Oh, another benefit of Ufotable's adaptations: the FSN prologue works *so* much better as a prologue specifically to UBW than as a prologue to the VN as a whole
And I respect yours. I know my take isn't one everyone agrees with, it's just what makes the most sense to me.
That *is* a good climax, granted
4) Saber may face a tragic end in Zero, but it's still very much her story, and she doesn't have to be saddled to a lackluster romantic subplot like she is in the Fate route.
3) Zero mostly explains the setting's mechanics, and UBW helps flesh out the rest.
2) We still meet most of the cast, now with added context that makes them more interesting more quickly.
1) We skip Shirou's gag-worthy sexism in the Fate route and get introduced to him when he's already a decent character
All four of those things are accomplished just as well, if not better, by the Zero-to-UBW train.
In my eyes, the Fate route is there to 1) Introduce Shirou and his motivations, 2) Introduce the rest of the FSN cast and start hinting at their journeys, 3) explain the mechanics of the setting, and 4) be a Saber-centered story that gives her the spotlight.
yes, but the Fate route is moreso by far
2) Fate Route Shirou
because 1) endless lore and exposition dumping
It's also the biggest stumbling block to people actually getting into the series
Plus, the way Ufotable's adaptions played out means you get to skip the Fate route, which is nothing but a positive in my book
So while Zero is technically "supposed" to be read/watched after the original FSN, I think watching Zero first is a totally valid way to experience Fate, with plenty of its own unique strengths.
Does it ruin a lot of the twists? Sure. But it also turns those twists into *tension.* You're left waiting with baited breath for certain characters' pasts to come to light, knowing what they went through in Zero and what traumas/regrets are driving them.
In a lot of ways, I think it helped me like FSN better than if I watched UBW first. Because I already knew what was going on with a lot of the characters, so I already knew why I should care about them.
When I first watched it, I only knew about Shirou, Saber and Rin. I didn't know any other characters. I didn't even know about Kiritsugu! So I got to be surprised discovering which characters met their ultimate fate in Zero and which ones would continue to be important in FSN.
It's honestly fascinating how watching Zero first changes the context of FSN
06 has some Heavens Feel spoilers, which by extension means Zero spoilers, yes
*that* was pretty awesome
Yeah, Bofuri didn't really work for me until it got to the big show-offy battle in the show's second half
The problem is it keeps *pretending* to have stakes, but the solution is always just "Rimuru is OP and solves everything easily with 0 consequences"
so are most anime studios
I see this as an absolute win
An original anime from Science Saru and *Naoko Fucking Yamada*
On the bright side, you know what that means we get instead?
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
imagine if that original vision was allowed to blossom
It just gives such *weight* to the events of Stay Night, knowing everything that brought the world and characters to that point
I think that mostly summarizes my thoughts on why I'm glad I started with Zero as well
ooh, I still need to watch that one
that was really fun, yeah
LET'S GOOOOOOOO
||sometimes, putting critical, thematically necessary plot information in different artistic mediums and requiring you to read/watch them all... is bad||
||the curse of a mixed media franchise||
I was so disappointed with how Yuki Yuna season 1 ended
lmao I can't even disagree
I think it's lost some of its spark in the second half, but it's still quite good
same
alright, it's about time I actually watch this week's Aquatope so I can see what everyone's crying about
literally the whole point of the movie is that they're not a good match for each other
it ends with them breaking up
she doesn't tho
hell yeah
the magical realism stuff was some of the best I've ever seen
I thought it had some issues, but overall, I adored it
As long as it doesn't go straight to hell in the second half, of course
I knew this show was gonna be good since it's made by the Iroduku team, but honestly? I think it's surpassed Iroduku by now.
god, that was amazing
The future is full of possibility!
We've got over half the show to go yet, and I have no idea where things go from here!
and this is just the first cours!
NOW I SEE.
THAT'S WHY EVERYONE WAS CRYING OVER THIS WEEK'S AQUATOPE
AH.
Aldnoah at least has the benefit of Slaine's arc being fantastic all the way through
It's *great*
there's, like, one moment where it looks like they *might* be getting somewhere as a couple, and the guy goes in for a kiss, and in response, Kumiko *freaks* the hell out and runs off to be with Reina instead
it's actually hilarious, they get together at the start of the movie and then spend the entire movie just... not clicking whatsoever
"almost" boi that ending gets me flooding the house every time
I still need to check that one out too
Naoko Yamada's first original anime
seeing couples actually being couples in anime is my SHIT
I still really like it tho
which, fair, the second season has some issues
I think they meant Chuunibyou still
they did
~~it doesn't hold up at all tho~~
wasn't that Fullmetal Panic? Or does that not count since it was just the second season and Fumoffu?
rip
It is, but also not really?
It was actually the first KyoAni show I ever watched, and it's still one of my favorites to this day
underrated = less people talking about it, not how many seasons it has
I kin Rikka Takanashi so much
Chuunibyou is KyoAni's most underrated show, it's so fucking good
this scene makes me lose my shit every time
yep
still need to watch the last one
3.0 is when it becomes clear why the Rebuilds needed to exist
but movie 3 is *fantastic*
I've been watching the Rebuilds, and I can say that they don't really come into their own until the end of movie 2
yeah, though you really don't need to know a damn thing about Shogi to watch Sangatsu
it's truly incredible
Gintama is my favorite piece of fiction ever
Evangelion, Sangatsu no Lion, Gintama
it was at one time, now it's more like number 4
https://animebw.tumblr.com/tagged/angel-beats-rw/chrono
i did detailed analysis on every episode
I remember every episode
sounds fake but okay
>not liking the baseball episode
it was the anime that made me love anime
same
the best of boys
VE MOVIE FINALLY COMING TO NETFLIX YEEEEEEEEAH
jury's still out on that front
I'm so excited
VE is amazing, and the sequel movie's finally coming to Netflix in a few weeks
^very true
like, content warning for ||sexual assault || dark
like, really dark
Also be aware, Fate gets... dark
everything beyond that is completely optional side stuff/AU nonsense
Start with Zero, then on to UBW (or do UBW first then Zero, though I think it works best with Zero first), then finish with the Heaven's Feel movie trilogy
Is that Kara no kyoukai?
fuck me, this show is good
aaaand that's twice in a row aquatope's left me sobbing by the end of an episode
👀
i need to rewatch Zero someday
such an extra motherfucker
honestly I think that's for the best, the arc will work much better as a series of episodes than a single film
Wandering Son is fantastic
nice
correct me if I'm wrong, but was that the same band who did the 3rd MHA OP?
the singer sounds so much like the singer from Sora ni Utaeba
*good lord you weren't kidding*
of course
where the heck are you finding the ep
and I can't wait to watch more
this show is... a trainwreck
just watched the first ep myself
One of my friends who hates Madoka insists that yuyuyu isn't like Madoka at all, and every time I look at them like: "bruh"
That was my overall take on the series too
And having just watched the finale movie last night, I can confirm it's equally amazing
VE is one of the prettiest anime in existence
EXTREMELY SO
Well, the first season is 22, but so is the second season
Yeah, it's a biggun
Clannad is more like... 44, I wanna say?
Violet Evergarden is shorter, it's only 13 episodes
both are good choices
and I honestly like it even better
also, funny Junna mentioned Angel Beats in the other chat, because that's written by Clannad's author as well
rip
will do lol
a lot
just prepare to cry
you should
Written by Jun Maeda, who is my favorite anime writer out there
<@!722121666641133608> Okay so Clannad is an anime based on a visual novel from the 2000s, it's one of my favorite anime of all time and has made me cry harder than almost anything else
I haven't seen that show, but I've heard about it
huh, interesting
wuzzat
though when I actually decided to get into anime for real, I started with FMA Brotherhood
At least that was the first anime I watched knowing it was "anime"
teeeechnically Attack on Titan?
the rest of Haruhi does not
it does slap
~~I don't much like Haruhi~~
you're not missing much tbh
though Clannad leans more into atmosphere and stuff
So they're quite similar visually
I think Haruhi and Clannad were, like, a year apart?
Haruhi's actually from the same studio as Clannad
Very similar animation style/quality
yeah
<:HibikiShock:726645026725167114>
you have made me age twenty years
I have never heard anyone call the first season of Love Live on oldie before
...
SIP?
the actual *animation* is still amazing because it's KyoAni, but the eyes definitely take some getting used to
the Key aesthetic is... a thing
lmao yeah
There are moments in the second season I still haven't gotten over
~~I like Clannad more~~
god, I have so much Jun Maeda to catch up on
and Little Busters
and Air
I still need to watch Kanon
at getting the waterworks flowing
they are both... masterful
honestly, I'd say Clannad and VE are probably anime's top two all-time ugly cry masterpieces
nice!
So me saying "Huh, I'm really enjoying this isekai" should tell you how good it is
and I'm the guy who thinks 95% of isekai is crap
I almost passed it over because a friend of mine read the manga and really disliked it, but so far I'm *really* invested in it
Yep, it's airing this season
So I currently have two thoughts about Faraway Paladin:

1) This is already one of the best isekai series I’ve ever watched.

2) I’m not sure yet why it needed to be an isekai as opposed to a straightforward fantasy series.
||It feels like a natural progression of how she's grown||
||And yet it doesn't sacrifice any of her development in the process||
What I really love is how ||Violet's arc in this movie is kind of the exact reverse of her arc in the show, returning to Gilbert instead of outgrowing him||
and the payoff is a million times worth it
takes it time, really lets you settle into the atmosphere
It's the best kind of slow burn
I am... stunned how good it is
GOD I KNOW RIGHT
Oh, I like this guy *immensely*
cannot wait for this movie
https://anilist.co/user/TheAnimeBingeWatcher/animelist
amateurs
HA
552?
why is this series' timeline so cursed lmao
that would've been awesome *and* in keeping with the show's general tone
Like, the heroes get in a bad spot and it looks like all hope is lost, and then suddenly the Rumble Riders show up out of nowhere to save their asses and get revenge
I fully expected them to come back in the final battle
so it was a short-term high that made things worse in the long run
It's just hard, cause, like, Abel "killing" the lady pirates was a great was to establish him as a genuine threat, but it also meant we got no more lady pirates for the rest of the show
oh yeah, in isolation, episode 7 had some fantastic moments
barely makes a single choice of her own volition
Like, from the moment Fena gets possessed in episode 5, she basically becomes a plot device for other characters to fight over for the entire rest of the show
The moment the story shifted focus to Abel and his manpain at the expense of Fena's agency, it started to lose its luster imo
I feel like episode 5 is where it started to go downhill for me, in retrospect
a little of it I was fine with, but yeah, it got to be way too much really fast
You didn't need to introduce all these weird bullshit magic/alt-history things to take up space and time!
it's pirates and ninjas! That's a perfect bases for telling a fun adventure story!
yeah, I wish it hadn't gotten so overcomplicated
but the dumb stuff ended up taking over so quickly, and the good stuff only had so much time before it was swallowed up
More time to spend with the characters and actual *good* ideas would make the worse parts more bearable imo
I'd probably feel kinder towards it if it were longer, honestly
So many individual parts of it are entertaining as hell, but the story doesn't come together in any meaningful way
I think my final score for Fena is gonna be a 6/10
it's like they airdropped the ending of an entirely different anime onto us out of nowhere and acted like that was the plan all along
understatement of the century lmao
and it somehow makes that premise boring as sin
actually a vampire idol anime
sounds awesome
never heard of it, is it a game?
<:MikuCry:688397678584791074>
if only
we might've had an anime of the year contender
for the whole time
if only it had just been about *that*
I had so much fun with the characters and the action and the sailing
because when it *was* just being pirates and ninjas? It was hands-down one of the best shows of the season.
that's what stings the most for me, knowing how good this show could've been if it just stuck to what it was good at
so much wasted potential
I was sold on pirates and ninjas and high-flying adventure, and instead I got enough esoteric mystical bullshit to rival Code Geass
I think that's really the biggest issue I have with Fena: it starts out with such a great starting point for a fun adventure, but then its attention drifts elsewhere and it stops being about the things that made it fun in the first place
but no, twelve straight minutes of esoteric philosophizing was apparently more important, lmao
MIeroku-chan spoilers ||correct me if I'm wrong, but did we not see Miko's parents until this episode?||
help
Guys I think I'm unironically enjoying Tesla Note
exwhat now
that too
and it's nigh-impossible to recreate such highly-detailed drawings in motion, especially with anime production schedules being what they are
he puts so much detail, so many penstrokes, in every drawing to build atmosphere
Because much of what makes his work great is his meticulous drawings
Junji Ito's work is... hard to adapt well
the horror of the unknown and how there's nothing you can do to stop it
Nah, Ito's horror is much more Lovecraftian/cosmic
I am *doomed*
the two lead characters are giving me massive HibiMiku vibes
there's a very serious problem
and there's a problem
So, I just watched the first episode of High Guardian Spice
but I don't know much about it, so I'm gonna stop there before I say something wrong
often there are groups of people who "swing" together amongst each other
where you have flings with people other than your partner, basically
this show is wild y'all
So uh I'm pretty sure High Guardian Spice just made a reference to gay swinger culture
if by "spicy statements" you mean "We have a diverse cast and lots of women on the production team," then yeah
https://animebw.tumblr.com/post/666530019345137664/i-honestly-dont-understand-all-the-push-back
this is very true, and I did a whole rant about it I should post here
I'm saying there's no problem with the recording, tho. That audio fuzz is from this video, not the show. It sounds fine in the show
that's from the video, not the show
...that's just the video recording tho
i don't see anything weird with it
I'm pretty sure that's just that guy's voice
it's not
also two prominent trans characters
Great characters, good animation, some genuine surprises, I had a very good time
thirded
but actually tho K-On
~~madoka magica~~
which movie?
your mistake was assuming they were capable of rational thought
I was proud of that one, lol
Fire Force is shit, Yuki Yuna I didn't like that much but everyone else seems to
re:zero
better interface, option for half-point scores
*cough* Mappa *cough*
anime fans were a mistake lol
of which adel aka is the saddest and loserest of all
only among sad losers who spend all their time looking for reasons to hate it
<:CarolTheFuck:617036187319795722>
...fucking hell I didn't realize that was adel aka
It was all finished and cr sat on it for years because they were intimidated by the backlash
From what I heard, the creator had to legally pressure cr into releasing it
You realize it was only delayed because of the ridiculous backlash, not because they were fine tuning stuff, right?
Lots of people
it's the Teen Titans cartoon
can't tell if you're joking or not, as that is not anime
gl
*great escape intensifies*
I'd post my lowest, but I'm not at my computer
Jesus Christ this week's Heike Story episode got me *sobbing* 
Yamada is on another level
I don't like being disappointed in Aquatope
I hope the last five episodes bring it home
and so far it still feels like we're searching for a reason that this second half even needs to exist
wrapped things up well, emotional arcs all fulfilled
yeah, the first half by itself would've been a *perfecly* good story
like, I guess Kukuru taking charge of this new wing of the aquarium might be a decent enough plot hook to center things around, but for a while there we were just sorta wandering around between different ideas and not really building to anything
now, though, it feels like we've kinda lost focus
and it gave even the least "essential" episodes a sense of purpose
The first half was built around the tension of Gama Gama closing and whether or not Kukuru could save it
I think the biggest issue is that I'm not sure what we're building towards anymore
tbh I feel like Aquatope's second half hasn't been as good as its first
Ranking of Kings expectation: cute, wholesome story about a disabled kid proving himself against the world

Ranking of Kings reality: MURDER, DISMEMBERMENT, DARK MAGIC, THE GOOD GUYS ARE ACTUALLY EVIL, THE BAD GUYS ARE ACTUALLY HEROES, GAME OF THRONES WISHES IT HAD BACKSTABBING POLITICAL MACHINATIONS THIS INTENSE
Probably my second favorite isekai
Yeah, I like FP a lot so far
Tbf I haven't seen or read bookworm yet, I have to get on that sometime
And most of those exceptions are just okay
But in isekai's case, the exceptions to the genre overall sucking have been incredibly rare imo
I agree with that
Saying MT is one of the best isekai is like saying Clorox is one of the best bleaches to drink: it may technically be true, but the medium itself is still toxic to one's health
Honestly being better than MT isn't that high a bar lol
Anilist has it as from this season, so that's what I'm going by
if you're not watching that, watch it
Heike Story
you're forgetting the best anime of the season
holy shit Aquatope's good again thank GOD
You know, on the one hand, I appreciate Demon Slayer re-airing the Mugen Train arc as the start of season 2. I always said that the arc just doesn’t work as a movie; the “episode breaks” were always plainly evident in its pacing, so it makes much more sense in TV format, especially with the whole|| last-minute surprise villain.||

On the other hand... man, re-watching this arc really drives home how much Mugen Train sucks on its own merits, doesn’t it?
it's amazing to me that the production on this episode of 86 was so clearly stretched to the breaking point and it was *still* as intense and compelling as ever
yeah, 86 is maybe the first mecha since Evangelion that I've really gotten into
NOW I NEED TO WATCH IT
FUCK
I forget how far the remake's gotten... has it reached ||Kirchies' death?|| (major LOTGH spoilers)
it feels more like watching a fictional history lesson than an actual show
tbh I feel like I respect the original LOTGH more than I like it; it's an expertly told story, but it's *very* dry, *very* subdued and *very* long-winded
I might just have to watch it now and see how they compare
That's a *fascinating* change
woah, the remake ditches the narrator?
I've only seen the original, not sure how the remake stacks up
iiinteresting
you're watching the remake? Have you seen the original yet?
I'd go a step farther and say heike is the best non sequel anime of the year
Agreed
finally watched the new Aquatope episode and GOD I'M SO HAPPY THIS SHOW IS GOOD AGAIN
Even if it sucks, it's bound to be memorable solely because of the talent involved
Okay but like... this is both Uro and Araki's first high profile work in quite some time
Cause that's what just happened to me
Is it possible to braingasm so hard you almost pass out?
Holy
My
I
Is
Is Araki directing this
OOOOOOOO
God I love ichi dake demo
that alone would make this second cours feel *so* much more purposeful right from the get-go
leading up to the developments in this most recent episode
and whether or not she's mature enough to stand on her own two feet
Have her really wrestle with what *she* wants out of this aquarium job, and whether or not she's just tagging after the girl who dragged her into it in the first place
but if the show actually leaned *into* that and made that a source of internal conflict? Bam, instant emotional connection
like, for one of the two protagonists, she hasn't really had anything to do in the second cours except play backup to Kukuru
You know, I think this Aquatope episode made me realize one simple fix that would've solved most of my issues with this second half: start exploring Fuuka's dependency on Kukuru right from the get-go
Wolf's Rain is one of my favorite anime of all time
God that sucks
fucking hell, I'm gonna miss this show
aaaaaand Aquatope got me sobbing one last time before it ended
like, it really digs into how heteronormativity hurts gay kids struggling with their identity
mature as in maturely handled, exploring complex topics
mature drama, even
yagakimi is a very dramatic work, but it's good drama
it's very true
||Well. Rip the boy.||
Cuz muh power fantasy
Holy shit
They're literally delaying the last two episodes by three months
It's at least hopeful that they announced this ahead of time, instead of waiting until after the next episode airs. Makes me think they're a little more on top of things than what happened with WEP
shame
bruh, with Ranking of Kings, 86 and Komi-san all airing?
jjk is fun
it's not everyday I find an isekai I actually like
faraway paladin's getting another season too, which I'm excited about
probably planned it to be two cours up front
heh
the movie fucks so hard
it's so good
I did a deep episode-by-episode analysis of it a while back, if you'd be interested in reading that
lmao fair enough
have you seen the anime?
if Revue Show was a 6/10, the movie's more like an 8/10
not substantially, but somewhat
hmmm... it's definitely bigger brain than the show
https://anilist.co/review/14892
read my longer review here if you wish
10/10, absolute masterpiece, holy shit
Finally watched the Revue Starlight movie
coward
*kicks down door*

HI YES FRIENDLY REMINDER THAT TEASING MASTER TAKAGI-SAN IS ONE OF THE MOST ADORABLE ROM-COMS EVER AND YOU ALL NEED TO WATCH IT
they knew exactly what they were doing there
it what now
||For a knight, there are trials. For a saint, there are demons. For me, there is you!||
||wild screen baroque slaps so hard||
you can, it's safe
||I gasped aloud when I first got to this moment||
huh? I don't remember seeing that stuff
I used them and they worked for me
best of luck to you!
If you're interested, I did a whole series of deep analysis posts on RevStar when I first watched it, you might enjoy reading my thoughts on it
it's really hard to pull that off well, but RevStar makes it looks easy
it's so compact, saying everything it needs to and not overstaying its welcome for a second
both the show's ending, and now this movie
all good things must end, and Revue Starlight's ending is one for the history books
IT'S SUCH A GOOD MOVIE
lmaoooooooooooo
the spinoff manga/LNs came after
pretty sure the first season of yuyuyu was original
they
this show is a riot
once you reach that point, you will be unable to stop
he is accurate
GOOOOOOOOOOOOO
FUCKING

No noms for Heike Story tho
that and mushoku tensei only getting like two nominations
best part of the awards nominees tbh
Gear just gets to the good stuff and kicks ass while doing so
difference is that Gear doesn't spend 15 minutes of exposition building up every would-be threat
SAYONARA BYSTANDAAAA

Oh man I can't wait for you to reach season 2
SHE
The Japanese twitter link is listed first
What intrigues me is that it looks like this is primarily a *Japanese* site
I am confuse
so a reboot or sequel doesn't make sense
volume 9 is still being worked on as we speak
except... RWBY is still going
I'm... confused what this is
that was probably second for me
Every new episode just ends with me screaming for the next one
I don't think I've ever been as impatient watching an anime weekly as I've been for Attack on Titan this season
Continued Flip Flappers spoilers ||that episode is probably my favorite episode of the bunch||
holy shit
...he what now
I swear, it's like Akebi is an unintentional horror parody of slice of life shows
he's knows for his *incredibly* deep voice
he got popular during the among us craze along with a bunch of fellow creators (Valkyrae, Disguised Toast, Sykkuno, etc)
yoooo
This was the first thing I ever watched of RvB and still the best part of the series
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R37XLt0hVAU
finally, someone else who doesn't like Yuki Yuna
yep
do it
I've heard that a lot of manga readers didn't like the ending, but we'll see
Now all it has to do is *not* shit the bed for the ending
Not to mention changing freaking studios for the final lap
that's no small feat
tbf Attack on Titan accomplishes the rare feat of being a long-running series that captivates multiple generations of new anime fans without ever really slipping in quality
Actual best anime of the year, completely overlooked
The real crime with these awards is that Heike Story wasn't nominated for anything
I love how it even lost the one category it was nominated in
Mushoku didn't deserve shit lol
Despite its ending, it was one of the most breathtaking productions of last year
WEP deserved at least a few wins
top ten screenshots with the power to kill a man in context
Latest Takagi-san episode
so unnaturally picturesque it warps back around to being creepy
There are times when this show almost feels like an overblown parody of the slice of life aesthetic
(also that hair looks kinda atrocious imo)
it's like a football with eyes
their faces are so... wide
you too! Thanks for sharing your thoughts
||Maybe someone else in her situation would've done so||
||Perhaps if she hadn't been beaten down by years of living as a slave, she'd have fought back||
||At best, she'd be alone in the wilderness trying to scrape a new life together||
||What would her life become?||
||I mean realisitically, even if Ymir went rogue and used her powers to destroy Fritz and Eldia, where would she go?||
||Eh, it made sense to me||
||fear is the strongest chain of all||
||which is a tidy little thematic parallel with the island of Paradis itself from the start of the show. So many people living behind the walls were happier with the known danger of that life than the prospect of fighting back and changing how things were.||
||It can reach the point where the prospect of thing changing, even for the better, is terrifying||
||Ymir lived a shitty life, but it was the only life she knew. And when you're never given even a chance to imagine a different life, it's easy to accept that what you've got is all you'll ever have.||
||it's more like... dependency||
||maybe stockholm syndrome isn't the best way to describe it, then||
||at least from what I've heard||
||that's not really how stockholm syndrome works irl tho||
||I really disagree with that take||
||sometimes it's easier to just... accept it||
||when you live your whole life as a slave, it's hard to imagine a life outside it||
||I think it's heavily implied she was suffering from stockholm syndrome||
spoiler text would be good I think
with the anime, not the manga
I'm caught up

oh ffs are we really still making a mountain out of this molehill
IT DO BE LIKE THAT
The Sangatsu S2 mood
So you know how in Madoka, ||the cool mentor character being killed in episode 3 ||is the jumping-off point for that show to become a masterpiece?
Well, I've come to the conclusion that Tribe Nine is like a reverse Madoka, because it does that same thing but it completely ruins the show instead
ooh, I forgot that's still a thing
he's basically the enemy of every right-wing chud whining about anime being "too political"
all very surreal shows exploring stuff like toxic gender roles, patriarchy, queer awakenings, societal ills, etc
Utena, Penguindrum, Yurikuma Arashi, and Sarazanmai
~~though I honestly prefer Revue Starlight to anything he's made~~
Ikuhara is a wild-ass director, but at his best, there's truly nothing else like him
after watching the movie, I can no longer imagine Revue Starlight without it
Let me put it this way: I though there was no way to continue the story after the show
it's one of my top 10 anime ever, mostly thanks to the sequel movie
SLAPS
fucking
REvue
Revue's director was actually a protoge of Ikuhara, so the overall cinematic style is similar
WEP is definitely in the same ballpark
can confirm
Far warning, though, Ikhuara stuff is not for the faint of heart. He isn't afraid to explore *really* dark, occasionally triggering subjects
Looks like I picked a good time to cancel my funimation account
👍
more like, exposed its limitations, I guess
hasn't like ruined the show or anything
But it hasn
I will say, I don't think Bisque Doll has done a *great* job making me care about the characters of the most recent arc like it's done with Marin
go for it
but Bisque Doll's still pretty great
I mean, I love Nichijou even way more than Bisque Doll
not even in spite of its horny, but often *because* of it
and I still think this one is great
I almost always *despise* horny shows
My Dress-Up Darling is an *intensely* horny show
Here's another piece of hype, then
It's very good and Marin is a fucking godsend of a character
Meanwhile I recently completely blew out my POW list by looking through all of Anilist and listing all the anime I have any interest in ever eventually watching
>every scene has bad CGI in overlord
>2 scenes
In other news, 86 is finally back from its long break, and it might have just given us its best episode yet
but it sucked from the beginning
I was complaining about the CGI from the start, I don't know why everyone waited until season 3 to realize how much it sucked
bruh
on a completely unrelated topic, is anyone else unreasonably hyped for this upcoming netflix movie or just me?
Rondo Rondo Rondo is mostly just recap, but there are a couple new scenes
👍
so be ready for that
fair warning, the sequel movie is somehow even more of a mindfuck than the show
valid
||it was *us,* Austin||
||even as it drives the characters themselves into the pits of hell||
||Cause it's true, isn't it? We're so wrapped up in the drama and spectacle that we wish the story could go on forever, just to get more of it||
||He called the entire audience out and I was *not* ready for it||
I have never seen another anime- heck, maybe any other piece of media ever- that so completely *gets* the power of theater
I was a big theater kid in high school, so REvue hit me particularly hard
and yeah, that|| 4th wall break ||is incredible
Revue good
~~||better hope Junna's into GILFs||~~
||If I remember correctly, someone did the math in the scene where we see all the different timelines fly by, and, uh... it's been decades at this point||
nice eye
shit, *I* didn't even notice that until now
I'm still reeling from ||Claudine vs Maya||
god the movie's revues fucking *own*
and new chapters come out every other week, Saturday 2 PM EST
thanks! I'm really excited to finally have this story out in the world
so I've commission an incredible fellow to draw for me
I cannot draw for shit

It's called Beyond the Sable Shore, and it's publishing on Webtoon
figured I'd shill the brand and all that
she's actually the main character from the webcomic I just started publishing
lmao she does, doesn't she
I did a series of in-depth analysis posts my first time watching it, if you'd be interested in reading them
Revue does that to people

Nana's name is the gift that keeps on giving
GOOD GOD I KNOW
||It's the moment where the show- and life- truly begins to move on||
||but when that title card pops up? And Act 1 becomes Act 2?||
||and nana's whole deal is that she was keeping the world stuck in place, not moving on, with her time loops||
||Cause, like, there's a very old expression in theater: "the show must go on"||
||The moment where the duel re-starts in the middle and the title card shows "Act 2"...||
personally, my favorite duel was ||Nana vs Hikari|| in episode 8
m-hm
Cause when it first aired, the first episode twist caught a lot of people by surprise
did you know it was gonna be that kind of show before you started watching?
I'm curious, what was your favorite duel?
I cannot wait to see how it turned out
it's like Urobuchi watched Weathering With You and said, "That shit slapped, I want to make a movie like that"
after watching this trailer, my hype levels exploded

😁
this is *me* saying I love how horny it gets
and remember, this is from the guy who almost always *despises* fanservice and horny stuff in anime
and it was *amazing*
let me put it this way: this episode was one of the most intensely horny experiences I've seen in anime that wasn't just outright hentai
glory to the motherfucking spearhead squadron
God 86's last two episodes were phenomenal
I CANNOT STRESS THIS ENOUGH
warning: DO NOT WATCH IN A ROOM WITH ANYONE ELSE
*oh my fucking god this week's Dress-up Darling episode*
the glimmer is everywhere
good vid?
it's a very rewarding rewatch
like, I cannot stress enough how completely the movie blew me away
make it even better
like, Revue was already a 10/10 for me, but the movie pushed it into my top 10 anime of all time
that's cause the movie FUCKING SLAPS
the direction overall is just... chef's kiss
bananice
from what I've heard Franxx is kinda shit anyway, so you're not missing much
Anime sometimes uses "animation" to refer to the entire project
I think it means he came up with the Concept for the story
(the animation did too at points)
yeah, the writing sucked a fat one
it *does* have Naruto's character designer, I'm pretty sure
for FIVE MINUTES

yes
So, the Kaguya-Sama OPs are all primarily sung by male singer Masayuki Suzuki. In these songs, he sings of his love to another person whom he refers to as “Mister” and “Daddy.” This suggests that the person he loves is a guy as well.

Conclusion: the Kaguya-Sama OPs are gay as fuck.
one of the single most emotional experiences I have ever had
I will once again recommend Sangatsu no Lion
yyyyyep
Madoka's also great
CCS is amazing as well
I will shill Flip Flap with you
eeeeexcellent
also Flip Flappers
definitely Revue Starlight then
all well worth your time
Hibike Euphonium

on a scale of emotional torment? quite a bit

hey guys
on a scale of quality? Not at all
oh hey, I just finished watching Ass Class! How convenient
clearly someone needs to watch Gintama

Perfect Blue is much better imo
not sure
it's amazing
anyway the point still stands, watch Vampire in the Garden
no mention of it airing previously weekly in Japan or anything
from this article from a few days ago: "the anime will premiere on Neflix worldwide on Monday"
https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2022-05-11/vampire-in-the-garden-anime-posts-more-cast-clip-before-monday-premiere/.185556
cause everywhere I'm looking it has the release date as today, the day it was released on western Netflix
I'm gonna need a source on that
???
since when
wait it what
entirely different thing
this was speficially made *for* Netflix
...netflix jail refers to shows that aired in Japan but weren't simulcast in the West because NEtflix doesn't so weekly releases
like an actual original
nah it's a netflix original
I beg you
please watch it
it's the frostpunk lesbian vampire melodrama I never thought I'd see realized so beautifully
and only 5 episodes
it's incredible
this just dropped on Netflix
https://anilist.co/anime/108357/Vampire-in-the-Garden/
hey guys
hey
I do say
at long last, we have proof that yuri harems can suck as much as straight harems
fair enough
we've got one airing this season in Executioner (two if you could Birdie Wing)
god what a weird resume
WAIT SHIT I DIDN'T EVEN REALIZE THIS GUY DID THE HIGURASHI REBOOT/SEQUEL THING AS WELL
well, let's just say his track record on queer stuff is... less solid
https://anilist.co/staff/123225/Naoki-Hayashi
The guy who did the second half, though...
especially with other queer work like Given and Aoi Hana
and the person who wrote the first half has a pretty damn good track record
like, one persno wrote the majority of the first half, then someone else wrote the second
honestly the flaws in FlipFlap's back half are probably mostly due to the different writers
hm... on Anilist it says it was released in 2019
which one?
's director to do another anime original sometime
I am still dying for FlipFlap
perfection
but honestly most of the episodes in the first half could quality as The Best
the multiple personalities episode was my favorite
my favorite Flip Flappers character is Papika and Cocona's relationship
in many ways
it's a challenging watch
the Megumi Ogata experience lmao

like, with just a few critical edits here and there? That first season could've been *really* good
I have a theory that Shield Hero's popularity is more based on the show people thought it had the potential to be, rather than the show it actually was
Faraway Paladin is pretty decent
I literally could not follow what was happening and why
some of the worst, most incomprehensible storytelling I've ever seen
i liked mondaji for the first three episodes and then it just went to shit
The Asterisk War Sucks is anitube's magnum opus
Your Lie in April is shonen! It's just not battle shonen
it's also worth noting while we're on the topic, shonen as a "genre" isn't technically a genre. It refers to the intended audience of a work- boys and teenage boys- not the kind of story it is
pfft
all it has different is slightly more blood
Demon Slayer is barely darker than MHA, JJK, or any other big shonen thing
whoever gave you that impression was talking out their ass, I'm afraid
I am so confused
how is demon slayer- a story about a boy killing monsters with the power of friendship- not shonen enough for you
wh
how is that non shonen?
It ran in shonen jump?
yes?
Demon Slayer is the most shonen thing to ever shonen

OH HEY SPEAKING OF HUGE MANGA NEWS GUESS WHAT ELSE JUST DROPPED
I don't know what's wilder, Wano finally being over or this apparently being the *actual* end we're approaching
...holy shit
and kudos to Mappa, it still looks damn good!
YO HOLY SHIT
especially when you realize (manga spoilers) ||it's showing what happens at the end of the manga||
the ED was incredible too, yeah
god the dabbing in the intro slew me
So after watching Girls' Last Tour, I did something I never do and went back to read the original manga to completion
and while this may not mean much from someone who barely reads any manga... Girls' Last Tour is now the greatest manga I've ever read and there's no competition
eeeexcellent
it *is* made by bandai namco studios (aka Sunrise)
I would die for her
so I just started watching Fruits Basket
hell yes
So the thought occurs to me that the way Birdie Wing is being paced, it is *definitely* going to be a 2 cours show
sangatsuuuuuu

Like, you can tell just from watching the currently airing season that nobody wants to be working on shield hero
Not their fault Crunchyroll decided to bankroll that turd of a show and force it upon them
||Revue Starlight||
||We acted it out...||
HELL YEAH'
it's a very rewatchable anime for sure
||is it dazzling?||
if you want to, I suppose
Rondo's basically just a recap, no need to watch it
||the mad max reference fucking *slew* me||
scary banana
||how about that adorable lion growl tho||
||how about that photorealistic veggie giraffe sculpture huh||
I fucking lost my MIND at that moment
My mind is still broken from the goddamn ||Claudine vs Maya revue||
Revue movie good
lmao
Maybe Angel Beats as well
that would be stuff like Evangelion, Sangatsu, and Gintama
nah, 11s are hard to come by
I rank it higher than Symphogear itself now
I shall repeat what I said all the way back when: Revue was already a 10/10 for me, but the movie officially made it one of my top 10 anime of all time
desperately hoping we get a second cours, the story clearly has so much further to go
Kobayashi did *work* on Kill la Kill, but the Trigger show he directed was Kiznaiver
that was Hiroyuki Imaishi
uh, Hiroshi Kobayshi did not do Kill la Kill

If there's any consolation, at least everyone on Anilist seems to hate this shit as much as I do
but this is just *rancid*
at least with Wonder Egg Priority you can pretend the special doesn't exist and it remains a fascinating and ambitious experience even as it goes off the rails at the end
I haven't seen a show self-destruct this badly in a long time
I liked this show a lot, but this sours it beyond repair
I'm genuinely furious
||it blames the protagonist for "hurting the feelings" of a literal obsessive stalker||
short version, ||the show presents stalker, overly obsessive idol fans as being in the right and villifies the protagonist for daring to... be friends with a couple idols||
Not that anyone cares because I'm like the only person watching it, but wow Heroines Run the Show really decided to completely go to shit in its penultimate episode huh
going from a standard of cell-era animation to a remake from one of the most modern anime studios out there
h u h
yeeeeeees
any other choice is objectively wrong
Evangelion
Anilist
most of those were crappy seasonals I couldn't be bothered to keep up with
**amateurs**

I repeat:
amateurs
HAH
>200 planning
hell yes
oh hey, the protagonist's VA is gonna be Tomoyo Kurosawa
LET'S FUCKING GOOOOOOOO
>PA Works
listen, if fucking Devil is a Part-Timer can get a season 2 after 9 years, surely GLT can get its finale movie
ah yes, peak fiction
that... I hate how accurate that is
Oh jesus, Jaune's VA is Zenitsu from Demon Slayer
welp
holy shit lmao
wait actually?
I knew I was right to peg Hachimitsu as best girl from the start
well that was far and away the best episode of Shikimori yet
It gets better
it's *really* fascinating
with a version of Richard who's intersex and struggles with body dysphoria
it's a dark re-imagining of Shakespeare's King Richard III
it is BL, in a sense
that final episode was *incredible*
okay now I'm doubly mad that no one else is watching Requiem of the Rose King
interesting
I've never seen Price of Smiles, what's it about?
agreed, Vivy slaps
but thank god they pull it back for the final stretch
yeah, season 2's weakest point is the production suffering
I still love Vivy, but its final arc definitely could've used another draft
the first season is arguably better than the second, but the second has one of the new all-time great anime finales (which isn't a full ending since there's still lots of source material left to cover but w/e)
86 is really damn good
Das down boy
it's a good show, ain't it
and increasingly gay by the episode
it's amazing
it is
that's the energy it's got going on
picture SK8 the Infinity but for gay golf girls
YEEEEEEEEEEAH BOOOOOOOOOI
manga adaptation
that one's based on a manga I think
oh, also fanfare of adolescence, five
that's four off the top of my head
Healer Girl
Heroines Run the Show
Birdie Wing
Vampire in the Garden
no there were easily more than two
yeah, to be fair it was like that in the manga too
agreed
I feel like I'm still not quite sure which
so is your issue more that adaptations are less creative than originals, or that adaptations often lack endings and are thus inconclusive watching experiences?
You try telling me Land of the Lustrous is more generic than fucking takt op.Destiny
while things based on source material can be some of the most wildly original things out there
original anime can be just as generic and cliched as anything based on a source material
yeah, that's another thing: being an original anime doesn't always mean being, well, original
holy shit I was not ready for how gay that got
WELCOME TO BIRDIE WING
welcome to Birdie Wing
My guess is they planned to just do two cours straight through (we still haven't met every character in the OP) but had to change to split cours in the middle of production for some reason
Confirmed at the RTX panel today
It's for real
They've been working on volume 9, Ice Queendom, and this all at the same time
No wonder this hiatus has been so long
HOLY SHIT

~~god the saber/shirou romance sucks so much~~
but even then it's pushing it
it works fine when it's just one girl per route in the original FSN so it's not so much a harem as it is a different romance for each timeline
yeah by far the dumbest part of any Fate is every girl in a ten mile radius wanting to jump Shirou's bones
not to this extent tho, it's clearly a kind of unluck that goes beyond normal
It's such a random character trait that it pulls me out of the relationship
Like, why is he cursed like that? Does magic exist in this world? Is it all coincidence?
My thing with Shikimori is that I still don't get how Izumi's bad luck is supposed to work
I have a new addition to my list of 10/10s
So I've been watching the new Fruits Basket anime over the past couple weeks, and now that it's done, I can confidently say that this is one of the single greatest anime ever made

||Look, I sincerely doubt IQ is saying that Weiss was secretly a nazi or anything. Her dreamworld is much more a capitalist nightmare than a fascist one, and it's also an exaggeration of all her worst instincts and perspectives. It's exploring the darkest recesses of her mind for the sake of her overcoming it, it doesn't mean she literally wants to be Hitler or anything||
not entirely sure why, but okay
Even just four episodes in, this is already ten times better a version of the Racist Weiss subplot than the original show
see, what I really like about IQ is that it's doing what a semi-canon spinoff *should* do: taking one of the weakest parts from the original version and expanding on it to flesh it out and make it actually work
||it's a semi-canon spinoff fleshing out the period right after volume 1, which inclused expanding that racism subplot to make it not quite so... terrible||
||well IQ takes place between seasons 1 and 2||
||lmao, well this show presumably *is* about her learning to not be so much like her racist authoritarian dad, so I guess it fits||
||not so much Nazi I'd say: only Weiss' clothing is vageuly Nazi-ish. It's much more a capitalist authoritatian hellhole||
those 5 are my faves this season
oh, and Ao Ashi from last season

and she's equally fantastic at both
now instead of being the stoic quiet girl, she plays the hyperactive goofball who ruffles the quiet girl's feathers

god bless Chika Anzai
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b55u1gHmQ2w&ab_channel=TheRealKuru
and then she realized she was trans and basically completely reshaped her channel
welcome to the ride
this all could really work
yeah, that could work
oh shit, she was Neiru in Wonder Egg
that also gives me confidence that they're going for what works artistically over what would be popular and hype
actually the overall look reminds me a lot of the JJK OPs
guess they're going for a more grounded aesthetic
okay, assuming this is how the show actually looks and it's not a pre-rendered trailer (which is what happened with AOT), this is going to be *incredible*
...holy shit
it's not my favorite anime of all time for nothing

Yeah the revue movie goes HARD
adorable
(who's the kid tho)
holy shit I love XDU so much
WHEEZE
at least that's what I've heard
probably cause Tim's kind of a conservative jackass and they don't want to be associated with him anymore
yeeeeee
It's incredible
The revue movie is what made revstar  one of my top 10 all time anime
is this that "reborn to study the blade" thing
*motherfucker this is literally just Maria's weapon*
I'm starting to think Symphogear is just a modern nanoha remake with singing and twice the gay
that too
aesthetics, characters, themes...
I'm halfway through A's right now and it's really getting hilarious how much Symphogear borrowed from it
oh hey guess who's finally watching Nanoha
Legends never die
have fun
oh shit, watching Eva for the first time?
nice
lmao is that what strange fake is about
might still fall apart, but I get the sense it at least *thinks* it knows what it's doing for now, so that gives me hope
but this episode made me think that the overarching story could really end up working
before, it was just a jumble of background details I more tolerated than anything else
I also think this was the first episode where the actual plot started to click in place for me
yep
||I was not expecting the tragic BL backstory but I am here for it lol||
but between that, the stupid pervert jokes, the first female knight being introduced and immediately needing to be rescued in the next scene, and the knowledge that I'd probably have to suffer through two cours of this shit, I ran out of patience
it's the kind of thing where I'd probably be more willing to stick it out to see if it gets good, if not for how terrible it looks
some good ideas, some bad ideas
honestly, aside from the terrible animation, it was just okay
Well, I managed to stick with the Lucifer and the Biscuit Hammer anime for six episodes before giving up on it.
Something
This is going to be
Fuck
HOLY SHIT WHAT

Me: “Okay, we’ve all had our fun pointing out the many similarities between Nanoha and Symphogear, but I should probably give it a rest. It’s not like everything in this show is something Symphogear borrowed for its own purposes.”

Nanoha A’s: “Here’s a probably True Evil blue-haired male villain swooping in to hijack the female antagonists’ more sympathetic and understandable mission for his own selfish purposes.“

Me:
one of Koyasu's best roles for sure
correct
they should've done two full seasons' gap between cours like Mushoku did
yeah, that mess is all on Aniplex
so yes, 86 is well worth watching, and you can easily skip all the recap episodes
It's like the polar opposite of what happened with WEP's finale
they actually delayed the final two episodes for three months because they were like, "Yeah, sorry, guys, we know this production's been a mess, we're just gonna take all the time we need to actually make this finale as good as it deserves to be instead of rushing it out and having it be bad."
the story isn't over since there's more to adapt, but it reaches about as perfect a stopping point as it could and pulls off the final catharsis and denumont spectacularly
hey, so despite 86's production being a clusterfuck, it managed to right itself at the end and the final two episodes are genuinely one of the greatest anime finales I've seen in recent years
Kaguya, 86, Lycoreco... their originals and adaptations alike have been absolutely baller
A-1 has really been impressing me recently
>eva
>show from the 2010s
not just recycling footage, but giving a new perspective on it from the people who helped make it
it was pretty cool
one of its recap episode was the voice actors reacting to key scenes from the anime and giving their thoughts on what it was like bringing them to life
tbh even 86 did some cool stuff with its recaps
yeah, cours 2 is when the production issues hit
this was "it was supposed to be 11 eps and was 11 eps, and then there was a recap as well for some reason"
this wasn't "it was supposed to be 12 eps but production issues forced them to make the last ep a recap"
I remember when it was airing, Anilist had it listed as 11 eps from the start
except the first season was originally *listed* with 11 eps
Gonna throw in a curveball: the best CG animated series I've seen is RWBY from volume 6 onward.
But I do excited be
...still trying not to get my hopes up too much as he might just mean he'll write Yuri into his future stories
HOLY SHIT
well HELLO
https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2022-08-17/one-punch-man-anime-gets-3rd-season/.188770
Is not what filler means
That
Fair enough
You say that like it's a bad thing
<:MikuCute:672908542763859968>
Thanks!
Yep!
HEY GUYS I'M A PUBLISHED AUTHOR NOW
https://www.animefeminist.com/being-a-better-man-the-healthy-masculinity-of-my-love-story/
As it should
thank you so much!
fucking wheeze
https://highstrionics.tumblr.com/post/693156386499100673/watching-lycoris-recoil-ep-1-with-my-aunt-and-upon
but also ||AAAAAGH TAKINA'S LIL BLUSH||
finally caught up with lycoreco ||oh shit next episode's gonna be *good*||
God yall are making me so impatient to finish work so i can go home and see the new lycoreco episode
bless Shaft and their ability to draw in legendary artists for their endarcs
that's wild
Bro today's RWBY IQ episode had an endcard drawn by the character designer of Lain and Haibane Renmei
nice
from here on out, things are gonna bet veeery interesting
episodes 1 through 6 are kinda like the first arc of Evangelion
episode 6 good
chomping down episodes like potato chips
definitely one of the most bingeable shows I've ever watched

aaaanyway, if I can divert this conversation in a less unconfortable direction for everyone, I just finihsed season 2 of Kaiji
ugh, please don't talk about "political correctness" like it's a real thing. Brings up too many bad feelings
but don't try to pretend it's something it's not
I gneuinely don't want to judge you
listen if you just enjoy that kind of story, that's fine
he's the one who decides whether or not the slave collars are safe to remove
write the story differently
my guy you realize the author can just
read above
like I said
yes
having an in-universe excuse for "slavery is good when the protagonist does it" does not, in fact, make it any less disturbing to me
they do
bro I watched the show
his daighters who want to jump his bones
oh hey what a coincidence that's another "slavery is good" isekai
does it tho
and this isn't even one of the ones you mentioned
...fuck my life there really have been that many haven't there
ah yes the "sex slavery is good" isekai
y e p
tonight's chapter was *everything*
Mage and Demon Queen spoilers ||DEATH BY SNU SNU LET'S FUCKING GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO||
By far the funniest thing about Nanoha StrikerS is that even after like 15 years of in-universe time has passed, Nanoha herself still can't escape the writers' flailing attempts to un-homo her sexuality
the wait for next episode is killing me
IT SURE DO BE
YEEEEEEEE
Observation from the first episode of Nanoha Strikers: GUNGNIR DATTO?!
||Also this shot fully reminds me on the mountaintop scene from Hibike and now I'm even less okay||
Lycoreco spoilers ||GOD FUCKING DAMMIT I KNEW THE ANGST WAS COMING||
ASUKAAAAAAAAAAA
he's a good boy
who's Xanthe?
I cannot imagine it being half as good without them
So much of the show's greatness comes from its Japanese VAs
I have not watched it, but I would not recommend it
it was wild
finished Nanoha StrikerS. Watching this show was like doing an archaeological dig and uncovering the ruins of the civilization that would one day become Symphogear
Anohana
I swear to god, Symphogear is literally just Nanoha fanfiction with the serial numbers filed off
StrikerS ||oh hey looks like Dr. Ver repaired the Frontier again||
Nanoha StrikerS spoilers ||Local woman discovers the existence of lesbians, more at eleven||

Lycoris Recoil ||I suddenly have a very bad feeling that Mika's gonna end up dying in this attack||
God, Kinema Citrus budgeted their entire schedule for this one Made in Abyss episode, didn't they?
HAHAHAHAHAHHA
why why why why whywhy why

lycoris time pog
👍
because if you hated it, then this movie will be *agony* for you
I guess my question is, how did you react to Arisa and Kureno's subplot in froobs?
pfft
the rest of it
but to get to it, you have to sit through...
fwiw Fruits Basket is one of my few 10/10s, and the final third of this movie was fucking amazing
so if that sounds like your thing, have at it
in that exact order
and 1/3 as beautiful and heartbreaking as Froobs has ever been
1/3 romanticization of ||child grooming||
1/3 recap
lemme put it this way, it was:
yesn't
just watched the Fruits Basket prequel movie. Not even the car accident I had last night gave me so much whiplash.
This looks like the crossroads between Yama no Susume and K-on and I am so down for that
oh no this show kicks ass

I didn't notice any issues with them
OKAY WAS ANYONE GONNA TELL ME AOI YUUKI WAS THE FEMALE LEAD IN EDGERUNNERS OR

Made in Abyss continues to break me
well
...oh lord
jesus that's a nightmare
DRESS-UP DARLING S2 LET'S GOOOOO
true enough
wait I take that back it's obviously Zwei
bold of you to assume anyone in team RWBY has a braincell
smh Blake's a catgirl not a foxgirl
Oh man you reached The Episode
OH GOD
anime or otherwise
and then there's End of Evangelion, which... yeah, honestly, I think End of Eva is my all-time favorite movie
then I watched it a second time a year later, and everything just fucking *clicked*
the first time, I could tell it was a masterpiece, but I wasn't quite sure how to articulate it or how it affected me
Eva took me two watches to parse
oh man you are in for a TRIP
fwiw Netflix has the director's cut versions, though I don't know if you like using Netflix
so just make sure the versions of episdoe 21-24 you watch are longer than your typical episode
I wholly prefer the director's cut
the broadcast didn't give them enough time to put everything they wanted to it (and they were pretty much out of resources by then)
21-24 have director's cut editions
Oh right, something very important for this stretch of episodes
good luck
well
oh no
you're gonna hit episode 22 next weekend
...wait holy shit
(and you haven't seen the whole of it yet)
And now Gendo's attachment to Rei suddenly makes a lot more sense
||how about Eva 01 going berserk huh||
a lot
yeah, episodes 19 and 20 are
lmaaaaaao
what episode did you just finish?
one of Trigger's best
then you're really gonna like Edgerunners
hell yeah
it's basically impossible not to have a strong opinion on it
yeah, it's a very polarizing film
taste is a very funny thing
hey, maybe the junk cube robot will stand strong
LMAAAAAAAO
yeah it do be like that
spoiler from the comments section
(warning: kinda epileptic video)
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzbLODUb1sA&ab_channel=LakeshoreRecords
Also this song had been lodged in my brain ever since finished edgerunners
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pN0EgZ_tFVU&ab_channel=AborshionMaster
i just like Tomoyo Kurosawa noises
don't worry, there will be substance
Oh my sweet summer child
noice
(though I still prefer Kill la Kill for its pure insane creativity, but this is plenty fantastic in its own right)
I think focusing his energy with a pre-established world, so he had to work within parameters, led to his most focused and best written work yet
Taking a week off to prep for the double length finale
I mean there's Mako in Kill la Kill
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZDLHIbyqmI&ab_channel=stewpit
Eight season slow burn
Adventure time
worst love triangle... possibly ever
god do not remind me
like, I'm pretty sure this was before Garnet's secret was revealed in SU, that's how foundational Korrasami was to queer rep in American cartoons
but for back then? Even just them holing hands in the final shot was groundbreaking
yeah, it onyl got explicit in the sequel comics
and from what I've heard of the Harley Quinn show, it sounds like HarlIvy has a lot of the characters working through their problems and becoming a functional couple together
it is
...dammit I saw My Love Story and got excited for a second
holy shit A-1 slow your roll a bit
👀
A-1 is really popping off lately
And A-1 pictures, huh
do we even have a teaser yet?
that soon?
w... winter?
praying it's trash so we don't have to pretend to care about it
we been knew about that
yeah, it was just a fantastic show from every angle
wheeze
you got a link to that?
fucking superb
yep
well that was a wonderful fucking finale
wish me luck
lycoreco finale is up, I'm going in
Welcome to Asuka
Yep
the SCENE
rip
oh god and now episode 22
yeah
it's
yeah
true true
great action, great direction, solid story, interesting themes, hilarious comedy, genuinely affecting drama, yuri vibes for days... what more could you ask for?
Welcome to the final stretch
and good GOD episode 21 thorugh 24 suffer from it
which has super limite animation and clip show elements
arguably as far abck as episode 20
it was affecting the show well before then
||yeah I wouldn't be surprised if that happened||
||which is why it's so beautiful||
||It's just... so hard to figure out if that final shot is hopeful or despairing||
yeah, they literally just made two anime at once this season
I should probably watch the Nanoha movies some day
watching the first season of Nanoha is like watching a good show claw its way out of the corpse of a bad one
^can confirm
I disagree with the idea that Geah never uses nudity for cheesecake, but otherwise I agree
oh fuck made in abyss finale time
Yoh Yoshinari went *off* with the character designs
unsurprising cause it sucked lmao
it was not
if nothing else it was vastly ahead of its time lol
personally, I blame Thomas Covenant for the rise of truck-kun
something that is nearly nonexistent in the world of isekai writing
ah, don't you see, that would require actual talent
Land of Leadale did that (and it still sucked lol)
tbf this is arguably a problem with manga as well, but I agree it's very noticeable with LN adaptations
feels like things are still moving in very interesting directions by the time it's over
having watched to the season's end, I think it's got more steam than you'd expect
Melua don't click ||I was gonna flip if Mel said the Akari timeloop twist was braindead lol||
though to be clear you're still in volume 1 territory, volume 2 is the show's second half
ah, okay, yeah, that one was pretty predictable
which twist, out of curiosity? Cause there's a few different twists you could be referring to
Re:Zero's funny because it was one of the first isekai web novels of the boom, but because it was adapted well into the trend of isekai being made into anime, it came off like a direct respone and critique of the common tropes and conventions
It's like 40% complete irredeemable garbage, 25% utter trash, 15% bad, 10% painfully mediocre, 6% just okay, 3% actually kinda good, and then that last 1% is Re:Zero and Executioner
and that's still a very small percentage
Everything else is, at most, good enough
in all the modern isekai boom there have been exactly two isekai I consider more than even just above average: Re:Zero and The Executioner and her Way of Life
it fits so perfectly into the show you'd think it was made for it
it boggles my mind that it was in the game originally and not written specifically for Edgerunners
god i cannot get this song out of my *fucking head*
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzbLODUb1sA&ab_channel=LakeshoreRecords
joke's on you, my nuts are always ascended
and justified it by making the characters either wrong or liars
I also think Anno just... changed his mind on certain details midway through production and retconned them midstream
new, horrifying stuff
every time I rewatch it I pick up new stuff
now we know what happened to the first two
you may remember in episode 23 after we meet the new Rei, she says something along the lines of "I guess I'm the third one"
d
n
e
the
they literally made something from almost nothing
It's really fascinating how this ending came about as a result of the production basically running out of resources, and yet it remains one of the most legendary anime endings to this day
they really don't know what they're talking about
and people say Eva is cynical
congrats, Anno invited you to his personal therapy session
when the production goes off the rails but you still turn in A+ work
the Fuckening
ah yes
even though I watched FMAB dubbed I know the original JP cast is stellar
god I miss him
the lad
*slightly different voice* "Fullmetal Alchemist"
"Fullmetal Alchemist"
FMA Brotherhood, maybe?
first episode was p fun
ah yes the tanuki rakugo show
which isn't a bad way to justify it in-universe tbh
it is singular in a way that nothing before or since has been
this is an ending worth sitting with
of course
I've picked up on so much from going through Eva multiple times
Remind me to link you my evangelion re-watch analysis once you finish End of Eva
the classic
funny, everyone I knew complained about how slow it was moving lol
it's called Candy Flurry, and it's only 19 chapters
it's great
there's a scene where one of the bad guys pauses in the middle of a fight to scold the deuteragonist's classmates for not being good friends to him
anything having to do with the villains was comedy gold
not much meat on its bones, but the characters were fun and it has a seriously great sense of humor
So I decided to check out this cancelled Jump manga on a whim and it was pretty fun
...today I learned
HAHAHAHAHA
||WHOEVER DECIDED TO MAKE GUNDAM UTENA I LOVE YOU||
holy FUCK
holy fuck
just watched the first episode of Gundam Witch
And all of it integrated very well! You can barely tell where the CG mechs and hand-drawn mechs trade off
yep
and even beside that aspect, it's a damn great show
it is
we are *blessed*
god I still can't get over Gundam Witch going full Utena
This is one to be excited for, everyone
And it's s great studio and director too
I haven't been so delightfully blindsided by a premiere since Zombieland Saga
holy shit Akiba Maid War
Hehehehehehehe
madoka dot jay pee gee
ah I read that wrong
wait, Urobuchi was a cast member in a Kamen Rider?
||of course there's no telling how closely to Utena this show will hew, but it's definitely worth being prepared for some genuinely rough stuff||
||Utena was a *dark* fucking show||
||I mean... if it's gonna follow in Utena's footsteps, then things are not exactly gonna be sunshine and lollipops by the end||
yeah that one's fun
huh
...wait I'm just now finding out he also did the script for the Berserk movies
||also Devilman Crybaby, funnily enough||
never read the manga but the first episode is fantastic
yep
can't wait to meet her for real
this one gag alone has made me fall in love with the horned girl
obligatory Eva 4kids opening joke
this is my first Gundam and I clearly made the right choice
one of my top 10 anime of all time
Revue is fucking spectacular
preach
please tell me that's a season 3 announcement
didn't try it, just saw it
hey look it's gundam witch from mercury
Tfw no ufotable tax evasion dollars to throw around
they're a very old, very prolific studio that hasn't really made any of their own productions but have worked on tons of other people's
It's fucking hilarious
unironically one of the best anime this season
Bocchi the Rock
whoever is working on these titles deserves a raise

fuckin lmao CR

Chainsaw Man, Spy x Family, Bocchi, Yama no Susume, Do It Yourself, Akiba Maid War, Urusei Yatsura...
there are too many god-tier OPs this season
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
fucking hell Aoi
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pPLLv9Wru8&ab_channel=PuniPuni%2FHololive%26VTuberclips<:Ver:704169051391524875>
it's living up to the bar that season 3 set and I do NOT say that lightly
it's been kicking ASS
what a crazy world we live in
instead my frontrunners are Bocchi... and My Hero Academia
the crazy thing is, going into this season I thought my AOTS was gonna be either Chainsaw Man or Mob Season 3, maybe Spy x Family if it really kicked it up a notch
it might just get there
like, I don't think it's my number 1 yet, but if it can nail its slowly developing emotional elements as hard as it's nailing the comedy?
Honestly? I'm shocked by how much I agree
the godzilla parody made me mcfucking lose it
the original 80s ova
me
jesus christ today's Bocchi episode almost made me pass out laughing
Every episode gets more Utena and I am here for it
You maybe wanna say that's a Manga spoiler cause I clicked on it thinking it was just anime spoilers
||I was really confused because they have that shot of Hisame covered by the blanket like she's naked underneath it||
i mean
BUT I DON'T THINK I AM
I WANT TO THINK I'M MISREADING THINGS
okay someone tell me if I'm getting confused, but I'm pretty sure To Your Eternity just (spoiler AND content warning) ||made the protagonist have sex with a child who's also the granddaughter of his attempted rapist||
I
did you seriously just
what the fuck To Your Eternity
um
<:CarolTheFuck:617036187319795722>
On the audience's front, at least, production is a whole other story
Tbh if the shortcuts are so well hidden that most people won't notice them, does it make a difference?
It still looks GREAT
The weird thing I haven't noticed any of these issues filtering through to the show itself
Oh no
Oh hey SEA is me now
That may well change as things get worse, but for now, the finished product is still holding strong imo
Behind the scenes issues aside, G Witch is not yet suffering as a SHOW because of them
Millhi, there is a difference between saying "this show has a troubled production and that's going to lead to problems down the line" (which I agree with to be clear) and "there arent obvious issues with the finished product yet," which is what we're arguing
Um
Machikado *is* a 4-koma
fuckin finally
bro they don't stop lmao
||mother FUCKER IT WAS RIGHT IN FRONT OF US ALL ALONG||
||Aerial
Aeri-al
Eri-al
Eri||
||...motherfucker||
suffering
oh shit, I didn't know that! Nice!
ADSHKJASDHKJASDHA
made that same observation a few hours ago, glad to see I'm not the only one who saw it
YES INDEED
YEP
pov you're watching a Naoko Yamada anime
I think she also wrote the Blue Period anime
name a better duo in anime
Reiko Yoshida, who went on to work with Yamada on Silent Voice, Liz, and Heike Story
yoshida was the scriptwriter, right?
everyone say thank you naoko yamada
it's just not the focus
although whenever it *does* do band stuff, it knocks it out of the park
K-On does have plenty of band stuff, but it's much more an episodic coming-of-age tale than a hobby show about high school band
It's too plot-driven and shonen- adjacent
Birdie Wing doesn't count as a cgdct anime in my opinion
You are so lucky
Dammit, so it's not available for us commoners yet
WHERE DID YOU WATCH THE NEW YAMADA
HOLD ON WAIT I JUST PROCESSED THAT
~~also unlike akebi, bocchi isn't creepily obsessed with middle school girls' feet~~
even if I wasn't that impressed with Healer Girl
I'm referring to Cygames shows specifically to be clear, 3Hz I have no problem with
~~try all of them~~
~~maybe this time it'll actually have writing instead of a bunch of candy-haired marketing gimmicks ineffectively moeblobbing off each other~~
indeed
as a piece of art on its own merits, this writing is *excellent*
I'm talking on its own terms
I'm not even talking about adaptation
it honestly reminds me of Kaguya-sama without the romance, that's the level of densely packed writing/visual flair it has going on
and insanely well-written
fuckkin immaculately produced and directed
it's also just
Mob, Chainsaw Man, Spy x Family, MHA, and Gundam Utena all outdone by a shambling, pink-haired wreck of a teenager
...fuck my life Bocchi the Rock is actually anime of the season
hgfghdgfdghdjhgj
BALL EPISODE BALL EPISODE BALL EPISODE
frustratingly mediocre
wish I could find some way to read the manga cause it looks cute
i saw that, it's really great
mmm, crispy
absolutely recommend
not sure whether it'll end up being 25 or 50 episodes when all is said and done
halfway through the first cours
HOLY SHIT FINALLY
SILENCE
something about the lighting
it *is* very aesthetically 86, honestly
perhaps
you think anyone from 86 worked on that OP?
...god dammit lol
lmao aspect ratio indeed
like, basically all anime, excluding Netflix originals and maybe a couple other outliers, air on JP TV first and then go up on streaming services internationally
yes but, like, they still *air* initially on JP TV
||I mean, yeah, most anime *is* TV broadcast||
I just had to pause in the middle of today’s Bocchi episode and collect myself because I was laughing so hard it hurt.

Jesus Christ.
Wait which one
oh this looks fucking *sick*
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62_aXZGkG3E&t=57s&ab_channel=avexpictures
Nice
god give this man all the shows
do we know who directed this episode?
I KNOW RIGHT
I always love when a show is good at the slower character and story beats in between the big moments
that was a good fucking gundam episode
I need him to direct everything
and now I want to do some kind of symbolic analysis of the OP because good fucking lord is it beautiful
So the other night I got sucked back into my Heike Monogatari brainrot after watching a couple AMVs
oh shit is it stone ocean day?
oh gotcha
umehara?
oh, and Reiko Yoshida
if I see the name Jukki Hanada, Jun Maeda, Naoko Yamada, Gen Urobuchi, Mari Okada, Tetsuro Araki, or Masaaki Yuasa anywhere, it goes on my list by default
yeah, having staff I like on board instantly pushes it up my anticipation list
there are always the obvious must watches- Chainsaw Man was always gonna be on my watchlist, ditto all the sequels to shows I already watched- but when I see something where I have no idea what it is, I usually check out the trailer to see how it looks
mostly, I just go down the seasonal charts ahead of time and see what looks interesting
interesting
and it certainly was
instantly unique art and music, so many energetic cuts and editing, this screamed "this will be like nothing you've seen before"
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6LiyZ0p_uLw&ab_channel=DaikuMediaAnime
whereas an anime trailer that instantly got me excited to see the finished product...
it's not even gonna be interesting enough to warrant a hate-watch
I look at this, and I see a show that's mostly gonna be lifeless cinematography and annoying characters, with the insert song desperately trying to create the illusion of hype where none exists
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZFUElWhYAs&ab_channel=AnimePreview
as an example of one of those bad PVs, have this
I like seeing a trailer and thinking "wow, the people making this really loved making it"
an unusual story, a new animation style, even just familiar beats executed with enough passion to make them feel fresh again
as for what gets me excited, though... I like seeing things I've never seen before
I'd say that works out 99% of the time, and that rare 1% where a bad PV actually has a good show behind it, I usually catch up eventually
so if all they have to show is dull panning shots over generic settings and characters while voice actors spout asinine lines in voice-over, that's usually a sign that it's gonna be a waste of time
after all, trailers are supposed to highlight the best parts of a movie/tv show/whatever
sometimes I'll watch a PV that just looks terrible and go "yeah, no need to waste my time with this"
it varies from project to project
true enough
I'd like to be proven wrong, but that PV doesn't give me much confidence
you have more faith in the artistic ambitions of an idol-adjacent megafranchise than I do
sadly, judging from the trailer, I suspect it's just gonna a generic moeblob cute girls doing generic cute things with some light yuri teasing that goes nowhere
Things I was not expecting to ever see in Jojo’s Bizarre Adventure: ||an open acknowledgement of the horrors of lynching and racist bloodline fearmongering that persisted in America well after the civil rights movement of the 60s.||
the plot summary talks about a boy and girl starting a band, so prob no
with Science Saru animating again
new Naoko Yamada movie coming 2023

https://anilist.co/anime/155202/Revenger/
OH FUCK
OH SHIT
So that was 100% Bakugo in this week's Pop Team Epic right
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmyUZkQpSOE&ab_channel=%E3%82%A2%E3%83%8B%E3%83%97%E3%83%AC%E3%83%83%E3%82%AF%E3%82%B9YouTube%E3%83%81%E3%83%A3%E3%83%B3%E3%83%8D%E3%83%AB
wait nevermind just a special episode BUT STILL
**GUESS WHAT JUST GOT A SEASON 2**
Hopefully the extra time will help take the stress off some of those production issues
oh shit you mean ||the earthian girls||
WHAT WHERE
and that trailer... did not inspire confidence
tbf I haven't seen that yet, but everything else I've seen of them has been miserable
everything I've seen of them suggests otherwise
oh fuck
oh no
>studio platinum vision
I cannot believe we're getting another Miyazaki film
https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2022-12-13/hayao-miyazaki-how-do-you-live-film-opens-in-japan-on-july-14-2023/.192872
my god
the entire Bocchi squad and three Gundams
I've heard good things about Kaiju NO. 8, glad to see a solid studio like IG producing the adaptation
well *hello*
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-1wTVWKQe8&ab_channel=TOHOanimation%E3%83%81%E3%83%A3%E3%83%B3%E3%83%8D%E3%83%AB
Yama no susume is right there
Diy isn't even the second best cute girls show this season
I'm curious, has anyone else been kinda underwhelmed by the latest Mob Psycho season?
very
BRO
<:MikuBliss:336657233712513024>
*quietly removes NnT from my watch list*
...
*watches video*
oh hey, Sarcastic Chorus put out a new video on shipping in Nanatsu no Taizai, I wonder what it's-
if the JP side is loving it as much as western fans, it's pretty much a lock
I mean, dress-up darling got a season 2, so we can only hope
can't believe there's only one more bocchi saturday left
GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
FUCKING
LET'S
they're all stupid people, but that's probably the logic
K-on is too cutesy for some people probably
It could easily shoot up another percentile
but in the immediate after math? Hot on the heels of a likely superb climax?
like, yeah, over time the score will probably drop a little and nestle into a comfort zone
but I mean more the immediate post-finale bump
true enough
and let's be real BTR is shaping up to have a *great* final episode
nah, a great final episode can pump up pretty much any show's numbers
for reference, this is the same score as Attack on Titan final season parts 1 and 2, Haikyuu season 3, Vinland Saga, Ashita no Joe 2, and *Clannad Fucking After Story*
and it's higher than Chainsaw Man, Spy x Family, Jujutsu Kaisen, Code Geass, and Cowboy Bebop
and what's really scary is that once it finishes airing, provided the finale is as incredible as it's shaping up to be? this score could shoot *even higher*
bocchi sweep motherfuckers

what
but now they're gone
there were definitely yuri tags on this manga back when I read it
...wait a second
like, no other possible way to interpret it
I fell off the manga before it reached that point, but it was very clearly setting up an explicitly romantic relationship
and yet
the point is I was certain something so obscure would never even *sniff* an anime adaptation
looks like it was originally an LN too? didn't know that
it's one of a bunch of yuri manga I read a while back
Troyca I'm on my knees
I just hope enough of them don't get condemned to terrible studios
YURI FANS STAY WINNING
FUCK YES
https://anilist.co/anime/159039/Seiyuu-Radio-no-Uraomote/
might as well link this here too: I wrote a review of Yama no Susume's fourth season and why I didn't like it as much as I wanted to
https://animebw.tumblr.com/post/704182927954788352/short-reflection-yama-no-susume-next-summit
I think Akiba Maid War just had the best finale of the season
...mother of god
It's so good
it only had a one-week delay for production issues after episode 6
yeah, GWitch's two delays here are for other programming reasons
we were crossing our streams
ah i c
after already delaying an entire month two episodes ago
it's delaying an entire *month*
Yeah, but that's not what's happening with Kancolle here
how broken *is* this production?
this is the second time they've delayed an episode for like an entire month
https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2022-12-23/kancolle-season-2-anime-6th-episode-delayed-to-january-19/.193269
speaking of delays
nah we knew about this already
it sticks the landing so hard I actually had to bump my score up an entire half point
better than mob, better than yamasusu, better than diy
but right now? Yeah, this is the greatest final episode of fall 2022
and plenty of anime this season have a chance to surpass it as well
plus it's got heavy competition from Kaguya-sama and Komi-san
Cyberpunk Edgerunners aired this year, after all
I mean, it's not the *outright* best finale
also Gon and Killua are boyfriends and no one will convince me otherwise
It's a little slow at first, but it's a wild ride that never stops being entertaining
one of the best shonen anime of all time
it's fantastic yeah
kjsdfhskdfjhsdkfs you're not wrong
tbh I'll even half-stand up for The Day I Became a God
lesson learned, never underestimate PA Works
I KNOW RIGHT

me after episode 12:
Me before Bocchi episode 12: Yeah, this show is fucking fantastic, but I don't know if it'll really end up as one of my all-time greats
for different shows
yeah I've seen ton of kiss edits
oooh nice
wait who?
Like are people just ignoring the scenes where Kita's still hardcore crushing on Ryou?
While Kita is still head over heels for Ryou
See I agree that Bocchi x Kita would probably be the best option for a romantic subplot if they decided to go in that direction (they absolutely aren't, but it's nice to dream lol), but to say it's canon and definitely happening?
I figured they would, there were still a lot of characters in the OP we hadn't seen
BRO
wait, is this nakayama's directorial debut?
both in cinematic language and animation quality
csm feels like a movie
nostalgia is one hell of a drug
i still do not understand how the new bleach anime is so highly rated
I doubt it'll reach that point lol
but still, nice to see
oh it'll definitely fall over time
speaking of bocchi
it's good to know that no matter the language or country of origin, Extremely Online Dudebros will never change
it's numerically tied with LOGH, Mob Season 2, one of Gintama's biggest arcs, and A Silent Voice
Bocchi is number *fourteen*
speaking of bocchi take a look at Anilist's highest rated anime of all time
Hahaha haha what a mess
Impromptu discussion generator: by some miracle, you’ve become the head of a brand-new anime studio, and the powers that be have given you a blank check to produce an anime adaptation of any five properties you desire. Which do you choose? This can include continuations of unfinished adaptations or remakes of adaptations that sucked and deserve another shot.

My five would be, in no particular order

-Girls Last Tour finale movie

-Mage and Demon Queen

-The Chronicles of Thomas Covenant

-Bloom Into You season 2

-A Tropical Fish Yearns for Snow
So you can watch that one first and then watch g witch so you don't catch up to g witch before the final episode is out
Well lycoris is already finished
Hmmmmm
I can't blame her, it fits so well
something about the key it's in just feels more fitting
but tbh I think I like Bocchi's version more
I didn't even know it was an asian kung-fu generation song at first
clearly they were nerfing its power
and this is the one they played badly during the episode 8 concert
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYBQJfPBmRg&list=OLAK5uy_mNWkxcU6VC_aWOFnpqYha-J5UMzwbVlx4&index=5&ab_channel=kessokuband-Topic I think this one's my favorite
god the bocchi soundtrack slaps so hard
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TovqLDCosk&list=OLAK5uy_mNWkxcU6VC_aWOFnpqYha-J5UMzwbVlx4&index=2&ab_channel=kessokuband-Topic
I can't believe they apparently got some legendary animator to return to TV anime after like 11 years just for that whole scene
such an underrated show
also kudos to Raven of the Inner Palace for shooting up so high on its final lap
Gundam *sweep*
wow actual based
Cause one of them was just okay and the other was one of the best ops I've ever seen in my life
Okay but which ranking of kings op
very much disagree
with kids who feel like actual middle schoolers?
an actual romance?
whereas Takagi is like
see the difference is that nagatoro and uzaki are both fetish pandering and suck
cringe take ngl
not anime of the year good, but definitely the most Haikyuu thing that's happened since Haikyuu
Ao Ashi was good
also lmao get fucked bleach
indeed
it was the first ikuhara work I watched, and I fucking struggled with it
I feel like I want to go back and rewatch penguindrum at some point
ZANMAI
SARAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
i'll take it one step farther: Revue Starlight is literally a metatextual Utena sequel
someone who hasn't seen Yuri Kuma Arashi try to explain what's going on here
as opposed to penguindrum which kinda lost me
as for Yuri Kuma... well, jury's still out, but it's a good sign that I can actually tell *what* the symbolism is supposed to symbolize so far
Utena and Sarazanmai threaded that needle much better
Like it loses the relatable human story amid a tangle of confusing symbolism
I feel like Penguindrum is too far up its own ass at points
please do, it's fantastic
off the top of my head: Eren triggers the rumbling in AOT, the final scene of Edgerunners, Bocchi shredding to save the concert in Bocchi episode 8, the confession scene in Takagi season 3, the episode 1 climaxes of Akiba Maid War and Gundam Witch...
hm, my favorite scene is a pretty close race, I think
||Nah, it's a play on the phrase "to 86 something, i.e. get rid of something||
GOddamn this guy's been everywhere
WAIT IRON BLODDED ORPHANS TOO?
ooh, and that weird Mari Okada/Mappa movie that's still happening at some point
and looks like he's doing Mashle next season
Ao Ashi, Urusei Yatsura, Classroom of the Elite
he's... doing music for a *lot* of recent stuff, actually
yeah, looks like it
so now I'm really excited
and I goddamn *loved* the Froobs remake music
including the score for the modern Froobs remake
and he's done a *lot*
but *this* is the guy credited with season 2's music
https://anilist.co/staff/102520/Masaru-Yokoyama
hasn't done much else in anime, thought she's apparently done a lot of music for other shows and movies
this is the lady credited with season 1's music
https://anilist.co/staff/126473/Harumi-Fuuki
ooh, interesting detail about Tsurune season 2: it looks like they switched the person doing the music
I'm so fucking happy KyoAni is back
god
fr tho I haven't thought about Tsurune at all since I finished the first season but this season 2 opener blew me away
~~and they are very cute~~
So, uh
the first episode of Tsurune season 2 is out
and I know nobody cares because the first season was KyoAni's most thoroughly Okay(tm) show and nobody but me watched it
but jesus christ that animation was movie quality
HOW DOES KYOANI'S PRODUCTION KEEP GETTING MORE LUDIROUSLY IMPRESSIVE
HOW
my only real criticisms are that ||I wanted the protagonist's first moment flying to have a little more oomph behind it, and I wish we got a little more time with Euphy to understand her place in society before it all comes crashing down around her.||
Yeah, I really enjoyed that first episode
genuine question, was that show even any good before the production hell set in? Cause I got the vibe that it was another Konosuba-like "parody" that isn't actually a parody and mostly just wallows in all the same stale instincts
nope
right, mask of truth
I legitimately can't remember
man has white fox even put out anything recently?
it was not
hahahahahaha this is gonna suuuuuuuuck so much
dkjfhdsf wait oh my god they switched production to Lidenfilms
eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee *hack cough sputter*
eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
far from the most unique-looking anime, but hey, B- is better than D+
at the very least it's *trying* to have a strong visual identity
interesting shots, unique color choices
whereas with vampire lesbians, not only is there some honest-to-god sakuga, I can tell there's at least some creative direction
it has a more unique art style but that's about it, the animation looks as cheap as ever
regardless, that trailer doesn't exactly look good to me either
huh, somehow I thought Project No. 9 sprung up in like 2018 or something
what's netoge
did they tho
seems like they're putting some actual effort into this one
also okay, that PV looked decidedly Not Terrible
today i learned
huh
...DO YOU MEAN YUKI KAJIURA
>kny composer
huh, send the PV over, lemme check it out
doesn't matter, it's gonna be shit either way
>project no 9
congratulations on discovering that the big harem anime of the moment is predictably kinda shit
and also the book sucks anyway so the cover is the only interesting part about it?
i mean when the cover's that ugly?
it was jank as fuuuuck
i mean that's pretty much the entirety of season 2
What s the point
I mean why delay the streaming services if you're not delaying the anime
What sense
How
and a promise of more
you realize there's an actual kiss in birdie wing
like
...so does birdie wing
ah yes when I kiss another girl on the cheek and she's obviously attracted to me and another character literally says "Yuri is happening!" totally bait
Birdie Wing, arguably
adachi and shimamura
what a trashfire that show was lol
ah netzuso trap
stuff like that is why I struggle so much with the early 2000s aesthetic that nanoha springs from
it is not
it's the second half- especially the climax- where it loses me
i disagree, I actually really enjoyed the first half and change of Strikers
ah yes, the nanoha season where it becomes hilariously clear just how much symphogear ripped off this show
maybe not as ambitious as Utena, but it's probably his most consistently entertaining show
yeah, I loved it
hey, Sarazanmai slapped super hard
that was a weird-ass show and I did not enjoy it that much
welp, just finished Yuri Kuma Arashi
so I'd say it's still up in the air
but that's pretty circumstancial evidence
TBF the only real evidence we have one way or the other is that one scene where everyone gets ikemen haircuts and make jokes about having "dalliances with women", and Bocchi's only pushback is that she's too nervous to have dalliances with women, not that she's not attracted to women in general
i see where the wires got crossed there lol
yeah
I meant Kita
so I wouldn't expect any real progression on that front
the character herself is gay, but bocchi isn't a very romance-forward show
original steampunk-adjacent fantasy from the writer of School Live and Akudama Drive
put this on your watchlist
https://anilist.co/anime/155089/GIANT-BEASTS-OF-ARS/
hey yall
like, yeah, being nominally anti-slavery doesn't mean you can't still perpeuate that system or internalize a superiority complex about it
it also isn't afraid to point out Anne's hypocrisy and let her realize it herself
also, take notes, 50% of shoujo manga/anime, *this* is how you justify the main dude being a dick to the main heroine without him coming off as a creep
take notes, Shield Hero, *this* is how you explore slavery in a fantasy setting
was not expecting that
same god damn
Is that really her name
Wait what lmao
Mel once again flexing on all of us
and it's *really good*
someone decided to remake A Place Further Than the Universe as a judo anime
https://anilist.co/anime/136435/Ipponagain/
guys
oh no
guess we'll give that one an honorable mention
also true
your loss
I have missed it so much
and I have missed it
it's like the entire industry suddenly remembered all at once that dogshit isekai slop wasn't the only kind of fantasy out there
the Tale of Outcasts
Giant Beasts of Ars
Sugar Apple Fairy Tale
Revenger
all of them
So who decided it was finally time for classic fantasy anime to come back in fashion and how soon can I marry them
No spoils I haven't watched yet
lmao nice
right sorry
when most of them just wanna feel superior
your mistake is assuming they have a sense of shame
now they're just pretending they were always on board and being all "lol Gundam newbies weren't prepared to get dark, what show did you think you were watching you losers"
Yeah episode 3 was definitely when I started really enjoying it
the obligatory lesbin aquarium date
MagiRevo is really good
god I can't believe I'm really liking another isekai
Chisato best girl 2022
Fr
Of a different show
Yep, but not of lycoreco
this is going to be wretched
fuck
...oh no
this just looks flat and moeblobby
the manga's art is more angular and shoujo-sparkly
it's the eyes and how round their faces are
they just made them the oregairu girls
I knew those designs felt off
fuck you're absolutely right
you
i am in misery

whyyyyyyyyyyyyy
a no-name studio that literally just appeared this season and has only worked on a garbage isekai with terrible animation so far
not looking forward to the inevitable Queelag's Ditzy Sister Falls in Yandere Love with the Chosen Undead arc
bah, you know they're gonna stretch it out with like two arcs of filler to avoid catching up to the manga

wow the new dark souls anime looks great
dark souls anime adaptation looking great

I'd also recommend The Fire Hunter, the first episode just aired and it is *fascinating* stuff
that too
seconded
the message is that Mindy Kaling is a hack
that's a beast of a film
on another note I also watched Inu-Oh a few hours ago and god damn Masaaki Yuasa's still got it
yep
aka the elusive and endangered Good Isekai
The Magical Revolution of the Reincarnated Princess and the Genius Young Lady
all incredibly worth checking out
my top 5 of the season are vinland season 2, buddy daddies, magirevo, tsurune season 2, and ippon again
you bet
or- and hear me out on this- you could try watching a *good* show instead
maybe they decided they didn't want to wait another five years to have enough material for season 3 lol
geez those hiatuses
so either this is a long-term planning thing confirming they *will* make a season 3 when there's enough content... or they're going anime original
bro
that's where we're at in the manga?
three chapters after season 2 ended?
wait so like
how far ahead is the manga at this point?
holy shit
eeey
you're the best
alright, I know this is a long shot ask, but does anyone know a way to watch The Last of Us without getting an hbo max account?
there's no other explanation
okay so this show has GOT to be purposefully bad for rage bait engagement right
but knowing Mappa, they probably just fucked up their scheduling so badly they didn't have a choice
my hope is this means they're putting All The Effort into the animation and making sure everything's top tier
so this is gonna be a very short part one
what's doubly weird is that there's only, like ten manga chapters or something left, right?
instead of assuming they were approaching the end
they really should've just called it season 4 when they had the chance
It never takes that extra step to be more than a pleasant distraction
Healer Girls biggest problem is that it's just so aggressively OK
I wouldn't go as far as lank in calling it the worst romance ever- uzaki exists, after all- but my god was it mid for my tastes
Turns out I will HAPPILY sit through hundreds of chapters of well executed buildup (hi komi-san) over a boring romance that just happens to get together quickly
Tonikawa is proof that getting together early is meaningless if the couple isn't good to begin with

thank god I bailed on nier after the first episode good lord
Okay how does one do strike through text on mobile
~~I doubt this anime will either lol~~
Only a matter of time I suppose
i mean, is misfit uniquely at risk?
is that likely?
what the fuck is going on
from 3 different studios
literally three aniplex shows delayed indefinitely in the same season
dare I ask if it's also an aniplex show?
is it an indefinite delay?
...another delay?
TIME
FUCKING
ABOUT
IT'S
https://twitter.com/OfficialRWBY/status/1617915284794544130
on a completely unrelated note:
we can only hope
depends if they've gotten any work done on the second half yet, I suppose
frankly if they managed to keep from collapsing during the first half, I'd say they're at least more prepared to handle those challenges if they show up again
OH GOD DAMMIT NOT KUBO TOO
god damn, *now* Farmland Saga is starting to hit its stride
Ngl that's pretty metal
I don't know what you're talking about that would be amazing
not a direct adaptation
I... think it's an original story?
apparently so
3) after the season's done they start uploading the episodes to Youtube
2) a week later it's available on RT's website for free
1) episode premieres for RT First members
I believe the order was:
they are, just not right away
I'm pretty sure you just had to wait a week?
they'd upload old seasons to Youtube after they were finished, but if you wanted to watch them as they aired, you needed an RT First subscription
they'd already moved to an RT First-only premiere system a while back
well the youtube uploads haven't been a thing since like, volume 6 I think?
I do wonder if they realized just how bad their public perception as a company was at the moment, so they decided to put RWBY on a streaming platform where people could watch it without giving their money directly to RT
less than a month god damn
feb 18
is this a concert?
Nijika's the glue that holds everyone together
yeah
<:ChrisOi:586551700987576330>
isn't the other girl her cousin
ayup
I remember that gif lol
Code Geass is fucking batshit bonkers
unless you count glorified power rangers outfits as mecha
okay that one's really stretching the definition
>tiger and bunny
so I have a bone to pick with the genre lol
it probably doesn't help that my least favorite anime of all time *and* the first anime I ever gave 1/10 are both mecha anime
||love how the first female character with real agency is turned into a helpless damsel who does nothing for the entire second half except die at the end||
yyyep
it's Gurren Lagann without the bullshit, which I greatly appreciated
Promare is very fun
outside of the great tech design, sasuga Anno
actually I take that back, Gunbuster *really* sucked
Gunbuster kinda sucked
Diebuster was decent
I have seen both
or "excellent in some ways but to inconsistent/uneven to consider a contender"
but outside of those, every mecha anime I've seen is pretty good at best
oh, Promare and FLCL would end up somewhere on my list
There's also Planet With, I guess, that was pretty good
Evangelion, 86, and Gundam Witch
I have seen far too few mecha anime I actually consider great
yikes
introverts unite
nice dam
cause good lord there is *nothing* but mahjong in that jawn
like, the only sports show I've seen that I'd describe as just about the sport is Akagi
it sorta makes me think about sports anime, which also have that problem of people being like "Oh, this show isn't just about the sport!!!"
fun question, are there any mecha series where you'd say they *are* actually just about the robot?
and gundam is *the* robot show
hell, from what I gather even Gundam wasn't just about the robots
sometimes not so much
sometimes in good ways
especially the last one
some of them are very gay
Break the world's eggshell
they be lesbianing all over the place
FOR ME, THERE IS YOU!!!!
for heroes, there are trials!
for god, there are devils!
that kuromaya revue lives in my head rent free
do you wakarimasu?
it simultaneously fixes a lot of Nanoha's long-standing problems while introducing a boatload of new problems
BEST GIRL HAS ARRIVED
Honestly I feel like so much of the affection for gunbuster comes from everyone loving the final episode so much they forgot how garbage some of the earlier parts were
Yep
They were straight aaaaaass
I just hated all the romantic subplots

The bocchi song wasn't actually a song from the show, it was one of the album tracks
It is now playing the g witch ed
On another note the sushi restaurant I'm eating at just played Bocchi the rock on the loudspeakers
Lots and lots of guns

Nao has the best faces
tbh I haven't been feeling this latest arc as much but this episode *really* turned things aorund
So if anyone's interested, I wrote an article about one of my favorite anime of all time and one big issue it has that I haven't been able to stop thinking about. Enjoy!

yes
fair
She's the reason it's not in bad tier
I liked the deadpan girl
Healer girl was very mid imo
pretty sure I got all of them
alright losers judge my taste
I've burned through burnout before, I can take it
this is after dropping like nine other shows I was watching but lost my interest fyi
amateurs
This is the most heccin adorable thing I've ever seen
