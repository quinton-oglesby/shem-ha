The back side is the swan song.
My girlfriend just gave me the best birthday present ever. Nothing is printed. She painted everything herself.
If Shem-ha is the god of this planet, is that the god Fine fell in love with?
I'm just sad I never got the ignited X-Drive I hoped for. Well maybe there will be an amalgam X-Drive
Yeah, it probably died at the end of AXZ, but I didn't say it would be coming back.
Maybe the thing from the preview is maria going berserk? She was the only one going berserk from using ignite for the first time. I'm still waiting for the call back to Hibiki going berserk after all.
Nah. Tsubasa is a phoenix, Kiraka is a Lion, Shirabe a horse but I don't know what  Hibiki is. Maybe Chris looks a bit like it. But out of all Maria looks the most like it and was the first thing that came to my mind, when I saw it.
The head, the legs. The tail not as much, but still.
Don't know if anyone has already posted it, but I think the thing, when Maria uses the ignited modul looks a lot like the thing in preview
