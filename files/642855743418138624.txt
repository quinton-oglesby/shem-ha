…I might need to rewatch the movie.
Ok that’s ketchup
I don’t think it was ketchup. No seriously. It would be impossible for ketchup to spurt out of someone’s neck if 
1) they weren’t using real weapons.
2) it was practical effects.

Just saying
Some people are just born that way
From what I’ve seen at least
They’re probably from extremist groups or have racist upbringing
Not anymore I guess
Bruh
Oh hell
RIP
