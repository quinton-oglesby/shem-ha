As much as it pains me to say this, I‚Äôll be stepping down as Illuminati for an undefined amount of time due to upcoming A-Level exams. You‚Äôre a great bunch, so thanks for making my time as Illuminati a fun one. <:aquasalute:385235559565492237>

We can all agree Symphogear has some pretty amazing music. Thats why I'd like to run a celebration of said music, where anyone interested can submit something to do with Symphogear music, be it singing, playing, or hell, even mashing it up and creating memes of it. Its a fairly difficult task that may require a lot of effort, so before we get any further I'd like to get an idea of who would be interested in taking part. If you are interested react to this comment with <:greentick:396521773245530123> and if we get enough, hopefully we can all get this to work!
@everyone Police Story watch #1 begins in 10 minutes. The movie is 1 hour and 40 minutes, but if you don't have time, worry not as there will be a second watch in 6(?) hours. Come say hi if you aren't doing anything: https://cytu.be/r/symphogear
<:ohayo:341255117464666112>
they were pretty hasty
it was ibu
unless
sure why not
so the random lynch then?
ok
wait so are all here, in game
Aye
so there are only mafia and town rn?
she lonely now
poor kiri
ok, im in character now
*oh god should I?*
also ez name change
more of a hamlet
its a small town
talk
it wasnt me
it does seems so
or its game
town gotta lynch mafia now
and then there were 3
so
morn
yes we talked alot
I dont see why ibu says it could be either one of me or lucifer
so it seems
sleep well my child
oh, quick meta question, if we get killed can we write wills to share our thoughts if we die?
Rakhi
yea
I am
mhm
in pushing blame
nice playlist
*I believe in you*
oh
bloop?
huh?
~~just de-mod for the evening~~
<:meguOoh:358116975752249344>
what do you mean, you existed last time
words
dicaido
the choice is yours lucifer
Dicaido
yea
yea
so that is where my vote lies
you would have hopped on immediately
if luci was mafia
its dicaido
ok im alot more sure now
ok, I accuse dicaido
who knows
would anyone call themselves a *yo-yo master*
can anyone here use a yo-yo?
but I wouldnt have proof for that either
it was me?
so
I would say not me, but I have no proof
why would it be me?
<:thonk:414150292506935316>
do tell
so lets think motive, why would people kill rakhi?
<:thonk:414150292506935316>
bring me up to speed, whats it about?
'at the killers request' seems a tad fishy if you ask me
anybody got anything to go off of?
we dealing with a sick fucker here
oof
playing the ultimate ruse on us
who knows
maybe its both of them
one of them might have to die today...
big shots
again, oddly specific
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/288524112786358282/469973882141671425/tumblr_pbog55sN891sk3s93o2_540.png
SAVE US KIRI
thats, kinda lewd
üá´
death is good, if its good death
Lucifer
yea
yea
ok, im ready to vote
that ibu got gotted cos of the stuff said between matches right?
we established earliar this game
ok this just seems really fishy
I mean you say that...
but so have you, right
im not sure
are rem and either saki or kabuto
my thoughts now
so
ok
<:NotLikePapika:284132078054932480>
<:thonk:414150292506935316>
*oof*
wait is rem still in this?
we got lucky with a good guess
doesnt that just make the doctors save pointless
NL?
guess so
morn
>Nice names
lmao
why radical?
evening everyone
talking huh?
im not sure why you did
gotta be honest
Gun!
!gun
Kabuto
oof ouch owie
your sate for blood must wait
no lynch
killing people is fun
as much as I like to save people
Yea
¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
who knows
maybe i'll get lucky again
instantly
like
they would have counterclaimed
if an acutal doctor was here
so helping myself in that situation, however cowardly would be a good move
would you not agree that I was number one target though?
but turns out I could
I acutally had to ask myself
oh, they can
and I am no .1 target from last round
as A ded medic is no use to anyone
I chose to save myself
Im medic
ok
same tbh
how lewd
you arent all maf right?
*cmon guys work with me here*
any reason for not saying anything
good good
is Homura here?
than just waiting
random lynching has a higher chance of killing a maf
we cant just let maf get theses lynches
but one thing for certain
or wait a night
üòâ
now might be the right time
however with a doctor...
possibly,
cop is the only one with information
you havent said anything
Homura
oh, very much so
looks like an easy frame imo
and why would that be?
ive seen worse getting my doctorate
while nothing gets said
slowly whittling away your numbers
if none of you fuckers do anything maf are gonna win
then when they have numbers, I get lynched
maf will just outnumber me
thing is I cant do that
hi target
*I gotta save somoene*
so anyone else want to make themselves a target?
so it would seem
we can cut the head off and play football
I have a doctors hacksaw
anyone got anything to say?
so
one death on my conscience
how do you know
anyone counterclaim cop role?
no one said anyhting about a cop
also ibu thats suspicious
doctorate, but cant count
sorry I cant count
can I confirm fine?
4 people left?
4?
?
so, how many left?
failed again it seems
oh dear
wrong reference friendo
*baddies ibu
oof
Homura
who hasnt saud yes
but you playing too low-key for me
sorry if no maf
I trust my gut
oh
fuckin shady shit
hol up
woah
whao
no hard feelings
im gonna go for Homura for being bit too quiet
2/5 are maf
so the 6 are here
I change
yea
nay
so who's left?
**SKREE KAWW**
reminds me of phoenix from dota 2
wings of flame
<:BitesTheDust:363775692913115137>
Lily
yea
ok im ready to vote
seems a tad off no?
we have been blessed with two cops
I find it hard to believe, that with a game size of 7
I see...
last night?
tell me exactly
who have you visited
ibu have you visited homura?
one problem I ahve
1 sec
wait wait wait
almost as if accepting
and were slow in changing
you were one of the only not voting for
part of my will: Night 3: Rakhi saved. DO SOMETHING please town <3. Lily protecting homura a tad too much it seems (ibu switched not to seem susp?)
I have a feeling its lily
true true
it should be game
so if there are 2 maf left, which I do hope not
lily, any thoughts?
and womens
evening fellas
üëè
Also good job maf
Smh what's with all the early risers today
Not day
I'm on phon
I'm not gonna be able to write hella good notes this time
Word
Would I be willing to take the risk
If I were mafia
No u
If I were not insane
But then the mafia would be dead
<:BikkiWink:391790927082946560>
Facts check out
Kill shirabe?
So I'm an insane cop
I like it alot
Oh I like it fine
If I am insane then I get told lies
I could be insane
More than one cop
But pats Is dead
And shirabe was village
I was told pats was mafia
I reached pats and shirabe
I was told I was cop
So
I have things to say
Ok
Bless you
Poor fine
*lynch
No lunch
Postpone
Yea
So I'm ready to vote
Can gather more info
That means people with roles like cop
Hopefully they won't again if the situation remains the same
Since maf didn't kill
Do we want to wait another night.
Funn
Ah...
Oh, how many are in the game btw?
Anyone want to claim roles?

most of the time that'll be good for me
yeah, fair enough
I will say though, i'll be MiA for alot of the time this week, with work and the like
I appreciate the effort
gotta do it properly ya know
lmao
lmao
dont worry, it wont leave these walls
ah, understood
<:meguOoh:358116975752249344>
I probably wont be in contact with anyone on it, but i'll try to keep things friendly if possible
I was active for like a day on valk, didnt like it and left
anything I should know?
uh
ooh
cheers, glad you enjoyed your nap mate
how long ago was that?
gotcha
is there a command for temp mutes?
i'll save that in my notes server
sounds good
will I write that in here then?
right
ah, I loved the announcement
*please keep the ties in XV*
i'll still have dess role, thats all I need
if thats the case im alright with it
gotcha
yeah, I appreciate it
so what powers will I have at my disposal?
ah cool
wait are we talking about doing the gmod thing now
sounds worth it to me
*what is going on*
7 quid aint too much
ah no, but I can aquire it
cheers
is this the one I should register to?
http://symphogear.wikia.com/wiki/Symphogear_Wikia
oh, I should probably do that
ah cool
all sympho mods?
so what is the server?
ah, cool stuff
ah
symphogi?
although thats kinda come to a stop
konosuba is tryna revamp their wiki too, full volunteer sourcing too
*you got alot more shit planned than the konosuba subreddit*
wasnt it a bot command?
which one is up next?
ah cool
oh that'll be awesome, any real timescale on it?
A surprise to be sure, but a welcome one
also looks like plenty of people want to mod the server, which is understandable
yeah, I guess Krotash was fast with his DM's
alrighty, looks like they've already got 1 person, almost a second to replace
and if it ever gets too much here, i'll let you know too
because goddamn this is getting hard
and basically handed in my 1 month notice
i gave it some thought
alright thanks all
very true
i'd like to get at least 1 or 2 new moderators indoctrinated and implemented before my conscience allows me to leave
yea, thats whats keeping me back
im not even sure if there is anything or anyone there that I would stay for any more
we get 8-15 new users per day, most who lurk, so we cant even keep track of the people joining
yeah, I would much rather be here than there
its a very common 'my first anime' so we get all the edgy 12yearolds who shitpost really annoying stuff and the like
ah god, /r/Konosuba is falling apart from the seams. We've lost a mod, leaving us really short on them, and alot of the older active users left too. I dont trust anyone left in the server to be a mod anymore
oh my god they're actually cats, this is amazing
* I got through it
ok think its done
sure
so there is a smol corridor completely blocked
the enemy locations are saved when I die
sadly
right, so that is the way im meant to do it
room filled with crap, I have no weapon and cant run through it
issue is I cant
alright so playing through the start i have no idea if im meant to have a weapon, there seems to be huge numbers of enemies and some ammo drops, I just cant tell if im bad at garrys mod or if im genuinely going at the game in the wrong way
I really feel like this place is a source for good
found
wait nvm
how do I change the number of players?
sounds cool
alright then, I got the mods all downloaded, whats the next step?
179 to be exact...
*I like it*
quite a few mods
thats uh
cheers
not sure how to
no
so, im on the start screen, whaddo I need to do?
or isnt there a way
oh, since I got gmod dyou mind if I join you?
also speaking of work, do we have an ETA for any projects planned?
`wait you actually have to do work as a moderator and its not just a shiny badge? Whoda thunk it`
cool
i'll be back in 10
yeah, I have a pretty sizeable soundcloud playlist I use
still thinking tbh
gotcha
*waah's sadly*
mornin
<:NotLikePapika:284132078054932480>
<:TsubasaYareYare:407397617451139073>
<:pepohype:396017191918764033>
founded
profile lookin a bit like this
Scrmz_Internally
alrighty, tutorial all done
steal shit with a magic stick or something
this game's concept is amazing
oh my god
alright im hitting things with a baton and stealing them now?
have a good day anyways, im off now
ooh, i'll be looking forwards to hearing more in due course
no worries, take all the time you need and im glad its all sorted now
this is a good advance
feelsbad
alright then, its getting a bit late for me so im gonna go off now, but I have my last day of work tomorrow so all being well im gonna stay up later these next few nights. Have a good one all
It could be that, but it is also possible that people just have stuff on
afaik no, when I joined this channel that was the first I heard of it
oh my god I love the cellist so much
√†h no problem, had food
goddamn weebs
*it was gonna be so good*
i'll be having food in like 5 or so minutes, so I might be away for a lil bit
all good then
im more worried about you not enjoying dragging me through
yeah, im loving it
Promise I didnt spend 3 hours trying to get all of the shards on that one map
I was just coming on now
yeah definately
*please work, its 4 in the fucking morning*
yeah
oh no
im already at 28 hours on steam
well, when did I get this game? 2, 3 days ago?
we're pretty much finished though
many
ah rip
gotcha
yeah, I like that
would it be a good idea to ask the people taking part / in the role what they think?
hope ya have a great time and all
that'll be great!
still loading for me
ooh, whats going on?
I really like that one
personally I would really hate to write that kinda thing about the characters I love, but I dont write very much so perhaps that gets old. I like the idea though
in 30 days I swear im gonna be so confused
<:GenjurouThumbsUp:267393750349643776>
dess_remind me 30d get dota hats from Seuyan
whats the remind command for kirichan?
*it'll be worth it*
thats... a long time to wait
üëÄ
oh, also how is the fli fla watch coming along?
alright, sounds like a plan
personally I feel like keeping everyone informed is important, since they are the ones writing the prompts
I like the idea, should we ask everyone how they feel about longer times to write?
I love that
Ahh, it all makes sense now. Cheers for clarifying
Why is that relevant <:HibikiWhat:336656482907193344>
Yeah, I recall
Monochrome?
Wait so how far is this into development? It just seems a little early to be discussing economy
I feel like we're gonna get a majority doing 2 and i'd be surprised if we see ones for the others honestly
ah, looks like the prompts went down well this time
*I mean its gotta be Fin√© and her lot*
I really want to see what you write about
ooh, Jazztronauts flavoured jam, my favourite
whew, reading through this was a real nostalgia trip...
dess_remind me 16h Register for Maplestory <@290431224596660224>
probably wont since money is kinda short
gotcha
wait so with the maplestory thing, is the registration open now, or later?
<:IrisTHIS:457676348031500293>
I feel like we dont need official warnings, but a word saying please dont say that should be enough
looks like the site is having issues
<:BasaExcite:391790924843319298>
how would we do that? Find it online and watch on rabb.it?
group watch of some cool aciton movie
`action movies`
`are we goin half turtle or full turtle?`
eh, as long as the alt obeys rules no one gets hurt right?
they're the reason we had to implement opt-in nsfw
they aint gonna be that smart
the kid is 14 yearsold
at this point i'd much rather have the IP ban
I imagine they'd get complaints since say two siblings could be in the same server, if one gets banned the other would also
wait nvm
irc?
this is getting ridiculous, some kid started creating alts today and rejoining konosuba discord after we banned their main around 2 weeks ago.. Currently at 5 alts so far
alright, I dont actually know where I put my name down...
1 hour, should be
looks like they're the same timezone
Yeah <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
Cyber security has always interested me tbh
Ah cool
Oh, I don't think I ever saw, what do you study?
he did so much for so many people
it hurts
can ye do that on whatsapp?
ah fair enough
colleges are standalone establishments, whereas sixth forms are directly connected to other secondary schools, usually taking more of their rules
yeah, our 'high school', or as we call it 'Secondary school' is from 11-16 age wise, then two more years spent in either a college or sixth form before going to university
*oh god thats fuckin scary*
a year ahead of me then
right
iirc college is a completely different thing over here
oh and since your education names confuse the hell outta me, what part/age are you in R?
keep an eye out, regardless
ah, thats a good point
personally I dont think a whatsapp group without a professor is an issue, ive had one for the past 6 years, and ive never seen anyone try to use it to cheat, but I dunno if that will be different for you
ah, doesnt look like it
its not more than 25GB is it?
ah, it wont let me download it for whatever reason
aight cool
is it literally just making an account
right, so how is it that we sign up for maplestory?
I shall sleep
*have fun*
<@!127644949884698624> alright, you up for some jazz?
and please, take all the time you need
i'll be like another hour or so
yeah, ive got food coming in a little bit too
<@456226577798135808> and <@!127644949884698624> do either of you want to hop back on to jazztronauts at some point today, maybe get all the upgrades, find some cool maps?
*but damn*
good writing
its... probably best not to
I have seen...
is it supposed to make the reader really fuckin angry, because thats what it did
I read the weedfic too
sounds like ya had an adventure yesterday...
tbh I usually only play in 3-5 stacks. Today was my first time playing out of one for at least a month, and it reminded me why I stopped. It would be cool to get a group of people together though and play a game or two, maybe inhouse if we get enough people
ok so im just looking through steam and my friends list bored and I see you have 4.4k hours on dota Alice... Honestly cant say I saw that coming
<:HibiMiku:432007202136391690>
personally it seems like he's dodging the apology, but maybe thats his way *of* aplogogising
yeah, im feeling that too
understandable tbh
all I can think is that there was a way out of this... this was not the way out
dess_warnlog <@256945399338631168>
Lotta emotions and all that. Glad I can trust you to keep me in check <:ErisWink:367245398441459722>
Sorry yeah good point, I'm tired and going to bed now
oh god, I just wanna say please never make the "levels from talking loads" a thing to publically view. One of the other mods in Konosuba was bored so showed everyone pie charts of who said most in what channels and now people are spamming the fuck outta channels trying to say loads
ah...
wait who is this?
so far they seem quite friendly
sounds like a good time, I might have to join you
Ah, good to hear
Whew... is everything alright?
oh, and its moderation based, which hurts even more since im trying really fucking hard
and they won't accept any other information
especially when you trust them
man, getting criticized by someone that doesnt see the full picture really hurts
if there's anything you want me/us to help with i'd be happy to
S
*Country roads, take me home*
*to the place I dont belong*
this is good
I've had a quick look and I can't see anything, but it could work as an april fools
this is either where you get top marks for the rest of the class because your prof is into gacha, or you never get loaned an IPad again
I didnt recognise it
I remember seeing an actual name about 10 minutes after they left
does kiri have to be in the same server to see who it is?
as in the burg?
As for watching, I'm pretty sure rabb.it doesn't allow you to play files ~~although I think there is some convoluted way to get it to work~~ so that failing, anyone else have ideas?
`the things Kirichan does for us`
`What a wonderful time to be awake`
dess_remind me 11h find some Kung Fu movies
I should have some free time tomorrow, I'll try to have a look what stuff gen shows Hibiki, failing that look for good kung fu movies
So we're gonna need a list of movies to watch then, and then a way to watch them
Trap the server in a god for 4 days?
`anything special?`
What are we doing
Ok, so this bikki birthday
Started with this, and kinda missed the whole point about lat not wanting loneghost not to use the word triggered in the wrong context
Image work?
What.
since most of them seem to be xdu related
is there an XDU event going on?
It seems too pointed if we make one so plainly to pander to jacq
I think a snow day prompt with a little acknowledgement that you *can* do skating should work
I'll be out for another 6 or so hours but if you still do when I'm back I'll see what I can do
Good upgrade <:GenjurouThumbsUp:267393750349643776>
Oh I love this one
*sigh...*
Sounds good
Is the thing in xdu too lewd?
I can't think of any ideas for it, but I'm not too much of a writer so it might work
*college/uni time?*
I'm fairly interested to see how their execution of it goes
for me it cements the idea how good the writing prompts concept is
I like the change to kirichan, are you gonna do the same with shirabe.exe?
what are you thinking of?
Please, stay safe.
how much did it cost?
thinking of getting some sympho merch tbh
nyaa~ indeed
love it
<:meguJoy:358116714468212736>
or uh, if you're gonna open it now and not save for later that is
ok now thats done, I wanna see
*obligatory bitching*
`what in box`
*ooh*
I know some places put trackers on to look at what you search and the like
do you know what restrictions/observation tools they have on it, if any?
ahh sounds cool
I dont see any mention of an annaversary party
i'm still in valk if that helps
dess_remind me 18h refund OJ 4 pack
yea i'd be down
<:meguDed:238539575264280578>
would taking a small break, going for a walk or something help?
`Pats R`
yea, glad I dont have to interact with people like this quinn guy
cant say I recall seeing her
ah right
DL?
I imagine at first the prompts and stories will come fairly regularally, but soon they'll begin to slow down as the ideas get thin
shoulda gone through now
alright thanks Kriisa for letting me refund OJ <:GenjuurouThumbsUp:336657189475188740>
Is anyone else willing/able to host police story tomorrow? If not I don't mind but it'll be kinda early for the US folk
best of luck
as long as they're available yep
also holy fuck im just looking through it now and it looks awesome
its a 1 hour 40 movie
if I host it, it cant start much later than half 10 my time
I might see if I can download it
also the video has a chance of being copyright taken down since it only has 22 views and has only been up for 20 days
i'll leave it running, can someone check if they can connect?
https://cytu.be/r/Scrmz_Internally
Ive got a cytube thing running and it looks like it will work
will this work? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PVtmEPnR1s
Yes, my landlord called Richard
I'm just glad I've been lucky to meet people like you who are good at this kinda advice stuff
ah fairs
it queued a different song than I played

ok I think the bot might have a small problem
dess_remind me 7h download police story
I like the idea of 2 streams
Every other day I'm free
I'll be doing karaoke on Friday online but there's no reason why k can't have the stream running in the background
In that case I gotta download the video in case YouTube takes it down
Something like in honour of bikki birthday we'll be watching police story on x day
Would it be reasonable to reschedule it to another day then?
I'm gonna sleep now so if you want to make an announcement and need me to host go ahead and use the times I've given
If those don't work someone else might have to
Evening, this is
For me it's gonna be starting 10:30, maybe 11:00 UK time at the latest
*that show was the best*
I think it was mythbusters?
I remember seeing a thing on it
appreciate you telling me
I do realise, and it scares me
*ooh lemme just look down the barrel to see if anything is in there...*
important stuff, but yea I get what you're saying
oh, is it fairly common sense if you know how to use one then?
what does it take to get one? Just filling out a form?
between remind and 8h
oh, you missed out the me part
dess dead?
eh?
so worst case we can play it without subs in japanise
ok so update on the version I found, the download doesnt have subs, and i'm not sure how long the upload will last on youtube
Cool with me
As in next week?
Looks like the bikki picture is going down well. Good find
I think I'll start at 20:00 UK time, but I'm gonna sleep now, so if you make an announcement feel free to say that time for the EU stream
I agree, my only concern is the video with caption translations getting taken down, but apart from that Thursday sounds good
I will be doing kareoke, but I can have the stream open
yeah
or something more reasonable
then maybe a 7:00 start for me would be better
but if we want to run two streams that'd make it easier
latest I can do is a 11:00 start
yep, thurs next week is good
since no one has objections that ive seen, thurs next week should be good
when are we gonna announce the watch? It should probably be some time today, to keep it in spirit of bikki-day
they were the people that got me into science and stuff like that
yeah, its  a fuckin pain to have to see that kinda stuff
funny thing is in VC pop seemed worse than bread in that regard, bread was very reserved
Beep boop
I will rate it Elf9/9
*oh damn I see what you mean*
<:GenjuurouThumbsUp:336657189475188740>
God...
<:concerned:288512422912720896>
<:BlueMadokaFighto:454043813720358926>
Who even knows...
Uh
That's...
Also, *pats*
Yeah, I think it was trap (although wasn't 100% clear) and good to know on the censoring thing. Thought I'd better stay safe than sorry
Just gonna add it was never used in the first place
The discussion I had with bread was... questionable. He didn't agree with some points but he agreed not to use the t-word after some convincing
.dess_remind me 1h DO the thing
its been up for 28 already
it only needs to survive 1 more day
ok, appreciate it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PVtmEPnR1s
also uploaded it to youtube but kept it unlisted for ease of playing
I already have extracted a version incase the worst, but the subs dont come with it
cc
<:Praise:391038800232448000>
ok just checked, the subbed version of police story on youtube is still up
Is this the event valk are having?
<:IrisTHIS:457676622749892620>
aight sounds good
oh yea will do
probs a better idea
oh yea sounds good
pls to input?
whats this?
oh thats cool
*i meant window closed
will the stream still run if i have the window closed?
works
mhm
incase we need it

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PVtmEPnR1s
wait I made it loop if thats what you mean
uh no
i did it
on the video
I think
right clicl loop
yea I can see you doing stuff
ok nice
yea
can you pause play and shit?
I clicked give leader
https://cytu.be/r/Scrmz_Internally
uh
sure then
oh really?
i'll give you my account detalils in a sec
yea we can do
*what a shame*
you'll get a dm in 11 days then
niceu
then a message
like 4d
then a time
without the dot
iirc I got one going for 30 days a while back
I think so
uh
I second this
looking at it I think its a fair decision. Who were these people that encountered hazel in the past?
if you want to host a larger one I wouldnt mind helping getting it organised and all that
sure why not
they all seemed to have a good time
got like, 6 people in
watch was a success
oh, fair point
does it happen every time?
one everyone ping, one leave
dess_remind me 160m Police Storyu
we also have a comparitively higher mod to user ratio than most other places
it does feel like that time sometimes, but i'd rather have us taking an active role rather than a passive one
ah...
hang on, what is it?
cant say ive ever seen anything like that
I saw this on your twitter, best of luck
hopefully they'll take this to heart, they dont seem like the kind of person to do that maliciously
ah I didnt see him saying that
I feel like wfc is drunk rn
<:Praise:391038800232448000>
<:PraiseTheGay:411773591860936715>
yeah, I saw that too. Whats up with that?
so unless we want literally 60x slower internet we have to put up with the shit
there are 3 packages that reach our location, a virgin one that caps at 120 download speed, and two BT ones that can only get up to 5 and 3 respectively
literally the worst thing is that we almost have no choice
starts to drop again
and then a couple of months later bam
we ask for them to fix it, it gets better for a little while
every couple of months it slowly starts dropping connection to the point where i'm getting 10 minutes of downtime for 1 minute of uptime
im getting really pissed off at virgin media... Every so often the internet starts to shit itself
dess_remind me 14h ask kro for reddit bot info
I'll do so in the morning
I can ask Krotash, the head mod of the konosuba server how he got their one working if you need
*does that mean a robot version of them both were key in bringing them back together?*
best of luck you two, hope it all goes well
In fact he repeated these exact points he's making in the vc earlier... it's more sharing a viewpoint than looking for discussion at this point
I was in vc with him earlier and he said he was quite drunk too
I've liked the whole process of flying, just not the actual flight itself... flying will always be kinda special to me though since that was where I first watched anime. 6 hour flight from the states I downloaded all of s1 of konosuba to watch. By the time I landed in London I had become a weeb
<:GenjuurouThumbsUp:336657189475188740>
You truly are a bot overlord, dess
I joined before the majority of this was talked about so im fairly in the dark when it comes down to how its gonna work
opt in @kiri role
This count as text?
ugh god I feel so narcissistic sometimes... It feels like no matter what gets talked about I subconsciously end up trying to talk about myself and I feel really bad about it <:meguDed:238539575264280578>
<:Dab2:271137400837767168>
<:Dab:271137562494500864>
So are these things the art for the cards?
also capes are good
otherwise I'll have wales syndrome where I just disconnect from the world for a few days
aight sweet, hopefully the place i'll be heading to has decent internet
when will release day/time be?
Club attendance? Playing games like jackbox/mafia
is it spoilery? if not mind sharing <:MikuPeeku:391813945293406208>
also I wanna watch flip flappers soon, its either next or second next on my list to watch. It'd be cool to get a whole server watch/collab watch with the 3hz crowd if possible
looks good
heh
this is starting to get me really excited, its gonna be awesome
personally I have a very low tolerance for stuff like that but I understand that its culture in some places so I have a degree of leway
done and done
should we take it down then?
just checked heiro and the vid just posted in heiro uses the n-word fairly early on, is that an issue?
ah cool
will people like elfnein and genjuurou get cards too, or just gears?
5 sounds like a decent idea
ok this is going to be the last time i'll be online for a few days. No idea what the internet in wales will be like, so just assume I won't be on. Hope this all goes well!
Kayaking done, I'm all safe and in one piece. I'll be able to catch up in around 5 hours when I'm back
rv_pull aint working
pull
how do I...
fill me in, how is the gacha going, and is there anything else going on?
alright, Scrmz reporting for duty
*slumps away in mild dissapointment*
oh, thats a relief
hang on... Im just robo-Kriisa
*wait then what am I*
are we gonna pin the gacha patches <@!102691114762371072>
have a nice trip <:GarieWink:336657101273169921>
ohhhh...
ooh...
ooh, where are you headed?
oh yea, what new features are in the works?
I dropped my pulls in the commands thing
ok im knackered so im gonna sleep, ping me with a summary if anything I should know happens/gets done
I like your idea, it seems a good way of doing it
oh sweet
I cant say I have any experience composing those kind of messages so i'll either let one of you do it, or need some help from others
I think that'd be an awesome way to do it
honestly its flexible
my bad
2100
if that works for everyone here I'll propose it to Kro and we can sort something out
I have the next 4 sundays free, so how about watching 3 ep's every sunday (and 4 on the last day), starting at say, 9:00 UK time
mhm
it'll have to be at the weekend, but if we could organise something with the 3hz crowd that'd be awesome
ganbare ^^
I can host a fli fla watch, iirc this saturday is the 2 year anaversary of it (although I am gonna be away all weekend looking at uni's). I can also host some sorta games night/get anime club back up and running if my schedule allows it
it feels like you're all doing your own thing to help with RV, is there anything I can get in on too?
cracked me up
im sorry but just reading through bot channel, I love how kirichan is in poverty for all of us
I guess clicking the bonus 500 coins assigned you a file right away
ah fair enough
what actually was it?
if I come back and you still aren't up for itjust say so
but yeah, I dont want to push you on it
thats... an interesting metaphor (simile or whatever its called)
will do, and stay safe
`It's your replacement`
Oh
Ob
It's your choice, if they're nice it could be all cool and stuff, but if not you don't wanna get doxxed
As long as they don't see yours no issue
Ok so you can either show an interest and become pals irl and on discord, or just pretend you saw nothing and move on
Uhhhhhhhh
Wassup
in hearthstone
for example the tavern keeper goes mad when you get a legendary
maybe a feature to make new peoples more aware if alert them if they made a good pull?
ok thats cool to know
*you... predicted...*
is that x drive then?
rv_mycard Lesbian Death Ray
rv_mycard Lesbian Death Ra
oh right
*how do I tell if they're x drive?*
ah right
*damn, if I knew the rarities earlier that'd make it feel better*
wait so I got pretty lucky pulling miku and kanade then
cool cool
<@!127644949884698624> are you in the mood to talk about the flifla watch right now?
you have every right to be scared mate, and i'm always happy to listen to your troubles
~~and it would be in the uk~~
the earliest I can see this working is when I reach second year in uni when I get my own place with a couple of friends (that'll be in like 2 years) <:meguDed:238539575264280578>
how long till you graduate?
cant tell if a good thing or a bad
Ok
Aight so have we decided on an amount to give Rakhi for her daily fanart posts?
didnt realise that was a thing
ah
whats planting?
I gathered as much
although I dont know how one would go around making midi's
damn right
havent tried tbh
I might be able to
I could try
*possibly*
yeah, I can play most music byear given time
basically i was planning on playing Stand up! Lady! on my acoustic guitar, since I learnt it all by ear a month or so ago, and maybe sing maria's part over it+the instrumental, or over it+the instrumental and lyrics
once I get some more opinions I might put an announcement out seeing who would be interested
so im planning to see if I can play something symphogear-music related, and the idea popped in to my head that if prompted to, others might like to do so too. If people showed interest, what would your thoughts be on a mini-event style thing where people submit something they've done/played/sung/made to do with symphogear music?
^ that would tip you for 10 kiricoins
discuss
reacting with <:Kiricoin:495336831978569759> tips 10 kiri coins for ease of tippage
interesting idea popped into my head
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCkgYhtz64U
*Thats the power of love*
A well deserverd title im sure <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
`Will it be grand?`
fields of wheat
`Rainbow backgrounds`
i'll let her know it'll be payment for the next 5 days
<:BikkiDetermination:441154738185043968>
so <@!127644949884698624> there are *many* layers to stand up! Lady!, do you want me to try to get as many as possible down?
this is taking a *long*  time
god, im so glad modern music loops...
<:papikaSpooky:284174444803522560>
its a beautiful thing
I guess i'll do one of those announcement thingys to get an idea on numbers
bringing back up what I said earlier:
`so im planning to see if I can play something symphogear-music related, and the idea popped in to my head that if prompted to, others might like to do so too. If people showed interest, what would your thoughts be on a mini-event style thing where people submit something they've done/played/sung/made to do with symphogear music?`
Any more opinions?
*ok this is gonna take a while, hopefully the hardest bit is done now*
*should be g major*
*fuck now I need a key signature*
sure, why not
soprano, tenor or alto?
i'll go for that
for voice i'll just use a kazoo
maybe a bass
that seems to be all
the two guitars and a drum kit...
ok, sounds like a keyboard is in there somewhere...
but it'll just take time
now see, playing something and knowing what it is are two different things for me...
ah, lets go for that then
unless I can convince my music dept. to allow me on and make stuff on college pc's
i've used sibelius in the past but I think thats paid
could work
uhh, do you know any good sheet music programmes?
I already have the chords for that
heh, I can do that
ok gimme a song and i'll get to work after this dota game
mhm
im not too sure how that'd work
most of the stuff is electronic tbh
I can't exactly punish them for disagreeing with me
What about from the perspective of a server moderator...
how do you even respond to "people cant take jokes anymore"?
but it does make other places a bit of a shock
its refreshing, i'll give you that
im just so glad this place is how it is
This guy making bad pedophilia jokes and jokes about the identifying as an attack helicopter, along with mocking other things I care loads about... 
I try to explain whats wrong with it but all that they ever say is "oh, people cant take jokes nowdays"
I want to scream
some people
just...
oh god I need a break...
yea
like, in general conversation
officially title it serenacon but we can mention it as sernacon
<:ChrisEating:384879395829186560>
sernacorn
serennacon
11 days to serna birthday
drums are incomplete and I havent made a start at getting things on the right instruments, but the skeleton of the song is there

I will do more on it though
*wait no fuck it i'll give it to you anyway and you can decide*
if its gonna take time to convert it i'll save you the trouble and give you the final version im happy with
ok
Oh yea alice, if I gave you the midi now would you be able to use it in maplestory right away, or can't you access it? It's very nearly in a barely acceptable state right now, just without a lot of the background stuff so I can send it if you want
I honestly cant tell if it's malicious at this point or literally *not understanding at all*
how far through would you say you are
nice
Have drunk
I
Yeah I'm willing to work towards instruments like that
Fuck that
Soprano sax?
Wdu think I should go for for makyuu ichieval
Or is it just a placeholder instrument
What about vocals?
<:meguDed:238539575264280578>
What are the basic ones?
Ah damn...
Also can you do harmonics?
How limited are the effects in maple story? There is a ***lot*** of distortion on the guitars in makyuu
Yeah...
Ooh, the rhythm on this one is gonna be fun...
Yeah, that should be doable
*what other song
Also, what would you like me to do next when I get the time?
Ah it's all good, take all the time you need
Let me know when you get your end sorted, I'm interested to see the finished product
Yeah I'm cool with that
Cool cool
aight, dropped it in <#357682999300718592> for a bit extra publicity, maybe get others doing it too
I feel like it should be more than 400 kiricoins seeing as I spent around 14 hours on it, but if that's the set amount so be it
Ok I just finished the score. When I get some stable internet I'll send you the musescore file
It was just a bit of a shock to me because this person is usually quite laid back
Yeah these would have been good
Will too much terrain being impassable be an issue?
Ok I just gotta say this is starting to sound awesome
Glance value is useful so a system like that would be cool
`Punchy`
You could say it was
And it did good taste indeed
I did indeed
I'm just in a good mood
I'm not that drunk tbh
Yepp
2 glasses of whiskey, one scotch one jp, and about two or three cans of beer
If yes, then use cards
Can we then reupload without  cards?
If we do get caught that is
What is the worst they can do if they ask us to stop?
Hmm, that's tough
How much will user experience fall if we can't display cards in browser?
I usually like to err on the side of caution
and links are cool
but its a link
anticlimactic to say the least
that link was...
ok
Good job tho <:GenjurouThumbsUp:267393750349643776>
But it is a very nice link
I'm on mobile
Should characters have special abilities? Stuff like bikki stopping fighting or tsubasa creating swords to block a fight or something
*flashbacks to mortred critting me 4 times in a row* yeah that's fine by me
Ok good to know
You shouldn't be able to counter if you are hit big or disabled if that's a thing
Or any kind of disable
Are crits a thing
*it's just an endless loop of misses*
If this were the case could a counter attack trigger another counter attack by missing
If you miss mayhaps that procs a chance for a counterattack
Ok
Is dodging a mechanic?
*you're not alone R, you aren't alone in worry*
<:HeadPat:388949660892397588>
If we do so without images the layout will have to be very easy to navigate and look at
Never have I been less serious in naming something
*the names...*
Then they will go to the ends of the earth
I don't know them, but if someone holds a grudge
Yes
So say we did, and we were asked to take it down, we did and changed it to have no assets whatsoever then reuploaded it, will that be an issue?
Pls
YES THIS
*if you're gonna follow me at least say hi* /s
Melua aaaaaaaaaaa
My dad is drinking that now...
Uhhhhh
A
Gotch
Is that absolute x + absolute y or something else
I feel like I've done all this just under a different name
Nep nep
Nep well my friend
Nav Nais Nap
I should get round to that
It's a tonne more effort than quite a lot of other stuff people are doing but you don't want to break the economy or get too much of an advantage that it isn't fun to play
If you do it should be something reasonable
Well
I think you shpuld
Yes
I mean I loved doing it and it was kinda cool to see what I could do, but the extra motivation is there
Personally I don't really want to admit it but without kiricoins I don't think I would have had that last push of motivation to make the score for Stand up Lady
I think kiricoins definately does
<@127644949884698624> not game related but are you in a flip flapper mood? Back in a sec too.
but I agree it will look suspicious
I change lots randomly so no one will mind/care if I do
tha's cool
oh sweet
CO license?
rakhi's 111 was the one she got 25 for, we need 1 or 2 more
(On her birthday of course...)
When are we activating it, midnight US time?
Oh hey I see we got sernacon all set up
*god that would have fucking sucked*
did this start after the *long trip* ‚Ñ¢?
still gotta be a pain
ahh
car fix?
heh, madoka mod team getting shuffled again it seems
*IM CALLING THE POLICE*
*IS THAT A WEED?*
for the job at starbucks(?) I think it was
any update on the background check?
best of luck
<:NononHeh:357474352670703618>
<:TsubasaYareYare:407397617451139073>
<:meguContent:340637220853514250>
nice and comf food
Slow cooked food is awesome
what ya cooking?
beautiful
<:meguDed:238539575264280578>
luckily this one isnt as complicated rhythm wise so it shouldnt be *thaaaat* hard to get back to the stage I started
*cries in sadness*
and have lost about 2 hours of work
I somehow managed to save the wrong version of the score
i knew this would happen...
FUCK
do you think a piano would be able to get that part?
one of the things was the part at 2:56 on this link
https://soundcloud.com/ra-146/senki-zesshou-symphogear-makyuu-ichii-bal-takagaki-ayahi
but there are some I just cant tel what they are past "Generic electronic sounding sound"
theres quite a few types of guitar
im having a go at making makyuu ichavial, but im a bit stuck on what to do for the different instruments
one of the few people on that server I legitimately respect
he's a good guy as far as i've seen
looks like I got mr head mod convinced
anyways, i'll keep you updated with my progress on the whole trap thing
make that 60%, i'd be there if I could too
score
fuckinnnn
nice!!!!!!
mhm
what things should I mention
i am currently in the process of trying to convince the other mods of /r/Konosuba discord to put a restriction on the use of the word trap, with the intention of having it pretty much outlawed
so
*coughs in shirabe*
same with most markov chain type things
I really like subreddit sim. Every so often you get a post that is just too perfect
Wanted to check before I said anything but looks like Kriisa got there before me
Thought so
Came to the solution it was fine as it was, or was that something else
We discussed this a while back no?
Aaaaaaaa I wanna play monhun <:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
So might as well see the bass part for the midi to fill in the blanks
The reason I was asking is I can't find any good tabs for the whole of bloody stream bass
Appreciate it
Ah cool
<@127644949884698624> do you still have the midi for bloody stream? I think ima need it for something
has a bot that emote scans the konosuba server
I can ask a friend of mine
seems like that'd go against their whole concept of 'justice'
Probably not
what, like 100 kiricoins is 1 shirabuck
heh, fiats
hosting maybe, but watching is just something you do for fun, takes basically no effort
im not sure if people should get coins for watching
50-100 coins sound good?
6 people
got a good turnout for the gup watch
motivation was the #1 reason it stopped
tbh I dont think rakhi would mind if we didnt give anything, but it could work as a motivator to do it more in the future
it does create some discussion on the show we watch so its a nice bit of activity from the community I guess
effort wise its fairly low, you just need to find a time that works, open rabbit and host a room
server event... probably? It depends what you class as event
mhm
Should Rakhi get kiricoins for hosting a gup watch?
It really does... it really does <:meguContent:340637220853514250>
Really appreciate it
I just gotta go out and say thanks for everything. It's been a while since I've felt more comfortable and happy with my life and myself, and I feel like you're all a huge part of that
mhm, thats why I brought it up
it seems they aren't trying that though, which is probably a good thing
They seemed very keen on writing prompts
Also it seems the vast majority of valk users have no idea there was bad blood between the discorss
Just an fyi on this new person, they're in valk but thought some of the stuff we were doing here was really cool
Lovely to hear <:Hug:450538862641545226>
I hope you're feeling a tad better than last night Melua <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
Huh, what went on last  night?
Have you done the train dungeons? Those ones gave me a bit of greif trying to solo
Good, good
throguh the story, that is
how far are you?
oh yea <@!102691114762371072> did you restart the bot last night?
<:seiunhigh:460678870757277697>
*I goddamn wish it worked like that*
guess i'll sort it now then
ahh
I cant ping people in the channel they arent in
donut think so
nah it didnt work for whatever reason

rakhi just asked me if we ever gave her coins for hosting animeclub. I remember I tried to but couldnt for whatever reason, but did anyone else do it?
<:AkkoHug:428703851214929942>
Hope it's nothing too serious
Or get better
Get good
I'm thinking it needs to be something pretty gay
Any ideas?
Next up is Miku
dess_.. timeline
<:Kiricoin:495336831978569759>
Token get
Bear in mind we may need space in the guild if we level alts
Let them all join unless you know of a reason not to?
So what is our policy on accepting members?
I wonder, did they join because guild, or because symphogear?
nah, they aren't
Wait there's a chance they're a friend of mine from the kono server, I'll check if they're on my friends list
No clue
Yes
Oh my god
<a:wiggle:410635968262045696>
I'm gonna make it flip horizontally
Instead of shifting it left or right
You see how mine is animated
Nah, the plan was...
dess_remind me 13h sort yer avatar out
Idk if you want to edit it or make it an announcement but it seems important
tl;dr, the chances of you getting an unbiased trial if you wanted to sue discord for misusing your data is low if you don't opt out of this
Probably important for you US folks, copypasted from another discord

Alright the following announcement only applies to US people so shut up with the sass if you're not from there
Discord has changed their Terms of Service!

Unfortunately, this change comes with a revocation of your legal rights. Discord has revoked your right to sue (you must go through an arbitrator) and to congregate as a class action lawsuit.

Luckily, there is an opt-out for the clause, in which you must email arbitration-opt-out@discord.com, but you must do it within 30 days or you can no longer opt-out.

YOU CANNOT DELETE OR DEACTIVATE YOUR ACCOUNT TO OPT-OUT OF THE ARBITRATION CLAUSE

You can see the added clauses for yourself here: https://gist.github.com/Rapptz/c93697c9d59ec2f0d8071b7d0e907632

Is this enforceable?

In the United States, yes. This was decided by the Supreme Court in 2011. See https://gc.gy/7538114

In Europe, no. There are many clauses, a relevant one is Article 77 of the GDPR ("Right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority").

Why does this matter?

Without the ability to congregate for a class action lawsuit, if Discord ever leaks your data or does something catastrophically bad to a large portion of the population you have no way to representatively sue together without each of you individually suing via the arbitrator. 

Essentially: 

1. Your right to file a complaint in the court of law is removed. 
2. The arbitration system tends to heavily favour the company rather than the consumer.
3. Since your right to pool similar complaints together is taken away, the amount of damage you can do to a company that has wronged you significantly is limited to those who are willing to arbitrate.
that sounds like a really cool thing
ah
remind me, what is symphocast?
`tiny hat expert`
tiny hat owner?
*Tiny hat maid*
ah, I didnt get the full story then
I wonder if  this is what they were on about
so I recall jacq left valk for some reason or another, mainly due to people 'getting tired of them'
Oh and on the topic of anime club I don't think wobbles should get any coins. Only me and bread turned up, and I left half way through because I'd rather play maple than watch the OVAs
Alternatively you can farm dungeons and get lucky
An epic weapon is like 20mill or around that range
Oh cool
`I'd pet your pumpkin but I already did 3 today`
Is the new person from maplestory?
dess_remind me 2h avatar, but hopefully your at home this time
**Aomegafriend**
Become
You're right
Oh
I'd imagine
A for alice
Become **Omegafriend**
Heh
That's rather nice
Ah right
Or is that literally only in queenstown
Do level two veins still give the extra drops?
Oh right
Huh? Where's this place?
Ah I'm 100% on board with accepting people. I've just been a commander in a world of tanks clan before and wanted to know if we had any conditions in mind for joining?
On another topic about Lectric, they've been tryna butt into the convo in general with videos completely irrelevant and against the flow, and it was getting kinda annoying after the 4th time
rest well
ah ok
but yeah, can someone with word open the .doc and send a screenshot
***IT IS***
yes
NONONONONONO
*oh no*
so cannot open .doc files
I just realised I may not have word installed on my pc
or did I understand wrong
so just to summarise what was said just now, we'll tell them to lay off/calm down or whatever, and if it doesn't help we escalate
i'll give it a skim
ah ok
just for sakes of consistency this got mentioned `but also we have a protocol for this to handle it (thanks past me)`, can you elaborate on this for me
especially in stuff like this
I will always have your back
I cant read anything they say without a bit of disdain at that point to be completely honest
every month or so I get someone asking something **WE HAVE AN AUTOMATED FUNCTION FOR** like adding a role or something, and sometimes im busy or im out and I get *"but moderators are meant to be helpful and do things for people"* bitch miss me with this that aint my job I aint customer service
I wish others thought I wasnt immortal too sometimes...
oh yeah no I agree completely
seems likely thinking about it now though
<:TsubasaYareYare:407397617451139073>
thats what I got

hmm, who is kuon?
Say if this happened on the kono server, what would I need to do to stop it? Just delete the invite link, or anything else?
Nuking valk
Of time travel
Ultimate goal
~~shoulda just madokaed it~~ /s
Damn
And it kinda just spreads from word of mouth or something...
So is the reason valk is larger due to it being older?
hbd alice, hope you have a nice day
did anything useful ever happen there?
the server is just a fucking joke
Ah cheers
Surely it's not that much
What's the total number of users on the server?
its the contrast which does it sometimes
ah, im sure there are quite a few things similar
what is the local/regional government there like?
oh damn, thats nice
*something about smol guilds is nice too though*
Which is nice
Looks like people are starting to play maple without incentive of kiricoins
i actually enjoyed a few parts, but I dont tend do dislike very much. The whole premise was dumb looking back now and I wouldn'tve enjoyed it half as much as I did then
before that was... Konosuba, girls und panzer, and thats pretty much it
I feel bad that DITF was the first seasonal anime i ever watched
Wtf no I'm 9
I realise, it's just I trust you all a load
<:MikuGay:336656810788388864>
You right
Oh shit
<:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
Yell at me any time you want if it helps
Fuuck
Aight I trust y'all to deal with this, gonna get some rest now
Did you make a warn for it?
Appreciate the share, wtf
That just seems the fastest way to defuse an arguement they didn't want to take
Wait a typo?
Woah fuck
Sorry for leading you on a tad I guess, I'm just not too comfortable mentioning it
A am 17 though
I've always kept quiet about it when your brought it up but since this is serious (potentially) I brought it up
Wait what
Do you need me to do anything? I'd rather not go down there when I'm not allowed by the discord thing
Ah fair enough
Kriisa did you have any thoughts about continuing the tabletop thing that was going on a couple of months ago?
Except we make the people buy the instrument before they play
Couldn't be more accurate
This...
My only issue with that is not everybody realises what that phrase is so it may not seem as familiar/friendly to what they may be needing if they want to bring something up there
VC is fine I guess
Ah appreciate it
It's all good as long as you don't joke about it in public
*fuck I'm not gonna hear the end of this am I...*
was good fun
something like mafia is cool
***TURF WAR!***
ooh, lets hear it
Sorry for the long wait, sleep is good ya know? Personally reading through R's reasoning made me chuckle, I'm all for the idea, but I don't think I have such faith in out users to be honest. They're nice people, but that makes me inclined to say they might not leave the editong or even consider it, just to see the project to a conclusion. 
We should also keep in mind that yes, it might spread our servers culture elsewhere, it's possible they might bring some of the 4chan shit back with them, and I would feel bad and feel responsible if we had to sanction them because of something we ultimately told them about.
So, I'm good with posting it, we might just need to make it clear (maybe in a lowkey way as not to seem hostile to yttt) that leaving and ditching the group is always an option, and making sure that everything's alright  with the people interested in helping out and that they're not having a bad time because of the people there
There's much less of this to put up with in the UK and I'm so glad of that
I swear I have a hard time not getting angry sometimes
Also that channel looks *very* wing at a glance
I swear yt is pushing it so hard
Huh, that cicada thing is in your recommended too?
like, if I could say woo its halloween when it turned midnight
oh I was thinking of something completely different
<:GenjuurouThumbsUp:336657189475188740>
probably for the best
yeah we said start 29th/30th
doesnt look like its gonna happen at such short notice
oh and also <@!127644949884698624> We completely forgot to tell people that we were going to start flifla today at some point
cah?
You have this amazing way with words, damn...
I'm personally willing to put money on that in 20 years times things are gonna be considerably better
üêê
Please for your own sake it's not worth it
Too true, although going to an 'All boys' college sure helps with that
<:CarolShock:430939013235474432>
I'm glad to hear, I don't know how many of us would cope
I believe it may be longer due to the accelerating advances in medicinal technology
I like it
<:meguOoh:358116975752249344>
<:SerenaOhoho:449358389563359234>
what, make it look like you're doing stuff?
(also should we un-spook their names?)
so with the <@!449062815534153748> how does the image search function work?
I can't tell if it's a joke or not, that's the worst part
I swear, that job is gonna be so great for you
I think the most recent one was a repost too
as a user its ok to express distaste, be it in person or behind their backs, but as a moderator you are right, theres nothing we can do about it in the order of fairness and a healthy community
for me, that is
how much hassle would it be to set it up?
It ain't that bad surely
*I was gonna fuckin say*
rakhi asking me in dm's with something about being able to edit the channel topic in <#371105434771390465> . Has this already been discussed?
automated sieve to get loads of matereals
turn cobble into sand, dust and the like
no, it had some sorta infinite cobble generator
then we made a nuclear reactor but my friend got bored and blew everything up
it was good fun
we got to the point of having an infinite supply of matereals, given time
I remember doing a good one of those wit friends
I played one recently with that
which one was that again... did it have loads of sieving?
i'd like to play something we can all run at a reasonable level, so should we start with somethign we can all run first?
Idk, we're close friends and even more in some cases, I guess we're bound to get on a bit better than other groups...
ONohohohoohohoboobobob9
OH NO
At yeast theyre not too bad
Sorry, I knead to work on my bread puns
Like, does saying "are you bready to start?" Speed things up a bit
I wonder if there is a way to speed up bread production
Wow
The whole Konosuba KonoDioDa thing is a pretty big meme in the konosuba sub

*oh but of course*
oh, birthday too
I think
germans celebrate krampsmas on the 5th and 6th of december
ah, thats mroe of a german thing
well, quite a few actually
oh god I found a really shitty anti-liberal meme
huh, <#449274763815157760> is working
I like to think shirabe just got really confused by the sudden changes and refuses to cooperate until they are reverted
I have no words
TiL you have to be 13 or up to use discord, and it's mods responsibility to ban people who are known to be under this age
Oh nvm
`We were just talking about you, lava` maplestory person, or actually talking about a completely coincidental lava
We're all fairly left wing so I don't think it will make too much conflict in chat, what do you have in mind? Just a reminder to go vote, or anything more than that?
*sleepy time*
<:FlipFlapping:284172012501336064>
Sure thing
*I thought that was a secret*
<:CarolShock:430939013235474432>
I would be lying if I said this was getting stale
I feel like for things like december it'd be good to have
does the theme nessecarily need to tie in with the time of year?
ah you could be right
yes
Chrismas on the symphogear server
we can have
archers is kinda annoying since it uses 4 stamina so you cant use it twice
but slow if you collide with an object
knight felt really fast
Oh yea just so you know I haven't given up on transcribing makyuu, it's just taking more time than I anticipated. The solos are *real fuckin hard to get done properly*
Toppings
Good for pizza
Souls are good
is this just US scouts, or scouts globally?
~~you can pin me if you want R~~
so thats probably why
I removed the first pin
oh
*I had to*

its aura of power is immense
<a:KirikaMegadess:502935599238479872> <a:KirikaMegadess:502935599238479872> <a:KirikaMegadess:502935599238479872> <a:KirikaMegadess:502935599238479872>
thats a hell of an emote
whatever happens i'll be here if you need me
*I'll try*
i'l get round to doing more of it later, i got a lecture to go to now

Ok, trumpet sounds loads better
I do Actually think the guitar at the start could be done better, it will just take a shit ton of time
Mm fair
If you want I can also try to make the guitar and singing more harsh by adding rests inbetween some of the parts
Do you want me to go ahead and try editing a trumpet in the part and see how it sounds?
It might work with a clarinet instead of sax
Ah, that's a pain
Or can you trade em
Are they character bound?
Ah, that works then
I have a guitar, idk who has the other stuff
Sax, bass, drums and e. Guitar
Ah I won't be back home for a while, but we will need a bass to play it
alternatively, the second guitar part (second line down) can be added to the bass part, which might be a better idea seeing as that one has a slightly different tone
depending on if we can fit all of the guitar parts onto 1 instrument it will only need 4
it took its goddamn time, but its finally finished
<@!127644949884698624>
you were... offered that?
<:CarolShock:430939013235474432>
I miss these memes
there we go

why cant I link the file
wait what
alright, this is the (slightly) harshened version, with cymbals and other stuff. Not sure there's much more I can do, but I gotta go for lessons now
*looks like im rewriting the whole drum part, since it wont let me use stuff i've already done*
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa musescore why
<:Praise:391038800232448000>
thats... just how it is
oh, and there is no way of getting the right guitar sound in musescore either
so just add the cymbals in like normal then?
actually I did to it a while back for the electric guitar, and it was a slight improvement
no, im not sure how to access those specific soundfonts
the timpani may need to be higher, but thats an easy fix
here's what I've done so far. I cant see much else that needs doing, and hopefully changing over to maple will fix the soundfont issues and the fact that the piano in musescore *is so goddamn quiet*
I'll give that a go
So what, just a really high pitched timpani note?
In fact I'll just add it in on top
I will keep that in mind in future
(And I'm not gonna go back and change them all at this point)
Also not having cymbals is real annoying since half the drums are cymbals
Alright so I'm doing some more work on the makyuu score, I've managed to make the intro sound a *bit* better, but there's not much I can do with the soundfonts available, I can't overdrive the guitars like you would normally do with an amp, but I added some extra piano to make it sound more electronic. There isn't an electric one on musescore so hopefully the keyboard in maple will give the desired sound
As for Chris' vocals being more harsh, the only thing I can think of is adding two people, one on sax, one on trumpet playing exactly the same notes to give a stronger, louder effect
I don't really have much of an opinion either way
Would you classify it as spam, like 1 image every 3 hours or So?
I wanna give them the benefit of the doubt since they putting lots of work into it and its sorta (maybe) a bit interesting at times, but I think we told them to put it in another channel
should all of marooned's work be in some other place like <#407060923078017026> ?
but no, I must resist
a strong urge...
this gives me...
And I'm glad I could be there
Ah„ÄÅ it's alright„ÄÅ the time I did spend with you was really nice
I just wanna thank you all for this evening... so goddamn much. I got told about 6 hours ago my grandma passed and I was really debating coming on at all, but im glad I did since I had a really great evening. You're probably the only group of people I would actually want to be with this evening, so thank you for that
I dont really want it to get overused, it must pertain its power
understandable
you'd just have to cope with me bein a shit
if i can play with all of oyu
I wouldnt mind using an alt
no i mean, for me
that dont have to pay?
can you make alts/
and I dont feel happy transfering and leaving my close friends either
I wouldnt feel happy getting you to all transfer
levels 1-35 on all jobs are free right now, so you can try to see if you like it first
some of the story is a drag I will admit (im looking at you post 2.0) but a lot of 3.0 and 4.0 stuff is awesome. Im not tryna convince you, but personally I had a good time
personally I have a good time playing it
*did you mean* **rdm**
no its completely understandable, I dont really blame you
mm fair enough
personally it wouldnt sit right doing something with everyone that you couldnt join
I like how they do it
no, I think that is a good thing
I do end up mindlessly jumping around tria every so often
*I also have university to worry about too*
couple of hours on dungeons and gear, the rest on the other?
thats a fair point, Maple does take less time than others, like running wow and ffxiv woudltn work, but maybe with maple...
so if you all wait resubbing later wouldnt be an issue for me
I think the 4 days thing lasts until 23rd of december
im just taking the 4 days now because I have friends who have wanted to go back and i've stated im potentialyl interested too
the issue is im having good fun with maple and I know how hard running two mmo's is
on midgardsomr, that is
all of my friends have already started their 4 day things
I guess I could make an alt... but i'd only do that if we were gonna put serious time into it, like i really dont wanna experience post 2.0 again
*come join me on midgardsomr*
*if only I liked symphogear 6 months ago*
oof
Yeah, ones like Samuel run invented running when he tried to walk twice, and Steven awake invented sleeping when he tried to sleep twice
The "invented when tried to do x twice" ones
I agree, it should be a case by case basis. I know it wouldn't happen with Lily, but if someone were to advertise, then said thing advertised was not held up or was distressing in some way I wouldn't be able to help but feel partially responsible
Oh <:GWnanamiHikariEhehe:407590372437524480>
Lilly's stuff is really nice
Oh cool. I'm all for that
Idk if it's a British thing but I can't really see any scenario where any form of public transport would wait for late people
I would've thought they'd just leave them
Damn...
Have a good flight :)
never gets angry at anything, really kind and understanding, and actually sounds glad to see everyone that turns up
one of the purest people i've ever known
*oh god my FC leader is such a nice person*
if I cared how my character looked more that would be nice
roulette being any dungeion you've unlocked, randomly chosen with bigger rewards
mhm
its like, 1 roulette, 1 level 50, 1 boss dungeion a day and thats it
I mean it could be that I go back to it and just cant click
right now... im gonna wait and see how this 4 day thing goes
thats honestly fair enough
also I would not mind giving a monetary contribution if that was the main issue
they may also have black friday or christmas sales, idk how enix does things
thats probably the only thing in the game I didnt enjoy
and the 12 hours of *literal bullshit fetch quests you have to do*
*and that involves doing post 2.0*
*but I gotta get to ishgard first*
you can meet the first character I ever called Scrmz Internally
so far I havent tried monk, smn or machinist
fuck that place
*which isnt much*
i'd have to play something I havent already tried
the full size one at least
mhm
something seems off about it
honestly same
oh also I dont think shirabe is sourcing stuff, not sure if you knew about that
i'll keep an eye out for anything unusual
<:horny:512439777841381376>
they arent showing signs of change, at least not the change needed
no honestly im at the point where I dont think i'll ever buy anything they ever make, its honestly just so fucked up
but yeah
I was about to say...
shit... I guess
ah... right
just a bit of  background, who is this, what were they designing and what is the character popular for?
im free all day, apart from the 20 minutes im eating with my family
*Thank you Mr zoid*
should I know zoid?
or at least thats the view i've seen from many right leaning people over here
'because they already know its right'
ah, but if someone agrees with any viewpoint, they wont bother to fact check it
Fuckin shit that...
Got 4 classes to 35, just to find out because I was extra cautious and made my account a US one I couldn't get the full game
Oh yeah I had a fuckin huge issue with that
:/
Actually... I don't know. Something doesn't sit right...
Ffxiv free time ran out, I think I'm gonna leave it. Do the whole maple thing since that's still cool, but still have the prospect of playing it more in future
You're very good at handling and wording things I find
When works for you
Hmm that's fair
Preferably before this sort of time or I'll be half asleep
Weekends work for people?
Yeah I'm too tired for sommat like that
As for the yorin thing normally I'd say no to that kind of treatment since being ignored is by far my biggest insecurity, but after some of the stuff today I couldn't give a flying fuck what you do
Fuuuck, that's one of the worst things
it was the fastest way to end that conversation
ah, its alright
is the ColorMeIlluminati role ok for me to use?
how did you find out, if you dont mind me asking
im glad they didnt kill him
That's a really good way of putting it
I thought you handled it really well
Tis the one thing I despise most about the konosuba sub, we seem to have the same conversation every week
Friday and weekends can be late ones, but other from that I wouldn't want to start much later than 12
Oh yea might as well say any evening from like 8 onwards UK time works for me
So for thanks giving don't worry about roping me in, but I'd still be interested to visit or w/e
Since thanksgiving is not a holiday in the UK I can't excuse myself to come visit y'all
But I'd also be alright if you all met without me
Planes do plane things
And if that were the case I could do most places in the US
Convince my parents to allow me to visit
No that came out wrong
Wait
I'd be 18 if we did it after July so I could probably convince my parents and a friend or two to tag along
Gimme a minute to collect my thoughts
Ah I'm not sure... since I resubbed to xiv I might not have time to play 3 games
Will it take a while to get into/up to your level?
Hmm that's fair
cant say i've payed very much attention to the game, but if you're all gonna be doing it for a while I might as well join you all
so are you gonna be playing diablo for a while now?
looking how dragon recommended it, and what the new member said makes me feel really happy tbh
im actually so glad that the people that are here feel the same way as us
shooketh
i'd suspect its some sort of publicity stunt, but truly, what the hell
But Jesus, can't you see past your own front door?
Like i get it's a huge issue
I'm trying not to scream
Oh god that fuckin sucks... which user was it?
*also was vc last night that bad, or is this unrelated*
Bridge sounds like a good idea. Would this be used in a similar way that the Lulu  bus is?
<:HowdyNooter:472690244354048000>
its one of the main reasons I dropped it, since I wasn't getting fulfilled playing alone
really enjoyed overwatch last night, if you play some more as a group gimme a ping and i'll see if I can join
Just letting you all know I'm not gonna be up for any discussion or mod stuff these next few days, the funeral hit me hard and I don't want to think about that sort of stuff
I always liked skeletor
gimme a ping or something whenever you got one that needs watchign
best I can suggest is ask them to not disrupt conversation flow with that sorta stuff
etiquette would say, if you have to post it at all, wait or do it in <#407060923078017026>
its frustrating tbh
anything else?
hmm, something along the lines of happy hannukah to those that celebrate it, and for everyone else I hope you have an awesome week
oh, cool
Personally I'm a fan of the icon we got in lulu
gonna put stuff in the dishwasher myself
aight fairs
I will
mee
tbh I had a hard time noticing till it was pointed out, likely not
im interested to know what everyone's opinions on <@212254733925089282> are
been a while since we've had an event and this might substitute well for one
I think it'd be a good idea
wanna go over there and give you the biggest hug ever
jfc.... im so goddamn happy for you
thats the best thing
holy fucking shit
Are the channels ordered correctly in >server? A day or so ago i accidentally dragged one out. Think I put it back in the right order but Illindus' comment makes me think i didnt
im so sorry mate. If there's anything else we can do to help just ask
Ah looks like i was beaten to the announcement
Oof

I'm not sure how often i'll be able to come on these next few days. Lotta stuff happening with college and friends and stuff and im feeling really short tempered, so im gonna take a break till I'm feeling a bit better
if there's anything you need a hand with feel free to gimme a shout
best of luck R
Huh, good to know leaving and rejoining the server doesnt reset the kiricoins
although not everyone can participate, so its not ideal on that front
200? 250?
I dont think i'd be the only one slightly worried about giving a full power mod role to someone who is still new
As for merging all mod roles into one, I support the idea. However if we do this, we will likely need a trial mod role, or as you said, a janitor role that we can give people in the case of needing another mod, or needing someone to watch over things temporarily
Since we're speaking of honesty, I really liked things as they were and would be pretty distraught if *any* of you had to leave. I'm tired of waking up and not being sure if everythings collapsed, because its something I just cant cope with. I sincerely hope we can find a way to make this work
My view is I dont want to get into the personal side of this, but im not sure where the line between server and personal is... I'm still giving it some thought
what server is that <:NotLikePapika:284132078054932480>
*oh god*
<@!285555416056856576>
So to clarify on this:
`I would like to find a way to de-escalate things`
I feel like this is affecting us all mentally in a really shit way. We're all delicate people and I dont want anyone to snap. Seriously. This has gotta be an effort from both sides if there's any hope of things staying together, and goddamn, I hope they do. I love this place, the people here, the whole system. I dont wanna see this happen. I fucking hate seeing this go down
i'll elaborate when im outta this game
I would like to find a way to de-escalate things
Theres likely a need for perhaps a "junior mod" role for giving to new people
Sounds good
Up to you, people are gonna catch on eventually
True I suppose
If you plan to do it at some point just do it now, i cant think of a scenario currently when youd need them
I... dont know, i dont feel as if it makea much of a difference
Agreed with melua
The owner thing doesnt mean much at all to me to be honest. The team has gotten smaller so having 1 custodian may be fine
I cant say I see you all that much but I trust in your and Alices judgement in this case. Its cool with me i guess
Sounds fair
Should we touch on heirachy next?
Silly tired fingers
*Sketch
As for candidates? I cant really say. Someone like Kerrick or Outside? Skeyb maybe?
*There probably isnt a better time than this*
Since were all here
Ah we can do stuff now
If its gonna be a 5 minute thing sure, if not im gonna try to get to sleep before it turns 5 in the morning
Depends how long
I can talk about stuff
But
Cant sleep
I should be able to drop out at most time, so gimme a ping if the others are here
I'm in a ffxiv raid and can look at this on my other monitor
I'm here but rather preoccupied
I'm glad this has happened when i'm not actively in college, i've been pretty much at my limit mentally these past couple of days and I'm pretty sure anything else would make me unable to think about anything properly
We may also need to look for other moderator candidates. We're a small server, so its not urgent and we do cover timezones rather well, however I will have a lot of shit happening in this next half year
And do we think adjusting the way the heirachy system works is a good idea
So I feel like various things might need to happen... Do you want to implement the 'staff should be respectful' rule now?
I dont think i was ever told
Which things *did* R make?
I dont think that she should *have* to do it. We can ask for the changes, sure, but I dont feel as if she should have an obligation to.
Kriisa brought up giving her credit for the bots: Seems fair to me.
Yeah no im too tired to think on it now. It probably goes under dont be a dick, but its a clarifications thing, being a dick can be objective at times (i guess so could this too, but oh well)
No worries
I'll... get back to you tomorrow i suppose. I need to sleep at some point. If you have rule proposals feel free to ping me with em. I dont have any ideas for drastic change so dont worry about ideas from me right now
QUICK
GO MAKE EM
Do any of you want a few minutes to celebrate new year?
I suppise thatd do the job
Oh right?
I'll be uninstalling discord from my phone due to exams so won't be on much, if at all during the day these coming months
I might as well bring up, I have mock exams starting in just over a month, so when im back to college im gonna be taking some serious time off/being less active. I havent decided whether I want to give up my moderator position temporarily to prevent distraction, but if I dont I doubt i'll have time/want to do anything here. I go back this coming monday.
never seen him interract with the community so I couldnt say
plus I think he prefers valk
I'm not sure how active he'd be or if he even has time to check
mhm
I'm all for it, dont know if she'll want to rejoin
im just a closed tab away
thanks, gimme a ping if anything important goes down
I gotta go do some work
I'll trust your discretion on this one
mhm
eh, nothing there that could be seen as being about me particularally bothers me
can hardly blame them with everything going on
I suppose there's a fair reasoning behind it
huh, so they didnt believe me that I wasn't `spying for information`
eh, sure
wait for what stuff?
`I can make an off-role so that kicking isn't needed, but it'd take a bit considering I'd have to alter permissions for every single channel` 
also I approve of this, muting is my favourite tool of moderation on the /r/Konosuba discord
although I am heavily considering leaving, this is getting a bit much
`(alright I gotta leave now, im just fucking tired of this whole thing)`
Went to play bass wit friends, nothing more
(alright I gotta leave now, im just fucking tired of this whole thing)
This is all hindsight, please dont take offense, and I‚Äôm sorry I couldnt‚Äôve been there to cool stuff

Not really ok with casual drug talk, but thats rather here nor there
Both R and Kriisa being passive agressive, looking to provoke, looks like alice took the bait.
They want a reason to leave, to spite alice, perhaps something like that, it looks like.
I dont feel comfortable with 2 non-mods who have been fairly negative about the server in such a casual and non-official way. If you wanna help, put it in suggestions.
I also think that going straight to mentioning warnings may not have been the best move in the given situation (kinda fueled the fire), rather mention that we‚Äôve talked about it and will likely do so some more in order to keep track of changing scenarios. This is likely just a different moderation style, not sure how my stance would‚Äôve worked there
There is no need for kriisa to call alice out in public, its just escalating things further.
IMO moderators should be able to act alone, but only when issues that can in no way wait for others to assist.
Hana and others escalating further with bystander effect, big reason why should be in DM‚Äôs or a private channel. Kriisa didnt seem like she wanted to stop in #general, so perhaps if Alice initiated the DM that may have worked.
I also think being kicked is a big step from a warn. If I were to get kicked, I would think that the moderation team dont want me here, simple as. A temporary mute may have had the same solution without seeming so ‚Äúleave-and-dont-come-back-ish‚Äù
Tl;DR: Lots of unnessecary escalation from all parties imo, Kicking was a tad excessive, and the public warn seemed to fuel things, so perhaps keeping that under wraps till the things cooled would be an idea
so read through it, wrote down my thoughts as things progressed
today i'll be around from now till 5:30 gmt, and then from 7:30 gmt onwards till like 11 when I decide to go off
yeah that looks fine
for now, sleep
but yeah, i'll come back to you tomorrow with an answer
...but this is just throwing ideas out there, none of what I said may happen and it may not have the outcome I predicted
true true, well I suppose if you go for a warning DM or something try to have lyssa do it? I still feel like the others have a connection with lyssa that perhaps could be used to prevent further escalation
so if you're not the one using said powers, perhaps it would pull less stick from other users
from what i've seen they're hellbent on trying to make it seem like you abuse moderator powers
Personally I dont feel the need to escalate to a ban, but who knows. If things dont improve then maybe thats the right move. I will say though, that if you were going to hand out that sorta punishment, from a PR standpoint it would make it better to have lyssa asses the situation and do it
this is all getting a bit much honestly... just being here is enough to set my mind racing about all the different stuff. I'll sleep on it, but if things dont clear up for me im likely gonna resign. If there's anything you want my opinion on before I make my decision tomorrow lemme know, i'll likely stay in the lounge if you'll permit me there, so I guess stuff can get asked there if its confidential, but I just feel like I should distance myself from things right now
feel free to remove the role at any time. Gonna sleep now
or DM's
the lounge is always there
if any pressing matters come down that you need my input on
and of course
thanks
to alice: I'm fairly awful at coming to people to play, so feel free to ask, I can always turn you down (god knows I do it a lot for dota friends)
But yeah, I'll keep you updated. As stressful as it can be sometimes, Its a great time being here with the community
perhaps I could come in as an advisor in the space in between, but ideally I'd prefer some time to get myself clear in the head
ah, so my mocks finish about... late Feburary, but my actual A-Levels will be finished around june
so, i'll post the message and be on my way I guess, anything else you want me to do/say?
I'd prefer this not to be brought up along side other events causing staff to leave, and while its played a part on making my mind do loops on itself, that wasnt the main issue for it all.
maybe dropping the last bit
I was going to put this in: 
As much as it pains me to say this, I‚Äôll be stepping down as Illuminati for an undefined amount of time due to upcoming A-Level exams. You‚Äôre a great bunch, so thanks for making my time as Illuminati a fun, and rather easy one.
yeah this whole thing is getting a bit much. I'm gonna step down for an undefined time while I sort out my life. I may come back, I may not, who knows. Give me a ping if im still online and I can say a goodbye to everyone, if not, you can either just take them, or wait till we're all online for it to happen. Its been great being in this team, thank you both for that
if I read things properly, she likes drama and was there for the drama
I did get dm;ed by hana asking if she could be
Will R and Hana get an unmute soon?

no kiri-chan figures tho <:PepeHands:422099282275991555>
yeah, they're all expensive
see if I like the stuff
yeah
K-on stuff might be good cos its hella cheap
just not really sure what to start with tho
a month that is
10 of which is paying back my phone to my parents, 5 for nitro, so I got 35 a month to mess with
currently getting around ¬£50 a month
dont have the sustainability to get into this whole figure thing yet
ahh ok
what country are you buying to?
huh ok
even the nendo's are like ¬£100
damn though, the sympho stuff is expensive
same could be said for alot of other figures tho tbh
really want one of those, just dont have the money
mhm
damn
where'd you get that? just amazon?
oh shit
cheers!
oke
hi
~~is this going too far?~~
youre the ~~best~~ *desst*
when you do, @ me since I might be sleeping and end up forgetting <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
its just I realised I gotta change my desktop background
oh nice
you got a source for the right one?
nice desktop background too
gotta say, that ones a good one though
most of the ones
well
*this is not why im here*
damn all the sympho wallscrolls are so lewd
<:GWnanamiPepeEZ:398860718088257536>
switching things up a bit I see
I would too
yeah, understandable
thats what I meant
yeah, gathered

<:muugu:277896187552595978>
<a:MeguSpin:393594620669460481>
~~even over a megumin figure~~
probably the thing i'd be willing to pay the most for
clingfilm lmao what
man I wish the kiri one was in gear-form
'oh no I cant pay for food this week' I say after having just ordered another kiri-chan figure
because as soon as I do ima have no money
im trying really hard not to get too into this
yeah thats like half of my savings
uh
ty ty
<:NotLikePapika:284132078054932480>
but you cant make a perfect girl better
because catgirls are the best
Im conflicted now
I mean
wait what
today has been a good day
good to know, I had no idea
it **is** out of stock
ah nvm
oh dont they?
22$
its like ¬£18 here

so whats your gear called then?
>Nice
in the meantime there's some other stuff that is really good
maybe some nice stuff will come about around the time XV hits
*but ah well*
Sadly this is 100% what I want from a kiri figure
yep...
I am very sad that this was a thing and that I cant buy it
but it just doesnt do it for me
I know there's the catgirl one coming out
I really want a kiri figure when she is in geah form
I dont have the s1 attack cards
its possible
~~if you want I can send them~~
and I see fuga in the s2 folder
I have a folder with all the attack cards
she used fuga in s2
see the collection is coming on nicely
how much was it, if you dont mind me asking
oh its too perfect
*whats in there*
<:meguOoh:358116975752249344>
I love it
all of your stuff is arranged so neatly
KV-2 BLYAT
but there is no mistaking that turret top
thinking this looks very russian
I was looking at the engine deck
oh I see now
smol guns
goddamn frenchies
goddamnit
here's a fun game for me, guess the tank from that picture
looks like a 57mm gun on the turret and a 105mm howitzer?
also thats a sexy french thing
you get the moulded plastic or matereal, then you glue or stick em toghether
you have to put together each individual part
but can be dissasembled, so I guess you can class it as a kit
some of their remote control stuff is ready to run
tamiya mostly make kits iirc
*Angry tank noises*
Owning Hetzer is sign of strength, not weak
Hetzer is always worth it
I might get one at uni depending on how stuff goes
I have desk-space and thats pretty much it
I dont really have anywhere to put it
oh hey, that looks perfect
<:HibikiWhat:336656482907193344>
or do you just clean it off
so what do you all do to keep dust off your figures?
*but I will get round to it*
sorry, i'll likely either be working, too tired to concentrate or sleeping until the weekend
And I forgot yesterday <:tamaSorry:448217362458607636>
Not yet sorry, I've been working all day
Hi
Whuh
Also I'll read in the morning, it's too late for me to be doing this
I approve of this sensible decision
<:GenjurouThumbsUp:267393750349643776>
Ah
This is a public server
You might want to edit that
doesnt show SPG's though
ive got this up
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tank_main_guns
yeah, im fairly aware
i'd imagine it would be the 105
thats uh, very scaled up
105mm?
what calibre did the germans use again?
anti-fortification and infantry?
4.5inches howitzer mark 2
gotta look at that british gun
yeah, I guess
huh
well, its 4.5 Inches
thats a very non-standardised calibre
the fuck
either that or 122
152mm?
ooh
which one?
this is not a sign of weakness, merely good taste
*naisu*
didnt realise you had mio and mugi too
course not
oh yea that was it
nicely smoothed over plothole
*lead lined tanks so no one gets hurt*
*question is, 57 or 75mm of magic?*
thats a very magical girl indeed
`That's fairly close to something else not related at all...`
***TSUMIO***
`Mugo...`
Really cheap for nendos too
I'm far too tempted...
sweeeet
or just a shell replica
is that a real bullet?
what else is there?
gup ones
I recognise a few
thats cool
oh shit
is that karmen rider in the middle?
still, looks like a good haul
ah rip
these the spoils of today's con?
sweet figs
yea
hell
aw
tried that one with my bass, people were *not* happy
ahh fair
so your playing might be right
I did forget how the original is though
as for anything to improve on? i cant say for sure since I dont what kinda mic you're using or how good it is, but maybe a slightly larger range of dynamics, it seems pretty maxxed out all the time
yeah, i'll leave that stuff out since I think you can work that out yourself, you seem a pretty competant musician going off this
i'm not sure if theres a more efficient way for you to play (that requires less arm movement) since I dont play electric (only bass and acoustic), but it definately sounds the part
and your technique looks pretty damn good
I think you have the sound nailed
as for the music itself
sorry, been a while
oh right...

Workshop?

ive never really cared about my appearance all that much
mhm
and I got scared, had a shower and it all went curly again
I looked like justin bieber
I did once...
well, at the front at least
my hair if straight probably goes to my chin
like, seriously
only problem is that it naturally curls so much
jokes aside, I have thought about growing my hair a bit

came out with this
I decided to drop it in a lineart colourer I just found
A cute though
Ive had a friend with that tmp as an avatar for the past 3 months, seems strange seeing the whole image
<:MariaShock:423196877354303498>
by the string placement, i'd say guitar, but by thickness bass. Probably doesnt matter though
cant tell if that cag is meant to have a bass there
ooh, nice
just zoomed out a bit?
is that the same picture as before?
NYAAA
The character from the anime is called Saki, think there's a bit of confusion there

"ooh fine will help us be evil and stuff"

fine be like nah fam we chillin
to be fair, G villains didnt watch s1 either
really liking metanoia, cant stop replaying the pv
that could be kinda cool
does what its supposed to do
I think the tone and sound is brilliant
and when the rate of strum doubles it gets a tiiny bit out
you gotta be careful in some places I think you're playing a little to fast and get ahead of the rhythm
you definately got the skill with the instrument
I dont think you can draw thise kinda paralells to jojo and sympho
(Plus if you dont change thats good cos you're pretty swell as is)
You might not but the ava does
(Also nara nice bikki <:GenjurouThumbsUp:267393750349643776> )
Who knows tho
Its probably a bit underwhelming, its been so hyped up

*sorry I dont actually want to break Maria, just morbid curiousity*
I know various applications throw errors when passing numbers in the realm of 2 billion (due to 64 bit binary), dunno if it applies here
Not that I *want* maria to have an integer overflow
Or in fact, would any number of pulls in 1 go end up in an error
If I were to, say, pull 100 things at once, do you think it could cause the bot to break in some way?

when helper came to mind, it gave me the impression of someone who is baised
if its what **you** want, its the right choice
I know its not gonna help, but you arent
headpat
oh <:meguDed:238539575264280578>
or what is it thats making you feel bad?
do you feel like you've made a bad choice going off hrt?
tbh most of my news is off reddit so the circlejerks just make me accept nothing
and its a fucking pain
if I care about a story I will look for multiple sources, of different sizes
usually smaller ones run by 1 or 2 people can be more accurate, but theres also a much higher chance of bias
its hard to tell tbh
the onion /s
its sad
they arent running a news source anymore, they are running a buisness
we click on the article cos it grabs attention, therefore they get money. Complaining about it makes more people click on it getting them more money
problem is we cant do anything about it
"oh im only racist because my face is wide, I cant help it"
it just sounds like an excuse for someone to be racist
most of the stuff is spouts is garbage
its the daily mail
~~guess thats alot of anime then~~
but 10 hour flights <:NotLikeMiya:362331549410000896>
thinking of going to seattle and vancouver
and we were talking about a holiday for next summer so that was fun
usually does to me, but my family is really chill which is nice
<:GWnanamiWhenLifeGetsAtYou:398860996535386126>
<:IrisTHIS:457676348031500293>
sociable family stuff made me feel better <:GWnanaPepoHype:392308469488680961>
nah, im doing better now
its all good
oh i went for food
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
(can I have some too)
hugs are good
But enough politics
~~almost like a certain military~~
But you can never satisfy them
They are amazing
Problem is, health services are an endless pit of money
Mhm
No idea it took so long
Yeah that definately
Fuck...
You can reach 20 quite easily, without a good grasp on any disability
Imo people need to be educated more about disability awareness
Sadly this world is messed up in so many ways
Yeah fair enough
*which is fun*
So I literally just fall over in pain
Apparently a nerve gets pinched every so often
But my leg never properly healed
It went down after a week
Fell off my bike hard when I was 14, didn't break anything but got huge swelling
I have a similar thing
Damn...
What kind of thing is wrong with it?
not sure *how* serious this is
ok ty for clarifying
emote server
nah
discord whale
üê≥
anyone else be wanting?
pm√©d
<:plateletSalute:467756515579789342>
I made a thing based on the convo, but im not sure if this is the right place for memes...
Cheers for the conversation, and I hope your leg stops playing up
But enough of this, I gotta sleep
It's sad
`smoke the weed and go to ikea` this sounds like both a really bad idea and also possibly the basis for the best day ever
is that -1
I dont wanna escape from my family
bitching is good
a year or so ago that was what I wanted to do
oh awesome
yeah, sorry if I seem a little pushing, i dont really know 100% how the dynamic between you and your family is
ah shiet
you got any ideas?
I know its probably a big step, but is moving out of state an option?
ah...
do you earn enough to consider moving out?
hmm true
idk, it just seems like a really toxic relationship
huh ok
how old are you, for reference?
is it the kind of thing like `its not in a proper organisation therefore its not a real job, despite the money you earn`
wait does she know you already have a job?
for kriisa and elfnein
headpat
well, that rendition at least
https://soundcloud.com/user-312179478/bark-at-the-moon-senki-zesshou-symphogear-makyuu-ichaival
*that one...*
yeah...
is what i would do if I had the emotes
<:awoo:311641258219012096>  @ üåù + :harp:-:chord:
üåö
maybe after bark
monochrome is my fav slower sympho tune
I really like hibiki's vocals in the songs
right now mine are duo shout, edge works and g-beat for bits I need to grit my teeth and get through
what are everyone's go to songs?
~~thats basically driving right?~~
I use it to cycle personally
<a:HAYAI:406649485566017578>
it is the fastest way to run out of breath
its not
wait no
geah music is really good for mindless excersise
other music also works for me
good bit of ac-dc helped me get through exams
metal is almost always an answer
lets invest in some geah's then we can explode stuff as well
well, more sane than I could be
music is basically one of the only things keeping me sane at this point
headpat
just gonna do an AoE headpat for you all
~~or is that not how it works~~
ah I realise
<:MonkaS:386314411410849796>
yep
no u
<:GWnanamiNotLikePapika:408280566266331137>
kriisa why are you so similar to me
*oh shit*
and its like you better go talk to this guy you dont even like who programmes a shit ton and force him to teach you
i dont even know if I want to do CS 100%
im going into uni *next* year
its like
traffic is even worse
and she turned that into why the fuck arent you practising programming
saying how i was doing good
for once I actually had a conversation in the car
and yeah
thanks
heh
I just wanna lie down and curl into a ball and forget everything right now
my mum has an unparalelled ability to make me go from being happy to being worried shitless
ugh, well there goes my good mood for the night
move to <#336297387863703552> ?
got that right
tru tru
quick turn it off before they make another alvin and the chipmunks movie
oh god its chipmunk chris now
i'd strugle to find something greater than this
that you are
<:GWnanamiNotLikePapika:408280566266331137>
oh god its getting higher
does it get higher pitch
the best part
** *ZENBU* **
ive hit the part
oh no
too much **bass**
in other news my fingers are really starting to hurt now
3.5 minutes of constant firing
whew those are some big magazines
negative
ooh send pls pls
or however you spell chris' gear
the faster version is called Makyuu Ichaival
currently no
uh
music for game design?
not sure how I would
im just
true true
but its just a hobby RN
I love music
I thought about Aerospace and Chem eng, but after visits its really not for me
thing is if I dont do CS, im not sure what I want to do
im getting a pretty big monkaS rn
im uh
I just dont want to do it over the summer
oh, I do
thanks to you being the best peoples
oh yeah this probably isnt serious anymore
<:thonk:414150292506935316>
no
no
no
yes (duh)
July
name a famous show, chances are I havent seen it
im a fairly virgin anime watcher
too much on the list already
i mean, I havent programmed in 6 months so its understandable they want me to get back into it
oh, nothing. I enjoy it loads, its just they wanna force me to do a project over the summer which I dont have the motivation for RN
If they invented geah's irl so I could become one
I know what would make me transition
no u
<:GWnanaPepoHype:392308469488680961>
its cheered me the fuck up
oh its all good
üêü
i mean, im not uncomfortable, but sometimes im like, wouldnt being a girl be coos as fuck
its an interesting point tho...
yeah, we didnt really talk again for a long time
~~to which i am trainee mod so I gotta shill it~~
this is the /r/Konosuba discord
ibu, iirc the first time we met, you just joined the server, i'd been there for a week and was playing FFXIV in a gaming channel, you joined and said hi (playing osu at the time), and we realised how close we live to eachother
I wanna meet you all and hug you all and thank you so much
pics are good
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
you do great kerrik
those two years of being slowly more and more rejected my school peeps was the worst part of my life
sometimes a familiar person is all I need
i am happy
well, since you are one of the people who has been part of changing my life for the better
scary
headpat
<:MonkaS:386314411410849796>
thank 11 yearold me for being smort
so uh
like, if I never went to this certain all boys secondary school, I would have never played WoT, never got into my friend group, never got rejected by them, never got lonely and watched anime, never watched konosuba, never joined reddit and discord, never met ibu, never found this server
something that really fucks me up though (slight change of topic, but it still worries me), is how different life would be if you changed a major decision, say 5 or 10 years ago
ah
going off the basis that my life is yours but 7 years behind
wait kriisa when did you decide to transition?
oh god not this again <:OMEGALUL:406898988764233729>
yes
yues
omg
FUCK
lmao
or paint myself in brown paint
put on lots of fake tan
ill uh
~~mind if I join you for some music sesh's~~
ooh nice
but my dad probably has some stuff
move to general?
yeah we gonna take a selfie
1 day b4 my birthday
should be gud
meeting on the 25th
neighbouring towns strangely enough
yis
soon
she comes and goeeees, she comes and goeeeeees
karma karma karma karma karma chameliooooon!
it comes and goes from serious to non serious
also <#336297840529899522>
can guys be gears?
I would if I could go into geah stuff
<:Astolfowink:447369042433409025>
well, not yet
they tryna recruit me
nej
<:dab1:371867912623095808>
that deserves a dab
yeh, it was just under 3 months
~~as in never?~~
and they chose me cos i was really close with ton at the time
it was either me or samps (dont tell him)
wanted someone newer
they needed another mod
basically I read modchat
with tonttu
nah
I'm just gonna live in happy ignorance while I still can
I'd vote for that
Not for me, but cool
Cool
Seems uh
Ah right
~~anyone care to explain to the uninitiated?~~
üêâ
Yea something like that
Idk maybe they were looking for something to catch you out
I felt that too
Fuckin hell
Whew...
ah, thats kinda nice then
you doing ok?
morn
big same
And it's gonna be fucking awful
(It's sympho related)
I'm doing an art project on paint at school I'll send you the result
Stick figures are the best
You don't need artistic talent in my book
Sleep well
Nite
Have a good one
Ok
*shudders*
Meatspin
Idk why
With a pirate
Of this
I saw a version
Ah
<:lizPat:444438157124042763> üê≤
or is that a bit far away
you gonna do it when you get to uni?:
Would be if you were called Rakhi, would you have any regrets
Something to ask yourself
so its definately a good consideration
well its clearly made an impact on you
ohh right
on what?
I like it
sounds cool
very true
I feel like that would change the odds in some way
or a larger chance or somethign
would that mean she has a smaller chance of getting an XY child?
huh
anyone got some inspiration?
Im not addicted to any games at the moment, which is what I normally do
its just hit me that im on summer break now, and I have no clue what to do
ababababababab
this is not ~~Fine~~ Fin√©
oh nice saki! nice to see some are more accepting
our history is so fucking awful in places
<:MonkaS:386314411410849796>
O.o
yeah, thats the truly scary part
you know satire is good when you start to question if it is even satire
oh man
sounds like a good enough reason to me
I eat chocolate when sad too
as long as you dont gorge too much
well
no
and it feels amazing
then you'll get hit with 3 more
you'll be recoiling from one
like
oh, you know the guy I was talking about yesterday ibu? they make puns all the time, and its the best thing
best pun
good pun
not bad
<:loveyui:265261638377144320>
maybe kimaya is secretly a shanghai ring
who knows
what if ibu is a trafficker and is gonna kidnap me on wednesday
like
see now im not sure what to think
I dont really understand it
that could be fun
<:IrisTHIS:457676348031500293>
for me its fine as long as they realise you are just being in character, but I really get where you come from
and because we cant play the game for shit we still lose
do shit like communist germany with russia vs everyone
hoi is really good if you get a strong team of friends
but someone rages and leaves early
I try to
I cant either
yea
but whenever I play civ, Hoi4 or anything like that I never kill friends
randoms, sure lets crush them
I try not to play competetive multiplayer games against friendo's
very same <:MonkaS:386314411410849796>
uh
I guess at least they cover it
but thats kinda strange
and the depression in part too
ah, Im more thinking pre-20th century personally
damn...
huh really?
some of the greek shit was cool as fuck, and china from 1918 to the end of mao's reign was a great period, but nothing compares to the US
its one of the most interesting parts imo
man, I actually love US history
like how did they think that was gonna go?
in which they basically banned alcohol
my favourite amendment was the 18th
from wiki
The Thirteenth Amendment (Amendment XIII) to the United States Constitution abolished slavery and involuntary servitude, except as punishment for a crime.
and just ruin the conversation
I always find a way to word something wrong
same tbh
because I dont want to annoy them
ive spent minutes tryna decide whether or not to send the most trivial shit to people I get along with really well
PM's are scary
yea exactly
sometimes I wonder if talking through it with the person will help
yeah...
like, will this person ever see me in the same way
I overthink it way too much
personally for me, the thing that really gets me is when I make a mistake or feel like I did something I really shouldn't have
but tonight, just feels worse
it happens so rarely
its never been the hugest issue tbh
the first people I normally talk to are people who have been through similar stuff on the internet tbh
ive just never really talked about it with my parents
hmm yeah
*is that a thing?*
no, not really
and havent needed to see them
I got a new one 10 years ago
tbh I havent actually met my gp
ah
GP or general practitioner
in the UK
we just dont call them physicians
oh, I do yeah
talking and venting normally helps enough though
I just get very anxious at very sparse intervals
I dont have a physician
I just feel like ive made a long series of mistakes tonight
thought I woulda been safe since im not at college
Looks like the anxiety has come back
*sigh...*
for some godforsaken reason
I trust ibu
ah its fine
tonight is more than just one...
its normally just one thing though
some nice ideas for a long term solution
ah, it helped a tad
<:astolfoNight:341503038017634305>
have a good one
ok, I wont keep you up with my problems
that must be a small relief
whew...
oh nice!
what happened to change the situation?
hope it all goes well!
headpat
<:BayonetHug:449357117099606026>
<:BayonetHug:449357117099606026>
You ok?
can you *not* like me?
if I ever get into an anime
I dont wanna say this but...
i'd like to keep tabs with you and meet up some time into uni
<:pepohype:396017191918764033>
*well at least you know now I guess?*
thats not a good thing
uh
zenboobs?
well, right now its an option. If the course and uni arent 99% perfect, im just gonna do a generic computer science degree at somewhere like loughborough
fair enough
its not *that* bad, is it?
oh
*why else?*
this is a really fuckin cool course
https://www.abertay.ac.uk/course-search/undergraduate/computer-games-technology/
uh, not 100% sure, lemme check
Dundee has a course I really want
good uni's
I mean what
*And then scare yorin with my driving*
*And then start driving*
brb gonna fuck off to scotland while England floats off
big mood
ok think logically sometimes
<:NotLikePapika:284132078054932480>
<:BayonetHug:449357117099606026>
wait till uni sounds like a good a choice as any then
oh fair enough
oh and also get a cloaking device
dont think logically, follow your heart
aint that right <@431656503490117632>
compared to Kirichan and shirabe, most bots are garbage
I mean
I found it but its your current name
ok discord is a dum
good to keep in mind
*I shall check*
ahh ok
cant remember if it was before or after I met you
or some time around that
I think so, yeah
very yes
and you can see how little ive changed and done
that'd be really cool
good luck!
right, well those are my current choices, but I gotta go shower for a bit. I spent the whole day in a lake and I really dont want to itch later
yep
you probably need alotta c++ and c# knowledge for that, but that actually sounds really cool
<:NotLikePapika:284132078054932480>
<:OOF:449295252759511041>
oh I realise that
its hard
and I just
for so long
this is the first time working properly
cant be fucked to do *anything*
and I feel like ive hit -10 spoons
ive spent the whole day working, hopped up on it
damn, adrenaline is a really strange thing
*worst part is I should get long nails so I can strum better on guitar*
which is nowhere near long enough to get any good nail growth
im usually ok, but it happens like once a month
mm yeah
and due to certain things wrong with me Im worried quite a bit of the time
I bite my nails when im stressed
üëÄ
I think eating food and having a nap helped me find some spoons
good news
my head is big confuse rn
so Ive tried adding it as a secondary name on some servers I trust people on, but it doesnt really help much
so, my IRL name is kinda irregular, and I never feel very confident when I say it to someone. It always kinda feels... wrong? When people say it to me it seems fine, but I cant get over the fact that when I tell it to someone im lying to them or something... Im not really sure
alright fuck it
dont wanna stop the memes
actually nvm im gonna save this for a bit later
oh damn, this reminded me of something thats been at the back of my mind for a while
no u
ah ok, makes sense
so quick question, is the shirabe typing thing where the bot would normally say something, but before the bot sends it, it gets overwritten because <#336297840529899522>
we use 'Scrmz' as an expression of mild annoyance, so when they say it just casually it really confuses me which is funny
so something that I find kinda funny is that 'Scrmz' is a bit of an injoke with my college friends
~~plus who else is gonna supply me with kiri art~~
you lovely swedish person
I cant hate you Kerrik
love you bby
swedish cunt comes to mind...
: )
go for Fergus, I wont bite yer head off
but if you feel like it
so stick with scrmz for the most part
and I was like ho fuck
and at one point it said it
I watched it
no
*which is fun*
the only fergus I know is shreks son in shrek 3
I dont even know tbh
but if you wanna throw in a few with my real name that might help
its honestly far better
please go with scrmz
off?
it just feels
im not too sure
that didnt feel right for some reason
ahh fuck
for those interested its Fergus
mhm
dream green
becuase that sounds like fun to me
<@!263983345669505025> you want me to go to saki-chan's old one?
*gets no u card ready*
smh lets all just live with Kerrik, makes everything alot easier
oh
:/
and I dont like it
my mind is in a really strange place
its probably time for me to sleep though
I missed some words
*guess i'll just have to sweden then*
also is this still <#336297840529899522>
big sad
which is pretty good
sweden is 11th
or is that just norway
dont the nordic countries have a really high gdp tho?
of course
and call them the 'united states'
then you can unite them
shouldn't be too hard for you to fix
its fine they already split it into easy to sort countries
>Nice
isnt sweden just a few trees and a couple of dirt roads though?
*working with kids is really hard mentally*
Ive been running her at full speed for a long time today
yeah
cant say my mind is running at full speed either
happens to me too
ah its all good
sounds like an interesting situation for a relationship though
personally i'd find this kinda thing too embarrassing, since im pretty socially awkward as it is
hope it all goes well buddy
*ooh this is fun*
but its more fun to keep people in the dark
I think I have been informed of the news
*well, not all the time*
I'm not actually screaming internally
I also have some news
they cant choose, so what do you do there
one issue I find, is all 'baby stuff'is either pink or blue, nothing else
I remember making some awesome tracks that covered half of the house
hotwheels were the shit
the only issue there, is society right now is set up in a way that without a gender, you cant really have any sort of identification
but still would be a cool thing to do if the situation arises
<:IrisTHIS:457676348031500293>
this is just me, but as cool as it would be to do, things change in life so I cant see there being a very large chance of being able to
<:BayonetHug:449357117099606026>
alotta the time, people just dont know better
my grandparents always call me 'the man of the house' when my parents are out doing something
headpat
If you think you are a shitty person, thats a pretty huge sign you are better a person than you think
the teaching part, that is
thats a great start!
what is your current job then?
something to hold on to in hard times
try to find a long term goal if possible
seems like a nice place to be at times
do you prefer being in japan?
oh right, thats a good thing I think
is moving away an option?
even if you *did* know what they meant
I thought that was a pretty good answer
thats a good thing!
a whole load more than sad.
mate I wont be sad, I'd be fucking devastated
no it really fucking wouldnt
then you can say to yourself *I can do something*
ok, so you said you dont have a qualification, maybe the first step would be looking into getting one
<:BayonetHug:449357117099606026>
oh fuck yes
add 3 letter and remove 1
goose == rooster
<:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
ya dont want to do anything that can result in legal action
<:BasaExcite:391790924843319298>
<:NotLikePapika:284132078054932480>
I feel for ya
oh fuck
I know you got the whole petty thing going on, but one solution could be leaving a note saying you *have* left early
Is there anything else you need to get your hands on?
Woah, that's great news
Have a nice meal, hope it goes well
<:KiriCheer:442974585529434113>
Keep us updated Kriisa
what you gonna do? Ignore?
huh, you wanna talk about it yorin?
sorry I couldnt be up earlier, but I'm glad everything is taking its course <:GenjuurouThumbsUp:336657189475188740>
My perception has been destroyed
*you sayin it aint Wolfsbane?*
I like names that tell a story, and a hyphenated ones do so even more
gotta say its really interesting
<:squeefox:313407839152635905>
~~im sorry I should really stop doing this~~
<:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
any specific kind, or is more of a general thing?
Welp, life sure is doing it's whole... thing I guess. Various things have made sleep these past few days pretty damn hard
I'm fairly close with my parents, but im (ironically) too anxious to bring it up with them and I really have no idea what to do. Do I see my GP about it? What kind of things should I expect to be done?
Ive always had a pretty big issue with anxiety, but ive always put it down to just teenager stuff and hormones, but im kinda getting the feeling its more than that
this kinda brings me on to one topic ive been trying to come to terms with over the past week or so
fairly reserved I guess?
nothing more than the kinda stuff I'd be thinking
not particularally
alot of my worrying is done on the inside
without being you I cannot tell
headpat
dont worry friendo
same, in a confused way
simply put yes
personally want to have life move on a bit before gettin into anythin
I dunno, close friends not really looking for a relationship, but its cool being with eachother?
sure
lmao
kinda interested to see how you summarise it
im uh
you explain it
or is it more fun to keep it a secret
I mean sure
*this was not my intention*
<:NotLikePapika:284132078054932480>
sorry im not david cameron
my poor brain
<:NotLikePapika:284132078054932480>
It's just I wanted to let everyone know first
I appreciate it
I don't want anyone to feel bad, it's just I think it's better for my mental sanity
Alright so I'm just gonna go out and say I'd like it if people can stop joking about me and ibu. I think it's great and it gets me laughing to myself most times, but my mind is really messed up right now and I think this is probably one of the reasons why. I've got some big stuff coming up that I really need to be 100% ok for, so for the time being, a couple of weeks or so I'd like it to stop
smooth
<:NotLikePapika:284132078054932480>
<:HibikiWhat:336656482907193344>
you too WFC, I dont want to leave you outta this friend hug party
and would be so happy if things started to look up
but I genuinely care about you
look, im not gonna lie and pretend to be good with words
dont you dare say thats a lie, because it aint
you matter more than so many people ive met and got to know in my life
it may be hard to comprehend, because at times it sure is for me, but I genuinely care about you
every time you say you're going to get drunk I get really worried about you
you couldnt be more fucking wrong
no
Mass headpats
*to which today, my answer will be to go to bed as well really soon*
when I get home and get in the shower is usually when my brain decides fuck it ima just go to sleep now you handle the rest of the day yourself
ah, when i'm at work its fine, I usually have a great time since I enjoy it so much, but it drains me completely
I dont feel nearly sane enough right now to try to talk about it with my parents, but its got to the point where Ive just had to shut them out completely for the day because I dont want to deal with their shit
spoons exactly
I'm really starting to get the feeling the place i work for isnt really working for me... its really tiring, both mentally and physically, and the past three times ive come back from it, ive been so drained that I basically cant function for the rest of the day
<:KiriCheer:442974585529434113>
good job!
oh you got them to get you onto the starter dose?
alright, the worst of my stress is over now, so its business as usual for me
<:Hug:450538862641545226> hang in there
I swear, reading through the comments is even worse
I imagine its a similar feeling
<:HibiMiku:431315702008512523>
or would you rather not say
did anything specific happen on that day?
If you want me to give ya attention, i'd be happy to
I read that as absinthe and now I dont know what to think
<:DMJii:458047433067200512>
is that another one of your obscure jrpg's?
masterpiece
<:lizPat:444438157124042763>
ah rip
also I could probably re-download gta... something to do over these last few weeks
well, with those transactions I mean
what are you considering buying?
we've met twice and planning a third soon
*although, a con sounds like a cool thing*
I just wanna go and hug you right now
<:NotLikePapika:284132078054932480>
and living costs
you just pay for accomodation
iirc foundation years are free
did it affect your social life in any notable way?
I am also a fan of Isaac Asimov
I dont have that kind of time
So what do people here know about foundation years? Are they worth it and all that
well fuck...
still, any more advice/knowledge on foundation years would be appreciated
or ya know, whatever you decide to change your name to
*you will always be wobbles to me*
eh, dont really care tbh
true...
I think it depends where you go tbh
I will have to check
chances are i'll be with my dad and the day will be pretty busy, but if I get the time i'll see what I can do
<:MonkaS:386314411410849796>
but im gonna do some research on uni's regardless
the powerboat thing needs to be done before october since the course is in november and in march and I wanna have it for next summer, but you are probably right about that
and im very set on doing computer science
im usually fine with motivation, its just the past few days
and also Rakhi I'd appreciate that
im pretty decided on going to uni, but I just dont feel motivated to do stuff
or at least getting lessons
*and then there's getting my drivers license*
so I can do more and work more
*and then there's getting my powerboat license*
its more of I cant motivate myself to see whats in the courses
well
theres just too much stuff for me to be able to make sense of it all and do something about it
also debating applying for a foundation course at somewhere like warwick or Durham
and Would put down both coventry and Loughborough
Ive already been to 4 (5?)
ok, so its UEA, then 2 out of the three of Exeter, Kent and Southampton, Abertay and maybe 1 more
not sure tbh
having a really hard time getting motivated to do things right now.  There are a couple of things like applying for uni open days and booking onto more training for my job that I need to do but never get done
wait so this is someone you go to school with? Yeah thats never fun to do...
could be a good idea
ah right
oh right? that'd be interesting
yeah, the only way I could see myself getting to one of those is through a foundation course
please tell me, I wanna know
I hope they plan to take more steps
it seems a tad like a 'sorry you found out'
<:NotLikePapika:284132078054932480>
Oh damn that is a while
Ah shiet
How long is this gonna have to continue for?
Hang in there Kriisa
<:NotLikePapika:284132078054932480>
Hits at the oddest of times
Ah it really is
So glad to hear it
Oh awesome
I don't know how close you are, but maybe that's the answer...
I could do with some sock hugs right now
Also, sock hugs <:MikuBliss:336657233712513024>
Hang in there, you'll get the time eventually
Headpat
<:BayonetHug:449357117099606026>
4‚É£
Gonna have some words
Stress is gonna start soon with me getting my timetable and realising stuff is a little bit fucked and I don't get any free time like I'm meant to
<:KiriWhoops:442974593498611732>
Also you have no idea how happy I would be if I see button 4 in there
Alright home now, hit me up either here or in dms, I'd love to see how it goes
But will later
Out rn
Yeah I'd love it
If I come back I have failed
And on that note, I'm going to try to sleep
But no! There is no better use!
You'd think I'd put this power to better use
<a:rikkafingerspin:395790623631736844>
*is it flirting if it's telling the truth?*
*shrug*
Babe you already look cuter
<:AE3803DoesntGetIt:467756515390914572>
Kaos chan is that you?

Last year before
Nah
Ok turns out I got a little bit I haven't done, but I don't have time to get it done before tomorrow because I gotta sleep... hope my bluffing game is still on point
I do this way too much but I want to change it starting now-ish. Anyone got ideas?
why do I do this to myself... Got a summer project I have for college due in first thing tomorrow that I was meant to do over the summer, and I'm not sure if I did all the stuff I needed to but I cant find where I wrote what I needed to do...
Yeah, mine went from getting BBC to ABB
They seemed pretty full of themselves
The C I got hurt tbh
They're practically the same course up to year 3 so that's why they are the same
Software Engineering/Computer Science
Ah any advice and prior experiences are valuable
They want A*AA and I got ABB
*I'm 3 predicted grades below*
But depending on what the other unis I visit are like I will see
They said there was no point in it, my predicted grades are too low and they'd just reject it
My only way is if I massively overachieve in my A levels and apply next year and have a gap year
Welp, turns out I probably won't be able to get into Southampton, they raised the requirements since i lasr checked so I basically have no chance any more... It was a really nice uni too
So on this whole planning thing so I don't fall behind on work how far do you suggest going? Just when it's due in or anything more than that?
larger and higher quality facilities are nice, but the rest of a stuff is a huge pain
because of my college being part of a secondary school we have some extra restrictions in place that mirror those of an ordinary secondary school
its something to do with keeping track of everyone at once
but we cant come in late even if we dont have a lesson for the first 4 hours of the day
they, and I quote "trust you enough to let you leave after lunch if you dont have lessons"
*6th form
last year of upper sixth
*I KNOW RIGHT!*
*because of the rise in terrorist actions in europe and school shootings in the US*
yep, all the schools in my county are being forced to take extra security measures
ah hopefully the anime should suffice for now, but i'll give you a shout if I feel like i need it
also discord blocked by the wifi, so i'll need to use data for that
it barely runs FTL <:PepeHands:422099282275991555>
and it really sucks... I just wanna go home
this also happens to be the time when I start binging an exorbitant amount of anime in a seemingly impossible amount of time, all while hiding my laptop from anyone who cares enough to call me out on it
so this is when I realise my college timetable is completely fucked to the point where I have 4 hour gaps of nothing on thursday and friday with lessons that *start* when everyone else leaves, but I need to stay in school for *security reasons*
<:PraiseTheGay:411773591860936715>
*goddamnit I'm not supposed to answer my own rhetorical questions*
Well, video games and anime pretty much
*what happened?*
5 year-old me was a proper lad
What, like that time I kicked the door between the boys and girls changing room down when I was 5? /s
I just don't have people to go out with and get drunk with
That's what people would have me believe
I've never actually got drunk before...
<:ShirabeEmbarassed:336657288477671436>
*in some ways, at least*
I already aspire to be like wobbles
Too late
Oh
Also thanks for the advice everyone! Really appreciate it and I'll keep you all updated
<:NotLikePapika:284132078054932480>
Oh god what happened
I only get 5 applications though, I can't apply to everything
I could do foundation at an easier place to get into
But they shut that down pretty fast
I was banking on the foundation course
Perhaps
It's too 10 for cs iirc
Nah, cherish it mate
Oh, and one other thing that sucks, they don't let you do a foundation year at Southampton if you do maths and physics or maths and CS
then immediately after try to talk?
hmm in that case thinking it through might be your best bet, no matter how much it hurts
for me when someone says they want a serious talk I try to get it out of the way as soon as possible. For me at least, its never as bad as I make it out to be and if I end up thinking about it too much it tears me apart pretty much until I have a chance to talk to them. This might not be the same for you, but its what I try to do to stem the feeling
damn thats clever
Hey that's a good start
appreciate you telling the story
Woooooo
It feels like the most minor shit to me but it's been gnawing away at me slowly for 3 or so years...
So this has been bugging me for a while and I kinda wrote it off as not important, but if I go to uni I really want to find nice people to play music with... I've never played with anyone I actually like since my college is full of real knobheads, but I'm always kinda scared I won't be able to
that and hypothesis testing, but they're kinda similar
its one of the only things that I can just *do* without really thinking too much
I love doing proofs
aah, all that fun stuff
just, shapes and stuff?
what does geo cover?
oh
what did you normally do?
I know it seems unlikely, but if I like you someone else surely does too
Hope they liked you
Best of luck
no memes except fields of wheat ones
Turns out may knew all along that the EU wanted to do that so left before it became an issue
Where is it being implemented?
Well that sucks
Bleh
Remind me, what one was that?
*Not any more there's a blanket*
Burning cancer orb
gotta say though Blumenkranz (KLK song) is really goddamn catchy
maybe you dont realise it, but arent eating enough?
ngl those books were impossible not to binge
I cant really help, but I do exactly the same thing...
I cant even begin to comprehend how it must've felt
I think its good that you tried one on
<:howlewd:474601881562382346>
only some of them were 100% black screens where we had to randomly move the squares around till we got lucky
oh yea kerrik you'll love to know my friend was messing with my phone, saw your game on it, then progressed to play it for 20 minutes
<:ShirabeEmbarrassed:278546061755154432>
I just want you to know that I intend to be one way of venting you can never lose. This place will always welcome this sorta stuff, and its important
<:meguDed:238539575264280578>
is this emptiness from the bra thing?
I will literally never get tired of people sharing their feelings
there can never be 'too much', you're always welcome to dump as much as you want
too much dumping?
what do you mean?
Great to hear you're safe
its great to see
I wouldnt want to be the person that takes it down
*It's a new dawn, it's a new day it's a new life for me...*
*and im feelin good*
sleep helps sometimes
yeah, I might do the same
things are complicated... to say the least... They're gonna hurt. Sometimes the pain will feel good, sometimes bad. Holding on to the good bits in hope that it will keep us going... its all people have sometimes
it would be interesting to see the study run with other games and other genres of games
of course, the key word being more likely
huh, thats an interesting study
It's a hard thing to do, so good job getting it done
I think thats what its saying yeah
heh, looks like stats
I think something more interesting, although more frowned upon, would be the reaction towards toxic behaviour, compared with non-toxic behaviour
<:meguDed:238539575264280578>
Starting to get pretty lonely
Well this is my first time being alone at home for more than a day...
sounds like the best thing ngl
<:SansFingerGuns:490506709752872973>
*nightstalker*
I remember there were a few web games I had loads of fun with playing 'hacked' versions of, where you can basically just have a good time
that can be fun though
That's one of the plusses
I gotta say though, the food is nice
I just want my Starbucks while sitting in plastic chairs with no padding
<:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
Oh, this is economy, but because my dad's work pays for his flight he gets a 'BA' gold card which lets you in all the posh places
Yeah
Idk I feel so badly out of place
Just
This is...
Yeah I actually prefer the shopping mall feel
Like, I'm on a cheap as chips flight to Glasgow and I'm just here in the first lounge and it just messes with me
My dad goes away to the US for work every month so gets all these special benefits, and it just feels so odd to have
Just the buildup
Airplanes are awesome
There's like, a huge build up
Air travel always makes me kind of nervous...
<@284390402210136064> I think personally that you might be worrying too much about what others think, is what i've found from personal experience (although that might be anxiety talking). Also I think blaming it on autism is alright, as long as you dont have information saying otherwise. Seems like a valid cause from my point of view
I would join and queue it for you but I don't want to interrupt miku
Actually
Isn't far off
That...
Back to slowly calming my soul to rhcp Dark Necessities now though
I'll let you pick one
Heh, that's alright
<:ChrisDess:496159417335545856>
Yeah fair enough
Thanks Hatsune Miku, and thanks to... Sakooni? Meliisa?
I have been blessed
Wait 1 sec
I mean
I'll be up for it some other day though, all going to plan
Tis indeed
I need to sleep or there's no way I can get up at 7 in the morning without help
Sorry I can't:(
Is this what makes people want to go out?
But yeah, I'll let you all know how crocodile Dundee university is
Ah
If boondocks are lakes then yes?
Sounds cold
Fake scot
*still, beware*
Very true
After the flight
I'm taking he train from Glasgow to dundee
*who said Glasgow is my end point*
It's fine I don't wanna drink
I'm coming to scotland, better beware
Oh yeah yorn
Probably right...
Here
I wonder if they have sake
Jp is really nice
I'm not actually drinking alcohol
I would like to say
Nothing is there to stop you having a bottle of ¬£80 whiskey, apart from your own metabolism
But it's all really good and it's all really free
I'm not too big on it
Yay for UK drinking laws
Also free alcomohol
theres not much to do I guess... hopefully i'll find up whats up before its too late, but until then i'll just grin and bear it
I might just... listen to music and drift to sleep
but this time I just have no clue
this is a bit of a first for me since I usually know what im worried about
thanks
dont even know what from
just got hit by a huge wave of anxiety
But the US is a big place, it may be the best option
Planes can be expensive
I think looking for alternative travel might be important, depending on the distances
I don't know really, but I get the impression you'll need to get a stable job pretty sharpish
A severe lack of sleep or going to bed late
I think telling the truth might be a good way of dealing it but if you want to avoid the conversation something like "I don't want to talk about it" may work as a temporary solution
In all seriousness I'll ask my sister, she's been at uni for 2 years eating veggie only while there
Vegetable stroganoff
<a:BeefStroganoff:393778449862492164>
It doesn't even have to be beef
I feel like we should have a beef stroganoff revolution
Like, all major powers
Not just one or two
Governments need to take action to solve that kind of thing
Gonna be hard
That's..
12 years...
Can you give me a summary?
Don't have much to say except I believe in your ability to get through it and if there's anything we can do just ask
Sorry it got a bit lost in translation
Ahhhhh
I know you mentioned stopping working, are you looking for other work, or are you planning to stay unemployed while you finish your a levels
Got to the point where I pretty much had my first ever mental breakdown from everything getting to me
That's the main reason I stopped working Tuesday and Thursday evenings
lets hope that trump created enough contraversy for that to happen
*damage limitation pls*
too late...
too...
<:NotLikePapika:284132078054932480>
*fake news, dont trust the liberal scientists*
two parties that disagree on the same point means small shifts in either direction
issue is there just *isnt* enough green energy sources right now
currently in the US alone the number is about 63%
saving the environment takes money, and the change isnt as obvious as other stuff so governments that want to stay in power are less likely to make drastic change
Bic razors <:TsubasaYareYare:407397617451139073>
Otherwise waxing is a good way of doing it so I've heard
Shaving can take a while, but if you don't want to spend money it can be the best option. Do it in the shower if you have a spare couple of hours
/ metaphor / simile or w.e the correct term is
That is a really good analogy
Perhaps looking for your own irl Kanade Amou might help
I think having these feelings is ok, as long as you are able to accept you will not be able to be with her
holy shit
I really hope trump is far out of power before he can get anywhere near doing that
There are resources available, I just haven't read them
I have very little clue how to structure it or how long to make it or what to cut from it
I... haven't started writing it now
Feels even weirder condensing your life into 2 pages too...
and it feels really weird pretty much bragging about everything i've done
i've just started listing things i've done
ugh, writing personal statements sucks
So I had some real asshole friends until not that long ago, long term kinda thing, from 11-17 yearsold I guess. We were all in the same class at school and were the only ones to really like games. At that point they were great to be around in person, funny and the like but every so often decided just to exclude me from stuff they did. (This happened gradually more and more over the 6 years, I shoulda probably clocked that they didn't really like playing wit me)
Anyways, this kinda hurt because I had nothing else to do, so it really made me value the time with them... *god this sounds really toxic looking back at it now*. Despite the last 6 months being with them being some of the worst times in my life, I really feel like the experience changed me in a good way and really value the time spent with others, almost subconsciously expecting them to one day just get tired and say piss off...
There's no real reason for this, just wanted to share it and say I appreciate all of yous here, all your different quirks and personalities and I hope no one has to go through that kinda thing, because goddamn it pushed my mental health to bad places
Although I'm in a very *cba to do anything* mood now, I'll see if I can get an idea what to aim for
I'm out now, but home in just over an hour
Please do
IIRC there are more, but they're mostly irrelivant
yeah im aware of it
that makes more sense
ahh
SC being secetary?
I want them to be like that
Oh god please
I'm tempted to see them now...
Oh god...
makes me think the mods just dont care
<:CarolShock:430939013235474432>
I appreciate it
thanks
which... is nice
she isnt gone yet... i'll get to see her one last time
feeling pretty empty right now...
I just found out my grandma has days left to live
That might help
I guess put on warm socks, get some calm stuff and just try to chill for a bit...
Damn...
Just dysphoria stuff or is it more than that?
Chances are that is the right move, best of luck, and I hope it turns out alright
It's a mix of SoL anime romance feels, losing a grandparent and a shit tonne of work beginning to rear it's ugly head
And here I am, 1 in the morning listening to the same song on repeat wondering what's to come
Everything has taken a lot longer than normal
This... has been a hell of a week
Best of luck
Ah, that's a relief
You find the extra money?
How are job prospects?
Shit...  sorry, there's not much I can do to help financially, but I hope you can stabilise, get the stiff you need to live away and all that
It was awesome seeing you a few weeks ago, doing again would be cool
im glad, best of luck having it stay that way
gj not getting caught
sounds good
hope it all goes well
When I visited I didn't really notice that, I take it's different without me
<:Praise:391038800232448000>
<:MikuPeeku:391813945293406208>
I wouldn't compare the countries, the issues are not the same and any sort of comparison will be bias
`Loud jeering grunt noise, akin to the ones heard in parliament`
Yeah
I remember being invited to two servers, one my Rakhi and one by one of the other mods on konosuba
That's fair, I'm probably the same, or at least I don't become active
I actually think it was an animeclub watch that got me active here
I joined after watching s1, active about a month later
Dead but not forgotten
The whole world is slowly cooking itself
with long waits, people not picking up or caring about calls
but was really stressing since the process is a nightmare
I have a friend who is applying for hormones through the NHS
what's the job, and with what company?
best of luck mate
best of luck there mate
well, if im in the area and you're on shift I might come say hi
oh right
I'd imagine its a good abbreviation, but it never hurts to check
Also best of luck Sketch! Hope it goes well and all that
They are both slurs in my book, Jp i use personally, but i dont talk to enough chinese people to have needed a phrase. Safest bet would be asking someone from china what an appropreate abbreviation would be, but also realising people have different tolerance to different phrases
So happy for ya
Omg thats amazing
<:Praise:391038800232448000>
basically we still dont know
glad its all worked out in the end
oh damn thats awesome
so... did you just skip 11 months of waiting?
oh so thats cool
so to the uninitiated and unknowing, what does that mean?
I'll try to get a chunk sorted tomorrow, hopefully i'll feel better for it
Thats... some really useful stuff meta
Mocks in 29 days
Exams in may/June
Nay, im half way through my last year. Ill be heading off this September
Last 2 years before uni if thay helps
Nah, English 6th Form
Ah, i need an A and 2 B's so exams only
Usual exam stuff i spose, on top of the rest of life piling up on top of me
Those are what're worrying me right now
No, still gotta do the exams
üå©
And yeah, university
Computer Science, all going well
I love you all
So i somehow spent the last hour and a half staring out of an open window into the freezing cold night, listening to the same song on repeat just... thinking... about everything... how everything I've done so far has led to this coming year, what uni I go to, who I'll spend the next 3 years with... and i'm scared. Really fucking scared. I don't think ive ever felt so scared in my whole life and its just hit me that im gonna be doing the things that ive seen and heard so many others do, and I just dont feel ready or prepared for any of it. Sure is cold outside right now, and I cant see it getting any warmer anytime soon
~~kinda sounds like fine~~
sounds badass kerrik
Remind me to give you the biggest hug when I see you next Rakhi
there certainly is an art to it, making it seem sincere is really hard
Right now theres far too much waiting, i guess you gotta hold onto a rock until the flow dies down, and not flow downstream
although they do frequently say C++ masterrace... so I suppose a pinch of salt needed to be taken
for discord bots? I remember a friend of mine saying for bots the api (or something like that) was terrible
afaik python is a hard language to code bots in, so I dont think thats nessecarily true
Imo you should also take into account canon age if it is under 18. Lots have much younger personalities than their looks would have you think
Havent seen pewdiepie stuff in a while, was there anything else particularally "white supremacist"-y he did that may have prompted this?


That makes this even worse
I found something
Oh jesus fuck
Hopefully this tweet is enough to quell lots of the hate
https://www.kotaku.com.au/2019/03/new-zealand-gunman-says-subscribe-to-pewdiepie-moments-before-livestreaming-shooting/amp
Apparently he posted that he was gonna do it on 8chan, as well as posting his "10 page manifesto" that was literally just a memewall including things like the navy seal copypasta, and I think the "I identify as an atrack helicopter" thing mixed between bad and broken english
*the holy speed grenade*
if you assume that you cant go far wrong
naitonal is 60
motorway is 70 in the UK
Personally I believe as a driver you should aim not to make another driver change direction or change speed, thats how it was taught to me
Currently I believe there isnt a law against it, but you will get a demerit in your driving test for it
depends where about you are, both in the UK and the US
its a joint responsibility to stay safe on the road imo ~~even though a surprisingly large number of people are terrible at it~~
I get aiko is cool and all, and its nice to help artists who need money, but you also need money too
I think having a couple of pieces commissioned is likely alright, but iirc you have quite a lot now, and I feel like there have got to be some better things for you to spend money on
C doesnt even need to be an idiot in this situation
Thats just my take on things, no reason its any more right or wrong than any other way of doing things
My issue with labeling everyone who voted leave a racist, regardless of whether they arent or not, is it doesnt particularally encourage a discussion that would make them potentially change their views to a more accepting way.
 If I had to choose between someone who frankly is insulting me, and another person who hasnt said anything to tempt me either way i'd go for the more indifferent camp rather than associate myself with a group that insulted me mere moments earlier.
I just wanna point out from an external observers point of view it almost seems like you're pushing him to explain something in detail that either lectric is struggling to put into words, or doesnt understand himself completely. I think this discussion is really interesting, but just make sure that you dont push too much 
(Also apologies if I interpreted it completely wrong  and you (lectric) dont feel pressured in any way, it just seems like that from my PoV)
Whens the next election? 2020? Hopefully any change from this is too slow to have too much of an effect and someone who actually wants to preserve human rights gets in power
damn, yeah. Really jumping the gun there...
ohh right
ya just dont pull shit like that
if *that was le ebic joke* and not just a giant misunderstanding, like, i'd have to be convinced super hard not to have him: a) out of the mod team, and b) out of the server
And even worse if I planned to work but didnt
Personally I feel like trash if I do
Ye, thats another good way of doing things
End of each day i'd write down what good and bad i've done, and for each bad thing I'd do an exercise set tomorrow (25 pushups, 25 situps, 15 minutes cycling and 50 burpees the next day). Not only helped me get more fit, but made me actually feel good about getting work done
Personally my body just cant connect doing well in exams to going/doin what I want, so I use less motivation, and try discipline instead

looks as good as I remembered
~~no nose pic this time?~~
Theres drama, and then theres this
1000 hours so far this year, still got a way to go, but its getting to the norm
some good news for once

Yeah
Ah... just jumping in seems... optimistic on their part?
What lesson/topic/lecture/thing you having?
congrats gal!
I dont know who that is, but it does seem like pretty extreme misinformation mixed with supporting of own beliefs/scapegoating issues with a side salad of irrational hatred
Ah
Is sensationalist the right word?
Also in our current day and age of sensationalist media no news can be loads better than lots of news
iirc the reason nz was targeted was since it was viewed as a "safe space"
I havent heard anything, apart from the christchurch attacks
Fun
Nope
My thoughts go to oz or NZ personally
Where would you say the *least fucked* english speaking country in the world is?
ahh
whatevers gone down, just know that there are people here who appreciate you and wish the best for you

* but this word will make people react more! *
Lmao what
Its fucking shit that people put shit like that on billboards, like thats actually gonna change any minds, it just gets those that oppose it pissed
While I believe much more can and *should* be done, at least it begins to normalise the idea in children and others who are stuck further in the past
so you can just become a robot with the body you want

a way of uploading your consciousness
uh
Also ima make
The course i've applied to is meant to have shit tonnes of maths in, and is a pure CS course, so hopefully none of that.
Now more interested in working on practical applications for VR, alongside development of AI and usage in creating arts with it
I was once super interested in working for a game dev, one of the reasons CS interested me so much. The fact that the jobs are becoming increasingly shit is becoming wider knowledge though, and from what i've seen in universities, specifically in the UK is that there is quite a lot of stigma against the larger companies. Its getting to the point where you're pretty much told if you wanna make games, make your own because otherwise you're gonna be exploited
Dont know if it started there, but it definately seems as if it was a stage in its escalation
people are certain New Zeland will trade with us, since they did before we joined the EU, and are certain that will satisfy all our trading needs
I think I saw some talk about it yeah, saying how we'd need to share it/abolish it/americanize it or something
2 horses used pull cart on train tracks, so tracks made according to size and have never been removed, boosters must be transported on train, so are downsized to fit on carriages that fit the tracks
reminds me of the way the width of a horses body determined the size of the Solid state boosters on the US space shuttle
bigger ones to those who forget
is it like, the word trans?
if its a robot doing it, i'm interested to know what phrases in that are banned
If i come down to that part of the world i'll be sure to give you one
Hopefully the ocean isnt enough to make it not-work, from what ive heard these long distance things are hard
Excuse for a holiday?
*was that an intentional ny'all*
<a:SayakaYell:393564307893518338>
I did that too, but was mainly to see if games forgot to add more than 1 pronoun, saw it once as a kid, cant remember where, but ever since...
hope they like you as much as we all do
also brilliant!
* that picture seems oddly familiar kerrik *
Both at high school and college level
And are responsible for a large number of major fuckups over the years
In the UK its edexcel
Pearson is the owner of various exam boards that operate in various countries
Fuck pearson, fucked over exams in the US, now fucking over maths exams in the UK too. 3 leaks in 2 years is unnacceptable and they've designed the paper without most of the spec in mind, making questions literally impossible method-wise unless you do further maths, inside a normal maths paper.
Truly livid
<:ElfneinWeld:586027421296492585>
shakey hands
does look like your sats though
A levels are traditionally taken by people in the age range 17-18
but... yes?
I have no idea what your education system is like over there
it would be something along the lines of university (I think you call it college) entrance exams
üôÉ
`It is the third year in a row that A-level maths questions from an Edexcel paper were revealed online ahead of the exam.`
`Pearson, which runs Edexcel, said the images were circulated "in a very limited way" shortly before Friday's Maths Paper 3 exam.

It reassured students no-one would be advantaged or disadvantaged and they would not have to re-sit the paper.`

I see no way how they'd know this, just seems like corporate bs
right, makes sense
totp?
on a slightly related but different topic, its quite amazing to me how some older people can have a very set view on things without much information. My aunt is of Russian decent and doesn't really use the internet (and in fact is suspicious of her children for using it), so when she brought up the topic of people making the giant trump balloon to follow him around the UK she just thought people were being rude. Apparently all she (claimed to have) known about trump was him being a cool business owner that decided running for president would be a cool idea and somehow missed pretty much everything else
I wonder how fast it'll get removed for quarantine evasion
oh they made a new sub
filled with whats probably best described as very right leaning memes, opinions and stuff thats bordering on hate speech
trumps reddit fanbase
r/The_Donald
the subreddit got "Quarantined" for continuous breach of reddit rules and inaction of mods to apply their own rules
As long as you dont move from one issue to another
Providing your cousin is cool I reckon thats a move in the right direction
looks like irony
Ever since I started work, my evenings have felt wasted, havent done anything that I usually enjoy and I dont really feel like doing anything, just make food, sit and listen to music, text a mate or two or just waste time till i need to sleep...
luckily?
we're gonna have a similar cycle to every other time this happens... people trying to find a solution, followed by a rebuttal blaming something that isnt guns instead of adressing these concerns, followed by nothing happening
huh
oh really?
the ones shot?
i'd really like to think it isnt until proven wrong

In a large crowd of anonymous people with large deindividuation, lack of personal consequence and a potentially controversial outcome people are dramatically more likely to shout for someone to jump off a bridge (or similar)

<:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
but yeah, got plans to sing musicals together, then we're seeing dragonforce playing live next saturday
i'm a dude
exactly
ayee its gonna be fine though
~~although everyone saw us going at it so it'd be a really awkward thing :p~~
if this falls through we're in the same friend group so I want to do it on good terms
Aight, appreciate it
Its... a sensitive topic afaik
I guess i just need to find the right time to do it?
Thats a fair point
Nah i didnt
We have done a lot of unique stuff together thatd could make it more than just a rebound, but i just cant be sure
He said its a really sensitive topic though so i guess if i did bring it up it'd have to be done in a good way
Afaik she doesnt know i know much about it, her mate told me when he went drinking with us
aight so I found out the girl I was getting with recently came out of a relationship (on the guys terms, start of October time), so i'm a little worried that all I am right now is a rebound for her. We havent got past first base (sober), and while i'm all for taking it further i'm just worried that its going at a pace that'll make it a short-lived thing
tv got lobbying and money
<:GarieWink:336657101273169921>
1 sec taking this to dms
wait actually uhh
i'll come down when I get some free time
* oh shit yea *
I think i probably will end up doing it by the end of first year
true
the thing that stops me is not wanting an innate reliance on it. I know its not addictive, but I get pretty bad anxiety so if i become financially dependant on it, well...
~~although if i were drunk enough I probably would, which is a pretty bad thing~~
ive turned it down multiple times to the point where ive never tried it myself
I can understand not wanting to completely
(if you're willing, that is)
i'd say go along, give it a try under a safe environment and have some fun
chances of being caught are gonna be suuper low unless someone does something else thats illegal while under the influence
idk if she likes me that way but we clearly share enough interests to have good chat
and cheers
yeah my thoughts too
aight so yesterday, was going ice skating with my uni (I want to get into ice hockey, so gotta learn to skate). While on the minivan there, i got talking with a couple of people, both had really good energy like we all got on well. One was a guy, one was a girl. The girl basically acts like a bro kinda thing, if that makes sense, like a best mate youve known for years kinda thing, stuff like high fives and hugs on the ice, that kinda stuff. Basically she's pretty fit and while at the time I wasnt really looking, she said since we both like musicals we should go see the new cats film together (i know right...). I was like fuck it, no way i'm saying no to that, at the least we can laugh at it. Things move on in the evening, conversation moves to work and shes really secretive about where she works which kinda intrigues me, but i dont think anything of it at the time. Me and the girl talk some more the next day (today), i know shes single so i guess im kinda looking to get to the stage where I can pull her when we go to the cinema together. Work comes up again and is quickly dismissed so I think fuck it, i'll check the facebook, did some digging and found out she works as a poledancer/lapdancer at a place in my city (lifes  full of plot twists eh?) At the time she didnt want me to know so now I have to continue as if I dont know this <:HibikiWhoops:585839808115507222>, so good job me. idek if she even likes me that way so who the fuck knows whats gonna happen eh? I dont have an issue being with someone who does that as a job, just dunno if itll affect my chances...
Cant help but laugh at the shit lifes throwing at me recently üòÖ
my life has taken a particularly peculiar development and honestly I just need to share it/get some opinions
<:NO:626671880765702144>
<:thonkumi:371857480571158528>
KANSEI DORIFTO!
sleep is good, enjoy it
<:GWnanaPepoHype:392308469488680961>
aight, ty all
stopped it
I uh
on s1 ep 5 right now
~~and ibu~~
watch K-On with me!
https://lets.rabb.it/BUh0kmkHGO
oh, ive been there
and I play double bass anyway so it wont be *too* different from that
i'd imagine for a bass the strings would be thicker
Pain isn't really an issue since my fingers are basically numb at the tip at this point
So, on the subject of picks, I've been playing acoustic for something like 10 years now (without a pick), so switching over now just feels wrong. Do I need a pick to play bass properly?
~~first I gotta learn bass~~
Fun to be had there
But the bass part!
And I could probably sightread the guitar part
I'm addicted to the song
I swear
Panzer Vor!
<@&448228101089132544>
https://lets.rabb.it/FAmLj6JHJO
ok, sounds good
what ep were we on?
ok, i'll start setting up now
is it just on CR?
but im fairly novice when it comes to
I should be able to
start in 30 minutes?
tis all good
ah, thats not a bad place to stop
but I did
im not sure how
true true
good, good
~~also have the file on google drive~~
theres a soundcloud link if anyone wants it
was it monochrome?
s1, gen and okawa were best girl
I naturally find it hard to sympathise with 'villains', so there might have been that bias at the time
at the time, she was probably the best for me
oh, that chris song was on point
<@431656503490117632>
the dess thing is cool too
she has pretty interesting fights, and really cool attack cards
honestly, im not sure why I find kiri the best
been playing the bass part to Cagayake girls, so i like to think im getting told to play it more like mio
she understands the advantage of the bass part too!
I gotta agree with you there buddy
ah, its really good
I was having the same issues with rabbit the other day
but if we wanna restart thats cool too
we're 4 minutes in
https://lets.rabb.it/FAmLj6JHJO
so if someone else could host that woudl be good
its lagging to shit
but its up
not very well
uh
im not sure if Im the best person to host this
uh
sure
sue
is it?
or is everyone here already
are we gonna wait for a few more?
very true
(only partial /s)
ok shows over, we're watching this today
its literally called girly air force
omg
slash tea
ok brb gonna make me some food
yeah, im giving it another go over the next few days
ooh I was just playing WT
I was asked to start a tad earlier
Speaking of which, time to turn off this account and switch to my alt. It's too late in the UK for 'scrmz' to be awake
*that made more sense in my head*
There's probably a Canadian guy living there but they felt bad kicking the devil out so they made them a portal so they could have a place to stay
I mean, thanks, very helpful
<:NotLikePapika:284132078054932480>
So I'm interested to know how does the next anime we watch get decided?
is anyone else gonna watch GuP today since half the people arent here and zolg has already seen it?
regardless, we got a volleyball anime and a basketball anime
but an ice hockey anime would be cool as fuck
and you gotta remember that anime is japanise, and im not too sure how in to ice hockey they are as a country
I would imagine field hockey would have a much wider appeal internationally

its gotta be over 100
the amount of times ive seen "No season 2 No life"
looks really cool
yeah, I had a look at NGNL's synopsis and a few reviews
<:runnerbutactuallyrunning:372606749779165184>
<a:HAYAI:406649485566017578>
then maybe KLK after that
good to binge while im taking it slow with K-On
alright so next anime on my list to watch is gonna be no game no life
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JABdS-HN5A
something similar to this?
whats the budget
Im intending to watch it at some point
do mark it before you say thoiugh
<:papikaSmile:284172971059314688>
I've been meaning to watch some flip flapper at some point, so I would 100% be down for it
so the warbeasts game is about to start, this is gonna get interesting
I had just finished that episode
ah, you timed it perfectly
*these quotes are on point*
you're so empty
is that a name?
ok my mind has been fucking blown
the whole dynamic between the two MC's is just amazing
oh damn im loving this whole warbeast thing in No game no life
what am I doing with my life
<:NotLikePapika:284132078054932480>
*wait theres a manga?*
there's just alotta content there
I could honestly go for a rewatch of haikyuu
ive never enjoyed binging 60 episodes so much
*who knew volleyball was so cool*
I like to take Haikyuu as an example
oh yeah, so true
whuu
damn, that sucks
but yeah, any sorta hockey would be awesome to see in an anime
at one point I was pretty good, A team for the under 16's
yeah, its mandatory in my school to learn
~~and even then I only really played in goal so I dont even know too much~~
dunno, ive only played field hockey
but I would love to see an anime for hockey regardless
fair
`ball`
wait are we talking about field hockey or ice
not team ones anyway
*sorry I dont really do sports*
just go to a club and get good?
wait, so how does one get into ice hockey then?
and badminton
is everyone up to start soon?
should be able to make that work
what site do you use
I *should* be able to
That can't have been too good for viewer retention
<a:movingeyes:412247669814198282>
Ah right, haven't actually seen it so sounds like fun
Anzio?
is it any good?
ooh what anime is 'tomorrow' /s
<:NotLikePapika:284132078054932480>
if not im even more sorry
if it was im sorry
*was it zolg*
but I think *insert name that I forgot* finished it by themselves
we havent watched ep 11 and 12 as a group
ah, i gotta do it for completion sake
*guess what im doing tomorrow*
oh it really is
im glad I watched that
welp, thats all of NGNL done in one afternoon and evening
interesting... concept
thats an uh...
I got other stuff on, but if someone sets up a room im sure people will join
I cant be here either <:PepeHands:422099282275991555>
welp, something just came up for me as well
<:Aqua7:412399091054804993>
Last season
Gun lolis
<@284390402210136064> Also ~~you~~ we should get round to watching it
I really liked her arc I gotta say though
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
~~Either that or zelda~~
Either her or Dorothy wins my award for best character
Anyways, yeah the chise thing on the train was the coolest thing
<:tamaSorry:448217362458607636>
Kinda makes me wish more people near me liked anime and could play drums, keyboard and another guitar
one of the things I enjoyed most about it was how I could literally go off and play the songs they did
*and god, I really needed the comf that gave*
Loved every moment of it
welp, thats the first season of K-On done
if we do though, we'll ping the anime club role
others may be busy for whatever reason
ive been watching kill la kill myself all day so probably not
Speaking of anime club, we should really finish that GuP movie or watch something else
ah, the rumors were wrong
*It's worth it for* <:explosion:270246673194811392>
Other mods don't seem bothered
It's allowed, although I'm not a fan
In all seriousness though join it if you want. Some of the people are a bit strange but it's nice
<:explosion:270246673194811392>
Uh
<a:explosion:393915412003160066> <<a:explosion:393915412003160066>270246673194811392> <:ExplosionRainbow:458387608884477952>
~~which never get used~~
*Hoover's the voice channels*
*dusts the channels*
*quickly cleans the server*
U-uh!
*sounds an awful lot like Konosuba, the only isekai I've watched...*
idk, if we watch it in the future
btw this isnt spoiler territory
theres a fuck load of manga I should read tbh
<:NotLikePapika:284132078054932480>
yea, it was one of the only anime's ive watched that made me feel something...
No bulli
Alright gonna go read it now
Neither, thought I'd give it a try...
Ok Miss *skulks away*
But... But...
I still gotta read that one
Cuteness levels have yet to be exceeded
The megu sick day one omagash
They're amazing
Yea!
Now I'm feeling all kind of things again
Yea
And it was a Kazumin one
Until I got back into the new light novel volume
Until recently I forgot the feeling, it slowly died away
Not the first I watched, but the first to get me into other animes, and the first I actually enjoyed
Konosuba will always have a special place in my heart
For all three
I think the reason behind these was me having a crush on one of the characters O.o
honestly not on as much of a deep emotional level
mine was Konosuba, Gamers and one other I cant think of off the top of my head
~~this may be because I might really like some specific characters from said animes~~
rip net crashed, gamers is one of the only two/three shows that made me feel something on an emotional level
I shall also be cross
<@284390402210136064> if you're ever away or busy or whatever I'll be willing to host if needed
<:wakarimasu:468431782061277204>
*I do love 'understanding'*
I've really enjoyed it so far
<:comfylion:312836917773205514>
I wonder if they'll make a joke about that
Heh
Megumelia
*cackles with afilliation power*
What's this, konosuba, youjo senki, overlord and something else?
<:meguOoh:358116975752249344>
Tis a sad day
Only jojo I hav
<:jojoNotAmused:289860172216795146>
*and damn there's a lot of it*
All this stuff people talk about
I only really began watching anime spring this year
Chances are I won't watch it
For me it's overlord Re:
Which ones haven't ya seen?
Wasn't it 5:30 before?
*Work?
Will next Saturday at the normal time worm?
sounds good
For once kayaking doesn't clash with things I want to do!
Ah phew
It's a Saturday we doing this on right?
*we'll go with <:Germain:421434126856486912> for now though*

I may or may not be able to make it
~~pfft you signed up toget pinged~~

Der film?
So next watch this Saturday?
Rimuru is really cool
*but not GX*
**WATCH SYMPHOGEAR**

<@209896097026408449> where'd ya find this?

Sankyuu
Oh please god save me if this is true, I am in no way prepared for this. Only mod on too <:chrisNervous:358563931381432322>
So I remember the movie announcement, did they announce s3 too?
Huh
Or is it just the 4 way isekai thing
Because if it is I gotta get home, the kono server is gonna be a shitshow and I gotta sort stuff out
Season 3?
Is that
Is
Wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait
Ooh I should be back in time for the watch tonight woo
I will be there depending on traffic
Appreciate it
I typed the command in but idk if I was authorised then
Maybe
Depends on the user count
Yeah, the host should get some
My friend Kent has been before so knows more than me
Or the chat
Let's take this to dms if you have more questions
Idk
Uhhhhhh
So daijobu about that
I was gonna pay for myself but.i can convince my parents to pay for me

Oh

KATSU
so just under 5 hours
Its 12:11 right now in the UK
5 UK time is 12 midday US east, but clocks are changing at weird times so im not sure where it lies
***DAMN FUCKIN RIGHT IM READY***
also I am in no mood to host rn
make sure your ground harness is fastened
spooky
Noticeable, but done well I reckon
The cg is good too
It's primary goal is to be a nostalgia trip for mecha cartoons in japan, but it does a good job for people who didn't too (at least that's what I heard)
especially megumin's nose
a *lot* of people on the kono discord have been fairly outspoken about it
yeah, i'd be interested to see how they do it
That was either my favourite or second favourite one
In which case aww fug yeah
That looks a lot like it could cover volume 5 of the light novels
Shame it's gonna be a while before we can watch it
Ooh, interesting
Should be home by 6
I should be home by 6:30
Why's that?
That's probably better for me„ÄÅI'm out in London for most of the afternoon
Mega Ma'am
Its about time, been looking forwards to black fox for ages
OH MAN
Regardless of being advertising for a game or not, i really enjoyed uma musume
just BLJ
throwaway server I made to listen to sympho music tonight, cos kirichan (bless her) cant play soundcloud <:angerdess:468155017682223124>
https://discord.gg/KesEdA
still not sure
I...
yeah
minus a few odd ones
alot of stuff from this album is quality meme music
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVcAyEMM4Cc&index=2&list=PL4Nm4rhtI5e57ElPzTNKW0XHE1wisqr5H
nice
this is a banger
oh man this

no kick weeaboo's pls
<:NotLikeThis:420823551944425472>
oh god
what a masterpiece
SNOW HALATION SUCKS
lets go love live
I mean whut
~~same tbh~~
<:shooketh:440941122554953740>
will do
it sorta reminds me of Neil Cicierega
oh its beautiful
oh I like it
or is it not at all
to know how this is remixed
im scared
new Museic: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azAEHCQgcUI
I'm waiting for someone to make a sympho remix of despacito and call it DESSpacito <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I reckon I could maybe do parts of it if I had the time?
inspirational
wish I was this talented
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oS_yNsDsbaQ
some people thrive off it, but some change
its kinda sad what fame does to life
yeah thats probably for the best
I wonder why that is...
like, proper feelgood music for me
it sounds fuckin amazing tho
surprisingly ive never actually listened to any weezer before
<:meguOoh:358116975752249344>
+ a kinda cool animation
oh man thats some pretty great swing
good sing
good song
I hear your bit
ooh
its just these ones are executed so well
Im not much of a fan of his other two ones of the style
but its just making me feel *gud*
ive never really encoutered them untill a few days ago
but im listening to Keane music alot
idk why now
the main part of wow wow is ok, but the first 10 seconds makes me nut
the start just gets me every time
my favourite was wow wow
this one is new to me
** *300 FILE CABINETS* **
one thing I really struggle with music in general though, is i'll listen to the same songs on loop for a few weeks and literally nothing else, but then i'll get kinda bored of it. Ive tried to binge it less, but its almost an addiction. Its normally ok since i'll find some other stuff to listen to,  but if I find something truly great like this I want to savour it and I just cant
yeah I can understand that
if I choose to listen to the lyrics thats cool, but I like the sound so if its just on in the background thats really cool too
for me its the kinda thing I could listen to all day
<:NotLikePapika:284132078054932480>
... and suddenly the band's name takes even more meaning
and its an added bonus when they sound as great as this one
I like songs like that with actual depth and trying to raise awareness
ahh, suddenly it all falls into place
oh really?
are these people who have comitted suicide, or were *this* close to it or something?
I couldnt tell you them now, but I recall them being said
towards the end yeah
oh yeah, thats a good one
i'll give septembers children another listen to
still, really cool stuff tho
~~and to be completely honest I was playing dota with it playing in the background so I wasnt 100% focused~~
but I think hero of war's lyrics affected me the most
ah they were all pretty good
really like it
welp, I listened to all of the stuff you recommended from rise against
Will do ty
I'm out having a birthday dinner now, but I will when I'm back
Rise against, that is
I'm so sorry I actually haven't heard of them before
yeah, seems to do the job
ah ok
interested, since Im thinking about recording myself
do you record it, or use software like sibelius to make it?
I love it!
things you've composed?
wait so what are these?
<:GarieWink:336657101273169921>
either that or I can just shout really loud and you'll hear
I forgot in this digital age messages are permanent
oh true
depends how long I sleep for
it uh
alright, you two have a great time, im off for the night
*dont text and drive too much*
mm fair enough
this probably aint the right channel, but hows it going?
but you'll need at least 300 filing cabinets worth of data to store it all on
so what did you choose in the end? Okitegami?
sounds like alotta fun
oh thats cool
you say for kareoke, where abouts are you doing it?
Okitegami is good if you wanna dess alot
these are cool too
Okitegami
Waikyou-Shenshou Jing
Ginwan Airgetlamh
I've been liking that one alot recently
Tsunaida te Dake ga Tsumugu Mono
*ooh*
~~although if you're gonna do it now I might have to stay up a while longer~~
cant do it right now, since I might sleep soon
ah, thats cool too
cant assure you'll have my full attention, but it'd be interesting to watch
depends when, but i'd be down
big rip
ah, ive heard of it
what show is that from?
and if you asked for specific tunes he would give you a cool CD to bring home
eventually realised random pop-song requests didnt work
I remember spending so long tryna work out this guys thing
~~cant be sure i wont be back on later~~
nite <:astolfoWave:417759162920075264>
** *DAMN FUCKIN RIGHT* **
*ya know whats worse than texting and driving with one account open?*
also one of the most viewed, non offical dota videos
old and kinda cringey, but entertaining
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oA3dzcnQ5c
idk why but I was watching a dota video with this as like the comeback music
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQBuJMg04VQ
seems like a good deal for me
*wait does that mean if I listen to geah music for a while longer i'll mainly like that kinda stuff forever?*
something is just *off*
I need chris to sing
actually
`I have no problem with this`
geah remix
I think its great
üá´
Just listening
Oh, not watching
Remember watching it a year or so while cycling and almost got hit by a car
Ah, that thing...
It's one of those that's never got old for me
I guess you will be remembering the 21st night of september then
For some reason this makes me want to listen to space boy
I like it
fairs
gotcha
common time as in 
4
4 
right?
ah right
also what program do you use to make it?/
what time is it in?
cool
well, i'd be interested to hear the finished product
ah fair enough
I think i'd need to hear it with music to be sure
for some reason, something bugs me about the last line
do you think it needs some sort of rhyming to it?
I reckon its alright
For the grace, for the might of our lord
For the home of the holy
For the faith, for the way of the sword
Gave their lives so boldly
It reminds me of the chorus to a song by sabaton
dont mind though since its the only good edge works that I can find on youtube
yeah, it kinda is
the fight?
which one?
dess_next
dess_next
guess we aren't getting across the wall...
god, what have I done
dess_lq
*that should do for now*
when the video wasnt part of a playlist
it worked
hmm
`300 Filecabinets`
Oh yea, whoops
But you ain't wrong on the mad part
ever since i've loved that stuff
yeah, my guitar made me learn the guitar solo in aerodynamic to practise tapping
awesome
wasnt discovery turned into a whole animated movie?
daft punk make some great tunes, mostly overshadowed by their more popular stuff
<:meguOoh:358116975752249344>
<:MikuBliss:336657233712513024>
Also dayum that theme
Her smug aura makes me happy
Damn right you saw nonon
<:NononSmug:453854264138137606>
whats that wiseman thing?
<:NononSmug:453854264138137606>
*let the beat overwhelm you*
https://youtu.be/gDvq9USBbUA
How badass Nonon's theme is
Can I just say
just going through FMA:B for my first time and i'm absolutely loving the OP: 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uq34TeWEdQ
*oh my god I need to play alestorm on bass*
with such bangers as 'fucked with an anchor', 'Drink' and 'Mexico'
alestorm is fantastic
I wonder if we should tell Kiri-chan to stop...
That battlestar galactica thing reminds me quite a bit of some of the music from FTL
https://youtu.be/ImafuPUbb30
So yamada kun, the anime I just watched has a good op and it's got me hooked
(maybe)

nani sore
and that is cool too
and now queen is playing in the background
its a cool song ngl

**IN YOUR MIND**
All I can say is that the Songmaster seems to have 'lost their way'
back in... september, october time I think
thats the thing I sung in too
oh hey

dess_remind me 17h Klocko birthday

<:disgust:454737141545566218>
~~or at least thats the impression ive gotten from the game from others~~
I prefer GunLolis
any moba fans here?
¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
GirlSFronTLinE
gsftle
gfl is something ive tried so hard not to get in to
hearthstone is good
all you need to do is navally invade and china just dies
yeah neither
welp japan surrendered
same tbh
does it matter that I forgot to build planes?
and cos im the US I cant do shit yet
not yet
so uh
also china is winning
oof discord doxxed
being canada
but the ussr is nowhere near its poland focus
yeah they ate france instead of poland
and then poland joined the allies
oh... I just realised... germany never killed poland...
~~its either that or just bingewatch 16 episodes of anime~~
ah, i'll give them a look
lmao
fun game

roguelike
ooh
it makes games more interesting
nope...
pushed all of france himself
goddamn musolini...
the war shouldnt've even started yet...
also, speaking of singleplayer, im playing hoi 4 now, and the one time i decide to play the US, this happens...
anyone got any good singleplayer games they would recommend for a long plane ride? (preferably one I can run on a laptop)
~~if quests even count~~
pfft we already have legendary spells monkas
what does it do?
wait is that the new expansion mechanic?
love the antonidas otk
I turned the notifications off, but im confused what it is
and its really annoying because it sets off a low hdd capacity notification every 10 minutes
so about a couple of weeks ago this appeared in my devices and drivers, but im not really sure where its come from...
so all this time, the soviets have been not at war, doing this...
either that or japan has its airforce somewhere else
its over 50% iirc
it happened after I nuked japan, so maybe it was that
we're still fighting in europe
the fuck?

japan doesnt care about europe it seems
we have total naval control iirc
good point
uh
so the front line is literally made up of their manpower
I managed to get china to help in the war
surprisingly not going *too* badly
:3
its time
fuck that, we have freedom on our side
not sure whether to wait for ussr war with germany
preparing for D-Day
^^
fuck it im just gonna spam destroyers
I just dont know how to get them on the cv
oh I had loads
probably shouldntve done this then...
dunno how to get planes on them
its just I dont know how to use cv's properly
worst thing is I did
fuck im so shit
boats are a bit behind but w/e
recent artilelry
recent tanks and infnatry
max firepower doctrine
do you get the impression they want me to join?
for some reason
yep
bit late
thanks churchill...
guess i'll just build a big army
<:GWnanamiNotLikePapika:408280566266331137>
ussr hasnt started the line to declare on germany
or the molotov-ribbentrov pact
germany hasnt even done anti-comintern pact
japan is hiding
france and poland gone
yes
world tension is stuck at 80% and wont rise...
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkyXaUcOb0Q
was a really decent card back then
spooder tonk
yes
<:lizPat:444438157124042763>
"giant anime tiddy"
oh fuck thats op
wait, so it doesnt take all of the 10 mana
Jealous
Yeah, as with most things
Is tabletop sim worth?
<:NotLikePapika:284132078054932480>
so addicting
its just
I'm really regretting having started osu last night...
get toxmonger
take ironforge portal
play as tracker
rng likes me
tax evasion <:meguPuke:238539036619177985>
ah but you get an extra 2000 coins remember
i said that the whole thing was
no
~~I could lend you some when we meet~~
otherwise i become hyperomegawhale
and I promised never to again
I used to whale a bit
<:NotLikePapika:284132078054932480>
me too please
wait ibu, it says here its only 70gbp
as patches came, i disenchanted some, to the point where i have much fewer now
at one point I had like 26 legendaries, but this was a long time ago
and every time I do, i disenchant loads of cards and end up having a tiny pool
but i still wanna stay ftp
ugh i want to get back into hs
whew
how many packs?
im trying to stay ftp on my account, so idk
is this for mech jaraxxus with card packs?
Hehe
Hope you manage to sleep well tomorrow
kill 5-10 taunt ezpz
have elven archer
should I make a quick deck with the legendary I got?
but this is better
i was gonna do my solo adventure quests
sure
get like, 2 or 3 cho's on board
cho was the best shit
no u
lies
when he was actually viable
I miss milhouse manastorm
i played since g&g :pepeez:
hi rich
i dont have malchezar
why not
sure
uh
I will beat ibu with my emeriss hunter!
and I thought i got lucky
<:smh:290478190382546944>
hand-hunter new meta
it any good?
that was the one
emeriss
is that the one?
wait it was like a 10 mana dragon
so not a disenchant yet
riight...
also, I opened a witchwood pack, got lucky and got the hunter legendary. Is it any good?
its not live though
for a hs tracker I just use the overwolf addon
onyxia shaman when
looks like a semi-decent arena card
TiL mind vision doesnt keep card hand buffs
everyone playing taunt druid rn smh
Hyper Japan? Is that some sort of convention?
And tbh I wouldn't have it any other way
Gud point
<:IrisTHIS:457676622749892620>
What the fuck are we doing with out lives...
Damn...
Still not sure whether or not to be proud of this
Whew
Tbh neither does hs, but I doubt it beats my dota time
Not sure about the first two, since one of them doesn't have an hour counter
It's probably my second or third most played game...
~~You shluld~~
I wanna get back into hs this patch
Lowkey kinda hyped
Ah cool
Have the card texts been revealed?
<:OhImPinged:386220060915531796>
Nani
ah ok
ScrmzLoudAF#2402
ok, sent
i'll add you
alice, whats your battlenet ID?
they 7 mana one wont cut it
like, 2 or 3 mana
you need a magnetic mech with 'cant target with spells or hero-powers' that is reasonably cheap
I think for a magnetic kind of thing to work
lmao just play wild and use justicar <:GWnanamiPepeEZ:398860718088257536>
wait, what is zillax?
its a marathon tho
also, Ritsuen is great
lets just make more lool
^^
so is the onepunch man one
also fuck, these sympho songs on osu are great
u on
lmao
peercrewop
I just choose those days to be cool
nah
ah im only cool on a thursday and friday
and repeat forever
then attack up then stealth
then stealth
you get windfury on first hit
of course
3 mana ezpz
a 9/9 windfury divine shield cant be targeted by spells and heropowers
its just ptsd for me
im just really unlucky
wait nvm
wait did they make it so flappy bird cant get windfury?
so 6 cairns
and 2 seeping oozelings
playing through a witchwood run and I have 4 cairn's in my deck
oh god I remember saying half of those things
uh
ah rip
gotta focus on the k-on
oh my god
thanks Shirabe
im dead
stop
cant
im fucking done
lmao
boi
guess it depends how well it synergises with other stuff
thats my only worry
it is probably not reliable enough
if its random
depends how the 'attack a neighbour' thing works
eh, looks like it
reminds me of that
I remember when I used to run betreyal
its called floop's glorious gloop
UI <:meguPuke:238539036619177985>
*why did i disenchant maly*
oh fuck
what site are you using for HS card reveals?
new card?
we done tko
oh hi
<@!127644949884698624> ping
my other thought would have been nier
im not sure
also never heard of the YS series
and I feel like that could be interesting to get into
ive never really played a singleplayer RPG game before
ah ok, its been a while since Ive been keeping up with the meta
weapon removal is just nice
+ skull of mnari, if thats still a thing
I see
ahhh
wait, so does twig give you 10 *full* mana crystals when its destroyed?
huh, kinda makes me wonder, can shirabe actually ping people
and ibu wanted to let you know?
I think it was because shirabe pretty much pinged me
tried that
dunno how to turn the torches bacj on
and a chest got locked
some torches went out
and have no fucking clue what to do
but ive got to a bit
ok so im loving the combat so far
ok, lets give this thing a go
tidy up and the like
just got a little left to do
pretty much
yeah
uh
might try it
well, im gonna try to do some work first
ok
so its all good
ive been known to skip text and cutscenes
since I have no idea what youre talking about
who knows
~~maybe~~
its fine, I like drowning
dying and learning the boss is part of the game
if I dont do it on normal I dont get the full experience
never
no
~~but that means I gotta kill fire guy again~~
since ive already played the demo
probably origin
idk
might get it tomorrow if I feel it
im not that bored anymore, so im gonna leave it for now
just not really sure tbh
which did you prefer?
which is?
probably the first game of this style ive played, so im fairly new in that regard
felt so good tho
<@!263983345669505025>
which ys is the most recent one, and does it have similar combat?
thats like, 55 minutes on this fucker
also: fuck this guy
that was cool
ok
ok this is really cool
no one told me it would get harder
fuck
tryna kill the boss now
not too long
uh
yea I had to jump
maybe i need to jump first
oh really?
brb internet is my friendo
and the texture on the projectile bugged out a bit
my only fire attack went stright through them
wrong OP
I was so close
damn
this is good change
a 'preemptive nerf'
I guess it coulda been hella OP with the new mech stuff
ohhh
wtf
demons are not cool but cool if ded
ships are cool
cute girls are cool
sounds cool
and the otherone is better still
heavansward is good
but it gets better in later expansions
yea
~~its just there are so many textboxes in FFXIV~~
depending on how things go
I might still do
I would probably get origins
say if I were bored and by myself
so its not YS
and oftentimes play games to socialise
the only issue i have with ys, is that its not multiplayer
yeah...
~~probably the first time ive wanted to get addicted~~
hopefully this does me game wise for most of the summer
LetsFuckingGo.wav
now I gotta find a way to clear out 64GB of space in my harddrive
*Oh shit im buying siege right fucking now*
Happy with how it sounds?
Cool cool
I'm sure it's gonna sound awesome don't you worry
Cool cool
Be there room for another guitar or a bass part? <:BasaExcite:391790924843319298>
<:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>

rainbow 6 is done
ho boy
I feel for you buddy
<a:hyperwao:435761264652713984>
you'll be ok
*take my energy*
big sad
im a fan of the model tbh
usuall kinda stuff then
that seems cool
oh damn
whats a 'premium club membership?'
oh cool
with some sort of premium model?
but i'll be sure to watch out for when the open beta comes out
doesnt look like there are any announcements
is there any official date yet?
i'd be up for that
im fairly inexperienced with the franchise, but it seems like a cool thing
hmm ok
would you recommend maple story?
looks pretty cool
that whole image is just beautiful
if you need me im free for most of the day
cool cool
<:meguOoh:358116975752249344> thats an idea
<:OOF:449295252759511041>
ah well
oof
does it have any ports?
seems interesting
never heard of it, but i might give it a look
ohh ok
which one was that?
~~I guess im really gonna fuck with my sleeping pattern this summer~~
just dont hurt yo self
all good
well
ah damn
sometimes I amaze even myself
<:BikkiFacepalm:441505427218235405>
I just wrote that

I dont even remember that
aah
trump is great
<:tamaSorry:448217362458607636>
<:MonkaSsS:443449101871349766>
<:EZ:470143448427659266>
no worries found another server
still salty they removed that emote
:PepeEz:
damn so close
Juan sec
ohok
has anyone ever achieved that?
what about 0 stars?
'you cannot lose stars at this rank'
I have 5 stars rank 25
wait so that means im top rank?
dont recognise it
whats that one between doom and bf4?
~~brb just gonna make control warrior a thing with maiden of the lake and a stolen coldarra drake~~
pretty strong then
damn
passive one?
oh no
no shield bot <:FeelsBadMan_vertical:470056553685319681>
*Inspires in sadness*
*Jousts in silence*
maybe not aggro ones
i'd say 99% autoinclude in decks, even tho its a tech card
dirty rat but even dirtier
like
oh fuck thats
~~brb just gonna add some counterspells~~
thats pretty cool then
oh really?
fan card?
no point even playing hearthstone anymore
*OH GOD NO*
*But chess is the best thing*
is that an active?
huh, thats cool
love me drawing perfect secret pally curves into insta-win
*concede*
*BY FIRE BE PURGED*
*Hee hee hee, hoo he he he*
*None of your buisness*
*Who am I?*
<:PepeHands:422099282275991555>
you're wild now
no u
what was the 2 mana 3 2 cultist card again>
tryna get spell damage relevant again
oh
brb gonna craft king krush
8-8 1 mana chargers
otk is a meme right?
sure...
then I just lose every game
or meme hunter
there are two cards better than shudderwock
*there's never been a worse time to get into the game*
lot more options to deal with aggro
control is nice I guess
I havent actaully
"I love trump"
druid gotta take a big dick first
but it could do
I think it will take a big meta shift
9 mana 30 30 new 4 mana 77
fun fact! no one knows what the ancient one attack sounds like because the opponent always concedes before it goes off
close
*Absolutely nothing*
I do promise to you
is better than golden *gruul*
nothing
because you just made someone feel really fuckin good
even if you lose because of it, it was still good
yogg is always good
mhm
oh, more of the omega thing
>Nice
or at least, thats how i interpret it
*thats* how you get the enchantment
when its on the board
no, I think its if they are played
problem with the egg thing is that its weak to boardclears
ibu you up for a game of something in a bit?
<:EZ:470143448427659266>
niceu
we play wild and use brann
true I guess
smh
big 3 mana 15 15
summon loadsa divine shields then eat them
"Glory to the Sin'doeri!"
"Who knows what secrets we'll uncover"
fake kiri <:AngerDess:448761344104333312>
"desu dess"
flamestrike for 3 more mana?
honestly it might still get run since what other options does mage have?
~~also arcane blast now good~~
im not sure if it will be strong enough, since it requires a turn setup, and oftentimes you wont have that luxury/will give the opponent a turn to prepare and make favourable trades
the card doesnt really feel like a huge game winner
username is the same as in discord
same goes for me
ok, ive added you
9 now?
Good

People got good taste
Have a good sleep
Oh this is perfect
huh?
I suppose its fairly ok in the closed beta since its kinda exclusive
ah right
are there any measures in place to stop inappropriate stuff coming up?
I love that you can just put your own art in the game
it doesnt work with the other kind of package people are building with the new cards
yeah
means your boom turn isnt too bad tempo-wise
it works well
t6 whelp into t7 boom, you get your 7/7 rush on turn 7
yeah it does seem to work well there
ohh, that
I must've missed that
mechs get rush?
wait is this the new warrior thing?
it does seem awefully weak to silence, but it depends if there are more high value targets for it
mhm
doesnt that one only trigger on the oppenonts turn tho?
hmm yeah
any other good synergies you can think of?
yep
seems weak to silence, but could be nice in the new cube priest
this one in particular felt so fucking good
its like, in that one moment, you were singlehandedly responsible for winning the fight, and furthermore the game for your team
Enigma, a hero from dota 2 has an ultimate that creates a 'black hole' that sucks all enemies in slowly towards it, stunning them for 4 seconds while doing so. Its basically the most powerful ult in the game for lockdown, and getting 3, 4 or 5 enemy hero's trapped in it with an ally to throw some damage in there means you can win a fight singlehandedly
I still cant get over how good 4 man blackholes as enigma feel
yeah fair enough
still need some sympho stuff
*and thats hard*
problem is I gotta justify getting a switch over anime merch
I would probably get gungeon, zelda, isaac, odyssey and quite a few other things
a lotta good switch ports as well
but as time passes I keep thinking "hey wouldnt having a switch be useful here"
I cant see myself using it nearly enough to get the use I want out of it
I just need to justify it to myself
** *I NEED A SWITCH NOW* **
<:NotLikePapika:284132078054932480>
**Fuck thats actually the coolest thing**
Patch 5.0.0.12574 (2016-04-24): Cost increased from 2 to 3.
Commentary: "Ironbeak Owl is a staple source for an inexpensive Silence in many decks. In line with our overall goal to make Silence effects more costly, Ironbeak Owl is moving from 2 to 3 mana."
but yeah, if priest starts running any GvG mechs, the spare parts could work very well with the new legendary
quite a while ago if I recall
yeah
they nerfed it
its 3 mana now
I imagine spellbreakers or other silencing cards might be mandatory in most decks
damn, so many of these cards released look very weak to silence
since you need 2 cards for it to work
the draw a card bit is nullified tho
~~something something cube priest~~
woah what
also forbidden healing opie OP
does that mean lifesteal heals twice too?
morn everyone
but if you need more board clears than you already have I guess it could find a use?
but equality does that anyway
makes it so you can trade your silverhand recruits in?
I guess it doesnt kill your own stuff?
honestly I hardly see any ways this would be preferred over something like equality consec, or equality pyro
oh fuck, i remember that too
the dragon priests still haunt me
I remember BRM much more than all other patches for some reason
maybe a bit of kel thuzad
thats all I recall from it
and Sludge belcher
I just had a friend get to legend with it and trash me, so thats why it comes to mind
oh was it? ah yeah
the 5 mana 7/8 taunts
reincarnate shaman was scary
probably not tbh
uh, im not sure
Reincarnate shaman
1 mana, draw a card combo draw 2 cards
adreneline was the best card
back in beta
oh, only then
No matter what
It was always doomsayer for me
*"The light shall burn you"*
oh man, and the days of piloted shredder
** *"COME CLOSE, AND LISTEN"* **
my mech rogue was on point
its amazing
oh man I saw this
that was when I was playing it at any free time I had
I really enjoyed the whole GvG era, and in extension TGT
this was around the WotoG era
true
turns into a sherazin
wild nzoth rogue?
depends how the deathrattles are
potentially
depends whats in the deathrattle pool
but that rogue card looks good
true true
buy time for your combo
perhaps the emeris OTK then?
or for an otk thing
for a control hunter I feel like it might have a place
I played it at a friends house and found it really nice and intuitive
but iirc it got screwed by bad release timing and a lack of advertising
I remember watching a speedrun of it and really enjoying it
something a tad like this
I attempt the first one, miss time my jump and end up falling into the pit
but I dont see how we could ever have PC's strong enough to run that
hey, at least they futureproofed it right
very scery
Mecha gruul Insta win game
To do quests
Just at rank 25
I have
Frozen everything
Put it with snowchugger
Missile launcher could be a meme
*together in electric dreams*
*we'll always be together*
Same tbh
Oh
Deal damage equal to the attack of a minion that get magnetized to it?
So what do people think it's gonna be?
Oh god
I will later
Something about unicorn priest
when im out of the first one
i'll tell you
go for it then
really?
when I logged in
got it
OOH
hmm
should I ?
noe
20
I have like
*why isnt this working*
<:NotLikePapika:284132078054932480>
ScrmzLoudAF#2402
it says its still pending
or do I need to install a new client?
tell me if it worked
ok ive sent one from a NA account
oh true
im making a NA account now if you need
that matters for hearthstone right?
oh fuck
it said the request is already pending
huh
its been sent
whats your battletag?
just loading it up now
sure
flat is justice
>Nice
thats alotta silence
damn
damn right
`hearthstone sucks ass`
ok sounds good
who knows
we have some pretty memey decks
gotcha
ok so I just pass then?
ty ty
ok cheers
and I only have options for standard sets
crafting
as an option
I get standard, basic and un'goro
ok wtf
is un-goro wild?
I should have enough dust
i got 4 packs
i'll change
no wild decks
no its my bad
*fuckin hearthstone*
I have no option for wild
what
~~hi back~~
ok, ready whenever
sounds good
and there are way too many long text things
yeah
*getting there slowly*
*secret paladin flashbacks*
whew, card
Malorne?
would you keep Morrigan *and* the new card
how would reincarnate work with it?
mhm
I feel like if other classes found a way to get it, it would be op as fuck
I like it
~~although we already all knew that~~
im a dum
oh fuck
rhino up, force of nature x2, innervate x2 coin savage roar
oh god can you imagine tundra rhino in druid
100%
the scourge of arena
wish I could hardcounter flappybird <:smh:290478190382546944>
unicorn priest mk 2
thats cool
OH
for some reason
doesnt silence off the charge it seems
I like that
oh thats cool
less aggro, more otk/combo
but is the -1/-1 worth being pernmenant
and permenant
standard tho
dont think so
tess rogue isnt running specters it seems
could make a nice 3 /4 tier meme deck
its not gonna be playable imo
true true
depends how the game runs, and I havent played with deathstalker rexxar before
5 mana is a bit much for that tho
could be>
that makes secrets free
I guess it works well with the hunter 3 mana thing
paladin doesnt have room for so many secrets
1/1 tundra rhinos bois
*who am I?*
yeah, hence much worse
*5 cards though*
but much worse
is it too slow though?
3 mana 5/5
oh cool
lomegalu
ok im ready for HS
so you mean all legendaries then random the rest?
was in a game
ok sorry
cos trees arent beasts
yeah yeah
oh wait
nah nah
looks like shirabe is trying my new combo
it fuckin is
you could also exchange a 1 mana early game card for lay on hands
yeah you're given rogue
spells are from every class
you cant even choose class iirc
oh, todays brawl is random class spells, summon a random minion of same cost when you cast a spell
or is it more combo oriented than tempo
and the earliest you can get this out
so whats best case scenario
oh, and its not a legendary so you can have two
thought it only triggered once
yeah, I forgot the second part
or the value from it is gonna be too much
like, oh shit I gotta kill that fast
its just a bit easier to kill
it does
wait no nvm
it doesnt have the oh shit factor or Thaurissan
>Nice meme
ah
~~i dont know what that is~~
oh im dum
oh really?
very strong
this seems

it was pretty funny though
at which point I just restarted
next turn played a 12/8 frog for 2 mana
the boss got emeriss turn one and two
boss power is give both people a random card, they cost 0
so the League of explorers final stage thing
ah
I love getting screwed by rng in adventures
yeah...
*I knew I could count on them*
oh, they found a way to make it work
I just got fucked out of a nice 8 drop by this
since when was naga sea witch 8 mana?
thats kinda good
oh damn
I was gonna say, i'd imagine if it were like that it would get needlessly complicated
ah right
as someone who's fairly interested in chemistry I love this
ok thats really cool
messes with my mind watching it though
very similar
thats uh
oh damn, you're right
but it *does* sound really fun, so if I get some spare time i'll definately give it a go
ive never really tried anything of the sort before
thats kinda cool
I might give it a go
never heard of them honestly
I've always thought about getting it, but seeing all of this amazing stuff I find it hard to think of anything close to the art pieces other people make
damn, those are some beautiful creations in opus magnum...
wait to see whats of use
I think im gonna wait a while before making a deck though
oh yeah, im excited for it
I had it in my mind as the 7th so I got real confused
thought so
ohh right
dayum
oh wait is it out already?
*tell a friend*
*guess who's back, back again*
<:MariaSunglasses:336656798687690752>
:3
aww cute
true true
oh right
i'd imagine the date?
<:howlewd:474601881562382346>
*THEN STRADDLES HIS LOCAL CRUISELINER*
oh riight
sounds like kantai collection
that uh
ah...
*oh dear*
looks like they did
whats the game actually meant to be about?
looks like a shitshow
<:NotLikePapika:284132078054932480>
no offense to shirabe.exe, but that sounds like something she would come up with
*Suddenly anime takes a whole new dimension of meaning*
*all this time Ive been interpreting it wrong*
what.
`oh hey a meme, I DOCK MY BOAT`
I won 2/3 of my rank 25 games with it
Pfft emeris hunter is a toptier deck what you saying
yeh, loved it
I have some semi decent planes, and a few lower level tanks
/ play if it comes to it
also i'd be up to talk about warthunder
oh my god, I just got the most bullshit win with flark. 8 off lethal, topdeck him and trigger explosive trap created by spellhunter weapon <:EZ:443448522990157829>
packpack


*mfw servers are full*
welp, its time
praying for my first ever golden legendary pull from a pack
<:TsubasaExcited:409481619842400257>
praying for EMP operative
<:NotLikePapika:284132078054932480>
you made me load it up
you got me
fuck
yep, Hearthstone
I went through the tutorial to test some stuff on NA, but that was pretty much it
Im europe servers, so I wont be able to play on you with my main account with all my cards
mm right
what servers do you play on?
sent
Until I find out what shitty legendaries I get
2 and a half hours
I dont have the dedication to do that honestly, i'd play for around a week then give up
I dont have the time nor patience to do that
I havent tried them tbh
prefer the way they play compared to the germans
I loved the british tanks for some reason
bloggers.
and I didnt play the game enough to care
sadly emeriss was the only legendary I unpacked that expansion
dire frenzy emeriss hunter was great
I love my 8/8 chargers for 1 mana
boar is a majestic card
Its the kind of thing I can see pro's bringing to a tournament or something
im a dum
*oh fuck I only just realised why its called apm priest*
eh, guess so
put them all on a boar, mass dispel and hit face for 128 damage
you get like infinite divine spirits from test subjects and a couple other spells
what are peoples thoughts on this APM priest thing going round
as fun as the flark hunter is, its really worth ignoring
im gonna wait a while before crafting
*maly druid
maly is looking strong at top levels
I would say odd paladin and zoolock rn
speaking of which, what would people say are some of the best decks now?
there used to only be 1 class legendary iirc
I feel like getting one back then was a much bigger deal
there were a lot fewer legendaries released though
fairs
you not including dreampetal florist in your malygos deck?
yeah, it feels like a bit too much of an aggro shitfest
theres also stuff like reno, rag and nzoth I could get rid of
alright, I worked out I have about 10K dust to work with if I go mad and disenchant loadsa shitty and kinda memey legendaries
I mean that would be pretty good
yeah
brb I just gotta work out how much leway I have dust wise
other only has the 3 cost thing
second one has twig, floops goop
funnily enough, the second deck is 1K dust more expensive
*you lied to me R*
oh it actually works
how do I search for these?
ty
anyone got a good decklist for maly druid?
*wait I could add this to my emeriss hunter*
iirc, if you dire frenzy a minion that has already been dire frenzied, it shuffles in the pre-buffed minion
malygos looks like a really fun deck
I want to make something fun and not that aggro, but I also kinda want it to be good
just looking at most of the decks now, zoo has such a huge winrate vs loads of stuff
ahh, I see now
otherwise its uh, a pretty good silence target
can you garunteed kill your mechacthun?
can you trigger it every time?
oh god
iirc the wii u was kept at the same price
nintendo dont lower the prices of their consoles
I think it is
ah, I had naxx in mind
I know the adventures later on had alot more
perhaps, im not sure
good luck, what a great way to do it
oh damn is it gonna rain again?
wild growth wild growth nourish arcane tyrant x2, UI, malygos which they couldnt remove, floop into double moonfire swipe
first game I won in 7 turns with perfect draws
malygos druid
welp, I finally went and did it
thats what
^
yeah, you need 10 empty mana crystals methinks
ah cool
oh, while youre at it, what is your battletag bread?
also congrats on 1000 wins
want to see the mecha-cthun kill animation
i'd be up for a game
i'd be down to watch but im almost finished with KLK
Probably take out a wrath or two
I should really add some dreampetal florists to my deck
You need 1 swipe to combo now
Yeah
Living roots is wild now iirc
Maybe alextrasa or something
So if they clear malygos you need a way to get the extra damage
But sadly swipe moonfire moonfire is only 21 damage with 1 malybos clone
I don't have either of them in mine
*but it was such a fun deck*
