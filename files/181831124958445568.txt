not to mention that Luxemburg's initial wealth is based on industry
its tax policies are just advantageous in the geographical context
Luxemburg is more of a semi tax haven
a rain dance
the same way we get water everywhere else
not really
not too much of a high rise situation going on here but steam heating is a rarity in residential buildings
systems are expected to take pressure surges within their specifications, closing or opening  an installed valve shouldn't destroy the line
radiators also work with warm water no problem
heating residential buildings with steam? <:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
I mean it's not practical and I wouldn't know how you would make one happen without disassembling a heating system and reconstructing it wrongly
how did you even come up with this idea?
that's not utilising steam hammer for a terrorist attack, that's literally just attacking a power plant and there are easier, less elaborate means to do so
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
do you mean like industry?
where do you have a notable amount of steam?
and no matter what you think about the opener it definitely worked
it was a genius marketing move
there's no irony?
they're not banned
but at least you can go into lectures if you feel like it without being a student so that's nice I guess?
the problem with historic unis has always been close to the city centre so inevitably had to spread out relatively far
as in the research complex is a good 10 miles from the core facilities
it's very split up where I am now
closer-to-15th-century-than-17th-century old <:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
yes
maybe university building styles are not as concentrated
universities around here aren't exactly new either ...
idk usually research buildings are separate from the rest of the buildings. not like students get access without a supervisor either way
is it for an elitist flair or is there any particular reason
that's it
and pay lunch
my id's only really good to lend books
huh interesting
oh you use ID with pictures to get in the building <:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
how do they find out what the people look like?
that sounds like stalking and I'm surprised places have the staff to do something of that kind
UK universities seem to be into plagiarism software, someone I know was in England for a year and it usually flagged him with 30-60% similarity <:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
if you can't at least change your variable names when discussing issues with someone then idk what you're even doing
paying to get spied on? sounds like a great deal
and I ask you again: how are they supposed to find out
and how are they supposed to find out
why not do it on a group if it's so much work
isn't having sex the opposite of a stereotype about people who watch anime <:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
royals are about divine right and their bloodline fetishes
we're at the point where your best case is the worst case for them <:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
idk what people expect from a *royal family*
`FULL STORY: PAGES 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10&11` how many pages does the daily mirror have <:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
now **that** is a tabloid cover
maybe not a fair comparison since RWTH hospital is the single largest hospital building in Europe <:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
it's a public hospital, not like price mattered too much
1 is the hospital
2 is the largest lecture hall
looks close ye
just bringing that up because they have a somewhat comparable amount of enrolled students at 47173
RWTH has one 1000 seat and 2 900 seats at its core facilities
it's for ~600 regular listeners but ends up being ~750 usually
people sit on the floor here too especially in the general physics lecture because it's fun lol
yeah 250 is kind of small for large amounts of listeners I agree
small groups vs lectures in terms of room size
idk I just sat into one when I was visiting someone at RWTH and that's not exactly small <:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
maybe the rooms are too small
will do, time to harass a radiologist <:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
because I was interested in the riddle and didn't bother reading any of the solo/armis backlog
but the riddle in particular was about us having a gun(s)
because setting up 10 imaginary ray guns and making sure that they interfere with each other in the right way doesn't exactly sound like a fast solution either
is this riddle somewhat based in reality or just completely made up
I can! it's 0%
if you read 2 sentences back you could see that airports are point of entries and treated as such, they are in no way comparable to a *checkpoint* on the road. this analogy would make sense if you landed at LAX and run into a checkpoint somewhere behind Simi Valley.
32.71473954125488, -112.84212801447647 shit like this, over 60 miles into Arizona
border patrol checking vehicles dozens of miles inland is not a border checkpoint
a border checkpoint is either at the border or close to it at points of entry
since it's a point of entry
if we're that technical about it that would be right at the border
America is the only country I'm aware of where you can run into a border checkpoint 50 miles behind the actual thing
it's still just mass surveillance <:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
your whole idea is just mass surveillance without cause
and is just as bad of an idea
that doesn't make any sense
what crime matches what criteria
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
reminds me of that one time when there was a proposal to clarify that upskirt shots are illegal and tabloids turned it into something along the lines of "yeah non consensual photographs were legal before"
but doing so may also result in a bit of confusion when the media spins it that way
you can always virtue signal and add a line but it doesn't make a difference legally
and what do you hope to gain from scanning licence plates
a curfew for men doesn't seem enforceable, it's an idea someone uttered without thinking about it at all
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
yeah nah
they're a federal law enforcement agency, legal costs don't matter
mh?
like construction sites
you raid business that are likely to have illicit labour
the point is that internal checkpoints only exist to harrass motorists and infringe on civil liberties
at this point you're just baiting <:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
mhhh idk maybe because you actually check entries at the border?
obviously there is one directly at the border...
nothing because Ajo isn't at the border either ;)
I put a red dot on the checkpoint and a red line along the border to illustrate this impudence
I can just ask you: do you think this is ok?
how is the state of the road relevant again?
if it wasn't in a desert it would probably look way worse
the road around it has cracks everywhere and seems poorly maintained imo <:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
the street view is from 2011 and it looks quite different <@!213645184125239317>
ok the surface of the checkpoint must be relatively new, probably the last 5 years
as far as I can tell it's brand new *the surface that is*
I sweat too
but then again the AC of the car won't necessarily cool down on 400m so I don't really see the big difference
unless you have 30+Â°C all year around
no way you get sweaty at that distance
there is just like
that's a 5 minute slow walk
<:GarieLaugh:740956278163243050>
in late 2020 the UBA reported that the travelled distances are often too short and could be managed by foot, bicycle, bus or tram. in cities with good public transportation electrical scooters are an inferior form of transportation and are worse for the environment. bicycles outperform scooters across the board.
how people use them is not something that changes with that
since people don't actually use them for distances that you'd ride a car for
not to mention that e scooters are not really eco friendly
anyway that would require these scooter companies to set up stations en masse, that would probably be a bit expensive
German shopping cart = aldi shopping cart, ok
oh you mean like literally any shopping cart lol
aldi trolley method???
the currently popular escooter rental model is a plague with not only people driving like idiots but also them lying around in places where they're no supposed to be and impeding pedestrians and cyclists
London hardly is one of them
petty as fuck
yeah but that only really applies if you have some outstanding skill
I don't think there's enough day in a day for that
that would be like driving from DC to Dallas every day
nobody would drive 1300 km every day for work
that would be one hell of a commute
capital M may be miles I guess <:YumiStare:688429724065988721>

can't exactly tell mel not to, can still give my two cents
yeah, I do <:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
I love semantics
can the church be bigoted? after all they decide what's the right religious behaviour
you don't have to have respect for abrahamic religions but they still exist
nz has a very luxurious position
vietnam has vey strict containment
I don't know why anyone still expects anything from religions <:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
how can American news be literally dead about AZ
there are plenty of murderous cults in rich countries
I don't see the correlation between being a poor country and religious extremism
comparing anime fans to terrorist
if we consider that our current population would not be possible without WW1
mhh yes
we may be missing a lot of things if those two wars never happened
WW2 as well I guess?
WW1 was probably worth it
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
always results in "nazi experts" coming out of the woodwork within seconds though
Godwin's law came faster than expected
that's not really the case either, entertaining such an organisation requires money
gps, internet, spacecraft, jetplanes,e tc
the time frame is relevant
yeah but certain big ones are unlikely to exist without a military demand backing them
the argument is that some demand initially comes from military applications that don't exist in the private sector
it predates WW1 but it was certainly boosted by the fact that Germany could not rely on natural resources also in the context of the upcoming war effort
how come?
Haber process and space travel are pretty good examples
chemistry took a significant leap in WW1 because of WW1
but what about the chemical advancements that were only necessary because of war?
and space travel?
and jet and space travel
a lot of tech for miltary
let's say 99% of fertiliser are made with WW1 tech
I'm not saying it doesn't work, I'm saying it has no practical application because of reasons already stated
I can imagine that having a conventional missile defense system would have a better cost to kill ratio than having a plane strapped with a laser ready to intercept
probably because strapping a laser to a plane almost nullifies the benefits of lasers <:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
their intended purpose at the moment is CIWS
not as far as you want but far enough to be usable
all the manufacturing and medical applications are close range
you know what kind of lasers this is about <:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
stuff like HUDs made it into the civil sector though, probably the first one that comes to mind
not really a lot of civil applications for electromagnetic catapults and laser weapons right now lol
high US military spendings still help technological advancements, though with somewhat limited civil application for now
the ISS was planned as  a military station at first lank...
just a small bump

yeah NASA wouldn't have pulled all that off if it wasn't the governments declared goal to beat the soviet union
and yet the first man made object to enter space was a ballistic missile
and long term economic benefits are also hard to predict for that matter<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
space crafts are money sinks
because it has no immediate economic benefit
hard agree with that because space exploration and space craft are a risk I doubt any private company would take
"a simple extension of physics" okay
if all you care about are wikipedia screenshots you can have this one lank lol

but if you want a example to disprove your point that there is **no** socialism whatsoever in Europe I can recommend portugal
unfortunately I don't speak all European languages <:YumiStare:688429724065988721>

yeah absolutely no socialist movements in Europe lol

the big difference is that the human genome project is cheap as fuck

social democrats have been considered centre left here before ww2 already but whatever lank says
whatever you say
not many people wanted a second round of *that*
the socialist party was not banned from taking part in elections
lived her live in a socialist state until it collapsed
Angela Merkel who lived in Eastern Germany and got education is Eastern Germany
they just didn't get anywhere near enough votes because socialism ruined the country
?????????
????
did all the party member suddenly die in 1990
is it not in western europe right now?
*I may not know the language but I can make unlimited assumptions about semantics*
state owned businesses, state organised economy, equal work for men and women, how are you going to make this one not socialist I wonder?
and it got 100% of the valid votes too, so they're definitely represented in parliament <:VanessaSmug:689395769199165447>
the SED was definitely socialist <:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
if you're also ok with failed states
kek
lank follows a radical, revolutionary definition of socialism
like the state taking ownership of all companies is not something I'd hear in reference to socialism
because socialism doesn't have a 100% set definition just like left wing/right wing/fascsim/etc.
this is Portugal
and since the socialists are already pretty  left leaning no reason to go off the far end?
no because surprisingly enough not a lot of people are full blown communism fans
4,3% 5% with their partner

you left that part out too

n=4000
I honestly can't find anything about it
hello lank? where is canada's UBI
because you can't raise the rent as you want in a lot of places
why can't I find any news about that?
trials with small sample sizes
lanks ideas have no practical use cases
per person per what?
by bulding up infinite debt?
UBI provides good results in trials but has limited practical application because a state can't afford it
like Australia
rich people will still migrate to countries that favour them

let's say I pay a guy $900. now the govt comes in and says they give everyone $1000 and they're going to finance it by getting more taxes from me I'd logically lower the wage I pay significantly
why would they have to pay more?

no
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
there's really not a lot of contextualising to do
assault as a US legal term with dozens of state definitions is not relevant to this thought experiment I'd say <:YumiStare:688429724065988721>

yes, it would be a diplomatic shit show but criminal consequences are unlikely

it's just dubious that this is already the second time this particular vessel had an accident because of "wind"
wind was already at fault in the Elbe
wind is the favourite excuse
there were also reports that the ship's last recorded speed was 13.5 knots which is way above the speed limit
probably the former
either the crew is incompetent or the ship line is badly constructed
talking about speed though, apparently the ship was going too fast when it happened
ye, didn't say otherwise...
didn't say they unstuck it 10 hours ago
they straightened it like 10 hours ago
