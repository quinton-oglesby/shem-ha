Oof
I see
<:HibikiThink:688429715362414641>
So a super player can dish out dmg, leave it at 1%, retreat and open the raid?
What happens if you retreat in a raid battle? Do you keep the dmg or you lose it all
<:HibikiAwe:688397678572339230>
So you can jebait a carol raid with nobody alive but garie, which means 0 dmg done?
Tried carol for the first time, so doing dmg to her autoscorers doesn’t count? <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
Yikes
Ez 1 cp 3 times a day
<@!251037892221075456> thanks <:KirikaHappy:688432863796133888>
Time to snipe <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Snuck in boulé’s raid <:MariaSpy:688429716104806412>
Oof that tech boss hits hard
I shud try it out
Never fought a techraid boss
It was torture doing that raid
Ignite bikky can remove the boss’ buffs, pretty handy
I joined a B raid from someone named D352, hmmmmm <:KirikaConcern:698939825386029186>
🐲 🔥 🔥 🔥 <:KirikaCry:674720015047720961>

Hunt is the killstealer
44 burnbasa here
Lvl 70s with bad burn rng will just die because their turns are faster <:HibikiDespair:688429715450757206>
I have to do 20cp just to get contribution reward
I’ve dealt 40k or less on dragon and that’s 10 cp
<:KirikaCry:674720015047720961>
All giga rainbows tho
Managed to join in and got high dmg reward <:TikiPraise:672430544381935625>
5 giga body <:TikiPraise:672430544381935625>
Managed to snipe kill a B dragon raid
If you do higher contribution dmg, do you get better reward quality?
How do you handle their increasing dmg as the fight goes on? Do you just sustain?
At least i can handle charm boss decently
3 more to go
Managed to snipe another B dragon raid, another 5 giga bodies from hunt
It still stings at lvl 50, but no burn debuff
Nulifies the double flame storm at start
She does
In the meantime, gotta find 600 stones somewhere
Just waiting for the next xd dess banner
Giga bodies done!
Put it in your nickname like some of us
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
Hunt reward is delicious
I... snipe sometimes
597k, hope that helped a bit
Brb
Public? I can help out
<:KirikaPog:605209108827734017>
Anyone doing dex carol?
Unless cais kills it by then
I’ll go again in 15 mins
<@!263392442345193472> that’s you right
Dished out 656k <:KirikaCry:674720015047720961>
It’s top 3
Oh degu’s message isn’t pinned <:HibikiAwe:688397678572339230>
Only for exchanging shop currency to buy you a guaranteed gear like ignite fest
Dont use tix anyway
It does a skill, but nothing happens
I mean my gears were lvl 40-50
I did nothing as well
Used them to aid a Dex Carol
Got 10cp available here, anybody needs help?
Loliflamestormu

The hipster version of yolo
Carpe diem
<:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>

<:SerenaSmile:672908572774105109>

Sloppy solo <:VanessaCracked:639136452600397829>
2 turned the raid
Just did a 10cp smol carol just for lulz
It was already red in hp but she pretty much soloed it 600k dmg
I did the red lion raid 3 cp with lvl 58 blue carol
The weather trying to dethrone god <:HibikiThink:688429715362414641>
My first time in this channel <:FujitakaScared:672430483702939659>
