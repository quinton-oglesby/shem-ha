<:HibikiHi:336657249827028993>
is kai a separate game? I always thought it was just the anime that was split
the alternative would be that an insignificant amount of his fans are fascists and that's not saying anything, certainly nothing that would make his moral obligation to donate money to "separate" himself
either that or a significant portion of them
that's a pretty serious claim to make about 100 million people
wonder if there is any data on correlation with non-gun violence
if some actual fascist still thinks pewdiepie is supporting his beliefs than he'd have to be an idiot, true
or you're horribly exaggerating
I'm looking for the backlash but I only see some comments with couple hundreds of upvotes and 20k dislikes on a video with 13 million views, so maybe I'm missing something
it's way too vile and horrific
I read quite a big portion of Bible but I just couldn't take it
you can always say it's "open to interpretation"
but the bible is cherry picked so much already that it shouldn't matter
but there's a ton of passages in the vane of "if a man shall lie with another man they should be killed"
as long as it's with girls
no, pedophilia is perfectly fine in the bible
well, they also think homosexuality is a disease or a treatable disorder
my country is 95% catholic so I guess I'm too used to this shit
homophobic priest? in other words, a green grass?
depending on a general public's knowledge and awareness is the worst mistake you can make, sincerely, someone with clinical depression
magic cloth requires obedience
not to mention that after the holy knights captured Jerusalem they killed not only all muslims but jews too
church didn't fuck around back then
there was also a crusade against cathars, who were basically just christian heretics
so the whole synod is still technically valid
oh god that aftermath is better than I remembered
love that the pope was later imprisoned and strangled to death for this
history is stranger than ~~symphogear~~ fiction
let's dig up a corpse so we can hold a trial
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cadaver_Synod
papacy was such a shitshow
it's like that spiderman meme
yeah
you pay priest to perform masses in dead person's intention for a month so they skip the purgatory
yeah, there are still some remnants of this, for example gregorian masses
basically if you lost a vote on some doctrine of faith you were now branded a heretic and condemned to eternal punishment as such
history of early Church is pretty fun, so many different schisms, heresies and bullshit arguments
in modern days at least
yeah
imagine converting pagans when the condition was to cut off their foreskin without anaesthesia
true
yeah, it's stolen from other religions like half of their beliefs
threat of eternal torture for basically thoughtcrimes is probably the most damaging thing you can implant in your child
it's not mentioned anywhere in the bible with the exception of "lake of fire" in the apocalypse
jews didn't have the concept of hell
not so much new testament as later christian interpretations
new testament is much more psychologically terrifying though
it's also much less concerned with day to day bullshit like circumcision and the type of clothes you wear
and likes to talk to itself
for one, new testament god has split personality
there are parts instructing how much can you beat your slaves
western journalists and politicians: Poland should take in migrants as a compensation for colonies
Poland: never had colonies
it's rising and the migrant crisis doesn't help
not too much common you can say about Switzerland and Ukraine
Europe is a very diverse continent
<
can India in general just stop
what for?
as someone who lives one war-torn country away from Russia I'd much prefer the US having the influence anyway
not like gas chambers
I meant the sarin usage in 2013
there was no rational reason for Assad to piss off the whole world gassing his civilians when he was winning anyway
the whole chemical weapons attacks smell like the "Iraq has WMDs" bullshit
I'd rather have a dictator than ISIS occupying that region
Syria is definitely the most suspicious one for me but then again all of the recent wars were pretty shady
I can give you multiple reasons for not accepting migrants that have nothing to do with race, but if you'll keep harping on it anyway there's no point in talking
but Lincoln himself said that if he could win the war without freeing a single slave he would do it
but yes, one side wanted to keep slaves
partly
I am
not so much race wars
our history is full of national and religious wars
maybe it is, but it shouldn't be if we care about correctness
if I say that eating pasta is an Italian thing is that racist?
I'm talking about a large part of Polish society
so again you're just proving my point
Americans are not even a race
no, pointing someone's mentality is not racist
it makes zero sense
and yet we accept people that we hate much more
if you say that we don't accept migrants because we hate them
yes, and?
that's a very American thing to do
the wording is there because I don't like reducing every issue to racism
I'd say even more than Russians
I can assure you we hate Ukrainians way way more than brown and black people
wonder whyyyy
also nobody mentions that we took couple millions of Ukrainian refugees, I guess they don't matter
exactly
yeah
truth doesn't pay well
I don't think they're necessarily stupid but they bank on their viewers's stupidity
if I counted how many times I've seen journos talking about polish death camps
I mean
wonder how would you say Grzegorz Brzęczyszczykiewicz
it does kinda sound similar
but fuck is also jebać which is different
kurwa being like fuck and whore in one
pizda is way more specialized
truly the lockpick of words
^
can't guarantee there's every single form but it should give you an idea

I wish it was
I guess it's like the you're/your type of mistakes
correcting people on Polish grammar is way too fun though
same, especially in English
so how should it be worded?
I'm doing my best, you can blame English for being so confusing <:MariaSunglasses:336656798687690752>
hence used to
now thou is just not used at all
I meant that thou was exclusively singular and you was plural, but I could be mistaken
not saying it was
old English seems to make much more sense
didn't thou use to be singular?
so many misunderstandings
I hate when singular and plural is the same
"they" is a very weird and lazy word, same as "you" actually
in English you say "blue" or "went" just the same with all genders
in Polish you can't say any verb or adjective without assigning the subject a gender
English as a whole is very gender neutral
so I shouldn't be surprised
but I guess they now hold him responsible for the Christchurch
you're speaking like he murdered somebody
it means much less when you call everyone racist
and vice versa
now you don't even have to be a fascist, just a right winger?
so we moved the goalposts again?
I don't think ADL is the only worthwhile organization on the planet
so, there's literally no issue
"Kjellberg said he’s still going to donate the $50,000"

also
“I made the mistake of picking a charity that I was advised to instead of picking a charity that I’m personally passionate about,” 
that's perfectly valid
that's not an iron cross
lol
so going back to the issue, if you're trying to invoke a guilt trip in a nation that suffered death camps as a "subhuman race" by calling them racists, you're not going to get very far
sure
dź is harder to explain
but not as long
ó like oo in "cartoon"
ł is read like w in "word"
unless you mean just the "dge" part then kiiiinda?
nooooo
hedge?
again with the easier
everyone knows it's physically impossible to lie on age questions
"asks" good joke
fix'd
not swearing on HBO is a bad thing*
remember when GTA was blamed for half the murders in the states
you're much more responsible for your kids than for your viewers
it's not what easier, it's what makes sense
editing mistakes are a dime a dozen
after reading those tweets I can't agree
as opposed to whom?
who didn't have a fake yt account as a kid may throw the first rock
how would I know, I'm not a minor
that would change nothing
what if he did
youtube has videos of kids beating animals to death, but it's those pesky gamers that are the problem
^
you're joking, but annihilation of human species would solve all our problems <:Ver:336656981144109066>
because twitter knows best
for example I view myself as a centrist but many people have called me far right
I mean you can, but you won't live for long
you can't make enemies out of everybody
eh sure, but that's just how social animals behave
but when you're on the far edge of the spectrum even centrists look like your mortal enemies
I agree dino, but with the addition that both right and left are not bad
that's how nations work
calling it racism is not laziness
you can call it xenophobia or bigotry
and I deliberately brought it again
hating Christians or atheists isn't racist, but hating Muslims is
so fuck using correct words
just few hours ago someone was explaining that the term racist can be applied to anything you want because apparently humans are lazy
doesn't stop twitter
I don't have twitter either
I'm sorry but twitter knows you better than you do
trust me, you are
everyone is racist these days so who cares if you're called it or not
it stops being about integrity when the system is broken
because that's basically a suicide for the youtuber
don't you need an account to watch 18+ videos or did they change it?
^
no?
it's the same as theists trying to prove that some God exists
unless you can prove a specific form of afterlife the question of its existence is moot
nihilism certainly helps with the fear of death but I'd be careful with it
not to us
it's pointless to the universe
I'm most anxious about the whole Iran fuckery
Mongols came pretty damn close
so far nukes have given us the most peaceful period in human history
one well aimed gamma ray burst from a supernova and we're all dead
Earth is the worst tsundere, but we're just a tiny speck in its history
I always found biblical Satan way more sympathetic
Paradise Lost, anyone?
sounds like abuse alright
and forced them to walk naked
crawling on its belly is hardly a punishment for a snake
also did you notice that the snake got off with the lightest punishment of the three?
so they couldn't possibly know that disobedience is bad
also the whole garden of eden story is really funny when you realize that God punished humans for disobeying him before they even knew what good and evil was
almost as if God wanted to trick us
yeah, if we assume humans worked the save as literally every other species to ever exist, a single first couple would be impossible, so there'd have to be an exception that's really well masked
because to be honest, without Adam and Eve you have no original sin and no reason for Jesus to come and save us
I basically dropped out of catholicism completely when I learned that despite claiming they accept the theory of evolution, they still believe in literal Adam and Eve from whom all humans were born
yeah, or just do you hold those beliefs
are you still following them?
that's basically most of the occult traditions
I have zero knowledge on mormons but that sounds interesting
they get the most
if I were God I'd pick the ugly bastard
Lawrence Krauss also did some interesting work on the theory of universe out of nothing
deism it defined as the belief in a non-influencing God
that's why I said deist
it's basically impossible to prove or disprove existence of the deist God since he doesn't influence our reality in any way
unless it gives you actionable steps
JWs also have their own very distinct version of the Bible
why am I not surprised
I read it in modern translation from the original languages and it's still really fucked up
there are many pastors who think that KJV is the only "real" version
don't know much about the English translations of the Bible but I know KJV is the most popular so I use it most often in conversations
https://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/40yohv/im_the_pastor_who_became_an_atheist_after/
found him, Yuriy Stasyuk, it wasn't first time reading but rereading, but still
crap, there are so many articles and videos about priests becoming atheists that I can't find that specific one
I had seen the story of a pastor who decided to read the whole Bible and became atheist
Numbers, God to Moses:
31:17 Now therefore kill every male among the little ones, and kill every woman that hath known man by lying with him.
31:18 But all the women children, that have not known a man by lying with him, keep alive for yourselves.
nice bookmarks for all the juiciest bits of the Bible you need
if anyone doesn't know it already I recommend https://skepticsannotatedbible.com/
but on the upside sometimes you get a bonus and God lets you murder the whole town
the classic case of it's funny because it's true
but if your whole community is actually religious it must be hell if you happen to stand out in any way
we only have jehowa's withesses going door to door
I guess that the perk of living in such a monolithic country is that there's not much of converting
shitting on my religion is strangely cathartic
but you have to run it by him first
God is pretty cool with murder as we learn many times in the Bible
Cain's sin wasn't even killing his brother as much as lying to God about it
oof
also, aesthetics
I still respect catholicism much more than the protestant denominations for at least trying to stick to some rules instead of just saying "fuck it, everyone can interpret the Bible as he wants"
same with catholics, you can totally be gay as long as you don't want to have a relationship or sexual life like any normal person
I'm glad that I was the most religious out of my family, made it much easier to abandon ship
remember the satanic panic?
depends on the religion
yeah, so much for the free will
good guy Satan, sees Jesus starving on a desert and offers him food
an anime I don't like is being called nazi and an artist I don't like even more is being called a pedophile for drawing an older version of a character, I'm so torn
I'm so fucking done
yeah, game dev companies are so much worse than camps that killed over a million people
please fucking tell me
you didn't just unironically say this
there's Tetris and umm... Tetris
yeah, I too miss the glory days of soviet video games
lootboxes are borderline gambling crap, but if my kid stole my credit card for any reason I'd be pretty fucking pissed
the only horseshoe I know is the brony youtuber
no idea
not much, just shitting on christianity
haven't seen shield hero but he's pretty good as Machio
not saying we should get a scientifically plausible explanation for Saitama's strength, but saying he's just working harder than other people is very reaching
it's hardly hard work
once you can finish the training once, there's not that much you can gain from repeating it
it would be very strenous at the start, that's it
even if we assume that that kind of shitty training regiment actually worked in the world of OPM, if some regular shmuck is the only person who ever managed to stick to it it says way more about other people than about Saitama
yeah, even if we assume you had to do the 100 push ups in one set (I don't think it's ever stated) the running would be the hardest part
you need progression to grow
nobody runs 10k every day because it's a shit way to train
OPM is pretty serious if you look past the gags
it's a pretty big assumption to say that nobody in the whole world of OPM has tried strength training
Boros was the nail in the coffin
the original premise was good enough for an episode or two, but after that it became so boring
yeah, since the parody fell completely flat for me it was a great change
I mean that the part of the manga it adapts was pretty bad, yes
S2 is better than S1 just by the virtue of what it adapts
solo leveling did the OPM training better anyway <:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
the issue lies in the consequences, if Saitama isn't lucky then all of the characters in OPM are basically NEETs not worth a single dime
aren't genetics basically luck too?
if gag anime can have serious themes how does OPM being gag anime invalidate the discussion
unless for gags too like Zetsubou Sensei
gag anime usually don't go into portraying depression of the main character
again, OPM is pretty damn serious underneath the gags
speed o sound sonic works so hard even his name is two times longer than needed
same
also Mob is relatable as hell
same
mob's fights are much more personal and ideological so the show needs to build that first
well there was no hype in the first 2 episodes so I can't blame you
but with better animation to be fair
MHA is on the level of fairy tail, SDS and other bottom of the barrel shounen
Black Clover >>>> MHA
other shows are clearly for you or not for you
yes, black clover, MHA, OPM
so it's much easier for them to be just meh
some series just try to pander to the largest crowd possible
I can't remember a single boring scene in nise
that's rich given we're on Symphogear server
can't handle some innocent wincest?
bruh

only took 3 years
finally finished Monogatari
they should make Tsukihime instead
I mean they are
but the beginning was very poor
so maybe "it gets better"
I didn't make it far
wish ufotable adapted something good instead
it must be really bad when DS is the best one
I think I'll pass then
did they bring urobutcher back or are they continuing the S2 garbagefest?
nightmare fuel
they look like someone photoshopped child's face onto adult body
especially Escanor and Meliodas
also, can we talk about how creepy SDS designs are
even Deen won't fix this shitshow
so MHA isn't the worst airing series
oh, Boruto
but they adapted 1 chapter into 3 fucking episodes
it's an insanely fast paced series
BC had the misfortune of being picked up by Pierrot of all people
Tanjiro is a balding 14 year old, Kanao is unbelievably ugly, Giyu I guess is the least offensive but still looks terrible
no
bad designs in Demon Slayer? Tanjiro, Kanao, Giyu to name a few

visuals matter in a visual medium
but man
Dr Stone is still the king of terrible designs this season
but even they couldn't fix the designs
but the story is still 10/10
let's be honest, the manga looks like dogshit
no filler (except for 2 recap episodes), no wonky animation, barely any cut content
<:ChrisEnraged:423196924368388105>
I guess I should just accept that HxH ruined shounen for me forever
pretty good
but that's as far as I'd go
yeah
nothing can
if that game couldn't be made into a banger
look at persona 5 anime
I know
isn't monster hunter like a poor man's dark souls?
as proved by Fire Force it can't save bad manga either
my bad
God Hand, Zestiria
they made some shit anime too
they are nowhere near as hard to understand as Monogatari or Gintama
they pulled the rakugo scenes incredibly well
same energy
rakugo is one of the best drama in anime period
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
truth
yeah, Konosuba was intentional, compare it to Rakugo from the same year
no, Sankarea
quick reminder that Deen made the best looking ecchi anime to date
I'm talking about Deen
I'm not talking about DS
how does it feel living in 2006?
you mean Toei
Deen?
both bad
the clothes and earrings on Tanjiro don't help either
https://i.redd.it/05ftfu1p0km31.png
that would be me
fire force definitely had a drop in quality recently
his height too
but it's kinda shaming you for it
there's food
nope, unless you want my opinion on the designs
geah was #1 in score recently
they definitely want to showcase the popularity more than the quality
yeah
score, not karma
BC at number 1 lol
any TDCC fans? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrJZJtY6u7o
