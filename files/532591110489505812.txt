We will never know about the lewd version
Hmmmmm
We have to find it
There is another version of the transformation

I have serious news that needs research
Guyyyssss
Ok thanks
Did episode 3 air today?
Something bad happens
It’s <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
Did you all see the new screen shots for episode six
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
I just want the death of Milarc
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
Well kirika was down to destroy the world with a moon
<:Germain:421434126856486912>
Hopefully she never gets redemption
She’s caused too much pain
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
Milarc will never be forgiven by me
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
Can we kill milarc
I will protect Elfnein
I would kill milarc
If I could
<:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
<:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
I don’t see the show separating them
Or what if both miku and bikki get killed off
Just like how the auto scorers cameback
No one sees anything coming
It could come from left field
I was just wondering
But why not
Any which one would it be ?
Anyone think the show could kill any girl off
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
Tsubasa next death
Nice

I’m woke




Clearly I’m the only woke one here
Nothing went as planned for fudo
I still don’t get that
Doubt
What if miku is already gone
Local mom bust pose
I hate myself for laughing


Haters all of you
Elza was a good doggo
Elza did not deserve this
Fast
They just got killed off
Are we not going to talk about this


I get people want guns to protect themselves but have easily available guns give people a chance to use them
I don’t own guns but I’ve been in a mass shooting, I was there for the police murder in Dallas.
I understand both points of view with wanting more gun control and wanting less
Nah it’s mostly a race and and crime problem
