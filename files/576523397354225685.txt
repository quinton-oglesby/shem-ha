You've jinxed it now
niche game
Yeah the game isn't that big
its just copy and paste from JP
Course they did
<:dcglobal:588832904541372456>
I'm surprised it took them that long to do something whiel they allowed those nat 5*s the easy RB
easy economy
I just sniped bosses
<a:aPES_Think:493353113332219924>
But least it means no more 2 hour raid
smh
Need to actually team up for raids now
<:thinkingfroge:679322849357463557>
Since they fixed raids its going to be very hard to find public raids to snipe
Yup
yup
Right I probably need to add some people from here
one more than me
also their stats are a bit low i guess
Thats the fair part
Nah
its additive
yes
yeah
better memorias for everyone else
Which is better
Its the healer it boosts
yeah
I wish I had more of the healer memoria tho
and red 3* at LB3
Got the blue 3* at RB 5 star
so w/e
but I haven't spent crystals
same
but like 3%
I would like more 4* healerabe

<:dcglobal:588832904541372456>

I did for a year
crashing in raids tho is the worst thing
Such an old system of doing it but its fine
No

<:thinkingfroge:679322849357463557>
