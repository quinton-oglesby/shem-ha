At least the icon shown will be the one with the highest role in place
I used the game assets from Disgaea RPG for the role Icons from the server I'm in, those pics were examples as such
Aren't there character icons from XDU? Could use those since they're small enough?
And it's only accessible if the server is boosted to Lv. 2
Like so, this is from another server I'm in
Role Icons are now a thing, I could suggest the icons match their respective character role

Ah, a little screw up from me, I had my story viewable only for registered users, it's now viewable for everyone
A friend of mine and I are doing ongoing NSFW stories involving our and others' OCs.
Expect demons, corruptions, and sex. Mine is a side story.

Vic Mignogna, Qrow's original VA would get replaced with Jason Liebrecht starting with Vol 7, I think due to the kerfuffle that happened couple of years ago...
Ah, and a bit controversial here in relation to VAs...
Oh, a little fun fact, Oum himself does voices one of the characters in the show before his passing
It honestly does get better, but fate would have other plans because Monty passed away while the series was still going
Oh yeah

OUCH
Yeah

From the mind of **Liam VIckers** (creator of CliffSide) and produced by **Glitch Productions** (Sunset Paradise, Meta Runner, SMG4), what do you get with a animated CG show of comedy and horror about cute robots that murder other robots for reasons?
You get **Murder Drones**!

So with Stone Ocean coming out on Netflix today, how are you going to watch it? Keep to tradition and watch it on JoJo Fridays or binge all on one night?
Hulu does have Ultimate, but only offers the Sub, which is sad
A little something about Zestiria in general, it's the sequel after the events of Berseria, which came out later as the prequel
Hmmm
I did hear about a movie in the works, but didn't the supposed final episode air?
I thought the show ended months ago
https://twitter.com/ToeiAnimation/status/1472707663226044418
35 years ago, a bizarre legend was born!
https://twitter.com/SenEto99/status/1477144600489963520

https://twitter.com/thecartooncrave/status/1479588794202529797?s=20
WELL GUESS WHAT
Hitomi Nabatame and Akari Kageyama, the confirmed VAs for newcomers Nia and Mukuro
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSXCh3Ha1UY
They added that later as people were going ballisitic

Good news
It even carried over to like streaming services like Netflix
They're why that came to be
You know the legendary "Jelly Donuts" scene?
One Piece, Pokemon to name a couple
They were basically known for censorship out of the wazoo
And it was just announced like an hour ago
https://team-rwby-project.com
He's not exactly the writer for Super anyway, he just gives the draft for it and everyone else just fills in the gaps
And I was going to say
That's a bit harsh
Z's one thing, but Super's another
Again, I'm in the middle with Buu
Not completely his fault as he did wanted it to end at Cell, but best wishes be damned as they wanted more
But didn't Goku mention that he barely broke into SSJ3 after he obtained it? It's like when Gohan went SSJ2 in the HTC for a second before passing out
Didn't want to shatter Vegeta's pride and leave him a broken man
Given that it used up what remaining time Goku had
And really? That old excuse?
Hell, Budokai Tenkaichi 2 did a what-if on the Saga
You forget Goku was only brought back for one day, before Babidi became an issue, it was like a long reunion
No matter how much punishment they dealt to him, he could just bounce back like no problem
Like how Cell could regenerate lost limbs, Buu could do so with no problem
Except there was one constant problem
I'm a bit of both of agree and disagree with the Buu Saga

Sheild Boi is back, April 2022
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMZDGyihTyc
And I do like that the show does bring updates when it reaches certain episodes
I say Saga instead of Arc because of how long the thing is, you might as well call it a saga
GO!! from the original's Tsunade Search Arc
Niwaka Ame ni mo Makezu, from Shippuden's 4GNW Saga
I'd say
If I were to do one per series/part
Not to mention some of the Sound 4 are gone and Kimimaro is added in as well
OG
Like, Kai is just the same thing just with different lines, a reimagining, an adaptation of the original if you would, and that's certainly been done a thousand times with different media sources
Think of Kai like TFS' DBZA, but official
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uyUNEL1CsC4
Hell, Kana-Boon, the band for the song, wasn't their first rodeo, they also did one for the Boruto movie, the first opening for Boruto: NNG, and the opening to Storm 4
Silhouette is sorta obvious because of memes, but I do love it
And the updates that came with that
Also a favorite of mine
Be it with animation improvements, reveals of new characters, etc.
https://twitter.com/HazbinHotel/status/1496214577146695685
Apparently for the dub there were several op songs, but Overdrive was the one among them all
Likewise with 5D's dub opening, I've yet to see all of the JP OPs
Never mind
Wait
So fun thing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2d3TcCCGVI
It's expected for something to have a couple of stumbles and fumbles
That was only because J.C. Staff was having an off season
The Global release of Spirit Pledge, the theatrical adaptation of Date A Bullet, the western release of Rio Reincarnation, etc., etc.
And what came in between
Not to mention this has been in the backburner for a couple of years due to COVID
Date A Live IV Key Visual + Premieres on April 8th!

New Season, new dub cast! As for those curious on why Billy Kametz isn't reprising his role for Naofumi, he recently posted that he's been diagnosed with stage 4 colon cancer, so he's taking a break on things for a while until that gets sorted out

He wanted to take a break on it and see if this could get treated
Yeah, that cancer did a number on him, it was why he didn't reprise his role as Naofumi and was replaced for the 2nd season of SH's dub
And more recently Macaque from Lego Monkie Kid

Kyoshi with the past
Zuko the present
and Korra the future
What I thought of this is like three characters from three points in time
Meh, won't stop me tho
I've yet to watch Mayuri Judgement, IV, and Bullet
Ah, beat me to it, but yes!
*Season 5 is now in development!*

To be fair, we haven't seen them how they looked between after TLA and pre-Korra

So, a little something from Kids Next Door. In the episode Operation: F.O.O.D.F.I.T.E., the music composed is done by American heavy metal band Gwar (or rather in this case Rawg). The songs in the episode were retrofitted versions of "The Private Pain of Techno Destructo" and "Gor-Gor"
